1. To assess the safety of itacitinib  monotherapy as the primary 
treatment of newly diagnosed, low -risk acute GVHD defi ned by 
standard risk clinical criteria (Minnesota) and biomarkers (Ann 
Arbor 1 GVHD)  
2. To determine the incidence of serious infectious complications in 
patients with GVHD treated with itacitinib  
3. To determine the GVHD response rate to systemic steroid

Number of Subjects  70 
Inclusion Criteria  1. Newly diagnosed GVHD that meets criteria for Minnesota 
standard risk  
2. Ann Arbor 1 GVHD by biomarkers

Study Product (s), Dose, 
Route, Regimen  Itacitinib 200 mg orally daily for 28 day induction cycle followed by 28 
day maintenance cycle  
Duration of 
Administration  56 days  
Statistical Methodology  The pr imary study measure is the proportion of patients who achieve CR 
or PR by day 28 of treatment with itacitinib without the addition of any other 
systemic GVHD treatment including steroids. The expected proportion of 
low-risk acute GVHD patients who achieve CR or PR by day 28 of standard 
steroid treatment is 67%. Extensive preliminary discussion indicate that 
physicians would accept a 15% decrease in the overall response rate to 
primary GVHD treatment (from 67% to 52%) if steroid treatment could be 
avoided in  the responders without an increase in the incidence of steroid 
refractory GVHD. A sample size of 70 achieves 81% power to detect a non -
inferiority proportion of 52% using a one -sided exact test with a significance 
level of 0.04 calculated using binomial e numeration of all possible 
outcomes. This study will terminate early if the incidence of steroid 
refractory GVHD exceeds the historical rate of 38% or if the incidence of 
non-relapse mortality (as a measure of all potential toxicities) exceeds the 
historic al rate of 9% (section 8.7).

 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Acute  GVHD  
 
Hematopoietic cellular transplantation (HCT) is an important treatment for high -risk hematologic 
malignancies whose curative potential depends on the graft -versus -leukemia (GVL) effect  which is 
mediated by alloreactive T cells in the donor graft.   GVL effects are closely associated with graft -
versus -host disease (GVHD), which is mediated by those same T cells1. Graft -versus -host disease 
(GVHD)  targets the skin, liver and GI tract.  GVHD  is the major cause of non -relapse mortality (NRM) 
after HCT1-3. Maxi mal GVHD grade , which  only reflects response to treatment, correlates with 
NRM4. GVHD symptom severity at presentation modestly  correlate s with outcomes but not 
sufficient ly to guide treatment5,6. For example, the Minnesota classification system uses GVHD 
symptom severit y at diagnosis to strati fy patients into standard and high risk groups with 
significantly different risk for NRM (22% vs 43%, p<0.001)6. The risk for NRM even in the favorable 
group remains to o high to de -escalate treatment, high dose systemic glucocorticoids (steroids). A s 
a result, primary treatment for GVHD has not changed over  the past 40 years7.  
1.2 Steroid Treatment  
 
Systemic steroid treatment is well known to increase the risk of serious infections such as bacterial 
sepsis and bacteremia8-11, viral disease such as CMV11-14 and EBV11,15, and invasive fungal 
infections10,11. These complications have remain ed morbidities in the HCT literature despi te modern 
infection prophylaxis8,10,11,16-19.  
 
HCT patients are highly immunocompromised , both as a result of the pre -transplant conditioning 
regimen and GVHD prophylaxis. GVHD itself is immunosup pressive16,17. To better understand the 
contribution of steroid treatment to the infectious complication rate  in current  patients , we analyzed  
the six-month  incidence  of serious infections in 79 patients from two centers ( Icahn School of 
Medicine at Mount Sinai and Ohio State University ) transplanted between 201 4-2017 [Fig 1] . 
Patients were categorized into two g roups – those who were diagnosed with GVHD that was treated 
with systemic steroid therapy (n=43) and those who did not develop GVHD and did not receive 
systemic steroid therapy 
(n=36). We analyzed rates 
of blood culture proven 
bacterial infections, viral 
reactivations requiring 
treatment (CMV and EBV), 
and proven  invasive fungal 
infection s. Patients who 
developed more than one 
infection in a category (e.g., 
multiple episodes of 
bacterial sepsis) were 
counted only once. As 
expected, systemic steroid -
treated GVHD patients 
developed significantly 
more bacterial (37% vs 
12%, p=0.009) and viral 
infections (CMV 54% vs 
28%, p=0.02; EBV 12% vs 0%, p=0.04). Interestingly, the incidence of invasive fungal infections 
was lower than published reports and not statistical ly different between the two groups, perhaps a 
result of the widespread adoption of highly effective broad spectrum anti -fungal prophylaxis10,11,18,19. 
The proportion of patients developing at least one of these life threatening bacterial, viral,  or fungal 
infections was significantly higher in the steroid exposed group (59% vs 33%, p=0.03).  

10 
  
It is important to note that children are susceptible to the same steroid related toxicities as adults 
as well as additional toxicities. Corticosteroids are  potent inhibitors of linear growth, especially 
during the adolescent growth spurt20. Likewise, the incidence of corti costeroid -related 
osteonecrosis, a debilitating skeletal complication , is highest in adolescents , presumably reflective 
of the vulnerability of rapidly growing bone21. Steroid -sparing GVHD treatments are thus e ven more 
urgently needed in the  high risk adolescent  population.  
 
1.3 GVHD Biomarker Algorithm s Risk Categorize Patients  
 
The past several years have shown remarkable advan ces in the prediction of long term outcomes 
by biomarkers22-26. The best algorithm requires only measuremen ts of ST2 and REG3α at GVHD 
diagnosis to accurately stratify patients  into three distinct “Ann Arbor” risk groups (Fig 2)27. ST2 and 
REG3α are closely associat ed with GI GVHD22,28 and increased concentrations  at GVHD diagnosis , 
(i.e. Ann Arbor 3)  predict for the deve lopment of steroid -refractory GI GVHD  while low 
concentrations (i.e., Ann Arbor 1) predict for steroid responsiveness and low rates of NRM .  
 
As noted above, clinical symptom severity at GVHD onset as determined by Minnesota risk, 
correlates with outcomes6. Patients with Minnesota standard risk GVHD, the more favorable group, 
primarily present with skin GVHD or mild GI GVHD. We hypothesized that the biomarker al gorithm 
would identify a low risk subset within this population (Fig 3).  We studied 183 patients with newly 
diagnosed GVHD from the Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC). Patients 
with both favorable clinical and biomarker features (i.e, Minnesota standard risk and Ann Arbor 1) 
had significantly lower rates of six -month NRM compared to patients with Minnesota standard risk 
but Ann Arbor 2/3 GVHD (9% vs 25%, p=0.002). This novel low risk population comprised 51% 
(94/183) of the standard ris k patients, had high response rates to syste mic steroid therapy (67% 
CR/PR), and represent s the ideal population in which to test steroid -free approaches to GVHD 
treatment.  
 
1.4 JAK-inhibition as a target for GVHD  
The JAK -STAT pathway provides promising tar gets for GVHD treatment with less potential toxicity 
than systemic corticosteroids.  
 
GVHD pathogenesis is a three step process consisting of damage to a transplant recipient’s tissue 
during conditioning which primes antigen presenting cells such as dendri tic cells, consequent donor 
T-cell activation, and subsequent T -cell mediated tissue damage to the host1. The JAK -STAT 
pathway, whose purpose is to regulate gene  expression via cytokine binding to homodimers or 
heterodimers of JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and/or TYK229, has been implicated in all three phases of 

11 
 GVHD development30. Preclinical and clinical data from studies with ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, 
provide a strong rational e to further investigate JAK inhibitors in patients with GVHD. In vivo 
JAK/STAT -signaling inhibition improved survival of mice  with GVHD , and decreased dendritic cell 
maturation, T cell activation, and chemokine -induced T cell migration to the target tissu es, liver and 
small intestine31. Biochemical studies of these mice showed decreased TNF α and IL12p70 
supporting the role of JAK1/JAK2 signaling in T cell activation and trafficking.  Additionally, 
ruxolitinib treatment  of murine GVHD  increased FoxP3+ regulatory T cells, which are important 
regulators of GVHD31,32. 
 
Ruxolitinib is associated with clinical benefit in human disease30. Zeisser et al reported that t he 
overall response rate (ORR) for patients with steroid -refractory G VHD treated with ruxolitinib  was 
81.5% (44/54)33. A similar high ORR (85.4%, 35/41) was observed in patients with steroid refractory 
chronic GVHD33. In a small pediatric study of 11 children  ages 1 to 16 years  with GVHD refractory 
to multiple lines of treatment, including steroids, the ORR was 45% (5/11)34.The primary 
complication of ruxolitinib treatment was grade 3 -4 cytopenias which developed in 18% of patients. 
High rates of ruxolitinib -related grade 3 -4 cytopenias have also been identified in patients treated 
with myelofibrosis, a JAK/STAT dependent myeloproliferative disorder35-37. These effects are likely 
mediated by JAK2 inhibition, as homodimers of JAK2 are associated with G -CSF, GM -CSF, EPO, 
and TPO signaling29. These undesirable hematologic side effects of ruxolitinib led to the 
development of a more selective JAK1 inhibitor.   
 
Itacitinib, a selective JAK1 inhibitor  
Itacitinib (INCB39110) is an oral  selective  JAK1 inhibitor  that potently inhibits JAK1 (half maximal 
inhibitory concentration, IC 50 = 3.6 nM at 1 mM adenosine triphosphate concentration), with 22 - to 
>500 -fold selectivity over the other JAK family members, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2.  It does not 
significantly inhibit (< 30% inhibition) a broad panel of approximately 60 other kinases.  Itacitinib 
potently inhibits the phosphorylation of STAT proteins and the production of proinflammatory 
factors in duced by other cytokines, such as IL -23 and IL -6 with IC 50 values of approximately 30 nM 
to 100 nM.  In contrast, itacitinib shows less inhibition in cell -based assays dependent on JAK2 with 
IC50 values of approximately 1 μM or greater, suggesting that ita citinib is JAK2 sparing in cells.  In 
in vivo  models of JAK dependent malignancy, itacitinib impedes subcutaneous tumor growth of 
INA-6 cells expressing WT JAKs when administered by continuous infusion, achieving plasma 
concentrations well below those nece ssary to inhibit JAK2.   
 
In ongoing and completed clinical pharmacology studies, itacitinib was generally safe and well -
tolerated in 284 healthy subjects, with few discontinuations. The majority of treatment -emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) were mild in se verity. There have been no clinically significant, 
unanticipated safety findings or trends observed. The main drug effect identified was a rapidly 
reversible dose -related decrease in neutrophil counts presumably caused by neutrophil 
margination; neutrophil  decreases generally resolved within 24 to 48 hours of dose discontinuation. 
Other reversible hematologic abnormalities, including decreased reticulocyte count, were observed 
after multiple -dose administration of higher dose levels at which JAK2 inhibition  was noted  (Itacinib 
investigator brochure v9, Feb 9 2017 ). In contrast to ruxolitinib, withdrawal syndrome has  not been 
observed with itacitinib.   
 
Itacitinib  has demonstrated an encouraging safety profile in clinical trials for myelofibrosis and 
psorias is. Mascarenhas et al. reported that itacitinib, administered at 100  mg BID, 200  mg BID, or 
600 mg daily decreased the symptom burden of myelofibrosis patients38. At the highest dose levels, 
only one patient (3.1%) experienced grade 4 thrombocytopenia, no patient experienced grade 3 -4 
neutropenia, and 25% patients developed grade 3 anemia. The r ate of grade 3 -4 neutropenia, 
anemia, and thrombocytopenia decrea sed with increased  itacitinib dose, suggesting that 
cytopenias were a consequence of the myelofibrosis rather than the drug. Likewise, n o significant 
hematologic toxicity was noted in a phase II trial of itacitinib for psoriasis39. Non -hematologic 
toxicities were generally grade 1 -2.  
 
12 
 In total, 777 subjects have been exposed to itacitinib across all clinical trials. Serious adverse 
effects have been infreque nt. Expected serious adverse events include anemia (2.4%), fever (1%), 
and urinary tract infection (1%). When all clinical experiences are taken together itacitinib has a 
favorable safety profile.  
 
Itacitinib for the treatment of acute GVHD  
Thirty -one subj ects have received itacitinib in combination with high dose steroids for the treatment 
of moderate to severe acute GVHD in a randomized, phase I trial . Patients had either newly 
diagnosed (n=17) or steroid -refractory (n=14)  GVHD  when randomized to either 2 00 mg daily or 
300 mg daily of itacitinib.  The overall response rate as a first line therapy for GVHD was 83.3% and 
64.7% in the steroid refractory cohort40. The most common adverse events were thrombocytopenia 
(26.7%), diarrhea (23.3%), peripheral edema (20%), fatigue (16.7%) and hyperglycemia (16 .7%), 
all of which are more likely related to the underlying GVHD and/or concurrent use of high dose 
steroids  than to itacitinib because  these events were not observed in other itacitinib trials. The 
incidence of infections was not higher than expected. Th ere were three CMV infections and three 
cases of sepsis out of 31 patients. GI bleeding, a symptom of severe GI tract GVHD, was observed 
in three patients. These preliminary data demonstrate both a promising efficacy signal  and a good 
safety profile  for itacitinib for the treatment of acute GVHD.   
 
Itacitinib dosing  
In the phase I aGVHD trial, the pharmacokinetics of itacitinib were evaluated using plasma samples 
collected pre -dose and on days 1 and 7 at 1 hour, 2 hours, and 4 to 8 hours post -dose.  Althou gh 
inter-subject variability was found to be high, PK exposure (C max and AUC) was consistent with 
historical data, and a large overlap in steady -state exposure was observed between the 200 mg 
and 300 mg cohorts.  Given the similarities in PK and efficacy b etween dose groups, and the 
increased likelihood of unwanted JAK2 inhibition at higher doses, itacitinib at  200 mg  daily h as 
been identified as  the recommended dose for future GVHD studies.  
1.5 Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC)  
MAGIC, a collaboration of 23 international HCT centers in the United States, Canada, Germany, 
Italy, and Thailand, was formed in 2013 for the purposes of conducting innovative translational 
clinical trials in GVHD. Because GVHD grading can be inconsistent among cen ters41, MAGIC 
centers follow standardized GVHD staging and grading guidance42 whose use is reinforced by 
monthly webinars and remote data audits conducted by the MAGIC Data Coordinating Center 
(DCC) in New York. All MAGIC centers participate in an observational trial of prospective data and 
research sample collection a nd as a result collection of research samples at GVHD diagnosis is 
very high (85%). MAGIC centers in the US are already highly experienced in enrolling patients on 
GVHD biomarker guided treatment trials. For example, US centers have submitted  screening  
samples from more than 300 patients to the CLIA -certified Mount Sinai GVHD laboratory for real 
time Ann Arbor scor ing since 2016. Conduct of  this low risk GVHD trial through MAGIC will leverage 
an existing infrastructure with substantial experience in success ful conduct of similar trials.  
1.6 Correlative Studies  
Serial serum biomarkers. GVHD biomarkers are prognostic early after HCT, at diagnosis, and 
during treatment23,26,27, but the relationship between changes in GVHD biomarker concentrations 
measured serially over time and outcomes is not yet well understood.  We will collect four weekly 
samples from patients on this study and correlate changes in biomarkers with long term outcomes.  
We expect that GVHD biomarkers will remain low in study patients who respond to itacitinib 
treatment, but will rise in non -responders . 
1.7 Summary of Study Rationale  
 
Standard treatment for GVHD involves high doses of steroids which are highly toxic. The MAGIC 
algorithm identifies the low risk patients most likely to benefit from a steroid -free GVHD treatment 
approach. Itacitinib at a 200 m g/day dose has been shown t o be safe with few side effects and 
13 
 phase I data in patients with GVHD showed encouraging efficacy. In this study, patients with low 
risk GVHD will receive itacitinib monotherapy as first line treatment. Patients will be carefull y 
moni tored for efficacy and toxicity and t he salvage rate with steroids for patients who do not respond 
to primary therapy with itacitinib will also be closely monitored. The use of  objective laboratory 
measures in addition to  clinical symptoms has the po tential to transform GVHD therapy and 
represents a key step towards a precision medicine approach for GVHD. This phase II study will 
develop the data required for a definitive randomized phase III trial comparing itacitinib to steroid 
treatment for low ris k GVHD.  
2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary Objectives  
 
2.1.1  To determine the effectiveness of  itacitinib monotherapy  as primary treatment of 
newly diagnosed, low -risk acute GVHD defined by standard risk clinical criteria 
(Minnesota) and low risk biomarkers  (Ann Arb or 1). 
2.2 Secondary Objectives   
2.2.1  To assess the safety of itacitinib  monotherapy in these patients.  
2.2.2  To determine the incidence of serious infectious complications in patients with 
GVHD treated with itacitinib  
2.2.3  To determine the incidence of  steroid refractory GVHD in patients whose GVHD 
is not responsive to itacitinib  
2.3 Primary Endpoint  
 
Proportion of patients who achieve CR or PR by day 28 of treatment with itacitinib 
without the addition of any other systemic GVHD treatment including steroids.  
 
CR is defined as a bsence of GVHD symptoms. PR is defined as improvement in one 
or more organs involved with GVHD symptoms without progression in other  organ s. 
For a response to be scored as CR or PR on day 28, the patient must be in CR or PR 
on day 28 and have had no interv ening systemic therapy for acute GVHD other than 
itacitinib.  
 
Secondary endpoints : 
 
1. Cumulative incidence of steroid -refractory GVHD (defined as GVHD that worsens 
(increase by one or more grade) after 3 days, or fails to respond to treatment within 
7 days ( for GVHD grade III) or 14 days (for GVHD grade II)  or 2nd line therapy 
beyond systemic steroid treatment is begun within 28 days of starting steroids.  
2. Distribution of m aximal GVHD  grade (I -IV) by day 28 after starting treatment with 
itacitinib  
3. Cumulative i ncidence of serious infections (defined as bacteremia, CMV infection 
needing treatment, EBV infection needing treatment, or invasive fungal infection)  
4. Overall survival at 6 and 12 months  
5. Cumulative incidence of NRM at 6 and 12 months  
6. Relapse rate at 6 and 12 months  
7. Cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD  requiring systemic steroid treatment  by one 
year from enrollment  
14 
 8. Cumulative steroid dose (over 4 weeks) in patients who receive steroids as second 
line therapy  
 
Safety endpoints  
 
1. Number and proportion of pat ients developing reportable AE s and SAEs according to 
relatedness to study drug and stratified by severity  
 
Exploratory endpoints  
 
1. GVHD biomarker  concentrations (ST2 and REG3)  and their associations with clinical 
endpoints  at day 28 after starting treatmen t with itacitinib  
 
The two hypotheses are: 1) that GVHD biomarkers will remain low in study patients 
who respond to itacitinib treatment, but will rise in non -responders and (2) biomarker 
concentrations will be equivalent to those in historical control pat ients who respond to 
steroid treatment for low risk GVHD.

4.0 SUBJECT SCREENING AND REGISTRATION PROCEDURE S 
 
Study Schema  
 
To be eligible for this study, patients must have newly diagnosed low risk acute GVHD defined as 
Minnesota standard risk based on symptoms and Ann Arbor 1 GVHD based on biomarkers  (see 
Appendix  A). Patients will be recruited from centers participating in the Mount Sinai Acute GVHD 
International Consortium (MAGIC) where the procedures for obtaining scr eening samples for 
biomarker scoring are already established.  
 
The pre -screening process is outlined in Figure 4 above . Consented patients will be registered into 
the remote data entry system using a unique study number assigned by the MAGIC DCC . Five m L 
of serum will be collected from patients after GVHD has been diagnosed and before any systemic 

16 
 treatment has begun  and sh ipped priority overnight to the Mount Sinai GVHD laboratory for early 
AM arrival ( see MAGIC Sample Collection and Storage manual for sh ipping procedures ). 
Samples can be received Tuesday through Saturday. Once received in the laboratory, the GVHD 
biomarkers used to assign the Ann Arbor  GVHD risk score will be measured by ELISA using 
standard technical procedures. Processing, measuring, an d confirming the ELISA assay results 
take 4.5 hours (range 4 -6 hours). Once the Ann Arbor  GVHD risk score is confirmed by Dr. Ferrara 
(or Dr. Levine in Dr. Ferrara’s absence), the investigator at the participating center will be notified 
of the score by te lephone and written confirmation  by email . 
 
Patients who meet eligibility criteria will begin treatment with the study drug, itacitinib. Patients who 
do not meet eligibility criteria will be considered screen failures and treated according to local 
institu tional practice.  
 
Patient registration for this trial will be centrally managed by the MAGIC Data Coordinating Center  
of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai  as described below:  
 
A potential study subject who has been screened for the trial and who has signed the Informed 
Consent document will be initially documented by the participating site on the Screening and 
Enrollment Log provided  by the MAGIC Data Coordinating Center  (DCC).  
 
It is the responsibility of the local site investigator to confirm patient  eligibility for the clinical trial . 
Confirmation of a high MAGIC  GVHD risk score will be provided directly to the identified Primary 
Site contact from the participating site by Dr. Ferrara, Dr. Levine or designee. All other eligibility 
criteria will  be provided by the participating site.  After patient eligibility has been determined, a copy 
of the completed  Eligibility form will be submitted by the requesting site to the MAGIC Data 
Coordinating Center  by email to magic@mssm.edu  with local site investigator signature and 
supporting source documentation.  
 
The MAGIC Coordinator , who acts as the registrar, will review the submitted documents and 
process the registration. An email will be sent by the registrar to the r equesting site registrar to 
confirm patient registration . Patients found to be ineligible for participation after being consented 
will be considered screen failures, and documented as such in the Screening and Enrollment Log. 
These patients will not receiv e study treatment.  
5.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
5.1 Treatment Dosage and Administration  
5.1.1  Protocol treatment must start within 4 days of confirmation of Ann Arbor 1 GVHD 
risk score. For example, a patient who is diagnosed with GVHD skin stage 3 
(Minnesota standard risk GVHD) on day 21 post -HCT, is consented on a Monday 
and has a research sample shipped to the Ferrara Lab that day, will have their 
GVHD risk score assigned on Tuesday (day 22). Such a patient must begin study 
treatment no later than Friday (day 25).  
5.1.2  Itacitinib w ill be supplied by Incyte. Each participating site will have a sufficient 
supply of itacitinib on hand to begin treatment. Additional doses will be shipped to 
the participating site to complete treatment.  See section 9.1 for preparation, 
dispensing, and a dministration information.  
 
17 
 5.1.3  Study treatment will consist of itacitinib  200 mg administered orally  daily for a 28 
day induction cycle followed by a 28 day maintenance cycle.  
5.1.4  Missed doses will be made by extending the schedule until all 28 doses (or 56 
doses  in responding patients) have been administered  or ten weeks from first 
dose, whichever comes first . 
5.1.5  Subjects who miss more than five consecutive doses  of the first 28 doses due to 
noncompliance  will be analyzed for safety but considered inevaluable for ef ficacy 
assessment and replaced.  
5.1.6  GVHD Prophylaxis Medications  
Medications given for GVHD prophylaxis such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, 
sirolimus, methotrexate, mycophenolate should be continued at therapeutic doses 
(according to institutional standards) and adjusted as necessary for renal, central 
nervous system (CNS) or other toxicity using institutional  guidelines.  This study 
allows for changes in GVHD prophylaxis medication (e.g., replacement of 
cyclosporine with sirolimus for management of posterior rev ersible 
encephalopathy syndrome [PRES] ) as per institutional standards. GVHD 
prophylaxis medications will be tapered according to local institutional tapering 
practices.  
5.1.7  GVHD treatment  
The preliminary data for this study were generated from patients transp lanted at 
multiple centers with heterogeneous GVHD treatment practices. In order to 
develop “real world” experience in this study, institutional GVHD treatment 
practices are permitted  unless their use is explicitly prohibited .  
 
Systemic steroid treatment should be started i f any of the following criteria are met:  
GVHD worsens (increase by one or more grade) after 3 days, or failure to respond 
to treatment within 7 days (for GVHD grade III) or 14 days (for GVHD grade II). 
The decision to remove a patient fr om study treatment should be discussed with 
the site PI. Itacitinib must be stopped when systemic steroid treatment is begun. 
When  systemic steroid treatment is initiated, the  minimum  starting dose is 
prednisone (or other steroid form equivalent ) 1 mg/kg/d ay for GVHD that involves 
only the skin and/or upper GI tract and 2 mg/kg/d for GVHD that involves the lower 
GI tract and/or liver.  Institutional practices  can be followed for steroid tapering 
schedules . 
 
 
5.1.8  Ancillary therapies  
Ancillary/supportive care meas ures for acute GVHD such as the use of anti -motility 
agents for diarrhea, including octreotide, is allowed at the discretion of the treating 
physician.  Use of ursodiol to prevent/reduce gall bladder sludging or prevent 
hepatic transplant -related  complicat ions is allowed according to institutional 
guidelines  
5.1.9  Supportive Care Guidelines  
All patients should receive the following:  
 
 Transfusion support per institutional practice  
 Anti-infective prophylaxis against herpes virus is required but otherwise 
institutio nal practice can be followed.  
 Anti-infective prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci , bacterial and 
18 
 fungal infections according to standard institutional guidelines.  
 Pre-emptive monitoring and treatment for CMV  and EBV  infections is 
required  but otherwis e institutional practice can be followed.  
5.2 Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications  
Any patient who receives treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity . Each 
patient will be assessed for the development of toxicity ac cording to the Tim e and Events 
Table ( Section 6.4 ). Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI Common Terminology  
Crite ria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0.  
 
The dose of itacitinib  will not be modified. In the event of a SAE causally related to study 
drug, itacitinib should be discontinued and the patient will be included in all analyses of 
safety and efficacy.  Up to five doses of itacitinib may be held at investigator discretion for 
nausea , difficulty swallowing , or other complications  unrelated to itacitinib  and then 
restarted.  
5.3 Concomitant Medications/Treatments  
Concomitant use of other investigational agents is not permitted during the treatment phase 
of the study  without PI approval .   
 
Coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (itraconazole) increased it acitinib exposure 
inhealthy subjects by a pproximately 5 -fold. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A  inhibitors 
should be avoided if clinically feasible. If coadministration of itacitinib with a strong  CYP3A 
inhibitor cannot be avoided, use of an agent with less CYP3A4 inhibition in a class, for  
example, posaconazole for fungal infection, or prophylaxis is recommended over other 
choices  like voriconazole or itraconazole. Careful monitoring of hematology parameters 
and clinical  signs and symptoms of itacitinib -related adverse reactions is recommended 
upon initiation of a  strong CYP3A4 inhibitor.  
 
Subjects receiving itacitinib should avoid pomegranates or pomegranate juice, grapefruit 
and grapefruit juice, all of which are known to inhibit cytochrome CYP3A enzymes an d may  
increase the exposure to itacitinib . 
 
Coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin) decreased the plasma exposure 
of itacitinib in health y subjects by approximately 80% . Concomitant use of  strong CYP3A 
inducers (such as, but not limited to, phenytoin, rifampin, carbamazepine, and St  John's 
Wort (Hypericum perforatum) should be avoided.  
5.4 Other Modalities or Procedures  
Patients who have undergone allogeneic HCT are often simultaneously being treated for 
other conditions and transplant -relate d complications. Such treatments will be considered 
distinct  from the study drug treatment . 
5.5 Duration of Therapy  
The duration of protocol therapy on this study is eight weeks  (56 doses ). Protocol therapy 
will end after the 56th dose of itactinib  has been admini stered or if any of the following 
criteria apply:  
 
 Systemic steroid treatment (or any other systemic treatment) for GVHD is 
initiated OR 
 Patient voluntarily withdraws from treatment OR 
 General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patie nt 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  OR 
 Ten weeks has elapsed since the first dose of itacitinib  
19 
 5.6 Off Treatment Criteria  
Patients will be removed from receiving the investigational drug  when any of the criteria 
listed i n Section 5.5 apply . The reason for ending investigational drug therapy and the date 
the patient was removed  from treatment  will be documented in the study record . All patients 
who discontinue treatment should comply with protocol specific follow -up proced ures as 
outlined in Section 5.7 . The only exception to this requirement is when a subject withdraws 
consent for all study procedures  or dies . 
5.7 Duration of Follow -Up 
Patients will be followed until 1 year  post-enrollment , withdrawal of consent  or until death , 
whichever occurs first.  HCT patients are followed closely and frequent clinical evaluations 
are the norm. While t he following outlines the minimum  frequency of follow -up evaluations , 
it is anticipated that the majority of patients will be evaluated more frequently .  
 
During the  first 4 weeks of participation (i.e., through the last dose of the first cycle of 
itactinib ), patients will be seen at least  weekly for assessment of their GVHD . During the 
second four weeks  (i.e., the maintenance cycle of itacitin ib), patients should be seen at 
least every other week, although it is anticipated that most patients will be seen more 
frequently, i.e., weekly. Patients will be evaluated at least at three, six and twelve month s 
from treatment initiation .  
5.8 Off Study Crit eria 
Patients can be taken off study at any time at their own request, or they may be 
withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral , or 
administrative reasons. The reason(s) for discontinuation from study will be 
documented and may  include:  
5.8.1  Patient withdraws consent (termination of treatment and follow -up); 
5.8.2  Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntary 
incarceration for treatment;  
5.8.3  Patient  is unable to comply with protocol requirements;  
5.8.4  The subject ha s any disorder or condition that in the investigator's judgment may 
impede the participant's participation in the study, pose increased risk to the 
participant, or confound the results of the study  
5.8.5  Patient becomes pregnant (pregnancy to be reported along s ame timelines as a 
serious adverse event);  
5.8.6  Termination of the study ; 
5.8.7  Patient completes protocol treatment and follow -up criteria.  
 
 Discontinuation of study treatment (such as subsequent to starting systemic steroids)  does 
not remove the patient from other  aspects of study participation including providing follow -
up data. P articipants will be encouraged to provide this information whether or not they 
complete the anticipated course of study treatment.  
5.9 Patient Replacement  
Patients who enroll in the study but  do not receive any study treatment will be replaced. 
Patients who initiate study treatment but miss more than five consecutive doses  of the first 
20 
 28 doses for reason s other than toxicity will also be replaced. The number of patients and 
reason(s) for repl acement will  be recorded and will be used to assess the feasibility of the 
study design.  This study will allow up to 20% of patients who start treatment (n=14) to be 
replaced.  
6.0 STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 Screening/Baseline Procedures  
Assessments performed exclusively  to determine eligibility for this study will be done only 
after obtaining informed consent. Assessments performed for clinical indications (not 
exclusively to determine study eligibility) may be used for baseline values even if the 
studies were done befor e informed consent was obtained.  Frequent monitoring of clinical 
chemistry and hematology is routine in HCT patients. This study does not require specific 
laboratory monitoring other than specified below.  
6.1.1  Informed Consent   
6.1.2  Demographics  
6.1.3  Review subject eligi bility criteria  
6.1.4  Review concomitant medications  (immunosuppressants and GVHD prophylaxis 
medications only)  
6.1.5  Adverse event assessment  
Baseline adverse events will be assessed  and preexisting conditions will be 
recorded . See Section 8 .0 for Adverse Event monit oring and reporting.  
6.1.6  Serum chemistries  (within 3 days prior to enrollment)  
ALT/SGPT, AST/S GOT,  and total bilirubin  are required for assessment of exclusion 
criteria  within 3 days prior to enrollment . 
6.2 Follow -Up Procedures  
The following outlines the minimum  frequency of follow -up evaluations, it is anticipated that 
the majority of patients will be evaluated more frequently.  
 
During the first 4 weeks of participation (i.e., through the primary endpoint ), patients will be 
seen at least weekly for assessment of  their GVHD. During the second four weeks patients 
should be seen at least every other week, although it is anticipated that most patients will 
be seen more frequently, i.e., weekly. Patients will also be evaluated at study day 86 (30 
days  from completion of treatment). In addition, relapse, survival, and chronic GVHD will 
be reported  at six and twelve months from treatment initiation.  
 
Infections, as defined in sections 7.2.3 to 7.2.5 will be closely monitored on this study. In 
our preliminary data (sectio n 1.2), 100% of CMV infections requiring treatment developed 
within 90 days  from starting systemic GVHD treatment, 100% of EBV infections requiring 
treatment, 85% of bacteremia, and 75% of invasive fungal infections.  All patients who 
developed at least one  serious infection did so within 90 days.  Given these data, we will 
monitor for serious infections from start of itacitinib treatment through study day 90.

Partial Response (PR) : An improvement in one or more organ involved with GVHD 
symptoms without worsening in others. For a resp onse to be scored as PR on day 
23 
 28, the patient must be in PR on that day and have had no intervening additional 
GVHD therapy.  
 
No response (NR) : All responses that are not CR or PR. Patients who receive any  
systemic  GVHD therapy other than the continuation  or modification of GVHD 
prophylaxis, systemic steroid s, and topical/ non-absorbable oral steroid therapy, 
will be scored as NR on day 28 regardless of organ staging.   
7.1.2  Proportion of CR and CR+PR  
CR and PR on day 28 are  scored  in comparison to the patient’s acute GVHD 
staging on the day itacitinib  treatment began.  
7.1.3  Steroid  refractory GVHD  
The first salvage therapy for patients who are not responding to itacitinib is 
systemic steroid treatment.   Patients treated with systemic steroids whose G VHD 
worsens (increa se by one or more grade) after 3 days, or fails to respond to 
treatment within 7 days (for GVHD grade III) or 14 days (for GVHD grade II)  or 
who start additional lines of therapy beyond systemic steroid treatment within 28 
days of starting steroids will be  considered steroid refractory.  Escalation of steroid 
doses during treatment for GVHD are not considered in the definition of steroid 
refractory GVHD.  
7.1.4  Steroid discontinuation  
For patients who initiate systemic steroid treatment for GVHD, t he date of 
discon tinuation of steroid therapy will be recorded.  
7.1.5  Lines of GVHD therapy  
The initiation of s ystemic steroids  for treatment of GVHD will be considered second 
line therapy. Any additional systemic immunosuppression treatment to steroid 
therapy for acute GVHD wil l be considered 3rd line therapy and considered a  failure 
to respond to steroid  treatment . Resumption or changes in GVHD prophylaxis  
(e.g., substitution of mycophenolate for tacrolimus due to PRES)  are not 
considered new lines of therapy.  Topical steroids and non -absorbable oral steroids 
are not considered new lines of therapy.  
7.1.6  Non-Relapse Mortality (NRM)  
Any death that occurs after HCT not attributable to relapse of the underlying 
disease will be considered a non -relapse death.  
7.1.7  Chronic GVHD  
The occurrence of chronic GVHD  as defined by NIH consensus criteria requiring 
systemic treatment , including date of diagnosis, will be recorded.  
7.1.8  Relapse  
Relapse , including date of relapse,  of the underlying malignancy will be recorded.  
7.2 SAFETY/TOXICITY DEFINITIONS  
7.2.1  Itacit inib monotherapy was generally safe and well tolerated in clinical studies of 
777 adult s including healthy subjects and patients with psoriasis or myelofibrosis  
(Itacitinib investigator brochure v9, Feb 9 2017 ). There were no non -hematologic 
adverse events  that occurred in >1% of subjects. Hematologic adverse events 
grade 3 or 4 included decreased hemoglobin (12.4%), decreased platelet count 
(9.1%) and decreased neutrophil count (1.4%) of patients. These hematologic 
24 
 adverse events were most common in patien ts with myelofibrosis and improved  
with higher doses of itacitinib38 suggesting they were more likely due to the 
underlying disease than itacitinib. There w ere no toxicities observed in a study of 
itacitinib plus steroids  in patients with acute GVHD that were felt to be related to 
itacitinib  administration. Known or plausible  toxicities that may be related to 
itacitinib  will be reported .  
7.2.2  Hematologic Toxiciti es 
Hematologic toxicities will be graded according to CTCAE v4 criteria.  
7.2.3  Infectious Toxicities  
Infections , including serious and/or life -threatening infections,  are common in 
patients who undergo  HCT. MAGIC clinical trial practice  requires the reporting of  
any life -threatening infection a s defined by the Blood and Marrow Transplant 
Clinical Trials Network  grade 3  (see Appendix B for further details) .  
 
Grade 3 Bacterial Infections:  
a. Bacteremia with deep organ involvement  
b. Severe sepsis with bacteremia  
c. Fasciitis requiring debridement  
d. Pneumonia requiring intubation  
e. Brain abscess or meningitis without bacteremia  
f. Clostridium difficile toxin positive stool with toxic dilatation or renal 
insufficiency with/without diarrhea.  
 
Grade 3 Fungal Infectio ns: 
a. Fungemia, including candidemia  
b. Proven or probable invasive fungal infections (e.g. Aspergillus, Mucor, 
Fusarium, Scedosporium)  
c. Disseminated fungal infections  (e.g. multifocal pneumonia, presence of 
urinary/blood antigen, CNS involvement) with Histoplasmosis, 
Blastomycosis, Coccidiomycosis or Cryptomycosis  
d. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia   
 
Grade 3 Viral Infections:  
a. Severe VZV infection with either associated coagulopathy or organ 
involvement  
b. CMV end organ involvement  (e.g. pneumonitis, enteritis, retinitis)  
c. EBV Post -transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD)  
d. Adenovirus with end organ involvement (except adenoviral conjunctivitis 
or upper respiratory tract disease)  
e. All lower respiratory tract viruses  
f.  Viral encephalitis or  meningitis  
 
Grade 3 parasitic infections:  
a. Toxoplasmosis involving the CNS  
b. Strongyloides hyperinfection  
 
Non-microbiologically documented infections:  
a. Any acute pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation  
b. Severe sepsis without an identified organism  
 
In addi tion, the following non -BMT CTN infections will be reported: bacteremia 
requiring systemic antibiotics and CMV and EBV reactivation requiring treatment.  
25 
 7.2.4  Bacteremia  
The dat e, identification, and treatment of bacteremia requiring systemic antibiotic 
therapy will be reported.  
7.2.5  Viral Reactivations  
Because viral reactivations often require treatment in the HCT population, even in 
the absence of end organ disease, the following viral infections/reactivations and 
their treatment, if any, will be reported:  
 
The date , anatomical site or body fluid (e.g., blood, nasopharyngeal swab, stool, 
etc.), and method of detection for CMV, EBV, HHV6, VZV, HSV and adenovirus  
will be reported . 
7.3 Safety/T olerability  
  Analyses will be performed for all patients having received at leas t one dose of study drug. 
The study will use the CTCAE version 4.0 for reporting of adverse events 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html ). 
7.4 Children as a Special Population  
  
 This study will enroll minor subjects  age 12 -17 years. It is important to include children in 
this clinical trial for GVHD because children are not only susceptible to the same risks from 
standard care with systemic steroids as adults but are particularly at risk for permanent 
skeletal damage20,21. Although itacitinib has not been studied in children, the JAK inhibitor 
ruxolitinib has been used therap eutically in children as a treatment for GVHD34 and as 
monotherapy in a phase I trial of 49 children with refractory cancer43. The side effect profile 
was the same as in adults with no unexpected toxicities. Ruxolitinib is considered safe for 
use in children based on the phase I trial  and experience with this agent in c hildren 
continues to grow44,45. Itacitinib has not yet been tested in children but we do not expect 
children to experience different toxicities than adults. In the interest of subject safety we 
will closely monitor the efficacy and toxicity of itacitinib in patients under the age of 18 years 
and, in the event of any unexpected toxicities or lack of efficacy,  accrual to children will be 
halted (see section 12.0).  
8.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.1 Itacitinib  
For the most recent safety update, please refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure or 
Study Agent Prescribing Information . 
8.1.1  Contraindications  
  Patients who have had a n allergic  reaction to itacitinib  or any other JAK inhibitor . 
8.1.2  Special Warnings and Precautions for Use : none  
8.2 Adverse Event  Reporting Requirements  
Adverse event  (AE) monitoring and reporting  is a routine  part of every clinical trial  and is 
done  to ensure th e safety of subjects enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll 
in future studies using similar agents . Data on adverse events will be collected from the 
time of the initial study treatment (day 0) through 30 days after the last dose of itacitinib. 
Any serious adverse event that occurs more than 30 days after the last dose  of itacitinib 
that is considered related to the study treatment must also be reported. Serious Adverse 
Events (SAEs) will continue to be followed until : 
26 
  Resolution or the sy mptoms or signs that constitute the serious adverse event 
return to baseline;  
 There is satisfactory explanation other than the study  treatment for the changes 
observed; or  
 Death.  
The investigator is responsible for the detection, docume ntation, grading an d assignment 
of attribution of events meeting the criteria a nd definition of an AE or SAE. The definitions 
of AEs and SAEs are given below . It is the responsibility of the principal investigator to 
ensure that all staff involved in the trial is familiar wi th the content of this section.  
Any medical condition or laboratory abnormality with an onset date before initial  study 
treatment administration  is considered to be pre -existing in nature . Any known pre -existing 
conditions that are ongoing at time of study  entry should be considered medical history.  
All events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE (CTCAE grade 3 or higher) or SAE , 
as defined in Section 8.3,  occurring from the initial study treatment administration through 
30 days following the last d ose of the study treatment or study intervention must be 
recorded as an adverse event in the patient’s source documents and on the CRF .  
8.3 Definitions  
8.3.1  Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient receiving 
study treatme nt and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of an experimental interve ntion, whether or not related to the intervention.  
 
 Diagnostic and therapeutic non -invasive and invasive (i.e. , surgical) 
procedures will not be reported as adverse events . However, the medical 
condition for which the procedure was performed must be repor ted if it meets 
the definition of an adverse event unless it is a pre -existing (prior to protocol 
treatment) condition.  
 
 Event reporting for GVHD treatment protocols can be complicated and 
confusing for investigators, data managers, and regulatory oversigh t bodies 
because patients typically develop numerous complications as part of the 
typical treatment course not related to study therapy. Furthermore, transplant -
related complications often occur both simultaneously and in series, as one 
complication leads to a series of downstream events. Therefore, a well -
conceived event reporting plan separates background transplant and GVHD 
noise as might be seen with any transplant where GVHD develops from study 
related events that are relevant to patient safety. On thi s study , we will not 
report any CTCAE grade 1 and 2 adverse events (which make up the majority 
of events) unless the investigator determines the event should be reported to 
protect subject safety.  
 
 It is common for HCT recipients to experience multiple com plications as part 
of the transplant itself that are unrelated to exposure to investigational agents. 
Symptoms of the original or targeted disease are not to be considere d adverse 
events for this study  except for hematological toxicities as defined below. From 
start of study treatment through 30 days from last dose of itacitinib, s ymptoms 
related to the conditioning regimen or GVHD will not be reported unle ss the 
event is  both serious (see section  8.3.2) and considered by the investigator to  
27 
 also be possibl y, probably, or definitely related to itacitinib . After 30 days from 
the last dose of itacitinib, adverse events should only be reported if they are 
both serious and probably or definitely related to itacitinib. Events that are 
unlikely or unrelated to itacitinib  are not required to be  reported. Reporting of 
such events should include the investigator’s assessment as to whether the 
event should be attributed to any of the HCT procedure itself, GVHD, exposure 
to immunosuppressive agents other than itacitinib , and itacitinib . An event may 
be attributable to all, some, or one of these categories.  
 
 Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events  only if 
they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require therapy  and otherwise meet 
the criteri a for a reportable adverse event as defined above . They are to be 
captured under the signs, symptoms or diagnoses associated with them.  
8.3.2  Serious Adverse Event  
An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in the view of the investigator , it results 
in any of  the following outcomes:  
  
o Death  
If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease should be 
reported as event (SAE) itself.  
 
o A life -threatening adverse event  
An adverse event  is considered ‘life -threatening’ if, in the view of either the 
investigator, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death . It does not include an adverse event that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
 
o Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitali zation  for ≥24 
hours.  
 
o A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
 
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
o Important medical event  
Any event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require  hospitalization 
may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition of “Serious Adverse Event”. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospitalization or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
 
As additional gui dance, p reviously planned (prior to signing the informed consent 
form) surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical 
condition has worsened during the course of the study  and the definitions in section 
8.3.1 are met . Preplanned hos pitalizations or procedures for preexisting conditions 
that are already recorded in the patient’s medical history at the time of study 
enrollment should also not be considered SAEs. Hospitalization or prolongation of 
hospitalization without a precipitating  clinical AE (for example, for the 
administration of study therapy or other protocol -required procedure) should not 
be considered SAEs. However, if the preexisting condition worsened during the 
28 
 course of the study,  and the reporting requirements in section  8.3.1 are also met,  
it should be reported as an SAE.  
 
8.3.3  Expected Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “expected” if:  
 For approved and marketed drugs or devices, those adverse events  are 
described in the approved Package Insert (Label).  
 For in vestigational new drugs or devices, those adverse events are 
described in the FDA Investigator’s Brochure.  
 In clinical research studies, information on expected adverse events is 
also summarized in the protocol and in the consent document .  See 
section 9. 1 for the list of expected adverse events related to the drug under 
study.  
8.3.4  Unexpected Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “unexpected” if it is not described in the 
Package Insert, Investigator’s Brochure, in published medical literature, in the 
protocol, or in the informed consent document.  
8.4 Adverse Event  Characteristics  
8.4.1  CTCAE T erm 
(AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4. 0 will be 
utilize d for AE reporting . All appropriate treatment areas should  have access to a 
copy of the CTCAE version  4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4. 0 can be down 
loaded from the CTEP web site . (http://ctep.cancer.gov ) 
8.4.2  Attributio n of the AE  
The investigator or co -investigator is responsible for assignment of attribution.  
Definite  – The AE is clearly related  to the study  treatment.  
Probable  – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
Possible – The AE may be related  to the s tudy treatment.  
Unlikely  – The AE is doubtfully related  to the study treatment.  
Unrelated  – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment . 
8.5 Serious Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines

8.5.2  The Princ ipal Investigator must be notified within 3 business day of study team’s 
knowledge of any event meeting the criteria and definition of a serious adverse 
event, regardless of attribution, occurring during the study or within 30 days of the 
last administrati on of the itacitinib .  Incyte  should be notified  by the PI  within 24 
hours  to enable reporting to regulatory authorities as required.  
8.5.3  The investigator must report all events meeting the criteria and definition of a 
serious adverse event that are unexpected  and possibly related  (definite, probable 
or possible to study treatment administration ) to the local IRB as per local IRB 
policy .  
8.5.4  All Serious Adverse Events will be reported using the Serious Adverse Event form 
within 3 days of first awareness of the eve nt to the MAGIC Data Coordinating 
Center. A copy of the form should be sent to the MAGIC Coordinator via email to 
magic@mssm.edu . 
 
The MAGIC Data Coordinating Center will disseminate information regarding 
serious adver se events to the participating sites within 3 days of review of the 
information by Dr. Levine if the event(s) is believed to be related (i.e. probably or 
definitely) to the study medication. All other Serious Adverse Events will be 
discussed on monthly web inars held with all participating centers (see section 12).  
 
The Principal Investigator will be responsible for reporting of events to the FDA 
and supporters, as appropriate and defined in the regulations under 21 CFR 
312.32.  
8.5.5  SAE/Pregnancy Reporting to Inc yte: 
 
Initial Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and/or subsequent follow -up reports will be 
reported  to Incyte  via email to: SafetyReporting@Incyte.com , fax (+) 1 -866-981-
2057 .  SAE reports should be for a sing le subject with any additional documents 
(i.e. discharge summary, relevant test results) included for the same subject as 
individual attachments to the email. One email can have multiple attachments as 
30 
 long as each attachment contains relevant information for the same subject.  
Please email your SAE form with a cover sheet and any additional 
attachments to the IST email address: SafetyReporting@Incyte.com , fax (+) 
1-866-981-2057  
 
Reporting pregnancies to Incy te 
An “Initial Pregnancy Report” or equivalent must be completed in full and emailed 
to SafetyReporting@Incyte.com , fax (+) 1 -866-981-2057  within 24 hrs of discovery 
of a pregnancy of a subject who has take n itacitinib  or the pregnancy of a partner 
for a subject who has taken itacitinib .  The “Follow -up Pregnancy Report Form” or 
equivalent must be completed and emailed to SafetyReporting@Incyte.com , fax 
(+) 1 -866-981-2057  within 30 days after delivery, so that Incyte is provided with 
information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy.  If the pregnancy results in 
any events which meet the serious criteria (i.e., miscarriage or termination), the 
SAE reporting p rocess needs to be followed and the timelines associated with an 
SAE should be followed  
8.6 Reporting of Unanticipated Problems  
Upon becoming aware of any incident, experience, or outcome (not related to an adverse 
event) that may represent an unanticipated pr oblem  involving risks to subjects or others , 
the investigator should assess whether the incident, experience, or outcome represents an 
unanticipated problem . The incident, experience or outcomes are considered unanticipated 
if it meets all of the following  criteria:  
1. Unexpected ( not previously documented in terms of nature, severity, or frequency);  
2. Causally related or possibly related to participation in the study ; and  
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm than 
was pr eviously known or recognized.  
If the investigator determines that the incident, experience, or outcome represents an 
unanticipated problem, the investigator must report it to the MAGIC Data Coordinating 
Center  within 3 days of first awareness of the events , and to the local IRB as per local IRB 
policy . 
8.7 Stopping Rules  
We will monitor the study subjects for both efficacy and toxicity. We will allow continuous 
accrual on to the study unless a stopping rule is met or the target accrual is reached. The 
study may  also be stopped based on the recommendation of the investigators, the TCI 
DSMC, or at Incyte’s discretion for any reason.  
 
Steroid -refractory GVHD:  
We expect itacitinib monotherapy to be safe  because of its extensive use in >700 patients 
prior to this tri al. However, in order to protect study subjects we have designed three  
stopping rules that will terminate the trial early if itacitinib monotherapy as a treatment for 
GVHD is either too toxic or ineffective . First, o ur preliminary data show that the incide nce 
of steroid -refractory GVHD  using the definition in section 2.3  in the low risk population  
eligible for this trial  is 38%. For an itacitinib monotherapy trial to be successful, the 
proportion of patients who develop steroid -refractory GVHD should not ex ceed 38%. We 
expect that patients who do not respond to itacitinib will be responsive to steroid treatment 
and we will continuously monitor the incidence of steroid -refractory GVHD in  all study 
subjects.  Patients will be considered to have steroid refract ory GVHD if their GVHD is 
treated with systemic steroids and they either do not respond by day 28 of steroid treatment 
or they receive additional systemic GVHD treatment prior to 28 days of steroid treatment. 
The trial will be halted if the incidence of st eroid -refractory GVHD is greater than the 
31 
 associated boundary value b k listed in the table below, among the k patients enrolled in the 
trial, then accrual will be halted.  
 
Maximum # of Patients, k  5 6-8 9-10 11-13 14-16 17-19 20-22 23-25 26-28 29-31 32-35

Boundary, b k 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 
  
Specifically, if more than 3 out of the first 5 patients, 4 out of the fir st 8 patients, 5 out of 
the first 1 0 patients, 6 out of the first 1 3 patients, or 2 4 out of the first 70 patients, experience 
steroid -refractory GVHD, the trial will be halted for safety considerations.  
 
The operating characteristics of this stopping rule are as follows:  
  
 True Steroid Refractory Rate  
24% 30% 33% 0.38 40% 42% 
Probability of Early Stopping  0.10 0.36 0.54 0.83 0.88 0.94 
  
Using these boundaries, if the true steroid refractory rate is 2 4%, 30%, 33%, 38%, 40% or 
42%, the probability of sto pping the trial early is 0.10, 0. 36, 0.54, 0.83, 0.88, and 0.9 4 
respectively.   
   
   
Serious infections:  
Itacitinib  monotherapy has been shown to be safe in over 7 00 patients. However, its use 
as a therapy for acute GVHD is investigational. The primary tox icity of treatment for GVHD 
is infection. Our preliminary data show that the incidence of serious infections in the first 
90 days of systemic steroid treatment for GVHD is 59%. Therefore, i f the proportion of 
study patients who experience serious infection s exceeds 59% , we would not further study 
itacitinib monotherapy for GVHD treatment. If the incidence of serious infections is greater 
than the associated boundary value bk listed in the table below  among the k patients 
enrolled in the trial, then accrual will be ended.  
 
 
  
Specifically, if more than 4 out of the first 6 patients, 5 out of the first 9 patients, 10 out of 
the first 20 patients, 14 o ut of the first 31 patients, or 29 out of the first 70 patients, 
experience serious infections within 3 months, the trial will be halted for safety 
considerations.  
  
The operating characteristics of this stopping rule are as follows:  
   
 True Serious Infec tions Rate  
35% 41% 45% 50% 55% 60% 
Probability of Early Stopping  0.10 0.31 0.55 0.79 0.96 0.99 
 
  Maximum # of Patients, k  6 7 8-9 10-11 12-14 15-16 17-18 19-20 21-22 23-24

Boundary, b k 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32  
32 
 Using these boundaries, if the true serious infections rate is 30%, 33%, 40%, 45%, 50% or 
60%, the probability of stopping the trial early is 0.10, 0.18, 0.57, 0.83, 0.96, and 1 
respectively.  
 
Non-relapse mortality:  
In this low risk patient population the the six -month non -relapse mortality rate is 9%. If, in 
the unlikely event that itacitinib -related toxicities increased the risk for non -relapse mortality 
we would want to terminate the trial early. We will continuously monitor the rate of non -
relapse mortality. The trial will be halted if there is sufficient evidence that the six month 
NRM rate is higher than 9%. Specifically, if the incidence of non -relaps e deaths within 6 
months of study administration is greater than the associated boundary value b k listed in 
the table below, among the k patients enrolled in the trial, then accrual will be halted for 
safety considerations.  
 
Maximum # of Patients, k  11 12-26 27-45 46-65 66-70 
Boundary, b k 1 2 3 4 5 
 
Specifically, if more than 1 out of the first 11 patients, 2 out of the first 26 patients, 3 out of 
the first 45 patients, 4 out of the first 65 patients, or 5 out of the first 70 patients, experience 
NRM with in 6 months of study administration, the trial will be halted for safety 
considerations.  
  
The operating characteristics of this stopping rule are as follows:  
  
 True NRM Rate  
3% 6% 8% 9% 11% 
Probability of Early Stopping  0.10 0.45 0.68 0.77 0.89 
  
Using these boundaries, if the true NRM rate is 3%, 6%, 8%, 9%, or 11%, the probability 
of stopping the trial early is 0.10, 0.45, 0.68, 0.77, and 0.89 respectively.

An enrollment rule to prevent an excessive number of toxicities as described in Song and 
Ivanova will be used to inform us of the number of additional patients we can recruit when 
the current patient has not yet completed follow -up48  Formally, the trial can enroll  m new 
patients such that  r + x + m ≤bn+m + M, r + x + m– 1 < b n+m−1 + M, and  n + m ≤ K where  r is 
defined as the number of patients that have not completed follow -up and are still being 
followed for toxicity;  x is the number of patients that have experienced toxicity,  n is the total 
number  of patients enrolled to date and M is the fixed design parameter. To be able to 
complete this low -risk study in a timely manner, we allow M to be 30.

9.0 DRUG INFORMATION  
9.1 Itacitinib  Adipate  
 
 Commercial names for the drug: Itacitinib (INCB389110)  
 
 Classification -type of agent: selective JAK1 inhibitor  
 
33 
  Description: Itacitinib may be formulated as 25 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, or 300 mg (free base 
equivalent) SR tablets. These table ts contain the active ingredient, hypromellose, microcrystalline 
cellulose, lactose monohydrate, and magnesium stearate, and may be coated with a nonfunctional 
coating. Itacitinib also may be formulated as an IR tablet but this preparation will not be used  in this 
trial.  
 
 Mode of action:  
Pharmacologic inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling has shown potential in the treatment of GVHD 
while maintaining the anti -leukemia effect of allogenic transplant49,50. In vivo JAK/STAT -signaling 
inhibition with ruxolitinib improved survival of mice developing aGVHD and reduced 
histopathological GVHD grading, serum levels of proinflamm atory cytokines, and expansion of 
alloreactive luc -transgenic T cells31. Additionally, ruxolitinib impaired differentiation of CD4+ T cells 
into IFN -γ and IL -17A–producing cells, both T -cell phenotypes linked to GVHD. Ruxolitinib also 
increased FoxP3+ regulatory T cells, which are linked to immunologic tolerance.  
 
JAK1/2 inhibition with ruxolitinib has also shown clinical benefit in patients with a cute GVHD and 
chronic graft -versus -host disease (cGVHD). In patients with steroid -refractory GVHD  treated with 
ruxolitinib, the ORR was 84.3% (27/32; 10 CRs and 17 PRs) in a cute GVHD and 80% (16/20) in 
cGVHD33. The median time to response was less than 2 weeks. After additional follow -up (medians 
of 19 and 24 months for a cute GVHD and cGVHD, respectively), 1 -year overall survival rates of 
62.4% (confidence interval [CI]: 49.4% -75.4%) and 92.7% (CI: 84.7% -100%) were reported for 
steroid -refractory a cute GVHD and cGVHD, respectively. The median duration of ruxolitinib 
treatment was 5 months for patients with steroid -refractory aGVHD and 10 months for patients with 
steroid -refractor y cGVHD, reflecting the different biology of the diseases (Zeiser et al 2016).   
 
Itacitinib, an inhibitor of JAK/STAT signaling with selectivity for JAK1, showed similar 
pharmacologic inhibition of interferon signaling, resulting in the decreased expressi on of CXCR3, 
reduced GVHD, and improved survival when administered for 30 days after allo -HSCT in mice 
(Investigator brochure). Preliminary data in subjects with a cute GVHD who received itacitinib in 
combination with corticosteroids (prednisone or methylpr ednisolone; Study INCB 39110 -108) 
indicate ORRs of 83.3% at Day 28 for subjects with first -line aGVHD and up to 66.7% for subjects 
with steroid -refractory aGVHD.  
 
 Pharmacokinetics:  
Eight formulations of itacitinib (IR or SR) have been studied in multiple  healthy volunteer studies. 
Sustained release is likely needed to maintain JAK inhibition over the dose administration interval 
given the relatively short half -life of IR formulation and to reduce the peak/trough ratio. Of the 
formulations studied, the SR3  formulation was selected for future study as other formulations had 
a larger food effect, lower relative bioavailability compared with the reference IR formulation 
(relative bioavailability = 48% for SR3), or more variable PK. Following a single dose of 3 00 mg 
itacitinib SR3 (3 × 100 mg tablets), there was a 46% increase in C max but only a 17% increase in 
total exposure (AUC0 -∞) when administered with a medium -fat meal. The non -clinically significant 
impact on total exposure when administered with a medium -fat meal supported the administration 
of itacitinib SR3 without regard to food. Currently, the SR3 100 mg formulation is the only 
formulation being used in any study of subjects with underlying conditions. A preliminary analysis 
comparing single doses of 100 mg (1 × 100 mg SR3 tablet), 200 mg (2 × 100 mg SR3 tablet), and 
300 mg (3 × 100 mg SR3 tablet; fasted) demonstrated that exposures increase in a greater -than-
proportional manner.  
 
Following multiple -dose administration of itacitinib SR3 400 BID or 800  QD with a medium fat meal, 
steady state was generally reached after 48 hours. Compared with Day 1, there was approximately 
60% and 15% accumulation in AUC0 -τ for the 400 mg BID and 800 mg QD doses, respectively, 
following a medium -fat meal. The highest to tal daily exposure after multiple -dose administration 
was achieved after administration of 600 mg BID (29.0 μM·h [calculated as 2 × AUC0 -12]). Mean 
half-life of itacitinib is generally reported in the range of 3 to 9 hours with an overall mean of 
34 
 approxima tely 5 hours. After itacitinib 400 mg BID and 800 mg QD administration with a medium -
fat meal, the intersubject CV% ranged from 25% to 34% for C max and 23% to 40% for AUC0 -τ.

 Adverse reactions:  
The underlying GVHD condition is a major contributor to morbidity in the post -transplant setting  
and should not be confused with adverse reactions attributable to investigational agents . 
Treatment -emergent adverse event s (TEAE) are reported regardless of attribution to GVHD, 
steroids, other  transplant related events,  or study drug and full safety assessments must take 
attribution into account. As of the data cutoff, 29 subjects in Study INCB 39110 -108 had 
received itacitinib in combination with corticosteroids, a pharmacologic class with its  own 
significant toxicity (section 1.2). All 29 subjects had at least 1  TEAE, 28 of  those (96.6%)  were 
grade 3 or higher. The most frequently reported TEAEs were consistent with expectations for 
GVHD patients and included thrombocytopenia (41.4%), diarrhea  (37.9%), abdominal pain 
(34.5%), and peripheral edema, fatigue, and hypokalemia (31.0% each). One subject with pre -
existing thrombocytopenia had a Grade 3 dose -limiting event of thrombocytopenia that was 
attributed to GVHD progression. Other frequently re ported TEAEs (≥20%) included 
hyperglycemia (27.6%), decreased appetite, headache, hypophosphatemia, nausea, and 
tachycardia (24.1% each), and dry mouth, hypoalbuminemia, sepsis, and vomiting (20.7%) , all 
common events in patients with GVHD treated with ste roids .  The most frequently reported 
TEAE leading to permanent discontinuation of itacitinib was GI hemorrhage (3 subjects; 
10.3%) , a known complication of GI GVHD . The only other TEAE leading to permanent 
discontinuation of itacitinib in more than 1 subje ct was thrombocytopenia (2 subjects; 6.9%). 
Eight subjects (27.6%) in the study had a fatal TEAE , six of which occurred after discontinuing 
study treatment .  Three  subjects experienced multi -organ failure (10.3%); two sepsis (6.9%); 
and one  patient each de veloped GI hemorrhage, hematochezia, electrolyte imbalance, or acute 
respiratory distress syndrome (3.4% each). Of note, two of these patients discontinued the 
study drug due to a TEAE (electrolyte imbalance and multiorgan failure).   None of these deaths 
were attributed to itacitinib.  
 
Serious adverse events were reported in 22 subjects (75.9%) of which 7 (24.1%) were 
treatment related. The most frequently reported SAE was sepsis (6 subjects; 20.7%). Other 
SAEs reported in more than 1 subject included GI he morrhage (4 subjects; 13.8%), multiorgan 
failure (3 subjects; 10.3%), diarrhea (3 subjects; 10.3%), and acute kidney injury (2 subjects; 
6.9%). Treatment -related SAEs included sepsis (3 subjects; 10.3%) and klebsiella sepsis, 
pancytopenia, diarrhea, pneuma tosis intestinalis, pneumoperitoneum, and CMV viremia (1 
subject each; 3.4%). As of the data cutoff, 25 subjects (83.3%) ha d discontinued treatment: 11 
subjects (36.7%) because of a TEAE, 4 subjects (13.3%) because of progressive disease, 4 
subjects (13.3% ) because of physician decision, 2 subjects (6.7%) because of death, and 4 
subjects (13.3%) for reasons classified as 'Other.' The most frequently reported TEAE leading 
to permanent discontinuation of itacitinib was GI hemorrhage (3 subjects; 10.3%). The o nly 
other TEAE leading to permanent discontinuation of itacitinib in more than 1 subject was 
35 
 thrombocytopenia (2 subjects; 6.9%). A preliminary, unaudited summary of the TEAEs in ≥ 3 
subjects from Study INCB 39110 -108 is presented in the following table:

Experience with itacitinib monotherapy in non -GVHD disease states suggests a favorable 
safety pro file. The following TEAE data are based on all Incyte -sponsored clinical studies from 
the start of the itacitinib clinical development program through December 13, 2016. As of the 
data cutoff date, 777 subjects have been exposed to itacitinib as monotherap y (493 subjects; 
including 284 healthy volunteers and 209 subjects with underlying disease such as RA, chronic 
plaque psoriasis, or MF) .

 Drug interactions:  
37 
 Cytochrome P450 3A4 is the major isozyme responsible for the metabolism of itacitinib in  
human liver microsomes. In a cultured human hepatocyte assay, itacitinib did not induce  
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4/5 activity or mRNA levels, suggesting  that the potential to  
induce P450 in clinical studies is low. In vitro assays indicated that itacitinib is a substrate of  
P glycoprotein (P -gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). In addition, the potential for  
itacitinib to cause clinical drug -drug interactions (DDIs) through CYP inhibition is low based on  
IC50 v alues and clinical doses  based on the current Committee for Medicinal Products for Human 
Use guideline  and draft FDA guidance51,52. For efflux transporters, in vitro studies demonstrated 
that itacitinib is a substrate of P -gp and BCRP. In addition, itacitinib is not an inhibitor of BCRP but 
is a weak inhibitor of P -gp with an IC50 of 41.4 μM. For uptake transporters, in vitro studies 
demonstrated that itacitinib is not a substrate of hepatic transporters OATP1B1/1B3, and inhibitory 
potentials toward hepatic transporters OATP1B1/1B3 a nd renal transporters OAT1/3 and OCT2 
are low.  
 
Because the primary metabolic pathway is metabolism by CYP3A4, a 1 -way drug -drug interaction 
study (INCB 39110 -110) was conducted to evaluate the impact of co -administration  of itraconazole 
(a potent CYP3A4 i nhibitor) or rifampin (a potent CYP3A4 inducer) on itacitinib  exposure in healthy 
subjects. This was an open -label study to assess the effect of multiple doses  of itraconazole or 
rifampin on the single -dose PK of itacitinib. Thirty -six healthy subjects wer e divided into 2 cohorts 
of 18 subjects.  
In Cohort 1, subjects received each of the following treatments in succession, as shown below:  
Day 1: Itacitinib 200 mg SR (100 mg SR × 2) single dose administered orally in the  
fasted state.  
Days 2 through 5: Itrac onazole 200 mg QD in the fed state (4 doses).  
Day 6: Itacitinib 200 mg SR (100 mg SR × 2) single dose and itraconazole 200 mg  
single dose in the fasted state.  
Day 7: Itraconazole 200 mg single dose in the fed state.  
 
In Cohort 2, subjects received each of the following treatments in succession, as shown below:  
Day 1: Itacitinib 200 mg SR (100 mg SR × 2) single dose administered orally in the  fasted state.  
Days 2 through 8: Rifampin 600 mg QD in the fasted state (7 doses).  
Day 9: Itacitinib 200 mg SR (100 mg  SR × 2) single dose and rifampin 600 mg  single dose in the 
fasted state.  
 
There was a notable change in exposure when itacitinib was coadministered with either  a potent 
CYP3A4 inhibitor (~5 -fold increase in exposure) or a potent CYP3A4 inducers  (~80% decr ease in 
exposure) .

 10.0 CORRELATIVES/SPEC IAL STUDIES  
The goal of the planned labor atory correlative studies is to  improve our understanding of the 
biological processes that drive GVHD and its clinical outcomes.  
10.1 Sample Collection Guidelines  
The correlative sample collection schedule is detailed in  section 6. 3 above. Serum will be 
collected in no additive, silicone coated glass  or plastic  tubes  containing no anticoagulant 
(red or gold top tube). Samples will be processed at the participating center and batch 
shipped to Ferrara Laboratory quarterly f or storage. Sample processing details are found 
in the a ppendi ces. Instructions for quarterly batch shipping are found in the MAGIC Sample 
Collection and Storage Manual . 
10.2 Assay Methodology  
See Append ix A. 
10.3 Specimen Banking  
Patient samples collected for this study will be stored indefinitely or until they are used up. 
If future use is denied or withdrawn by the patient, best efforts will be made to stop any 
additional studies and to destroy the specimens.  In addition to the biomarker studies 
planned as part of  this study, additional studies may be performed on the banked research 
samples as part of collaborations with other institutions and entities.   
 
The specimens, DNA, and their derivatives may have significant therapeutic or commercial 
value . The Informed Consent form contains this information and informs the subject that 
there is the potential for financial gain by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai , the 
investigator or a collaborating researcher or entity.  
 
The following information obtained fro m the subject's medical record may be provided to 
research collaborators when specimens are made available:   
 Diagnosis  
 Collection time in relation to study treatment  
 Clinical outcome – if available  
 Demographic data  
11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1 Study Design/ Study Endpoints  
This is a non -inferiority, phase II, single arm, open -label , multicenter clinical trial to 
determine the effectiveness of itacitinib monotherapy as primary treatment of newly 
diagnosed, low -risk acute GVHD defined by standard risk clinical criteria (Minnesota) and 
low risk biomarkers (Ann Arbor 1). The primary study measure is the proportion of patients 
who achieve CR or PR by day 28 of treatment with itacitinib without the addition of any 
other systemic GVHD treatment including steroids. CR is defined as absence of GVHD 
symptoms. PR is defined as improvement in one or more organs involved with GVHD 
symptoms without progression in other organs. For a response to be scored as CR or PR 
on day 28, the patient must be in CR or PR on day 28 and ha ve had no intervening systemic 
therapy for acute GVHD other than itacitinib.  
 
To further investigate the treatment regimen, we will assess the safety of itacitinib  
monotherapy in these patients, determine the incidence of serious complications within 
three  months in patients with GVHD treated with itacitinib and determine the incidence of 
steroid refractory GVHD in patients whose GVHD is not responsive to itacitinib (as defined 
in section 2.3) as secondary objectives. Secondary endpoints will include cumula tive 
incidence of steroid -refractory GVHD, proportion of patients with maximal grade I, II, III, 
39 
 and IV GVHD by day 28 after starting treatment with itacitinib, cumulative incidence of 
serious infections (defined as bacteremia  needing treatment , CMV infect ion needing 
treatment, EBV infection needing treatment, or invasive fungal infection), overall survival 
at 6 and 12 months, cumulative incidence of NRM at 6 and 12 months, relapse rate, and 
cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD requiring systemic steroid tr eatment by one year.  
 
As a safety endpoint, we will calculate number and proportion of patients developing 
reportable AEs and SAEs according to relatedness to study drug and stratified by severity.  
 
Our exploratory hypotheses are as follows: 1) GVHD bioma rkers (such as ST2 and 
REG3 α) will remain low in study patients who respond to itacitinib treatment, but will rise 
in non -responders. 2) biomarker concentrations will be equivalent to those in historical 
control patients who respond to steroid treatment fo r low risk GVHD. The historical control 
population for this study will be derived from MAGIC patients  worldwide  who enroll from 
2014-2019. We expect at least 500 patients with  Minnesota standard risk/Ann Arbor 1 
GVHD will be available as control patients.   
 
11.2 Sample Size and Accrual  
In this phase II clinical trial, our aim is to determine if itacitinib monotherapy as primary 
treatment of newly diagnosed, low -risk acute GVHD defined by standard risk clinical criteria 
(Minnesota) and low risk biomarkers (Ann A rbor 1) is non -inferior to standard steroid 
therapy. The expected proportion of low -risk acute GVHD patients who achieve CR or PR 
by day 28 of standard steroid treatment is 67%. Avoidance of the toxicity of steroid 
treatment is a priority for the HCT commu nity in general and MAGIC centers specifically. 
Extensive preliminary discussion indicate that physicians would accept a 15% decrease in 
the overall response rate to primary GVHD treatment (from 67% to 52%) if steroid treatment 
could be avoided in the resp onders without an increase in the incidence of steroid 
refractory GVHD. This study will terminate early if the incidence of steroid refractory GVHD 
exceeds the historical rate of 33% , if the incidence of serious infections exceeds the 
historical rate of 59 % or if the incidence of non -relapse mortality (as a measure of all  
potential  toxicities) exceeds the historical rate of 9%  (section 8.7).  
A one-sided group sequential design that uses O’Brien -Fleming method testing an upper 
(futility) stopping boundary i s used to stop the trial early for futility. Two equally spaced 
formal interim analyses will be performed during the monitoring of the study. Under such a 
monitoring schedule and assuming a baseline 28 -day response rate of 0.67 in standard 
steroid treatmen t, a sample size of 70 patients will provide 80% power to detect a non -
inferiority margin of 0.15 in response rate by day 28. Under the planned schedule of tw o 
equally spaced analysis and assuming a baseline response rate of 0.67, the table below  
presents the stopping boundaries at each analysis for the specified stopping rule 
expressed as the number of responses by day 28.  
 
Stage  Sample Size  Futility stopping boundary  
Z statistic  Number of CR and PR 
by day 28  
1 35 0.558  19 
2 70 1.734  44 
 
 
According t o the above table, if at first analysis the response rate by day 28 is less than or 
equal to 19, the stopping rule suggests that the study be terminated early with a decision 
that it was futile to continue the trial because there is not sufficient evidence  that any 
beneficial effect of the experimental treatment is clinically important.  
 
The combination of the primary efficacy endpoint (overall response rate) and the secondary 
endpoints (steroid -refractory GVHD, NRM, and serious infections) will be used to 
40 
 determine if itacitinib monotherapy should be compared to systemic steroid treatment in a 
phase III trial for patients with low risk GVHD. We will continuously monitor these outcomes 
and if at any point during this trial sufficient evidence emerges that it acitinib monotherapy 
is not likely to result in improvement in any of these parameters, the protocol committee 
will terminate the trial for futility.  
 
Sample size calculations were performed using seqdesign statement in PASS 14 Power 
Analysis and Sample S ize Software (2015) NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, Utah, USA, 
ncss.com/software/passSAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Raleigh, NC).  
 
 
The centers participating in this clinical trial collectively perform >700 allogeneic HCT per 
year. Based on data from these MAGIC centers from 2013 -2017, we expect 300 patients 
will develop GVHD per year, including 255 with Minnesota Standard Risk GVHD. Although 
it is likely we will accrue faster, a conservative  estimate is that we will  consent and screen 
50% of these cas es which should result in 48 patients enrolled per year  or approximately 
4 per month . We do not expect all centers to open to enrollment simultaneously and 
therefore we realistically expect to meet our accrual goals within two years.  
11.3 Data Analys is Plans  
The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who achieve CR or PR by day 28 of 
treatment with itacitinib without the addition of any other systemic GVHD treatment 
including steroids. Death, lack of GVHD response to itacitinib by day 28 of treatment, or  
initiation of steroid or other systemic immunosuppressive therapy for GVHD will be 
considered failures for this endpoint. The proportion of patients who achieve CR or PR by 
day 28 in the study patients will be compared to the historical control rate of 67 %. 
 
Secondary outcomes such as cumulative incidence of steroid -refractory GVHD, proportion 
of patients with maximal grade I, II, III, and IV GVHD by day 28 after starting treatment with 
itacitinib, cumulative incidence of serious infections, cumulative inc idence of hematologic 
toxicities, cumulative steroid dose over four weeks in patients who fail itacitinib 
monotherapy, overall survival at 6 and 12 months, cumulative incidence of NRM at 6 and 
12 months, relapse rate  at 6 and 12 months , and cumulative inci dence of chronic GVHD 
requiring systemic steroid treatment by one year  will be estimated and compared to 
historical controls.  
 
Continuous variables will be summarized using standard summary statistics such as 
number of observations (n), mean, standard devi ation (SD), minimum and maximum 
values, median, and 1st and 3rd quartiles. Categorical variables will be summarized in 
frequency tables as counts and percentages.  
 
Cumulative incidence of non -relapse mortality will be estimated by Gray’s method53  and 
relapse will be considered as a competing risk. Disease free and overall survival, defined 
as the time from the transplantation to death or to last follow -up if alive, will be estimated 
by the method of Kaplan -Meier and the probability curves and 95% confidence intervals 
will be provided based on the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley54. 
12.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
The safety of subjects is paramount and supersedes all other concerns. This study employ s several 
layers of oversight to ensure that patient safety is protected.   
 
1. The local Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) at each site which will be responsible 
for reviews of patient data at each site  
2. The Protocol Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), composed of the individual site 
PI’s which will review all facets of study conduct at all sites on monthly webinars  
41 
 3. The Tisch Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (TCI DSMC ) of the Mount 
Sinai Health System is the DSMB of record for this study. The DSMB  will be compliant with the 
NIH approved DSMP Charte r. This  committee will be responsible for monitoring the safety and 
data integrity of the trial. It is a DSMB entirely composed of members with no connection to this 
clinical trial.  
4. Annual reviews and safety reporting will be provided to t he IRBs at each p articipating site ,  the 
Mount  Sinai Health Sys tem, and the F DA as required by IND regulations (21 CFR 312.3).  
 
This study will enroll adolescent patients who we expect will provide up to 20% of the study 
subjects. These patients will be enrolled from pedia tric HCT centers and will receive their care from 
trained pediatric HCT physicians.  We will closely monitor toxicity and efficacy in patients <18 years 
of age. The oversight boards (Protocol DSMB and TCI DSMC) can halt pe diatric accrual to the 
study if an unexpected safety concern develops in children, while continuing adult accrual.  
 
Protocol DSMB: The centers participating in this study are collaborating centers in MAGIC ( Mount 
Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium).  The local site principal investiga tor, data manager, 
and study coordinator participates in monthly webinars  where all facets of study conduct are 
discussed, thereby providing an additional layer of safety oversight.  
 
The MAGIC Data Coordinating Center  is res ponsible for collating all data and s afety reports from 
all the participating sites, and providing the information to the TCI Data Safety Monitoring 
Committee . 
 
TCI DSMC : The TCI DSMC  serves as the data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) for investigator 
initiated studies conducted under  the auspices of the Tisch Cancer Institute (TCI) at the Mount 
Sinai Health System . It is compliant with the National Institutes of Health and National Cancer 
Institute charter for DSMBs. This board will be responsible for monitoring the safety and data 
integrity of the trial. It is a DSMB entirely composed of members with no connection to this clinical 
trial. 
 
12.1 Multisite Clinical Monitoring Procedures  
This clinical study will be coordinated by the MAGIC Data Coordinating Center (DCC) of 
the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai . As such it will be conducted in accordance 
with the ethical principles that are consistent with Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and in 
compliance with other applicable regulatory requirements.  
 
Prior to subject recruitment, a partici pating site will undergo a site initiation meeting to be 
conducted by the DCC. This will be done as an actual site visit, teleconference, 
videoconference, or web -based meeting after the site has been given access to the study 
database and assembled a study  reference binder.  The site’s principal investigator and 
his/her study staff should make every effort in attending the site initiation meeting. Study -
related questions or issues identified during the site initiation meeting will be followed -up 
by the appr opriate DCC  personnel until they have been answered and resolved.  
 
This study will be monitored by a representative of the  MAGIC Data Coordinating Center . 
Monitoring visits , whether remote or in person,  will be made during the conduct of the study 
and at s tudy close -out. The following issues will be monitored.  
 
 Signed and dated ICF  
 Adherence to the protocol  
 Completeness and accuracy of study data and laboratory samples collection  
 Proper storage, dispensing and inventory control of investigational drug  
 Compl iance with  state and local  regulations  
 
42 
 Any issues identified during these visits will be communicated to the site and are expected 
to be corrected  by the site in a timely manner.  For review of study -related documents at 
the DCC, the site will be required  to ship, fax, or email documents to be reviewed, ensuring 
compliance with HIPAA and other privacy regulations.  
 
Participating sites will also undergo a site close -out upon completion, termination or 
cancellation of a study to ensure fulfillment of study obligations during the conduct of the 
study, and that the site Investigator is aware of his/her ongoing responsibilities. At the time 
of the close -out any investigational agents not dispensed need to be returned as defined 
for the study or destroyed and ac counted for properly.  
 
13.0 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND AUDITS  
The Data Safety Monitoring Board can request a ‘for cause’ audit of the trial if the board identifies 
a need for a more rigorous evaluation of study -related issues. A “for cause” audit would be 
conducted by the Project Manager of the MAGIC Data Coordinating Center . 
 
A regulatory authority (e.g. FDA) may also wish to conduct an inspection of the study, during its 
conduct or even after its completion. If an inspection has been requested by a regulatory 
autho rity, the site investigator must immediately inform the MAGIC Data Coordinating Center  that 
such a request has been made.

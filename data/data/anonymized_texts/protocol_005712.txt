I. Introduction and Rationale  
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasingly prevalent in the elderly and carries 
sequelae that extend beyond pr ogression to kidney failure.1  These sequelae include 
neurocognitive and physical dysfunction, both of which occur at markedly higher rates in 
CKD patients, even after  accounting for differences in common co -morbidities includin g 
underlying cardiovascular disease and diabetes.2-7  
 
For example, among older  adults, those with CKD have a 40% greater risk of incident 
dementia8, a 75% greater risk of physical frailty9, and poorer health -related quality  of 
life10, independent of tradi tional risk factors. Other f actors that may explain these 
cognitive and physical impairments include inflammation  and microvascular endothelial 
dysfunction, both of which are more frequent in CKD and are associated with 
compromised cognitive and  physical f unction in the general popul ation.11-14 To date, no 
medical interventions are proven to prevent cognitive and physical dysfunction in this  
exceedingly high -risk population.  Given the high prevalence of CKD, the aging US 
population, and the substantial soc ietal burden  associated with  cognitive and physical 
dysfunction for older adults, including loss of independence, this knowledge gap requires  
investigation.  
 
Aerobic and resistance exercise training is a potentially promising non -pharmacological 
intervent ion to improve cognitive and  physical dysfunction in CKD. Several pilot studies 
of supervised exercise training in individuals with CKD suggest improved physical  
function, and several studies in older patients without kidney disease demonstrate 
improved ne urocognitive function, infla mmation, vascular  function, and vascular risk 
factors.15-27  Accordingly, w e hypothesize that exercise training will improve 
neurocognitive function, physical function, and health -related quality of life in older, non -
dialysis  CKD patients, and that these results are mediated in part by improvements in 
inflammation, vascular function, lipids, blood pressure  and insulin resistance.  
 
To test this hypothesis, w e will conduct  a randomized parallel -group clinical trial in 120 
older ( ages 50 years  and older ) com munity -dwelling adults  with CKD stages 3b -4 to 
evaluate the effects of 12 months of aerobic and resistance exercise training versus 
directed health education on  neurocognitive function, physical function, and health -
related qual ity of life, and to evaluate  the effect on potential mediating factors including 
inflammation,  microvascular endothelial function, and other vascular risk factors.  
 
This project has the potential to substantial ly expan d current knowledge with the  ultimate  
goals of developing a feasi ble intervention to improve outcomes in older patients with 
CKD and furthering the understanding of  mechanisms related to the efficacy of this 
intervention.

II. Recruitment . 
Patients with chronic kidney disease (defined by an eGF R below 45 mL/min per 1.73m2) 
who are age 50 years and older will be initially approached by their primary nephrologist 
(for local nephrology practices) or Tufts Medical Center nephrologist with whom they 
have a relationship in the outpatient clinics at Tu fts Medical Center.   
 
Clinic schedules and active clinic patients will be screened using medical records to 
determine preliminary eligibility; nephrologists will be made aware of their potentially 
eligible patients in order to facilitate study referrals.  Additionally, study posters  will be 
posted in waiting areas and brochures will be available for potential participants.   
 
Local r ecruitment sites will include:  
• Tufts Medical Center  Nephrology  
• Tufts Medical Center General Medical Associates  
• St Elizabeth's  Medical Center (Drs. James Strom, Geetha Narayan, Anthony 
Dash and Bertrand Jaber)  
• Dr. Ashraf Selim (practices in Malden and Everett)  
• Dr. Michael Cohen (practices primarily in Melrose and is a member of the Tufts 
Medical Center Division of Nephrology)  
• Dr. Anthony Dash (practices pri marily at Lawrence Memorial Hospital in addition 
to St. Elizabeth's Medical Center and is a member of the Division of Nephrology)  
• Drs. Andrei Kouznetsov and Valerie Price (practice primarily in Concord and are 
members of the Div ision of Nephrology at Tufts  Medical Center).   
 
Weekly patient lists will be acquired from the GMA clinic.  The list will include individuals 
scheduled to be seen by the GMA physicians during the next week who are 59 years of 
age and older who carry a dia gnosis of chronic kidney dis ease.   
 
Only patients who express interest, either by indicating such to their physician  or by 
responding to targeted advertising described above, will be approached further.  Subjects 
identified by medical record screening alon e, who are not coming in for  a regularly 
scheduled visit, will be mailed a letter providing more information about AWARD , and 
offering a system by which they can opt -out of further follow up calls regarding their 
interest in the study.   Letters will only b e mailed to potential subjec ts for which their PCP 
or Nephrologist has given approval to contact.   After referral to the investigating team, 
research study personnel will describe the study in detail to potential participants, and 
participants will be aske d for informed consent to pa rticipate in the study. An informed 
consent procedure approved by the Tufts Medical Center IRB will be used, and this will 
include a full description of the purpose of the study, the procedures involved, and 
potential risks. Ind ividuals who give informed c onsent to participate will then undergo  
screening for full eligibility for the study at Tufts Medical Center. A copy of the informed 
consent document as well as the research authorization form will be provided to all 
enrolled pa rticipants.  
 
Patients will b e told clearly that they are not required or obligated to participate, and that  
their medical care will not be  influenced by a decision to not participate.  Beyond brief 
introductions , which  may occur in a private room in the cl inic, detailed discussion s 
between potential participants and investigators regarding eligibility and/or informed 
consent will take place at the Tufts Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC)

Principal Investigator: Daniel E Weiner, MD MS  
Protocol Version  4 
3 of 16 May 17, 201 6 in a private interview room.  Potential participants will have the opportunity to a sk any 
questions regarding the study and to discuss the decision to participate with family 
members and others.   To ensure continued consent and understanding of the study 
procedures , participants may, at any time , ask to review  individual  specific study 
procedures and any pre -procedure preparation they will need to do. The participants will 
also be encouraged to take as much  time as needed to decide whether they want to 
participate and will be encouraged to discuss the study wit h family and friends before 
signing  a consent form.  
 
Release of Medical Information  
Participants will be asked to sign a Release of Medical Information form at the screening 
or randomization visit.  This will be used to obtain relevant medical history info rmation 
and in the case of a  Emergency Department visit or Admission to an outside hospital.  
 
 
III. Randomization  
After complet ing screening , eligible p atients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to an 
exercise training intervention group or a directed health  and successful aging  education 
control group .  Randomization will occur using a permutated block  design, with block 
sizes of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.  The randomization will be stratified by study site.  Primary 
Investigators will not be blinded.   Study staff cond ucting the cognitive testing  will remain 
blinded to limit the potential for administer bias during the study.   
 
IV. Study Phases  
The study processes that occur after informed consent are detailed below : 
 
PHASE 1. SCREENING . 
Screening will occur following writt en informed consent a nd will  include medical history, 
physical exam ination, and a resting ECG . The Mini -Mental State Exam , Beck  
Depression Inventory (BDI), and CHAMPS: Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older  
Adults will be administered . A stress test (g raded exercise test without VO2 collection) 
will be preformed. Laboratory  tests will include eGFR HbA1c , CBC  and a chemistry 7 
panel . Screening may take place over one or two days. All other portions of the 
screening process will occur prior to obtaining t he exercise stress test.  If  a potential 
participant does not qualify for the study for any reason on the initial portions of 
screening, they will not be given the exercise stress test.  Individuals developing 
inducible ischemia, symptomatic angina or clau dication, or who are otherwi se unable to 
complete the test will not be eligible for randomization and will exit from the study.  
Testing will be performed at the Tufts HNRCA.  The study cardiologist, Dr. Robert 
Peters, is located at the Baltimore site.  We  anticipate that approximate ly 30% of 
subjects undergoing screening/baseline treadmill testing will not qualify and have 
accounted for this in our recruitment plans.  
Participants who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will proceed to Phase 2.  
 
PHASE 2.  BASELINE ASSESSMENT . 
The basel ine assessment will consist of two visit  and include : 
 
• Graded exercise treadmill test with assessment of VO 2peak (see below for 
description of this testing).   
• Blood pressure and other vital signs , medication log, anthropometry  
The Aerobi cs, Weights and Renal Diseas e (AWARD) Trial

Protocol Version  4 
4 of 16 May 17, 201 6 • Blood and urine tests, Chem -7, CBC, HbA1c urine protein, urine creatinine, urine 
albumin, vitamin d, hsCRP, lipids, insulin resistance, IL -6 
• Additional blood and urine stored for future assessment of additional mediators (with 
additional funding)  
• Quality o f Life Assessments (MSAS -SF and SF -36, San Diego Claudication 
Questionnaire ) 
• Health status (EQ -5D-5L) 
• Sleep assessment (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inde x (PSQI) , Sleep Actigraphy)  
• Neurocognitive test battery  
• Physical function and strength assessment battery  
• Measurement of endothelial fu nction  
• Step Activity Monitoring (SAM)  
• Health Literacy Assessment (STOFHLA)  
 
 
 
PHASE 3. DIETARY COUNSELING . 
Baseline dietary  information will  be provided to all participants to minimize effects of 
dietary heterogeneity on respons es to exercise training. The  American Heart Association 
Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet for adults at high vascular risk will be recommended 
and described  in a standardized educational handout.  
 
 
  
PHASE 4:  3-MONTH BLOOD DRAW 
At 3-months after random ization, a Chem -7, CBC and H bA1c will be drawn for safety 
assessment.  If any of these labs had been run clinically within 30 days of the 3 -month 
time point, they will be used for the safety assessment.

The study i nterventions are described belo w, and, for both groups, de -intensify after 6 
months.   
 
PHASES 6 AND 8.  6-MONTH  AND 12-MONTH ASSESSMENT  
Phase 6 is the 6-Month assessment, at which time all baseline measures  will be  
repeated except for endothelial function as sessment, step activity moni tor, sleep  
actigraphy assessment  and STOFHLA .  Phase 8 is the 12-Month , at which time all 
baseline measures will be repeated  except for the STOFHLA . 
 
Phase 9:  Post -Education Group Exercise  
Participants who were randomized into t he Health Education interven tion group that 
completed all 12 months of the intervention will be eligible to participate in an optional, 
abbreviated, exercise training intervention.  This exercise intervention will occur twice a 
week for 3 months.  The exer cise training sessions will follow the same protocol as the 
12-month exercise intervention sessions.  The 12 -month V02 peak test will be used to 
determine the target heart rate for the participant.  Prior to initiation of this exercise 
intervention, a stud y physician will review each  participant’s medical history and 
medication lists for interim changes.  The study physician will determine that there is no 
contraindication for exercise in each participant.    
 
At the end of the 3 month exercise intervention,  participants will undergo a  post-exercise 
assessment.  At this assessment the following will be performed:  
 
- 6-minute Walk Test  
- SF-36 
- MSAS  
- BDI 
- EQ-5D-5L 
- PSQI  
- CHAMPS  
 
 
Phase 10:  Post -Intervention Assessment  
Participants who complete the 12 -month assessment will complete a followed up to 
assess for activity level, quality of life, and sleep.  This assessment can take place in -
center, by phone, or through the mail.   
 
Exercise Intervention Group :  Participants who complete the 12 -month exercise 
intervention gr oup will perform this follow  up visit 6 months after the 12 -month 
assessment (+/ - 3 weeks).  18 -Month Visit  
 
Education Group (NOT participating in optional exercise) :  Participants who complete 
the 12 -month Health Education group who choose NOT to particip ate in the optional 
post-education exercise will perform this follow up visit 6 months after the 12 -month 
assessment (+/ - 3 weeks).   18-Month Visit

V. Study Interventions  
A. EXERCISE  TRAINING GROUP  
Participants randomize d to exercise training w ill receive 6 months  of in-center aerobic 
and strength training followed by a 6 month maintenance phase. Training will occur at 
the Tufts HNRCA  with a goal of three 50 -minute sessions weekly.  Sessions wi ll be 
conducted by an exerci se physiologist/trainer under the supervision of Roger Fielding, 
PhD in small groups compris ing up to 4 participants to improve feasibility and efficiency.  
Aerobic training will consist primarily of treadmill -based walking.  Exercise sessions will 
be prec eded by a brief warm -up and will end with a brief cool -down period. Obtaining 
appropriate exercise intensity is an essential component to a successful training routine, 
as intensity and duration that is too low may not result in  a meaningful improvement in  
function and capacity while intensity that is too high may both increase the risk of 
adverse events and may not be sustainable for a sufficient duration. Consistent with our 
prior studies, aerobic exercise intensity will be pre scribed as a target heart ra te (THR) 
corresponding to a percentage of the heart rate reserve (HRR) as defined by the 
equation of Karvonen.  For the first 4 -6 sessions, participants will exercise at an intensity 
of 50 -65% for 20 minutes with one or two 5 - minute breaks.  Intensity wil l progress to 
70–80% over the subsequent 2 -4 weeks of the protocol based on tolerance, ultimately 
including up to 40 minutes of exercise.  Each session will be monitored to ensure the 
safety of participants, including assessment  of blood pressure, heart ra te, and exertion.  
For diabetic participants, blood glucose will be measured at the start  and completion  of 
each exercise session, with instructions to repeat the measurement 2 -4 hours later to 
screen for post -exercise hypoglyce mia.  
 
Given the advanced ki dney disease population that is participating in the study, w e 
anticipate that some participants will have acute medical events during the study and 
may need to curtail or temporarily suspend the exercise intervention.  When thi s occurs, 
the participant’s status will be changed to ‘suspended’.  When medically cleared, we will 
perform a modified re -initiation of the training phase until the participant can re -establish 
exercise intensity of 70 –80% of HRR, at which time they will r esume the study at the 
week at which they were assigned suspended status.  If an acute medical event occurs 
in the 2 weeks prior to the planned interim or final month outcome assessment, we will -  Education Intervention

7 of 16 May 17, 201 6 postpone the assessment until at least 6 thrice  or twice -week ly in-center training 
sessio ns can be completed at target exercise intensity.  Participants will be restarted in 
the study when it is deemed appropriate by the participant’s physician(s) and the study 
investigators.  Resistance training of the upper and lo wer extremities will follow aerobic 
training sessions twice weekly, using a strength training routine similar to that employed 
successfully in the LIFE -P study  (which is also being conducted at the HNRCA by Dr. 
Fielding).   This 10 minute regimen focuses pr imarily on upper and lower e xtremity 
strengthening exercises, incorporating standing leg curls, knee extension and side hip 
raises with ankle weights, arm raises, biceps curls and overhead raises with hand 
weights, and leg squats and toe stands.  Subjects will be encouraged to perfor m the 
strength training exercises up to an intensity of 15 to 16 (“somewhat hard” to “hard”) on 
the rated perceived exertion (RPE) scale.  This brief moderate intensity resistance 
training program has previously been shown to ma intain muscle strength and s ize in 
mobility -limited older adults.  
 
B. HEALTH EDUCATION GROUP  
The Health Education Group will receive lifestyle counseling in a social setting,  
incorporating a Successful Aging Workshop series adapted from the LIFE -P clinical  trial 
and to be utilized in  LIFE.  Participants will receive  information on a variety of topics of 
relevance to older adults (e.g., effective negotiation of the health care system, safe 
travel, age  appropriate  preventive services and screenings, resources  for reliable health 
informa tion, etc.) with further discussion of factors relevant to  CKD (e.g., kidney 
replacement therapies, dialysis access,  etc.).  The program includes an experiential 
component, in which participants  learn how to ‘take charge’ of the ir health in seeking out 
appropriate medical  information and services.  In addition to educational offerings, an  
instructor led program (5 -10 minutes) of upper extremity gentle stretching exercises and 
relaxation techniques are performed during each  class.   To promote involvement, 
additional upper extremity stretches will be added during the study.  As demonstrated in 
the LIFE -P, this  ‘placebo exercise’ activity helps foster adherence to the control arm of 
the study and increases the perceived benefit of th e Successful  Aging Workshop series 
without directly affecting study outcomes.   Workshops will occur weekly during the initial 
phase and monthly during  the maintenance phase. Following study completion, 
individuals randomized to  Health Education will have t he option of joining in an  
abbreviated structured exercise program , conducted under the direction of a trained 
exercise physiologist  at the HNRCA  similar to the research ex ercise intervention ; this is 
intended to improve compliance and retention in the con trol group and will not be p art of 
the study protocol.   The program will entail two sessions with an exercise physiologist to 
tailor a patient -appropriate exercise program which can be performed by the patient at 
home.   All education presentations will be submitted to the IRB for app roval prior to their 
use.

A. NEUROCOGNITIVE TESTS  
A 14-test cognitive battery  that examines a range of domains including executive 
function s, psychomotor speed,  attent ion, verbal and non -verbal memory and learn ing, 
and visuospatial functions will be administered to all participants.  This is summarized in 
the table below.  
 
B. PHYSICAL FUNCTION TESTS  
The primary outcomes of peak aerobic capaci ty on graded exercise treadm ill test 
(V0 2peak) and  performance on the 6 -minute walk test, as well as several  secondary 
outcomes, including score on the short physical performance battery,  performance on 
the timed “get up and go” test, and assessment of mus cle power.  
a)  V02peak will be measured during a maximal treadmill exercise test  using a 
modified Balke protocol. During the test, O 2 consumption,  CO 2 production, and 
minute ventilation are measured breath -by-breath using a  metabolic cart (Quark 
Cardio Pul monary Exercise Testing  meta bolic analyzer, Cosmed, Rome), with 
values averaged for 20 second intervals .  We recognize that not all participants 
will be able to  obtain a true maximal aerobic capacity as defined by a plateau in 
oxygen consumption.   Therefor e, we plan to use the peak o xygen  consumption 
as our main outcome measure. Blood pressure and E CGs are monitored during 
exercise testing and recovery; testing is  stopped if termination criteria are  
achieved.  
b)  Six-minute walk test: Participants are instr ucted to "cover as much  distance as 
they can" over a flat 100 foot walking surface demarcated  by traffic cones  
c)  The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) includes the following 
components: 1) Timed 4 -meter walk; 2) Repeated chair stand;  and 3) Balan ce 
tests. For each component , a score of 0 to 4 is assigned, with the sum of 
components comprising a final score  
d)  The Timed “Get Up and Go” Test: Beginning in a seated position in a  chair, 
participants are asked to stand up, walk 6 feet, turn around,  return to the chair, 
and sit down. The  time required to complete this task is recorded.  
e)  Muscle Power: 1 -Repetition Maximum (RM) Muscle Power for  a leg press will be 
determined using KeiserA420 pneumatic resistance equipment.

C. QUALITY OF LIFE AND SYMPTOM BURDEN  
These elements will be assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study Short -Form 36 
(SF-36) and the Memorial  Symptom Assessmen t Scale Short Form (MSAS -SF), 
respectively. The BDI, a 21 -item self -report scale validated in individuals with CKD,  will 
be administered at the screening visit and in follow -up to assess symptoms of 
depression.   The San Diego Claudication Questionnaire is a 9-item scale to assess for  
symptoms and severity of Claudication symptoms.  
 
D. SLEEP ASSESSMENT  
The sleep quality and patterns of study participants will be assessed using the validated 
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inde x as well as the sleep actigraphy monit or.  This will be 
administer ed at baseline and follow -up assessments.   The sleep actigraphy monitor will 
be worn for approximately 5 days and nights at Baseline and 12 -month follow up.  This 
device is worn on the wrist and measures movement and ambient lig ht.  During the 
period which  the participant is wearing the actigraph, they will be instructed to maintain a 
sleep log to increase the interpretability of the actigraphy results.   
 
E. HEALTH STATUS  
Health status of study participants will be assessed usin g the EQ -5D-5L measure.  Thi s 
is a short validated measure for participant’s subjective assessment of their health 
status.  This will allow for analysis of quality -adjusted life years  in future cost 
effectiveness analyses . 
 
F. VASCULAR HEALTH AND INFLAMMAT ORY MARKERS  
Interleukin -6 (IL-6) and high -sensitivity C -reactive protein (hs -CRP) will be measured on 
plasma stored at -80C.   The v ascular health a ssessment utilizes Laser Doppler 
Flowmetry (LDF) to measure microvascular endothelial function. LDF uses a la ser light  
source and doppler  shift effect to non -invasively measure microvascular blood flow, 
permitting measurement of the relative change in  microcirculatory perfusion in response 
to various interventions. The thermal -hyperemic response will be used, ind uced by 
heating the probe  on forearm skin to 44C for over two minutes; LDF flow is recorded for

blood pressure cuff to occlude blood flow to the arm of interest for 4 m inutes, at which 
point the c uff will be released and the return of blood flow will be assessed over the 
subsequent minutes.   
 
G. OTHER VASCULAR RISK FACTORS  
Insulin concentration will be measured in stored plasma by radioimmunoassay (Millipore, 
Billerica,  MA). Total  cholesterol and triglycerides will be measured using enzymatic 
methods; LDL cholesterol will be calculated using the Friedwald equation;  total HDL 
cholesterol and HDL sub -fractions will be measured after precipitation with dextran 
sulfate. For blood pressure, the average of the  second and third of three seated 
measures will be recorded; the dose of each antihypertensive medication will also be 
recorded.  
 
H. Physical Activity Assessment  
Participant’s daily physical activity will be assessed at ba seline and follow -up.  This 
assessment will be made using the CHAMPS, a validated questionnaire and through 
Step Activity Monitoring (SAM).  The SAM is a device worn around the ankle which 
measures movement.  This will be worn for 5 days in conjunction wit h the sleep 
actigraph.     
 
VII. Data Management.   
Data collection will use the StudyTrax data system, a secure Web -based application 
designed to provide easy user access and monitoring, incorporating role -based access 
for multi -user studies.  StudyTrax will b e housed on dedicated Tufts servers, and 
accessed using standard browsers.  Working with study investigators, Tufts computing 
staff, guided by the study biostatistician, Hocine Tighiouart, will create data entry 
screens, data and range checks, and standard  reports as well as create p rograms to link 
existing data and to merge with other electronically transmitted data as needed.  
Following informed consent, participants’ data will be entered into the StudyTrax system 
with generation of a study ID.  Each cent er will perform double data entry, followed by 
assessment of data discrepancies, and subsequent correction of any errors.  
 
VIII. Adverse Event Reporting  
Given the minimal risk nature of the current study (such that participants could engage in 
similar inte rventions in an unsupervised  fashion outside of the purview of this research 
study), we will be utilizing the Internal Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) of the 
Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center (GRECC) of the VA Maryland 
Healthcare System.

In general, the GRECC and Division of Gerontology investigators, and support staff, 
work in a collaborative fashion on GRECC sponsored protocols.  This collaboration 
enhances the quality of the research and strengthens the medical oversight of the 
research. The degree of cross -collaboration varies conside rably from protocol to 
protocol. Any internal review of the protocols by Division of Gerontology faculty will result 
in some degree of conflict of interest. However, as licensed physicians in Maryland and 
the Federal Government,  they practice good clinical  practice in reaching all decisions to 
insure the proper, safe conduct of research in the GRECC and Division of Gerontology  
 
To minimize conflicts with the current protocol, Dr. Katzel, a co -investigator of this 
protocol, Dr. Go ldberg, a co -investigator of  this protocol, and Kathy Brandt, a recipient of 
salary support from the GRECC, will be excluded from the study evaluation process.          
 
Furthermore, to avoid conflict, the GRECC Internal SMB will provide its findings to bo th 
the GRECC internal and ex ternal advisory committees.  
 
Review Process  
DSM review and reporting will occur semi -annually (twice per year), and safety 
monitoring results will be reported both to the relevant IRBs as well as to the GRECC 
internal and extern al advisory committees.  The re will be no interim efficacy analysis.   
 
Data reviewed will include:  
• Adverse Events, both serious and non -serious  
• Patient Charts/Clinical Summaries when indicated  
• Laboratory Tests  
• Procedure Reports as part of QA audits  
• Enrol lment Numbers as part of rev iew of SAEs  
• QA audit results, operating procedures and consent forms when indicated  
 
The DSMB is just one part of the administrative oversight of research that will be 
undertaken in this study and that occurs in the Division of Gerontology at the Universit y 
of Maryland.

Protocol Version  4 
12 of 16 May 17, 201 6 As per IRB requirements all protocols are reviewed for safety and scientific merit prior to 
their submission to the IRB. In general each protocol is reviewed by 3 reviewers.   All 
procedures are reviewed by the res earch testing staff and sign ed off by the GRECC 
Director.   The PI presents the protocols at the weekly Geriatric Assessment Clinic 
conference to their fellow GRECC investigator, nursing and metabolic staff prior to 
implementation.   Quality management plans  will be reviewed with the G RECC quality 
management nurse specialist.  
 
The DSMB reviews will be open to the investigator as this clinical trial is not placebo -
controlled and is not blinded to the investigators.   The reviews will be HIPAA compliant.  
In rev iewing adverse events, the b oard will have access to patient identifiers and PHI as 
needed.  All specific patient identifiers will be removed in the DSMB report.   The DSMB 
will review the data described above from both the University of Maryland (“Maryland ”) 
site and from the Tufts M edical Center (“Boston”) site.    Consistent with other exercise 
intervention trials and in keeping with the minimal risk nature of this trial, there are no 
formal interim stopping criteria.  
 
The major focus of the monitoring b oard is on safety, particula rly on expected and 
unexpected adverse events directly attributable to participation in the research; i.e. 
phlebitis due to an IV line insertion, fall during treadmill testing, etc.  All protocols will 
adhere to good clinical pr actice guidelines.  In the r eview of the adverse events, the 
board will review policies and procedures and make recommendation accordingly.  If 
there is a serious unexpected adverse event that brings into question the safety of a 
procedure or of the protoc ol, the board will temporari ly suspend new enrollment into the 
protocol and work in concert with both the Maryland and Tufts IRBs as well as the VA 
Research Committee to further evaluate the situation and determine if additional steps 
are necessary.  
 
All adverse events will also be r eported directly to the Tufts Medical Center IRB in 
accordance with their guidelines.  All unexpected serious adverse events will be reported 
to the IRB with proper paperwork within 5 days of the event.  Other serious adverse 
events will be reported with p roper paperwork within 15 days of the event.  All other 
adverse events will be reported during continuing reviews of the study.  
 
Safety and Event Reporting (Exercise Intervention)  
  
All adverse events and serious adverse events will be reviewed by the stud y doctor at 
each site and reported to the site principal investigator.   Serious adverse events will be 
reviewed immediately and reported to the IRB.   All adverse events will be reviewed by 
the site principal investigators monthl y.   
 
Adverse event monitori ng:  Study subjects will be monitored for the occurrence of 
events defined as any undesirable experience.   Subjects will be monitored from the day 
of enrollment throughout the duration of the study period.   All adverse events wi ll be 
recorded on an adverse  event case report form and will include a description of all 
undesirable experiences, required interventions, subject’s condition after the event, an 
estimate of the extent of injury and potential strategies to prevent future o ccurrences.   
The Principal I nvestigator will classify the relationship of the study protocol to the event 
(see below).   As stated, the Principal Investigator, in consultation with the study 
physician, is responsible for reporting serious adverse events (li fe threatening, new,

13 of 16 May 17, 201 6 serious  or permanent disability, new kidney failure, death) to the IRB.   Other adverse 
events will be summarized annually for the IRB.  
 
Adverse events:  In the current protocol, an adverse event or experience is defined as 
any health -related unfavorable or uninten ded medical occurrence that happens during 
the process of screening, the study assessments and during the randomized 
intervention. Minor adverse events are defined as conditions that may be unpleasant 
and bothersome to the parti cipant, such as a head cold,  but that do not require 
discontinuing participant in the study.   Examples of minor adverse events include but are 
not limited to the following:   anxiety, fatigue, decreased appetite, insomnia, dizziness, 
muscle or joint stiffne ss, muscle strain or sorenes s, ankle or knee pain, foot pain, and 
other minor symptoms that may have restricted the participant’s usual activities for at 
least ½ day. Minor adverse events will be reported to the IRB during annual 
recertification.  
 
Serious  adverse events:  In the curr ent protocol, serious adverse events are defined to 
include: death, a life -threatening adverse drug experience, inpatient hospitalization or 
prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapa city, or 
new kidney failure.  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious adverse experiences if 
they might jeopardize the participant or might require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes in the definition. An example of this in the current protocol 
is an injurious fall resulting in a fracture that occurred in the HNRCA during a study visit. 
All serious adverse events will be reported promptly to the IRB.  
 
The Principal Inv estigator, in consultation with the study physician, will classify the 
relationship of the study protocol to the event as follows:  
 
Not Related:  The event is clearly related to factors such as the subject’s clinical state, 
not to interventions associated w ith the study protocol.  
 
Remote:  The event was most likely related to factors such as the subject’s clinical state, 
not to interventions associated with the study protocol.  
 
Possible:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequ ence from interventions 
asso ciated with the study protocol but is possibly related to such factors as the subject’s 
clinical state.  
 
Probable:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from interventions 
associated with the study protocol and cannot  be reasonably explained by factors such 
as the subject’s clinical state.  
 
Highly Probable:  The event follows a reasonable sequence from interventions 
associated with the study protocol and cannot be reasonably explained by factors such 
as the subject’s cl inical state.  
 
Data safety a nd monitoring plan:   If any of the blood draws show lab values newly and 
unexpectedly different from the normal range, these events will be reported to the 
principal investigator and the study physician.   All adverse events will  be reported to the 
principa l investigator or a co -investigator within 5 working days of the incident.   All 
serious adverse events will be reported promptly to the IRB.

Potential adverse events for study related activities and interventions are explaine d to 
each participant by tra ined study personnel during the informed consent process. Each 
participant is instructed to report the occurrence of an adverse event at scheduled data 
collection times. Participants also have access to study personnel at other times to 
report serious adve rse events or concerns about the safety of participating in this study.

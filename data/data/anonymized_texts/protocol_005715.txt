Parallel -arm,Safet y, Tolerability
,and Pharmacokinetic Trial of 
Aripiprazole Intramuscular Depot Administered in the Gluteal 
Muscle in Adult Subjects W ith Schizophrenia or Bip olar I 
Disorder
Clinical Phase: Phase 1b
Treatment 
Indication:Schizophrenia and b ipolar I disorder
Objective s: Primary:
To determine the safet y and tolerability of multiple -dose 
administrations of aripiprazole in adult subjects with 
schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder .
To establish the similarity  of aripiprazole concentrations on 
the last day  of the dosing interval following the final 
administration of aripiprazole into the gluteal muscle site in 
adult subjects with schizophrenia or bipolar I diso rder. 
To establish the similarity  of aripiprazole exposure over the 
dosing interval following the administration of aripiprazole 
into the gluteal muscle site in adult subjects with 
schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder .
Secondary:
To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of aripiprazole.
To determine aripiprazole concentrations 7 day s (C 7) and 
14days (C 14)after the first dose of aripiprazole for subjects 
enrolled to the robust sampling schedule .
To obtain information on the efficacy  of aripiprazole over the 
course of 32weeks.
Trial Design: This is a phase 1b, open -label, multiple -dose, randomized, 
parallel -arm, multicenter trial. After a screening period of up to 
30 day s, eligible s ubjects will be randomized (1:1) to receive 
multiple doses of either aripiprazole 2 month ( 2M) long-acting 
inject able (LAI) 960 mg (4 injections) or aripiprazole I M depot 
400mg (8 injections) over the course of 32 weeks. A ripiprazole

at28-day ( ± 2 days) intervals. A final visit will occur 
56(±2)days after the last dose of aripiprazole 2M L AI 960 mg 
or 28 (± 2) day s after the last dose of aripiprazole IM depot 
400mg.
Randomization to the 2 trial treatments will be stratified by  the 
PK sampling schedule (robust or sparse ) and disease ty pe 
(schizophrenia or bipolar I  disorder). Four to 6trial sites will be 
designated as Robust Sampling Tria l Sites; all other trial sites 
will be designated as Sparse Sampling Trial Sites. Up to 
76subjects ( 38 per treatment group ) will be enrolled to the r obust 
sampling schedule and 182 subjects (91 per treatment group) will 
be enrolled to the sparse sampling schedule. Ifenrollment of the 
number of subjects required for therobust sampling schedule is 
completed, the Robust Sampling Trial S ites may  enroll additional 
subjects to the sparse sampling schedule with approval from the 
sponsor.
Blood samples for PK analy ses willbedrawn from subjects at 
both Robust and Sparse Sampling Trial Sites after the first 
(Day 1) and fourth (Day 169) doses of investigational medicinal 
product (IMP) for subjects randomized to aripiprazole 2M L AI 
960 mg ,and after the fi rst(Day  1), seventh (Day  169), and eighth
(Day  197) doses of IMP for subjects randomized to aripiprazole 
IM depot 400 mg. 
Subjects enrolled to the robust sampling schedule who are 
randomized to aripiprazole 2M L AI 960 mg must be housed in 
the unit for 21 days after the first and fourth doses of IMP and 
will be outpatients for the rest of the trial. Subjects randomized to 
aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg will stay  in the unit for 21 day s 
after administration of the first , seventh, and eighth doses of IMP.
Subjects who are not able to accommodate the scheduled stay s in 
the unit may  be permitted to have some visits as outpatients with 
approval from the medical monitor. For an y outpatient visit, an 
unscheduled C -
SSRS will be performed.
Subjects enrolled to the sparse sampling schedule will be 
outpatients for administration of all doses of IMP; however, they  
may be housed in the unit for up to 21 day s after administration 
of the first dose of IMP at the discretion of the investigator. 
Subjects who do not have a history  of tolerating aripiprazole will 
receive 
3single 10-mg doses of oral aripiprazole on 
3consecutive day s (total of 30 mg) in addition to their current

Confidential --Proprietary Information 4 Protocol Version 3.0, 31 Jul 2019unit during these 3 days at the investigator’s discretion.
At the time of administration of the firstdose of IMP, subjects 
will begin a 7-to 14 -day period (oral overlap) whe rethey will 
transition from their current oral antips ychoti c to include 
injections of I MP. S ubjects currentl y stabilized on a non -
aripiprazole oral antips ychotic who are enrolled to a sparse 
sampling schedule will continue on the irmedication and subjects 
who are enrolled to a robust sampling schedule will switch to
10to 20 mg oral aripiprazole (dose determined b y the 
investigator )
.
During oral overlap, subjects will take their oral antipsy chotic
medications concurrentl y with I MP for 7 daysafter the first
administration of aripiprazole 2M L AI 960 mgor 14daysafter 
the first administration of aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg.Subjects 
stabilized on oral aripiprazole as their current antipsy chotic 
medication will continue treatment concurrentl y with I MP at an 
adjusted dose 
for either 7 or 14 day s. The o ral antipsy chotic will
be discontinued after 7 day s of administration of aripiprazole 2M 
LAI 960 mg and after 14 days of administration of aripiprazole 
IM depot 400 mg.
There will be n o oral overlap for subjects who are taking Abilify  
Maintena ®as their current antipsy chotic medication . Subjects 
will not be permitted entry to the trial if taking an LAI other than 
Abilify  Maintena.
Subjects with a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder who are taking a 
mood stabilizer (lithium, valproate, lamotrigine) will be 
permitted to stay  on their mood stabilizer over the course of the 
trial, and if applicable, to continue treatment with their 
antidepressant unless the medication is prohibited during the t rial 
(fluoxetine, fluoxetine/olanzapine).
Subjects may  resume treatment on their previous oral non -
aripiprazole antipsy chotic after Day  28 if there is evidence of 
clinical deterioration based on the judgment of the investigator. If 
a decision is made that a subject may  resume previous oral non -
aripiprazole antipsy chotic medication, the investigator will 
continue to monitor the subject for safet y and clinical stability.
Subject 
Population:The trial population will include male and female subjects 
between the ages of 18 to 64 y ears of age, inclusive, with a 
current diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder as defined 
by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
Fifth Edition ( DSM - 5) criteria. Approxima tely 258 subjects 
(129 per treatment group) will be enrolled into the trial with the

Statistical 
Methods:Determination of sample size:
To establish the similarity  in primary  PK variables, the lower 
bound of the 90% confidence interval (CI) of the geometric 
means ratio (GMR) of C 56and AUC 0-56after the fourth dose of 
aripiprazole 2M LAI 960 mg toC28after the eight hdose and the 
sum of AUC 0-28values after the seventh and eighth dose sof 
aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg should be greater than 80%, 
respectivel y. It is estimated that a total of at least 100 subjects (ie, 
50 per group) completing the trial will have at least 80% power 
to ensure that the lower limit of the 90% CI  of the GMR of C 56
after the fourth dose o f aripiprazole 2M L AI 960 mg (test) toC28
after the eighth dose of aripiprazole I Mdepot 400 mg (reference) 
is greater than 0.
80, assuming the actual GMR of concentrations 
is 1.0 and the coefficient of variation (CV) is 46%.
Among these 100 subjects, 30completers enrolled to the robust 
sampling 
schedule will provide at least 80% power to ensure that 
the lower limit of the 90% CI of the GMR of AUC 0-56of 
aripiprazole 2M LAI 960 mg (test) to the sum of AUC 0-28values 
of aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg (reference) after the seventh and 
eighth doses is greater than 0.80, assuming the actual GMR of 
concentrations is 1.1 5and the CV is 40%.
 
 
To ensure adequate power of the trial, an interim analy sis may be 
conducted b y the Interim Analy sis Review Committee (IARC). 
The final sample size could be increased as per recommendation 
of the IARC .
Assuming a dropout rate of 34%, approximately  152 to

only), YMRS (bipolar subjects only ), and CGI -BP (bipolar 
subjects only ) will be summarized for the efficacy sample at each 
visit by  treatment group and disease t ype, if applicable . These 
analyses will be performed for both the last observation carried 
forward and observed case data. In addition, the linear 
mixed -effects model will be used to explore the effect of the 
treatment and change from baseline over time , as applicable .
Trial Duration: The trial will consist of a screening period of up to 30 day sanda 
treatment period of 169 (± 2) day swith a follow -up period of 
56(± 2) day s after administration of the final dose for the 
aripiprazole 2M LAI 960mg treatment group ,or a treatment 
period of 197 day s with a follow -up period of 28 (± 2) day s after 
administration of the final dose for the aripiprazole IM depot 
400mg treatment group. Individual participation for both 
treatment groups will be approximately  255
(± 2) days.Clinical Study Report 031-201-00181 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 031- 201-00181
Confidential --Proprietary Information 22 Protocol Version 3.0, 31 Jul 20191 Introduction
Aripiprazole (OPC -14597, L u AF41155) is a dopamine serotonin sy stem stabilizer, for 
which efficacy  is thought to be mediated through a combination of partial agonism at 
dopamine D 2and serotonin 5
-HT1Areceptors and antagonism at serotonin 5 -HT2A
receptors.
Abilify  Maintena ®, an extended- release suspension for once monthl y intramuscular ( IM)
injection, is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia at a dose of 400 mg once 
monthly  (deltoid or gluteal I M administration).1In addition, Abilify  Maintena was 
approved b y the United States (US) Food and Drug Adm inistration (FDA) on 27 Jul 2017 
for the maintenance monotherap
y treatment of bipolar I disorder in adults (Supplemental 
New Drug Application [NDA] 202971 S-010 submitted 28 Sep 2016).
This trial will examine the safet y, tolerability ,and pharmacokinetics (PK)ofmultiple 
doses of aripiprazole 2month ( 2M) long-acting inject able (LAI) 960 mg injected inthe 
gluteal muscle in adult subjects with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder 
over the course 
of 32 weeks . The aripiprazole 2M L AI 960mg formulation isan extended -release 
presentation inten ded for dosing every  2months. The extension of the dosing interval for 
aripiprazole 2M LAI 960mg is primaril y through an increase in the dose while 
maintaining minimum aripiprazole concentrations that are comparable to aripiprazole 
IMdepot 400 mg after multiple doses.
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for more detailed information on 
nonclinical data and clinical data for aripiprazole.1A brief summary  is included below .

1.2 Clinical Data
As of 01 Jun 2018, approximately
 3591 adult subjects have been exposed to Abilify  
Maintena in all clinical trials and the safet y has been well established. T he Abilify  
Maintena safety  profile is similar to that of the Abilify  oral tablets, with the exception of 
injection site reactions, which is an IM depot -specific adverse event (AE); however, the 
injection site pain does not represent a particular safet y con cern.1
The efficacy  of Abilify  Maintena for the treatment of schizophrenia was established in:
A phase 3, short -term (12 -week), randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial 
in acutel y relapsed adult subjects with s
chizophrenia (Trial 31-12- 291)
A phase 3, long -term (52 -
week), double- blind, placebo -controlled, 
randomized- withdrawal trial in adult subjects with schizophrenia (Trial 31-07-246)
A phase 3, long -term (38 -week), randomized, double -
blind, active- controlled trial in 
adult subjects with schizophrenia (Trial 31-07- 247)
In Trial 31 -
12-291, the primary  endpoint was the change from baseline in Positive and 
Negative S yndrome Scale (PANSS) total score to Week 10. The key secondary endpoint 
was the change from basel
ine in Clinical Global Impression - Severit y (CGI-S) 
assessment scale to Week 10. Abilify  Maintena was superior to placebo in improving the 
PANSS total score at the end of Week 10 (least squares mean change from 
baseline = −26.8 for Abilify  Maintena [400 to 300 mg] and least squares mean change 
from baseline = −11.7 for placebo). Abilify  Maintena also showed improvement in 
symptoms represented b y the CGI -S score mean change from baseline to Week 10.Clinical Study Report 031-201-00181 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 031- 201-00181
Confidential --Proprietary Information 27 Protocol Version 3.0, 31 Jul 2019For Trial 31 -
07-246, in addition to the PANSS and CGI -S, clinical ratings during this 
trial included the Clinical Global I mpression -
Improvement scale and CGI- S of Suicide 
scale. The primary  efficacy  endpoint was time from randomization to relapse. The trial 
was terminated earl y because maintenance of efficacy wa s demonstrated at a preplanned 
interim analy sis. The final analy sis demonstrated a statistically  significantly longer time 
to relapse in subjects randomized to the Abilify  Maintena group compared to 
placebo- treated subjects. In the placebo group 39.6% of t he subjects had progressed to 
impending relapse, while in the Abilify  Maintena group impending relapse occurred in 
10% of the subjects. The key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint, percentage of subjects meeting 
the relapse criteria, was statistically  significantl y lower in subjects randomized to the 
Abilify  Maintena group (10%) than in the placebo group (40%).
In addition to the above, effica cy was demonstrated in Trial 31-07- 247 for registration of 
Abilify  Maintena in the European Union. The results of analy sis of the primary  efficacy  
endpoint, the estimated proportion of subjects experiencing impending relapse by  the end 
of Week 26 showed that Abilify
 Maintena 400 mg/300 mg is noninferior to Abilify  oral 
tablets 10 to 30 mg. The estimated relapse rate b y the end of Week 26 was 7.12% for 
Abilify  Maintena and 7.76% for Abilify  oral tablets 10 to 30 mg. Further, the 
noninferiority  of Abilify  Maintena compared to Abilify  oral tablets 10 to 30 mg was 
supported by  the results of the anal ysis of the PANSS.
The efficacy  and safet y of Abilify  Maintena for the treatment of bipolar Idisorder was 
established in aphase 3, 52-week, randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled trial 
(Trial 31-08-250) . The primary  efficacy  endpoint was the time to recurrence of any  mood 
episode ,as measured in subjects with bipolar I disorder who had maintained stability  on 
aripiprazole IM depot for at least 8 weeks. The time to recurrence of any  mood episode 
was statistically  significantly  delay ed with aripiprazole I M depot treatment compared 
with placebo treatment (log -rank test p < 0.0001). Aripiprazole IM depot treatment 
significantl y reduced the risk of recurrence of an y mood episode over 1 year compared 
with placebo treatment by approximately  half (hazard ratio = 0.451 [Cox proportional 
hazard model]; 95% confidence interval [ CI], 0.299 - 0.678). The proportion of subjects 
who met the criteria for recurrence of an y mood episode was significantl y lower with 
aripiprazole IM depot treatment compared with placebo treatment (26.5% versus 51.1%, 
Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel test p < 0.0001).
1.3 Pharmacokinetics 
Abilify  Maintena activity is presumably  primarily  due to the parent drug, aripiprazole, 
and to a lesser extent, to its major metabolite, dehydro -aripiprazole, which has been Clinical Study Report 031-201-00181 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

29% of the parent drug exposure in plasma.
The plasma aripiprazole concentrations after single -and multiple -dose administration of 
Abilify  Maintena 
arewell established. The aripiprazole 2- month RTU formulation at the 
960mg dose is expected to provide plasma concentrations of aripiprazole within the 
concentration range of Abilify  Maintena.
Aripiprazole absorption into the systemic circulation is slow and prolonged following 
Abilify  Mainte na administration due to low solubility  of aripiprazol e particles. The 
average absorption half -life of aripiprazole from Abilify  Maintena is 28 days. The 
absorption of aripiprazole from Abilify  Maintena was complete relative to the 
IMstandard (i mmediate -release) formulation. The dose -adjusted C maxvalues for the 
depot formulation were approximately 5% of C maxfrom the IM standard formulation. 
Following a single -dose administration of Abilify Maintena in the deltoid and gluteal 
muscle, the extent of absorpt ion (area under the concentration -time curve [AUC ]) was 
similar for both injection sites, but the rate of absorption (C max) was higher following 
administration to the deltoid muscle.
Based on results from trials with oral administration of aripiprazole, ar ipiprazole is 
widely  distributed throughout the body  with an apparent volume of distribution of 
4.9 l/kg, indicating extensi ve extravascular distribution. At therapeutic concentrations, 
aripiprazole and deh ydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to se rum proteins, 
binding primaril y to albumin.
Elimination of aripiprazole is mainly  through hepatic metabolism involving 2 cytochrome 
P450 (CYP ) isozy mes, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Aripiprazole is not a substrate of 
CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2E1 
enzy mes. Aripiprazole also does not undergo direct glucuronidation.
Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labeled aripiprazole, approximately  27% of the 
administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and a pproximately  60% in th e 
feces. Less than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and 
approximately  18% was recovered unchanged in the feces.
Based on apopulation PK evaluation of Abilify  Maintena, the total body  clearance of 
aripiprazole was 3.71 L/h in extensiv e metabolizers of CYP2D6 and approximately 
1.88 L/h (approximately  50% lower) in poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 .1

curve from time zero to infinity [AUC ∞] and area under the concentration -time curve 
from time zero to time t [AUC t])than previously  observed following single -dose 
administration of 400 mg Abilify  Maintena to the gluteal muscle. The ratio of 
dehy dro-aripiprazole to aripiprazole for mean AUC ∞after administration of 780 mg or 
1200 mg aripiprazole LAI (0.34 and 0.31, respectively ) was similar to that observed 
following administration of 400 mg Abilify Maintena ( 0.28). Administration of 780 mg 
or 1200 mg aripiprazole LAI resulted in a sl ightly less than proportional increase in 
aripiprazole and deh ydro-aripip
razole C maxand a slightly  more than dose proportional 
increase in exposure (AUC tand AUC ∞) based on mean values corrected for dose. 
Administration of 780 mg aripiprazole LAI resulted in shorter median t maxvalues for 
aripiprazole (25.1 days v ersus41.0 day s) and dehy dro-aripiprazole (29.6 days versus
55.0 days) when compared to the 1200 mg dose. Following administration of 780 mg or 
1200 mg aripiprazole 2M L AI, the mean terminal phase elimination half -life ( t1/2) values 
for aripiprazole (22.1 days 
and 20.0 day s, respectively ) and deh ydro-aripiprazole 
(25.5 days and 22.9 day s, respectivel y) were comparable, and similar to the median t 1/2
following administration of 400 mg Abilify  Maintena (24.0 days). A consistent increase 
in aripiprazole concentrati ons followed by  a decline and a secondary  peak in 
concentrations were observed following administration of 780 mg or 1200 mg 
aripiprazole LAI to the gluteal muscle based on examination of mean, median, and 
individual concentration -time profiles.

provided in Figure 3.1-1.
Randomization to the 2 trial treatments will be stratified by  the PK sampling schedule
(robust or sparse) and disease t ype (schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder) .Four to 6 trial 
sites 
will be designated as Robust Sampling Trial Sites; all other trial sites will be 
designated as Sparse Sampling Trial Sites. Up to 76 subjects (38 per treatment group) 
will be enrolled to the robust sampling schedule and 182 subjects (91 per treatment 
group) will b e enrolled to the sparse sampling schedule. If enrollment of the number of 
subjects required for the robust sampling schedule is completed, the Robust Sampling 
Trial Sites may  enroll additional subjects to the sparse sampling schedule with approval 
from the sponsor. An interim anal ysis may be conducted to ensure adequate power of the 
trialSection 7.1.1. Based on the possible sample size re - estimation in the proposed 
interim analy sis, fewer subjects may  be enrolled.
Blood samples for PK analy seswill be drawn from subjects a t both Robust and Sparse 
Sampling Trial Sites after the first dose (Day  1) and fourth (final) dose (Day  169) of 
investigational medicinal product (IMP) for subjects randomized to aripiprazole 2M L AI 
960 mg ,and after the first dose (Day  1), seventh dose (Day  169), and eighth (final) dose 
(Day  197) of IMP for subjects randomized to aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg. 
Subjects enrolled to the robust sampling schedule who are randomized to aripiprazole 2M 
LAI 960 mgmust be housed in the unit for 21 days after the first and fourth doses of 
IMP, and will be outpatients for the rest of the trial. Subjects randomized to aripipr azole 
IM depot 400 mg will stay  in the unit for 21 day s after administration of the first, 
seventh, and eighth doses of IMP. Subjects who are not able to accommodate the 
scheduled stay s in the unit may  be permitted to have some visits as outpatients with 
approval from the medical monitor . For an y outpatient visit, an unscheduled C -SSRS will 
be performed.
Subjects enrolled to the sparse sampling schedule will be outpatients for administration of 
all doses of IMP; however, they may  be housed in the unit for up to 21 day s after
administration of the first 
dose of IMP at the discretion of the investigator. 
Subjects who do not have a history of tolerating aripiprazole will undergo testing to 
determine tolerabilit y prior to enrollment. Details of tolerability  testing are provided in 
Section 3.2.2.
At the time of administration of 
the first dose of IMP, subjects will begin a 7- to 14 -day 
period (oral overlap) where they  will transition from their current oral antipsy chotic to 
include injections of IMP. Details of the oral overlap period are provided in Section 3.2.3. Clinical Study Report 031-201-00181 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

3.2.1 Investigational Medicinal Product
The test IMP (aripiprazole 
2M LAI ) administered in this trial will be supplied as 
aripiprazole IM depot 300 mg/mL  RTU single -dose vials. The reference IMP will be 
aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg single -dose lyophilized vials.  
 
 
 
 
Subjects will be randomized (1:1)
to receive multiple doses of:
Aripiprazole 2M LAI 960mg (test) - 2-month injection ( total of 4 injections), 
administered every  56days (±2 day s) over the course of 
32 weeks.
Aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg (reference) - 1-month injection ( total of 8injections), 
administered every  28days (±2 day s) over the course of 32 weeks.
The IMP will be administered as a single injection in the gluteal muscle for a total of 
4 (960 mg/injection) or 8(400 mg/injection) injections . Due to possible safe ty and 
tolerability  issues, a one -time dose reduction is allo wed as outlined below:
Aripiprazole 2M LAI 960mg: a dose decrease to 6 60mg. If the subject has had a 
decrease to 660 mg, a one -time increase back to 960mg is then allowed. 
Aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg : a dose decrease to 300 mg. If the subject has had a 
decrease to 300 mg, a one -time increase back to 400 mg is then allowed. 
Syringes and needle swill be provided for the injection of IMP .Needles are selected 
based on the subject’s body weight recorded on Day  1and on each subsequent visit , as

Subjects who do not have a history of tolerating aripiprazole will receive 3 single 10 -mg
doses of oral aripiprazole on 3 consecutive day s (
total of 30 mg)in addition to their 
current oral antips ychotic, mood stabilizer, and if applicable, antidepressant for at least
14days prior to the first administration of IMP to establish tolerability . Subjects may  be 
housed in the unit during these 3 day s at the investigator’s discretion. 
3.2.3 Oral Overlap
At the time of administration of the firstdose of IMP, subjects will begin a 7 -to 14 -day 
period (oral overlap) where they  will transition from their current oral antipsy chotic to 
include injections of IMP ,according to the scenarios described in Table 3.2.3 -1.
Subjects currentl y stabilized on a non -aripiprazole oral antipsy chotic who are enrolled to 
a sparse sampling schedule will continue on their medication and subjects who are 
enrolled to a robust sampling schedule will switch to 10 to 20 mg oral aripiprazole (dose 
determined b y the investigator). Subjects will take their oral antips ychotic medication s
concurrently  with I MP for 7 day s after the first administration of aripiprazole 2M L AI 
960 mg or 14 day s after the first administration of aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg. The 
oral antipsy chotic will be discontinued after 7 days 
of administration of aripiprazole 2M 
LAI 960 mg and after 14 days of administration of aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg.
For s ubjects currently  stabilized on oral aripiprazole, the recommended supplemental oral 
aripiprazole dose will be reduced to10 mg/day  with the first dose of IMP for subjects
with a previous dose of 10 to 20 mg/day  or to 15 mg/day  for subjects with a previous 
dose of > 20 to 30 mg/day (Table 3.2.3-2 ).
There will be no oral overlap for subjects who are taking Abilify  Maintena® as their 
current antipsy chotic medica tion. Subjects who are on Abilify  Maintena as their current 
antipsy chotic cannot be enrolled until their next scheduled dose is required as specified in 
the label ,and they cannot receive IMP an y earlier than 26 days after the last Abilify  
Maintena 
injection. Inthis scenario ,the investigator should carefully  consider the 
screening period and the timing of randomization in relation to the first dose of IMP and 
previous dose of Abilify  Maintena.
Given the addition of a second antips ychotic, investiga tors should consider reducing the 
dose of the current oral antipsy chotic, mood stabilizer, or antidepressant medications to 
the mid to lower range of the recommended dose range described in the labeling.

The trial population will include male and female subjects between the ages of 18 to 
64years of age, inclusive, with a current diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder 
as defined b y the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition 
(DSM -5) criteria. Approximately  258 subjects (129 per treatment group) will be enrolled 
into the trial with the expectation that approximately  170 subjects (85 per treatment 
group) will complete the trial. An interim anal ysis may  be conducte d to ensure adequate 
power of the trial. Based on the possible sample size re
-estimation in the proposed 
interim analy sis, fewer subjects may  be enrolled. 
Subjects entering the trial must have demonstrated prior tolerability  to aripiprazole. I n 
addition, subjects must be clinically stable (based on investigator judgment, 
subject/caregiver report, and/or documentation) for at least 2 months prior to screening 
AND must be on a stable dose of 1 of the following oral atypical antips ychotic 
medications for at least 2 months prior to screening: aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, 
risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, paliperidone, cariprazine, lurasidone, ziprasidone, or 
asenapine .Other oral non- aripiprazole, antips ychotic medications may  be allowed if 
approved b y the medical monitor and sponsor; however, clozapine will not be allowed. 
Additionally ,subjects with bipolar I  disorder, who are stabilized on their current 
medications for at least 2 months prior to screening may  continue their mood stabilizer 
(lithium, valpr oic acid, lamotrigine) and antidepressant (citalopram, escitalopram, 
sertraline). 
Subjects who are on Abilify  Maintena as their current antipsy chotic cannot be enrolled 
until their next scheduled dose is required as specified in the label ,and they cannot
receive IMP an y earlier than 26 days after the last Abilify  Maintena injection. Inthis 
scenario ,the 
investigator should carefull y consider the screening period and the timing of 
randomization in relation to the first dose of IMP and previous dose of Abilify Maintena.
Subjects taking oral aripiprazole or Abilify  Maintena as their current antipsy chotic 
medication cannot be enrolled to the robust sampling schedule (ie, subjects at these trial 
sites will not enter the screening period if they  are taking oral aripiprazole or Abilify  
Maintena).

trial and will be enrolled as needed.
The trial sites will maintain a list identify ing all subjects by  their IDnumber and initials.
Recruitment of replacement subjects for noncompleters will be at the discretion o f the 
sponsor. Noncompleters are 
defined as subjects who do not attend their last scheduled 
visit for PK sampling ( Section 3.10) .
3.4 Eligibility  Criteria
Exceptions for eligibility criteria will not be permitted during the trial, either by  the 
investigator or b y the medical monitor .
3.4.1
Informed Consent
Informed consent will be freel y obtained from all subjects (or their guardian or legally
acceptable representative, as applicable for local laws) and documented using an 
electronic informed consent sy stem . The ICF will be approved b y the same institutional 
review board (IRB) that approves this protocol
.
Each ICF will comply  with the I nternati onal Council for Harmonisation (I CH) Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) Guideline6and local regulatory  requirements. The investigator 
will ensure that the sponsor reviews and authorizes any  site-specific ICF used in the trial
before submission to the IRB.
Investigators may discuss trial availability  and the possibility  for entry  with a potential 
subject wi thout first obtaining consent. However, informed consent must be obtained and 
documented prior to initiation of an y procedu res that are performed solel y for the purpose 
of determining eligibility  for research, including withdrawal from current medication(s).
Potential subjects are free to refuse entry  into the trial, or withdraw from the trial at any  
time, without justificatio n, and there will be no consequences to their further care.
Prospective trial participants will be provided with controlled access to the electronic ICF 
application by  trial sitestaff. When the trial sitestaff and the participant agree that the 
participa nt has enough information to make an informed decision to participate, the 
participant will electronically  sign in the electronic I CF application and an electronic date 
and timestamp wil l be applied to the signature. The subject will be given a pr inted, si gned 
copy  of the ICF. Anyother parties required b y the I RB(trial sitestaff, witnesses, or 
legally  authorized representative) are also required to sign electronicall y and these 
signatures will be stored with the electronic ICF in accordance with the ICH GCP Clinical Study Report 031-201-00181 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

3.7.5 Efficacy  Assessments
The efficacy assessments including PANSS (schizophrenia subjects onl y), CGI -S, CGI -I, 
SWN -S,MADRS (bipolar subjects onl y), YMRS (bipolar subjects onl y), and CGI -BP 
(bipolar subjects onl y) will be administered by trained trial site staff at the time point s 
presented in the schedule of assessments (Table 3.7-1for sparse sampling and 
Table 3.7-2 for robust sampling) .All efficacy  assessments will be performed prior to 
PKblood draws and dosing, where applicable.
3.7.5.1 Positive and Negative Sy ndrome Scale Rating Criteria
The PANSS consists of 3 subscales containing a total of 30 sy mptom co nstructs.7For 
each s ymptom construct, severit y is rated on a 7
-point scale, with a score of 1 indicating 
the absence of s ymptoms and a score of 7 indicating extremel y severe s ymptoms. The 
symptom constructs for each su bscale are as follows:
1)Positive Subscale (7 positive sy mptom constructs: delusions, conceptual 
disorganization, hallucinatory  behavior, excitement, grandiosit y, 
suspiciousness/persecution, and hostility ),
2)Negative Subscale (7 negative sy mptom constructs: b lunted affect, emotional 
withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social withdrawal, difficult y in 
abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity  and flow of conversation, stereot yped 
thinking), and
3)General Psy chopathology  Subscale (16 sy mptom constructs: somat ic concern, 
anxiety , guilt feelings, tension, mannerisms and posturing, depression, motor 
retardation, uncooperativeness, unusual thought content, disorientation, poor 
attention, lack of judgment and insight, disturbance of volition, poor impulse 
control, preoccupation, and active social avoidance).
The PANSS will be administered using the Structured Clinical Interview (SCI ) PANSS.8

documentation is not acceptable.
3.7.5.2 Clinical Global Impression -Severity
The severit y of illness foreach subject will be rated using the CGI -S scale.9To assess 
CGI-
S, the rater or investigator will answer the following question: “Considering your 
total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally  ill is the subject at 
this time? ” Response choices include: 0 = not assessed; 1 = normal, not ill at all; 
2 =borderline mentally  ill; 3 = mildly  ill; 4 = moderatel y ill; 5 = markedl y ill; 
6 = s everel y ill; and 7 = among th e most extremely ill subjects.
3.7.5.3 Clinical Global Impression -Improvement Scale
The improvement of illness for each subject will be rated using the CGI -I scale.9To 
assess CGI -I, the rater or investigator will rate the subject’s total improvement whether or 
not it is due entirely  to drug treatm ent. All responses will be compared with the su bject’s 
condition at baseline. Response choices include: 0 = not a ssessed, 1 = very  much 
improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally  improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally  
worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse. Direct entry  of the CGI -I score on the 
eCRF without verifiable source do cumentation is not acceptable.
3.7.5.4 Subjective Well -being under Neuroleptic Treatment -Short Form
The subject’s feeling of their own well -being will be assessed using the 20- question 
SWN -S.8The SWN -S is a validated self -report instrument to evaluate th e subject’s 
perception of well-being while recei ving antipsy chotic medication. Subjects will 
complete the questionnaire without discussing an y of the items with others to avoid 
suggestive external manipulation. The questionnaire consists of 20 items and 5 subscales 
(mental functioning, social integration, emotional regulation, phy sical functioning, and 
self-control) whose items follow in random order. For items marked with a ‘+’, response 
choic es and scoring are as follows: not at all = 1, hardly  at all = 2 , a little = 3, somewhat 
= 4, much =5, very  much = 6. For items marked with a ‘ -’, the scoring is reversed; 
response choic es and scoring are as follows: not at all = 6, hardl y at all = 5, a little = 4, 
somewhat =3, much = 2, very  much = 1.

The YMRS11consists of 11 items assessing the core s ymptoms of mania and is based on 
the subject’s subjective report of his or her clinical condition. Additional information is 
based upon clinical observations made during the course of the clinical interview. Each 
item has 5 defined categories of severity  with 4 items gr aded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability , 
speech, content, and disruptive -
aggressive behavior) and 7 items graded on a 0 to 4 scale.
3.7.5.7 Clinical Global Impression -Bipolar Version
The CGI -BP scale refers to the global impression of the subject with respect to bi polar I 
disorder.12The scale rates the subject’s severity  of illness (CGI -BP-Severity : mania,
depression, and overall bipolar illness) and change from preceding phase (CGI -BP
change from preceding phase: mania, depression, and overall bipolar illness) based on a
7-point scale. Severit y of illness (CGI -BP-Severity ) should be rated at visits as indicated 
inthe schedule of assessments ( Table 3.7-1for sparse sampling and Table 3.7-2 for 
robust sampling) . Ateach visit other than Day  1 (baseline), the change from preceding 
phase (CGI -BP change from preceding phase) will be judged with respect to

The PK blood samples should be collected as early as is feasible to measure the plasma 
concentrations of aripiprazole .
Any value outside the normal range will be flagged for the attention of the investigator ,
who must indicate whether or not a flagged valu e is of clinical significance. If one or 
more values are questionabl
e, the test(s) may  be repeated. If the result of any  test (or 
repeat test, if done) is indicated as clinically  significant during the screening period, the 
subject will NOT be enrolled into the trial without the permission of the medica l monitor. 
In addition, follow- up unscheduled labs should be performed on clinicall y significant 
abnormalities d uring the course of the trial. Unscheduled laboratory  tests may  be repeated 
at an y time at the discretion of the investigator for appropriate medical care.
3.7.6.3 Physical Examination and Vital Sign A ssessments
Complete phy sical examinations will be performed at the time points presented in the 
schedule of assessment s (Table 3.7-1 for sparse sampling and Table 3.7-2 for robust 
sampling) . The principal investigators or designees are primarily  responsible for 
perfor ming the phy sical examination. Whenever possible, the same individual should 
perform all ph ysical examinatio ns for any  individual subject. If the appointed designee is 
to perform the ph ysical examination, he /she must be permitted b y local regulations and 
his/her name must be included on the FDA Form 1572 as principal investigator or 
sub
-investigator and must be listed on the trial sitedelegation of authorit y form as 
performing this function. Any clinically  significant condition present at a post -treatment 
physical examination that was not present at the baseline physical examination should be 
documented as an AE and followed to a satisfactory  conclusion.
Body height and weight will also be measured during scr eening for calculation of body  
mass index ( BMI )and weight will be measured as part of all sub sequent phy sical 
examinations. For the measurement of height, the measurement will be made without 
shoes. For the measurement of weight, all efforts will be made to use the same scale for 
all measurements throughout the trial.
Vital signs will be taken at the time points presented in the schedule of assessments

3.7.6.4 Electrocardiogram Assessments
Standard 12
-lead ECGs will be colle cted in triplicate (5 minutes apart) at the time points 
presented in the schedule of assessments (Table 3.7-1for sparse sampling and 
Table 3.7-2 for robust sampling) . Additional 12- lead ECGs may  be obtained at the 
investigator’s discretion and should always be obtained in the event of an early  
termination (ET) of an y cause. The ECGs will be collected prior to PK blood draws and 
after vital signs at the nominal time points, where applicable.
Standard 12- lead ECGs will be recorded after the subject has been supine and at rest 
for≥ 10 minutes prior to the first ECG and subjects will remain supine through the final 
ECG. Heart rate, ventricular rate, RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, and QT 
intervals will be re corded. The corrected QT interval using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF )
will be calculated. The 12 -lead ECGs will be evaluated at the trial sites to determine the 
subject’s eligibility  and to mo nitor safety  during the trial. 
The principal investigators or 
designees (licensed ph ysician) will review, sign, and date each ECG reading, noting 
whether or not an y abnormal results are of clinical significance. The ECG will be 
repeated if an y results are considered to be clinically  significant. The reviewers must be 
listed on FDA Form 1572 and the trial sitedelegation of responsibility  form. 
Electrocardiogram data will be recorded electronically (ie, eCRFs) by the central ECG 
laboratory  and b y the trial site. Eligibility  for the trial will be based on the central ECG 
report at the screening visit and the trial site’s local ECG reading at Day  1 predose.

If the subject discontinues I MP due to an AE, the investigator, or other trial personnel, 
will make every  effort to follow the event until it has resolved or stabilized. Follow -up 
procedures in Section 3.8.3.1 must be followed. Subjects may  be replaced, if 
discontinuations/withdrawals occur, as described in Section 3.3.
3.8.3.3 Withdrawal of Consent
All subjects have the right to withdraw their consent from further participation in the trial 
at an y time without prejudice. Subjects cannot withdraw consent for use of data already  
collected as part of the trial, but only  for future participation.
Withdrawal of consent is a critical trial event and therefore should be approached with 
the same degree of importance and care as is used in initial ly obtaining informed consent. 
The reasons for a subject’s intended withdrawal need to be understood, documented, and 
managed to protect the rights of the subject and the integrity  of the trial.
At any  time, a subject may  withdraw from the substudy  and may  request that the
sponsor destro y their sample(s) by contacting the trial site. Should the subject choose to 
withdraw their consent to the storage and use of their sample(s), such sample(s) will not 
be used from that point on a nd will be promptly  destroy ed. Subjects will not lose any  
benefits, medical treatment
,or legal rights which they are allowed if they request their 
sample(s ) to be destro yed. Leaving the main trial does not mean that their sample(s) used 
for this substudy  will automatically  be destroy ed. Subjects wil l have to make a request 
for their sample(s) to be destro yed after they  leave the trial.
Subjects who withdraw should be encouraged to complete all ET and follow -up 
assessments with ET assessments conducted as soon as possible after the subject is 
withdraw n.Clinical Study Report 031-201-00181 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 031- 201-00181
Confidential --Proprietary Information 88 Protocol Version 3.0, 31 Jul 20193.9 Screen Failures
A screen failure subject is one from whom informed consent is obtained and is 
documented in writing (ie,subject signs an ICF), but who is not randomized or assigned 
trialtreatment. In the case where a subject had a positive screen for stimulants or 
marijuana and was therefore excluded, the medical monitor should be contacted to 
determine if rescreening is an option. However, subjects excluded for an y other reasons 
may be rescreened at any time if the exclusi on characteristic has changed . In the event 
that the subject is rescreened, a new ICF must be signed, a new screening number 
assigned, and all screening procedures repeated. After 2 screening attempts, the medical 
monitor should be consulted to confirm whether or not the subject can b e enrolled.
3.10 Definition of Completed Subjects
The evaluation period is defined as the time period during which subj ects are evaluated 
for primary  and secondary  objectives of the trial irrespective of whether the subject is 
administered IMP. Subjects who 
areevaluated at the last scheduled visit (Day  225 for 
aripiprazole 2M LAI 960mg and Day  197 for aripiprazole I M depot 400 mg ) during the 
treatment phase will b e defined as trial completers. 
3.11 Definition of Subjects Lost to Follow -up
Subjects who cannot be contacted on or before Day 225,or later ,and who do not have a 
known reason for discontinuation (eg, withdrew consent or AE, etc.), except those who 
have completed the trial as defined in
 Section 3.10, will be classified as “lost to 
follow -up” as the reason for discontinuation.
The trial sitewill make 3 documented attempts to contact the sub ject b y telephone and in 
the event the site is unable to reach the subject b y telephone, the site will attempt to 
contact the subject via certified mail or an alternative similar method where appropriate, 
before assigning a “lost to follow- up” status.
3.12 Subj ect Compliance
The actual time and dose of IMP administration will be recorded on the eCRF. 
Information regarding any  inappropriatel y administered dose will also be documented on 
the eCRF.
3.13 Protocol Deviations
In the event of a major deviation from the prot ocol due to an emergency , accident, or 
mistake (eg, violation of informed consent process, I MP dispensing or subject dosing 
error, treatment assignment error, subject enrolled in violation of eligibility  criteria or Clinical Study Report 031-201-00181 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

the earlie st possible time by  telephone. 
The investigator, or designee, and sponsor will 
come to a joint decision as quickly  as possible regarding the subject’s continuation in the 
trial. If the decision r eached is to allow the subject to continue in the trial, this must be 
documented b y the investigator and the sponsor, and approved or disapproved by the 
medical monitor.
4 Restrictions
4.1 Prohibited Medications
With the exception of the subject’s current at ypical antipsy chotic medication (and/or 
mood stabilizer orantidepressant for subjects with bipolar I disorder ), any other 
psychotropics must 
be discontinued at least 14 day s prior (with the exception of 
fluoxetine or fluoxetine/olanzapine, which need to be discontinued at least 28 day s prior) 
to administration of IMP, and will not be allowed during the course of the trial (see 
Inclusion Criterion 7 in Table 3.4.2-1) . Subjects on any  LAI other than Abilify  Maintena 
will be excluded from the trial. Other oral non -aripiprazole antipsy chotic medica tions 
may be allowed if approved by  the medical monitor and sponsor; however, clozapine and 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) will not be allowed. Subjects may not receive 
varenicline bey ond screening. If a subject is receiving varenicline at enrollment , attempts 
should be made to discontinue the medication if clinically  feasible, to allow potential 
subjects to enter the trial.
Subjects must stop all other prohibited concomitant medications prior to dosing and for 
the duration of the trial. Subjects must wash out from antipsy chotics that are known to 
cause corrected QT interval ( QTc)prolongation ,such as haloperidol, within 14 day s prior 
to administration of IMP.Use of quetiapine or ziprasidone is permitted.
Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and inhibitors of CYP2D6 isozy mes are not allowed 
within 14 days prior to dosing and for the duration of the trial , since these are the 
pathway s in which aripiprazole is metabolized. An example list of CYP3A4 and 
CYP2D6 inhibitors and CYP3A4 inducers that are prohibited during the trial are listed in

4.2 Restricted Medications
Benzodiazepine use is allowed up to a maximum of 6 mg/day  lorazepam or equivalent, 
but not within 8 hours of any  rating scales during the trial. The use of IM lorazepam is 
also permitted for emergent agitation, but only  if deemed absolutel y necessary  by the 
investigator. The following guide should be used to determine approximate lorazepam 
equivalents: 1 mg lorazepam = 5 mg diazepam = 15 mg oxazepam = 15 mg clorazepate. 
Subjects must not be on more than one benzodiazepine beyond the screening visit.
If a subject is receiving 2 benzodiazepines at the screening visit (eg, loraze pam and 
oxazepam), attempts should be made to discontinue one of the benzodiazepines, if 
clinically  warranted, to allow potential subjects to enter the trial. The second 
benzodiazepine should be tapered off over an appropriate amount of time within the Clinical Study Report 031-201-00181 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine use is allowed during the trial as needed to 
manage AEs such as agitation, anxiety , sleep disturbance, and insomnia. Combined use 
of both drug classes (ie, benzodiazepines and non
-benzodiazepine sleep aids) as treatment 
for insomnia is not allowed. Benzodiazepine use should be discontinued as soon as the 
AE for which it was initiated subsides, as per the investigator’s discretion ,to avoid any  
withdrawal effects.

4.3 Nontherapy  Precautions and Restrictions
Subjects will be instructed to refrain from drinking alcoholic beverages or using illicit 
drugs during participation in the trial.
Electroconvulsive therapy  must not be conducted within 2 months prior to administration 
of the IMP and is not allowed during the course of the trial.
5 Reporting of A dverse Events
5.1 Definitions
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessaril y have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. Adverse events would not include information recorded 
as medical history  at screening for preplanned procedures for which the unde rlying 
condition was known and no worsening occurred.Clinical Study Report 031-201-00181 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments
Until the information herein is released by Otsuka to the public domain, the contents of this document are Otsuka

91
Protocol 031- 201-00181
Confidential --Proprietary Information 92 Protocol Version 3.0, 31 Jul 2019An adverse reaction is any  untoward and unintended response to an IMP related to any  
dose administered.
A suspected adverse reaction is any  AE for which there is a reasonable possibility  that the 
IMP ca used the AE. For the purpose of Investigational New Drug (IND) safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility ” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between 
theIMP and the AE. 
“Suspected adverse reaction” implies a lesser degree of certainty
about causalit y than “adverse reaction”.
AnSAE includes an y event that results in any of the following outcomes:
Death
Life-threatening; ie, the subject was, in the opinion of the investigator, at immediate 
risk of death from the event as it occurred. Itdoes not include an event that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.
Persistent or significant incapacity /disability  or substantial disruption of the ability  to 
conduct normal life functions.
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongs hospitalization
Hospitalization itself should not be reported as a n SAE ; whenever possible the 
reason for the hospitalization should be reported.
Hospitalizations or prolonged hospitalizations for social admissions (ie, those 
required for reasons of convenience or other nonmedical need) are not considered 
SAEs .
Congenital anomal y/birth defect.
Other medicall y significant events that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject and may  require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above, eg, allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency  room or home, blood dy
scrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse .
Nonserious AEs are all AEs that do not meet the criteria for a “serious” AE.
Immed iately  Reportable Event (IRE): 
Any SAE
Any AE related to occupational exposure.
Potential serious hepatotoxicity  (see Section 5.4).
Pregnan cies are also defined as IREs. Although normal pregnancy  is not an AE, it 
will mandate IMP discontinuation and must be reported on an IRE form to the 
sponsor. 
Pregnancy  will only  be documented on the AE e CRF if there is a 
complication or abnormality  in the newborn.Clinical Study Report 031-201-00181 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 031- 201-00181
Confidential --Proprietary Information 93 Protocol Version 3.0, 31 Jul 2019Clinical L aboratory  Assessment Value Changes
:It is the investigator’s responsibility  to 
review the results of all laborato ry tests as they  become available. This review will be 
documented by the investigator’s dated sign ature on the laboratory  report. For each 
abnormal laboratory  test result, the investigator needs to ascertain if this is an abnormal 
(ie, clinicall y relevant) change from baseli ne for that individual subject. This 
determination, however, does not necessarily  need to be made the first time an abnormal 
value is observed. The investigator may  repeat the laboratory  test or request additional 
tests to verify  the res ults of the original laboratory tests. If this laboratory value is 
considered clinically  relevant by  the investigator ( eg, subject is sy mptomatic, requiring 
corrective treatment or further evaluation), or if the laboratory  value leads to 
discontinuation, or fulfills a seriousness criterion, this is considered an AE.
Severity : Adverse events will be graded on a 3- point scale a nd reported as indicated on 
theeCRF . The intensit y of an AE is defined as follows:
1 = Mild: Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily  activity .
2 = Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily  activit y.
3 = Severe: Inability  to work or perform normal daily  activity .
IMP Causalit y:Assessment of causal relationship of an AE to the use of IMP:
Related : There is a reasonable possibility  of a temporal and causal 
relationship between the IMP and the AE.
Not Related : There is no temporal or reasonable relationship between the IMP 
and the AE.
5.2 Eliciting and Reporting A dverse Events
The investigator will assess subjects for the occurrence of AEs from the time the I CF is 
signed until the end of the trial . For this trial, information on AEs will be followed for up 
to 28daysafter the last dose of aripiprazole I M depot 400 mg has been administered and 
56 day s after the last of aripiprazole 2M L AI 960 mg has been administered . To avoid 
bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked the 
following nonleading question: “How 
are you feeling?” AllAEs (serious and nonserious) reported b y the subject must be 
recorded on the s ource documents and eCRFs provided by  the sponsor. Serious AE 
collection is to begin after a subject has signed the I CF. 
Use medica l terminology in AE reporting. Adverse events should be reported as a single 
unify ing diagnosis whenever possible or, in the absence of a unify ing diagnosis, a s 
individual signs or sy mptoms. Exacerbation or disease progression should be reported as Clinical Study Report 031-201-00181 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

be paid to recording hospitalization and concomitant medications.
5.3 Immediately  Reportable Events
The investigator must report any  SAE, any AE related to occupational exposure ,potential 
serious hepatotoxicity , or confirmed pregnancy  immediately  after either the investigator 
or trial siteperso nnel become aware of the event. An IRE form should be completed and 
sent by  fax, e -mail, or overnight courier, using the contact informati on on th e title page of 
this protocol. (Please note that the IRE form is a specific form and is NOT the AE eCRF) .
Subjects experiencing SAEs should be followed clinically  as described in Section 5.7.2.
It is expected that the investigator will provide or arrange appropriate supportive care for 
the subject and will provide prompt updates on the subject’s status to the sponsor.
5.4 Potential Serious Hepatot oxicity
For a subject who experiences an elevation in a
spartate aminotransferase (AST )or 
alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) that is ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) , a total 
bilirubin l evel should also be evaluated. If the total bilirubin is ≥ 2 times the ULN, 
complete an IRE form with all values listed and also report as an AE on the eCRF .
5.5 Pregnancy
Females of childbearing potential are women whose menstruation has started and who are 
not documented as sterile ( eg, have had a bilateral oophore ctom y, or hysterectomy , or 
who have been postmenopausal for at least 12 months).
For men and F OCBP, who are sexually  active, there must be a documented agreement 
that the subject and their partner will take effective measures (ie, 2different approved 
methods of birth control or remains abstinent) to prevent pregnancy  during the course of 
the trial and for 150after the last dose of IMP for a female subjects or 180 day s after the 
last dose of IMP for a male subjects . Unless the subject is sterile (ie, women who have 
had a bilateral oophorectomy , have had a h ysterectomy , or have been postmenopausal for 
at least 12 consecutive months; or men who have had a bilateral orchiectomy ) or remains 
abstinent during the trial and for 150days after the last dose of IMP for a female subject 
or 180 days after the last dose of IMP for a male subject, 2 of the following approved 
methods of birth control must be used: vasectom y, tubal ligation, intrauterine device, 
birth control pills, birth control implant, birth control dep ot injection, condom with Clinical Study Report 031-201-00181 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

cervic al/vault cap) with spermicide. Any single method of birth control, including 
vasectom y and tubal ligation, may fail, lead ing to pregnancy . 
The contra ceptive method 
will be documented in the eCRF. Male subjects must also agree not to donate sperm from 
trial screening through 180days after the last dose of IMP.
Before enrolling men and women in this clinical trial, investigators must review the 
below information about trial participation as part of the I CF process. The topics should 
generall y include:
General information
Informed consent form
Pregnancy  prevention information
Drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives
Contraceptives in current use
Follow -up of a reported pregnancy
Before trial enrollment, men and FOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding 
pregnancy  during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentio nal 
pregnancy . Subjects must sign the ICF confirmin g that the above -mentioned risk factors 
and the consequences were discussed.
A urine or serum pregnancy  test for human chorionic gonadotropin will be performed on 
all FOCBP at screening and throughout the trial at the time points presented in the 
schedule of a
ssessments (Table 3.7-1 for sparse sampling and Table 3.7-2 for robust 
sampling) . If a urine test is performed and is positive, the investigator will follow -up with 
a confirmatory  serum test.
During the trial, all F OCBP should be instructed to contact the investigator immediately  
if they  suspect they  might be pregnant (eg, missed or late menstrual cy cle). Male subjects 
should also be instructed to contact the investigator immediately , during the trial, if their 
partners suspect that they might be pregnant (eg, missed or late menstrual cy cle).
If a subject is suspected to be preg nant before she receives IMP, the IMP administration 
must be withheld until the results of serum pregnancy  tests are available. If the pregnancy  
is confirmed, the subject must not receive the IMP and must
not be enrolled in the trial. If 
pregnancy  is suspe cted while the subject is taking IMP, the IMP must be withheld 
immediately  (if reasonable, taking into consideration any  potential withdrawal risks) until 
the result o f the pregnancy  test is known. If pregnancy  is confirmed, the I MP will be 
permanentl y dis continued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary  for 
subject safet y) and the subject will be withdrawn from the t rial. Exceptions to trial Clinical Study Report 031-201-00181 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

The investigator must immediately  notify  the sponsor of any  pregnancy  associated with 
IMP exposure during the trial and for at least 150days after the last dose o
f IMP for a 
female subject or 180 days after the last dose of IMP for a male subject , and record the 
event on the IRE form and forward it to the sponsor. The sponsor will forward the 
Pregnancy  Surveillance Form(s) to the investigator for monitoring the out come of the 
pregnancy . 
Protocol -required procedures for trial discontinuation and follow- up must be performed 
on the subject unless contraindicated b y pregnancy  (eg, x -ray studies). Other appropriate 
pregnancy  follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated. In addition, the 
investigator must report to the sponsor, on the Pregnancy  Surveillance Form(s), 
follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy , including perina tal and 
neonatal outcome. Infants will be followed for a minimum of 6 months from the date of 
birth.

5.7.1 Follow -up of Nonserious A dverse Events
Nonserious AEs that are identified at an y time during the trial must be recorded on the 
AE eCRF with the current status (ongoing or resolved/recovered) noted. All nonserious 
events (that are not IREs) that are ongoing at the last scheduled contact will be recorded 
as ongoing on the eCRF. For an y AE having been identified throughout the trial, during 
data anal ysis, additional relevant medical history  information may  be requested by  the 
sponsor to further ascertain causality  (including, but not limited to, in formation such as 
risk-related behavior, family  history  and occupation). Subjects should be given 
appropriate medical treatment until the 
resolution of an y AE.
5.7.2 Follow -up of Serious A dverse Events and Immediately  
Reportable Events
This trial requires that subjects be activel y monitored for SAEs and IREs up to 28 day s 
after the last dose of aripiprazole I M depot 400 mg is administered and 56 day s after the

Confidential --Proprietary Information 97 Protocol Version 3.0, 31 Jul 2019Serious AEs 
and nonserious I REs that are identified or ongoing at the last scheduled 
contact must be recorded as such on the AE eCRF page . If updated information (eg, 
resolved status) on SAE or I RE status becomes available after a subject’s last scheduled 
contact (up to last in clinic visit for the entire trial), this must be reported to the sponsor 
and recorded on the AE eCRF page, 
according to the appropriate reporting procedures. 
The investigator will follow SAEs until the events are resolved or stabilized, or the 
subject is l ost to follow -up or has died. Resolution means the subject has returned to the 
baseline state of health and stabilized means that the investigator does not expect any  
further improvement or worsening of the subject’s condition. The investigator will 
contin ue to report an y significant follow -up information to the sponsor up to the point the 
event has resolved or stabilized, or the subject is lost to follow -up or has died.

7 Statistical A nalysis
7.1 Determination of Sample Size
To establish the similarity  in primary  PK variables, the lower bound of the 90% CI  of the 
geometric means ratio (GMR) of C 56and AUC 0-56after the fourth dose of aripiprazole 
2M L AI 960 mg toC28after the eighth dose and the sum of AUC 0-28values after the 
seventh and eighth dose sof aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg should be greater than 80%, 
respectivel y
. 
It is estimated that a total of at least 100 subjects (ie, 50 per group) completing the trial 
will have at least 80% power to ensure that the lower limit of the 90% CI of the GMR of 
C56after the fourth dose of aripiprazole 2M LAI 960mg (test) to C28after the eighth 
dose of aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg (reference) is greater than 0. 80, assuming that the 
actual GMR of concentrations is 1.0 and the CV is 46%. 
Among these 100 subjects, at least 30completers enrolled 
to the robust sampling 
schedule will provide at least 80% power to ensure that the lower limit of the 90% CI of 
the GMR of AUC 0-56of aripiprazole 2M LAI 960 mg (test) to the sum of AUC 0-28values 
of aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg (reference) after the seventh and eighth doses is greater 
than 0.80, assuming the actual GMR of concentrations is 1.15 and the CV is 40%.
The assumption of 
CV used in the sample calculation is based on the PK data in the 
previous multiple -dose aripiprazole I M depot PK Trial 31-11-298.
To ensure adequate power of the trial, an interim analy sis may  be conducted by  the 
Interim Anal ysis Review Committee (I ARC). The final sample size could be increased as 
per recommendation of the IARC and as further described in
 Section 7.1.1 .
Assuming a dropout rate of 34%, approximately  152 to 258 subjects will be enrolled to 
have 100 to 170 completers based on the recommendation of the proposed interim 
analysis.
7.1.1 Interim A nalysis/Sample Size Re -estimation
An interim anal ysis of the PK data is planned during the trial and may be performed b y 
an IARC on approximately  50 subjects ( 25 subjects per treatment group) co mpleting the 
trial. In this case, completers will be defined as subjects who receive a final dose of IMP 
(both treatment groups) at the maximum dose. 
Out of the 50 subjects, approximately  Clinical Study Report 031-201-00181 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 031- 201-00181
Confidential --Proprietary Information 99 Protocol Version 3.0, 31 Jul 201914subjects ( 7subjects per 
treatment group) will have been enrolled to the robust 
sampl ing schedule . Subjects will continue to be enrolled into the trial until either the 
interim analy sis is complete and recommends no sample size increase or there are enough 
subjects enrolled to ensure 170 completers.
If the trial is stopped due to futility  (as described by the interim anal ysis), randomized 
subjects will be terminated; however, if the interim analy sis stops the trial for having 
enough conditional power, then all randomized subjects will continue until the last 
observation. Subjects in screeni ng will be discontinued and no further randomization will 
occur.
An alpha level of 0.001 (1
-sided) is allocated to estimate the sample size during this 
interim analy sis. The corresponding final significance level is 0.049 (1- sided).
The sample size will be re-estimated onl y based on the conditional power determined at 
the interim anal ysis. The adaptive designs methodology  published by  Chen, DeMets, and 
Lan (2004)15will be used to increase the sample size based on an in terim estimate of the 
treatment effect size, possibly  combined with other external information, without 
inflating the Ty pe I error.
All the detailed calculations and re -estimation methods will be prespecified and included 
in the statistical analy sis plan a nd interim anal ysis plan.

7.3 Handling of Missing Data
No data imputation will be done for mi ssing data in the PK analy sis. The l ast observation 
carried forward (LOCF) method is used to impute missing data of the safety  EPS 
assessment scales and efficacy  assessment scales at post baseline visits. The observed c ase 
(OC) dataset corresponding to a visit consists of data from all subjects who are evaluated 
at that visit. I n the LOCF dataset, missing data at a post baseline visit are imputed with the 
value obtained at the nearest preceding visit, except that baseline values are not carried 
forward to impute missing values at a postbaseline visit.
In addition, for the safet y endpoints other than the EPS assessment scales, t heLOCF
method is also applicable f orthe values from the last visit for laboratory  tests, vital sign 
parameters, ECG parameters, C -SSRS suicidality -related parameters, VAS for

9 Records Management
9.1 Source Documents
Source documents are defined as the results of original observations and activitie s of a 
clinical investigation. Source documents will include, but are not limited to, progress 
notes, electronic data, screening logs, and recorded da ta from aut omated instruments. All 
source documents pertaining to this trial will be maintained b y the investigators and made 
available for direct inspection by  authorized persons.
Investigator(s)/institution(s) will permit trial- related monitoring, audits, IRBrevie w, and 
regulatory  inspection(s) by  providing direct access to source data/documents by  
authorized persons as defined in the I CF. In all cases, subject confidentiality  must be 
maintained in accordance with local regulatory  requirements.
9.2 Data Collection
During each subject’s visit to the clinic, a clinician participating in the trial will record 
progress notes to document all significant observations. 
At a minimum, these notes will 
contain:
Documentation of the informed consent process, including an y revised consents;
Documentation of the investigator’s decision to enroll the subject into the trial, the 
review of all inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to IMP administration, and 
confirmation of the subject’s actual participation in the trial;
The date of the visit and the corresponding visit or day  in the trial schedule;
General subject status remarks, including an y significant medical findings. The 
severit y, frequency, duration, action taken, and outcome of an y AEs and the 
investigator's assessment of relatio nship to I MP must also be recorded;
Any changes in concomitant medications or dosages;
A general reference to the procedures completed; Clinical Study Report 031-201-00181 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

in the progress notes.
In addit ion, any  contact with the subject via telephone or other means that provides 
significant clinical information will also be documented in the progress notes as 
described above.
Source documents and source data will be captured electronically  in this trial, and will 
meet the same fundamental elements of data quality  (eg, attributable, legible, 
contemporaneous, original, a nd accurate) as paper records. These data will be collected 
into a s ystem 
(eSource) that is fully  validated. Changes to the data will be cap tured b y an 
automatic audit trail.
The trial sitewill be given a tablet to directl y record subject data and clinical 
observations on electronic forms. Designated trial sitestaff will not be given access to the 
system until they  have been appropriatel y trained. Information to be originally  captured 
and reviewed electronically  shall include details of the subject visit and the protocol 
required assessments performed as a part of these visits, medical history , AEs, and 
concomitant medications. Because this t rial is using an electronic source record as the 
original point of data capture, there is no additional data entry  step for the trial sitefor 
data collected directl y into the application -rather, the electronic source record directl y 
populates the trial database.
Some data may  be captured via paper and then entered into the eSource s ystem. These 
and an y other data treated in this manner will be source data verified b y the trial clinical 
research associate, and the location of the source data (ie, eSource, paper, or a local 
electronic s ystem) will be documented before the trial start. Any changes to information 
in paper source documents will be initialed and dated on the day  the change is made by a 
trial sitestaff member authorized to make the change. Chan ges will be made by  striking a 
single line through erroneous data (so as not to obliterate the original data), and clearly  
entering the correct data (eg, wrong data right data). If the reason for the change is not 
apparent, a brief explanation for the chan ge will be written in the source documentation 
by the clinician.
Another exception will be safet y laboratory or central ECG data, where the official 
source documentation will be considered the report issued by  the anal yzing laboratory .

l adherence, to assess trial site operational capabilities ,and to perform 
other monitoring activities that cannot be performed remotely.
At the end of the trial, the investigator must certify that the data entered into the eSource 
applicat ion are complete and accurate. After database lock, the investigator will receive 
an electronic copy of the subject data.
9.3 File Management at the Trial Site
The investigator will ensure that the trial sitefile is maintained in accordance with 
Section 8 of the I CH GCP Guideline E6 and as required by applicable local regulations. 
The trial sitefile will include all source documentation as well as completed eCRF data 
for all subjects screened or enrolled at the trial site. The investigator/institution will take 
measures to ensure confidentiality  and prevent accidental or premature destruction of 
these documents.
9.4 Record Retention at the Trial Site
Federal 
FDA regulations require all investigators participating in clinical drug trials to 
maintain detailed clinical data for one of the following periods:
A period of at least 2 years following the date on which a N DAis approved by  the 
FDA;
A period of 2 years after the sponsor has notified the FDA that investigati on with this 
drug is discontinued.
The investigator must not dispose of an y records relevant to this trial without either 
(1)written permission from the sponsor or (2) providing an opportunit y for the sp onsor to 
collect such records. The investigator wil l be responsible to maintain adequate and 
accurate electronic or hard copy  source documents of all observations and data generated 
during this trial, including an y data clarification fo rms received from the sponsor. Such 
documentation is subject to inspect ion by  the sponsor and relevant regulatory  authorities. 
If the investigator withdraws from the trial or withdraws during the record retention 
period (eg, due to relocation or retirement or trial siteclosure), all trial -related records 
should be transferre d to a mutually  agreed- upon designee within a sponsor -specified 
timeframe. Notice of such transfer will be given to the sponsor in writing.Clinical Study Report 031-201-00181 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Confidential --Proprietary Information 110 Protocol Version 3.0, 31 Jul 201910 Quality  Control and Quality  Assurance
10.1 Monitoring
The sponsor has ethical, legal, and scientific obligations to follo w this trial in accordance 
with established re search principles, I CH E6 GCP: Consolidated Guidance, and 
applicable regulator y requirements and local laws. As part of a concerted effort to fulfill 
these obligations (maintain current personal knowledge of th e progress of the trial), the 
sponsor’s (or sponsor designee’s) monitors will visit the site during the trial, as well as 
communicate frequentl y via telephone, e -mail, and written communications. In addition, 
all investigators and trial siteclinical perso nnel will undergo initial and ongoing training 
for this particular trial, and this training will be clearl y documented.
10.2 Auditing
The sponsor’s (or designee’s) Quality  Assurance Unit (or representative) may  conduct 
trial siteaudits. 
Audits will include, but are not limited to, I MP supply , presence of 
required documents, the informed consent process, and comparison of eCRFs with source 
documents. The investigator agrees to participate with audits.
Regulatory  authorities may  inspect the trial siteduring or after the trial. The investigator 
will cooperate with such inspections and will contact the sponsor immediately  if such an 
inspection occurs.
10.3 Protocol Deviations
Due to the complexity  of clinical trial protocols and despite training a nd preventive 
efforts, deviations from the written protocol may  occur and potentially  result in harm to 
subjects, biased or inaccurate results, and possible rejection of all or part of the trial data. 
Per the ICH E3 guidance on the structure and content of clinical study  reports, 
Section 10.2, protocol deviations should be summarized by  site and grouped into 
different categories such as:
Major IMP dosing errors that may  compromise subject safet y or efficacy assessments.
Administration of an excluded concomi tant medication during the course of the trial.
The FDA defines a protocol deviation/violation as an unplanned excursion from the 
protocol that is not implemented or intended as a systematic change.Clinical Study Report 031-201-00181 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

110
Protocol 031- 201-00181
Confidential --Proprietary Information 111 Protocol Version 3.0, 31 Jul 2019Otsuka categorizes clinical protocol dev iations as major versus minor. 
A major deviation 
is an intentional or accidental action or omission in a trial conduct that could potentially  
have a negative impact on the integrit y of the trial’s primary  scientific objectives or has a 
significant potentia l to have a negative impact on the safet y or efficacy ass essments of 
any trial subject. Major deviations are those that might significantl y affect the 
completeness, accuracy , or reliability  of the trial data or that might significantly  affect a 
subject’s r ights, safet y, or well -being.
A minor deviation is an intentional or accidental action or omission during trial conduct 
in which the protocol is not strictly  followed, but which has inconsequential impact on 
the integrit y of the trial as a whole or the saf ety or efficacy anal yses of an individual 
subject.
All protocol deviations will be categorized as major or minor according to the above 
definitions and only  major deviations will be summarized in the CSR.
If the same protocol deviation occurs for multiple subjects, it must be recorded separatel y 
for each subject.
Investigators are expected to document potential protocol deviations as well as their 
medical assessment regarding continuation of the subject(s) due to the protocol deviation.
11 Ethics and Responsib ility
This trial must be conducted in compliance with the protocol, FDA, ICH GCP Guideline 
(E6), international ethical principles derived from the Declaration of Helsinki and 
Council for International Organizations of Medical Science guidelines, and applic able 
local laws and regulations. The trial sites will seek approval/favorable opinion by  an IRB 
according to regional requirements, and the investigator will provide that documentation 
to the sponsor. The IRB will evaluate the ethical, scientific, and medi calappropriateness 
of the trial. Further, in preparing and handling eCRFs, the investigator, sub- investigator, 
and their staff will take measures to ensure adequate care in protecting subject privacy . 
To this end, a subject number or subject identifier wi ll be used to identify each subject.
Financial aspects, subject insurance, and publication policy  for the trial will be 
docu mented in the agreement between the sponsor and the investigator.Clinical Study Report 031-201-00181 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 031- 201-00181
Confidential --Proprietary Information 112 Protocol Version 3.0, 31 Jul 201912 Confidentiality
All information generated in this trial will be co
nsidered confidential and will not be 
disclosed to any one not directly  concerned with the trial without the sponsor’s prior 
written permission. Subject confidentiality requirements of the region(s) where the trial is 
conducted will be met. However, authori zed regulatory  officials and sponsor personnel 
(or their representatives) may  be allowed full access to inspect and copy  the records, 
consi stent with local requirements. All IMPs, subject bodily  fluids, and other materials 
collected shall be used solely  inaccordance with this protocol, unless otherwise agreed to 
in writing b y the sponsor.
Subjects will be identified only  by unique subject identifiers in eCRFs . If further subject 
IDis required, subjects’ full names may  be made known to a regulatory  agency  or other 
authorized officials if necessary , subject to local regulations.
13 Amendment Policy
The investigator will not make an y changes to this protocol without the sponsor’s prior 
written consent and subsequent approval/favorable opinion by  the IRB . Any  permanent 
change to the protocol, whether an overall change or a change for specific trial sites, must 
be ha ndled as a protocol amendment. Any amendment w ill be written by  the sponsor. 
Each amendment will be submitted to the IRB, as required b
y local regulati ons. Except 
for “administrative” or “nonsubstantial” amendments, investigators will wait for IRB
approval/favorable opinion of the amended protocol befo re implementing the change(s). 
Administrative amendments are defined as having no effect on the safet y of subjects, 
conduct or management of the trial, trial design, or the quality  or safet y of IMP(s) used in 
the trial. A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to 
subjects should be implemented immediately  after agreement by  the sponsor and 
investigator, followed b y IRBnotification within local applicabl e timelines. The sponsor 
will submit protocol amendments to the applicable regulatory  agency  within local 
applicable timelines.
When the IRB, investigators, or the sponsor conclude that the protocol amendment 
substantially  alters the trial design or increases the potential risk to the subject, the 
currentl y approved written I CF will require similar modification. In such cases, after 
approval/favorable opinion of the new ICF b y the IRB, repeat written informed consent 
will be obtained from subjects enrolled in the trial before expecting continued 
participation and before the amendment -specified changes in the trial are implemented.Clinical Study Report 031-201-00181 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

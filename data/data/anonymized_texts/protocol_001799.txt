•The maximum number that can be randomized by any site is 66 (20% of 330).
•Added maximum of 30 participants randomized from Canada
•Increased minimum recruitment goal to 30% of a minority race or ethnicity; 20% using an
SGLT2 inhibitor, 20% using a GLP-1 receptor agonist, and 10% using both; 15% with
TDI>100 units/day and attempt to enrich cohort with participants with TDI >200 units ;
25% using a form of fixed dosing to calculate meal boluses (e.g., fixed dose at meal or
fixed dose for small/medium/large meal [i.e., dose not determined by carbohydr ate
counting]). Changed HbA1c goal to be maximum of 25% with HbA1c <8% (based on
screening   HbA1c or HbA1c available within the last 30 days) and maximum of 10% with
screening HbA1c <7 %
Section 2.2.1:The following changes were made in the inclusion criteria 
•Added requirement that type 2 diabetes was diagnosed at least 6 months prior to screening
•Modified insulin use requirement to be: Using basal-bolus insulin therapy with at least one
injection containing rapid-acting insulin per day or an insulin pump for at least 3 months
prior to enrollment, with no major modification to insulin regime in the last 3 months
•Dropped requirement of TDI < 250 units
•Added: If using noninsulin glucose-lowering medications (such as GLP-1 receptor agonis t,
SGLT2 inhibitor, or other) or weight-reduction medications, dose has been stable for the 3
months prior to screening; and participant is willing to not change the dose unless required
for safety purposes
•Added: Participant willing to not initiate use of any new glucose-lowering medications
during the trial
•Dropped requirement for HbA1c 7.0% to 11.9 %
Section 2.2.3: The eligibility for the exercise challenges was changed to be the following: All 
participants will have a screening EKG or review of an EKG completed in the 12 months prior 
to screening. To participate in the exercise challenges, a participant must have either no history 
of a cardiovascular event in the year prior to screening  and no EKG abnormalities associated 
with increased risk during exercise.   
Section 2.3.1: The following changes were made in the screening data collection and testing: 
•HHS and hospitalization for SH, DKA, HHS added to medical history information
•Blood draw for central lab HbA1c deleted

participants must have two CGM or fingerstick blood glucose values, separated by at least 15 
minutes, that are above 80 mg/dL prior to discharge from the clinic. 
Section 5.4: Regarding glucose-lowering or weight reduction medications, add the following: The 
only changes of glucose-lowering or weight-reduction medications permitted will be a 
reduction in dose for safety reasons, or an adjustment to an equivalent dose of a different 
formulation if participant’s insurance coverage changes. No increased doses  or initiation of a 
new glucose-lowering or weight-reduction medication will be permitted.  
Section 6.1: Challenges 
•Plan for exercise and meal challenges modified to require the 3 challenges of each type to
be on consecutive days and to have about 25% of each type of challenge within th e
following 4 periods timed from randomization: 1-2 weeks, 3-4 weeks, 5-6 weeks, 7- 8
weeks.
•Added need for trained care partner to be present during exercise challenges
Section 6.2 Meal Challenges: 
•Added that CGM trend error must not be rapidly rising at the start of the challenge
•Added information about the need to reschedule a challenge
Section 6.3 Exercise Challenges: 
•Added that exercise mode will be active during exercise challenges, with the timing of
activation determined by investigator and participant
•Added if CGM glucose is <120 mg/dL at start of session, carbohydrate can be taken and
exercise should not begin until glucose is ≥ 120 mg/dL
•Added that the participant will be asked to record whether the prior insulin meal bolus was
intentionally reduced in preparation for exercise
•Added information about the need to reschedule a challenge
Section 9.5: Added that cases of HHS will have expedited reporting to DSMB in addition to SH and 
DKA  
Section 9.6.2: Added that the DSMB will be immediately notified of all adverse events related to 
SH, DKA, or HHS, as well as any recurrence of these events across participants or study sites. 
Section 10.1: added that only insulin approved for the study pump can be used by the AID group 
Section 10.3: added that dose increases in glucose-lowering or weight-reduction medications in use

Technology in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Using Basal-Bolus Insulin Therapy (2IQP) 
Protocol Version/Date : 8.0/October 31, 2023 
I have read the protocol specified above.  In my formal capacity as a Site Principal Investigator, 
my duties include ensuring the safety of the study participants enrolled under my supervision and 
providing the Jaeb Center for Health Research, which serves as the Coordinating Center for the 
protocol, with complete and timely information, as outlined in the protocol.  It is understood that 
all information pertaining to the study will be held strictly confidential and that this 
confidentiality requirement applies to all study staff at this site. 
This trial will be carried out in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
and as required by the following (use applicable regulations depending on study location and 
sponsor requirements; examples follow): United States (US) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 
applicable to clinical studies (45 CFR Part 46, 21 CFR Part 50, 21 CFR Part 56, 21 CFR Part 
312, and/or 21 CFR Part 812). 
As the Principal Investigator, I will assure that no deviation from, or changes to the protocol 
will take place without prior agreement from the sponsor and documented approval from the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB), or other approved Ethics Committee, except where necessary 
to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to the trial participants. 
All key personnel (all individuals responsible for the design and conduct of this trial) have

the study and will be trained on their use by qualified staff. BGM readings will 
be performed in accordance with the study safety plan and per CGM 
manufacturer instructions. Ketone readings will be performed per the study 
safety plan, based largely on the development of symptoms suggestive of 
ketosis. 
Site investigators may adjust insulin delivery profile settings ONLY for safety 
concerns as needed throughout the study in accordance with their clinical 
practice. Reasons for the change will be documented in the CRF. 
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board will provide study oversight. All severe 
hypoglycemia, DKA, and HHS events will be reported expeditiously to the 
DSMB as described in section 9.5.

TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 27 OF 79 Chapter 1:  Background Information 1 
1.1 Disease Background 2 
More than 34 million people in the United States have diabetes, with type 2 diabetes accounting 3 
for approximately 90% to 95% of cases. In the last 20 years, the number of adults diagnosed with 4 
diabetes has more than doubled as the American population has aged and become more 5 
overweight or obese. Diabetes is the 7th leading cause of death in the United States (and may be 6 
underreported) (1). 7 
1.2 Device Background 8 
The t:slim X2 insulin pump with Control-IQ technology (Control-IQ) is an advanced hybrid 9 
closed-loop (HCL) system, developed and manufactured by Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. and 10 
cleared in the U.S. by the FDA for individuals with type 1 diabetes. Control-IQ is integrated with 11 
the Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and uses CGM values to predict glucose 12 
values 30 minutes in the future. Based on the predicted glucose, Control-IQ modulates basal 13 
insulin delivery, and delivers automated correction boluses to mitigate impending 14 
hyperglycemia. The current Control-IQ system is FDA approved down to age 6 years old for 15 
individuals with type 1 diabetes, and has been found to improve time in range (70-180 mg/dL) 16 
and decrease both time <70 mg/dL and time >180 mg/dL (2,3). There are over 150,000 users of 17 
the system since it became commercially available in 2020.  A recent evaluation of real-world 18 
use of the system in 9,451 users age ≥6 years with at least 12 months of system use found results 19 
comparable to those found in the randomized trials (4). 20 
21 
22 
Figure 2. t:slim X2 with Control-IQ and Dexcom G6 system 23 
Since the initial approval of the system, modifications have been made in the software, which is 24 
referred to as version 1.5. These modifications include modest usability improvements and other 25 
enhancements intended to further reduce risk. The Control-IQ 1.5 algorithm also removes the 3 26 
units/hr basal clipping, allowing the pump to deliver programmed user profile basal rates above 3 27 
units/hr. This has the potential to further improve outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes 28 
who are often using basal rates at or above this threshold. 29 
1.3 Control-IQ Use in Type 2 Diabetes 30 
31 

TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 28 OF 79 Insulin pump use in individuals with type 2 diabetes is relatively low. However, there is an 32 
increasing uptake of pump use in this population. The benefits of insulin pump use with 33 
Automated Insulin Dosing (AID) technology in individuals with type 2 diabetes has not been 34 
well established in clinical trials, although real-world data have shown that use of Control- IQ can 35 
produce significant glycemic benefits in this population, whether transitioning from multiple 36 
daily injections (MDI) or prior pump use. Retrospective analysis of 134 prior pump users with 37 
type 2 diabetes who purchased a new Tandem insulin pump with Control-IQ technology showed 38 
time in range was 76% (IQR 69-82%) and time below range was 0.5% (IQR 0.2-1.0%) after 180 39 
days of use. For 173 participants transitioning from MDI, use of Control-IQ technology resulted 40 
in time of range 70-180 mg/dL of 74% (IQR 63-83%) and time below  70 mg/dL 0.3% (IQR 0.1- 41 
0.6%) at 180 days of use (5). Additionally, retrospective analysis of real-world use out to one 42 
year in 378 individuals with type 2 diabetes who software updated from Basal-IQ technology to 43 
Control-IQ technology showed significant improvements in time in range 70-180 mg/dL (69% at 44 
baseline versus 78% at one year) (4). In an analysis of Medicare and Medicaid Control-IQ users, 45 
500 individuals with type 2 diabetes improved from 64% TIR at baseline to 72% after using 46 
Control-IQ for at least 30 days (6 ). 47 
A prospective single-arm 6-week trial, conducted to provide preliminary data on the safety and 48 
glycemic outcomes with use of Control-IQ in adults with T2D, showed that use of Control- IQ 49 
was safe, with no increase in CGM-measured hypoglycemia and a substantial improvement in 50 
time in range and mean glucose related to a reduction in hyperglycemia (7). Thirty adults with 51 
T2D (mean age 54±12 years, mean HbA1c 8.6±1.2, median BMI 31) using either MDI (N=15), 52 
pump (N=2) or basal without bolus insulin (N=13) collected unblinded CGM data (baseline) 53 
followed by an open-loop period prior to initiating use of CIQ for 6 weeks. Primary outcomes 54 
were superiority for CGM time >180 mg/dL and non-inferiority for time <54 mg/dL. Mean time 55 
>180 mg/dL decreased from 44% at baseline to 29% with CIQ, a reduction of 3.6 hours per day 56 
(P=0.004), mean time 70-180 mg/dL increased from 56% to 71% (P= 0.004), and mean glucose 57 
decreased from 184 to 163 mg/dL (P=0.01 ). Median time >250 mg/dL decreased by more than 58 
one hour per day. Median time <54 mg/dL was 0.00% at baseline and during CIQ use (IQR - 59 
0.02% - +0.02%). Median time in closed loop was 96% (interquartile range 93% to 96%). There 60 
were no severe hypoglycemia or DKA events. On the Diabetes Impact and Device Satisfaction 61 
Scale, participants indicated a high level of satisfaction with CIQ (mean item score 8.8±1.9 on 62 
scale of 1-10). Both prior MDI or pump and prior basal insulin only participants showed similar 63 
levels of improvement in all outcomes. 64 
1.4 Rationale and Objectives 65 
There are many patients with T2D who are unable to achieve optimal glucose control despite the 66 
use of intensive insulin therapy often with the concomitant use of other glucose-lowering drugs.  67 
An AID system such as Control-IQ offers the potential for lower HbA1c levels and increased 68 
time in range without increasing hypoglycemia and for improved quality of life.  In view of the 69 
promising results from the preliminary study evaluating Control-IQ in T2D, a larger trial with a 70 
randomized trial design is needed to more broadly and rigorously evaluate the efficacy and safety 71 
of Control- IQ in adults with T2D using basal-bolus insulin therapy with or without additional 72 
glucose-lowering medications.  Thus, the main objectives of this trial are: 73 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 29 OF 79 •To assess the safety of use of Control-IQ in adults with type 2 diabetes using basal-bolus 74

1.5 Potential Risks and Benefits of the Investigational Device 80 
Risks and benefits are detailed below. Loss of confidentiality is a potential risk; however, data 81 
are handled securely to minimize this risk. Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia and ketone 82 
formation are always a risk in participants with type 2 diabetes and insulin treatment, and 83 
participants will be monitored for this. 84 
1.5.1  Known Potential Risks 85 
1.5.1.1  Potential Risks of the AID System 86 
Even though the study system has been tested prior to this study, there is still a risk that parts of 87 
the system may not function properly. The following are possible reasons the system may deliver 88 
too much insulin or incorrectly stop insulin delivery: 89 
CGM sensor reads higher or lower than the actual glucose level which increases risk for 90 
hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia with automated insulin delivery system; 91 
Device malfunctions that could produce a suspension of insulin delivery or over delivery of 92 
insulin. 93 
1.5.1.1  Potential Risks of Using Insulin Aspart 94 
Potential adverse reactions with study-provided insulin aspart are similar to other insulins: 95 
hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, allergic reactions, injection-site reactions, lipodystrophy, localized 96 
cutaneous amyloidosis, pruritus, rash, weight gain, and peripheral edema. 97 
1.5.1.2  Potential Risks of CGM 98 
CGM will be used by the control group without automation of insulin delivery.  There is risk of 99 
CGM inaccuracy that could lead to an under dosing of insulin producing hyperglycemia or 100 
overdosing of insulin producing hypoglycemia. 101 
1.5.1.3  Risk of Hypoglycemia 102 
As with any person having diabetes and using insulin, there is always a risk of hypoglycemia. 103 
The frequency of hypoglycemia should be no more and possibly less than it would be as part of 104 
daily living. Symptoms of hypoglycemia can include sweating, jitteriness, and not feeling well. 105 
Just as at home, there is the possibility of fainting or seizures (convulsions) and that for a few 106 
days the participant may not be as aware of symptoms of hypoglycemia. A CGM functioning 107 
poorly and significantly over-reading glucose values could lead to inappropriate insulin delivery. 108 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 30 OF 79 1.5.1.4  Risk of Hyperglycemia 109 
Hyperglycemia and ketonemia could occur if insulin delivery is attenuated or suspended for an 110 
extended period or if the pump or infusion set is not working properly. Although less common in 111 
individuals with type 2 diabetes than in those with type 1 diabetes, DKA can still occur. Extreme 112 
levels of hyperglycemia and dehydration can lead to hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome 113 
(HHS). A CGM functioning poorly and significantly under-reading glucose values could lead to 114 
inappropriate suspension of insulin delivery. All subjects will be issued a glucose meter and 115 
glucose test strips, as well as a ketone meter and ketone test strips, to use to carefully monitor for 116 
hyperglycemia and ketones and be given instructions on how to mitigate hyperglycemia and 117 
ketosis should it occur. 118 
1.5.1.5  Fingerstick Risks 119 
About 1 drop of blood will be removed by fingerstick for measuring blood glucose, ketones, and 120 
sometimes Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). This is a standard method used to obtain blood for routine 121 
hospital laboratory tests. Pain is common at the time of lancing. In about 1 in 10 cases, a small 122 
amount of bleeding under the skin will produce a bruise. A small scar may persist for several 123 
weeks. The risk of local infection is less than 1 in 1000. This should not be a significant 124 
contributor to risks in this study as fingersticks are part of the usual care for people with diabetes. 125 
1.5.1.6  Venipuncture Risks 126 
A hollow needle/plastic tube may be placed in the arm for taking blood samples. Blood draws 127 
can cause some common reactions like pain, bruising, or redness at the sampling site. Less 128 
common reactions include bleeding from the sampling site, formation of a small blood clot or 129 
swelling of the vein and surrounding tissues, and fainting. 130 
1.5.1.7  Subcutaneous Catheter Risks 131 
Whenever the skin is broken there is the possibility of bleeding and bruising. The CGM sensor 132 
and pump infusion sets are inserted under the skin. It is possible that any part that is inserted 133 
under the skin may cause an infection, which could produce swelling, redness, and pain. These 134 
occur very infrequently, but if an infection were to occur, oral and/or topical antibiotics may be 135 
prescribed. The risk of skin problems could be greater if a sensor or infusion set is used for 136 
longer than it is intended to be used. Therefore, participants will be carefully instructed about 137 
proper use of these components. 138 
On rare occasions, the CGM sensor may break and leave a small portion of the sensor probe 139 
under the skin that may cause redness, swelling or pain at the insertion site. The participant will 140 
be instructed to notify the site immediately if this occurs. 141 
1.5.1.8  Risk of Exercise 142 
Exercise may lead to injury, hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, or significant events, such as 143 
myocardial infarction or other significant cardiac events.   Participants completing the exercise 144 
challenges will be evaluated for their suitability to participate in the exercise challenges, which 145 
will minimize the risk. Participants will be instructed on how to prepare for exercise by study staff 146 
and intended use of the exercise activity feature. 147 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 31 OF 79 1.5.1.9  Risk of Device Reuse 148 
All devices will be used by a single study participant only. There will be no device reuse. 149 
1.5.1.10  Questionnaires 150 
As part of the study, participants will complete questionnaires which include questions about 151 
their private attitudes, feelings and behavior related to the investigational equipment as well as 152 
managing diabetes. It is possible that some people may find these questionnaires and interviews 153 
to be mildly upsetting. Similar questionnaires and interviews have been used in previous research 154 
and these types of reactions have been uncommon. 155 
1.5.1.11  Other Risks 156 
Some participants may develop skin irritation or allergic reactions to the adhesives used to secure 157 
the CGM, or from tape to secure the insulin infusion sets for the continuous subcutaneous insulin 158 
infusion. If these reactions occur, different adhesives or “under -taping” (such as with IV 3000, 159 
Tegaderm, etc.) will be tried, sites will be rotated frequently, and a mild topical steroid cream or 160 
other medication may be required. 161 
Data downloaded from the CGM, pump, and the home glucose and ketone meter will be 162 
collected for the study as measures of diabetes self-management behaviors. Downloaded data 163 
from the participant’s personal CGM or pump (if any) will include data from prior to the date of 164 
the screening visit. Some people may be uncomfortable with the researchers ’ having such 165 
detailed information about their daily diabetes habits. 166 
1.5.2  Known Potential Benefits 167 
Participants may experience a significant improvement in glucose control. Hypoglycemia is the 168 
number one fear of many individuals taking insulin, and this fear often prevents optimal 169 
glycemic control. Hyperglycemia will likely be reduced as well. 170 
In addition, users of insulin pumps often take less insulin than users of basal/bolus injection 171 
therapy. This may lead to weight loss, which will be tracked over the course of the study. 172 
It is expected that this protocol will yield increased knowledge about using an AID system to 173 
control glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes. The individual participant may or may not 174 
benefit from study participation. 175 
1.5.3  Risk Assessment 176 
It is the assessment of the investigators that this protocol is a clinical investigation involving 177 
greater than minimal risk but that it does present the prospect of direct benefit to individual 178 
subjects based on the following: (1) individuals with diabetes experience hypoglycemia and 179 
hyperglycemia frequently as a consequence of the disease and its management, (2) the study 180 
intervention involves periodic automated insulin dosing that may reduce the likelihood of 181 
hypoglycemia, and periodic automated attenuation of insulin delivery that may reduce the 182 
likelihood of hyperglycemia, (3) if any, hypo and/or hyperglycemia occur, mitigations are in 183 
place, and have been tested in prior studies using the investigational device system in the home 184 
setting, that limit the likelihood of excessive insulin dosing or prolonged withdrawal of insulin, 185 
and (4) rapid reversal of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia can be achieved, In addition, it is the 186 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 32 OF 79 belief of the investigators that this study also presents prospect of general benefit to others with 187 
diabetes. 188 
1.6 General Considerations 189 
The study is being conducted in compliance with the policies described in the study policies 190 
document, with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, with 191 
the protocol described herein, and with the standards of Good Clinical Practice (GCP). 192 
In accordance with 21 CFR 812.66, the protocol is considered a significant risk device study, due 193 
to the fact that the closed loop system is investigational in the population under study.  194 
Therefore, an investigational device exemption (IDE) from the U.S. Food and Drug 195 
Administration (FDA) is required to conduct the study. 196 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 33 OF 79 Chapter 2:  Study Enrollment and Screening 197

least 300 participants completing the trial. A maximum of 450 individuals may be consented for 200 
screening in order to achieve this goal.  Participants who have signed consent and started the 201 
screening process may be permitted to continue into the trial, if eligible, even if the completion 202 
goal has been reached. 203 
Study participants will be recruited from ~20-25 clinical sites in the United States and Canada. 204 
The maximum number that can be randomized by any site is 66.  Up to 30 participants will be 205 
randomized from Canada. All eligible participants will be included without regard to gender, 206 
race, or ethnicity. There is no restriction on the number of participants to be enrolled by each 207 
clinical center toward the overall recruitment goal. 208 
There will be approximate recruitment goals for the following: 209

of individuals who contact the site. Study recruitment methods may consist of one or more of the 223 
following: 224 
oCulling of pre-existing databases at the clinical sites to identify patients who may be 225 
eligible. Those identified will be contacted via IRB-approved mailing sent through post, 226 
email, or via phone and will be provided information about the study and how to proceed 227 
if potentially interested; 228 
oIRB-approved press release announcing study and study fact sheet; 229 
oIRB-approved information about the study distributed through support groups, other 230 
internet groups, patient education classes, not-for-profit organizations; 231

TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 38 OF 79 Chapter 3:  CGM Run-in 374 
3.1 CGM Run-in Overview 375 
This phase will generally begin on the day when screening is complete but must begin within 7 376 
days of completion of screening. The purpose of this CGM run-in phase is 1) to initiate use of 377 
the study CGM (unblinded) in participants without current use of a Dexcom CGM and 2) to 378 
assess compliance with use of the CGM and study procedures over a period of at least 21 days.  379 
Participants who currently use a Dexcom G6 CGM with at least 85% of possible CGM readings 380 
captured during the 14 days prior to enrollment can skip the CGM Run-in phase. Participants 381 
who do not currently use a Dexcom G6 CGM, or who do use that CGM but have <85% of 382 
possible CGM readings in the 14 days prior to the time of enrollment, will be required to 383 
participate in the CGM Run-in. 384 
Participants will continue to use their personal insulin delivery method (pump or MDI) during 385 
the Run-in. 386 
Participants will be provided with CGM supplies, the study blood glucose meter, study ketone 387 
meter, and test strips; and will be trained on their use. 388 
3.2 Initiation of CGM 389 
During an in-clinic visit, participants required to complete the CGM Run-in will be trained and a 390 
sensor will be inserted. Study CGM supplies will be provided and the participant will be 391 
instructed to use the study CGM on a daily basis. Participants using a personal CGM prior to the 392 
study will discontinue the ir personal CGM while using a study CGM. 393 
3.2.1  CGM Training 394 
CGM training will be provided by a qualified trainer to participants not currently using a 395 
personal CGM identical to the study CGM with respect to how to use it in real-time to make 396 
management decisions and how to review the data after an upload for retrospective review. CGM 397 
training will include: 398 
•Instruction on how to insert the sensor and transmitter, including observation/supervision 399 
of placement of a sensor 400 
•Instruction on how to calibrate the CGM, if needed, in accordance with manufacturer 401 
labelling 402 
•Guidance on accessing the CGM trace, either through a manufacturer-provided software 403 
app or via a study-provided CGM receiver unit, or via a personal insulin pump if 404 
participants use a pump that integrates with the study CGM 405 
•Participants will be asked to perform fingerstick blood glucose measurements in 406 
accordance with the labeling of the study CGM device 407 
A copy of the study CGM user’s guide will be provided to the participant.  408 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 39 OF 79 Participants may use available manufacturer-provided CGM software and features of the study 409 
CGM related to mobile data access or remote monitoring, but will be instructed not to use any 410 
third-party components for this purpose. 411 
Upon completion of the CGM training components, study staff will document, using a checklist, 412 
that the participant is familiar with the functions/features/tasks addressed during the training. 413 
At investigator discretion or participant request, contacts may occur with participant during run- 414 
in phase for further training on use of CGM. 415 
Adjustments can be made in the participant’s insulin dosing at investigator discretion during the 416 
CGM Run-in. 417 
3.3 Assessment of Successful Completion of the CGM Run-in Phase 418 
Participants will have a follow-up visit 21-28 days (target 21 days) after initiation of the run-in 419 
phase to assess CGM usage.  Procedures will include downloading of the study CGM data and 420 
the following: 421 
•Assessment of compliance with the use of CGM to obtain at least 85% of possible CGM 422 
values during the most recent 14 days of CGM data collection 423 
•Assessment of skin reaction in areas where a CGM sensor was worn or other safety 424 
issues associated with CGM use 425 
Participants who fail to meet the minimum CGM use requirement, or whom the investigator 426 
believes may benefit from an extension of the CGM run- in period, may at the investigator’s 427 
discretion be allowed to continue CGM run-in for up to an additional 14 days. These participants 428 
will have another follow-up visit approximately 14 days after the prior visit for a reassessment 429 
using the same procedures as described above. 430 
Participants who do not meet CGM use requirements after the second CGM wear period or 431 
otherwise fail to meet study eligibility requirements will be withdrawn from the study. 432 
For participants entering the RCT, the most recent 14 days of CGM data will be used as the 433 
baseline for analyses. 434 
435 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 40 OF 79 Chapter 4:  Randomization Visit 436 
4.1 Overview 437 
For participants completing the CGM Run-in, the randomization visit generally will occur on the 438 
same day immediately following the CGM Run-in Visit.  If the participant is not ready to start 439 
the AID system if assigned to the intervention group, the Randomization Visit must occur within 440 
14 days after completion of the run-in phase. For participants skipping the CGM Run-in, the 441 
Randomization Visit could occur on same day as Screening Visit (once all eligibility has been 442 
verified) or within 14 days following the Screening Visit. 443 
At this visit, eligibility will be reaffirmed and participants will be random ly assigned to the AID 444 
group or Control group. 445 
4.2 Testing and Procedures 446 
The following will be done at the Randomization Visit: 447 
•Review medical history since Screening Visit to verify that there have been no changes or 448 
events that affect participant eligibility, any adverse events that may have occurred since 449 
their last study visit, and any changes in medications or doses (if not on the same day as 450 
the Screening Visit) 451 
•Verify that participant understands the protocol and is willing to accept assignment to 452 
either treatment group 453 
•Measure height, weight, blood pressure and pulse (if Randomization Visit is not on same 454 
day as Screening Visit) 455 
•Urine pregnancy test for participants capable of becoming pregnant (if Randomization 456 
Visit is not on the same day as the Screening Visit) 457 
•Blood draw for central lab measurements of HbA1c, lipids, creatinine, C-peptide, 458 
glucose, GAD antibodies 459 
•Randomization 460 
•Training and instructions for each treatment group 461 
•Distribution of study devices and supplies to participants according to the assigned 462 
treatment group 463 
oBoth groups will be provided with Dexcom G6 sensors and transmitters, the study 464 
blood glucose meter, study ketone meter, and test strips; and will be trained on their 465 
use 466 
4.3 Randomization 467 
Participants will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to the AID group or the Control group. 468 
The participant’s randomization group assignment is determined by entering the Randomization 469 
Visit data on the study website.  JCHR will construct a Master Randomization List using a block 470 
design separately for each center. 471 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 41 OF 79 Note: To minimize an imbalance in the number of participants assigned to each group, 472 
randomization will not be stratified by age, HbA1c or other factors because of the small number 473 
per site that is possible and considering the 2:1 randomization. 474 
4.4 Instructions for Both Groups 475 
Study staff will review the use of the study CGM, blood glucose meter, and ketone meter. The 476 
following instructions will be given to both groups: 477 
•Participants will be advised not to use alcohol or other drugs in sufficient quantity to 478 
reduce sensitivity to symptoms of hypoglycemia or hinder appropriate decision-making. 479 
•Any medical advice needed by the participants during their participation that is not 480 
directly related to the study protocol should be obtained in the usual manner with their 481 
own physician. 482 
•There are no restrictions of any kind on diet, exercise, or other activities 483 
•Hypoglycemia low threshold alerts will be set to no lower than 70 mg/dL. If a low alarm 484 
occurs, the participant will be trained to verify the glucose level with a fingerstick 485 
glucose using the study blood glucose meter. If the blood glucose meter confirms 486 
hypoglycemia, participants will be instructed to treat with ~15 grams of carbohydrate and 487 
to continue to monitor their glucose levels until hypoglycemia has resolved. 488 
•Additional material that is IRB approved, to include Tandem infusion set insertion 489 
videos, may be used to supplement training. The IRB approved handouts related to fixed 490 
dosing, small/medium/large meals, carb counting, and pump therapy basics may be used 491 
by the training staff as judged necessary for a given participant’s needs, whether in the 492 
Control or AID group. 493 
4.5 Instructions for the Control Group 494 
Participants in the Control group will be instructed to follow their usual diabetes management 495 
with respect to insulin delivery. They will be asked to use CGM daily throughout the RCT in 496 
accordance with manufacturer labelling. Participants will receive training on hyperglycemia and 497 
ketosis management, similar to that described for the AID Group in section 4.6.4 , that is 498 
customized for the participant based on the type of insulin delivery being used. 499 
4.6 Instructions for the AID Group 500 
The approach to training will depend on whether the participant is already a pump user.  The 501 
training on use of the AID system may occur completely at this visit or may be spread out over a 502 
few days in multiple visits or contacts.  Initiation of the study pump and closed-loop control 503 
generally will occur on the day of the Randomization Visit but can be deferred if the investigator 504 
believes additional training is needed prior to initiating the study pump.  In such cases, initiation 505 
of the study pump and Control IQ should occur no more than 7 days following randomization. 506 
Participants will be informed of the need to have a care partner trained and capable of treating 507 
severe hypoglyce mia, including use of glucagon as indicated in section 6.3. 508 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 42 OF 79 4.6.1  Study Pump Training 509 
Participants will receive study pump training on use of the pump in open-loop mode by a 510 
qualified trainer: 511 
•Participants will be fully instructed on the study insulin pump. The trainer will discuss 512 
differences from the participant’s personal pump, if applicable, in important aspects such 513 
as calculation of insulin on board and correction boluses and optional additional topics 514 
such as: infusion site initiation, cartridge/priming procedures, setting up the pump, 515 
charging the pump, navigation through menus, bolus procedures including stopping a 516 
bolus, etc. 517 
•Participants will be instructed to change the study insulin pump infusion set at least once 518 
every 3 days or per manufacturer guidelines, whichever is shorter. 519 
•Participants will be trained to use the pump’s bolus calculator. 520 
•The study team will assist the participant in study pump infusion site initiation and will 521 
start the participant on the study pump. The study pump will be programmed with the 522 
participant’s usual basal rates and pump parameters, if applicable. The participant’s 523 
personal pump, if used, will be removed. 524 
•The participant will be supervised with the study pump during at least one meal or snack 525 
bolus to ensure participant understanding of the pump features. 526 
•The participant will be encouraged to review the written information provided with the 527 
pump and infusion sets after the training is completed. 528 
•The participant will be trained on severe hypoglycemia emergency procedures including 529 
removal of the study pump and administration of glucagon. 530 
•The participant will be assessed for understanding of the system interface and how to react 531 
to safety/alert messages. 532 
•To prevent insulin stacking from long-acting basal insulin that is on board, participant s 533 
using long-acting insulin injections at baseline will be instructed, and supervised by study 534 
staff, to set a temp basal rate to 0% that will end 24 hours after last injection of long-acting 535 
insulin, at which time the pre-programmed basal rate will be turned on. Study investigators 536 
may adjust this procedure per their usual clinical practice, and may customize this plan 537 
based on the type of basal insulin used (for example, insulin degludec with a longer half- 538 
life may require a basal rate of 50% for a second day). 539 
A copy of the study pump user’s guide will be provided to the participant.  540 
Study-provided insulin aspart will be offered to the participant, who will be instructed on the 541 
proper storage and use of the insulin during the course of the study. 542 
4.6.1.1  Initiation of Pump by MDI Participants 543 
For MDI participants being started on the study pump, an initial basal insulin profile will be 544 
customized on a per-participant basis. Total daily insulin dose will be reduced by approximately 545 
20% as a general rule, with a recommended method outlined in a separate procedures’ manual. 546 
547 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 43 OF 79 Site investigators may make further adjustment to insulin delivery profile settings ONLY for safety 548 
concerns and will document reasons for change in the CRF. 549 
4.6.2  Training on Using the Pump with Control-IQ Technology 550 
Participants will receive instruction from a qualified trainer on use of the study pump in closed- 551 
loop mode, to include the following: 552 
•How to turn on and off Control-IQ technology 553 
•How to understand when Control-IQ is increasing or decreasing basal rates 554 
•How to administer a meal or correction boluses during closed-loop system use 555 
•What to do when exercising while using the system in closed-loop mode 556 
•How to enable the sleep function and set the sleep schedule 557 
oSleep activity will be enabled during normal sleep time for all users unless a 558 
safety concern arises as judged by the investigator. 559 
•The participant will be assessed for understanding of the system interface and how to react 560 
to safety/alert messages. 561 
Upon completion of the study pump training components, study staff will document, using a 562 
checklist, that the participant is familiar with the functions/features/tasks addressed during the 563 
training. 564 
4.6.3  System Use Guidelines 565 
The participant will be instructed to use the system in closed-loop mode except if insulin is 566 
delivered by any means other than the study pump (e.g. injection of subcutaneous insulin via 567 
syringe in the event of infusion site failure). 568 
•If insulin is delivered by any means other than the study pump, the participant will be 569 
instructed to turn off Control-IQ for four hours. 570 
Participants will be provided with contact information and will be asked to call the study 571 
clinical staff for any health-related issues and for technical issues with the system. They will be 572 
instructed to contact study staff in case of illness with an elevated temperature >101.5 degrees 573 
Fahrenheit (38.6 degrees Celsius), other periods of significant illness, or during periods of use of 574 
medications such as epinephrine for the emergency treatment of a severe allergic reaction or 575 
asthma attack in addition to use of oral or injectable glucocorticoids to determine if closed-loop 576 
use should be temporarily discontinued. 577 
Participants may use the study pump without Control-IQ activated and study CGM during periods 578 
of component disconnections or technical difficulties. 579 
4.6.4  Hyperglycemia and Ketosis Detection and Management 580 
Unlike in type 1 diabetes, for participants with type 2 diabetes, hyperglycemia by itself, without 581 
any other symptoms, is not a medical emergency indicating the need for ketone checking. 582 
Participants may have had significant amount of hyperglycemia prior to the study and may 583 
periodically have hyperglycemia for missed boluses. Participants who are on SGLT inhibitors, 584 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 44 OF 79 GLP-1 receptor agonists, or DPP-IV inhibitors could also develop ketones at lower glucose 585 
values (<250 mg/dl), where euglycemic DKA could occur. Therefore, participants will be 586 
instructed to check ketones based on signs or symptoms of ketonemia or general illness, to 587 
include abdominal pain/nausea/emesis/increased polyuria or feeling unwell, as well as during 588 
times of intercurrent illness (i.e., fever). Participants will be instructed to contact the study site 589 
for any ketone values ≥ 0.6  mmol/L or for additional guidance on sick day management. If the 590 
ketone value is <0.6 mmol/L but symptoms persist, the participant will be instructed to recheck 591 
ketones after one hour. 592 
If ketone level is ≥ 0.6 mmol/L and study staff cannot be immediately contacted, the participant 593 
will be instructed to: 594 
•Perform a blood glucose meter check. 595 
•Take correction insulin calculated to achieve a target glucose of 150 mg/dL with an 596 
insulin syringe and change insulin pump infusion site. 597 
•Continue to monitor their glucose and blood ketone levels until ketones are < 0.6 598 
mmol/L. 599 
•If correction insulin is administered via insulin syringe, turn Control-IQ off for four 600 
hours. 601 
•If vomiting, go to the Emergency Room. 602 
Participants will be permitted to change the hyperglycemia alarm setting, but will be instructed 603 
to choose a value no greater than 300 mg/dL. 604 
605 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 45 OF 79 Chapter 5:  RCT  606 
5.1 Overview 607 
The RCT will last for 13 weeks.   Procedures to be followed by the Control Group are described in 608 
section 4.5 and procedures to be followed by the AID group in section 4.6. 609 
5.2 Follow-up Visits and Contacts 610 
The AID group will have a training/check-in contact 3 ±1 days after initiating the AID system 611 
for further review of training materials and to answer questions. Participants will be specifically 612 
instructed to contact the site for any issues that arise during the first infusion set change.  613 
Otherwise the visit and contact schedule will be the same for both groups. 614 
•Contact (phone or video) will occur after 7±2 days for a safety check. 615 
•Clinic visits will occur at 4 weeks ± 4 days and 13 weeks ± 4 days. 616 
•Visit or contact at 8 weeks ± 4 days (depending on whether participant is able to upload 617 
device data at home and whether investigator believes clinic visit is needed). 618 
Additional office visits may occur as needed at investigator discretion. 619 
If necessary, visits should be completed out-of-window rather than missed. A visit is not 620 
considered missed until the next visit/phone window opens. In the event that in-person visits 621 
cannot be conducted due to institutional restrictions or the participant’s unwillingness to attend 622 
an in-person clinic visit, visits may be conducted virtually via a HIPAA-compliant Zoom o r 623 
similar video conference mechanism to collect whatever data is possible to collect remotely.  624 
Participants will be instructed to download the study CGM and pump prior to each scheduled 625 
contact. 626 
5.2.1  Contact and Visit Procedures 627 
At each scheduled contact and visit for both groups, the following will be done: 628 
•AID system and CGM data will be reviewed (participants without the ability to upload 629 
the device data from home will be provided with a laptop to use during the study) 630 
•Site investigators may adjust insulin delivery profile settings ONLY for safety concerns 631 
and will document reasons for changes in the CRF. 632 
•Occurrence of adverse events will be solicited 633 
•Assessment of TDD over last week 634 
At the 4-week clinic visit and 8-week clinic visit (if it occurs in clinic), the following also will be 635 
done: 636 
•Height, weight, blood pressure/pulse measured 637 
638 
At 13-week visit, the following also will be done: 639 
•Height, weight, blood pressure/pulse measured 640 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 46 OF 79 •Blood draw for central lab measurement of HbA1c, lipids, creatinine 641 
•PRO surveys completed 642 
5.3 Transition to Pre-study Insulin Therapy 643 
At the end of the RCT , study staff will supervise the participant’s transition back to their prior 644 
therapy.  645 
•Study staff will re- evaluate the subject’s baseline therapy doses, noting changes in basal 646 
rates, carbohydrate ratios, and correction factors in use at the end of the trial. 647 
•Participants must have two CGM or fingerstick blood glucose values, separated by at 648 
least 15 minutes, that are above 80 mg/dL prior to discharge from the clinic. 649 
•Study staff will confirm subjects have carbohydrates on hand for their drive back home, 650 
and instruct subjects to check their glucose levels when they arrive at home, prior to 651 
bedtime, and at least one time overnight on the first night to monitor for hypoglycemia, 652 
reminding subjects that insulin on board can be active for the next few hours even after 653 
stopping the study pump. 654 
5.3.1  3-Day Post-Study or Discontinuation of AID System Contact 655 
Participants will have a post-study contact 3 (±1) days after permanently discontinuing the study 656 
AID system and transitioning back to their prior insulin therapy (which for most participants will 657 
be at the end of the RCT ), during which the following will occur: 658 
•Check on transition back to usual home diabetes care 659 
•Assessment of adverse events 660 
5.4 Safety Visits Following Changes in Glucose-Lowering or Weight- 661 
Reduction Medications 662 
The only changes of glucose-lowering or weight-reduction medications permitted will be a 663 
reduction in dose for safety reasons, or an adjustment to an equivalent dose of a different 664 
formulation if participant’s insurance  coverage changes. No increased doses or initiation of a 665 
new glucose-lowering or weight-reduction medication will be permitted. 666 
If a participant in the AID group has a reduction in dose or requires a change of glucose- 667 
lowering or weight-reduction medication due to insurance coverage, an unscheduled visit will 668 
occur after 1-2 days and 7 days to assess safety. 669 
5.5 Early Termination Visit 670 
Participants in the AID group who discontinue use of the AID system will be asked to continue 671 
using the study CGM and remain in the study through the 13-week visit. 672 
In the event of participant withdrawal or early termination in both groups, participants will be 673 
asked to come to clinic for an end of study visit.   If the visit occurs 4 or more weeks after 674 
randomization, the procedures listed for the 13-week visit will be completed (may be combined 675 
with the 4-week visit if in window for the 4-week visit). 676 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 47 OF 79 Participants in the AID group who discontinue use of the AID system prior to the end of the RCT  677 
and have not already resumed their pre-study insulin regimen will be transitioned back to their pre- 678 
study insulin regimen as described in section 5.3 and will have a 3-day post-study call.  679 
680 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 48 OF 79 Chapter 6:  Exercise and Meal Challenges 681 
6.1 Overview 682 
All participants in the AID group will be asked to perform 3 meal challenges and 3 exercise 683 
challenges unless ineligible due to cardiac or other safety concerns, with the expectation that the 684 
majority of participants in the AID group will complete all challenges. 685 
Participants will be advised that for the exercise challenges, they must have a care partner 686 
capable of providing treatment for severe hypoglycemia, including glucagon use, who will be 687 
present during and for one hour following each study exercise challenge. Training will be 688 
provided by study staff to the care partner as needed. 689 
Approximately 25% of each type of challenge (meal or exercise) will be performed on 3 690 
consecutive days within each of the following 4 periods time from randomization: 1-2 weeks, 3- 691 
4 weeks, 5-6 weeks, 7-8 weeks.  Challenges that cannot be scheduled during these time periods 692 
or challenges that need to be rescheduled may be performed, if necessary, between weeks 9 and 693 
13. 694 
Participants will be instructed to communicate with study staff within one day prior to each 695 
challenge to review procedures and to have a contact with study staff after the completion of 696 
each challenge within one day. 697 
6.2 Meal Challenges 698 
The 3 meal challenges will be performed on 3 consecutive days while the study AID system is 699 
being used. The same meal should be used for each of the 3 meal challenges —either lunch or 700 
dinner (participant choice). 701 
The three meal challenges will consist of: 702 
•No bolus for the meal 703 
•50% bolus – calculate the bolus dose using the bolus calculator and deliver half the 704 
recommended dose of insulin. 705 
•Full bolus for the meal based on calculated bolus dose using the bolus calculator. 706 
For each meal challenge, participants will: 707 
1.Be in a fasting state for two hours prior to consuming the meal and the last manual 708 
insulin bolus more than two hours prior to the meal. 709 
2.Only begin the meal challenge if CGM glucose is between 70 mg/dL and 200 mg/dL and 710 
CGM trend arrow is not rapidly rising (straight up arrow).  Subjects with hyperglycemia 711 
> 200mg/dL will reschedule their challenge for another time. If < 70 mg/dL, 712 
carbohydrate treatment can be given, after which the meal challenge can continue. 713 
3.Consume at least 50 grams carbohydrate for the meal. Each participant will use the same 714 
meal for all of their meal challenges in the study. Participants will be encouraged to use 715 
the same frozen entrée of their choice for consistency. 716 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 49 OF 79 4.Write down the start and end time of eating the meal, as well as the meal content (to 717 
include amount of carbohydrate, protein and fat) on the study provided logbook. 718 
5.Not give an additional bolus for up to 3 hours after the meal challenge, unless BG is 719 
above 300 mg/dL for more than 1 hour, or symptoms of hyperglycemia develop. 720 
6.Not take additional carbohydrates for up to 3 hours after the meal challenge, unless BG is 721 
< 70 mg/dL, or symptoms of hypoglycemia develop. 722 
7.Not exercise for 3 hours after the meal challenge. 723 
8.Notify the site within 24 hours after completion of each meal challenge. 724 
9.The meal challenge will end 3 hours after the meal is completed. 725 
If a meal challenge needs to be rescheduled due to out-of-range glucose value or an unforeseen 726 
circumstance, it should be completed on a separate day (same meal, lunch or dinner) as soon as 727 
possible. 728 
6.3 Exercise Challenges 729 
The 3 exercise challenges will be  performed on 3 consecutive days while the study AID system 730 
is being used. 731 
The 3 exercise challenges will include one-hour exercise periods, which include at least 30 732 
minutes of moderate exercise. All challenges will be performed unsupervised at home, with 733 
required study team contacts before and after each challenge. As indicated below, a care partner 734 
will need to be present during and for one hour after the exercise session. 735 
For each exercise challenge, participants will: 736 
1.Have a care partner, capable of providing treatment for severe hypoglycemia, to include 737 
glucagon use, who is present during and for 1 hour after the exercise challenges. The care 738 
partner will receive training as needed. 739 
2.Have carbohydrate containing snacks and glucagon on hand during and after exercise. 740 
3.Activate “exercise activity” (required) on the pump up to 45 to 60 minutes ahead of 741 
actual exercise, to allow for less insulin on board when starting exercise. The timing of 742 
exercise activity activation may be adjusted per their usual routine and investigator 743 
guidance. Consider reducing the last meal bolus prior to exercise as a way to reduce 744 
insulin on board and limit hypoglycemia. 745 
4.Perform one hour of exercise, including at least half an hour of moderate activity. 746 
Exercise does not need to be the same activity each time. 747 
5.Only begin exercise if CGM glucose is ≥ 120 mg/dL and CGM glucose is not trending 748 
downward. If glucose is <120 mg/dL, carbohydrate can be taken and exercise may begin 749 
once the glucose level is ≥120 mg/dL. 750 
6.Write down the start time of last meal and amount and time of last insulin dose, whether 751 
the prior meal insulin bolus was intentionally reduced in preparation for exercise, type of 752 
exercise performed, as well as the start and stop time of each exercise session in the study 753 
logbook (as this may not correlate exactly with exercise activity use on the pump) . 754 
Participants may take breaks if needed, as long as the full hour of activity is completed. 755 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 50 OF 79 7.Stop the exercise challenges at any point for injury or development of new symptoms; 756 
development of chest pain/pressure, feeling unwell, development of hypoglycemic 757 
symptoms, undue shortness of breath, signs of poor perfusion (leg pain/claudication), or 758 
for any other reason. 759 
8.Immediately contact the study team for acute symptoms (such as chest pain, leg pain, 760 
persistent shortness of breath), or seek immediate medical assistance for acute symptoms 761 
if the study team is not reachable. 762 
9.Notify the site within 24 hours after completion of each exercise challenge. Participants 763 
will be asked if they developed new symptoms and review guidance on the need to stop 764 
future exercise challenges if any adverse events or new symptoms occurred per clinician 765 
judgement based on the severity of symptoms. 766 
10.The exercise challenge will end after 1 hour of the required activity is completed. 767 
If an exercise challenge needs to be rescheduled due to out-of-range glucose value or an 768 
unforeseen circumstance, it should be completed on a separate day as soon as possible. 769 
6.4 Meal and Exercise Challenge Follow- Up 770 
Participants will be instructed to contact study staff within 24 hours of completing each exercise 771 
challenge. The follow up call will review: 772 
•The start and stop time, as well as the type of exercise performed. 773 
•Assessment of adverse events 774 
•Documentation of any safety concerns if future exercise challenges are cancelled. 775

TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 55 OF 79 Chapter 9:  Unanticipated Problem, Adverse Event, and Device Issue 865 
Reporting 866 
9.1 Unanticipated Problems 867 
Site investigators will promptly report all unanticipated problems meeting the criteria below on 868 
an eCRF. Sites relying on the Central IRB must report potential Unanticipated Problems to the 869 
IRB within seven (7) calendar days of recognition. For this protocol, an unanticipated problem is 870 
an incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: 871 
•Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures 872 
that are described in the protocol related documents, such as the IRB-approved research 873 
protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject 874 
population being studied 875 
•Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is 876 
a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused 877 
by the procedures involved in the research) 878 
•Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm than was 879 
previously known or recognized (including physical, psychological, economic, or social 880 
harm) 881 
The Sponsor (or CRO on behalf of the Sponsor) also will report to the Central IRB all potential 882 
unanticipated problems not directly involving a specific site such as unanticipated problems that 883 
occur study-wide or at another participating entity such as a pharmacy or laboratory. These 884 
instances must be reported to the Central IRB within seven (7) calendar days of recognition. The 885 
Director of the Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) will report to the appropriate 886 
regulatory authorities if the IRB determines that the event indeed meets the criteria of an 887 
Unanticipated Problem requiring additional reporting to fulfill the reporting obligations of the 888 
HRPP. 889 
9.2 Adverse Events 890 
9.2.1  Definitions 891 
Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence (including laboratory findings) 892 
associated with study procedures or occurring during the course of a study in which a device, 893 
biologic, or drug is used in humans, including any comparator used, whether or not the event is 894 
considered related (i.e., irrespective of the relationship between the adverse event and the 895 
device(s) under investigation). 896 
For this protocol an adverse event is considered any untoward medical occurrence, unintended 897 
disease or injury, or untoward clinically significant clinical sign (including abnormal laboratory 898 
findings) in a research participant that manifests while in the study if it was not present before 899 
enrolling in the study, or if it was present before enrolling, it has increased in severity, frequency 900 
or type since enrolling in the study. As used here, a participant is considered enrolled once 901 
consent has been executed. 902 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 56 OF 79 Serious Adverse Event (SAE): Any untoward medical occurrence that results in any of the 903 
following outcomes: 904 
•Death. 905 
•A life-threatening adverse event; (a non-life-threatening event which, had it been more 906 
severe, might have become life-threatening, is not necessarily considered a serious 907 
adverse event). 908 
•Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 909 
•A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 910 
conduct normal life functions (sight threatening). 911 
•A congenital anomaly or birth defect. 912 
An important medical event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 913 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it 914 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical and surgical intervention to 915 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Note: If either the Sponsor or investigator 916 
believes that the event is serious, the event must be considered serious and evaluated by the 917 
Sponsor for expedited reporting. Suspicion of transmission of infectious agents must always be 918 
considered an SAE. 919 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE): Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or 920 
any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, 921 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 922 
investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other 923 
unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or 924 
welfare of participants (21 CFR 812.3(s)). 925 
Adverse Device Effect (ADE): An adverse event related to the use of an investigational medical 926 
device. This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate 927 
instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or any malfunction of 928 
the investigational medical device. This definition includes any event resulting from use error or 929 
from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device. This includes comparator if the 930 
comparator is a medical device. (Note that an Adverse Event Form is to be completed in addition 931 
to a Device Deficiency or Issue Form, unless excluded from reporting as defined in section 9.3). 932 
Adverse Reaction (AR) : An AR is an AE for which the causal relationship between a drug and 933 
the AE is suspected. 934 
Serious Adverse Reaction (SAR) : An Adverse event which fulfill both the criteria for a Serious 935 
Adverse Event and the criteria for an Adverse Reaction. 936 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) : An SAR which is unexpected and 937 
regarded as possibly or probably related to the trial/study drug product. This event requires a 938 
submission of an IND Safety Report. See 21 CFR 312 for more information. 939 
Comparator: Medical device, therapy (e.g. active treatment, normal clinical practice), placebo or 940 
no treatment, used in the control group in a clinical investigation. (ISO 14155:2020) 941 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 57 OF 79 Device Complaints and Malfunctions: A device complication or complaint is something that 942 
happens to a device or related to device performance, whereas an adverse event happens to a 943 
participant.  A device complaint may occur independently from an AE, or along with an AE.  An 944 
AE may occur without a device complaint or there may be an AE related to a device complaint.  945 
A device malfunction is any failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or 946 
otherwise perform as intended.  Performance specifications include all claims made in the 947 
labeling for the device.  The intended performance of a device refers to the intended use for 948 
which the device is labeled or marketed. (21 CFR 803.3).  Note: for reporting purposes, sites will 949 
not be asked to distinguish between device complaints and malfunctions. 950 
Use Error : User action or lack of user action while using the medical device (3.34) that leads to a 951 
different result than that intended by the manufacturer or expected by the user. Includes the 952 
inability of the user to complete a task. Use errors can result from a mismatch between the 953 
characteristics of the user, user interface, task or use environment. Users might be aware or 954 
unaware that a use error has occurred. An unexpected physiological response of the patient is not 955 
by itself considered a use error. A malfunction of a medical device that causes an unexpected 956 
result is not considered a use error. (ISO 14155:2020)  957 
958 
9.2.2  Reportable Adverse Events 959 
For this protocol, a reportable adverse event includes any untoward medical occurrence that 960 
meets one of the following criteria: 961 
1. An SAE as defined in section 9.2.1 962 
2. An ADE  as defined in section 9.2.1 , unless excluded from reporting in section 9.3 963 
3. An AE as defined in 9.2.1  occurring in association with a study procedure 964 
4. An AE as defined in 9.2.1 not related to a device issue which leads to temporary or permanent 965 
discontinuation of a study device 966 
5. An AE as defined in 9.2.1 that affects the participant’s ability to complete any study 967 
procedures 968 
6. An AE as defined in 9.2.1 for which a visit is made to a hospital emergency department 969 
7. Hypoglycemia meeting the definition of reportable hypoglycemia in section 9.2.3 970 
8. Hyperglycemia or ketosis event meeting the criteria defined in section 9.2.4 . 971 
9. An AE as defined in section 9.2.1  considered to be related to either ineffective insulin (e.g., 972 
insulin exposed to high temperature that loses potency), signs or symptoms related to insulin 973 
infusion, or changing of type of insulin related to an AE. 974 
Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia not meeting the criteria below will not be recorded as adverse 975 
events unless associated with an Adverse Device Effect or discontinuation of the study device.  976 
Skin reactions from sensor placement are only reportable if severe and/or required treatment. 977 
All reportable AEs —whether volunteered by the participant, discovered by study personnel 978 
during questioning, or detected through physical examination, laboratory test, or other means — 979 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 58 OF 79 will be reported on an AE form online.  Each AE form is reviewed by the Medical Monitor to 980 
assess safety and to verify the coding and the reporting that is required. 981 
9.2.3  Hypoglycemic Events 982 
Hypoglycemia is only reportable as an adverse event when one of the following criteria is met: 983 
•A hypoglycemic event occurred meeting the following definition of severe 984 
hypoglycemia:  the event required assistance of another person due to altered 985 
consciousness, and required another person to actively administer carbohydrate, 986 
glucagon, or other resuscitative actions.  This means that the participant was impaired 987 
cognitively to the point that he/she was unable to treat himself/herself independently, was 988 
unable to verbalize his/ her needs, was incoherent, disoriented, and/or combative, or 989 
experienced seizure or loss of consciousness.  These episodes may be associated with 990 
sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or loss of consciousness.  If glucose 991 
measurements are not available during such an event, neurological recovery attributable 992 
to the restoration of glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event 993 
was induced by a low glucose concentration. 994 
•Evaluation or treatment was obtained at a health care provider facility for an acute event 995 
involving hypoglycemia, or the participant contacted the site and received guidance 996 
following the occurrence of an acute event involving hypoglycemia 997 
•Participant contacted the site because of the occurrence of hypoglycemia 998 
•Hypoglycemia occurred that was associated with an ADE as defined in section 9.2.1 999 
•Study device discontinued due to hypoglycemia 1000 
When a severe hypoglycemia event occurs (as defined above), a Hypoglycemia Form should be 1001 
completed in addition to the Adverse Event Form. Severe hypoglycemia events should be 1002 
considered to be serious adverse events with respect to reporting requirements. When a severe 1003 
hypoglycemia event occurs during use of a study device, it generally will be considered to be 1004 
unrelated to the device (per section 9.2.5 ) if the device functioned as intended and there does not 1005 
appear to be a flaw in how the device is intended to function. 1006 
9.2.4  Hyperglycemic/Ketotic Events 1007 
Hyperglycemia is only reportable as an adverse event when one of the following criteria is met:  1008 
•Evaluation or treatment was obtained at a health care provider facility for an acute event 1009 
involving hyperglycemia or ketosis, or the participant contacted the site and received 1010 
guidance on how to manage the hyperglycemia/ketosis 1011 
•The event involved DKA, as defined by the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial 1012 
(DCCT) and described below 1013 
oSymptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, or vomiting; 1014 
oSerum ketones >1.5 mmol/L or large/moderate urine ketones; 1015 
oEither arterial blood pH <7.30 or venous pH <7.24 or serum bicarbonate (or CO 2) 1016 
<15; and 1017 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 59 OF 79 oTreatment provided in a health care facility 1018 
•The event involved hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome (HHS), as defined by the 1019 
American Diabetes Association and described below 1020 
oSymptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, or vomiting; 1021 
oPlasma glucose levels are very elevated (typically > 600 mg/dL); 1022 
oPlasma effective osmolarity is >320 mOsm/L; 1023 
oAbsence of significant ketones; and 1024 
oTreatment provided in a health care facility 1025 
•Hyperglycemia occurred that was associated with an ADE as defined in section 9.2.1 1026 
•Study device discontinued due to hyperglycemia 1027 
When a hyperglycemia/ketotic event qualifies as an AE, or as an SAE as defined in section 9.2.1 , 1028 
a Hyperglycemia/DKA Form should be completed in addition to the Adverse Event Form. 1029 
Events meeting DKA or HHS criteria should be considered to be serious adverse events with 1030 
respect to reporting requirements. Hyperglycemia events not meeting criteria for DKA or HHS 1031 
generally will not be considered as serious adverse events unless one of the SAE criteria in 1032 
section 9.2.1  is met. 1033 
When a hyperglycemia/DKA event occurs during use of a study device, it generally will be 1034 
considered to be unrelated to the device (per section 9.2.5 ) if the device functioned as intended 1035 
and there does not appear to be a flaw in how the device is intended to function.  1036 
9.2.5  Relationship of Adverse Event to Study Investigational Device or Study 1037 
Procedure 1038 
The study investigator will assess the relationship of any adverse event to be related or unrelated 1039 
by determining if there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been caused 1040 
by the study device or study procedure. The Medical Monitor also will make this assessment, 1041 
which may or may not agree with that of the site investigator. The Medical Monitor will have the 1042 
final say in determining the causality as well as whether an event is classified as a serious 1043 
adverse event and/or an unanticipated adverse device effect. Reporting requirements will be 1044 
based on the Medical Monitor’s assessment as the Sponsor’s representative, with both the site 1045 
investigator’s and the Medical Monitor’s assessment reported.  1046 
Reporting requirements will be based on the Medical Monitor’s assessment as the Sponsor’s 1047 
representative. 1048 
To ensure consistency of adverse event causality assessments, investigators should apply the 1049 
following general guideline when determining whether an adverse event is related: 1050 
Unrelated:  The AE is clearly not related to a study device/procedure and a likely alternative 1051 
etiology exists such as an underlying disease, environmental or toxic factors or other 1052 
therapy. 1053 
Unlikely Related:  The AE does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence during or after 1054 
use of study device or a study procedure and a more likely alternative etiology exists such 1055 
as an underlying disease, environmental or toxic factors, or other therapy.  1056 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 60 OF 79 Possibly Related:  The AE occurred in a reasonable time during or after use of study device 1057 
or a study procedure; but could be related to another factor such as an underlying disease, 1058 
environmental or toxic factors, or other therapy; and there is a possible, though weak, 1059 
scientific basis for establishing a causal association between the AE and the study 1060 
drug/device. 1061 
Probably Related:  The AE occurred in a reasonable time during or after use of study device 1062 
or a study procedure; is unlikely to be related to another factor such as an underlying 1063 
disease, environmental or toxic factors, or other therapy; and there is a plausible, though 1064 
not strong, scientific basis for establishing a causal association between the AE and the 1065 
study drug/device.  1066 
Definitely Related:  The AE occurred in a reasonable time during or after use of study device 1067 
or a study procedure; cannot be explained by another factor such as an underlying disease, 1068 
environmental or toxic factors, or therapy; and there is a strong scientific basis for 1069 
establishing a causal association between the AE and the study drug/device.  1070 
Where these relatedness categories are used, events determined to be Possibly Related, Probably 1071 
Related, or Definitely Related will be considered to meet the reasonable possibility  causality 1072 
standard for relatedness and necessitate reporting as required (see 21 CFR 312.32 for more 1073 
information about this standard ). 1074 
9.2.6  Severity (Intensity ) of Adverse Events 1075 
The severity (intensity) of an adverse event will be rated on a three-point scale: (1) mild, (2) 1076 
moderate, or (3) severe.  A severity assessment is a clinical determination of the intensity of an 1077 
event. Thus, a severe adverse event is not necessarily serious.  For example, itching for several 1078 
days may be rated as severe, but may not be clinically serious. 1079 
MILD: Usually transient, requires no special treatment, and does not interfere with the 1080 
participant’s daily activities.  1081 
MODERATE: Usually causes a low level of inconvenience, discomfort or concern to the 1082 
participant and may interfere with daily activities, but is usually ameliorated by simple 1083 
therapeutic measures and participant is able to continue in study. 1084 
SEVERE: Interrupts a participant’s usual daily activities , causes severe discomfort, may cause 1085 
discontinuation of study device, and generally requires systemic drug therapy or other treatment. 1086 
9.2.7  Expectedness 1087 
For a serious adverse event that is considered possibly related to the study, a study procedure, or 1088 
the study device, the Medical Monitor will classify the event as unexpected if the nature, 1089 
severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously 1090 
described in the approved labelling of the study system (most recent summary of product 1091 
characteristics in the labelling). 1092 
9.2.8  Coding of Adverse Events 1093 
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. To facil itate coding, the site will 1094 
enter a preliminary MedDRA code which the Medical Monitor may accept or change (the 1095 
Medical Monitor’s MedDRA coding will be used for all reporting).  1096 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 61 OF 79 9.2.9  Outcome of Adverse Events 1097 
The outcome of each reportable adverse event will be classified by the investigator as follows: 1098 
oRECOVERED/RESOLVED (COMPLETE RECOVERY) – The participant recovered 1099 
from the AE/SAE without sequelae. Record the AE/SAE stop date. 1100 
oRECOVERED/RESOLVED WITH SEQUELAE – AE/SAE where the subject 1101 
recuperated but retained pathological conditions resulting from the prior disease or injury. 1102 
Record the AE/SAE stop date. 1103 
oFATAL – A fatal outcome is defined as the SAE that resulted in death. Only the event 1104 
that was the cause of death should be reported as fatal. AEs/SAEs that were ongoing at 1105 
the time of death; however, were not the cause of death, will be recorded as “resolved” at 1106 
the time of death. 1107 
oONGOING (NOT RECOVERED/NOT RESOLVED) – An ongoing AE/SAE is defined 1108 
as an ongoing event with an undetermined outcome. 1109 
An ongoing outcome will require follow-up by the site in order to determine the final 1110 
outcome of the AE/SAE. 1111 
The outcome of an ongoing event at the time of death that was not the cause of death, 1112 
will be updated and recorded as “resolved” with the date of death recorded as the stop 1113 
date. 1114 
oONGOING (MEDICALLY STABLE) – AE/SAE is ongoing, but medically stable. For 1115 
example, a chronic condition where no further change is expected. 1116 
If any reported adverse events are ongoing when a participant completes the study (or 1117 
withdraws), adverse events classified as UADEs or related SAEs will be followed until they are 1118 
either resolved, or have no prospect of improvement or change, even after the participant has 1119 
completed all applicable study visits/contacts. For all other adverse events, data collection will 1120 
end at the time the participant completes the study, unless further follow up is requested by the 1121 
Medical Monitor. Note: participants should continue to receive appropriate medical care for an 1122 
adverse event after their participation in the study ends. 1123 
If a participant is lost to follow up and participant outcome cannot be determined, outcome 1124 
classification will be the last known outcome. 1125 
9.3 Reportable Device Issues 1126 
All UADEs and ADEs as defined in section 9.2.1 will be reported on both a device issue form 1127 
and AE form, except for skin reactions from CGM sensor placement or pump infusion set 1128 
placement that do not require pharmacologic treatment.  1129 
Device complaints and device malfunctions will be reported except in the following 1130 
circumstances. These occurrences are expected and will not be reported on a Device Issue Form 1131 
assuming criteria for a UADE or ADE have not been met: 1132 
•CGM sensor needing replacement prior to labelled maximum use duration 1133 
•Infusion set needing replacement prior to labelled maximum use duration 1134 
•CGM tape adherence issues 1135 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 62 OF 79 •Battery lifespan deficiency due to inadequate charging or extensive wireless 1136 
communication 1137 
•Intermittent device component disconnections/communication failures not requiring 1138 
system replacement or workaround/resolution not specified in user guide/manual. 1139 
•Device issues clearly addressed in the user guide manual that do not require additional 1140 
troubleshooting 1141 
User error (as defined in section 9.2.1 ) will only be reported on a Device Issue form if an AE a s 1142 
defined in section 9.2.1  results from the error. In these cases, both a Device Issue form and an 1143 
Adverse Event form will be completed. 1144 
9.4 Timing of Event Reporting 1145 
SAEs possibly related to a study device or study participation and UADEs must be reported by 1146 
the investigator to the Coordinating Center within twenty-four (24) hours of the site becoming 1147 
aware of the event.  This can occur via phone or email, or by completion of the online serious 1148 
adverse event form and device issue form if applicable. If the form is not initially completed, it 1149 
should be competed as soon as possible after there is sufficient information to evaluate the event. 1150 
All other reportable ADEs and other reportable AEs should be submitted by completion on the 1151 
online form within seven (7) days of the site becoming aware of the event. 1152 
The Sponsor (or CRO) will notify all participating investigators of any adverse event that is 1153 
serious, related, and unexpected. Notification will be made within ten (10) working days after the 1154 
Sponsor becomes aware of the event. 1155 
Each principal investigator is responsible for reporting serious study-related adverse events and 1156 
abiding by any other reporting requirements of his/her local Institutional Review Board or Ethics 1157 
Committee and the Central IRB (as applicable). Sites relying on the Central IRB must report all 1158 
serious, related adverse events within seven (7) calendar days (in addition to meeting any local 1159 
IRB reporting requirements). 1160 
Upon receipt of a qualifying event, the Sponsor will investigate the event to determine if a 1161 
UADE is confirmed, and if indicated, report the results of the investigation to all overseeing 1162 
IRBs, and the FDA within ten (10) working days of the Sponsor becoming aware of the UADE 1163 
per 21CFR 812.46(b)(2).  The Sponsor in conjunction with the Medical Monitor must determine 1164 
if the UADE presents an unreasonable risk to participants.  If so, the Sponsor must ensure that all 1165 
investigations, or parts of investigations presenting that risk, are terminated as soon as possible 1166 
but no later than five (5 )working days after the Sponsor makes this determination and no later 1167 
than fifteen (15) working days after first receipt notice of the UADE. The investigator(s) may 1168 
then be required to provide approval or acknowledgment of receipt of that notification and must 1169 
submit to their local IRB as required. 1170 
The investigators are also required to report, without unjustified delay, all reportable device 1171 
deficiencies, irrespective of whether an adverse event occurred. 1172 
Device malfunctions will be handled by the Sponsor or designee as described below.  In the case 1173 
of a CGM transmitter or sensor device malfunction, information will be forwarded to Dexcom by 1174 
the site personnel, to be handled by their complaint management system. 1175 
1176 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 63 OF 79 Where an adverse event is suspected to be related only to the study provided insulin from Novo 1177 
Nordisk, and does not result from a possible interaction with the investigational medical device, 1178 
the investigator or the sponsor are encouraged to report the case to the FDA or competent 1179 
authority. Where made aware of such case, the competent authority should apply the guidance 1180 
provided in the Good Pharmacovigilance Practices Module VI with regard to the management of 1181 
this type of safety report. While reporting the suspected adverse reaction, the relevant 1182 
information regarding the CT (i.e. clinical trial number) or Study ID number must be included in 1183 
the report. 1184 
9.5 Safety Oversight 1185 
The study Medical Monitor will review all adverse events and adverse device events that are 1186 
reported during the study.  SAEs typically will be reviewed within twenty-four (24) hours of 1187 
reporting.  Other AEs typically will be reviewed on a weekly basis. 1188 
The Sponsor and Clinical Study Director will be informed of all cases of severe hypoglycemia 1189 
and DKA or HSS and the Medical Monitor’s assessment of relationship to the study device; and 1190 
informed of all reported device issues. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will 1191 
provide safety oversight. The DSMB will be informed of all cases of severe hypoglycemia, 1192 
DKA, and HHS irrespective of device relationship, all device-related SAEs, and all UADEs at 1193 
the time that they occur during the study and will review compiled safety data at periodic 1194 
intervals. The DSMB also will be informed of any ADEs not meeting criteria for a UADE if the 1195 
Medical Monitor requests the DSMB review. The DSMB can request modifications to the study 1196 
protocol or suspension or outright stoppage of the study if deemed necessary based on the 1197 
totality of safety data available. Details regarding the DSMB’s role will be documented in a 1198 
separate DSMB charter. 1199 
9.6 Stopping Criteria 1200 
9.6.1  Participa nt Discontinuation of Study Device 1201 
In the case of an unanticipated system malfunction resulting in a severe hypoglycemia or DKA 1202 
event (or a malfunction that could have led to severe hypoglycemia or DKA), use of closed-loop 1203 
mode will be suspended while the problem is diagnosed. The UADE will be reported to the IRB, 1204 
DSMB, and FDA. After assessment of the problem and any correction, use of closed-loop mode 1205 
will not be restarted until approval is received from the IRB, DSMB, and FDA. 1206 
In the absence of a device malfunction, a participant will be discontinued from the study if any of 1207 
the following occur: 1208 
•The investigator believes it is unsafe for the participant to continue on the intervention. 1209 
This could be due to the development of a new medical condition or worsening of an 1210 
existing condition; or participant behavior contrary to the indications for use of the 1211 
device that imposes on the participant’s safety . 1212 
•The participant requests that the treatment be stopped 1213 
•Participant pregnancy 1214 
•Two distinct episodes of DKA, HHS, or severe hypoglycemia as defined in sections 9.2.3 1215 
and 9.2.4 , respectively. 1216 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 64 OF 79 Each DKA or severe hypoglycemia event will be reviewed by the Medical Monitor with respect 1217 
to determination of cause and whether the occurrence of the event can be attributed to use of the 1218 
study device. 1219 
An additional requirement for continued study participation following a single DKA or severe 1220 
hypoglycemia event will be that (1) the site investigator believes that the event is explainable, 1221 
unlikely to recur, and that it is safe for the participant to continue to use the system and (2) the 1222 
Medical Monitor concurs. If the Medical Monitor determines that the occurrence of the event 1223 
indicates that it is not safe for the participant to continue to use the study system, the participant 1224 
will be discontinued from the study. 1225 
Even if the study device system is discontinued, the participant will be encouraged to remain in 1226 
the study (using CGM only) through the final study visit. 1227 
9.6.2  Criteria for Suspending or Stopping Overall Study 1228 
The DSMB will be immediately notified of all adverse events related to SH, DKA, or HHS, as 1229 
well as any recurrence of these events across participants or study sites. In addition to the 1230 
suspension of closed-loop mode use due to a UADE as described above, closed-loop system use 1231 
could be similarly suspended if the manufacturer of any constituent study device requires 1232 
stoppage of device use for safety reasons (e.g. product recall).  The affected study activities may 1233 
resume if the underlying problem can be corrected by a protocol or system modification that will 1234 
not invalidate the results obtained prior to suspension. 1235 
Additionally, the Medical Monitor or the DSMB may request suspension of study activities or 1236 
stoppage of the study if deemed necessary based on the totality of safety data available. The 1237 
Central IRB also has the authority to suspend or terminate study activities, and local IRBs have 1238 
the authority to suspend or terminate activities at the sites that they oversee. 1239 
1240 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 65 OF 79 Chapter 10:  Miscellaneous Considerations 1241 
10.1 Drugs Used as Part of the Protocol 1242 
Participants using the study pump will use only insulin approved by the FDA for use in the study 1243 
pump.  1244 
10.2 Collection of Medical Conditions and Medications 1245 
Pre-Existing Condition: Any medical condition that is either present at screening, a chronic 1246 
disease, or a prior condition that could impact the participant’s health during the course of the 1247 
study (e.g., prior myocardial infarction or stroke). 1248 
Medical Conditions during the study:  In addition to conditions meeting the reporting 1249 
requirements for an adverse event as described in section 9.2.2 , the following medical conditions 1250 
should also be reported: (1) new diagnosis of a chronic disease (i.e., not present at the time of 1251 
enrollment), and (2) any medical condition that could affect the participant’s ability to carry out 1252 
any aspect of the protocol or could affect an outcome assessment.  1253 
Medications: All medication for the treatment of chronic pre-existing conditions, medical 1254 
conditions (including medical conditions that do not require recording), and/or adverse events 1255 
that the participant is currently taking at screening and during the course of the study should be 1256 
recorded.  Nutraceuticals and preventative treatment also should be recorded.  Medications only 1257 
taken as needed either be captured with a frequency of “PRN”, or can be  recorded when used 1258 
during the study.  Glucagon for treatment of severe hypoglycemia will only be recorded if used 1259 
during the study. 1260 
10.3 Prohibited Medications, Devices, Treatments, and Procedures 1261 
Only insulins approved for the study pump can be used in the study pump. Afrezza (inhaled 1262 
insulin) or concurrent use of basal insulin will not be permitted during use of Control- IQ in the 1263 
trial. 1264 
Sulfonylurea use and meglitinide use will not be allowed during the trial. 1265 
Addition of glucose-lowering or weight-reduction medications not in use at the time of 1266 
randomization are prohibited during the 13 weeks of the RCT. 1267 
Dose increases in glucose-lowering or weight-reduction medications in use at the time of 1268 
randomization are not permitted. 1269 
Hydroxyurea use is not allowed during the trial, as it may interfere with the study CGM sensor. 1270 
Additional medications may be excluded per judgement of the investigator. 1271 
The body-worn study devices (study insulin pump, study CGM system) must be removed before 1272 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) or diathermy treatment. 1273 
Participants may continue in the trial after temporarily discontinuing use if requiring one of the 1274 
treatments above. 1275 
10.4 Precautionary Medications, Treatments, and Procedures 1276 
Not applicable. 1277 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 66 OF 79 10.5 Prophylactic Medications, Treatments, and Procedures 1278 
Not applicable. 1279 
10.6 Rescue Medications, Treatments, and Procedures 1280 
Participants in the AID group who perform exercise challenges will be expected to have a 1281 
commercially available glucagon (or glucagon analog) preparation for treatment as needed for 1282 
severe hypoglycemia.  Glucagon will be offered to these participants by the study team.  1283 
10.7 Pregnancy Reporting 1284 
If pregnancy occurs, the participant will be discontinued from the study.  The occurrence of 1285 
pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor/CRO within seven (7) calendar days and to the Central 1286 
IRB on the Unanticipated Problem form within seven (7) calendar days. 1287 
10.8 Participant Compensation 1288 
Participant compensation will be specified in the informed consent form. 1289 
10.9 Participant Withdrawal 1290 
Participation in the study is voluntary, and a participant may withdraw at any time.  For 1291 
participants who withdraw, their data will be used up until the time of withdrawal. 1292 
10.10  Confidentiality 1293 
For security and confidentiality purposes, participants will be assigned an identifier that will be 1294 
used instead of their name.  Protected health information gathered for this study will be shared 1295 
with the coordinating center, the Jaeb Center for Health Research in Tampa, FL.  De-identified 1296 
participant information may also be provided to research sites involved in the study. 1297 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 67 OF 79 Chapter 11:  Statistical Considerations 1298 
11.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 1299 
The approach to sample size and statistical analyses are summarized below.  A detailed 1300 
Statistical Analysis Plan will be written and finalized prior to the completion of the study. 1301 
The primary statistical analyses will involve comparisons of the randomized treatment groups.  1302 
Additionally, certain single-arm analyses will be conducted on the data collected for the AID 1303 
group as described in section 11.15 . 1304 
11.2 Statistical Hypotheses 1305 
The primary endpoint for this study is HbA1c at 13-weeks adjusted for baseline HbA1c. The 1306 
intervention will be considered effective if the AID group is superior to the Control group using 1307 
a statistical significance of α=0.05.  1308 
The null/alternative hypotheses for the primary endpoint are: 1309 
•Null Hypothesis : There is no difference in mean HbA1c at 13 weeks between AID and 1310 
Control 1311 
•Alternative Hypothesis : Mean HbA1c at 13 weeks is different for AID and Control. 1312 
Similarly, the null and alternative hypotheses for all of the secondary efficacy endpoints in the 1313 
hierarchy are: 1314 
•Null Hypothesis : There is no difference in the endpoint at 13 weeks between AID and 1315 
Control 1316 
•Alternative Hypothesis : Endpoint at 13 weeks is different for AID and Control. 1317 
11.3 Sample Size 1318 
The sample size of 330 randomized participants was selected to provide sufficient exposure to 1319 
the AID system for regulatory purposes.  This equates with a maximum of 220 using the AID 1320 
system for 13 weeks. Assuming 10% drop out rate in each group, there will be 200 using the 1321 
system for 13 weeks. 1322 
HbA1c data from N=30 participants in the 2IQ pilot study were used to estimate the SD for the 1323 
power calculation. The SD for baseline values was 1.0%. Assuming a similar SD at follow-up, 1324 
correlation of 0.3 with baseline, and a two-sided test with type 1 error at 5%, a sample size of 1325 
N=300 completers will be able to detect an HbA1c difference as small as 0.38% with 90% 1326 
power. There will be 85% power to detect a difference of 0.35% and 80% power for a difference 1327 
of 0.33%. 1328 
11.4 Efficacy Outcome Measures 1329 
11.4.1  Primary Efficacy Endpoint 1330 
•HbA1c at 13 weeks (superiority) 1331 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 68 OF 79 11.4.2  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints Included in Hierarchical Analysis 1332

11.4.3  Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 1345 
The following efficacy endpoints are considered exploratory as they are not included in the 1346 
overall type 1 error rate. All statistical tests are for superiority. 1347 
Binary HbA1c Endpoints: 1348 
HbA1c <7.0% at 13 weeks 1349

•Infusion set failures 1385 
•Other device malfunctions/device issues 1386 
11.5 Analysis Datasets and Sensitivity Analyses 1387 
All analyses comparing the AID arm with Control arm will follow intention- to-treatment 1388 
approach, which means participants will be analyzed in the treatment arm assigned by 1389 
randomization regardless of actual system use. All randomized participants will be included in 1390 
the primary analysis and secondary analyses of CGM metrics. 1391 
Safety outcomes will be reported for all enrolled participants, irrespective of whether the 1392 
participant was randomized, or the study was completed. 1393 
11.5.1  Per Protocol Analyses 1394 
Per-protocol analyses will be performed for primary outcome and secondary hierarchical 1395 
outcomes only if >5% of participants will be excluded. All of the following criteria must be met 1396 
for a participant to be included in the per-protocol analyses. The criteria are as follows: 1397 
•13-week visit completed 1398 
•No major protocol deviations 1399 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 70 OF 79 •Device use: AID group - closed loop mode active for at least 80% of the time over the 1400 
13-week period; control group - CGM use for at least 80% of the time over the13-week 1401 
visit period 1402 
11.5.2  Other Sensitivity Analyses 1403 
Confounding 1404 
A sensitivity analysis will also be conducted if potential confounding factors collected at 1405 
baseline are detected. 1406 
The imbalance will be assessed based on clinical judgment reviewing the distributions in the two 1407 
treatment arms, not on a p-value. The person making this judgement will be unaware of whether 1408 
there is an association between baseline variables and study outcome. All variables obtained on a 1409 
continuous scale will be entered into the models as continuous variables, unless it is determined 1410 
that a variable does not have a linear relationship with the outcome. In such a case, 1411 
categorization and/or transformation will be explored. 1412 
Missing Data 1413 
Missing data will be handled using direct likelihood method for the primary analysis. It is worth 1414 
noting that all statistical methods for handling missing data rely on untestable assumptions and 1415 
there is no one correct way to handle missing data. Our goal is to minimize the amount of 1416 
missing data so that the results will not be sensitive to which statistical method is used. 1417 
To that end, sensitivity analyses will be performed to explore whether results are similar for 1418 
primary analysis when using different methods. The following methods will be applied: 1419 
•Rubin’s multiple imputation with treatment group in the imputation model 1420 
•Available cases only 1421 
•Multiple imputation with pattern mixture model assuming the dropout trajectory of the 1422 
AID group was that of the Control group (Mallinckrodt and Clark, 2003) 1423 
•Tipping point analysis to determine the magnitude of selective dropout bias necessary to 1424 
alter conclusions of the study. 1425 
11.6 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint: HbA1c 1426 
HbA1c at 13 weeks will be compared between the AID and Control Groups using a linear mixed 1427 
effects regression model adjusting for baseline HbA1c and clinical center (random factor).  A 1428 
separate variance will be modelled for each treatment group. HbA1c is expected to be normally 1429 
distributed, but regression diagnostics will be performed to check the residuals and an 1430 
appropriate alternative transformation or robust statistical method (e.g., non-parametric or MM 1431 
estimation) will be performed if the residuals have a skewed distribution.  In the event that some 1432 
HbA1c values are not available at 13 weeks, then the linear mixed effect regression model will 1433 
use the method of direct likelihood to incorporate information from baseline measurements to 1434 
calculate the maximum likelihood at 13 weeks. Only central lab HbA1c measurements will be 1435 
used in the analyses. Imbalances between groups in important covariates are not expected to be 1436 
of sufficient magnitude to produce confounding. However, the presence of confounding will be 1437 
evaluated in the sensitivity analyses by including factors potentially associated with the outcome 1438 
for which there is an imbalance between groups ( 11.5.2 ). 1439 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 71 OF 79 11.7 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 1440 
11.7.1  CGM Metrics 1441 
Baseline values for each CGM metric will be computed from 14 days of CGM data prior to 1442 
randomization. A minimum of 72 hours of CGM data will be required to calculate baseline 1443 
metrics. 1444 
CGM data starting from randomization visit through the 13-week visit will be included in the 1445 
calculation of each CGM metric for each participant, giving equal weight to each CGM point. 1446 
Calculation of CGM metrics for the treatment group comparisons will exclude the challenges 1447 
and the period through 6 AM on the day following the end of the challenge. CGM metrics during 1448 
and following the challenges will be reported separately as described in section 11.15.3  and an 1449 
overall analysis within the AID group will be performed for all CGM data including the 1450 
challenge data as described in section 11.15.2 . 1451 
CGM-measured prolonged hyperglycemia events are defined as ≥90 cumulative minutes with 1452 
CGM glucose >300 mg/dL within a 120-minute period (the participant becomes eligible for 1453 
another prolonged hyperglycemia event after the CGM glucose is <180 mg/dL for ≥15 1454 
consecutive minutes). CGM-measured hypoglycemia events are defined as ≥15 consecutive 1455 
minutes with CGM glucose <54 mg/dL (the participant becomes eligible for another 1456 
hypoglycemia event after the CGM glucose is ≥70 mg/dL for ≥15 consecutive minutes).  For 1457 
each of these metrics, the number of events per week is calculated for each participant and each 1458 
metric is then analyzed as a continuous variable as described below. 1459 
Summary statistics (mean ± SD or median (quartiles)) will be reported for the CGM-measured 1460 
metrics at baseline and during follow up as well as for differences from baseline by treatment 1461 
group. CGM metric differences between AID and Control Groups will be compared using a 1462 
linear mixed effects regression model adjusting for the baseline value of the metric and clinical 1463 
center (random effect).  A separate variance will be modelled for each group. Residual values 1464 
will be examined for an approximate normal distribution.  If residuals are highly skewed, then a 1465 
transformation or robust statistical method (e.g., non-parametric or MM estimation) will be used 1466 
instead. Missing data will be handled using direct likelihood. 1467 
11.7.2  Binary Outcomes 1468 
For the binary HbA1c outcomes, risk-adjusted percentages by treatment group will be computed 1469 
at 13 weeks from a logistic regression model. The logistic regression will adjust for baseline 1470 
HbA1c (as a continuous factor) and clinical site using generalized estimating equations (GEE). 1471 
Similar analyses will be done for the binary CGM outcomes. 1472 
11.8 Questionnaires and Other Outcomes Analyses 1473 
For questionnaires administered to both randomization groups, comparisons will be made using 1474 
similar linear models as described above for the primary and key secondary outcomes. If 1475 
questionnaires include a total score, separate models will be run for the total score and selected 1476 
subscales. 1477 
Similarly, for insulin, weight and BMI metrics comparisons will be made using similar linear 1478 
models as described above for the primary HbA1c analysis. 1479 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 72 OF 79 11.9 Safety Analyses 1480 
All randomized participants will be included in the safety analyses and all of their post- 1481 
randomization safety events will be reported.  Separately, any adverse events occurring between 1482 
screening and randomization will be reported. 1483 
All reportable adverse events will be tabulated by treatment group.  Details will be provided in a 1484 
listing of each event, including Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) term 1485 
and MedDRA System Organ Class.  Safety analyses for the RCT will include events occurring 1486 
on or after randomization until and including the 13-week visit or Day 98 from randomization, 1487 
whichever occurs first. 1488 
Formal statistical testing only will be performed for selected safety endpoints. For the following 1489 
outcomes, mean ± SD or summary statistics appropriate to the distribution will be tabulated by 1490 
treatment group and formal statistical comparisons will be performed if there are enough events 1491 
(at least 5 events combined between the two treatment groups ): 1492 
•Number of SH events and SH event rate per 100 person-years 1493 
•Number of DKA events and DKA event rate per 100 person-years 1494 
•Number of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome events and rate per 100 person-years 1495 
•Other serious adverse events 1496 
If enough events occur for the severe hypoglycemia and DKA outcomes and other serious 1497 
adverse events, the numbers of events will be compared between the two treatment groups 1498 
during the RCT using a robust Poisson regression as detailed in the SAP.  1499 
11.9.1  Safety Tabulations Specific to the AID Group 1500 
For the AID Group, all of the following will be tabulated: 1501 
•Adverse device effects (ADE) 1502 
•Serious adverse device events (SADE) 1503 
•Unanticipated adverse device effects (UADE) 1504 
11.10  Additional Tabulations and Analyses 1505 
The following tabulations will be performed according to treatment group: 1506 
•Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics 1507 
•A flow chart accounting for all participants for all visits 1508 
•Visit completion rates for each follow-up visit 1509 
•Protocol deviations 1510 
•Modifications in non-insulin diabetes drugs during the study 1511 
•Number and reasons for unscheduled visits and phone calls 1512 
•Amount of CGM data during the 13 weeks of the study 1513 
11.11  Planned Interim Analyses 1514 
No formal interim efficacy analyses are planned. The DSMB will review safety data at intervals, 1515 
with no formal stopping rules other than the guidelines provided in the participant-level and 1516 
study-level stopping criteria (as defined in Section 9.6.2 ). 1517 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 73 OF 79 11.12  Subgroup Analyses 1518 
In exploratory analyses, the primary outcome (HbA1c) and time in range 70-180 mg/dL will be 1519 
compared in baseline subgroups. Treatment group by subgroup factor interaction terms will be 1520 
added to the linear models described above. 1521 
Formal tests will be done only if the overall result is statistically significant . Results will be 1522 
tabulated by subgroups regardless of statistical significance.  For continuous variables, results 1523 
will be displayed in subgroups based on cutpoints although the analysis will utilize the variable 1524 
as continuous. If there is insufficient sample size in a given subgroup, the cutpoints for 1525 
continuous measures may be adjusted per the observed distribution of values. Cutpoint selection 1526 
for display purposes will be made masked to the outcome data. 1527 
Subgroups will be analyzed according to the following baseline factors: 1528 
•Baseline HbA1c 1529 
•Baseline time in range 70-180 mg/dL 1530 
•Diabetic medication use 1531 
•Body mass index 1532 
•Total daily insulin (<100 units versus ≥100 units) 1533 
•Sex 1534 
•Age (>50 years old versus ≤50 years old —assuming sufficient numbers in each category) 1535 
•Race/Ethnicity 1536 
•Scores on the Subjective Numeracy Survey 1537 
•C-peptide level 1538 
•Additional subgroups to be defined in the SAP 1539 
1540 
11.13  Multiple Comparison/Multiplicity 1541 
Hierarchical Analyses 1542 
To preserve the overall type 1 error for the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints as 1543 
listed in section 11.4.2 , a hierarchical testing procedure will be used.  If the primary analysis for 1544 
HbA1c results in a statistically significant result (p < 0.05), then testing at the 0.05 level will 1545 
proceed to the next outcome metric.  This process continues iteratively moving to the next 1546 
variable down on the list until a non-significant result is observed, or all 10 variables have been 1547 
tested.  If a non-significant result is encountered, then formal statistical hypothesis testing is 1548 
terminated and any variables lower on the list will not be formally tested. 1549 
Regardless of the results of the hierarchical testing, summary statistics appropriate to the 1550 
distribution will be tabulated by treatment group for each hierarchical outcome.  A 95% 1551 
confidence interval for the treatment group difference also will be calculated for all hierarchical 1552 
outcomes listed above.  However, a confidence interval that excludes zero will not be considered 1553 
a statistically significant result if an outcome variable higher on the hierarchical list failed to 1554 
reach statistical significance. 1555 
All Other Secondary Analyses 1556 
For the other secondary analyses, the false discovery rate will be controlled using the adaptive 1557 
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. 1558 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 74 OF 79 P-values from safety analyses, sensitivity analyses, and per-protocol analyses will not be adjusted 1559 
for multiple comparisons. 1560 
11.14  Exploratory Treatment Grou p Comparisons 1561 
The following additional treatment group comparisons will be performed: 1562 
•Separate CGM analyses for daytime and nighttime 1563 
•Separate sub-analyses for participants negative for GAD antibodies (if GAD antibodies 1564 
are present in ≥5% of participants) Efficacy and safety outcomes in participants using an 1565 
SGLT2 inhibitor 1566 
•Efficacy and safety outcomes in participants using a GLP-1 receptor agonist 1567 
•Efficacy and safety outcomes in participants with TDI ≥100 units , ≥ 150 units, ≥ 200 1568 
units. These may include subgroup analyses. 1569 
11.15  Additional Analyses and Tabulations for the Single-Arm AID Group 1570 
11.15.1  Tabulations Specific to the AID Group 1571 
The following tabulations will be made for the AID group 1572 
•Number of participants who stopped AID use and reasons 1573 
•% time in closed loop 1574 
•Occlusion events that occur while using the AID system 1575 
•Reportable device malfunctions and other reported device issues 1576 
•Frequency of use of sleep mode and exploratory outcomes for times with versus without 1577 
sleep mode 1578 
•Frequency of use of exercise mode 1579 
11.15.2  Analyses of Complete CGM Data Set 1580 
CGM metrics will computed over the entire 13 weeks of the trial (including the challenge 1581 
periods) and compared with the baseline CGM metrics using paired t-tests or nonparametric 1582 
approaches depending on the distribution of the data. Binary outcomes will be assessed using 1583 
McNemar’s test.  1584 
11.15.3  Analysis of Data from Meal and Exercise Challenges 1585 
The number of each challenge per participant will be tabulated.  Any adverse events occurring 1586 
during these challenges will be reported by type of challenge in addition to their being included in 1587 
the overall safety analyses. Selected CGM metrics for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia will be 1588 
computed for each challenge and reported as summary statistics for the time period during and 1589 
until 6 AM on the day following each challenge. 1590 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 75 OF 79 Chapter 12:  Data Collection and Monitoring 1591 
12.1 Case Report Forms and Other Data Collection 1592 
The main study data are collected on electronic case report forms (CRFs). When data are directly 1593 
collected in electronic case report forms, this will be considered the source data. For any data 1594 
points for which the eCRF is not considered source (e.g. lab results that are transcribed from a 1595 
printed report into the eCRF), the original source documentation must be maintained in the 1596 
participant’s  study chart or medical record. This source must be readily verifiable against the 1597 
values entered into eCRF. Even where all study data are directly entered into the eCRFs at office 1598 
visits, evidence of interaction with a live subject must be recorded (e.g., office note, visit record, 1599 
etc.) 1600 
Electronic device data files are obtained from the study software and individual hardware 1601 
components.  These electronic device files are considered the primary source documentation. 1602 
12.2 Study Records Retention 1603 
Each participating site will maintain appropriate medical and research records for this trial, in 1604 
compliance with ICH E6 and regulatory and institutional requirements for the protection of 1605 
confidentiality of participants. 1606 
Study documents should be retained for a minimum of 2 years after the last approval of a 1607 
marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 1608 
applications in an ICH region or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal 1609 
discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product.  These documents should 1610 
be retained for a longer period, however, if required by local regulations.  No records will be 1611 
destroyed without the written consent of the sponsor, if applicable.  It is the responsibility of the 1612 
sponsor to inform the investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained. 1613 
12.3 Quality Assurance and Monitoring 1614 
Designated personnel from the Coordinating Center will be responsible for maintaining quality 1615 
assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) systems to ensure that the clinical portion of the trial is 1616 
conducted and data are generated, documented and reported in compliance with the protocol, 1617 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the applicable regulatory requirements, as well as to ensure 1618 
that the rights and wellbeing of trial participants are protected and that the reported trial data are 1619 
accurate, complete, and verifiable.  Adverse events will be prioritized for monitoring. 1620 
A risk-based monitoring (RBM) plan will be developed and revised as needed during the course 1621 
of the study, consistent with the FDA “Guidance for Industry Oversight of Clinical 1622 
Investigations — A Risk- Based Approach to Monitoring” (August 2013).  Study conduct and 1623 
monitoring will conform with 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 812. This plan describes in 1624 
detail who will conduct the monitoring, at what frequency monitoring will be done, at what level 1625 
of detail monitoring will be performed, and the distribution of monitoring reports. 1626 
The data of most importance for monitoring at the site are participant eligibility and adverse 1627 
events.  Therefore, the RBM plan will focus on these areas.  As much as possible, remote 1628 
monitoring will be performed in real-time with on-site monitoring performed to evaluate the 1629 
verity and completeness of the key site data.  Elements of the RBM may include: 1630 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 76 OF 79 •Qualification assessment, training, and certification for sites and site personnel 1631 
•Oversight of Institutional Review Board (IRB) coverage and informed consent 1632 
procedures 1633 
•Central (remote) data monitoring: validation of data entry, data edits/audit trail, protocol 1634 
review of entered data and edits, statistical monitoring, study closeout 1635 
•On-site monitoring (site visits): source data verification, site visit report 1636 
•Agent/Device accountability 1637 
•Communications with site staff 1638 
•Patient retention and visit completion 1639 
•Quality control reports 1640 
•Management of noncompliance 1641 
•Documenting monitoring activities 1642 
•Adverse event reporting and monitoring 1643 
Coordinating Center representatives or their designees may visit the study facilities at any time in 1644 
order to maintain current and personal knowledge of the study through review of the records, 1645 
comparison with source documents, observation and discussion of the conduct and progress of 1646 
the study. The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source 1647 
data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by the sponsor, and 1648 
inspection by local and regulatory authorities. 1649 
12.4 Protocol Deviations 1650 
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with federal regulation, the clinical trial protocol, 1651 
GCP, IRB requirements, or procedure requirements.  The noncompliance may be either on the 1652 
part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site staff.  A significant (or major) deviation 1653 
is any deviation that departs from the established materials in such a way that it poses an increase 1654 
in the risk to subjects, adversely affects the welfare, rights, or safety of the research subjects, or 1655 
negatively influences the scientific study integrity. As a result of a significant deviation, a 1656 
corrective and preventive action plan shall be developed by the site and implemented promptly. 1657 
The site PI/study staff is responsible for knowing and adhering to all applicable IRB 1658 
requirements.  Further details about the handling of protocol deviations will be included in the 1659 
monitoring plan. 1660 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 77 OF 79 Chapter 13:  Ethics/Protection of Human Participants 1661 
13.1 Ethical Standard 1662 
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with Regulations for 1663 
the Protection of Human Participants of Research codified in 45 CFR Part 46, 21 CFR Part 50, 1664 
21 CFR Part 56, and/or the ICH E6. 1665 
13.2 Institutional Review Boards 1666 
The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all participant materials will 1667 
be submitted to the IRB for review and approval.  Approval of both the protocol and the consent 1668 
form must be obtained before any participant is enrolled.  Any amendment to the protocol will 1669 
require review and approval by the IRB before the changes are implemented to the study.  All 1670 
changes to the consent form will be IRB approved; a determination will be made regarding 1671 
whether previously consented participants need to be re-consented. 1672 
13.3 Informed Consent Process 1673 
13.3.1  Consent Procedures and Documentation 1674 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in 1675 
the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation.  The consent process may 1676 
be done electronically and virtually, if approved by the IRB.  Extensive discussion of risks and 1677 
possible benefits of participation will be provided to the participants.  Consent forms will be 1678 
IRB-approved and the participant will be asked to read and review the document.  The 1679 
investigator will explain the research study to the participant and answer any questions that may 1680 
arise.  All participants will receive a verbal explanation in terms suited to their comprehension of 1681 
the purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research 1682 
participants.  Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the consent form and ask 1683 
questions prior to signing. 1684 
The participants should have the opportunity to discuss the study with their surrogates or think 1685 
about it prior to agreeing to participate.  The participant will sign the informed consent document 1686 
prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study.  1687 
The participants may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the trial.  A copy of 1688 
the informed consent document will be given to the participants for their records.  The rights and 1689 
welfare of the participants will be protected by emphasizing to them that the quality of their 1690 
medical care will not be adversely affected if they decline to participate in this study. 1691 
This process shall be document in the study records at each site (e.g., consent process note). 1692 
13.3.2  Participant and Data Confidentiality 1693 
Participant confidentiality is strictly held in trust by the participating investigators, their staff, 1694 
and the sponsor(s) and their agents.  This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of 1695 
biological samples and genetic tests in addition to the clinical information relating to 1696 
participants.  Therefore, the study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information 1697 
generated will be held in strict confidence.  No information concerning the study or the data will 1698 
be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor. 1699 
TANDEM 2IQP PROTOCOL V 8.0 2023 -10-31.DOCX  PAGE 78 OF 79 The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the sponsor, representatives of the IRB, 1700 
regulatory agencies or company supplying study product may inspect all documents and records 1701 
required to be maintained by the investigator, including but not limited to, medical records 1702 
(office, clinic, or hospital) and pharmacy records for the participants in this study.  The clinical 1703 
study site will permit access to such records. 1704 
The study participant’s contact information will be securely stored at each clinical site for 1705 
internal use during the study.  At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a 1706 
secure location for as long a period as dictated by the reviewing IRB, institutional policies, or 1707 
sponsor requirements. 1708 
Study participant research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific 1709 
reporting, will be transmitted to and stored at the Jaeb Center for Health Research (JCHR).  This 1710 
will not include the participant’s contact or identifying information , unless otherwise specified in 1711 
the informed consent form.  Rather, individual participants and their research data will be 1712 
identified by a unique study identification number.  The study data entry and study management 1713 
systems used by clinical sites and by JCHR research staff will be secured and password 1714 
protected.  At the end of the study, all study databases will be archived at the JCHR. 1715

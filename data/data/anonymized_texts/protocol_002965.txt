PROTOCOL TITLE:  Nasally Inhaled Isopropyl Alcohol Versus Oral Ondansetron for the Treatment of Nausea in the 11 Emergency Department: A Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial 12  13 2.  ABSTRACT.  Nasally inhaled Isopropyl alcohol (ISO) has outperformed placebo in treating nausea among Emergency 14 Department (ED) patients.1  Inhalation of ISO pads is without known adverse effects,2-4 relatively inexpensive and readily 15 available compared with antiemetic drugs, making ISO a potentially safer, cost effective and faster antiemetic intervention.  16 This agent has yet to be compared to conventional, commonly-used anti-emetics in randomized controlled trials.  This study 17 will study the efficacy of ISO and conventional anti-emetics with three study arms: (1) inhaled isopropyl alcohol plus oral 18 ondansetron; (2) inhaled isopropyl alcohol plus oral placebo; (3) inhaled placebo plus oral ondansetron.    19  20 3.  OBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS/RESEARCH QUESTIONS. The purpose of the study is to determine whether nasally 21 inhaled isopropyl alcohol provides better nausea relief compared to ondansetron oral solution in patients presenting to the 22 ED with nausea. 23  24 4.  MILITARY RELEVANCE.   Nausea is a common complaint seen not only in the ED but also in multiple deployed 25 medical settings.  Establishing the use of inhaled ISO for nausea and/or vomiting as an evidence-based intervention 26 outperforming antiemetic drugs may relieve the nausea and/or vomiting symptoms to a significant degree and in a shorter 27 amount of time.  ISO preps are readily available in every military/deployed medical setting.  If nausea in ED patients can 28 be controlled with inhaled ISO, then its use can possibly be extended in other settings, specifically pre-hospital or combat 29 use.   Inhaled ISO is less expensive and has been proven safer than antiemetic drugs.4  30   31 5. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE.  A recent Cochrane review of aromatherapy for the treatment of nausea 32 investigated 1386 articles; 44 articles were deemed relevant.4Nine of these specifically studied ISO inhalation in post-33 operative patients.  Summation of this literature is challenging given heterogeneous outcome measures.  Several non-34 blinded studies examined time to 50% reduction in nausea as measured on a verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS), 0-11, 35 finding isopropyl alcohol achieved this more rapidly than conventional anti-emetics such as promethazine and 36 ondansetron (times ranging 6.5-15.0 minutes).5-7  A fourth study was single-blinded and reported absolute VNRS (0-11) 37 for isopropyl alcohol versus usual anti-emetics (not otherwise specified).  This study found scores decreased from a mean 38 of 5.7 pre-inhalation to 2.7 post-inhalation though this was not significantly better than the usual care arm.8  A fifth study 39 compared inhaled isopropyl alcohol plus ondansetron versus ondansetron alone concluding no significant differences in 40 nausea as measured on a 0-11 VNRS.9  An additional three studies compared inhaled isopropyl alcohol to inhaled 41 placebo, all of which concluding that isopropyl alcohol resulted in superior nausea relief.10-12 Finally, a randomized trial 42 with three arms including inhaled peppermint, inhaled isopropyl alcohol, and inhaled placebo found no difference in 43 nausea scores as measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS).13  In total, the Cochrane review article broadly concluded 44 efficacy for isopropyl alcohol in treating post-operative nausea and vomiting.  These studies were limited in that none were 45 performed in an outpatient or pre-hospital setting.  More recently, a randomized controlled trial at San Antonio Military 46 Medical Center (SAMMC) demonstrated efficacy at 10 minutes among ED patients with nausea or vomiting.1  Of note, 47 although traditional anti-emetics (e.g., ondansetron, promethazine, metoclopramide) have demonstrated efficacy in 48 specific patient populations such as cancer patients receiving chemotherapy,14 multiple studies have found these agents 49 are no better than placebo in treating nausea among undifferentiated ED patients.15-17  Despite the absence of efficacy 50 data, these agents are frequently used in the treatment of nausea among ED patients.  Our objective is to compare the 51 efficacy of inhaled isopropyl alcohol to ondansetron in treating nausea among undifferentiated patients. 52  53 6.  RESEARCH DESIGN  This study is a prospective randomized controlled trial.  We will test the hypothesis that nasally-54 inhaled ISO plus oral placebo has greater anti-emetic efficacy compared to nasally-inhaled saline plus oral ondansetron 55 oral solution.  By design, the study will be double-blinded insofar as neither investigators nor subjects will be notified of the 56 identity of the substances they are inhaling or swallowing.  We anticipate blinding to scent may be challenging and the 57 Regional Health Command-Central (RHC-C) Institutional Review Board Brooke Army Medical Center  HUMAN SUBJECTS RESEARCH   PROTOCOL APPLICATION – Part B

Potential subjects are 58 those presenting to the SAMMC ED with symptoms of nausea and/or vomiting.  For the purposes of this study, nausea is 59 defined as the subjective sensation associated with the urge to vomit, and vomiting is defined as the forceful expulsion of 60 gastric contents. Investigators will approach subjects at the time of initial triage and/or while in the waiting room.  This will 61 mitigate interruptions in the subject’s treatment, possible withdrawals from the control group, and lack of subject interest in 62 the study.  Part of the screening process will entail solicitation of nausea on a VNRS scored from 0-10 with those patients 63 reporting scores of 3 or greater eligible for study.  Informed consent will be obtained from each subject.  Upon enrollment, 64 a study team member will record the patient’s date of visit, FMP + sponsor social security number, and date of birth 65 (month, day, year) on the study key which will be maintained in a locked cabinet in the principal investigator’s office. 66  67 Regarding blinding, subjects will be informed they will be nasally inhaling one of two common medical preparation pads 68 saturated with different ingredients and taking orally one of two common oral solution substances.  Subjects will be 69 allocated to one of three arms: (1) inhaled isopropyl alcohol plus oral ondansetron; (2) inhaled isopropyl alcohol plus oral 70 placebo; (3) inhaled placebo plus oral ondansetron.  No subject will receive both inhaled and oral placebo; all subjects will 71 be allocated to at least one therapeutic intervention for nausea  Both investigators and study subjects will be blinded to 72 subject allocation.  Randomization will be performed prior to study start with a computer-generated assignment (simple 73 randomization sequence) by an individual not otherwise involved in the study.  A copy of the randomization key will be in a 74 sealed envelope and placed in the study file box along with study packets as to be readily available in the ED in case un-75 blinding must occur.  Another copy of the randomization key will be submitted to pharmacy personnel (Ms. Irene Lo).  76 Based on the randomization sequence, the pharmacy will store doses of either ondansetron or placebo oral solution oral 77 solution in the ED pharmacy.  The oral solution and the placebo packets will appear identical in order to blind the 78 medication – only pharmacy personnel with the randomization key will know which packet contains which oral solution.  79 Also based on the randomization sequence, one pre-assembled study packet will be maintained in the Department of 80 Emergency Medicine (DEM) administration area for each study ID number.  Each packet will contain consent forms, data 81 collection forms, order for the study drugs and ten identical (either ISO or saline) de-identified preparation pads for nasal 82 inhalation.  The preparation pads are commercially prepared single-use pads of ISO for the ISO + oral placebo and ISO + 83 oral ondansetron study groups and commercially prepared single-use saline pads for the inhaled saline + ondansetron 84 oral solution group that are identical with the exception of the labeling. Both pads will remain in their original packaging.  85 The individual pads have been de-identified, with exception of expiration dates, utilizing brown tape over original 86 packaging that tears open with packing so as to not reveal manufacturer’s labeling.    87  88 Regarding the interventions, upon recruitment and packet receipt, a study team member will enter an order in CHCS for 89 the study medication (listed under C.2016.091 and listed as an investigational drug to prevent accidental ordering for non-90 study patients).  The study investigator will then go to the ED pharmacy and retrieve the study oral solution (either 91 ondansetron or placebo) from pharmacy personnel by submitting the subject’s study identification number and receiving 92 the study oral solution according to subject study assigned number.  Study team members enrolling patients and treating 93 providers will all remain blinded to the oral solution contents.  The study team member will then administer the medication 94 to the patient.  A study team member will then instruct the subject to inhale one of the blinded prep pads, to hold the pad 95 approximately 1 centimeter from their nares, and to take deep nasal inhalations as needed for nausea relief.  Subjects will 96 be encouraged to take inhalations as frequently and deeply as they feel is necessary to achieve nausea relief.  If a subject 97 is unable to or prefers assistance with nasal inhalation or oral solution consumption, the patient’s nurse will provide any 98 assistance needed.  The investigator will remain at arm’s length from the patient at all times to avoid detecting prep pad 99 scent.  Additionally, investigators will also instruct subjects to avoid any behavior or actions during the study that would 100 indicate which preparation pad is being used.  Examples of behavior to avoid would be verbally describing the scent of the 101 preparation pad or taste of the oral solution.    102  103 The investigators will record their findings on data collection forms.   The primary outcome will be nausea as measured on 104 a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) at 30 minutes.  This time horizon was selected as ondansetron’s labeled use is 105 administration 30 minutes prior to receipt of chemotherapy to treat chemotherapy-related nausea.  Nausea measurements 106 will also be collected at 10, 20, 40, 50, and 60 minutes, and then every hour up to 5 hours, then at disposition at which 107 time the patient will provide one final nausea VAS score.  The study team member will not be present in the patient’s room 108 during the intervals between these evaluations.  At the time of each nausea measurement, patients will be offered another 109 preparation pad (up to ten pads).  We will notify the patient’s treating provider to prompt consideration for treatment with a 110 rescue anti-emetic (such as metoclopramide or promethazine) if the patient vomits or if the patient requests an anti-emetic 111 at any time.  At the time of each nausea measurement, a pain score will also be measured on a 10 cm VAS.  At the time 112 of final disposition, the patient will provide a satisfaction score on a 10-cm VAS and be asked to indicate his/her belief as 113 to whether the pad was a treatment or placebo and whether the oral solution was a treatment or placebo.  Similarly, at 114

 Form P2 - Version 2.2, 5 March 2013  Page 3 of 11  study conclusion the patient’s provider will be asked to indicate his/her belief as to whether the pad was a treatment or 115 placebo and whether the oral solution was a treatment or placebo.  Other data collected will include times and doses for 116 all medications (including preparation pads) and fluids administered, episodes of vomiting (defined as forceful expulsion of 117 gastric contents separated by at least 2 minutes), disposition (admission versus discharge), final clinical impression at the 118 time of disposition, and time to disposition.  Subjects will be followed and data collected for the entirety of their ED stay.  A 119 lockbox identified as “Nausea study” will be maintained in the ED for data collection form storage to which only the 120 investigators and ED staff will have the key.  ISO prep pads, saline prep pads, Ondansetron oral solution, and its 121 matching placebo do not require storage in a hazardous material cabinet.  This study will be registered on 122 ClinicalTrials.gov. 123  124 Subjects will comprise a convenience sample.  Study investigators will log hours of recruitment on a password-protected 125 excel spreadsheet which will not contain any PHI. To confirm the sample is representative of all patients presenting to the 126 ED with nausea, we will examine CHCS ad hoc data already generated by the ED on a routine basis for performance 127 improvement purposes for all patients whose registration chief complaint contains either the words “nausea” or “vomiting” 128 Including patients not enrolled in our study.  Comparison of the characteristics of enrolled patients with patients not 129 enrolled will enable us to establish whether there was selection bias in our study.  These patients’ FMP prefix and sponsor 130 last 4 will be cross-referenced against our enrolled subjects.  With our enrolled subjects removed, we will extract only the 131 following data: age, sex, ESI category, diagnoses, receipt of any anti-emetics to include drugs and doses, and whether or 132 not admitted.  Any patient on the Ad Hoc list who is 89 or older will be recorded as ≥89.  We will also need to access 133 cross-reference the SSN or MRN of all these patients along with the dates of treatment data to establish whether a given 134 CHCS data point represents a visit from a patients recruited into the study or a non-recruited patient.  No PHI will be 135 extracted from the ad hoc data.  These extracted data will be maintained on a password-protected, CAC-enabled 136 government laptop. 137  138 The prospective chart review (CHCS ad hoc data query) portion of the study will be conducted under a waiver of informed 139 consent. This portion of the research involved no more than minimal risk to subjects as medical records are reviewed for 140 limited information that is not of a sensitive nature. Adequate precautions are in place to protect the confidentiality of the 141 information. Waiving consent will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects as the study reviews medical 142 records for care already provided and cannot impact or change the care received. The research could not be practically 143 carried out without the waiver as contacting hundreds of subjects is not feasible for review of medical records for 144 information that would not change the care that the subjects have already received. A HIPAA Waiver of Authorization is 145 also submitted to access patients’ medical records for the prospective chart review portion of the study. 146   147 This study will pose no more than minimal risk to participants.  Our use of isopropyl alcohol and ondansetron will not 148 significantly increase the risks associated with the use of these medications in our study.  These medications should 149 quality for IND exemption (see section 7.2.1).  All data for research purposes will be collected by non-invasive means. 150  151 7.

Subject Population.   156 Patients ages 18 and older presenting to the Emergency department with a complaint of nausea and/or vomiting.  All 157 presumed causes of nausea will be included.  Inclusion/exclusion criterion is based on safety considerations that were 158 discussed with SAMMC clinical pharmacist.  Other considerations are circumstances that altered smell or perception, 159 exogenous emetics, concomitant antiemetic therapy and alcohol exposure.   No specimens will be obtained. 160  161 7.1.2.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria.  165 Inclusion Criteria: 166 (a) ages 18 and older  167 (b) complaint of nausea and/or vomiting reported at 3 or above on VRNS at the time of ED triage 168  169 Exclusion Criteria: 170 (a) allergy to isopropyl alcohol or ondansetron 171 (b) inability to breathe through nose (e.g., recent upper respiratory infection)  172 (c) intake of cefoperazone, disulfiram, or metronidazole within the last 24 hours 173 (d) mental status precluding informed consent including intoxication 174 (e) known QT-prolongation 175 (f) clinical suspicion for serotonin syndrome 176 (g) intravenous catheter in place prior to study start 177 (h) medications administered since patient arrival to ED (e.g., in triage) 178 (i) suspected or known pregnancy 179  180 7.1.4. Description of the Recruitment and Prescreening Process.  ED providers and RN triage nursing staff (none of 181 whom will be study team members) will be apprised of the study inclusion criteria to notify study team members of potential 182 subjects.  Potential subjects will be asked to quantify their nausea on a VNRS (0-10) for the purposes of discerning study 183 eligibility by triage nurses, the RNs assigned to the patient, or the patient’s provider.  Efforts will be made to perform this 184 prescreening process early in the patient’s ED course (ideally at the time of triage or initial arrival to treatment room).  No 185 other history, physical exam or other evaluations beyond those normally conducted as the standard of care shall be performed 186 for the purposes of screening.  Triage nurses, the RNs assigned to the patient, the provider assigned will, through their 187 standard of care assessments and VNRS ascertainment, be able to identify potential subjects (those who meet inclusion 188 criteria).  Triage nurses will notify research staff of potential patients for study enrollment. 189  190 7.1.5. Consent Process. Either the PI or one of the AIs will conduct the informed consent process, which will be 191 accomplished in the ED while the patient is not receiving active-intervention.  The process will take place with the curtain 192 drawn or door closed to provide the subject appropriate privacy.  The subject will have ample opportunity to ask questions of 193 the investigators and to look over the consent form and HIPAA authorization.  The subject will be offered the option of having 194 a family member present and to be allowed the option of deferring a decision until later into their ED stay.  Subjects unable to 195 provide informed consent for themselves due to diminished decision-making capacity are excluded per paragraph 7.1.3.  The 196 informed consent will notify patients that they will be receiving one of two oral solutions and one of two preparation pads being 197 studied for the treatment of nausea.  They will not be informed of the identity of the substances or that one of the substances 198 is inert (placebo) given that it is impossible to blind to smell hence we believe that effective blinding to the preparation pad 199 contents would be impossible without withholding this information.  Given the safety profile of these medications, we believe 200 this research will pose no greater than minimal risk to the participants. 201  202  203 7.1.6. Subject Screening Procedures.  Subjects will be recruited exclusively by the study investigators.  Investigators will 204 approach eligible subjects as identified by either the triage nurse, treating nurses, or treating providers.  The recruiting 205 investigator will inquire as to whether the patient is amenable to possible participation in a study of nausea treatments.  If the 206 patient agrees, the investigator will then verify the potential subject meets inclusion criteria without exclusion through subject 207 self-report.  Agreeable patients will undergo a complete, informed consent process.  Data regarding potential subject’s age, 208 sex, and nausea VNRS will be recorded for all patients declining to participate in the study.  No personal health information 209 will be collected on these patients. 210  211  212

We have no intentions of utilizing the results of this study to seek a new indication for the use of isopropyl 229 alcohol or to otherwise support any significant changes in the labeling of this product.  Similarly, we have no intentions of 230 using the results of this study to support a significant change in the advertising of this product.  Our route of administration 231 of this product will not significantly increase the risks associated with its use.   232  233 We will also be requesting an investigational drug exemption for the Ondansetron IAW 32 CFR 312.2 for the following 234 reasons.  We have no intentions of using the results of this study to seek a new indication for use of ondansetron or to 235 otherwise support any significant changes in its labeling.  Similarly, we have no intentions of using the results of this study 236 to support a significant change in the advertising of this medication.  Our routes of administration of this medication will 237 not significantly increase the risks associated with its use.  238 Both the saline and isopropyl alcohol pads are lawfully marketed over the counter products and meet the conditions of 239 being generally safe and effective by the U.S. FDA due to their active ingredients and labeling.  We consider the use of 240 the ISO (administered via the pad) as a drug in this research which meets the IND exemption criteria as outlined above. 241  242 Specifically regarding ondansetron, we will be using the conventional dose (4 mg) and route of administration for 243 ondansetron.  While the patient population in this study (all patients with undifferentiated nausea and vomiting) differs 244 from that for which this medication is approved (chemotherapy patients), this agent has been extensively studied at this 245 dose in ED patient population without safety concerns.15-17  Moreover, this medication is routinely used at this dose in our 246 Emergency Department for the purpose of treating nausea and is incorporated into our triage protocols.  Finally, this 247 investigation will be conducted in compliance with the requirements for IRB review and obtaining informed consent. 248  249 7.2.2  Devices. Not applicable. 250  251 7.3. Study Procedures/Research Interventions.  Upon presenting to ED, meeting inclusion criteria and obtaining 252 consent, the subject’s nausea and pain levels will be recorded initially.  For the oral solution, they will be instructed to 253 swallow the oral solution.  Receipt of oral solution (ondansetron or placebo) should occur prior to pad inhalation to be 254 followed within 5 minutes by initiation of inhalations from the allocated study pad (normal saline or ISO).  For the 255 preparation pads, patients will be instructed to hold the pad approximately 1 inch from their nares and take deep nasal 256 inhalations as needed for nausea relief.  Initiation of inhalations will mark time 0 for the study.  If a subject is unable to or 257 prefers assistance with either nasal inhalation or oral solution consumption, the patient’s nurse will provide any assistance 258 needed.  The investigator will remain at arm’s length from the patient at all times to avoid detecting prep pad scent.  259 Additionally, investigators will also instruct subjects to avoid any behavior or actions during the study that would indicate 260 which intervention is being used.  Examples of behavior to avoid would be verbally describing the scent of the preparation 261 pad or taste of the oral solution.   Investigators will not inform subjects which substances are being tested.  The 262 preparation pads are commercially prepared single-use pads of ISO for the ISO + oral placebo and the ISO + oral 263 ondansetron study groups and commercially prepared single-use saline pads for the inhaled saline + ondansetron oral 264 solution group that are identical with the exception of the labeling. Both pads will remain in their original packaging.  Pain 265 and nausea measurements will be gathered at 0, 10, 20, 30, and 60 minutes and then again hourly up to 5 hours, and 266 then finally at the time the patient’s attending physician makes a disposition decision. The patient may withdraw from the 267 study at any time.  At any time during the study, a rescue antiemetic drug can be considered by subject request or 268 provider preference.   The individual pads will be de-identified, utilizing brown tape over original packaging that tears open 269

The only 270 scenarios in which a study team member will prompt a provider to consider a rescue anti-emetic is if the patient vomits or 271 if the patient actively requests an alternative medication.  A study data form will be completed for each subject by the 272 study investigators and secured daily in a locked cabinet, along with locked study file box, in the EM APD-R office. 273

 Form P2 - Version 2.2, 5 March 2013  Page 9 of 11  Protection of Data.  Subjects will be assigned a study number upon enrollment in order to facilitate subsequent removal of 331 identifiers upon completion of data analysis.  The study number will be recorded on the data collection form and on a study 332 key, which links the study number with the subject’s name, FMP, SSN, and DOB. Otherwise patients will be de-identified by 333 eliminating names and collecting only demographic (with ages greater than 89 categorized as “greater than 89”), general 334 description of chief complaint, personal medical, surgical, and medication history; and any other information specific to 335 inclusion and exclusion criteria.  The case report forms, signed consent forms, and signed HIPAA authorizations will be stored 336 in a locked cabinet only accessible to the study investigators within the secure EM APD-R office.   337  338 7.7.1 Certificate of Confidentiality.  N/A.   339  340 8.0  RISKS/BENEFITS ASSESSMENT 341  342 8.1  Risks.  There is a risk to the subjects related to loss of confidentiality.  However, this risk is minimized by using a 343 unique study code while collecting study data and limiting access to subject records to the study team.  Since all patients 344 will be receiving treatment for nausea (either inhaled isopropyl alcohol, oral ondansetron, or both), we believe the risks of 345 delay in treatment or symptom relief are minimal.  Nevertheless, if the treatment to which subjects are allocated is not 346 effective in treating their symptoms, they may experience a delay in rescue therapy and so a delay in symptom relief.  We 347 seek to minimize this risk by permitting, subjects to request an antiemetic at any time and to withdraw from the study at 348 any time.   349  350 Additionally, there may be an extremely rare incident of a subject that may have a sensitivity to inhaling ISO.  The 351 exclusion criteria were defined to minimize the risks of such reactions by excluding patients recently exposed to 352 medications such as cefoperazone, disulfiram, or metronidazole. 353  354 Some patients may also have an adverse reaction from swallowing ondansetron oral solution.  These may include the 355 following: 356  357 Central nervous system: Headache (oral: 9% to 27%; IV: 17%), fatigue (oral: ≤9% to 13%), malaise (oral: ≤9% to 13%)  358  359 Gastrointestinal: Constipation (6% to 11%)  360  361 1% to 10%:  362  363 Central nervous system: dizziness (7%), agitation (oral: ≤6%), anxiety (oral: ≤6%) 364  365 Dermatologic: Pruritus (2% to 5%), skin rash (1%)  366  367 Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea (oral: 6% to 7%) 368  369 Genitourinary: Gynecologic disease (oral: 7%), urinary retention (oral: 5%)  370  371 Hepatic: Increased serum ALT (>2 times ULN: 1% to 5%; transient), increased serum AST (>2 times ULN: 1% to 5%; 372 transient)  373  374 Local: Injection site reaction (IV: 4%; includes burning sensation at injection site, erythema at injection site, injection site 375 pain)  376  377 Respiratory: Hypoxia (oral: 9%)  378  379 Miscellaneous: Fever (2% to 8%) 380  381 8.2 Potential Benefits.  Shortened time to relief of nausea and/or vomiting may be a benefit to the two groups allocated 382 to inhaled isopropyl alcohol. The group not receiving inhaled isopropyl alcohol will receive oral ondansetron which has 383 been shown to improve nausea in previous studies (though nausea relief is commensurate to that of intravenous fluids 384 alone).  Therefore, we anticipate that all study groups will receive some benefit from the study. 385  386

The research monitor will review all unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others, 421 serious adverse events and all subject deaths associated with the protocol and provide an unbiased written report of the 422 event to the RHC-C IRB. Other responsibilities may be assigned by the IRB. The research monitor will comment on the 423 outcomes of the event or problem and in the case of a serious adverse event or death comment on the relationship to 424 participation in the study. The research monitor will also indicate whether he/she concurs with the details of the report 425 provided by the study investigator. Reports for events determined by either the investigator or research monitor to be 426 possibly or definitely related to participation and reports of events resulting in death will be promptly forwarded to the 427 RHC-C IRB office. 428  429  430 10.0 WITHDRAWAL FROM STUDY PARTICIPATION.  Patients may withdraw their consent at any time and 431 discontinue further participation in this study without affecting their eligibility for care or any other benefits to 432 which they are entitled.  They may withdraw for any reason.  Should they choose to withdraw, they must notify 433 the principle investigator or any other member of the research team. They may do this during the study in 434 person by verbally stating to the research team member that they wish to withdraw.  After the study, they may 435 withdraw by calling or writing the principle investigator (PI contact information provided to all study participants 436 on the informed consent document). We will analyze any data collected on these patients prior to withdrawal unless 437 requested by the subject to destroy their data form.   There are no risks associated with withdrawing from the study.   438  439 11.0 USAMRMC Volunteer Registry Database. N/A 440  441 12.0  REFERENCES.   442

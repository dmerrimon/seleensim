Amendment 11 18June 2019 This global amendment incorporates the 
provisional measures on the restrictions for 
prescriptions of tofacitinib set forth on 17 May 
2019 by the European Medicines Agency’s 
Pharm acovigilance Ri sk Assessment Committee
(PRAC) in the European Union.
Subjects receiving tofacitinib 10 mg BID who 
are identified as having one or more of the 
contraindicated risk factors for pulmonary 
embolism as described by PRAC will have their 
dose reduced to tofaciti nib 5 mg BID.
Any subject identified as having one or more of 
the contraindicated risk factors for pulmonary 
embolism as described by PRAC will not be 
permitted to receive tofacitinib 10 mgBID.  
A risk factor check for pulmonary embolism is
added for each visit beyond Month 36,since at 
the time of this amendment, all subjects have 
crossed the Month 36 study visit.

Page 6PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Indication :
Tofacitinib, also known as tofacitinib citrate or CP-690,550, is being developed for the 
treatment of patients with moderatel y to severel y active ulcerative colitis who have had an 
inadequate response to conventional therap y.
Background and Rationale :
Tofacitinib is a potent, sele ctive inhibitor of the JAK famil y of kinases with a high degree of 
selectivity  against other kinases in the human genome.   In kinase assay s, tofacitinib inhibits 
JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and to a lesser extent Ty K2.  In cellular settings where JAK kinases 
signal in pairs, tofacitinib preferentiall y inhibits signaling b y heterodimers containing JAK3 
and/or JAK1 with functional selectivity  over JAK2 homodimer signaling.   Inhibition of 
JAK1 and JAK3 by  tofacitinib blocks signaling through the common gamma chain 
conta ining receptors for several cy tokines, including IL -2, -4,-7,-9, - 15 and -21.  These 
cytokines are integral to ly mphocy te activation, proliferation, and function, and inhibition of 
their signaling may  thus result in modulation of multiple aspects of the im mune response.   In 
addition, inhibition of JAK1 will result in attenuation of signaling b y additional 
pro-inflammatory  cytokines, such as IL -6 and IFN .  At higher exposures, inhibition of 
erythropoietin, prolactin and other hormones could occur via inhibi tion of JAK2 homodimer 
signaling.
The broad effects of JAK1/3 inhibition on multiple cy tokine pathway s provides the rationale 
for developing tofacitinib as treatment for several diseases in which l ymphocy te 
activation/proliferation plays a pathogenic role.   Tofacitinib is being studied as an oral 
treatment for ulcerative colitis ( UC), Crohn’s disease, as a disease -modify ing anti- rheumatic 
drug (DMARD) for the treatment of RA, as treatment for plaque psoriasis and for the 
prevention of renal allograft reject ion.
Objectives and Endpoints:
Primary Objective
To assess the safet y and tolerability of long -term tofacitinib therap y in subjects with 
UC.
Secondary Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy  of long -term tofacitinib therap y in subjects with UC .
To evaluate theeffect of long -term tofacitinib therapy  on quality -of-life in subjects 
with UC.
Primary Efficacy Endpoint
As this is an open- label extension study , there will b e no primary  efficacy  endpoint.

Page 8Study Design :
This is a Phase 3, multi -center, open -label study  in subjects who have completed or 
demonstrate d treatment failure in the maintenance study  A3921096, or who were 
non-responders after completing induction studies A3921094 or A3921095.  Approximately  
900subjects are expected to become eligible for the study .  This study  will continue up to 
approximat ely July 2020 .Individual subject duration of participation will vary  depending on 
when the subject was enrolled into the study  and the end date of approximately  July 2020.  
Therefore, the duration of participation for an individual subject may  range from
approximately 4years to more than 7years .If the study  continues bey ond year6 for an 
individual subject, the investigator should continue to follow the same visit schedule and 
study  procedures outlined during the stud y visits of year 4.
Subjects who completed Study  A3921096 or had earl y withdrawal due to treatment failure as 
defined in the A3921096 protocol may be eligible to enroll in this study , A3921139.  I n 
addition, subjects who complete induction Study A3921094 or A3921095 and are classified 
as non-responders may  be eligible to enroll in this study .  The eligibility  of a subject for this 
study  will be assessed based on study  data collected at Week 8/9 of Study  A3921094 or 
A3921095 (for non-responders) or the Week 52/ 53 visit (for completers) or e arly termination 
visit (early withdrawals due to treatment failure) of Study  A3921096.  The study  data 
collected at the Week 8/9visit for Study  A3921094 or A3921095 (for non -responders) or the 
Week 52/53visit or early termination visit of Study A3921096 will be recorded as the 
baseline data for Study  A3921139.
Eligible subjects will be assigned to either tofacitinib 5mg twice a day  (BID) or 10 mg BID 
depending on whether the subject is in remission at baseline of Stud y A3921139.  Remission
is defined b y a total Mayo score 2 with no individual subscore >1, and rectal bleeding 
subscore of 0 .  Eligible subjects who are in remission at Week 52 of Study A3921096 will be 
assigned to receive tofacitinib 5mg BID.  For treatment assignment at baseline , the centr al 
read assessment of the May o endoscopic subscore will be used to determine if a subject is in 
remission.  Subjects who complete Study  A3921096 but do not meet the remission definition 
or who are early  withdrawals due to treatment failure in Study  A3921096 are eligible to 
receive tofacitinib 10mg BID.  Treatment failure is defined by  an increase in May o score of 
at least 3 points from baseline value of the maintenance study (A3921096) , accompanied by  
an increase in rectal bleeding subscore b y at least 1 point, and an increase of endoscopic 
subscore of at least 1point (yielding an absolute endoscopic subscore of  2) after a minimum 
of 8weeks of treatment in the maintenance study .  In the scenario where the endoscopic 
subscore is a ‘3’, and the maintenance baseline endoscopic subscore is alr eady  a ‘3’ 
(maximum value) ,then an increase b y at least 1 point will not be needed in order to meet 
treatment failure.  However, all other components of the treatment failure criteria will still 
need to be met. Subject s who complete induction studies A3921094 or A3921095 and are 
classified as non- responders are also eligible to receive tofacitinib 10mgBID.

Page 9Tofacitinib dose can be adjusted from 5 mg BID to 10 mg BID for efficacy and from 
10mgBID to 5 mgBID after meeting specific laboratory  abnormalities or other protocol 
defined criteria regarding efficacy  (seeSection 5.8for dose adjustment guidelines).  Dose 
adjustments c an only  occur after a subject has received at least 8 weeks of treatment in Study  
A3921139.
Subjects who enroll into this study  who are on tofacitinib 10 mgBIDfor at least 
2consecutive years, and who are in stable remission on tofacitinib 10 mgBID for at least 
6months may have the opportunity  to enter Study A3921288 (A Phase 3b/4, Multi -Center, 
Double- Blind, Randomized, Parallel Group Study  of Tofacitinib in Subjects with UC in 
Stable Remission) if they meet the eligibility  criteria. Study A3921288 will evaluate the 
efficacy  and sa fety of tofacitinib in subjects in stable remission on 10 mgBID who decrease 
the dose to and remain on 5 mgBID compared to subjects who remain on 10 mgBID. 
Subjects from the induction studies A3921094 or A3921095 (i e,non-responders) who fail to 
demons trate clinical response at Month 2 of this study  will be withdrawn from the study .  
Clinical response is defined by a decrease from the induction study  baseline (A3921094 or 
A3921095) May o score of at least 3 points and at least 30%, with an accompany ing d ecrease 
in the rectal bleeding subscore of at least 1 point or an absolute rectal bleeding subscore of 
0 or 1.  The endoscopic subscore based on central reading will be used to assess clinical 
response.
All subjects who withdraw earl y or who complete this open -label study , with the exception 
of those subjects entering Study A3921288, will have a 4 -week safet yfollow -up evaluation 
after the last dose of study  medication .
Subjects will be required to remain on stable doses of their concomitant medications fo r UC
during the stud y period , with the exception of oral 5-ASA or sulfasalazine and oral 
corticosteroids described inSection 5.5.  Subjects who enter this study  on corticosteroids 
(eg,subjec ts who withdraw from Study  A3921096 due to treatment failure or non -responders 
at the end of Study  A3921094 or A3921095 ) will need to continue the steroid tapering 
regimen described in Study  A3921096 (see Section 5.5).  If a subject requires rescue therap y 
(see Section 5.7) or undergoes surgery for UC , the subject should be withdrawn from the 
study  and appropriate agents should be given at the discretion of the investigator.   If a subject 
discontinues the use of background oral 5-ASA or sulfasalazine during the study  and/orhas 
the therap y re-initiated, this will not constitute rescue therapy , and the subject will be 
permitted to re main in the study .  
Study Treatments :
Subjects will be assigned to one of two dose groups depending on their remission status at 
baseline of Study  A3921139:
Tofacitinib 5mg BID (subjects in remission) .
Tofacitinib 10 mg BID (all other subjects).

1. The baseline visit of Study A3921139 is the same visit as either the Week 53 visit for subjects who complete Study A3921096 o r early termination visit for subjects who are 
treatment failures during Study A3921096, OR is the same visit as the Week 9 visit for subjects who complete Study A3921094 or A3921095 and are deemed to be non-
responders.  All procedures done at Week 52/53 visit or the early termination visit of Study A3921096 or Week 8/9 visit of Stud y A3921094 or A3921095 for subjects 
enrolled into this study will be used as the baseline data for Study A3921139.  Procedures listed as IND or MNT = Induction Stu dy or Maintenance Study procedures will 
NOT BE REPEATED at baseline of Study A3921139.  Only those procedures marked with a ‘X’ will be performed at the baseline visit .
2. Subjects who discontinue treatment early from the study will have an early termination (ET) visit and all procedures listed a t Month 12/ET will be performed on the last day 
the subject takes the study medication or as soon as possible.  Subjects from the induction studies A3921094 or A3921095 (ie, n on-responders) who fail to demonstrate 
clinical response at Month 2 will be withdrawn from the study and will be required to have a modified ET visit consisting of only the following procedures: complete physical 
examination, 12-lead ECG, return all study drug and perform study drug accountability. The Month 12/ET visit will also serve as th e Evaluation Visit for Entry into CCI

Page 13Study A3921288. If, after completion of the evaluation visit for entry into Study A3921288, a subject does not meet eligibility cr iteria, they should remain in this 
study (A3921139).
3. Medical history from either the induction studies (A3921094 or A3921095) or the maintenance study (A3921096) will be used for  Study A3921139.  Resolved AEs occurring 
in these studies will be captured as part of Baseline Medical History, while ongoing AEs from either A3921094 or A3921095, or A 3921096 study will be followed throughout 
Study A3921139.
4. The targeted physical examination consists of weight, general appearance, and examinations of eyes, mouth, lungs, heart, abdom en, musculoskeletal, extremities, skin and 
lymph nodes.
5. 12-lead ECG and vital sign measurements should be performed before laboratory blood collection and endoscopic procedure, when po ssible.
6. Dipstick in all cases; microscopy analysis is indicated if urinalysis is positive for blood, nitrite, leucocyte esterase and/ or protein.  Urine culture performed if urinalysis is 
positive for nitrite and/or leucocyte esterase or if clinically indicated.
7. Urine β-hCG to be performed only for women of childbearing potential.  Pregnancy testing may be performed more frequently per local re gulations.
8. Annual tuberculosis (TB) screening will be conducted using Quantiferon-TB®Gold Plus test (QFT) for subjects in those countries in which TB prevalence has been reported 
at a rate of >50 cases per 100,000 persons (see Section 7.3.6 ). TB testing is not required at the ET visit.  All subjects with positive results must have chest radiograph 
performed.  Note: QFT should not be performed in subjects who had positive result during prior testing (screening visit in Stud y A3921094 or A3921095 or prior annual 
visits) and/or previously received adequate treatment for TB.
9. Flexible sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy (if preferred) will be performed at Month 2 for all subjects.  The Mayo endoscopic subscore at Month 2 was assessed by both central 
reader and study site investigator prior to implementation of Amendm ent 8.  After implementation of Amendment 8, the Month 2 Mayo en doscopic subscore will only be 
assessed by site investigator.  All other endoscopies performed in this study will only be read by study site investigator.  Su bjects from the induction studies A3921094 or 
A3921095 (ie, non-responders) who fail to demonstrate clinical response at Month 2 of this study will be withdrawn from the stud y.
10. Bowel movement (BM) diary data will be collected through a phone-based IVRS tool.  Subjects will be instructed in its use at  the Baseline visit.  Automatic reminders will be 
generated prior to scheduled visits to remind subjects to start completing the BM diary daily approximately 7 days prior to thei r next scheduled visit.  Study site staff will also 
contact the subjects 7 days prior to the scheduled visit to ensure compliance.  In addition, subjects should be instructed to st art completing the BM diary whenever he/she 
experiences any worsening of UC symptoms anytime during the study.
11. Subjects should complete the self-administered IBDQ,  prior to any clinical assessments at the scheduled times noted 
above.  A member of the site staff should be available if a subject requires further instruction and to review the questionnair es for completeness prior to leaving the clinic

4. The targeted physical examination consists of weight, general appearance, and examinations of eyes, mouth, lungs, heart, abdo men, musculoskeletal, extremities, skin and 
lymph nodes.
5. 12-lead ECG and vital sign measurements should be performed before laboratory blood collection and endoscopic procedure, when possible.
6. Dipstick in all cases; microscopy analysis is indicated if urinalysis is positive for blood, nitrite, leucocyte esterase and/ or protein.  Urine culture performed if urinalysis is 
positive for nitrite and/or leucocyte esterase or if clinically indicated.
7. Urine β-hCG to be performed only for women of childbearing potential. Pregnancy testing may be performed more frequently per local reg ulations.
8. Annual TB screening will be conducted using Quantiferon-TB®Gold Plus test (QFT) for subjects in those countries in which TB prevalence has been reported at a rate of 
>50 cases per 100,000 persons (see Section 7.3.6 ). TB testing is not required at the ET visit.  All subjects with positive results must have chest radiograph performed.  
Note: QFT should not be performed in subjects who had positive result during prior testing (screening visit in Study A3921094 or  A3921095 or prior annual visits) and/or 
previously received adequate treatment for TB.
10. Bowel movement (BM) diary data will be collected through a phone-based IVRS tool.  Automatic reminders will be generated prio r to scheduled visits to remind subjects 
to start completing the BM diary daily approximately 7 days prior to their next scheduled visit.  Study site staff will also con tact the subjects 7 days prior to the scheduled 
visit to ensure compliance.  In addition, subjects should be instructed to start completing the BM diary whenever he/she experie nces any worsening of UC symptoms 
anytime during the study.
11. Subjects should complete the self-administered IBDQ,  prior to any clinical assessments at the scheduled times noted 
above.  A member of the site staff should be available if a subject requires further instruction and to review the questionnaire s for completeness prior to leaving the clinic 
visit.  CCI

Section 7.3.12 .  At the time of Amendment 11, all subjects have completed the Month 36 study visit and therefore this procedure is only collec ted at visits beyond 
Month 36 as applicable to each subject’s individual participation.  If a subject has a newly identified risk factor for pulmonary  embolism and is receiving tofacitinib 
10 mg BID, they must reduce their dose to tofacitinib 5 mg BID.
14. All subjects are required to have a 4-week follow-up evaluation after the last dose of study medication.
* If the study continues beyond Month 72 for an individual subject, the investigator should continue to follow the same visit sc hedule and study procedures outlined during the

Page 251.INTRODUCTIO N
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory  disease of the colon 
characterized b y alternating episodes of remission and spontaneous relapse.  The prevalence 
has been estimated to range from 37 to 246 cases per 100,000 persons in North A merica and 
21 to 243 cases per 100,000 persons in Europe .1It is most commonly  diagnosed in late 
adolescence and early adulthood, with the peak incidence occurring between 20 -39years of 
age.2  
Although the precise pathogenesis of UC is presently  unknown, the prevailing paradigm is 
dysregulation of the enteric immune response in geneticall y susceptible individuals .3Such 
defective immune s ystem leads to upregulation of macrophages and Th2 lymphocytes in UC, 
as a result of inabilit y to appropriatel y downregulate both innate and adaptive immune
response sto endogenous luminal antigens.  This produces an excess of cy tokines, 
interleukins and chemokines, all of which can lead to enhanced inflammation and tissue 
damage.  Evidence has shown that upregulation of some of the common gamma -chain 
cytokines may  play  a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory  bowel disease (IBD), of whi ch 
the two main forms are UC and Crohn’s disease. 
The hallmark clinical presentations for UC include diarrhea, rectal bleeding, passage of 
mucus, tenesmus, urgency, and abdominal pain . Patients may  also experience fatigue, fevers, 
weight loss, and deh ydration, particularl y in more severe cases. Mortality  is not increased in 
UC in general, but the disease may  present as life -threatening fulminant colitis.  Most 
patients follow a chronic intermittent course with periods of increased disease activit y 
separa ted by  periods of disease remission. After the initial diagnosis, approximately  half of 
patients will have active disease at an y single point in time and approximately 90% will have 
a disease course characterized by  intermittent flares.5
The disease almost universally  involves the rectum, extending proximally  to involve a 
portion of or the entire colon.  At the time of initial presentation, approximately  45% of 
patients have disease limited to the rectum and si gmoid (proctosigmoiditis), approximately  
35% have disease extending bey ond the sigmoid but not involving the entire colon, and 
approximately  20% of patients have pancolitis .5However, a substantial number of pa tients 
will experience disease extension over time .6,7
Current therap y for the treatment of UC includes 5 -aminosalicy lic acid (5 -ASA), sy stemic 
and/or topical steroid s, immunosuppressants such as azathioprine/6 -mercaptopurine and 
cyclosporin e, and tumor -necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) blockers.4  However, despite
these treatment options, a significant proportion of UC pati ents still require colectom y for 
refractory  or severe fulminant disease, or in some cases for cancer preven tion.5  Although 
patients with UC are often considered to be cured by  restorative proctocolectomy , the quality  
of life may  be poor and the surgery  can be associated with short -term and long -term 
complications, including a decreased female fecundity  and the development of pouchitis.11,8  
At present, no current pharmacological therap y is able to provide a cure for UC. The primary  
treatment goal is to induce remission and then to maintain this state.  Therefore, identification 
of new effective therapies is an important are a of research.

Page 26This study  is designed to evaluate the long term safety  and tolerability  of tofacitinib in 
patients with moderate lyto severe ly active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate 
response to conventional therap y.
1.1.Indication
Tofacitinib, also known as tofacitinib citrate or CP-690,550, is being developed for the
treatment of patients with moderate lyto severe ly active ulcerative colitis who have had an 
inadequate response to conventional therap y.
1.2.Background and Rationale
Tofacitinib is a potent, selective inhibitor of the JAK famil y of kinases with a high degree of 
selectivity  against other kinases in the human genome .12  In kinase assay s, tofacitinib inhibits 
JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and to a lesser exte nt Ty K2.  In cellular settings where JAK kinases 
signal in pairs, tofacitinib preferentiall y inhibits signaling b y heterodimers containing JAK3 
and/or JAK1 with functional selectivity  over JAK2 homodimer signaling .13  Inhibition of 
JAK1 and JAK3 by  tofacitinib blocks signaling through the common gamma chain 
containing receptors for several cy tokines, including IL -2, -4,-7,-9, - 15 and -21.  These 
cytokines are integral to ly mphocy te activation, proliferation, and function, and inhibition of 
their signaling may  thus result in modulation of multiple aspects of the immune response.   In 
addition, inhibition of JAK1 will result in attenuation of signaling b y additional 
pro-inflammatory  cytokines, such as IL -6 and IFN .14  At higher exposures, inhibition of 
erythropoietin, prolactin and other hormones could occur via inhibition of JAK2 homodimer 
signaling.
The broad effects of JAK1/ 3 inhibition on multiple cy tokine pathway s pro vides the rationale 
for developing tofacitinib as treatment for several diseases in which l ymphocy te 
activation/proliferation play s a pathogenic role.  Tofacitinib is being studied as anoral 
treatment for UC, Crohn’s disease, as a disease -modify ing anti-r heumatic drug (DMARD) 
for the treatment of RA, as treatment for plaque psoriasis and for the prevention of renal 
allograft rejection.
Summary of Efficacy:
Efficacy  of tofacitinib in the treatment of UC has been evaluated in one Phase 2 study: 
A3921063.  Ef ficacy  of tofacitinib has also been evaluated in Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid 
arthritis, psoriasis, and renal transplant.  Details of the efficacy  results in these patient 
populations can be found in the current version of the tofacitinib Investigator Brochure.
Study  A3921063 was a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase 2 study  
evaluating the safet y and efficacy of tofacitinib in subjects with moderate to severe UC.  In 
this study , 195 subjects with moderate to severe active UC were randomized at a 
1:1:1:2:2 ratio into one of the five treatment groups of tofacitinib 0.5mgBID, 3 mg BID, 
10mg BID, 15 mg BID, and the matched placebo for treatment duration of 8 weeks.

Page 27The study  demonstrated dose -dependent improvements with tofacitinib treatment in clinical 
response (primary  endpoint) and clinical remission rates.  Based on protocol- predefined full -
analysis population, the primary  endpoint of clinical response (reduction of May o score by at 
least 3 points or 30% from baseline with an accompany ing de crease in the subscore for rectal 
bleeding of at least 1 point or absolute subscore for rectal bleeding of 0 or 1 ) at Week8 was 
achieved in 47.5%, 29.6%, 51.6%, 63.3%, and 80.0% of subjects in the placebo and 
tofacitinib 0.5 mg, 3 mg, 10mg, and 15 mg BID groups, respectively .  The proportions of 
subjects in clinical remission (total May o score of 2 or lower with no individual subscore 
exceeding 1) at Week8 (secondary  endpoint) were 12.2%, 7.4%, 35.5%, 50.0%, and 42.2% 
in the placebo and tofacitinib 0.5 m g, 3mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg BID treatment groups, 
respectivel y.  Based on the dose -response model, both 10 mg BID and 15 mg BID doses met 
the protocol -predefined criteria for proof of concept for the primary  endpoint . These data 
were further supported by  results in other secondary  efficacy  endpoints including endoscopic 
endpoints and by  data in biomarkers and patient -reported outcomes.
Summary of Safety:
The clinical development program for tofacitinib includes health y volunteers and patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, dry eye disease, and 
renal transplant recipients enrolled in more than 50 Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies.  In the 
completed Phase 2 study  in UC (A3921063), 146 patients with UC received at least one do se 
of tofacitinib (ranging from 0.5 mg BID to 15 mg BID) with 8-week treatment duration.  In 
addition, in the completed Phase 2 study  in Crohn’s disease (A3921043), 105 patients with 
Crohn’s disease received at least one dose of tofacitinib (ranging from 1 mg BID to 
15mgBID) with 4- week treatment duratio n.  These two studies represent an approximate 
total of 28 patient -years of exposure in IBD (approximately  20patient -years in UC and 
8patient -years in Crohn’s disease).
Safety  information from the 8 -week Phase 2 study in UC (A3921063) is summarized below.
Based on the totality  of the clinical data generated thus far, safet y findings and potential risks 
that ma y be associated with the use of tofacitinib include serious and other important 
infections, inclu ding tuberculosis and herpes zoster, potential for malignancies including 
lymphoma, and potential for gastrointestinal perforations. Based on nonclinical data, there is 
the potential for tofacitinib to have effects on pregnancy  and the fetus.
Laboratory  changes observed with the oral use of tofacitinib in humans include decreases in 
neutrophil and ly mphocyte counts and hemoglobin levels, increases in serum creatinine, total 
cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, transaminases and creatine kinase. Recovery  
of laboratory  changes upon discontinuation of tofacitinib treatment are characteristically  
observed.
In the Phase 2 UC study  (A3921063), the overall incidences of AEs were similar between 
tofacitinib- treated and placebo -treated subjects. The most frequentl y reported AEs were 
colitis ulcerative (worsening of ulcerative colitis) (11.3%) and headache (7.2%).  The 
majority  of AEs were mild in severity . Most of the AEs were reported b y the investigator as

Page 28unrelated to stud y treatment . There were 9 subjects (range 0- 4 per treatment group, with 
highest incidence in the placebo group) with permanent discontinuation of study  drug due to 
an AE. None of the tofacitinib -treated subjects had a treatment- related discontinuation.  
SAEs were reported in 10 sub jects (range 0 -4 per treatment group, with highest incidence in 
the placebo group). One subject each in the placebo and tofacitinib 0.5 mg and 3 mg groups
experienced a treatment -related SAE (UC each in placebo and 0.5 mg groups; general 
physical health d eterioration in 3 mg group). 
There were no clinicall y significant changes from baseline at Week8 in mean neutrophils, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum creatinine, AST and AL T across all dose groups. 
Dose -related increases from baseline at Week8 in both me an LDL and HDL were observed 
across all dose groups, with the largest increase occurring in the tofacitinib 15mg group. In 
conclusion, tofacitinib up to the doses of 15 mg BID for stud y duration of 8 weeks was 
generall y well tolerated in subjects with UC, and the overall safet y profile was consistent 
with that observed in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.
Complete information for this compound may  be found in the Single Reference Safet y 
Document (SRSD) , which for this study  is the Investigator ’sBrochur e (IB) .
1.3. Clinical Pharmacokinetics
The pharmacokinetics of tofacitinib in humans is characterized b y rapid absorption and 
elimination, with a time to peak concentration (T max) of approximately  0.5hour and a 
half-life (t 1/2) of approximately 3 hours. Stead y state pharmacokinetics is predictable from 
single dose data, with no evidence of accumulation.  I n general, s ystemic exposure of 
tofacitinib increases with dose in a dose -proportional manner without regard to duration or 
population. 
The clearance mechan isms for tofacitinib in humans appear to be both non -renal (hepatic 
metabolism) and renal excretion of the parent drug, the former accounting for approximately  
70% of the total clearance. The metabolism of tofacitinib appears to be primarily  mediated 
by CYP3A4 with minor contribution from CYP2C19 (based on data from poor metabolizers 
of CYP2C19).
1.4.Rational eof Dose Selection
Study  A3921139 is an extension to the Phase 3 placebo -controlled induction studies 
(A3921094 and A3921095) and the maintenance study (A3921096) to provide subjects 
long-term open -label therapy , thus the doses included in this study  are supported by  the dose 
selection rationale for the maintenance Study  A3921096.  
The inclusion of 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID in Study  A3921096 is based on the dose-response 
data from the Phase 2 induction Study A3921063, where doses ranging from 0.5 mg BID to 
15mg BID were evaluated. It is expected that the maintenance effect will be achieved at 
doses not higher than the doses for achieving the induction effec t.  Based on the observed
efficacy  profile at 10 mg BID after dosing for 8 weeks in S tudy A3921063, this dose is 
expected to be sufficient to provide maintenance of remission for 12 months.  Although there 
are no data available on persistence of efficacy  with tofacitinib treatment beyond 8 weeks in

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 29patients with UC, completed randomized- controlled studies in RA ranging from 6 to 
24weeks in duration showed persistence of efficacy  up to 24 weeks.  In addition as a small 
molecule, tofacitinib is not expected to have a loss of response due to immunogenicity  once 
efficacy  and safet y are established in a specific patient. Inclusion of 5 mg BID in S tudy
A3921096 allows evaluation of a maintenance dose lower than 10 mg BID.  I mportantly , 
extensive safety  data from the RA program support the choices of 10 mg BID and 5 mgBID 
for this study .
The inclusion of both 5 mg and 10 mg BID in this study  will provide long term safet y data 
should 5 mg and/or 10 mg BID prove to be effective maintenance doses in Study  A3921096.

Page 313. STUDY DESIGN
This is a Phase 3, multi-center, open-label study in subjects who have completed or 
demonstrated treatment failure in the maintenance study A3921096, or who were non-responders after completing induction studies A3921094 or A3921095.  Approximately 900 subjects are expected to become eligible for the study.  This study will continue up toapproximately July 2020.  Individual subject duration of participation will vary depending on when the subject was enrolled into the study and the end date of approximately July 2020.  Therefore, the duration of participation for an individual subject may range from approximately 4 years to more than 7 years.  If the study continues beyond Month 72 for an 
individual subject, the investigator should continue to follow the same visit schedule and 
study procedures outlined during the study visits of year 4.
Subjects who completed Study A3921096 or had early withdrawal due to treatment failure as 
defined in the A3921096 protocol may be eligible to enroll in this study, A3921139.  In addition, subjects who complete induction Study A3921094 or A3921095 and are classified as non-responders may be eligible to enroll in this study.  The eligibility of a subject for thisstudy will be assessed based on study data collected at Week 8/9 of Study A3921094 or A3921095 (for non-responders) or the Week 52/53 visit (for completers) or early termination visit (early withdrawals due to treatment failure) of Study A3921096.  The study data collected at the Week 8/9 visit for Study A3921094 or A3921095 (for non-responders) or the Week 52/53 visit or early termination visit of Study A3921096 will be recorded as the baseline data for Study A3921139.
Eligible subjects will be assigned to either tofacitinib 5 mg BID or 10 mg BID depending on 
whether the subject is in remission at baseline of Study A3921139.  Remission
is defined by 
a total Mayo score ≤2 with no individual subscore >1, and rectal bleeding subscore of 0.  
Eligible subjects who are in remission at Week 52 of Study A3921096 will be assigned to receive tofacitinib 5 mg BID.  For treatment assignment at baseline, the central readassessment of the Mayo endoscopic subscore will be used to determine if a subject is in remission.

Page 32or who are early  withdrawals due to treatment failure in Study  A3921096 are eligible to
receive tofacitini b 10 mgBID.  Treatment failure is defined by  an increase in May o score of 
at least 3 points from baseline value of the maintenance study (A3921096) , accompanied by  
an increase in rectal bleeding subscore b y at least 1 point, and an increase of endoscopic 
subscore of at least 1point (yielding an absolute endoscopic subscore of  2)after a minimum 
of 8weeks of treatment in the maintenance study .  In the scenario where the endoscopic 
subscore is a ‘3’, and the maintenance baseline endoscopic subscore is alr eady  a ‘3’ 
(maximum value) ,then an increase b y at least 1 point will not be needed in order to meet 
treatment failure.  However, all other components of the treatment failure criteria will still 
need to be met.   Subjects who complete induction studies A3921094 or A3921095 and are 
classified as non-responders are also eligible to receive tofacitinib 10mg BID.  
Tofacitinib dose can be adjusted from 5 mg BID to 10 mg BID for efficacy and from 
10 mg BID to 5 mg BID after meeting specific laboratory  abnormali tiesor other protocol 
defined criteria regarding efficacy (seeSection 5.8for dose adjustment guidelines).  Dose 
adjustments can only  occur after a subject has received at least 8 weeks of treatment in Study  
A3921139.
Subjects who enroll into this study  who are on tofacitinib 10 mgBIDfor at least 
2consecutive years, and who are in stable remission on tofacitinib 10 mgBID for at least 
6months may have theopportunity  to enter Study A3921288 (A Phase 3b/4, Multi -Center, 
Double- Blind, Randomized, Parallel Group Study  of Tofacitinib in Subjects with UC in 
Stable Remission) if they meet the eligibility  criteria .  These subjects must:
Have received tofacitinib 10 mgBID for a minimum of 2 conse cutive years in
Study A3921139 (and not have their tofacitinib dose reduced to 5 mgBID due to 
safet y or efficacy.
Be in stable remission on tofacitinib 10 mgBID for the 6 month period in 
Study A3921139 up to and including the baseline visit of Study A392 1288, defined as 
meeting all of the following criteria:
A partial May o score 2, with no individual subscore >1 and a rectal bleeding 
subscore of 0 at each study visit during the 6 month period in Study A3921139 
prior to and at baseline of Study A3921288; AND
At least one assessment of remission based on Mayo score.
Not be receiving any corticosteroids to treat their UC for at least 4 weeks prior to the 
baseline visit of Study A3921288.
Not have an y of the risk factors for pulmonary  embolism as described in

remission on 10 mgBID who decrease the dose to and remain on 5mgBID compared to 
subjects who remain on 10 mgBID.  
Subjects from the induction studies A3921094 or A3921095 (i e,non-responders) who fail to 
demonstrate clinical response at Month 2 of this study  will be withdrawn from the study .  
Clinical response is defined by a decrease f rom the induction study  baseline (A3921094 or 
A3921095) May o score of at least 3 points and at least 30%, with an accompany ing decrease 
in the rectal bleeding subscore of at least 1 point or an absolute rectal bleeding subscore of 
0or 1.  The endoscopic s ubscore based on central reading will be used to assess clinical 
response.
All subjects who withdraw earl y or who complete this open -label study , with the exception 
of those subjects entering Study A3921288, will have a 4- week safet y follow -up evaluation 
after the last dose of study  medication.
Subjects will be required to remain on stable doses of their concomitant medications for UC
during the stud y period , with the exception of oral 5-ASA or sulfasalazine and oral 
corticosteroids described inSection 5.5.  Subjects who enter this study  on corticosteroids 
(eg,subjects who withdraw from Study  A3921096 due to treatment failure or non- responders 
at the end of Study A3921094 or A3921095) will ne ed to continue the steroid tapering 
regimen described in Study  A3921096 (seeSection 5.5).  If a subject requires rescue therap y 
(see Section 5.7) or undergoes surgery for UC , the subject should be withdrawn from the 
study  and appropriate agents should be given at the discretion of the investigator .  If a subject 
discontinues the use of background oral 5-ASA or sulfasalazine and/orhas the therap y 
re-initiated during the study , this will not constitute rescue therapy , and the subject will be 
permitted to remain in the study .

Amendment 11
On 17 May  2019, the European Medicines Agency’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment 
Committee (PRAC) issued interim recommendations on the restrictions for prescriptions of 
tofacitinib.  These interim recommendations on the restrictions for prescriptions of tofacitinib 
state that patients who are at high risk of blood clots in the lungs must not be started on 
tofacitinib 10 mg BID, and that such patients currently  taking tofacitinib 10 mg BID for any  
condition must be switched to alternative treatments.  Updated guidance from PRAC will be 
provided to patients and their healthcare professionals in the European Union (EU) once 
PRAC has completed its review of all available data. 
In light of the PRAC interim recommendations in the EU, Study  A3921139 will be modified 
globall y thro ugh protocol Amendment 11 ,which will involve the following updates:
1.The study  investigator or designee will need to review each subject ’s medical history  
and study  records, including their concomitant medications, to determine whether 
he/she is at high ri sk for developing pulmonary  embolism.  If he/she has any  of the 
risk factors listed below and is receiving tofacitinib 10 mg BID, the subject ’s 
tofacitinib dose should be reduced to 5 mg BID (see Section 5.8).

is taking combined hormonal con traceptives or hormone replacement therapy ;
has malignancy (association is strongest with cancers other than non- melanoma 
skin cancers) ;
is undergoing major surgery .
If a subject is identified as meeting an y of the above criteria, they  will be required to
adjust their dose from 10 mg BID (administered as 2 x 5 mg tablets in the AM and 
2x 5mgtablets in the PM) down to 5 mg BID (administered as 1 x 5 mg tablet in the 
AM a nd 1 x 5 mg tablet in the PM).
2.If a subject is taking tofacitinib 10 mg BID and does not have an y of the risk factors 
listed above, he/she will remain on tofacitinib 10 mg BID. 
3.If a subject is taking tofacitinib 5 mg BID, he/she will remain on tofacitinib 
5mgBID.  However, if a subject has an y of the risk factors listed above, he/she wi ll 
not be permitted to increase their dose of tofacitinib to 10 mg BID if he/she 
experiences a flare of their UC disease (see Section 5.8).
4. T he study  investigator or designee will be required to ask each subjec tat each study  
visit if he/she has an y newly -developed risk factors for pulmonary embolism, and if 
one is identified, the subject will not be permitted to receive tofacitinib 10 mgBID
(see Section 7.3.12 ).  At the time of Amendment 11, all subjects have reached the 
Month 36 study  visit, therefore subjects will undergo the risk factor check at visits 
beyond Month 36 as applicable to their individual participation.
4.SUBJECT SELEC TION
This study  can fulfill its objectives only  if appropriate subjects are enrolled.  The following 
eligibility  criteria are designed to select subjects for whom protocol treatment is considered 
appropriate.  All relevant medical and non -medical condition s should be taken into 
consideration when deciding whether this protocol is suitable for a particular subject.
4.1. Inclusion Criteria
Subject eligibility should be reviewed and documented by  an appropriatel y qualified member 
of the investigator’s study  team be fore subjects are included in the study .
Subjects must meet either inclusion criterion number 1 or 2 ,andallof the other follow ing 
inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment into the study :

defined by an increase in Mayo score of at least 3 points from baseline value of 
the maintenance study (A3921096), accompanied by an increase in rectal bleeding subscore by at least 1 point, and an increase of endoscopic subscore of at 
least 1 point (yielding an absolute endoscopic subscore of ≥2), after a minimum of 
8 weeks of treatment in the maintenance study.  In the scenario where the 
endoscopic subscore is a ‘3’, and the maintenance baseline endoscopic subscore is already a ‘3’ (maximum value), then an increase by at least 1 point will not be needed in order to meet treatment failure.  However, all other components of the treatment failure criteria will still need to be met.  Note, endoscopic subscores based on central reading will be used to assess treatment failure.
2. Subjects who previously participated in the induction Study A3921094 or A3921095 
who:
•did not demonstrate clinical response after completing 8 weeks of treatment.  
Clinical response is defined by a decrease from baseline in Mayo score of at least 
3 points and at least 30%, with an accompanying decrease in the rectal bleeding subscore of at least 1 point or an absolute rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1, and
•have an endoscopic subscore at Week 8 that is either the same or higher (worse) 
than the endoscopic subscore at Week 0 of Study A3921094 or A3921095.  Note, 
endoscopic subscores based on central reading will be used to determine eligibility.
3. Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of 
contraception throughout the study and for at least 4 weeks after the last dose of assigned treatment.  Subjects in Canada who are women of childbearing potential and sexually active must use two contraceptive methods at the same time: one highly effective contraceptive method and one additional effective contraceptive method  
.  
4. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to study 
enrollment.
5. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,

4.4.1. Tobacco
Smoking can have an influence on the severit y of ulcerative colitis sy mptoms. For that 
reason, subjects should keep their smoking habits constant throughout the study .  Useof 
nicotine patch should be recorded as a concomitant medication.
4.4.2. Activity
Subjects are encouraged to avoid changing their accustomed exercise levels throughout the 
study .
4.4.3. Diet and Dietary Supplements
Subjects are encouraged to keep their diet habits constant throughout the study .It is 
recomm ended that subjects avoid c onsumption of grapefruit juice exceeding 8 ounces 
(~240 mL) total in a day  while in the study .  
For the purposes of this protocol, dietary  supplements, such as vitamins, minerals, purified 
food substances, and herbals with pharm aceutical properties are considered as concomitant 
medications.  Dietary  supplements and herbs are allowed in the study , provided they  are 
taken at stable dose sprior to the baseline visit if they  arestarted prior to study  entry , and not 
associated with k nown effects on CYP3A that may  impact on metabolism of the study  
medication.   Starting dietary  supplement s or herb sduring the stud y as a new medication is 
permissible as long as they are not listed on the prohibited medication list (see Appendix 2).
4.4.4. Vaccination
Vaccination with live components is prohibited during the stud y and for 6weeks after last 
dose of study  medication.  Similarly , current routine household contact with individuals who 
have been vaccinated with live vacci ne components should be avoided during treatment and 
for 6weeks following completion of study  treatment.  Following vaccination with live 
component vaccines, the virus may  be shed in bodily  fluids, including stool, and there is a 
potential risk that the v irus may  be transmitted.
General guidelines suggest that exposure to individuals who have been vaccinated should be 
avoided for the following time periods:
a.FluMist(intranasal influenza vaccine) for 1 week following vaccination .
b.Attenuated rotavirus vacci ne for 10 days following vaccination .
c.Varicella for 4 weeks following vaccination.
d.Attenuated t yphoid fever vaccine for 4 weeks following vaccination.

4.4.5. Contraception
Based on preclinical data, tofacitini bhas a potential risk of teratogenicity  and earl y fetal loss. 
Due to this potential risk, women of childbearing potential should not be administered 
tofacitinib until pregnancy  is excluded and should use a highly  effective method of 
contraception (failur e rate <1% when used consistently  and correctl y) during therap y with 
tofacitinib .
For the purposes of this protocol female subjects must be of non -childbearing potential or 
using adequate contraception, as described below.
4.4.5.1. Females of Non -Childbearing Poten tial
Female subjects of non-childbearing potential must meet at least one of the following 
criteria:
Postmenopausal females are defined as females over the age of 45 years, who have 
been amenorrheic for at least 12 months with no alternative pathological o r 
physiological cause.  Postmenopausal status may  be carried forward from Study  
A3921094, A3921095 or A3921096.  If a female has not been confirmed to be 
postmenopausal during Study A3921094, A3921095 or A3921096, then FSH testing 
will be required at basel ine in this study .
Females who had a ph ysician -documented hy sterectomy  and/or bilateral 
oophorectom y.
Females who have medically -confirmed ovarian failure.
All other female subjects will be considered to be of childbearing potential.
4.4.5.2. Females of Childbeari ng Potential
All female subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, are biologicall y capable of having 
children and are sexually active, must agree to use a highl y effective method of contraception 
consistently  and correctly  for the duration of the a ctive treatment period and through the 
4-week follow -up procedures.  The investigator, in consultation with the subject, will select 
the most appropriate method of contraception for the individual subject from the permitted 
list of contraception methods, a nd instruct the subject in its consistent and correct use.  The 
investigator, at each study visit, will confirm and document consistent and correct use.  In 
addition, the investigator will instruct the subject to call immediately  if the selected birth 
control method is discontinued or if pregnancy  is known or suspected.  
Highl y effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie, perfect use) and 
include:
1. Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception.

Page 402. Correctly placed intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).
3. Male condom or female condom used WITH a spermicide (ie, foam, gel, film, cream, 
suppository).
4. Male sterilization with appropriately confirmed absence of sperm in the 
post-vasectomy ejaculate.
5. Bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectomy.
6. Absolute sexual abstinence, without a second method, may be considered an 
acceptable method at the discretion of the investigator.
 
 
4.4.5.3. Pregnancy Testing
Female subjects of childbearing potential will be tested for urine β-hCG at baseline and at 
each study visit (or more frequently if required by local regulations, if a menstrual cycle is
missed, or if potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected). Urine β-hCG testing will be 
performed at the study site using test kits supplied by the central laboratory using 
methodology with a testing sensitivity at least 25 mIU/mL.  If at any point there is a case of a 
positive urine β-hCG test, the subject will have study drug interrupted and a serum sample 
will be submitted to the central laboratory for β-hCG testing.  If the serum test confirms 
positive, the subject will be withdrawn from the study and all the necessary follow up will be 
conducted as per Section 8.9 .  If the serum test is negative, the subject may resume study 
drug.
4.4.5.4. Reproductive Status of Male Subjects
No tofacitinib effects on male fertility or offspring of dosed males have been observed in any 
preclinical studies conducted to date.  Therefore, no specific contraceptive measures are required in male subjects during study participation.
4.4.5.5. Surgery
During the course of this study, no elective surgery should be scheduled without first 
consulting with the Pfizer medical monitor.  Investigators should contact the Pfizer medical monitor regarding subjects who undergo non-elective surgery to discuss their suitability to remain in the study.
4.5. Sponsor’s Qualified Medical Personnel
The contact information for the sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the 
study is documented in the study contact list located in the investigator site file.CCI

Page 41To facilitate access to appropriat ely qualified medical personnel on stud y-related medical 
questions or problems, subjects are provided with a contact card.   The contact card contains, 
at a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, subject study  numbers, 
contact informati on for the investigational site, and contact details for a contact center in the 
event that the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical 
question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the 
subject’s participation in the study .  The contact number can also be used by  investigational 
staff if they  are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used 
only in the event that the established communication pathway s between the investigational 
site and the study  team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, 
the established communication pathway s between the investigational site and the study  team 
for advice on medical questions or probl ems that may  arise during the study .  The contact 
number is not intended for use by the subject directly, and if a subject calls that number, he 
or she will be directed back to the investigational site.
5.STUDY TREATMENTS
Subjects will be assigned to one of two dose groups depending on their remission status at 
baseline of Study  A3921 139:
Tofacitinib 5mg BID (subjects in remission) .
Tofacitinib 10mg BID (all other subjects).
Remission is defined by  a total May o score  2 with no individual subscore >1, and r ectal 
bleeding subscore of 0.  Cent ral read assessment of the May o endoscopic subscore will be 
used to determine if a subject is in remission at baseline .
5.1.Allocation to Treatment
Assignment of subject identification number, study  medication, and site drug inventory  
control will be managed by  a tele -randomization tool provided by  the sponsor.  A manual 
containing complete instructions for web or telephone access and use will be provided to 
each site prior to stud y start.
At the baseline visit, provided all inclusion /exclusion criteria have been met, the subject will 
be assigned to trial medication via the tele- randomization sy stem.  The investigative site will 
contact the tele -randomization sy stem (online or via a telephone call).  The site will enroll the 
subject into the tele- randomization sy stem by  indicating minimal information sufficient to 
distinguish one subject from another (eg, date of birth and initials).
Eligible subjects will be assigned toone of two dose groups by the investigative site ,
tofacit inib5mg BID or tofacitinib 10mg BID ,depending on their remission status at 
baseline in Study  A3921 139.
During a successful call, the tele- randomization sy stem will give the investigative site a code 
which corresponds to study  medication that has been p reviously shipped to the site and is in 
the site’s inventory  read y to be dispensed. This code corresponds to study  medication of th e 
dose group to which the subject has just been assigned .

enrolle d.
5.2.Breaking the Blind
This is an open -label study .  Assignment to tofacitinib will be open to the investigators, 
subjects and the Pfizer study  team.
5.3.Drug Supplies
5.3.1. Formulation and Packaging
Tofacitinib will be provided as 5mg tablets by the sponsor for oral administration .  Tablets 
will be supplied in bottles .  Sufficient study  medication will be dispensed at baseline (Visit 1) 
and a t each subsequent dispensing visit per the Schedule Of Ac tivities to complete dosing 
until the next scheduled dispensing visit.   The number of bottles dispensed will depend on 
whether the subject is taking 5 mg BID (1 bottle) or 10 mg BID (2bottles) ,and the duration 
between the next dispensing study  visit.
5.3.2. Preparation and Dispensing
Subjects will be dispensed tofacitinib 5 mg tablets in bottles as allocated b y the 
tele-randomization sy stem.  At e ach dispensing visit, sufficient study  medication of 
tofacitinib will be dispensed to complete dosing until the next scheduled visit.  The amount 
of study  medication dispensed must be recorded.  At each stud y visit the subject must return 
all tofacitinib c ontainers and an y unused medication will be recorded and documented to 
account for all dispensed study  medication. 
5.3.3. Administration
Tofacitinib will be self- administered .  If a subject is assigned to receive tofacitinib 5mg BID, 
they will be instructed to take 1 tablet in the morning and 1 tablet in the evening, 
approximately  12hours apart.  If a subject is assigned to receive tofacitinib 10mg BID, they  
will be instructed to take 2 tablets in the mor ning and 2 tablets in the evening, approximately  
12 hour s apart.  If a tofacitinib dose is missed and the interval to the next scheduled dose is 
less than 6 hours, the missed dose of tofacitinib should not be administered.  Tofacitinib may 
be taken with or without food.

Final Protocol Amendment 11, 18 June 2019
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 43when appropriate.  In the eve nt of medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified 
immediately .
Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product.
Poten tial medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in t he protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject.
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  an AE,asdetermined by  the 
investigator , the medication error is captured on the medication error version of the AE page
and, if applicable, an y associated AE(s) are captured on an AE CRF page .
5.3.4. Compliance
Investigational product compliance will be assessed by  the site at each study visit starting at 
the visit after the baselin e visit (Visit 2) up to the end of treatment.  Non-compliance is 
defined as taking less than 80% or more than 120% of study drug products as directed b y the 
dosing instructions . Subjects are to bring thestudy  drug bottle (s)with an y remaining stud y 
drug and an y empty  bottle(s) to each visit for review.  The investigator has the discretion to 
withdraw an y subject from the study  for reasons of non-compliance with the dosing regimen. 
Investigators should indicate on the appropriate CRF page noncompliance wi th study  
treatment and provide an explanation.  I nventory  control of all study  medications must be 
rigorousl y maintained throughout the duration of the study  until all medication has been 
accounted for and/or returned to the sponsor. Any discrepancies not ed between drug 
dispensing records and the drug inventory  must be reported to Pfizer.
5.4. Drug Storage and Drug Accountability
Tofacitinib must be stored at room temperature (15 -30C or 59-86F) in a locked area with 
restricted access.  Storage conditions stat ed in the SRSD , the I B, may be superseded b y the 
label storage.
Investigators and site staff are reminded to check temperatures dail y for business day s and 
ensure that thermometers are working correctl y as required for proper storage of 
investigational pro ducts.  These include thermometers for both the room storage and 
refrigerator storage.  An y temperature excursions should be reported immediately.  
The investigator or appropriate delegate at the site (e g,pharmacist), will ensure that all study  
drug is s tored in a secured area, under recommended storage condition, and in accordance 
with regulatory  requirements.

Page 44The investigator must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other 
disposition of the investigational product.  To ensur e adequate records, all drug supplies will 
be accounted for in the drug accountability  inventory  forms as instructed by  Pfizer and will 
be monitored by  counting of unused medications returned by  the subject at each visit from 
Visit 2 to the end of treatmen t.  All bottles used to distribute the drug supplies must be 
returned to the investigator by  the subject and the investigator will return the bottles to Pfizer.
At the end of trial, Pfizer will provide instructions as to the disposition of any  unused 
inves tigational product.  If Pfizer authorizes destruction at the trial site, the investigator must 
ensure that the materials are destro yed in compliance with applicable environmental 
regulations, institutional policy , and any  special instructions provided by  Pfizer.  Destruction 
must be adequatel y documented.
5.5.Concomitant Medications
All subjects will be questioned about concomitant medication use at each study  visit .  In 
addition the following concomitant medications that the subject had been taking from the 
study they  enrolled from (i e,Study  A3921096, Study  A3921094 or Study  A3921095) and 
will continue to take in this study will be recorded :

Page 45Oral Corticosteroids
Oral corticosteroid sareallowed for subjects entering Study  A3921139 on oral 
corticosteroids (maximum dose of 25 mg/day  of oral prednisone or equivalent) and 
tapering must commence starting the first week of the study .  
The daily  dose of oral prednisone or equivalent should be decreased at a rate of 5 mg 
per week until the dose reaches 20 mg/day , then reduce by  2.5mg to 5.0 mg weekl y 
until the dose reaches 0 mg.
For example only, if a subject is receiving oral prednisone 25 mg/day  at baseline, the 
subject’s corticosteroid tapering regimen could be as follows:
Baseline/Day  1:25 mg/day
Week 1 ( 2 day s):20 mg/day
Week 2 ( 2 day s):15 mg/day
Week 3 ( 2 day s):10 mg/day
Week 4 ( 2 day s):7.5 mg/day
Week 5 ( 2 day s):5.0 mg/day
Week 6 ( 2 day s):2.5 mg/day
Week 7 ( 2 day s):0 mg/day
Oral budesonide: t he daily  dose should be decreased at a rate of 3 mg every 3weeks 
until discontinuation.
For example only,if a subject is receiving oral b udesonide 9 mg/day  at baseline, 
the subject’s steroid tapering regimen could be as follows:
Week 1 –3 (Day 1 –Day 21): 6mg/day
Week 4 – 6 (D ay22 –Day 42): 3mg/day
Week 7 and bey ond (Day 43): 0mg/day
If a subject experiences worsening of UC s ymptom s during the cortico steroid taper or 
symptoms related to chronic corticosteroid therapy that in the opinion of the 
investigator are attributable to the corticosteroid taper, then the investigator may  
instruct the subject to revert back to the preceding dose in the taper schedule (i e,“step
up”).   The signs or s ymptoms leading to this change (e g,increased stool frequency , 
increased rectal bleeding) must be recorded on the CRF. Study  subjects with signs or

Page 46symptoms attributed to corticosteroid taper are per mitted to step up their 
corticosteroid dosage one time during participation in A3921139 and then resume 
corticosteroid taper to achieve steroid -free status.   
If a subject cannot tolerate tapering their corticosteroid dose below 10 mg/day, the 
subject is p ermitted to remain in the study  provided their dose does not exceed 
10mg/day .  However, efforts should be made to taper corticosteroids completely  off.
Re-initiation of oral cortico steroid therap y above 10 mg/day  of prednisone or 
equivalent for the treatm ent of UC ,after a subject has achieved steroid -free status 
during either Study  A3921096 or A3921139 ,will be considered rescue therapy  and 
the subject should be discontinued from the stud y.
Initiation of oral corticosteroids during Stud y A3921139 for the treatment of non- UC 
indications (eg, allergic reaction, asthma, etc) may be permitted and the sponsor 
should be notified.
Subjects receiving tofacitinib 10 mg BID and either concomitant combined hormonal 
contraceptives or hormone replacement therap y must have their tofacitinib dose reduced to 
5mg BID .
5.6.Prohibited Concomitant Medications
The following medications are prohibited throughout the study (see Appendix 2): 
Azathioprine, 6-m ercaptopurine and methotrexate ;
Cyclosporine, m ycophenolate mofetil/my cophenolic acid and tacrolimus;
Interferon;
Anti-TNF alpha therap y(eg, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, or certolizumab);
Intravenous and rectally  administered corticosteroids ;
Rectally  administered 5 -ASA ;
Natalizumab , vedolizum ab,or an y other anti -adhesion molecule therapy (including 
investigational agents) ;
Other investigational or marketed immunosuppressants or biologics with 
immunomodulatory properties;

5.7.Rescue Therapy
If a subject r equires initiation of a new therapy  for UC (including re -initiation of oral 
corticosteroid therapy  above 10 mg/day  of prednisone or equivalent after a subject has 
achieved steroid -free status during either Study  A3921096 or A3921139 ), the subject should 
bewithdrawn from the study  and appropriate agents should be given at the discretion of the 
investigator.  If a subject discontinues the use of background oral 5 -ASA or sulfasalazine 
during the study  and/orhas the therap y re-initiated, this will not constit ute rescue therapy , 
and the subject will be permitted to remain in the study .
5.8.Tofacitinib Dose Adjustment Guidelines
The maximum tofacitinib dose allowed in this study  is 10 mg BID.  Tofacitinib dose 
adjustments (increase or decrease) can onl y occur after a subject has received at least 
8weeks of treatment in Study  A3921139. 
If a subject receiving tofacitinib 5mg BID experiences loss of response , defined by  an
increase in partial May o score of at least 2 points from baseline in the maintenance study  
(A39 21096) for two consecutive visits (at least 2 weeks apart), accompanied by  an increase
inrectal bleeding subscore byat least 1 point from baseline of the maintenance study  
(A3921 096), then the subject could be scheduled for endoscop y to determine if the subject is 
experiencing a flare.   Flare is defined b y an increase in May o score of at least 3 points from 
baseline value of the maintenance stud y(A3921096) , accompanied b y an increase in rectal 
bleeding subscore b y at least 1 point, and an increase of end oscopic subscore of at least 
1point (unless the endoscopic subscore was a ‘3’ at baseline and remains a ‘3’), after a 
minimum of 8 weeks of treatment in Study  A3921139.   Once the subject is confirmed to 
meet the definition for flare , documented by  site re ad endoscop y, the investigator may  
increase the tofacitinib dose from 5 mg BID to 10 mg BID provided that the subject does not 
have an y of the risk factors for pulmonary  embolism.
Subjects receiving tofacitinib 5 mg BID who develop one or more of the risk factors for 
pulmonary  embolism during the study  will not be permitted to increase their dose to 
tofacitinib 10 mg BID .
Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) toxin testing is recommended for subjects in whom
C.difficile infection is suspected (eg, atypical symptoms or features of their usual UC 
disease course, significantly  worsening disease activity  assessments from the previous visit, 
and/or the presence of risk factors such as recent antibiotic use or a recent history  of 
C.difficile infection ).  A full c ourse of C. difficile treatment, as defined by local practice ,
must be given to subjects with C. difficile infection to permit their continued participation in 
the study .  Subject swith C. difficile infection that meets serious infection criteria must be 
withdrawn from the study . Stool testing and treatment for other enteric pathogens is at the 
discretion of the investigator.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 48Forsubject s receiving tofacitinib 10mg BID ,the tofacitinib dose may  be adjusted to 5 mg 
BID if the subject meets any  of the following laboratory  criteria after they  are repeated and 
confirmed within approximately  7days:
Any single hemoglobin value that drops >2 g/dL (>20 g/L) below baseline of Study  
A3921139.
Absolute neutrophil count <1.2 x 109/L (<1200/mm3).
Absolute ly mphocy te count <0. 75 x 109/L (<750/mm3).
Platelet count <100 x 109/L (<100,000/mm3).
In addition, for subjects receiving tofacitinib 10 mg BID, the tofacitinib dose may  be adjusted 
to 5mg BID if the subject is in remission (based on May o score) or in PMS remission at 
Month 24 or any  visit bey ond Month 24, after discussion with the sponsor.  PMS remission is 
defined as a partial May o score 2 with no individual subscore >1.  If a subject experiences 
loss of response and flare after the dose reduction from 10 mg BID t o 5mg BID ,the dose 
may be increased back to 10 mg BID.  In this situation, loss of response is defined as an 
increase in partial May o score of at least 2 points from the time when the subject was in 
remission or PMS remission (i e,when the dose was reduc ed to 5 mg BID) for two 
consecutive visits (at least 2 weeks apart), accompanied by  an increase inrectal bleeding
subscore byat least 1 point from when the subje ct was in remission or PMS remission .  If 
response is lost, endoscopy  should be performed to determine if the subject is experiencing a 
flare.  Flare , in this situation, is defined by  an increase in May o score of at least 3 points from 
the time when the subject was in remission or PMS remission , accompanied by  an increase in 
rectal bleeding subsco re by  at least 1 point, and an increase of endoscopic subscore of at least 
1point (unless the endoscopic subscore was a ‘3’ and remains a ‘3’).
Lastl y, subjects receiving tofacitinib 10 mg BID and who are identified to have one or more 
of the risk factors for pulmonary embolism will need to reduce their tofacitinib dose to 
5mgBID.
Tofacitinib dose adjustments should be implemented at a scheduled study  visit , unplanned 
study  visit, or upon verification of laboratory  abnormalities upon repeat testing .  Subjects
who meet the laboratory  discontinuation criteria described in Appendix 3will be withdrawn 
from the study .
5.9.Tofacitinib Temporary With holding
If the investigator deems it necessary  to withhold tofacitinib to treat a non- serious infection 
or other medical condition, temporary  withholding is permitted for up to 5 days.  If study  
drug interruption exceeding 5 days isrequired for a medical reason, the investigator must 
contact the sponsor for approval.

6.1.Study Pe riod
6.1.1. Baseline (Visit 1)
The baseline visit will occur on the same day  as either the Week 9 visit for those subjects 
enrolling from Study  A3921094 or A3921095, or the same day  as the Week 53visit or the 
early termination visit for those subjects enrolling from Study  A3921096.
Subject’s eligibility  into the study  will be evaluated at Baseline of Study  A3921139 based on 
remission status, AEs, phy sical examination, ECG (read by study  site),and all 
inclusion /exclusion criteria.
For eligible subjects from Study A3921096, all relevant study  information recorded on CRFs 
at Week 52/53or the early  termination visit of Study  A3921096 will be used as baseline data 
forStudy  A3921139.  For eligible subjects from Study  A3921094 or Study  A3921095, all 
relevant stud y information recorded on CRFs at Week 8 /9of Study  A3921094 or A3921095 
will be used as baseline data for Study  A3921139.
To prepare for stud y participation, subjects will be instructed to continue to follow the L ife 
Style Guidelines (seeSection 4.4)and Concomitant Medications (see Section 5.5)as they  did 
in their previous study .
The study  investigator or appropriate delegate at the site will discuss with each subject the 
nature of the stud y, its requirements, risks and its restrictions.  Written informed consent 
must be obtained prior to performing an y protocol -specific procedures.
The following procedures will be recorded:
Informed consent.
Complete medical history.  Medical history  from either the induction studies

6.3.Subject Withdrawal
Should a subject withdraw from active treatment, the subject should complete the procedures 
listed at the Month 12/ET Visit .  After completing the procedures for the early  withdrawal 
visit, the subject should return for a safet y evaluation to occur approximately  4weeks afte r 
discontinuing study  medication as per the f ollow -up visit.
Subjects will be withdrawn from the stud y if an y of the following occurs during the study  
treatment period:
If a subject who enrolled from the induction studies A3921094 or A3921095 
(ie,non-responders) fails to demonstrate clinical response at Month 2.  Clinical 
response is defined b ya decrease from the induction study  baseline (A3921094 or 
A3921095) May o score of at least 3 points and at least 30%, with an accompany ing 
decrease in the rectal bl eeding subscore of at least 1 point or an absolute rectal 
bleeding subscore of 0 or 1.  The endoscopic subscore based on central reading will 
be used to assess clinical response.
If rescue therapy  is initiated for UC with the exception of oral 5 -ASA or 
sulfasalazine.  Rescue therapy  includes re-initiation of oral corticosteroid therap y 
above 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent after a subject has achieved steroid -free 
status during either Study A3921096 or A3921139.
If asubject undergoes surgery  for UC .
If a subject remains on oral corticosteroids exceeding 15mg/day of prednisone or 
equivalent after Month 3.
A subject may  be withdrawn from the stud y for any of the safet y concerns as listed in 
Appendix 3.
Subjects who develop a serious infection during the study , defined as any  infection (viral, 
bacterial, and fungal) requiring hospitalization or parenteral antimicrobials or being classified 
as a serious adverse event should be withdrawn from the study (seeSection 7.3.10 ).
All abnormal laboratory events of clinical significance should be followed until the 
laboratory  values have returned to normal or baseline levels (see Appendix 3).  Subjects who 
meet the discontinuation criteria described in Appendix 3will be withdrawn from the study.

Final Protocol Amendment 11, 18 June 2019
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 60If a subject has an y clinically significant, stud y-related abnormalities at the conclusion of the 
study , the Pfizer medica l monitor (or designated representative) should be notified and every  
effort should be made to arrange follow- up evaluations at appropriate intervals to document 
the course of the abnormalities.
The reason for a subject discontinuing from the study  will be recorded in the Case Report 
Form (CRF) .  A discontinuation occurs when a subject ceases participation in the study , 
regardless of the circumstances, prior to completion of the protocol.  The investigator must 
determine the primary  reason for discontinuati on.  Withdrawal due to adverse event should 
be distinguished from withdrawal due to insufficient response.  The early  withdrawal
evaluation required b y the protocol (see Month 12/ET visit procedures) will be performed at 
the time of study  discontinuation , or as soon as possible thereafter .  The investigator will 
record the reason for study  discontinuation, provide or arrange for appropriate follow -up (if 
required) for each such subject, and document the course of the subject’s condition.
Subjects may  withdr aw from the study  at any  time at their own request, or they may be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety orbehavioral 
reasons , or the inability  of the subject to compl y with the protocol required schedule of stu dy 
visits or procedures at a given stud y site.   If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, 
every  effort should be made to contact the subject.  I n any  circumstance, every  effort should 
be made to document subject outcome, if possible.  The investigator should inquire about the 
reason for withdrawal, request the subject to return all unused investigational product(s), 
request the subject to return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow -up with the subject 
regarding an y unresolved adverse event s(AEs) .
In accordance with due diligence requirements, if a subject fails to return for scheduled 
visit(s), the site shall record information concerning attempts to contact the subject in the 
subject source documents, including method of contact (e g,letter, phone call) and date of 
each attempted contact.  It is recommended that the investigational site makes two phone 
calls to the subject who missed the visit, documenting each call in the source documents.  A 
third contact attempt is a certified letter to the subject, and this letter and the response 
received become part of the source documents.  When a site has made at least 3 attempts to 
contact the subject, the subject is considered lost to follow up (LTFU).   Subject’s status shall 
be designated LTFU in the CRF and in the study  monitoring report.
If the subject withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be 
collected.  The sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.
7.ASSESSMENTS
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. However it is anticipated that from time to time there may be 
circumstances, outside of the control of the investigator, that may  make it unfeasible to 
perform the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the 
safet y and well-being of the subject. When a protocol re quired test cannot be performed the

which he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.
The study  team will be informed of thes e incidents in a timely  fashion.
7.1.Ulcerative Colitis Assessments
7.1.1. Subject Bowel Movement Diary
Subjects will use a phone -based interactive voice recording s ystem(IVRS) tool to record 
their bowel movement data throughout the stud y.  Subjects will be instruct ed in its use at the 
Baseline visit.  This information should be entered daily  approximately  7daysprior to their 
study  visit AND an y time during the study that the subject experiences a worsening of UC 
symptoms.  A utomatic reminder s will be sent to the subject before their scheduled visit to 
remind them to record their bowel movement data.  Also, as an additional reminder the site 
personnel will call the subject 7 days before their next scheduled visit to prompt them to 
complete their stool data in the phone- based tool.
The phone- based IVRS tool will be provided at baseline for subjects to record the following 
information during the study :
‘Normal’ number of stools per day  (when not having a flare and will only be asked at 
baseline of induction study ).
Num ber of toilet visits for bowel movements (per day ).
Presence of blood in the stools (if any ).
Description of blood in the stools (if an y).
7.1.2. Partial Mayo Score
A partial May o score (PMS) is an instrument designed to measure disease activity  of 
ulcerative col itiswithout endoscop y.  Partial May o score ranges from 0 to 9 points.  I t 
consists of 3 subscores, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe 
disease .
stool frequency  (0-3);
rectal bleeding (0 -3);
physician global assessment (PGA) ( 0-3).
The partial Mayo score (PMS) will be assessed prior to the administration of study  
medication at each specified study  visit (seeSchedule Of Activities ).  Partial May o score of 
2or less with no individual subscore >1, is defined as PMS remission, and reduction of PMS 
of 2 or greater from baseline is defined as PMS response.  
CP-690,550
A3921139
Final Protocol Amendment 11, 18 June 2019
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 62The PMS will be calculated based on the subject’s diary data recorded over the 3 prior 
consecutive day s.  The phy sician’s global assessment (PGA) acknowledges the three other
criteria, the patient’s recollection of abdominal discomfort andgeneral sense of wellbeing, 
and other observations, such as ph ysical findings and the patient’s performance sta tus.
7.1.3. Mayo Score
The Mayo score is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of ulcerative colitis.  
Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12 points. It consists of 4 subscores, each graded from 0 to 3 
with higher scores indicating more severe disease (see Appendix 1).
Stool frequency  (0-3).
Rectal bleeding (0 -3).
Findings of flexible sigmoidoscopy  (0-3).
Physician global assessment (PGA) (0 -3).
Mayo score is assessed at Month 2, at the following annual study  visits (Months 12, 24 and 
36),and at the earl y withdrawal/earl y termination visit per the Schedule Of Activities.
The endoscopic finding at Month 2 will be read b y both central reader and site investigators 
prior to Amendment 8.  The endoscopic subscore read b y central reader will be used to 
calculate the May o score at Month 2 and determine clinical response until implementation of 
Amendment 8.  After implementation of Amendment 8, Month 2 endoscopic subscore will 
be local ly read b y study site investigator.  The endoscopic subscore at all other applicable 
visits will be read by  study  site investigator before and after Amendment 8.
Calculation of the May o score requires an assessment of the subject’s stool frequency  and 
quantification of the amount of blood in the stool.  The subject will use the phone- based 
IVRS tool to record this information .Mayo score will be calculated based on the subject’s 
BM diary data recorded over the 3 prior consecutive day s.
The mucosal appeara nce during the sigmoidoscopic portion of endoscopic examination will 
be assessed for the May o endoscopic subscore, based on the scoring s ystem provided in the 
protocol (see Appendix 1).
The PGA acknow ledges the three other cri teria, the patient’s recollection of abdominal 
discomfort and general sense of wellbeing, and other observations, such as phy sical findings 
and the patient’s performance status.   The endoscopic subs core and the PGA must be 
performed b y a physician qualifie d to perform endoscopy , and it is recommended that the 
same phy sician performs all such assessments for a particular subject throughout the study , 
when possible.

Page 637.2. Patient Reported Outcomes
Paper diary will be used to record various patient reported outcomes (PRO) assessments 
during the study.  PRO assessments collected during the study will be presented in separate tables, figures, and data listings, and will be reviewed in the final study report. 
It is important to note that the PRO measurements are collected and evaluated in a different 
manner than the observed or volunteered adverse events.  Given these differences, no attempt will be made to resolve any apparent discrepancies between observed or volunteered adverse events and PRO data collected from subjects.  Adverse event incidence rates will not be calculated from these solicited data but rather from the information recorded on the AE pages on the CRF.
 
 
 
To be completed during study visits:
The following PROs will be completed as specified in the Schedule Of Activities .  Subjects 
should be encouraged to complete the PROs at the clinic at the beginning of the study visitprior to any clinical assessments.  A member of the staff should be available if a subject requires further instruction and to review the PRO questionnaires for completeness prior to leaving the clinic.
•Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) (see Appendix 9 ).
 
7.2.1. Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ)
IBDQ Questionnaire is a psychometrically validated PRO instrument for measuring the 
disease-specific quality of life in subjects with Inflammatory Bowel Disease, including ulcerative colitis.  The IBDQ comprises 32-items, which are grouped into 4 dimensions: bowel function, emotional status, systemic symptoms and social function.

•Emotional function: 12 to 84.
•Social function: 5 to 35.
The total IBDQ score ranges from 32 to 224.  For the total score and each domain, a higher 
score indicates better quality of life.  A score of ≥170 corresponds to clinical remission and 
an increase of at least 16 points is considered to indicate a clinically meaningful improvement.

Page 657.3. Safety
Safety will be assessed by vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs, clinical laboratory tests 
and the spontaneous reporting of AEs, in all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication.  Unscheduled safety assessments may be performed at any time during the study to assess any perceived safety concerns.  Investigators and Pfizer Clinicians will review individual subject data throughout the conduct of the study to ensure subjects’ well-being.Subject safety monitoring and discontinuation guidelines are provided in Appendix 3 .
7.3.1. Vital Signs
As a guideline, blood pressure should be measured in the subject’s dominant arm and 
recorded to the nearest mmHg. The same arm should be used throughout the study, when possible. All blood pressure in this study should be measured with the subject in the sitting position after resting for at least 5 minutes, when possible.
The use of automated devices for measuring blood pressure and pulse rate are acceptable, 
although, when done manually, pulse rate will be measured in the brachial/radial artery for at least 30 seconds. When the timing of these measurements coincides with a blood collection, blood pressure and pulse rate should be obtained first.
Temperature will be collected as either oral, axillary or tympanic temperature, but the same 
method should be used throughout the study.
7.3.2. Physical Examinations
A complete physical examination will be performed at each specified visit according to the
Schedule Of Activities .  The following parameters and body systems will be examined and 
any abnormalities described: weight, general appearance, head, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, 
throat, thyroid, skin (presence of rash), lungs (auscultation), heart (auscultation for presence of murmurs, gallops, rubs, peripheral edema), abdominal (palpation and auscultation), perianal, musculoskeletal, extremities, neurologic (mental status, gait, reflexes, motor and sensory function, coordination) and lymph nodes.
Targeted physical examination will be performed at each specified visit according to the
Schedule Of Activities .  The following will be assessed: weight, general appearance, eyes, 
mouth, lungs, heart, abdomen, musculoskeletal, extremities, skin and lymph nodes.CCI

The ECG results from Week 8 of Study  A3921094 or A3921095, or from Week 52or the 
early termination visit of Study  A3921096 will be used to evaluate subjec t’seligibility  for 
Study  A3921139 and serve as the baseline for Study  A3921139.  The ECG results should be 
maintained in the sub ject’s source documentation .ECG data will be submitted to a central 
laboratory  for measurement through Month 36and at earl y termination.  Any  clinically  
significant changes from the baseline ECG should be recorded as AEs and evaluated further, 
as clinic ally warranted.
The list of ECG values of potential clinical concern is listed in Appendix 4.
7.3.5. Clinical Laboratory Tests
Blood and urine samples will be collected at each specified visit according to the Schedule 
Of Activities.  Unscheduled clinical labs may  be obtained at an y time during the stud y to 
assess an y perceived safety  concerns or in accordance with the guidelines for subject safety  
monitoring and discontinuati on (see Appendix 3).  Clinically  significant abnormal findings 
should be recorded as AEs per Section 8.4.

Study A3921288.
Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as AEs if they meet any of the 
following criteria:
•Test result is associated with accompanying symptom, and/or
•Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or
•Test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy, and/or
•Test result is considered to be an adverse event by the Investigator or sponsor.
Abnormal test results determined to be caused from laboratory error should not be reported 
as AEs.  Clinically significant laboratory findings at the final assessment should be followed to resolution or until determined by the Investigator to be stabilized.  Repeat tests may be indicated.
7.3.6. Annual Tuberculosis Testing
Annual tuberculosis (TB) testing will be conducted using Quantiferon-TB
®Gold Plus test 
(QFT) for subjects in those countries in which TB prevalence has been reported at a rate of 
>50 cases per 100,000 persons (eg, Brazil, Latvia, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, South Africa, and South Korea, based on World Health Organization, 2015 http://www.who.int/tb/country/data/profiles/en/index.html).  All subjects with positive results must have a chest radiograph performed and the radiograph must be negative for active TB infection for the subject to continue study participation.  Subjects identified as having latent TB (positive QFT and negative chest radiograph for active TB) should be treated appropriately; for subjects remaining on study during their treatment, the only acceptable regimen is 9 months of isoniazid. Subjects can continue to take tofacitinib without interruption while receiving treatment for latent TB.  Note: QFT should not be performed in subjects who had a positive result during prior testing (screening visit in Study A3921094 or A3921095 or prior annual visits) and/or previously received adequate treatment for TB.
7.3.7. Pregnancy Testing
For female subjects of childbearing potential, a urine β-hCG pregnancy test, with sensitivity 
of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed at baseline (Visit 1), before investigational product 
administration.  A negative urine β-hCG test result is required before the subject may receive 
the investigational product.  Urine β-hCG tests will also be done whenever one menstrual 
cycle is missed during the active treatment period (or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected), repeated at all study visits and at the end of the study to confirm the subject has C

Page 69not become pregnant during the study.  Pregnancy tests may also be repeated as per request 
of IRB/IECs or if required by local regulations.
If at any point there is a case of a positive urine β-hCG test, the subject will have study drug 
interrupted and a serum sample submitted to the central laboratory for β-hCG testing.  If the 
serum test confirms positive, the subject will be withdrawn from the study and all the necessary follow up will be conducted as per Section 8.9 .  If the serum test is negative, the 
subject may resume study drug.  It is essential to make sure that female study subjects use acceptable birth control (see Section 4.4.5.2 and ) from 
the time of the first dose of study medication until completion of follow-up procedures.
In Austria, if the interval between study visits exceeds one month, female subjects of 
childbearing potential should have a pregnancy test performed each month between study visits and results reported to the investigational site to be entered into the subject’s study record.
7.3.8. Serum Lipids
Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, direct HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides will be 
measured during the study at specific study visits according to the Schedule Of Activities
requiring subjects to fast at least 9 hours prior to sample collection.  See Appendix 8 for 
recommended clinical management of cholesterol.
7.3.9. Creatinine Clearance
A commonly used surrogate marker for actual creatinine clearance is the Cockcroft-Gault 
formula (see Appendix 5 ), which employs creatinine measurements and a subject’s weight to 
calculate the clearance. Cockcroft-Gault GFR calculation will be done as part of clinical laboratory tests from baseline (Visit 1) through follow-up.
7.3.10. Infections
Subjects will be monitored for development of infection. Infections will be classified as 
either treated or non-treated infections. All treated infections occurring during the study should be cultured if feasible and the results (eg, any identified organisms or absence of growth) recorded in the CRF.
Treated infections are infections that:
•Require antimicrobial therapy by any route of administration or;
•Require any surgical intervention (eg, incision and drainage).
Treated infections will be further classified as serious or non-serious. Serious infections are 
treated infections that:
•Require parenteral antimicrobial therapy or;
•Require hospitalization for treatment or;CCI

Final Protocol Amendment 11, 18 June 2019
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 70Meet other criteria that require the infection to be classified as a serious adverse event 
(SAE).
A subject who experiences a serious infection should be discontinued from the study .  A 
serious infection should be reported as a SAE and should be list ed as the reason for 
discontinuation in the CRF. All serious infections occurring during the study  should undergo 
appropriate laboratory  investigations, including culture, and the results (eg, any  identified 
organisms or absence of growth) recorded in the CRF.
Subjects who experience non- serious infections that require treatment may  have their study  
drug temporaril y discontinued during treatment (seeSection 5.9).  Temporary  
discontinuation of study  drug should be recorded in the CRF.
Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) toxin testing is recommended for subjects in whom
C.difficile infection is suspected (eg, atypical symptoms or features of their usual UC 
disease course, significantly  worseni ng disease activity  assessments from the previous visit, 
and/or the presence of risk factors such as recent antibiotic use or a recent history  of 
C.difficile infection ).  A full course of C. difficile treatment, as defined by local practice ,
must be given to subjects with C. difficile infection to permit their continued participation in 
the study .  Subject swith C. difficile infection that meets serious infection criteria must be 
withdrawn from the study. Stool testing and treatment for other enteric path ogens is at the 
discretion of the investigator.
7.3.11. Cardiovascular ,and Malignancy, and Other Safety Events of Interest
The identification of a cardiovascular ,malignancy , or other safet yevent s of interest canbe 
identified by the study  site and communicated to Pfizer or designee. These safet y events may  
also be identified b y the Pfizer Study  Team or designee during the review of subject data 
listings or by  site monitors during routine monitoring of subject study  records.
Criteria for defining specific cardio vascular, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular events 
will be provided to investigators in a separate study  manual.  The Pfizer Study  Team or 
designee will provide a listing of specific documents needed to support cardiovascular event 
adjudication by  the Cardiovascular Event Adjudication Committee (CV -EAC; see
Section 9.7 ).  Cardiova scular event documentation will include, but is not limited to any  of 
the following: hospital discharge summar ies, operative reports, clinic notes, ECGs, 
diagnostic enz ymes, results of other diagnostic tests, autopsy  reports and death certificate 
information.
When there is a decision to biopsy  a potentiall y malignant tumour, l ymph node, or other 
tissue, the invest igator and/or consultant(s) should contact Pfizer or designee to discuss the 
issue and an y decisions as soon as possible.  For all biopsies of potentially  malignant 
tumours, suspicious ly mphadenopathy , or possible extranodal ly mphoproliferative disorder 
(LPD), the study  site wil l request the pathologist to send the original slides used to make the 
definitive diagnosis, ancillary  study  reports, and the pathologist’s report to the central 
laboratory  for a blinded review by  a central pathologist.  See Appendix 6for the steps to take 
in the event of potentially  malignant tumours, l ymphadenopath y or possible extra -nodal L PD

gastrointestinal tract biopsies are obtained.
7.3.12. Risk Factor Check for Pulmonary Embolism
All subjects will undergo a risk factor check at each study  visit to check for newly -developed 
risk factors for pulmonary embolism.   This information is to be captured in the subject’s 
source file and on the relevant case report form.   
A subject may  be at high risk for pulmonary  embolism if he/she:
has heart failure ;
has inherited coagulation disorders;
has had venous thromboembolism, either deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary  
embolism ;
is taking combined hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy ;
has malignancy (association is strongest with cancers other than non- melanoma skin 
cancers) ;
is undergoing major surgery .
If asubject has a ny of the risk factors listed above and is receiving tofacitinib 10 mg BID, the 
subject’s tofacitinib dose should be reduced to 5 mg BID.  If a subject has any  
newly -developed risk factors for pulmonary embolism identified during the study , they  will 
not b e permitted to receive tofacitinib 10 mg BID.
Lastl y, if a subject has any of the risk factors listed above, the subject will not be eligible to 
enroll in Study  A3921288.   
8.ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
8.1.Adverse Events
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless o f treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following 
sections. 
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine 
the outcome of the AEand to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a nSAE
requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated representative.  For all AEs, 
sufficient information should be obtained b y the investigator to determine the causalit y ofthe 
AE.  The investigator is required to assess causality .  Follow -up by  the investigator may be 
required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the 
investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.

Final Protocol Amendment 11, 18 June 2019
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 72As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the Sponsor, an y non -serious adverse event 
that is determined b y the Sponsor to be serious will be reported b y the Sponsor as a n SAE .  
To assist in the determination of case seriousness further information may  be requeste d from 
the investigator to provide clarit y and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study .  
8.2.Reporting Period
For SAE s, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from 
the time that the subject provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the subject’s 
participation in the study , ie, prior to undergoing any  study -related procedure and/or 
receiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar day safter the last 
administration of the investigational product.  SAEs occurring to a subject after the active 
reporting period has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes 
aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a 
reasona ble possibility  of being related to investigational product are to be reported to the 
sponsor.
AEs (serious and non -serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the 
subject has taken at least 1dose of investigational product through thesubject ’slast
visit.   
8.3.Definition of an Adverse Event
An AEis an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
product or medical device; the event need not necessarily  have a causal relationship with the 
treatment or usage.  Exa mples of AEs include but are not limited to:  
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in ph ysical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progression/worsening of underl ying disease ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Addition ally, they  may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
CP-690,550

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 73Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy (EDP) ;
Exposure via breastfeeding ;
Medication err or;
Occupational exposure.
8.4.Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an AEare as follows: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms, and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgic al intervention, 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in stud y dosing , outside of those permitted b y the 
protocol, or discontinuation from the study, si gnificant additional concomitant drug 
treatment, or other therapy, and/or
Test result is considered to b e an AEby the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
reporting as an AE.
8.5. Serious Ad verse Events
Aserious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 74Medical and scientific judgment isexercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospitalization.  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
8.5.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events 
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study .  All SAEs will be reported by  the 
investigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safet y 
database (see the section on Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements).
8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury 
Abnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
levels concurrent wi th abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria 
outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury  are considered potential cases of 
drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy ’s law cases) and should alway s be considered 
impo rtant medical events.  
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug -induced liver injury  
depends on the subject ’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions. Subjects who 
present with the following laboratory  abnormalit ies should be evaluated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory values:
Subjects with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range
who subsequently  present with AST or AL Tvalues 3times the uppe r limit of 
normal ( ×ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin 2 ×ULN with no evidence of 
hemoly sis and an alkaline phosphatase 2 ×ULN or not available.
For subjects with preexisting ALT ORAST OR total bilirubin values above the 
upper limit of normal, th e following threshold values should be used in the definition 
mentioned above:
For s ubjects with pre -existing AST or ALT baseline values above the normal 
range :AST or ALT values 2times the baseline values and 3 ×ULN, or 
8 ×ULN (whichever is smaller) .

A3921139
Final Protocol Amendment 11, 18 June 2019
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 75Concurrent with
For subjects with pre -existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: 
Total bilirubin level increased from baseline by  an amount of at least 1 time the 
upper limit of normal orif the value reaches 3times the upper limit of n ormal 
(whichever is smaller).
The subject should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should 
include laboratory  tests, detailed history  and ph ysical assessment .
In addition to repeating measurements AST and ALT, laboratory  tests should include 
albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutamy l 
transferase, prothrombin time (PT )/international normaliz ed ratio ( INR), and alkaline 
phosphatase.  A detailed history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, 
acetaminophen , recreational drug and supplement consumption, family  history , occupational 
exposure, sexual history , travel history , history  of contact with a jaundiced person , surgery , 
blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected. 
Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (e g,biliary  tract) 
may be warra nted. All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria 
defined above , with no other cause for liver function tests ( LFT)abnormalities identified at 
the time should be considered potential Hy’s lawcases irrespective of availabilit y of all the 
results of the investigations performed to determine etiology  of the abnormal LFTs. Such 
potential Hy ’s law cases should be reported as SAEs .
8.6.Hospitalization
Hospitalization is defined as an y initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a h ospital or 
equivalent healthcare facility  or any  prolongation of an existing admission.  Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit ( eg,from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).  An emergency  room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization; 
however, the event leading to the emergency  room visit should be assessed for medical 
importance.
Hospitalization does not inclu de the following:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospice facilities;
Respite care (e g,caregiver relief);
Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing homes;
CP-690,550
A3921139
Final Protocol Amendment 11, 18 June 2019
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 76Same day  surgeries (as outpatient/same day /ambulatory  procedures).
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitali zation in the absence of a precipitating, clinical 
AEis not in itself a nSAE .  Examples include: 
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AEor with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for 
work -up of persistent pre- treatment lab oratory abnormality );
Social admission (e g,subject has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (e g,for yearly physical exam ination );
Protocol -specified admission during a stud y (eg,for a procedure required by  the study  
protocol);
Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE(eg,for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;
Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject.
Diagnostic and therapeutic non -invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as AEs .  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis 
that begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting 
appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the AE.
8.7.Severity Assessm ent
If required on the AEcase report forms (CRFs) , the investigator will use the adjectives 
MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the AE.  For 
purposes of consistency , these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function.
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe e vent is not 
necessarily  an SAE .  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
thesubject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAE s, listed above.
CP-690,550
A3921139
Final Protocol Amendment 11, 18 June 2019
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 778.8.Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-
serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, and 
report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting req uirements if 
applicable.  An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an 
AE; generally  the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be 
provided.  If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused 
the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting 
purposes, as defined b y the Sponsor ( see the Section on Reporting Requirements ).  If the 
investigator's causalit y assessment is "unknown but not related to investigational product", 
this should be clearl y documented on study records.  
In addition, if the investig ator determines a nSAE is associated with study  procedures, the 
investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicabl e.
8.9.Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  occurs if:
1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment o r environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/ or 
being exposed to the investigational product;
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct conta ct with 
a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has 
been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
2. A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to 
the investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy .
If astudy  subject or study  subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study  subject’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this 
information to thePfizer drug safet y unit on an SAE report formand an EDP supplemental 
form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred .  In addition, the investigator must submit 
information regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer pro duct in a pregnant woman (eg, a 
subject reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by  inhalation 
or spillage) using the EDP supplemental form .  This must be done irrespective of whether an 
AEhas occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure. The information 
submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for information related 
to termination of pregnancy ).
CP-690,550
A3921139
Final Protocol Amendment 11, 18 June 2019
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 78Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome f or 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up 
to the initial EDP supplemental form .  In the case of a live birth, th e structural integrity  of the 
neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for 
termination should be specified and, if clinicall y possible, the structural integrit y of the 
terminated fetus should be assessed b y gross visual inspection (unless pre -procedure test 
findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine f etile demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly  [in a 
live born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outc omes that are reported as SAE s follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion ;
Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard 
to causality , as SAE s.  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as 
SAE s when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly  related to 
exposure to investigational product.
Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by  the investigator.  Further 
follow -up of birth out comes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s).In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the study  subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information 
Form to deliver to his partner. The Investigator must document in the source documents that 
the subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his 
partner.
8.10. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the per formance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the 
product, which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safet y unit within 2 4hours of the 
investigator’s awareness, using the SAE report form, regardless of whether there is an 
associated AE/SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , 
the information is not reported on a CRF; however, a copy  of the completed SAE report form 
is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See Alsothe Section on Subject Withdrawal )
Withdrawal due to AEsshould be distinguished from withdrawal due to other c auses, 
according to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AECRF 
page.

8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  reported b y 
the study  subject.  In addition, each study  subject will be questioned about AEs.
8.13. Reporting Requirements
Each AEis to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAE s.  If a nSAE occurs, 
expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.
8.13.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If anSAE occurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24 hours of investigator awareness of the 
event.  In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, notification to Pfizer must be 
made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available AEinformation.  This timeframe 
also applies to additional new information (follow -up) o n previousl y forwarded SAE reports 
as well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of EDP, exposure via breastfeeding, and 
occupational exposure cases . 
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a nSAE
immediately (eg, if an outpatient study  subject initially  seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time 
of his/her first awareness of the AE .
For all SAE s, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to Pfizer in 
accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an investigator 
may be requested by  Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow -up information in an 
expedited fashion.  This i nforma tioncollected for SAE sismore detailed than that captured 
on the AE CRF .  In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of 
possible causalit y.  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant 
medications, vaccines, and/orillnesses must be provided.  I n the case of a subject death, a
summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its 
designated representative. 
8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF.  I t should be noted that the form for 
collection of SAE information is not the same as the AECRF.  Where the same data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE
term should be used on both forms.  AEs should be reported using concise medical 
terminology  on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information.
8.13.3. Sponsor ’sReporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
Adverse event reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be 
carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.

Page 809. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed m ethodology  for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this study  
will be documented in a Statistical Analy sis Plan, which will be maintained by  the sponsor.  
This document may  modify  the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any  major
modifications of the primary  endpoint definition and/or its analy sis will also be reflected in a 
protocol amendment.
9.1.Sample Size Determination
Approximately  900subjects are expected to become eligible for the study .  Approximately  
460subjects are expected to enroll from the maintenance Study  A3921096 assuming a 
78%rollover rate from the maintenance study .  Approximately  440subjects are expected to 
enroll from the induction Study  A3921094 or A3921095 assuming that 38% of subjects 
enrolled in those studi es will not achieve clinical response and will not have improving 
endoscopic subscores after completing induction Study  A3921094 or A3921095.
9.2.Efficacy Analysis
The primary  analysis population will be the Full Analy sis Set (FAS) defined as all subjects 
who receive at l east 1 dose of study  medication .
9.2.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint
The primary  objective is to assess the safet y and tolerability  of long-term tofacitinib therap y.  
There will be no primary efficacy  endpoint.
9.2.2. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
Due to the design of the study , there will be no formal hy pothesis testing. Descriptive 
summary  statistics such as number, percentage for categorical endpoints and mean, standard
deviation, median for continuous endpoints will be summarized by  the following four
subgroups of subjects based on the status at baseline of Study  A3921139: 1) in remission 
defined b y a total May o score 2 with no individual subscore >1, and rectal bleeding 
subscore of 0 , 2) treatment failure defined b y an increase in May o score of at le ast 3 points 
from baseline value of the maintenance study (A3921096) , accompanied by  an increase in 
rectal bleeding subscore by  at least 1 point, and an increase of endoscopic subscore of at least 
1point (yielding an absolute endoscopic subscore of  2), 3) all other subjects from 
maintenance stud y A3921096 neither in remission nor fulfilling the definition of treatment 
failure, and 4) non -responders from induction studies A3921094 or A3921095 .
9.3.Analysis of Health Outcome Assessments
These endpoints will be analy zed using the same approach as the secondary endpoints.
9.4.Safety Analysis
The safet y data will be summarized in accordance with Pfizer Data Standards based on the 
safet y analy sis set defined as all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study  medicatio n.

Page 819.5. Interim Analysis
As this is an open- label and uncontrolled study ,interim anal yses may  be performed for study  
monitoring for internal decision making, application for approval or due to regulatory
requests. There are no issues of protecting the Type I error rate as no h ypothesis testing will 
be conducted.  
9.6.Data Monitoring Committee
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), a group of experts external to 
Pfizer, will review accumulating safety  data from this study  on an ongoing basis. Review of 
efficacy  data may  occur as part of an y risk-benefit assessment deemed the responsibility  of 
this committee. Based on these reviews, the DSMB will have the capacity to make 
recommendations to Pfizer that might impact the future conduct of the trial. The DSMB will 
have access to unblinded treatment information during the clinical trial. The management 
and process of this committee will be in accordance with Pfizer’s Standard Operating 
Procedures and will be documented in the DSMB Charter. The DSMB memb ers will all be 
individuals who are independent of Pfizer.
A DSMB Liaison will be appointed; this is an individual who represents Pfizer to coordinate 
communications and facilitates access to Pfizer’s resources, but is not involved in the study 
design, study  management, site management, data accrual, or study  anal ysis. Records of 
DSMB meetings, interactions with Pfizer contacts, assessments and recommendations and 
materials reviewed will be maintained and kept proprietary  and confidential by  the DSMB. 
Further information about the DSMB can be found in the DSMB Charter, which outlines the 
operating procedures of the committee, including specific description of the scope of their 
responsibilities, including a plan where communication timelines are defined.
The DSMB will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the efficacy  and safet y of subjects 
in the study  according to the Charter.  The recommendations made by  the DSMB to alter the 
conduct of the study will be forwarded to Pfizer for final decision.  Pfizer will forward such 
decisions, which may  include summaries of aggregate anal yses of endpoint events and of 
safet y data which are not endpoints, to regulatory  authorities, as appropriate.
9.7.Safety Event Adjudication Committees
To help assess specific safety  eventsin this and other studies for the tofacitinib program, 
adjudication committees have been established to harmonize and standardize selected safet y 
event assessment.  Members of these safet y event adjudication committees will be blinded to 
treatment ass ignment in order to allow for unbiased assessments. These committees include 
a Cardiovascular Endpoint Adjudication Committee (CV EAC), Malignancy  Adjudication 
Committee (MAC), Opportunistic I nfection Review Committee (OI RC), Hepatic Event 
Review Committe e (HERC) and Gastrointestinal Perforation Review Committee (GI PRC) .  
Further information about the se committees can be found in the respective charters , including 
specific description sof the scope of their responsibilities, and the process esand definitio ns 
used to review and assess specific safet y events.

Page 82In addition to the event adjudication or review committees described above, all biopsies of 
potentially  malignant tumors, suspicious ly mphadenopathy , or possible extranodal 
lymphoproliferative disorder, and all bowel biopsies conta ining d ysplasia or malignancy , 
should be submitted to the central laboratory  for review by  central laboratory  pathologists. 
In some instances, additional expert pathology  review of submitted samples may  be 
performed.  Descripti on of the scope of review and the processes used to obtain and assess 
biopsies is described in the Histopathology  Review for Potential Malignancy charter. 
In addition to these external committees, an internal committee of medically qualified Pfizer 
perso nnel with expertise in the assessment and diagnosis of respiratory  disease will review 
and categorize potential events of interstitial lung disease (Interstitial L ung Disease Review 
Committee, ILDRC).
Additional safet y event adjudication or review committe es may  be established to harmonize 
and standardize selected safet y event assessments.  As described above, individual committee 
charters will provide specific descriptions of the scope of responsibilities and the processes 
and definitions used to review and assess specific safet y events.
10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
During stud y conduct, Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure 
that the protocol and Good Clinical Practices ( GCPs )are being followed.  The monitors may  
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate.  The 
investigator and institution will allow Pfizer monitors or its agents and appropriate regulatory  
authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.
The study  site may  be subject to review by  the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/ Independent 
Ethics Committee (I EC), and/or to quality  assurance audits performed by  Pfizer, or 
companies working with or on behalf of Pfizer, and/or to inspection by  appropriate
regulatory  authorities.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPIN G
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from Pfizer.
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic / original, attributable, complete, 
CP-690,550
A3921139
Final Protocol Amendment 11, 18 June 2019
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 83consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed b y the investigator or b y an authorized staff member to attest that the 
data cont ained on the CRFs is true. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source 
documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospital's or the ph ysician's subject chart.  In 
these cases data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may  also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases, a document should be available at the investigator’s site as well as at Pfizer and clearl y 
identify  those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory  authorities or Pfizer, the investigator 
agrees to keep records, including the identit y of all participating subjects (sufficient 
information to link records, e g,CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed 
consent documents , copies of all CRFs, safety  reporting forms, source documents , and 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be 
retained b y the investigator according to International Conference on Har monisation ( ICH), 
local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study  Agreement (CSA) , whichever is 
longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), Pfi zer should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer , such as another 
investigator, another institution, or to an independent third part y arranged by Pfizer. 
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 y ears after completion or 
discontinuation of the study or for longer if required by  applicable local regulations.
The investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements ha ve been met. 
12.ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant do cuments, e g,
recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File.  Copies of IRB/IEC approvals should be 
forwarded to Pfizer.

Page 84The only  circumstance in which an amendm ent may  be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/IEC and Pfizer in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirements, as well as 
the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical 
Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for I nternational Organizations of Medical 
Sciences 2002), Guidelines for GCP (ICH 1996), and the Declaration of Helsinki (World 
Medical Association 1996, 2008). 
In addition, the study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the I nternational 
Confer ence on Harmonization guideline on Good Clinical Practice, and applicable local 
regulatory  requirements and laws.
12.3. Subject Information and Consent
All parties will ensure protection of subject personal data and will not include subject names 
on any  sponsor forms, reports, publications, or in any  other disclosures, except where
required b y laws.
Subject names, address, birth date and other identifiable data will be replaced by a numerical 
code consisting of a numbering s ystem provided by  Pfizer in order to de- identify  the trial 
subject .In case of data transfer, Pfizer will maintain high standards of confidentiality and 
protection of subject personal data.
The informed consent document must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory  
requirements, and le gal requirements.
The informed consent document used in this study, and any  changes made during the course 
of the study , must be prospectively  approved by  both the I RB/IEC and Pfizer before use.
The investigator must ensure that each study  subject, or his/her legal representative, is fully  
informed about the nature and objectives of the study  and possible .
The investigator, or a person designated b y the investigator, will obtain written informed 
consent from each subject or the subject's legal representative before an y study -specific 
activity  is performed. The investigator will retain the original of each subject's signed 
consent document .
12.4. Reporting of Safety Issues and S erious B reaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable 
Competent Authority  in any  area of the World, or if the investigator is aware of any  new 
information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the 
investigational product, Pfizer should be informed immediately.

taken b y the investigator to protect the study subjects against an y immediate hazard, and of 
any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.
13.DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL
13.1. End of Trial in a Member State
End of Trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is 
deemed that sufficient subjects have been recruited and co mpleted the study  as stated in the 
regulatory  application (i e,Clinical Trial Application (CTA)) and ethics application in the 
Member State.  Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) b y 
a Member State is not a reason for pr emature termination but is considered a normal 
conclusion to the study  in that Member State.
13.2. End of Trial in all Participating Countries
End of Trial in all participating countries is defined as last subject last visit.
14.SPONSOR DISCONTINUAT ION CRITERIA
Premature termination of this study  may  occur because of a regulatory  authority  decision, 
change in opinion of the IRB/IEC, drug safet y problems, or at the discretion of Pfizer.  In 
addition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of tofacitinib at any  time.
If a stud y is prematurel y terminated or discontinued, Pfizer will promptly  notify  the 
investigator.  After notification, the investigator must contact all participating subjects and 
the hospital pharmacy  (if applicable) within 1week .  As dire cted b y Pfizer, all study  
materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.
15.PUBLICATION OF STUDY RESULTS

It is recommended that subjects avoid consumption of grapefruit juice exceeding 8 ounces 
(~240 mL) total in a day  while in the study .
In a situation where appropriate medical care of a subject requires the use of a 
prohibited CYP3A inhibitor or inducer :Potent inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A are not 
permitted in the study  EXCEPT in emergency  situations requiring no more than one dayof 
administration.  Note: Mitotane (half -life of 18 -159 days) is not permitted for any duration 
due to its long half -life.  Subjects may  be initiated on moderate inhibitors (except 
amiodarone) and moderate inducers (shown above), as required, if the t otal duration of 
treatment lasts less than or equal to 7 days.  If a subject requires multiple courses of treatment 
with a prohibited medication as described above, the investigator should contact the sponsor 
to discuss the suitability  of the subject to re main in the study .  Topical (including skin or 
mucous membranes) application of antibacterial and antifungal medications is permitted.

Page 93Appendix 3. Guidelines for Monitoring and Discontinuations
The following laboratory abnormalities require monitoring and re-testing ideally within 
3-5 days:
•Absolute neutrophil count <1.2 x 109/L (<1200/mm3).
•Absolute lymphocyte count <0.5 x 109/L (<500/mm3).
•Any single hemoglobin value <8.0 g/dL, or any decrease in hemoglobin >2.0 g/dL 
from baseline.
•Platelet count <100 x 109/L (<100,000/mm3).
•An increase in serum creatinine of >50% from the baseline value; OR an absolute 
increase in serum creatinine >0.5 mg/dL (>44.2 umol/L) from baseline value.
•Any single AST and/or ALT elevation ≥3 times the upper limit of normal (repeat 
laboratory testing should include albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct and 
indirect bilirubin, GGT, PT [prothrombin time] with INR [international normalized ratio], and alkaline phosphatase), regardless of the total bilirubin. (Please note that 3 times the upper limit of normal increases in ALT, AST need confirmation on separate blood draw before undertaking thorough evaluation for liver injury).
•Any creatine kinase (CK) >10 times the upper limit of normal (repeat laboratory 
testing should also include cardiac troponin).
•For women of child-bearing potential with any positive urine β-hCG test, the subject 
will have study drug interrupted and a serum sample submitted to the central 
laboratory for β-hCG testing.
Additional individual subject safety monitoring in addition to these guidelines is at the 
discretion of the investigator and dependent on any perceived safety concerns. Unscheduled laboratory testing through the central laboratory may be obtained at any time during the study to assess such concerns, and a subject may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator.
Treatment with tofacitinib will be discontinued and the subject withdrawn from this 
study for:
•Serious infections defined as any infection (viral, bacterial, and fungal) requiring 
parenteral antimicrobial therapy, hospitalization for treatment, or meeting other 
criteria that require the infection to be classified as serious adverse event.
•Two sequential absolute neutrophil counts <0.75 x 10
9/L (<750/mm3).C

Page 98Appendix 6.Evaluation of Potentially Malignant Tumors, Suspicious 
Lymphadenopathy or Possible Extranodal Lymphoproliferative Disorder (LPD)
The following steps should be taken in the event of suspicious ly mphadenopathy  or possible 
extranodal ly mphoproliferative disorder (L PD) which might arise in the course of this or 
other studies of Pfizer’s experimental immunosuppressive drugs. 
Any new cases or worsening cases of existing l ymphadenopath y need to be discussed with 
Pfizer study  team first. In addition, when there is a decision to biopsy  a suspicious ly mph 
node, the inv estigator and/or consultants should discuss the issue and an y decisions as soon 
as possible with Pfizer study  team. It is recommended that specialists with experience in the 
evaluation of immunosuppressed patients be consulted.
If a biops y for l ymphadenop athy or ly mphoma is to be performed, the investigator or 
consultant should refer to the study  biops y procedures instructions and review the following 
points with the surgeon and pathologist:
Fine needle aspiration and core needle biops y are strongl y discou raged; excisional 
biopsy  is required for accurate diagnosis;
Tissue must be sent fresh to the pathology  laboratory ; the pathologist must be 
consulted before the procedure;
Archive multiple frozen tissue samples, if possible;
Include flow cy tometry  and cy togenetics as part of the pathologic evaluation;
Culture for my cobacterium and fungi, if indicated;
Collect and snap freeze peripheral blood ly mphocy tes for germ line evaluation 
(DNA);
Archive multiple aliquots of serum samples.
For all biopsies of potential ly malignant tumors, suspicious ly mphadenopathy , or possible 
extranodal ly mphoproliferative disorder (L PD), request the pathologist to send the original 
slides used to make the definitive diagnosis, ancillary  study  reports, and the pathologist’s 
report to the central laboratory  for a blinded review by  a central pathologist. Should the 
central pathologist make a diagnosis that is not essentially  similar to the local pathologist’s 
diagnosis, the site will be notified and provided with an opportunity  to consu lt with the 
central pathologist. Translation during this consultation, if needed, will be provided b y the 
staff of the Pfizer Clinical Country  Office (CCO) or designee .

Page 100Appendix 8. Recommended Clinical Management of Choles terol
Safety  monitoring of a subject’s lipid panel results is recommended to include an assessment
of individual subject risk for cardiovascular disease. Management of lipid levels should be
determined on an individual subject level due to the individuali zed nature of cholesterol
treatment recommendations. The Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation,
and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (ATP III, National Cholesterol Education
Program 2002) provides guiding principles for th e intensity  of lipid lowering therapy  based 
on an individual’s absolute risk for coronary  heart disease (CHD). ATP III guidelines and/or 
other relevant local practices and guidelines should be used to determine if any  lipid lowering 
intervention is requir ed for a subject. Such assessments sho uld occur throughout the stud y, 
in light of the observed increases in lipid levels in previous clinical trials with tofacitinib. As 
appropriate, lipid management decisions may be considered in collaboration with the 
subject’s primary  care phy sician or general practitioner.
A cop y of the complete ATP III guidelines will be provided to each stud y site for reference.

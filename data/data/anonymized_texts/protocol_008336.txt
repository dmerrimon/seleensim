Title of Study: A Multicenter,  Randomized,  Double-blind, Active -controlled  Study to Evaluate the Safety and 
Efficacy of EXPAREL  Plus Bupivacaine  When Administered  via Infiltration  into the Transversus  Abdominis  Plane 
(TAP) Versus Bupivacaine Alone in Subjects Undergoing  Elective Cesarean Section 
Principal  investigator:  To be determined  
Study Center(s):  Multicenter  study in North America 
Publications (Reference):  None 
Objectives:  
Primary objective: The primary objective of this study is to compare total opioid consumption through  72 hours 
following  EXPAREL+bupivacaine  HCl infiltration  into the transversus abdominis  plane (TAP) after spinal anesthesia  
to active bupivacaine  HCl TAP  infiltration  after spinal anesthesia  in subjects undergoing an elective cesarean section 
(C-section). 
Secondary  objective: The secondary  objectives  are to assess efficacy and  safety parameters  and patient satisfaction.  
Methodology:  
This is a Phase-4, multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind, active -controlled study in  approximately 152 adult subjects  
undergoing  elective C-section. All subjects will remain in the hospital for up to 72 hours  postsurgery.  
Obtaining Informed Consent 
Potential participants  may provide informed consent  up to 30 days before their  scheduled surgery.  If a subject can  only 
be screened on the day of surgery, the  consent process must be started at least 24 hours  prior to the day of surgery in 
order to ensure ample  time for the subject to review the ICF and have all her questions answered by the 
investigator/study staff  prior to providing  informed consent. Screening procedures  that are standard of care (SOC) at 
the institution may  be completed  prior to written informed consent. Any screening procedures  that are not SOC, must 
be completed  after written informed consent is provided  and prior to  surgery. 
Screening  
Subjects will be screened within 30 days  prior to surgery; screening  on the day of surgery will be allowed but is 
discouraged.  If a subject can only be screened on the day of surgery, the informed consent process must still be  
started at least 24 hours prior to the conduct of any screening procedures that are not considered  SOC at the institution  
and such procedures may not be performed  until written informed consent is provided  All screening  procedures  that 
are not SOC must be performed  and documented within the 30 -day time window (inclusive of the day of surgery for 
those subjects  who can only be screened on  the day of surgery) as described here.  During the screening visit, subjects  
will be assessed for  any past or present medical conditions  that in the opinion of  the investigator would preclude them  
from study participation.  
After the informed consent form  (ICF) is signed, a medical history, surgical history, physical  examination, 12 -lead 
electrocardiogram  (ECG), vital  sign measurements,  alcohol breath  test and urine drug screen,  and clinical laboratory  
tests (hematology and  chemistry)  will be performed.

Name of Active Ingredients:  
Bupivacaine,  1.3%, 13.3 mg/mL 
Day of Surgery 
Pre-operative medications : Use of pre-operative analgesics  (eg, opioid  medications,  acetaminophen, nonsteroidal  
anti-inflammatory  drugs [NSAIDs])  is prohibited.  
Eligible subjects will be randomized  in a blinded 1:1  ratio to either: 
• Group 1: EXPAREL+bupivacaine  TAP infiltration  following spinal anesthesia  
• Group 2: Active bupivacaine  HCl TAP infiltration  following  spinal anesthesia  
On Day 1, prior to the C-section, all subjects will receive a intrathecal  injection of  150 mcg preservative -free 
morphine  for spinal injection (eg,  Duramorph®) in conjunction with single -shot spinal anesthesia  using 1.4-1.6 mL 
bupivacaine HCl 0.75%  and 15 mcg fentanyl.  If preservative -free morphine  for spinal injection (eg, Duramorph)  is 
unavailable because of  a drug shortage, subjects  may instead receive  an intrathecal  injection of 75 mcg preservative - 
free hydromorphone  in conjunction  with single-shot spinal anesthesia  using 1.4-1.6 mL bupivacaine HCl  0.75% and 
15 mcg fentanyl. A combined  spinal epidural (CSE) anesthesia  technique  may also be used provided the epidural 
component  is not used. Subjects who receive the epidural component  of the CSE anesthesia  must be immediately  
withdrawn from the study.  
Intraoperative medications: The intraoperative  use of the following medications  is discouraged, but  may be permitted 
if clinically indicated based on the investigator’s  discretion (all medications  must be appropriately  recorded [ie, drug, 
dose, and  route of administration]):  ketamine and midazolam (Versed®). Prophylactic  use of dexamethasone for  
prevention of nausea  and vomiting  is prohibited.  
After delivery of the baby and prior to the TAP infiltration,  a small amount of lidocaine (<2 mL) may be administered  
subcutaneously to form a skin wheal over the area of the needle insertion site. A 2-point classic TAP block,  in 2 steps 
(see below), must be performed under ultrasound guidance  and must be performed  no more than 90 minutes after skin 
incision closure of the C-section. A confirmatory  ultrasound picture  or video will  be taken of each side of the 
abdomen after the TAP needle position has been established  and following  infiltration of study drug.  
TAP infiltration:  The TAP infiltration  includes two steps: (1) TAP needle  placement  and saline hydrodissection  and 
(2) study drug mixture  infiltration  into the TAP. Each step is briefly described below  for one side of the abdomen and 
must be repeated on the contralateral  side to complete the bilateral, 2-point TAP required for the study. For complete,  
step-by-step instructions on performing  the TAP infiltration under  ultrasound guidance,  please refer to the Pharmacy  
Binder. 
(1) TAP needle placement  and saline  hydrodissection: For  subjects in both study groups,  use ultrasound  guidance to 
place the TAP needle  into the desired  location and use a 10-mL syringe pre-filled with normal  saline to perform 
hydrodissection of the TAP. (Note: it is not necessary to use  the full 10 mL of normal saline  for hydodissection.)   
An ultrasound image  of the TAP needle must be captured after saline hydrodissection.  
(2) Study drug mixture infiltration  into the TAP: Subjects randomized  to the EXPAREL+bupivacaine group  (Group 
1) will receive 30  mL of a study drug mixture containing 10  mL EXPAREL  (133 mg) combined with 10  mL 
bupivacaine HCl 0.25%  (25 mg) and 10 mL normal saline (total mixture 30 mL) infiltrated  into the TAP. An 
ultrasound  image of the TAP needle placement  must be captured after study drug infiltration.  
Subjects randomized  to the active bupivacaine  group (Group 2) will  receive 30 mL of a study drug  mixture 
containing 10 mL bupivacaine  HCl 0.25% (25 mg) combined with 20 mL normal saline (total  mixture 30 mL) 
infiltrated  into the TAP. An ultrasound image of the TAP needle  placement  must be captured after study drug 
mixture infiltration.  
Repeat the above steps on the contralateral  side to complete the bilateral, 2-point TAP required for the study.

Name of Active Ingredients:  
Bupivacaine,  1.3%, 13.3 mg/mL 
Postsurgical Analgesia: Patient-controlled  analgesia  is not permitted.  
The following multimodal  pain regimen  will be used: 
At the time of skin incision closure (Note: it is very important  that these  be administered at the  time of wound closure 
and not prior to or before the end of surgery) 
• Intravenous (IV) ketorolac 15  mg (1 dose) 
• IV acetaminophen  1000 mg (1 dose) 
Beginning 6 hours after skin incision closure  
• Scheduled  oral (PO) acetaminophen 650 mg beginning  6 hours from the administration of  the single dose  of IV 
acetaminophen  at the end of surgery and then every 6 hours (q6h) for up to 72 hours or hospital discharge  
• Scheduled  PO ibuprofen 600  mg beginning 6 hours from the administration of  the single dose of IV ketorolac  at 
the end of  surgery and  then q6h for up  to 72 hours or hospital discharge  
This multi-modal pain regimen  is a requirement  for all subjects in the study and is not subject to investigator  
discretion.  The date, time, and dose of all standardized  multimodal pain medications  administered  must be recorded. 
Note: The scheduled  PO medication will  be administered  on a q6h schedule only through hospital  discharge.  
Rescue Medication : Subjects should only receive  opioid rescue pain medication upon request for breakthrough pain.  
Postsurgical  rescue medication will  comprise PO immediate -release oxycodone  (initiated at 5-10 mg every 4 hours 
[q4h] or as needed [PRN]). If a subject is unable to tolerate PO medication  or fails the PO oxycodone  rescue, IV 
morphine (initiated  at 1-2 mg) or hydromorphone  (initiated at  0.3-0.5 mg) may be administered q4h  or PRN. All 
surgical and postsurgical opioid  and other analgesics  (pain medications)  administered  must be documented  through 
Day 14 postsurgery.  Additionally,  an unscheduled pain  intensity score using  a 10-cm visual analog scale  (VAS; see  
Appendix 1) must be completed  immediately prior  to any rescue  medication while  in the hospital.  
Permitted  medications for  the prevention and treatment of possible medication  side effects include the following  and 
may be used at the discretion of the study site principal investigator:  
• Ondansetron 4 mg IV immediately after  delivery of the baby. 
• Ondansetron 4 mg IV (should not exceed a maximum  of 12 mg in a 24-hour period)  for intraoperative and  
postoperative nausea  and vomiting  
• Metoclopramide 10 mg PO PRN for nausea  and vomiting 
• Nalbuphine IV 2.5  mg PRN for pruritus  
• Naloxone IV 50 -100 mcg PRN for pruritus.  
Postsurgical  Assessments  
Subjects will remain in the hospital for up to 72 hours postsurgery.  Postsurgical  assessments  will include: 
• Opioid use • Subject's satisfaction with postsurgical  pain control (see 
• Time of first unassisted ambulation  Appendix 3) 
• Pain intensity scores using a 10-cm VAS • Overall benefit of anesthesia  score (OBAS) questionnaire  
(see Appendix 1) at rest  (see Appendix 4) 
• Discharge readiness (see Appendix 2) • Quality of recovery 15-item questionnaire (QoR -15; see 
Appendix 5)

While in the hospital, subjects will be provided with a Patient Binder and will  use the binder to record all scheduled  
and unscheduled VAS scores.  For all scheduled  assessments  and unscheduled  assessments  in the hospital, subjects 
will assess, “How much pain are you experiencing  right now” and a vertical mark will  be placed  on the VAS line to 
indicate the level of pain experienced  at the time of assessment. If a subject is discharged  prior to a scheduled VAS  
assessment,  a member of the study site  staff will contact the subject to remind  her to complete the scheduled VAS  
assessment  at the scheduled  time and to record the assessment  in the Participant  Diary, which will  be provided to the 
subject at the time of hospital discharge.  
At hospital discharge,  the subject will be instructed  to record in the Participant  Diary VAS pain intensity score daily 
and all pain medications taken  following hospital  discharge  through Day  14. 
At home,  the subject will  assess pain intensity at rest each day at noon (± 4 hours). This assessment  should capture 
her average pain  at rest in the prior 24 hours by assessing “What  has been your  average pain  since your  last pain 
assessment?” (ie,  from noon on the previous  day to the current assessment).  At the same time, the subject should 
record any pain medication  (medication name,  date, time, and dose)  taken in the prior 24 hours.  
A phone call will be made to each subject on Day 14 for safety  purposes and  to inquire as to whether the subject has  
made any unscheduled phone  calls or office visits  related to pain; experienced  any hospital readmission; or  
experienced  an emergency room  visit since hospital discharge.  Adverse events (AEs)  and serious adverse events 
(SAEs) will be recorded from the time the ICF is signed through Day 14. 
Number of Subjects  (Planned) : Approximately  152 subjects are planned  for enrollment  into the study. Subjects who 
are withdrawn  or discontinued prior  to completing  the study may be replaced. 
Eligibility  Criteria: 
Note: Based on the World Health  Organization’s  Guidance:  Breastfeeding  and Maternal Medication,  
Recommendations for Drugs in  the Eleventh  WHO Model List of Essential Drugs,  bupivacaine is compatible with  
breastfeeding and,  therefore,  there are no restrictions  in this study  regarding  the participation of women wh o wish to 
breastfeed  following  treatment with study  drug.

Duration of Subject Participation  in Study: 
Participation  will begin upon  signing of  the ICF. No more than 7 30 days should pass  between signing the ICF and 
surgery. A follow-up telephone  call will occur on Day 14 (± 3 days). Therefore,  each subject may participate  in the 
study for a maximum  of 44 47 days. 
Efficacy Assessments:  
The following efficacy  measurements  will be conducted  at the times specified after completion  of the last C-section 
wound incision stitch (ie, time of closure of the C-section wound): 
• Date, time of administration, and amount of all postsurgical opioid rescue medication  taken through Day 14 
• Pain intensity scor es at rest using a 10-cm VAS at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, and 72 hours (see Appendix 1)  
and once daily (at noon ± 4 hours) through Day  14. † For pain intensity scores at 18, 24, 30, 36, or 42 hours, if 
the subject is sleeping, do not wake her to assess pain. If she awakens within  the assessment window (ie, 1 hour 
for the 18- and 24-hour assessments and 2 hours for the  30-, 36-, and 42-hour assessments),  a pain score may be 
collected then. 
Please note that an unscheduled VAS  score is also required immediately prior  to administration of  any rescue  
medication while  in the hospital. 
• Date and time of first unassisted  ambulation  
• OBAS questionnaire  at 24, 48, and 72 hours (see Appendix 4).  † 
• Subject satisfaction with postsurgical pain  control (using a 5-point Likert scale) at 72 hours or hospital  
discharge (see Appendix 3) 
• Discharge  readiness at 24, 48, and 72 hours or until the subject attains a score of 9, whichever  occurs first (see 
Appendix 2) 
• QoR-15 questionnaire at 72 hours  or hospital discharge (Appendix 5)  
• Unscheduled phone  calls or office visits related to pain after discharge  through Day  14 
†If a subject is discharged prior to  any of the scheduled VAS assessments  collected at 6 to 72 hours postsurgery or  a 
scheduled  OBAS assessment  collected at 24 to 72 hours postsurgery,  a member of the study site staff will contact the 
subject at the appropriate  scheduled  times (ie, the time of each assessment  scheduled  to be collected that occurs after 
hospital discharge)  to remind her  to complete the VAS and OBAS assessments  and to record the scheduled  
assessments  in the Participant  Diary. This will ensure that for any subject discharged prior  to 72 hours, all VAS and 
OBAS assessments  required for calculation  of the study endpoints are captured. These phone calls  will only occur if a 
subject is discharged prior to 72 hours. 
Efficacy Endpoints:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the total postsurgical opioid consumption  in morphine  equivalents through  72 hours. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints  include: 
• Time to first postsurgical  opioid rescue  medication  
• The VAS pain  intensity scores  (at rest) from 0 6 to 72 hours 
• Percentage of opioid-free subjects through 72 h ours

Bupivacaine,  1.3%, 13.3 mg/mL 
Tertiary efficacy endpoints  may include (but may  not be limited to): 
• Percentage of opioid-free subjects through 24  and 48 hours.  
• The VAS pain intensity scores (at  rest) from 6 to 12 hours, 6 to 24 hours,  6 to 48 hours,  24 to 48 hours, and 48 
to 72 hours. 
• Integrated  rank assessment  using the VAS pain intensity score (at rest) at 24,  48, and 72 hours and  the total 
amount of postsurgical opioids  consumed  through 24, 48,  and 72 hours.  
• OBAS at each assessed timepoint.  
• Time spent in the post-anesthesia  care unit (PACU).  
• Time to first unassisted  ambulation.  
• Proportion of  subjects meeting  Modified Postanesthesia Discharge Scoring  System criteria for discharge  
readiness at each assessed timepoint.  
• Overall assessment of the subject’s satisfaction with postsurgical pain  control (using  a 5-point Likert scale)  at 
72 hours after surgery (or at hospital discharge  if earlier than 72 hours). 
• Responses to  the QoR-15 questionnaire  at 72 hours after  surgery (or at hospital discharge if earlier  than 
72 hours). 
• Number of unscheduled phone  calls or office visits related to pain from  discharge  through Day 14. 
Safety Assessments : 
Adverse events (AEs/SAEs)  will be recorded from  the time the ICF is signed through Day 14. 
Safety Endpoints:  
Incidence of AEs/SAEs  that start after the start of anesthesia  through Day 14.  
Statistical  Methods:  
A comprehensive  statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed  for this study. Demographic  and baseline  
characteristics  will be summarized descriptively  by treatment group for all subjects who  receive study drug.  
Efficacy endpoint analyses will  be described in  the SAP. 
Safety endpoints  will be summarized  descriptively  by treatment group.  
Sample size for this study was based on Quale  et al (2016). The coefficient  of variation (CV) from this poster was 
approximately 60%.  Assuming  a log-normal distribution  for total opioid consumption  with a 60% CV, 5% alpha, a 
1:1 randomization ratio, and 80%  power, a total of 72 subjects per treatment group  will be sufficient to  detect a 30% 
difference between treatments.  Assuming  5% of the subjects are not  evaluable,  a total sample size of  approximately  
152 subjects is needed to ensure 144  evaluable  subjects. 
Interim Analysis 
An unblinded  interim analysis will be conducted  by an independent s tatistician  when approximately  80 treated  
subjects under protocol  amendment  2 have completed  the 72-hour follow -up for the primary  efficacy assessments.  The 
objective of this interim analysis is three-fold: (1) to stop the trial for futility if it is improbable  to show a significant  
reduction  in the primary efficacy endpoints; (2)  to stop the trial for early success if a clear benefit is demonstrated;  and 
(3) to allow for the possibility  of increasing  the study sample size if the original  sample size assumptions are  
determined  to be not viable. Full details and all thresholds for  stopping or  trial expansion will  be covered in a 
prospective  interim analysis plan that will become part of the study SAP.

4 Clinical laboratory  tests will be  conducted  in accordance  with the investigator’s  standard of  care including direct bilirubin and either  gamma-glutamyl 
transpeptidase (GGT)  and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) OR alanine transaminase (ALT) and  aspartate transaminase  (AST). Note: if clinical laboratory  test results 
are available from with 14 days of surgery, laboratory  tests do not have to be repeated at screening  
5 If clinical laboratory  test results are available from within 14  days of surgery, laboratory  tests do not have to be repeated  at screening  
6 Following hospital discharge,  the subject will record  her daily use of pain medication,  if any, in the Participant Diary  
7 Discharge  readiness will be assessed at  24, 48, and 72 hours or  until the subject  attains a score of 9, whichever  occurs first 
8 To assess pain intensity (VAS) at rest, the subject should rest quietly in a supine or seated position that does not exacerbate  her postsurgical pain for  3-5 minutes  
before entering the pain score. 
9 If a subject is  discharged prior to any of the scheduled  VAS assessments  collected at 6 to 72 hours postsurgery  or a scheduled  OBAS assessment  collected at 24 to 
72 hours postsurgery, a member  of the study site staff will contact  the subject  at the appropriate  scheduled times (ie, the time of each assessment scheduled  to be 
collected that occurs after hospital discharge)  to remind her to complete the VAS and OBAS assessments  and to record the scheduled  assessments  in the  
Participant  Diary. This will ensure that for any subject discharged  prior to 72 hours, all VAS and OBAS assessments  required for calculation of  the study endpoints  
are captured. These phone calls  will only occur if a subject is discharged prior to 72 hours. 
10 For pain intensity scores at 18, 24, 30, 36, or 42 hours, if the subject is sleeping, do not wake her to assess pain. If she awakens within the assessment window (ie,  
1 hour for  the 18- and 24-hour assessments and 2  hours for the 30-, 36-, and 42-hour assessments),  a pain score may be collected then.  
11 If preservative -free morphine for spinal injection (eg,  Duramorph) is unavailable  because of  a drug shortage, subjects may instead receive an intrathecal injection  
of 75 mcg preservative -free hydromorphone  in conjunction with single-shot spinal anesthesia  using 1.4-1.6 mL bupivacaine HCl 0.75% and 15 mcg fentanyl. 
12 Vital Signs will include Height  and Weight at Screening.  
13 Potential participants  may provide informed consent  up to 30 days before their scheduled  surgery. If a subject can only be screened on the day of surgery, the 
consent process must be started  at least 24  hours prior to the day of surgery in order to ensure ample time for the subject to review the  ICF and have all her 
questions answered by the investigator/study  staff prior to providing  informed consent.  Screening procedures  that are standard of care (SOC) at the institution  may 
be completed  prior to written informed consent. Any screening  procedures  that are not SOC, must be completed after  written informed  consent is provided and 
prior to surgery. 
If a subject  can only be screened  on the day of surgery, the informed consent process must still be started at least 24 hours prior to the conduct of any screening  
procedures  that are not considered  SOC at the institution and such procedures  may not be performed  until written informed consent is provided.

7. INTRODUCTION  
7.1. Indication  
EXPAREL® was developed  to extend pain relief with a single dose  administration  without the  
use of indwelling  catheters and to decrease the requirement for supplemental opioid medications.  
It is indicated for use as an analgesic injected  into the surgical site for postsurgical pain relief.  
Effective postsurgical  pain control is a critical element in patient recovery following surgery,  
as the majority of patients may experience significant  pain, particularly  in the first few days. 
Improved  postsurgical  pain management  contributes to better healing, faster patient mobilization,  
shortened hospital stays, and reduced healthcare  costs (American  Society of Anesthesiologists  
Task Force on Pain Management 1995). 
7.2. Current Therapies/Treatments  
Current modalities of postoperative analgesia include  wound infiltration with local anesthetics  
combined  with the systemic administration  of analgesics (multimodal  therapy). Multimodal  
therapy usually includes opioid medications, which  have considerable drawbacks including time 
and resources required for monitoring  opioid-related side effects.  A reduction in the use of  
postoperative  opioids is desirable to decrease the incidence and severity of opioid-induced 
adverse effects, such as respiratory  depression,  nausea, vomiting,  constipation, somnolence,  
pruritus, and urinary retention.  
With over 70 million surgeries performed  annually in  the US, postoperative  pain is a ubiquitous  
condition  among our population.  While it is a predictable  component of the postoperative  
process, such pain is often poorly managed,  resulting in clinical and physiological changes that 
increase morbidity and mortality (inability to ambulate early, etc), diminish quality of life,  
and extend length of stay, thereby increasing  hospital expenditures (Oderda 2007) and reducing  
patient satisfaction.  Effective relief of acute pain with minimal opioid complications,  on the 
other hand, may improve clinical outcomes, avoid complications  (like delay in regaining bowel  
function or an inability to tolerate liquid and solid oral intake, etc.), and conserve healthcare  
resources.  As such, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare  Organizations requires  
that all healthcare facilities  practice adequate pain  manageme nt and monitor opioid-related 
adverse events (AEs) (Apfelbaum  2003). 
Opioid analgesics have long been established to be the most effective agents used for the  
management  of moderate to severe postoperative  pain, and are currently considered the mainstay  
of treatment.   Opioid-only regimens are common and intravenous (IV) patient-controlled  
analgesia is a widely used delivery system for morphine sulfate.  Adverse events related to 
opioid administration  (eg, nausea, vomiting,  ileus, confusion), however, represent one important  
reason that there is a need to develop opioid -sparing strategies.  Indeed, fear of gastrointestinal  
side effects such as nausea and vomiting, as well as respiratory  depression,  present major 
limitations  for the widespread use of  opioid analgesics (Chernin 2001 and Viscusi 2009).

Furthermore,  management  of opioid-related events often requires medical attention (eg, opioid 
antagonists,  antiemetic agents) and increased  pharmacy/nursing  time, which may raise healthcare  
expenses (Carroll 1994). 
7.3. EXPAREL  (bupivacaine  liposome  injectable  suspension)  
Bupivacaine is one of the longer-acting local anesthetics,  but even so it has a limited duration 
of action after local administration, usually reported as less than 8 hours. EXPAREL  (Pacira 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Parsippany,  New Jersey) is a bupivacaine liposome injectable  suspension.  
It consists of microscopic  spherical, multivesicular liposomes (DepoFoam® drug delivery  
system), organized  in a honeycomb -like structure comprising numerous non-concentric  internal 
aqueous chambers containing a bupivacaine  base at a concentration of 13.3 mg/mL.  Each 
chamber is separated from adjacent chambers  by lipid membranes.  The lipids (phospholipids,  
cholesterol,  and triglycerides) are naturally occurring or close analogs of endogenous lipids.  
Bupivacaine  is slowly released from the DepoFoam  particles by a complex mechanism  involving  
reorganization of the barrier  lipid membranes and subsequent diffusion of the drug over an  
extended period of time. 
EXPAREL  was approved by the US FDA in 2011 for administration into the surgical site to 
produce postsurgical analgesia.  The active ingredient  (bupivacaine) and inactive ingredient  
(DepoFoam)  of EXPAREL  are each contained, though separately,  in FDA-approved products: 
• Bupivacaine HCl solution, a well-characterized  anesthetic/analgesic,  with more than 
35 years of its use in the US. 
• DepoFoam,  a liposomal  extended-release formulation  contained in the marketed product 
DepoCyt® (1999).  The form  of DepoFoam  used in EXPAREL has  a slightly different  
mixture of lipid components  than that used in DepoCyt.  
7.4. Summary  of Human Experience  with EXPAREL  
Pacira has conducted  more than 36 clinical studies and one observational  follow-up study to 
investigate  EXPAREL.  Across these studies, over 1800 human subjects received EXPAREL  at 
doses ranging from 2 mg to 665 mg (equivalent to 2 mg to 750 mg bupivacaine HCl)  
administered by various routes: local infiltration  into the surgical site, subcutaneous,  perineural  
(or “nerve block”), and epidural.  The product has been  generally well tolerated and, in active 
comparator studies, reported AEs occurred at a similar rate as the  corresponding bupivacaine  
HCl controls.  
Across the entire clinical development  program, in doses up to 665 mg, no adverse safety signal  
attributed  to either the central nervous or cardiovascular systems was reported with EXPAREL.  
Adverse events that are occasionally  reported with high doses of standard  bupivacaine  solution 
have not been observed.  In two rigorous QTc studies, EXPAREL did not cause significant QTc 
prolongation  even at the highest dose eval uated.

The robust nature of the efficacy results in both wound infiltration  pivotal studies 
(SKY0402 -C-316 and SKY0402 -C-317) was demonstrated  across subgroups  of subjects with 
various prognostic features and across demographic  subgroups.  
Following the NDA submission  of EXPAREL, numerous clinical studies were conducted  in 
which EXPAREL was administered  via various routes of administration including infiltration  
into the transver sus abdominis plane (TAP) (Sterlicht 2014, Feierman 2014) and intraoperative  
wound infiltration or instillation.   Additionally,  as of June 2017, more than 3 million patients 
have received EXPAREL in the  postmarketing setting. 
Please refer to the Investigat or’s Brochure for additional  information  regarding  the completed  
studies. Please see the EXPAREL Full Prescribing  Information  for complete safety information  
regarding EXPAREL  (liposome  bupivacaine injectable suspension) in the setting of wound  
infiltration.  
8. OBJECTIVES  
8.1. Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to compare total opioid consumption through 72 hours 
following EXPAREL+bupivacaine HCl infiltration into the TAP after spinal anesthesia to active 
bupivacaine  infiltration  in the TAP after spinal anesthesia  in subjects undergoing  elective 
cesarean section (C -section). 
8.2. Secondary  Objectives  
The secondary  objectives  are to assess efficacy and safety parameters  and patient satisfaction.  
9. OVERALL  STUDY DESIGN  AND PLAN 
9.1. Study Design 
This is a Phase -4, multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind, active-controlled study in  
approximately 152 adult subjects undergoing elective  C-section. 
Obtaining  Informed Consent 
Potential participants  may provide informed consent up to 30 days before their scheduled  
surgery. If a subject can only be screened on the day of surgery, the consent process must be  
started at least 24 hours prior to the day of surgery in order to ensure ample time for the subject  
to review the ICF and have all her questions  answered by the investigator/study staff prior to 
providing  informed consent. Screening procedures  that are standard of care (SOC) at the 
institution may be completed  prior to written informed consent. Any screening procedures that  
are not SOC, must be completed after written informed consent is  provided and prior to surgery. 
(see Section 13.3).

Screening  
Subjects will be screened within 7 30 days prior  to surgery; screening  on the day of surgery will 
be allowed but is discouraged.  If a subject can only be screened on the day of surgery, the 
informed consent process must still be started at least 24 hours prior to the conduct of any 
screening procedures  that are not considered SOC at the institution  and such procedures  may not 
be performed  until written informed consent is provided All screening procedures that  are not 
SOC must be performed  and documented  within the 730-day time window (inclusive of the day  
of surgery for those subjects who can only be screened on the day of surgery) as described  here. 
During the screening  visit, subjects will be assessed for any past or present medical conditions  
that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude them from study participation.  
After the ICF is signed, a medical history, surgical history, physical examination,  12-lead 
electrocardiogram  (ECG), vital  sign measurements,  clinical laboratory  tests (hematology and 
chemistry), alcohol breath test, and urine drug screen will be performed.  
Day of Surgery 
Pre-operative medications:  Use of pre-operative analgesics  (eg, opioid medications,  
acetaminophen,  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs])  is prohibited.  
Eligible subjects will be randomized  in a blinded 1:1 ratio to either: 
• Group 1: EXPAREL+bupivacaine  TAP infiltration following  spinal anesthesia  
• Group 2: Active bupivacaine  TAP infiltration  following spinal anesthesia  
On Day 1, prior to the C-section, all subjects will receive a intrathecal  injection of 150 mcg 
preservative -free morphine  for spinal injection (eg, Duramorph®) in conjunction  with single-shot 
spinal anesthesia  using 1.4-1.6 mL bupivacaine  HCl 0.75% and 15 mcg fentanyl. If preservative - 
free morphine for spinal injection (eg, Duramorph)  is unavailable because of a drug shortage,  
subjects may instead receive an intrathecal injection of 75 mcg preservative -free hydromorphone  
in conjunction with single-shot spinal anesthesia  using 1.4-1.6 mL bupivacaine HCl 0.75% and 
15 mcg fentanyl. A combined spinal epidural (CSE) anesthesia technique may also be used 
provided the epidural component is  not used. Subjects who receive the epidural component  of 
the CSE anesthesia must be immediately withdrawn  from the study. 
Intraoperative medications:  The intraoperative use of the following  medications  is discouraged,  
but may be permitted  if clinically indicated based on the investigator’s  discretion  (all 
medications must be appropriately  recorded [ie, drug, dose, and route o f administration]):  
ketamine and midazolam  (Versed®). Prophylactic use of dexamethasone  for prevention  of nausea  
and vomiting is prohibited.  
After delivery of the baby and prior to the TAP  infiltration, a small amount of lidocaine (<2 mL) 
may be administered  subcutaneously  to form a skin wheal over the area of the needle insertion  
site.  A 2-point classic TAP block, in 2 steps  (see below), must be performed under ultrasound  
guidance and must be performed  no more than 90  minutes after skin incision  closure of the

C- section. A confirmatory ultrasound  picture or video will be taken of each side of the abdomen 
after the TAP needle position has been established and after infiltration  of study drug. 
TAP infiltration: The TAP infiltration  includes two steps: (1) TAP needle placement and saline 
hydrodissection  and (2) study drug mixture infiltration  into the TAP. Each step is briefly  
described below for one side of the abdomen and must be repeated on the contralateral side to  
complete the bilateral, 2 -point TAP required for the study. For complete, step-by-step 
instructions  on performing the TAP infiltration under ultrasound  guidance,  please refer to the 
Pharmacy  Binder. 
(1) TAP needle placement  and saline hydrodissection: For subjects in both study groups, use 
ultrasound  guidance to place the TAP needle into the desired  location and use a 10-mL 
syringe pre-filled with normal saline to perform  hydrodissection of the TAP.  (Note: it is  
not necessary to use the full 10 mL of normal saline for hydodissection.)  An ultrasound  
image of the TAP needle placement  must be captured after saline hydrodissection.  
(2) Study drug mixture infiltration into the TAP: Subjects randomized to the 
EXPAREL+bupivacaine  group (Group 1) will receive 30 mL of a study drug mixture 
containing 10 mL EXPAREL  (133 mg) combined  with 10 mL bupivacaine HCl 0.25% (25  
mg) and 10 mL normal saline (total mixture 30 mL) administered into the TAP.  An 
ultrasound image of the TAP needle placement must be captured after study drug 
infiltration.  
Subjects randomized to the active bupivacaine  group (Group 2) will receive 30 mL of a 
study drug mixture containing  10 mL bupivacain e HCl 0.25% (25 mg) combined  with 
20 mL normal saline (total mixture 30 mL) administered  into the TAP. An ultrasound  
image of the TAP needle placement  must be captured after study drug mixture infiltration.  
Repeat the above steps on the contralateral  side to complete the bilateral, 2 -point TAP required  
for the study.  
Postsurgical Analgesia: Patient-controlled analgesia is not permitted  
The following  multimodal  pain regimen will be used:  
At the time of skin incision closure ( Note: it is ve ry important  that these be administered at the 
time of wound closure and not prior to or before the end of surgery) 
• Intravenous  (IV) ketorolac 15 mg (1 dose) 
• IV acetaminophen  1000 mg (1 dose)  
Beginning  6 hours after skin incision closure  
• Scheduled oral (PO) acetaminophen  650 mg beginning  6 hours from  the administration  of 
the single dose of IV acetaminophen  at the end of surgery and then every 6 hours (q6h) for 
up to 72 hours  or hospital discharge

CONFIDENTIAL  30 of 68 07-May-2018  
  
• Scheduled PO ibuprofen 600 mg beginning 6 hours from the administration  of the single  
dose of IV ketorolac at the end of surgery and then q6h for up to 72 hours or hospital 
discharge  
This multi-modal pain regimen is a requirement for all  subjects in the study and is not subject  
to investigator  discretion.  The date, time, and dose of  all standardized  multimodal  pain 
medications  administered  must be recorded. Note: The scheduled PO medication  will be 
administered  on a q6h schedule only through hospital discharge.  
Rescue Medication : Subjects should only receive opioid rescue pain medication  upon request for  
breakthrough  pain. Postsurgical  rescue medication  will comprise PO immediate -release 
oxycodone (initiated at 5 -10 mg every 4 hours [q4h]  or as needed [PRN]). If a subject is unable  
to tolerate PO medication  or fails the PO oxycodone  rescue, IV morphine  (initiated at 1-2 mg) or 
hydromorphone  (initiated at 0.3 -0.5 mg) may be administered  q4h or PRN. All surgical and  
postsurgical  opioid and other analgesics (pain medications) administered must be documented  
through Day 14 postsurgery. Additionally, an unscheduled pain intensity score using a 10-cm 
visual analog scale (VAS; see Appendix  1) must be completed  immediately  prior to any rescue  
medication while in the hospital. 
Permitted  medications  for the prevention  and treatment  of possible medication  side effects 
include the following and may be administered  at the discretion of t he study site principal  
investigator:  
• Ondansetron 4 mg IV immediately after delivery of the baby. 
• Ondansetron 4 mg IV (should not exceed a maximum  of 12 mg in a 24 -hour period) for  
intraoperative and postoperative nausea and vomiting 
• Metoclopramide  10 mg PO PRN for nausea and vomiting 
• Nalbuphine  IV 2.5 mg PRN for pruritus 
• Naloxone  IV 50-100 mcg PRN  for pruritus. 
Postsurgical Assessments  
Subjects will remain in the hospital for up to 72  hours after surgery.  Postsurgical assessments  
will include: 
• Opioid use  
• Time of first unassisted ambulation  
• Pain intensity scores at rest  using a 10-cm VAS (see Appendix  1) 
• Discharge  readiness (see Appendix  2) 
• Subject’s satisfaction with postsurgical pain control (see Appendix  3) 
• Overall benefit of anesthesia score  (OBAS) questionnaire  (see Appendix  4) 
• The Quality of recovery 15-item questionnaire  (QoR-15; see Appendix  5) 
A phone call will be made to each subject on Day 14 for safety purposes and to inquire as to  
whether the subject made any unscheduled phone calls or office visits related to pain;

experienced  any hospital readmission;  or experienced an emergency  room visit since hospital  
discharge.  Adverse events and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be recorded from the time the 
ICF is signed through Day 14.  Any concomitant  medications  to treat AEs  through Day 14 will  
also be recorded.  
9.1.1. Duration  of the Study and Subject Participation  
Participation  will begin at the signing of the ICF.  No more than 7 30 days should pass between  
signing of the ICF and performance  of the surgery.  The time from study drug administration  
through the end of participation  is 14 ± 3 days.  Therefore,  subjects may participate  in the study 
for up to 44 47 days. 
9.1.2. Study Stopping  Rules 
If Pacira, the investigator,  or officials from  regulatory authorities discover conditions  during the 
study that indicate that the study or study site should be terminated,  this action may be taken 
after Pacira has consulted  with appropriate regulatory authorities  and notified the  investigator(s).  
The Pacira Medical Monitor and Pharmacovigilance  team review all SAEs reported from  Pacira 
clinical studies on an ongoing basis and in real time (ie, as the events are reported).  The Medical 
Monitor is responsible  for temporarily halting  the study if the type, frequency, or  
seriousness /severity of such events suggests a potential  threat to the safety of the study 
participants.  If such action is taken, a thorough review of all available data will be conducted.  
Based on the results of this review and discussions with investigators  and/or regulatory  
authorities as warranted, the study may be restarted  or permanently terminated.  
In addition, any death will be thoroughly reviewed and appropriate action taken.  
9.2. Discussion  of Study Design 
EXPAREL is approved for infiltration  into a surgical wound.  This Phase -4, multicenter,  
double-blind study will evaluate the efficacy and  safety of EXPAREL+bupivacaine  infiltration  
into the TAP compared  to active bupivacaine infilt ration into the TAP following  bupivacaine  
HCl spinal anesthesia  in subjects undergoing elective C -section. The double -blind study design  
is intended to avoid potential bias resulting from subject or investigator  knowledge of the  
assigned treatment.  
The physiology of pain involves multiple complex pathways  and mechanisms and the successful  
management  of pain requires the use of a combination of pain medications  in a “balanced” or  
multimodal approach to achieve a state of balanced analgesia (White 2010).  
The practice  of multimodal  analgesia is being adopted across different  patient-care pathways and 
is becoming  the standard of care at major surgery centers globally. There is quite a variety of 
options of  medications  within the multimodal  approach either in different combinations  or when 
used alone. In all cases, the goal is to reduce postoperative pain associated with surgery and

reduce opioid use and opioid-related adverse events. In some cases, such an approach may also 
reduce the average length of hospital stay (Elvir-Lazo 2010). 
EXPAREL  (liposomal bupivacaine)  is an amide local anesthetic  indicated for single -dose 
infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical  analgesia.  This study is designed to 
assess the effectiveness of EXPAREL  administered  as a TAP in a multimodal  setting to reduce 
total postsurgical opioid consumption.  All subjects in the study will be eligible to receive an 
opioid analgesic,  if needed, to control breakthrough  postsurgical  pain as part of the multimodal  
approach to pain management.  
10. STUDY POPULATION  
Note: Based  on the World Health Organization’s  Guidance: Breastfeeding  and Maternal 
Medication,  Recommendations  for Drugs in the Eleventh WHO Model List of Essential Drugs  
(WHO 2002), bupivacaine is compatible  with breastfeeding  and, therefore,  there are no 
restrictions  in this study regarding the participation of women who wish to breastfeed following  
treatment with study drug.  
10.1. Inclusion  Criteria 
Subjects eligible for study entry will meet all of the following  criteria: 
1. Females 18 years of age and older at screening.  
2. Term pregnancies  of 37 to 42 weeks gestation,  scheduled to undergo  elective C -section. 
3. ASA physical status 1, 2, or 3.  
4. Able to provid e informed consent, adhere  to the study visit schedule, and complete all 
study assessments.  
10.2. Exclusion  Criteria 
A subject will not be eligible for the study if  she meets any one of the following  criteria: 
1. Subjects who, in the opinion of  the investigator,  have a high-risk pregnancy (eg, multiple 
gestations,  pregnancy  resulting from in vitro fertilization, gestational diabetes).  
2. Subjects with a pregnancy -induced medical condition  or complication (eg, hypertension, 
pre-eclampsia,  chorioamnionitis).  
3. Subjects with 3 or more prior C-sections 
4. Pre-pregnancy  body mass index >50 kg/m2 or otherwise  not anatomically  appropriate  to 
undergo a TAP block.

6. Planned concurrent surgical procedure with  the exception  of salpingo-oophorectomy  or 
tubal ligation. 
7. Severely impaired renal or hepatic function (eg, serum creatinine level >2 mg/dL 
[176.8 µmol/L], blood urea nitrogen level >50 mg/dL [17.9 mmol/L], serum aspartate  
aminotransferase  [AST] level >3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN],  or serum alanine 
aminotransferase [ALT] level >3 times the ULN.) 
8. Subjects at an increased  risk for bleeding or a coagulation  disorder (defined as platelet 
count less than 80, 000 × 103/mm3 or international  normalized ratio greater than 1.5) 
9. Concurrent  painful physical condition  that may require analgesic treatment (such as 
long-term, consistent use of opioids) in the postsurgical  period for pain  that is not strictly  
related to the surgery and which may confound the postsurgical assessments.  
10. Clinically  significant  medical disease in either the mother or baby that, in the opinion of 
the investigator,  would make participation  in a clinical study inappropriate.  This includes 
any psychiatric or other disease in the mother that would constitute  a contraindication  to 
participation in the study or cause the mother to be unable to comply with the study 
requirements.  
11. History of, suspected, or known  addiction to or abuse of illicit drug(s), prescription  
medicine(s), or alcohol within the past 2 years. 
12. Administration  of an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 elimination half -lives of 
such investigational drug, whichever is longer, prior to study drug administration, or 
planned administration of another investigational product or procedure  during the 
subject’s participation in this study 
13. Previous participation in an EXPAREL  study. 
In addition, the subject will be ineligible  to receive study drug and will be withdrawn from 
the study if she meets the following criteria during surgery:  
14. Any clinically significant  event or condition uncovered during the surgery (eg, excessive  
bleeding, acute sepsis) that might render the subject medically  unstable or complicate  the 
subject’s postsurgical  course. 
15. Receives the epidural component of CSE anesthesia during participation in the study. 
10.3. Removal  of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment  
Every reasonable  effort shall be made to maintain subject compliance  and participation  in the 
study. Reasons for discontinuation  of any subject from  the study will be recorded. 
If any clinically significant  event or condition is uncovered during the surgery (eg, excessive  
bleeding, acute sepsis) the subject should be withdrawn from study and the event or condition  
should be reported as  an AE or SAE.

EXPAREL® 402-C-411 (C-Section TAP)  
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 3 
CONFIDENTIAL  34 of 68 07-May-2018  
  
Additionally,  any subjects who receive the epidural component  of the CSE anesthesia must be 
immediately  withdrawn from  the study.  
If a subject withdraws  from the study and has an ongoing AE, every effort must be made to  
follow-up on such events until satisfactory resolution is obtained, or further follow -up is 
otherwise no longer warranted.  
10.3.1. Withdrawal  Secondary  to Adverse Events 
If a subject experiences  an AE that renders her incapable of  continuing with the remaining  
assessments,  she will be discontinued  from further participation in the study.  A final evaluation  
should be performed so that the subject’s study participation can be terminated in a safe and 
orderly manner. If such a subject discontinues  prior to hospital discharge,  all assessments  to be 
conducted at 72 hours/hospital discharge should be conducted as part of this final examination.  
If such a subject discontinues following hospital  discharge, all information  captured in the  
Patient Participant Diary should be collected and  a final telephone call for safety should be made. 
Any subject who discontinues because of an AE  should be instruc ted to notify the study  
personnel  of any abnormalities  and to come to the study site if  medical evaluation is needed and  
the urgency of the situation permits. Any subject exhibiting undesirable  side effects will receive 
appropriate  treatment at the discretion of the investigator  until resolution of the effect.  
This study involves a single infiltration  of study drug; therefore,  subjects should not be  
terminated  from the ongoing study assessments  as long as they are willing  and able to continue 
with the follow -up schedule according  to the protocol.  For emergencies  and other unscheduled  
visits to a medical facility other than the study site, medical records must be obtained by the 
investigator  and appropriate  information captured  in the subject’s case report form (CRF). 
10.3.2. Voluntary  or Study Investigator  Withdrawal  
Subjects are free to discontinue  from the study at any time, without prejudice to future treatment.  
A subject may be discontinued  from the study if she  refuses EXPAREL  infiltration  or refuses to 
comply with study procedures. Subjects should  be encouraged to complete the study safety  
assessments.   Reasons for discontinuation from  the study will be recorded.  
If a subject is discontinued by  the investigator or voluntarily  withdraws from  the study after 
receiving study drug, the subject will  be asked to complete a final evaluation  so that she can be 
withdrawn  in a safe and orderly manner. If such a subject discontinues  prior to hospital 
discharge, all assessments  to be conducted at  72 hours/hospital  discharge should be conducted  as 
part of this final examination.  If such a subject discontinues following  hospital discharge, all  
information  captured in the Participant Diary should be collected and a final telephone  call for 
safety should be made. 
After termination  from the study, the subject may be followed for safety including monitoring  of 
AEs through Day 14.

11. TREATMENTS  
11.1. Treatment  to be Administered  
There will be two treatment  groups; eligible subjects will be randomized in a blinded 1:1 ratio to 
either: 
• Group 1: EXPAREL+bupivacaine  TAP infiltration following  spinal anesthesia  
• Group 2: Active bupivacaine  TAP infiltration  following spinal anesthesia  
On Day 1, prior to the C-section, all subjects will receive a intrathecal  injection of 150 mcg 
preservative -free morphine  for spinal injection  (eg, Duramorph)  in conjunction with single -shot 
spinal anesthesia  using 1.4-1.6 mL bupivacaine  HCl 0.75% and 15 mcg fentanyl. If preservative - 
free morphine for spinal injection (eg, Duramorph)  is unavailable because of a drug shortage,  
subjects may instead receive an intrathecal injection of 75 mcg preservative -free hydromorphone  
in conjunction with single-shot spinal anesthesia  using 1.4-1.6 mL bupivacaine HCl 0.75% and 
15 mcg fentanyl. A CSE anesthesia technique may also be used provided the epidural component  
is not used. Subjects who receive the epidural component of the CSE anesthesia must be 
immediately  withdrawn from  the study.  
After delivery of the baby and prior to the TAP infiltration, a small amount of lidocaine (<2 mL) 
may be administered  subcutaneously  to form a skin wheal over the area of the needle insertion  
site.  A 2-point classic TAP block, in 2 steps  (see below), must be performed under ultrasound  
guidance and must be performed  no more than 90  minutes after skin incision closure of the C - 
section. A confirmatory  ultrasound picture or video will be taken of each side of the abdomen 
after the TAP needle position has been established and after infiltration  of study drug. 
TAP infiltration:  The TAP infiltration  includes two steps: (1) TAP needle placement  and saline  
hydrodissection  and (2) study drug mixture infiltration  into the TAP. Each step is briefly  
described below for one side of the abdomen and must be repeated on the contralateral side to  
complete the bilateral, 2 -point TAP required for the study. For complete, step-by-step 
instructions  on performing the TAP infiltration under ultrasound guidance, please refer to the 
Pharmacy  Binder. 
(1) TAP needle placement and saline hydrodissection : For subjects in both study groups, use 
ultrasound  guidance to place the TAP needle into the desired  location and use a 10-mL 
syringe pre-filled with normal saline to perform  hydrodissection of the TAP.  (Note: it is  
not necessary to use the full 10 mL of normal saline for hydodissection.)  An ultrasound  
image of the TAP needle must be captured after saline hydrodissection.  
(2) Study drug mixture infiltration  into the TAP: Subjects randomized  to the 
EXPAREL+bupivacaine  group (Group 1) will receive 30 mL of a study drug mixture 
containing 10 mL EXPAREL  (133 mg) combined  with 10 mL bupivacaine HCl 0.25% (25  
mg) and 10 mL normal saline (total mixture 30 mL) administered into the TAP.  An

ultrasound image of the TAP needle placement must be captured after study drug 
infiltration.  
Subjects randomized to the active bupivacaine  group (Group 2) will receive 30 mL of a 
study drug mixture containing  10 mL bupivacaine  HCl 0.25% (25 mg) combined  with 
20 mL normal saline (total mixture 30 mL) administered  into the TAP. An ultrasound  
image of the TAP needle placement  must be captured after study drug mixture infiltration.  
Repeat the above steps on the contralateral  side to complete the bilateral, 2 -point TAP required  
for the study.  
11.1.1. Infiltration  Instructions/Procedure  
On Day 1, prior to the C-section, all subjects will receive an intrathecal injection of 150 mcg 
preservative -free morphine for spinal injection  (eg, Duramorph)  in conjunction with single -shot 
spinal anesthesia  using 1.4-1.6 mL bupivacaine  HCl 0.75% and 15 mcg fentanyl. If preservative - 
free morphine for spinal injection (eg, Duramorph)  is unavailable due to a drug shortage , 
subjects may instead receive an intrathecal injection of 75 mcg preservative -free hydromorphone  
in conjunction with single-shot spinal anesthesia  using 1.4-1.6 mL bupivacaine HCl 0.75% and 
15 mcg fentanyl. A CSE anesthesia technique may also be used provided the epidural component  
is not used. Subjects who receive the epidural component of the CSE anesthesia must be 
immediately  withdrawn from  the study.  
The TAP infiltration includes two steps: (1)  TAP needle placement and saline hydrodissection  
and (2) study drug mixture infiltration into the TAP. Each step is briefly described below for one  
side of the abdomen and must be repeated on the  contralateral side to complete the bilateral, 2- 
point TAP required for the study. For complete, step -by-step instructions  on performing  the TAP 
infiltration under ultrasound  guidance, please refer to the Pharmacy Binder.  
(1) TAP needle placement and saline hydrodissection : For subjects in both study groups, use 
ultrasound guidance to place the TAP needle into the desired  location and use a 10-mL 
syringe pre-filled with normal saline to perform  hydrodissection of the TAP.  (Note: it is  
not necessary to use the full 10 mL of normal saline for hydodissection.)  An ultrasound  
image of the TAP needle must be captured after saline hydrodissection.  
(2) Study drug mixture infiltration  into the TAP: Subjects randomized  to the 
EXPAREL+bupivacaine  group (Group 1) will receive 30 mL of a study drug mixture 
containing 10 mL EXPAREL  (133 mg) combined  with 10 mL bupivacaine HCl 0.25% (25  
mg) and 10 mL normal saline (total mixture 30 mL) administered into the TAP.  An 
ultrasound image of the TAP needle placement must be captured after study drug 
infiltration.

20 mL normal saline (total mixture 30 mL) administered into the TAP. An ultrasound  
image of the TAP needle placement  must be captured after study drug mixture infiltration.  
Repeat the above steps on the contralateral  side to complete the bilateral, 2 -point TAP required  
for the study.  
The maximum  dosage of EXPAREL should not exceed  266 mg. Product handling and storage 
procedures  will be in accordance  with the product package insert (see also Section 11.1.2). 
11.1.2. EXPAREL  Administration  Considerations  
Because of the potential risk of severe adverse effects associated  with the administration of 
bupivacaine, the study sites must be equipped to  manage subjects with any evidence of cardiac,  
neurological, or respiratory toxicity.  
Administration  of additional  local anesthetics,  including lidocaine,  is prohibited  and no agents 
other than bupivacaine  HCl 0.25% in 20 mL are to be admixed with EXPAREL.  Lidocaine and  
other local anesthetics  are not permitted  to be locally administered  during the surgery because 
they are known to interact with EXPAREL resulting in the displacement  of bupivacaine and  
elevated plasma levels. 
EXPAREL may not be administered  to a subject if the vial has been open for more than 4 hours.  
In order to prevent EXPAREL from  settling, gently inverting and re-inverting the syringe prior  
to administration  is recommended.  
11.1.3. Intrathecal  Morphine/Hydromorphone  Administration  
Considerations  
The most serious adverse experience encountered  during administration of intrathecal  morphine/  
hydromorphone,  respiratory depression  and/or respiratory arrest,  may be severe and could 
require intervention.   Naloxone  injection and  resuscitative equipment  should be immediately  
available for administration  in case of  life-threatening or intolerable  side effects and whenever  
intrathecal  morphine/ hydromorphone  therapy is being initiated.  
Intrathecal  morphine/  hydromorphone is contraindicated in patients  with medical conditions that  
would preclude the administration  of opioids via the IV route, including  an allergy to morphine/  
hydromorphone or other opiates, acute bronchial  asthma, or upper airway obstruction.  
Morphine/  hydromorphone, like all opioid analgesics, may cause severe hypotension  in 
individuals  whose ability to maintain blood pressure is compromised by a depleted blood volume 
or a concurrent administration  of drugs, such  as phenothiazines  or general anesthetics.  
11.2. Identity of the Investigational  Products  
11.2.1. Description  of EXPAREL  
EXPAREL  (bupivacaine  liposome injectable  suspension)  is formulated as a sterile, 
non-pyrogenic,  white to off-white, preservative -free homogenous  suspension of bupivacaine  
Pacira Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. 
EXPAREL® 402-C-411 (C-Section TAP)  
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 3 
CONFIDENTIAL  38 of 68 07-May-2018  
  
encapsulated into multivesicular liposomes (the DepoFoam  drug delivery system). Bupivacaine  
is present at a nominal concentration  of 13.3 mg/mL. For the purposes of this study, EXPAREL  
will be provided in 20 mL, 1.3% (13.3 mg/mL) single-use, clear glass vials.  EXPAREL vials  
should be stored refrigerated between 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).  
11.2.2. Description  of Reference  Product 
The reference product is 20 mL bupivacaine  HCl 0.25% and 40 mL normal saline (total volume 
60 mL) administered  as an infiltration into the TAP under  ultrasound  guidance after spinal 
anesthesia.  Bupivacaine  HCl is a long-acting local anesthetic,  used for surgical anesthesia  and 
acute pain management.  It is an alternative  to NSAIDs and opioids. 
11.3. Method of Assigning  Subjects to Treatment  
11.3.1. Randomization  Scheme 
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The randomization  code will be generated by a  
centralized randomization  system, which will also  be used to communicate  subject 
randomizations to study sites. All randomized subjects  will have both a unique subject identifier 
and a unique random code identifier.  No subject or random code identifiers  will be reused once 
assigned. 
11.3.2. Randomization  Procedures  
Once a subject is identified as  being qualified for the study in accordance with the eligibility  
criteria (see Section 10.1 and Section 10.2), and is at the study site for surgery, the unblinded 
research pharmacist or designee will obtain a randomization  assignment.  The subject will be 
considered randomized  into the study once  the study treatment  assignment  is received.  
11.3.3. Replacement  of Subjects 
Subjects who withdraw from  the study before  being randomized  may be replaced.  Once 
assigned, subject numbers will not be reused; subjects enrolled to replace those who withdraw  
will be assigned a unique subject number. 
11.4. Selection  of Doses in the Study 
During the clinical development  of EXPAREL,  single doses ranging from 2 mg to 665 mg have 
been safely administered via various routes. Pharmacokinetic  studies have shown that because 
EXPAREL releases bupivacaine gradually  as the lipid structure breaks down, administration  of 
EXPAREL  266 mg results in a maximum  plasma concentration (Cmax) equivalent  to that seen 
with standard bupivacaine 100 mg.  Clinical studies have shown that for wound infiltration a  
total dose of 266 mg (20 mL) of  EXPAREL is safe and efficacious.  Based on this experience,  
the FDA-approved marketed dose of 266 mg was deemed appropriate for this study.  
Intrathecal preservative -free morphine  for spinal  injection (eg, Duramorph) is commonly used 
during C-section, usuall y at a dose between 0.1  mg and 0.2 mg (Sviggum 2106). The midpoint of

0.15 mg (150 mcg) is preferred by some anesthesiologists because it  balances duration of  
analgesia (which may be shorter with a lower  dose) and incidence of opioid-related adverse  
events such as nausea and vomiting (which may increase with  a higher dose). If preservative -free 
morphine  for spinal injection (eg, Duramorph) is unavailable because of  a drug shortage,  
preservative -free hydrom orphone may  also be used in C -section, usually at a dose  that is 50% 
lower than that for intrathecal  morphine. The study dose of 0.15 mg (150 mcg) of intrathecal  
morphine or 0.075 mg (75 mcg) of intrathecal  hydromorphone  is also supported  by a recent 
dose-finding study that sought to determine  the effective analgesic dose for 90% of patients  
(ED90) for both intrathecal morphine  and hydromorphone in patient undergoing C -section 
(Sviggum  2106). 
11.5. Blinding 
11.5.1. Blinding Procedures  
To maintain the double -blind study design,  only the unblinded  study personnel  who are NOT 
involved with protocol -specific, postsurgical assessments  may prepare and administer  the study 
drug. Staff members conducting study -specific, postsurgical  assessments and the subjects will 
remain blinded to the assigned treatment throughout  the study.  If a subject experiences an SAE,  
Pacira will only unblind the subject’s treatment if doing so is necessary  to manage the treatment 
of the SAE.  Expedited SAEs will be unblinded by Pacira for regulatory  reporting purposes.  
At each site,  only the designated  unblinded  pharmacist  will receive the unblinded randomization  
assignments  and be responsible for preparing study drug.  
Assignment  of blinded and unblinded  responsibili ties regarding the preparation of study drug  
should take into account that EXPAREL must be administered within 4 hours of opening  
the vial. Syringes containing  study drug will need to be gently inverted several times 
to re-suspend any settling of the study drug that may have occurred prior to administration.  
The individuals preparing and administering  study drug will not  be allowed to perform  any of 
the study assessments or reveal the assigned study treatment  to any other members of the study  
team at any time. The infiltration of study drug  will be recorded using the minimal amount of 
information  necessary  to avoid unblinding staff who will be participating  in blinded procedures  
(see Pharmacy Binder for additional  details). 
No crossover will be permitted  between the blinded and unblinded study site personnel  during 
the study period.  The assignment  of site monitors will also be segregated.   Blinded monitors will  
review CRFs, clinic charts, and all other study-related document s that do not disclose the 
allocation of  study treatment.  Care should be taken in recording and review of operating room  
records to not record information in an unblinded  fashion. Pharmacy or any other clinic records 
providing  unblinded  information (eg, randomization, study drug preparation, study drug  
accountability,  study drug infiltration)  will be reviewed by specialized  unblinded  monitors who 
will notify Pacira of treatment  noncompliance.

11.5.2. Unblinding  Procedures  
Subject treatment assignments should not be unblinded  during the study by blinded study 
personnel.  The investigator  will have the ability to unblind a subject through the randomization  
system if it is felt that subject safety warrants such unblinding.  However,  if possible, the 
investigator  should discuss the safety issues with the Pacira Medical Monitor before attempting  
such unblinding.  Any unblinding will be documented  through immediate notification  of the 
Pacira study team  and the investigator withi n the interactive  response technology (IRT) system 
used for randomization.  The reason for unblinding  will be documented.  Any accidental  
unblinding events (ie, through mishaps in the operating room  or miscommunication  among study  
staff) must be reported  to Pacira immediately.  
Any unblinding  performed  through the randomization system  will be recorded as a transaction  
and the appropriate  study personnel will be notified that such a transaction  occurred.  
Any incidence(s) of unblinding will be noted in the clinical study  report with a full discussion of  
the events leading to the decision to unblind. 
11.6. Prior and Concomitant  Therapy and Medications  
11.6.1. Prior Therapy and Medications  
Use of any of the following medications within the  times specified before surgery is prohibited:  
long-acting opioid medication, NSAIDs, aspirin (except for low-dose aspirin used for 
cardioprotection), or acetaminophen  within 3 days, or any opioid medication  within 24 hours.  
Initiation of  treatment with any of  the following medications is prohibited  within 1 month of 
study drug administration  or if the medication(s)  are being given to control pain: SSRIs, SNRIs,  
gabapentin,  pregabalin  (Lyrica), or duloxetine  (Cymbalta).  If a subject is taking one of these 
medications for a reason other than pain control, she must be on a stable dose for at least 1 month 
prior to study drug administration.  
11.6.2. Restricted  Therapy and Medications  During Surgery 
As described in the EXPAREL  package insert,  no agents are to be admixed with EXPAREL  
(eg, epinephrine, dexamethasone, clonidine)  other than bupivacaine.  Lidocaine and other local 
anesthetics are not permitted to be locally administered  during the surgery because they are 
known to interact with EXPAREL resulting in the displacement  of bupivacaine and elevated 
plasma levels. When a topical antiseptic  is applied to the surgical site, the solutions are  not to 
come in contact with each other (eg, the area must be dry before EXPAREL is administered).  
Upon discovering  use of any prohibited therapy and/or medication during or after surgery, the  
investigator  should document all events that led to the deviation,  write a note to file, and notify 
the Pacira Medical Monitor accordingly.

11.6.3. Permitted  Therapy or Medications after Surgery 
Patient-controlled analgesia  is not permitted.  
The following  multimodal  pain regimen will be used:  
At the time of skin incision closure ( Note: it is very important  that these be administered at the 
time of wound closure and not prior to or before the end of surgery.) 
• Intravenous  (IV) ketorolac 15 mg (1 dose) 
• IV acetaminophen  1000 mg (1 dose)  
Beginning  6 hours after skin incision closure  
• Scheduled PO acetaminophen  650 mg beginning  6 hours from the administration  of the 
single dose of IV acetaminophen at the end of surgery and then q6h f or up to 72 hours or  
hospital discharge  
• Scheduled PO ibuprofen 600 mg beginning 6 hours from the administration  of the single  
dose of IV ketorolac at the end of surgery and then q6h for up to 72 hours or hospital 
discharge  
This multi-modal pain regimen is a requirement for all  subjects in the study and is not subject  
to investigator  discretion.  The date, time, and dose of  all standardized  multimodal  pain 
medications  administered  must be recorded.  
Subjects should only receive opioid rescue pain medication upon request for breakthrough pain.  
Postsurgical rescue medication  will comprise PO immediate -release oxycodone (initiated at  
5-10 mg q4h or PRN). If a subject is unable to tolerate PO medication  or fails the PO oxycodone  
rescue, IV morphine (initiated at 1 -2 mg) or hydromorphone  (initiated at 0.3-0.5 mg) may be 
administered  q4h or PRN.  Patient-controlled analgesia is not permitted.  All surgical opioid  
and postsurgical opioid and other analgesics  (pain medications)  administered  must be 
documented  through Day 14 postsurgery.  Additionally,  an unscheduled  pain intensity score 
using the VAS (see Appendix 1) must be completed immediately prior to any rescue medication  
while in the hospital. 
Permitted  medications  for the prevention  and treatment  of possible medication  side effects 
include the following and may be administered  at the discretion of the study site principal  
investigator:  
• Ondansetron 4 mg IV immediately after delivery of the baby. 
• Ondansetr on 4 mg IV (should not exceed a maximum  of 12 mg in a 24 -hour period) for  
intraoperative and postoperative nausea and vomiting 
• Metoclopramide  10 mg PO PRN for nausea and vomiting 
• Nalbuphine IV 2.5 mg as needed PRN for pruritus  
• Naloxone  IV 50-100 mcg PRN  for pruritus.

11.7. Treatment  Compliance  
Study drug will be administered by the study staff and, thus, treatment compliance is ensured. 
11.8. Accountability  of Study Drug 
Shipment  of EXPAREL for the study will contain an investigational  drug transmittal  and receipt 
form to assist the investigator  or designee (eg, pharmacist) in maintaining current and accurate 
inventory  records.  At a minimum,  the investigator  or designee will maintain accurate records 
demonstrating  dates and units of drug received, lot numbers, subjects to whom  drug was 
administered,  and accounts of any drug destroyed accidentally or deliberately.  The investigator  
must retain vials containing  used, unused, or expired EXPAREL for return or destruction, as 
instructed by Pacira, following confirmation  of drug accountability data  by a study monitor. 
A record of  drug return or destruction  will be maintained and provided to Pacira. Inventory  
records must be readily available for inspection by the study monitor and/or appropriate  
regulatory authorities at any time. A copy of the inventory records, drug accountability  
information, and notice of return or destruction  will be returned to Pacira at the end of the study. 
Only authorized personnel ide ntified by the investigator  will have the ability to access and 
administer  the drug. 
12. STUDY ENDPOINTS  AND MEASUREMENTS  
12.1. Efficacy Measurements  
The following efficacy measurements  will be conducted at the times specified after completion  
of the last C-section wound incision stitch (ie, time of closure of the  C-section wound): 
• Date, time of administration,  and amount of all  postsurgical opioid rescue medication taken 
through Day 14.  
• Pain intensity scores at rest using  a 10-cm VAS at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, and 72  
hours (see Appendix 1) at rest and once daily  (at noon ± 4 hours) through Day 14. For pain 
intensity scores at 18, 24, 30, 36, or 42 hours, if  the subject is sleeping, do not wake her to 
assess pain. If she awakens within the assessment window (ie, 1 hour for the 18- and 24- 
hour assessments  and 2 hours for the 30 -, 36-, and 42-hour assessments), a pain score may 
be collected then.† 
• Discharge  readiness at 24, 48, and 72 hours or until the subject attains a score of 9, 
whichever occurs first. 
• Date and time of first unassisted ambulation.  
• Subject satisfaction  with postsurgical  pain control (using a 5-point Likert scale) at 72 hours  
(or prior to hospital discharge).  
• Quality of Recovery  15-item questionnaire  at 72 hours (or prior to hospital discharge).  
• OBAS questionnaire at 24, 48, and 72 hours.†

CONFIDENTIAL  43 of 68 07-May-2018  
  
• Unscheduled phone calls or office visits related to pain after  discharge  through Day 14. 
†  If a subject is discharged prior to any of the scheduled  VAS assessments collected at 6 to 
72 hours postsurgery or a scheduled OBAS assessment collected at 24 to 72 hours postsurgery,  
a member of the study site staff will contact the subject at the appropriate  scheduled times  
(ie, the time of each assessment  scheduled to be  collected that occurs after hospital discharge)  
to remind her to complete the VAS and OBAS  assessments  and to record the scheduled  
assessments in the Participant Diary. This will ensure that  for any subject discharged prior to 
72 hours, al l VAS and OBAS assessments  required for calculation  of the study endpoints  are 
captured. These phone calls will only occur if a subject is discharged prior to 72 hours.  
12.2. Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the total postsurgical  opioid consumption  in morphine  
equivalents  through 72 hours. 
The secondary  efficacy endpoints  include: 
• Time to first postsurgical opioid rescue medication  
• The VAS pain intensity scores  at rest from 6 to 72 hours 
• Percentage of opioid -free subjects through 72 hours  
Tertiary efficacy endpoints  may include (but may not be limited to): 
• Percentage  of opioid-free subjects through 24 and 48 hours.  
• The VAS pain intensity scores at rest from 6 to 12 hours, 6 to 24 hours, 6 to 48 hours, 24 to 
48 hours, and 48 to 72 hours.  
• Integrated  rank assessment using the VAS pain intensity score at rest at 24, 48, and 72  
hours and the total amount of postsurgical  opioids consumed  through 24, 48, and 72 hours  
(Silverman  1993). 
• Overall benefit of analgesia scores at each assessed timepoint.  
• Time spent in the post -anesthesia care unit (PACU).  
• Time to first unassisted ambulation.  
• Proportion  of subjects meeting Modified Postanesthesia  Discharge Scoring System  criteria 
for discharge  readiness at each assessed timepoint. 
• Overall assessment  of the subject’s satisfaction with postsurgical pain  control (using a 
5-point Likert scale) at 72 hours after surgery  (or at hospital discharge if earlier than 
72 hours).  
• Responses to the QoR -15 questionnaire at 72 hours  after surgery (or at hospital discharge if 
earlier than 72 hours).

• Number of unscheduled  phone calls or office visits related to pain from discharge  through 
Day 14. 
12.3. Safety Assessments  
Adverse events will be monitored from  the time the ICF is signed through Day 14. 
12.4. Safety Endpoints  
Incidence  of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) and SAEs will be assessed  through Day 14.  
12.5. Appropriateness  of Measures  
Endpoints  selected for this study were based on well-established  clinical measurements  used in 
peer-reviewed studies.  
13. STUDY PROCEDURES  
A time and events schedule for all study procedures  is provided in  Table 1 and Table 2. 
13.1. Instructions  for Conducting  Procedures  and Measures  
All assessments conducted after baseline will be  timed from when the last C-section wound 
incision stitch is completed  (ie, time of closure of  the C-section wound). Day 1 is defined as the 
day on which study drug is administered.  The beginning  of surgery is defined as the time of the 
first incision. The end of surgery is defined as the time of closure of the C -section wound.  
Postsurgical is defined as  after the end of surgery.  
Subjects will be hospitalized for up to 72 hours  after surgery. Postsurgical  analgesia and 
collection of  study data through hospital discharge will take place under the supervision  of study 
staff. Following  hospital discharge,  the subject will record use of pain medication, if any, in the 
Participant Diary. Additionally, the subject will record a daily (at noon ± 4 hours) 10 -cm VAS 
pain score at rest in the Participant Diary daily from hospital  discharge through Day 14. This  
assessment  should capture her average pain at rest in the prior 24 hours by assessing,  “What has 
been your average pain since your last pain assessment?” (ie, from noon on the previous day to  
the current assessment).  At the same time, the subject should  record any pain medication  
(medication  name, dose, date, and time) taken in the prior 24 hours.  
Because the Day-14 assessment is a phone call, subjects will be provided with an addressed and  
stamped envelope in which to return the Participant Diary to the investigator.  
13.1.1. Patient Binder and Participant  Diary 
The Patient Binder will be given to the subject at the first scheduled assessment  (ie, 6 hours)  
following  surgery.  While in the hospital, the subject will use the binder to record all scheduled  
VAS (ie, at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, and 72 hours) and  OBAS (ie, at 24, 48, and 72 hours) 
assessments.   She will also use the binder while in the hospital to record any unscheduled  VAS 
assessments prior to receiving rescue medication.

CONFIDENTIAL  45 of 68 07-May-2018  
  
If a subject is discharged prior to any of the scheduled  VAS assessments  collected at 6 to 
72 hours postsurgery or a scheduled OBAS assessment collected at 24 to 72 hours postsurgery,  a 
member of the study site staff will contact the subject at the appropriate scheduled times (ie, the 
time of each assessment  scheduled to  be collected  that occurs after hospital discharge) to remind 
her to complete the VAS and OBAS assessments  and to record the scheduled  assessments  in the 
Participant Diary, which will be provided to the subject at the time of hospital discharge.  This 
will ensure that for any subject discharged  prior to 72 hours, all VAS and OBAS assessments  
required for calculation of the study endpoints  are captured. These phone calls will only occur if 
a subject is discharged prior to 72 hours.  
At hospital discharge,  study personnel will use the Participant Diary to record any pain 
medication provided to the subject for home use and any prescription provided for any pain  
medication  to be filled following  discharge.   This information  should include medication  name, 
dose, and instructions for use.  
At hospital discharge,  the subject will be instructed to record a daily VAS pain intensity score 
and all pain medications taken following hospital discharge  through Day 14 in the Participant  
Diary. 
At home, the subject will assess pain intensity  at rest each day at  noon (± 4 hours). This 
assessment  should capture her average pain at rest in the prior 24 hours by assessing,  “What has 
been your average pain since your last pain assessment?” (ie, from noon on the previous day to  
the current assessment).  At the same time, the subject should record any pain medication  (date, 
time, and dose) taken in the prior 24 hours. 
13.1.2. Pain Intensity  Assessments  
Pain intensity scores at rest using a 10-cm VAS at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, and 72 hours (see  
Appendix 1) at rest and once daily (at noon ± 4 hours) through Day 14. For pain intensity scores  
at 18, 24, 30, 36, or 42 hours, if the subject is sleeping, do not wake her to assess pain. If she 
awakens within the assessment  window (ie, 1  hour for the 18 - and 24-hour assessments  and 2 
hours for the 30 -, 36-, and 42-hour assessments),  a pain score may be collected then. See Section 
13.1.1 regarding subjects discharged prior to 72 hours. 
To assess pain intensity (VAS) at rest, the subject should rest quietly in a supine or seated  
position that does not exacerbate her postsurgical pain for 3-5 minutes before entering the pain 
score. 
13.1.3. Overall Benefit of Analgesia  Score Questionnaire  
The OBAS questionnaire  (Lehmann  2010; see Appendix 4) will be completed at 24, 48, and 72 
hours. See Section 13.1.1 regarding  subjects discharged prior to 72 hours.

CONFIDENTIAL  46 of 68 07-May-2018  
  
13.1.4. Subject Satisfaction  with Postsurgical  Pain Control 
The subject’s satisfaction  with postsurgical pain control will be assessed at 72 hours (or hospital 
discharge, whichever occurs first; see Appendix 3).  
13.1.5. Discharge  Readiness  
The subject’s discharge readiness  will be assessed using the Modified  Postanesthesia  Discharge  
Scoring System criteria (Chung 1995a; Chung 1995b; see Appendix 2).  The discharge readine ss 
assessment  will be used for data collection only and is not intended to interfere with the 
investigational site’s policy for determining  when the subject should be discharged from  the 
hospital. Discharge  readiness will be assessed at 24, 48, and 72 hours or hospital discharge  or 
until the subject attains a score of 9, whichever  occurs first.  
13.1.6. Quality of Recovery  
The subject’s quality of recovery  will be assessed using the QoR-15 questionnaire  at 72 hours, 
(or hospital discharge,  whichever occurs fi rst; see Appendix 5).  
13.2. Obtaining  Informed  Consent 
Potential participants may provide informed consent up to 30 days before their scheduled  
surgery. If a subject can only be screened on the day of surgery, the consent process must be  
started at least 24 hours prior to the day of surgery in order to ensure ample time for the subject  
to review the ICF and have all her questions  answered by the investigator/study staff prior to 
providing  informed consent. Screening procedures  that are standard of care (SOC) at the 
institution may be completed  prior to written informed consent. Any screening procedures that  
are not SOC, must be completed after written informed consent is  provided and prior to surgery. 
(see Section 13.3). 
13.3. Screening/Baseline  Procedures  
Subjects will be screened within  30 days prior to surgery; screening  on the day of surgery will be  
allowed but is discouraged.  If a subject can only be screened on  the day of surgery, the informed 
consent process must still be started at least 24 hours prior to the conduct of any screening  
procedures  that are not considered  SOC at the institution  and such procedures  may not be 
performed  until written informed consent is provided  All screening  procedures  that are not SOC 
must be performed  and documented  within the  30-day time window (inclusive  of the day of 
surgery for those subjects who can only be screened on the day of surgery) as described here.  
The following screening/baseline  procedures  should be performed  within 30 days prior to  
administration  of study drug.  Screening on the day of surgery will be permitted but is 
discouraged.

14. ADVERSE  EVENT REPORTING  
Consistent  with the current regulatory guidance provided by the US CFR and the ICH GCP,  
AE and SAE are defined in Section 14.1.1 and Section 14.2.1, respectively.  
The concepts of AE and SAE represent regulatory  instruments used to evaluate and monitor the 
safety of clinical study subjects. Therefore,  these terms only apply in light of their regulatory  
definition.  The term serious, in a regulatory sense, does not necessarily  mean severe. The SAE 
concept is primarily used to identify, during the  conduct of the study, those SAEs that may 
require expedited  reporting to regulatory authorities.  
14.1. Adverse Events 
14.1.1. Definitions  
Definition  of Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward  medical occurrence associated  with the use of  
a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug  related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse 
experience)  can be any unfavorable  and unintended  sign (eg, abnormal laboratory  finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated  with the use of a drug, without any judgment  about 
causality.  An AE can arise from  any use of  the drug (eg, off-label use in combination with 
another drug) and from  any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
An AE can be any unfavorable  and unintended change in a body structure or body function. 
Adverse events include any clinically significant  deterioration  of a subject’s medical status. 
The AE may involve any organ or system  and can be represented  by the new onset or the 
deterioration of a disease, a syndrome, a symptom,  a physical sign, as well as by findings and  
results of instrumental  examinations  and laboratory tests.  Any medically relevant and untoward  
change after the subject signs the ICF, including frequency or pattern changes for a fluctuating 
condition (eg, migraine)  is considered an AE.  
An AE that occurs after the ICF has been signed and before the start of the study drug 
administration  is identified as a pretreatment AE (PTAE). An AE that occurs after the 
administration  of a study treatment  is considered a TEAE.

Definition of Adverse R eaction: Any AE caused by a  drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected  adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event. 
Definition of Suspected Adverse R eaction: Any AE  for which there is a  reasonable possibility  
that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of investigational new drug (IND) safety 
reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is  evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the AE. A suspected  adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty 
about caus ality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  Suspected adverse  
reactions are a subset of all AEs for which there is a reasonable  possibility  that the drug caused 
the event. 
14.1.2. Recording  Adverse Events 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs (ie, PTAEs and TEAEs) with an  
onset after the subject signs the ICF. For the purpose of this  study, all AEs that occur through 
Day 14 after surgery must be recorded regardless  of whether or not they a re considered related to  
study drug. Whenever  feasible, AE terms should be documented  as medical diagnoses (highest  
possible level of integration);  otherwise, the AEs should be reported separately  as individual  
signs or symptoms.  Only one AE per line should be recorded in the AE CRF; for example, an  
AE of nausea and  vomiting should be listed as two separate  events: the event of nausea and the 
event of vomiting.   If a diagnosis  is established  after symptoms  are recorded on the AE CRF, 
the diagnosis  should be recorded and the symptoms  collapsed (removed;  ie, lined through and  
initialed).  Whenever  possible, abnormal  laboratory results should  be reported as their clinical 
corollary (eg, low potassium  should be recorded as hypokalemia).  
A continuous AE with varying grades of severity  must be recorded as one AE.  The highest  
grade of severity experienced by that subject during the course of the continuous AE must be  
recorded. 
Any condition  noted before the subject signs the ICF will be listed as Medical History and is 
considered a pre-existing condition.  If a pre-existing condition changes (ie, becomes more 
severe or more frequent) at any time after the ICF is signed, or after study drug administration,  
it is considered an AE. Note: A change in treatment for a pre-existing condition  (eg, new high 
blood pressure medication),  does not necessarily  indicate an AE. 
Information  recorded on the AE CRF will include the AE term, the date and time of onset, 
severity, seriousness, relationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, action taken for  
the AE, and the outcome of the AE, including  the date and time of resolution,  if applicable.  
14.1.3. Severity of Adverse Events 
The severity of an AE must be categorized using the following guidelines:  
Mild: An AE that is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal 
discomfort  and not interfering with everyday activities.

EXPAREL® 402-C-411 (C-Section TAP)  
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 3 
CONFIDENTIAL  52 of 68 07-May-2018  
  
Moderate: An AE that is discomforting  and interferes with normal everyday 
activities.  
Severe: An AE that prevents normal everyday activities.  
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe myocardial  infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor 
medical significance (such as severe headache).  This is not the same as "serious," which is based  
on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually  associated  with events that pose a threat to a 
subject's life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory  
reporting obligations.  
14.1.4. Relationship  of Adverse Events to Study Drug 
The investigator  must assess the relationship  of the AE to study drug after careful medical 
consideration  on a case-by-case basis.  General guidelines  for determining  the AE’s causality to 
the study drug are provided below.  
Unrelated: A causal relationship between the study drug and the AE can be  
easily ruled out (eg, based on the temporal sequence, absence of a 
reasonable pathophysiological mechanism,  or direct evidence of  
actual cause).  
Unlikely: A clinical event with a temporal relationship to study drug 
administration  which makes a causal relationship improbable  and in 
which other drugs, chemicals,  or underlying  disease provide a 
plausible explanation;  
Possible: A clinical event with a reasonable time sequence to administration  
of the study drug but which could also be explained by a concurrent 
disease or other drugs or chemicals;  
Probable:  A clinical event with a reasonable time sequence to administration  
of the study drug unlikely to be attributed to a  concurrent disease or 
other drugs or chemicals and which follows a clinically reasonable  
response on withdrawal  (dechallenge); or 
Definite: The pharmacological properties  of the study drug(s) or of the  
substance  class, and the course of the AE after dechallenge and, if 
applicable, after rechallenge, and/or specific test indicate 
involvement of the study drug(s) in the occurrence/worsening of the  
AE, and no indication of other causes exists.  
14.1.5. Outcome  of Adverse Events 
The investigator will assess the  outcome of the AE  after careful medical consideration, on a  
case-by-case basis.  General guidelines  are provided below:  
Pacira Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. 
EXPAREL® 402-C-411 (C-Section TAP)  
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 3 
CONFIDENTIAL  53 of 68 07-May-2018  
  
Recovered/Resolved:  The event resolved and the subject recovered  from the AE. 
 
Recovered/Resolved  
with Sequelae:  
Not Recovered/  
Not Resolved:  The initial event resolved, but has a continuing abnormal condition  
as a result of the AE. 
At the time of last assessment, the event was ongoing, with an 
undetermined  outcome. Note: ongoing AEs are not to be considered  
resolved as a result of death. 
Recovering/Resolving : At the time of last assessment,  the event was decreasing  in 
frequency, severity, etc, and a resolution  was expected.  
Fatal: The AE directly caused death. 
Unknown:  There was an inability to access the subject or  the subject’s records  
to determine  the outcome (eg, subject withdrew consent or was  
lost to follow -up). 
14.1.6. Action Taken with Subject Because of an Adverse Event 
The investigator will provide any actions taken  regarding  the subject (eg, treatment, diagnostic  
tests, laboratory tests, or therapy) for each reported AE. 
• None 
• Medication  
• Non-pharmaceutical therapy (The specific therapy  used must be recorded in the 
CRF.) 
• Discontinued from  study 
• Other (The specific action taken must be recorded in the CRF.)  
14.2. Serious Adverse Events 
14.2.1. Definition  of a Serious Adverse Event 
Definition  of an SAE: An AE is considered  “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator  or 
Sponsor, it results in any of the following  outcomes:  
• Death1 
• A life-threatening adverse event2 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization3 
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity4 
• Congenital  anomaly/birth defect 
• Medically  significant5

Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 3 
CONFIDENTIAL  54 of 68 07-May-2018  
  
1Death: Any event resulting in a subject’s death must be reported as an SAE.  However, death,  
in and of itself, is not an AE;  it is an outcome. The cause of death is the AE. Therefore,  the 
investigator  should make every effort to obtain and document  the cause of death for all subjects 
who die during the study. If, despite all efforts, the cause of death remains unknown,  the AE 
should be documented  as an “unspecified fatal event.”  
2Life-threatening : An AE is considered  life-threatening  if, in the view of  either the investigator  
or Sponsor, its occurrence  places the subject at immediate  risk of death.  It does not include an 
AE that had it occurred in a more severe  form might have caused death.  
3Hospitalization : It should be noted that hospitalization,  in and of itself, does not represent an 
SAE.  It is the AE lead ing to the subject’s  hospitalization  that becomes “serious” when it 
requires inpatient care. Consequently,  an SAE should not be reported in case of preplanned 
hospitalizations for a pre-existing condition  that did not worsen during the study. However,  
any medical condition that delays a subject’s  discharge from  the hospital (ie, prolonged  
hospitalization) or requires the subject to be readmitted should be reported as an SAE.  
4Persistent  or significant incapacity : A substantial disruption of  a person’s ability to conduct  
normal life functions.  
5Medically  Significant : Important  medical events that may not result in death, be life- 
threatening,  or require hospitalization,  may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate  
medical judgment, they may jeopardize  the subject and may require medical or surgical  
intervention  to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medically  
significant  events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency  
room or at home, blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization,  
or the development of drug dependency  or drug abuse. 
14.2.2. Reporting  Serious Adverse Events 
Any SAE or death that occurs at any time after the subject signs the ICF through Day 14,  
whether or not related to EXPAREL, must be reported by the investigator or designee to Pacira 
Drug Safety either email (drugsafety@pacira.c om) or fax to 973 -201-0649 within 24 hours of  
discovery.  In addition, the Investigator or designee is encouraged  to contact the Medical  
Monitor to discuss the case, as needed. 
Investigators  should not wait to receive additional information  to fully document  the event 
before notifying Pacira Drug Safety or designee of the SAE.  The fax or email report should be  
followed by a full written summary using the SAE Form detailing relevant aspects of the SAE in  
question.  Where applicable, information  from relevant hospital records and autopsy reports  
should be obtained and all patient-identifying information  redacted prior to forwarding  to Pacira. 
In the event of a fatal or life-threatening SAE, any required follow -up must be provided to Pacira  
Drug Safety or designee immediately.  The investigator will follow  all SAEs until resolved or the 
condition  stabilizes and further follow -up is not warranted.

Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 3 
CONFIDENTIAL  55 of 68 07-May-2018  
  
If the investigator  is made aware of any SAEs after  Day 14, these should also be reported to 
Pacira Drug Safety or designee provided the SAE is considered  related to EXPAREL.  The site 
would then provide a completed SAE form  within 1 business day and the event would be 
followed until resolution, or until adequate stabilization  is met. 
15. STATISTICAL  METHODS  
A comprehensive statistical  analysis plan (SAP) will be developed for this study. 
15.1. Study Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to compare total opioid consumption through 72 hours 
following EXPAREL+bupivacaine HCl infiltration into TAP after spinal  anesthesia to active 
bupivacaine  HCl infiltration  into the TAP after spinal anesthesia  in subjects undergoing  elective 
C-section. 
15.2. Study Endpoints  
The endpoints to be assessed in this study are listed in Section 12.2 (Efficacy Endpoints) and 
Section 12.4 (Safety Endpoints).  
15.3. Determination  of Sample Size 
Sample size for this study was based Quale et al (2016). The coefficient  of variation (CV) from  
this poster was approximately 60%. Assuming a log-normal distribution  for total opioid 
consumption  with a 60% CV, 5% alpha, a 1:1  randomization  ratio, and  80% power 72 subjects 
per treatment  arm is sufficient to detect a 30%  difference between treatments.  Assuming 5%  of 
the subjects are not evaluable  a total sample size of approximately  152 subjects are needed to  
ensure 144 evaluable subjects.  
15.4. Analysis Populations  
The safety analysis set will include all subjects who receive study drug.  All analyses based on 
the safety set will be by actual treatment received. 
The efficacy analysis set will include all randomized subjects who undergo C-section. All 
analyses based on the efficacy analysis set will be by randomized  treatment regardless of  
treatment actually received. 
The per-protocol efficacy analysis set will include all subjects in the efficacy analysis set who do 
not have any important  protocol deviations.  All analyses based on the per -protocol analysis set  
will be by randomized  treatment  regardless of treatment actually received. 
15.5. Handling  Subject Dropouts  and Discontinuations  
Methods for dealing with missing data will be described in the SAP.  
15.6. Statistical  Analyses

Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 3 
CONFIDENTIAL  56 of 68 07-May-2018  
  
15.6.1. Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic  and baseline characterist ics will be summarized descriptively  by treatment  group. 
15.6.2. Study Compliance  
The percentage of subject in each  analysis set and the percentage who fail to complete the study 
(as well as the reasons for discontinuation)  will be displayed  by treatment group. 
15.6.3. Efficacy Analyses  
A comprehensive statistical  analysis plan (SAP) will be developed for this study. All efficacy 
endpoint analyses will be conducted  for the efficacy analysis set. The primary efficacy endpoint 
will also be analyzed using the per-protocol analysis set as a sensitivity  analysis. 
Summary  statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation,  minimum,  maximum)  will be shown  
for each continuous  measure of efficacy by treatment  group.  Number and percentage  of subjects  
in each category will be shown for each categorical  measure of efficacy by treatment group. For 
time to event measures of efficacy, medians and Kaplan-Meier estimates will be shown by 
treatment group. 
Baseline is defined as the last non-missing assessment  of a given endpoint prior to first dose of  
trial drug unless otherwise specified.  
All assessments will be listed in subject data listings.  
15.6.3.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The analysis of total postsurgical  opioid consumption through 72 hours will be described  in the 
SAP. 
15.6.3.2. Secondary  Efficacy Endpoints  
The analyses of the secondary  efficacy endpoints  will be described in the SAP. 
15.6.3.3. Tertiary Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
The analyses of the tertiary efficacy  endpoints will be described in the SAP. 
15.6.4. Safety Analyses  
Adverse event verbatim terms will be mapped to preferred terms and related system/organ  class 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA).  All summaries of AEs will 
include AEs  that occur after the beginning  of anesthesia.  All summaries of AEs will be based on  
the safety analysis set. Events that start prior to anesthesia  will be identified  in listings only. 
Incidence rates of AEs after the  start of anesthesia  and the proportion  of subjects prematurely 
withdrawn  from the study due to an AE will be shown for each treatment  group. Incidence rates  
will also be shown for each treatment group for study drug-related AEs after the start of

anesthesia  and by severity.  Incidence rates of  SAEs will also be shown for each treatment  group. 
All incidence  rates will be categorized  and shown by system/organ class and preferred term. 
15.7. Significance  Testing 
Significance  testing will be described in the SAP.  
15.8. Interim Analyses  
An unblinded interim  analysis will be conducted by an independent  statistician  when 
approximately  80 treated subjects under protocol  amendment 2 have completed the 72-hour 
follow-up for the primary efficacy assessments.   The objective of this interim analysis is three- 
fold: 
1. To stop the trial for futility if it is improbable to show a significant reduction in the 
primary efficacy endpoints;  
2. To stop the trial for early  success if a clear benefit is demonstrate d 
3. To allow for the possibility of increasing the study sample size if the original sample size 
assumptions  are determined  to be not viable.  
If the predictive  probability  at the current maximum sample size is less than a predetermined  
threshold,  then the trial will terminate for futility.  A group sequential stopping boundary will be  
used for the early success stopping analysis. If the trial stops early for neither success nor  
futility, predictive  probabilities  will be calculated  for the current maximum sample size (144 
treated subjects) and larger sample sizes up to 200 subjects. The sample size may be extended to  
a number that achieves higher predictive  probability of trial  success (Saville 2017). The final 
decision to stop, continue or increase the sample size will be made by Pacira. Full details and all 
thresholds  for stopping or trial expansion will be covered in a prospective  interim analysis plan  
that will become part of the study SAP.

Appendix 1:  Subject’s Reported  Pain (Visual  Analog Scale) at Rest 
Subjects will be evaluated for  pain intensity scores at rest  using the 10-cm VAS at rest at 6, 12, 
18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, and 72 hours after surgery and then once daily (at noon ± 4 hours) through 
Day 14. For pain intensity scores at 18, 24, 30, 36, or 42 hours, if the subject is sleeping, do not 
wake her to assess pain. If she awakens within the assessment window (ie, 1 hour for the 
18- and 24-hour assessments and 2 hours for the  30-, 36-, and 42-hour assessments),  a pain score  
may be collected then. 
If a subject is discharged prior to any of the scheduled  VAS assessments collected at 6 to 72 
hours postsurgery,  a member of the study s ite staff will contact the subject at the appropriate  
scheduled  times (ie, the time of each assessment  scheduled to  be collected  from 6 to 72 hours  
that occurs after hospital discharge) to remind her to complete the VAS assessment  and to record 
the scheduled  assessment  in the Participant Diary. This will ensure that for any subject 
discharged  prior to 72 hours, all VAS assessments  required for  calculation  of the study endpoints  
are captured. These phone calls will only occur if a subject is discharge d prior to 72 hours. 
While in the hospital, subjects will also record an unscheduled VAS pain score immediately  
before any requested  opioid pain medication.  
To assess pain intensity (VAS) at rest, the subject should rest quietly in a supine or seated  
position that does not exacerbate her postsurgical pain for 3-5 minutes before entering the pain 
score. 
While in the hospital, subjects are to assess, “How much pain are you experiencing  right now?” 
and a vertical mark will be placed on  the line below to indicate the level of pain experienced at 
the time of assessment.  
At home, the subject will assess pain intensity at rest  each day at noon (± 4 hours). This 
assessment  should capture her average pain at rest in the prior 24 hours by assessing,  “What has 
been your average pain since your last pain assessment?” (ie, from noon on the previous day to  
the current assessment).

Appendix  2: Discharge  Readiness  
The subject’s discharge readiness  will be assessed using the Modified  Postanesthesia  Discharge  
Scoring System  below (Chung 1995a; Chung 1995b).  
 
The discharge  readiness assessment  will be used for data collection  only and is not intended to 
interfere with the investigational  site’s policy for determining when the subject should be  
discharged  from the hospital. 
 
Discharge  readiness will be assessed at 24, 48, and 72 hours, or hospital discharge, or until the 
subject attains score of 9, whichever comes first. Once a score of 9 is reached, no further 
discharge  readiness assessments  are required

Appendix 4:  Overall Benefit of  Analgesia  Score Questionnaire  
The OBAS questionnaire  will be completed  at 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery (ie, closure of 
the C-section wound).  
Note: If a subject is discharged prior to any of the scheduled OBAS assessments  collected at 24  
to 72 hours postsurgery,  a member of the study site staff will contact the subject at the 
appropriate  scheduled  times (ie, the time of each assessment  scheduled to  be collected  from 24 to 
72 hours that occurs after hospital discharge)  to remind her to complete the OBAS questionnaire  
and to record her answers to the questionnaire in the Participant  Diary. This will ensure that for 
any subject discharged  prior to 72 hours, all OBAS assessments required  for calculation  of the 
study endpoints are captured. These phone calls will only occur if a subject is discharged  prior to 
72 hours.

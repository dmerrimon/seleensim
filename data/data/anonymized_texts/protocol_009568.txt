and
Statistical
Analysis
Plan
Study
Design
and
Setting
This
study
was
a
single-center,
prospective,
double-blinded,
randomized-controlled,
three-armed
trial
comparing
magnesium,
metoclopramide,
and
prochlorperazine
for
the
treatment
of
migraine.
This
trial
was
conducted
in
a
large,
level
1
trauma,
tertiary-care
medical
center
ED
near
Chicago,
Illinois
from
August
of
2019
through
March
of
2020.
Selection
of
Participants
Patients
greater
than
or
equal
to
18
years
of
age
presenting
to
the
ED
with
a
chief
complaint
of
migraine
or
headache
while
an
ED
pharmacist
was
present
were
eligible
for
inclusion
in
this
study.
Migraine
diagnosis
was
determined
by
an
ED
physician
after
thorough
examination
to
rule
out
migraine
mimics
or
headache
conditions
where
traditional
migraine
therapy
would
be
deemed
inappropriate.
Patients
were
required
to
have
the
ability
to
provide
informed
consent.
Exclusion
criteria
included
pregnancy,
a
stated
history
of
renal
impairment,
allergy
or
sensitivity
to
any
of
the
study
drugs,
or
receipt
of
any
of
the
study
drugs
prior
to
Enrollment.
Interventions
Following
assessment
for
study
eligibility,
patients
were
consented
by
the
ED
pharmacist.
Patients
were
randomized
to
receive
one
of
three
study
drugs
(magnesium
sulfate
2
g,
metoclopramide
10
mg,
or
prochlorperazine
10
mg)
via
computer
randomization.
Study
drug
randomization
and
preparation
was
the
responsibility
of
the
IV
room
pharmacist
who
was
not
part
of
the
study.
The
ED
pharmacists,
physicians,
and
nurses
participating
in
administration
of
the
medications
were
blinded
to
which
drug
was
selected.
Magnesium
sulfate
2
g/50
mL
D5W,
prochlorperazine
10
mg/50
mL
D5W,
or
metoclopramide
10
mg/50
mL
D5W
was
then
administered
as
an
IV
infusion
over
20
min.
Measurements
and
outcomes
The
primary
outcome
of
this
study
was
change
in
pain
from
baseline
to
30
min
after
initiation
of
infusion.
Pain
was
assessed
by
the
ED
pharmacist
using
the
11-point
Numeric
Rating
Scale
(NRS)
and
recorded
on
a
data
collection
tool.
NRS
is
a
validated
tool
commonly
used
to
measure
different
types
of
pain
[15].
Secondary
endpoints
included
change
in
pain
score
from
baseline
to
60
min
and
120
min
after
initiation
of
infusion
(as
defined
on
a
11-point
NRS),
ED
length
of
stay,
and
necessity
for
rescue
analgesia
at
any
time
following
the
study
drug
administration.
Safety
endpoints
included
monitoring
for
common
adverse
effects
related
to
the
study
drugs—primarily
hypotension,
flushing,
akathisia,
dystonia,
nausea,
vomiting,
dizziness,
drowsiness,
or
other
self-reported
adverse
effects
[16-18].
Patient
baseline
characteristics
were
also
collected,
which
included
patient-reported
past
medical
history
and
analgesic
use
prior
to
presenting
to
the
ED.
Analysis
A
sample
size
of
264
subjects
(88
subjects
per
treatment
arm)
was
calculated
to
detect
a
difference
of
1.4
points
in
the
NRS
between
groups
to
achieve
a
power
of
80%
[19].
Statistical
significance
was
defined
a
priori
as
p
<
0.05,
and
normality
was
assessed
using
the
Shapiro-Wilk
test.
Descriptive
statistics
were
used
for
nominal
data,
while
ordinal
and
categorical
data
were
evaluated
using
Mann-Whitney
U
and
Pearson's
χ2
,
respectively.
Between-group
comparisons
were
made
using
one-way
ANOVA
and
Kruskal-Wallis,
as
appropriate
for
all
continuous
data.
A
post
hoc
non-inferiority
analysis
of
the
primary
endpoint
was
conducted
using
Welch's
t-test
with
a
non-inferiority
margin
of
1.4.
Data
analysis
was
performed
through
SAS
software
for
Windows
(Version
9.4).

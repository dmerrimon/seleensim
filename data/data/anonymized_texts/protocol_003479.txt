****MAIN RESEARCH QUESTIONS, STUDY AIMS, SPECIFIC HYPOTHESES****  
1.1 Please clearly state your overall research questions and/or study aims.  
The prevalence of childhood obesity has tripled within the last twenty -five years (Skelton et al., 2009). Interventions 
targeting children are a high priority because children bear the greatest lifetime health risk from overweight and obesity 
(Ogden et al., 2007; Franks et al., 2010). Health professionals in primary care settings have the potential to reach large 
numbers of parents and children and address obesity because they have regular interactions with and are influential in the 
lives of families. Studies show that even brief advice delivered well can have a meaningful impact.  To support providers in 
this important role, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collaborated with other health organizations to develop 
recommendations for assessment, prevention, and treatment of childhood and adolescent overweight and obesit y. 
Despite the 2007 publication of these recommendations and increasing recognition of childhood obesity as a public health  
problem, rates of provision of obesity -related guidance and counseling remain low (Tanda & Salsberry , 2013), and 
research indicates that health care providers could use additional education, training, and support related to obesity 
prevention and treatment. Thus, effective strategies to support pediatric primary care providers in their efforts to interve ne 
against address childhood obesity are needed. Building off the successes achieved in their Phase I study, SIMmersion 
LLC, in collaboration with Dr. Nancy Sherwood from HealthPartners Institute , Dr. Jayne Fulkerson from the University of 
Minnesota, and Dr. Michael Fleming from Northwestern University, will expand the Phase I simulation prototype, utilizing 
feedback provided by a team of independent experts. The innovative computer -based training system with interactive 
role-play simulations will provide health care providers with much needed experiential opportunities to develop skills in 
conducting discussions with parents and children about obesity. The product’s efficacy will be evaluated in a randomized 
controlled trial (RCT); 100 pediatric, family pr actice, and nursing clinicians and trainees at various levels of experience will 
be recruited to participate. Half of the participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention group during which they 
will use the newly developed simulation product to develop their skills and half of participants will be randomly assigned to 
the wait -list control group; the primary outcome is performance in a role play with trained actors at 3 month follow -up. 
 
Primary Aim : Participants randomized to the simulation inte rvention will have higher ratings on the trained actor role play 
at 3 month follow -up relative to participants randomized to the wait -list control group.  
 
****1.  BACKGROUND & SIGNIFICANCE****  
1.2 What is the specific knowledge gap tha t the project intend s to fill? Include a brief review of past research 
in this area, numbering your citations to relevant literature as well as including them in the reference 
section # 9.1. 
Obesity in the United States is at historically high levels and is an important public  health problem (Flegal et al., 2010; 
Ogden et al., 2012a). Although increases in obesity prevalence over the last few decades have been dramatic in all age 
groups, trends among youth have been particularly alarming (Jolliffe, 2004; Ogden et al., 2006; Ogd en et al., 2010; 
Skelton et al., 2009). Currently, 16.9% of 2 - to 19 -year-old children are obese, with an additional 15% of youth classified 
as overweight (Ogden et al., 2012b). Interventions targeting children are a high priority because children bear the  greatest 
lifetime health risk from overweight and obesity.  
Unfortunately, a recent meta -analysis demonstrated that over half of parents underestimate their overweight/obese 
children’s weight status (Lundahl et al., 2014); meaning their motivation for chan ge is likely low as well. There is a critical 
need to inform parents of overweight and obese youth of obesity’s sequelae, but the increase in prevalence of childhood 
obesity has made population reach an important issue. For most people information provided  by their health care 
professionals has significant credibility, and even brief advice, if it is informed and delivered appropriately, can have a 
meaningful impact. In a study of overweight and obese adult patients, those who had weight -related communicati on with 
their healthcare providers were almost nine times more likely to believe that their weight status is damaging to their health  
(Durant et al., 2009). Obesity treatment interventions targeted toward children have been shown to be more effective than 
those for adults (Epstein et al., 1998), but these empirically supported family -based treatment programs typically require 
frequent intensive in -person visits, limiting their reach. In contrast, pediatric care providers have frequent, albeit brief, 
interac tions with families, putting them in the perfect position to provide guidance and behavioral support for prevention in 
addition to treatment. Despite the increasing recognition, focus, and research, rates of provision of obesity -related 
guidance and counse ling from primary care providers to parents remain low (Tanda & Salsberry, 2013).  
Research also indicates that health care providers could use additional education, training, and support related to 
effective communication and motivation of patients. The types of communication between providers and patients are 
important in these brief encounters. Research suggests that just talking with patients about obesity is not sufficient. 
Rather, how providers talk with patients about obesity during a health care vi sit is of critical importance. When providers 
were asked about the primary barriers to preventing childhood obesity, they indicated the lack of parent and child 
motivation, family sedentary behavior, and poor eating habits in the family (Spivack et al., 20 10). Similarly, parents of 
overweight children frequently mention child and family food preferences, resistance to change, and economic barriers to 
change (Sonneville et al., 2009). Lack of motivation and unhealthful family habits are likely to be difficul t to change and 
require specific targeted training in order to be effective. The use of motivational interviewing techniques that are patient -
centered and engaging has been associated with weight loss in adults (Pollak et al., 2010). The goal of such inter actions 
would be to raise awareness of the issues and activate parental concern and behavior change in a supportive way without 
causing undue discomfort.  But skill acquisition in this area requires more than didactic materials. Brief training limited t o 
“key talking points” may not be enough and could elicit defensiveness among parents. Thus, role -playing or interactive 
education training methods may be more effective in preparing health care providers for interactions with parents of 
overweight and obese youth.  
To meet this imminent need, we are proposing to evaluate a training system with role -play simulations to train primary 
care providers to effectively conduct discussions with parents to provide intervention for, and reduce the likelihood of 
progressi on to, childhood obesity.  
 
1.3 What preliminary results do you have that support your proposal?  
We worked with SIMmersion LLC  on a SBIR Phase 1 grant during which we developed an early version of the online 
simulation. During Phase 1, we obtained initial f eedback about the simulation from experts in the field.  
 
1.4 What is the importance of the research to the scientific community?  
The proposed training system is significant because it will ensure that the necessary skills are appropriately acquired and 
maintained by providing trainees with ample opportunities to apply knowledge and build skills while receiving ongoing 
feedback. Additionally, developing computer -based training package will provide a cost -effective solution that will allow for 
the broad di ssemination across the diverse range of student affairs personnel. By providing an effective training package 
that has the potential to broaden the number of personnel who receive training, this proposal will ensure that primary care 
providers acquire evid ence -based approaches to provide parents the education and support they need to make healthy 
lifestyle changes for their families.  
 
 
****2.  APPROACH****  
Some questions in this section do no t apply to all study designs;  please  mark Not Applicable as appropriate . 
2.1 Describe the study design (e.g., “This is a randomized controlled trial to test the effect of a guided 
imagery intervention on sleep quality”). Please see this List of Study Designs . 
The efficacy of the simulation will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT); 100 pediatric, family practice, and 
nursing clinicians and trainees at various levels of experience will be recruited to participate. Half of the participants wi ll be 
randomly assigned to the intervention group during which they will use the newly developed simulation product to develop 
their skills and half of participants will be randomly assigned to the wait -list control group; the primary outcome is 
performance in a r ole play with trained actors at 3 month follow -up. 
2.2 How are you identifying eligible subjects or records? (e.g., clinic visit, search of Epic, registry, etc.)  
 Not Applicable  
We will identify providers through the HealthPartners Medical Group and Park Nicollet clinic system from our internal 
resources and we will identify nursing students, medical students, and residents through the School of Nursing and the 
Academic Health Cen ter at the University of Minnesota. Respondents will be screened to identify initial eligibility.  
2.3  What is the study population of interest and what are the study inclusion/exclusion criteria?  
The subjects for the study are primary care pediatricians,  family practice phys icians, and nurse practitioners, as well as 
medical and nursing students and residents. These health care provid ers will be recruited from clinics within the 
HealthPartners Medical Group system, the Park Nicollet clinic system, the University of Minnesota pediatrics and family 
medicine residency program, and the University Of Minnesota School Of  Nursing . The study will include equal numbers of 
male and female subjects, all 21  years of age or older .  
Eligible if:  
21 years of age or older  
A health care provider within the HealthPartners Medical Group system or Park Nicollet clinic system OR a 
resident in the University of Minnesota pediatrics and family medicine residency program OR a student in the 
University of Minnesota nurse practitioner program  
Willing and able to participate in measurement visits and intervention activities  
See pediatric patients greater than or equal to 1/3 of their practice time  
Ineligible if:  
< 21 years of age  
Unable to ensure commitment to study measurement and intervention activities  
See pediatric patients less than 1/3 of their practice time  
 
2.4 If you are not using the entire population of interest, what is the method for obtaining a subset or sample 
of this populati on? 
X Not Applicable  
 
 
2.5 Will you need to perform “preparation for research” activities prior to consenting subjects for research?  
X No 
 Yes 
 Not 
Applicable  
 
If you answered yes above, appropriate preparation for research activities prior to consenting subjects must 
include  the following process to determine inclusion/exclusion  criteria :  
 
1) Study staff will work with the PI to determine the methods used in ident ifying potent ial subjects for the 
research. For example, this may include creating an Epic Workbench report of patients who are in the 
hospital and meet minimum criteria for the research.  
 
2) Study staff may access medical records of all potential subjects’ i dentified (i.e., Workbench) to determine 
eligibility criteria using information that already  exists in the medical record. During this process, no 
identifiable information may be recorded and any documentation made of a potential subject’s information 
that would disqualify them will be destroyed.  
 
If an eligible patient is not being cared for by the PI, study staff must approach the patient’s provider to 
determine if it is appropriate to proceed with the consent process.  
 
3) If additional testing needs to be d one to see whether a patient meets criteria for entry into the study, the PI 
or staff will need to consent the patient first.  
 
4)  If the preparation activity confirms a patient is a possible subject, PI/staff approaches the patient to begin 
the consent process.  
 
2.6 Describe the steps in your recruitment process.  
 Not Applicable  
 
1.  Recruiting in the following ways:  identify provider through the HealthPartners Medical Group and Park Nicollet clinic 
system from our internal resources. Identify pediatric and family practice residents, medical students and nursing student. 
We will also be giving presentations about the study at e xisting meetings for the various groups and interested people at 
these meetings will then proceed starting at Step 3.  
2.  Send invitation e -mail to potentially eligible providers, residents and students.  
3.  Screen for preliminary eligibility.  
4.  During the initial study visit, candidates will review and sign the consent. After the consent has been signed, the 
subject will participate in a survey and two role plays with a trained actor.  
5.  After the initial study visit is complete, the subject will be ra ndomized to either intervention or waitlist control group.     
 
2.7 Describe any interventions that are used in this study.  
 Not Applicable  
 
Educational Intervention : The educational intervention will be the online simulation training program.  Participants will be 
taught how to use the simulation during a 20 minute orientation session with a research staff person. We will use a 
mastery based approach rather than prescribing an absolute number of hours participants need to play. The criteria are  
as follows: 1) achieving a score of 90% or more on 2 out of the last 3 simulations played or 2) maximum of 8 hours of 
play, whichever comes first. After the orientation sessions, t raining sessions  will be completed by participants on their 
own. The research team will confirm remote  usage, and con tact participants by email and phone to prompt usage as 
needed. The research team anticipates that the proposed method will accommodate for participant  schedules while still 
ensuring intervention compliance.  
 
Waitlist Control Group : The control group will participate in pre - and post -test assessments of their conversational skills  
with a trained actor.  At the end of the study, the waitlist control group will be allowed to access to the simulation and the 
study team will provide training to participants upon request.  
 
2.8 Provide a brief, sequential, bullet -point description of the all the data collection activities you will conduct 
from start to finish (e.g., chart review, patient survey, follow -up visits, data pull from the electronic 
medical record, etc .) and who will conduct each. Please see our Example of Data Collection Steps . 
1. Recruitment strategies including working with HealthPartners and Park Nicollet colleagues and the University of 
Minnesota contacts in order to identify candidates. Invitatio n emails will be sent to invite providers, residents and 
students to participate in the study.  
2. The invitation email will include an initial screening survey  for eligibility. Those who are eligible will be scheduled 
for an initial study visit.  
3. Candidate wi ll complete the initial baseline measurement visit where they will review and sign the consent, 
complete a survey, and participate in two role plays with a trained actor.  
4. Subjects are randomized to either the intervention or waitlist control group.  
5. Subjec ts randomized to the intervention group will complete one 20-minute session with a study staff member  
over the phone  to learn about and practice with the simulator. Subjects will then practice with the simulator until 2 
out of the last 3 simulations they h ave conducted receive a score greater than or equal to 90 percent OR up to 8 
hours of play within the first 10 weeks. Subjects randomized to the control group will not receive any formal 
training beyond what they normally would receive.  
6. All subjects will p articipate in a follow -up evaluation visit where they will complete a survey and participate in two 
role plays with a trained actor.  
7. The control group will not receive any formal training beyond what they normally would receive during the course 
of the stu dy. The wait list control group will receive access to the online simulation after the follow -up evaluation 
visit.

2.10 Describe your plans for ensur ing data security  
All study personnel will have completed the human subjects training.   Confidentiality of study data  will be ensured by 
assigning a subject identification number to each participant. All data collected in the study will be identified by an arbit rary 
and unique subject identification number only. These data will be entered by identification number into a computerized 
database residing on a user name and password protected file -server to which only the researchers involved in the study 
will have access. No participant data will be individually identified or released to anyone other than the study investigat ors 
without specific written permission from the study participant.  
2.11. List the KEY variables that will be collected  to support the study aims outlined in item 1.1. KEY variables 
include those used for : 
1) achieving  the study aims (outcomes, predictors, potential confounders),  
2) identifying the study population ( for inclusion/exclusion criteria),  
3) describing the study population

The simulation scoring system is tailored for the obesity simulation and is based on the Simmersion team’s prior work 
using a similar standardized patione  and scoring approach.( Fleming, M., Olsen, D., Stathes, H., Boteler, L., Grossberg, 
P., Pfeifer, J. & Skochelak, S. (2009). Virtual reality skills training for health care professionals in alcohol screening and 
brief intervention. The Journal of the Ameri can Board of Family Medicine, 22(4), 387 -398). 
Each participant will complete t wo role-plays pre -intervention and two role-plays post -intervention. These will be audio -
recorded and labeled only by participant ID. Raters will be blind to condition and any p articipant identifiers .

****3.  ANALYSIS****  
3.1 Describe the statistical methods that will be u sed to address the study aims. For each aim, this will 
usually include:  
 Description of the sample used for the particular analysis  
 The variables included in the specific analysis and their role in the analysis  
 Numeric summaries computed (e.g., mean, standard deviation, proportion, correlation)  
 A summary of data exploration and presentation activities (e.g., generating scatter plots, summary tables)  
 Description of statistical tests (e.g., independent samples t -test, Mann -Whitney test), and models constructed (e.g., 
logistic regression)  
Please see our Examples of Statistical Methods . 
Describe here:  
Note:  Please reference the are a/pages  of an established protocol if you are not writing your own analysis plan.   
The attained effectiveness of the developed computer -based training program will be  demonstrated through the analysis 
of relative pre -post changes on me asures from the clinical skills assessments with standardized patients, with adjustment 
for baseline clinical skill assessment level. The clinical skills assessment data will be tested for treatment specific  
changes in conversational skills. Expected incre ases in skill levels will correspond to the skills acquisition  
objectives of the compu ter-based training simulations. Scores will be assigned to each research subject in the study for 
both pre -test and post -test sessions . To address the primary study aim regarding the efficacy of the simulation  
intervention in enhancing conversational skills , the treatment by time interaction will be quantified using a general linear 
mixed m odel approach where treatment (Simulation Intervention , Wait List  Control) w ill be a fixed between -subjects effect 
and time a fixed within -subjects effect. A dditional exploratory analyses will be conducted to examine if  the patterns of 
change are the same across individual characteristics within the sample, such as student versus practiti oner status , 
gender, and educational background  (nursing, pediatrics, family practice . 
Sample size:  
3.2 What is the estimated sample size(s) for the primary study analyses (per group for studies with different 
arms or comparison groups)?  
We will be recruit ing up to 100 participants, with the goal of enrolling 30 clinicians in practice and 70 clinicians in training. 
Of the 70 clinicians in training the goal is to enroll 35 medical students/residents and 35 nursing students.  
3.3 The sample size selected was (check all that apply):  
 Based on data likely to be available during a specific time period (often based on data available in past 
periods)  
X To conduct one or more specific analyses with adequate statistical power  
 To achieve a specified level of preci sion in one or more key estimates  
 Other (explain):  
 
3.4 Explain your choice of the sample size selection you listed above:  
Power Calculation to Estimate Sample Size : Sample size calculations for the study are based on the power to 
detect a significant improvement in scores by the intervention group on the standardized patient assessments.  
Based on our experience with the NIAAA -funded STTR alcohol and screening simulation (Fleming, 2009), both 
groups will have mean scores of 150 out of the possible 300 points, w ith a standard deviation of 50.  The 
control group is expected to show a 0.5(σ) improvement at follow -up due to standard test -retest factors such as 
familiarity.  The intervention group is 
expected to show moderate (1.0 σ) to 
strong (1.1 σ) effect.  Sample size and 
power projections are  provided in the 
figure below. The graph represents 
the power and sample size 
requirements assuming a moderate 
(1.0 σ) or strong (1.1 σ) effect size in 
the intervention group.  Assessment of 
the major hypothesis, assumi ng 
moderate efficacy, may be achieved 
with an effective sample size of 100 
total subjects (50 per treatment arm) 
and statistical power (1 -ß) of 0.70.  If 
the intervention has the expected 
strong effect, we project study power 
(1-ß) to be between 80% and 85 % 
with a sample size of 100.  
 
 
 
3.5 Describe your assumptions concerning data available for analysis (e.g. How many subjects will be 
randomized, possibly los t to follow -up or a procedure? What do you expect for  survey response rates, and 
how much  missing d ata do you expect?). Include information as it pertains to your study (human or animal).

Name of active ingredient:  aripiprazole lauroxil  
Title of study:  A Phase 3b, multicenter, randomized, double -blind study to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of aripiprazole lauroxil or paliperidone palmitate for the treatment of schizophrenia in subjects 
hospitalized for acute exacerbation  
Investigator(s):  This study  will be conducted  at multiple  sites in the United  States . 
Stud y period (years):  
Estimated date first patient enrolled: November  2017 (First Subject First Visit)  
Estimated date last patient completed: August  2019 (Last Subject Last Visit ) Phase of development:  
Phase 3b  
 
Objectives:  
Primary:  
 To evaluate the efficacy of AL-NCD initiation regimen (30 mg oral aripiprazole + 662 mg 
AL-NCD intramuscular [ IM]) followed by AL 1064  mg IM during the first 4  weeks of 
treatment of patients hospitalized for an acute exacerbation of schizophreni a. 
Secondary:  
 To compare the efficacy of AL-NCD initiation regimen followed by AL 1064  mg IM with 
paliperidone palmitate initiation dosing (PP; Invega® Sustenna®; 234 mg + 156  mg IM) 
during th e first 4 weeks of treatmen t of patients hospitalized for an acute exacerbation of 
schizophrenia  
 To evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of AL 1064  mg IM after 6  months of 
treatment with AL for schizophrenia  
 To compare the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of AL 1064  mg IM with monthly PP 156 mg 
IM after 6  months of treatment with AL or PP for schizophrenia  
Exploratory:  
 To characterize subject and caregiver centered outcomes, such as quality of life, work 
readiness, satisfaction with medication, resource utilization, and caregiver burden after 
6 months of treatment with AL or PP for schizophrenia  
Methodology: This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
AL and PP in approximately 180 subjects experiencing an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. In total, 
subjects will participate for approximately 26  weeks, including up to  1 week of inpatient screening and 
25 weeks of treatment (which includes an  initial 2 -week in patient stay) . Potential subjects will be 
evaluated for eligibility according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria at a Screening visit (up to a 7 day 
period)  and Baseline  visit prior to randomization . Prior antipsychotic medications should be discontin ued 
after screening  upon inpatient admission. Subjects will be randomized to either the AL Treatment Group 
or the PP Treatment Group and receive dosing with AL or PP.

Page 4  of 72 Number of subjects planned:  Approximately 180 subjects (90  subjects  per group)  
Main criteria for inclusion:  Men and women 18 through 65 years of age (inclusive) with a diagnosis of 
schizophrenia , who are experiencing an acute exacerbation or relapse of symptoms requiring 
hospitalization with onset less than 2  months prior to screenin g may be eligible for this study . Subjects 
must be  willing and able to be confined to an inpatient study unit for up to 3 or 4 weeks  (clinically 
dependent) . 
Investigational product, dosage, duration, and mode of administration:  
Aripiprazole lauroxil (AL) is a covalent non -ester modif ication of aripiprazole to form 
N-lauroyloxymethyl aripiprazole. The AL drug product is a white to off -white aqueous extended -release 
suspension for IM provided as single -use pre filled syringes (PFS) in a dose strength of 1064  mg every 
2 months . Aripiprazole lauroxil NanoCrystal Dispersion  (AL-NCD) is an alternative formulation of AL 
designed to provide faster dissolution than the AL formulation and is provided in single -use PFS 
containing a dose strength of 662  mg. Aripiprazole lauroxil NanoCrystal Dispersion ( AL-NCD) is 
intended as a starting dose to initiate treatment with AL. 
For subjects with no history of tolerated exposure to aripiprazole, oral test doses will be commercially 
available aripiprazole 5 mg tablets , provided in commercial packaging provided to the site by Alkermes.  
Oral aripiprazole for use in dose initiation will be aripiprazole 30  mg tablets (overencapsulated to 
maintain study blind), which will be provided in bottles to the site by Alkermes.  
On D ay 1, subjects randomized to the AL Treatment Group will receive 662  mg AL-NCD (single IM 
gluteal injection) plus IM placebo ( PBO; single IM deltoid injection) plus a 30  mg oral aripiprazole tablet. 
On Day 8, subjects will receive AL 1064  mg (single IM gluteal injection) plus IM PBO (single IM deltoid 
injection). On Days 64 and 120, subjects will receive AL 1064  mg (single IM gluteal injection), and on 
Days 36, 92, and 148 will receive  IM PBO (single IM gluteal injection ).  
Reference therapy, dosage, duration, and mode of administration: Paliperidone palmitate is available 
as a white to off -white aqueous extended -release injectable suspension for IM injection provided as a 
single -use PFS in dose strengths of 156  mg and 234  mg. 
For subjects with no history of tolerated exposure to risperidone or paliperidone, risperidone for use as 
oral test doses will be commercially available risperidone 1.0  mg tablets, provided in commercial 
packaging provided to the site by Alkermes.  
Oral PBO for use in dose init iation will be empty gelatin capsules that visually match the 
overencapsulated aripiprazole 30  mg tablets (to maintain study blind) , which will be provided in bottles to 
the site by Alkermes.  
On Day 1, subjects randomized to the PP Treatment Group will rec eive PP 234 mg (single IM deltoid 
injection) plus IM PBO (single IM gluteal injection) plus an oral PBO tablet. On Day 8, subjects will 
receive PP 156 mg (single IM deltoid injection) plus IM PBO (single IM gluteal injection). Subjects 
randomized to the PP Treatment Group will receive PP 156 mg (single IM gluteal injection) on Days 36, 
64, 92, 120, and 148.  
Duration of study:  The o verall study duration is approximately 26  weeks and includes up to 1  week of 
inpatient screening  and 25 weeks of treatment (whi ch includes an initial 2 -week inpatient stay  post 
randomization/baseline ).

Page 6  of 72  Handwriting Movement Kinematics score  
 Wrist actigraphy scores from each collection period  
Statistical methods:  
Efficacy analysis will be based on the Full analysis set ( FAS), which will include all subjects in the Safety 
population who have at least o ne postbaseline assessment of PANS S. 
The Safety population will include all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug ( AL injection, 
AL-NCD injection, 30 mg oral aripiprazole, oral PBO, PBO injection, or PP injection). Safety analysis 
will be based on the Safety population.  
Efficacy:   
Primary e ndpoint:  
The change from baseline in PANS S total score at Week 4 will be tested against no improvement  using 
the one-sample T  test for the AL and PP  Treatment  Groups separately . 
Secondary e ndpoints:  
The change from baseline in PANS S total score at Week 9 and Week 25 will be tested against no 
improvement using the one-sample T  test for the AL and PP groups separately.  
The change from baseline in PANS S total score at Week 4, Week 9 , or Week 25 will be compared 
between the two  treatment groups using an analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) with last observation 
carried forward ( LOCF ) imputation for missing data. The ANCOVA  model will include treatment group, 
baseline PANS S total score, stratification factor, and the pooled study sites as covariates.  
Other efficacy endpoints:  
The continuous outcome s (change from baseline in PANS S subscales, CGI-S) will be analyzed using the 
same ANCOVA  with LOCF  model. The time from randomization to Readiness for Discharge will be 
summarized using a Kaplan -Meier  plot. 
Safety  endpoints : 
Evaluation of safety will be based on adverse events (AEs), vital signs, clinical laboratory parameters 
(chemistry, hematology , and urinalysis ), ECGs, abnormal movement  scales scores (AIMS, BARS, and 
SAS), C -SSRS scores, ISR s, UKU -SERS -PAT  Sexual Side Effects Subscale scores, and ESS total 
scores . Reported AE terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(Med DRA) preferred terms and system organ classes. Concomitant medications will be categorized using 
the World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical ( WHO-ATC) classification system.  
Analysis of o ther subject or caregiver centered e ndpoints:  
The change from baseline at each visit in Q -LES-Q-SF total score will be summarized by treatment 
group. The Burden Assessment Score will be summarized by treatment group  or by caregiver type. The 
number and percentage of response for the modified MSQ and Wo RQ will be summarized by treatment 
group. The number and percentage of subjects who had an ER visit, arrest, or have been incarcerated will 
be summarized by treatment group. Handwriting Movement Kinematics and wrist actigraphy results will 
be summarized by t reatment group. Further analysis details will be specified in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP). 
Sample size considerations:  
No formal sample size calculations have been performed. The sample size is based on practical  and

Page 15  of 72 5. INTRODUCTION 
Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder characterized by abnormalities in the perception or 
expression of reality. Aripiprazole is a second generation, atypical antipsychotic with 
demonstrated efficacy for the symptoms of schizophrenia ( Abili fy USPI, 2017 ). Although 
aripiprazole and other antipsychotics are effective for managing schizophrenia when used 
regularly, poor adherence to oral antipsychotic treatment regimens is widespread and presents a 
major limitation to successful treatment ( Keith and Kane 2003 ). Nonadherence has been 
associated with relapse and worsening long-term functional and mental outcomes ( Ascher-
Svanum et al, 2006 ; Ascher-Svanum et al, 2010 ). Long-acting injectable ( LAI) antipsychotic 
formulations, such as risperidone (Risperdal® Consta®), pa liperidone palmitate ( PP; Invega® 
Sustenna®), olanzapine (Zyprexa® Relprevv®), and aripiprazole (Abilify® Maintena®; 
ARISTADA®), were developed to promote treatment adherence, and have been demonstrated to 
improve adherence relative to oral medication, and thus improve outcomes and reduce long term 
costs ( Kane et al, 2013 ). 
Ar
ipiprazole lauroxil ( AL; ARISTADA) is a covalently bonded, non-ester modification of 
aripiprazole to form N -lauroyloxymethyl aripiprazole. It is formulated as an extended-release 
suspension to be administered via intramuscular ( IM) injection into the gluteal or deltoid muscle. 
In clinical trials, treatment with AL demonstrated statistically significant reductions from 
ba
seline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores at Week 12, compared 
with placebo. Aripiprazole lauroxil was generally well tolerated for patients with schizophrenia 
at monthly IM dosing of 441 mg and 882 mg with the most common adverse events (AEs) being 
insom
nia, akathisia, and headache.  
Due to the delayed appearance of aripiprazole in systemic circulation following AL 
administration, treatment with AL currently requires a concurrent 21-day oral lead-in regimen 
(oral initiation regimen; ie, oral aripiprazole once daily for 21 days after AL administration) to 
e
nsure adequate pharmacological activity to cover the initial lag of aripiprazole appearance with 
the first IM injection. Aripiprazole lauroxil NanoCrystal Dispersion® (AL-NCD) is an alternative 
IM formulation of AL under investigation that has been developed for the initiation of treatment 
with AL in order to eliminate the need for the current oral initiation regimen. This study is 
desig
ned to 1) evaluate the efficacy of the AL-NCD initiation regimen followed by the 
AL 1064 mg/every 2 months dose regimen for acute symptoms of schizophrenia, and 2) compare 
the sa
fety and efficacy of AL to PP (ie, ARISTADA and Invega Sustenna). 
This s
tudy is a double-blind, 25-week evaluation of the safety and efficacy of AL or PP for the 
treatment of schizophrenia in subjects hospitalized for acute exacerbation. 
5.1. Disease Overview 
Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe mental disorder characterized by debilitating psychotic 
symptoms, physical and psychiatric comorbidities,  and increased mortality. Symptoms are 
characterized by a mix of “positive symptoms” such as hallucinations, delusions, and thought 
disorders, and by “negative symptoms” such as flat or blunted affect, poverty of speech, inability 
to ex
perience pleasure, lack of desire to form relationships, and reduced motivation ( Ame rican 
Psychiatric Association 2013 ). Effective antipsychotic medications are available to treat this

Page 16  of 72 condition; for example, in patients with schizophrenia , aripiprazole has demonstrated efficacy for 
both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia (Abilify USPI, 2017 ). Although 
aripiprazole and other antipsychotics are effective for managing schizophrenia when used 
regularly, poor adherence to oral antipsychotic treatment regimens is widespread and presents a 
major barrier to achieving optimal pharmacologic outcomes ( Keith and Kane 2003 ). 
5.2. Study Rationale 
Aripiprazole lauroxil is an injectable extended-release formulation of an atypical antipsychotic 
developed by Alkermes for the treatment of schizophrenia. Five dose regimens of AL are 
c
urrently approved by the United States ( US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the 
treatment of schizophrenia as follows: 441 mg/monthly, 662 mg/monthly, 882 mg/monthly, 
882 mg/every 6 weeks, and 1064 mg/every 2 months. 
Ar
ipiprazole lauroxil NanoCrystal Dispersion ( AL-NCD)  is an alternative IM formulation of AL 
under investigation that has been developed for the initiation of treatment with AL in order to 
e
liminate the need for the current 21-day oral initiation regimen. The AL-NCD initiation regimen 
c
omprises a single 662 mg IM dose of AL-NCD coadministered with a single 30 mg oral dose of 
a
ripiprazole. This regimen was developed based on pharmacokinetic modeling, and AL-NCD 
was found to be well tolerated when tested in a clinical study in subjects with schizophrenia. 
This stud
y is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the AL-NCD init iation regimen for 
acute symptoms followed by initiation of the 1064 mg/every 2 months dose regimen. It will also 
c
ompare the safety and efficacy of AL to PP  (ie, ARISTADA and Invega Sustenna), two atypical 
LAI antipsychotics with different mechanisms of action. Paliperidone palmitate is approved by 
the US FDA  for the treatment of schizophrenia. In multiple clinical studies, PP has been found to 
be efficacious in patients with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia ( Gop al et al, 2010 ; 
Nasrallah et al, 2010 ; Pandina et al, 2010 ). An active drug with a known efficacy profile is a 
useful comparator for evaluating new drugs while avoiding the ethical dilemmas associated with 
plac
ebo.  
Therefore, this study is being conducted to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of AL and 
PP
 in subjects hospitalized for acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. 
5.3. Dose Selection 
The AL  dose of 1064  mg IM every 2 months and the PP doses of 234 mg IM initiation and 
156 mg IM monthly were selected because they are approved doses used for the treatment of 
pa
tients with schizophrenia.  
For the AL -NCD initiation regimen, the dose of 662 mg IM coadministered with a single 30 mg 
ora
l aripiprazole dose has been shown to provide aripiprazole concentrations comparable to daily 
administration of 15 mg oral aripiprazole administered during the first 21 days of AL treatment.

Page 23  of 72 If a subject withdraws from the study for any reason, any ongoing AEs will be followed until 
resolution, until deemed stable by the Investigator, or until the subject is deemed by the 
Investigator to be lost to follow-up. If, in the opinion of the Investigator, it is necessary to 
moni
tor a subject beyond the Early Termination (ET)/End of Study (EOS) /End of Treatment 
(EOT) visit, the Follow-up period may be extended as necessary. In such instances, the Sponsor 
a
nd the Investigator will agree to an acceptable follow-up schedule. 
In the event that a subject chooses to withdraw from the study, the Investigator should make a 
reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s) for withdrawal, while fully respecting the subject’s 
rights. Randomized subjects are to be asked to return to the clinic for an ET visit. The ET visit 
should be scheduled as close as possible to the subject’s last dose, and ET assessments and will 
mimic the assessments scheduled to be conducted at Visit 11/EOT/ EOS .  
F
or subjects discontinuing early, any untoward medical condition occurring within 30 days after 
the la
st dose should be considered an AE. An unscheduled visit should be captured in the EDC 
a
nd documented in the source should the subject require a visit to the investigational site. 
If the subject fails or refuses to return to the study site, an attempt must be made to contact the 
subject by telephone in order to assess as many safety and efficacy parameters as possible. All 
data collected over the telephone must be documented and kept in the subject’s record. 
The Investigator must maintain a record of all subjects who fail to complete the study. The 
reason for study discontinuation will be documented and made on the appropriate electronic case 
report form (e CRF). If a subject is lost to follow-up, a reasonable attempt to contact the subject 
must be made and documented.

8.1. Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a  multicenter, randomized, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy and safety of AL 
a
nd PP in approximately 180 subjects experiencing an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. In 
tot
al, subjects will participate for approximately 26 weeks, including up to 1 week of inpatient 
sc
reening and 25 weeks of treatment (which includes an initial 2-week inpatient stay). Potential 
subj
ects will be evaluated at a Screening visit (up to 7 days) prior to randomization. If a subject 
doe
s not have historical exposure to aripiprazole and/or risperidone and paliperidone, test doses 
will be administered during the first 2 days of inpatient stay during the Screening period, prior to 
ra
ndomization, to assess tolerability, as described in Section 9.2.  
All su
bjects should be in an inpatient setting when discontinuing prior antipsychotic medication. 
The washout of antipsychotics would be at the discretion of the Investigator based on evolving 
clinical picture. Allowable washout period is 2 to 5 days. 
On Day 1, qualified subjects will be randomized to either the AL Treatment Group or the PP  
Treatment Group and receive dosing with AL or PP  as described in Section 9.1. Subjects will 
re
main in the inpatient study unit during the Screening period and for at least 2 weeks after 
a
dministration of the first dose of study drug on Day 1. Subjects will be discharged from the 
inpatient unit upon assessment as clinically stable and appropriate for discharge as determined by 
the Investigator. Subjects will receive their final injection of study drug on Day 148 and will be 
considered to be on treatment until Day 176. A schematic of the study design is provided in

a Subjects meeting initial screening eligibility criteria, who are not already inpatient, will be admitted to an inpatient study unit for completion of Screening visit 
assessments or as soon as possible thereafter. After randomization on Day 1, 2 weeks of inpatient hospitalization is required. Subjects are to be returned to 
outpatient status when assessed by the Investigator as safe and medically ready for discharge on Day 15. Note: With Medical Monitor approval prior to Day 15, 
the Investigator may retain the subject in the inpatient unit for up to 1 additional week (to Day 22) if the Investigator deems the subject not safe or medically 
ready for discharge on Day 15 
b Screening assessments may be conducted over 2 consecutive days (Inclusion /Exclusion eligibility criteria review must be conducted on the first day of 
screening); up to 7 days is allowed for screening to ensure availability of safety laboratory assessments, etc; however the shortest Screening period is 
recommended 
c The End of Treatment (EOT)/End of Study ( EOS ) visit is to occur 28 ± 3 days after the previous dose of IM study drug was administered (Visit 10/ Day 148). 
If a subject terminates early from the study, an Early Termination ( ET) visit should occur as close as possible to the subject’s last dose, and ET assessments and 
will mimic the assessments scheduled to be conducted at Visit 11/EOT/ EOS. For subjects discontinuing early, any untoward medical condition occurring 
within 30 days after the last dose and deemed related to study drug should be considered an AE. An unscheduled visit should be captured in the EDC and 
documented in the source should the subject require a visit to the investigational site

Page 31  of 72 d The C-VISA uses audio-digital recordings of key screening assessments as the basis for site-independent eligibility review, which includes study measures such 
as PANSS, CGI-S, and MINI v 7.0 .2 
e Information about a subject’s caregiver will be collected at screening and in the event of a change in a subject’s caregiver during the study. Caregiver Consent, 
and Intake Form can be conducted anytime within the 7 day screening period 
f Full physical examination is performed at screening and brief examination at all other time points. A symptom-driven physical examination can be completed 
at other study visits as clinically indicated 
g At screening, a urine sample for urine drug screen ( UDS) will be sent to the central laboratory for analysis (a UDS via dipstick will also be performed). A UDS 
(via dipstick) will also be performed at V2 predose. At the Investigator’s discretion, a UDS (via dipstick) may be performed at any time as an unscheduled 
assessment 
h If positive urine pregnancy test (via dipstick) at screening, serum confirmation is required. Urine pregnancy test (via dipstick) at all other applicable visits 
i Fasting laboratory assessments are performed at screening and on Day 1; all other laboratory sample collections may be performed non-fasting 
j Serology testing includes anti-human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) antibody and/or antigen, hepatitis B surface antigen, and anti-hepatitis C antibody 
k Vital signs (ie, blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and body temperature) will be measured at the time points identified in Table 4 . During screening, 
Da
y 15 , and Visit 11 (EOT/EOS/ET), all vital signs are to be measured anytime during the visit. On Day 1, blood pressure and pulse are to be measured both 
within 1 hour predose and within 2 to 4 hours postdose and respiratory rate and body temperature are to be measured within 1 hour predose. On days 8, 36, 64, 
92, 120, and 148, blood pressure and pulse are to be measured both within 1 hour predose and within 2 to 4 hours postdose, respiratory rate is to be measured 
within 1 hour predose, and body temperature is to be measured within 2 to 4 hours post . On study days when multiple doses are administered (Day 1 and 
Day 8), predose assessment timing is relative to the first dose given, and postdose assessment timing is relative to the last dose given 
l A 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG) is to be performed at the study visits identified in the schedule of assessments. On days when a subject receive s study drug, 
an ECG will be performed both before and after dosing. Predose ECG should be completed within 1 hour prior to dosing. The postdose ECG should be 
completed within 2 to 4 hours postdose. On study days when multiple doses are administered (Day 1 and Day 8), predose assessment timing is relative to the 
first dose given, and postdose assessment timing is relative to the last dose given  
m Test doses are only distributed if a subject does not have historical exposure to aripiprazole, or if a subject does not have historical exposure to risperidone or 
paliperidone. For subjects without historical exposure to aripiprazole, oral test doses will consist of 5 mg/day aripiprazole during the first 2 days of inpatient 
stay to assess tolerability. For subjects without historical exposure to risperidone and paliperidone, oral test doses will consist of 1 mg/day risperidone 
administered during the first 2 days of inpatient stay to assess tolerability. For subjects who require test doses of both aripiprazole and risperidone, the oral test 
doses should be administered 8 hours apart on the first 2 days of the inpatient Screening period (eg, administer aripiprazole test dose in the morning and 
risperidone test dose in the evening, or vice versa). 
n On study days when multiple doses are administered (Day 1 and Day 8), predose assessment timing is relative to the first dose given, and postdose assessment 
timing is relative to the last dose given 
o The injection site(s) and surrounding areas will be inspected for possible ISRs within 2 to 6 hours after last injection. During the inpatient stay, the injection 
site(s) will also be inspected daily for 2 days post-injection (ie, on Days 2 and 3 and Days 9 and 10) and on Day 15. All ISRs, whether by objective physical 
finding or subjective report, will also be recorded as AEs and will be followed until resolution

Details of the study procedures are described below. The overall schedule of assessments is 
provided in Table 3. 
8.3.1. In formed Consent 
The nature of the study and its risks and benefits will be explained to the subject and caregiver 
by the Principal Investigator or designated study personnel as outlined in Section  18.3 . 
Prior to the administration of any study-specific procedures, authorized study personnel will 
obtain written informed consent from each potential subject and caregiver. 
8.3.2. E ligibility Review 
An eligibility review using the Clinical-Validation Inventory for Study Admission (C - VISA) will  
be conducted by the Investigator at the visits specified in Table 3 using the subject inclusion 
c
riteria in Section 7.1 and exclusion criteria in S ection 7.2. Ratings will be reviewed at screening 
b
y raters employed by Bracket, with additional reviews taking place at baseline and on various 
visi
ts throughout the study according to a prespecified schedule (subject to change based on rater 
accuracy). Rater review is being carried out for providing an unbiased “second” opinion on 
critical inclusion/exclusion assessments and efficacy assessments. Additionally, other key 
eligibility criteria (including medical and psychiatric history) will be reviewed by  clinical 
surveillance team. 
8.3.3. Id entification of Informant/Caregiver 
Each subject enrolled in this study will need a reliable informant/caregiver. The caregiver will be 
re
quired to sign a caregiver ICF and may withdraw consent at any time, in which case he/she can 
no longer fill the caregiver role for this study. If a caregiver can no longer fill the caregiver role, 
he/she should be replaced if possible. If the caregiver cannot be replaced, most subjects will be 
able to continue in the study. If the subject must also withdraw from the study (eg, the caregive r 
provided transportation to the site and no other travel arrangements can be made for the subject), 
the Investigator should make a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s) for the caregiver’s 
withdra
wal, while fully respecting the caregiver’s and subject’s rights. The reason for the 
c
aregiver’s withdrawal and explanation of the subject’s discontinuation should be documented in 
the a
ppropriate e CRF.  
Information about a subject’s caregiver will be collected at screening and in the event of a 
c
hange in a subject’s caregiver during the study. Please refer to the Caregiver Intake Form 
loca
ted in Section 23. 
8.3.4. De mographics and Medical/Psychiatric History 
E
ach subject’s demographic data and medical/psychiatric history will be reviewed and 
doc
umented at the time point(s) specified in Table 3.

Page 34  of 72 8.3.5.  Resource Utilization Form 
At the time points specified in Table 3, subjects will report resource use, such as emergency 
room
 visits and criminal justice involvement, over the time specified. When available, caregiver 
re
port and medical records will be used to confirm hospitalizations. This information will be 
coll
ected in the Resource Utilization Form located in Section 24. 
8.3.6. M ini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview 7.0.2 for Schizophrenia and 
P
sychotic Disorder Studies (MINI v 7.0.2) 
The
 MINI v 7.0.2 is a clinician-administered, structured diagnostic interview, with an 
a
dministration time of approximately 15 minutes ( Sheehan et al, 1998 ). The MINI v 7.0.2 has 
be
en validated against the much longer Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Diagnoses that 
corresponds to the DSM-5. The MINI v 7.0.2 will be used at screening only as indicated in 
Ta
ble 3. The MINI v 7.0.2 is required to be done before any other diagnostic assessments at 
sc
reening. 
8.3.7. Conco mitant Medication Review 
All medications (prescription and nonprescription, including vitamins and herbal supplements) 
taken by a given subject within 30 days prior to screening through follow-up will be recorded. 
The
 Investigator will record the following data on all medications used by the subject: name, 
dose
, regimen, route of administration, start and stop dates, and the indication for use.  
8.3.8. Vital S igns 
Vital signs (ie, blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and body temperature) will be measured at 
the 
time point(s) identified in Ta ble 3 and Table 4 . Blood pressure and pulse and respiratory rate 
will be measured after the subject has been comfortably seated for at least 5 minutes. Efforts 
shoul
d be made to take all blood pressure and pulse measurements from the same arm 
(preferably the subject’s dominant arm) throughout the study. Automated measurement is 
preferred. The method of measuring body temperature for a given subject should remain constant 
throug
hout the subject’s participation in the study.

8.3.9.  Physical Examination, Body Height, and Weight 
A physical examination will be performed at the time point(s) specified in Table 3 . A f ull 
physical examination (including a neurological examination) is performed at screening and brief 
examinations (including HEENT inspection [no otoscopic or fundoscopic examination], chest 
inspection, percussion and auscultation, abdominal inspection, auscultation, and palpitation) at 
all other time points. Pelvic and rectal examinations are not required unless clinically needed and 
then would be referred. A symptom-driven physical examination can be completed at other study 
visits as clinically indicated. 
8.3.10. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram 
A 12
-lead EC G will be conducted at the time point(s) specified in Table 3. On days when 
subj
ects receive injections of IM study drug, an ECG w ill be performed both before and after 
dosing. Predose ECG should be completed within 1 hour prior to dosing. The postdose ECG 
shoul
d be completed within 2 to 4 hours postdose. On study days when multiple doses are 
a
dministered (Day 1 and Day 8), predose assessment timing is relative to the first dose given, 
a
nd postdose assessment timing is relative to the last dose given. All scheduled ECGs should be 
pe
rformed after the subject has rested quietly for at least 5 minutes in the supine position. QT 
int
ervals will be automatically corrected for heart rate by the ECG machine using QTcF. The 
ECGs will be evaluated by a central facility. Additional details regarding recording and 
evaluation of ECGs will be described in a manual provided to the study site.

Page 36  of 72 8.3.11. Injection Site Evaluation 
The injection site(s) and surrounding areas will be inspected for possible ISRs by the Investigator 
or designee at the time points identified in Table 3, within 2 to 6 hours after last injection. During 
the inpa
tient stay, the injection site(s) will also be inspected daily for 2 days postinjection (on 
Days 2 and 3 and Days 9 and 10) and on Day 15. All ISRs, whe ther by objective physical finding 
or subjective report, will also be recorded as AEs  and will be followed until resolution.  
8.3.12.
 Wrist Actigraphy 
Investigators or designees will distribute the actigraphy device at the time points identified in 
Table 3. The device is meant to be worn by each subject on the wrist of the non-dominant arm 
for a
round 14 consecutive days after it is distributed. The device will monitor and record the 
physical activity of each subject. Subjects should be instructed to wear the device at all times. 
The device should then be collected by sites at the time points identified in Table 3 and returned 
to t
he Sponsor/designee for data analysis. 
8.3.13. Structured Interviews and Questionnaires 
With regard to the structured interviews and questionnaires, when the administration of these 
ra
ting scales coincide, they should be administered in the following order: 
1. M INI v 7.0.2 
2. P ANSS 
3. C -SSRS 
4. Abnor mal movement scales (AIMS, BARS, and SAS) 
5. C GI-S 
6. R DQ 
It is important that assessments are performed in the proper order. Subject and caregiver reported 
sc
ales can be collected at any time during the visit, when applicable.  
Other assessments that are not structured interviews or questionnaires can be performed as 
ne
eded. 
8.3.13.1. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 
The PANSS is a scale used to assess positive and negative symptoms in patients with 
sc
hizophrenia ( Ka y et al, 1987 ). Patients are rated on a scale of 1 to 7 on 30 different symptoms. 
The Investigator or designee will complete the PANSS at time points identified in Table 3. The 
S
tructured Clinical Interview for the PANSS will be used to administer the PANS S. 
8.3.13.2. Abnormal Movement Scales 
Abnormal Movement Scales will include AIMS, BARS, and SA S . 
The
 Investigator or designee will complete the set of abnormal movement rating scales at time 
points identified in Table 3 . 
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK9072-A306 v 2.0 (Amendment 1.0) CONFIDENTIAL 
Page 37  of 72 After administration of the first dose of study drug, if a subject complains of extrapyramidal 
symptoms (EPS) on days when the abnormal movement scales are not scheduled to be 
pe
rformed, an unscheduled assessment should be performed. 
8.3.13.3. Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
The Investigator or designee will administer the C-SSRS according to the schedule in Ta ble 3. At 
sc
reening, the “Baseline/Screening” version will be administered (Posner et al, 2009a) , a nd at all 
other visits, the “Since Last Visit” version will be administered. For “Since Last Visit” versions, 
subj
ects should be asked to report on ideation and behavior since the last scheduled C-SSRS 
assessment (Posner et al, 2009b) . The C -SSRS should be administered by a clinician trained to 
a
ssess and manage suicidal ideation and behavior. 
8.3.13.4. Epworth Sleepiness Scale 
The ES S  is a self -reported questionnaire with 8 questions that provides a measure of a person’s 
level of daytime sleepiness ( Johns 1991 ). The ES S  assesses, on a 4-point scale (0–3), a person’s 
usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep in 8 different situations or activities. This scale will 
be completed by the subject at the time points specified in Table 3. 
8.3.13.5.
 Readiness for Discharge Questionnaire 
The RD Q is a  questionnaire used to assess a patient’s readiness for discharge, independent of 
socio-economic factors ( P otkin et al, 2005 ). The RD Q c onsists of 6 items assessing 
suicidality/homicidality, control of aggression/impulsivity, activities of daily living, medication-
taking, delusions/hallucinations interfering with functioning and global status. The 6 items 
ult
imately inform a “yes/no” indication of whether the subject is clinically appropriate for 
discha
rge. The Investigator or designee will complete the RDQ a t time points identified in 
Table 3. Subjects who are determined to be “ready for discharge” prior to Day 15 are still 
re
quired to remain inpatient until Day 15. 
8.3.13.6. Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire - Short Form 
The
 Q-LES-Q- SF is a self-reported measure used to assess the degree of enjoyment and 
sa
tisfaction experienced by subjects in various areas of daily functioning ( Stevanovic 2011 ). 
Responses are evaluated on a 5-point scale (“not at all to never” to “frequently or all the time”), 
with higher scores indicating more enjoyment and satisfaction. Subjects will complete the 
Q
-LES-Q- SF at time points identified in Table 3. 
8.3.13.7.
 Modified Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire 
The modified MSQ is a 3 -item self-reported patient satisfaction questionnaire which assesses the 
level of patient satisfaction with medication. Subjects rate their satisfaction with their current 
medic

 Udvalg for Kliniske Undersøgelser-Side Effect Self-Rating Scale - Patient, Sexual 
S
ide Effects Subscale 
The sexual functioning subscale from the UKU-SERS- PAT  contains 7 items for males and 
9 items for females ( L indstrom et al, 2001 ; Lingjaerde et al, 1987 ). Each item is rated on a 
4-point scale (0=none or doubtful, 1=present to a mild degree, 2=present to a moderate degree, 
a
nd 3=present to a severe degree). This scale will be completed by the subject at the time points 
spe
cified in Table 3.

 Burden Assessment Scale 
The Burden Assessment Scale is a 19-item scale administered to caregivers who are family or 
fr
iends (ie, nonprofessional caregivers) that focuses on specific subjective and objective 
consequences of families caring for individuals with severe mental disorders ( Reinhard et al, 
1994). Respondents are required to indicate whether they have experienced each of the types of 
burde
n ‘Not at all,’ ‘A little,’ ‘Some,’ or ‘A lot’ in the past 4 weeks. These are scored 1, 2, 3, and 
4, re
spectively. A higher score indicates more perceived burden. The Burden Assessment Scale 
will be administered to the designated caregiver at the time points identified in Ta ble 3.   
8.3.13.11. Handwriting Movement Kinematics 
A quantitative analysis of handwriting kinematics is used to evaluate effects of antipsychotic 
medication in patients with schizophrenia ( Caligiuri et al, 2009 ). The Investigator or designee 
will administer the handwriting tests to the subjects at time points identified in Table 3. 
I
nstructions will be provided separately to the site. 
8.3.13.12. Clinical Global Impression–Severity 
The
 CGI -S is a 7-point scale used to assess the rate of severity of a patient’s illness ( Gu y 2000 ). 
The Investigator or designee will complete the CGI-S scale at time points identified in Table 3. 
8.3.14.
 Laboratory Assessments 
8.3.14.1. Drug Testing 
Subjects will complete a urine drug test for illicit use of amphetamines, methamphetamines, 
MDMA, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, opioids (including oxycodone, methadone, and 
bupre
norphine), and phencyclidine at screening and baseline. Results must be negative for the 
subj
ect to be eligible for the study. Use of cannabinoids is not exclusionary but THC levels will 
be collected as part of the standard urine drug screen. Use of prescribed medications 
(e
g, benzodiazepines or opioids) that account for the positive urine drug test results are not 
e
xclusionary. Use of prescribed barbiturates must be stopped 14 days prior to Day 1. Repeat 
testing may be performed if positive urine drug test results cannot be confirmed by a history of 
presumed active substance use or use of prescribed medications.

.4. Study Requirements and Restrictions 
8.4.1. Contr aception and Pregnancy 
All male and female subjects must agree to use an acceptable method of contraception for the 
duration of the study unless they are surgically sterile or postmenopausal (see below). The 
following are considered acceptable methods of contraception: 
1. Double -barrier protection (eg, a condom with spermicide or a diaphragm with 
spermicide) 
2. I ntrauterine device  
3. Or al contraceptive pills and other hormonal methods (eg, a vaginal ring, contraceptive 
patch, or contraceptive implant); oral contraceptives should have been initiated at least 
30 days prior to screening 
S
ubjects who are abstinent are eligible, provided they agree to use an acceptable contraceptive 
method should they become sexually active. 
Subjects who are surgically sterile are exempt from the requirement to use contraception. 
Women who have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral 
salpingo-oophorectomy are considered surgically sterile. Men who have undergone a vasectomy 
are considered surgically sterile. Partner vasectomy is not considered an approved acceptable 
method of contraception for a female subject.  
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK9072-A306 v 2.0 (Amendment 1.0) CONFIDENTIAL 
Page 41  of 72 Women who are postmenopausal are also exempt from the requirement to use contraception. 
For the purpose of this study, postmenopausal is defined as the permanent cessation of 
menstruation for at least 12 months prior to screening in women who are 45 years of age or 
older. 
I
f a subject becomes pregnant while participating in the study, she will be discontinued from 
study drug immediately. The ET visit will be scheduled and the pregnancy will be reported to 
Alkermes.  Additional follow-up may be required. Pregnancies in female partners of male 
subjects should also be reported and will be followed in the same manner. 
A Pregnancy Report Form must be submitted to Alkermes via  Dr ug Safety 
(per Section 14.5) im mediately within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy, irrespective of 
whe
ther an AE has occurred. The pregnancy will be followed until completion or termination. 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for classification as a SAE , it should be 
re
ported following the SAE procedure (see Section 14.5 ). 
8.4.2. P ermitted Therapy 
Permissible potential medications to treat EPS may include benzodiazepines, antihistamines, 
be
ta-blockers, and anticholinergics. While insomnia may be treated with a variety of agents, 
short ha
lf-life benzodiazepines are preferable to longer half-life benzodiazepines due to the 
potential for lingering effects on daytime functioning and study assessments. Treatment of 
agitation and/or anxiety with benzodiazepines is permissible, but the dose should be kept as 
stable as possible throughout the study as clinically indicated, so as not to interfere with daytime 
functioning and study assessments. Use of antidepressants other than CYP inhibitors/inducers 
(S
ection 21 and Section 22)  may be continued during the study if dosage has been stable for 
30 days before Day 1 and should be kept as stable as possible throughout the study as clinically 
indi
cated.  
Therapies based upon the Clinical Investigator’s medical judgment to be in the best interest of 
the pa
tient’s safety are permissible after consultation with the Sponsor/CRO Medical Monitor.  
8.4.3. Non -medication Therapy 
Psychotherapy should not be started or changed during a subject’s participation in the study. It is 
acceptable for a subject already receiving psychotherapy to participate in the study; however, 
subjects receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy should not be enrolled. While on the inpatient 
study unit during participation in the study, initiation of augmenting psychotherapies (ie, group 
therapy) deemed by the Clinical Investigator to be of clinical benefit is discouraged, although 
standard milieu-related activities are acceptable. Partial hospitalization after discharge from the 
inpatient study unit is allowed, and the level of care after discharge from the inpatient study unit 
ult
imately should be made based on the Investigator ’s judgment. 
Therapies based upon the Clinical Investigator’s medical judgment to be in the best interest of 
the patient’s safety are permissible after consultation with the Sponsor/CRO Medical Monitor.

With the exception of those specifically prohibited, medications are allowed. In this study, the 
medications listed below are prohibited ; the Medical Monitor should be consulted regarding any 
questions on allowed and prohibited medications: 
 Use  of potent inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A or inhibitors of CYP2D6, whether as 
prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or dietary supplements, 
within 14 days before dosing and during the course of the study is prohibited 
 A list
 of common CYP3A inducers or inhibitors and CYP2D6 inhibitors is 
provided in Section 21 and Section 22, respectively. This list is not exhaustive 
 Use  of antipsychotic medications during the course of the study is prohibited. Prior 
a
ntipsychotic medications should be discontinued after screening upon inpatient 
a
dmission. All subjects should be in an inpatient setting when discontinuing prior 
antipsychotic medication. The washout of antipsychotics would be at the discretion of 
the 
Investigator based on evolving clinical picture. Allowable washout period is 
2 to 5 days 
 If administration of a psychotropic medication during a subject’s participation in 
the study is being considered (eg, an antipsychotic as rescue medication during 
the Treatment period), the Investigator must contact the Medical Monitor to 
discuss t
he appropriate course of action 
 Monoa mine oxidase inhibitors (eg, phenelzine, tranylcypromine, selegiline, 
moclobemide) are strictly prohibited  
 L ithium, valproic acid (divalproex sodium), carbamazepine and lamotrigine are not 
permitted  
 IM medications other than the study drug should be administered contralateral to IM 
study drug injections to avoid confounding safety assessments of study drug 
inj
ections sites and surrounding areas 
See Section  8.3.7 for details regarding the concomitant medication review.

For subjects with no history of tolerated exposure to aripiprazole, aripiprazole for use as oral test 
doses will be commercially available aripiprazole 5 mg tablets, provided in commercial 
pa
ckaging provided to the site by Alkermes. Oral aripiprazole tablets must be kept in a locked 
storage area before dosing and must be stored in accordance with the full prescribing information 
for aripiprazole. For all women, a urine pregnancy test will be conducted and the results must be 
negative prior to administration of aripiprazole test doses. The date and time of test dose 
administration will be recorded.  
For subjects with no history of tolerated exposure to risperidone or paliperidone, risperidone for 
use as oral test doses will be commercially available risperidone 1.0 mg tablets, provided in 
c
ommercial packaging provided to the site by Alkermes. Oral risperidone tablets must be kept in

9.5. Blinding 
This is a double-blind study; the Investigator and study site staff, subject and caregiver, Sponsor, 
a
nd CRO will remain blinded throughout the conduct of the study, with two exceptions: 
1. All st udy drugs (IM and Day 1 oral doses) will be administered in a double-blind 
fashion by a trained unblinded pharmacist (or designee) who is not involved in any 
efficacy or safety assessments of the subject 
2. The CRO unblinded Medical Monitor will monitor postbaseline prolactin values 
throughout the study (refer to Section 25 for details) and will be a resource to the 
I
nvestigator/study site staff in the event of the need for emergency unblinding 
If the Investigator deems it necessary to break the study blind in the interest of a subject’s 
medical safety, he or she must make every effort to contact the CRO/ Sponsor Medical Monitor 
before the blind is broken. If the site is unable to contact the Medical Monitor prior to breaking 
the blind, the Medical Monitor must be contacted within 24 hours following disclosure of study 
drug
 assignment.  
The Investigator is responsible for all study-related medical decisions. When the Investigator 
deems it necessary, emergency unblinding may be done without contacting a Medical Monitor. 
Any premature unblinding should be promptly documented and explained to the Medical 
Monitor. 
Breaking the blind for a single subject will not affect the blind for the remaining subjects. 
9.6. Study Drug Dose Adjustment and Stopping Rules 
Study drug doses cannot be adjusted. Subjects who meet the criteria for study drug 
disconti
nuation should be withdrawn from the study as described in Section 7.3.

4.1. Definition of Adverse Event 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject who has 
been administered a pharmaceutical product. The occurrence, which may or may not have a 
causal relationship with the investigational treatment, may include any clinical or laboratory 
change that does not commonly occur in that subject and is considered clinically significant. 
Illnesses present prior to the subject signing the ICF are considered to be preexisting conditions 
and are documented on the medical history e CRF. Pre-existing conditions that worsen during the 
study are entered on the AE eCRF. 
All out-of-range laboratory values will be deemed as clinically significant or not clinically 
significant by the Investigator. Clinically significant values will be considered AEs and will be 
recorded as such on the e CRFs. The process for the review of prolactin levels is discussed in 
S
ection 25. 
P
regnancy is not considered an AE, although a subject will be withdrawn from the study if a 
pregnancy occurs. As described in Section  8.4.1, the pregnancy, including a partner’s pregnancy, 
must
 be reported to Alkermes, and additional follow-up may be required.

Page 52  of 72 14.2. Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is any AE, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality that meets one or more of the 
following criteria: 
 R esults in death 
 I s life-threatening. The subject is at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurs. This does not include reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death 
 R equires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
 R esults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (eg, a substantial disruption of 
a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
 I s a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered to be SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed above. 
Admission to a hospital or an inpatient unit for a non-medical reason (ie, social stay admission) 
during the study in the absence of untoward medical occurrence will not be considered as an 
SAE, but will be captured as an AE. Hospitalization due to worsening of behavioral health 
re
lated issues should be reported as an SAE. 
14.3. Relationship to Study Drug 
The assessment of study drug relationship to each AE will be reported on the appropriate source 
document (and SA E form, in the event of an SAE) by the Investigator (or designated 
subinvestigator) according to his or her best clinical judgment. The criteria listed in Table 9 
shoul
d be used to guide this assessment. Please note that not all criteria must be present to be 
indicative of a particular drug relationship. All study drugs are considered “test drugs” for the 
purposes of the definitions listed in the table.

14.4. Monitoring and Recording of Adverse Events 
Adverse event data collection will begin after a subject signs the ICF and will continue until 
completion of the End of Treatment (EOT)/EOS visit (Visit 11). Any AE or SAE ha ving an 
onset after the EOT/EOS visit will not be collected or reported unless the Investigator feels that 
the e
vent may be related to the study drug. 
Subjects will be instructed by the Investigator or designee to report the occurrence of any AE. 
All volunteered, elicited, and observed AEs are to be recorded on the AE eCRFs. 
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK9072-A306 v 2.0 (Amendment 1.0) CONFIDENTIAL 
Page 54  of 72 The Investigator will assess all AEs regarding any causal relationship to the study drug 
(see Section 14.3), the intensity (severity) of the event, action taken, and subject outcome. 
The following criteria should be used to guide the assessment of intensity (severity): 
 M ild:  Causes awareness of sign or symptom, but is easily tolerated; does not interfere 
with usual activities 
 M oderate:  Causes discomfort enough to interfere with usual activities 
 S evere:  Is incapacitating; results in inability to work or perform usual activities 
All AEs will be followed until resolution, until deemed stable by the Investigator, or until the 
subject is deemed by the Investigator to be lost to follow-up. 
F
or clinical study safety reporting purposes, the most recent version of the Investigator’s 
Brochure will be used as the reference document to designate event expectedness. 
Withdrawal from the study as a result of an AE and any therapeutic measures that are taken shall 
be
 at the discretion of the Investigator. If a subject withdraws from the study for any reason, any 
ongoing AEs will be followed until resolution, until deemed stable by the Investigator, or until 
the subje
ct is deemed by the Investigator to be lost to follow-up.

In 
general, summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum 
values for continuous variables and number and percentage of subjects in each category for 
categorical variables) will be provided for evaluated variables. All individual subject level data 
will be presented as data listings. All statistical tests and confidence intervals, unless otherwise 
stated, will be two sided and will be set at alpha=0.05. 
15.2.1.
 Study Populations 
15.2.1.1. Safety Population 
The Safety population will include all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug  
(AL injection, AL-NCD injection, 30  mg oral aripiprazole, oral PBO, PBO injection, or  
PP injection). Safety analyses will be based on the Safety population. 
15.2.1.2. Efficacy Population 
The

Page 60  of 72 18. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
18.1. Ethics Review 
The study site’s IRB/IEC  must meet all relevant regulatory requirements. The study protocol and 
ICF will be reviewed by the IRB/IEC prior to enrolling subjects into the study; written approval 
from the committee must be received by Alkermes before study drug will be released to the 
Investigator. The protocol must be reapproved by the IRB/IEC upon receipt of amendments and 
annually, as local regulatory requirements require. 
The Investigator is responsible for submitting all protocol changes and SAE reports to the 
IRB/IEC according to local procedures. At a minimum, all SAEs requiring an investigational 
new drug safety report must be immediately reported. 
All relevant correspondence from the IRB/IEC will be forwarded by the respective study site to 
the Sponsor in a timely fashion. 
18.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study 
This study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the ICH Guideline E6, and all 
applicable local regulatory requirements. Good Clinical Practice is an international ethical and 
scientific quality standard used for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting studies 
involving the participation of human subjects. Alkermes is committed to complying with this 
standard to provide assurance that the rights, safety, and well-being of study subjects will be 
protected, consistent with the principles having their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
18.3. Written Informed Consent 
The Investigator (or authorized designee) at each study site will ensure that the subject (or the 
subje
ct’s legal representative) is given full and adequate oral and written information about the 
nature, purpose, and the potential and possible risks and benefits of the study. Each prospective 
subject will receive an IRB-approved ICF that summarizes the pertinent study information and 
will be given ample time to read the form and ask questions about the study. All information is to 
be provided in a language understandable to the subject and must not include any language that 
waives the subject’s legal rights. Prospective subjects must also be informed of their right to 
withdraw consent without prejudice at any time during the study. If the subject chooses to 
participate, he or she must sign the ICF before any study-specific procedures are conducted.  
All subjects will be informed of their rights to privacy and will be made aware that the study data 
will be submitted to Alkermes, the IRB, the CRO, if applicable, and to regulatory authorities for 
review and evaluation for the duration of the study and until the project has been approved for 
marketing or is withdrawn from investigation. They will also be informed that the Alkermes 
Me
dical Monitor may inspect their medical records to verify the accuracy and completeness of 
the study records and results. 
Significant changes to the protocol or product safety information may require a revision of the 
ICF, which must be reviewed and approved by the IRB and then signed by all applicable study 
participants.

An overview of study data handling and recordkeeping procedures and restrictions is provided in 
the subsequent sections; please refer to the CSA for further details. 
19.1. Data Capture 
As stated in Section  17.1, this study will use e CRF s for capturing data. All entries, corrections, 
and alterations will be made by the Investigator or other authorized study personnel. All data 
entries will be verified for accuracy and correctness by independent monitors. The electronic 
data capture system maintains a full audit trail.  
A paper copy of all laboratory reports will remain with the source documents at the study site. 
All electronic source data collected outside of the e CRF, such as e-diaries, and central 
labor
atory, central ECG, or central MRI data, will be transferred directly to electronic data 
capture or directly to Alkermes for incorporation into the final datasets. All out-of-range 
labor
atory values will be deemed as clinically significant or not clinically significant by the 
Investigator. Clinically significant values will be considered AEs and will be recorded as such on 
the e CRFs.  
Adverse events will be coded using Med DRA. Concomitant medications will be categorized 
using the WHO-ATC classification system. 
19.2. Inspection of Records 
Alkermes or its representative will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigational 
facilities for the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the study. The Investigator agrees to allow 
the Alkermes Medical Monitor to inspect the drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug 
accountability records, subject charts and source documents, and other records relative to stud y 
conduct. 
19.3. Retention of Records 
Retention and storage of all essential clinical study documents shall be governed by the terms 
and conditions of the study site’s CSA and in accordance with ICH guidelines/local regulatory 
requirements as follows: 
Essential documents should be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region, or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents should 
be retained for a longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or 
by the terms of the CS A. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the Investigator/ 
institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. 
Subjects’ medical files should be retained in accordance with the applicable legislation and in 
accordance with the maximum period of time permitted by the hospital, institution, or private 
practice.

Page 72  of 72 25. APPENDIX E: PROLACTIN BLINDING 
To prevent functional unblinding due to the known differential influence on prolactin levels 
be
tween aripiprazole and paliperidone, postbaseline prolactin levels will be blinded to 
Investigators and study site staff, Alkermes, and  (with the exception of the 
designated unblinded Medical Monitor).  
The unblinded Medical Monitor will remain blinded to treatment assignment, but will receive 
and monitor prolactin levels for all subjects throughout the study. The unblinded Medical 
Monitor will contact the Investigator when the pre-defined gender- specific threshold alerts are 
triggered (see below) to determine if the alert value is clinically significant in the Investigator’s 
opinion.   
Alert Thresholds: 
 Males: >100 ng/mL 
 F emales: >150 ng/mL 
The alert threshold may be re-evaluated when 50% of subjects have been randomized. Any 
update to the alert thresholds will not require a protocol amendment, but will be addressed via an 
administrative change memo. 
Investigators may request postbaseline prolactin levels from the unblinded Medical Monitor at 
their clinical discretion (eg, if a subject has clinical symptoms that may be related to 
hyperprolactinemia). 
Treatment assignments and prolactin levels will be shared with the Investigator at study end 
when unblinded.

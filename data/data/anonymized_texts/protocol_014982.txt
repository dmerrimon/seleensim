2. Background Information and Scientific Rationale  
 
2.1. Background Information  
The primary hypothesis of the present study is that supplementation with the Upset 
Stomach Relief test product will reduce the severi ty of the symptoms of occasional 
indigestion and heartburn.  
 
Dyspepsia , also known as indigestion,  is a common symptom with an extensive differential 
diagnosis and a heterogeneous pathophysiology. It occurs in approximately 25 percent of 
the population each year, but most affected people do not seek medical care. 
Approximately 25 percent of patients wi th dyspepsia have an underlying organic cause. 
However, up to 75 percent of patients have functional (idiopathic or non -ulcer) dyspepsia 
with no underlying cause on diagnostic evaluation. Patients with functional dyspepsia 
usually describe postprandial ful lness, early satiety,  and/or  epigastric  pain/burning. 
Symptoms may be severe enough to limit usual activities. Some patients may have nausea, 
vomiting, or heartburn; however, these symptoms are usually infrequent.  [28] The most 
common approach to treat occ asional indigestion and heartburn is to use antacids to 
neutralize what is often believed to be an overproduction of stomach acid. This acid -
blocking approach can perpetuate the problem when used over a long period of time. Acid 
blocking also has the drawb ack of causing deficiencies in certain vitamins and minerals over 
time, such as calcium. By interfering with the digestive process, an overgrowth of bacteria 
and imbalances in gut health can also worsen health states. The Upset Stomach Relief test 
product is an herbal solution with ingredients that may ease occasional indigestion and 
heartburn, while helping to strengthen the digestive tract over time. [4]  
 
There are several causes of indigestion. Acid accumulation and improper gastrointestinal 
emptying can both prompt dyspepsia. Additionally, stomach or intestinal ulcers formed by 
bacteria named Helicobacter pylori  can result in infection that ultimately wil l cause 
indigestion. Other potential causes  can be  from the intake of over -the-counter medications, 
like ibuprofen , overeating, fatty, greasy, or spicy food, alcohol, and caffeine . [5] 
 
While dietary and lifestyle changes can ease the symptoms  of indigesti on and heartburn , 
HLNatural, Inc. created  the test product  to reduce occasional indigestion and heartburn . The 
test product  is a plant -based  remedy formulated with ingredients that have  demonstrated 
9 
 efficacy  reduc ing symptoms associated with  occasional  indigestion  and heartburn . The 
product combines ingredients into an easy to consume capsule  designed to be consumed at 
the onset of symptoms or before each meal,  up to three times per day. The test product is 1) 
DGL Extract, 2) Artichoke Leaf Extract, 3) Ginger Root Extract (6% gingerols), 4) Chamomile 
(1% Apigenin), 5) Marshmallow Root Extract,  6) Capsule (Hydroxypropyl Methyl Cellulose, 
Purified Water, Carrageenan, Potassium Chloride ), , 7) Rice Hull Concen trate . Below, the  7 
ingredients of the test product are listed. All ingredients are Generally Recognized as Safe 
(GRAS) by the FDA.  
 
Upset Stomach Relief  
Active Ingredients: Licorice Extract, Artichoke Leaf Extract, Chamomile, Marshmallow  
Root, Ginger . 
 
Inactive Ingredients: Capsule (Hydroxypropyl Methyl Cellulose, Purified Water, 
Carrageenan, Potassium Chloride), Rice Hull Concentrate.  
 
The ingredients in the test product  have been included because they have demonstrated 
benefit for  digestive health. The justifications for their inclusion are briefly described here:  
 
Licorice  has a long history of traditional use in promoting digestive health. DGL is a type of 
extract of licorice in which the glycyrrhizin has been removed, which helps prevent side 
effects that can occur in some people from regular Licorice use. Scientific inve stigation into 
the mechanism of activity of DGL for providing digestive support shows that it helps in 
maintaining digestive comfort by maintaining the integrity of the protective mucosal lining 
in the stomach and intestine. It is also an anti -spasmolytic,  which helps to relax the 
intestinal wall and aid in digestive comfort. [10 , 16, 17, 18 ] 
 
Artichoke Leaf Extract  helps stimulate and aid the digestive process. Artichoke Leaf extract 
is a traditional herbal digestive bitter known to stimulate the digestive  process. Artichoke 
Leaf extract has been shown in studies to relieve occasional heartburn. [9]  
 
Marshmallow Root has a long history of traditional use for soothing mucosal membranes. 
The mucilage -rich roots of Marshmallow are thought to be responsible for  many of the 
pharmacological activities of Marshmallow. Preclinical research shows that the 
mucilaginous nature can help form a protective coating on the mucosal lining, which acts as 
a shield from irritants and exerting spasmolytic and antisecretory prope rties. [11 , 19, 20, 21, 
22] 
  
Ginger  is a spice that has long history of traditional use for digestive discomfort . Clinical 
research shows that Ginger supports health through its benefits to the immune, respiratory 
10 
 systems, aiding digestion, and promoting normal cytokine balance. Ginger works on the gut -
brain axis by supporting neurotransmission which supports gastric emptying, upper GI 
digestive comfort and intestinal motility. It exerts a gastroprotective effect and relief of 
occasional heartburn. [7, 8 , 23, 24 ] 
 
Chamomile is one of the most world -renowned herbs for promoting healthy digestion. It 
contains a phytochemical called apigenin which has a number of health -promoting benefits, 
including promoting healthy cytokine balance. Chamomile is also antispasmodic, affecting 
the muscles of the intestine and promoting digestive comfort. Additionally, stress and mood 
have been proven to affect indigestion and i n clinical studies, Chamomile has shown 
support for relaxation and healthy mood. [3, 6 , 25, 26, 27 ] 
 
2.2. Scientific Rationale  
The test product’s  formulation is based on the most promising clinical research on natural 
ingredients  that safely impact digestive health  and relieve symptoms of occasional 
indigestion and heartburn . While the evidence to support the use of these individual active 
ingredients is growing, well -designed human clinical trials showing benefit are necessary to 
demonstrate efficacy of the test pr oduct’s unique formulation .  
The present study will include a minimum of  200 participant s who suffer from the 
symptoms of mild to moderate indigestion and/or heartburn and is designed to observe the 
level of symptom reduction in this population after consu ming the test product.   
 
2.2.1.  Potential Risk  
Minimal risk is foreseen for participant s through their participation in the study. All the 
ingredients composing the test product are Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the 
FDA for daily consumption at their pr esent concentrations.  
The ingredients in th e test product have been shown to have some theoretical drug 
interactions which have been listed in the appendix.  (Appendix A ) 
Potential side -effects have been observed in high doses which are significantly greater 
than the dose of the capsules  as recommended in the instruction s for use:  
• Headache  
• Amenorrhea  
• Upset Stomach  
• Diarrhea  
• Hives  
• Difficulty breathing  
• Facial swelling  
11 
 • Drowsiness  
• Tiredness  
• Vomiting  
 
This study is determined by Sponsor and Principal Investigator to be a Minimal Risk 
Study.  
Minimal risk is defined by 45 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 46.102 (i) as follows:  
“Minimal risk means that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort 
anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily 
encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological 
examinations or tests.”  
Refer to : http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.htm#46.102  
 
 
2.2.2.  Known Potential Benefits  
Over-the-counter  and prescription remedies for occasional indigestion and heartburn 
have known undesirable side effects. Additionally, these products often contain 
additives, dyes, fillers and other unnatural or synthetic ingredients that consumers are 
looking to avoid. A s such, these consumers are seeking natural, plant -based alternatives 
for symptom relief. Research participants may benefit from the intervention by 
eliminating such unwanted side effects when treating their symptoms of occasional 
indigestion and heartburn  while achieving symptom relief.  If the intervention is shown 
to be efficacious, this would provide a viable solution  for those people who want to 
decrease their use of drugs that contain undesired ingredients. Other benefits include 
detailed surveillance  of symptoms and documentation of activities, routine medications 
and supplements that may provide participant  and their regular physician or other 
healthcare provider with useful information for diagnosis and treatment of symptoms 
should they occur.  
 
2.2.3.  Mini mization of Risks  
 
Research participants will be carefully screened to meet enrollment criteria. Participants 
meeting exclusion criteria will not be enrolled. The study participant informed consent 
will be presented with clear description of the study requ irements and opportunity to 
have questions answered before enrollment. Once an event occurs , review of symptoms 
will be ascertained at  onset,  15, 30, and 60  minutes. Reporting of adverse events will be 
reviewed routinely and in accordance with regulatory guidelines (21CFR, GCP) by the 
Principal Investigator. Participants with occurrence of worsening symptoms or adverse 
12 
 events  will be advised to stop taking th e test product,  may seek medical attention , and 
exit the study.  
 
3. Study Objectives  
The purpose of the present study is to evaluate 1) the impact of the test product on  
symptoms of occasional  indigestion  and h eartburn  in 200 adult participant s who suffer 
from occasional  indigestion and heartburn and 2) the subjective experience of these 
participants  related to general health, indigestion  and h eartburn symptoms, and personal 
experience with the test product.  
This will be evaluated based on the primary and secondary endpoints. These endpoints, the 
analysis populations, and their respective measures are described below. Further details on 
the methods for measuring the outcomes can be found in the Study Outcome Measures 
and Analysis Plan sections.  
 
 Primary En dpoint:  
 
The primary endpoint has two components, reduction in indigestion  severity and reduction 
in heartburn severity. Participants will be asked to rate each symptom  (bloating, early 
fullness during a meal, pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen, burni ng in the upper 
abdomen, pain/burning in the center of your chest, nausea, vomiting, and burping)  on a 4-
point scale at 4 time points: prior to taking the  test product, 15 , 30 , and 60 minutes  after 
taking the  test product. The improvement in symptoms from baseline will be evaluated on a 
pairwise basis separately for each component and each time point. P -values will be 
computed for the improvement. Given that indigestion can impact an individual’s quality of 
life, t he primary endpoint was chosen to see the  test product’s effects on symptoms. [1, 9, 
12] 
 
 Secondary Endpoint:  
 
Secondary endpoints will be analyzed to evaluate safety  and patient satisfaction with relief  of 
symptoms . These include:  
 
● The time to other intervention will be analyzed . 
● A longitudinal analysis will be performed for participant s who report on more than one 
incident of heartburn or indigestion.  
● Adverse events will be summarized.  
● An additional data presentation will consist of results from both Treatment and Control 
in similar studies appearing in the literature. There will be no formal statistical 
comparison of results from this study and historical studies . 
● The Net Promoter Score will be summarized and compared against outcomes .  
● Compariso n against normal behavior will use the paired sample t -test.

4. Study Design  
 
The present study will be a single site,  prospective, one arm observational study of minimal risk 
consisting of at least 200 participants  who suffer from symptoms of occasional indigestion and 
heartburn. The participants  must meet additional inclusion/exclusion criteria (see 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria). Pa rticipant s will begin taking the capsules  at the onset of indigestion 
and heartburn  symptoms. Onset is defined as the point in time the participant take s the test 
product for relief of symptoms.  When the participant decides to take the test product, they will 
report  and rate their  symptoms  on a 4 -point Likert scale  in the symptom diary prior to taking the 
test product. After consuming the test product, the participant will complete a 4-point Like rt scale 
for each symptom  at  15 minutes, 30 minutes , and 1 hour after taking the  test product. If needed 
the participant will be allowed to take  an alternative  medication an hour after taking the test 
product. If medication is taken, the participant will record this in their symptom diary.  
 
Study enrollment and management will be decentralized, where participants do not visit an 
investigator or a clinic for clinical assessment. The participants will participate in the study at home.  
All data collected fr om during this study will be reported by the participant  via eCRFs, eDiary, and 
other electronic data entries.  If a visit is required, it will be conducted via remote contact by 
telephone.  
 
4.1. Test  Product  
 
Below is the  description of the test product  and its ingredients.  
 
Upset Stomach Relief Product  
Description: Combining Deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL), Artichoke Leaf, Marshmallow 
Root, Ginger, and Chamomile for comprehensive, yet gentle plant -based support for 
occa sional indigestion  and heartburn relief . This formula is designed to promote digestion 
and feelings of digestive comfort . 
Active Ingredients: Licorice Extract, Artichoke Leaf Extract, Chamomile, Marshmallow 
Root, Ginger . 
 
Inactive Ingredients: Capsule (Hydr oxypropyl Methyl Cellulose, Purified Water, 
Carrageenan, Potassium Chloride), Rice Hull Concentrate.  
 
4.2. Required Behavior  
 
During the hour directly following consumption of the test product, no medication or 
supplementation (including all CBD products) other than the test product should be taken 
14 
 for relief of indigestion and heartburn  symptoms .  Once the 1-hour report  has been recorded  
the participant  may take other medications  or supplements . If medication  is taken, the 
participant will record this in their symptom diary.  
 
Participant s are asked to limit the consumption of alcohol beverages to less than or equal to 
two drinks per day .  
 
4.3. Participation Period  
Participants are expected to participate in the study for 60 days after study start. The 
product may be used after each onset of indigestion and heartburn  episode , but not 
exceeding three times per day. Participant s will be discontinued from the study 60 d ays 
after Study Start or after three  recorded episodes of indigestion and heartburn . Study start is 
defined as the day the participant recorded received receipt of the test product  on the start 
form in the platform . 
 
 
4.4. Data Collection  
All data in the present study will be self -reported by the participant and collected via their 
online portal (Hawthorne Effect Study Visit Management System (HE VMS) ). Participants 
will be asked to take the test product according to the instructions for use, complete stud y 
surveys and respond to study reminders during the course of the study. The instructions for 
use and study forms  can be found in the appendix.  (Appendices B, D, E, F, G ) 
 
5. Study Population  
 
5.1. Selection of the Study Population  
The study population will consist of at least 200 participants who suffer from symptoms of 
indigestion and heartburn. The participant s will otherwise be in good health.  
The target sample size for this study is initially 200 participants, with a desired sa mple of 97 treated 
participants. This is described in detail in the Statistical Considerations section.  
At such time as 180 participants have been enrolled, the available data will be analyzed 
using a constant hazard model  to determine if it seems realistic that the desired number of 
97 treated participants will be  met by the end of follow -up. If the expected number of 
treated participants is less than 97, the target sample size will be increased as needed, 
considering both the desire for 97treated participants and the timelines of the trial sponsor. 
The actual outcomes of treated  
15 
 participants will not be considered in this analysis, merely whether or not enrolled  
participants have reported starting using the test product.  
Enrollment will be stopped once the target number of participants has  been enrolled, no further 
participant s will be offered a place in the trial once the target sample size criteria has been met.   All 
participant s who have already been offered places, but  who have not yet consented, will be allowed 
to participate as long as they have signed the study consent within 15 days and the total number of 
participants does not exceed 125% of the target  (either 200 or the recomputed target if 
recomputation has been performed.)   
In order to ensure an age and sex distribution that is reasonably representative of the US 
population, enrollment may be stopped early in some age and sex groups.  
Target population for this study are candidates who suffer from symptoms of  occa sional  indigestion  
and heartburn .  
Participants  will be enrolled from across the United States. No participant s will be enrolled 
outside of the United States. It is expected that the geographical distribution of the 
participant s enrolled in the study will correlate with the geographical distribution of the 
general population across the United States.  
Participant s will be recruited via digital advertisements and social media.   
 
After clicking on an advertisement, potential participant s will then be directed to a website where 
they will complete a screening questionnaire (See Appendix C ). The screening questionnaire will 
automatically qualify or disqualify them for study participation. If the participant  qualifies, they  will 
be provided  an informed consent. Upon completion of the informed consent they will be deemed 
enrolled in the study.  
 
 
5.2. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
Prior to being enrolled, participant s will fill out a screening questionnaire. The screening 
questionnaire will automati cally qualify or disqualify them for study participation. The full 
screening questionnaire can be found in the Appendix  (Appendix C ). If the participant  
qualifies, they  will be  provided an informed consent. Upon completion of the informed 
consent they will be deemed enrolled in the study.  
Inclusion Criteria:  
Adult candidates who are in overall good health but who suffer from the symptoms of 
indigestion.  
16 
 Participant s will be deemed to be in good health if they do not report any of the existing 
medical co nditions asked about in the screening questionnaire.  
Exclusion Criteria:  
● Age <18 years old . 
● Unwilling to take test product for their symptoms . 
● Are able to swallow pills.  
● Allergy to any of the following: Licorice, Artichoke Leaf, Marshmallow Root, Ginger, 
Chamomile,  Cellulose Capsule, Rice Hull  Concentrate, Carrageenan.  
● Participant s who have been prescribed any medication by their physician for any GI 
disorder or medication that can affect the GI system.  
● Participant s with previous diagnosis of cancer or with previous surgery of the upper 
gastrointestinal tract or of the biliopancreatic system (except for cholecystectomy)  
● Pregnant women or breastfeeding . 
● Alcohol consumption more than 10 drinks per week  
● Participants who are currently using anticoagulation medications  daily . (Aspirin, 
Coumadin, Heparin etc.)  
 
6. Study Evaluati on 
 
6.1. Study Procedures  
• Candidates  will review information about the study and complete a screening form.  
• During the screening process, the candidate  will be asked questions regarding their symptoms 
and medical history to ensure that they meet the requirement s to participate in this study. 
Potential participant s will also be asked questions to ensure that they do not meet any of the 
exclusion criteria and meet all of the inclusion criteria.  
• After successful screening (participant does not meet any exclusion c riteria), participants will 
review and sign study informed consent  form .  
• Upon verification of signed informed consent, participant  will be enrolled into the study .  
• At time of enrollment, participant will be given access to the HIPAA compliant study portal.  
○ The study portal provides access to study information, signed informed consent form, 
instructions for test product use, frequently asked questions, study surveys,  symptom  diary, 
and data collection tools.  
• Participant shall complete baseline assessments upon access to the portal.  
○ Baseline assessment will include questions regarding the participants’ demographics , 
medications, detailed information regarding their indigestion/heartburn  including 
treatment.  
• To ensure that baseline assessments are completed before test product is used by the 
participant, study materials and study welcome package will be shipped to the participant  once 
the clinical study manager/clinica l ops coordinator confirms that the baseline assessment has 
been completed.  
• The welcome package will include an information sheet that will outline instructions for their 
participation in the trial, the test product, and paper forms of the documents (paper  form of 
17 
 study documents will be provided for real time data collection, in the event that the participant 
cannot log into the study portal to input data).   
• Once the participant receives the test product, the participant will log into the study portal to 
acknowledge the receipt of the test product.  
• Study start date will be  the reported date of receipt of test product.  
• Participant will be sent weekly email reminders that remind them of their participation in the 
study.  
• At the onset of the indigestion  and heartburn  episode , the participant will start a Symptom 
Diary and complete a 4-point Likert  scale  for each of the symptoms they are experiencing . 
○ Onset is defined as the point in time the participant take s the test product for relief of 
symptoms . 
• After completing the surveys, the participant will take the test product. The participant will take 
2 capsules  per indigestion  and heartburn  episode. With a max of 6 capsules  per day. (If 
participant takes 6 capsules  in 1 d ay this will be defined as 3 indigestion  and heartburn  episodes 
and the participant  will be exited from the study).   
• After taking the test product , the participant will complete a 4-point Likert  scale  assessment  for 
each symptom  at 15 minutes, 30 minutes,  and 1 hour after taking the test product . 
• When the participants symptoms have resolved , the participant will complete the symptom  
diary.  
• If the participant takes any other medication outside of the test product, the participant will 
record this on the symptom  diary.  
○ The participant is allowed to take alternative medications or supplements AFTER 1 hour from 
taking the test product.  
• After taking the test product, the participant  will be instructed to fill out an Adverse Event form 
for any side -effects exp erienced.  
• After the first episode  of indigestion  and heartburn , the participant will be asked to complete 
the same process for another 2 episodes  within the 60 -day study time frame ; however, these 
are not required.  
• If the participant completes the required assessments for a total of 3 episodes  of indigestion  and 
heartburn , they will be prompted, by email, to exit the study.   
• If the participant only completes the required assessments for the required 1 episode  of 
indigestion  and heartburn , the parti cipant will be prompted, by email, to complete the study 
exit form and will be exited from the study on day 60 (60 days from the day of receipt of the test 
product).

6.3. Participant Enrollment and Follow -Up 
 
Participant s suffering from mild to moderate symptoms  of indigestion  and heartburn  will complete a 
cloud -based, HIPAA -secured screening survey to determine eligibility. All eligibility criteria must be 
met for participants to be approved for enrollment in the study. Participants will be provided 
informed consent and the opportunity to a sk questions related to the study procedures, risks and 
benefits, and rights related to participation in the study. Participants who sign the study informed 
consent will be prospectively enrolled in the study and provided a link to a patient  portal, which 
provides study resources. Participants will take the study formula at the onset of symptoms and 
provide information related  to symptoms of indigestion/heartburn during the follow -up period. A 
remote study coordinator may prompt participants to provide stud y information to ensure that the 
study forms are completed. Efforts will be taken to ensure minimal withdrawals and loss to follow -
up.  
 
6.4. Adverse Event and Safety Monitoring  
 
Adverse Events (AEs) are defined as any untoward medical occurrences described by the study 
participant.  All AEs will be self -reported and documented on the platform. The AEs will be reviewed 
by the study team including the remote trial coordinator and study principal investigator and 
reported according to the IRB requirements. Partici pants who experience adverse events will be 
advised to seek medical attention.  
 
In the event that a participant experiences an adverse event, the clinical study manager or clinical 
ops coordinator will notify both the PI and Sponsor. The Sponsor will take  appropriate action 
according to their standard operating procedures for any adverse events that warrant action by the 
sponsor.  
 
6.4.1.  Anticipated Adverse Events  
 
Anticipated Adverse Events are complications that are known to be associated with the test 
product  (in high doses exceeding recommended use):  
• Headache  
• Amenorrhea  
• Upset Stomach  
• Diarrhea  
• Hives  
• Difficulty breathing  
• Facial swelling  
• Drowsiness  
• Tiredness  
21 
 • Vomiting  
6.4.2.  Adverse Event Relationship  
 
Each reported AE will be assessed by the Investigator for relatedness, severity and causality.  
 
6.4.3.  Serious Adverse Events  
 
A Serious Adverse Event is an Adverse Event that leads to death or to serious deteriorat ion in 
the health of the participant  that either resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury, or a 
permanent impairment of a body structure or body function.  
 
6.5. Lost to Follow -Up 
 
If a participant  fails to provide event information via the study/patient portal 30 days after the start 
of the trial, the remote coordinator will attempt to contact the participant to ascertain whether or 
not the participant has had a n episode  of indigestion or heartburn  or not and if the participant 
wishes to and/or should continue in the study.   
 
Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make every 
effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls  and, if necessary, a 
certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These 
contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s study record.  
 
Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she w ill be considered to have withdrawn 
from the study and the study exit form will be completed.  
 
6.6. Test  Product Packaging /Handling/Storage/Accountability  
 
• The 3 -episode supply of test product will be packaged and labeled with ingredients and a study 
ID number . 
• Participants will receive guidance on how to report receipt, store, and use the test product . 
• Hawthorne Effect Inc. will support storage and shipment of test product, documentation of test 
product assignment, and completion of test product accountability.  
 
6.7. Study Management  
 
This study uses a decentralized clinical trial format to foster inclusivity, diversity and accessibility for 
a broad study population and to ensure efficiencies for enrollment and study data collection. The 
study will be managed using an end to en d virtual clinical trial platform called Hawthorne Effect 
Study Visit Management Platform which is designed to make patient participation in clinical trials 
more accessible and as least burdensome as possible. The Hawthorne Effect platform 
(www.hawthorne -effect.com ) is GCP/ICH/21CFR and HIPAA compliant . Hawthorne Effect uses a 
network of specialty vetted and trained healthcare professionals, or HEROs who are study 
22 
 investigators, screeners and conduct personalized patient visits for screening and follow -up. For this 
trial, the Hawthorne Effect study visi ts will be virtual, and the platform will be used to collect patient 
reported outcomes and to track screening, enrollment and study compliance.  
 
7. Statistical Considerations  
 
7.1. Study Outcomes Measures  
Analysis populations : 
The intent to treat  (ITT) population consists of all participants who are consented, report 
the onset of indigestion and heartburn , and have taken the study medication at least once. 
The primary analysis will be in the ITT population.  
 
 Primary Endpoint:  
 
The primary endpoint has two components, reduction in indigestion  severity and reduction 
in heartburn severity. Participants will be asked to rate each symptom (bloating, early 
fullness d uring a meal, pain or discomfort in the upper abdomen, burning in the upper 
abdomen, pain/burning in the center of your chest, nausea, vomiting, burping)  on a 4 -point 
Likert scale at 4 time points: prior to taking the  test product, 15 , 30, and 60  minutes a fter 
taking the  test product. The improvement in symptoms from baseline will be evaluated on a 
pairwise basis separately for each component and each time point. P -values will be 
computed for the improvement.  
 
 There is no control group for the primary analysis.  
 
 Secondary Endpoints:  
Secondary endpoints will be gathered on the subjective experience of these participant s 
related to general health, personal experience with the test product. The secondary 
endpoints will be self -reported by the participant  on their online portal. There will be a 
questionnaire related to general health and the subjective experience of the participant  
administered at baseline and at study exit .  
 
The purpose of the secondary analyses is to investigate the association between various 
baseline and other measurements and outcomes . These secondary analyses are considered 
hypothesis generating, and the descriptions are somewhat informal.  The trial data  may 
suggest secondary analyses not described here.  
 
Secondary endpoints:  
 
23 
 ● The time to other intervention will be analyzed . 
● A longitudinal analysis will be performed for participant s who report on more than one 
incident of heartburn or indigestion.  
● Advers e events will be summarized.  
● An additional data presentation will consist of results from both Treatment and Control 
in similar studies appearing in the literature. There will be no formal statistical 
comparison of results from this study and historical studies . 
● The Net Promoter Score will be summarized and compared against outcomes .  
● Comparison against normal behavior will use the paired sample t -test. 
 
 
 
7.2. Sample Size Considerations  
Based on information from a variety of studies a highly pessimistic assumption is that there 
would be a mean improvement of 0.5 with a standard deviation of 1.5.  (These values refer 
to the 4 -point scale.) Based on these assumptions, a sample size of 97 participant s would 
result in a 90% power to detect an impro vement using the paired -sample t -test. If data from 
multiple incidents per participant  are useful, the power to detect an improvement would 
increase. The final sample size of 200 participant s has been chosen to allow for various 
contingencies, including un certainties about compliance in this self -reported trial, and the 
fact that some participant s may not experience heartburn or indigestion during the trial 
period.   
It should be emphasized that these assumptions are for sample size purposes only. Trial 
analysis will use the data as collected.  
As discussed above, the number 200 may be increased based on observed data concerning the 
number of participants with indigest ion and heartburn . The actual outcomes of treated participants 
will not be considered in this analysis, merely whether or not enrolled participants have reported 
starting using the test product. The method of reevaluating the sample size will be described in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan.  
7.3. Analysis Plan  
 
Separate tables will be presented showing the changes from baseline for each component 
and each time point. The changes will be evaluated by the paired sample t -test. A 
longitudinal analysis will be performe d for participant s who report on more than one 
incident of heartburn or indigestion.  
 
General statistical methods : 
 
24 
 Data will be analyzed using standard statistical methods, as further specified in a statistical 
analysis plan (SAP), which will be prepared in detail later.  
• Data analysis will largely consist of summary statistics and graphs. The only formal group 
comparisons will be in covariate analyses.  
• For continuous variables data presentation will consist of means, confidence intervals computed 
using the t-statistic, me dians, and interquartile ranges. Group comparisons will use t-tests or 
ANOVA . 
• For discrete variables confidence intervals will use the exact intervals, where available. Group 
comparisons will use Fisher’s exact test, with the Monte Carlo version used where  
computationally necessary.  
• For time to event variables analysis will use the Kaplan -Meier algorithm, and group comparisons 
will use the log -rank or proportional hazards methods, depending on the data type.   
• Visual analog scale values will be treated as continuous variables. Frequency counts will also be 
provided for scales with 10 or fewer distinct response levels.  
• Covariate analyses will investigate the relation between baseline and outcome variables, using 
methods appropriate to the data types involved . Age, gender, and baseline medications will be 
included in these analyses where appropriate data are available.  
• Present intention is that the analysis will be performed in R, and the precise form of algorithms 
will be the default of R. Kaplan -Meier, log -rank, and proportional hazards algorithms will be the 
defaults of the survival package.  
• The exact items to be compared depend on what is reported in each historical control study. 
When possible, the items will include symptom relief at each time measured, i ncluding within -
participant  p-values, and time to the lowest level on a 4 -point scale and to the lowest 2 levels on 
a 10 -point scale. as well as reported baseline characteristics.  When two -arm studies are 
compared, both arms will be reported in this compar ison. In some studies,  only indigestion or 
heartburn will be reported; when both are reported they will be separated for the 
comparison.  Specific studies to be considered will be identified prior to the analysis of actual 
trial data.  
 
8. Informed Consent Process  
 
The study protocol and informed consent will be reviewed and a pproved by Advarra Institutional 
Review Board prior to study start.  
 
Study candidates will learn about the study via digital advertisements. If interested in learning more, 
they  will be referred to a website “landing page” that will provide detailed information about the 
study. They may opt to complete a screening survey ascertaining study eligibility through patient  
reported outcomes. If successfully completed (no exclusion crit eria are selected), candidate will be 
invited to review the study consent form tutorial which includes the opportunity to ask questions 
related to the study from the Principal Investigator or delegated authority of the investigator. 
Candidate will be prov ided with contact information to reach investigator or study manager as 
desired.  
25 
  
Candidate may sign the informed consent via electronic signature as provided by 
Hawthorne Effect. The study manager will verify candidate signature prior to enrollment as 
a study participant . 
 
 
 
9. Subject Confidentiality  
All participant s’ data and personal information will be kept confidential. Only those involved with 
the study will have access to participant information. The data will be stored by Hawthorne Effect on 
a HIPAA compliant platform. The platform, which the data is stored on, will require a personalized 
username and password to gain access.  
 
10. Publication  
 
This study will be registered on clinicaltrials.gov prior to commencement of enrollment the results 
will be analyzed and submitted for publication.  
 
 
11. Limitations  
 
The study de scribed in this protocol has some limitations. There is no concurrent control, as 
seems appropriate for the first study on this combination  test product. The study relies 
solely on participant s' subjective information and self -reporting; there is no medica l review 
of symptoms, and no independent check on participant  compliance.   Some participant  
groups are not studied, including those under 18 years of age and pregnant women.

13.1.1.  Appendix A Drug Interactions  
 
Drug Interactions for Test Product  
 
DGL EXTRACT  
There are no Serious Drug Interactions known for DGL Extract. Whereas Licorice contains a 
constituent glycyrrhizic  acid, which can cause a syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess 
when eaten in large amounts , DGL extract has the glycyrrhizic acid removed and so should not 
pose the same interactions as regular Licorice extract. Still,  there are some potential Mode rate 
Interactions, where DGL may interact in the metabolism of certain drugs (which utilize the same 
enzymes it inhibits) , or other effects, such as estrogenic or diuretic effects . See Below for List.  
CYTOCHROME P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) SUBSTRATES  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
In vitro research shows that licorice extract and glabridin, a constituent found in the licorice 
species G. glabra , inhibit cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) isoenzymes ( 10300 ,94822 ). 
Licorice extract from the species G. uralensis  seems to inhibit CYP2B6 isoenzymes to a greater 
degree than G. glabra  extract in vitro ( 94822 ). Theoretically, these species of licorice might 
28 
 increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP2B6; however, these interactions have not yet been 
reported in huma ns. Some drugs that are metabolized by CYP2B6 include ketamine (Ketalar), 
phenobarbital, orphenadrine (Norflex), secobarbital (Seconal), rifampin (Rifadin), and 
dexamethasone (Decadron). Use licorice cautiously or avoid in patients taking these drugs.  
CYTOCHROME P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) SUBSTRATES  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Licorice extracts from the species G. glabra  and G. uralensis  inhibit cytochrome P450 2C19 
(CYP2C19) isoenzymes in vitro ( 94822 ). Theoretically, these species of licorice might increase 
levels of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19; however, this interaction has not yet been reported in 
humans. Some drugs metabolized by CYP2C19 include proton pum p inhibitors including 
omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), and pantoprazole (Protonix); diazepam 
(Valium); carisoprodol (Soma); nelfinavir (Viracept); and others.  
CYTOCHROME P450 2C8 (CYP2C8) SUBSTRATES  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Licorice extract from the species G. glabra  and G. uralensis  inhibits cytochrome P450 2C8 
(CYP2C8) isoenzymes in vitro ( 94822 ). Theoretically, these species of licorice might increase 
levels of drugs metabolized by CYP2C8; however, this inter action has not yet been reported in 
humans. Some drugs metabolized by CYP2C8 include amiodarone (Cardarone), paclitaxel 
(Taxol); nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac (Cataflam, 
Voltaren) and ibuprofen (Motrin); rosiglitazone (Av andia); and others.  
CYTOCHROME P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) SUBSTRATES  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
There is conflicting evidence about the effect of licorice on CYP2C9 enzyme activity . In vitro 
research shows that extracts from the licorice species G. glabra  and G. uralensis  moderately 
inhibit cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) isoenzymes ( 10300 ,94822 ). However, evidence from 
an animal model shows that licorice extract from the species G. uralensis  can induce hepatic 
CYP2C9 activity ( 14441 ). Reasons for these discrepancies are not clear. Until more is known, 
licorice should be used cautiously in people taking CYP2C9 substrates. Some drugs 
metabolized by CYP2C9 include celecoxib (Celebrex), diclo fenac (Voltaren), fluvastatin 
(Lescol), glipizide (Glucotrol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), irbesartan (Avapro), losartan 
(Cozaar), phenytoin (Dilantin), piroxicam (Feldene), tamoxifen (Nolvadex), tolbutamide

CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) SUBSTRATES  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
29 
 Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = B  
Pharmacokinetic research shows that the licorice constituent glycyrrhizin, taken in a dosage of 
150 mg orally twice daily for 14 days, modestly decre ases the area under the concentration -time 
curve of midazolam by about 20%. Midazolam is a substrate of cytochrome P450 3A4 
(CYP3A4). This suggests that glycyrrhizin modestly induces CYP3A4 activity ( 59808 ). 
Evidence from animal research also shows that licorice extract from the species G. uralensis  
induces CYP3A4 activity ( 14441 ). However, licorice extract from G. glabra  species appear to 
inhibit CYP3A4 -induced metabolism of testosterone in vitro. It is thought that the G. glabra  
inhibits CYP3A4 due to its constituent glabridin, which is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor in vitro  
and not present in other licorice species ( 10300 ,94822 ). Until more is known, licorice should be 
used cautiously in people taking CYP3A4 substrates. Some drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 
include lovastatin (Mevacor), clarithromycin (Biaxin), cy closporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), 
diltiazem (Cardizem), estrogens, indinavir (Crixivan), triazolam (Halcion), and numerous 
others.  
ESTROGENS  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = High  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Theoretically, licorice might interfere with estrogen therapy due to estrogenic and anti -
estrogenic effects ( 7860 ,16058 ). 
MIDAZOLAM (Versed, others)  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = B  
In humans, the licorice constituent glycyrrhizin appears to moderately induce the metabolism of 
midazolam ( 59808 ). This is likely due to induction of cytochrome P450 3A4 by licorice. Until 
more is known, licorice should be used cautiously in people taking midazolam. .  
WARFARIN (Coumadin)  
Interaction Rating  = Major  Do not take this combination.   
Severity  = High  •  Occurrence  = Probable  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Licorice seems to increase metabolism and decrease levels of warfarin in an imal models. This is 
likely due to induction of cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) metabolism by licorice ( 14441 ). 
Advise pati ents taking warfarin to avoid taking licorice.  
 
Interactions with Herbs & Supplements  
CARDIAC GLYCOSIDE -CONTAINING HERBS : Theoretically, the overuse or misuse of 
licorice can increase the risk of cardiotoxicity due to potassium depletion ( 10393 ). Cardioactive 
herbs include digitalis, lily -of-the-valley, pheasant's eye, and squill.  
 
STIMULANT LAXATIVE HERBS : Theoretically,  concomitant overuse or misuse of licorice 
30 
 with stimulant laxatives can increase the risk of potassium depletion ( 10393 ). Stimulant laxative 
herbs include aloe, alder buckthorn, black root, blue flag, butternut bark, colocynth, European 
buckthorn, fo ti, gamboge, gossypol, greater bindweed, jalap, manna, Mexican scammony root, 
rhubarb, senna, and yellow dock.

ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = High  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = B  
Based on laboratory research, ginger is thought to inhibit thromboxane synthetase and decrease 
platelet aggregation ( 7622 ,12634 ,20321 ,20322 ,20323 ,96257 ). However, this has not been 
demonstrated unequivocally in humans, with mixed results from clinical trials ( 96257 ). 
Theoretically, excessive amounts of ginger might increase the risk of bleeding when used with 
anticoagulant/antiplatelet drugs. Some anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs include aspi rin, 
clopidogrel (Plavix), dalteparin (Fragmin), enoxaparin (Lovenox), heparin, ticlopidine (Ticlid), 
warfarin (Coumadin), and others.  
ANTIDIABETES DRUGS  
Interaction Rating  = Minor  Be watchful with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Unlikely  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Evidence from animal and human research suggests that ginger might incr ease insulin levels 
and/or decrease blood glucose levels ( 12636 ,20402 ,20403 ,20404 ,20405 ,89895 ,89896 ). 
Theoretically, ginger might have an additive effect with antidiabetes drugs and cause 
hypoglycemia. Some antidiabetes drugs include glimepiride (Amaryl), glyburide (DiaBeta, 
31 
 Glynase PresTab, Micronase), insulin, metformin (Glu cophage), pioglitazone (Actos), 
rosiglitazone (Avandia), and others.  
CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS  
Interaction Rating  = Minor  Be watchful with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Unlikely  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Preliminary research suggests ginger might have hypotensive and calcium channel -blocking 
effects ( 12633 ). Theoretically, ginger might have an additive effect with calcium channel 
blockers. Calcium channel blockers include nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia), verapamil (Calan,  
Isoptin, Verelan), diltiazem (Cardizem), isradipine (DynaCirc), felodipine (Plendil), amlodipine 
(Norvasc), and others.  
CYCLOSPORINE (Neoral, Sandimmune)  
Interaction Rating  = Minor  Be watchful with this combination.   
Severity  = Mild  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
In an animal model, ginger juice taken 2 hours prior to cyclosporine administration reduced the 
maximum concentration a nd area under the curve of cyclosporine by 51.4% and 40.3%, 
respectively. This effect was not observed when ginger juice and cyclosporine were 
administered at the same time ( 20401 ). 
METRONIDAZOLE (Flagyl)  
Interaction Rating  = Minor  Be watchful with this combina tion.  
Severity  = Mild  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
In an animal model, ginger increased the absorption and plasma half -life of  metronidazole. In 
addition, the elimination rate and clearance of metronidazole was significantly reduced ( 20350 ). 
NIFEDIPINE  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = B  
Clinical research shows that combined treatment with ginger 1 gram plus nifedipine 10 mg 
significantly inhibits platelet aggregation compared to nifedipine alone or ginger alone ( 20324 ). 
PHENPROCOUMON  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = High  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Phenprocoumon, a warfarin -related anticoagulant used in Europe, might increase the 
international normalized ratio (INR)  when taken with ginger. There is one case report of a 76 
32 
 year old woman with a stable INR on phenprocoumon that increased to greater than 10 when 
she began consuming dried ginger and ginger tea ( 12880 ). 
WARFARIN (Coumadin)  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = High  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = B  
Preliminary evidence suggests that ginger might inhibit thromboxane synthetase and decrease 
platelet aggregation ( 7622 ,12634 ,20321 ,20322 ,20323 ). In one case report, ginger increased the 
INR when taken with phenprocoumon, which has similar pharmacological effects as warfarin 
(12880 ). In another case report, ginger increased the INR when taken with a combination of 
warfarin, hydrochlorothiazide, and acetaminophen ( 20349 ). A longitudinal analysis suggests 
that taking ginger increases the risk of bleeding in patients taking warfarin for at least 4 months 
(20348 ). However, research in healthy people suggests that ginger has no effect on INR, or the 
pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of warfarin ( 12881 ,15176 ). Until more is known, 
monitor INRs closely in patients taking significant amounts of ginger.

ABOUT THE STUDY  
 
Background  
 
Dyspepsia , also known as indigestion,  is a common symptom that can have many different 
causes. It occurs in about  25 percent of the po pulation each year, but most affected people do 
not seek medical care. Approximately 25 percent of people  with indigestion  have do have a 
medical cause. However, up to 75 percent of people have functional dyspepsia , which means 
that there is no underlying cause on diagnostic evaluation. People with this type of  dyspepsia 
usually describe feeling bloated , feeling full early during a meal , and/or  upper middle stomach  
pain/burning. Symptoms may be bad enough to limit usual activities. Some people may have 
nausea, vomiting, or heartburn; however, these symptoms are usually infrequent.  The most 
common  approach to treat occasional indigestion and heartburn is to use antacids to neutralize 
what is often be lieved to be an overproduction of stomach acid. This acid -blocking approach 
can perpetuate the problem when used over a long period of time. Acid blocking also has the 
54 
 drawback of causing deficiencies in certain vitamins and minerals  over time , such as cal cium , 
because it prevents absorption . 
 
Who can participate?  
 
Participants who are at least  18 years of age and who suffer from indigestion and heartburn 
and who are otherwise in good health will be invited to be screened for the study. There will be 
about 200 participants in this study. All potential participants in the study must meet the rules 
of the study . These are  called the inclusion -exclusion criteria. You will be asked to complete a 
few screening questions before you can be enrolled in the study . If you meet all the rules you 
may choose to participate in the study.  
 
What is the purpose of the study?  
 
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the impact of the test product on the symptoms of 
occasional indigestion and heartburn  in adult men and women who suffer from occasional 
indigestion and heartburn.  
 
How long is the study?

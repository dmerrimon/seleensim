Section # and Name  Description of Change  Brief Rationale  
Section 2.3.1.1 - 
Investigational Intervention 
Bimagrumab  Added potential risk of disruption 
of menstrual cycles in 
premenopausal women with an 
IUD implant, due to decreased 
FSH levels.  Risk language in response to 
FDA feedback.  
Section 4.1 - Baseline  
Section 8.0 - Study 
Assessment and Procedures  Revised baseline window for 
DXA from 7 days prior to the 
baseline visit to 14 calendar days 
prior to the baseline visit. Non -
baseline DXA windows revised to 
be  -2 weeks to +1 week of the 
scheduled tim e for all other visits.  
The flexibility of the week 4 
dosing visit was removed.  Based on site feedback, DXA 
assessment window extended 
to allow sufficient time for 
DXA scans to be scheduled 
around study visits.  
Section 4.1 -Baseline  Clarified that baselin e 
assessments should be completed 
at least 15 minutes prior to 
dosing.  Editorial/clarification 
change.  
Section 8.4.1 – Time Period 
for Collecting AEs  Non-serious AEs will be collected 
after first dose of study 
medication(s) instead of after 
screening.  To avoid incomplete entry of 
medical history, medical 
conditions identified during 
the screening period will be 
captured as medical history.  
Section 8.4.4 – Pregnancy  Pregnancies in female partners of 
male participants will be reported.  Outcomes of pregnancies in 
female participants as well as 
female partners of male 
participants will be recorded.  
Section 9.3 – Interim 
Analysis  Removed the plan for an interim 
analysis.  Due to the expected rate of 
recruitment, an interim 
analysis is no longer require d 
for development planning.  
Section 10.2 – Clinical 
Laboratory Tests  HCV RNA removed from the 
screening tests  HCVAb will be used to 
detect hepatitis C infection; 
HCV RNA may be used to 
confirm active infection.  
Additional changes include grammatical and clarifying text as well as revisions to reflect the 
extended treatment period.

1.0 Synopsis  
1.2 Study Schema  
1.3 Schedule of Activities  
1.4 Study Design  Study duration increased from 
28 weeks to 48 weeks . 
Corresponding additions  to 
assessments :  
 Phone calls at Weeks 32, 36 
and 44; on -site visits at Weeks 
40 and 48.  
 Dosing events at Weeks 28 
and 40.  
 DXA at Week 48  
 Safety/efficacy assessments at 
Weeks 40 and 48  Dosing through week 48 with 
placebo control will showcase 
greater effect of bima grumab  
and comb inations with  
semaglutide  across multiple 
measures of efficacy . 
1.0 Synopsis  
3.0 Objectives, Endpoints 
and Estimands  
9.0 Statistical 
Considerations  Changes in objectives and 
endpoints relate d to the 
increased duration of the study  
and the change in the lower dose 
of the semaglutide treatment 
arms.  Changes were r equired to 
harmonize with the study design.  
1.0 Synopsis  
4. Study Design  
5. Study Population  
2.2.2 Teratogenicity and 
Reproductive Toxicity Data  Age limit of 40+ years for 
females  lowered  to 18+ who are 
post-menopausal or post -
surgica lly sterilized  or have in 
place an IUD and are willing to 
use a form of  barrier  
contraception  Expanded age range m ay 
provide exposure, safety and 
efficacy data in the 18 -40 age 
range  for females , more 
reflective of the intended Phase 
3 study  population, as 
recommended b y FDA . 
4.2 Scientific Rationale for 
Study Design  
4.3 Justification for Dose  
6.1 Study interventions 
Administered  
6.6 Dose Modification  
9.1 Statistical Analysis  Semaglutide low dose increased 
from 0.5 mg to 1 mg  Longer dosing period (through 
week 48) allows for adequate 
titration and exploration of an 
approved dose of semaglutide 
(Wegovy®, Ozempic®) .

investigate the efficacy and safety in overweight or obese men and women  
Brief Title  Safety and efficacy of bimagrumab and semaglutide in  adults with 
overweight or obesity  
Study Phase  2 
Study Type  Interventional  
Rationale  Most weight loss programs, including obesity pharmacotherapy , reduce body 
weight ; however , this often occurs at the expense of lean mass. Bimagrumab 
has been shown to reduce fat mass accompanied by an increase in muscle 
mass. This study investigates if bimagrumab , alone or  in addition to standard 
of care semaglutide , can preserve/increase muscl e mass in the presence of 
weight and fat mass loss.  
Primary Objective  1. To assess treatment effect of bimagrumab , semaglutide , and bimagrumab 
in addition to  semaglutide  vs placebo  on body weight  
Secondary Objectives  1. To assess  the treatment effect of bimagrumab, semaglutide, and 
bimagrumab in addition to semaglutide vs placebo on waist 
circumference  (WC, cm) 
2. To assess treatment effects on fat mass , visceral adipose tissue  (VAT) , 
trunk fat mass , subcutaneous adipose tissue  (SAT), and lean mass  (body 
composition)  
3. To assess the safety and tolerability of bimagrumab, semaglutide and 
bimagrumab in addition to semaglutide  
4. To assess the proportion of patients in each treatment group experiencing 
a change in the categorical classi fication of obesity based on BMI and 
waist -to-height ratio (WHtR) group  
5. To assess treatment effects on glucose metabolism  
6. To assess treatment effects on self -reported health status and weight -
related quality of life  
Primary Endpoint  1. Change  from baseline  in total body weight  at 48 weeks   
Secondary Endpoints  1. Change  from baseline in WC (cm) at 48 and 72 weeks 
2. a.  Change from baseline at 48 and 72 weeks in total body  fat mass (kg 
and % body fat ) by dual -energy x -ray absorptiometry  (DXA)  
b.  Change from baseline at 48 weeks in  VAT , SAT,  and trunk fat mass 
(kg) by DXA  
c.  Proportion of participants who achieve  a reduction  from baseline at 
48 weeks  in the following measures of obesity :

Study Design This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled (for 
bimagrumab)  study of i.v. bimagrumab, alone or in addition to open label s.c. 
semaglutide to investigate efficacy and safety in overweight or obese men 
and women.  
Participants will be randomize d to one of the following nine treatment arms  
(bima grumab or placebo by i.v. infusion, semaglutide by s.c. injection; exact 
doses of semaglutide , by subcutaneous injection, to be determined, not to 
exceed 2. 5 mg) for the 48-week core treatment period: 
1. Placebo  + no semaglutide 
2. Placebo + semaglutide 1.0 mg 
3. Placebo + semaglutide 2.4 mg 
4. Bimagrumab 10 mg/kg + no semaglutide 
5. Bimagrumab 10 mg/kg + semaglutide 1.0 mg 
6. Bimagrumab 10 mg/kg + semaglutide 2.4 mg 
7. Bimagrumab 30 mg/kg + no semaglutide 
8. Bimagrumab 30 mg/kg + semaglutide 1.0 mg 
9. Bimagrumab 30 mg/kg + semaglutide 2.4 mg 
The core treatment period is followed by a 24- week open-label treatment 
extension  period (which will remain blinded until after the 48 -week database 
lock and study unblinding) , during which 2 of the treatment arms will follow 
a modified treatment assignment:  
1. Switch from placebo to bimagrumab 30 mg/kg + no semaglutide  
2. No change; Placebo + semaglutide 1.0 mg; placebo replaced by no 
treatment after study unblinding 
3. No change; Placebo + semaglutide 2.4 mg ; placebo replaced by no 
treatment after study unblinding 
4. Switch from bimagrumab 10 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg + no semaglutide  
5. No change; bimagrumab 10 mg/kg + semaglutide 1.0 mg  
6. No change; bimagrumab 10 mg/kg + semaglutide 2.4 mg 
7. No change; bimagrumab 30 mg/kg + no semaglutide 
8. No change; bimagrumab 30 mg/kg + semaglutide 1.0 mg 
9. No change; bimagrumab 30 mg/kg + semaglutide 2.4 mg 
The extension period is then foll owed by a 32-week post-treatment follow -up 
period, during which all study treatments will be withdrawn for all arms. 
The study will consist of a screeni ng visit to assess eligibility, a baseline visit, 
followed by clinic visits/phone contacts every 4 weeks during the treatment 
and follow -up period s.

Sample Size 
Justification:   participants will be randomized to 1 o f 9 treatment 
groups. The sample size calculation is based on the primary efficacy estimand 
for weight .  Based on the FDA guidance on treatment for weight 
management, the minimum meaningful treatment effect for weight loss is 5% 
of baseline body weight over 1 year of treatment.   Assuming the  minimum 
treatment effect of % weight loss with a standard deviation (SD) of , for a 
minimum effect size of [2, 3] , a sample size of  participants per 
treatment arm will have approximately % statistical power to detect a 
treatment difference betwee n any active group and placebo /no treatment  
using a 2 -sided t-test at alpha= .   Assuming a % dropout rate, 
enrollment will target 55 participa nts per treatment arm.   
Sample size was estimated using a t-test for 2 means in NQuery Advisor V9.1 
(www.statsols.com ). [4, 5]

Statistical Methods All randomized participants who received at least one dose of study 
medication  will be included in an Gintention-to-treat H population (treatment 
policy strategy) . Baseline and efficacy results will be summarized by 
randomized treatment arm  with active treatment arms compared to 
placebo /no treatment, and combination treatment arms to each monotherapy 
of the same dose.  
Safety and tolerability results will be summarized by actual treatment 
received.  
A detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalized prior to database 
lock and will describe all planned analyses. 
Data 
Monitoring/Other 
Committee  A data monitoring committee (DMC) will be convened to review the 
available safety data after % of participant s have been treated for at least 
days, and periodically thereafter , with ad hoc meetings as necessary . The 
committee will consist of at least 2 independent clinicians, knowledgeable in 
obesity treatment, and 1  independent  biostatistician. Up to 2 additional non -
voting members from the Sponsor with relevant safety and statistical 
expertise may also be incl uded. Prior to convening the first DMC data review  
meeting , a DMC charter will be drafted and approved by the committee 
members. The primary role of the DMC is to advise on study conduct to 
ensure participant safety. This may include recommendations to dis continue a 
treatment arm or the study as a whole .

2. INTRODUCTION   
2.1. Study Rationale   
Obesity is one of the greatest public health challenges of the 21st century. Its pr evalence has 
tripled in many countries since the 1980s, and the numbers of those affected continue to rise at 
an alarming rate. In 2016, globally more than 1.9 billion adults (39%) were overweight ; of these , 
650 million (13%) were obese. In addition to cau sing various physical disabilities and 
psychological problems, excess weight drastically increases a person’s risk of developing a 
number of comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, insulin resistance and type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2D M) [6]. The Global Burden of Disease study reported that 4.7 million 
people died prematurely in 2017 as a result of obesity [7]. 
A body weight reduction of 5 -10% has been associated with significant and clinically 
meaningful improvem ents in insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, hypertension, and 
dyslipidemia. Combining lifestyle management with pharmacotherapy is increasingly recognized 
as an effective and safe treatment option for many patients with obesity [8]. Currently, 5 
medications are on the market for long term us e in the US, the latest is once weekly s.c. 
semaglutide  (a GLP 1-receptor agonist) , approved in 2021  for chronic weight management in 
adults with obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2) or overweight with at least one weight -related condition 
(BMI >27 kg/m2). 
Adipose tissu e, in particular , visceral adipose tissue ( VAT ), is involved in energy storage and is 
considered an endocrine and paracrine organ that affects several metabolic processes, through 
the release of cytokines and bioactive mediators. Cytokines and mediators can influence body 
weight, as well as insulin resi stance and pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus, lipid metabolism  and 
inflammation, thus explaining premature atherosclerosis in people with obesity  [9-11]. VAT 
rather than body mass index ( BMI ) determines metabolic risk and  is associated  with metabolic 
syndrome even in participant s with normal BMI, defined as normal weight obese  [12-14]. 
Therefore, loss of VAT might be of great importance to prevent cardiovascular disease.  
Most weight loss programs are able to reduce body weight within the first few weeks; however, a 
significant amount of the weight loss includes loss of LBM. Also, obesity pharmacotherapy 
results in loss of LBM in connection with loss of FM [15], so it is important to focus on body 
composition i n an effort to maintain LBM. The loss of LBM is problematic for several reasons, 
including impacts on health, ability to conduct activities of daily living and potential effects on 
emotion and psychological states. The loss of LBM impedes sustainability  of successful obesity 
therapy  by causing lowered resting energy expenditure/metabolism, fatigue, decline in 
neuromuscular function, and increased risk for injury [16-18]. In an e ffort to offset LBM loss, 
studies have incorporated exercise in conjunction with a weight loss program; however, this has 
only provided modest benefit , most likely due to the modest caloric expenditure experienced 
with moderate exercise [19, 20] . In general, it is recognized that for every 1 kg of FM lost, 
approximately 0.26 kg of lean tissue is lost in post -menopausal women [21]. Importantly, the 
lean mass lost is only partiall y regained with weight gain. There are no approved obesity 
interventions that preserve or build lean mass while promoting fat mass loss.

Bimagrumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody binding to the activin receptor type II 
(ActRII). Bimagrumab prev iously has been studied in muscle wasting indications and has been 
shown to increase  skeletal muscle mass in healthy volunteers, in patients with sporadic inclusion 
body myositis (sIBM), and in patients with sarcopenia.  
In a recent randomized double -blind,  placebo -controlled study including 75 overweight or obese 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), bimagrumab 10 mg/kg i.v. every 4 weeks for 48 
weeks in addition to lifestyle intervention, resulted in a marked loss in FM, an increase in LBM, 
and im provement in a range of metabolic biomarkers [5]. Participants lost 5.1 kg (p<0.001) body 
weight in the bimagrumab group vs. the placebo group with a decrease in placebo -adjusted WC 
of 9.5 cm (p<0.001). Patients lost 20.5% of FM, had a 3.6% increase in LBM, and had a decrease 
of 0.76 percentage points in their HbA1c levels, whereas placebo patients only had a decrease in 
total body FM of 0.5%, LBM reduction of 0.8%, and an increase of 0.04 percentage points in 
HbA1c levels. The loss in total body FM and gain in LBM led to net weight losses of 6.5% and 
0.8%  in patients receiving bimagrumab or placebo , respectively . Addition ally, greater reduction s 
in VAT  and hepatic fat fraction were observed in the bimagrumab group versus placebo  group . 
The expansion of the lean mass (i.e., skeletal muscle) compartment in t he presence of negative 
energy balance and weight loss is a novel feature in weight loss pharmacotherapy. Overall, 
adverse effects  (AEs) were balanced between the bimagrumab and placebo groups . Participants  
on bimagrumab vs. placebo reported more muscle sy mptoms, diarrhea and nausea. The 
frequency of gastrointestinal A Es was highest during the first dosing period with bimagrumab 
and diminished with repeat dosing. More patients in the bimagrumab group experienced transient 
elevations of pancreatic and liver enzymes, which tended to subside after the first dose of 
bimagrumab . The etiology of these elevations is unclear but could be related to mobilization of 
adipocyte triglycerides and amino acids as a new metabolic equilibrium is reached during early 
bimagrum ab dosing.  
The planned study is designed to evaluate the effect of bimagrumab alone or in addition to the 
approved obesity therapeutic semaglutide in obese or overweight participants with at least one 
obesity related co -morbidity, without T2DM. The main endpoint in the study is body weight . 
Other endpoints include waist circumference, body composition, and evaluation of the impact of 
treatment on metabolic parameters and safety.  
2.2. Background   
The activin type 2 receptors ActRIIA and ActRIIB, abbreviated as ActRII, modulate signals for 
ligands belonging to the transforming growth factor beta (TGF -β) superfamily . These included  
growth differentiation factor 8 (GDF8, myostat in), GDF11, and activin s, which are all negative 
regulators of skeletal muscle growth, acting via the ActRII receptor signaling pathway to inhibit 
muscle protein synthesis and myocyte differentiation and proliferation. A pharmacological way 
to block these ligands’ action to increase muscle mass and hence exercise capacity is through 
inhibition of ActRII [22]. Blockade  of ActRII resul ts in hypertrophy of skeletal muscle through 
an increase in size of existing myofibers [23-25], which in turn is hypothesized to improve 
peripheral insulin sensitivity, since skeletal muscle is one of the major glucose -utilizing tissues in 
the body [22]. 
Activin receptor signaling is also active in adipose tissue and contributes to the regulation of 
adipose tissue mass.  Adipocytes express the highest levels of the type 1  receptor ALK7 and are

the major tissue source of activin B. In rodents, knockout of the ALK7 receptor decreases total 
fat mass and confers resistance to diet -induced obesity.  In humans, single nucleotide 
polymorphism s in the ALK7 gene are associated with lower BMI and resistance to obesity [26, 
27]. 
Bimagrumab, a recombinant human, monoclonal antibody (modified IgG, λ2) binds 
competitively to the ActRII with a greater affinity than its natural ligands.  
Information currently available on pharmacology, toxicology, pharmacok inetics, and 
pharmacodynamics are reported in the Investigator  Brochure ( please refer to most recent edition ) 
and has been obtained from in vitro experiments, animal studies, toxicology studies, and human 
trials.  
2.2.1.  Preclinical Pharmacology   
The co -administration of CDD866, a murinized version of bimagrumab , with semaglutide was 
studied in obese C57Bl/6J mice . Animals were fed a high fat diet (60% of total caloric input as 
fat) for 20 weeks  and reached body weights of approximately 50 g rams ( twice normal ) at the 
time the therapeutic interventions were initiated.  The high fat diet was continued throughout the 
experimental period  and the two drugs were evaluated individually  and when co -administered , 
along with vehicle -alone groups . The primary  efficacy assessment was total body fat  mass  
determined  weekly by magnetic resonance spectroscop y. Each drug alone exhibited the expected 
effect on body  fat mass and lean mass and when administered together, the decrease in body fat 
mass was at least additive . Greater than  30% body fat mass loss was observed over 3 weeks with 
the co -administration of the two highest dose levels of bimagrumab and semaglutide. Other than 
the expected decrease in food intake in the semaglutide arms of the study, there were no safety or 
tolerability issues observed. Specifically, a quantitative open field test of behavior showed no 
significant differences between the drug -treated groups and vehicle -treated groups.  
Teratogenicity and Reproductive Toxicity Data  
In embryo -fetal development studies, bimagrumab was seen to be developmentally toxic in the 
rat and rabbit and teratogenic in the rat (NOAEL of 1 mg/kg). The exact mechanism, direct or 
indirect, underlying the reproductive organ changes observed with bimagrumab is unclear. A 
pre- and postnatal development (dose range -finding) study in the rat was terminated at the end of 
the weaning phase of pup development bec ause of a high incidence of litter death in the control 
animals (reason unknown). In rats dosed at 1 or 10 mg/kg there was an increase in the number of 
females unable to complete the process of parturition and an increase in the number of stillborn 
pups. T his observation was not seen in the control animals.  
Women of child -bearing potential , who are not post -menopausal or post -surgical sterilization , 
must use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after their last dose of 
bimagrumab due to the risk of teratogenicity and embryo -fetal death observed with bimagrumab 
in animals.  
Clinical studies evaluating single and multiple dos es of bimagrumab showed no difference in 
changes in testicular volume or sperm count or quality between male participant s receiving 
bimagrumab and those receiving placebo. Furthermore, m onoclonal antibodies are large 
molecules that do not readily (< 1%) pa ss the blood -testis barrier and are not readily excreted in

seminal fluid. As  a result of this data, no contraception is required for male participant s 
participating in bimagrumab trials.  
2.2.2.  Clinical Data   
Human safety and tolerability  
Bimagrumab has been studied in Phase 2/3 clinical studies that have evaluated  the safety , 
tolerability, PK and efficacy of bimagrumab in different  populations, including  5 phase 2a/proof 
of concept studies (recovery from disuse, sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM), sarcopenia 
with mobility limitations, and cancer cachexia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
cachexia ), two phase 2b studies (sarcopenia and hip fracture reco very) and one phase 2b/3 study 
in sIBM  patients . Study results to date indicate bimagrumab has a good safety profile; is 
generally well tolerated; has predictable nonlinear kinetics caused by target -mediated drug 
disposition; and reliably increases muscle volume and decreases adipose tissue levels. Body 
composition changes begin within 2 weeks of administration and continue throughout exposure 
in both healthy volunteers and patients regardless of age.  
Transient cases of episodic, involuntary muscle contract ions (referred to as “cramps or spasms”), 
acne and diarrhea of mostly mild intensity have been observed in study participants  with 
symptoms occurring more frequently in participants receiving the highest doses of drug 
(30 mg/kg). Several participants have discontinued treatment in  earlier studies because of an AE 
(exacerbation of acne, muscle cramps or diarrhea). Data from a dedicated hormonal  study  
showed no effect on the hormonal axis except for a decrease in FSH levels in postmenopausal 
women with comple te resolution after bimagrumab  clearance. Data from a dedicated 24-week  
cardiac safety study indicated no effect of bimagrumab on multiple cardiac parameters  in the 
context of the expected skeletal muscle hypertrophy . 
Human pharmacokinetic data  
Bimagrumab exhibits a non -linear kinetic profile following single and repeat i.v. administrations , 
very likely caused by target -mediated drug disposition . The total clearance (CL) of bimagrumab 
is concentration -dependent and is the sum of linear CL and non -linear CL. The half -life is also 
concentration dependent. The half -life ranges from 19 days in the linear portion of the profile 
(high bimagrumab concentrations) to 5 days when the maximum CL is achieved. Based on 
graphical exploration, the nonlinear CL s aturation seems to occur below a threshold serum 
concentration of approximately 10 μg/mL.  
Bimagrumab, like any human IgG antibody, is expected to be eliminated via intracellular 
catabolism, following fluid -phase or receptor mediated endocytosis. Since the majority of 
immunoglobulins undergo proteolytic degradation, bimagrumab is not expected to yield active 
metabolites.  Since bimagrumab is a human IgG with large molecular size (~150 kDa), little 
intact immunoglobulin can be filtered by the kidney, hence lit tle/no antibody is expected to be 
excreted in the urine.  
There was only limited evidence of an effect of the dietary protein intake on the PK of 
bimagrumab. PK profiles of b imagrumab in healthy volunteers of Japanese descent, older adults 
up to 83 years of  age, obese adults , and patients with sIBM were similar to those of healthy 
younger adults.

Human pharmacodynamic data  
Consistent, measurable increases in muscle size  have been observed in clinical studies. In 
healthy volunteers, single doses of 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg i.v. and repeat doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg 
resulted in gains in thigh muscle volume of +2.7 -

post dose. The increase in muscle volume was associated with improvements in physical 
function in patients with sIBM (+6.0%) in an early PoC study. The muscle increase was also 
seen in a recent Phase 3 study, but the improved function was not repeated. Patients with 
sarcopenia saw 8% increases in muscle volume 8 weeks after a single dose of 30 mg/kg, which 
resulted in clinically relevant improvements in muscle strength and mobility performance.   
Consistent, dose -dependent, linear decreases in total body fat measured by DXA have also been 
observed in clinical studies with bimagrumab. Reductions in fat mass of between 2.5 and 3.5 kg 
over 6 months occurred in participant s with sarcopenia , hip fracture , sporadic inclusion body 
myositis and in healthy volunteers participating in a cardiac safety study  and in elderly healthy 
participant s.  Efficac y results  in obese and overweight patients with T2D M are reported in 
Section  2.1.

Brochure .  For information on semaglutide, refer to the current Wegovy ® or Ozempic ® package 
insert.  
2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment   
More detailed information about the know n and expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
expected adverse events (A Es) of bimagrumab can be found in the  Investigators Brochure  and in 
the Package Insert  for semaglutide.  
2.3.1.  Risk Assessment   
2.3.1.1.  Investigational Intervention Bimagrumab   
A total of 21 clinical studies including 3 extension studies have been conducted with 
bimagrumab, including  adults, with  receiving the bimagrumab. Dose levels ranged 
from 0.01 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg, with larger studies using 1 mg, 3 mg, and 10 mg/kg as i.v. 
infusion, s.c. injections of 2 mg/kg and fixed doses of  mg,  mg,  mg,  mg, and 
 mg; th e majority of  most  studies assessed i.v. infusions of 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg. 
Treatment durations ranged from single to multiple doses over 6 to 12 months. The longest 
continuous exposure  in obese adults with T 2DM was 12 months with doses of 10 mg/kg body 
weight (  mg maximum) and 12 -26 months in patients with sIBM.  
Muscle symptoms  
In a recent bimagrumab study in obese or overweight patients with T2D M, an increased AE 
incidence of muscle spasms (usually described as muscle cramps)  of  ( %), all mild 
( %) or moderate ( %)  in intensity  was observed  in the bimagrumab group .  ( %) 
participant reported muscle fatigue  and  ( %) reported muscle stiffness ; both were mild. 
The majority of the A Es were judged to be related to study drug by t he Investigator . In the 
placebo group there were 2 muscle events,  ( %) of muscle spasms and  ( %) of 
muscle twitching. In previous stud ies, in different indications, muscle symptoms were also seen

in the form of muscle spasms, tightness and twitching . In general, m uscle symptoms are mostly 
mild or moderate, transient, painless, and of short duration . For the details of previous individual 
studies please refer to the Investigators Brochure . 
The etiology and clinical meaning of these observations a re not known. Similar symptoms  have 
been reported with at least one other anabolic molecule, a beta -2 adrenergic agonist [28] and are 
commonly reported by adults performing muscle buildin g exercise.  
Skin symptoms  
In the obesity study, in the bimagrumab group there w ere  ( %) participants with at least one 
AE of skin symptoms, while there were  ( % in the placebo group). All skin symptoms were 
mild. The re were   participants in the bimagrumab group who reported AEs of acne (1), blister 
(1), and rash (2).  
In previous studies, in different indications, skin symptoms were seen mostly in the form of acne 
and rash. In general, skin symptoms are mostly mild or moderate, transient, painless , and of short 
duration. For the details of previous individual studies please refer to the current edition of the  
Investigators Brochure . 
Acne has been confirmed in these studies by dermatology consult and biopsy. Treatment has 
been successful with good skin hygiene using a 4 -10% benzoyl peroxide wash and over the 
counter topical treatments. On occasion, a  prescription, topical or oral antib iotic (i.e., 
minocycline 100 mg bid), was recommended. However, early standard of care intervention is 
recommended in participants when acne pr esents. A possible mechanistic link between 
bimagrumab and skin reactions remains unclear.  
Diarrhea  
In the obesit y study, diarrhea was reported in  participants ( %, % mild, % 
moderate) in the bimagrumab group  versus  ( %, % mild, % moderate) participants in 
the placebo group. Diarrhea has also been observe d more frequently in other studies in d ifferent 
indications.  
Reproductive organs  
Data from a dedicated hormonal study demonstra ted no clinically or statistically significant 
effect of  bimagrumab  on circulating  testosterone  levels  and no effect  on pituitary -adrenal axes in 
either gender and minimal effect on the pituitary -gonadal axes in men. Suppression of FSH 
levels in postmenopausal women  and premenopausal  women  of non-childbearing  potential  has 
been  observed  with no associated safety risk identified. However, in p remenopausal  women  
with an IUD  there is an associated  risk of disruption  of menstrual cycle s. All effects were 
transient and resolved after bimagrumab  exposure ended. Semen analysis  data from the multiple 
dose study suggest that three doses of  10 mg/kg have no effect on spe rm count or quality  in 
males.  
Women of childbearing potential must us e highly efficacious contraception (see study eligibility 
criteria , Section  5).

Immunogenicity  
A treatment  related  anti-drug antibody (ADA) response has been observed  infrequently  in 
participant s treated with bimagrumab. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of an infu sion or 
hypersensitivity  reaction that could be related to immunogenicity or any sign of immune 
complex formation in the clinical trials performed so far. No positive signal in the 
immunogenicity assay was  accompanied  by a change  in the bimagrumab  PK profile.  
Lipase and amylase elevations, and pancreatitis  
Observations of dose -dependent, transient, elevations of lipase and/or amylase  have been 
identified in several studies in the bimagrumab clinical program. The biological  explanation for  
this temporal rise in pancreatic enzymes seen in some individuals is not yet  fully  understood.  
As of 1 March 2022, 4 participants in 3 studies have experienced acute pancreatitis among  
participants administered bimagrumab. All 4 participants recover ed from the acute pancreatitis, 2 
discontinued study drug and 2 were considered to be related to study treatment. One participant 
on placebo experienced pancreatitis. To reduce the potential  risk of elevated  pancreatic  
enzymes and pancreatitis, study  participants with acute or chronic pancreatitis or with elevated 
amylase and/or lipase will be excluded as per Section  5.2. 
2.3.1.2.  Semaglutide ( Wegovy® , Ozempic ®)  
Risk of Thyroid C -Cell Tumors  
In mice and rats, semaglutide caused a dose -depend ent and treatment -duration -dependent 
increase in the incidence of thyroid C -cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) after lifetime 
exposure at clinically relevant plasma exposures . It is unknown whether semaglutide  causes 
thyroid C -cell tumors, including med ullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as human 
relevance of semaglutide -induced rodent thyroid C -cell tumors has not be en determined. Cases 
of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide, another GLP -1 receptor agonist, have been reported 
in the post  marketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a 
causal relationship between MTC and GLP -1 receptor agonist use in humans.  
Acute pancreatitis  
Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non -fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pa ncreatitis, has 
been observed in patients treated with GLP -1 receptor agonists, including semaglutide. Acute 
pancreatitis was observed in patients treated with semaglutide  in clinical trials . After initiation of 
semaglutide , observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis (including 
persistent severe abdominal pai n, sometimes radiating to the back, and which may or may not be 
accompanied by vomiting). If acute pancreatitis is suspected, semaglutide  should promptly be 
discontinued, an d appropriate management should be initiated. If acute pancreatitis is confirmed, 
semaglutide  should not be restarted.  
Acute Gallbladder Disease  
In Wegovy®  randomized clinical trials, cholelithiasis was reported by % of semaglutide  -
treated patients and % of placebo -treated patients. Cholecystitis was reported by % of 
semaglutide  -treated patients and % of placebo -treated patients. Substantial or  rapid weight 
loss can increase the risk of cholelithiasis; how ever, the incidence of acute gallbladder disease

was greater in semaglutide  -treated patients than in placebo -treated patients, even after 
accounting for the degree of weight loss. If cholelith iasis is suspected, gallbladder investigations  
and appropriate clinical follow -up are indicated.  
Hypoglycemia  
Semaglutide  lowers blood glucose and can cause hypoglycemia . In a trial of patients with type 2 
diabetes and BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m2, hypoglycemia (defined as a plasma glucose 
less than 54 mg/dL) was reported in % of semaglutide -treated patients vers us % of 
placebo -treated patients. One episode of severe hy poglycemia (requiring the assistance of 
another person) was reported in one semaglutide -treated patient versus no placebo -treated 
patients.  
Inform patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate  them on the signs and symptoms of 
hypoglycemia.  
Acute Kidney Injury  
There have been post marketing  reports of acute kidney injury and worsening of chronic renal 
failure, which have in some cases required hemod ialysis, in patients treated with semaglutide.  
Patients with renal impairment may be at greater risk of acute kidney injury, but some of these 
events have been reported in patients without known underlying renal disease. Most  of the 
reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomi ting, or diarrhea, leading 
to volume depletion . 
Monitor renal function when in itiating or escalating doses of semaglutide  in patients reporting 
severe adverse gastrointestina l reactions. Monitor renal function in patients with renal 
impairment reporting an y adverse reactions that could lead to volume depletion.  
Hypersensitivity  
Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema) have been reported with 
semaglutide. If hypersensitivity re actions occur, discontinue use of semaglutide , treat promptly 
per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. Do not use in patients with a 
previous hypersensitivity to semaglutide or any of the excipients in semaglutide . Anaphylaxis 
and angioedema have been reported with other GL P-1 receptor agonists.  
Use caution in a patient with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with another GLP -1 
receptor agonist because it is unknown whether su ch patients will be predisposed to these 
reactions with semaglutide . 
Diabetic Retinopathy Compli cations in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes  
In a trial of patients with T2DM and BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m2, diabetic retinopathy 
was reported by % of semaglutide -treated patients and % placebo -treated patients.  
In a 2 -year trial with semaglu tide 0.5 mg and 1 mg once -weekly injection in patients with type 2 
diabetes and high cardiovascular risk, diabetic retinopathy complications occurred in patients 
treated with semaglutide injection ( %) co mpared to placebo ( %). The absolute risk 
increa se for diabetic retinopathy complications was larger among patients with a history of 
diabetic retinopathy at baseline (semaglutide  injection %, placebo %) than among patients 
without a known history of diabetic retinopathy (semaglutide injection %, placebo %).

Rapid improvement in glucose control has been  associated with a temporary worsening of 
diabetic retinopathy. The effect of long -term glycemic control with  semaglutide on diabetic 
retinopathy complications has not been studied. Patients wi th a history of diabetic retinopathy 
should be monitored for progre ssion of diabetic retinopathy.  
Heart Rate Increase  
Mean increases in resting heart rate of 1 to  4 beats per minute (bpm) were observed in 
semaglutide -treated patients compared to placebo in  clinical trials. More patients treated with 
semaglutide  compared with placebo had maximum changes from baseline at any visit of 10 to 19 
bpm ( % versus %, respectively) and 20 bpm or more ( % versus %, respectively).   
Instruct patients to inform the ir healthcare providers of palpitations or feelings of a racing 
heartbeat while at rest during semaglutide  treatment. If patients experience a sustained increase 
in resting heart rate, discontinue semaglutide . 
Suicidal Behavior and Ideation  
Suicidal behavi or and ideation have been reported in clinical trials with other weight 
management products. Monitor patients treated with semaglutide  for the emergence or worsening 
of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/ or any unusual changes in mood or behavi or. 
Discontinue semaglutide  in patients who experience suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Avoid 
semaglutide  in patients with a history of suicidal attempts or active suicidal ideation.  
Adverse reactions  
Semaglutide  was evaluated for safety in 3 randomized, do uble-blind, placebo -controlled trials 
that included  patients with overweight or obesity treated with semaglutide  for up to 68 
weeks and a 7 week off drug follow -up period. In clinical trials, % of patients treated with 
semaglutide  and % of patie nts treated with placebo permanently discontinued treatment as a 
result of adverse reactions. The most common adve rse reactions leading to discontinuation were 
nausea ( % versus %), vomiting ( % versus %), and diarrhea ( % versus %) for 
semaglutide  and placebo, respectively. The most frequent adverse events reported as AEs were 
nausea/vomiting reported in % / % respectively of patients on semaglutide  versus  % / 
% of patients on patients treated with placebo. Diarrhea/constipation was reported in % / % 
respectively of patients on semaglutide  and % / % of patients on placebo. Abdominal pain 
was reported in % of patients on semaglutide  and % on placebo.  
2.3.1.3.  Study Procedures   
Infusion risks  
Infusion -related reactions can occur with monoclonal antibodies. Hypersensitivity reactions can 
manifest as fever, chills, urticaria, dyspnea, headaches, myalgia and/or hypotension. No serious 
infusion reaction (anaph ylaxis ) has been seen in patients treated with bimagrumab . If a severe 
hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administrati on of bimagrumab should be discontinued and 
appropriate therapy initiated.  
Dual -Energy  X-ray Absorptiometry  (DXA)  
DXA scans in this study will be used to assess  bone mineral density and body composition  (i.e., 
fat and lean mass) . The effective radiation  dose of a DXA whole body scan on an adult is 2.1

µSv. Therefore, the total  amount of radiation exposure per participant  from 6 DXA scans will be 
about 12.6 µSv over a period of  96 weeks . This amount of radiation is less than 14 days of 
background exposure  (approximately 0 .03 µSv per hour at sea level).  For effective  radiation  
doses  under  3 µSv (300 mrem),  the risk is considered  to be minimal [29]. Therefore,  the    
radiation exposure in this study involves minimal risk.  
2.3.2.  Benefit Assessment   
All participant s enrolled in the study may benefit from lifestyle  interventions including diet and 
physical activity, and regular monthly contact with the site staff. Potential benefits associated 
with bimagrumab and semaglutide are described below . 
2.3.2.1.  Bimagrumab   
Based on  recent  clinical data  in overweight and obese diabetic participants , treatment with 
bimagrumab in non -diabetic obesity is expected to result in decrease d body weight and  waist 
circumference, with improved body composition resultin g from loss of fat mass and increase of 
lean mass . In the diabetic  participant  study , bimagrumab also result ed in reduction in visceral fat 
mass, reduction in hepatic fat fraction, and improved insulin sensitivity and glucose control .  
Bimagrumab in combination with semaglutide may mitigate the loss of lean mass.  
2.3.2.2.  Semaglutide   
Semaglutide is approved in the USA  and the EU as a chronic weight management treatmen t in 
obese or overweight adults . Once weekly  s.c. semaglutide result s in substantial percentage 
change and absolute change in body weight as reported in a recent meta -analysis  [4]. Compared 
with placebo, once weekly  semaglutide also led to superior reductions in  body weight,  waist 
circumference and BMI compared with placebo ; however, losses in lean mass (approximately 
10%) were also observed  [30]. Furthermore, the effect on improving other cardiometabolic risk 
factors and health -related quality of life was more pronounced for once -weekly semaglutide 
relative to placebo.  
2.3.3.  Overall Benefit Risk Conclusion   
Considering  the measures take n to minimize risk to participants participating in this study, the 
potential risks identified in association with bimagrumab are justified by the anticipated benefits 
that may be afforded to participants who are obese or overweight.

4. STUDY DESIGN   
4.1. Overall Design   
This is a non-confirmatory, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled (for bimagrumab) 
multi -center study of i.v. bimagrumab, alone or in addition to open label s.c. semaglutide , to 
investigate the efficacy and safety in  adult men and women  between the ages of 18 and 80, 
inclusive, who are ob ese or who are overweight with at least one obesity related co -morbidity.  
Women  must be post-menopausal , post-surgical ly sterilized  or using an intrauterine device.  
 participants  are planned to be enrolled and randomized to 1 of 9 treatm ent 
arms (see Section  6.1). 
The total study duration will be approximately 104 weeks and will consist of an up to 6 -week 
screening period, a 72-week treatment period  (48 weeks core followed by 24 weeks of 
extension), and a 32 -week post-treatment follow -up period . Overview of the study design can be 
found in the study schema in Section  1.2. 
Screening (Week -6 to day -1) 
Potential participants will undergo the screening activities listed in the Schedule of Activities  
(SoA)  Section  1.3 to determine their eligibility for the study (see enrollment criteria Section  5).  
Screening assessments that a re outside of the Week -6 to Day -1 window may be repeated once . 
The Investigator  must recommend a li festyle intervention [31] that includes dietary counseling 
for weight loss with a daily caloric deficit of approximately 500  kcal and with protein intake of 
at least 1.2 g/kg/day to support muscle anabolism.  Participants will also be encouraged to 
exercise for at least 150 minute s per week . 
These lifestyle interventions will be explained during the screening visit and initiated at the 
baseline visit.  
Baseline  (Day 1, up to 15 minutes prior to dosing ) 
Eligible participants will return to clinic to undergo baseline assessments as defined  in the SoA 
Section  1.3. Baseline assessments must be completed  prior to dosing.  DXA scans may be 
performed up to 14 calendar days prior to dosing.  
During this visit, participants will be provided with an  device in the form of a  wrist  
band . Participants will be advised to wear the band at all times for the entire course of the study.  
The band  should be removed during showering and  may be removed during sleep if desired . 
Site staff will assist participants with downloading study  application s on their mobile phone  that 
will send visit reminders, collect patient reported outcomes and provid e gene ral study 
information to the participant . 
Randomization and Dosing (Day 1)  
Upon completion of all baseline activities, e ligible participants  will be randomized to one of the 
9 treatment arms listed in Section  6.1. 
Bimagrumab or placebo will be administered  i.v. over a period of ~ 30 minutes, followed by 
flushing for ~15 minutes and a  15-minute  post-flush  observation period that will include  safety

and tolerability observations and PK  sampling.  Bimagrumab will be dosed based on the previous 
visit body weight at 10 mg/kg  or 30 mg/kg depending on the assigned treatment arm . 
Participants assigned to semaglutide treatment arms will receive their first dose o f semaglutide in 
clinic, along with training on how to store semaglutide pens and self -administer injections at 
home.  
Following all assessments, participants  may be discharged from the Investigator  site when the 
Investigator  judges them to be medically sta ble, in good general health , and not needing further 
observation.  
Participants assigned to semaglutide treatment arms will be sent home with a semaglutide pen  (to 
be self -administered, once weekly) , disposal containers and inst ructions to return  any unused  
pens to clinic at their next scheduled visit.  
Core Treatment Period (Weeks 1 to 48) 
For the duration of the core treatment period, participants should : 
 Follow the dietary and exercise  recommendations prescribed  by the Investigator . 
 Wear the band.  
 Complete weekly eDiaries.  Occasional missed diaries are permissible in the absence 
of persistent non -compliance.  
For participants assigned to semaglutide arms, self -administer weekly semaglutide injections and 
return all used and unused pens at their next clinic visit.  
Participants will return to clinic : 
 at Weeks 4 , 16, 28 and 40  for i.v. bimagrumab or placebo dosing . Additional 
assessments will be performed as detailed in the SoA  Section  1.3. 
 at Weeks 12, 24, and 48 for DXA scan ning and other assessments detailed in the SoA 
Section  1.3. 
Site staff will call participants at Weeks 2, 8, 20 , 32, 36, and 44  to ensure  there are no safety 
issues and to address any questions the participant  may have.  
Qualified dieticians will reac h out to participants on a monthly basis to provide dietary and 
exercise counseling , and to calculate participant J; dietary  intake via 24 -hour recall assessment  
(see study operation s manual  for detailed description) . If desired, t hese touchpoints may be 
combined with the in -clinic  visits or safety calls.  
Should participants report any adverse events over the phone, these will be recorded in the 
eCRF.  
Open Label Extension Treatment Period (Weeks 49 to 72)  
The open label extension tr eatment period will be conducted similarly to the  core treatment 
period described above , however , participants randomized to study treatment arms 1 
(bimagrumab placebo) and 4 ( bimagrumab 10 mg/kg)  will switch treatment to bimagrumab 30 
mg/kg  at Week 52.  Dispensing of drug product  in a manner that maintains the blind is described

in Section  6.4.4 . Note, the extension treatment period will be made open labe l after the 48-week 
database lock and study unblinding.  
For the duration of the extension treatment period, participants should continue to follow dietary 
and exercise recommendations, wear t he  band, complete the weekly eDiaries, and 
must self-administer weekly semaglutide (for participan ts assigned to semaglutide arms) as in the 
core treatment period.  
Participants will return to clinic  at Weeks 52 and 64 for i.v. bimagrumab or placebo dosing. 
Additional assessments will be perform ed as detailed in the SoA Section  1.3. Note : no placebo 
infusions will be adminis tered to treatment arms 2 and 3 after the study is made open label , e.g., 
after the Week 48  database lock and study unblinding.  
Site staff will call participants at Weeks 56, 60, and 68 as described above.  Should participants 
report any adverse events ove r the phone, these will continue to be recorded in the eCRF.  
Qualified dieticians will continue to counsel  participants on a monthly basis as described above.  
End of Treatment Visit (End of Week 72)  
Participants will return for the End of Treatment (EOT) Visit  at the end of Week 72 or at the 
time of early termination  to perform DXA scan and other assessments as detailed in the SoA 
Section  1.3.  If study intervention is permanently discontinued  early , the EOT  visit should be 
conducted as soon as possible, per Section  7.1. 
Post-Treatment Follow -Up Period (Weeks 73 to 104) 
Upon completion of the EOT  visit, all study treatment will be  withdrawn (bimagrumab/placebo 
and semaglutide) and participants will be followed for an additional 32 weeks.  
For the duration of the post-treatment follow -up period , participants should follow dietary and 
exercise recomm endations, wear the  band, a nd complete the weekly eDiaries.   
Participants will return to clinic at Weeks 84 and 96 for efficacy and safety assessments to be 
performed as detailed in the SoA Section  1.3. 
Site staff will call participants at Weeks 76, 80, 88, 92 , and 100, as described above.  Should 
participants report any adverse events over the phone, these will continue to be recorded in the 
eCRF.  
Qualified dieticians will continue to counsel  participants on a monthly basis as described above.  
Participants will return f or their end of treatment follow up visit at the end of Week 96 for DXA 
scan and other assessments detailed in the SoA Section  1.3. 
End of Study Vis it (End of Week 104) 
Participants will return for their final  end of study (EOS) visit at the end of Week 104 for vital 
sign and BIA measurements .  During this visit , site staff should assist participants in removing 
study -specific applications from their personal devices.  
If study intervention is permanently discontinued early  during one of the treatment periods , the 
EOT  visit should be conducted  at that time , followed by an EOS visit at least 12 weeks after the 
last dose of bimagrumab or placebo.

If study participation is permanently discontinued early during the post -treatment follow -up 
period, the EOS  visit should be c onducted at least 12 weeks after the last dose or bimagrumab or 
placebo . 
4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design   
The design of this Phase 2 study addresses the primary and the key secondary objectives of 
assessing if the efficacy of bimagrumab i.v. admini stered in addition to semaglutide s.c. is 
superior to either drug administered alone or to placebo and if the efficacy of bimagrumab i.v. is 
superior to s.c. semaglutide.  
The ra tionale for key  elements of the study  design include:  
 Randomization : To provide equal access to any of the treatment arms regar dless of 
gender, age, or baseline characteristics . 
 Stratification : To decrease the chance of an imbalance in gender across treatm ent 
arms  
 Triple -blind with regards to bimagrumab : The participant , Investigator  and 
Sponsor  will be blinded to bimagrumab dose and placebo -bimagrumab to avoid bias 
in adverse event and efficacy reporting, and to avoid any potential confounding effect 
of intentional and unintentional behavioral changes by participants.  
 Open  label with regard s to semaglutide:  Commercially available sem aglutide will 
be used in the study.  Because it is delivered in a pre -filled syringe, package d and 
labeled by the manufacturer , it is not possible to blind semaglutide.  The inclusion of 
two doses: a very low dose 1.0 mg and the registered dose of 2.4 mg , as well as the 
addition of the double -blinded bimagrumab treatment to all semaglutide doses, should 
mitigate the risk of bias. 
 Placebo arm : Inclusion of a placebo group will allow the analysis of whether or not 
bimagrumab treatment is more effective th an a standard treatment approach based on 
lifestyle intervention.  
 Primary endpoint : The FDA guidance for phase 3 clinical tri als in weight 
management recommends that in general, a product can be considered effective for 
weight management if after 1 year of treatment either of the following occurs:  
 The difference in mean weight loss between the active -product and placebo -
treated groups is at least  percent and the difference is statistically significant  
or 
 The proportion of participant s who lose greater than or equal to  percent of 
baseline body weight in the active -product group is at least  percent, is 
approximately t he proportion in the placebo -treated group, and the 
difference between groups is  statistically significant . 
For phase 2  clinical trials, the FDA guidance states that primary efficacy endpoint s 
should include a comparison of the mean absolute or percent change in body weight 
between the ac tive-produc t and placebo -treate d groups.

 Population: Men and women, fulfilling the criteria with regards to overweight and 
obesity from the FDA Draft Guidance [32] of being at significant risk for weight -
related morbidity and mortality, and who have already tried and failed lifestyle 
modifications. Bimagrumab is teratogenic in animal studies, therefore women who 
are not post -menopausal or post -surgical ly steriliz ed must meet  the relevant  eligibility  
criteria  to minimize the risk that women  of child -bearing potential  experience a 
contraceptive failure or should wish to become pregnant.  
 Treatment e xtension : Continued weight loss  may not be observed during the 2nd 
year of w eight loss treatment, as demonstrated in the STEP  5 study [33].  The 
extension treatment period in the current study will compare the results of 
bimagrumab and/or semaglutide treatment for continued weight loss and fat mass 
reduction in the 2nd year of treatment.  
 Post-treatment follow -up:  Prevention of weight regain following successful weight 
loss is a key challenge for obesity management .  After withdrawal of treatment, 
weight regain is common  for method s of weight loss  dependent on reduced caloric 
intake . One year after withdrawal of semaglutide, for example, participants in the 
STEP 1 trial regained two -thirds of their  prior weight loss ( Wilding  2022).   The post -
treatment follow -up period in the current study will compare the results of 
bimagrumab and/or  semaglutide  in maintenance of weight loss and composition of 
weight regain . 
4.3. Justification for Dose   
4.3.1.  Bimagrumab Doses   
This study will evaluate two doses of bimagrumab 10 mg /kg and 30 mg/kg  i.v., administered at 
baseline, Week s 4, 16, 28, 40, 52, and 64 . 
The dose of bimagrumab , 10 mg/kg  i.v., administered to healthy volunteers and  to obese/  
overweight  participant s provide d exposure levels above 10 μg/mL , at which the anabolic effect is 
observed , with levels maintained over the dosing interval of 4 weeks . PK/PD modelling has 
predicted that with dosing  of 10 mg/kg  at baseline , 4 weeks  and 16 weeks , exposures will drop 
below 10 ug/mL for approximately half the time through 24 weeks and result in  fat mass loss es 
intermediate between those expected in the placebo group and the 30 mg/kg group.  The 
10 mg/kg dose group has been included to help determine  whether a lower dose of bimagrum ab, 
when added to semaglutide, might result in near -maximal efficacy, superior tolerability, or both.  
The 30 mg/kg i.v. dose was administered  as 2 doses 8 weeks apart  in healthy volunteers and in 
patients with chronic obstructive lung disease with cachexia . A 30 mg/kg dose of  bimagrumab is 
expected to achieve circulating levels sufficient to block the ActRIIB receptor (greater than 
~10 μg/ml) over nearly all dosing intervals. A serum  level of bimagrumab above this threshold 
resulted in an increase in thigh muscle volume in  healthy volunteers.  
The loading doses of bimagrumab  4 weeks apart  is supported from a safety perspective by the 
findings from both the 13 -week  and 26-week toxicity studies with maximum exposure of 14 
weekly doses of 100  mg/kg. AUC  and C max values of the 100 mg/kg i.v. dose level in the 
cynomolgus monkey toxicity studies  are approximately 3 and 6 times greater than that expected

in humans from a secon d i.v.  dose of 30 mg/kg of bimagrumab 8 weeks apart (14,710 Pg/day/mL 
vs. 5340  Pg/day/mL and  4480  Pg/mL vs. 726 Pg/mL). While this is the first time bimagrumab 
will be administered as seven 30 mg/kg doses, it is considered safe based on the 13- and 26 -week  
toxicity study results  and the clinical data noted previously .  The PK/PD modeling predicts the 
30 mg/kg doses at baseline, and Weeks 4, 16, 28, 40, 52, and 64  will maintain exposures above 
10 Pg/mL over nearly the entire 12-week interval between doses  and yield a near-maximal 
treatment effect on fat mass loss.  
Participants in  core treatment  arms 1 (placebo; no semaglutide)  and 4 (bimagrumab 10 mg/kg; no 
semaglutide) will be switched to the higher dose of bimagrumab (30 mg/kg) during the 24 -week 
extension period in order to allow  these  participants to receive a dose of bimagrumab predicted 
to achieve maximal treatment effect  during the 2nd year. 
4.3.2.  Semaglutide Doses   
Semaglutide is a glucagon -like peptide -1 (GLP -1) receptor agonist  indicated as an adjunct to a 
reduced calorie diet and increased physical  activity for chronic weight management  in adult 
patients with an initial  BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater (obesity) or 27  kg/m2 or greater (overweight) 
in the presence of at least  one weight -related comorbid condition (e.g.,  hypertension,  type 2 
diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidemia) . 
Semaglutide is administered  s.c. once weekly, on the same day each week, at  any time of day, 
with or without meals . Treatment is i nitiate d at 0.25 mg once weekly for 4 weeks. In 4-week  
intervals,  the dose unit is increased until a dose of 2.4 mg is reached . The maintenance dose of 
Wegovy®  is 2.4 mg once weekly . In this study the higher  dose of semaglutide is the approved 
dose for obesity , while th e lower dose of 1.0 mg s.c. per week  is an approved dose for diabetes , 
and is  predicted to yield body weight loss intermediate between no semaglutide an d the 2.4 mg 
dose. The  1.0 mg dose group has been included to help determine whether a lower dose of 
semaglutide,  when added to bimagrumab , might result in near-maximal efficacy, superior 
tolerability, or both.  
4.4. End-of-Study Definition   
The end of the study is defined as the date of the last scheduled procedure shown in the schedule 
of activities for the last participant in the study , globally . 
A participant is considered to have completed the study if the participant has completed all 
periods of the study including the last scheduled procedure shown in the SoA  Section  1.3. 
5. STUDY POPULATION   
 overweight/obese men  and women  aged 18 F 80 years (inclusive) will be 
enrolled in the study.  
The Investigator  must ensure that all participants  being considered for the study satisfy  the 
inclusion/exclusion  criteria. No additional criteria should be applied by the Investigator , in order 
that the study population will be representative of all eligible participant s.

5.3. Lifestyle Considerations   
5.3.1.  Meals and Dietary Restrictions   
Study participants  will be counseled to follow a modest calorie restrict ed diet with a daily deficit 
of approximately 500 kcal . The following is a recommended, but not required, breakdown  of 
daily calories: approximately 45 -50% from carbohydrate, 20 -25% from protein and 30% from fat 
intake throughout the study . Participants wi ll be advised to consume  at least 1.2 g/kg/body 
weight of protein as per guidelines for daily  recommended protein intake  for anabolism (WHO 
guidelines 2015).  
Counselling will be conducted by a dietician or a similar qualified healthcare professional every 
4 week s during the study  via visits/phone contacts  to encourage dietary intake that will promote 
weight loss  and document any change in dietary habits . During these dietician contacts , 
participants  will be asked to re call all food and dr ink they have consumed in the previous 24 
hours . 
If BMI ≤ 22 kg/m2 is reached during the study, the recommended daily energy intake may be 
recalculated to promote weight maintenance.   If further, potentially undesirable weight loss 
continues, or if BMI is ≤ 18.5 kg/m2, the investigator should contact the Sponsor to discuss 
whether it is medically appropriate for the participant to continue  in the study . See SOM for 
more information related to assessing dietary intake and calculating nutrient needs.  
Participants  must fast for at least 8 hours prior to all visits  that include blood sampling  i.e., 
without food or liquids, except for water. Study medication and any medication which should be 
taken with or after a meal should be withheld on the day of the visit until blood samples have 
been obtained . 
For visits where PD samples are collected for analysis by the central lab,  if the participant is not 
fasting as required, the participant  should be called in for a new visit as soon as possible to have 
the fasting procedures done. Procedures requiring participants to fast include blood sampling of 
fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting serum insulin and lipid assessment s. 
Participants should  restrict alcohol consumption for the 24 hours  prior to study visits .

Page 64 of 112 
5.3.2.  Activity   
Participants will be encouraged  to engage in at least 150 min utes of physical activity per week 
e.g., walking  or climbing stairs . The  device worn by participants  will be used to 
collect activity data.  
Additional details of the physical activity  program and the  device can be found in the 
SOM . 
5.3.3.  Other Restrictions   
Participant s should refrain from smoking for one hour prior  to study visits and during the study 
visits. 
Women of childbearing potential must  use an intrauterine device (IUD) , from at least 3 months 
before the baseline visit  through  at least 4 months after the last dose  of bimagrumab/placebo i.v. , 
and use an additional contraceptive (barrier) method  after the screening visit  through at least 4 
months after the last dose of bimagrumab/placebo . Additional information on h ighly effective 
contraception methods is provided in Section  10.4 Appendix 4. 
5.3.4.  Support During Treatment Withdrawal Period   
During the treatment withdrawal period, partic ipants will continue to have access to personnel 
who have experience in providing diet and exerci se counseling. Options for additional resources 
to help lifestyle management will also be available to participants during this time.  
5.4. Screen Failures   
A screen failure occurs when a participant who has consented to participate in the clinical study 
is not subsequently assigned to study interventio n, either due to a failure to meet the eligibility 
criteria  or by choosing not to proceed to enrollment . 
A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen 
failure participants to meet the CONSORT publishing requirements and to respond to queries 
from regulatory autho rities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, 
eligibility criteria, and any SAE.  
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study may be rescreen ed once at 
the discretion of the Investigator . Rescreened  participants should be assigned a new screening  
number for every screening/rescreening event.   Individuals with laboratory  assessments that a re 
outside of the Week -6 to Day -1 window may be reassessed once within the same screening 
event (without requiring a new screening number ). 
6. STUDY INTERVENTION(S) AND CONCOMITANT THERAPY   
Study interventions are all pre -specified, investigational,  and non -investigational medicinal 
products, medical devices and other interventions (e.g., behavioral) intended to be administered 
to the study participants during the study conduct.  
A summary of study interventions administered in this study is found in Table  2. Treatment arms 
are listed in Table  3.

6.2. Preparation, Handling, Storage, and Accountability    
The Investigator  or designee must confirm appropriate conditions ( e.g., temperature) have been 
main tained during transit for all study intervention received, and any disc repancies reported and 
resolved before use of the study intervention.  
Only participants enrolled in the study may r eceive study intervention, and only authorized site 
staff may supply, prepare, or administer study intervention.  
All study intervention must be stored in a se cure, environmentally controlled, and monitored 
(manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited 
to the Investigator  and authorized site staff.  
The Investigator  and study pharmacist  are responsible for study intervention accountability, 
reconciliation, and record maintenance ( i.e., receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition 
records).  
Further guidance and information for  the final disposition of unused study interventions are 
provided in the pharmacy  manual . 
6.3. Assignment to Study Intervention   
Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of nine treatment arms using a centralized 
interactive  web randomization system (I WRS) . Before the study is initiated, directions for the 
log-in information  will be provided to each site.  
Randomization will be balanced in  a 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio with  approximately  participants 
per treatment arm. Stratification across the treatment  arms will be based on gender.  
The randomization schedule will be generated as a randomized block design using SAS version 
9.4 or higher.  
The randomization number becomes definitive once a participant has been dosed and it may not 
be reassigned.

6.4. Blinding   
The study is triple blinded to the study participant , Investigator and Sponsor  with respect to 
bimagrumab and bimagrumab  placebo and open labe l with respect to semaglutide.   Blinding will 
remain intact at least until database is locked for the Week 48  primary analysis .  Additional 
details regarding blinding and unblinding will be described in the SAP and a separate blinding 
and unblinding plan.  
6.4.1.  Bimagrumab  and Placebo   
All treatment arms  are triple blinded  with regards to  bimagrumab and bimagrumab placebo  
(participants/ Investigator s, Sponsor ). The IWRS will be programmed with blind -breaking 
instructions. In case of an emergency, the Investigator  has the sole responsibility for determining 
if unblinding of a participants’ intervention assignment is warranted. Participant safety must 
always be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the Investigator  decides that 
unblinding is war ranted, the Investigator  may, at the Investigator ’s discretion, contact the 
Sponsor  to discuss the situation prior to unblinding a participant’s intervention assignment unless 
this could delay emergency treatment for the participant. If a participant’s int ervention 
assignment is unblinded, the Sponsor  must be notified within 24  hours of this occurrence. The 
date and reason for the unblinding must be recorded.  
6.4.2.  Semaglutid e  
Because a  placebo of semaglutide is not available  for this study , the study cannot be double 
blinded to all semaglutide treatments. Therefore, participants assigned to a combination of 
semaglutide with bimagrumab or its placebo (approximately N= 330) will be aware o f their open 
label semaglutide dosage but blinded to the bimagrumab /placebo assignment and  dosage.  
Potential bias will be reduced through central randomization.  
6.4.3.  SAE and Unblinding   
Sponsor safety staff may unblind the intervention assignment for any participant with an SAE. If 
the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, 
a copy of the report, identifying the participant’s interven tion assignment, may be sent to 
Investigator s in accordance with local regulations and/or Sponsor  policy.  
6.4.4.  Unblinded Personnel   
With the exception of any unblinded site staff identified below, all site staff (including study 
Investigator  and study nurse) will be blinded to study treatment throughout the study.  
Unblinded study personal will include:  
 Unblinded  site pharmacist  or pharmacy staff  
 Unblinded study monitor  
Bimagrumab and it s placebo will be supplied as bulk in boxes containing 3 vials per box . An 
unblinded pharmacist or other qualified trained personnel, who is independent of the study team, 
will be required  to prepare study drug  bags for infusion . They are the only site level personnel 
who will have access to t reatment assignments.

Appropriate measures must be taken by the unblinded pha rmacist to ensure that the treatment 
assignments are concealed from the rest of the site staff. Any potential visible difference in 
treatments will be concealed by the use of an opaque sleeve . 
6.5. Study Intervention Compliance   
When the individual dose for a participant is prepared, the preparation of the dose will be 
confirmed by a nother unblinded study staff  member.  
When participants are dosed at the site, they will receive study int ervention directly from the 
Investigator  or designee, under medical supervision. The date and time of each dose 
administered in the clinic will be recorded in the source documents. The dose of study 
intervention and study participant identification will be  confirmed at the time of dosing by a 
member of the study site staff other than the person administering the study intervention.  
In treatment arms receiving semaglutide,  when participants self -administer semaglutide  at home, 
compliance with study intervent ion will be assessed at each visit. Compliance will be assessed 
by direct questioning, checking of participant diary,  and return of all used and unused medication  
during the site visits and documented in the source documents and relevant form. Deviation(s) 
from the prescribed dosage regimen should be recorded.  
A record of the quantity of study interventions  dispensed to and administered to/by each 
participant must be maintained and reconciled with study intervention and compliance records. 
Intervention start and stop dates, including dates for intervention delays and/or dose reductions 
will also be recorded.  
6.6. Dose Modification   
6.6.1.  Bimagrumab   
No dose modification (up or down titration)  of bimagrumab  is allowed.   Interruption of dosing 
may be  allowed for safety reasons (see Section  7.1.1 ). 
6.6.2.  Semaglutide   
Semaglutide is initiate d at 0.25 mg once weekly for 4 weeks. Dose is increased i n 4-week 
intervals  until a dose of 2.4 mg is reached  for the 2.4 mg dose arm s and until 1.0 mg is reached 
for the 1.0 mg dose arm s. 
If participants  do not tolerate the maintenance 2.4 mg once -weekly dose, the dose can be 
temporarily  decreased to 1.7 mg once -weekly, for a maximum of 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, 
semaglutide  should be increased to the  maintenance  dose of  2.4 mg once weekly . 
If participants  do not tolerate the planned dose -escalation schedule , they  may drop back to the 
highest previously tolerated dose and  extend that dose  for an additional one week, and then  re-
attempt dose escalation at least once.  If the higher dose is not tolera ted, the participant can step 
down and remain on the lower , highest -tolerated  dose.

discontinuation of study treatment , even if confirmation testing is pending . In the 
event of pregnancy, report as described above.   
 Any protocol deviation  that results  in a significant risk  to the  participant ’s safety .
 Emergence of one or more adverse events that in the judgment of the Investigator , 
considering  the participant ’s overall status, prevent the participant  from safely 
continuing in the   study . 
Investigational  treatment  may be discontinued  under  the following  circumstances:  
 Breaking  of the blind  (inadvertently  or for emergency  reasons)
 Liver, pancreas, or muscle related adverse event  as described in Sections 10.6, 10.7, 
and 10.8.
Participants  who discontinue study treatment should NOT be considered withdrawn from the 
study UNLESS they withdraw their consent. They should return approximately 12 weeks after 
their last dose of bimagrumab/place bo for the E nd of Study  visit as described above . If they fail 
to return for these assessments for unknown reasons, ever y effort should be made to contact them 
as specified in Section  7.3. 
7.1.1.  Liver , Pancreas, or Muscle  Related Events  Stopping Criteria   
Study treatment  may be interrupted or  discontinued if a participant meets one of the conditions 
for liver, pancreas or muscle related adverse events,  as out lined in the algorithm s in 
Section s 10.6, 10.7, and  10.8, Appendi ces 6, 7, and 8, or if the Investigator  believes it is in the 
best interest of the participant , even if the criteria are not met .  At the Week 4  and Week 64  
visits, participants’ safety lab results  must be available and reviewed against the guidance in 
Appendices 6, 7, and 8 in advance of dose administration  with bimagrumab/placebo . 
7.1.2.  Temporary Discontinuation   
No temporary discontinuation is allowed  except for management of adverse events, as described 
in Section 7.1.1 . Refer to Section 6.6.2  if the current semaglutide dose cannot be tolerated, and

any further evaluations nee ded for follow up of adverse events.   Participants should return at 
least 12 weeks after their last dose of bimagrumab/placebo for the End of Study visit . 
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosu re of future information, the Sponsor  may retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.  
If a participant withdraws from the study, the participant may request destruction of any samples 
taken and not tested, and the Investigator  must document this in the site study records.  
7.3. Lost to Follow -up  
A participant  will be considered lost to follow -up if the participant repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.  
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit:  
 The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as 
soon as possible, counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule and  ascertain whether the participant wishes to and/or shoul d 
continue in the study.  
 Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the Investigator  or designee must 
make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone 
calls, and if necessary, a certified letter to the participan t’s last known mailing 
address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented 
in the participant’s medical record.  
 Should the participant continue to be unreachable, the participant will be considered 
"lost to follow -up”. 
7.4. Treatme nt Arm and Study Stopping/Pausing Rules   
The study will be paused and no further dosing and/or new recruitment will occur pending full 
safety review by the DMC, if any of the belo w criteria are met. After a safety review by the 
DMC, the DMC will recommend  to the sponsor either to continue the study, to stop an arm  or to 
stop the study . The study may resume following the safety review, if the DMC and Sponsor 
agree it is safe to proc eed and necessary approvals have been obtained from authorities according 
to local regulations.  
 Any death considered to be related to study treatment . 
 Two or more participants experience a TESAEs of a similar type (other than death, 
corresponding to NCI -CTCAE grade 3 or higher) considered to be related to blinded 
study treatment , unless expected per Reference Safety Information.  
 One or more participants develop a life -threatening (NCI -CTCAE grade 4) or fatal 
acute allergic reaction within 24 hours following study treatment administration (i.e., 
active drug /placebo ), unless clearly caused by exposure to a known allergen (e.g., 
peanut allergy).

8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES   
Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA  Section  1.3. Protocol  waivers or 
exemptions are not allowed.  Visits should be performed as close to the plann ed timepoint as 
possible , with a visit window of +/- 7 days, with the following exceptions:  
 All required Screening assessments must be completed within Week -6 and Day -1.  
Any screening assessments that a re outside of this range may be repeated once  
witho ut screen failing.  
 For the baseline visit, DXA scans may be performed up to 14 days prior to the 
baseline visit.  For all other visits, the DXA assessment window is -2 weeks to +1 
week of the scheduled time.  
  (Week 4) and  (Week 64) dosing  should be per formed within a visit 
window of -2 to +14 days . 
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA  Section  1.3, is 
essential and required for study conduct.  
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants 
meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator  will maintain a screening log to record details of all 
participants screened and to confirm eligibility or recor d reasons for screening failure, as 
applicable.

In the event of a significan t study -continuity issue ( e.g., caused by a pandemic), alternate 
strategies for participant visits, assessments, medication distribution and monitoring may be 
implemented by the Sponsor  or the Investigator , as per local health authority/ethics requirements.  
Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the 
samples.  
8.1. Administrative Procedures   
Demographic and baseline characteristic data will include  year of birth , sex, race, predominant 
ethnicity.  
Relevant medical history and current medical conditions will be recorded. Where possible, 
diagnoses but not symptoms will be recorded.  Investiga tors have the discretion to record

abnormal test findings as medical history,  if in their  judgment, the  test abnormality  occurred 
prior  to the  informed consent  signature.  
Disease history  will include duration of obesity/overweight ( number of years).  Obesity -related 
comorbidities will be recorded on the Medical History form, along with assessment of  status of 
these at end of study . 
All current medications and significant non -drug therapies must be listed on the Concomitant 
medications  eCRF . 
Urine drug  screening will be  performed,  and the results kept as source data.  
Body height  will be measured as described in the SOM . 
8.2. Efficacy / Pharmacodynamics  Assessments   
Planned timepoints for all efficacy  and pharmacodynamic assessments are provided in the SoA  
Section  1.3. Additional d etails of the methods to perform  assessments are provided in the SOM.  
8.2.1.  Anthropometric Measurements   
8.2.1.1.  Body Weight   
Body weight will be measured in kilograms (kg) to the nearest 0.1 kg, in light indoor clothing, 
without shoes and on an empty bladder, using the scale provided by the Sponsor th roughout the 
trial. 
8.2.1.2.  Waist Circumference   
Waist circumference will be measured in standing position with a non -stretchable measuring tape 
and to  the nearest 0.1 centimeter (cm) .  The measurement should be taken with the participant  
standing  and with the waist area unclothed.  The tape should be positioned around the participant , 
parallel to the floor, with the lower edge of the tape at the level of the posterolateral  superior iliac 
crest bilaterally and the circumference measured at the end of a normal expiration.  
The same type of measuring tape should be used throughout the trial. The measuring tape will be 
provided by the Sponsor to ensure standardization.  
8.2.1.3.  Body Mass  Index   
BMI will be calculated in the electronic case report form (e CRF ) using the following formula:  
 BMI = Body weight (kg) / [Height (m)]2 
8.2.1.4.  Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis   
Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a widely used method for estimating body 
composition. The technology is relatively simple, quick, and noninvasive. BIA is currently used 
in diverse settings, including private clinicians’ offices, health clubs, and hospitals, and across a 
spectrum of ages, body weights, and disease states. An estimate of total body water (TBW) is 
derived by measuring electrical impedance of body tissues, fr om which fat -free mass (FFM) , 
lean ( muscle ) mass,  and body fat (adiposity) are estimated.

8.2.2.  DXA  Scan   
Dual energy X -ray absorptiometry (DXA) will be used to assess changes in body composition,  
including total fat and lean body mass (FBM and LBM) , trunk fat mass , visceral adipose tissue  
(VAT) , subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT),  and bone mineral density  (total body, lumbar spine, 
hip). 
Quality  assurance  is an important  issue  in the use of DXA  scans  to determine  body  composition. 
DXA instrument manufacturer and model should remain consistent,  and their  calibration should 
be monitored throughout the study. Use of a standardized scan acquisition  protocol and 
appropriate and unchanging scan acquisition and analysis software is essential to  achieve 
consistent results. Likewise, because of variability in interpretation of the scans, it is  important  to 
utilize  centralized  scan analysis  by experienced  staff.  
Data  collection  and processing  is explained  in the Imagi ng Manual  written and provided by 
the imaging CRO.  DXA scans will be sen t to the imaging CRO for central reading . Results  must 
remain blinded to Investigator  and participant  until database  lock, however medically significant 
incidental findings (e.g. , tumor) not related to the study analyses can be disclosed to the 
Investigator  as appropriate for the medical care of the participant . 
8.2.4.  Impact of Weight on Quality of Life -Lite Clinical Trial s Version

8.2.6.2.  Glucose Metabolism Parameters: Hb A1c, Fasting Insulin and Glucose   
With the exception of the screening visit, s amples  for insulin  and glucose  will be collected  
under fasting conditions . Glucose will be  measured by the local lab for safety . HbA1c  and 
fasting insulin will be measured by the central laboratory , per the study’s Laboratory Manual,  at 
timepoints indicated in the SoA Section  1.3. 
The Homeostatic model assessment 2 – insulin resistance index (HOMA -IR) and the quantitative 
insulin -sensitivity check index (QUICKI) are derived  insulin  resistance  index es that will be  
calculated  by data management . 
8.3. Safety Assessments   
Planned timepoints for all safety  assessments are provided in the SoA  Section  1.3. Details of the 
methods to perform assessment s are provided in the SOM.  
8.3.1.  Physical Examinations   
A complete physical examination  will be performed at all listed visits and will  include  the 
examination of general appearance, skin, neck (including thyroid), eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, 
heart, abdomen , back, lymph nodes, extremities , vascular , and neurological systems. If indicated 
based on medical history  and/or  symptoms, additional e xams may  be performed.  
Skin assessment should include findings of new , or worsening , and significant acne or skin 
lesions . 
For males, a bilateral assessment and measurement of gynecomastia (breast tissue diameter) will 
be made , if present . 
Investigator s should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses  
and to those listed under “Warnings and precautions” for Wegovy®  or Ozempic® . 
8.3.2.  Vital Signs   
Temperature, pulse rate, and blood pressure will be recorded (before blood collection for 
laboratory tests).  
Blood pressure and pulse rate measurements will be assessed in a sitting position  with a 
completely automated device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not 
available  or not suitable for the participant . 
Blood pressure and pulse rate measurements should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of rest f or 
the participant in a quiet setting without distractions ( e.g., television, cell phones).  
If a b lood pressure measurement  is out of range, it  may be rep eated once, after the participant has 
rested for at least 5 minutes.

8.3.3.  Electrocardiograms   
A standard  12-lead ECG  will be performed with the participant in a supine position,  using an 
ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF 
intervals . Interpretation of the tracing must be made by a qualified physician and documented on 
the ECG and in the ECG section of the  eCRF . 
Each ECG trac ing should be labeled with the study  number, participant initials, participant 
number and date, and kept in the source documents  at the  study site. Clinically significant 
abnormalities should be recorded on the relevant medical  history  eCRF  page  prior  to informed  
consent  signature  and on the Adverse  Events  page  thereafter.  Clinically  significant  findings  must  
be discussed  with the Sponsor . 
The eCRF  will contain  the date and time of ECG , PR and RR  interval s, QT interval , QTcF , and 
QRS  duration . 
The Fridericia QT correction formula (QTcF) should be used for clinical decisions.  
Unless  auto calculated  by the ECG  machine,  the Investigator  must  calculate  QTcF.  See the Site 
Operations  Manual  for additional  details.  
Original  ECG  tracings,  appropriately  signed,  will be archived  at study  site. 
8.3.4.  Clinical Safety Laboratory Tests   
All protocol -required safety lab tests, as defined in Section  10.2 Appendix 2, must be conducted 
in accordance with the SoA  Section  1.3. 
The Investigat or must review the laboratory results, document this review, and record any 
clinically significant changes occurring during the study as an AE.  
Abnormal laboratory findings associated with the underlying disease are not considered 
clinically significant un less judged by the Investigator  to be more severe than expected for the 
participant’s condition . 
All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation 
in the study or until 30 days from the EOS visit  should be r epeated until the values return to 
normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by the Investigator  or 
medical monitor.  Additional guidance for the follow up of abnormal liver and pancreas tests , as 
well as elevated CK,  is provided in the safety monitoring section of this protocol and 
Sections  10.6, 10.7, and 10.8, Appendices 6 , 7, and 8. 
If clinically significant  values do not return to normal/baseline within a period  judged reasonable 
by the Investigator , the etiology should be identified, and the Sponsor  notified.  
If laboratory values from non -protocol -specified laboratory tests performed at the institution’s 
local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered clinically 
significant by the Investigator  (e.g., SAE or AE or dose modification) , then the results must be 
recorded.

8.3.5.  Pregnancy Testing   
Serum pregnancy test is required for all female participants at screening  and for confirmation of 
any positive urine pregna ncy test . 
For all other visits, u rine dipstick pregnancy test ing will be required  for pre -menopausal female 
participants, unless serum is required based on local requirements. Women surgically sterilized  
(but pre -menopausal ) are still required to complete pregnancy tests. In case urine dipstick 
pregnancy test is positive, it must be co nfirmed with a serum pregnancy test prior to dosing . All 
positive urine test s will be followed up by a serum test . 
A negative test result is required prior to receiving any study medication.  
Additional serum or urine pregnancy tests may be performed, as determined necessary by the 
Investigator , or required by local regulation, to establish the absence of pregnancy at any time 
during the participant’s participation in the study.  
8.3.6.  Hematology /Coag ulation   
Hemoglobin,  hematocrit, red blood cell count, RBC indices, white  blood  cell count  with 
differential  (e.g., neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, monocytes, lymphocytes), e rythrocyte 
sedimentation  rate, platelet  count,  aPTT, and PT/INR will be measured.  
8.3.7.  Blood Chemistry   
Blood chemistry should be assessed after a fast of approximately 8 hours. Blood chemistry  will 
include  sodium,  potassium,  calcium,  magnesium,  bicarbonate/CO 2, chloride,  phosphate or 
phosphorus, creatinine, BUN or urea, glucose, uric acid, albumin, total protein, alkaline  
phosphatase, total and direct bilirubin, LDH, GGT, AST, ALT, amylase, lipase, and CK. 
If the total bilirubin  concentration  is increased  above 1.5 x ULN , direct  and indirect bilirubin 
should  be obtained . 
Additional  safety  labs may be performed  at the Investigator ’s discretion  for any 
clinically/medically  significant abnormalities.  
8.3.8.  Urinalysis  and Urine Chemistry   
A midstream urine sample (approx. 30 mL) will be obtained in order to avoid contamination  with 
epithelial  cells and sediments  and to allow  proper  assessment.  Required  assessment s include  
occult blood, pH, specific gravity, ketones, glucose, protein, bilirubin, nitrite and  leukocytes.  A 
microscopic examination will be performed if blood or protein are abnormal.  The sample will 
also be used for measurement of urine microalbumin an d urine creatinine, for calculation of 
urine albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR).  
8.4. Adverse Events , Treatment Emergent Adverse Events,  Serious 
Adverse Events, and Other Safety Reporting   
The definitions  of AEs , TEAEs,  and SAEs  unsolicited and solicited adverse events can be found 
in Section  10.3 Appendix  3.

The Investigator  and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE  or SAE and remain responsible for following 
up all AEs . This includes events reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a 
caregiver, surrogate, or the participant’s legally authorized representative).  
The method of recording, evaluating, and assess ing causality of AEs  and SAEs  and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section  10.3 
Appendix  3. 
8.4.1.  Time Period and  Frequency for Collecting AE , TEAE  and SAE Information   
All SAEs will be collected from the time of the signature of the informed consent until the EoS 
visit and  will be recorded in the database for all randomized participants .  Non-serious adverse 
events will be collected from the time of first dose of study medication(s)  until the EoS visit  
(treatment -emergent adverse events [TEAEs] ).  Non -serious medical condit ions identified during 
the screening period should be recorded as medical histor y. 
The Investigator will record and report a ll SAEs to the Sponsor or designee immediately and 
under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Section  10.3 Appendix 3. The 
Investigator  will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor  within 24 hours of it being 
available.  
Investigator s are not obligated to actively seek information on AEs or SAEs after conclusion of 
the study participation . However, if the Investigator  learns of any SAE, incl uding a death, at any 
time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and the Investigator  considers the 
event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the Investigator  
must promptly notify the Sponsor . 
8.4.2.  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs   
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator  is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs and AEs of special interest (as defined in 
Section  8.4.5 ) will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or 
the participant  is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section  7.3). Further information on follow -up 
procedures is provided in Section  10.3 Appendix 3. 
8.4.3.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs   
Prompt not ification by the Investigator  to the Sponsor  of an SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
The Sponsor  has a leg al responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor  will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety re porting to 
the regulatory authority, institutional review boards (IRBs)/independent ethics committees 
(IECs) , and Investigator s. 
An Investigator  who receives an Investigator  Notification /Safety Report describing an SAE or 
other specific safety information ( e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor  will

review and then file it along with the IB/package insert and will notify the IRB/IEC, if 
appropriate according to local requirements.  
Investigator  Notification/S afety Reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (SUSARs) according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor  policy and 
forwarded to all participating Investigator s. 
8.4.4.  Pregnancy   
Details of all pregnancies in female participants , or in female partners of male participants,  
occurring in the study and until 4 months after  the last dose of study drug  (if the participant was 
on active drug ) will be collected  to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The Investigator  
will collect the follow -up information on the participant  and the neonate and forward  the 
information  to the Sponsor . 
If a pregnancy is reported  or detected , the Investigator  will record  pregnancy information on the 
appropriate form and submit it to  the Sponsor  within 24 hours  of learning of the pregnancy.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy for med ical reasons will be reported as an AE or SAE.  
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes ( e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs and will be reported as such.  
Any post -study pregnancy -related SAE considered reasonably related to the study intervention 
by the Investigator  will be reported to the Sponsor  as described in Section  8.4.4 . While the 
Investigator  is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study participants , he or 
she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.  
Any female participant who becomes pregnant or has a positive pregnancy t est while 
participating in the study must discontinue study intervention  immediately . 
8.4.5.  Treatment Emergent  Adverse Events of Special Interest   
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) for bimagrumab are defined based on  an ongoing 
review of all safety data and include  (using CTCAE intensity grading) : 
 Muscle related events ( e.g., rhabdomyolysis, muscle spasm,  cramps , twitching , 
tightness ) [at lea st grade 3] 
 Skin lesions (e.g., acne, growths ) [at least grade 3] 
 Pancreatitis  
 Gastrointestin al events ( e.g., diarrhea , nausea ) [at least grade 3] 
 Malignancy   
8.5. Pharmacokinetics   
Serum bimagrumab and plasma semaglutide concentrations  (as applicable)  will be evaluated in 
samples collected from all participants according to the SoA  Section  1.3.

antibodies binding to bimagrumab  (anti-drug-antibodies, ADA)  and the titer of confirmed 
positive samples will be reported. Other analyses may be performed to evaluate the neutralizing 
activity or verify the stability of antibodies to bimagrumab  and/or further characterize the 
immunogenicity of bimagrumab . 
Instructions  for the collection and handling of biolog ical samples will be provided in the 
laboratory manual.  
Results will not be reported to investigative sites or blinded personnel until the study has been 
unblinded . 
Information on storage and future use of samples is detailed in Section  10.1.5.1 . 
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalized prior to the primary  efficacy analysis  (e.g., 
when participants complete Week 48)  and it will include a more technical and detailed 
description of the endpoints to be summarized and the statistical analyses described in this 
section. This section is a summar y of the planned statistical analyse s of the key endpoints , 
subject to possible modifications in the final SAP . 
9.1. Statistical Analyses   
The primary objective is to assess the effect of varying doses of bimagrumab, semaglutide and 
bimagrumab in addition to semaglutide on body weight  after 48 weeks of treatment .  Change in 
body weight  is the primary outcome to be analyzed.  The proportion of participants in each 
treatment group who achieve  )?-1/0<47;;7. 7>-:<0-+7=:;-7.<:-)<5-6<?144 also be 
summarized and compared to control .  A viable treatment outcome will be one that shows either:  
 The difference in mean weight loss between the active -product and placebo -treated 
groups is at le ast % and the difference is  statistically significant,  
or 
 The proportion of participants  who lose greater than or equal to % of baseline body 
weight in the active -product group is at least %, is approximately  the proportion 
in the placebo -treate d group, and the difference between groups is statistically significant .

The FDA guidance for phase 3 clinical trials in weight management recommends that in general, 
a product can be considered effective for wei ght management if after 1 year of treatment either 
of the following occurs:  
 The difference in mean weight loss between the active -product and placebo -treated 
groups is at least  percent and the di fference is statistically significant  
or 
 The proportion of participant s who lose greater than or equal to  percent of baseline 
body weight in the active -product group is at least  percent, is approximately  
the proportion in the placebo -treated group, and the difference between groups is 
statistically significant.  
For phase 2 clinical trials,  the FDA guidance states that primary efficacy endpoints should 
include a comparison of the mean absolute or percent change in body weight between the active -
product and placebo -treated groups.  
All randomized participants who received at least one dose of study medication will be included 
in an intention -to-treat population (treatment policy strategy) . Baseline and efficacy results will 
be summarized by randomized treatment arm , with active treatment  arms compared to placebo , 
and combination treatment  arms  to each monotherapy of the same dose . 
The analyses to be performed will be similar to  the primary analysis described above.  Details of 
these analyses will be provided in the SAP.  
9.1.1.  Multiplicity Adjustment   
No multiplicity adjustment will be performed for this study . 
9.2. Analysis Sets   
For the purposes of statistical analysis and data summaries, the following analysis sets are 
defined:  
Analysis Set Description 
Full analysis set (FAS) 1. All participants who meet eligibility criteria, sign the informed 
consent and are randomized to a treatment arm, regardless of 
exposure to investigational products, are included in the FAS. 
Safety analysis set (SAF) 2. All participants who meet the definition of FAS and who are 
exposed to at least one dose of investigational products (including 
placebo) are included in the SAF. 
The FAS will be used to summarize demographi cs and baseline characteristics and analyze 
endpoints related to the efficacy objectives. Participant s will be grouped in summaries and 
included in the analyses according to the planned investigational inte rvention.  
The SAF will be used to summarize and analyz e the endpoints relate to safety and tolerability. 
Participant s will be grouped in summaries and included in the analyses according to the highest 
dose level of investigational products they actually re ceived.

9.3. Interim Analysis   
An interim analysis (IA)  will be conducted when approximately % of the participants 
complete the Week 24 visit. The interim analysis will evaluate efficacy as well as the safety 
profile of both the combination and monotherapy treatment arms, and may be used to help 
determine th e doses of bimagrumab to be used in future studies . 
9.4. Treatment Extension and Post-Treatment Follow -Up Period 
Analyses   
There will be no contemporaneous placebo /no treatment  group with data through the extension 
phase since all participant s originally enrolled into the placebo /no treatment  arm will be switched 
to 30 mg/kg bimagrumab.  Likewise, all participant s originally enrolled into the 10 mg/kg 
bimagrumab arm will switch to 30 mg/kg bimagrumab.  All other arms will remain unchanged.  
As a result, the maximum placebo response will be considered the response at the end of the core 
phase (48 weeks).  Analyses and summaries of treatment effect will continue to be based on the 
original randomization assignments. Analy ses and summaries of treatment effect at 72 weeks 
will be provided .  
After 72 weeks, all participants  remaining in the study will be withdrawn from treatment and 
followed for an additional 24 weeks.  Analyses  and summaries of withdrawal effect will be 
provided .  
Details of analysis methods will be presented i n an SAP for the extension phase.  
9.5. Sample Size Determination   
 participants will be randomized to 1 of 9 treatment groups. The sample size 
calculation is based on the primary efficacy estimand for weight.   Based on the FDA guidance on 
treatment for weight m anagement, the minimum meaningful treatment effect for weight loss is 
5% of baseline body weight over 1 year of treatment.   Assuming the minimum treatment effect 
of % weight loss (approximately 5 kg) with a standard deviation (SD) of , for a minimum 
effect size of   [2, 3] , a sample size of  participants per treatment arm will have 
approximately % statistical power to detect a treatment difference between any active group 
and placebo /no treatment  using a 2 -sided t-test at alpha .   Assum ing a % dropout rate, 
enrollment will target  participant s per treatment arm.  
Sample size was estimated using a t-test for 2 means  in NQuery Advisor V9.1 
(www.statsols.com).  [4, 5] .

enzyme or hormone levels may indicate a need for further isozyme  or related hormone analys es 
to better understand the results. These results may be included in the clinical study report.  
Future use may also include , but is  not limited to , using residual samples for analytical purposes 
(e.g., to cross check between different sites and/or for stability assessment). Given the 
exploratory nature of the work, the analytical method used for those assessments may not be 
validated.  As such, the results from this exploratory analysis will not be included in the clinical 
study report.  
The Sponsor  may store samples for up to 15 years after the end of the study to achieve study

related or new treatments or research methods.  
During the conduct of the study, an individual participant can choose to  withdraw consent to 
have biological specimens stored for futur e research. However, withdrawal of consent regarding  
biosample storage may not be possible after the study is completed.  
10.1.6.  Data Safety Committee   
Participant safety will be continuously monitored by th e site Investigator  and medical monitor , 
which includes safety signal detection at any time during the study.  
In addition, an early aggregated safety data review will be performed  by the DMC , the goal of 
which is to ensure no emerging safety trends . An initial safety review for this study is planned 
for the first  % of participants who are dosed and have provided safety data for  at least  days 
after administration of the first dose.  Enrollment will not be  paused during the review . 
Thereafter, the DMC will meet periodically , with ad hoc meeting s as necessary.  
The committee will consist of at least 2 i ndependent clinicians, knowledgeable in bariatric 
treatment, and 1 biostatistician. Prior to initiati ng enrollment, a DMC charter will be drafted and 
approved by the committee members. The primary role of the DMC i s to advise on study 
conduct that will ensure participant safety. Th is may include recommendations to discontinue a 
specific  treatment arm that appears to be showing characteristics of intolerance , or the study as a 
whole .  Unblinded data may be provided t o the DMC in accordance with the DMC charter . 
Although the DMC may make recommendations to the Sponsor about changes in the conduct  of 
the study, final decisions will be made by the Sponsor . In the case of early termination,  
consultation  with Health Authorities may  be required.  
Members of the DMC will not share any unblinded or semi -blinded information with anyone  
outside  of the DMC.  Particularly,  the Sponsor  blinded team members will remain  fully  blinded  
to any results  throughout the study unless the  DMC recommends changes in the conduct of the 
study (for  example,  early  termination  due to negative  safety  findings).  
An independent statistical reporting team not involved in the conduct of the studies will  prepare  
the information  for the DMC  according  to the specifications  from  the DMC  statistician.  The 
main tasks may  include:  
 Generation of blinded and/or unblinded outputs for the DMC, including tables, 
figures, and listings, as   required.

 Preparation  of any other  reports  requested  by the DMC  during  the closed  session.
 Review  of the data reports  before  sending  to the DMC.
10.1.7.  Site Monitoring   
Before an investigational site can enroll participants into the study, the Sponsor  or designee will 
visit the investigational study site to:  
 Determine the adequacy of the facilities . 
 Discuss with the Investigator (s) and other personnel their responsibilities regarding  
protocol adherence  and applicable regulations . This will be documented in a Clinical 
Study Agreement between the Sponsor /designee and the Investigator . 
 Sites which have been qualified for a previous Sponsor  study within the past 2 years 
or sites participating in low -risk st udies, do not need an onsite visit and may be 
qualified remotely.  
During the study, the Sponsor or designee will have regular contacts with the investigational site, 
for the following:  
 Provide information and support to the Investigator (s). 
 Confirm that fa cilities remain acceptable . 
 Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol and that data are 
being accurately recorded in the case report forms . 
 Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the case 
report forms with the participant’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and 
other records relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original 
records for each participant (e.g. , clinic charts).  
 Record and report any protocol deviations  not previously sent to the 
Sponsor/designee.  
 Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on  eCRF s and confirm any 
SAEs have been forwarded to the Sponsor/ designee  and those SAEs that met criteria 
for reporting have been forwarded to the IRB.  
The mo nitor will be available between visits if the Investigator (s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
10.1.8.  Clinical Monitoring   
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure that  the rights and well -being of trial participants 
are protected, that the reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, and that the 
conduct of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol/amendment(s), with 
International Co nference on Harmoni zation  Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), and with 
applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
Monitoring for this study will be performed by the CRO.

done, at what level of detail monitoring will be performed, and the distribution of monitoring 
reports.  
Independent audits may be conducted by Sponsor/designee  to ensure monitoring practices are 
performed consistently across all participating sites and that monitors are following the CMP . 
10.1.9.  Audits and Inspections   
Authorized representatives of the Sponsor, a regulatory authority, an Independent Ethics 
Committee or an Institutional Review Board may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, 
including source data verification.  
The purpose of a sponsor audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all 
study -related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and 
data were reco rded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical 
Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization, and any applicable 
regulatory requirements. The Investigator should contact the Sponsor immediately if co ntacted 
by a regulatory agency about an inspection.  
10.1.10.  Data Quality Assurance   
 All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on printed or electronic  
eCRF s unless trans mitted to the Sponsor  or designee electronically ( e.g., laboratory 
data). The Investigator  is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and 
correct by physically or electronically signing the  eCRF . 
 Guidance on completion of  eCRF s will be pro vided.  
 The Investigator  must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and 
regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source documents.  
 Monitoring details describing strategy, including definition of study critical data 
items  and processes ( e.g., risk -based initiatives in operations and quality such as risk 
management and mitigation strategies and analytical risk -based monitoring), 
methods, responsibilities, and requirements, including handling of noncompliance 
issues and moni toring techniques (central, remote, or on -site monitoring) are provided 
in the monitoring plan . 
 The Sponsor  or designee is responsible for the data management of this study, 
including quality checking of the data.  
 The Sponsor  assumes accountability for actions delegated to other individuals ( e.g., 
contract research organizations).  
 Records and documents, includi ng signed ICFs, pertaining to the conduct of this 
study must be retained by the Investigator  for 20 years after study completion unless 
local regulations or institutional policies require a longer retention period. No records 
may be destroyed during the re tention period without the written approval of the

10.1.11.  Data Handling and Recordkeeping   
Source Document s 
Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and substantiate the 
integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the Investigator ’s site.  
Data reported on the  eCRF  or entered in  the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents 
must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The 
Investigator  may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the 
study. Also, curre nt medical records must be available.  
Definition of what constitutes source data,  and its origin can be found in monitoring guidelines . 
The Investigator  must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the 
information entered in to the eCRF . 
The Sponsor  or designee will perform monitoring to confirm that data entered into the  eCRF  by 
authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents; that the 
safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that the study is being conducted in 
accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and 
all applicable regulatory requirements.  
The Investigator /study personnel will allow the Sponsor  (or designee) and appropriate regul atory 
authorities access to these records . 
Data Collection and Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) Completion  
The Investigator , or designee, will enter data from the clinic’s medical records and study source 
worksheets into an online electronic data capture  (EDC) system. All study personnel will be 
trained and receive a password protected login. Sponsor designated monitors will perform 
clinical monitoring, including verification of eCRFs and the source documentation.  
Data entry should occur in a timely manne r for accuracy, but especially for complying with 
regulations if an unanticipated or serious adverse event occurs (within 24 hours). If delays in 
entry occur frequently, a formal corrective plan will be established.  
Inspection of Records  
Spon sor/designee  will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigation facilities for the 
purpose of monitoring any aspect of the study. The Investigator  agrees to allow the monitor to 
inspect participant  charts and study source documents, and other records relative to study 
conduct.  
Retention of Records  
The Principal Investigator  must maintain all documentation relating to the study for a period of 
up to 20 years after the end of the study. If it becomes necessary for the Sponsor or the 
Regulatory Authority to review any documentation relating to the study, the Investigator  must 
permit access to such records.

10.1.12.   Study and Site Start and Closure   
Study Start  
The study start date is  defined as the date when the first participant signs the informed consent . 
Study/Site Termination  
The Sponsor  or designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any 
time for any reason at the sole discretion of the Sponsor . Study sites will be closed upon study 
completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies 
have been co llected and a study -site closure visit has been performed.  
The Investigator  may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.  
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the Sponsor  or Investigator  may include but are 
not limited to:  
For study termination:  
 Discontinuation of further study intervention development . 
For site termination:  
 Failure of the Investigator  to comply w ith the protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the Sponsor ’s procedures, or GCP guidelines . 
 Inadequate or no recruitment (evaluated after a reasonable amount of time) of 
participants by the Investigator . 
 Total number of part icipants included earlier than expected . 
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Sponsor  shall promptly inform the 
Investigator s, the IECs/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, and any CRO (s) used in the study of the 
reason for termination or suspension, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirements. The 
Investigator  shall promptly inform the participant and should ensure  appropriate participant 
therapy and/or follow -up. 
10.1.13.  Publicatio n Policy   
The results of this study are expected to be published or presented at scientific meetings  and in 
clinical study registries . 
The Sponsor  will comply with the requirement s for publication of study results. In accordance 
with standard editorial and ethical practice, the Sponsor  will generally support publication of 
multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data. In this case, a 
coordinating Inves tigator  will be designated by mutual agreement.  
Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with the International  Committee 
of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements.

10.3. APPENDIX 3: AEs and SAEs: Definitions and Procedures for 
Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting   
10.3.1.  Definition of AE   
AE Definition  
 An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally 
associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the 
study intervention.  
 NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of study intervention.  
Definition of Unsolicited and Solicited AE  
 An unsolicited AE is an AE that was no t solicited using a participant diary and that is 
communicated by a participant who has signed the informed consent. Unsolicited 
AEs include serious and nonserious AEs.  
 Potential unsolicited AEs may be medically attended ( i.e., symptoms or illnesses 
requir ing a hospitalization, emergency room visit, or visit to/by a healthcare 
provider). The participant will be instructed to contact the site as soon as possible to 
report medically attended event(s), as well as any events that, though not medically 
attended,  are of participant concern. Detailed information about reported unsolicited 
AEs will be collected by qualified site personnel and documented in the participant’s 
records.  
 Unsolicited AEs that are not medically attended nor perceived as a concern by the 
participant will be collected during an interview with the participant and by review of 
available medical records at the next visit.  
 Solicited AEs are predefined local (at the injection site ) and systemic events for 
which the participant is specifically ques tioned, and which are noted by the 
participant in their diary.  
Events Meeting the AE Definition  
 Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments ( e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the 
medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator  (i.e., not related to progression of 
underlying disease, or more se vere than expected for the participant’s condition)  
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition  
 New condition detected or diagnosed after study intervention ad ministration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction  
Approved on 09 Apr 2024 GMT
Protocol No. VER201 -PH2-031 
Version No. 5.0 
 
Confidential & Proprietary  
Page 101 of 112 
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or  a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming 
intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.  
Events not Meeting the AE Definiti on 
 Any abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments that are 
associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the Investigator  to be more 
severe than expected for the participant’s condition  
 The disease/disorder being studied o r expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s 
condition  
 Medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is t he AE  
 Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital)  
 Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
10.3.2.  Definition of SAE   
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, meets one or more of 
the criteria listed:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life threatening  
The term life threatening  in the definition of serious  refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more sever e. 
c. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
 In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been admitted (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for 
observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during 
hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any 
other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether 
hospitalization occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
 Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.  
d. Results in pe rsistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.

 This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as  uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma ( e.g., sprained ankle) that may interfere with or 
prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
f. Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via an authorized medicinal 
product  
g. Other situations:  
 Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised by the Investigator  in deciding 
whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as im portant 
medical events that that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death 
or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above 
defin ition. These events should usually be considered serious.  
 Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias, convulsions not resulting in hospitali zation, or development of 
intervention dependency or intervention abuse.  All malignancies must be reported 
as SAEs.  
10.3.3.  Recording and Follow -Up of AE and/or SAE   
AE and SAE Recording  
 When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator  to review all 
documentation ( e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics 
reports) related to the event.  
 The Investigator  will then record all relevant AE/SAE informa tion. 
 It is not acceptable for the Investigator  to send photocopies of the participant’s 
medical records in lieu of completion of the required form.  
 There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are 
requested by the Sponsor/design ee. In this case, all participant identifiers, except for  
the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before 
submission.  
 The Investigator  will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not 
the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
Assessment of Intensity  
The Investigator  will make an assessment of intensity based on the CTCAE grades [36] for each 
AE and SAE reported during the study .

Assessment of Causality  
 The Investigator  is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and 
each occurrence of each AE/SAE. The Investigator  will use clinical judgment to 
determine the relationship.  
 A reasonable possibility  of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evid ence, 
and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be 
ruled out.  
 Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to st udy intervention 
administration, will be considered and investigated.  
 For causality assessment, the Investigator  will also consult the IB and/or product 
information, for marketed products.  
 The Investigator  must review and provide an assessment of causality  for each 
AE/SAE and document this in the medical notes. There may be situations in which an 
SAE has occurred,  and the Investigator  has minimal information to include in the 
initial report. However, it is very important that the Investigator  always assess  
causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data.  
 The Investigator  may change their opinion of causality considering  follow -up 
information and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
 The causality assess ment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.  
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
 The Investigator  is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by the 
Sponsor to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. 
This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological 
examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.  
 If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up 
period, the Investigator  will provide Sponsor/designee with a copy of any postmortem 
findings including histopathology.  
 New or updated information will be recorded in t he originally submitted documents.  
 The Investigator  will submit any updated SAE data to Sponsor/designee  within 24 
hours of receipt of the information.  
10.3.4.  Reporting of SAEs   
SAE Reporting to Sponsor/designee via an Electronic Data Collection Tool  
 The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to Sponsor/designee  will be the 
electronic data collection to ol.

 If the electronic system is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data 
collection tool (see next section) to report the event within 24 hours.  
 The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes 
available.  
 After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be 
taken offline to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
 If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated 
data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been 
taken offline, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next 
section) or to the Sponsor/designee  by telephone.  
 Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in  the SOM . 
SAE Reporting to Sponsor/designee via Paper Data Collection Tool  
 Facsimile transmission of the SAE paper data collection tool is the preferred method 
to transmit this information to the  Sponsor/designee . 
 In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by 
telephone either verbally (less preferred) or by cell phone photo (more preferred)  is 
acceptable with a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight mail or 
courier service.  
 Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the Investigator  to 
complete and sign the SAE data collection tool within the designated reporting 
timeframes.  
 Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in SOM .

10.4. APPENDIX  4: Contracep tive Guidance   
In order to prevent pregnancy, female participants must satisfy one of the following  criteria : 
 Be post-menopausal, defined as having had ≥12 months of natural (spon taneous) 
amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical/hormonal profile  (e.g., FSH > 40 IU/L) 
 Have undergone surgical sterilization (surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or 
without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks before 
taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive 
status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.  
 All other female participants must meet both of the following criteria:  
 Two negative preg nancy tests (1 at screening and 1 at randomization)  
 Use of an intrauterine device, from at least 3 months prior to the baseline visit  
  through at least 4 months after the last dose of bimagrumab/placebo i.v.  
 Use of a n additional contraceptive ( barrier ) method from screening through at 
least 4 months after the last dose of bimagrumab/placebo i.v.  to further reduce  the 
risk of unintended pregnancy.

10.5. APPENDIX 5: Genetics   
10.5.1.  Optional Consent   
The study includes an optional DNA component which requires a separate informed consent 
signature if the participant  agrees to participate.  
Genetic variation may impact a participant’s response to study intervention, susceptibility to, and 
severity and pro gression of disease. Variable response to study intervention may be due to 
genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; 
mechanism of action of the drug; disease etiology; and/or molecular subtype of the disease  being 
treated. Therefore, where local regulations and IRB/IEC allow, a blood sample will be collected 
for DNA analysis from consenting participants.  
10.5.2.  Use/Analysis of DNA  
As techn ology changes over time, the most appropriate technology will be used at the time the 
exploratory DNA research is performed. This may include the study of the entire genome.  
In addition, recent advances in genotyping technologies have made genome -wide appr oaches 
possible. Genome -wide approaches may also be undertaken within the restricted scope described 
below.  
Exploratory DNA research studies are planned as a part of this study with the objectives of 
identifying genetic factors which may  
 be related to obes ity 
 predict response to treatment with bimagrumab  
 predict relative susceptibility to drug -drug interactions  
 predict genetic predisposition to side effects  
Additional analyses may be conducted if it is hypothesized that this may help further understand 
the clinical data.  
The samples may be analyzed as part of a multi -study assessment of genetic factors involved in 
the response to bimagrumab  or study interventions of this class to understand the study disease 
or related conditions.  
The results of genetic analyses may be reported in the clinical study report (CSR) or in a separate 
study summary.  
10.5.3.  Storage of Genetic Samples   
The Sponsor  will store the DNA samples in a secu re storage space with adequate measures to 
protect confidentiality.  
The samples will be retained while research on study interventions of this class or 
obesity/overweight  continues but no longer than  10 years or other period as per local 
requirements.

 Test for hemolysis (e.g. , reticulocytes , haptoglobin, 
unconjugated [indirect] bilirubin)  
 Hospitalize if clinically appropriate  
 Establish causality  
>10x ULN   Discontinue the study treatment immediately  
 Hospitalize the participant  
 Establish causality  
Any AE potentially indicative of a liver 
toxicity  Consider study treatment interruption or 
discontinuation  
 Hospitalization if clinically appropriate  
 Establish causality  
In all instances, record the AE and contributing factors (e.g. , concomitant medications, medical 
history, laboratory results ) in the appropriate  eCRF . 
Based on investigator’s discretion, investigation(s) for contributing factors for the liver event can 
include  serology tests, imaging, and pathology assessments, hepatologist’s consultancy,  
obtaining more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurren t diseases, history of 
concomitant drug use, exclusion of underlying liver disease.

10.7. APPENDIX 7 : Lipase and Amylase Safety   
To ensure participant  safety and enhance reliability i n determining the potential for pancreatic  
events with bimagrumab, a standardized process for identification, monitoring and evaluation  of 
pancreatic  events  should be followed  (Table  10). 
Table  10: Safety Monitoring Guidance  for Amylase  and Lipase Elevations  
Event  Follow  up monitoring  
Lipase  and/or  amylase  
>2x and ≤3x ULN   If asymptomatic,  re-check enzymes (amylase, lipase)  and additional follow  
up at discretion  of Investigator.  
 If clinical symptoms are present  (e.g., abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea) 
and suggest ive of  pancreatic involvement, re -check enzymes  (amylase, 
lipase) and inflammatory markers ( e.g., C-reactive  protein) and consider 
pancreatic imaging ( e.g., contrast -enhanced  CT or MRI /MRCP ) to evaluate 
for presence of  pancreatitis.  
 If serum lipase is >2x ULN and >1.5x baseline  at or prior to Visit 4 , 
interrupt stud y treatments and consult with medical monitor . 
Lipase  and/or  amylase  
>3x and ≤5X ULN   If at or prior to Visit 4, interrupt study treatments and consult with medical 
monitor . 
 Re-check enzymes  (amylase, lipase) and inflammatory markers (C -reactive 
protein) independent of presence of clinical symptoms , until enzyme  levels 
return to <2x ULN . 
 Assess participant for clinical symptoms  (e.g., abdominal pain, nausea, 
diarrhea) . 
 Conduct pancreatic imaging ( e.g., CECT or MRI /MRCP ) to evaluate for 
presence of pancreatitis . 
 If clinical symptoms and/or pancreatic imaging indicative of pancreatitis , 
discontinue  study treatments . 
>5x ULN or 
confirmed  diagnosis 
of pancreatitis  Discontinue study treatment s. 
 Hospitalize if clinically appropriate.  
 Establish causality . 
Medically  significant  pancreatic  events  which  are considered  as serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  
should  follow  the standard  procedures  for SAE  reporting  as described  in Section  8.4. 
Every pancreatic event reported as an SAE should include a causality assessment  of the event , 
considering  alternative  causes (e.g.,  gallstones,  co-medication).  
An investigation of the pancreas needs to be followed up until resolution. A gastroenterology  
consult can be included at the Investigator’s discr etion. All follow -up information, and the  
procedures  performed,  should  be recorded  in the appropriate  eCRF s. 
An independent adjudication  committee may be formed to adjudicate suspected cases of acute 
pancreatitis and other major adverse events in a blinded  manner.   Any completed adjudications 
will be utilized in safety analyses.

10.8. APPENDIX 8: Creatine Kinase  Safety   
To ensure participant  safety and enhance reliability in determining the potential for 
rhabdomyolysis , a standardized process for identification, monitoring and evaluation of serum 
CK should be followed ( Table  11). 
Table  11: Safety Monitoring Guidance for Creatine Kinase Elevations  
Event  Follow up monitoring  
Creatine kinase (CK) 
>5x ULN  and ≤10x 
ULN   Inquire about recent intensive muscular exertion or injury, infection, body 
temperature changes, medications such as statins  
 Assess participant  for clinical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, weakness, dark 
urine ). 
 Re-check  CK and check serum troponin  I/T, creatinine, sodium, potassium, 
calcium, phosphate, and urine myoglobin  
 If symptoms and/or lab tests indicative of rhabdomyolysis, discontinue 
study treatments.  
Creatine kinase (CK) 
>10x ULN  or 
rhabdomyolysis is 
confirmed   In addition to above actions:  
o Interrup t study drugs and consult with the medical monitor  
o Discontinue study  if rhabdomyolysis is confirmed  
o Hospitalize if clinically appropriate.  
o Establish causality

CONFIDENTIAL SYNOPSIS  
Study Title:  KPI-121-C-005:  A Phase 3, Double -Masked, Randomized, 
Controlled Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of KPI -121 
1.0% Ophthalmic Suspension in Subjects with Postsurgical 
Inflammation  and Pain  
Objectives:  The prima ry objective  of the study is to i nvestigate the efficacy and 
safety of KPI -121 1.0% ophthalmic suspension  compared to 
placebo in subjects who have undergone c ataract surgery.    
Study Population:  The study populatio n will consist of subjects who  have undergone 
routine uncomplicated cataract surgery and experience ocular 
inflammation postoperatively .    
Number of 
Subjects:  Approximately 720 subjects  who are can didat es for cataract surgery 
will be screened. One study eye from approximately 500 subjects 
will be randomized .  
Investigational 
Product s: KPI-121 1.0% ophthalmic suspension or  placebo  will be supplied as 
investigational product.  
Route and Duration 
of Administration : 1 to 2 drops of i nvestigational product wi ll be instilled in the study  
eye two times per day ( BID) for 14 ± 1  days.  
Study Design:   
 This is a Phase 3, multicenter, double -masked, randomized, 
placebo -controlled, parallel -group study designed to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of KPI-121 1.0% oph thalmic suspension  versus 
placeb o in subjects  who require treatment of postoperative anterior 
ocular inflammation. Approximately 720 subjects who are 
candidates for cataract surgery will be screened and approximately 
500 subjects who, after undergoing rout ine, uncomplicated cataract 
surgery, present at Visit 3 (Day 1) with  ≥ 2 anterior chamber cells in 
the study eye will be randomized in this study at approximately 35 
centers located in the United States (US). Subjects who experience 
postoperative inflammat ion on the first day following routine , 
uncomplicated, cataract surgery  and who meet all other eligibility 
criteria  will be randomized  to one of two study groups in an 
approximate 1:1 ratio to KPI -121 1.0% ophthalmic suspension 
dosed BID or placebo dosed  BID. Investigational product  or 
placebo will be  initiated on the day following surgery  and instilled 
as one to two drops  in the study eye BID for 14 ± 1 days.

CONFIDENTIAL This study will include up to 7 clinic visits (including the surgery 
day) over 18 to 33 days to tal study duration. Visit 1 ( Screening) will 
occur between 14 to 1 day(s) prior to surgery, and  subjects who 
meet preoperative screening inclusion/exclusion criteria will be 
entered into the study. At Visit 2  (Surgery/Day 0) subjects will 
undergo routine c ataract surgery according to the Investigator’s 
normal procedures.  Visit 3 (Randomization/Day 1) will occur on 
the day following surgery. Subjects who meet the qualifying 
postoperative randomization criteria will be eligible for 
randomization  to one of th e two study groups and will initiate 
investigational product  on that day . Following randomization, 
subjects will be instructed to return t o the clinic to be evaluated at 
Visit 4 (Day 4 ±  1 day), Visit 5 (Day 8 ±  1 day), and Visit 6 (Day 15 
± 1 day). The la st dose of investigational product  will be 
administered upon completion of 14 days of evaluation.  Following 
the End of Investigational P roduct  Use Visit (Visit 6; Day 15 ±  1 
day), subjects will be asked to return to the clinic on Day 18 ±  1 day 
for Visit 7 (Follow -Up) and will be released from the study.

CONFIDENTIAL 1. INTRODUC TION 
 
Intraocular inflammation is an anticipated sequela of intraocular surgery such as cataract 
removal and intraocular lens (IOL) placement. In general, trauma to the internal structures of 
the eye is accompanied by the production of prostaglandins and other vasoactive moieties, an 
increase in blood flow to the affected area, and extravasations of protein and cellular blood 
e
lements. Postoperative inflammation is manifested principally as bulbar erythema, corneal 
e
dema, ciliary flush and aqueous cells and flare.   
 
If left untreated, inflammation generally resolves within 2 to 4 weeks after surgery; however 
20% to 80% of patients present with anterior chamber cells and/or flare 2 weeks after cataract 
surge
ry and IOL placement. Since untreated intraocular inflammation following cataract 
surgery may lead to complications such as cystoid macular edema (CME) (Apple et al., 1992; 
Tennant, 1978 ) , treatment with anti-inflammatory agents such as glucocorticosteroids is 
employed to reduce pain and discomfort, and to facilitate recovery of the blood-aqueous 
barrier. When administered at the time of surgery and during the immediate postoperative 
period, glucocorticosteroids can reverse the clinical and non-clinical manifestations of 
inflammation  (Leopold, 1985) . In the United States ( US), topical glucocorticosteroids ar e 
routinely prescribed for at least 2 weeks following cataract surgery, with longer treatment 
prescribed in cases of severe or unremitting inflammation.   
 
Loteprednol etabonate (LE) is an ester corticosteroid that is rapidly metabolized to inactive 
metabolites, and has been reported to have fewer side effects than traditional 
glucocorticosteroids. Loteprednol etabonate was approved by Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) in 1998 under New Drug Application ( NDA )  20-583  (Lotemax®; Bausch & Lomb). 
Lotemax has gained wide acceptance by ophthalmologists for use in the treatment of 
postoperative ocular inflammation. Despite its attractive pharmacologic activity, wherein the 
drug is active at the site of administration but is rapidly metabolized to an inactive compound 
following absorption, Lotemax requires frequent dosing (four times per day) which may 
reduce patient compliance.  
 
Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has developed an improved formulation of loteprednol etabonate, 
de
signated as KPI-121, using a proprietary technology known as Mucus Penetrating Particles 
(MPP
). MPP technology utilizes submicron drug particles formulated to enhance penetration 
through the mucous layer of the tear film. KPI-121 is an aqueous suspension of submicron 
particles of loteprednol etabonate formulated with excipients present in other FDA-approved 
ophthalmic investigational products. Preclinical studies have shown improved

Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc. intends to develop KPI-121 for the treatment of postoperative 
infla
mmation and pain following ocular surgery.  
 
1.1. DESCRIPTION OF INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  
 
KPI-121 contains submicron particles of loteprednol etabonate suspended in a formulation 
consisting of excipients that have been used in other FDA-approved ophthalmic products.  
Ka
la is developing this improved loteprednol etabonate formulation for the treatment of 
post
operative anterior segment inflammation and pain. 
 
KPI-121 is a sterile, aqueous submicron suspension of loteprednol etabonate and will be filled 
in a white, low-density polyethylene plastic bottle with a translucent , controlled -drop 
polypropylene  tip,  a pink polypropylene cap  and a white polyethylene tamper -evident 
overcap. The bottle will be a 5 mL dropper bott le with a nominal fill of 3.2 mL . 
 
For this trial, KPI-121 investigational product will be supplied as 1.0% ophthalmic 
suspension.  Each mL  of KPI-121 1.0% ophthalmi c suspension  contains 10 mg loteprednol 
etabonate as the active ingredient.  Inactive i ngredients in KPI -121 investigational product  are 
 
   as 
preserva
tive.  KPI -121 1.0% ophthalmic suspension is essentially isotonic and is buffered to 
maintain a
 power of hydrogen (pH) of 5.0 – 7.0.  
 
The
 placebo control has the same excipient composition as K PI-121 1.0%  ophthalmi c 
suspension but do es not contain  loteprednol etabonate . The  placebo control contains 
 
   a
s 
preservative
. The placebo control is  essentially is otoni c and buffered to m aintain pH 5.0 – 7.0.  
I
t is a sterile, aqueous solution  supplied in the same white, low -de nsity polyethylene plastic 
bottle with the same translucent , controlled -drop polypropylene  tip, pink pol ypropylene cap  
and white poly ethyl
ene tamper -evident overcap  as KPI -121 1%  ophthalmic suspension

CONFIDENTIAL 1.2. JUSTIFICATION FOR RO UTE OF ADMINISTRATION AND DOSE SELECTION  
 
KPI-121 1.0% will be administered as a topical ophthalmic suspension.  
 
Subjects are expected to self-administer one to two drops of either KPI-121 1.0 % ophthalmi c 
suspension or placebo control BID. 
 
Dire
ct instillation is the most efficient method for delivery to the ocular surface and is an 
accepted and widely used method for topical application to the eye. This study will examine 
effect and tolerability for 14 days of KPI-121 1.0% ophthalmic suspension dosed BID.

3.4. DESCRIPTION OF TRIAL DESIGN  
 
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group 
stud
y designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of KPI-121 1.0% ophthalmic suspension 
vers us placebo in subjects who require treatment of postoperative anterior ocular 
inflammation. Approximately 720 subjects who are candidates for cataract surgery will be 
sc
reened and approximately 500 subjects who, after undergoing routine, uncomplicated 
c
ataract surgery,  present at Visit 3 (Day 1) with ≥ 2 anterior chamber cells in the study eye 
will be randomized in this study at approximately 35 centers located in the US.   
 
Subjects who experience postoperative inflammation on the first day following routine, 
uncomplicated, cataract surgery and who meet all other eligibility criteria will be randomized 
to one of
 two study groups in an approximate 1:1 ratio:  
 
 KP I-121 1.0% ophthalmic suspension, BID   
 P lacebo, BID  
 
Dosing of investigational product will be initiated on the day following surgery, instilled as 1-
2 drops in the study eye BID for 14 ± 1 days. The first dose of investigational product will be 
a
dministered by the subject under the supervision of a designated study team member who is 
otherwise uninvolved in the assessment or evaluation of the subject.  Except for this 
investi
gational product administration, no other information or discussion regarding the 
subject’s assigned investigational product will be exchanged, in order to maintain the masking 
for
 this trial. 
 
This study will include up to 7 clinic visits (including the surgery day) over 18 to 33 days 
total study duration. Visit 1 (Screening) will occur between 14 to 1 day(s) prior to surgery and 
subjects who meet preoperative screening inclusion/exclusion criteria will be entered into the 
study. At Visit 2 (Surgery/Day 0), subjects will undergo routine cataract surgery according to 
the 
Investigator’s normal procedures. Visit 3 (Randomization/Day 1) will occur on the day 
following surgery. Subjects who meet the qualifying postoperative randomization criteria will 
be eligible for randomization to one of the two study groups and will initiate dosing with 
investi
gational product on that day. Following randomization, subjects will be instructed to 
instill investigational product in the study eye two times a day (BID) for 14 ± 1 days, up until

5.2. SUBJECT WITHDRAWAL AND/ OR DISCONTINUATION  
 
Any subject who wishes to discontinue investigational product use or withdraw from 
pa
rticipation in the study for any reason is entitled to do so without obligation.  The 
Investigator may also discontinue any subject from investigational product use or from study 
participation, if deemed necessary.  
 
Investigational product use may be discontinued and any subject may be discontinued from 
study participation at any time during the study at the discretion of the Investigator or the 
sponsor for any reason including but not limited to: 
 
1. Oc currence of any medical condition or circumstance that exposes the subject 
to substantial risk and/or does not allow the subject to adhere to the 
requirements of the protocol. 
2. An y SAE, clinically significant AE, severe laboratory abnormality, intercurrent 
illness, or other medical condition that indicates to the Investigator that 
continued participation is not in the best interest of the subject. 
3. S ubject's decision to withdraw. 
4. Any woman who becomes pregnant while participating in the study.  
Information on the pregnancy and outcome will be requested.    
5. S ubject’s failure to comply with protocol requirements or study related 
procedures. 
6. Te rmination of the study by the Sponsor, FDA, or other regulatory authorities. 
 
In the event study discontinuation of a randomized subject is necessary, the Investigator 
should make every attempt to have the subject complete Visit 6 assessments as possible.  If a 
non-serious AE is unresolved at the time of the subject’s final study visit, an effort will be 
made to follow up until the AE is resolved or stabilized, the subject is lost to follow-up, or 
there is some other resolution of the event.  The Investigator should make every attempt to 
follow all serious adverse events (SAEs) to resolution.  The reason for premature 
discontinuation should be entered onto the Case Report Form (CRF) and recorded in the 
subject chart. 
 
Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be replaced. 
 
KPI- 121-C-005 CLINICAL PROTOCOL INCORPORATING AMENDMENT 05 FINAL  P AGE 37 OF 65 
24 FEB  2017 
CONFIDENTIAL Additionally, the trial or parts of the trial may be discontinued by the sponsor or at the 
recommendation of the Investigator after consultation with Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  This 
may be based on a significant number of AEs of a similar nature that warrant such action.    
 
5.3. COLLECTION OF DATA 
 
Source documentation for data collected in this study will be maintained at the investigative 
site.  In cases where no source will be used (e.g., subject diary), it will be noted in the 
Investigator files. The CRF will be electronic (eCRF) and data will be electronically entered 
from the source documentation in to the eCRF. After study completion, an archival copy [e.g., 
porta
ble document format (PDF)] of the eCRF data will be retained by the site. 
 
5.3.1. Unscheduled Visit 
 
Any visits or procedures performed beyond those specified within the protocol must be 
documented in the Unscheduled Visit pages of the eCRF. Unscheduled visits may include but 
are not limited to reporting adverse events (AEs), changes in concomitant medications, or 
ophthalmic assessments as deemed appropriate by an appropriately qualified physician.  If the 
subject is discontinuing study participation at the unscheduled visit, the eCRFs for Visit 6 
should be completed rather than the eCRFs for an Unscheduled Visit. 
 
5.4. RESCUE MEDICATION USE 
 
Any subjects not responding adequately to the study medication may be rescued and placed 
on alternate therapy at the Investigator's discretion at any time. The choice of rescue 
medication is at the Investigator's discretion. Any subject placed on rescue therapy will 
discontinue use of the study medication and continue study participation through Visit 7.  
 
Rescued subjects will be considered treatment failures, but the need for rescue therapy will 
not be considered an AE. Rescued subjects experiencing an AE at the time of rescue will be 
followed through stabilization or resolution of the AE or the end of the study (whichever 
comes last).  Rescued subjects should not be withdrawn from the study, but rather followed to 
resolution of signs and symptoms or until the Investigator has deemed the subject is stable.

CONFIDENTIAL 6. T REATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
6.1. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCTS TO BE ADMINISTERED  
 
KPI-121 1.0% ophthalmic suspension or placebo solution will be supplied as study product.  
One
 kit of randomized study product containing two dropper bottles will be allocated to each 
subject at Visit 3. Only one bottle will be dispensed to the subject at Visit 3. The second bottle 
will be retained at the site and provided to the subject if needed during the treatment period. 
The study product will be stored at the site in a secure area with limited access at 15-25C/59-
77F with upper limit excursions to 30 C /86F allowed. 
 
S
ubjects will be asked to administer study product twice each day. Prior to each instillation of 
stud
y product, subject will be instructed to shake the study product bottle. The subjects will 
record daily the time of administration of each dose of study product in the Dosing Diary 
(A
ppendix 7) .  
 
Compliance with instillation of study product will be reviewed and assessed at each clinic 
visit. 
 
6.2. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
 
With the exception of pre- and post-operative standard of care medications, a ll medication 
that the subject has taken 30 days prior to Visit 1 and through Visit 7  or discontinuation from 
the study will be recorded in the eCRF and the subject chart. The generic name of the drug, 
dose, route of administration, duration of treatment (including start and stop dates), frequency, 
indication, and whether or not the medication was taken due to an AE will be recorded for 
e
ach medication. 
 
6.2.1. Permitted Medications 
 
Medications not specifically excluded in Section 6.2.2  may be taken as necessary.  
Concomitant treatment with antibiotics at the discretion of the Investigator is allowed (with 
the exception of besifloxacin).  Medications routinely administered and not explicitly 
prohibit
ed in this protocol used as part of an uncomplicated cataract surgery procedure are 
allowed. These medications will be collected in the source documentation and are not 
c
aptured within the eCRF unless there is a change to the standard of care as documented in 
the source document.  Further, the routine medications administered as part of routine cataract 
surge
ry are not expected to be associated with treatment for AEs unless otherwise indicated.  
Note:  Any medication administered as part of the routine surgery that is ongoing subsequent 
to t
he surgical procedure, should be captured in the eCRF as a concomitant medication.

NOTE:  Dose must remain stable throughout the course of the study 
 
I
f using nutraceuticals or multivitamins, subjects may not alter their stable dose throughout 
the study. 
 
6.3. STUDY PRODUCT USE COMPLIANCE  
 
Compliance will be assessed by comparing study product accountability records with the 
dosing information recorded daily by the subject. The site will document this comparison 
along with verification of the numbers of used and unused study product bottles. The numbers 
of missed doses as assessed at each clinic visit should be documented in the eCRF. 
 
6.4. DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY  
 
Sponsor study monitors or designees will conduct accountability of study product (KPI-121 or 
plac
ebo). Accountability will be ascertained by performing reconciliation between the amount 
of drug sent to the site and the amount unused at the time of reconciliation. 
 
Clinical trial materials will be shipped to the investigational sites under sealed conditions.  
Study product shipment records will be verified by comparing the shipment inventory sheet to 
the a
ctual quantity of drug received at the site. Accurate records of receipt and disposition of 
the study product (e.g., dates, quantity, subject number, dose dispensed, returned) must be 
maintaine
d by the Investigator or his/her designee. Study product will be stored in a secure 
area with limited access at 15-25C/59-77F with upper limit excursions to 30 C  /86F 
allowed.  
 
At the end of the study, all study materials, including any unused study product (KPI-121 
stud
y product or placebo), as well as original containers (even if empty), will be returned to 
the drug packaging vendor in accordance with sponsor or designee’s standard operations 
proc
edures (SOPs), following approval by the Sponsor. All returns of study product will be 
doc
umented.  The study monitor or designee will verify drug accountability. All drug 
ac
counting procedures must be completed before the study is considered complete. 
 
6.5. MAINTENANCE OF RANDOMIZATION AND PROCEDURE FOR BREAKING THE CODE 
 
The sponsor, the project teams at the designated Contract Research Organizations (CROs ), 
a
nd investigative staff responsible for assessments of study endpoints will be masked to study 
product assignments. In case of medical emergency, or occurrence of an SAE, the 
KPI- 121-C-005 CLINICAL PROTOCOL INCORPORATING AMENDMENT 05 FINAL  P AGE 41 OF 65 
24 FEB  2017 
CONFIDENTIAL randomization code may be unmasked and made available to the Investigator, sponsor, and/or 
other personnel involved in the monitoring or conduct of this study. In the absence of medical 
need, the randomization code will not be available to the above individuals until after the 
study is completed and the database is locked.   
 
In the event of a medical need, the Investigator will treat each subject as needed. Since there 
is no 
specific antidote to KPI-121, immediate emergency unmasking is not necessary. If the 
I
nvestigator feels it is necessary to unmask a subject’s assignment after an emergency 
sit
uation, the Investigator may call the medical monitor and notify the sponsor. The study 
produ
ct assignment will be revealed on a subject- by- subject basis with the approval of the 
medic
al monitor and sponsor, thus leaving the masking of the remaining subjects intact. 
 
A r
andomization code will be computer-generated by Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or its 
de
signee.  
 
Randomization team members will work independently of other team members at the CRO. 
Study personnel, study subjects, the sponsor, and project teams at the CROs involved in the 
study will be masked to study product assignments.

 ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS  
 
Adverse Event (AE):   A ny untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
investigational product in humans, whether or not considered drug related.   
 
Adverse Reaction (AR) : any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspec
ted adverse reactions where there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event.  
 
Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR) :  
Any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. F or the 
purposes of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest 
a
 causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A SAR implies a lesser degree of certainty 
about ca
usality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
 
Unexpec
ted:  An AE or SAR is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
I
nvestigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, 
if an Investigator’s  Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current 
application.   
 
L
ife-threatening:  An AE or SAR is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. 
It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe 
for
m, might have caused death.  
 
  
KPI- 121-C-005 CLINICAL PROTOCOL INCORPORATING AMENDMENT 05 FINAL  P AGE 44 OF 65

CONFIDENTIAL A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE) is any AE or suspected adverse reaction occurring 
at any dose that:  
 
 R esults in death. 
 I s life-threatening. 
 R esults in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions. 
 R equires inpatient hospitalization. 
 P rolongs inpatient hospitalization. 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 I s a significant medical event (i.e.,  one that may jeopardize the subject or may 
require intervention to prevent one or more of the other outcomes listed 
above). 
 
A NON
-SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT is any AE that does not meet the definitions for 
S
AEs as described above.  
 
Each AE  will be classified as  SERIOUS or NON-SERIOUS using  the definitions provided 
above. 
 
The SEVERITY of e ach AE will be classified as  MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE.   
The Investigator  will review each event an d assess its RELATIONSHIP  to use  of 
investigational product  (unrelated, unlikely, possibly, probably, definitely). The AE will be 
a
ssessed using the following definitions : 
 
Unrelated:  
 Event occurring before dosing.  
 Event or intercurrent illness due wholly to factors other than investigational 
produ
ct use.  
 
Unl
ikely:  
 Poor temporal relationship with investigational product use.  
 Eve
nt easily explained by subject’s clinical state or other factors.  
 
Possible: 
 Reasonable temporal relationship with investigational product use. 
 Eve
nt could be explained by subject’s clinical state or other factors.  
 
Probable: 
 Reasonable temporal relationship with investigational product use.

 Know
n reaction to agent or chemical group, or predicted by known pharmacology. 
 Event cannot be explained by subject’s clinical state or other factors.  
 
8.3. PROCEDURES FOR AE REPORTING BY THE INVESTIGATOR  
 
AEs will be monitored throughout the study and will be recorded on the CRF with the date 
and time of onset, date and time of resolution, severity, seriousness, causality (relationship to 
use of investigational product), treatment required, and the outcome.   
To elicit AEs, simple questions with minimal suggestions or implications should be used as 
the init
ial questions at all evaluation points during the trial.  For example: 
 
 How  have you felt since your last assessment? 
 Ha ve you had any health problems since your last assessment? 
 
The severity of each AE should be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. 
 
The causality of use of investigational product in relation to the AE will be assessed by the 
P
rincipal Investigator after careful medical consideration and categorized as unrelated, 
unli
kely, possible, probable, or definite. 
 
If an AE occurs, the Investigator will institute support and/or treat as deemed appropriate.   
I
f a non-SAE is unresolved at the time of the last day of the study, an effort will be made to 
follow up unti
l the AE is resolved or stabilized, the subject is lost to follow-up, or there is 
some other resolution of the event.  The Investigator should make every attempt to follow 
S
AEs to resolution.

 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING BY THE INVESTIGATOR  
 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
It is the responsibility of the Investigators or their designees to report any event of this nature 
to the sponsor or a designee within 24 hours of the event being brought to the Investigators’ or 
their
 staffs’ attention.  It is also the responsibility of the Investigator to report all SAEs 
re
ported at their site to their Institutional Review Board (IRB), as required.  The Investigator 
shoul
d make every attempt to follow all SAEs to resolution.

 Analysis of Safety 
 
Analysis of safety data will be presented for all subjects in the Safety population (i.e., all 
subjects receiving randomized study product). AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, most current version) and categorized by system organ 
class using preferred terms. AEs will be tabulated by study group with respect to their 
int
ensity and relationship to the study product. Ophthalmoscopy findings will be summarized 
de
scriptively.  IOP measurements, Snellen Distance VA by pinhole method and Slit Lamp 
B
iomicroscopy will be summarized as safety outcomes.

 SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION  
 
A two group 2 test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level will have 99% power to detect 
the dif
ference between a proportion with complete resolution of anterior chamber cells in the 
active group of 0.31 and the placebo group proportion of 0.15 when the sample size in each 
group is 250.  The power is the same for the complete resolution of pain endpoint.

CONFIDENTIAL 9.3. LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE  
 
The primary assessment will be evaluated using a 5% level of significance using the 
hier
archical testing described in Section 9.1.2 Analysis of Efficacy .   
 
All other reported p-values will be considered descriptive and hypothesis generating. 
 
9.4. PROCEDURE FOR ACCOUNTING FOR MISSING , UNUSE D, OR SPURIOUS DATA 
 
If more than 5% of data points are missing at the primary analysis time point (Day 8) in any 
treatment group, a tipping point analysis will be employed to assess the sensitivity of the 
results to the distribution of the allocation of treatment success and failure to the missing data 
points. 
 
9.5. PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING DEVIATIONS FROM THE STATISTICAL PLAN 
 
Any deviations from the statistical analysis plan will be described and a justification given in 
the final clinical study report. 
 
9.6.
 SUBJECTS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS  
 
Efficacy analysis will be performed for all randomized subjects, the Intent- to- Treat (ITT) 
population. A subset of the efficacy analysis will be repeated using data from those subjects 
who were randomized, complet ed 14-days of study product use, had complete data at Visit 5 
(D
ay 8 ± 1 day) and did not have significant protocol deviations, the Efficacy Evaluable ( EE) 
population. Rescued subjects will be included in the EE population if they did not have 
significant protocol deviations. AEs and other safety parameters will be analyzed for all 
ra
ndomized subjects receiving randomized study product (Safety population).

 APPENDIX 2:  SUBJECT -RATED OCULAR PAIN ASSESSMENT  
 
In the clinic, subjects will be handed a laminated card on which is printed the Subject-Rated 
Ocular Pain Assessment.  Each subject will be asked to subjectively rate their pain at Visit 3 
to 7 based on this scale.  This information will be provided to study personnel to enter into the 
subj
ect’s source documentation. The grading scale for pain to be used will be as follows: 
 
0 =
 None:      Absence of positive sensation. 
 
1 = Minimal:     Presence of mild sensation or discomfort typical of postoperative 
      surgery (e.g., diffuse or focal foreign body sensation, mild transient 
      burning or  stinging, etc.) 
 
2 = Mild:      Mild, tolerable aching of the eye. 
 
3 = Moderate:     Moderate or more prolonged aching sufficient to require the use of  
      over the counter (OTC) analgesics (e.g. acetaminophen). 
 
4 = Moderately Severe:  More prolonged aching requiring the use of an OTC analgesic  
       other than acetaminophen. 
 
5 = Severe:     Intense ocular, periocular or radiating pain (e.g. constant or nearly  
      constant sharp stabbing pain, throbbing or aching, etc.) requiring  
 
     prescription analgesics.

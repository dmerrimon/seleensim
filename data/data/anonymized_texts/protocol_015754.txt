 Investigational Plan         Page 12       v2.0_15-Jun-2017 OviTex®   STUDY OVERVIEW A baseline visit will be performed prior to the ventral hernia repair and will include assessment of the subject’s medical history, physical exam and pre-operative instructions. The subjects will also complete baseline Quality of Life (QOL) Surveys, one of which will be a disease specific assessment (HerQLes) and the other a standard measure of health outcomes (EQ-5D)  	On the day of surgery, repair of the ventral hernia will occur using OviTex® Permanent 1S reinforced bioscaffold to reinforce the repaired hernia site. Perioperative data will be collected, including the anatomical placement of the mesh and fixation methods.  During the course of hospitalization the patient will be assessed for incidence of early post-operative surgical site wound events and complications including the nature and severity of the complications, all necessary medical interventions and/or re-operations. 	On the day of hospital discharge, surgical site occurrences or wound related events (e.g. infections, hematomas, seromas, wound dehiscence) noted at the hernia repair site and the occurrence of other early post-operative complications (e.g. ileus, bowel obstruction, fistulae) will be assessed. 	At post-operative days 30 and 90, surgical site occurrences or wound related events (e.g. infections, hematomas, seromas, wound dehiscence) noted at the hernia repair site will be assessed. If a clinically significant hernia is suspected e.g. bulging noted at the hernia site, it will be confirmed via diagnostic imaging with a CT scan. The occurrence of other post-operative complications (e.g. ileus, bowel obstruction, fistulae) will be also assessed. Disease specific and general Quality of Life (QoL) surveys (HerQLes and EQ-5D), a pain scale and a subject/surgeon satisfaction assessment will also be administered. 	
TELA Bio, Inc   OviTex®  
 Investigational Plan         Page 13       v2.0_15-Jun-2017 OviTex®  At post-operative months 12 and 24, late surgical site occurrences or wound related events (e.g. infections, hematomas, seromas, wound dehiscence, bulging) noted at the hernia repair site will be assessed. If a clinically significant hernia is suspected e.g. bulging noted at the hernia site, it will be confirmed via diagnostic imaging with a CT scan. The occurrence of other late post-operative complications (e.g. ileus, bowel obstruction, fistulae) will also be assessed. Disease specific and general Quality of Life (QoL) surveys (HerQLes and EQ-5D), a pain scale and a subject/surgeon satisfaction assessment will also be administered. 	Concomitant treatments, surgeries and Adverse Events (AEs) will be collected throughout the study period. Subject safety will be monitored throughout the study period; from the Day of Surgery through the Month 24 visit. All AEs, UADEs and SAEs that occur from the day of surgery through the Month 24 visit will be reported in the CRF. In addition to notation in the CRF, all SAEs will also require completion of a separate reporting form for submission to the Sponsor through Day 90. Following the Day 90 visit, only SAEs considered by the investigator to be “Related or “Possibly Related” to the study product will require completion of the additional reporting form for submission to the Sponsor. Conversely, following the Day 90 visit, it will no longer be necessary to complete the separate reporting form for those SAEs that the investigator determines to be “Unrelated” to the OviTex mesh.

 Investigational Plan         Page 14       v2.0_15-Jun-2017 OviTex®   1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 BACKGROUND Meshes are indicated to reinforce absent or weakened soft tissue. Their main clinical application is found in hernias and abdominal wall defects. [1-3] In these diagnoses, the fascia underlying the abdominal muscles (rectus abdominus, transverse, internal and external obliques) exhibits a defect. The fascia is a layer of dense organized connective tissue that resists tension forces. It is comprised of closely packed bundles of organized collagen fibers, produced by the resident fibroblasts. [4, 5]  A defect in the fascia allows abdominal contents, e.g. the viscera, to migrate or ‘herniate’ to a position outside the abdominal cavity, under the skin. Ventral hernias are common and are often the result of previous abdominal surgeries where the sutured fascia ultimately fails (incisional hernia). [6, 7] The term ‘abdominal wall defect’ is reserved for situations where a substantial section of the fascia is missing, and surgical repair is challenging. This can be caused by failed previous surgeries, infections, trauma and other causes. Many subjects with ventral hernias or abdominal wall defects suffer from co-morbid conditions that can have a negative impact on healing, such as obesity, diabetes, COPD, steroid use, or the presence of a stoma, [8] which may add to the complexity of the surgical repair and recovery.  Reported recurrence rates after ventral hernia repair range from 2.7% to 62%.  [2] [9-13]  The goal for surgical repair of these ventral hernias is to obtain a tension-free primary closure of the defect in [1-3] the fascia, although this is not always possible. Techniques used to create more ‘real estate’ to achieve this goal, such as component separation, result in an increased surface area, but an overall thinner, and thus potentially weaker, abdominal wall. [1, 14] To reinforce the abdominal wall, many hernia surgeries include the use of a mesh. In cases where primary closure has been achieved, the mesh is used to reinforce the fascia and is placed either on top or below the newly constructed abdominal wall. e.g. ‘onlay’ or ‘underlay’.[15] In cases 
TELA Bio, Inc   OviTex®  
 Investigational Plan         Page 15       v2.0_15-Jun-2017 OviTex®  where primary closure cannot be achieved meshes are used to bridge the remaining defect, e.g. ‘inlay’.[16]  There exist two main classes of meshes, synthetics made of materials such as polyester, polypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE); and biologic ones that consist of decellularized extracellular matrix from different organs and species. Within these classes many different implants exist. [17, 18] Some synthetic meshes include a resorbable coating on one or both sides to prevent or reduce the incidence and severity of adhesions. The advantages of synthetic meshes are that they are strong, provide a permanent repair without developing laxity, can be designed in different shapes and are relatively low cost. [19] Disadvantages of synthetics include that they may need to be removed in the presence of infection, are prone to adhesions, promote scar formation instead of de novo fascia, become brittle over time, shrink, and can cause ‘meshomas’ or migrate and erode through organs. [20-22]  Biological meshes are made from connective tissue known as ‘extracellular matrix’. These meshes are made from dermis, small intestine, bladder, pericardium and other organs rich in connective tissue. In the manufacturing process the extracellular matrix is separated from associated layers and decellularized via mechanical and chemical processes. The structure of the matrix is preserved as much as possible. The composition of the extracellular matrix is virtually identical among all mammals. Its main constituent is fibrillar type I and III collagen; it also contains adhesion molecules such as proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and other glycoproteins. These molecules play numerous structural and functional roles, including binding and presenting growth factors to cell surface receptors, interacting directly with cells via specific receptors including integrins, and forming complex extracellular structures. Many of these functions are crucial to remodeling the implanted matrix into functional native tissue. [23]  The collagenous matrix however is sensitive to damage caused by manufacturing processes, including terminal sterilization.  The damage inflicted can take the form of fragmentation, cross-linking, or denaturation. The resulting matrix may no longer be completely natural and may be 
TELA Bio, Inc   OviTex®  
 Investigational Plan         Page 16       v2.0_15-Jun-2017 OviTex®  perceived as a foreign body by the host, and cause inflammation or become encapsulated. Each manufacturer uses different source materials and proprietary protocols to decellularize and sterilize their product, leading to marked differences in their mechanical and biological performance. [24, 25]  The advantages of effective biologic meshes include that they recreate a natural fascia, allow the surgeon to treat local infections while leaving the implant in-situ, cause minimal or no adhesions to the viscera and other tissues, do not shrink and do not lead to long-term complications such as ‘meshomas’ or erosion of organs.  None of the biological meshes on the market today meet all the criteria of an ideal implant. [26] The degree to which they fall short of the mark varies; disadvantages that are mentioned frequently are the development of laxity (‘bulging’) over time, true recurrences and the costs of the implants. [27, 28]  1.2 RATIONALE FOR VENTRAL HERNIA STUDY  In today’s surgical practice, synthetic meshes are typically indicated for patients with low to moderate risk of post-operative complications, with expectations that the mesh will become integrated into a fascia like layer.  Biologic meshes, on the other hand, tend to be reserved for use in patients with a high risk of post-operative complications, with the expectation that the product will remodel into de-novo native fascia. [8] In reality, neither product fully succeeds in achieving either of these goals. Poor outcomes associated with use of both types of product have prompted the development of a unique new product category of Reinforced BioScaffolds (RBS). It is hypothesized that RBS have all the characteristics and benefits of a biologic, e.g. avoiding complications of fibrosis, bowel erosion and infection, while retaining the strength of a synthetic material and providing adequate reinforcement to a poor/damaged fascia and as such are not prone to bulging and form an improved alternative in the repair of ventral hernias.

 Investigational Plan         Page 17       v2.0_15-Jun-2017 OviTex®  OviTex® Permanent 1S reinforced bioscaffold consists of an extracellular matrix with a light internal polymer skeleton. The biologic component of OviTex® Permanent 1S reinforced bioscaffold is derived from ovine rumen and available in several thicknesses (strengths) and reinforced using a monofilament polypropylene thread. The processing has been optimized to ensure preservation of the natural characteristics of the matrix, after which the material is freeze dried. Layers are subsequently sewn together and sterilized. The sewing pattern yields a 6 x 6 mm square open pattern. OviTex Permanent 1S includes one outer layer with a reduced 25 x 25 mm pattern on one side to reduce the risk of adhesions when placed in contact with the viscera.  It is hypothesized that the use of OviTex® Permanent 1S reinforced bioscaffold in abdominal hernia repair (in comparable subjects) will result in less seroma formation, the same percentage or fewer infections and fewer surgical repair related secondary procedures such as fluid aspirations or wound debridement. In addition, the use of OviTex® Permanent 1S reinforced bioscaffold is expected to result in a similar or lower rate of true recurrent herniations as reported for comparable prospectively studied subjects in the literature treated with other implants. [30-33] Surgical procedure related outcomes tend to occur within the first three months after surgery, and the recurrence of a hernia may occur at any point in time after treatment. This study focuses on the surgical outcomes over the first 3 months and continues for a total of 24 months to capture the longer-term incidence of hernia recurrences.   1.3 PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE (PRE-CLINICAL AND CLINICAL) OviTex® Permanent 1S reinforced bioscaffold has been (and is being) evaluated in several animal models. A rat study comparing a previous version of the OviTex reinforced bioscaffold to Surgisis, a porcine small intestine derived biologic, has been completed.   A non-human primate study was performed and the results were compared to other mesh products used in ventral hernia repair, both synthetics and biologics studied in the same model. The results of the primate studies show OviTex® Permanent 1S reinforced bioscaffold to perform equivalent or superior to the most widely biologic and synthetic meshes used in this field with regards to inflammation,

A study in rabbits evaluating the formation of adhesions was recently completed, initial results show that Ovitex Permanent 1S implants are less prone to adhesion formation than the positive control (Prolene).   A previous embodiment of the Reinforced BioScaffold also constructed from layers of ovine rumen and monofilament polypropylene has been implanted in 19 patients. Seventeen were treated for inguinal hernia and two for ventral hernia.  To date, no adverse events or recurrences have been reported in these patients.  1.4 DEVICE DESCRIPTION AND INTENDED USE OviTex® Permanent 1S reinforced bioscaffold is a six-layer construct of ovine derived extracellular matrix (ECM) and are assembled by stitching together multiple sheets of ECM with monofilament polypropylene. An example of an OviTex device is shown in Figure 1 below. The device is individually packaged and supplied sterile in various sizes up to 400 cm2. The device is supplied freeze dried and sterile in a “ready to use” in a peel pouch, and requires up to 5 minutes of rehydration time prior to implantation.

Subjects will provide written consent, using the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved informed consent form, before any study procedures are performed.  After informed consent is obtained screening on all potential subjects will consist of the following: • Assessment of subject’s study eligibility according to study inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subjects who meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be assigned a sequential subject number.  • A relevant physical examination including review of systems and collection of height, weight, BMI, blood pressure, temperature, as well as an abdominal examination to evaluate the ventral hernia and to estimate the defect size, (length, width, area cm2 ). • A review of relevant medical history, including previous abdominal surgeries and any co-morbidities. A review of subject demographics including age, gender, race and ethnicity. • Assessment of disease specific and general Quality of Life (QoL) surveys (HerQLes and EQ-5D), (See Appendix 1). • A clinical evaluation to determine surgical approach (open, laparoscopic or robotic), a brief review of the surgical procedure and device to be used, in addition to pre- operative instructions.  3.1.1 Surgical Date Sites will notify TELA Bio of scheduled surgeries within 5 days of the actual surgery date to ensure that study product is on-site for the day of surgery.

Assessment of disease specific and general Quality of Life (QoL) surveys e.g. EQ-5D and HerQLes, (See Appendix 1). • Subject and Surgeon satisfaction assessment of hernia repair (See Appendix 4). • Subject assessment of post-operative pain as measured by the Pain Visual Analog Scale ((VAS) See Appendix 5).  4 CONCOMITANT PROCEDURES/TREATMENTS AND ADVERSE EVENTS All treatments, surgeries, procedures and Adverse Events will be recorded for the duration of the study. All AEs, UADEs and SAEs that occur from the day of surgery through the Month 24 visit will be reported in the CRF. In addition to notation in the CRF, all SAEs will also require completion of a separate reporting form for submission to the Sponsor through Day 90. Any Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) or Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADEs) will be reported to TELA Bio (or their designee) within 24 hours of the investigator’s first awareness of their occurrence. Following the Day 90 visit, only SAEs considered by the investigator to be “Related or “Possibly Related” to the study product will require completion of the additional reporting form for submission to the Sponsor. Conversely, following the Day 90 visit, it will no longer be necessary to complete the separate reporting form for those SAEs that the investigator determines to be “Unrelated” to the OviTex mesh.     5 PATIENT WITHDRAWAL AND LOST TO FOLLOW-UP Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. Subjects who wish to withdraw from the study should be instructed to notify the investigator in writing. The Investigator, acting in the best interests of the patient, also has the right to withdraw subjects from the study.  
TELA Bio, Inc   OviTex®  
 Investigational Plan         Page 28       v2.0_15-Jun-2017 OviTex®  If the reason for removal of a subject from the study is an adverse event, the event will be recorded on the Adverse Event Case Report Form. In the case of any Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Unanticipated Device Effect (UADE) the Investigator is also required to report the event using the required reporting forms. All efforts will be made to follow-up the patient until the condition resolves or Investigator determines that the patient's health has returned to an acceptable state.  In the event that a patient is lost to follow-up (LTFU), the Investigators should document due diligence efforts to maintain contact with any subjects with at least 3 attempts by email or telephone with the final attempt being made by certified mail.  6 ADVERSE EVENTS An adverse event is any unfavorable, unintended sign, symptom, condition or disease in a study subject, where the experience occurs during the course of the study, regardless of its relationship to the test product or surgical procedure. Follow-up of an AE, even after the completion of the study is required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the Investigator and TELA Bio.  All AEs will be recorded in the Electronic Case Report Form and source documents.  The Investigator will assess each event in terms of severity and relationship to study product, as follows: TABLE 1 Intensity Definition  Mild Experiences that are transient, requiring no special treatment, or do not interfere with the subject’s daily activities   Moderate  Experiences that introduce some level of inconvenience or concern to the subject and may somewhat interfere with daily activities but are usually ameliorated by simple therapeutic measures, such as over the counter (OTC) medications. 
TELA Bio, Inc   OviTex®  
 Investigational Plan         Page 29       v2.0_15-Jun-2017 OviTex®    Severe  Experiences that are unacceptable or intolerable, significantly interrupt the subject’s usual daily activity, and/or require systemic drug therapy or other treatment, including other medical or surgical intervention or hospitalization.  6.1 RELATIONSHIP The relationship or association of the AE to study product will be characterized by the following categories:   Not related:   • There is no temporal relationship between the study product/treatment and the event, which makes a causal relationship clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes, e.g. not related to study product. • Other factors, such as concurrent illness, progression or expression of a disease, or a reaction to a concomitant medication are a more likely the cause of the event.  It is improbable that the study product caused the AE.  Possibly related: • The AE cannot be fully explained by other causes, and it is possible that the study product caused the event.  Related: • A reasonable temporal association exists between the AE and the study product, and based upon the investigators clinical experience, the association of the AE with the study product treatment seems probable. • A definite or certain temporal association exists between the AE and study product, and based upon the Investigator’s clinical experience, the association of the AE with study product seems definite or certain.

 Investigational Plan         Page 30       v2.0_15-Jun-2017 OviTex®   6.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS Serious Adverse Events are those Adverse Events that are: • Are life-threatening, • Are fatal, • Result in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of a hospitalization, • Result in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or • Result in congenital anomaly or birth defect.  6.3 ANTICIPATED AND UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECTS 6.3.1 Anticipated Adverse Events Anticipated adverse events related to ventral hernia repair include post- operative surgical site events such as ileus, deep or superficial wound infection, seroma, hematoma, wound dehiscence, skin necrosis, fistulae and recurrent hernia. A comprehensive list of these events can be found in a patient information brochure at the American College of surgery website; (http://www.facs.org/public_info/operation/brochures/ventral_hernia.pdf), see Appendix 7).  Although anticipated, should these events occur in subjects enrolled in this study, they are considered Adverse Events and should be noted in the eCRF.  In addition to those events listed above, there are other anticipated adverse device effects that include failure of the product to incorporate, rupture of the OviTex® Permanent 1S reinforced bioscaffold sheet or dehiscence of the product, mesh infection, bowel obstructions from adhesions or other mesh complications. These events, although possible and therefore defined as anticipated, are considered to be rare occurrences.  
TELA Bio, Inc   OviTex®  
 Investigational Plan         Page 31       v2.0_15-Jun-2017 OviTex®  6.3.2 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADEs)  As per 21 CFR 812.3, Unanticipated adverse device effects are those effects, which have a serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that effect, problem or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence.  In this study all SAEs as defined in Section 6.2 above and adverse events which occur that are not identified will be considered Unanticipated Device Effects and will be reported to the Sponsor as described in Section 6.4.  6.4 INVESTIGATOR REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 6.4.1 Reporting Serious Adverse Events In addition to notation in the CRF, all SAEs will also require completion of a separate reporting form for submission to the Sponsor through Day 90. All Serious Adverse Events will be reported to TELA Bio within 24 hours of the Investigator’s first awareness of their occurrence. Following the Day 90 visit, only SAEs considered by the Investigator to be “Related or “Possibly Related” to the study product will require completion of the additional reporting form for submission to the Sponsor. Conversely, following the Day 90 visit, it will no longer be necessary to complete the separate reporting form for those SAEs that the Investigator determines to be “Unrelated” to the OviTex mesh.    6.4.2 Reporting Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADEs) Unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs) are those that in nature, severity or degree of incidence differ from the list of anticipated adverse events above.  UADEs will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the Investigator’s first awareness of their occurrence.  
TELA Bio, Inc   OviTex®  
 Investigational Plan         Page 32       v2.0_15-Jun-2017 OviTex®  6.5 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT AND UADE REVIEW Reported SAEs and UADEs will be reviewed and investigated per TELA Bio Operating Procedures. When considered appropriate, TELA Bio will notify pertinent regulatory bodies and all Investigators within 10 working days of TELA Bio’s receipt of notification of the event.    It is the Investigators responsibility to notify their respective IRBs.  6.6 COMPLAINTS Any deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness or performance of OviTex® Permanent 1S reinforced bioscaffold, but which are not Adverse Events, will be promptly reported to the Sponsor’s Customer Service Department.   7 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND DATA MANAGEMENT 7.1 SAMPLE SIZE A sample size of up to 100 subjects is planned for this study.  This is a sample of convenience and is estimated to be sufficient to allow assessment of clinical performance in this patient population.  7.2 STATISTICAL METHODS Statistical methods will be carried out in accordance with the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) developed for this study.  The majority of data will be expressed as descriptive statistics. A p-value of less than or equal to 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Any confidence bounds will show two-sided 95% confidence interval limits. Categorical variables will be summarized by number and percent. Continuous variables will be summarized by total number (N), mean, standard deviation, median, min and max.  It is anticipated that the data will be evaluated using standard parametric and non-parametric procedures. Analyses of particular interest will be: 
TELA Bio, Inc   OviTex®  
 Investigational Plan         Page 33       v2.0_15-Jun-2017 OviTex®  1. Correlation of rate of surgical site wound infection to SSI wound classification, number of previous repairs and pre-morbid conditions. 2. Correlation of surgical site occurrences or wound related events to re-herniation, BMI, number of previous abdominal. 3. Correlation of number of previous repairs with true hernia recurrence 4. Correlation of a visible bulge at hernia repair site with true hernia recurrence 5. Correlation of subject abdominal wall function and QoL with bulging at the hernia repair site and hernia recurrence rates.  The primary and secondary endpoints of this study will be also be compared to the clinical outcomes reported for other prospective studies in the literature. The results will be compared for the group as a whole, and, if the numbers will allow this, for subgroups of subjects exhibiting similar baseline characteristics, such as size of the hernia, co-morbid conditions, number of previous abdominal procedures etc.  7.3 PLANNED ANALYSIS Interim analyses will be performed to assess the short-term outcomes when the first 25, 50 and 75 active subjects reach 90 days. The final analysis for the primary endpoint will be performed when all active subjects have completed their 90-day follow-up, and when all subjects have completed their Month 12 visit.  Additional analyses will be done when subjects have completed their 12 and 24 months visits.  7.4 RISK ANALYSIS 7.4.1 Potential Risks Potential risks of surgery with the OviTex® Permanent 1S reinforced bioscaffold device are similar to those that are encountered with other surgical meshes used to reinforce and/or repair 
TELA Bio, Inc   OviTex®  
 Investigational Plan         Page 34       v2.0_15-Jun-2017 OviTex®  soft tissue where weakness exists. The associated risks will also be noted in the Informed Consent Form that all study subjects are required to sign prior to participation in the investigation.  As per the patient information brochure of the American College of Surgery, the risks of ventral hernia repair include, but are not limited to: • Recurrence • Seroma • Intestines / bowel injury or temporary decrease in motility • Urinary retention • Wound infection • Pain • Hernia at port site • Hematoma or bleeding into the abdomen • Heart and breathing problems • Death http://www.facs.org/public_info/operation/brochures/ventral_hernia.pdf (See Appendix 7)  7.4.2 Potential Benefits Subjects receiving the OviTex® Permanent 1S reinforced bioscaffold device may not experience any direct benefit as a result of the study. However, there is the potential that the use of the product may lead to lower incidence of seroma, infection and re-herniations than reported in the literature for synthetic and biologic meshes, as well as an overall lower cost of treatment.  8 CLINICAL SUPPLIES 8.1 STORAGE The OviTex® Permanent 1S reinforced bioscaffold device should be stored in a clean, dry location at room temperature (25°C). The device should not be frozen.

 Investigational Plan         Page 39       v2.0_15-Jun-2017 OviTex®  clinical information regarding specific subjects. In these situations, information will be provided to regulatory authorities by the assigned subject number and subject initials.  The investigator agrees that complete source documents for this study will need to be available to appropriately qualified personnel from TELA Bio (or their designee) or to country specific health authority inspectors after appropriate notification. The verification of Electronic Case Report Form data will be done by direct inspection of source documents (where permitted by law). Record review will be done in adherence with HIPAA and in a manner that protects subject confidentiality.  During the conduct of the study, Investigators must agree not to publicly disclose any study related information including the study design, results or conclusions of the investigation without prior consent of TELA Bio.  9.7 PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS While not expected, it is possible that TELA Bio may need to amend the clinical protocol (for example, at the request of the FDA, due to emergence of new information etc.). In the event that this is needed, the protocol amendment will be reviewed and approved internally by the appropriate TELA Bio staff. Once finalized, the amendment will be distributed to the participating Investigator sites. Protocol amendments must undergo IRB review and approval at each clinical site, but may undergo expedited review if minor changes are made in the protocol that does not alter subject risk. The written approval from the IRB for the amendment should specifically refer to the Investigator, the protocol number and title, and reference any amendment numbers that are applicable.

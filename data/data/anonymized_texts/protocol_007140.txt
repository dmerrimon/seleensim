3.0 BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
Radiation therapy (RT) is an essential treatment for people with cancer, but is associated with 
significant  toxicities.  After  breast -conserving  surgery,  radiotherapy  to the conserved  breast  halves 
reduces the rate at which the disease recurs and the breast  cancer death rate by about a sixth1. 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Department of Radiation Oncology annually treats 1000 
post-mastectomy  patients  (~400  at MSK  Main;  ~600  at MSK  regionals)  and ~1400  post-lumpectomy 
patients (~500 at MSK Main; ~900  at MSK Regionals) with breast cancer with external beam 
radiation, of whom approximately 43.8% are expected to develop grade 2 -3 acute radiation 
dermatitis  (ARD)  with moist  desquamation,  providing  a compelling  rationale  for effective  prophylactic 
skin interventions and highlighting a need for therapeutic development. Standard of care guidelines 
for radiation dermatitis prevention have been developed at MSKCC for patients receiving post - 
mastectomy radiation therapy. These guidelines re commend application of topical steroids twice 
daily from day 0 of radiation through two weeks after completion of radiation. While topical steroids 
are established as an effective prophylactic therapy for acute radiation dermatitis2 in post - 
mastectomy pat ients by reducing the incidence of moist desquamation (g2 -3 ARD) from 66.7% to 
43.8%, there is a paucity of therapies to expedite healing of acute (grade 2 to 3) radiation dermatitis 
wounds. Furthermore, MSKCC patients receiving radiation therapy without m astectomy (e.g., after 
lumpectomy) are routinely treated with topical steroids.  
Topical  Oleogel -S10 would  augment  the wound  care armamentarium  to treat ARD  wounds. Oleogel - 
S10 is a sterile gel consisting of 10% dry triterpene extract (TE) refined from Bet ulae cortex (birch

bark)  of which  72% to 88% is betulin,  and the remaining  ingredients  are primarily  betulinic  acid, 
lupeol, oleanolic acid, erythrodiol, and residue of the extraction solvent and 90% sunflower oil.  
Oleogel -S10 Mechanism  of Action3: 
 
 
In January 2016 Oleogel -S10 received a marketing authorization in the European Economic Area 
under the tradename Ep isalvan® for the treatment of partial thickness wounds in adults (Episalvan 
EPAR,  first published  05Feb2016) and  on 9/10/2018,  the US FDA granted  Investigational  New Drug 
(IND) clearance to Oleogel -S10. 
Pivotal  clinical  studies  were  performed  in patients  with split-thickness  skin graft (STSG)  donor  sites 
wounds and in patients with Grade 2a burn wounds4. The primary efficacy end -point in the two 
pivotal studies on STSG donor sites wounds were intra -individual difference in time to wound 
closure (a t least 95% epithelialization) between wound halves, either treated with Oleogel -S10 
(AP101) gel and non -adhesive wound dressing, or with non -adhesive wound dressing alone. In

 both pivotal studies, Oleogel -S10 gel met the primary end -point an d was significantly superior in 
both studies  compared  to standard  dressing.  In the first study,  the mean  time from surgery  to wound 
closure was 17.1 days with standard of care treatment and 15.5 days when the wound was treated 
with Oleogel -S10 gel every 3 to 4 days or more frequently depending on dressing changes5. The 
mean intra -individual difference in time to wound closure between the wound halves was -1.4 days. 
The difference was statistically significant (p<0.0001). The results in the second study were  
consistent with the first study. The mean time from surgery to wound closure was 16.0 days with 
standard dressing and 15.1 days when the wound was treated with Oleogel -S10 gel. The mean 
intra-individual difference in time to wound closure between the woun d halves was -0.8 days and 
again statistically significant (p<0.0232)4. 
In the pivotal  study  performed  in patients  with Grade  2a partial  thickness  burn wounds who  received 
Oleogel -S10 application at least every other day with dressing changes6, the primary endpoint was 
percentage of patients showing earlier healing of the Oleogel -S10 gel  treated wound half compared 
with the Octenilin® Wound Gel treated half. 85.7% o f all treated patients had faster healing with 
Oleogel -S10 gel6. According  to the mean  expert  evaluation, the  mean  time from the burn accident  to 
wound closure was 7.6 days for Oleogel -S10 gel and 8.8 days for Octenilin® Wound Gel4. 
We hypothesize applicat ion of topical  Oleogel -S10 to  grade  2 – 3 acute  radiation dermatitis  wounds 
after radiation  for breast  cancer  would  expedite  wound  healing,  leading  to improvements  in patients’ 
quality of life.  
 
 
4.0 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
4.1 Design  
Design:  This is a single -center,  prospective,  randomized,  double -blind  study.  
Purpose:  This study  is designed  to to evaluate  the efficacy  of topical  Oleogel -S10 gel when 
used  as an adjunctive  treatment  to topical  corticosteroids  (indicated  for the treatment  of skin 
dermatoses) for the treatment of grade 2/3 radiation dermatitis  
Patient  population:  Patients  18 years  or older  with breast  cancer and  radiation  dermatitis 
grade 2/3.  
Duration  and follow -up: A total of 50 patients  with breast  cancer  experi encing grade  2/3 
radiodermatitis during their last 5 fractions of radiation therapy (i.e., after fraction day 20 
(when completing 25 total fractions) or after fraction day 25 (when completing 30 total 
fractions inlusive of a 5 fraction boost)) of radiation  therapy will be enrolled, such that 25 
patients with breast cancer will be randomized to triamcinolone 0.1% cream once every 
morning (QAM) and vehicle gel once prior to bedtime (QHS) and 25 patients will be 
randomized to triamcinolone 0.1% cream QAM and t opical Oleogel -S10 gel QHS for a 3 
week period.  The primary  assessment will be measured at Calendar Day 14 after start of

 topical  application  of Oleogel -S10 gel or vehicle  gel. Completion  of the study  will be followed 
by a safety visit at 7 weeks (Day 49). Each patient will be on treatment for 21 days unless 
they experience any progression of RD to grade 4+, or intolerable or serious treatment - 
related AE. At 24 weeks (Day 168) after completion of radiation the  patient will return to the 
clinic to assess for effects of the investigational treatment on the late effects of radiation.  
4.2 Intervention  
Patients who are receiving radiation therapy for breast cancer will be treated with either 
triamcinolone 0.1% cream QAM  and vehicle gel QHS; or triamcinolone 0.1% cream QAM 
and topical Oleogel -S10 gel QHS for 21 days. At the time of grade 2/3 RD, patients will be 
enrolled into the study. All patients will have standard of care (SOC) triamcinolone 0.1% 
cream  applied  to the area of radiation  QAM.  Patients  randomized  into Oleogel -S10 will have 
Oleogel -S10 applied onto the area of radiation QHS.  Those randomized to the comparator 
arm will have a vehicle/placebo gel applied to the area of radiation QHS, once a day for 21 
days.  For both study arms, treatment will continue for a period of 21 days, or until 
progression of RD to grade 4+, intolerable adverse event (AE) or serious AE related to the 
investigational agent.  
Enrolled patients will be treated with our standard MSK fraction ation for PMRT of 50Gy/2Gy 
per fraction or post -lumpectomy with dose and  fractionation per physician discretion allowing 
both a 3D conformal and IMRT/VMAT planning technique. A chest wall boost for PMRT is 
allowed  if indicated.  Hypofractionation  for PMRT w ill not be allowed.  The use of bolus  for our 
PMRT or post -lumpectomy patients is standardized by our MSK bolus guidelines policy. The 
thickness of bolus will be noted for each patient.  
Standardized photos, grading with CTCAE, PRO -CTCAE and Radiation -Induce d Skin 
Reaction Assessment Scale (RISRAS) will be obtained every week from day 0 of trial 
through  day 21; and  then subsequently  at the week 7  safety  visit (Day  49), and  24- week 
(Day 168) long -term follow up visit.

 Triamcinolone  acetonide  is a derivative  of prednisolone  with high glucocorticoid  activity  and 
low mineralocorticoid activity. Triamcinolone acetonide is the acetonide  salt form of 
triamcinolone , a topical synthetic corticosteroid with anti -inflammatory, antipruritic, and 
vasoconstrictive properties. Triamcinolone acetonide exerts its effect by binding to 
cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors and subsequently activates glucocorticoid receptor – 
mediated gene expression. This results in synthesis of certain anti -inflammatory proteins, 
with inhibition of synthesis of certain inflammator y mediators. Specifically, triamcinolone 
acetonide appears to induce phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, thereby controlling the 
release of the inflammatory precursor arachidon ic acid  from membrane phospholipids by 
phospholipase A2.  
Because triamcinolone is fluorinated and also contains a substituted 17 -hydroxyl group, it is 
not metabolized in the skin. Repeated application results in a cumula tive depot effect in the 
skin, which may lead to a prolonged duration of action and increased systemic absorption. 
As circulating  levels  are below  the level of detection,  the use of pharmacodynamic  endpoints 
for assessing the systemic exposure of topical t riamcinolone is necessary. Once in the 
systemic circulation, triamcinolone is metabolized in the liver, but systemic metabolism has 
not been  fully quantified.  Excretion of triamcinolone acetonide  and its  metabolites occurs via 
the urine and bile.

 are reported for these substances. Besides antibacterial, antimycotic, antiviral, anti - 
inflammatory effects and antitumour effects, the triterpenes also display wound healing - 
promoting effects. Oleogel -S10 is applied topically. The effects of TE were inv estigated by 
preclinical  in vitro and in vivo studies  as well as by clinical  phase  2 and 3 studies  in different 
indications, including a phase 2 study in epidermolysis bullosa (EB).  
Non-clinical  Studies  
Parenteral 14 - and 28 -day repeated dose toxicity stud ies in rats and dogs, respectively, 
showed no systemic test substance related changes except for those expected due to the 
insolubility of the TE extract at the injection site. Dermal application to intact or abraded 
minipig skin  did not result in  any systemic  toxicity  or adverse  local reactions  in a 4-week local 
tolerability study. A 39 -week study in 24 Göttingen minipigs to measure the dermal safety of 
Oleogel -S10 versus sunflower oil control and sham -treated animals following daily non - 
occlusive  adminis tration  to intact  skin representing  10% of the  body  surface  area, is ongoing. 
An interim report at 3 -months indicates no significant treatment -relate findings including the 
analysis  from skin biopsies  taken  at this timepoint. Systemic  toxicity  was assessed  in juvenile 
rats following  daily oral administration  (by gavage)  of TE in sunflower  oil. The objective  of this 
GLP study was to investigate the potential toxicity once daily from Day 10 to at least Day 63 
of age, inclusive, and to assess the rever sibility of any observed effects over a 28 -day 
treatment -free period. Significant systemic exposure was achieved although both Cmax and 
AUC were lower at Day 63 due to differences in absorption by the immature and mature 
intestinal  tract. At  the doses  tested (30, 100  or 300 mg/kg/day)  TE was well tolerated, with  no 
adverse effect on growth or development. For the females, minimal to moderate periportal 
vacuolation was seen in the liver at all dose levels, which was considered not to be adverse 
as the change  typically reversed after a 28 -day treatment -free period and there were no 
corresponding liver enzyme changes in the females. Based on the above findings in these 
juvenile animals, the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was considered to be 300 
mg/kg /day. At this dose, mean total systemic exposure (AUC0 -24) of betulin, the primary 
component of TE, on Day 63 of age was 3,140 ng.h/mL and 2,110 ng.h/mL in males and 
females, respectively far in excess of any systemic exposure anticipated in the clinical s tudy. 
A further 6 -month systemic toxicity study in adult rats is currently ongoing. A study to 
investigate the effects of systemic exposure of TE on fertility and early embryonic 
development was completed and showed there was no negative impact when TE was  
delivered orally. Additionally, Oleogel -S10/TE did not act as a sensitiser, was not phototoxic, 
and was negative in all genotoxicity studies.  
Clinical  Studies  
A phase  2 study  in EB patients  (12 wounds  of 10  patients)  (Schwieger -Briel 2017),  as well as 
observations  in 4 additional  single  case  reports  suggest  that Oleogel -S10 may accelerate  the 
healing of EB partial  thickness wounds. Oleogel -S10 was well tolerated and no adverse  drug 
reactions were observed. That Oleogel -S10 can accelerate the wound he aling process was 
demonstrated in other wound types. In one phase 2 (24 patients) and three clinical phase 3 
trials (280 patients) in partial thickness wounds, Oleogel -S10 showed a faster healing than 
standard treatment: in split -thickness skin graft donor  site wounds the 17 -day healing period 
with standard  treatment  was reduced by  1 to 2 days (Barret 2017), in  Grade 2a burn wounds 
the 9 -day healing period with standard treatment was reduced by 1 day. The studies 
compared intra -individually the difference i n time to wound healing between wound halves 
treated with Oleogel -S10 versus wound halves treated with standard of care. The number of 
adverse events such as wound infections was lower on wound halves treated with Oleogel -

 S10 compared  to those  treated  with standard  of care.  The most  frequently  observed  adverse 
reactions were wound complication (in 2.9% of patients), pain of skin (2.5%) and pruritus 
(1.3%). Adverse reactions were administration site reactions only. Clinical stud ies in further 
indications showed that TE was safe and well tolerated in atopic dermatitis (33 patients), 
psoriasis (24 patients), and actinic keratosis (151 patients). In summary, pharmacological 
data obtained with in vitro and in vivo  model  systems  supports  the potential  utility  of topically 
applied Oleogel -S10 in the treatment of grade 2 to 3 radiation dermatitis wounds.  
Triamcinolone  acetonide  
Triamcinolone acetonide is indicated for the treatment of the following: moderate -to-severe 
inflam matory manifestations (including pruritus), corticosteroid -responsive dermatologic 
disorders (such as alopecia areata), atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, generalized 
exfoliative dermatitis, Rhus dermatitis (caused by plants such as poison ivy), seborr heic 
dermatitis,  eczema  (including severe  hyperkeratotic eczema,  severe nummular eczema,  and 
severe  eczematous  conditions  of the hands  or feet),  granuloma  annulare,  keloids,  cutaneous 
lichen planus, lichen simplex chronicus, lichen striatus, subacute cutan eous and discoid 
lupus erythematosus, pretibial myxedema, necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum, pemphigoid, 
pemphigus, pityriasis rosea, sarcoidosis, sunburn, and urticaria.  
 
Labeling:  Medication  labels  will comply  with US legal.  They  will supply  no informat ion about 
the patient. The same storage conditions will be described on each medication label.  
5.2 Drug  supply  and storage  
The drug will be shipped by Amryt Pharma directly to the MSKCC pharmacy. It will be 
received by a designated person at the MSKCC pharmacy, handled and stored properly and 
safely, and kept in a secured location to which only the investigator/pharmacist and/ or 
designated  assistants  will have  access.  Upon  receipt, Oleogel -S10 and vehicle  gel should  be 
stored  according  to the instructions  specified  on the drug labels  [Store  at below  30°C  (86°F)]. 
Study tubes will be coded (no identifiable information regarding contents of vehicle or 
Oleogel -S10); both vehicle and Oleogel -S10 will have similar texture and color and will be 
indistinguishable.  
 
Triamcinolone acetonide should be  stored according to  the instructions specified  on the drug 
labels.  At the baseline  visit, patients  will receive a  calculated  number  of tubes  of Oleogel -S10 
gel or vehicle gel and one 454g jar of of triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% cream (standard of 
care). Additional  jar(s)  will be made  available to the patients as  needed,  after they have used 
up the initial jar (as per study instructions) and returned the empty container to the study 
staff. Topical Triamcinolone are stored at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) [See USP Controlled 
Room Temperature]  
These  instructions  will also be made  clear  to the patient  for storage  and self-administration  of 
Oleogel -S10 or Vehicle placebo gel at home (Patient Information Sheet, Appendix IV). At 
visits 1 -3, a 7 -day supply of study drug will be dispensed. Daily dose is 0.002 gram per cm2 
of acute radiation derma titis; total dispensed drug dose is 0.014 gram/cm2 x  cm2 of acute 
radiation dermatitis.

7.0 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
A member of the patient’s treatment team, a protocol investigator, or research staff, at 
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center  (MSKCC)  will identify  potential  research  subjects.  If 
the investigator is a member of the treatment team, s/he will screen their patient’s medical 
records for suitable research study participants and discuss the study and their potential for 
enrolling in the research study. Potential subjects may also be r eferred to the 
investigator/research staff of the study by the treating physician or any MSKCC physician.  
Generally,  the patient’s  primary  radiation  oncologist  and primary  dermatologist  will identify 
potential research subjects.  
The participating investiga tors may also screen the medical records of patients with whom 
they do not have a treatment relationship for the limited purpose of identifying patients who 
would  be eligible  to enroll  in the study, and  to record  appropriate  contact  information  in order 
to approach these patients regarding the possibility of enrolling in the study.  
The following procedure will be employed in enrolling all participants into the study. 
(Potentially) eligible patients identified by the mechanism described in the preceding 
paragraphs, will be offered participation in the study. This will be accomplished by the 
treating physician, clinician, or research staff, in person. The purpose of the study will be 
explained to the patient and informed consent will be obtained from willing p articipants. 
(Potential  participants  will also be offered  the opportunity  to consider  participation  and review 
the consent documents (e.g. at home) with the option of providing consent in the future.) 
Subsequently, a consenting professional will call potential adult study participants to invite 
them to participate. Patients may be screened by the research te am at the patient’s location 
(e.g., in radiation oncology unit or dermatology unit). If they agree to enroll, then the eligible

 participants will be scheduled for in -person consenting (if not already performed) and 
baseline  assessments.  The patient  will be transferred  to the dermatology  clinic  for enrollment 
and study assessments, when possible on the same day, or within the study window. This 
visit will preferably coincide with patients’ standard -of-care visit. Potential participants who 
decline participation will not be  contacted  again  for the purpose of recruitment into the  study.  
We will only retain participants’ basic informati on (e.g. questionnaire responses, eligibility 
checklist,  etc.) that is needed  for study  reporting  purposes.  These  records  will be maintained 
on a secured Dermatology shared drive. We will also maintain a list of all participants 
approached throughout the e ntire study to record reasons for refusal and avoid re - 
approaching healthy volunteers that have been identified as ineligible or refusing 
participation. This list will be destroyed at the completion of the study.  
The investigators participating in this re search include physicians and research staff from 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, as listed on the face page of this protocol, who 
have successfully completed training for protection of human research subjects in 
compliance with MSKCC clinical rese arch policy. Written consent will be obtained by one of 
these  individuals  or his/her  designee,  who must  also have  successfully  completed  training  for 
protection of human subjects in compliance with MSKCC clinical research policy.  
During the initial conversation between the investigator/research staff and the patient, the 
patient may be asked to provide certain health information that is necessary to  the 
recruitment  and enrollment  process.  The investigator/research  staff may also review  portions 
of their medical records at MSKCC in order to further assess eligibility. They will use the 
information provided by the patient and/or in the  medical record t o confirm that the patient is 
eligible, and to contact the patient regarding research enrollment. If the patient turns out to 
be ineligible for the research study, the study personnel will destroy all information collected 
on the patient during the initial  conversation and medical records review, except for any 
information that must be maintained for screening log purposes.  
In most cases, the initial contact with the prospective subject will be conducted either by the 
treatment team, investigator or the res earch staff working in consultation with the treatment 
team. The recruitment process outlined presents no more than minimal risk to the privacy of 
the patients  who are screened  and minimal  PHI will be maintained  as part of a screening  log. 
For these reason s, we seek a (partial) limited waiver of authorization for the purposes of (1) 
reviewing medical records to identify potential research subjects and obtain information 
relevant to the enrollment process; (2) conversing with patients regarding possible 
enrollment; (3) handling of PHI contained within those records and provided by the potential 
subjects; and (4) maintaining information in a screening log of patients approached (if 
applicable).  
7.1 Research  Participant  Registration  
 
Confirm  eligibility  as defined  in the section  entitled  Inclusion/Exclusion  Criteria.  Obtain 
informed consent, by following procedures defined in section entitled Informed

 Consent Procedures. During the registration process registering individuals will be 
required  to complete  a protocol  specific  Eligibility  Checklist.  The individual  signing  the 
Eligibility Checklist is confirming whether or not the participant is eligible to  enroll in 
the study. Study staff are responsible for ensuring that all institutional requirements 
necessary to enroll a participant to the study have been completed. See related 
Clinical Research Policy and Procedure #401 (Protocol Participant Registratio n). 
 
7.2 Randomization  
This is a randomized double -blind label comparison of topical Oleogel -S10 versus 
vehicle  gel, when  added  to standard  of care (topical  triamcinolone).  After  eligibility  is 
established and immediately after consent is obtained, patients will be registered in 
the Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS). After registration, patients will be 
randomized in the Clinical Research Database (CRDB). Randomization will be 
accomplish ed by the method of random permuted block. Patients’ treatment 
assignments can be viewed in the CRDB only by CRDB staff.  
7.3 Blinding  
The study  will be conducted  using  a double -blind  design.  The randomization  process 
that occurs on screening visit will blind t he participant. The investigators will be 
unaware of the treatment assignment of participants unless unblinding is performed.  
7.4 Unblinding  
Participant unblinding will be performed after all study assessments have been 
completed (after completion of Visit 6) by the PI only. The PI will seek MSK IRB 
approval  prior to unblinding  the participant.  The study  team  will work  with CRDB  staff 
for unblinding after MSK IRB approves of it. Both the participant and the PI will be 
informed by CRDB personnel which arm the participant was randomized to.  
In case  of emergency,  emergency  unblinding  may be exercised  when  the PI believes 
that awarene ss of the subject's medication is beneficial to the management of the 
adverse event. When an emergency unblinding has taken place, the treatment 
identification information is only unmasked to the PI, and other personnel remains 
masked. The study team must discuss and receive approval from the PI before 
unblinding. Unblinding will be completed by contacting CRDB personnel.  
For participants  whose  treatment  assignment  has been  unblinded  due to emergency, 
the participant may continue the study treatment if the PI believes that the study 
medication is beneficial to the management of the patient’s wellbeing.

10.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  PLAN  
All patients  will receive  topical  triamcinolone  0.1%  cream  application  in the morning. Patients 
randomized to the Oleogel -S10 arm will be prescribed once nightly use of topical Oleogel - 
S10 gel and those randomized to the SOC arm will apply vehicle gel for 21 ±  2 days.  
Oleogel -S10 will be provided  as topical  gel. Triamcinolone  0.1%  cream  will be provided  as a 
cream.  
Once daily (at least 60 minutes before bedtime), patients will be instructed to apply a 1 mm 
thick layer of the topical Oleogel -S10 gel to the area of acute radiation dermatitis. Patients 
will receive  detailed  instructions  at the baseline  visit and receive  clear,  written  instructions  on 
the standarized application technique (see Patient Information Sheet, Appendix IV).  
Approximately  0.1g of Oleogel -S10 or vehicle  gel per cm2 of wound  will be applied.  Patients 
will be instructed to apply 1 fingertip unit (approximately 0.5g) per 250cm2 of wound.  
In the treatment  group, patients  will not be  allowed  to apply topical  emollients  to the treated 
area during the study, but if desired, they may apply t o untreated areas. Patients will be 
advised not to use products with chemicals or perfumes.  
We do not anticipate the  need for any adjustments to the treatment plan as consequence of 
adverse reactions to Oleogel -S10 (see section 15.0), but any patients with  adverse 
cutaneous  reactions  to treatment with Oleogel -S10 will be advised  to return  to clinic  to see a

 dermatologist right away. Adverse event reporting will be based on CTCAE v5.0, as 
applicable.  There  will be six on-site visits.  In the case  of pandemic  clinic  closures,  on-site 
visits may  be converted  to virtual visits in the  case  the patient  does  not have  a same -day 
standard of care or treatment visit.  
Patients will also be asked to use a diary to improve their compliance with the application of 
triamcinolone  0.1%  cream,  Oleogel -S10 gel, vehicle  gel, as well as to record  fingertip  units  of 
study gel applied, any adverse effects of treatment, and will be asked to bring diaries to all 
patient visits.  
Skin examinations will be part of the evaluation performed during baseline visit at day 1, day 
7, day 14, day 21, day 49, and Day 168. Patient s will also complete adapted PRO -CTCAE ™ 
questionnaires  to measure  dermatology -specific  patient -reported  symptoms  and outcomes  at 
each of the aforementioned visits for the area of ARD. Study questionnaires should take the 
participant no more than 10 minutes  to complete at each time point. Standarized 
photography will be performed day 1, day 7 ±  1 days, day 14 ±  2 days, day 21 ±  2 days, day 
49 ± 3 days, and Day 168 ±  7 days. Patients will be enrolled in the radiation oncology or 
dermatology clinics, and their  clinical response will be assessed in the Dermatology clinic of 
Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center located in Manhattan or Basking Ridge. Visits Day 
1 and Day 14 will be in -person visits. Visits Day 7, 21, 49, and 168 may be conducted in - 
person or vi rtual per patient preference.  
Measurement  of Wound  Surface  Area  
Wound surface area will be measured at each visit via Canfield Scientific, Inc, a HIPAA - 
compliant 3D imaging system that uses machine learning and computer vision to measure 
wounds. The Canfi eld software calculates the area once the user manually outlines the 
wound edge. Noncontiguous areas will each be outlined and the sum of the total area 
involved  will be used.  3D Canfield  photography  is the gold standard  wound  imaging  software 
for clinical  trials.  
The investigator  and authorized  site study  team  members  will receive  a standardized  training 
before start of the study. The ‘Photo Documentation Manual’ (Appendix) will provide a 
detailed description of the Canfield software, instructions for use, and a standard operating 
procedure of wound photography.  
Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse Events  (CTCAE)  v5.0 
The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events is a descriptive terminology 
which  is routinely  utilized  for Adverse  Event  (AE) reporting  in oncologic  patients.  A grading 
(severity) scale is provided for each AE term.  
PRO -CTCAE

12.0 CRITERIA  FOR  REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
Patients  will be removed  from the study  (and will not be replaced)  if: 
• They  develop  an adverse  event  necessitating  discontinuation  of topical  interventions.  
• They  develop  a grade  2 or higher  dermatologic  adverse  event  that has an attribution  by 
the investigator of at least ‘possibly’ treatment -related.  
• They  require  greater  than 14 days  off therapy  due to a treatment -related  adverse  event.  
• They  have  RD progression  to grade  4. 
• They  develop  new cutaneous  metastases  within  the treatment  area.  
 
Patients  will be removed  from the study  and replaced  if: 
• They  enroll  in an alternate  systemic  clinical  trial which  prohibits  concurrent  topical clinical 
trial participation.  
• They  choose  to withdraw  consent  for continued  participation.  
• Death  occurs  unrelated  to the RD. 
• They  are lost to follow -up before  RD can be evaluated.  
 
All patients  who receive  Oleogel -S10 or vehicle  and report  using  the treatment  will be 
evaluable for toxicity.  
 
13.0 CRITERIA  FOR  OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  AND  ENDPOINT  EVALUABILITY

 surface  area and adverse  events  will be performed  by a dermatologist.  Wound  size 
will be measured using a HIPAA compliant 3D clinical imaging system.  
The following  are the secondary  outcomes:  
• Time to complete resolution of grade 2/3 radiation dermatitis assessed via 
standardized 3D clinical imaging. We will continue to monitor the  study lesion 
area after the Day 14 (primary  outcome)  time point.  Lesional  area will monitored 
and imaged at all study visits through Day 168. A wound will be considered 
completely healed when wound size is 0 cm2. 
• Differences  in adverse  events  at Day 21, as determined  by the CTCAE  v5.0;  and 
health -related quality of life (HRQoL): as assessed by PRO -CTCAE (Appendix) 
and the Radiation -Induced Skin Reaction Assessment Scale (RISRAS).  
The tertiary  objectives  of this  study  are to determine  the effect  of topical Oleogel -S10 
gel on the late effects of radiation, such as fibrosis, telangiectasias, 
hyperpigmentation, and dermatitis.  
 
 
Criteria  for evaluation  of clinical  efficacy:  
Wound  surface  area: 
The PI or a trained  designee  will measure  the subject’s  woun d and calculate  surface 
area via the 3D Canfield Imaging Software for in person visits and via patient - 
submitted photographs for virtual visits, when applicable.  
 
Time  to healing  of wound : 
Wounds  in both groups  will be measured  and photographed  at baseline/Day  1, Day 7, 
Day 14, Day 21, Day 49, and Day 168. Measurements will be taken via Canfield 3D 
Imaging  softwares on  baseline/Day  1, Day  7*, Day  14, Day  21*, Day 49*, Day 168*. A 
wound will be considered healed when wound size is 0 c m2. (*Only for patients who 
present in person; otherwise wounds will be examined via patient -submitted home 
photos reviewed during virtual visit.)  
 
CTCAE  Grading : 
Efficacy will be considered a mean improvement score in the CTCAE grade of each 
term of 0.3 or greater  at Visit 5.The  PI or a trained  designee  will assess the  subject’s 
skin for adverse events and late effects for the below parameters using the CTCAE 
version 5.0 grading (severity) scale shown in Appendix I:  
o Dermatitis  radiation  
o Body  odor 
o Pain of skin 
o Pruritus  
o Skin hyperpigmentation*

13.2 Criteria  for Study  Endpoint  Evaluability  
The efficacy  and tolerability  analysis  will be evaluated  for all intent -to-treat subjects, 
defined as all subjects who use standard of care or Oleogel -S10 topical and have 
baseline and at least one post -baseline data point.  
In case  of early  subject  withdrawal,  subjects  may be replaced  based  upon  overall 
enrollment numbers.  
14.0 BIOSTATISTIC S 
The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of topical Oleogel -S10 gel vs 
placebo  (vehicle  gel) when  added  to standard  of care (triamcinolone  0.1%  cream)  in reducing 
radiation wound  surface area, when applied for 14 days to the radiated  area of skin in 
patients with breast cancers and grade 2/3 dermatitis.  For the primary objective we are 
measuring radiation wound size at baseline (day 1) and and follow -up (day 14 +/ - 3 days).  
We are estimating  percent  change  in radiation  wound  size between  the two time points  as: 
Percent  change  from baseline  = (Baseline  size – Follow -up size)  x 100 
Baseline  size 
 
A mean  percent  change  will be estimated  for both Oleogel -S10 and vehicle  control  arms.  
We plan to enroll  and randomize  50 participants.  If we  lose ~10%  of our  participants  between 
baseline and follow -up due to attrition, we will have an effective sample size of 44 
participants for primary endpoint evaluation.  With 22 participants per treatment arm and an 
average percent reduc tion in the vehicle control arm of 0.2 or 20%, a common standard 
deviation of 0.2, and an alpha level of 5%; based on a two -sided means test we have >80% 
power to detect a mean difference of greater than 0.18 (Table). Estimates of percent 
reduction and sta ndard deviation in the vehicle control arm were arrived at by the principal 
investigator’s experience treating these lesions in this patient population. To test the 
differences in  mean percent change between the treatement groups at day 14, we will 
perform  an independent sample Student’s t -test.

Secondary Objectives are to describe the resolution rate of grade 2/3 radiation - 
induced  dermatitis.  Evaluation  of the safety  of Oleogel -S10, and the patient  reported 
symptoms will be assessed using the CTCAE v5.0 grading, the PRO -CTCAE 
(Appendix) and the Radiation -Induced Skin Reaction Assessment Scale (RISRAS).  
 
The efficacy of topical Oleogel -S10 gel vs placebo (vehicle gel) when added to standard of 
care (triamcinolone  0.1%  cream)  in reducing  radiation  wound  surface  area,  when  applied  for 
21 days to the  radiated area of skin in patients with breast cancers and grade 2/3 dermatitis 
will be assessed as a secondary outcome, with the above methods used for the primary 
outcome.  
Time to lesion resolution is defined as time from radiation therapy grade 2/3 derm atitis 
assessement to complete resolution of the radiation dermatitis. Assessments and 
quantification  will be accomplished  through  the use of 3D clinical  imaging for  in-person  visits 
and home photography  for virtual visits. Patients with lesions that do not resolve at the time 
of study completion, or who are lost to follow -up, are to be censored at the last date of 
physician  assessment  and imaging.  The proportion  of patients  who achieve  resolution  of the 
dermatitis will be calculated along with their 95% confidence intervals for both treatment 
arms. The rate of overall lesion resolution will be estimated by the Kaplan -Meier method. A 
logrank test will be used to compare the distributions of resolution rates  by treatment arm.  
The rates of adverse events and the rates of grades 3 -5 adverse events will be tabulated 
using the CTCAE v5.0. These adverse events will be presented on an individual basis and 
summarized using descriptive statistics. The proportion of p atients with these toxicities and 
the severity will assessed at each study time point along with exact binomial confidence 
intervals. The proportion of pariticipants with adverse events by treatment group at each 
evaluation  time point  will be evaluated  using chi-square  statistics  or Fisher’s  exact  tests.  The 
distribution of patient -assessed Radiation -Induced Skin Reaction Assessment Scale 
(RISRSAS) scores will be assessed at each study time point. T -tests or Wilcoxon rank -sum 
tests will be used to assess di fferences in RISRAS scores.  
For the patient reported outcomes (PRO -CTCAE and RISAS) we will use descriptive 
statistics and graphical methods to show the measures at each time point and to display the 
the trends  in these  measures  across  the evaluation  time points.  For each  intstrument , we will 
initially use ANOVA methods with repeated measures and a time component to assess 
whether there are any significant changes over time. If we observe significant changes, we 
will explore the subject -specific graphs to see if there is a consistent pattern in the changes 
(i.e., trending upward, trending downward, upward then levelling off, etc). We will also use 
random effects models  to investigate any longitudinal associations. This method can

 account  for the serial  correlation,  time-varying  covariates  and missing  interval  measures  from 
any of the study participants.  
We will invariably have some missing data during the course of the follow -up. We will try to 
determine whether these data are missing at random. With qua lity of life measures, patients 
with lower initial quality of life measures might be more prone to missingness. If we find a 
single  missing  quality  of life  instrument  for a given  time point  for a participant,  we will assume 
that this is missing at random. If we observe more than one missing instrument for a 
participant, we will attempt to determine whether refusal to complete the instrument is 
associated with disease severity and/or overall quality of life. If we see a general pattern of 
missingness within the study population, we will estimate the degree and direction to which 
this is occurring.  
As an exploratory objective, we will assess wound resolution in intertriginous vs non - 
intertriginous skin and with respect to radiation dose and late effects of ra diation, such as 
fibrosis, telangiectasias, hyperpigmentation, and dermatitis. We will also characterize the 
timeline to onset of these AEs. The absolute number, distribution and the proportion of 
participants  who experience  these  adverse  events  will summa rized  by study  time point. The 
radiation  dose  to the skin will be recorded  to evaluate  if treatment hotspots  impact  dermatitis 
healing rates. We will record V110 to the skin of all patients enrolled on the trial 
retrospectively. The skin organ at risk volume will be defined as the 5mm from the patient 
surface encompassing the entire treatment portal.  
The analysis of thi s exploratory objective will be similar to the secondary objective with 
elapsed  time to resolution  of radiation  dermatitis  defined  as time from radiation  therapy  grade 
2/3 dermatitis assessement to complete resolution of the radiation dermatitis. Lesions w ill be 
categorized  as in intertriginous  vs non-intertriginous  by the study  investigator  based  on visual 
skin examination at Study Day 1. Lesion resolution will be assessed by Canfield imaging.  
Patients with lesions that do not resolve at the time of study completion, or who are lost to 
follow -up, are to be censored at the last date of physician assessment and imaging. The 
proportion of patients who achieve resolution of the dermatitis will be calculated along with 
their 95% confidence  intervals  for both treatment  arms  and by categorization  of intertriginous 
vs non -intertriginous areas. The rate of overall lesion resolution will be estimated by the 
Kaplan -Meier method. A logrank test will be used to compare the distributions of resolution 
rates by treatment a rm and by intertriginous vs non -intertriginous areas.  
Patient compliance with the application of the topical Oleogel -S10 gel or placebo will be 
assessed  at study  visits  2, 3, &  4 (Day  7 +/-1 day, Day  14 +/- 2 days,  & Day 21 +/- 2 days). 
For each  pariticipant  the total days compliant  from Baseline to Day  21 will be summed.  We 
will calculate  the proportion  of days  compliant  with application  of topical  Oleogel -S10 gel or 
placebo for each participant. We will also evaluate the distribu tions of compliance for the 
treatment and placebo arms, and compare mean or median compliance using a t -test or a 
Wilcoxon rank sum test.

 15.0 TOXICITIES/RISKS/SIDE  EFFECTS  
15.1  Oleogel -S10 
Safety  
Intensive non -clinical in vitro and in vivo experiments in different species of different 
ages and different routes of administration up to long -term chronic use raise no 
concerns for conducting clinical trials. In single and repeated dose experiments, in 
safety pharmacology tests, and in the genotoxic evaluation no adverse effects have 
been observed. Taking results of all toxicological experiments together, and keeping 
in mind that the intended route of TE is the Oleogel -S10 topical application, TE can, 
therefore, be considered as safe when applied to the skin, including abraded skin. In 
clinical  trials  in patients  with partial  thickness  wounds Oleogel -S10 was well tolerated. 
The most common adverse events related to Oleogel -S10 concerned 25 patients out 
of 280 (9%), comprising pain of skin (2.9%) and pruritus (1.4%).  
 
Adverse  Reactions  Reported  in Clinical  Trials  with Donor  Site Wounds  and Grade  2a Burns  
 
 
Deaths, serious  adverse  events  and adverse  events  that led to discontinuation 
The number  of patients  in the pooled  analysis  (study  BSH-12, BSG -12 and BBW -11) 
who experienced one or more serious AEs (SAEs) was low (15 or 5.4% of the 
patients). The most frequently reported SAEs were wound infection (4 or 1.4% of 
patients) and condition aggravated ( 2 or 0.7% of patients). All other SAEs were 
reported  for 1 (0.4%)  patient each. None  was considered  related  to treatment except 
for one SAE (wound  necrosis),  for which  causality  between  treatment  and event was 
reported  as “yes:  unknown”  by the investigator . Wound  necrosis  was experienced  by 
a 79-year-old male in the Grade 2a burn wound study BBW -11 (Patient B -02-02). 
Both the wound half treated with Oleogel -S10 and the wound half treated with 
standard of care (Octenilin® wound gel with fatty gauze dressing) had changed to 
Grade 2b and required skin grafting resulting in prolonged hospital stay. A change in 
burn wound  depth from Grade  2a to Grade  2b was expected  for up to 30% of patients 
in the study. Skin grafting is the standard treatment for Grade 2b burn wounds.

 No deaths  were  reported  in the treatment phase  of the studies.  Two deaths  in the 12 
months f ollow -up period were considered not related to the treatment. CTCAE 
Version 5 will be utilized for toxicity evaluation.  
 
15.2  Triamcinolone  acetonide  
Topical application of triamcinolone acetonide cream results in a markedly (~90%) lower 
relative  bioavailabili ty than oral administration.  Because  triamcinolone  is fluorinated  and also 
contains a substituted 17 -hydroxyl group, it is not metabolized in the skin. Repeated 
application results in a cumulative depot effect in the skin, which may lead to a prolonged 
duration of action and increased systemic absorption. As circulating leve ls are below the 
level of detection, the use of pharmacodynamic endpoints for assessing the systemic 
exposure of topical triamcinolone is necessary. Once in the systemic circulation, 
triamcinolone is metabolized in the liver, but systemic metabolism has no t been fully 
quantified. Excretion of triamcinolone acetonide and its  metabolites occurs via the urine  and 
bile. 
Absorption after topical application of triamcinolone is increased in areas that have skin 
damage, inflammation, or occlusion or in areas where  the stratum corneum is thin, such as 
the eyelids,  genitalia,  axillae,  and face.  The use of occlusive  dressings  with the application  of 
triamcinolone enhances penetration into the skin and may increase the chance of systemic 
absorption.  Ointments have a hy drating effect, are lipophilic, and enhance the penetration of 
triamcinolone into the skin. Triamcinolone gels, foams, and solutions also have enhanced 
topical penetration versus cream preparations. Once absorbed, maximal vasoconstrictive 
effects of triamc inolone occur within 1.5 hours of application. Anti -inflammatory effects are 
usually not seen for hours after triamcinolone application since the mechanism of action 
requires alterations in synthesis of proteins.  
Corticosteroid  Hypersensitivity  
Triamcinolo ne is contraindicated  in any patient  with a history  of corticosteroid  hypersensitivity 
and hypersensitivity to triamcinolone or any ingredients in the preparation. Although true 
corticosteroid hypersensitivity is rare, patients who have demonstrated a prio r 
hypersensitivity reaction to triamcinolone should not receive any form of triamcinolone. It is 
possible, although also rare, that such patients will display cross -hypersensitivity to other 
corticosteroids. It is advisable that patients who have a hyperse nsitivity reaction to any 
corticosteroid undergo skin testing, which, although not a conclusive predictor, may help to 
determine whether hypersensitivity to another corticosteroid exists. Such patients should be 
carefully monitored during and following the  administration of any corticosteroid.  
Cushing’s  Syndrome,  Hepatic  Disease,  Hypothalamic -Pituitary -Adrenal  (HPA) 
Suppression, Occlusive Dressing, Skin Abrasion  
Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible HPA suppression 
and/or  manifestations  of Cushing’s  syndrome  in some  patients.  Triamcinolone  acetonide  has

Page  30 of 37  
 been shown to suppress the HPA axis at doses as low as 2 g/day. C onditions that increase 
systemic absorption include application of high -potency corticosteroids, use over large 
surface  areas,  prolonged  use, use in areas  where  the epidermal  barrier is  disrupted  (i.e., skin 
abrasion), use in pediatric patients, use in pat ients with hepatic disease, and the use of an 
occlusive dressing. Triamcinolone acetonide preparations should not be used with occlusive 
dressings. Patients receiving large doses of a potent topical corticosteroid such as 
triamcinolone should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression and 
manifestations  of Cushing’s  syndrome.  If these  effects  are noted,  an attempt  should  be made 
to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less -potent 
corticosteroid. R ecovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon 
discontinuation. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of withdrawal may occur, requiring 
supplemental systemic corticosteroids.  
Diabetes  Mellitus  
Topical corticosteroids, including triamcinolon e, should be used with caution in patients with 
diabetes  mellitus.  Exacerbation  of diabetes  may occur  with systemic  absorption  of the topical 
corticosteroid. Use of topical corticosteroids may further delay healing of skin ulcers in 
diabetic patients.  
Pregnancy  
Triamcinolone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the 
potential  risk to the fetus.  Topical  corticosteroids,  including  triamcinolone,  should  not be used 
in large amounts, on large areas, or for prolonged periods of time in pregnant women.  
Guidelines recommend mild to moderate potency agents over potent corticosteroids, which 
should  be used  in short durations.  Fetal  growth  restriction  and a significantly  increased  risk of 
low birthweight have been reported with the use of potent or very potent topical 
corticosteroids during the third trimester, particularly when using more than 300 g. There are 
no adequate and well -controlled studies of the teratogenic effects from topical application of 
triamcinolone in pregnant women. Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after 
dermal, oral, and subcutaneous administration in animal studies. Triamcinolo ne has greater 
potency and, thus, greater teratogenic potential than other topical corticosteroids. After 
subcutaneous administration of triamcinolone acetonide to pregnant mice and rabbits, 
increased malformations, such as cleft palate and skeletal abnorm alities, were observed.  
Fungal  Infection,  Herpes  infection,  Infection,  Measles,  Peripheral  Vascular  Disease, 
Varicella, Viral Infection  
The normal inflammatory response to local infections can be masked by triamcinolone. 
Application of topical  corticosteroids  to areas  of infection, including  tuberculosis of the  skin, 
dermatologic fungal infection, and cutaneous or systemic viral infection (e.g., herpes 
infection, measles, varicella), should be initiated or continued only if the appropriate anti - 
infective  treatment  has been  instituted.  If the infection  does  not respond  to the antimicrobial 
therapy, the concurrent use of the topical corticos teroid should be discontinued until the

 infection  is controlled.  Topical  corticosteroids  may delay  the healing  of noninfected  wounds, 
such as venous stasis ulcers. Triamcinolone preparations should be used with caution in 
patients with marked ly impaired circulation or peripheral vascular disease; skin ulceration 
has been reported in these patients following topical corticosteroid use.  
Geriatric,  Skin  Atrophy  
Topical  corticosteroids  should  be used  for brief periods  or under  close  medical  supervision  in 
patients with evidence of preexisting skin atrophy. Geriatric patients may be more likely to 
have preexisting skin atrophy secondary to aging. Purpura and skin lacerations that may 
raise  the skin and subcutaneous  tissue  from deep  fascia  may be more  likely  to occur with  the 
use of topical corticosteroids in geriatric patients. Clinical trials of topical triamcinolone 
included insufficient numbers of elderly patients to perform a separate analysis of efficacy 
and safety in this population. On t he basis of the available data, no dosage adjustments are 
required for elderly patients receiving topical triamcinolone. Use of lower -potency topical 
corticosteroids may be necessary in some patients.

15.3 Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  Reporting  
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing 
hospitalization  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct 
normal life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or 
require  hospitalization  may be considered  serious  when,  based  upon  medical  judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or participant and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition  
 
Note : Hospital  admission  for a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an 
SAE.  
 
SAE reporting is required as soon as the participant starts investigational 
treatment/intervention.  SAE reporting is required for 30 -days after the participant’s last 
investigational  treatment/intervention.  Any event  that occur  after the 30-day period  that is 
unexpected and at least possibly related to protocol treatment must be reported.

Please  note:  Any SAE that occurs  prior to the start of investigational  treatment/intervention 
and is related to a screening test or procedure (i.e., a screening biopsy) must be reported.  
 
All SAEs must be submitted in PIMS. If an SAE requires submission to the HRPP office per 
IRB SOP RR -408 ‘Reporting of Serious Adverse Event s’, the SAE report must be submitted 
within  5 calendar  days  of the event.  All other  AEs must  be submitted  within  30 calendar  days 
of the event.  
The report  should  contain  the following  information:  
• The date the adverse  event  occurred  
• The adverse  event  
• The grade  of the event  
• Relationship  of the adverse  event  to the treatment(s)  
• If the AE was expected  
• Detailed  text that includes  the following  
o A explanation  of how  the AE was handled  
o A description  of the participant’s  condition  
o Indication  if the participant  remains  on the study  
• If an amendment  will need  to be made  to the protocol  and/or  consent  form 
• If the SAE is an Unanticipated  Problem  
15.4 External  SAE Reporting  
The SAE report  should  be completed  as per above  instructions.  If appropriate,  the report  will 
be forwarded to the FDA by the IND Office  
 
15.5 Reporting  to Amryt  Pharma  
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events : Within 5 days of first awareness of the event, the 
Investigator will report to Amryt by email to medinfo@amrytpharma.com  any Serious  
Adverse  Event (“SAE,”  as defined above ) for which  reporting is  required  under  this provision. 
SAEs are to be reported  for (1) Study subjects who are assigned or, in the  case of a blinded 
Study, possibly assigned to receive the Amryt Product. The Principal Investigator should 
report  an SAE as soon as it is determined  to meet  the definition,  even  if complete  information 
is not yet available.  
Lack  of Effect:  Even  though  there  may not be an associated SAE,  lack of  effect  of the Amryt 
Product may be reportable. As used in this Agreement, the term SAE will be understood to 
include reportable instances of lack of effect.

 Follow -up information : Investigator  will assist  Amryt  in investigating  any SAE and will provide 
any follow -up information reasonably requested by Amryt.  
Regulatory Reporting: Reporting an SAE to Amryt does not relieve the investigator of 
responsibility  for reporting  it to FDA or other  appropriate  Regula tory Authorities  as required.  
 
Reporting  of non-serious  adverse  events:  Non-serious  adverse  events  can be sent to Amryt 
at the end of the study when all data has been compiled and analysed.  
 
Occupational  exposure:  Due to the low risk profile  of the drug being  used  in this study,  MSK 
staff working with and around the study drug will follow all routine procedures, precautions 
and reporting of exposure.  
 
16.0 PROTECTION  OF HUMAN  PARTICIPANTS  
Prior  to the enrollment  of each  patient,  the risks,  benefits  and objectives  of the study  will be 
reviewed with the participant, including a discussion of the possible side effects. Patients 
reserve the right to withdraw participation from this study at any time.  
Risks : It’s unlikely  that significant  risks will be associated  with the limited  use of topical 
Oleogel -S10 and topical triamcinolone planned in this study.  
Benefits : The early use of topical Oleogel -S10 is hypothesized to wound size of acute 
radiation dermatitis with a positive safety profile.  This would serve as a novel topical therapy 
for management  of acute  radiation  dermatitis  wounds  and would improve  patients’  symptoms 
during treatment. Prophylactic and therapeutic topical corticosteroid (with triamcinolone) 
reduces severity of ARD and is standard of care.  
Possible toxicities/ adverse events: Adverse events are rare. 1 - <10% of patients 
developed local application -site side effects with Oleogel -S10 including pruritus and skin 
pain. Local application –site side effects anticipated with topica l triamcinolone include dry 
skin, erythema, pruritus, skin peeling, and irritation. These adverse events are not expected 
to necessitate treatment interruption. These adverse effects are not expected to necessitate 
treatment  interruption.  Systemic  toxiciti es, including  wound  infection and  GI events,  are rare. 
Toxicities are elaborated in section 11.0 of this protocol. The investigators will use a 
standardized form to assess adverse events during the visits, as well as rare reactions that 
could be reported b y the patient.  
Consent  process:  Participation  in this protocol  is voluntary.  All patients  will be required  to 
sign a statement of informed consent, which must conform to MSKCC IRB guidelines.  
Costs : Patients  will not be charged  for protocol  related  costs  
Alternatives : There  are no FDA-approved  topical  therapies  for the treatment  of acute 
radiation dermatitis wo unds.

 Confidentiality : Every  effort  will be made  to maintain  patient  confidentiality.  Research  and 
hospital  records are  confidential. Patients’ names  and any  other  identifying information  will 
not be used in reports or publications resulting from this study. Other authorized agencies 
and appropriate personnel may review patient records as required.  
16.1 Privacy  
MSK’s Privacy Office may allow the use and disclosure of protected health 
information  pursuant  to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.  The 
use and disclosure of protected health information will be limited to the 
individuals/entities described in the Research Authorization form. A Research 
Authorization form must be approved  by the IRB and Privacy Board (IRB/PB).  
The consent indicates  that individualized de identified information  collected  for the 
purposes of this study may be shared with other qualified researchers. Only 
researchers who have received approval from MSK will be allowed to access this 
information which will not include protected health information, such as the 
participant’s  name, except  for dates.  It is also stated  in the Research  Authorization 
that their research  data may be shared  with others  at the time of study  publication.  
 
16.2 Data  Management  
Data forms will be developed for recording all information pertinent to the 
observations  and tests  described  in this protocol.  All study  data will be collected  by an 
assigned data manager who will enter this information into MSK Medidata in a timely 
and ac curate manner. All data and forms gathered for this study will be collected and 
stored in a secure location in facilities of the Dermatology Service. Regular meetings 
attended by the data manager and the Principal Investigators will be held to review 
study  progress and to manage any difficulties encountered.  
The data manager  will collect  toxicity  and self-reported  compliance  data via patient’s 
diaries and patient interviews. Adverse events, including all toxic effects related to 
treatment will be recorded i ndividually according to toxicity date.  
 
All clinical  photographs  will be maintained  in digital  format  in a computerized  archive 
(DermagraphixTM). This system labels each clinical photograph with study subject 
MRN, lesion number, and photograph date.  
All patient data and questionnaires will be accessed on the Health Information 
System  (HIS)  and Mirror  Dermagraphix  database,  which  are password  protected  with 
user level access. All the data will be entered and maintained in MSK Medidata.  
 
Estimated  time of accrual:  6 months 
Accrual Rate: 4 patients per month

 Final  data sets for publication  are required  to be locked  and stored  centrally  for 
potential future access requests from outside entities.  
16.3 Quality  Assurance  
Study personnel will generate monthly registration reports to monitor patient accrual 
and completeness  of registration  data.  Routine  data quality  reports will be generated 
to access missing data and inconsistencies. Accrual rates, extent and accuracy of 
evaluations and follow -up will be monitored periodically throughout the study period 
and potential problems will be brought to the attention of the stud y team for 
discussion and action.  
 
Data  quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted  by the study  team  on a 
regular basis throughout the study period.  
16.4 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
The Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Plan utilized  for this study  must  align  with the MSK  
DSM Plan , where applicable.  
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan Kettering were 
approved  by the National  Cancer  Institute  in August  2018.  The plans  address  the new 
policies set forth by the NCI in the document entitled “ Policy of the National Cancer  
Institute for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials .” 
There are several different mechanisms by which clinical studies are monitored for 
data,  safety  and quality.  At a departme ntal/PI  level there  exists  procedures  for quality 
control  by the research  team(s).  Institutional  processes in  place  for quality  assurance 
include protocol monitoring, compliance and data verification audits, staff education 
on clinical research QA and two institutional committees that are responsible for 
monitoring the activities of our clinical trials programs. The committees: Data and 
Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) for Phase I and II clinical trials, and the Data 
and Safety Monitoring Board  (DSMB) for Phase  III clinical  trials,  report  to the Deputy 
Physician -in-Chief, Clinical Research.  
During  the protocol  development  and review process,  each  protocol  will be assessed 
for its level of risk and degree of monitoring required.  
The MSK  DSMB  monitors  phase  III trials  and the DSMC  monitors  non-phase  III trials. 
The DSMB/C have oversight over the following trials:  
• MSK  Investigator  Initiated  Trials  (IITs;  MSK  as sponsor)  
• External  studies  where  MSK  is the data coordinating  center  
• Low risk studies  identified  as requiring  DSMB/C  review  
The DSMC  will initiate  review  following  the enrollment  of the first participant/or  by the 
end of the year one if no accruals and will continue for the study lifecyle until there

 SYNOPSIS 
Name of Finished Product:  BTRX-335140 
Protocol Number:  K2-MDD-201 Phase of Development:  2a 
Protocol Title:  A Phase 2a, Randomized, Double-blind, Place bo-controlled Proof of Concept Study to 
Evaluate the Effects of Oral BTRX -335140 Versus Placebo in Subjects With Major Depressive Disorder 
Number of Planned Subjects:  Approximately 180 subjects randomized with treatment 
Study Sites:  Approximately 40 study centers in the United States (US) 
Duration of Study:  Approximately 24 months 
Study Objectives:  
Primary Objectives: 
To establish Proof of Concept (POC) for BTRX -335140, a kappa opioid receptor a ntagonist, by evaluating 
the impact of BTRX -335140 relative to placebo on symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adult 
subjects with MDD and symptoms of anhedonia and anxiety following 8 weeks of double- blind treatment as 
assessed by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) 
Secondary Objectives: 
1. To evaluate the effects of BTRX-335140 on self-rep orted anhedonia in adult subjects with MDD 
2. To evaluate the effects of BTRX-335140 on anxiety-related symptoms in adult subjects with MDD 
3. To evaluate the effects of BTRX-335140 on functio nal impairment in adult subjects with MDD 
4. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of BTRX-335140 in adult subjects with MDD 
Study Design: Study K2-MDD-201 is an 8-week, random ized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel -group, multicenter study to evaluate the effects of BTRX-335140 on symptoms of depression in 
adult subjects with MDD and symptoms of anhe donia and anxiety after 8 weeks of double- blind treatment. 
The study will consist of a 7 - to 28-day screening period, an 8- week active treatment period (during which 
subjects will receive either BTRX -335140 or placebo), and a 4-week Safety Follow-up period. 
Subjects will sign an informed cons ent form (ICF) and will then enter th e screening period to ensure they 
meet the required inclusion and exclusion criteria, incl uding diagnosis and stability of depressive symptoms 
and absenc e of psychiatric and medical conditions that wo uld preclude study participation. The 28-day 
screening period may be extended to 35  days (after consultation with and approval by the medical m onitor), 
if necessary, for r easons including, but are not limited to, discontinu ation of a subject’s  current inefficacious 
medications  or to obtain an ophthalmologic examination. 
In the event that an investigator requests to re -screen a subject that previously screen failed 
Study  K2-MDD-201, the medical monitor and Sponsor will consider allowing re-screening on a case-by- case 
basis.  
After eligibility is confirmed by the medical monit or, and before randomization,  baseline ophthalmologic 
examinations (standard and corneal specular microscopy) must be performed. Subject s who meet the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder s Fifth Edition (DSM5) diagnostic criteria for MDD 
and all other eligibility criteria for the study will be ra ndomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment arms 

 (placebo or BTRX 335140 once daily [QD]) until appr oximately 180 subjects are randomized. Beginning at 
Visit 2 (Baseline), subjects will receive treatment with BTRX -335140 80 mg QD or placebo for 8 weeks. 
During the Safety Follow -up, all subjects will receive a telephone call from study site personnel 
approximately 2 weeks after discontinuation of study drug for assessment of A Es, concomitant medication 
usage, and CSSRS; and at Week  12, subjects will have corneal specular microscopy performed by a study 
site affiliated ophthalmologist. The overall duration in the study for each subject is expected to be 
approximately 14 to 16  weeks. Additional ophthalmologic examinations (standard ophthalmologic exams 
and/or corneal specular microscopies) may be conducted to monitor subject safety.  
Possible Changes in Conduct of Study:  Study sites will maintain, at a minimum, coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID -19) risk mitigation procedures as per regulato ry and local guidelines and/or laws. Allowed 
modifications to the conduct of the study, i n the event of site staff and/or  patient restrictions due to 
COVID -19, are outlined in Appendix 1  to the protocol.

 All efficacy endpoints will also be summarized by visit, including change from baseline information. 
Statistical Methods:  All statistical comparisons will be made at a 2-sided alpha of 0.05. No adjustment for 
multiplicity is planned. SAS Version 9.4 or higher will be used to analyze data.  
Subject s will be analyzed according to  randomized treatment assignment for efficacy assessments and 
according to treatment received for safety assessments.  
Primary Efficacy Analysis:  The primary efficacy analysis is a comparison of mean reduction in HAMD-1 7 
scores between BTRX -335140 and placebo at Week 8. The analysis will be conducted using a Mixed-
Models Repeated Measures (MMRM) with change from baseline HAMD -17 score as the dependent variable 
and will include treatment group, Week, and Week by treatment  group interaction as factors, and baseline 
HAMD -17 score as covariate. Variance estimation will be ba sed on an unstructured covariance matrix. The 
model -based Week 8 least square (LS) means, standa rd errors, 95% confidence  intervals (CIs), and p-values 
will be reported . 
Secondary Efficacy Analysis: Comparisons between BTRX-335140 versus placebo for the change from 
baseline  in score at each timepoint assessed for the secondary endpoints will be conducted using MMRM  
analyses  as specified above or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), as appropriate. For CGI- I an additional 
analysis comparing the percentage of subjects with responses of ‘ much improved’ or ‘very much improved’  
at each timepoint between BTRX-335140 and placebo will be performed using generalized estimating 
equations (GEE) . Response rates for decrease in HAMD-17 (e.g., the percentage of subjects with ≥ 50% 
decrease in HAMD -17 from baseline to Week 4 and Week 8) will be compared between BTRX- 335140 and 
placebo using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests.  
Safety Analyses: Safety data, including AEs, safety laboratory results, physical examination results, vital 
signs,  suicidality, COWS scores, ECGs, and ophthalmologic examination findings will be summarized by 
treatment group and/or listed.

a Study site personnel will contact subjects by telephone for Safety Follow-up assessments (adverse events, concomitant 
medication usage, and C-SSRS) approximately 2 weeks after discontinuation of study drug. 
b Visit 1 procedures may be completed over 2 days, if necessary. 
c Subjects who discontinue early will complete an EOT visit <2 days after their last dose of study drug; efficacy assessments are to be performed only if the subject has remained on study drug. For subjects who do not return, the site should complete a C-SSRS if they are aware of a poten tial suicide-related thought or behavior by other 
communications. The 12-week corneal specular microscopy examination should still be conducted approximately 12 weeks after the first dose of study drug (Section 7.7.2 ).  
d Inclusion/exclusion criteria must be reconfirmed for eligibility prior to randomization. 
e Collect vital signs measurements (respiratory rate first, then blood pressure and pulse) after subject has been supine for 
10 minutes; subjects should then stand for 3 minutes befo re obtaining standing vital signs measurements [see 
Section 6.3.4 ]. Oral temperature can be assessed in any position. 
f A full physical examination involving an evaluation of cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological 
(examination of cranial nerves, motor system, sensory, and re flexes), dermatological, and musculoskeletal systems, and 
include general appearance, skin, head, neck, eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, 
extremities, and vascular status will be conducted at the scr eening visit. Further physical examination will be conducted 
as needed. ( Section 6.3.3 ). 
g At Screening, collect height for BMI calculation. 
h Ophthalmologic examinations will be performed by a s ite-affiliated ophthalmologist. Details for the standard 
ophthalmologic examination and corneal specular microscopy will be described in a separate ocular monitoring manual.  Additional standard ophthalmologic exams and / or corneal specular microscopies may be conducted to assess 
subject

n Unscheduled hepatic monitoring testing may be performed at any time on the basis of clinical laboratory testing results, after consultation with the Sponsor-designated medical monitor (see Section 6.3.2.2 ). 
o The C-SSRS Baseline version will be used at Screening and “Since Last Visit ” version will be used for all subsequent 
visits. 
p Adverse events reported before first dose of study drug to be recorded as medical history. Serious AEs will be recorded on the AE eCRF from the time of informed consent.  
q Subjects will be instructed to take their study drug daily in the morning and preferably with food. 
r Subjects will take their first dose of study drug (BTRX-335140 or placebo) under the supervision of clinical study personnel during the baseline visit. 
s  
t The Week 12 corneal specular microscopy should be completed for all subjects (ie, completers and early termination) 
unless consent is withdrawn. The corneal specular microscopy should be conducted approximately 12 weeks after the 
first dose of study drug; exceptions to be discussed with the medical monitor.

 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background Information 
1.1.1 Major Depressive Disorder 
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most common mood disorder and imposes 
considerable economic and humanitarian suffering, such as decreased quality of life, functional impairment, and increased mortality rate. Currently, MDD is the leading cause of disability and afflicts approximately 322 million people worldwide (4.4% of the global population), with prevalence increasing 18% between 2005 and 2015 ( World Health 
Organization [WHO] 2017 ). By 2020, depressive disorders ar e expected to be the second 
highest cause of morbidity in the world ( Murray and Lopez 2006 ) and have been predicted to 
become the leading cause of disease burden by the year 2030 ( WHO 2004 ). The lifetime 
prevalence of MDD is approximately 16.6% in the United States (US) ( Kessler et al 2003 ). 
Episodes of MDD are often chronic and recurrent, with a relapse chance rate of 55% to 90% for individuals who experienced one or two prior depressions. More than 80% of the individuals who experience a second episode and who are not treated will experience a third 
episode within 3 years ( Thase and Sullivan 1995 ). 
A clinical diagnosis of MDD is made based on the continuous presence of at least 5 of 9 symptoms over at least 2 weeks. One of these symptoms, as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5
th Edition (DSM-5), must be either depressed mood 
or anhedonia, which is defined as diminished in terest or pleasure in response to rewarding 
stimuli ( APA 2013 ). This diagnostic classification assigns equal importance to depressed 
mood and anhedonia thus highlighting anhedonia as a core feature of the disorder. The classification system also acknowledges that anhedonia may be present in a subset of individuals with MDD. Estimates of significant anhedonia among patients with MDD are rare; 1 report describes an anhedonia rate of approximately 37% among a sample of 
65 individuals diagnosed with MDD ( Pelizza and Ferrari 2009 ). Moreover, published data 
indicate that the presence of anhedonia may represent a distinct physiologically based subset of patients with MDD, as evidence from functional neuroimaging assessments indicates that anhedonia is linked to disruptions in central reward system functioning and is an important aspect of depression pathophysiology ( Keedwell et al 2005 ). This is an important finding 
from the standpoint of therapeutic interventions because the presence of anhedonic symptoms has been found to be associated with poorer longitudinal symptom progression among patients with depression ( Morris et al 2009 ) and is a major predictor of suicide 
(Fawcett et al 1990 ; Winer et al 2014 ). 
1.1.2 Treatments 
The current mainstays of pharmacological tr eatments for depression include the use of 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) ( Fava et al 2007 ; Zupancic and Guilleminault 
2006) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) ( Stahl et al 2005 ), which 
provide reasonable treatment options; however, these therapies are not effective in all 
patients, and are often associated with undesira ble side effects, such as weight gain and 
sexual dysfunction. The lack of efficacy and the adverse events (AEs) associated with the use 

 of these antidepressants lead to high  levels of treatment discontinuation ( Zajecka 2000 ). Even 
with multiple consecutive treatments, only a small proportion of patients remain 
asymptomatic ( Rush 2007 ). Thus, there continues to be a s ubstantial unmet medical need for 
new antidepressants with greater response rates and improved tolerability. 
The presence of anhedonia is associated with difficulty in treating MDD. Research findings 
indicate that available therapies such as SSRI s do not target depression-related motivational 
and reward-processing deficits sufficiently ( APA 2000 ; Dunlop and Nemeroff 2007 ; McCabe 
et al 2010 ; Nutt et al 2007 ; Price et al 2009; Shelton and Tomarken 2001 ) and that anhedonic 
symptoms predict inadequate treatment response ( Spijker et al 2001 ). 
The presence of anhedonia is associated with in adequate treatment response to antidepressant 
drugs ( McMakin et al 2012 ; Uher et al 2012 ) and potentially also to psychological treatments 
(Craske et al 2016 ). Unfortunately, research findings indicate that available therapies such as 
SSRIs do not target depression-related moti vational and reward-processing deficits 
sufficiently ( APA 2000 ; Dunlop and Nemeroff 2007 ; McCabe et al 2010 ; Nutt et al 2007 ; 
Price et al 2009 ; Shelton and Tomarken 2001 ). For these reasons, recent efforts have been 
directed towards developing therapies that effectively target anhedonia, such as ketamine and Positive Affect Treatment ( Craske et al 2016;  Lally et al 2014 ). 
1.1.3 BTRX-335140 
BTRX-335140 is a selective kappa opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist that is being evaluated 
for the treatment of neurobehavioral disorders. Re search studies carried out in animals and a 
proof of mechanism study carried out in humans suggest that medications which block KORs 
have the potential for being effective new treatments for patients with mood and anxiety 
spectrum disorders (Krystal et al 2020 ). The KOR system is an important mediator of the 
negative effects of stress-induced alterations  on mood, emotional regulation, and motivation. 
This system has been a target for drug development in neurobehavioral disorders where 
dysregulation of stress signaling is associated with increased vulnerabilities. It is thought that KOR antagonists may improve anhedonia and redu ce the vulnerabilities associated with 
stress. 
In laboratory animals, stress or repeated exposure to drugs of abuse triggers intracellular 
events involving cAMP response binding protein (CREB) in the nucleus accumbens – an 
area of the mesolimbic dopamine system known to be involved in reward and motivation (Carlezon and Krystal 2016 ). This increased CREB activity leads to elevated expression of 
the opioid peptide dynorphin ( Bruchas et al 2009 ), which in preclinical models causes core 
symptoms of depression and anxiety. In preclinical models of depression and anxiety such as the forced swim test or tail suspension test, KOR antagonism blocks the biochemical and behavioral response to stress, leading to antid epressant and anxiolytic behavioral effects 
(Carlezon and Krystal 2016 ). In preclinical studies of addiction behavior, KOR antagonists 
prevent stress-induced drug-seeking behavior ( Beardsley et al 2005). 
In humans, KOR agonists, including the plant-derived Salvinorin A, have been reported to 
trigger symptoms of dysphoria and anxiety ( Pfeiffer et al 1986 ; W
 alsh et al 2001 ) suggesting 

 that antagonists may play a beneficial role in the treatment of anxiety disorders and 
anhedonic symptoms in depression. 
In the recently completed NIMH FAST-MAS Phase 2 Proof of concept (POC) study, patients 
with mood and anxiety disorders (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision [DSM-IV-TR] d iagnostic criteria for: MDD, Bipolar 1 or 2 
Depressed, Generalized Anxiety Disorder [GAD], Social Phobia, Panic Disorder, or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder [PTSD]) who had high levels of anhedonia (Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale [SHAPS] >20) were treated w ith a KOR antagonist (KORA) or placebo for 
8 weeks. In that study, the group receiving the KORA treatment showed greater ventral striatal activation (a neural target related to hedonic response) during anticipation of both gain and loss during an incentivized test of working memory as well as a significant improvement in their anhedonia score as evaluate d by the SHAPS compared to those patients 
who received placebo ( Krystal et al 2020 ). 
Nonclinical studies indicate that the risk for cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous 
system (CNS) AEs in the BTRX-335140 clinical program is low. Body weight loss or decreased body weight gain associated with decreased food intake was observed across species tested. BTRX-335140 was nonmutagenic in in vitro  Ames and chromosomal 
mutation assays. 
 
 
 Ocular phototoxicity (corneal edema), with confirming 
histopathologic findings was observed at the 100 mg/kg/day dose.  
 
 
No phototoxicity was noted in the 
retina or any other ocular structure at any dose level. 
BTRX-335140 is orally bioavailable across animal species studied. BTRX-335140 is a 
 
 
Based on nonclinical studies, BTRX-335140 is not anticipated to significantly inhibit or 
induce at concentrations relevant in vivo.  
 
The first-in-human Phase 1 study in healthy adult subjects evaluated single and multiple 
ascending doses of BTRX335140. Treatment with BTRX-335140 exhibited a favorable 
pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, and BTRX-335140 was well tolerated. There were no deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), or subject disconti nuations due to AEs in this study. Overall, 
AEs were infrequent, and the majority of events were Grade 1 in intensity. In the multiple-dose phase, 13 (54%) subjects experienced a total of 42 treatment-emergent adverse 

 events (TEAEs) following BTRX-335140 administration, and all reported TEAEs in the 
multiple-dose phase were Grade 1 in severity. The most common events reported were pruritus and fatigue. Grade 1 pruritus was reported 4 times among 3 (13%) subjects overall, with 1 subject receiving 20 mg BTRX-335140 and 2 subjects receiving 160 mg BTRX-335140 daily for 10 days. A total of 3 (13%) subjects each experienced a single TEAE of Grade 1 fatigue, including 2 subjects who received 80 mg BTRX-335140 and 1 subject who received 160 mg BTRX-335140 daily for 10 days. All remaining AEs were reported by 2 or fewer subjects each in both the single- and multiple-dose phases. Following multiple-dose administration of BTRX-335140, the following AEs were considered at least possibly related to the study treatment: abnormal dreams (40 mg and 80 mg), fatigue (80 mg and 160 mg), headache (80 mg and 160 mg), sleep disorder (40 mg), asthenia, chills, dizziness, nausea, somnolence (80 mg), generalized pruritus, macular rash, tremor (160 mg), and papule (placebo). Overall, there were no remarkable findings in the remaining safety 
assessments in the study for clinical laboratory parameters, vital sign measurements, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, and Columb ia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) 
scores. Overall, safety findings were comparable for BTRX-335140 and placebo and there 
were no trends observed in safety data with  respect to ascending single and multiple 
BTRX-335140 doses. 
 
After 
10 da
ys of once-daily oral dosing, some accumulation (up to 3.9-fold for AUC and up to 
4.6-fold for C max exposures) of BTRX-335140 in plasma is observed and steady state is 
reached by Day 10. The administration of a high -fat diet with BTRX-335140 resulted in an 
increase in exposure by 17% (AUC) and 12% (C max) compared to fasted conditions. 
The second Phase 1 study used positron emission tomography (PET) imaging study in healthy adult males to assess KOR Occupancy in the human brain using the radiotracer [
11C]LY2795050 following single ascending oral doses of BTRX-335140 showed tracer 
uptake was reduced by treatment with BTRX-335140, and the relationship between KOR Occupancy and BTRX-335140 concentration was IC
50 = 9.85 ±1.40 ng/mL. 
1.2 Rationale for Study Design, Doses, and Control Groups 
The current study is the first Phase 2 study designed to establish POC for BTRX-335140 by evaluating the impact of treatment with BTRX-335140 relative to treatment with matching placebo on symptoms of MDD in adult patients. 
The randomization, study drug blinding, and placebo controls will serve to minimize the 
chance of bias in the implementation and execution of the study. Randomization to treatment assignment reduces the likelihood that results will reflect selection bias. Having both 
investigators and subjects blinded to treatment assignment (double-blind) controls for expectation bias relative to any particular treatment condition. A placebo group is included to control the subject and investigator expectati ons of improvement during the study that could 
confound interpretation of pharmacological effects of treatment.  

 Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are the standard in assessment of efficacy in 
randomized clinical studies evaluating subjects with conditions such as MDD. There have 
been estimates of placebo response rates in MDD clinical studies between 30% and 50% therefore it is important to use a placebo comparator despite the risk of a possible worsening of symptoms. Certain factors are associated w ith improvement in placebo-treated subjects. 
These include therapeutic effects secondary to interaction with a medical professional, misdiagnosis of the psychiatric disorder, clinicians overestimating baseline symptom severity or symptom change, and regression to the mean in subjects who began the study with more severe symptoms of illness ( Fava et al 2003 ). 
A starting dose of 80 mg of BTRX-335140 was selected for this study on the basis of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling from the PK and PET receptor occupancy (RO) studies that indicates that this dose should provide approximately 80 –90% RO at steady 
state. The study dose of 80 mg BTRX 335140 as well as a higher dose of 160 mg have been given once daily (QD) for 10 consecutive days and was well-tolerated in healthy subjects 
(Study K2-ADS-101). Pharmacokinetics of a single 80 mg dose were similar under fed and 
fasted conditions. The brain KOR occupancy of a single 160 mg dose of BTRX-335140 is approximately 90% (Study K2-HV-102). Human PK modeling based on drug exposure levels in Study K2-ADS-101 indicates that this same le vel of occupancy will be achieved with an 
80-mg daily dose at steady state. This occupancy level is projected to be sufficient to produce a KORA mechanism-based effect in an MDD population. 

3.1 Description of Study Design
Study K2-MDD-201 is an 8-week, random ized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, multicenter study to evaluate the effects of BTRX-335140 on symptoms of 
depression in adult subjects with MDD a nd symptoms of anhedonia and anxiety after 
8 weeks of double-blind treatment. The study will consist of a 7- to 28-day screening period, an 8-week active treatment period (during which subjects will receive either BTRX-335140 or placebo), and a 4-week Sa fety Follow-up period ( Figure 1 ).
Figure 1: Study Design
OE = ophthalmologic examinations; TC = telephone contact; Wk = Week.
Note: To reduce subject burden, subjects may be allo wed to perform 1 virtual visit at Week 2 (Visit 3), 4
(Visit 4), or 6 (Visit 5). Virtual visits will be pe rformed according to procedures specified in Appendix 1.
Subjects will sign an informed consent form (ICF) and will then enter the screening period to 
ensure they meet the required inclusion and exclusion criteria, including diagnosis and stability of depressive symptoms and absence of psychiatric and medical conditions that would preclude study participation. The 28-day screening period may be extended up to a maximum of 35 days (after consultation with a nd approval by the medical monitor), if 
necessary, for reasons including, but are not limited to, discontinu ation of a subject’s current 
inefficacious medications or to obtain an ophthalmologic examination. Some of the 
enrollment criteria in this study are base d on analyses of depression data by BlackThorn
using explainable artificial intelligence to i nform about predictors of response to a KORA. 
Sites will be provided with a tablet computer preprogramed with an algorithm to confirm 
subject eligibility on the clinical assessment scales. In addition, for those subjects who are deemed to meet eligibility criteria, data will be requested to allow review by the medical monitor and the Clinical Assessment Technol ogy (CAT) team to monitor data quality, and 
the ophthalmologic examinations (standard ophthalmologic and corneal specular 
microscopy) will be performed prior to randomization.

 In the event that an investigator requests to re-screen a subject that previously screen failed 
Study K2-MDD-201, the medical monitor and Sponsor will consider allowing re-screening on a case-by-case basis. 
Subjects who meet the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for MDD and all other eligibility criteria 
for the study will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment arms (placebo or 
BTRX-335140 QD) until approximately 180 subjects are randomized. Beginning at Visit 2 (Baseline), subjects will receive treatmen t with BTRX-335140 80 mg QD or placebo for 
8 weeks. During the Safety Follow-up, all s ubjects will receive a tele phone call (TC) from 
study site personnel approximately 2 week s after discontinuation of study drug for 
assessment of AEs, concomitant medication usage, and C-SSRS; and at Week 12, subjects will have corneal specular microscopy perform ed by a study site-affiliated ophthalmologist. 
The overall duration in the study for each subj ect is expected to be approximately 14 to 
16 weeks
.  
 
The Week 12 corneal specular microscopy should be completed for all subjects (ie, 
completers and early termination) unless consent is withdrawn. The corneal specular microscopy should be conducted approximately 12 weeks after the first dose of study drug; subjects who terminate the study early would need to plan for the corneal specular microscopy at 12 weeks after the first dose of st udy drug. Any exceptions are to be discussed 
with the medical monitor.  
 
Additional ophthalmologic examinations  (standard ophthalmologic exams and/or corneal 
specular microscopies) may be condu cted to assess subject safety.  
 
Details of study procedures and assessments are provided in Section 6 ; for details on the 
timings of study assessments refer to Section 7  and the Schedule of Procedures and 
Assessments . 
Study sites will maintain, at a minimum, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) risk 
mitigation procedures as per regulatory and local guidelines and/or laws. Allowed modifications to the conduct of the study, in the event of site staff and/or patient restrictions due to COVID-19, are outlined in Appendix 1.

glaucoma). Note: The following ocular disorders are allowed: cataracts, prior cataract surgery, glaucoma (narrow angle glaucoma is allowed if definitively  treated with laser 
peripheral iridectomy), macular degeneration, or ocular changes associated with diabetes 
mellitus or multiple sclerosis. 
4.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment 
Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and are subsequently not excluded by the exclusion criteria will be randomized to double-blind treatment at Visit 2 (Baseline) using an interactive web-response system (IWRS). Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment arms (placebo or BTRX-335140 QD). 
The IWRS will be used to assign bottles containing double-blind study drug or placebo to 
each subject. Further details will be provided in the Pharmacy manual. 
4.3 Blinding 
This is a double-blind study. Subjects, site personnel, and the Sponsor will be blinded to 
treatment. In the event there is a safety emergency, the investigator is requested, where 
possible, to contact the medical monitor or the Sponsor before unblinding; however, if there 
is insufficient time to do so, the investigator may perform emergency unblinding for SAEs through the IWRS as described in Section 8.1.2 . 
4.4 Subject Withdrawal 
A subject’s participation in this study is voluntary , and the subject may refuse to participate 
or withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. The investigator also has the right to 
withdraw a subject from the study for any reason. The investigator should make a reasonable effort to ascertain the primary reason for withdrawal and document that reason in the electronic case report form (eCRF). 
Possible reasons for early discontinuation are as follows: 
• Investigator/physician decision 
- The investigator/physician decides that the subject should be withdrawn from the 
study for any reason, eg, the subject is significantly noncompliant with the study drug regimen (see Section 5.5 ; subjects with study drug compliance ≤70% over any 
2-week visit interval). 
- After Visit 2 (Baseline), the subject is found to have met an exclusionary criterion or 
not met an entry criterion required for study participation. 
- The subject is enrolled in any other clinical study involving an investigational product or is enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or 
medically compatible with this study. 

Confidential Page 37 of 88 
 • Subject Decision 
- The subject requests to be withdrawn from the study for any reason. If the reason to 
request withdrawal is an AE this should be documented as the primary reason for 
discontinuation. 
• Sponsor Decision  
- An investigator, site personnel performing assessments, or subject is unblinded (see 
Section 4.3 ). 
• Adverse Event  - The subject experiences an AE that would necessitate discontinuation of study drug. 
Any subject who is discontinued from study drug due to AEs or clinically significant 
laboratory abnormalities will be followed unt il resolution or clinical stabilization. If 
this decision is made because of an SAE or a clinically significant laboratory value, the study drug is to be discontinued and appropriate measures are to be taken. The Sponsor or its medical monitor designee  is to be alerted immediately (see 
Section 8.5.1 ). 
- Discontinuation should be considered by the investigator after consultation with the 
Sponsor or its medical monitor designee when a subject has the following clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory findings: 
◦ ALT or AST >8 x ULN 
◦ ALT or AST >5 x ULN for more than 2 consecutive weeks 
◦ ALT or AST >3 x ULN and total bilirubin level >2 x ULN 
◦ ALT or AST >3 x ULN and prothrombin time (or INR) >1.5 x ULN 
◦ ALT or AST >3 x ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper-quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5 %). 
- If the subject is thought to be at risk of harm to him/herself or others at any time 
during the study, a further psychiatric assessment by the investigator must be conducted. This includes subjects who score 3 or above on item 11 of the HAMD-17. Subjects must be discontinued from st udy participation and offered appropriate 
treatment and care if they:  
◦ are assessed as homicidal 
◦ are actively suicidal (any suicidal ideation with intent or specific plan or any 
suicide attempt) or at serious suicidal risk 
◦ if suicidal gestures are present  
- Any subject who is found to be dependent on, or abusing opioids, should be withdrawn from the study and provided with appropriate medical care. If at any time during the study a score of 5 or more is obtained on the COWS, the investigator (or designee) must determine if the subject is experiencing opioid withdrawal (see Section 6.3.8 ). 
- The investigator remains responsible for following, through an appropriate healthcare option, AEs that caused the subject  to discontinue study drug.

 - If the investigator determines that a subject requires treatment with another 
therapeutic agent for MDD and that this alternative treatment cannot be safely 
delayed until completion of the current study, discontinuation from the study will 
occur prior to introduction of the new agent. 
• Loss to Follow-Up 
- For subjects who are lost to follow-up, all steps performed to contact them (dates of 
telephone calls, registered letters, etc.) will be documented in the source documents. The investigators are required to make at least 3 attempts to contact the subject for a follow-up safety visit.  
• Pregnancy 
- Study drug treatment will be discontinued for female subjects who become pregnant 
during study. See Section 8.5.4  for additional information. 
• Other Reasons 
- If a subject misses, or is expected to miss , more than 1 sequential clinic visit, the 
investigator must contact the medical monitor to discuss continuation in the study. If 
it is determined that the subject must be discontinued the reason for termination, 
eg, termination related to COVID-19, must be documented as such in EDC (see Appendix 1). 
4.5 Early Termination of Subjects From the Study 
For subjects who discontinue study drug, every attempt should be made to complete the End-of-Treatment Visit assessments within 2 days after their last dose of study drug 
(Section 7.8 ). The 12-week corneal specular micro scopy examination should be completed 
for subjects who discontinue participation in the study unless consent for this safety procedure is withdrawn. The corneal specular microscopy should be conducted approximately 12 weeks after the first dose of study drug; exceptions are to be discussed with the medical monitor.  
 
Additional ophthalmologic examinations (standard ophthalmologic exams and/or corneal 
specular microscopies) may be condu cted to monitor subject safety.

 5.5 Study Drug Compliance 
Each subject will be instructed to return all study drug packaging and unused material to the 
study site at each visit. The study site will keep a record of all drug dispensed to and returned 
by the subjects throughout the study.  
Subject compliance with BTRX-335140 or placebo will be assessed by direct questioning 
and counting of returned capsules. For subjects who demonstrate noncompliance (s ubject has taken <80% of the prescribed 
dosage for a visit interval), investigative sites must counsel subjects on the importance of 
study drug compliance. Any missed study drug or extra dose of study drug will be recorded as a protocol deviation.  
Subjects with study drug (BTRX-335140 or placebo) compliance ≤70% over any 2-week 
visit interval (beginning with the Visit 2 [Baseline] to Visit 3 [Week 2] interval) will require 
early discontinuation. 
5.6 Study Drug Accountability 
The study drug provided for this study will be used only as directed in the study protocol. In 
accordance with current Good Clinical Practi ce (cGCP), investigators are required to 
maintain accurate and up-to-date records of all study drugs to permit reconciliation. The 
investigator or designee must maintain adequate records of distribution, including the date 
received, number and units received, manufacturer, lot numbers, dispensing, and return or 
destruction of all study drug (ie, accountability or dispensing logs). 
All study drug records must be up to date and accurate for inspection by the site’s clinical 
monitor and/or auditor. Instructions for returns, disposal, or destruction will be provided in 
the study reference manual and/or pharmacy manual. 
If there are any issues during the course of the study related to the quality of the study drug, 
the investigator, clinical site pharmacist or phar macy designee should contact the Sponsor or 
designated Contract Research Organization (CRO).

 6 STUDY PROCEDURES AND ASSESSMENTS 
Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the Schedule of Procedures and 
Assessments . Investigator/clinician-rated scales and tasks will be completed and/or 
administered by qualified and trained site raters who meet the training requirements and 
qualifications of the scale or task standards set by the Sponsor and training vendors. 
Subject-rated assessments will be recorded using a tablet computer. The SCID and COWS 
are not included on the tablet; they are available only in paper form.  
Rater consistency is critical in assessing the HAM-D, HAM-A, CGI-S, and CGI-I. Therefore, 
every attempt should be made, where possible, to have the same rater assess the subject at each visit to provide consistency in these ratings. It is important that the site strives to maintain rater consistency for the primary endpoint, the HAM-D. The CGI-S and CGI-I rater 
should also be the same rater and should take into account all available information in the 
assessment, particularly when the CGI rater is not rating the HAM-D and/or HAM-A. 
6.1 Medical History and Demographics 
Medical history and demographics will be collec ted at Screening and will be reviewed at the 
baseline visit. 
6.1.1 Medical History 
A complete medical history will be obtained at  screening and will be reviewed prior to 
randomization to ensure subjects qualify for the study. Confirmation of the subject’s MDD 
will also be obtained. 
Psychiatric history (including a lifetime hist ory of substance or alcohol abuse or dependence) 
will be assessed using the SCID-5-CT. The SCID-5-CT will be completed by qualified and 
trained investigator site raters. The interview begins with an overview section, which is 
abridged to entail questions relevant to the current clinical study. 
Ophthalmologic history will be obtained at scr eening to assess general ocular disorders and 
specifically whether the subject has any of the following exclusionary conditions: 1) useful 
vision in only 1 eye from a pre-existing opht halmic disease or amblyopia; 2) a corneal 
transplant in either eye; 3) corneal dystrophy or family history of corneal dystrophy; 4) 
severe dry eye syndrome [keratitis sicca]; or 5) history of severe adverse reaction to 
mydriatic agents. If a subject has narrow angle glaucoma, then there must be confirmation of 
definitive treatment with laser iridectomy as verified by the subject’s ophthalmologist  in 
order to be enrolled. 
Nonserious AEs reported before the first dose of study drug will be recorded as medical 
history. 
6.1.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic information and base line characteristics collected  at Screening will include 
age, sex, race, ethnicity, height, weight, and BMI. 

 6.2 Efficacy Assessments 
6.2.1 Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression – 17-item Version 
The HAM-D 17-item version ( Hamilton 1967 ) will be the primary endpoint to evaluate 
changes in depression severity with treatment. This interviewer-admin istered semi-structured 
interview (Structured Interview Guide for th e Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [SIGH-D], 
Williams 1988 ) is one of the most widely used instruments in depression treatment studies 
and its reliability and validity has been ex tensively studied. The HAMD-17 scoring ranges 
from 0 to 52 with individual items ranging from 0-4 points and 0-2 points to capture 
symptom severity. The HAMD-17 is validated  for videoconference and telephone assessment 
(Kobak et al 2008 ). 
6.2.2 Snaith Hamilton Pleasure Scale 
The SHAPS is a 14-item self-report instrument which measures anhedonia ( Snaith et al 
1995). It has been shown to be valid and reliable in normal and clinical samples, with adequate construct validity, satisfactory tes t-retest reliability (intraclass correlation 
coefficient [ICC] = 0.70), and high internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha of 0.94) ( Franken 
et al 2007 ). The scale will be completed by the subject and reviewed by site personnel 
qualified to oversee completeness. Each of the 14 items has a set of 4 responses, 2 of which endorse agreement (Definitely Agree, Agree) and 2 of which endorse disagreement (Disagree, Strongly Disagree). A total score can be derived by summing the responses items answered with strongly agree are coded as 1 while  a strongly disagree response will be coded 
as 4. Therefore, scores on the SHAPS can range from 14 to 56, with higher scores 
corresponding to higher levels of anhedonia. 
6.2.3 Clinical Global Impression Scale – Severity 
The CGI-S is a clinician-rated instrument that measures the severity of depression at the time 
of assessment. This rating is based upon obs erved and reported symptoms, behavior, and 
function in the past 7 days. The score should reflect the average severity level across the 7 days. The CGI-S is scored on a 7-point scale where a score of 1 indicates that the subject is “normal, not at all ill” a score of 4 indicates that the subject is “moderately ill,” and a sc ore 
of 7 indicates that the subject is “among the most extremely ill subjects” ( Guy 1976 ). 
6.2.4 Clinical Global Impression Scale – Improvement 
The CGI-I scale ( Guy 1976 ) is a clinician-rated instrument that measures the improvement of 
the subject ’s symptoms. It is a 7 -point scale where a score of 1 indicates that the subject is 
“very much improved,” a score of 4 indicates that the subject has experienced “no change,” 
and a score of 7 indicates that the subject is “very much worse.”  
6.2.5 Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale 
The HAM-A is administered to assess severity of anxiety, its improvement during the course 
of treatment, and the timing of such improvement ( Hamilton 1960 ). This instrument will be 
completed by qualified and trained investig ator site raters based on a semi-structured 

 interview (Structured Interview Guide for th e Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [SIGH-A], 
Williams 1988 ) his/her assessment of the subject. The scale consists of 14 items. Each item is 
rated on a scale of 0 (feeling not present) to 4 (very severe prevalence of the feeling). The 
HAM-A total score is the sum of the 14 items and the score ranges from 0 to 56. 
6.2.7 Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
The HADS measures levels of anxiety and depression without regards to somatic symptoms 
(Zigmond and Snaith 1983 ). This self-report scale consists  of 14 items. Seven of the items 
are used to evaluate anxiety and 7 evaluate depression. Each item on the questionnaire is 
scored from 0 to 3. Therefore, the anxiety subscale (HADS-A) and the depression subscale (HADS-D) each range from 0 to 21. Higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety and 
depression, respectively. 
6.2.9 Sheehan Disability Scale 
The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) was de veloped to assess functional impairment in 
3 related domains of work/school, social, and family life. It is a brief self-rated tool where the 
subject rates the 3 items on an anchored  10-point visual analogue scale ( Sheehan 1983). 
Following the subject’s self -assessment, the rater should review the Work/School and Days 
Lost items to confirm appropriateness of the selected rating by evaluating the impact of MDD symptoms across those sectors. SDS may be administered via telephone assessment; 
however, the subject must be provided with a portable document format (PDF) copy of the assessment for reference of the visual analogue scale when selecting their ratings. 

 6.3 Safe
ty Assessments 
6.3.1 Adverse Events 
All AEs will be evaluated from the time th e subject provides written informed consent 
through the last Safety Follow-up TC. Nonseri ous AEs reported before the first dose of study 
drug will be recorded as medical history (see Section 6.1.1). Serious AEs will be recorded on 
the AE eCRF from the time of informed cons ent. Additional safety information, including 
the definition of an AE/SAE/AESI and reporting requirements is provided in Section 8 . 
Clinically significant findings for laboratory results, vital signs, ECGs, ophthalmologic 
examinations, and abnormal physical examination should be recorded as AEs; a clinical diagnosis, rather than the changes in labor atory analyte or other assessment should be 
recorded. 
6.3.2 Clinical Laboratory Tests 
6.3.2.1 Sample Collections 
A central laboratory will be used for safety laboratory tests. Standard clinical laboratory tests 
will be performed at times specified in the Schedule of Procedures and Assessments . Repeat 
testing of samples may be permitted during sc reening, after review and approval by the 
medical monitor. 
Abnormal laboratory values will be graded by the investigator as “clinically significant”  or 
“not clinically significant ,” where applicable. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory 

 values will be reported as AEs as per Section 6.3.1  above). Investigators may repeat 
laboratory tests for any parameter that is abnormal and/or clinically significant. 
Samples collected for safety laboratory tests wi ll be destroyed within 60 days of receipt of 
confirmed test results. Tests are run and c onfirmed promptly whenever scientifically 
appropriate. When scientific circumstances warrant, however, it is acceptable to retain 
samples to batch the tests run, or to retain the sa mples until the end of the study to confirm 
that the results are valid. Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to 
comply with applicable laws, regulations , or laboratory certification standards.

6.3.2.2 Hepatic Safety and Enha nced Hepatic Testing 
Bilirubin, ALT, and AST will be measured at each  scheduled visit (as part of the scheduled 
clinical laboratory tests). If a subject has elev ated ALT or AST (>3 x ULN) or elevated total 
bilirubin (>2 x ULN), the following procedures must be performed: 
1. Contact the medical monitor/Sponsor to assess whether the subject should be 
discontinued from study drug (see Section 4.4 ). 
2. Perform clinical laboratory testing according to the list of hepatic monitoring tests in Table 3  within 48 to 72 hours. The frequency of re peat testing to be performed will be 
determined in consultation with the medica l monitor/Sponsor. In general, repeat 
laboratory testing should be performed 2 to 3 times per week; frequency of retesting can decrease to once a week or less if, the labora tory abnormality(ies) stabilizes and/or 
subject is asymptomatic. 
3. Provide additional history from the subject including: 
- history of concomitant medication (presc ription, nonprescription, over-the-counter, 
herbal supplements, dietary supplements) 
- alcohol use, recreational drug use, and special diets 
- recent illnesses, exposures, and exposure s to environmental chemical agents 
These results will be reviewed in a timel y fashion by the Sponsor-designated medical 
monitor, along with the subject ’s clinical case, to determine possible cause.  

6.3.2.3 Urine Drug Screen 
The urine drug screen for drugs of abuse will include amphetamines, barbiturates, 
benzodiazepines, THC, cocaine, opioids, phe ncyclidine, propoxyphene, and methadone. This 
test will be done at the site using the dip sticks provided as well as at the central laboratory. 
For occasional (1 to 2 times per month maximum) cannabis users only, 1 retest is allowed; a 
positive second test is exclusionary. 
The site must contact the Sponsor-designated medical monitor or designee for preapproval 
before a retest of drugs other than THC that presented  as positive; a retest will be permitted if 
the positive results can be explained by a valid pr escription, and if there is no evidence of a 
substance use disorder. If the results from an  allowed repeat urine drug screen prior to 
randomization are negative, the subject may be randomized. The investigator must be 
satisfied that the subject has been appropriately  counseled regarding the restrictions of study 
participation and that the subject intends to comply. If the repeat results are positive, the 
subject must be excluded from the stud y. A second retest is not admissible. 

 6.3.3 Physical Examinations 
A full physical examination will be performed at Screening and will include an evaluation of 
cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological (examination of cranial nerves, motor system, sensory, and reflexes), dermatological, and musculoskeletal systems and 
include general appearance, skin, head, neck, eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, 
back, lymph nodes, extremities, and vascular status. Additional physical examinations will be performed as needed. 
Height and weight will be measured during the study as indicated in the Schedule of 
Procedures and Assessments . Height should be measured only once at screening with no 
shoes for correct measurement. The BMI will  be calculated based on height measured at 
screening and weight measured at Visits 1, 2, 4, and 6. 
6.3.4 Vital Signs 
Vital signs (respiratory rate, blood pressure [BP], and pulse) will be measured at each visit 
throughout the screening and treatment periods of the study in supine and standing positions. 
Subjects should be supine for 10 minutes before vi tal signs (respiratory rate first, then BP and 
pulse) are measured (respiratory rate and pulse should be assessed for 30 seconds, then doubled to record breaths/minute and beats/minute, respectively). Subjects will then be asked 
to stand for 3 minutes prior to measurement of standing respiratory rate, BP, and pulse. Oral 
temperature can be measured in any position at each visit throughout the study. 
6.3.5 Electrocardiography 
For each subject, single 12-lead digital ECGs will be collected after the subject has rested for 
5 minutes. The ECGs will initially be interpreted by a qualified physician (the investigator or 
qualified designee) at the site as soon after  the time of ECG collection as possible, and 
ideally while the subject is still present, to determine whether the subject meets entry criteria at the relevant visit(s) and for immediate subject management, should any clinically relevant findings be identified.  
After enrollment, clinically significant increase s in the QTcF interval from baseline (eg, 
QTcF ≥500 msec and/or QTcF increased ≥60 msec) or other clinically significant 
quantitative or qualitative changes from baseline should be reported as AEs. The subject will 
be assessed by the investigator for symptoms (eg,  palpitations, near syncope, syncope) and to 
determine whether the subjec t can continue study drug. The investigator or qualified 
designee is responsible for determining if any change in subject management is needed and must document his/her review of the ECG prin ted at the time of evaluation for each time 
point.  
All digital ECGs will be electronically transmit ted to a designated central ECG laboratory. A 
cardiologist at the central ECG laboratory will then conduct a full over-read. A report based 
on data from this over-read will be issued to  the investigative site. All data from the 
over-reads will be placed in the Sponsor database for analytical and study report purposes. 
Any clinically significant finding that was present on the fully over-read ECG will be 
reported to the investigator and to the Sponsor. 

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 7 Date: 24Jan2022 
 
Confidential Page 51 of 88 
 The cardiologist’s ECG interpretation will be used for inclusion/exclusion determination for 
the screening ECG; the baseline ECG will be based on the investigator review and interpretation of the machine read for inclusion/exclusion determination at Visit 2 (Baseline). Exclusionary QT interval crit eria, corrected using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF), at Visit 1 
(Screening) or Visit 2 (Baseline), are QTcF >450 msec in males or >470 msec in females. In 
the event that the QTcF is greater than the specified cutoffs and the investigator (in consultation with the medical monitor) deter mines that additional ECGs may aid in the 
further evaluation to determine enrollment at either screening or baseline visits, triplicate ECGs may be obtained. The average of the triplicate QTcF values may be used to evaluate eligibility at screening or baseline. If the av erage exceeds the protocol-specified cutoff, then 
the subject is not eligible for enrollment. At  baseline, if central review subsequently 
determines the subject is not eligible by the cardiologist’s interpretation,  the subject must be 
bought in to discontinue. 
When there are differences in ECG interpretation between the investigator (or qualified 
designee) and the cardiologist at the central ECG laboratory, the investigator (or qualified 
designee) should consult with the cardiologist at the central ECG laboratory. The investigator 
(or qualified designee) will be responsible for the medical management of the subject. 
Interpretations from the cardiologist at the central ECG laboratory will be used for data 
analysis and report writing purposes.  
The investigator (or qualified designee) must doc ument his/her review of ECGs printed at the 
time of collection, the final over-read ECG report issued by the central ECG laboratory, and 
any alert reports. 
6.3.6 Ophthalmologic Examinations 
Ophthalmologic examinations will be conducted in this study as follows (further details will 
be described in an ophthalmologic examination manual): 
1. Standard ophthalmologic examinations: to include best corrected visual acuity 
assessment, slit-lamp examination of both eyes including assessment of intraocular pressure, as well as dilation of the pupils to examine the optic nerve and retina 
2. Corneal specular microscopy: noncontact or c ontact specular microscopy for qualitative 
and quantitative examination of the central c orneal endothelium (cell count, cell shape, 
density, and morphology), with image capture 
After confirmation that the subject has met all eligibility criteria, and is approved for 
randomization, the 2 examinations will be performed and will serve as baseline 
ophthalmologic examinations. The study site will refer the subject to an affiliated ophthalmologist. Ophthalmologic examinations will be conducted as per the Schedule of Procedures and Assessments  and Section 7 . Any ocular abnormalities at baseline should be 
recorded in medical history. Corneal specular mi croscopy results will be sent to a designated 
expert ophthalmology center for review and analysis. Additional examinations may be required in the event a subject has an ocular AESI (see Section 8.4 ). 

 Any subject who discontinues from the study earl y must return to the clinic for the follow-up 
ophthalmologic examinations 12 weeks from the start of study drug. 
6.3.7 Suicidal Ideation/Suicidality 
Suicide-related events (behavior and/or ideation) will be assessed and evaluated at every 
scheduled and unscheduled visit with the administration of the C-SSRS ( Posner 2007 ). The 
C-SSRS captures the occurrence, severity, a nd frequency of suicide-related thoughts and 
behaviors during the assessment period. The scale includes suggested questions to solicit the 
type of information needed to determine if a suicide-related thought or behavior occurred. The C-SSRS was developed by the Columbia group to prospectively categorize suicide-related events. The 2009 “Baseline” version will be used at Visit 1 ( Screening), 
evaluating past year and past 3 months, and the 2009 “Since Last Visit” version will be used 
for all subsequent visits. 
Subjects who score 3 or above on Item 11 of the HAMD-17 must be further evaluated to 
determine is they are at risk or harm to themselves or others (see Section 4.4 ). If a 
suicide-related event is identified at any time during the study, a thorough evaluation should 
be performed by the investigator or suitab ly qualified study physician and appropriate 
medical care provided. In some patients taking antidepressants, worsening of depression, suicidal events (suicidal thinking and/or behavi or), or unusual changes in  behavior have been 
reported, especially, at the beginning of the drug therapy, at the time of dose changes, or early after treatment discontinuati on. It is important that subjects are instructed to notify their 
doctor immediately if they have any distressing thoughts or feelings at any time related to harm to either self or others. 
6.3.8 Opiate Withdrawal 
Opiate withdrawal will be assessed at screening and at all subsequent treatment visits through 
Week 8 using the COWS. The COWS is a clin ician-administered instrument used to rate 
11 common opiate withdrawal signs or symptoms ( Wesson and Ling 2003 ). The total score 
of the 11 items will then be used to assess a subject ’s level of opiate withdrawal and to 
determine their level of physical dependence on opioids. This assessment provides an 
additional safeguard to ensure no subjects ar e enrolled with opiate withdrawal or for whom 
withdrawal may begin during the course of the study. 
The COWS will provide an ongoing assessment of subjects for any symptoms suggestive of 
opiate withdrawal. If at any time during the study, a score of 5 or more is obtained on the 
COWS, the investigator (or designee) must determine if the subject is experiencing opioid 
withdrawal. Any subject who is found to be  dependent on opioids, abusing opioids, or 
experiencing opioid withdrawal should be withdrawn from the study and provided with appropriate medical care. 

7.7 Safety Follow-up 
7.7.1 Telephone Call (Week 10) 
Subjects will receive a TC from the study site approximately 2 weeks after the last dose of 
study drug to inquire about AEs and concomitan t medication usage, and will administer the 
C-SSRS. 
7.7.2 Ocular Examination (Week 12) 
The final ocular examination for corneal sp ecular microscopy is to be conducted 
approximately 12 weeks (+2 days) after the first dose of study drug (including both subjects who complete the study and subjects who disconti nue early from the study); exceptions to be 
discussed with medical monitor.  
 
Additional ophthalmologic examinations (standard ophthalmologic exams and/or corneal 
specular microscopies) may be condu cted to monitor subject safety. 
7.8 Early Termination 
Subjects who discontinue early from the study should be encouraged to complete the End of Treatment (Visit 6) safety assessments within 2 days after their last dose of study drug; 
efficacy assessments are to be performed only if the subject has remained on study drug. If the subject does return for an End of Treatment visit, the C-SSRS ‘Since Last Visit ’ version 
should be completed if the site has become aware of a potential suicide-related thought or 
behavior by other communications (see Section 7.6). 
Subjects who discontinue early from the study should plan to complete the Week 12 corneal specular microscopy (see Section 7.7.2).

 8 SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING 
Investigators are responsible for the detection and documentation of events that meet the 
definition of an AE, an SAE, suspected adverse reaction, serious suspected adverse reaction, unanticipated problems, or AESIs,  as provided in this protocol. 
Investigators must review the BTRX-335140 IB to be aware of the safety-related events, which may be anticipated with its use. Investigat ors will also be versed in the latest standard 
of care guidelines. 
8.1 Adverse Events 
8.1.1 Definition of an Adverse Event 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
An AE may be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, illness, clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory value or ECG finding, or other untoward medical occurrence that appears or worsens in a subject during a clinical study. This definition does not imply a causal relationship between the AE and the study drug. 
Adverse events beginning with the initial dose of study drug or during the subsequent 
duration of their enrollment in the study will be considered TEAEs. Tr eatment-emergent AEs 
will be recorded on the AE eCRF to include the event, date of onset, whether the AE is 
associated with an episode of self-harm, severity, frequency, seriousness, date of resolution, 
action taken with respect to the AE (eg, discontinue study drug, begin concomitant 
medication, begin nonpharmacological treatment, etc.), outcome, and relationship to the study drug. All TEAEs related to study drug will be followed to a satisfactory resolution or until the event becomes stable or can be explained by another known cause (ie, concurrent condition or medication). 
Medical conditions present or AEs occurring prior to the first dose of study drug will be 
captured as medical history in the eCRF. Any AE occurring during the study that is related to a pre-existing condition or event that worsens in intensity or frequency after the first dose of study drug will be recorded as a TEAE.  
Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies because the purpose of the clinical study 
is to establish drug effect. 
8.1.2 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
Serious AEs will be recorded on the AE eCRF from the time of informed consent. An SAE is 
any AE that results in 1 of the following outcomes, regardless of the investigator’s opinion  of 
causation: 
• Death 
• Initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization 

Confidential Page 63 of 88 
 - Surgeries planned prior to signing the ICF will not be considered SAEs. However, 
worsening of the underlying medical condition during the study will be considered an AE and must be captured as serious if any SAE-defining outcomes occur as a result. 
• A life-threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying) 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Other medically important serious event as dete rmined by the investigator (for example, 
an AE that jeopardizes the subject and may re quire medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition) 
 
The following events do not meet the definition of an SAE:  
• Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that does not worsen 
from baseline 
• Hospitalizations for a standard procedure for study drug administration and routine 
monitoring of the studied indication not asso ciated with any deterioration in condition 
• Social or convenience admission to a hospital 
• Prolongation of a hospitalization for social or  convenience reasons not associated with 
the occurrence of an AE 
• Hospitalization or an emergency room visit that lasts less than 24 hours that does not 
meet the criteria of an important medical or a life-threatening event 
 
8.1.3 Definition of Suspected Adverse Reaction 
A suspected adverse reaction is defined as any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the AE was caused by the study drug. 
8.1.4 Definition of Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction 
A serious suspected adverse reaction is any susp ected adverse reaction that is determined to 
be serious, based on the definition of an SAE in Section 8.1.2 . 
8.2 Classification of Adverse Events 
8.2.1 Severity of Adverse Events 
The investigator will assess the severity of each  AE based on his/her clinical judgment using 
one of the following categories: 


Confidential Page 64 of 88 
 • Mild:  Usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic 
intervention. The event does not generally interfer e with usual activities of daily living.  
• Moderate:  Usually alleviated with additional spec ific therapeutic intervention. The event 
interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant 
or permanent risk of harm to the subject. 
• Severe:  Interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, or 
may require intensive therapeutic intervention. 
8.2.2 Relationship to Study Drug 
The investigator will assess the relationship (ie, causality) of each AE to study drug based on 
his/her clinical judgment. The i nvestigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to study drug 
is part of the documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not 
reported in the study. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the 
event should be reported. All AEs must have their relationship to study agent assessed. The Sponsor’s assessment of relationship may differ from the investigator’s assessment.  
Relationship to study drug will be assessed according to the following guidelines: 
• Possibly related:  The AE is known to occur with the study drug, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the study drug caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study drug and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the AE. 
• Unlikely related : There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the 
study drug caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study drug and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established. 
For initially reporting SAEs, even in situations in which minimal information is available, it 
is important that the investigator make an assessment of causality for every event. The causality assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. The investigator may change his or her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information and amend the SAE information accordingly in the eCRF or the SAE reporting form, as applicable. 
8.3 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow-up 
All AEs from the time of informed consent throu gh the last follow-up visit will be recorded 
in each enrolled subject ’s eCRF (see Section 6.3.1 ). For subjects who prematurely 
discontinue from the study, AEs will continue to be recorded through the last follow-up visit. 
For subjects who are found to be ineligible for the study during the Screening period and are not enrolled (ie, Screening failures), AEs th at are SAEs will be captured. Adverse events 
beginning with the initial dose of study dr ug or during the subsequent duration of their 
enrollment in the study will be considered TEAEs. Treatment-emergent AEs will be recorded on the AE eCRF to include the event, date of onset, whether the AE is associated with an 
episode of self-harm, severity, frequency, seriousness, date of resolution, action taken with 
respect to the AE (eg, discontinue study drug, begin concomitant medication, begin 

 nonpharmacological treatment, etc.), outcome, and relationship to the study drug. All TEAEs 
related to study drug will be followed to a satisfactory resolution or until the event becomes stable or can be explained by another known cause (ie, concurrent condition or medication). 
• All SAEs that occur after the informed consen t is signed will be captured. Serious AEs 
reported after a subject has taken the last dos e of study drug will be collected in the 
pharmacovigilance system for 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Thereafter, only SAEs that the investigator feels were related to the study drug or a protocol procedure must be reported. 
8.4 Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Adverse events of special interest (serious or nonserious) are TEAEs of particular safety 
importance and are required to be reported to the sponsor immediately (and no more than 
24 hours after learning of the event, see Section 8.5  for reporting requirements). 
Adverse events of special interest for this study are based on nonclinical findings of skin-related and ocular phototoxicity (see Section 1.1.3 ). Reported TEAEs that are classified 
in the system organ classes (SOCs) listed below will be considered AESIs: 
• Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
• Eye disorders 
Nonserious AEs in the above SOCs that occur prior to study drug dosing will be recorded in medical history. 
Investigators will monitor for dermatologic or ocular events and for any change in visual 
acuity. 
8.5 Reporting Procedures 
8.5.1 Reporting Serious Adverse Events and Adverse Events of Special Interest 
All SAEs and AESIs must be reported on a study-specific SAE/AESI form in addition to the 
AE eCRF by electronic data capture (EDC). Study site personnel must alert the 
Sponsor-designated medical monitor of the SAE/AESI and must submit the completed study-specific SAE/AESI form to  
 wi thin 24 hours of the site’s awareness of the 
SAE/AESI . 
The investigator must also enter the SAE/AESI information into the eCRF as soon as possible thereafter. 
In the initial email, the investigator must provide to the Sponsor the SAE/AESI form, 
completed to the greatest extent possible and the following pages from the eCRF: 
• AE record 

Confidential Page 66 of 88 
 • Medical history 
• Prior and concomitant medications 
Also, the following documents are to be forwarded: any laboratory results, diagnostic test 
results, or medical reports relevant to the SAE/AESI. 
The investigator and supporting personnel responsi ble for subject care should discuss with 
the Sponsor-designated medical monitor or designee any need for supplemental 
investigations of SAEs/AESIs. The results of these additional assessments conducted must be reported to the Sponsor-designated medical monitor.  
In the event of a medical emergency in which knowledge of the subject ’s treatment 
assignment may influence their clinical care the investigator has the option to unblind the 
subject s’ treatment assignment via the IWRS system. The investigator should make every 
effort to contact the medical monitor prior to unblinding unless this would adversely delay appropriate medical care. The medical monitor wi ll not be unblinded, they will only provide 
assistance to the investigator. The reasons fo r unblinding must be noted in the source 
documents. The investigator must not disclose the subject ’s treatment assignment to anyone 
who does not need the information due to their direct involvement in the subject ’s clinical 
care. Disposition of subjects who are unbli nded due to a medical emergency will be 
determined following discussion with the Sponsor. 
In the event of death, every effort should be made to obtain a death certificate and if possible, 
an autopsy report. If the cause of death is unknown, death will be recorded as the event.  
The investigator is responsible for safety reporting in compliance with their IRB. 
8.5.2 Regulatory Reporting Requirements 
The investigator must promptly report all SAEs to the Sponsor in accordance with the 
procedures detailed in Section 8.5.1 . The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify, as 
appropriate, both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under clinical investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs by the investigator to 
the appropriate project contact for SAE receipt is essential so that serious suspected adverse reactions that are either unexpected or observed with increasing occurrence be reported and legal obligations and ethical responsibilities re garding the safety of other subjects are met. 
Investigator letters are prepared according to Sponsor policy and are forwarded to the investigators as necessary. An investigator letter is prepared for a serious unexpected suspected adverse reaction (SUSAR) that is attributable to study drug. The purpose of the investigator letter is to fulfill specific regulatory and cGCP requirements regarding the product under investigation. 
The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, must comply with 
requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to the IRB. 

 The Sponsor is responsible for informing IRB, investigators, and regulatory authorities of 
any finding that could adversely affect the safety of subjects or affect the conduct of the study. Events will be reported to regulatory  authorities in accordance with expedited 
reporting requirements. 
8.5.3 Overdose 
Overdose is defined as an accidental or intenti onal administration of more than the intended 
dose of study drug. In the event of an overdose of study drug, the investigator should use 
clinical judgment in treating the overdose and contact the Sponsor-designated medical monitor, or designee. The investigator should refer to the relevant document(s) for detailed information regarding warnings, precautions, contraindications, AEs, and other significant data pertaining to the study drug. Such documentation may include, but not be limited to the 
IB. 
8.5.4 Pregnancy Reporting 
If a female subject or the female partner of a treated male subject becomes pregnant, the 
subject must notify the investigator within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy. The 
investigator must make every effort to ensure that the subject or the pregnant female is aware of the need to notify her healthcare provider regarding her male partner’s participati on in this 
clinical study and his potential exposure to BTRX-335140. 
The study site must complete a pregnancy form and send to the Sponsor or designee within 
24 hours of learning of the pregnancy. The study site will make every effort to follow the 
pregnancy until outcome is known. 
8.6 Safety Oversight 
The Sponsor-designated medical monitor and the st udy team will monitor blinded safety data 
throughout the course of the study as detailed in the medical monitoring plan. This will 
include review of AEs, SAEs, AESIs, ECG findings, clinical laboratory results, vital signs, ophthalmologic findings, and other safety data. 
In the event that safety monitoring uncovers an issue that needs to be addressed by 
unblinding at the group level, a data monitoring committee will be formed to protect the integrity of data and to evaluate additional analyses of the safety data. 

 9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
9.1 General Considerations 
Full details on the statistical methodology to be used will be included in a statistical analysis 
plan (SAP) to be developed prior to study unblinding. 
For the purpose of all safety analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the last 
measurement prior to the start of study drug administration. For efficacy analyses, baseline is defined as the arithmetic mean of pretreatment  measurements ie, Screening and Baseline, 
prior to the first administration of study drug, or as the last measurement prior to the first administration of study drug if only single value is available. 
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with n, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, 
minimum and maximum. In addition, change from baseline and percent ch ange from baseline 
values will be calculated at each time point and summarized descriptively. For categorical 
endpoints, descriptive summaries will include counts and percentages.  
No adjustments will be made for multiple comparisons.  
All statistical comparisons will be 2-sided with alpha of 0.05.  SAS version 9.4 or higher will be used to analyze data.  
9.2 Analysis Populations 
The safety analysis will be conducted on the Safety Population. Efficacy analyses will be 
conducted on the Efficacy population and the pe r-protocol (PP) population. The Efficacy 
population will be used for the primary efficacy analysis.  
 Subjects will be analyzed according to randomized treatment assignment for 
efficacy assessments and according to treatment received for safety assessments. 9.2.1 Safety Population 
The Safety population is defined as all subjects who received study drug and will be used to 
summarize safety data. 
9.2.2 Efficacy Population 
The Efficacy population includes all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
study drug, have a baseline HAMD-17 assessmen t value, and have at least 1 post-baseline 
assessment. This population will be used to su mmarize the primary and other efficacy data. 
9.2.3 Per-protocol Population 
The PP population includes subjects in the efficacy population who did not experience any major protocol deviations that impact primary efficacy endpoint analysis. 

9.3 Statistical Analysis Methods 
9.3.1 Disposition 
Frequency counts and percentages of subjects  who were screened, randomized, completed 
the treatment, or discontinued early will be presented by treatment group. Reasons for 
discontinuation will be summarized. 
9.3.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic and baseline characteristics including age, sex, BMI, race, ethnicity, height, 
weight, CGI-S, baseline HAMD-17, duration of current depressive episode, antidepressant 
treatment during the current episode, and other medical history, physical examinations, and prior and concomitant medications will be summ arized using descriptive statistics. Prior and 
concomitant medications will be summariz ed by World Health Organization Drug 
Classification (WHODrug) for Drug Statistics Methodology. 
9.3.3 Efficacy Analyses 
9.3.3.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy analysis is a comparison of mean reduction in HAMD-17 scores 
between BTRX-335140 and placebo at Week 8. The analysis will be conducted using a Mixed-Models Repeated Measures (MMRM) with  change from baseline in HAMD-17 score 
as the dependent variable and will include treatment group, Week, and Week by treatment 
group interaction as factors, and baseline HA MD-17 score as covariate. Variance estimation 
will be based on an unstructured covariance ma trix. The model-based Week 8 least square 
(LS) means, standard errors, 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and p-values will be reported. 
9.3.3.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Similar to the method described above, a MMRM model will be calculated for the change 
from baseline to each timepoint asse ssed for comparisons between BTRX-335140 and 
placebo for the measures listed below. The model-based time points’  LS means, standard 
errors, 95% CIs, and p-values will be reported. Alternatively, ANCOVA may be used, as 
appropriate. The following measures will be analyzed: 
• CGI-I 
• CGI-S 
• SHAPS 
• HADS subscales: HADS-A and HADS-D 

 • HAM-A total score 
• SDS 
For CGI-I, an additional analysis comparing the percentage of subjects with responses at 
Week 4 and Week 8 of ‘much improved’ or ‘very much improved’ between BTRX -335140 
and placebo will be performed using generalized estimating equa tions (GEE). The model will 
include treatment, baseline CGI-S score, week, and week by treatment group interaction. An exchangeable working correlation structure will be assumed.  
The change from baseline to Week 8 in CGI-S will be estimated using an ANCOVA model, 
with main effects for treatment group and a covariate adjustment for baseline score. 
The response rates (the percentage of subjects with ≥ 50% decrease in HAMD-17 from 
baseline to Week 4 and Week 8) will be  compared between BTRX-335140 and placebo-
treated groups using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tes t. Additional categories may be explored.  
. 
9.3.4 Safety Analysis 
Safety data, including AEs, safety laboratory results, physical examination results, , vital signs, suicidality, COWS scores, and ECG will  be summarized by treatment group (placebo 
and BTRX-335140) and/or listed. 
9.3.4.1 Adverse Events 
Adverse events occurring after the first dose of study drug will be considered to be TEAEs. 
The incidence of TEAEs will be summarized by seriousness, severity, and causality to study drug. Treatment-emergent AEs leading to di scontinuation will also be summarized. 
Adverse events with onset before first study dose and after last study dose will be listed. 
9.3.4.2 Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Adverse events of special interest for this study are based on nonclinical findings of 
skin-related and ocular phototoxicity (see Section 1.1.3 and Section 8.4 ). AESIs will be 
summarized by SOC/preferred term.  
9.3.4.3 Vital Signs 
Changes from baseline will be summarized  for temperature, pulse (supine and standing), 
respiratory rate (supine and standing), and BP (supine and standing) by treatment and visit.

 10 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL 
Quality assurance and quality control systems will be implemented and maintained with 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) by the Sponsor and/or its designee(s), as appropriate, to ensure that the clinical study is conducted and the data are generated, documented 
(recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, International Council for 
Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH)-GCP 
E6(R2) guidelines, and applicable regulatory requirements. The accuracy, completeness, and 
reliability of the study data presented to the Sponsor, however, are the responsibility of the 
investigator. The investigator or designee must record all required data using the prespecified 
data collection method defined by the Sponsor or its designee.  
The study will be monitored regularly by the Sponsor ( Section 8.6 ) and may be audited or 
inspected by the Sponsor (or designee), IRB, and/or regulatory authorities at any time during 
the study or after study completion. In the event of an audit, the investigator agrees to allow 
the Sponsor, representatives of the Sponsor, the competent authority, or other regulatory 
agencies direct access to all study records. The investigator will immediately notify the Sponsor of all audits or inspections scheduled by any regulatory authority and promptly

 available that might affect patients’ willingne ss to participate in the study, or if any 
amendments to the protocol require changes to the informed consent/assent form, the 
Sponsor will provide Investigators with a revised informed consent/assent form. One copy of the signed informed consent documents will be  given to the subject; the investigator will 
retain the original copies of these documents.  
The informed consent document, as prepared by the Sponsor or designee, must be reviewed 
and approved by the IRB before initiation of the study. The informed consent document must contain the basic required elements of consent and additional elements, as applicable, as 
specified in the 21 CFR 50.25. 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring  that the subject understands the potential risks 
and benefits of participating in the study, in cluding answering any questions the subject may 
have throughout the study and sharing in a timely manner any new information that may be 
relevant to the subject ’s willingness to continue his or her participation in the study.  
The ICF will be used to explain the potential risks and benefits of study participation to the 
subject in simple terms before the subject is en tered into the study, and to document that the 
subject is satisfied with his or her understanding of the risks and benefits of participating in 
the study and desires to participate in the study.  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that informed consent is given by each subject. 
This includes obtaining the appropriate si gnatures and dates on the ICF prior to the 
performance of any protocol procedures and pr ior to the administration of study drug. 
11.5 Confidentiality 
All information regarding the nature of the proposed investigation that is provided to the investigator by the Sponsor, the Sponsor’s designee, or the study monitor, with the exception 
of information that is required by law or regulations to be disclosed to the IRB/IEC, the 
subject ’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s) or the appropriate regulatory authority, must be kept 
in confidence by the investigator in accordance  with current Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) standards and/or European standards.  
The anonymity of participating subjects will be maintained to the extent required by 
applicable laws and in accordance with cu rrent HIPAA standards. Subjects may be 
referenced by their initials and an assigned subject identification number on the CRFs and other data collected by the Sponsor. The investig ator must maintain all documents related to 
the study that identify the subject (eg, the signed informed consent document) in strict confidence, except to the extent necessary to allow auditing by the appropriate regulatory 
authorities, the IRB/IEC, the study monitor, or the Sponsor or its representatives. 

 12 STUDY ADMINISTRATION 
12.1 Clinical Monitoring 
Electronic CRFs will be completed for all study s ubjects enrolled in the study. At scheduled 
monitoring visits, eCRFs will be verified against source documentation. In the event that 
on-site scheduled monitoring cannot be conducted, the monitoring of data in the eCRF will be detailed in the clinical monitoring plan. U pon completion of this re view, finalized eCRFs 
will be submitted to the Sponsor’s designated  CRO. Any subsequent changes to the eCRFs 
will be performed in accordance with the CRO’s SOP s for editing and clarifying eCRFs. 
Data entry will be performed through username and password-protected access to a secure database. All data will be entered using electronic eCRFs. Internally developed programs for 
plausibility, consistency, and out-of-range data fields will supplement the review of the data. 
A 100% manual review of AEs, drug accountability and termination summary data, will be 
performed by Data Management personnel. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coding thesaurus will be used to classify AEs and medical history, and 
the WHODrug classification will be used to code medications. 
After all subjects complete the study and data di screpancies are resolved, and prior to study 
unblinding, protocol deviations during both enroll ment and study execution will be reviewed. 
Significant protocol deviations and procedural discrepancies will be discussed and major 
deviations will be identified and reported. 
12.2 Source Documents and Record Retention 
Essential study documents are among the critical documents required before study 
enrollment is to occur. Essential documents, as well as supplemental information such as the 
IB, Pharmacy Manual, CRF Completion Guidelines, final protocol, as specified in the Clinical Operations Manual and/or Regulatory Binder, must be kept on-site in a designated study site file.  
The study site files will also contain, including but not limited to, subject accountability 
records, drug accountability (receipt/dis pensing) records, Sponsor/investigator 
correspondence, IRB/IEC correspondence, deviations, biological sample records, and SAE and IND safety reports/Safety Alert Letters/SUSARs. 
12.3 Management of Protocol Amendments and Deviations 
All processes and procedures defined in this  protocol must be adhered to. Emergency 
departures from the protocol that eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to a particular 
subject and that are deemed by the investigator as  crucial for the safety and wellbeing of that 
subject may be instituted for that subj ect only and documented as deviations. The 
investigator will contact the medical monitor as soon as possible regarding such a deviation. 
These departures do not require preapproval by  the IRB/IEC; however, the IRB and medical 
monitor must be notified in writing as soon as possible in accordance with the IRB policies 
after the departure has been made. 

 Study records must be retained for at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. However, these 
documents should be retained for a longer pe riod if required by applicable regulatory 
requirements or if agreed to in the Clinical Trial Agreement. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the site as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. 
12.3.1 Protocol Modifications 
The protocol cannot be modified except in a formal protocol amendment by the Sponsor. 
12.3.2 Protocol Violations and Deviations 
Protocol deviations are a change, divergen ce, or departure from the study design or 
procedures defined in this protocol. An Important Protocol Deviation is a deviation that may 
significantly impact the completeness, accuracy , and/or reliability of the study data or that 
may significantly affect a subject ’s rights, safety, or well -being. The investigator will notify 
the IRB of any protocol deviations as require d by IRB guidelines and site requirements. 
Protocol deviations will be documented at the site and in the Sponsor files. In the event of an Important Protocol Deviation, the site will notify the Sponsor or designee. The Sponsor is 
responsible for notifying the regulatory authorities of any protocol deviations, as required. 
12.4 Financial Disclosure 
Investigators are required to inform the Sponsor of all disclosable financial interests or 
arrangements (including those of their s pouse and dependent children), prior to study 
initiation at the site, at study completion, and 1 year after study completion in accordance 
with 21 CFR Part 54. In addition, the investigator or sub-investigators must promptly notify 
the Sponsor if there are any reportable changes that occur during the above-described period.  
Disclosable financial interests or arrangements, or the absence thereof will be recorded on the 
Financial Disclosure for Clinical Investigators Form. Any investigator(s) added as investigationa l staff to the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) 1572 form must complete the Financial Disclosure for Clinical Investigators Form at 
the start of his/her participation in the study. The Financial Disclosure for Clinical Investigators Form for any investigator(s) leaving the study prior to completion will also be 
obtained. 
12.5 Stopping Criteria: Suspension or Term ination of Study or Investigational 
Site 
The Sponsor may suspend or terminate the study, or part of the study, at any time for any 
reason. If the study is suspended or terminated, the Sponsor will ensure that applicable sites, regulatory agencies, and IRBs/ECs are notified as appropriate. 

 APPENDIX 1: GUIDANCE FOR VIRTUAL VISITS (VIA TELEPHONE) 
The guidance below is intended for subjects who have been successfully enrolled and 
randomized into the study and who elect to c onduct a virtual visit to  reduce subject burden or 
who are unable to attend in-person clinic visits due to COVID-19 restrictions. 
Every reasonable effort should be made to ensure that the subjects continue on study per 
protocol; however, in the event that a subject cannot  come to the clinic after the baseline visit 
due to self-quarantine, local restrictions, illness,  or other reasons as described in the protocol, 
the site personnel may conduct a virtual (by teleph one contact) visit. Clinical laboratory tests 
are to be performed at a minimum every 4 we eks. Up to 2 nonsequential virtual visits 
between Visits 3 and 5 may be allowed. If the subject is unable to return for Visit 6, the 
subject should return to the site, at their earliest convenience, for an End of Treatment visit 
(see Sections 4.4 and 7.8). 
Conducting Study Procedures for the Virtual Visit 
The following procedures are to be completed via the telephone (see Table A1-1 ): 
• The following clinician-completed assessments can be performed via the telephone: 
HAM-A, HAMD-17, CGI-S, CGI-I, and C-SSRS. Raters will need to document, in the 
tablet, if data were collected via phone (vs in person). 
• The following subject-rated scales will be conducted over the phone: , HADS, SDS, 
, and SHAPS. Subjects must have the PDF copy of the SDS with them during the 
assessment. Following the subject’s self -assessment on the SDS, the rater should review 
the Work/School and Days Lost items to confi rm appropriateness of the selected ratings 
by evaluating the impact of MDD symptoms across those sectors. Site personnel will 
enter the information directly into the tablet on behalf of the subject and will indicate, in 
the tablet, that this information was captured over the phone. 
• The following will also be discussed with the subject: AEs and concomitant medications, and alcohol and drug use; details will be captured in the source data. As the COWS 
cannot be fully administered by phone (as so me items require direct observations), in 
capturing AEs site staff should be alert to symptoms that require further enquiry to determine if there is any possibility of opioid withdrawal. 
• Study drug compliance will be discussed with the subject; however, pill count will be completed at the time of the next visit when the subject returns to the clinic. 
The above assessments are required to be done  as listed.  
 
When subjects cannot come into the clinic and a virtual visit is performed, all other assessments including laboratory testing, vital signs measurements, and ECG will be noted as unable to be completed. 

Dispensing Study Drug 
Subjects may choose to pick up the study drug from the site if that option is available at the 
site. If subjects are not able to come to the site, the IWRS will be completed in a timely manner to ensure that the subject gets the next bottle of study drug, which will be couriered 
to the subject’s home prior to the current supply running out.  Delivery of the study drug will 
be tracked by the courier and documentation will be provided to  the site. The subject will 
retain their current bottle of medication and any unused supplies, and the prior and new bottle will be returned at their next clinic visit. Th e courier documentation will be maintained in the 
pharmacy file to track the distribution of the product, and the subject will be instructed to confirm the receipt of the study drug. This w ill be documented in th e source documents for 
this subject. 
If a subject is required, or is predicted to need, to miss more than 1 sequential clinic 
visit, they will be instructed to discontinue study drug and asked to return to the clinic for safety evaluation when appropriate and safe to do so.

Section 7.6) will be conducted at the clinic. The re ason for termination will be documented in 
EDC and, if appropriate, note that termination  was due to the COVID-19 situation (see

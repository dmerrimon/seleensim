 1.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
 Metastatic or Unresectable Tumors  
 
In 2018, it is estimated that the US cancer prevalence was about 14.5 million Americans, 
and this is expected to balloon to approximately 19 million Americans by 2024 (American 
Cancer Society 2019) . Metastatic or unresectable disease is the cause of cancer -related 
morbidity and mortality for about 90% of cancer patients  (Chaffer and Weinberg 2011) . 
Clinical presentation of disease can vary widely depending on the site of the tumo r, but 
pain is frequently a presenting symptom (Hamilton et al. 2015). 
 
 Radiotherapy for Tumors Needing Palliation  
 
While radiotherapy paradigms evolve, symptomatic palliation is at the forefront of 
treatment intent (Spencer et al. 2018; Jones and Simone II 2014). As such, appropriate modality, dose, and fractionation continue to be investigated . Ongoing studies suggest 
hypofractionated approaches are favorable for this population with regimens  based on 
principles of cancer radiobiology, such as the Spanos Regimen and the QUAD SHOT , 
having variable success in specific disease sites (Carrascosa et al. 2007; Corry et al. 2005) . 
 
Recent data demonstrates that SBRT offers improvements over conventionally fractionated 
radiotherapy for palliative treat ment (Sprave et al. 2018; Nguyen et al. 2019) . Three  issues 
limit the utility of SBRT. First, dose escalation can be difficult given the proximity to 
surrounding OARs (Hartsell et al. 2005; Shiue et al. 2018) . Second, it may be unsafe to 
treat large tumors with SBRT. Retrospective data and secondary analyses from SBRT t rials 
for NSCLC suggest that 5 cm should be the upper limit for which SBRT may be employed (Allibhai et al. 2013; Videtic et al. 2017) . Third, SBRT may not be as effectiv e for larger 
lesions as it is for smaller lesions.  Prior studies support this limitation.  (Ricco et al. 2017; 
Masucci 2018)  
 
 Spatially Fractionated Radiotherapy (SFRT)  
 
SFRT may address these limitations of traditional SBRT.  SFRT relies on beam collimation 
to create high -dose “peaks,” organized throughout a target volume wi th intervening low -
dose “valleys” (Billena and Khan 2019) . SFRT as a 2 -dimensional technique is being 
evaluated in soft tissue sarcoma in a prospective setting (M. Mohiuddin et al. 2009; Mohammed Mohiuddin et al. 2014). In these studies, a sing le dose of 2 -dimensional SFRT 
was used either alone or in combination with further conventionally fractionated radiation with or without chemotherapy with1-2 year LC greater than 90% and limited Grade 2 -3 
skin toxicities.  
 
Lattice radiotherapy  is a form of SFRT that uses a 3 -dimensional beam arrangement to 
target high -dose spherical volumes which allows for a more flexible beam arrangement, 
better normal tissue optimization, and lower exit beam skin dose (X et al. 2010) . 
Classically, SFRT had been planned to achieve a dose fall off to 20 -30% of the “peak ” 
dose (Meigooni et al. 2006) . Tested approaches for Lattice designa te spheres 1 -2 cm spaced 
Protocol Version Date: 06/09/2023   Page 13 of 50 
 2-3 cm apart (center to center) (Amendola et al. 2018; E et al. 2010) . Prior studies show 
that Lattic e SFRT can be delivered using IMRT  or VMAT (Gholami et al. 2016; Billena 
and Khan 2019). 
 
 Correlative Studies Background  
 
In animal models, extreme hypo- fractionation was found to induce infiltration of T -cells 
(Lugade et al. 2005). Also, SBRT has been shown to alter levels of soluble PD -L1, IFN 
α/β/γ, TNFα, and various interleukins  (Trovo et al. 2016; Ellsworth et al. 2017; Walle et 
al. 2018; Song et al. 2019). 
 It is hypothesized that SFRT spares interspersed small volumes of normal tissue allowing it to tolerate higher doses of radiotherapy while immun e-mediated bystander effects allow 
for cell kill of areas of tumor receiving a lower dose. This hypothesis is supported by the 
finding SFRT is associated with increased serum TNF α and that higher levels of TNF α are 
associated with complete tumor response (Sathishkumar et al. 2002). 
 SFRT has been shown to elicit a local effect by the “bystander effect” (i.e. effects to tumor cells in the valleys) via secretion of cytokines, induction of cellular repair pathways, and induction of apoptosis (Sathishkumar et al. 2016; Najafi et al. 2014; Asur et al. 2012).  While SBRT and SFRT are both felt to elicit robust immune responses, the immunogenic effects of Lattice SBRT  have not been studied.  
 
 Rationale for treatment approach 
 
Standard palliative radiotherapy regimens may provide limited durability of response in 
large tumors . Thus , there is a clinical need for a new approach. A standard palliative 
radiotherapy regimen is 20 Gy in 5 fractions, and therefore it is reasonable to assume that 
this should be the minimum dose delivered for adequate tumor coverage in an Lattice SBRT  plan. Assuming that this represents the 30% isodose (i.e. the “valley ”), this would 
allow appropriate dose escalation in the “peak ” to 66.7 Gy (i.e. the 100% isodose) . The 
Lattice SBRT  approach may improve symptom response, LC , and better prime the tumor 
microenvironment for immune response  (Ko, Benjamin, and Formenti 2018; Walle et al. 
2018; Krombach et al. 2019)  compared with canonical palliative radiotherapy  doses with 
the added benefit of less toxicity than a traditional homogenous SBRT  plan.  
 
 Study Design 
 
 Overall Design  
 
This is a study  evaluating the safety and efficacy of Lattice SBRT  for patients with 
large tumors (≥ 4.5 cm) planning to undergo palliative radiotherapy. Patients will 
be enrolled into 1 of 4 cohorts based on their cancer histology (each  at least  N=10): 
sarcoma, thoracic cancers (including esophageal) , upper abdominal (including 
hepatobiliary) , or pelvic cancers (including gynecologic and lower GI cancers) . 
Protocol Version Date: 06/09/2023   Page 14 of 50 
 Eligible patients  will undergo radiotherapy using Lattice SBRT . Lattice SBRT  will 
be prescrib ed to 20 Gy in 5 fractions delivered every other day with a Lattice SIB 
to 66.7 Gy  in 5 fractions. Patients will be followed for 12 months after the 
completion of all therapy for efficacy and treatment- related toxicity assessment .    
 
Secondary outcomes  will include patient -reported quality of life outcomes. In 
addition, we will analyze blood- based markers of treatment response, so blood will 
be drawn prior to and after completion of radiotherapy.  
 Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
 
Tumor  burden incurs significant morbidity in terms of symptomatology , including 
pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and mass effect on surrounding organs . Palliative 
hypofractionated radiotherapy is known to be a useful modality for control and/or 
amelioration of such s ymptoms . However, large tumors are difficult to treat with 
traditional palliative methods. Hypofractionated radiotherapy may offer insufficient control and SBRT may be associated with a high rate of toxicity.  Dose escalation using SFRT m ay offer improved local control, symptom relief, and 
reduced toxicity compared with traditional radiotherapy methods. Also, SFRT has been associated with  significant activation  of systemic anti -tumor cytokines and 
chemokines.   Our initial pilot study of SBRT has been successful thus far , demonstrating that 
Lattice SBRT is safe and effective treatment for large tumors. However, the pilot  
study has thus far  demonstrated significant heterogeneity in the patient population. 
Patients are enrolled for different indications and tumor types have varied (i.e. treatment of oligoprogressive disease, palliation of pain, palliation of lung cancer for dyspnea, palliation of sarcoma for bleeing). Further, Lattice SBRT has been followed with varied treatments (i.e. medical therapies, surger y), and sometimes no 
treatment. Given this heterogeneity, objectively determining the effect of Lattice SBRT both on tumor control and patient QoL is difficult.  This trial of Lattice SBRT will attempt to define efficacy and safety using dual 
primary endpoints for all patients: local tumor control at 6 months and rate of 
treatment related grade 3+ CTCAE v5.0 toxicity. Secondary endpoints will then evaluate patient reported QoL in 4 pre -specified sub- groups: sarcomas, thoracic 
malignancies, gastrointestinal malignancies, and pelvic cancers.   
 
 Justification for Dose  
 
One standard regimen for palliative radiotherapy is 20 Gy in 5 fractions. In SFRT, 
the traditional dose gradient between minimum tumor dose and maximum tumor 
dose is 30% to 100% , respectively . Using 20 Gy in 5 fractions as traditional 
coverage for lesions  needing palliation (i.e. 30% “ valley ” tumor coverage), the 
“peak” 100% dose is 66.7 Gy in 5 fractions.

 Risk/Benefit Assessment  
 
 Known Potential Risks  
 
High -dose radiation has been known to cause toxicity to normal tissue. This is 
manifested variably depending on the are a of the body treated. While the potential 
toxicities can be serious and include death, these toxicities are rare when high -
quality, high- dose radiation is delivered within established normal tissue dose 
constraints using appropriate immobilization , image guidance, and institutional 
experience.  
 We have successfully tested Lattice SBRT  plans prescribed to 66.7 Gy in 5 
fractions using institutional quality assurance protocols similar to conventional SBRT  and have implemented this treatment approach in the LITE SABR M1 pilot 
study with few treatment related toxicities . At the time of this  writing, LITE SABR 
M1 has accrued 15 patients. A review of the first 8 patients and a data safety monitoring report was completed on 4/29/2020. This passed review and found no protocol SAEs. Since that time, we have had one potentially treatment -related g rade 
3+ toxicity.   Given this experience , we continue to expect that the toxicity risks associated with 
Lattice SBRT  plans to be similar or better than  conventional SBRT  for large tumors  
if the required established dose constraints are met. Blood collecti on prior to and 
after radiotherapy poses a small risk of pain and bleeding. 
 
 
2.0 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
 
Objectives  Endpoints  Justification for Endpoints  
Primary  
To evaluate the efficacy  of 5-
fraction palliative Lattice SBRT in patients with  with 
large lesions who are planning to undergo palliative radiotherapy (≥4.5 
cm).  Rate of target lesion local

 escalation with SBRT is 
warranted. CTCAE v5.0 is a 
widely accepted standardized measure of treatment -related 
toxicity.  
Secondary  
To assess pain response to 
Lattice SBRT  For patients that have pain, 
their pain level will be assessed with the pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)  The NRS is an 11 -point scale 
for patient self -reporting of 
pain. This is selected because it is a reliable and clinically meaningful measure of pain that is extensively used in 
research and clinical practice.  
To assess patient -reported 
toxicity outcomes For patients that do not have 
pain, patient-reported symptom response will be assessed with PRO- CTCAE. A treatment site 
specific package of PRO -
CTCAE measures will be defined for each treatment location (thorax, abdomen, 
pelvis, extremity)  PRO -CTCAE is a 
standardized inventory to 
collected patient reported symptomatic adverse events in clinical trials.  
To assess patient reported 
quality of life outcomes 
 Patient reported quality of life 
and functional outcomes will be measured before treatment, after treatment, and at each follow up with the PROMIS Global, Physical Function, Pain Interference, Anxiety, and 
Depression system  This patient reported outcome 
inventory was selected because it is a reliable and clinically meaningful measure of patient reported to xicities 
and functional outcomes. 
Exploratory    
To evaluate blood for 
immune - and tumor damage-
associated response with 
Lattice SBRT  Whole blood will be collected 
at baseline and after Lattice SBRT for exploratory studies of immune and tumor damage associated -response The response of immune -
related markers will be assessed before and after Lattice SBRT to better understand the immunogenic 
effects of treatment on tumor.

 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention  
 
Our institution sees a high volume of patients that are referred for palliative radiotherapy .  
 
The primary source of patients who are eligible for this study will be radiation oncologists 
within our department . The most likely service lines to see patients with large tumors in 
need of palliative radiotherapy are sarcoma, thorax (i.e. lung cancer), gastrointestinal, gynecologic (pelvic), and palliative . Dr. Samson  (sarcoma, thorax, gastrointestinal ) is the 
PI, and the other service line chiefs are enthusiastic about this trial and are listed as co -
investigators: Dr. Clifford Robinson (Thorax), Dr. Hyun Kim (Gastrointest inal), Dr. 
Stephanie Markovina  (Gynecologic), Dr. Chris Abraham (Palliative). Additionally, a full-
time research coordinator will be assigned to this study who will assist in  screening patients 
who are referred to our department for palliative radiotherapy  for a large tumor.   
 With the current rate of patients  in need of palliative radiotherapy presenting to our 
department , we anticipate approximately  100 patients per year will be eligible for this 
protocol . A conservative estimate is that 50%  of these pat ients will consent to participate 
in this study. This yields an estimated accrual of 50 patients per year. We anticipate that 
we will enroll 67 patients of all genders, races, and ethnicities. Given the hypofractionated 
course of therapy, 95% of patients s hould be able to complete the rapy. We anticipate that 
we will accrue approximately  4 patients per month, therefore completing accrual in 15 
months . Patients will be accrued from the outpatient clinics and inpatient hospitals of one 
U.S. site. Potential par ticipants will be identified by our multidisciplinary team physicians 
and discussed in tumor board.   
 
5.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
 Study Intervention Description  
 
Consenting and eligible patients will undergo Lattice SBRT  prescribed to a dose of 20 Gy 
in 5 fractions with a simultaneous integrated boost of 66.7 Gy in 5 fractions. As long as 
radiotherapy fields do not overlap, treatment of up to 4 other tumor sites are allowed. 
Lattice SBRT  is required for all tumor sites ≥ 4.5 cm. Lattice SBRT  fractions will be 
delivered every other day. For sites < 4.5 cm, other planning techniques may be used (i.e. 
3D conformal or SBRT). Following radiotherapy , patients will be evaluated for toxicity at  
30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months.  
 Risk Designation for Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)  
 While it is rare with solid tumor malignancies, the risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) may be elevated with spatially fractionated radiotherapy. Patients at high -risk for or 
complications from TLS are those meeting ANY of the following criteria: 
 
o Radiosensitive histologies including lymphoma, breast cancer, small cell carcinoma, neuroblastoma, germ cell tumors, medulloblastoma, myxoid 
Protocol Version Date: 06/09/2023   Page 20 of 50 
 liposarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, angiosarcoma, synovial 
sarcoma, and squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck, skin, or gynecological cancers (i.e. cervix, ovary) 
o Patients who have received or plan to receive systemic therapy within 2 weeks or less of starting or finishing Lattice SBRT 
o Patients wi th a history of CKD stage III based on MDRD eGFR calculation , a 
history of cardiac arrhythemias, or seizures.  
o Patients with  LDH,  uric acid , or potassium above the normal limit on pre -radiation 
evaluation. 
 
 Monitoring for TLS 
 For all patients, assessments of hematologic and metabolic function such as a CBC and renal function panel  (required to include assessments of uric acid, potassium, phosphorus, 
and calcium) will be collected  at the following time points: 
• No more than 1 week before treatment (including on the day of treatment) 
• Immediately after radiotherapy completion (Fraction 5 , day 0)  
• At 48 -72 hours after radiotherapy completion  
• At 7 days (+/- 1 day) after radiotherapy completion  
 
 Pre-Radiation Evaluation 
 
• History and physical exam by team radiation oncologist 
• Assessment of hematologic and metabolic function such as a CBC and renal 
function panel . This must include assessments of uric acid, potassium, phosphorus, 
and calcium. 
• CT, PET/CT,  or MRI  of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis 
• Completion of baseline NRS pain score (if applicable) , PRO -CTCAE, PROMIS 
Global, Physical Function, Pain Interference, Anxiety, and Depression 
questionnaires 
• Peripheral  blood collection. 
 
 Radiation Therapy  
 
Lattice SBRT  must be used  for at least one lesion 4.5 cm or greater . The prescription dose 
for Lattice SBRT  is 20 Gy in 5 fractions with a SIB to 66.7 Gy in 5 fractions. For Lattice 
SBRT , patients must be treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or 
volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT ). Intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) is 
allowed. 
 For Lattice SBRT , each lesion should be treated no more frequently than every other day, 
but treatment of each lesion may be staggered so that the patient has radiotherapy daily. No more than 3 lesions should be treated on the same day. 
 
For other lesions, a standard palliative  regimen of 5 fractions or less  is encouraged but not 
required, and lesions amenable to conventional SBRT may be treated as such as well.  
Protocol Version Date: 06/09/2023   Page 21 of 50 
  
Multiple Lattice radiotherapy plans delivered during the trial period may not overlap. Reirradiation of prior irradiated sites is not allowed.  
 
 Localization, Simulation, and Immobilization  
 
Simulation and treatment position will be determined by the treat ing radiation 
oncologist and team. Patients should be optimally positioned for stereotactic body radiation therapy with alpha cradles, aquaplast masks, or other methods of 
immobilization . The use of devices to alter dose distributions, such as bolus or lea d 
shields, are allowed. Use of techniques to control and/or accommodate tumor 
motion may also be employed in constructing the planning target volume (PTV).  A treatment planning CT scan or MRI  in the treatment position will be required to 
define the PTV. T he extent of the CT scan will be determined at the discretion of 
the treating physician. A CT scan slice thickness of ≤ 5 mm should be employed.  
 
 Treatment Planning/Target Volumes  
 
The definitions for the GTV, PTV and normal structures used in this protocol 
generally conform to the 1993 ICRU report #50 titled Prescribing, Recording and Reporting Photon Beam Therapy.   
5.5.2.1 Target Volumes and Normal Structures  
 
Target Volumes  
Gross Tumor Volume (GTV):  Contour using all available clinical and 
radiographic information. Fusion of other diagnostic imaging to delineate 
the GTV is allowed.  Construction of an iGTV using 4DCT imaging is 
allowed. For boney lesions of the spine, the entire involved vertebral bod y 
may be included in the GTV.  
 
Planning Target Volume  2000 cGy  (PTV_2000) : Represents a geometric 
expansion of the G TV (or iGTV) of up to 1.0 cm. The PTV should be 
reduced as not to extend beyond the patient (i.e. in to air)  and may be 
reduced as to not extend into skin (i.e. external contour contracted by 3-5 mm).  
 GTV -5: Represents a geometric contraction of 0.5 cm from the GTV, and is 
used for generation of the subsequent high-dose target.  Planning Target Volume  6670 cGy  (PTV_6670) : Spheres with diameter 1.5 
cm should be placed 6 cm apart as measured from center to center inside 
the GTV. The spheres should be placed to maximize the number of whole 
spheres within the GTV. There should be 3 cm between axial slices in which spheres are placed . Spheres extending outside of the GTV -5 structure will 
Protocol Version Date: 06/09/2023   Page 22 of 50 
 be cropped, and the resultant spherical volume will represent the high- dose 
target of the PTV_6670. 
 
 
A) Geometric representation of sphere placement. Yellow dots represent the 1.5 cm diameter PTV_6670 target vertices, and dotted line vertices represent the transposed target vertices from 
adjacent planes. Axial planes where vertices are placed are separated by 3 cm in -plane. Within a 
plan, vertices are separated by 6 cm center to center (4.5 cm edge to edge) in orthogonal axes, 
and 3√2 cm along the diagonal. B) Axial CT slices of a pelvic tumor  with the yellow outlined target 
vertices (PTV_6670) in each plane, red GTV_2000, and green PTV_2000. Magenta arrows denote cropped vertices in PTV_6670 that extend outside of the GTV_2000. C) Dose distribution after VMAT planning for the pelvic tumor with accompanying dose color wash legend.  
 
Normal structures : Relevant normal structures and their dose constraints are 
described in the table below. Each normal structure should be contoured in 
its entirety.  
 
5.5.2.2 Radiation Treatment Planning  
 
CT-based planning with tissue inhomogeneity correction is required. Daily 
IGRT is required.  Motion management strategies such as breath holding, 
respiratory gating, fluoroscopy, and MR-guided daily adaptive therapy are 
allowed.   
5.5.2.3 Planning Objectives and Normal Tissue Constraints  
 
The normal tissues in the table below are to be contoured in their entirety 
when present on the CT simulation scan.   
The following organs and doses are guidelines for the radiation treatment plan. Organ at risk tolerance levels cannot be exceeded . Under c overage 
of PTV targets in order to meet OAR constraints is allowed.  
 

Protocol Version Date: 06/09/2023   Page 23 of 50 
 • PTV _2000: at least 95% should be covered by 20 Gy. Keeping D max 
within the PTV _2000 and outside the PTV_6670 to less than 24 Gy 
is recommended  but not required. 
• PTV _6670: at least 95% should be covered by 66.7  Gy. A Dmin of at

 Dose Specifications 
Protocol Version Date: 06/09/2023   Page 24 of 50 
  
For Lattice SBRT , the daily prescription dose will be 20 Gy to be delivered to the 
PTV _2000 with a SIB  of 66.7 Gy to be delivered to the PTV _6670 over 5 fractions  
(4 Gy and 13.34 Gy to the PTV_2000 and PTV_6670 per day, respectively) . All 
doses will be prescribed to the periphery of the PTV s. In general, the prescription 
isodose line (generally 93- 98%) chosen should encompass at least 95% of the PTV . 
Under coverage of the PTV to m eet dose constraints is allowed.  
 
The maximum point dose, minimum point dose, and the mean dose to the PTV will also be reported.  
 
 Technical Factors  
 
The guidelines for VMAT in this trial will conform to the policies set by the Advanced Technology Consort ium (ATC) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  
Each of the target volumes and normal structures listed below must be delineated on each slice from the 3D planning CT in which that structure exists.   
 Radiation Q uality A ssurance 
 
Radiation quality assurance will be evaluated by a Medical Physics team. Prior to treatment, plan quality will be assessed with  an ion chamber and film -based 
dosimeters. 
 
 Patient -Reported Quality of Life Outcome and Toxicity Measures  
 
Symptom response and patient -reported quality of life will be measured using the  pain 
numeric rating scale,  PRO -CTCAE  (abridged as indicated in Appendix D) , PROMIS 
Global, Physical Function, Pain Interference, Anxiety, and Depression questionnaire  at the 
following time points: 
 
1. Within 2 weeks prior to the start of radiotherapy  
2. Within 3 weeks after completion of radiotherapy  
3. At 30 days after radiotherapy   
4. At 90 days after radiotherapy  
5. At 180 days after radiotherapy 
6. At 360 days after radiotherapy 
 
The patient reported outcomes m easures will be conducted using a computer -assisted 
interview program and may be done in person before/after a routine office visit or over the phone at the preference of the study participant. Patient reported outcomes may also be collected online.  
 
 Acqui sition of Blood for Research  
 Refer to Section 8.0. 
Protocol Version Date: 06/09/2023   Page 25 of 50 
  
 Definitions of Evaluability  
 
All patients enrolled on the study are evaluable for toxicity if they have received at least 
one fraction of radiation.  Patients are evaluated from first receiving study treatment until 
90 days  after the conclusion of treatment or death.  Participants who are consented but do 
not receive study treatment will be replaced.  
 
 Concomitant Therapy  and Supportive Care Guideline s 
 
Patients may not receive any concurrent systemic therapy with radiation. The interval from last receipt of systemic therapy to the initiation (or re -initiation) of systemic therapy will 
be at physician discretion. Supportive care will be consistent with  standards for palliative 
radiotherapy, directed by the treating physician.   
 Women of Childbearing Potential  
 
Women of childbearing potential (defined as women with regular menses, women  with 
amenorrhea, women with irregular cycles, women using a contraceptive method that 
precludes withdrawal bleeding , and w omen who have had a tubal ligation ) are required to 
have a negative serum/urine pregnancy test within  20 days prior to the first dose of 
radiation.  
 Female and male patients (along with their female partners) are required to use two forms of acceptable contraception, including one barrier method, during participation in the study 
and for 6 months following the last dose of radiation .  
 
If a patient is suspected to be pregnant, radiation  should be immediately discontinued.  In 
addition a positive urine test must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test.  If it is confirmed that the patient is not pregnant, the patient may resume therapy.  If a female patient or female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during therapy or within  6 months after the last dose of  radiation , the investigator must be notified in order 
to facilitate outcome follow -up. 
 
 Duration of Therapy  
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the patient’s health and/or the patient no longer wishes to c ontinue protocol therapy, the 
protocol therapy should be discontinued and the reason(s) for discontinuation documented in the case report forms.  
 In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue for  a 
maximum of 2 weeks or until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
• Documented and confirmed disease progression 
Protocol Version Date: 06/09/2023   Page 26 of 50 
 • Death  
• Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out continuation of study drug 
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient unable to 
receive further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  
• Suspected pregnancy  
• Serious non-compliance with the study protocol 
• Lost to follow -up 
• Patient withdraws consent  
• Investigator removes the patient from study  
• The Siteman Cancer Center decides to close the study  
 
Patients who prematurely discontinue treatment for any reason will still be followed as 
indicated in the study calendar. 
 
 Follow- up Specifications  
 
Patients will be followed at 14, 30, 90, 180, and 360 days after completion of radiotherapy. 
Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution  or stabilization of the adverse event.  Patients may be followed in- person during 
visits, medical records review, phone calls, office visits, and assessment of any other 
clinically relevant materials after completion of therapy.  
 
 Lost to Follow- Up 
 
A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she fails to return for  90 days 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study team.  The following actions must be taken if the participant fails to return to clinic for a required study visit: 
o The study team will attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit within 1-2 weeks  and counsel the participant on the importance of maintainin g 
the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the participant wishes to and/or sho uld 
continue in the study. 
o Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will 
make every effor t to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone 
calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the particip ant’s last known mailing 
address).  These contact attemp ts should be documented in the participant’s medical 
record or study file.  
o Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow- up. 
 
 
   
Protocol Version Date: 06/09/2023   Page 27 of 50 
 6.0 RADIATION THERAPY DOSE/DELAYS  MODIFICATIONS  
 
The planned course of radiation therapy is five fractions  delivered every other day  to each lesion. 
For plans unable to meet dose constraints to OARs, under coverage of the PTV in order to meet 
the constraints is recommended . Patients with delay ed treatment starts of any duration may be 
treated using existing or new plans at physician discretion. Continuance of treatment for delays 
while on- treatment will be at the discretion of the treating physician.

 11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
 Study Design  
 
This is a single arm study where 67 eligible patients with  non-hematologic malignancies  
patients with large tumors (≥ 4.5 cm) will undergo radiotherapy using Lattice SBRT . 
Lattice SBRT  will be prescribed to 20 Gy in 5 fractions delivered every other day with a 
LATTICE simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to 66.7 Gy in 5 fractions. Patients will be followed for 12 months after the completion of radio therapy for treatment effect and 
treatm ent-related toxicity assessment.  An exploratory study will analyze blood-based 
markers of treatment response, so blood will be drawn prior to and after completion of radiotherapy.  
 
 Study Endpoints  
 
The co-primary endpoint s are rate of local control of the treated (i.e. target) lesion at 6 
months, and proportion of patients with treatment related grade 3+ CTCAE v5.0 toxicity.  
Local control will be determined by RECIST 1.1 analysis of baseline compared with imaging at 6 months. Imaging may include CT scan, PET/CT, or MRI. It is strongly 
suggested that the same imaging modality is used between baseline and at every follow-up timepoint for staging of disease.   Importantly, there are limited available data to determine expected local control of large tumors af ter SBRT. Almost all studies have focused on tumors with average maximal 
diameter of only 5.5 cm corresponding to a tumor volume of approximately 87 cc. In such studies, local control rates are approximately 70 -85%.  In the pilot study of Lattice SBRT 
at Wa shington University, the median treated tumor volume was 435 cc (N=14). Likewise, 
these few studies of SBRT for large tumors report a grade 3+ toxicity rate of 5 -25%, 
varying based on tumor location.   Due to the lack of a reliable historical comparison, t he enrollment target was defined by 
clinical considerations as opposed to power calculations for comparison with a historical control. This study instead seeks to establish the expected local control rate at 6 months for 
patients with such large tumors  treated with Lattice SBRT. After discussing with internal 
and external stakeholders, we determined that a clinically reasonable bound on local control at 6 months would be 15%. Approximately 47 patients would be required to 
determine local control with a 95% confidence interval of +/ - 15% ; 67 patients will be 
enrolled to get 47 evaluable patients.  We anticipate that up to 30% of patients may not be evaluable for local control at 6 months and are accounting for this potential drop- out rate 
by enrolling 67 patients.  This is because patients with very large tumors needing palliative 
radiotherapy often have short survival.  Likewise, the study seeks to establish the expected grade 3+ treatment related toxicity rate for treatment of large tumors with lattice SBRT. The treatment will be considered safe if the grade 3+ treatment related toxicity rate is less than 2 0%, which is in line with prior 
studies of SBRT of large tumors .  
 
Protocol Version Date: 06/09/2023   Page 32 of 50 
 As secondary endpoints, this study will evaluate patient reported outcomes through 12 
months follow up. Comparisons of patient -reported outcomes such as pain in patients 
undergoing palliative radiotherapy are notoriously difficult. These can be impacted by the 
initial indication for palliative radiation (i.e. oligoprogression versus unco ntrolled 
symptom) , presence or absence of other tumors outside the target(s), subsequent therapies 
after treatment, and co -morbidities. This study will attempt to reduce this heterogeneity by 
studying the secondary endpoints within pre -specified subgroups. Additionally, this study 
will evaluate PROs using the reliable change index, which allows evaluation of the change of individual patient PROs of comparison to their own baseline.  
 
The RCI utilizes the known retest reliability and standard deviation of a test to calculate the standard error of measurement and standard error of the difference between scores [Jacobson, 1992]. This value represents the level of change associated with statistically significant change from baseline. RCI is calculated as follows: 
𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 =𝑥𝑥2− 𝑥𝑥1
𝑆𝑆𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 
Where x 2 – x 1 represents an individual’s change between timepoints. This can also be 
reported as a difference in population mean. S diff, the standard error of the difference 
between the two scores accounting for reliability of the test, is calculated as:  
𝑆𝑆𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 =�2(𝑆𝑆𝐸𝐸)2 
𝑆𝑆𝐸𝐸=  𝑠𝑠1�1−𝑟𝑟𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 
Where S E is the standard error of measurement of the test, s 1 is the standard deviation of 
the test results at the initial time point, and r xx is the test -retest reliability of the measure. 
The test -retest reliabilities of PROMIS domains used in this study have been previously 
evaluated in patients with musculoskeletal conditions and range from 0.85- 0.92 [Deyo, 
2016].  
 
The RCI will be calculated for each individual patient for pain score, PR O-CTCAE, and 
each PROMIS domain between baseline and the 3, 6, and 12 month time point s. In order 
for a change to be deemed statistically reliable at a 90% confidence interval, the Z -score of 
the RCI must be greater than 1.645. The 90% confidence interval is standard use in the literature when calculating RCI because it increases the sensitivity in detecting reliable 
change and defines a change which occurs in only 5% of healthy individuals in either 
direction [Stein, Gray, Schmitt, Hensel]. Changes that exceed this threshold in either direction are likely due to actual change rather than due to chance. Individual changes are reported as either significant increase, significant decrease, or no change.  
 
Mean RCI for each time- point and domain will be calcula ted to determine significant 
change on a population level for each sub-group. The S
diff for each domain will be used to 
calculate a minimum important change at each time- point based on a 90% confidence 
interval. Lastly, the proportion of individuals in each histology cohort group whose RCI 
indicated significant increase, significant decrease, or no change in PRO  scores will be 
reported.

 Data Analysis  
 
Demographic and clinical characteristics  including treatment toxicity  will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics. RECIST 1.1 will be used to determine local control per the 
protocol described in Appendix E. The RCI  will be used to compare the QoL scores 
between before and after treatment with Lattice SBRT .  
 
 Power Analysis and Sample Size  
 
Approximately 67 evaluable patients will be enrolled. The proposed sample size was 
chosen based on clinical considerations, to allow for establishment of an expected 6-month 
local control rate and treatment related grade 3+ CTCAE toxicity rate for treatment of very 
large tumors.  
 After discussing with internal and external stakeholders, we determined that a clinically reasonable bound on local control at 6 months would be 15%. Approximately 47 patients would be required to determine local control with a 95% confidence interval of +/ - 15%. 
However, patients with large tumors needing Lattice SBRT are expected to have a short median survival. Based on our prior experience, we expect 20- 30% of patients will 
complete Lattice SBRT but may be unevaluable for the primary endpoint. Enrolling 67 
patients with an up to 30% drop out rate would ensure at least 47 evaluable patients to 
create our clinically acceptable 95% CI estimate for local control at 6 months.  
 
 Accrual  
 
The rate of accrual for the study is expected to be about 4 patients per month. It is estimated 
67 eligible patients will be enrolled in  12 months.  
 
 Continuous Toxicity Monitoring using Pocock- type boundary  
 
The toxicities will be reviewed and monitored on a continuous basis. Early stopping of this trial will be based on the excessive Lattice SBRT treatment emergent severe adverse events (TSAE) of grade 3 or higher non- hematological rate. We assume the TSAE rate is expected 
~30% or less and a toxicity rate of 40% or more is not desired . Sequential boundaries will 
be used to monitor dose -limiting toxicity rate  after three patients are enrolled and evaluable 
for toxicity . The accrual will be halted if excessive numbers of T SAE are seen, that is, if 
the numbe r of T SAE is equal to or exceeds bn out of  n patients with full follow -up (see 
table  below ). This is a Pocock- type stopping boundary that yields the probability of 
crossing the boundary at most 0.3 when the rate of T SAE is equal to the acceptable rate of 
0.3 (Ivanova, Qaqish, and Schell 2005).  
  
Protocol Version Date: 06/09/2023   Page 34 of 50 
  
 
 Thus, based on the continuous monitoring algorithm for toxicity using Pocock-type 
boundary, the study will halt if excessive Lattice SBRT - related adverse events occur in 
the 3 of the first 3 patients, or 4 of the first 6, or 5 of the first 9, or 5 of the 10 patients has completed the trial.

 APPENDIX B: Definitions for Adverse Event Reporting  
 
A. Adverse Events (AEs)  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition: any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug- related.  
 
Grading:  the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website.  Attribu tion (relatedness), Expectedness, and Seriousness:  the definitions for the terms 
listed that should be used are those provided by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP).  A copy of this guidance can be fou nd on 
OHRP’s website:  
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html
 
 
B. Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition: any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused 
the adverse event.  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  “Suspected adverse reaction” implies a 
lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
 
C. Life-Threatening Adverse Event / Life Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition:  any advers e drug event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-
threatening” if, in the view of the investigator, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 D.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition:  an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the 
view of the investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
o Death  
o A life -threatening adverse event 
Protocol Version Date: 06/09/2023   Page 41 of 50 
 o Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitali zation  
o A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
o Any other important medical event that does not fit the criteria above but, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
 
E. Protocol Exceptions 
 
Definition: A planned change in the conduct of the research for one participant. 
 
F. Deviation 
 
Definition:  Any alteration or modification to the IRB -approved research without prospective 
IRB approval.  The term “research” encompasses all IRB -approved materials and documents 
including the detailed protocol, IRB application, consent form, recruitment materials, 
questionnaires/data collection forms, and any other information relating to the research study.  A minor or administrative deviation is one that does not have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or others or the scientific validity of the study.  
 A major deviation is one that does have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or others or the scientific validity of the study.

 APPENDIX E: MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT (RECIS T 1.1) 
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca 45:228- 247, 2009].  Changes in the largest  diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.    
 
RECIST 1.1  
 Target lesions :  The treated lesions (i.e. those defined as treatment targets by the radiation 
oncologist, GTVs)  should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
Imaging- based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless 
the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
 
Clinical lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they 
are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm diameter 
as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when 
they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable.  
 Conventional CT and MRI:   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions 
on CT scan based on the assumption that CT sl ice thickness is 5 mm or less.  If CT 
scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).    
Protocol Version Date: 06/09/2023   Page 47 of 50 
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and 
temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI  is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI 
is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline and 
the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath -
hold scanning techniques, if possible.  PET- CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a 
combined PET -CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with 
RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV 
and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST 
measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 Ultrasound:   Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not 
be used as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is 
advised.  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 Endoscopy, Laparoscopy:   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
 
FDG -PET:   While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is 
sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement 
CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).   
New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the 
following algorithm:  
 
Protocol Version Date: 06/09/2023   Page 48 of 50 
 • Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a 
sign of PD based on a new lesion. 
• No FDG- PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the 
positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease 
confirmed by CT, this is PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not 
confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow -up CT scans 
are needed to determi ne if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if 
so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  
If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of 
disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, 
this is not PD. 
• FDG- PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar 
to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to 
represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance 
should be prospectively described in the protocol and supported by disease -
specific medical literature for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
  
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an 
uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
Response Criteria  
 
Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete  Response (CR):   Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any 
pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non- target) must have 
reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 20% increase in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on stud y).  In addition 
to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  
 Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. 
 
 
Protocol Version Date: 06/09/2023   Page 49 of 50 
 Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criter ia.

*** In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non -target lesions may be 
accepted as disease progression.  
Note:  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic 
deterioration.”  Every effort should be mad e to document the objective progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment.

 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response:   The duration of overall response is 
measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR 
(whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   Duration of s table disease:   Stable disease is measured from the start of 
the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

2.0 Objectives  
The study will examine predictors, including peer versus professional care manager assignment, 
of treatment engagement after discharge from a mental health emergency visit.  The project 
period will b e structured around two aims, one quantitative and one qualitative. Each aim will 
seek to further the understanding of the patient, provider, and system -level barriers to, and 
facilitators of, treatment engagement after emergency department  (ED) discharge.  We will 
include randomization to peer versus professional care manager as one of the independent 
variables of interest .    
2.1 Aim 1: Use quantitative data from the study sample , including assignment 
to a peer versus professional care manager, to assess factors predicting 
patient engagement after a mental health emergency visit .   
2.2 Aim 2: Use qualitative interviews with patients and providers to understand 
stakeholder perspectives on patient engagement after a mental health 
emergency visi t.  
3.0 Background  
3.1 Eme rgency departments (EDs) serve a critical role as a safety net for the 
uninsured and medically disenfranchised.The growth of population -based 
models of care under the Affordable Care Act are providing an impetus to 
reduce uncesssary ED use and improve engag ement with outpatient 
care.1,2 Patients with mental disorders are among the highest users of 
emergency department services,3-10  with vis its characterized by long 
lengths of s tay, high intensity, and elevated rates of discharge to hospital 
settings.11  After discharge, fewer than half of these patients successfully 
transition to outpatient care, with high rates of readmission.12,13 Programs 
that allow  patients with mental disorders to successfully transition to 
outpatient care hold the potential not only to improve quality and 
outcomes of care for  mental disorders, but to free capacity within 
Emergency Departments to provide care for other urgent needs.14 
3.2 Despite the potential of care management programs to address transitions 
of care  in people with mental illness, it has been difficult to disseminate 
these models more broadly.15 One reason for this challenge in 
dissemination has been a shortage of mental health professionals who can 
fill these roles . There are acute shortages of mental health nurses, 
particularly in community -based, public sector settings.16  These problems 
are likely to worsen in coming years as the mental health nursing workforce 
ages.16  Similar shortages are seen for mental health social workers.17 There 
is now an opportunity to improve care and fill these gaps with a new group 
of mental health providers, certified peer specialists -- persons with a 
history of mental illness offering services to other individuals with mental 
disorders.18 Beginning in the 1990s, certified peer specialists began to be 
Protocol Title: Engaging Patients with Mental Disorders from the ED in Outpatient CARE: A 
Comparative Effectiveness Workforce Study of Peer Specialists vs. Professional Care Managers  
Page | 5  February  11, 2020  
 employed in providing peer support in community mental health settings.19 
Certified peer specialists help other patients improve outcomes by 
modeling successful behaviors and coping strategies, and by guiding them 
to more effectively utilize community resources.  Nationwide, there are 
more than 10,000 peer support specialists,20 and 32 State Medicaid 
programs recognize and reimburse mental health services delivered by 
certified peer specialists, helping ensure the financial sustainability of 
programs using these providers.21   
3.3 The existing literature indicates: 1. The  potential effectiveness of care 
management delivered by mental health professionals in improving 
treatment engagement and reducing inpatient readmissions; and 2. The 
fact that certified peer specialists appear to be able to deliver an array of 
mental heal th services of similar or better quality as mental health 
professionals.  However, there have been no studies comparing certified 
peer specialists to professionals in interventions to increase treatment 
engagement and reduce readmissions.  This study will be the first to 
examine the potential benefits and tradeoffs between these two groups of 
providers.   
3.4 The study results will provide insights on the comparative effectiveness of 
professional and peer care managers in improving linkage to and 
engagement with  outpatient care, as well as the potential mechanisms by 
which engagement occurs. The results will help patients to address the 
question “What are the best ways for me to engage with my mental health 
care?” It will help Emergency Room Providers to address the question 
“How can I most effectively reduce the likelihood of my patients being 
readmitted?”  For Community Mental Health providers, it can help address 
the question “How can I help my patients to more effectively engage with 
care in our facilities?”  And for policymakers, “How can we improve 
transitions of care between Emergency Departments and inpatient 
services?”  “How can certified peer specialists be used most effectively in 
the evolving mental health workforce?”  
4.0 Study Intervention / Design  
4.1 The st udy use d a multi -site randomized trial study design across 9 
Emergency Departments in South Carolina with telepsychiatry programs  
and 8 matched community mental health centers (CMHC) ; each CHMC site 
had one professional care manager and one peer specialist  care manager 
to deliver the intervention.   
4.2 The Coordination, Access, Referral and Evaluation (CARE) intervention is a 
manualized care management program designed to improve follow up and 
treatment engagement for patients after admission to psychiatric 
emergency rooms.  It is built on the PCARE intervention, which was 
designed to improve treatment engagement and treatment outcomes for 
Protocol Title: Engaging Patients with Mental Disorders from the ED in Outpatient CARE: A 
Comparative Effectiveness Workforce Study of Peer Specialists vs. Professional Care Managers  
Page | 6  February  11, 2020  
 patients in outpatient mental health settings.22,23  The primary 
enhancement to the PCARE intervention used to develop the CARE 
intervention was to add an initial treatment linkage call during the 
Emergency Department stay.  Professional and peer  care managers  
deliver ed the same intervention.  
4.3 Care Managers: Licensed nurses/social workers /counselors  or certified 
peer specialists working at the 8 state -funded CMHCs served as care 
managers. For each emergency department, one professional and one peer 
care manager w as identified at the associated CMHC and dedicated to the 
project .  
 Training for the professional and peer care managers was 
identical; however, separate sessions were held to prevent 
contamination. The training program included a description of the 
overall s tudy design and modules for each of the key domains 
covered in the intervention. Care managers received the CARE 
training manual and demonstrated adherence and competency 
through role -play scenarios.  
 Separate quarterly supervision calls were held with pee r and 
professional care managers to reinforce key elements of the 
intervention.  
5.0 Intervention Procedures Involved  
5.1 Treatment Linkage:  After a “warm handoff” from the research interviewer 
who screened the participant  into the study, the care manager connect ed 
with the participant for the Treatment Linkage Call. During the call, the care 
manager began to establish rapport and collect ed contact information 
including telephone and address . The care manager also ascertain ed the 
reason for the ED visit and set an  initial appointment with the care 
manager at the CMHC nearest the ED within two weeks .  
5.2 Initial Visit: The purpose of the initial visit at the CMHC was to take a 
history of the participant and began the process of identifying and 
addressing barriers to engagement in care. The care manager then 
review ed the roles of the participant and care manager, emphasizing the 
importance of the collaborative relationship between them. The care 
manager and participant jointly examine d the reasons for the ED visit , 
identified attitudinal and logistical barriers to care , and set goals to address 
those barriers .  
5.3 Follow up visits: After the initial visit, the care manager and patient met in -
person monthly, with telephone calls in between. The goal of these 
meetings was to  monitor patients’ engagement in care and continue to 
help address attitudinal and logistical barriers to care  and discuss progress 
Protocol Title: Engaging Patients with Mental Disorders from the ED in Outpatient CARE: A 
Comparative Effectiveness Workforce Study of Peer Specialists vs. Professional Care Managers  
Page | 7  February  11, 2020  
 on goals . This pattern of visits and calls continued for the first 6 months of 
treatment with less frequent visits or calls from months 7 to 12.  
6.0 Study Timelines  
6.1 Project Duration: October 2016 – March 2020  
6.2 Enrollment period: April 2017 – May 201 9 
6.3 Individual subject’s participation : 12 months  
 Participant enrolled in project and randomized to peer or professional 
case manager prior to ED discharge.  
 Treatment Linkage: Within 72 hours of enrollment,  the care manager 
made initial contact  with participant to establish rapport, obtain 
contact inform ation, ascertain the reason for ED visit, and set initial 
appointment with care manager at nearest CMHC within two weeks.  
 Initial Visit: Within 30 days of enrollment, the care manager and 
participant met at the CMHC to take a history of the participant an d 
began the process of identifying and addressing barriers to 
engagement in care. The care manager then review ed the roles of the 
participant and care manager, emphasizing the importance of the 
collaborative relationship between them .  
 Follow up visits: After the initial visit, the care manager and patient 
met in -person monthly, with telephone calls in between. The goal of 
these meetings was to monitor patients’ engagement in care and 
continue to help address attitudinal and logistical b arriers to care.  
7.0 Subject Population

 Palmetto Health Richland Hospi tal ED and Columbia area CMHC in 
Columbia, SC  
9.2 Identification and Recruitment: Emergency room telepsychiatrists, Mental 
Health Liaisons, nurses, and other key ED staff refer red patients admitted 
for a primary diagnosis of a mental disorder for assessment of potential 
inclusion in the study.  A trained research interviewer assess ed participants 
for potential study eligibility, either in person, telephone or via the site’s 
high speed telepsychiatry video connection.  
9.3 Screening by research staff involve d assess ment of all inclusion and 
exclusion criteria .  
 Document date of birth to ensure that patients are 18 years of age or older  
 Confirm the primary diagnosis of a mental illness with the person who 
identified the patient (nurse, liaison, staff, or telepsychiatr ist) 
 Confirm that the patient lives within the CMHC’s catchment area  
 Determine that the patient speaks fluent English  
 Confirm that the patient will be discharged for care at the participating 
CMHC  
10.0 Consent Process  
10.1 Only trained members of the project partici pate d in the informed consent 
dialogue and/or signing of the informed consent document.   
10.2 Trained members of the project assess ed for cognitive impairment during 
the consent process using a 6 -item, validated screener and an Informed 
Consent Quiz  (see Appendix C for Informed Consent document and 
Protocol Title: Engaging Patients with Mental Disorders from the ED in Outpatient CARE: A 
Comparative Effectiveness Workforce Study of Peer Specialists vs. Professional Care Managers  
Page | 9  February  11, 2020  
 Informed Consent Quiz) . Participants who score d <3 on the cognitive 
screener or d id not score 100% on the Informed Consent Quiz were not 
eligible to participate in the project . Inability to complete either  of these 
measures could impede  capacity to provide informed consent as well as 
effectively participate in the intervention.  
10.3 The procedures of the study and the informed consent document were 
thoroughly reviewed with the participant in both verbal and wri tten form 
by a trained study staff member. Only those participants demonstrating 
adequate comprehension were consented and enrolled in the project.  
 Informed consent was obtained in a private room in the ED or in 
the telepsychiatry room over HIPAA complian t video 
conferencing. In the latter case, oral consent was obtained via 
telepsychiatry and ED administrative staff obtain ed a signed 
documentation of consent.  
11.0 Withdrawal of Participants  
11.1 Participants were able to  choose to withdraw from the project at any time.  
11.2 Participants who chose to withdraw from the project were  no longer 
contacted by the study team or interventionist for project -related 
activities . Participants ha d the opportunity to designate preference for 
continued data collection in the event of withdrawal during the consent 
process.   
12.0 Risks to Participants  
12.1 Participants may experience discomfort in answering questions from the 
study team or interventionist.  
12.2 Participants may experience inconvenience when traveling to/from 
scheduled project visits.  
13.0 Potential Benefits to Participants  
13.1 Participants may not benefit personally from the project.  
13.2 Taking part in the pro ject may help to improve participant’s mental hea lth 
care.  
14.0 Qualitative Interviews  
14.1 In-depth  interviews were conducted over the telephone with 30 pa tients 
and 15 care managers to examine the main factors influencing  patients’  
transitions of and engagement in care.     
14.2 Patients were invited to participate in the qualitative interviews after they 
had been in the study for at least 6 months. Additionally, all active care 
managers were invited to take part in an interview.  
Protocol Title: Engaging Patients with Mental Disorders from the ED in Outpatient CARE: A 
Comparative Effectiveness Workforce Study of Peer Specialists vs. Professional Care Managers  
Page | 10  February  11, 2020  
 14.3 Patients provided informed consent either verbally after the researcher 
read the consent form to them (a paper copy was provided for their 
records by mail) or by signing and returning a consent form by mail. Care 
managers were emailed a consent form, which they sig ned and returned 
through secure email or fax.  
14.4 The study team developed two semi -structured interview guides —one for 
patients and one for care managers. The patient interview guides included 
questions on their reasons for going to the E D, connection to and  
attendance at the CMHC, barriers and facilitators to attending their 
appointments, and interactions with mental health providers. The care 
manager interview guide included questions on their assessment of their 
patients’ barriers and facilitators to trans itioning from the E D and 
engagement in care at the CMHC, as well as questions on interactions with 
patients.  
14.5 Interviews were conducted by phone. All qualitative interviews were 
digitally recorded, de -identified and assigned a unique identifier, 
transcribed  verbatim, and reviewed for accuracy.  
15.0 Data Sources  
15.1 South Carolina’s Integrated Data Warehouse: The South Carolina Revenue 
and Fiscal Affairs Office (RFA) has developed over a period of many years a 
comprehensive health and human services data. The RFA data  warehouse 
pulls client -specific data from an array of health and human services 
facilities, agencies and organizations and makes possible the integration of 
data from disparate sources at the client level by means of an internally 
assigned unique tracking  number. State legislation requiring reporting of 
both private sector and public sector client -level data ensures that the data 
are comprehensive and complete.  The current data warehouse includes 
information from private sector systems (e.g., hospitals, su rgery centers, 
home health), state agency systems (e.g., Medicaid, mental health, 
substance abuse, criminal justice), and not -for-profit systems (e.g., free 
clinics, community health centers).  For this study, data were  de-identified 
by use of an encrypted  tracking number and were  stored on a secure 
Microsoft SQL Server. All data storage and access procedures are HIPAA 
compliant. The study team has a long history of collaboration with the 
South Carolina’s RFA in prior projects, with high data quality and 
completeness of study data.  
15.2 The Area Health Resource File  was used to identify county -level community 
predictors of treatment engagement.

 16.0 Outcomes and Data Analysis   
16.1 Aim 1 Analytic Strategy: First, bivariate models were  created to examine 
differences between each of the patient, provider, and system -level factors 
and each of the dependent variables.  Next, linear regression models were 
used to  examine the association between factors within each of these 
levels to each of  the study outcomes. Finally, hierarchical linear models 
examine d the association between each of the independent and 
dependent variables simultaneously including all of the patient, provider, 
and system -level predictors .  
16.2 Service Use  Outcomes :   
 At least one outpatient visit for a mental health problem in the 30 
days after ED discharge.  
 Proportion of scheduled outpatient visits attended  in the  6 
months after ED discharge.  
 Emergency Department re -admissions  in the  6 months  after ED 
discharge.  
 All-cause inpatient admissions  in the  6 months  after ED discharge.  
16.3 Effect Size Estimates for 30 -day Follow up After ED Discharge:

16.4 Aim 2 Analytic Strategy: Transcripts were  uploaded into the qualitative 
software package MaxQDA for data management and analysis. The study 
team developed an initial codebook using topics from the interview guides 
and categories of barriers to care from the literature.25 After the study 
team jointly coded a group of transcripts by hand to align application of 
codes, all transcripts were coded by two members of the study team. The 
lead qualitative researcher reviewed all coding to ens ure reliability and 
updates were made when necessary. Qualitative data were analyzed using 
thematic analysis, with a focus on comparing themes across the patient 
and care manager  groups.26 We examine d patients’ experiences with 
transitions of care from the  ED to outpatient treatment and providers’ 
experiences of supporting care transitions and engagement. We identified 
main themes related to  the barriers and facilitators to patients accessing 
and engaging in outpatient mental health treatment at the patient , 
provider, and healthcare systems level .

 17.0 Data Safety Monitoring  
17.1 A three -member Data Safety Monitoring Board was assembled bi -annually 
to review study recruitment and potential adverse events.  
17.2 Semi -annual reports detailing information about the project description, 
baseline demographic characteristics, and retention and disposition of 
study participants were  presented to the DSMB and IRB for review . 
18.0 Provisions to Protect Privacy and Confidential ity  
18.1 All study data was entered at time of screening and enrollment in a Redcap 
study database. Redcap is a secure, HIPAA compliant, web -based server, 
can only be accessed by authorized project personnel, and encrypted at 
rest by a product called GAZZANG.  
18.2 Access to and location of Personally Identifiable Information was granted 
to authorized users on the principle of least privilege .  
18.3 Unique identifiers were  generated for all study participants; these were  the 
only identifiers used in files for data entry a nd analysis. Identifying 
information such as name, address, telephone number was stored in 
password -protected computer files or locked file cabinets .  
18.4 The South Carolina Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office (RFA) provide d a 
dataset for all service use claims for the participant via secure, encrypted 
file transfer protocol ( FTP). The data was stored on a password -protected, 
HIPAA -compliant server at Emory University.  
18.5 Participant interactions with project  staff, including screening and 
enrollment procedures , and with interventionists , including calls and visits , 
were held in a private, closed door office, away from clinical care areas.  
18.6 Participants were informed that the agreement to participate in the project 
does not obligate participants to accept any part icular treatment and that 
participants were free to refuse to answer questions and/or withdraw from  
any part of the project.  
19.0 Advisory Board  
19.1 The Advisory Board overs aw key study decisions and was involved in the  
planning for program sustainability and dis semination of results.  
19.2 The board include d five members from consumer organizations, provider 
groups, and healthcare systems management.  
19.3 The Advisory Board convene d for annual conference calls to review 
materials and make decisions regarding study procedu res, implementation, 
and results.

 20.0 Dissemination  
20.1 The final analytic data file was de-identified using the “Safe Harbor” 
method outlined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 
order to meet standard §164.514(a) to make the data HIPAA compliant 
(https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for -professionals/privacy/special -topics/de -
identif ication/index.html ). Specifically, any identifiers of the individual, 
relative, employers, or household members of the individual were 
removed. A full list of the 18 identifiers to be removed under the “Safe 
Harbor” method can be found at the above link. T his HIPAA compliant data 
file is fully analyzable and will be made available upon request. All analytic 
code used in the final report will be provided upon request along with 
codebooks to accompany the de -identified analytic data file.

Title : Engaging Patients in Care  (EPIC)  
 
Introduction  
You are being asked  to take part  in a study  of a new care navigation program. This opportunity 
is offered to people  who talked to a psychiatris t by video phone call in the  Emergency Room, 
and who were asked to make an appointment at  the Community Mental Health Center. This 
form  will tell you everything you need to think about before you decide  to take part.  
Participation is entirely your choice. If you decide to participate , you can change your mind 
later on and stop participating . Joining or not joining  the study will not have any effect on your 
treatment . Before making your decision , carefully read this form, or have it read to you . Ask 
questions about anything that is not clear . You will be given a copy of this form.   
 
Study Overview  
This study provides ‘care navigation’. Care navigation is a service that helps guide patients with 
their health care. If you decide to take part in this  study, care navigation will be provided to you 
at the Community Mental Health Center, and will be in addition to your regular care and 
treatment.  A care navigator can be a professional case manager, like a social worker, a nurse, or 
a psychologist. A care  navigator can also be someone who is not a professional, called a “peer 
support specialist”. A peer support specialist is someone who has a mental health problem and 
has gotten treatment.  Peer support specialists have recovered from their mental illness and 
now help other patients to succeed with their care and recovery. In this study, we will compare 
patients who have a professional care navigator with patients who have a peer support 
specialist. Care Navigation  will take place at the Community Mental Health Center that is 
closest to the Emergency Department  you visited. We plan to have 1000 people take part in the 
study  over the next  4 years.  
 
Study Procedures : What will happen if you agree to be part of this study?  
Screening:  
If you decide to take part  you will sign this form giving your permission. We  will ask you some 
questions to make sure the study is right for you. We will also ask for  your contact information . 
Then you will be randomly assigned (like tossing a coin)  to have care navigation with  either  a 
peer support specia list or with a professional  case manager at the Community Mental Health 
Center . We will put you in touch  with  the care navigator  by phone while you are still in the ER . 
After briefly introducing him self or herself, the care nav igator will schedule an appointment to 
meet with you in person. This first meeting will take place  at the Community Mental Health 
Center , on the day of your first appointment,  A few days before your first appointment , your 
care navigator will call or text  you with  an appointment reminder.

Comparative Effectiveness Workforce Study of Peer Specialists vs. Professional Care Managers  
Page | 19  February  11, 2020  
 Clinic Visits:  
First visit  : At the first visit to the clinic, y our care navigator  will talk with you for about 30 
minutes and ask you about your mental health history and  your  symptoms,  the reasons for your 
recent emer gency room  visit, and any difficulties you have getting the care you need .  
 
Months 1 -6: During the first 6 months, you will meet in person with your care navigator  once a 
month. These monthly in -person meetings will take about 20 minutes each time. In bet ween 
these monthly visits, your care navigator will speak with you by phone. These visits and phone 
calls are  designed to help you participate in treatment , manage your mental health better, and 
overcome problems or issues that may affect  attending your me ntal health appointments.  You 
will be compensated for your effort with a  $20 gift card for  each of the 6 in -person visit.   
 
Months 7 -12: During months 7 -12 there are no planned, in -person meetings with your care 
navigator but he/she will call you monthly during months 7 -12 to check on you.  
 
Study Interviews:  
There will be 3 study interviews. The first interview will be done by phone eith er a few days 
after you have left the Emergency Room, or by phone at your first visit to the Mental Health 
Clinic. The other two interviews will be done by phone with a study staff member from Emory 
University. The se interviews  will take about 30-45 minute s and you will be asked questions  
about your mental health care, your mental health medications, substance use history, and any 
problems you have with getting mental health care . You will be compensated for your time and 
effort with a $50 gift card for each interview you complete.   
 
Risks and Discomforts  
We do not think there are any  significant risks or discomforts related to this study, but there 
may be possible  risks that we don’t yet know about . Some participants could get  tired during 
the interviews. If you get tired, you can take a break at any time.  You do not have to answer 
question s you do not want  to answer. There is a minor risk of a loss of confidentiality. All of the 
informat ion that you give us is private and we w ill do everything we can to protect your 
information, in ways that  we talk about  later in this form .  
 
Benefits   
Taking part in this program  may  or may  not benefit you personally, but we may learn new 
things that will help other  patients in the future . Taking part in the program  may help to 
improve your mental health care and  could possibly  reduce problems and issues that m ight 
prevent you from getting the care  you need. The results of th e study  of the care navigation 
program  will be used to decide whe ther this sort of program is helpful for patients.  
Costs  
There will be no additional costs for participating in the project. Your insurance will be billed for 
services you get at the mental health center.  
 
Compensation  
Interviews: You will get a $50 gift card for completing the 3 study interviews.

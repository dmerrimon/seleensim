Background  
1. Provide the scientific background, rationale and relevance of this project.   
The p urpose of the study is to describe glucose variability in patients with Type 1 Diabetes who have had an 
islet transplant. Patients who have an Islet Transplantation may have several outcomes including time when 
insulin is not required followed in some case s by additional insulin for glucose control as patients get further 
away from transplantation.  It is unclear what role automated insulin delivery systems will have in addressing glucose variability in this group of patients who may have some amount of islet function. As a precursor to understanding ways in which automated insulin delivery systems may need to be adapted, we propose to gather data on glucose variability  and insulin regimens in individuals who have undergone an islet 
transplantation.   
Object ives/Hypothesis  
To describe glucose variability in individuals who have had an islet transplantation.

Study Procedures -Biomedical Research  
1.  What will be done in this protocol?    
Visit 1: Screening Visit.   
All subjects will be consented and receive a history and physical. Subject exclusion will be at the discretion of the investigator based on study inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
At the Sc reening Visit, the  following  procedure s will be p erfor med / c riteria will be  checked and do cument ed: 
1. Signed and dated informed consent  
2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria  
3. Demographics (date of birth, gender, race and ethnicity)  
4. Medical history  
5. Details of the diabetic history  such as  duration of disease (number of years), diagnosis details, current 
treatment (including basal rates or basal insulin dose(s), carbohydrate ratios, insulin sensitivity factors, target glucose , average total daily insulin, history of DKA, history of severe hypoglycemia, and self -
monitoring blood glucose values)  
6. Surgical history  
7. Menstrual history (females) and Sexual Activity/Contraception (females)  
8. Allergies  
9. Medications and supplements  
10. Social h istory including drinking, smoking, and drug habits  
11. Physical examination  
12. Weight and height 
13. Vital signs  
14. Pregnancy test - either urine or qualitative serum HCG in women with childbearing potential. If not 
performed, document reason (surgically sterile, postmenopausal) . Result must be negative.  
Blood testing  will be obtained but will not be reviewed for exclusion criteria.   Labs may be obtained at local 
laboratory (i.e. LabCorp) after consent has been obtained.  
• HbA1c assessment via blood draw or fingerst ick and DCA2000 or equivalent NGSP -certified 
point -of-care method (value -4 weeks prior to screening acceptable)  
• Comprehensive chemistry panel  (within 6 months of screening appointment)  
•  
If a study subject has had a recent physical exam (less than 6 months ) and blood work done (within 6  month s), 
the study physician will have the discretion to repeat any test as needed. Once all results of the screening evaluations are available, a decision will be made to determine the subject’s eligibility for the study or if one 
or more parts of the screening will have to be repeated. If at the first screening or repeat screening an exclusionary condition is identified, the study subject will be excluded from participation and referred to their primary care physician as ne eded. If the study subject is pregnant, the study physician will discuss the results 
of the blood test with the subject, and the subject will be asked to seek confirmation of the test and the 
appropriate medical care. The total amount of blood to be withdr awn during the screening visit is ~22 cc. The

Version Date: 04/05/18 
Page Number: 4 of 6 screening visit will last approximately 2 hours. If the subject cannot schedule Visit 2 within 16 weeks of 
screening, screening labs, vital signs, and recent medical illness/medications may  be re -evaluated. The  study 
physician will have the discretion to repeat any test as needed.  
If a subject meets all the study criteria, he/s he will be enrolled in the trial. Visit 2 may be completed at the 
conclusion of Visit 1 if all eligibility requirements are met.  
 All subjects will also be given instructions to avoid /limit  acetaminophen prior to the use of the  study CGM  or 
to reschedule their study intervention if they require acetaminophen, as there is potential for interference with glucose oxidase systems for measuring  glucose such as the CGM.  
 Visit 2: Study Equipment Placement & Training  and Data Collection Period . Visit 1 and 2 can be done on the 
same day. All subjects will receive training on the use of the study  continuous glucose monitor (CGM)  which is 
a commercially available device (e.g. Dexcom CGM). Subjects will be asked use their personal glucometer and glucose strips for the duration of the trial.  Subjects will be asked to bring their personal laptops to this 
appointment if he/she is agr eeable to placing  commercially available software  on the laptop to facilitate 
download ing data from the CGM and insulin pump . This software will permit the study team to access the 
data remotely.   
Continuous Glucose Monitor Training  
1. An outpatient visit w ill be scheduled for training on the study CGM.  
2. Female subjects of childbearing potential will perform a urine pregnancy test, unless Visit 2 follows immediately after Visit 1. If the test is positive, the subject will discontinue study participation. The  subject 
will be asked to seek confirmation of the test and the appropriate medical care.  
3. The subject’s insulin pump (if using one) , subject’s glucometer  and study CGM receiver  (if using one)  will 
be set using atomic clocks as a reference.  
4. The subject will be supervised during the initial CGM sensor placement. A CGM sensor will be inserted into fatty tissue under the skin and will be replaced per manufacturer directions  (e.g. 7 days for the Dexcom G5 
CGM).  
5. If the CGM device experiences a sensor failure while at home, the subject will replace the sensor. The study team will be available for questions or will provide any necessary guidance.  
6. The subject will be taught how to calibrate the CGM per manufacturer’s guidelines. The subject will be asked to perform all required calibrations with fingerstick glucose meas urements . 
7. The subject will be taught to look for skin irritation after sensor removal.  
8. The subject will be reminded to avoid /limit  products per CGM manufacturer guidelines (e.g. avoid  
acetaminophen 24 hours prior to wearing the Dexcom G5 CGM and while the CGM is in use ). Subject who 
do require acetaminophen will be asked to not to use the CGM value s for treatment decisions for 24 hours 
after taking the medicatio n.   
9. If the subject requires an MRI/CT or diathermy, the sensor will be removed from the patient and the reason for removal will be noted. This will not be an adverse event.  
10. The outpatient visit will last approximately 1- 2 hours depending on prior knowledge of  the equipment.  
11. The subject will be given an instruction sheet with 24 -hour contact information of the research team to 
address any problems or questions.  
12. Unlimited additional appointments and telephone calls to the study team and study physician will be available.

Page Number: 5 of 6 Glucometer Training  
1. The subject will be instructed that all fingersticks should be preceded by hand washing with warm water 
and a dry towel. The subject will be instructed to obtain fingerstick, avoiding alternative sites, when obtaining blood glucose (BG) values. The first drop will be discarded. The second hanging drop will be used to measure the glucose level.  
2. The subject will be asked to obtain BG fingerstick required for calibrations. Any additional BG tests 
normally done by the participant s hould continue without interruption.  
 Data Collection Period  
1. Subject will collect data for a minimum of 28 days  but may continue for up to 3 months.  
2. The CGM  and insulin administration  will be analyzed by the study team. Special emphasis will be noted to 
the study subject that all meal information (i.e. carbohydrate quantity, insulin and SMBG) must be recorded in their insulin pump  if possible . 
3. If using Multiple Daily Injections (MDI) , subjects will be asked to record injections  of insulin using an 
availab le commercial application such as Dexcom Mobile App or MySugr app. This app will be placed on 
the subjects’ personal cell phone . A de -identified study email address will be used to establish the account.  
The study team will access this data and download the data from this account.  
4. The subject will be instructed on how to download the equipment. The subject will be asked to provide downloaded data periodically during the data collection period (approximately one time per week) using a web -based diabetes management system (e.g. Diasend, Carelink, etc.) and local diabetes device 
management software (e.g. Dexco m Studio). The study team will review subject data to ensure proper 
data collection. Study team will review quantity and quality of the da ta. Additional download request s may 
occur depending upon the quality of the data collected.  
5. If the subject is unable to provide the downloaded data from home, the subject will be asked to return to the office so the study team can assist them.  
6. The subjec t may return to the office at any time for additional support.  
7.  A Hemoglobin A1c test may be requested at the conclusion of the Data Collection Period.  
 
 
2. If this protocol involves study treatment, explain how a subject will be transitioned from study 
treatment when they have completed their participation in the study.   
The subject will resume their usual standard of care once study procedures are completed. 
 
Subject Compliance with Study Procedures  
1.  Explain how the study team will monitor the subject for compliance with the study procedures.  
Study team will assess compliance through evaluation of device downloads/uploads.  
 
2.  Describe criteria for when a subject is considered to be non- compliant with study procedures.   
Study subject who has more than 50 % missing data during data collection period. Subject may be 
asked to repeat data collection period if insufficient data is a vailable.

4 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Study Design  
 
This is a singl e-arm non- randomized phase II study evaluating the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in 
cancer patients who have documented inactivating mutations in TSC1 , TSC2 , or activating 
MTOR  mutations  in their cancers.  
 
1.2 Primary Objectives  
 
1) Evaluate the clinical benefit of everolimus, defined as objective response (RECIST 
1.1) in patients with tumors that have been confirmed  prior to study entry  to have 
TSC1 , TSC2 , or M TOR  mutations.  
 
1.3 Secondary Objectives  
 1) Perform immunohistochemical analysis and whole exome sequencing on all  study 
patients to examine correlations between other genetic and genomic events and response. 
2) Assess duration of response, progression -free survival, overall survival, and toxicity. 
 
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Agent(s)  
 
2.1.1 Everolimus  
 
Everolimus is a novel derivativ e of rapamycin. It has been in clinical development 
since 1996 as an immunosuppressant in solid organ transplantation. Everolimus is approved in Europe and other global markets (trade name: Certican®) for cardiac and renal transplantation, and in the Unite d States (trade name: Zortress®) for the 
prevention of organ rejection of kidney transplantation. 
 
Everolimus was developed in oncology as Afinitor® and was approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in 2009. In 2010, Afinitor® received United States  (US) 
approval for patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis (TSC). Everolimus is also available as Votubia® in the European Union (EU) for patients with SEGA associated with TSC. Afinitor® was approved for  “progressive pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) in patients with 
unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease” in 2011 in various countries, including the US and Europe. In 2012 Afinitor® received approval for the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced hormone receptor -positive, HER2- negative 
breast cancer (advanced HR+ BC) in combination with exemestane, after failure of treatment with letrozole or anastrozole. Furthermore, in 2012, Afinitor® received 
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 5 approval for the treatment of adult patients with TSC who have renal angiomyolipoma 
not requiring immediate surgery. 
Approximately 30,582 cancer patients have been treated with everolimus as of 30 -Sep-
2013: 
• 16,671 patients in Novartis-sponsored clinical trials 
• 1,911 patients in the individual patient supply program 
• More than 12,000 patients in investigator -sponsored studies. 
 
In addition, healthy volunteer subjects and non- oncology subjects with hepatic 
impairment have participated in clinical pharmacology studies.  
 Mechanism of Action:  
 
Everolimus is a derivative of rapamycin which acts as a signal transduction inhibitor. Everolimus selectively inhibits mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), specifically targeting the mTOR -raptor signal transduction complex known as mTORC1. mTOR is 
a key serine-threonine kinase in the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade, which is known to be 
dysregulated in a wide spectrum of human cancers (1). 
Everolimus is being investigated as an anticancer agent based on its potential to act directly on the t umor cells by inhibiting tumor cell growth and proliferation; and 
indirectly by inhibiting angiogenesis leading to reduced tumor vascularity (via potent inhibition of tumor cell VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) production and VEGF -induced proliferation of endothelial cells). 
 
Rationale for Starting Dose  
Everolimus has been approved for the treatment of ER positive/HER2 negative breast 
cancer following failure of aromatase inhibitors, for advanced RCC, for pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumors and renal  angiomyolipoma at a dose of 10 mg daily.  This dose 
will be administered in this study.  
 
Safety Profile  
 
As of September 30
th 2011, 18,730 cancer patients have been treated with everolimus.  
The frequency and severity of side effects are available from th e prescribing 
information pamphlet for physicians:

Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 6 2.2 Study Disease/Rationale for the Study  
 
At the cellular and molecular level, Everolimus acts as a signal transduction inhibitor. It 
selecti vely inhibits mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), a key protein kinase 
which regulates cell growth, proliferation and survival. The mTOR kinase is mainly 
activated via the phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase (PI3- Kinase) pathway through 
AKT/PKB and the protein complex made of the gene products of the two genes which 
cause tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/TSC2). Mutations in these components or in PTEN, a negative regulator of PI3- kinase, may result in dysregulation of mTOR. 
Abnormal functioning of various components of this signaling pathway contributes to the pathophysiology of numerous human cancers. Various preclinical models have confirmed the role of this pathway in tumor development (2). 
The main known functions of mTOR include acting as a sensor of mitogens, growth 
factors and energy and nutrient levels;  and it f acilitates cell -cycle progression from G1-
S phase i n appropriate growth conditions (3).   
The PI3K/mTOR pathway is frequently dysregulated in many human cancers, and 
oncogenic transformation may sensitize tumor cells to mTOR inhibitors.  PI3-kinase 
mutations have been reported in the primary tumor in 10- 20% of human colorectal and 
other cancers (4, 5).  The loss of PTEN protein, either through gene deletion or 
functional silencing (promoter hypermethylation), is reported in approximately 60% of primary human colorectal cancers and  many other cancer types (6).  The mTOR 
pathway is involved in the production of pro- angiogenic factors (i.e., VEGF) and 
inhibition of endothelia l cell growth and proliferation.  Through inactivating eukaryotic 
initiation factor 4E binding proteins and activating the 40S ribosomal S6 kinases (i.e., 
p70S6K1), mTOR regulates protein translation, including the HIF -1 proteins. Inhibition 
of mTOR is expected to lead to decreased expression of HIF -1. 
 Several clinical stu dies have now been reported in which everolimus has shown clinical 
benefit for patients with cancers with mutations in TSC1 or TSC2.  Randomized clinical trials in patients with the genetic disorder Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) who have tumors in the brain, subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, or renal 
angiomyolipoma, have shown benefit in response to everolimus treatment (7, 8) .  
PEComas, a sarcoma related to angiomyolipoma, but occurring in non- TSC patients 
and usually due to mutations in TSC2, have also shown benefit including sustained 
complete responses while on everolimus (9, 10) .  Finally, a recent report described a 
clinical trial of everolimus for bladder cancer,  in which one patient had a sustained 
complete clinical response lasting over 2 years  (11).  That patient was shown to have a 
TSC1 inactivating mutation in her cancer.  Notably, other bladder cancer patients on that trial whose cancers also had mutations in TSC1 had transient minor responses.  However, the majority of patients on the trial had no mutations in TSC1, and showed progressive disease.  Both TSC1 and TSC2 mutations and mTOR activating mutations 
have been identified in a set of 6 extreme responders to Everolimus out of 300 patients with renal cell carcinoma treated at Memorial Sloan Ketterin g (12 ).  Furthermore, an 
activating MTOR mutation has been associated with exceptional response to treatment 
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 7 in a bladder cancer patient (13), and multiple, rel atively common, activating MTOR 
mutations have been defined through in vitro studies (14). 
   
We hypothesize that due to the positioning of TSC1/TSC2 as a key regulator of 
mTORC1, that all cancers with inactivating mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 will have 
sensi tivity to everolimus.  The extent of sensitivity will likely depend on other genomic 
events present in these cancers, tissue type, and other unknown factors. Furthermore, 
we similarly hypothesize that cancers bearing MTOR activating mutations will also have sensitivity to everolimus.  
 
 
2.3 Correlative Studies Background  
 
As described above, the TSC1/TSC2 protein complex functions as a key regulator of 
mTORC1 activity, and hence mutation in either gene results in strong activation of mTORC1, both in vivo (mouse tumor models, human cancers (e.g. PEComa)) and in vitro (multiple cell lines).  Nonetheless, human cancers are often subject to numerous mutations and genomic copy number changes throughout the genome.  In the publication in which Everolimus was described to cause a complete sustained clinical response in a patient with metastatic bladder cancer, the responding patient’s cancer also had a mutation in NF2 and other genes.  We hypothesize that other genetic and genomic events affect sensitivity to Everolimus,  and hence wish to perform whole exome 
sequencing to identify both mutational events and genome- wide copy number changes 
(amplifications and deletions) on cancer samples from patients on this trial.   
Furthermore, in responding patients who subsequently progress, we will also require repeat biopsy to permit genetic studies to examine the mechanism of resistance, as long as this can be performed without medical risk.  In addition, we will prepare cancer cell lines from these patients using either the patient- derived xenograft system, or through 
direct establishment of a cell line using a feeder layer.  
 3. PARTICIPANT SELECTION  
 
This study will enroll 30 patients with inactivating mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 , or activating

13-March -2017  
 8 CLIA -certified laboratory.  All genetic findings must be reviewed by the study PI, 
Dr. David Kwiatkowski, prior to study entry.  
Biopsy of a primary or metastatic lesion must have been performed within the past 
two years.  Sufficient pathologic material must be available to enable whole exome

techniques or as ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam.  See Section 1 0 for the evaluation of measurable disease.  
 3.1.3 Participants may have received any number of prior therapies, fro m 0 to > 10.  P rior 
treatment with PI3 -kinase or mTOR inhibitors is not permitted , unless they were 
given as adjuvant therapy without undue toxicity, and without  suggestion of

• Total cholesterol < 300 mg/dL  
• Triglycerides < 250 mg/dL  
3.1.7 The effects of everolimus on the developing human fetus are unknown.  For this 
reason and because anti -neoplastic agents are known to be teratogenic, women of 
child -bearing potential a nd men must agree to use adequate contraception 
(hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect 
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 9 she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating 
physician immediately.  
   
3.1.8 Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.  
 3.1.9 Participants who achieve either a partial response or stable disease ≥ 4 months must agree to undergo a tumor biopsy, if safe and feasible, at the time of  progressive 
disease while on study drug everolimus . 
 
3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be eligible for admission into the study.  
 
3.2.1 Particip ants who have had  any of the following:  
3.2.1.1  Chemotherapy  in the previous 2 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or 
mitomycin C)  
3.2.1.2 Radiotherapy  within 3 weeks 
3.2.1.3 Investigational agents within 3 weeks prior to entering the study  
3.2.1.4 Patients  who have not recovered from signi ficant (in the opinion of the 
investigator) adverse events due to previous agents administered. 
 
3.2.2 Child -Pugh B or C hepatic impairment.   Patients with a history of hepatitis or 
significant exposure risk should be tested for hepatitis B and C with serologic markers: HBsAg, HBs Ab, HBcoreIgG Ab, and HCV  Ab.  Patients with active 
hepatitis B or C are excluded.  
  
3.2.3 Participants may not be receiving any other research study agents.  
 3.2.4 Uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases, including patients who continue to require glucocorticoids for brain or leptomeningeal metastases.  Asymptomatic 
or treated brain metastases are acceptable.  
 
3.2.5 History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to everolimus . 
 3.2.6 A list of prohibited medications on study are listed in Section 5.5  
 
3.2.7 Chronic treatment with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive therapy  
 
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 10 3.2.8 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active 
infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,  unstable angina pectoris, 
cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit 
compliance with study requirements.  
 
3.2.9 Pregnant women are excluded from this study because everolimus has the potential 
for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential 
risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with 
everolimus, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with everolimus. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.  
 
3.2.10  Individuals with a recent history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for 
the following circumstances:  1) Individuals with a history of other malignancies are 
eligible if they have been disease- free for at least 3 years OR are deemed by the 
investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy; 2) Individuals with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 3 years: cervical cancer in situ , and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin . 
 
3.2.11  Individuals  with known HIV infection are excluded from this study as 
combination antiretroviral therapy could potentially result in significant 
pharmacokinetic interactions with everolimus. In addition, these individua ls are 
at increased risk of lethal infections due to the immunosuppressive effects of 
mTOR inhibition.  
 3.2.12  Patients who have received live attenuated vaccines within 1 week of start of Everolimus. Patient should also avoid close contact with others who have r eceived 
live attenuated vaccines. Examples of live attenuated vaccines include intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella and TY21a typhoid vaccines.  
 3.2.13  Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus : HbA1c must be < 8% or there must be 
documentation that control has been good for the week prior to study entry, with daily morning glucoses at < 150 mg/dl. Patients with a known history of impaired fasting glucose or diabetes mellitus (DM) may be included, however blood glucose and a ntidiabetic treatment must be monitored closely throughout the trial and 
adjusted as necessary.  
 
3.3 Inclusion of Women, Minorities and Other Underrepresented Populations  
 
Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this tria l.

notified of cancellations as soon as possible. 
 
 
4.4 Registration Process for Other Participatin g Institutions  
 
To register a participant on this study, please refer to Appendix C, Data and Safety 
Monitoring Plan (DSMP) Section 3.7.  
 
5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Expected toxicities and potential risks as wel l as dose modifications for everolimus are described in Section 6 (Expected Toxicities 
and Dosing Delays/Dose Modification). No investigational or commercial agents or therapies other than those described below may be administered with the intent to treat the participant’s 
malignancy.  As this is a non -randomized trial, all trial subjects will receive everolimus.  
 If a patient is deriving  clinical benefit, they may continue on treatment beyond progressive 
disease with PI approval. 
 
5.1 Dosing Plan  
The study dru g Everolimus will be self -administered. The investigator will instruct the patient 
to take the study drug exactly as specified in the protocol. Everolimus will be administered orally as once daily dose of 10 mg (one 10mg tablet) continuously from study day  1 until 
progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity. Patients will be instructed to take Everolimus in the morni ng, at the same time each day, and to keep a pill diary.  A treatment cycle is 
defined as 28 days (4 weeks). 
It is recommended that Everolimus is taken in the morning, one hour prior to breakfast.  
Dietary habits around the time of Everolimus intake should be as consistent as possible throughout the study . The tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water and should 
not be chewed or crushed. For patients unable to swallow tablets, the tablet(s) should be dispersed completely in a glass of water (containing approximately 30 mL) by gently stirring, immediately prior to drinking. The glass should be rinsed with the same volume of water a nd 
the rinse completely swallowed to ensure the entire dose is administered.  
    Doses of everolimus may be administered with or without food, whatever is most convenient  
    for the participants. However, dosing with or without food must be consistent throughout the        course of the study. 
If vomiting occurs, no attempt should be made to replace the vomited dose.

will supply no information about the patient. The storage conditions for study drug will be described on the medication label. 
Everolimus will be provided by Novartis. Everolimus is formulated as t ablets for oral 
administration of 5mg and 10 mg strength. Tablets are blister -packed under aluminum foil, 
which should be opened only at the time of administration as drug is both hygroscopic and 
light- sensitive. Typically, patients  will be given a 4-week  supply; however, after cycle 2 it 
may be a n 8-week supply at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
5.2 Screening Criteria   
All subjects or their legally acceptable representative and the person who conducted the informed consent discussion must personally sign and date the consent form before any study -
specific screening procedures are performed. Procedures that have been performed before consent was obtained as part of routine care are not considered study-specific procedures.  
Medical history information to be collected during screening must date back to the original 
diagnosis of cancer. If a subject is referred to the study center, a copy of all applicable reports and histological or cytological evidence, confirming the diagnosis must be provided to the study center before enrollment. Copies of recent ( i.e., within the past 6 months) radiographic 
images confirming disease progression by modified RECIST should be provided to the study center.  
All subjects who have signed the IRB approved consent form must be r egistered as a screened 
subject. At the time of registration, the subject will receive a unique 2 digit subject identification number. This number will be used to identify the subject throughout the study and must be used on all study documentation related to that subject. The subject identification 
number must remain constant throughout the entire study.  
All screening tests and procedures must be performed and the results available within a 
maximum of 14 days before study day 1 unless otherwise noted.  
Subjects who do not meet eligibility criteria within the 14 day screening period will not be 
eligible for enrollment. However, subjects may be re -screened up to 2 additional times at the 
discretion of the investigator. The subject must be re -consented if more than 28 days have 
elapsed since the date of last informed consent.  
The following screening assessments must be performed: 
• Review of inclusion and exclusion criteria 
• Medical history review, documentation of diagnosis and previous treatment. 
• Physical exam ination, ECOG performance status, blood pressure, respiratory rate, 
resting pulse, temperature, height and weight. 
•  CT scans (contrast -enhanced) or MRI scan (contrast -enhanced) of areas of known 
disease and that are of acceptable quality as baseline study within 30 days prior to study 
day 1.

 14 Laboratory assessment consisting of  
• Hematology  
• Chemistry  
• Urinalysis  
• beta HCG pregnancy test for women of child -bearing potential 
5.3 Pretreatment Criteria  
The first dose of Everolimus may be administered on the same day as enrollment but no 
more than 10 business days after enrollment. The treatment period begins on the first day of treatment with Everolimus.  
If a subject is unable to come into the clinic for a required study visit or if unforeseen events occur, the visit procedures may be performed within a one week time frame.  
The following assessments will be performed at each clinic visit according to table 3.4 throughout the treatment period:  
• Physical examination,  
• ECOG performance status,  
• Blood pressure, respiratory  rate, resting pulse, temperature, and weight. 
• Laboratory evaluations : If patients have met trial eligibility within the previous 72 
hours, no specific criteria will need required in order to initiate the protocol unless, in the investigator’s opinion, significant medical issues arise which would contraindicate starting the study medications. If patients have completed entry criteria >72 hours prior to cycle 1 day 1, laboratory values on cycle 1 day 1 should be repeated to confirm all eligibility criteria  are met . 
• CT scans (contrast -enhanced) or MRI scan (contrast -enhanced) or PET -CT scan of 
areas of known disease every 8 weeks with a 5 business -day time window in case 
unforeseen events occur. Evaluation according to RECIST criteria compared to previous scan.  
• beta HCG pregnancy test for women of child -bearing potential  
Documentation of all adverse events will occur at each clinic visit and at any other time point when necessary. There are no specific criteria for the initiation of a given cycle 
except for t he ones indicated in the dose modification tables 6 -2, 6- 3 & 6 -4.  Study 
subjects may commence with treatment if, in the opinion of the investigator and based on the guidance of Section 6, it is safe for the participant to do so.  
 
5.4 Agent Administration   
 
Everolimus will be administered orally daily, either at the starting dose of 10 mg, or at a 
lower dose based on guidance in Section 6.

13-March -2017

5.5 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Any new medications that patients might start taking while  on study need to be reported to 
the study MD first before they start taking it.   At each visit, the investigator will ask the 
patient about any new medications he/she is or has taken after the start of the study drug. 
All Concomitant medications/Significa nt non-drug therapies taken ≤ 30 days prior to start 
and after start of study drug, including physical therapy and blood transfusions, should be 
recorded.  
The following restrictions apply during the entire duration of the study: 
• No other investigational therapy should be given to patients. 
• No anticancer agents other than the study medication should be given to patients. The 
only exception is that treatment with hormonal agents for either prostate or breast cancer 
may be continued (not added) during this study.  If such agents are required for a patient 
then the patient must first be withdrawn from the study.  
• Growth factors ( e.g. G -CSF, GM -CSF, erythropoietin, platelets growth factors etc.) are 
not to be administered prophylactically but may be prescribed by the investigator for 
rescue from severe hematologic events, if this is thought to be appropriate. 
• Concurrent administration of Everolimus and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as 
ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) and inducers (such as rifampin, rifabutin) should be 
avoided. Provided there is no alternative treatment available, patients should be closely 
monitored for potential toxicities.  
• Concurrent administration of Everolimus and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as 
erythromycin, fluconazole, calcium channel blockers, benzodiazepines) and moderate 
CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin) should also be avoided if possible, or used subject to caution (e.g. increased frequency of safety monitoring, 
temporary interruption of Everolimus). 
• Competitive inhibition could occur when Everolimus is combined with drugs which are 
also CYP3A4 substrates. Therefore caution should be exercised in such cases. 
• Co-administration with substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of P -glycoprotein should be 
avoide d, if possible, or used subject to caution (e.g. increased frequency of safety 
monitoring, temporary interruption of Everolimus).  
• Grapefruit and grapefruit juice affect cytochrome P450 and P -glycoprotein activity and 
should therefore be avoided.  
• In addition, patients should avoid Seville oranges and star fruit, as well as the juice of 
these fruits, which are potent CYP3A4-inhibitors.  
• No chronic treatment with systemic steroids or another immunosuppressive agents. 
Topical or inhaled corticosteroids are allowed. 
• Everolimus may affect the response to vaccinations making the response to the 
vaccination less effective. Live vaccines should be avoided while a patient is treated with Everolimus. 
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors

 16 Oral anticoagulants such as warfarin are CYP2C9 substrates and, as such, no interaction with 
Everolimus is expected. However, drug -drug interaction studies between macrolide 
antibiotics and warfarin have produced mixed outcomes and the disparity in these findings has led to the conclusion that multiple factors may alter the clearance of warfarin. The co -
administration of Everolimus and oral anticoagulants is possible but should be subject to verification of coagulation (INR) once steady state is reached (after one week’s treatment).

Database, and Indiana University School of Medicine's Drug Interaction Table.  
Vaccinations 
Immunosuppressants may affect the response to vaccination and vaccination during treatment 
with Everolimus may therefore be less effective. The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with Everolimus Examples of live vaccines are: intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines.  
  
5.6 Duration of Therapy  
 
Duration of therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease progression and tolerance. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue  forever or until one of the following criteria applies:  
• Disease progression,  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
• Participant demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to comply with the o ral 
medication regimen and/or documentation requirements  
• Participant decides to withdraw from treatment but is willing to be followed,  
• Participants decides to withdraw consent from the  study, or  
• General or specific changes in the participant's condition render the participant  
unacceptable for further treatment in the opinion of the treating investigator.

5.7 Duration of Follow Up  
 
Participants will be followed until death  after removal from treatment . This 
follow -up will be performed by review of the medical record, contact with care 
providers, and/or telephone contact as needed every 3 months.  
  
5.8 Criteria for Removal from Study  
 
Participants will be removed from treatment  when any of the criteria listed in 
Section 5.6 applies. The reason for discontinuation of treatment  and the date the 
participant was removed must be documented in the study- specific case report 
form (CRF). Alternative care options will be discussed with the participant.  
 
In the event of unusual or life -threatening complications, participating investigators 
must immediately notify the Principal Investigator.  
 
6. EXPECTED TOXICITIES AND DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
For patients who do not tolerate the protocol -specified dosing schedule, dose adjustments are 
permitted in order to allow the patient to continue the study treatment. Details of study 
treatment schedule adjustments and dose levels are provided in table 6-1: 
 Table 6 -1 Study treatment schedule adjustments and dose levels 
Dose level  Dose and schedule  
0 (starting dose)  10 mg daily  
-1 5 mg daily  
-2 5 mg every other day  
 If a patient has already decreased 2 dose levels, no further dose reduction is permitted. 
Patients who need an additional dose reduction will be required to discontinue Everolimus.  Dose delays and modifications will be made using the following recommendations. Toxicity assessments will be done using the CTEP Active Version of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0) which is identified and located on the CTEP 
website at: http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
.  
 
If possible, symptoms should be managed symptomatically. In the case of toxicity, 
appropriate medical treatment should be used (including anti- emetics, anti -diarrheals, etc.).  
 All adverse events experienced by participants will be collected from the time of the first dose of study treatment, through the study and until the final study visit. Participants

symptoms improve to Grade 
≤ 1. 
Consider re- initiating 
Everolimus at one dose level 
lower  at investigator 
discretion .  
Discontinue Everolimus if 
failure to recover within ≤ 
28 days.  
Grade 4  CT scan with lung windows 
and required pulmonary function testing, if possible, includes: spirometry, DLCO, and room air O2 saturation at rest. Monitoring at each visit until return to ≤ grade 1. Return to initial monitoring frequency if no recurrence. Bronchoscopy with biopsy and/or BAL is recommended 
if possible.  Consider corticosteroids if infective origin is ruled out. Taper as medically indicated.  Rule out infection and discontinue Everolimus.

 26 6.2.1 Management of sp ecific toxicities  
Overall, safety data available from completed, controlled and uncontrolled studies 
indicate that everolimus is generally well tolerated at weekly or daily dose schedules. The safety profile is characterized by manageable adverse events (AEs). These AEs are generally reversible and non -cumulative.  
Adverse events most frequently observed with everolimus are rash, stomatitis /oral mucositis, non-infectious pneumonitis, fatigue, headache, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and infections. Overall, the most frequently observed laboratory abnormalities include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hypercholesterolemia, and/or hypertriglyceridemia. The majority of these AEs have been of mild to moderate severity (NCI CTC grade 1 -2). Recommendations for dose adjustments, should any of these 
treatment -related adverse events occur, are given in tables 6 -2 and  6-3 
6.2.1.1 Management of infections 
Everolimus has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral or protozoal infections, including infections with opportunistic pathogens. Localized and systemic infections, including pneumonia, other bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections, such as aspergillosis or candidiasis and viral infections including reactivation of hepatitis B virus, have been described in patients taking Everolimus. Some of these infections have been severe (e.g. leading to respiratory or hepatic failure) and occasionally have had a fatal outcome.  
Physicians and patients should be aware of the increased risk of infection with Everolimus. Treat pre- existing infections prior to starting treatment with Everolimus. 
While taking Everolimus, be vigilant for symptoms and signs of infection; if a diagnosis of infection is made, institute appropriate treatment p romptly and consider interruption or 
discontinuation of Everolimus. 
If a diagnosis of invasive systemic fungal infection is made, discontinue Everolimus and 
treat with appropriate antifungal therapy. 
6.2.1.2 Management of skin toxicity 
For patients with grade 1 toxicity, no specific supportive care is usually needed or indicated. Rash must be reported as an AE. Patients with grade 2 or higher toxicity may be treated with the following suggested supportive measures at the discretion of the investigator: oral minocycline, topical tetracycline, topical clindamycin, topical silver sulfadiazine, diphenhydramine, oral prednisolone (short course), topical corticosteroids, or pimecrolimus.  
6.2.1.3 Management of stomatitis / oral mucositis / mouth ulcers 
Patients with a clinical history of stomatitis/mucositis/mouth ulcers and those with gastrointestinal morbidity associated with mouth/dental infections, irritation of esophageal mucosa e.g. gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and pre -existing 
stomatitis/mucositis must be monitored  even more closely. Patients should be instructed 
to report the first onset of buccal mucosa irritation/reddening to their study physician immediately.  
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 27 Stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers due to Everolimus should be treated using local 
supportive care. Please note that investigators in earlier trials have described the oral 
toxicities associated with Everolimus as mouth ulcers, rather than mucositis or stomatitis. If your examination reveals mouth ulcers rather than a more general inflammation of the mouth, please classify the adverse event as such. Please follow the paradigm below for treatment of stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers: 
 
1. For mild toxicity (grade 1), use conservative measures such as non- alcoholic mouth 
wash or salt water (0.9%) mouth was h several times a day until resolution.  
2. For more severe toxicity (grade 2 in which case patients have pain but are able to 
maintain adequate oral alimentation, or grade 3 in which case patients cannot maintain 
adequate oral alimentation), the suggested tre atments are topical analgesic mouth 
treatments (i.e., local anesthetics such as, benzocaine, butyl aminobenzoate, tetracaine hydrochloride, menthol, or phenol) with or without topical corticosteroids, such as 
triamcinolone oral paste 0.1% (Kenalog in Oraba se
®). 
3. Agents containing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, iodine, and thyme derivatives may 
tend to worsen mouth ulcers. It is preferable to avoid these agents. 
4. Antifungal agents should be avoided unless a fungal infection is diagnosed. In 
particular, systemic imidazole antifungal agents (ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, 
etc.) should be avoided in all patients due to their strong inhibition of Everolimus metabolism, therefore leading to higher Everolimus exposures. Therefore, topical 
antifungal agents are preferred if an infection is diagnosed. 
6.2.1.4 Management of diarrhea 
Appearance of grade 1 -2 diarrhea attributed to study drug toxicity may be treated with 
loperamide . Loperamide is taken 4 mg orally after the first loose stool, then 2 mg after 
each loose stool, not to exceed 16 mg in any 24-hour period. 
 
6.2.1.5 Management of hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia 
Treatment of hyperlipidemia should take into account the pre -treatment status and dietary 
habits of the patient. Grade 2 or higher hypercholesterolemia (>300 mg/dL  or 7.75 
mmol/L) or grade 2 hypertriglyceridemia or higher (>2.5x upper normal limit) should be 
treated with a 3 -hydroxy-3- methyl -glutaryl (HMG) -CoA reductase inhibitor (e.g. 
atorvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin) or appropriate triglyceride -lowering medication, in 
addition to diet. 
Note: Concomitant therapy with fibrates and an HMG -CoA reductase inhibitor is 
associated with an increased risk of a rare but serious skeletal muscle toxicity manifested 
by rhabdomyolysis, markedly elevated creatine phosphokina se (CPK) levels and 
myoglobinuria, acute renal failure and sometimes death. The risk versus benefit of using this therapy should be determined for individual patients based on their risk of cardiovascular complications of hyperlipidemia. 
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 28 Hyperglycemia has been reported in clinical trials. Monitoring of fasting serum glucose is 
recommended prior to the start of Everolimus and periodically thereafter. Optimal 
glycemic control should be achieved before starting a patient on Everolimus. 
6.2.1.6 Management of non- infect ious pneumonitis  
Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives. Cases of non-
infectious pneumonitis (including interstitial lung disease) have also been described in patients taking Everolimus. Some of these have been severe and on rare occasions, a fatal 
outcome was observed. 
 
• A diagnosis of non- infectious pneumonitis should be considered in patients 
presenting with non- specific respiratory signs and symptoms such as hypoxia, 
pleural effusion, cough or dyspnea, and in whom infectious, neoplastic and other 
non-medicinal causes have been excluded by means of appropriate investigations. 
Patients should be advised to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory 
symptoms.  
• Patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non-inf ectious pneumonitis 
and have few or no symptoms may continue Everolimus therapy without dose alteration.  
Individuals participating in this trial will be routinely questioned as to the presence of 
new or changed pulmonary symptoms consistent with lung toxicity. Moreover, potential 
lung radiological changes can be detected by the chest CT/MRI scans that are performed 
on all patients every 8 weeks  for tumor assessment according to the schedule of events. In 
addition, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) will be conducted, if clinically indicated, to monitor for pneumonitis. If non- infectious pneumonitis develops, the guidelines in table 
6-4 should be followed. Consultation with a pulmonologist is recommended for any case 
of pneumonitis that develops during the study. 
 
6.2.1.7 Management of Hepatitis B and C Reactivation 
 
Patie nts with a history of hepatitis  or significant exposure to hepatitis will be screened at 
the beginning of the study to assess activity of disease.  Those with active hepatitis B or 
C are excluded from t his protocol.  Everolimus has been associated with reactivation of 
both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV).  Patients entered on this study 
who subsequently show evidence of active hepatitis B or C will be withdrawn from the 
study. 
  
6.3 Hepatic Impairment Dose Modifications  
  
•  Mild hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh A) – the recommended dose is 7.5 mg daily. 
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 29 • Moderate hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh B) – the recommended dose is 2.5 mg daily 
(if deterioration in hepatic function is observed on study). 
• Severe hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh C) – not recommended. If the desired benefit 
outweighs the risk, a dose of 2.5 mg daily must not be exceeded. • Dose adjustments should be made if a patient’s hepatic (Child- Pugh) status changes 
during treatment.  
Evero limus is not recommended for patients with hepatic impairment who require doses 
below 2.5 mg every other day.

8.1 Pharmacokin etic Studies  
 
As everolimus is an approved agent, no pharmacokinetic studies will be performed. 
8.2 Pharmacodynamic Studies  
8.2.1 Laboratory Correlative Studies  
8.2.1.1 Whole exome sequence analysis of tumor specimen 
 
Paraffin blocks of tumor biopsies or resection specimens  will be collected at 
the time of study entry by the Principal Investigator for whole exome 
sequencing analysis. If paraffin blocks are not released by the pathology department, unstained slides maximum of 20 and minimum of 5 will be requested with each ti ssue cut measuring a minimum of 4 microns in width.   
These samples will be sent to the research laboratory of the Principal Investigator at the following address: David Kwiatkowski, Brigham and 
Women’s Hospital, 20 Shattuck St., Thorn 826C , Boston, MA  02115.  These 
samples will be used for DNA extraction and analysis by whole exome sequencing at the Broad Institute.  A paired normal DNA sample is required 
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 32 for this analysis and will be collected as a blood sample on the date of study 
entry.  Whole exome data will be analyzed using standard pipeline tools in use at the Broad Institute, including Mutect to identify sequence variants present in the cancer and not in the normal DNA sample, and CapSeg to identify regions of significant copy number variation acros s the genome.

10. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
For the purposes of this study, participants should be re- evaluated for response every 
8 weeks. In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained 4-
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 34 8 weeks (not less than 4 weeks) following initial documentation of objective 
response. 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed  by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 
1.1 (Eisenhauer et al., 2009).  Changes in the diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions  are used in the RECIST 1.1  criteria.  
10.1.1  Definitions  
Evaluable for toxicity : All participants who receive at least one dose of study 
treatment  will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment.  
Evaluable for objective response : Only those participants  who have 
measurable disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of 
therapy, and have had their disease re- evaluated will be considered evaluable 
for response. These participants  will have their response classified according 
to the definitions stated below. (Note: Participants who exhibit objective 
disease progres sion or die  prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered 
evaluable.}  
10.1.2  Disease Parameters  
Measurable disease. Measurable disease is the presence of at least one 
(1) lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with 
longest diameter  >20 millimeters (mm) using conventional techniques (CT, 
MRI, x -ray) or >10 mm with spiral CT scan. Measurable lesions must be at 
least 2 times the slice thickness in mm. All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
A lesion in a previously irradiated area is not eligible for measurable disease unless there is objective evidence of progression of the lesion prior to study enrollment. Lesions in previously irradiated areas must be clearly identified as such. 
  
Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be > 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT 
scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease: All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with > 10 to < 
15mm short axis , are considered non- measurable disease. Bo ne lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses identified by 
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 35 physical exam that are not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques, and 
cystic lesion s are all considered non- measurable.  
 
Target lesions : All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per 
organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Lesions 
must be accurately measured in 1 dimension with a minimum size of 10 mm by CT or MRI (slice thickness no greater than 5 mm), 20 mm by chest  x-ray. 
Nodes must have a short axis > 15 mm. The short axis should be included in 
the sum of the lesions in  the calculation of response. Nodes that shrink to < 10 
mm are considered normal. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size, be representative of all the involved organs, and should be lesions that can be followed with reproducible repea ted measurements.  
Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components , that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as 
CT or MRI can be considered target lesions if the soft tissue component  meet s 
the definition of measurability as defined above. Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as target lesions. However, if non -
cystic lesions are present, these are preferred for selection as target lesions. Lesions in previ ously irradiated areas or areas subject to other loco -regional 
therapy are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression of that lesion.  
Non-target lesions :  All other lesions, including small lesions < 10 mm or 
patholog ical lymph nodes measuring > 10 mm to < 15 mm in short axis, as 
well as truly non -measurable lesions, which include leptomeningeal disease, 
ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abd ominal masses identified by 
physical exam that are not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.  
10.1.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler, calipers, or digital measur ement tool. All baseline evaluations should be performed 
as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination 
when both methods have been used to assess the anti- tumor effect of a 
treatment.  
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 36 Clinical lesions . Clinic al lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes). For the case of 
skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate 
the size of the lesion, is recommended. 
Chest x -ray. Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when 
they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung; however, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI : This guideline has defined measurability of lesions 
on CT scan based on the assumption that CT thickness is 5mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size of a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body scans).   
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement.  Furthermore, the a vailability of MRI is variable globally.  As with 
CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts,  
and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body  scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if 
possible. 
Ultrasound (US) : When the primary endpoint of the study is objective 
response evaluation, US should not be used to measure tumor lesions. It is, 
however, a possible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable 
lymph nodes, subcutaneous lesions, and thyroid nodules. US might also be useful 
to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by clinical examination.  
FDG PET and PET/CT.  The acquisition of FDG PET and FDG PET/CT scans 
should follow the NCI Guidelines for using FDG PET as an indicator of therapeutic response (L.K. Shankar, J.M. Hoffman, S. Bacharach, M.M. Graham, J. Karp, A.A. Lammertsma, S. Larson, D.A. Mankoff, B.A. Siegel, A. Van den Abbeele, J. Yap, D. Sullivan. Consensus recommendations for the use of 18F-FDG PET a s an indicator of therapeutic response in patients in National Cancer 
Institute Trials. J Nucl Med, 47(6):901-903, 2006). Patients should avoid strenuous exercise and be on a low carbohydrate diet for 24 hours prior to the 
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 37 scan. Patients should fast for 4 hours or longer prior to the FDG injection and 
should have serum  glucose of less than 200 mg/dL at the time of FDG injection. 
A 10 -20 mCi dose of FDG should be injected for typical adult patients. For 
longitudinal studies with multiple scans, particular attention should be paid to ensure consistent patient preparation and acquisition parameters between the follow- up scan and the baseline scan. When designing a study where PET scans 
are going to be utilized as one of the modalities to evaluate efficacy, it is important to consult with physicians in nuclear medicine in designing the appropriate criteria to be utilized.  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy : The utilization of these techniques for objective 
tumor evaluation has not yet been fully and widely validated. Their u ses in this 
specific context require sophisticated equipment and a high level of expertise 
that may only be available in some centers. Therefore, the utilization of such 
techniques for objective tumor response should be restricted to validation 
purposes in reference centers. However, such techniques may be useful to 
confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained . 
Tumor markers . Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for 
a subject to be considered in complete clinical response. Specific additional 
criteria for standardized usage of prostate- specific antigen (PSA) and CA -125 
response in support of clinical trials are being developed.  
Cytology, Histolog y: These techniques can be used to differentiate between 
partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual 
lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual 
benign tumors can remain).  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that 
appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met 
criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between 
response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) 
and progressive disease.  
10.1.4   Response Criteria  
10.1.4.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 Complete Response (CR) :  
Disappearance of all target lesions : Any pathological lymph node 
must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.  
Partial Response (P R):   
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 38 At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 Progressive Disease (PD):   
                At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum with at least 5mm absolute 
increase in the sum of all lesions. The appearance of one or more new lesions* denotes disease progression.   
   
 Stable Disease (SD):   
 Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters 
while on study. 
Unknown (UN):  Assessment of target lesions cannot be made due to 
insufficient or unevaluable data. In this case, a concise explanation must 
be given.  
Note : If tumor response data is missing for target lesions, the overall 
assessment must be UN unless there is new disease that would result in an overall assessment of PD. However, if there is missing or unevaluable data for non -target lesions, but data is available for all 
targe t lesions, the overall response for that time point will be assigned 
based on the sum LD of all target lesions. Additionally, the assessment of CR cannot be made if there is missing or unevaluable data for non -
target lesions. In this case, the overall assessment would be PR. 
*Definition of New Lesion : The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal 
(i.e. not due to difference in scanning technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (ex: new bone lesions may be healing or flare of pre -existing lesions). However, a lesion identified on a 
follow -up scan in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is 
considered new and will indicate PD. If a new lesion is equivocal (because of small size, etc.), follow -up evaluation will clarify if it truly represents new 
disease and if PD is confirmed, progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion was discovered.

pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).   
Note: If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, 
they must normalize for a subject to be con sidered in complete 
clinical response.  
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD):  Persistence of one or 
more non- target lesions and/or maintenance of tumor marker level 
above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new 
lesions*  (new lesions must be > slice thickness) and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.  Overall 
level of substantial worsening that merits discontinuation of 
therapy. A useful test that can be applied when assessing non-targets for unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the change in non -
measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease.  
Unknown (UN):  Assessment of non- target lesions cannot be made due 
to insufficient or unevaluable data. In this case, a concise explanation must be given. 
*Definition of New Lesion : The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal

10.1.4.3 Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started). The participant's best response assignment will 
depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

 41 10.1.5  Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured 
from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first 
recorded) until the first date that r ecurrence or PD is objectively documented, 
taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started.  
Duration of overall complete response: The duration of overall CR is 
measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the 
first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented. 
Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
10.1.6  Progression -Free Survival  
Progression -Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from study 
registration to the date of documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. Patients not expe riencing an event will be censored at the date of the last 
disease assessment.  
  
11. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
11.1 Definitions  
11.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or experience that develops o r worsens in severity after starting the first dose of 
study treatment or any procedure specified in the protocol, even if the event is not considered to be related to the study.  
 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse ev ents 
only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests.  
11.1.2  Serious adverse event (SAE)  
 A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality that:  
• Results in deat h 
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 42 • Is life -threatening. Life -threatening means that the person was at 
immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not 
include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form.  
• Requires  or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (i.e., the event required at 
least a 24 -hour hospitalization or prolonged a hospitalization beyond the 
expected length of stay). Hospitalization admissions and/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease existed before the person was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned). 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is 
defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions. 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or 
• Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, it may jeopardize the participant and require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospitalizations for: 
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated 
with any deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures 
• elective or pre- planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen  
• emergency outpatient treatment for an e vent not fulfilling the serious 
criteria outlined above and not resulting in inpatient admission  
• respite care  
 
11.1.3  Expectedness  
 
Adverse events can be 'Expected' or 'Unexpected.'  
11.1.3.1 Expected adverse event  
 
Expected adverse events are those that have been previou sly identified as 
resulting from administration of the agent. For the purposes of this study, 
an adverse event is considered expected  when it appears in the current 
adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or is included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.   
 
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 43 Refer to Section 6.1 for a listing of expected adverse events associated 
with the study agent(s).  
11.1.3.2 Unexpected adverse event  
  
For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered unexpected  
when it varies in nature, intensity or frequency from information provided in the current adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or when it is not included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.   
11.1.4  Attribution  
 Attributio n is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event 
and the study treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows:  
 
• Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
• Probable – The AE is likely related  to the study treatme nt. 
• Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
• Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
• Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
11.2 Procedures for AE and SAE Recording and Reporting  
 
Participating  investigators will assess the occurrence of AEs and SAEs at all participant 
evaluation time points during the study.   All AEs and SAEs whether reported by the participant, discovered during questioning, directly observed, or detected by physical examinat ion, laboratory test or other means, 
will be recorded in the participant’s medical record and on the appropriate study-specific case report forms.  
 The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. All 
appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website at:   http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
.  
 
11.3 Reporting Requirements  
 
For multi- site trials where a DF/HCC investigator is serving as the principal investigator, 
each par ticipating investigator is required to abide by the reporting requirements set by 
the DF/HCC. This applies to any medical event equivalent to an unexpected grade 2 or 3 
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 44 with a possible, probable or definite attribution, unexpected grade 4 toxicities, and grade 
5 (death) regardless of study phase or attribution.  The study must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations, local safety reporting 
requirements, and reporting requirements of the principal investigator.  
 
Each investigative site will be responsible to report SAEs that occur at that institution to their respective IRB. It is the responsibility of each participating investigator to report serious adverse events to the study sponsor and/or others as described below.  
 
11.4 Reporting to the Study Spons or 
11.4.1  Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
 All serious adverse events that occur after the initial dose of study treatment, during treatment, or within 30 days of the last dose of treatment must be reported to the DF/HCC Overall Principal Investigator on the loca l institutional SAE form. 
This includes events meeting the criteria outlined in Section 11.1.2, as well as the following:  
• Grade 2 (moderate) and Grade 3 (severe) Events – Only events that are 
unexpected and possibly, probably or definitely related/associa ted with the 
intervention. 
 
• All Grade 4 (life -threatening or disabling) Events – Unless expected AND 
specifically listed in the protocol as not requiring reporting.  
 
• All Grade 5 (fatal) Events – When the participant is enrolled and actively 
participating in the trial OR when the event occurs within 30 days of the 
last study intervention.  
 
Note : If the participant is in long term follow up, report the death at the time 
of continuing review.  
 Participating investigators must report each serious adverse even t to the DF/HCC 
Overall Principal Investigator within 1 business day of learning of the occurrence. 
In the event that the participating investigator does not become aware of the serious adverse event immediately (e.g., participant sought treatment elsewher e), 
the participating investigator is to report the event within 1 business day after 
learning of it and document the time of his or her first awareness of the adverse event. Report serious adverse events by telephone, email or facsimile to:  
    David Kwia tkowski, MD, PhD

 45 Fax: (617) 394-2762 
dkwiatkowski@partners.org   
 
 
Within the following 1-2 business days , the participating investigator must 
provide follow-up information on the serious adverse event. Follow-up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how the event was treated, and whether the participant will continue or discontinue study participation. 
11.4.2  Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
 Non-serious adverse events will be reported to the DF/HCC Overall Principal 
Investigator on the toxicity Case Report Forms.   
11.5 Reporting to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
 Investigative sites within DF/HCC will report all serious adverse events directly to th e 
DFCI Office for Human Research Studies (OHRS).  
 
Other investigative sites will report SAEs to their respective IRB according to the local IRB’s policies and procedures in reporting adverse events. A copy of the submitted institutional SAE form should be forwarded to the Overall PI within the timeframes detailed in the table below.

according to DFCI IRB policies and procedures in reporting adverse events.  
 
11.6 Reporting to Novartis Pharmaceuticals 
 
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 46 The principal investigator has the obligation to report all serious adverse events to the 
IRB, and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Drug Safety and Epidemiology Department (DS&E).  
To ensure patient safety, every SAE, regardless of suspected causality, occurring 
• after the patient has provided informed consent and until at least 30 day s after the 
patient has stopped study treatment/participation 
• after protocol -specified procedures begin (e.g., placebo run-in, washout period, 
double-blind treatment, etc.) and 30 days after the patient has stopped study 
treatment  
• after the start of any period in which the study protocol interferes with the standard 
medical treatment given to a patient (e.g., treatment withdrawal during washout 
period, change in treatment to a fixed dose of concomitant medication) and until 30 
days after the patient has sto pped study treatment 
must be reported to Novartis by each participating study team within 1 business day  of 
learning of its occurrence  (fax: 877-778-9739) . This includes serious, related, labeled 
(expected) and serious, related, unlabeled (unexpected) adverse experiences. All  deaths 
during treatment or within 30 days following completion of active protocol therapy 
must be reported within 5 working days.  A copy of the report needs to be sent to the 
Protocol Sponsor at the fax number listed in section 11.4.1. 
Any SAEs experienced after this 30 days period should only be reported to Novartis if 
the investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study drug. Recurrent episodes, complications, or progression of the initial SAE must be reported as follow -up to the 
original episode  within 1 business day  of the investigator receiving the follow -up 
information. A SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one should be reported separately as a new event.  The end date of the first event must be provided. 
The original copy of the SAE Report and the fax confirmation sheet must be kept 
within the Trial Master File at the study site.  
Follow- up information is sent to the same fax number as the original SAE Report Form 
was sent, using a new fax cover sheet, stating that this is a follow -up to the previously 
reported SAE , and giving the date of the original report. Each re -occurrence, 
complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as a follow -up to 
that event regardless of when it occurs. The follow -up information should describe 
whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind was broken or not (if applicable), and whether the patient continued or withdrew from study participation.  
If the SAE is not previously documented in the Everolimus Investigator Brochure or Package Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the Novartis study drug, a DS&E associate may urgently require further information from the investigator for 
Health Authority reporting. Novartis may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN), to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reacti ons (SUSARs) will be 
collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in 
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 47 accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC or as per national regulatory requirements in 
participating countries.  
11.7 Reporting to Hospital Risk Management 
 Participating investigators will report to their local Risk Management office any subject 
safety reports or sentinel events that require reporting according to institutional policy. 
11.8 Monitoring of Adverse Events and Period of Observation 
 
All adverse events, both serious and non-serious, and deaths that are encountered from 
initiation of study intervention, throughout the study, and within 30 days of the last study intervention should be followed to their resolution, or until the participating investigator ass esses them as stable, or the participating investigator determines the 
event to be irreversible, or the participant is lost to follow -up. The presence and 
resolution of AEs and SAEs (with dates) should be documented on the appropriate case report form and recorded in the participant’s medical record to facilitate source data verification.   For some SAEs, the study sponsor or designee may follow-up by telephone, fax, and/or monitoring visit to obtain additional case details deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate the SAE report (e.g., hospital discharge summary, consultant report, or autopsy report).   Participants should be instructed to report any serious post-study event(s) that might reasonably be related to participation in this study. Participating investigators should 
notify the DF/HCC Overall Principal Investigator and their respective IRB of any unanticipated death or adverse event occurring after a participant has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to th e study.

14. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
This is a single -arm non -randomized phase II study evaluating the mTOR inhibitor 
everolimus in patients who have documented inactivating mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 , or activating mutations in MTOR . Preliminary data indicates that TS C1 and 
TSC2 mutations are present in approx imately 5 -10% of bladder cancer, 10% of 
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, 50% of PEC oma, 2% of squamous cell lung cancer , 
and 5- 10% of anaplastic thyroid cancer .  
14.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 The primary objective of this trial is objective response rate accordi ng to RECIST 1.1 
criteria.  
 Secondary objective s include duration of response, progression- free and overall 
survival . Duration of response is defined as the time from RECIST -confirmed response 
(CR+PR) to documented disease progression. Progression -free su rvival is  defined as the 
time from study registration to documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.  Patients not experiencing a PFS event will 
be censored at the date of their last disease assessment. Overall survival is  defined as 
time from registration to death from any cause, censoring patients thought to be alive at the time of final analysis at the last date of follow up. We will also estimate toxicity via 
CTCAE version 4.0, and the association of IHC  and whole exome sequencing results 
with patient outcomes and other genetic events.  
 
We will estimate event- time distributions using the Kaplan -Meier method, using 
Greenwood’s formula to estimate the variance and provide 90% confidence intervals for the medians, 6-month, and 1- year estimates. Categorical outcomes, such as toxicity and 
response, will be estimated and their corresponding 90% exact binomial confidence intervals will be p rovided.  
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 52  
For the cohort of patients with TSC1 and TSC2 mutations, w e wil l conduct this study using 
a Simon’s two -stage design. In the first stage we will enroll 21 patients and if a total of at 
least 4 responses (CR + PR) are observed among them, accrual to the second stage will open. If 3 or fewer responses are observed among the first 21 patients, the study will terminate. In the second stage, an additional 29 patients will be enrolled for a total study accrual of 50 patients. After accrual to the second stage is completed, we will declare study success if at least 8 responses are observed among the 50 registered patients. This design has a probabil ity of stopping early after the first stage of accrual of 85% if the drug is 
ineffective; the overall power of the study to detect the targeted response rate of 30% (compared to a n ull of 10%) is 91% while controlling the type I error at a one-sided level of 
0.07.  
 
For the cohort of 10 patients harboring mTOR mutations, we are somewhat limited in the 
inferences that can be made, however we would consider observing at least 2 respons es in 
this cohort worthy of additional study. The maximum half-width of the 90% exact binomial 
confidence interval will be 23.5%. 
14.2 Consideration of gene and mutation specific response rates  
  
It is possible that certain combinations of mutation - primary cancer site will not respond to 
Everolimus therapy. Though the distribution of histologic subtypes among patients to be 
enrolled is unknown at this time, it is of interest to conduct exploratory analyses within these subgroups (for example, among patients with bladder cancer, PEComas, squamous cell lung 
cancer, etc.) Among a subgroup of 10 patients of any particular histology, there is 0.98 probability of observing at least 1 response among them, assuming an underlying response rate of 30%. Therefore, if 10 patients with TSC1/TSC2 mutations and a single cancer site are enrolled and no responses are observed among them, consideration may be given to halting enrollment of patients with cancers arising in that  specific site.  Since this lack of 
response may vary according to the primary site of cancer, in that instance we will continue 
to enroll patients TSC1/TSC2 mutations and different primary cancer sites.  
14.3 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
We have a planned sample size of 30 patients , with either inactivating TSC1 or T SC2 
mutations , or activating MTOR mutations , so it is estimated that this protocol will complete 
accrual in 48 months, making for an overall accrual rate of approximately 1.25  patient s per 
month.  We will be identifying patients for this study from the Oncopanel cancer genotyping 
at DFCI/BWH, the Impact cancer genotyping panel at MSKCC, and CLIA certified 
genotyping laboratories both at other DF/HCC institutions and external sites.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Multi -Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
(DF/HCC DSMP) outlines the procedures for conducting a DF/HCC Multi -Center research 
protoc ol. The DF/HCC DSMP should serve as a reference for any sites external to DF/HCC 
that will be participating in the research protocol.  
 
1.1 Purpose  
 
To establish standards that will ensure that a Dana -Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Mul ti-
Center protocol will comply with Federal Regulations, Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements and applicable DF/HCC Standard Operating Procedures.    
 
1.2 Multi -Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan Definitions 
 
DF/HCC Mult i-Center Protocol :  A research protocol in which one or  more outside 
institutions are collaborating with Dana -Farber/Harvard Cancer Center where a DF/HCC 
investigator is the sponsor. DF/HCC includes Dana- Farber/Partners Cancer Care (DF/PCC) 
Network Clinica l Trial Affiliates.  
 Lead Institution:  One of the  Dana- Farber/Harvard Cancer Center consortium members 
(Dana -Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Beth 
Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), Boston Children’s Hospital (B CH), Brigham 
and Women’s Hospital (BWH)) responsible for the coordination, development, submission, and approval of a protocol as well as its subsequent amendments per the DFCI IRB and applicable regulatory guidelines (Food and Drug Administration (FDA), etc.).  The Lead Institution is typically the home of the DF/HCC Sponsor. The Lead 
Institution also typically serves as the Coordinating Center for the DF/HCC Multi -Center 
Protocol.    DF/HCC Sponsor:  The person sponsoring the submitted Multi -Center protocol.  Within 
DF/HCC, this person is the Overall Principal Investigator who takes responsibility for initiation, management and conduct of the protocol at all research locations. In applicable 
protocols, the DF/HCC Sponsor will serve as the single liaison wi th any regulatory 
agencies. The DF/HCC Sponsor has ultimate authority over the protocol and is responsible 
for the conduct of the study at DF/HCC and all Participating Institutions. In most cases the DF/HCC Sponsor is the same person as the DF/HCC Overall Principal Investigator; 
however, both roles can be filled by two different people.  
 
Participating Institution:  An institution that is outside the DF/HCC and DF/PCC 
consortium that is collaborating with DF/HCC on a protocol where the sponsor is a DF/HCC I nvestigator.  The Participating Institution acknowledges the DF/HCC Sponsor 
as having the ultimate authority and responsibility for the overall conduct of the study.    Coordinating Center: The entity (i.e. Lead Institution, Medical Monitor, Contract Research Organization (CRO), etc) that provides administrative support to the DF/HCC 
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 62 Sponsor in order that he/she may fulfill the responsibilities outlined in the protocol document and DSMP, 
and as specified in applicable regulatory guidelines (i.e. Multi -Cente r Guidelines). In general, the Lead 
Institution is the Coordinating Center for the DF/HCC Multi- Center Protocol. Should the DF/HCC Sponsor 
decide to use a CRO, the CRO will be deemed the Coordinating Center.   
 
DF/HCC Quality Assurance Office for Clinical Trials:  A group within DF/HCC responsible 
for registering human subjects for trials, ensuring high -quality standards are used for data collection and the 
ongoing management of clinical trials, auditing, and data and safety monitoring. ODQ also coordinates 
quality assurance efforts related to multi -center clinical research.  
 
2. GENERAL ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  
 For DF/HCC Multi- Center Protocols, the DF/HCC Sponsor, the Coordinating Center, and 
the Participating Institutions are expected to adhere to the follo wing general 
responsibilities:

3. DF/HCC REQUIREMENTS FOR MULT I-CENTER PROTOCOLS  
 
The following section will clarify DF/HCC Requirements and further detail the expectations for participating in a DF/HCC Multi-Center protocol.  
 
3.1 Protocol Distribution  
 
The Coordinating Center will distribute the final DFCI IRB approved protocol and any 
subsequent amended protocols to all Participating Institutions.     
3.2 Protocol Revisions and Closures 
 
The Participating Institutions will receive notification of protocol revisions and closures 
from the Coordinating Center.  It is the indi vidual Participating Institution’s 
responsibility to notify its IRB of these revisions. 
 
• Non life -threatening revisions:  Participating Institutions will receive written 
notification of protocol revisions regarding non life -threatening events from the 
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 65 Coordinating Center. Non- life-threatening protocol revisions must be IRB 
approved and implemented within 90 days from receipt of the notification. 
 
• Revisions for life -threatening causes:  Participating Institutions will receive 
immediate notification from the Co ordinating Center concerning protocol revisions 
required to protect lives with follow -up by fax, mail, e -mail, etc.  Life -threatening 
protocol revisions will be implemented immediately followed by IRB request for 
approval. 
 
• Protocol closures and temporary holds:  Participating Institutions will receive 
notification of protocol closures and temporary holds from the Coordinating 
Center. Closures and holds will be effective immediately.  In addition, the Coordinating Center, will update the Participating Institutions on an ongoing basis about protocol accrual data so that they will be aware of imminent protocol closures.  
 
3.3 Informed Consent Requirements  
 
The DF/HCC approved informed consent document will serve as a template for the informed consent for Participating Institutions. The Participating Institution consent form must follow the consent template as closely as possible and should adhere to specifications outlined in the DF/HCC Guidance Document on Model Consent Language for PI -Initiated Multi- Center Protoco ls.  This document will be provided separately to 
each Participating Institution.  
 Participating Institutions are to send their version of the informed consent document and HIPAA authorization, if a separate document, to the Coordinating Center for review and 
approval prior to submission to their local IRB. The approved consent form must also be submitted to the Coordinating Center after approval by the local IRB for all consent versions.  The Principal Investigator (PI) at each Participating Institution will identify the physician members of the study team who will be obtaining consent and signing the consent form for therapeutic protocols. Participating institutions must follow the DF/HCC requirement that only attending physicians obtain informed consent and re -consent to interventional 
trials (i.e. drug and/or device trials).   
 
3.4 IRB Documentation  
 
The following must be on file with the Coordinating Center: 
• Initial approval letter of the Participating Institution's IRB.  
• Copy of the Informed Consent Form(s)  approved by the Participating Institution’s 
IRB.  
• Participating Institution’s IRB approval for all amendments.  
• Annual approval letters by the Participating Institution's IRB.  
 
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 66  
3.5 IRB Re -Approval 
 
Verification of IRB re -approval from the Participating Institutions is required in order to 
continue research activities.  There is no grace period for continuing approvals. 
 
The Coordinating Center will not register participants if a re -approval letter is not received  
from the Participating Institution on or before  the anniversary of the previous approval 
date.   
 
 
3.6 Participant Confidentiality and Authorization Statement  
 
In 1996, congress passed the first federal law covering the privacy of health information 
known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountabil ity Act ( HIPPA). Any 
information, related to the physical or mental health of an individual is called Protected 
Health Information (PHI). HIPAA outlines how and under what circumstances PHI can be 
used or disclosed.  
 
In order for covered entities to use or disclose protected health information during the course of a study, the study participant must sign an authorization statement.  This authorization statement may or may not be separate from the informed consent document.  The Coordinating Center, with the approval from the DFCI IRB, will provide a consent template, with information regarding authorization for the disclosure of protected health information.   The DF/HCC Sponsor will use all efforts to limit its use of protected health information in its tr ials. However, because of the nature of these trials, certain protected health 
information must be collected. DF/HCC has chosen to use authorizations, signed by the participant in the trial, rather than limited data sets with data use agreements.  
 
3.6.1  DF/HCC Multi- Center Protocol Confidentiality  
 
All documents, investigative reports, or information relating to the participant are strictly confidential. Whenever reasonably feasible, any participant specific reports (i.e. Pathology Reports, MRI Reports, Operative Reports, etc.) submitted to the Coordinating Center should be de -identified. It is recommended that the assigned DF/HCC ODQ case number 
(as described below) be used for all participant specific documents. Participant initials may be included or retained for cross verification of identification.  
 
 
3.7 DF/HCC Multi -Center Protocol Registration Policy  
 
3.7.1  Participant Registration and Randomization  
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 67 Eligible participants will be registered onto the trial with the DF/HCC Office of Data 
Quality  (ODQ) central registr ation system.  Registration must occur prior to the 
initiation of therapy.  Registration should occur during ODQ’s  normal business hours, 
Monday through Friday from 8:00AM to 5:00PM Eastern Time.  Same day treatment 
registrations and off -hour registrations  for a participant at a non -DF/HCC site will only 
be accepted with prior notice and discussion with the Coordinating Center.  
 
3.7.2 Participant Registration at a non -DF/HCC Site  
 
Eligible participants will be entered on study centrally at the Coordinating Center  by the 
Study Coordinator.  All sites should call the Study Coordinator to verify dose level availabilities.  The required forms mentioned below will be provided to sites by the Coordinating Center during site activation.  Issues that would cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Overall Principal Investigator (PI).  If a participant does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the participant’s registration on the study must be cancelled.  The Study Coordinator should be notified of cancellations as soon as possible.    To register a participant at any non -DF/HCC site, the subsequent procedures must be 
followed.  Contact information for the Coordinating Center is located in section 2.2.1:  1.  The Participating Site should contact the Coordinating Center to: 
a. Notify regarding a potential participant  
b. Confirm the methods of sending documents and communication for the 
registration  
c. Communicate desired timeline for the registration and start date  
 2.  The Participating Site should send the follo wing documents to the Coordinating 
Center:  
a. Completed DF/HCC Eligibility Source Worksheet (ESW), which will be 
provided to site 
b. Copy of all protocol required screening test results, as requested on the ESW 
c. Copy of the pathology and surgical reports, as requested on the ESW 
d. List of all concomitant medications with review by a clinician  
e. Copy of the signed informed consent document 
f. Copy of the signed HIPAA authorization form (if separate from the informed 
consent document) 
 3.  After having received all documentat ion, the Coordinating Center will review the 
documents to verify eligibility.    
4.  The Coordinating Center will register the participant with ODQ and subsequently 
inform the participating site of the successful registration via fax or email which will inclu de: 
a. Participant Identification Number  
b. Applicable dose treatment level  
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors

that the participant has been registered.    
6. After the participant is registered, additional documentation is to  be sent to the 
Coordinating Center if it was not provided in the initial submission.  The specifics and timeline of this will be specified by the Coordinating Center within the instructions of the Eligibility Source Worksheet.   
NOTE:  Registration and randomization with ODQ can only be conducted during 
the business hours of 8:00AM and 5:00PM Eastern Standard Time Monday through Friday.  Same day treatment registrations will only be accepted with prior notice and discussion with the DF/HCC Lead Institution.   
 
3.7.3 Participant Registration at a DF/HCC Site  
 
Please refer to section 4.2 of the protocol 
 
 
3.7.4  Initiation of Therapy  
 
Participants must be registered with the DF/HCC ODQ before  receiving treatment.  
Treatment may not be initiated until the Participating Institution receives confirmation of 
the participant’s registration from the Coordinating Center. The DF/HCC Sponsor and DFCI IRB must be notified of any violations to this policy. 
 
3.7.5  Eligibility Exceptions  
 
The DF/HCC ODQ will make no exceptions to the eligibility requirements for a protocol 
without DFCI IRB approval. The DF/HCC ODQ requires each institution to fully comply 
with this requirement.  
 
  
3.8 DF/HCC Protocol Case Number  
 
At the time of registration, ODQ requires the following identifiers for all subjec ts: 
initials, date of birth, gender, race and ethnicity. Once eligibility has been established and 
the participant successfully registered, the participant is assigned a unique protocol case number.  Participating Institutions should submit all de -identified subsequent 
communication and documents to the Coordinating Center, using this case number to identify the subject.

 69 3.9 Protocol Deviations, Exceptions and Violations 
 
Federal Regulations require an IRB to review proposed changes in a research activity to  
ensure that researchers do not initiate changes in approved research without IRB review 
and approval, except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the participant. DF/HCC requires all departures from the defined procedures set forth in  the 
IRB approved protocol to be reported to the DF/HCC Sponsor, who in turn is responsible for reporting to the DFCI IRB.  
  
For reporting purposes, DF/HCC uses the terms “violation”, “deviation” and “exception” to describe departures from a protocol. All Participating Institutions must adhere to these 
requirements for reporting to the DF/HCC Sponsor and will follow their institutional policy for reporting to their local IRB.  
 
3.9.1  Definitions  
 
Protocol Deviation: Any departure from the defined procedures set f orth in the IRB -
approved protocol which is prospectively approved prior to its implementation.  
 
Protocol Exception:  Any protocol deviation that relates to the eligibility criteria, e.g.  
enrollment of a participant who does not meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
   
Protocol Violation : Any protocol deviation that was not prospectively approved by the 
IRB prior to its  initiation or implementation.   
 
3.9.2  Reporting Procedures  
 
DF/HCC Sponsor:  is responsible for ensuring that clear documentation is available in the 
medical record and/or regulatory documents to describe all protocol exceptions, 
deviations and violations. The DF/HCC Sponsor will also be responsible for ensuring that all protocol violations/deviations are promptly reported per DFCI IRB guidelines.  
 
Participating Institutions : Protocol deviations require prospective approval from the 
DFCI IRB. The Participating Institution must submit the deviation request to the Coordinating Center who will then submit the deviation request to the DFCI IRB. Upon DFCI IRB approval the deviation is submitted to the Participating Institution IRB, per 
institutional policy. A copy of the Participating Institution’s IRB report and determination will be forwarded to the Coordinating Center within 10 business days after the original submission.  
 All protocol violations must be sent to the Coordinating Center in a timely manner.   
Coordinating Center:   Upon receipt of the violation/deviation report from the 
Participating Institution, the Coordinating Center will submit the report to the DF/HCC 
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 70 Sponsor for review. Subsequently, the Participating Institution’s IRB violation/deviation 
report will be submitted to the DFCI IRB for review per DFCI IRB reporting guidelines.   
3.10 Safety Assessments and Toxicity Monitoring 
 
The study te ams at all participating institutions are responsible for protecting the safety, 
rights and well -being of study participants. Recording and reporting of adverse events 
that occur during the course of a study help ensure the continuing safety of study 
participants.  
 All participants receiving investigational agents and/or other protocol mandated treatment will be evaluated for safety. The safety parameters include all laboratory tests and hematological abnormalities, physical examination findings, and spontaneous reports of adverse events reported by participants.  All toxicities encountered during the study will be evaluated according to the NCI criteria specified in the protocol. Life- threatening 
toxicities must be reported immediately to the DF/HCC Sponso r via the Coordinating 
Center.  
 Additional safety assessments and toxicity monitoring will be outlined in the protocol.  
3.10.1  Guidelines for Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
 
Guidelines for reporting Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) are 
detailed in protocol section 11.       Participating Institutions must report the SAEs to the DF/HCC Sponsor and the Coordinating Center following the DFCI IRB Adverse Event Reporting Policy
.  
 The Coordinating Center will maintain documentation of all Participating Institution Adverse Event reports and be responsible for communicati ng to all participating 
investigators, any observations reportable under the DFCI IRB Reporting Requirements.  Participating Institutions will review and submit to their IRB according to their institutional policies and procedures 
 3.10.2  Guidelines for Processin g IND Safety Reports  
 
The DF/HCC Sponsor will review all IND Safety Reports and ensure that all IND Safety 
Reports are distributed to the Participating Institutions. Participating Institutions will review and submit to their IRB according to their institu tional policies and procedures. 
  
  
3.11 Data Management 
 
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 71 The DF/HCC ODQ develops case report forms (CRF/eCRFs), for use with the protocol.  
These forms are designed to collect data for each study. The DF/HCC ODQ provides a 
web based training for eCRF users. 
   
3.11.1  Data Forms Review  
 
Data submissions are monitored for timeliness and completeness of submission. Participating Institutions are notified of their data submission delinquencies in accordance with the following:  
 
Incomplete or Questionable Data  
If study for ms are received with missing or questionable data, the submitting institution 
will receive a written or electronic query from the DF/HCC ODQ Data Analyst, 
Coordinating Center or designee.  Responses to all queries should be completed and submitted within 1 4 calendar days.  Responses may be returned on the written query or 
on an amended paper case report form, or in the case of electronic queries, within the electronic data capture (eDC) system. In the case of a written query for data submitted on 
a paper case report form,  the query must be attached to the specific data being re-
submitted in response.    
Missing Forms  
If study forms are not submitted on schedule, the Participating Institution will receive a Missing Form Report from the Coordinating Center  noting the missing forms.  These 
reports are compiled by the DF/HCC ODQ and distributed on a monthly basis.  
 
 
4. REQUISITIONING INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG  
  
The ordering of investigational agent is specified in the protocol section 7.   Participating Institutions  should order their own agent regardless of the supplier. (i.e., a 
pharmaceutical company) .   
 For investigational agents (Everolimus), participating institutions should ensure that the pharmacy will be able to receive and store the agent according to state and federal requirements. The local IRB should be kept informed of who will supply the agent (i.e., a pharmaceutical company) so that any regulatory responsibilities can be met in a timely fashion.  
 
5. MONITORING: QUALITY CONTROL  
 
The quality control proce ss for a clinical trial requires verification of protocol compliance 
and data accuracy. The Coordinating Center, with the aid of the ODQ provides quality 
control oversight for the protocol.  
5.1 Ongoing Monitoring of Protocol Compliance 
 
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 72 The Participating Institutions may  be required to submit participant source documents to 
the Coordinating Center for monitoring. Participating Institution may also be subject to 
on-site monitoring conducted by the Coordinating Center.   The Coordinating Center will implement ongoing monitoring activities to ensure that Participating Institutions are complying with regulatory and protocol requirements, data quality, and participant safety. Monitoring will occur before the clinical phase of the protocol begins, continue during protocol performance and through study completion. Additional monitoring practices may include but are not limited to; source verification, review and analysis of the following: eligibility requirements of all participants, informed consent procedures, adverse events and all associated documentation, study drug administration/treatment, regulatory files, protocol de partures , pharmacy records, 
response assessments, and data management.  
 Additionally, sites will be required to participate in Coordinating Center  initiated 
teleconferences.  
These will be planned for bi -weekly during Stage 1 of the protocol and monthly during 
Stage 2, although they may be more/less frequent at the discretion of the Protocol Chair. During the teleconferences, sites will be expected t o convey the following information: 
• Updates on participants taking agent: holds, dose reductions, significant 
events, how the participant is doing, whether or not underwent re-consenting 
• Protocol status – which version is being used, and the status of any 
amendments  
• Any reportable adverse events or deviations/violations that have yet to be 
submitted  
• Review of prospective patients 
 If sites are not able to have a representative participant present at the teleconferences, they should email this information to  the Coordinating Center.   
 Virtual Monitoring will be the primary mode of monitoring, although on- site monitoring 
may occur if felt to be necessary by the Coordinating Center and Protocol Chair. Upon request, sites will be required to forward de -identified copies of participants’ medical 
record and source documents to the Coordinating Center to aid in source data verification.  
 Virtual monitoring of participant eligibility, human subject’s protection via the initial informed consent document and process, and screening evaluation completion will occur, if feasible, within 2 weeks of the first participant registration.  
 Interim monitoring visits will occur on the following schedule:  
Once a site has registered a participant, up until all participants have dis continued taking 
study agent (may be in follow -up), interim monitoring visits will occur approximately 
every 6 months, with the primary mode being virtual visits. This frequency may be adjusted depending on accrual, site compliance and Protocol Chair discretion. The first 
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 73 interim monitoring visit will occur approximately two months after the registration of the 
site’s first participant.  
 Once a site is closed to accrual and all participants have discontinued study agent, interim monitoring visits will occur  approximately annually until study completion. 
 Monitoring visits will focus on reviewing some or all of the following: 
• Adverse events and altered results  
• Response assessment including measurements and clinical assessments  
• Study drug administration and accountability 
• Concomitant medications  
• Consent and re-consenting 
• Presence of key documents: original consent, eligibility and screening source 
information, registration confirmation, off treatment and off study forms, collection and transfer of samples  
• Reaso n off treatment and reason off study 
• Timeliness of data completion  
• Completion of study procedures per protocol 
• Agreement between recorded results and source documentation  
• Analysis of data for any events that meet criteria for reportable adverse events, 
dose holds, dose reductions, or discontinuation of treatment  
• Regulatory binder: accessibility, organization, random sampling for relevant 
documents and agreement with the trial master file  
• Collection of research samples per protocol and appropriately entered onto CRFs, 
as this will be the primary mode of tracking samples across sites  
 The Coordinating Center will be available to all sites’ study team members for resolving 
questions and concerns and f acilitating compliance.  
 All data submitted to the DF/HCC ODQ will be monitored for timeliness of submission,  
completeness, and adherence to protocol requirements. The Coordinating Center and if applicable,  ODQ Data Analysts assigned to the protocol, will perform the ongoing 
protocol data compliance monitoring. 
 
5.2 Monitoring Reports  
 
The DF/HCC Sponsor will review all monitoring reports for on- site and remote  
monitoring of Participating Institutions to ensure protocol compliance . The DF/HCC 
Sponsor may increase the monitoring activities at Participating Institutions that are unable to comply with the protocol, DF/HCC Sponsor requirements or federal and local regulations. Participating Institutions may also be subject to an audit as determined by the DF/HCC Sponsor. 
 
5.3 Accrual Monitoring  
 
Everolimus in TSC1 and TSC2 mutated tumors  
13-March -2017  
 74 Prior to extending a protocol to an external site, the DF/HCC Sponsor will establish 
accrual requirements for each participating institution. Accrual will be monitored for each participating institution by the DF/HCC Sponsor or designee. The minimum accrual requirements for this study are  10 subjects per site per year. Sites that are not meeting 
their accrual expectations may be subject to termination.  
   
6. AUDITING: QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 
Auditing is a method of Quality Assurance. Its main focus is to measure whether standards and procedures were followed. Auditing is the systematic and independent examination of all trial related activities and documents.  Audits determine if evaluated activities were appropriately conducted and whether data was generated, recorded and analyzed, and accurately reported per the protocol, Standard Operating Procedures 
(SOPs), and the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). 
 
 
6.1 Audit Plan: DF/HCC Sponsored Trials  
 
This study is IND exempt and a combination of virtual and on -site monitoring will be 
performed by an experienced DF/HCC monitor (Clinical Research Specialist). According to the DF/HCC MCC audit plan guidelines a formal Audit plan is not required for this trial. An audit may be performed by the ODQ at the request of the DF/HCC Sponsor if 
instances on non-compliance are found during routine monitoring. 
  
6.2 Participating Institution  Performance  
 
The DF/HCC Sponsor  and DFCI IRB are charged with considering the totality of an 
institution’s performance in considering institutional participation in the protocol.  
Corrective Actions  
 
Participating Institutions that fail to meet the performance goals of accrual, submission of timely  and accurate data, adherence to protocol requirements, and compliance with state 
and federal regulations, may be recommended for a six -month probation period. Such 
institutions must respond with a corrective action plan and must demonstrate during the probation period that deficiencies have been corrected, as evidenced by the improved performance measures. Participating Institutions that fail to demonstrate significant improvement will be considered by the DF/HCC Sponsor for revocation of participation. A DF/HCC Sponsor and/or the DFCI IRB may terminate a site’s participation if it is determined that a site is not fulfilling its responsibilities as described above.

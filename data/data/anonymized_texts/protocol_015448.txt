2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1      Study Disease  – Leiomyosarcoma of the uterus  
 
Sarcomas vary widely in anatomic location as well as histologic subtype, with the current 
WHO classification listing over 50 distinct histologic subtypes. Prognosis and outcomes 
can vary widely based on histol ogic subtype and location of origin; because of this, 
histology -specific clinical trials in soft tissue sarcomas are necessary to evaluate novel 
therapies in order to optimize the likelihood of identifying both active and inactive agents 
within specific sa rcoma subtypes.  
 
Uterine sarcomas constitute approximately 3% of all uterine malignancies ( Harlow et al, 
1986 ). With an estimated incidence of 0.64 cases per 100,000 women, leiomyosarcoma is 
the most common uterine sarcoma and likely accounts for the single largest site -specific 
group of leiomyosarcomas ( Amant et al, 2009 ).  Localized disease is treated with 
hysterectomy, however rates of local and distant failure are high (45 to 80%), with an 
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
9 estimated median overall survival of two years once disease  is disseminated ( Raut et al, 
2009 ). Management of metastatic disease focuses on disease control and palliation, often 
with a combination of systemic therapies and local treatments, surgery and radiation, as 
indicated. Doxorubicin and gemcitabine based the rapies are the most active regimens in 
this disease with estimated response rates of 20% to 40% with median PFS of 
approximately 5 -8 months ( Omura et al, 1993, Look et al 2004, Hensley et al, 2008) ). 
The most recently FDA approved agent for soft tissue sa rcomas, including ULMS, is 
pazopanib a multi -targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. In a phase III placebo controlled 
trial, pazopanib demonstrated an ORR of 6% and a median PFS of 4.6 months in patients 
with advanced soft tissue sarcomas who had failed stand ard prior therapies ( van der 
Graaf et al, 2012 ). Therefore, ULMS remains a disease with a dire need for additional 
effective systemic therapies.  
 
The primary biologic underpinnings of ULMS continue to be elucidated. The exact 
mechanisms of action of pazopa nib leading to benefit in soft tissue sarcomas remain 
unclear. There are no other successfully “targeted” approaches to the disease. ULMS is 
cytogenetically complex. Several pathways and signal intermediates have been 
investigated in leiomyosarcoma, and re levance of PI3K/AKT pathway activation has 
been consistently demonstrated throughout several studies. Indeed, genomic deletion of 
chromosome 10q targets PTEN tumor suppressor gene and leads to hyperactivation of 
PI3K/AKT, which is a common finding in leiom yosarcoma. Somatic TP53 mutations are 
estimated to be present in 50 -60% of cases, however the primary drivers of the malignant 
phenotype of the disease remain poorly understood.  
 
Interestingly, a relationship between tumor immune infiltration, specifical ly 
macrophages, and outcomes in LMS has been reported ( Espinosa et al, 2009, Ganjoo et 
al 2011) ).  To date, this data has been limited to prognostication, such that patients with 
more extensive tumor macrophage infiltration, and gene signature consistent with CSF1 
and related proteins have inferior outcomes ( Espinosa et al, 2009 ). The relationship of 
these findings to underlying tumor biology and response to specific therapies continues to 
be explored, however, this finding which has been uniquely reported  in LMS subtype of 
soft tissue sarcomas, suggests that immune infiltration and disease control may be 
relevant in this specific subtype of soft tissue sarcoma.  In addition, there has been least 
one objective PR (duration unknown at this time ) observed wit h an antiPD1 monoclonal 
antibody in one patient with metastatic ULMS demonstrating that this class of drugs has 
activity in at least a subset set of patients with advanced ULMS (S. George, personal 
communication, 27aug2014).  
 
 
 
2.2 CTEP  IND Agent  
 
2.2.1 Nivolumab  
 
Nivolumab (BMS -936558, MDX -1106, and ONO -4538) is a fully human monoclonal 
immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody (HuMAb) that is specific for human programmed 
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
10 death -1 (PD -1, cluster of differentiation 279 [CD279]) cell surface membrane receptor 
(Investigator Br ochure, 2013).  PD -1 is a negative regulatory molecule that is expressed 
transiently following T -cell activation and on chronically stimulated T cells characterized 
by an “exhausted” phenotype.  Nivolumab binds to cynomolgus monkey PD -1 but not 
mouse, rat,  or rabbit molecules.  Clinical activity of nivolumab has been observed in 
patients with melanoma, non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC).   The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab (anti -cytotoxic T lymphocyte 
associated ant igen-4 [anti -CTLA -4]) in a phase 1/2 trial showed markedly enhanced 
clinical activity with an acceptable safety profile in melanoma patients (Wolchok et al., 
2013).   
 
The clinical use of monoclonal antibodies to T -cell inhibitory receptors has provided 
transformative information on the nature of the immune system and cancer.  An emerging 
picture suggests that endogenous immune responses can mediate effective tumor 
regression and/or improved survival even in patients with large volume tumors resistant 
to other forms of therapy.  Some of the unique features of this type of therapy, based 
largely on experience in advanced melanoma, include:  improved overall survival (OS) 
with or without radiographic responses or improved progression -free survival (PFS); 
respo nses that may be delayed or occur after radiographic disease progression; 
combinations of immune modulators with enhanced or novel activities (in the example of 
ipilimumab and nivolumab); and toxicity that is almost exclusively immune or 
inflammatory in na ture.  It is not yet clear what factors determine responses and which 
components of the immune system are needed for this to occur.  It seems likely that both 
memory helper and effector cells would be needed to sustain long -term responses. 
Increasing  emph asis has been placed on understanding the relationships of the tumor,  
celluar  infiltrate,  and immunologic milieu surrounding each tumor.   
 
PD-1, a 55 -kDa type 1 transmembrane protein, is a member of the CD28 family of T -cell 
co-stimulatory receptors that include Ig super family member CD28, CTLA -4, inducible 
co-stimulator (ICOS), and B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) (Investigator 
Brochure , 2013).  PD -1 is transiently but highly expressed on activated T cells 
functioning to limit immune effectors at the site of activation.  Chronic stimulation may 
prevent the re -methylation of the PD -1 gene leading to continuous  expression and 
characterize s a state of “exhausted” T cells that lose function and proliferative capacity 
while enhancing a suppressive tumor microenvironment.  PD -1 may act together with 
other T -cell modulating molecules, including CTLA -4, TIM -3, lymphocyte -activation 
gene 3 (LAG -3) as well as indoleamine -pyrrole 2,3 -dioxygenase 1 (IDO -1), cytokines, 
and transforming growth factor beta (TGF -beta).   
 
Two ligands specific for PD -1 have been identified:  PD -ligand 1 (PD -L1, also known as 
B7-H1 or CD274, expressed on tumor, antigen -presenting cells [APCs], and dendritic 
cells [DCs]) and PD -L2 (also known as B7 -DC or CD273, expressed on endothelial 
cells).  The interaction of PD -1 with PD -L1 and PD -L2 results in negative regulatory 
stimuli that down -modulate the activated T -cell immune r esponse through SHP -1 
phosphastase.   
 
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
11 PD-1 knockout mice develop strain -specific lupus -like glomerulonephritis (C57BL/6) 
and cardiomyopathy (BALB/c).  In transplantable tumor models that expressed PD -1 and 
LAG -3 on tumor -infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells  dual anti -LAG -3/anti -PD-1 antibody 
treatment cured most mice of established tumors that were largely resistant to single 
antibody treatment (Woo et al., 2012).  Despite minimal immunopathologic sequelae in 
PD-1 and LAG -3 single knockout mice, dual knockou t mice abrogated self -tolerance 
with resultant autoimmune infiltrates in multiple organs, leading to eventual lethality.  
 
PD-L1 expression is found on a number of tumors, and is associated with poor prognoses 
based on OS in many tumors, including melanoma (Taube et al., 2012), renal (Thompson 
et al., 2004; Thompson et al., 2005; Thompson et al., 2006), esophageal (Ohigashi, et al.  
2005), gastric (Wu et al., 2006), ovarian (Dong et al., 2003), pancreatic (Nomi, et al., 
2007), lung (Zitvogel, et al., 2006), a nd other cancers (Investigator Brochure, 2013).  
 
The PD -1/PD -L1 axis plays a role in human infections, particularly in hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).  In these cases, high expression levels 
of PD -1 were found in viral -speci fic CD8+ T cells that also display a non -responsive or 
exhausted phenotype.  Non -responsive PD -1-high T cells were observed in simian 
immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in rhesus macaques.  Treatment of SIV -infected 
macaques with an anti -PD-1 mAb (3 mg /kg x4) resulted in decreased viral loads and 
increased survival along with expanded T cells with increased T -cell functionality.   
 
 
2.2.1.1  Nonclinical Development of Nivolumab  
 
In intravenous (IV) repeat -dose toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys, nivolumab 
alone was well tolerated (Investigator Brochure, 2013).  Combination studies have 
highlighted the potential for toxicity when combined with ipilimumab, MDX -1408, and 
BMS -986016.  Nivolumab bound specifically to PD -1 (and not to related members of the 
CD28 family such as CD28, ICOS, CTLA -4, and BTLA) with a K d = 3.06 nM.  A 
surrogate rat anti -mouse PD -1 antibody (4H2) was derived and expressed as chimeric 
IgG1 murine antibody.  Antitumor activity was seen for several tumor models, including 
colon carcinoma a nd fibrosarcoma.  
 
 
2.2.1.2  Clinical Development of Nivolumab  
 
Nivolumab is being evaluated as monotherapy and in combination with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy, other immunotherapy (such as ipilimumab), anti -angiogenesis therapy, 
and targeted therapies in completed and ongoing BMS -sponsored clinical trials in 
NSCLC, melanom a, RCC, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), gastrointestinal (GI) 
malignancies including microsatellite instability (MSI) in colorectal cancer, and triple -
negative breast cancer (TNBC) with an expanding group of indications (Investigator 
Brochure, 2013).  In a ddition, two investigator -sponsored trials (ISTs) of nivolumab in 
combination with a peptide vaccine in melanoma are being conducted in the adjuvant 
setting and advanced disease.  
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018

Seven nivolumab studies were conducted in Japan, including six studies in a dvanced 
solid tumors and recurrent or unresectable stage III/IV melanoma sponsored by Ono 
Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd., and one IST in recurrent or advanced platinum -refractory 
ovarian cancer.   
 
 
2.2.1.2.1  Pharmacokinetics  
 
Pharmacokinetics (PK) of nivolumab was linear  in the range of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg, with 
dose-proportional increases in maximum serum concentration (C max) and area under the 
concentration -time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC 0-∞), with low to moderate inter -
subject variability observed at each dose l evel (Investigator Brochure, 2013).  Clearance 
of nivolumab is independent of dose in the dose range (0.1 to 10 mg/kg) and tumor types 
studied.  Body weight normalized dosing showed approximately constant trough 
concentrations over a wide range of body wei ghts.  The mean terminal elimination half -
life of BMS -936558 is 17 to 25 days consistent with the half -life of endogenous IgG4.   
 
 
2.2.1.2.2  Efficacy  
 
In a phase 1 (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg nivolumab doses) dose -escalation study the 3 mg/kg 
dose was chosen for expanded cohorts. Among 236 patients, objective responses (ORs) 
(complete or partial responses [CR or PR]) were seen in NSCLC, melanoma, and RCC.  
ORs w ere observed at all doses (Sznol et al., 2013).  Median OS was 16.8 months across 
doses and 20.3 months at the 3 mg/kg dose.  Median OS across all dose cohorts was 9.2 
months and 9.6 months for squamous and non -squamous NSCLC, respectively (Brahmer 
et al., 2013).  In the RCC cohort, median duration of response was 12.9 months for both 
doses with 5 of the 10 responses lasting ≥1 year (Drake et al., 2013).   
 
In an advanced melanoma phase 1 study, nivolumab and ipilimumab were administered 
IV every 3 weeks fo r 4 doses followed by nivolumab alone every 3 weeks for 4 doses 
(concurrent regimen) (Wolchok et al., 2013).  The combined treatment was subsequently 
administered every 12 weeks for up to 8 doses.  In a sequenced regimen, patients 
previously treated with i pilimumab received nivolumab every 2 weeks for up to 48 doses.  
In the concurrent regimen (53 patients), 53% of patients had an OR at doses 1 mg/kg 
nivolumab and 3 mg/kg ipilimumab, with tumor reduction of 80% or more (modified 
World Health Organization [m WHO] criteria).  In the sequenced -regimen (33 patients), 
the objective response rate (ORR) was 20%.  
 
In a phase 1 study of nivolumab plus platinum -based doublet chemotherapy (PT -doublet) 
in chemotherapy -naïve NSCLC patients, 43 patients were treated with n ivolumab + PT -
doublet (Rizvi et al., 2013).  No dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported and 
total/confirmed ORRs were 43/33%, 40/33%, and 31/31% in 
nivolumab/gemcitabine/cisplatin, nivolumab/pemetrexed/cisplatin, and 
nivolumab/carboplatin/paclitaxel arms, respectively.

2.2.1.2.3  Toxicology  
 
A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of nivolumab was not defined (Topalian et al., 2012).  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 32 of 296 patients (11%) similar to the 
immune -related inflammatory events seen with ipilimumab:  pneumonitis, vitiligo, 
colitis, hepatitis, hypophysitis, and thyroiditis (with noted pulmonary toxicity r esulting in 
3 deaths. Renal failure, symptomatic pancreatic and DM, neurologic events, and 
vasculitis have also been reported.).   In combination with ipilimumab in the concurrent -
regimen group (Wolchok et al., 2013), grade 3 or 4 treatment -related events were noted 
in 53% of patients.  Skin rash represents the majority of these event.  
 
 
2.2.1.2.4  Pharmacodynamics/Biomarkers  
 
Tumor -cell expression (melanoma) of PD -L1 was characterized in combination with 
ipilimumab with the use of IHC staining and pharmacodynamics c hanges in the 
peripheral -blood absolute lymphocyte count (Wolchok et al., 2013).  With PD -L1 
positivity defined as expression in at least 5% of tumor cells, biopsy specimens from 21 
of 56 patients (38%) were PD -L1–positive.  Among patients treated with the  concurrent 
regimen of nivolumab and ipilimumab, ORs were observed in patients with either PD -
L1–positive tumor samples (6 of 13 patients) or PD -L1–negative tumor samples (9 of 
22).  In the sequenced regimen cohorts, a higher number of overall responses wa s seen 
among patients with PD -L1–positive tumor samples (4 of 8 patients) than among patients 
with PD -L1–negative tumor samples (1 of 13) suggesting the possibility that these tumors 
have higher response rates to the combination. The relationship between P DL-1 
expression and responses may not be present in patients treated with the combination.  
Tissue expression of PDL -2, interferon -γ (IFN - γ), IDO, and T cell CD8+ are of current 
interest.  Until more reliable data based on standardized procedures for tiss ue collection 
and assays are available, PD -L1 status cannot be used to select patients for treatment at 
this time.   
 
 
2.3 Other Agent(s)  
 
 
2.3.1 Ipilimumab  
 
Ipilimumab is a fully human anti -cytotoxic T -lymphocyte antigen -4 (CTLA -4) IgG1 
monoclonal antibody. Following antigen presentation by peptide/major 
histocompatability complex, full activation of T cell requires co -stimulatory signals 
provided by binding o f CD28 (expressed on T cells) and B7 molecules present on antigen 
presenting cells. This interaction is crucial for T cell activation and proliferation. CTLA4 
antigen is induced on the surgace of T cell upon activation and is a member of the 
CD28:B7 immuno globulin superfamily that competes with greater avidity with CD28 for 
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
14 B7.1 and B7.2 (CD80 and CD86). CTLA4 ligation with B7 molecules down -regulates T -
cell response resulting in diminished cytokine production and T cell proliferation. 
Binding of ipilimumab  to CTLA -4 with B7 thereby potentiates antitumor T -cell 
activation and proliferation ( Krummel et al., 1995, Kearney et al. 1995) . 
 
Ipilimumab efficacy as monotherapy was demonstrated in two phase III studies in 
advanced melanoma, where treatment with ipili mumab resulted in clinically meaningful 
and statistically significant survival benefit. The MDX10 -20 evaluated ipilimumab (3 
mg/kg) with or without a melanoma specific vaccine (gp100)  compared with gp100 alone 
in pre -treated advanced melanoma patients. The  median overall survival was 10 months 
with ipilimumab treatment (with or without gp100) versus 6.4 months for gp100 therapy 
alone  (Hodi et al., 2010) . 
 
The CA184024 trial compared ipilimumab at a higher dose (10 mg/kg) plus dacarbazine 
versus dacarbazine alone in treatment naive advanced melanoma patients. Overall 
survival was improved in the ipilimumab plus dacarbazine group compared to the 
dacarbazine g roup (11.2 months vs 9.1 months, respectively)  (Robert et al., 2011) . Both 
trials demonstrated objective responses of 10 -15% with ipilimumab treatment and grade 
3 or 4 immune -related toxicities or colitis (5.3%), diarrhea (4.6%), endocrinopathies 
(3.8%) an d rash (0.8%).  
 
A pooled overall survival analysis based on studies with more than 1800 ipilimumab 
treated patients with advanced melanoma showed a plateau of overall survival at 3 -years 
confirming durability of response and long term survival in ipilimum ab treated patients  
(Schadendorf et al., 2015) .  
 
 
2.4 Summary of Nivolumab and ipilimumab combination data  
 
 
 
The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab in untreated advanced melanoma patients 
was evaluated in a phase III trial (CheckMate -067) and demonstrat ed significant 
improvement in objective response rate and progression free survival with the 
combination therapy compared with either nivolumab or ipilimumab as monotherapy. In 
this trial, ipilimumab was given at 3 mg/kg every 3 -weeks for four cycles and n ivolumab 
was given at 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four cycles, and then escalated to 3 mg/kg every 
2-weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity  (Larkin et al., 2015) .  
 
The median progression -free survival was 11.5 months with nivolumab plus ipilimumab , 
as compared with 2.9 months with ipilimumab and 6.9 months with nivolumab. The rates 
of investigator -assessed objective response were 43.7% in the nivolumab group, 57.6% in 
the nivolumab -plus-ipilimumab group, and 19.0% in the ipilimumab group.  Grade 3 or 4 
treatment related adverse events were more common in the combination arm (55%) than 
with nivolumab (16.3%) or ipilimumab (27.3%) arms, with diarrhea (9.3%), colitis 
(7.7%) and rash (4.8%) the most clinically common, and elevation of ALT (8.3% ) and 
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
15 AST (6.1%) levels the most common laboratory abnormalities in the nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab arm. Treatment related adverse events leading to discontinuation were 
observed in 36.4% of patients in the combination arm. Ipilimumab and nivolumab 
combinati on therapy has also been tested in the CheckMate -012 trial which evaluated 
different doses and schedules for the combination in 148 previously untreated advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer patients  (Rizvi et al., 2015) . 
 
Four administration/dosing schedule s for the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab 
were evaluated. In arm A, both agents were administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg every 3 
weeks (Q3W, N = 31). In arm B nivolumab was administered at 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks 
(Q2W ) plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 w eeks (Q6W; N = 40). Arm C and D dosed 
nivolumab at 3 mg/kg Q2W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 12 weeks (Q12W; N = 38) or 
Q6W (N = 39). Activity was observed in all arms with arms containing nivolumab at 3 
mg/kg  showing the best objective response rate (39% i n arm C and 31% in arm D) and 
arms B and A demonstrating 25% and 13% response rates respectively, whereasPFS 
correlated less with nivolumab dose with median PFS of 10.6 months, 4.9 months, 8 and 
8.3 months for arms A, B, C, and D respectively).  
 
Treatment - emergent grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 28% to 35% of patients in 
each group but led to discontinuation in just 3% to 10% of cases. All grade treatment -
related AEs occurred in 77%, &3%, 74%, and 69% of patients in groups A, B, C, and D, 
respecti vely. The safety profile was consistent with previous studies of the combination, 
and the discontinuation rate associated with AEs was similar to rates observed with 
nivolumab alone. The only grade 3/4 adverse events that occurred in as many as 10% of 
patients were hepatic in arm B (10%) and skin -related in arm C and D (13%). Grade 3/4  
pulmonary AEs occurred in no more than 3% of patients in any of the groups. There were 
no treatment -related deaths in the trial.  
 
2.5 Rationale  
 
ULMS is a complex karyotype mali gnancy without a clear oncogenic driver, and 
although cytotoxic chemotherapy may lead to disease control in a subset of patients for 
some number of months, it is a disease with a median overall survival of 2 years 
following the development of metastatic di sease. Effective therapies are desperately 
needed.   
 
The rationale underlying synergistic immunotherapeutic effects is that each dysfunctional 
antitumor T cell could be kept unresponsive by more than one repressor and could only 
be fully capable to exert its functions when completly released from checkpoint 
inhibition. Combining immune checkpoint inhibitors to block more than one 
immunomodulatory pathway thereby may further enhance the antitumor efficacy of each 
individual treatment. Although PD -1 and CTLA -4 are both coinhibitory mechanisms to 
limit T cell activation, evidence suggests that they use distinct mechanisms to limit T cell 
activation, and preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that the combination of 
nivolumab and ipilimumab may be synergisti c. 
 
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
16 Preclinical data have shown that ipilimumab treatment may lead to broadening of specific 
killer T cell response in melanoma, pointing towards a role in the priming of cancer -
specific T cell immunity. In addition, evidence is emerging that CTLA4 -specifi c 
antibodies can promote the depletion of regulatory T cells specifically in tumors, and 
increase PD -1+, PDL1+ and CTLA -4+ tumor infiltrating T cells. Conversely, nivolumab 
has been shown to increase peripheral CTLA -4+ and regulatory T cells in subjects 
without clinical response. There is growing evidence of benefit of nivolumab in solid 
tumors, even those without a clear immunologic driver, and the FDA approval for 
nivolumab in 2015 for non -small cell lung cancer is expected to be followed in other 
solid tumors as well, Furthermore, combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab 
has shown superior efficacy over nivolumab monotherapy in melanoma and was granted 
FDA approval. Advanced clinic al trials in other solid tumors (non -small cell lung cancer, 
renal cell carcinoma) are currently ongoing with encouraging preliminary results. Most 
interestingly, results of subgroup analyses in the Checkmate -067 suggest that the greatest 
benefit with the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab versus nivolumab alone may 
occur in the context of negative PD -L1 tumor expression. In this trial, in the subgroup of 
patients with PD -L1 positive tumors, both nivolumab alone and nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab resulted i n a similar prolongation of progression -free survival as compared 
with ipilimumab alone, although objective response rates were numerically higher in the 
combination group than in either monotherapy group. However, among patients with a 
negative PD -L1 tumo r status, the median progression -free survival was 11.2 months for 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab compared with 5.3 months with nivolumab, and 2.8 months 
ipilimumab monotherapy. This observation of at least additive activity of the combination 
of nivolumab plus  ipilimumab in the context of negative PD -L1 expression may be of 
particular interst in uterine leiomyosarcoma. A profound and durable response observed 
in one patient with metastatic ULMS (S. George, personal communication , 27Aug2014 ) 
should serve as a pr oof for anti PD -1 drug class activity in at least a subset of patients 
with advanced ULMS . Cohort A of th e current protocol (nivolumab  as a single agent in 
advan ced ULMS) has been completed with no respons es observed ; therefore , the protocol 
has been amend ed to include Cohort B, defined as the combination of nivo lumab  plus 
ipilimumab, with the rational e that this combination may provide  enhanced immune 
response and increased tumor response rate.  
 
2.6 Correlative Studies Background  
 
Nivolumab was initially tho ught to be most effective in tumors which express PDL1, a 
marker that may vary in a variety of tumor samples over time, however, with increased 
experience with  this agent, it appears that both PDL1 and nonPDL1 expressing tumors 
may benefit from nivolumab,  either as a single agent or in combination with ipilmumab. 
Development of biomarkers for response to nivolumab remain under active investigation 
and are a critical aspect to study design.  
 
We aim to explore the relationship between ORR and PFS to general  immune response 
(CD3, CD4, CD8, FOX -P3, CD68, CD63) as well as more specific markers of 
immunomodulation including PD -1, PDL -1, PDL -2. We hypothesize that the expression 
of these markers, either alone or in combination, may lead to the identification of a  subset 
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
17 of patients with ULMS who are more likely to respond to nivolumab . This evaluation 
will be performed on archival tumor material for all participants when available, and in 
paired pre/post -treatment biopsies in up to10 participants. In addition, we have extensive 
experience using digital scanning of pathology slides and using image analysis to 
quantify immune infiltrates which will be applied to this cohort and related to response 
(14) . This work will be performed under the direction of Scott Rodig,  MD, PhD  and at 
the Center for Immuno -oncology Pathology Core at Dana Farber –Harvard Cancer Center  
housed in the Specialized Histopathology Core at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital.  
The immuno -onology core at  Dana -Farber Harvard Cancer Center  (DFHCC ) has 
optimized IHC for these markers ( Chen et al, 2013 ) and is actively developing IHC for 
IDO.  
 
The immuno -oncology core lab at DFHCC  evaluation of gene expression profiling with 
the aim of identification of an immune gene signature with the goal of  identif y patients 
more likely to respond  to therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Therefore, when 
material is available, we plan to evaluate targeted expression profiling for immune 
response signature on FFPE using nanostring platform at the immuno -onolocogy core at 
DFHCC  (Scott et al, 2014 ). 
 
3. PATIENT SELECTION  
 
 
3.1 Eligibility Criteria  
3.1.1 Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced leiomyosarcoma 
of the uterus (ULMS). Advanced ULMS is defined as metastatic ULMS or unresectable 
primary ULMS.  
 
 
3.1.2 Patients must  have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non -
nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥20 mm (≥2 cm) with conventional 
techniques or as ≥10 mm (≥1 cm) with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exa m.  
See Section 11 for the evaluation of measurable disease  
 
3.1.3 Patients must have received at least one prior  line of chemotherapy , for ULMS  (either in 
the adjuvant or metastatic setting).  
 
3.1.4 Age > 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currentl y available on the 
use of nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients <18 years of age, children are excluded 
from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.  
 
3.1.5 ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (see Appendix A).  
 
3.1.6 Life expectancy of greater than 9 months.  
 
3.1.7 Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

- absolute neutrophil count  ≥1,500/mcL  
- platelets  ≥100,000/mcL  
- total bilirubin  ≤1.5× institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) 
(except patients with Gilbert Syndrome, who can have total bilirubin <3.0 mg/dL)  
 
- AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT)  ≤2.5× ULN/  ≤5xULN for subjects with liver 
metastases  
 
- Serum creatinine  ≤1.5× ULN  
OR 
- creatinine clearance (CrCl)  ≥50 mL/min (if using the Cockcroft -Gault formula 
below):  
Female  CrCl = (140 - age in years) x weight in kg x 0.85  
72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL  
 
3.1.8 Patients with a requirement for steroid treatment or other immunosuppressive treatment:  
Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatm ent with 
either corticosteroids (>10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive 
medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and 
adrenal replacement doses >10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are perm itted in the 
absence of active autoimmune disease.  
 
3.1.9 The effects of nivolumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason 
women of child -bearing potential  (WOCBP)  must agree to use adequate contraception 
(hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the 
duration of study participation.  WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid 
pregnancy for 31weeks after the last dose of investigational drug.  Women of 
childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum 
sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of 
nivolumab.  Women must not be breastfeeding.    Women w ho are not of childbearing 
potential ( i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile) do not require contraception.   
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
19  
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has 
experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical ster ilization (hysterectomy or 
bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal.  Menopause is defined clinically 
as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or 
physiological causes.  In ad dition, women under the age of  55 must have a documented 
serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less than 40 mIU/mL.   
 
WOCBP receiving nivolumab will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 
31 weeks after the last dose of investigational product.  These durati ons have been 
calculated using the upper limit of the half -life for nivolumab (25 days) and are based on 
the protocol requirement that WOCBP use contraception for 5 half -lives plus 30 days.  
 
Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while p articipating in this 
study, she should inform the treating physician immediately.  
 
The effects of nivolumab  on the developing human fetus are unknow n.   
 
3.1.10  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.  
  
3.1.11  For enrollment in the first stage of Cohort B, patients must have accessible pre -treatment 
and post -treatment (4 -6 weeks) tumor for biopsy.  
 
 
 
3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
3.2.1 Patients who have had chemo therapy or radiotherapy within 4  weeks (6 weeks for 
nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered 
from adverse events (AEs) due to  agents administered more than 3  weeks earlier.   
Patients who have had prior pelvic radiation may be at increased r isk for bowel 
perforation, and therefore may not have residual inflammatory disease of the bowel or 
residual bowel toxicity based on baseline imaging and clinical assessment. Palliative 
(limited -field) radiation therapy is permitted, if all of the followin g criteria are met:  
 
1) Repeat imaging demonstrates no new sites of bone metastases.  
2) The lesion being considered for palliative radiation is not a target lesion.  
3) Bowel toxicity is not expected from the target field due to increased risk of 
perforation  
 
3.2.2 Patien ts who are  receiving any other investigational agents.  
 
3.2.3 Patients are excluded if they have had prior treatment with an anti -PD-1, anti -PD-L1, 
anti-PD-L2, anti -CTLA -4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting 
T-cell co -stimulation or im mune checkpoint pathways .   
 
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
20 3.2.4 Active brain metastasis or leptomeningeal disease. Patients with known brain metastases 
are allowed  if metastases have been treated and there is no magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) evidence of progression for at least 12 weeks  after treatment is complete and 
within 28 days prior to the first dose of nivolumab administration.  There must also be no 
requirement for immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (>10 mg/day 
prednisone equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior to  study drug administration.  
 
3.2.5 History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic 
composition to nivolumab . 
 
3.2.6 History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody.  
 
3.2.7 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, 
symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or 
psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.  
 
3.2.8 Pregnant women ar e excluded from this  study because the effects of nivolumab on the 
developing fetus are unknown.  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse 
events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with  nivolumab, 
breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated  with nivolumab.  
 
3.2.9 Because the effects of nivolumab on chronic viral infection are not well known, patients 
should be excluded if they have known history of testing positive for human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or k nown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)  
or if they have a positive test for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis 
C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV antibody) indicating acute or chronic infection.  
 
 
3.2.10  Patients with active autoimmune dis ease or history of autoimmune disease that might 
recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment 
inclu ding systemic corticosteroids, are excluded.  These include but are not limited to 
patients with a history of immune related neurologic disease,  multiple sclerosis, 
autoimmune (demyelinating)  neuropathy, Guillain -Barre syndrome, myasthenia gravis; 
systemic autoimmune disease such as SLE, connective tissue diseases, scleroderma, 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn’s , ulcerative colitis, hepatitis; and patients 
with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens -Johnson syndrome, or 
phospholipid syndrome should be excluded because of the risk of recurrence or 
exacerbation of disease.  Patients with vitiligo, e ndocrine deficiencies including 
thyroiditis managed with replacement hormones including physiologic corticosteroids are 
eligible.  Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, Sjögren’s syndrome 
and psoriasis controlled with topical medicati on and patients with positive serology, such 
as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti -thyroid antibodies should be evaluated for the 
presence of target organ involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but 
should otherwise be eligible.  
 
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
21 3.2.11  Patients are  permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual 
hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, 
psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the 
absence of an external trigger ( precipitating event) . 
 
3.2.12  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with 
either corticosteroids (>10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive 
medications within 14 days of study d rug administration.  Inhaled or topical steroids and 
adrenal replacement doses <10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the 
absence of active autoimmune disease.  Patients are permitted to use topical, ocular, intra -
articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption).  
Physiologic rep lacement doses of systemic corticosteroids are permitted, even if <10 
mg/day prednisone equivalents.  A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis ( e.g., 
contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non -autoimmune conditions ( e.g., delayed -type 
hypersens itivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted.  
 
3.2.13  Patients who have had evidence of active or acute diverticulitis, intra -abdominal abscess, 
GI obstruction , fistula  and abdominal carcinomatosis which are known risk factors for 
bowel perforation s hould be evaluated for the potential need for additional treatment 
before coming on study.  
 
3.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
 
Every attempt will be made to enter all eligible patients into this protocol and therefore address 
the study objectives in a patient population representative of the  population of women with 
advanced leiomyosarcoma of the uterus treated by participating i nstitutions.   
 
Please see the Planned Enrollment Report (table in Section 13.2).

4.3 Patient Registration  
 
4.3.1 OPEN / IWRS  
 
Patient enrollment will be facilitated using the Oncology Patient Enrollment Network 
(OPEN).  OPEN is a web -based registration  system available to users on a 24/7 basis .  It 
is integrated with the CTSU Enterprise System for regulatory and roster data interchange  
and with  the Theradex Interactive Web Response System (IWRS)  for retrieval of patient 
registration/randomization assign ment.  Patient enrollment data entered by Registrars in 
OPEN / IWRS will automatically transfer to the NCI’s clinical data management system, 
Medidata Rave.  
 
For trials with slot reservation requirements, OPEN will connect to IWRS at enrollment 
initiation to check slot availability.  Registration staff should ensure that a slot is 
available and secured for the patient before completing an  enrollment.  
 
The OPEN  system will provide the site with a printable confirmation of registrati on and 
treatment informati on.  Please print this confirmation for your records.   
 
4.3.2 OPEN/IWRS User Requirements  
 
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018

4.4 General Guidelines  
 
Following registration, patients should begin protocol treatment within 21 days. Issues that 
would cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Principal Investigator.  If a patient 
does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the patient’s registration on the study 
may be canceled.  The Study Coordinator should be notified of cancellations as soon as possible.  
 
 
5 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
 
5.1 Agent Administration  
 
Treatment wi ll be administered on an outpatient  basis.  Reported adverse events and potential 
risks are described in Section 7.  Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 6.  No 
investigational or commercial agents or therapies other than those described  below may be 
administered with the intent to treat the patient's malignancy.  
 
5.1.1 COHORT A  (nivo lumab  alone) - Closed to Accrual  
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
26  
Cohort A opened for accrual on 13-May-2015 ; accrual to this cohort was completed on  21-Oct-
2015 . All participants in Cohort A received Nivolumab monotherapy as per the below dosing 
instructions.  
 
Nivolumab will be given every two weeks (±2 days) at a dose of 3 mg/kg. Patients may be dosed 
no less than 12 days from the previous dose of drug.  
The dosing calculations should be bas ed on the actual body weight.  If the patient’s weight on the 
day of dosing differs by >10% from the weight used to calculate the original dose, the dose must 
be recalculated.  Actual body weight at each visit may be used to calculate dose, as per 
instituti onal standard.   All doses should be rounded as per institutional standard .  There will be 
no dose modifications allowed.   
 
Nivolumab is to be administered over an  approximately  60-minute IV infusion, using a 
volumetric pump with a 0.2 -1.2 micron in -line filter at the protocol -specified dose.  The drug can 
be diluted with 0.9% normal saline for delivery but the total drug concentration of the solution 
cannot be below 0.35 mg/mL. It is not to be administered as an IV push or bolus injection.  At 
the end of the infusion, flush the line with a sufficient quantity of normal saline.  . 
 
5.1.2 COHORT B (n ivolumab  and ipilimumab)  
 
Cohort B explores combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab. All participants 
enrolled to t his cohort will receive niv olumab in combination with ipilimumab as per the dosing 
instructions below.  
 
 Nivolumab will be given every three  weeks (±2 days) at a dose of 3 mg/kg  together with 
ipilimumab at a dose of 1 mg/kg for 4 -cycles. Starting at cycle 5, nivolumab will be given  as a 
monotherapy every two weeks at a dose of 3 mg/kg .  Patients may be dosed no less than 12 days 
from the previous dose of drug. The dosing calculations should be based on the actual body 
weight.  If the patient’s weight on the day of dosing differs by >10% from the weight used to 
calculate the original dose, the dose must be recalculated.  Actual body weight at each visit may 
be used to calculate dose, as per institutional standard.   All doses should be rounded as per 
institutional standard .  There will be no dose modifications allowed.   
 
Nivolumab is to be administered over an approximately  60-minute IV infusion, using a 
volumetric pump with a 0.2 -1.2 micron in -line filter at the protocol -specified dose.  The drug can 
be diluted with 0.9% normal saline for delivery but the total drug concentration of the solution 
cannot be below 0.35 mg/mL. It is not to be administered as an IV push or bolus injection.  At 
the end of the infusion, flush the line with a sufficient quantity of normal saline.  
 
Ipilimumab in jection can be used for IV administration without dilution after transferring to a 
PVC (polyvinyl chloride), non -PVC/non -DEHP (di -(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate) or glass containers 
and is stable for 24 hours at 2 -8°C or room temperature/room light (RT/RL). Ipili mumab is to be 
administered as a 90 -minute IV infusion, using a volumetric pump with a 0.2 to 1.2 micron in -
line filter at the protocol -specified dose. The drug can be diluted with 0.9% normal saline or 5% 
dextrose injection to concentrations between 1 mg/ mL and 4 mg/mL. It is not to be administered 
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
27 as an IV push or bolus injection. Care must be taken to assure sterility of the prepared solutions, 
since the drug product does not contain any antimicrobial preservatives or bacteriostatic agents. 
At the end of  the infusion, flush the line with a sufficient quantity of normal saline or 5% 
dextrose solution.  
 
Separate infusion bags and filters must be used for each infusion of nivolumab and ipilimumab. 
Nivolumab is to be administered first. The nivolumab infusio n must be promptly followed by a 
saline flush to clear the line of nivolumab before starting the ipilimumab infusion.  
 
 
5.1.3 Other Modality(ies) or Procedures

Not applicable  
 
5.2 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
 
Not applicable  
 
5.3 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Nivolumab is a human monoclonal antibody and as such is not expected to be metabolized by  
cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes or other typical drug metabolizin g enzymes. Thus, it is not  
expected to have any effect on CYP or other drug metabolizing enzymes in terms of inhibition or  
induction, and is, therefore, not expected to induce this type of PK -based drug interactions.  
 
5.4 Duration of Therapy  
 
In the absence o f treatment delays due to adverse event (s), treatment may continue for  up to 46 
doses  in Cohort A  or until one of the following criteria applies . In Cohort B, tre atment may 
continue for up to 4  doses  of combination therapy (nivolumab + ipilimumab), and up to 46 doses 
of nivolumab monotherapy after the combination therapy , or until one of the following criteria 
applies:  
 
• Disease progression, as per section 5.9  
 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
 
• Any patients who require  additional immune suppressive treatment beyond steroids 
should go off study treatment  
 
 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  which include the following (see also section  6 and 
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
28 specific algorithms  in Appendix E ): 
 
• Any grade 2 drug -related uveitis or eye pain or blurred vision that does not respond to 
topical therapy and does not improve to Grade 1 severity within the re -treatment 
period OR requires systemic treatment  
 
• Patients requiring > two dose delays for the same type of event should go off protocol 
therapy.  
 
• Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the 
judgment of the investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the subject with 
continued study drug dosing  
 
• Any dosing interruption lasting >6 weeks, with the follow ing exceptions:   
 
• Patients being tapered after high dose corticosteroids over one month followed by a 
two-week observation period will be allowed an additional two weeks to restart 
treatment ( a maximum  eight week interruption).  
 
• Dosing interruptions >6  weeks that occur for non -drug-related reasons may be 
allowed if approved by the Investigator.  Prior to re -initiating treatment in a subject 
with a dosing interruption lasting >6 weeks, the Principal Investigator must be 
consulted.  
 
• Grade 3 drug -related autoimmune or inflammatory events including uveitis, 
pneumonitis, diarrhea, colitis, neurologic adverse events, hypersensitivity reaction, or 
infusion reaction of any duration requires discontinuation except as noted below:  
 
• Any other grade 3 non -skin, dru g-related AE lasting >7 days including fatigue.  
 
• Any grade 3 or 4 drug -related laboratory abnormality or electrolyte abnormality, not 
associated with underlying organ pathology , that does not require treatment except for 
electrolyte replacements does not  require treatment discontinuation.   
 
• Grade 3 amylase or lipase abnormalities that are not associated with diabetes mellitus 
(DM), associated liver or gall bladder inflammation clinical manifestations of 
pancreatitis and which decrease to < Grade 2 within 1 week of onset may resume 
study treatment when resolved .   
 
• Any grade 4 events except as noted above . 
 
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or  
 
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for 
further treatme nt in the judgment of the investigator.  
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
29  
5.5 Duration of Follow Up  
 
Patients will be followed for 100 days based on 5 half lives  after removal from study or until 
death, whichever occurs first.  Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse event (s) 
will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.  Patients who complete all 
protocol therapy ( 46 doses), without disease progression or unacceptable  toxicity will continue to 
be followed until disease progression or the initiation of a new anticancer therapy.  
 
5.6 Criteria for Removal from Study  
 
Patients will be removed from study when any of the applicable criteria, including progressive 
disease  as per section 5.9 , adverse events, patient withdrawal or inability to follow study protocol 
as listed in Section 5.4.  The reason for study removal and the date the patient was removed must 
be documented in the Case Report Form.  
 
5.7 Criteria to Resume Treat ment  
 
Management of adverse events is summarized in section 6 and m ay include holding of 
nivolumab  and ipilimumab,  and/or the use of ster oids for the management of immune related 
AEs.  
 
If drug administration is held until the next scheduled time point, ple ase continue to count 
weeks/doses. If patients must be delayed due to toxicity , all assessments can be obtained with the 
modified treatment dose schedule as noted in this section.  
 
Some patients may continue to benefit from treatment, maintaining or improv ing responses after 
progression including those treated with steroids.  
 
Restarting nivolumab may be considered in patients who experience  grade 2 events and some 
grade 3 events (skin rash and thyroiditis). Because of this, stopping treatment and starting 
steroids earlier , as per section 6,  to obtain resolution with the possibility for restarting rather than 
waiting for higher grade events  is encouraged.  
 
For non -autoimmune or non -inflammatory events patients may resume treatment with study drug 
when the dru g-related AE(s) resolve to Grade  ≤1 or baseline value, with the following 
exceptions:  
• Evaluation to exclude any additional immune mediated events endocrine, GI, and liver / 
pancreas function as clinically indicated must be made prior to restarting.  
• Non-drug-related toxicity including hepatic, pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis, must 
have resolved to baseline before treatment is resumed.  
 
If the criteria to resume treatment are met, the patient should restart treatment no sooner than the 
next schedule d time point per protocol.  However, if the treatment is delayed past the next 
scheduled time point per protocol the treatment should resume at the earliest convenient point 
that is within the six week delay period.  
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
30  
For protocols using combination nivolu mab/ipilimumab for the initial induction period patients 
with grade 2 or 3 events requiring discontinuation of treatment with the combination, the PI may 
consider continuing treatment with single agent nivolumab at the same dose when the event 
resolves to baseline. However, patients with renal, CNS, or pulmonary toxicity must be removed 
from study.   
For patients treated with corticosteroids:  
 
For patients treated with high dose steroids with nivolumab/ipilimumab, toxicity must resolve to 
baseline within 8 weeks of treatment.  
 
Patients should be off steroids for at least 2 weeks with no recurrence or new events. New 
immune related events or exacerbation of existing events during steroid treatment or taper 
suggest the presence of ongoing immune activation and should require perma nent 
discontinuation of nivolumab.  
 
Grade 2 events must resolve to grade < 1 before considering retreatment.  
 
All patients treated with steroids for grade ≥2 events should have nivolumab held until resolution 
to  grade < 1 for at least 2 weeks following complete removal from steroid treatment except for 
maintenance replacement doses for adrenal insufficiency (preferably no greater than 10mg 
prednisone equivalent daily ).   
 
All patients treated with steroids for grade ≥3 even ts should have nivolumab discontinued.  
Patients with grade 3 thyroiditis and skin rash may continue therapy as for grade 2 events with 
resolution and stable replacement treatment.  
 
Patients with hepatitis, pancreatitis, pneumonitis, and colitis are at ris k for exacerbation with 
retreatment if there is residual inflammation and should resolve to Grade 0 or baseline before 
retreatment.  Baseline can mean the initial grade i.e. grade <1 where permitted on study.  
 
Patients with thyroiditis or hypopituitarism w ho are stable as above may be restarted with 
replacement hormones including thyroid hormone and physiologic doses only of corticosteroids.  
Please note that grading and for hypophysitis with symptoms of headache, visual or neurologic 
changes or radiologic evidence of p ituitary enlargement and other CNS events such as aseptic 
meningitis or encephalitis should be considered grade 3 events.  
 
New immune related events or exacerbation of existing events during steroid treatment or taper 
suggest the presence of ongoing immune activation and should require permanent 
discontinuation of nivolumab.  
 
A patient  who is treated with steroids, evaluated, and found to not have an autoimmune or 
inflammatory event requiring steroid treatment, may be restarted if asymptomati c off steroids for 
2 weeks and other restarting criteria are met.  
 
Prior to starting corticosteroids or hormone replacement for any reason, appropriate endocrine 
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
31 testing including cortisol, ACTH, TSH and T4 must be drawn if clinically feasible  to documen t 
baseline function and distinguish the pituitary  from  peripheral organ dysfunction and later from 
steroid (or thyroid)  treatment associated  ACTH ( or TSH)  suppression.   Steroids should be 
started prior to obtaining results based on clinical indicatio ns.  
 
5.8 Treatment of Nivolumab  or Ipilimumab Related Infusion Reaction s 
 
Since nivolumab and ipilimumab contains only human immunoglobulin protein sequences, it is 
unlikely to be immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensitivity reactions.  However, if suc h 
a reaction were to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, urticaria, 
angioedema, pruritis, arthralgias, hypo - or hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms.  
 
All Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions should be reported as an S AE if criteria are met.  Infusion 
reactions should be graded according to NCI CTCAE version  5.0 guidelines.  
 
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines as medically appropriate:  
 
For Grade 1 symptoms:   (Mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated)  
 
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms.  Infusion rate may be 
slowed.  If the infusion is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion 
rate when symptoms resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be 
increased to 100% of the original infusion rate.  Monitor patient clos ely.   
 
The following prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions:  
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) at 
least 30 minutes before additional nivolumab administrations, slowing infusi on rate as above.  
 
 
For Grade 2 symptoms :  (Moderate reaction requires therapy or infusion interruption but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [ e.g., antihistamines, non -steroidal anti -
inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators , IV fluids]; close observation for 
recurrence and treatment  medications may need to be continued for 24 -48 hours).   
 
Stop the nivolumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the subject with 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen); 
remain at bedside and monitor patient until resolution of symptoms.  Corticosteroid or 
bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate.  If the infusion is interrupted, 
then restart the infu sion at 50% of the original infusion rate when symptoms resolve; if no further 
complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of the original infusion 
rate.  Monitor patient closely.  If symptoms recur, then no further nivolumab wi ll be 
administered at that visit.  Administer diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, and remain at bedside and 
monitor the patient until resolution of symptoms.  The amount of study drug infused must be 
recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF).  The following  prophylactic premedications 
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
32 are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and 
(acetaminophen) (or paracetamol) 325 to 1000 mg should be administered at least 30 minutes 
before additional nivolumab administrations.  If necessa ry, corticosteroids (recommended dose: 
up to 25 mg of IV hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used.  
 
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms:  (Severe reaction), Grade 3 symptoms: prolonged [ i.e., not 
rapidly responsive to symptomatic medication and/or brief interr uption of infusion]; recurrence 
of symptoms following initial improvement; hospitalization indicated for other clinical sequelae 
[e.g., renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]).   
 
Grade 4 symptoms:  (life threatening; pressor or ventilatory support indica ted).  
 
Immediately discontinue infusion of nivolumab.  Begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat 
the subject as follows.  Recommend bronchodilators, epinephrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1,000 
solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution injected slowly 
for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with methylprednisolone 100 mg IV 
(or equivalent), as needed.  Patient should be monitored until the investigator is comfortable that 
the symptoms will not recur.  N ivolumab will be permanently discontinued.  Investigators should 
follow their institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis.  Remain at bedside and 
monitor patient until recovery from symptoms.  In the case of late -occurring hypersensitivity 
symptoms ( e.g., appearance of a localized or generalized pruritis within 1 week after treatment), 
symptomatic treatment may be given ( e.g., oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids).  
 
Please note that late occurring events including isolated fever and fatigue may represent the 
presentation of systemic inflammation.  Please evaluate accordingly.  
 
 
5.9 Treatment Beyond Progression  
 
 
A minority of subjects treated with immunotherapy may derive clinical benefit either delayed 
responses, stable disease, or increased ov erall survival despite initial evidence of progressive 
disease (PD) with nivolumab or combination treatment.   
 
Patients may be permitted to continue treatment beyond initial RECIST 1.1 -defined PD that 
occurs during the initial (24 weeks) of treatment as long as they meet the following criteria:  
 
• No more than 4 new lesions total sum of the longest diameter (SHORT diameter 
for LN) cannot exceed  40% of the initial sum including new lesions   
• Patients must be clinically stable with no change in performance status due to 
disease progression  
• No indication for immediate alternative treatment  
• Patient [assessed by the investigator] is showing clinical benefit and tolerates 
study drug.  The assessment of clinical benefit should take into account whether 
the subjec t is clinically stable or deteriorating and  likely or unlikely to receive 
further benefit from continued treatment.  
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
33 • The time of progression is noted from the first assessment that exceeds standard 
criteria  
 
New lesions are considered measurable at the ti me of initial progression if the longest 
diameter is at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes, which must have a 
short axis of at least 15 mm).  Any new lesion considered non -measurable at the time 
of initial progression may become measurable an d therefore included in the tumor 
burden measurement if the longest diameter increases to at least 10 mm (except for 
pathological lymph nodes, which must have an increase in short axis to at least 15 
mm).  
 
 
6 DOSING DELAYS/DOSE M ODIFICATIONS  
 
 
Dose delays  for nivolumab  and ipilimumab  for adverse events are described below. There are no 
dose reductions of nivolumab or ipilimumab allowed. See section 5.6 for guidelines regarding 
resumption of nivolumab and ipilimumab following dose delays.  
 
 
Please refer to the  Nivolumab Investigator Brochure , Ipilimumab Investigator Brochure  or 
Appendi x B to the protocol for toxicity management algorithms which include specific 
treatment guidelines .  These algorithms should be followed unless there are specific clinical 
circumstances which the treating physician indicates variations or alternative treatment is 
needed.  
 
 
Evaluation of possible AEs should occur early , with early withholding of drug, and 
appropriate treatment as indicated in the management tables and following eve nt specific 
guidelines.  In some cases, nivolumab  and ipilimumab  may be resumed as per section 5.6

See section 5. 8: Treatment of Nivolumab or Ipilimumab  Infusion reactions   
 
If treatment is delayed >8 weeks for an adverse event, the patient must be permanently 
discontinued from study therapy.  
 
Patients requiring high dose steroid  treatment for autoimmune or inflammatory events should be 
managed as described in section 5.7, except for a short course of tapering steroids for infusion 
reaction, skin rash, or endocrine events.  
  
Patients with grade 3 thyroiditis and skin rash may continue therapy as for grade 2 events with 
resolution and stable replacement treatment.  
 
Patients with thyroiditis or hypopituitarism who are stable as above may be restarted with 
replacement hormones including thyroid hormone and physiologic doses o f corticosteroids. 
Please note that grade for hypophysitis with symptoms of headache, visual, or neurologic 
changes or radiologic evidence of pituitary enlargement and other CNS events such as aseptic 
meningitis or encephalitis should be considered grade 3  events.   
 
Any patient who require s additional immune suppressive treatment beyond steroids should go off 
protocol therapy.  
 
Patients requiring > two dose delays , other than for evaluation for the same event , should go off 
protocol therapy . Patients may be dose -delayed for evaluation and restarted depending on results.  
 
Prior to starting corticosteroids or hormone replacement for any reason, appropriate endocrine 
testing including cortisol, ACTH, TSH and T4 must be obtained to document baseline.  
 
Please note that in some cases the treatment algorithms recommend steroids if symptoms do not 
resolve in 7 days. However, this recommendation is not meant to delay steroid treatment at any 
time it is clinically indicated.  
 
Any patient started on corticost eroids initially who is determined to not require steroids 
treatment for an autoimmune adverse event may resume therapy after a 2 week observation 
period without further symptoms at the discretion of the PI or investigator.

The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of 
reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform 
presentation of events by body system. In addition to the comprehensive list,  a subset , the 
Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and 
is identified with  bold and italicized  text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are 
protocol specific exceptions to expedited repo rting to NCI (except as noted below).  Refer to the 
'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelop ment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf  for

2Ipilimumab can result in severe and fatal immune -mediated adverse events probably due to T -
cell activation and  proliferation.  These can include (but are not limited to) autoimmune 
hemolytic anemia, acquired anti -factor VIII immune response, autoimmune aseptic meningitis, 
autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune thyroiditis, hepatic failure, pure red cell aplasia, pancrea titis, 
ulcerative and hemorrhagic colitis, endocrine disorders (e.g., autoimmune thyroiditis, 
hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, autoimmune hypophysitis/hypopituitarism, and adrenal 
insufficiency), ocular manifestations (e.g., uveitis, iritis, conjunctivitis , blepharitis, and 
episcleritis), sarcoid granuloma, myasthenia gravis, polymyositis, and Guillain -Barre syndrome.  
The majority of these reactions manifested early during treatment; however, a minority occurred 
weeks to months after discontinuation of ipi limumab especially with the initiation of additional

SPEER column, Section 7.1.1)  should be reported through CTEP -AERS only if the 
grade is above the grade provided in the SPEER . 
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
52 - Other AEs for the protocol  that do not require expedited reporting are outlined in 
section 7.3.4.  
 
• Attribution  of the AE:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the s tudy treatment.  
 
7.3 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting  
 
7.3.2 Expedited AE reporting for this study must use CTEP -AERS  (CTEP Adverse 
Event Reporting System), accessed via the CTEP Web site  (https://eapps -
ctep.n ci.nih.gov/ctepaers ).  The reporting procedures to be followed are 
presented in the “ NCI G uidelines  for Investigators:  Adverse  Event Reporting  
Requirements  for DCTD (CTEP and CIP) and DCP INDs and IDEs ” which 
can be downloaded from the CTEP Web site  
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_
events.htm ).  These requirements are briefly outlined in the table s below 
(Sectio n 7.3.3).  
 
In the rare occurrence when Internet connectivity is lost, a 24-hour notification is to be 
made to CT EP by telephone at 301 -897-7497 .  Once Internet connectivity is restored, the 
24-hour notification phoned in must be entered electronically into CTEP -AERS  by the 
original submitter at the site.  
 
7.3.3 CTEP -AERS  is programmed for automatic electronic distribution of reports to the 
following individuals:  Principal Investigator and Adverse  Event Coordinator (s) (if 
applicable) of the Corresponding  Organization, the local treating physician, and the 
Reporter and Submitter .  CTEP -AERS  provides a copy feature for other e -mail recipients.  
 
The Coordinating Center of the Corresponding  Organizati on is responsible for submitting 
to the CTSU documentation of AEs that they deem reportable for posting on the CTSU 
protocol web page and inclusion on the CTSU bi -monthly broadcast.  
 
7.3.4 Expedited Reporting Guidelines  
 
Use the NCI protocol number and the proto col-specific patient ID assigned during trial 
registration on all reports.  
 
Note:  A death on study requires both  routine and expedited reporting regardless of 
causality, unless as noted below.  Attribution to treatment or other cause must be 
provided.  
 
Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Neoplasms benign, 
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
53 malignant and unspecified (incl uding  cysts and polyps) - Other (Progressive 
Disease)”  under the system organ class (SOC) of the same name.  Evidence that the death 
was a mani festation of underlying disease ( e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor 
growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should be 
submitted.

that Occur on Studies under an IND/IDE within 30 Days of the Last Administration of the 
Investigational Agent/Intervention1, 2 
FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not 
they are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization for ≥ 24 
hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of  the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered serious when, based upon medical judgment, the y may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
 
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST  be immediately reported to the NCI via  electronic 
submission wi thin the timeframes detailed in the table below.

NOTE:   Protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting of serious adverse events are found in the Specific 
Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER) portion of the CAEPR  
Expedited AE reporting timelines are defined as:  
o “24-Hour; 5 Calendar Days” - The AE must initiall y be submitted electronically within 24 h ours of learning 
of the AE, followed by a complete expedited report within 5 calendar days of the initial 24 -hour report.  
o “10 Calendar Days” - A complete expedited report on the AE must be submit ted electronically within 10 
calendar days of learning of the AE.  
1Serious adverse events that occur more than 30 days after the last administration of investigational 
agent/intervention and have an attribution of possible, probable, or definite require reporting as follows:  
Expedited 24 -hour notification followed by com plete report within 5 calendar days for:  
• All Grade 4, and Grade 5 AEs  
Expedited 10 calendar day reports for:  
• Grade 2 adverse events resulting in hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
• Grade 3 adverse events  
2For studies using PET or SPECT IND agents, the AE reporting period is limited to 10 radioactive half -lives, 
rounded UP to the nearest whole day, after the agent/intervention was last administered.  Footnote “1” above 
applies after this reporting period.  
Effective Date:  May 5, 2011

7.4 Routine Adverse Event Reporting  
 
All Adverse Events must  be reported in routine study data submissions.  AEs reported 
expeditiously through CTEP -AERS  must also be reported in routine study data 
submissions.  
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are 
done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in 
future studies using similar agents.  AEs are reported in  a routine manner at scheduled times 
during the trial using Medidata Rave.  For this trial the Adverse Event CRF  is used for  routine 
AE reporting in Rave.  
 
7.5 Secondary Malignancy  
 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous malignan cy (e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a meta stasis of the initial neoplasm.  
 
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent u nder an 
NCI IND/IDE be reported  expeditiously  via CTEP -AERS .  Three options are available to 
describe the event:  
 
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy ( e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia 
[AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
• Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be 
reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 
 
 
7.6 Second Malignancy  
 
A second malignancy is one unrel ated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a 
metastasis from the initial malignancy).   Second malignancies require ONLY routine AE 
reporting unless otherwise specified .

8.1.1 Nivolumab  
Amino Acid Sequence:   4 polypeptide chains, which include 2 identical heavy chains with 440 
amino acids and 2 identical light chains.  
 
Other Names:   BMS -936558, MDX1106  
 
Classification:   Anti-PD-1MAb  
 
M.W.:   146,221 daltons  
 
Mode of Action :  Nivolumab targets the programmed d eath–1 (PD -1, cluster of differentiation 
279 [CD279]) cell surface membrane receptor.  PD -1 is a negative regulatory receptor expressed 
by activated T and B lymphocytes.  Binding of PD -1 to its ligands, programmed death –ligand 1 
(PD-L1) and 2 (PD -L2), resu lts in the down -regulation of lymphocyte activation.  Nivolumab 
inhibits the binding of PD -1 to PD -L1 and PD -L2.  Inhibition of the interaction between PD -1 
and its ligands promotes immune responses and antigen -specific T -cell responses to both foreign 
antigens as well as self -antigens.  
 
Description :  Nivolumab Injection is a clear to opalescent, colorless to pale yellow liquid; light 
(few) particulates may be present.  The drug product is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, single -use, 
isotonic aqueous solution formulated in sodium citrate, sodium chloride, mannitol, 
diethylenetriamine pentacetic acid (pentetic acid) and polysorbate 80 (Tween® 80), pH 6.0.  
 
How Supplied:   Nivolumab is supplied by Bristol -Myers Squibb and distributed by the 
Pharmaceutical Manageme nt Branch, CTEP/DCTD/NCI as 100 mg vials (10 mg/mL) with a 0.7 
mL overfill.  It is supplied in 10 mL type I flint glass vials, with butyl rubber stoppers and 
aluminum seals.  
 
Preparation:   Nivolumab injection can be infused undiluted (10 mg/mL) or diluted with 0.9% 
Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose, USP to concentrations no less than 0.35 
mg/mL.  
 
Storage:   Vials of Nivolumab injection must be stored at 2° -8°C (36° -46°F) and protected from 
light, freezing, and shaking.  
 
Stability:   Shelf -life su rveillance of the intact vials is ongoing.  
 
The administration of undiluted and diluted solutions of Nivolumab must be completed within 24 
hours of preparation.  If not used immediately, the infusion solution may be stored up to 24 hours 
in a refrigerator at 2°-8°C (36° -46°F) and a maximum of 4 hours of the total 24 hours can be at 
room temperature (20° -25°C, 68° -77°F) and room light.  The maximum 4 -hour period under 
room temperature and room light conditions includes the product administration period.  
 
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
56 CAU TION:   The single -use dosage form contains no antibacterial preservative or bacteriostatic 
agent.  Therefore, it is advised that the product be discarded 8 hours after initial entry.  
 
Route of Administration:   Intravenous infusion.  Do not administer as a n IV push or bolus 
injection.   
 
Method of Administration:   Administer  through a 0.2 micron to 1.2 micron pore size, low -
protein binding polyethersulfone membrane in -line filter.  
 
Potential Drug Interactions:   No incompatibilities between Nivolumab injecti on and polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC), non -PVC/non -DEHP (di[2 -ethylhexyl]phthalate) IV components, or glass

Nivolumab is an investigational agent supplied to investigators by the Division of Cancer 
Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), NCI.  
 
Nivolumab is provided to the NCI under a Collaborative Agreement between the Pharmaceutical 
Collaborator and the DCTD, NCI (see Section 12.3).  
 
8.1.2 Ipilimumab (NSC 732442 ) 
 
Chemical Name or Amino Acid Sequence: 4 polypeptide chains, 2 i dentical heavy chains with 447 
amino acids and 2 identical light chains consisting of 215 amino acids.  
 
Other Names: Anti-CTLA -4 monoclonal antibody, MDX -010, Yervoy™  
 
Classification:  Human monoclonal antibody  
 
M.W .: 147,991 Daltons  
 
Mode of Action: Ipilim umab is specific for the CTLA4 antigen expressed on a subset of activated 
T-cells. CTLA4 interaction with the B7 molecule, one of its ligands expressed on professional 
antigen presenting cells, can down -regulate T -cell response. Ipilimumab is, thought to a ct by 
blocking the interaction of CTLA4 with the B7 ligand, resulting in a blockade of the inhibitory 
effect of T -cell activation.   The CTLA4/B7 creates the interaction.  
 
Description: Ipilimumab is a fully human immunoglobulin (IgG 1) with two manufacturing 
processes – ongoing trials have been using substances manufactured using Process B.   New clinical 
trials will be using ipilimumab that is manufactured by Process C. The Process C has been 
developed using a higher producing sub -clone of the current Master Cell Bank, and modified cell 
culture and purification steps.  
  
How Supplied: Bristol -Myers -Squibb (BMS) supplies Ipilimumab to the DCTD/NCI.   Ipilimumab

8.1.3 Agent Orderin g and Agent Accountability  
 
8.1.3.1  NCI-supplied agents may be requested by the Principal Investigator (or their authorized 
designee) at each participating institution.   Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) 
policy requires that agent be shipped directly to the i nstitution wher e the patient is to be 
treated.   PMB does not permit the transfer of agents between institutions (unless prior 
approval from PMB is obtained).   The CTEP -assigned protocol number mus t be used for 
ordering all CTEP -supplied investigational age nts.  The responsible investigator at each 
participating institution must be registered with CTEP, DCTD through an annual 
submission of FDA Form 1572 (Statement of Investigator), Curriculum Vitae, 
Supplemental Investigator Data Form (IDF), and F inancial Di sclosure Form (FDF).   If 
there are several participating investigators at one institution, CTEP -supplied 
investigational agents for the study should be ordered under the name of one lead 
investigator at that institution.  
 
In general, sites may order initial agent supplies when a subject is being screened for 
enrollment onto the study.  
 
Active CTEP -registered investigators and investigator -designated shipping designees and 
ordering designees can submit agent requests through the PMB Online Agent Order 
Processing (OA OP) application ( https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/OAOP/pages/login.jspx ).  
Access to OAOP requires the establishment of a CTEP Identity and A ccess Management 
(IAM) account  (https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/iam/ ) and the maintenance of an “active” 
account s tatus and a “current” password.   For questions about drug orders, transfers, 
returns, or accountability, call (240 ) 276-6575  Monday through Friday between 8:30 am 
and 4:30 pm (ET) or email PMBAfterHours@mail.nih.gov  anytime.  
 
8.1.3.2  Agent Inv entory Records – The investigator, or a responsible party designated by the 
investigator, must m aintain a careful record of the inventory and disposition of all agents 
received from DCTD using the NCI Drug Acco untability Record Form (DARF).  (See 
the NCI Investigator’s Handbook for Procedures for Drug Accountability and Storage.)

9 BIOMARKE R, CORRELATIVE , AND SPECIAL STUDIES  
 
 
9.1 Integrated Laboratory or Imaging Studies  
 
 
9.1.1 Immunohistochemical Staining for PDL1 (CD274), PDL2 (CD273) and PD1 (CD279)  
 
We hypothesize that CD274, CD273 and CD279 protein expression in tumor tissues might be 
associated with favorable clinical response  to immune checkpoint inhibition , and might serve  as 
biomarkers for patient selection for CD279 blockade in clinical treatment.  PDL1 assessment by 
BMS DAKO kit will be considered an integrated biomarker for this study because PDL1 
assessment by this method has been used across multiple studies evaluating nivolumab and 
therefore will support standardization, reproducibility, and comparison across studies . Additional 
staining for PDL1 by the antibody method noted be low will occur in parallel for exploratory 
comparison of these two techniques.  
 
9.1.1.1  Collection of Specimen(s)  
 
Assay, patient and specimen information  
Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of CD274 will be used as an integrated biomarker in this  
clinical trial, and to identify a group of patients most likely to respon d to the immune checkpoint 
inhibition with nivolumab  or nivolumab and ipilimumab . This information  may be used in the 
future phase II trials as a stratification variable . IHC staining of CD273, CD27 9 will also be 
performed as exploratory biomarkers  to explore a possible relationship between expression and 
response to nivolumab  or nivoluamb  and ipilimumab in this population . Pre-treatment archival 
tumor material will be collected for all eligible pati ents. In addition, because expression of these 
markers may change over time, paired immediate pre -treatment and post - treatment biopsies will 
be obtained  in all patients enrolled to Cohort B . In Cohort A, pre -treatment archival tumor material 
was collected  for ten out of the twelve patients treated. In Cohort A, paired biopsies were not 
required for all participants; one set of paired biopsies was  conducted . These paired biopsies  will 
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
60 be collected and fixed by 10% neutral buffered formalin overnight, dehydr ated and paraffin 
embedded.  Four -micrometer -thick sections will be cut.  The paraffin blocks and unstained slides 
will be stored at room temperature.  All IHC staining will be performed in the Center for Immuno -
Oncology Pathology Core at Dana -Farber/Harva rd Cancer Center Specialized Histopathology 
Core, which will be a central research laboratory for this multiple -center clinical trial.  Unstained 
slides from other two centers will be shipped to Dr Xiaoyun Liao, Thorn building 603B, Brigham 
and Women Hospi tal, 75 Francis Street, Boston, MA, 02215.  
 
Primary antibody characteristics  
Mouse monoclonal anti -CD279, anti -CD274 and anti -CD273 antibodies were generated in the 
laboratory of Dr. Gordon Freeman (Dana -Farber Cancer Institute).  The antibodies are human gene 
product and can recognize all isoforms.  The specificity of these antibodies was confirmed by 
western blotting in human cancer cell lines and bands were at expected mass.  The IHC staining 
was abolished in knock -down cancer cells.  CD279 is expressed on the surface of activated T cells.  
CD274 is present in macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, B cells and in multiple cancers (Sznol 
M, 2013).  CD273 is expressed on dendritic cells, macrophages and bone marrow -derived mast 
cells whereas its expression on cancers is under exploration (Rozali EN, 2012).   No cross -reactive 
proteins that may confound interpretation of IHC staining were identified.  The antigens are stable 
when the period between tissue sectioning and staining is more than 30 days.  
 
Design of immunohistochemical assay  
The IHC assay for CD274, CD273 is semi -quantitative while CD279 stained slides will be scanned 
by an automated scanning microscope and quantitatively analyzed by Aperio image analysis 
system  (Leica Biosystems) after they are ev aluated and positive cells are manually counted by a 
pathologist.   
Standard EnVision two -step (indirect) staining method will be utilized.  Four -micrometer -thick 
sections will be cut, deparaffinized, rehydrated and subjected to heat mediated antigen retri eval in 
citrate buffer (pH 6) (Invitrogen) by steaming for 30 minutes.  After cooling, tissue sections will 
be incubated with peroxidase block (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) for five minutes, then serum free 
protein block (DAKO) for 20 minutes.  Slides will be in cubated at room temperature for one hour 
with a primary antibody.  Antibodies will be diluted in Da Vinci Green Diluent (Biocare Medical, 
Concord, CA).  EnvisionTM anti-mouse HRP -labeled polymer (DAKO) will be applied to the 
sections for 30 minutes, follow ed by visualization by using the chromogen 3, 3 -diaminobenzidine 
(DAKO). All the sections will then be counterstained with haematoxylin, dehydrated, mounted 
and coverslipped.   Positive and negative controls shall be included in each staining.  Known 
posit ive stained Hodgkin lymphoma ( CD274), tonsil (CD279 ) and melanoma (CD273) slides will 
be used as external control (separate slides).  Stained slides will be stored at room temperature.  
In our pilot study, immunoreactivity for CD274 was detected in the cyto plasm and cell membrane 
while CD273 and CD279 expression was observed in the cytoplasm.  Scoring for CD274, CD273 
will be semi -quantitative/ordered categorical.  The percentage of the tumor cells staining positive 
for CD274, CD273 and the intensity of the tumor cells will be recorded as 0 (no staining), 1 (weak 
staining), 2 (moderate staining) and 3 (intense staining).   Absolute CD279 positive cells will be 
counted under microscope lens x 20 power field.  Representative 5 areas will be chosen to count.  
The average number from 5 areas will be recorded and be compared with data from image analysis.

CD279
CD274 CD273 
Assay performance  
The results will be obtained on retrospective data sets.  Protocols of these three antibodies have 
been optimized, standardized to minimize staining variance.  Positive control and negative controls 
were used and stained separately with each batch of slides. The IHC s taining of three markers 
(CD274, CD273 and CD279) has been performed in two different labs by three different 
technicians on whole tissue sections of Hodgkin lymphomas, melanomas, lung cancers and renal 
cell carcinomas. Three readers were involved, confirm ing the good reproducibility of the assay.  
Tumor will be considered positive if >5% (CD274) (Topalian S , 2012) or 10% (CD273 ) of the 
tumor cell population demonstrates unequivocally staining, respectively.  CD279 positivity was 
defined as >3% positive cell s/HPF (Bachireddy P, 2013).  Statistically, Fisher’s  Exact Test  will be 
used to measure the association betwee n CD274, CD273, CD27  expression and objective response Figure shows the

62 of patients.  All p values will be two sided, and statistical significance will be set at p<0.05.  
All IHC stained slides will be evaluated and scored by a pathologist (Dr Xiaoyun Liao). A subset 
of slides will be reviewed by a second pathologist (Dr Scott Rodig) to ensure concordance of 
interpretation.  
For CD279 staining, slides will be scanned by an automated scanning microscope and analyzed 
by Aperio image analysis system  (Leica Biosystems). Tumor areas will be marked by a pathologist 
to exclude non -neoplastic areas, such as stroma, normal epithelial and necrotic regions.  The 
software will be used to count the number of positive cells in each tissue.  The percentage of 
CD279 positive cells will be calculated.  Data will be compared with that of manual counting by 
a pathologist to exclude tissue artifacts that cannot be recognized by computer im age software.

9.2 Exploratory/Ancillary Correlative Studies  
 
9.2.1 Monitoring Peripheral Blood for Changes in  Immune Function  
 
Subpopulations of PBMCs will be isolated, inc luding but not limited to dendrit ic cells, T cells, and 
B cells.  Phenotype changes in these cell populations by flow cytometry will be determined as a 
function of treatment .  These include regulatory and effector immune panels, naïve and memory 
CD4, CD8 and NK lymphocyte populations.  Both humoral and cellular immune responses will 
be investigated by ELISAs, ELISPOTs, and cytotoxic T cell chromium release assays.   
 
IHC staining of PDL2 (CD273) and PD1 (CD279) will be performed as exploratory assays as 
noted above in section 9.1.  
 
 
9.2.1.2  Handling of Specimens(s)  
Peripheral blood:  
In Cohort A, s erial blood/serum samples was  collected every 2 weeks prior to each nivolumab  
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
63 administration starting on day 1  (pre-treatment) , through week 12, and then with decreased 
frequency  as per section 10 .  In Cohort B, serial blood/serum samples will be collected at week 1 
of each cycle prior to study drug infusion starting on day 1 (pre -treatment), through cycle  4. A 
panel of cytokines and chemokines will be tested in serum using Luminex cytokine assay. Changes 
in cytokine production in immune cell subsets as a function of treatment  will be determined by 
ELISA and intracellular cytokine staining. Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) will be monitored . 
 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be collected  from whole blood to assess immune 
cell populations. Surface staining with a panel of antibodies (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25, FoxP3, 
CD11c, CD83, CD86, CD56) and intracytoplasmatic cytokine staining, followed by flow 
cytometry will be performed in order to identi fy different T cell populations, their activation status, 
and the production of different cytokines as well as other immune cell population s as described 
below .  
 
Serum marker levels will be summarized descriptively and graphically for the patient population.  
The time course of expression levels will also be summarized graphically by patient, noting times 
of disease  response and disease  progression .    
 
9.2.1.3  Sites  Perfo rming Correlative Study  
The Center for Immuno -oncology Immune Assessment core facilitates the collection, processing, 
and trafficking of patient blood samples on CIO clinical trials.  The Immune Assessment Core has 
standardized multi -color flow assays for phenotying immune cells as well as standardized ELISA 
and Luminex platform analyses. Studies will be performed in the Center for Immuno -oncology

9.2.2 Targeted gene -expression profiling.  
 

NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
64 As an exploratory end -point, targeted gene expression profiling will be performed on biopsy 
samples , when sufficient material is available,  to determine the relative expression of a 
comprehensive set of gene products (161) involved in all aspects of immuno -regulation.  The 
Nanostring nCounter platform will be used for this analysis as it has proven effective for targeted 
gene expression profiling using RNA isolated from formalin -fixed, paraffin embedded tissues 
(Scott DW et al., 2014, PMID:24398326).  The n Counter platform is located at the Center for 
Advanced Molecular Diagnostics (CAMD), a CLIA -certified laboratory in the Department of 
Pathology at BWH.  Dr. Rodig's laboratory has extensive experience with the operation of the 
analytical platform and the a nalysis of the resulting data (Carey CD et al., J. Mol. Diagn., 2014, in 
press ). 
RNA will be isolated from 3 X 10um sections of formalin -fixed, paraffin embedded material. The 
resulting RNA will be quantified using a bioanalyzer and 250ng used for targeted  gene expression 
analysis following manufacturer's protocols.  The resulting data will be interrogated to establish 
whether a limited and defined gene -expression signature is predictive of clinical responses to 
therapy.

69 11 MEASUREMENT OF EFFEC T 
 
 
11.1 Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response every 8 weeks  (+/- 2 
days) .  In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained at least 4  weeks 
following initial documentation of objective response.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline 
(version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228 -247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph 
nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
All patients who receive at least one dose of nivolumab  and ipilimumab each  will be included in 
the toxicity analysis. This includes participa nts who receive study drug and are ultimately 
deemed ineligible.  
 
11.1.1  Definitions  
 
Evaluable for toxicity .  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their 
first treatment with nivolumab  and ipilimumab . 
 
Evaluable for objective response.   Only those patients who have measurable disease 
present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease 
re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response.  These patients will hav e their 
response classified according to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit 
objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered 
evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response .  Patients who have le sions present at baseline 
that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at 
least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered 
evaluable for non -target disease.  The response asse ssment is based on the presence, 
absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
11.1.2  Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease .  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be record ed) as ≥20 mm (≥2 c m) 
by chest x -ray or as ≥10 mm  (≥1 c m) with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam.  
All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previousl y irradiated area will not be 
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
70 considered measurable, unless there is clear evidence of progression of the lesion since 
completion of radiation and prior to enrollment on study.    
 
Malignant lymph nodes.   To be considered pathologically enlarged and measura ble, a 
lymph node must be ≥15 mm  (≥1.5 c m) in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan 
slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm  [0.5 cm] ).  At baseline and in 
follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  
 
Non-measurable d isease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm  [<1 cm]  or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm  [≥1 
to <1 .5 cm] short axis), are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal dise ase, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by 
CT or MRI), are considered as non -measurable.  
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) 
since they are, by definition, simple cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if the y meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -
cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and  5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative o f all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself 
to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next lar gest lesion which can be 
measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -
nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes a re to be included in the sum, 
then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used 
as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable 
dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but 
the pre sence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow -up.  
 
11.1.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
71 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline  evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified an d reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
 
Clinical lesions  Clinical lesions wil l only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm  (≥1 cm)  diameter 
as assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation 
by color photography, including  a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is 
recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm  (0.5 cm)  or less.  If CT 
scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm  (0.5 cm) , the minimum size for a 
measurable lesion should be twice the s lice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain 
situations ( e.g. for body scans).   
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the 
technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for th e 
evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at 
follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST 
guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body  scans 
should be performed with breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
 
PET-CT  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET-CT is of identic al diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over 
time.  Note, howeve r, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which 
may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
72  
Ultrasound   Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement .  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their 
entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it 
cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one 
assessment to the nex t.  If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the 
study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised.  If there is concern about radiation 
exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy   The utiliza tion of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete respo nse (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 
Tumor markers   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered 
in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published 
[JNCI  96:487 -488, 2004; J Clin Oncol  17, 3461 -3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  26:1148 -1159, 
2008].  In addition, the Gy necologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -125 
progression criteria which are to be integrated with objective tumor assessment for use in 
first-line trials in ovarian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534 -1535, 2000].  
 
Cytology, Histology   These techniques can be used to  differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin  of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and pro gressive disease.  
 
FDG -PET  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New l esions on the basis 
of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follo w-up:  If the positive FDG -
PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD.  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow -up CT  scans are needed to determine if t here is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal 
FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing 
site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis o f the anatomic images, this 
is not PD.  
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
73 c. FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy 
in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or 
scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be prospectively 
described in the protocol and supported by disease -specific medical literature for the 
indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false 
positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and b iopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
 
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
11.1.4  Response Criteria : RECIST version 1.1 . 
 
 
11.1.4.1  Evaluation  of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm (<1 cm) . 
 
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline  sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm  (0.5 cm) .  
(Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  
 
Stable  Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
 
11.1.4.2  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm  
[<1 cm]  short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
74 should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall 
disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions o nly is exceptional, the opinion 
of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal 
Investigator).  
 
11.1.4.3  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 
The best o verall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best 
response as signment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.

Note :  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at th at time should be 
reported as “ symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to document the 
objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

 ‘Non -CR/non -PD’ is preferred over ‘stable disease’ for non -target disease since SD is 
increasingly used as an endpoint for assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this 
category when no lesions can be measured is not advised  
 
11.1.5  Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement  criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first 
date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatme nt 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
11.1.6  Progression -Free Survival  
 
Progression -Free Survival will be evaluated as a secondary objective .  PFS is defined as 
the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever 
occurs first.  
 
11.1.7  Response Review  
 
At study completion, all objective responses (RECIST PR or CR) will be reviewed by the 
tumor imaging metrics core  (TIMC) at the Dana -Farber Harvard Cancer Center. Patient 
files will be availble to the readers for concurrent review.

12.1.2  Responsibility for Data Submission  
 
 
For ETCTN trials, i t is the responsibility of the PI(s) at the site to ensure that all 
investigators at the ETCTN Sites understand the procedures for data submission for each 
ETCTN protocol and that protocol specified data are submitted accurately and in a timely 
manner to t he CTMS via the electronic data capture system, Medidata Rave.   
 
Data are to be submitted via Medidata Rave to CTMS on a real -time basis, but no less 
than once every 2 weeks.   The timeliness of data submissions and timeliness in resolving 
data queries wil l be tracked by CTMS.  Metrics for timeliness will be followed and 
assessed on a quarterly basis.  For the purpose of Institutional Performance Monitoring, 
data will be considered delinquent if it is greater than 4 weeks past due.  
 
Data from Medidata Rave and CTEP -AERS  is reviewed by the CTMS on an ongoing 
basis as data is received.  Queries will be issued by CTMS directly within Rave.  The 
queries will appear on the Task Summary Tab within Rave for the CRA at the ETCTN to 
resolve.   Monthly web -based report s are posted for review by the Drug Monitors in the 
IDB, CTEP.  Onsite audits will be conducted by the CTMS to ensure compliance with 
regulatory requirements, GCP, and NCI policies and procedures with the overarching 
goal of ensuring the integrity of data generated from NCI -sponsored clinical trials , as 
described in the ETCTN Program Guidelines, which may be found on the CTEP 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protoco lDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_events.htm

will util ize a core set of eCRFs that are Cancer Data Standards Registry and Repository  
(caDSR) compliant  (http://cbiit.nci.nih.gov/nci p/biomedical -informatics -
resources/interoperability -and-semantics/metadata -and-models ).  Customized eCRFs will 
be included when appropriate to meet unique study requirements.  The PI is encouraged 
to review the eCRFs , working closely with CTMS to ensure pr ospectively that all 
required items are appropriate ly captured in the eCRFs prior to study activation.  CTMS 
will prepare the eCRFs with built -in edit checks to the extent possible to promote data 
integrity.  
 
CDUS data submissions for ETCTN trials activated after March 1, 2014, will be carried 
out by the CTMS contractor, Theradex.  CDUS submissions are performed by Theradex 
on a monthly basis.  The trial’s lead institution is responsible for timely submission to 
CTMS via Rave, as above.

13 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
 
 
 
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
COHORT  A -  Study Design and Endpoints  
This is a phase II two -stage clinical trial with a primary endpoint of objective response per  
RECISTS 1.1 among patients with advanced ULMS treated with nivolumab.  
For the primary endpoint of overall response with a null hy pothesis of 5% and an alternative  
hypothesis of 20% we would need 37 patients in a two -stage design with 12 patients in the first  
stage and 25 patients in the second stage. At the first stage analysis we will assess overall  
response, we will need to observe at least 1 response out of 12 patients to continue through the  
second stage. At the second stage we will assess overall response rate again, and we will need to  
observe at least 4 responses out of 37 patients to accept the treatment. The overall po wer for  
overall response rate is 90%. The overall type I error, the chance of incorrectly rejecting the null  
hypothesis is 9%. The probability of stopping at the first stage under the null hypothesis is 54%.  
The operating characteristics of this design are  calculated using the exact binomial distribution.  
Subjects who continue treatment beyond initial investigator -assessed, RECIST 1.1 -definedthe 
initial progression event but may be designated as delayed responses for purposes of  determining 
ORR and counted as responses for two stage designs.  
Paired immediate pre -treatment and post - treatment biopsies will be obtained whenever  
possible in consenting patients, and in a minimum of 10 patients. If less than 10 patients have  
provided paired tumor biopsies, the re maining slots will give priority to obtain biopsies in the  
last group of 10 patients prior to completion of accrual.  For the primary endpoint of overall 
response rate with the parameters as noted in section 13.1, a  total sample size of 37 patients is 
neede d in a two -stage design with 12 patients in the first stage  and 25 patients in the second 
stage. A minimum accrual rate is expected to be 3 subjects per  month. With a minimal accrual 
rate of 3 subjects per month, we expect the study enrollment tolast appro ximately 13 months.  
 
For Cohort A, 12 participants were accrued to the first stage. Since an objective response was not 
seen in the first stage of Cohort A, enrollment to the second stage did not begin.

81 nivolumab  and ipilimumab  with a primary  endpoint of objective response per RECISTS 1.1 
among  
 
For the primary endpoint of overall response with a null hypothesis of 5% and an alternative 
hypothesis of 30% we would need 25 patients in a two -stage design with 8 patients in the first 
stage and 17 patients in the second stage.  At the first stage analy sis we will assess overall 
response, we will need to observe at least 1 response out of 8 patients to continue through the 
second stage.  At the second stage , we will assess overall response rate again, and we will need 
to observe at least 3 responses out of 25 patients to accept the treatment.  The overall power for 
overall response rate is 94%.  The overall type I error, the chance of incorrectly rejecting the null 
hypothesis is 9%.  The probability of stopping at the first stage under the null hypothesis  is 66%.  
The operating characteristics of this design are calculated using the exact binomial distribution.  
 Subjects who continue treatment beyond initial investigator -assessed, RECIST 1.1 -defined 
progression will be considered to have investigator -asses sed progressive disease at the time of 
the initial progression event but may be designated as delayed responses for purposes of 
determining ORR and counted as responses for two stage designs.  
 In order to assess the impact of immune checkpoint inhibition i n this population, tissue will 
be acquired to analyze the integrated biomarkers and determine the potential drug effect in this 
disease. Biomarkers will be assessed from pre -treatment and post -treatment biopsies collected in 
a minimum of 10 patients on thi s study. During enrollment to Cohort A, one set of pre -treatment 
and post -treatment biopsies was collected; the additional 9 were not performed because the study 
did not progress to Stage II. In Cohort B, p aired immediate pre -treatment and post - treatment 
biopsies will be collected in the firs t eight participants who enroll to the study  (stage 1 -Cohort 
B). For this cohort, partici pants are required to  have disease that can be biopsied safely, as 
discussed in Section 3.1.11 . Biopsies will be optional among p articipants enrolled in the second 
stage of cohort B.   
 
13.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
For the primary endpoint of overall response rate with the parameters as noted in section 13.1, a 
total sample size of 37 patients is needed in a two -stage design with 12 patients in the first stage 
and 25 patients in the second stage  for Cohort A . For Cohort B, a total sample size of 25 patients 
is needed in a two -stage design with 8 patients in the first stage and 17 patients in the second 
stage. A minimum accrual rate is  expected to be 3 subjects per month.  With a minimal accrual 
rate of 3 subjects per month, we expect the study enrollment to last approximately 9 months.

13.3 Stratification Factors  
 
There are no planned stratification factors in this study.  
 
13.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
 
COHORT A – SECONDARY ENDPOINTS  
We will also assess toxicity in patients with ULMS treated with nivolumab.  Among the 
first phase of 12 patients, there is at least 58% probability of observing one or more rare 
(7% true probability) events, and 83% probability of observing toxicities that have a true 
occurre nce of at least 15%.  Among the total cohort of 37 patients, there is at least 85% 
probability of observing one or more rare (5% true probability) events, and 95% 
probability of observing toxicities that have a true occurrence of at least 8%.  With 37 
treated patients, the maximum width of a 90% two -sided exact binomial confidence 
interval for any estimated adverse event proportion will be no wider than ± 14%.  
 
Rate of Progression -free survival at 12 weeks with a null hypothesis of 20% and an 
alternative hy pothesis of 40% at 12 weeks will be investigated.  Patients lost to follow -
up or deaths within 12 weeks will be counted as failures.  The overall power for overall 
progression -free rate at 12 weeks is 87%, using the exact binomial distribution.  The 
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
84 operat ing characteristics of this design are calculated using a one -sided exact test with 
10% type I error.  
 
COHORT B – SECONDARY ENDPOINTS  
 
 
Toxicity: Among the first phase of 8 patients, there is at least 5 7% probability of observing one 
or more rare ( 10% true  probability) events, and 73% probability of observing one or more 
toxicities that have a true occurrence rate  as low as 15%.  Among the total cohort of 25 patients, 
there is at least 8 4% probability of observing one or more rare ( 7% true probability) even ts, and 
93% probability of observing toxicities that have a true occurrence of at least 10%.  With 25 
treated patients, the maximum width of a 90% two -sided exact binomial confidence interval for 
any estimated adverse event proportion will be no wider than  ± 18%. 
 
Rate of Progression -free survival at 6 months with a null hypothesis of 18% and an alternative 
hypothesis of 40% at 6 months will be investigated.  Patients lost to follow -up or deaths within 6 
months will be counted as failures.  The overall powe r for overall progression -free rate at 6 
months is 85%, using the exact binomial distribution.  The operating characteristics of this 
design are calculated using a one -sided exact test with 10% type I error.  
 
In addition, we will explore the relationship b etween integrated biomarker s PDL1 /PD1/PD2  
status (PDL1 status, PDL1 in infiltrating lymphocytes, PD2 status in archival tumor) and 
response to  combination treatment of  nivolumab  and ipilimumab .  We will use Fisher’s Exact 
Test to assess the relationship between each biomarker  and response to  combination treatment of  
nivolumab  and ipilimumab . Each is expected to have similar characteristics. For example, w ith 
this design, assuming tissue is avai lable on 90% of the sample, the probability of concluding 
combination treatment of nivolumab and ipilimumab response is related to the exploratory 
biomarker is 80%; given the unknown true response is 55% and 4% in positive marker versus 
negative marker pat ients, respectively, assuming 33% of the population is over -expressed for 
PDL1.  The power to detect the relationship of interest increases as the prevalence of the 
biomarker increases. The operating characteristics of this design are calculated using a tw o-sided 
exact test with 10% type I error.  
 
13.5 Analysis of Exploratory Objectives  
COHORT A AND B  
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
85 • Explore the relationship between tumor CSF1 gene signature by RNA analysis and 
response to combination treatment of nivolumab and ipilimumab.  
 
• Explore the relationship of potential biomarkers associated with disease control of 
ULMS treated with combination treatment of nivolumab and ipilimumab by 
evaluating biomarkers within the tumor microenvironment and the periphery.  
 
We will use non -parametri c tests to assess the relationships lis ted above and response to 
combination treatment of nivolumab and ipilim umab. Logistic regression will be used for 
response measured outcomes. Outcome relationships will be largely explorative and 
descriptive.  
 
13.6 Report ing and Exclusions  
 
13.6.1  Evaluation of Toxicity  
 
All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment with  
nivolumab  and ipilimumab . All patients who receive at least one dose of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab will be included in the tox icity analysis. This includes participa nts who 
receive study drug and are ultimately deemed ineligible.  
 
13.6.2  Evaluation of Response  
 
All eligible patients included in the study must be assessed for response to treatment, 
even if there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible.  Each 
patient will be assigned one of the following categories:  1) complete response, 2) partial 
response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 
6) early death fro m toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not 
assessable, insufficient data).  [Note:  By arbitrary convention, category 9 usually 
designates the “unknown” status of any type of data in a clinical database.]  
 
All of the patients who  met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of those 
who received no study medication) should be included in the main analysis of the 
response rate.  Patients in response categories 4 -9 should be considered to have a 
treatment failure (disea se progression).  Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug 
administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate.  Precise 
definitions for categories 4 -9 will be protocol specific.  
 
All conclusions should be based on all eligible patients.  Subanalyses may then be 
performed on the basis of a subset of patients, excluding those for whom major protocol 
deviations have been identified ( e.g., early death due to other reasons, early 
discontinuation of treatment, major protocol violations, etc.).  However, these 
subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning treatment 
efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis should be clearly 
reported.  The 95% confidence intervals should also be provided.

14 STUDY STATUS UPDATES  AND STUDY CLOSURE  
 
14.1 Definitions of Study Status Changes  
 
14.1.1  Temporarily Closed to Accrual  
 
The study status is Temporarily Closed to Accrual when no patient slots are currently 
available, but there is the possibility that t he trial will re -open for accrual (patient slots 
become available).  Sites are not permitted to accrue additional patients until CTEP is 
notified of Re -Activation.  
 
Study status will need to be changed to Temporarily Closed to Accrual when any of the 
follo wing criteria are met:  
 
 
• Sites are notified by CTEP (via Request for Rapid Amendment [RRA]) of 
changes in the risk/benefit ratio that necessitate changes to the patient Informed 
Consent document.  Requested changes will be specified in the RRA and must be 
reviewed by the study’s IRB.  
• CTEP and the lead investigator agree that unacceptable toxicities necessitate a 
discussion to change the dosing/regimen.  
• A protocol -defined benchmark has been achieved (such as an interim analysis 
before proceeding to the next stage).  
 
14.1.2  Closed to Accrual  
 
The study status is (permanently) Closed to Accrual when no more patient enrollment 
slots are available, and at least one patient is still actively receiving the study treatment.  
Sites are no longer permitted to enroll additional patients.  
 
Patient slots are no longer available when the following criteria are met:  
 
 
• The pre -specified number of evaluable patients has been successfully enrolled, 
treated, and evaluated.  
• The study treatment has failed to meet the pre -specifi ed efficacy goal at the stage 
1 interim analysis.  
• CTEP and the investigators agree that unacceptable toxicities preclude further 
enrollment.  
 
14.1.3  Closed to Accrual and Treatment  
 
The study status is Closed to Accrual and Treatment when no more patient enrollme nt 
slots are available and no patients are currently receiving the study treatment.  Patients 
may still be enrolled on the protocol only for the purposes of follow -up. 
NCI Protocol #: 9672  
Version Date:   27April 2018  
 
87  
Patient accrual and treatment will be permanently halted when any of the following 
criteria are met:  
 
• Enrollment was previously closed (study status of “Closed to Accrual”), and no 
patients are receiving the study treatment.  
• CTEP and the investigators agree that unacceptable toxicities preclude further 
enrollment.  In this case, CTEP and the  investigators must collaborate to alter the 
regimen or to halt the study treatment altogether as soon as it can be safely done 
for patients currently receiving treatment.  
 
CTEP and Theradex must be notified  when patients are no longer receiving treatment  
[i.e., when the last patient(s) to be receiving treatment is/are no longer receiving the study 
regimen for any reason].  
 
14.1.4  Closed to Follow -Up 
 
The study is considered Closed to Follow -Up when all protocol -defined follow -up 
procedures have been completed for all patients who have not been removed from the 
study for other reasons.  That is, there are no outstanding follow -up procedures to be 
performed as mandated by the protocol.  
 
CTEP does not need to be notified of a status change to “Closed to Follow Up. ” 
 
14.1.5  Complete  
 
Study is considered Complete if it has been at least thirty (30) days since the last patient 
follow -up evaluation.   
 
A citation to a final study report (manuscript, meeting abstract, etc.) is required with the 
submission of the Protocol Statu s Update Form to CTEP PIO.   
 
 
14.2 Responsibility for Filing Protocol Status Update Forms  
 
CTEP must be notified of all study status changes in Section 14.1 (except for Closed to Follow -
Up) by the Corresponding O rganization via Protocol Status Update Form, available from the 
CTEP website at http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/default.htm#amendments .    
 
Theradex must be n otified as soon as all patients are off treatment ( i.e., when study status 
changes to Closed to Accrual and Treatment).  Theradex will produce a report within 90 days of 
this notification.

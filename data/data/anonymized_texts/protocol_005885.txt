1.0 BACKGROUND  
 
Alzheimer  disease (AD),  the most  common cause of dementia,  is a neurodegenerative 
disorder  with the pathological abnormality  of beta- amyloid (Aβ)  plaques.  One promising  
treatment  for AD aims at clearing  Aβ plaques  through  immunotherapy.  Patients  with amnestic  
mild cognitive impairment  (a-MCI)  are a group recognized at  being at high risk of progressing to 
Alzheimer  disease.  Treatment  of a-MCI with immunotherapy  with intravenous  immunoglobulins  
(IVIG)  could potentially  reduce the risk of progression to Alzheimer  disease.  
Evidence for immunotherapy  as a therapy  for AD had its beginnings  in 1996  when 
Solomon and colleagues  demonstrated in vitro that Aβ monoclonal antibodies  disassembled Aβ 
fibrils.  This potential strategy  of immunotherapy  for AD was further  supported by Schenk,  et al. 
[1] who found  that Aβ vaccination of mice  diminished Aβ plaques.  
Immunotherapy  research eventually  progressed to a phase II trial of active immunization 
against  Aβ-42 in 2001 and initially  showed promising  results.  The group of subjects  who 
successfully  developed Aβ antibodies  showed not only a significantly  slower  rate of cognitive  
decline over one year compared to the placebo group,  but also improvement  in memory  scores  
which positively  correlated with antibody  titer [2]. A later neuropathological  examination of three  
AD patients  who were  actively  immunized against  Aβ (deaths  were  not attributed to the 
immunization)  revealed  remarkable clearance of cortical Aβ  [3]. Unfortunately,  6% of the 298 
participants  who were  immunized developed  an aseptic  meningoencephalitis  and the trial was 
discontinued [4]. 
A leading theory  regarding the etiology  of this postvaccination meningoencephalitis  is T- 
cell mediated inflammation triggered by the Aβ-42 molecule used for active  immunization [4]. 
One strategy  to avoid  this adverse inflammation is  to administer  the Aβ antibodies  passively  
such  as via IVIG.  
Commercial  IVIG has been shown to contain antibodies  to Aβ [5] [6]. The molecular  
mechanism  of Aβ clearance by IVIG was studied  in vitro by Istrin and colleagues  [6] who found  
that the antibodies  in IVIG disassembled the fibril plaques  by enhancing microglial migration  
thus leading  to the phagocytosis  of Aβ. 
In an open- label study,  Dodel  and colleagues  [7] found that  AD patients  treated with 
IVIG (Octagam®  0.4 g/kg daily x 3 days every  4 weeks  for 6 months)  demonstrated a mean  
cognitive improvement  of 3.7 points  on the ADAS- cog after 6 months  of treatment.  Dodel  et al. 
[7] also found that Aβ levels  in the CSF decreased by 30% whereas  serum  Aβ levels  increased,  
thus supporting amyloid clearance theories.  There were  no serious  adverse events  associated 
with IVIG in this study.  
Relkin et  al. [8] completed an 18- month open -label study  of IVIG (Gammagard)  for mild 
AD where subjects  were  randomized to four consecutive  dosing periods:  1) 0.4 g/kg every  2 
weeks,  2) 0.4 g/kg/week,  3) 1 g/kg every  2 weeks, and 4)  2 g/kg every  4 weeks  for 6 months  
followed by a 3-month washout.  All patients  were  then treated with 1g/kg  every  2 weeks starting  
in months  10 through 12,  then 0.4 g/kg every  2 weeks  starting  in months  13-18. The results  
showed a dose- dependent  increase in serum  Aβ suggesting  amyloid  clearance.  A mean  
improvement  of 2.5 points  on the MMSE  after 6 months  (and mean  improvement  of 0.5 points  at 
18 months)  was observed;  this is contrasted to the expected 1.5 point  decline per 6 months  with 
AD. Higher  doses  of IVIG did not lead to higher  cognitive scores  and, in fact, the group treated

Version:   6.8.16   
  
 
with the lowest  dose of 0.4 g/kg per week  maintained the highest  MMSE  scores.  There were  no 
serious  adverse events  during this study.  
In a Phase II trial of IVIG (Gammagard 10%)  in mild  to moderate Alzheimer  disease,  
Relkin et  al [9] studied IVIG at doses  ranging from 0.2  to 0.8 g/kg every  two to four weeks over 
18 months.  The study  demonstrated significantly  decreased cognitive  decline on the ADAS- cog 
as well as significantly  decreased brain atrophy  in subjects  receiving  early  IVIG compared to the 
delayed treatment  arm (placebo for 6 months  then IVIG).  On MRI, the annual  ventricular  
enlargement  rate was 6.7%  for those treated with IVIG  compared to 12.3%  for those previously  
taking  placebo;  the rate of atrophy  was lowest  with the IVIG dose of 0.4 g/kg every  2 weeks.  
There were  no serious  adverse events  during this study.  
There are two ongoing  phase III  trials of IVIG 10% (Octagam  and Gammagard)  for mild 
to moderate AD. 
In July 2009,  Fillit et al [10] published a retrospective  analysis  of the risk of AD and 
related disorders  in people ≥ 65 with a prior history  of one or more  IVIG treatments  for 
indications  other  than AD. Cases  were  matched to controls  on age, gender,  and risk factors  for 
AD and related disorders.  This study  analyzed an approximate 4-year period and demonstrated 
that previous  treatment  with IVIG was associated with a 42% lower  risk of developing  AD and 
related disorders.  
The potential protective effect  of IVIG against  AD could best be utilized  in persons  
identified to be at greatest  risk for developing  AD prior to the development  of advanced disease 
and neuropathology.  Persons  with a -MCI have been identified a group at high risk of 
progressing to AD with a conversion rate of approximately  15% per year. [11, 12] Vermuri used 
data from the Alzheimer  Disease  Neuroimaging Initiative including  CDR- SB and MMSE  to 
assess disease  progression (while  investigating  potential biomarkers,  MRI and CSF)  of AD and 
demonstrated that 60 of the 192 subjects  with a -MCI converted to AD over 1.5 years;  i.e., 
annual conversion rate from a-MCI to AD of 20.8%  [13]. 
This study  will investigate treating persons  with a-MCI with IVIG (NewGam  10%)  0.4g/kg 
every  14 days over the course of three  months with the intent  of showing  differences  in brain 
MRI volume,  cognition,  and conversion to AD when compared with placebo  after 24 months.  We 
chose  this dose  of IVIG based on recent  evidence from Relkin  [8] who showed that this may be 
an optimal  IVIG dose  for reduction of brain atrophy  in patients  with AD.  Furthermore,  Fillet [10] 
demonstrated a lower  risk of AD in patients  who had received only  one treatment  of IVIG.

5.0 SUBJECT  RANDOMIZATION  AND ENROLLMENT  
 
Prior to the start of enrollment,  the following  critical documents  must  be filed in the 
sponsor’s  regulatory  binder (trial master  file): 
• Investigational new drug (IND)  application approved by the FDA 
• Sutter  Health Central  Institutional Review  Committee (SHCIRC)  approval  of 
the study  protocol and the informed consent  form (ICF)  
• Signed and dated study  protocol  
• Completed Federal Drug Administration (FDA)  Form  1572  
• Current  curricula  vitae and medical licenses  (if applicable)  of the Principal 
Investigator  (PI) and all Sub-Investigators  listed  on the Form  FDA 1572;  
• Name,  address,  and membership of the IRB, and/or  written statement  that IRB 
is properly  constituted and operates  according  to Good  Clinical  Practices  (GCP)  
• Investigator’s  Brochure  
• Laboratory  normal  range and documentation of laboratory  certification  (or 
equivalent).  
5.1 Randomization 
Once subjects  have satisfied  all subject  selection criteria and signed an informed 
consent,  they may be randomized.  The randomization scheme will be developed by the 
research scientist.  The research pharmacist  will receive the randomization assignment  from the 
research scientist.  Subjects  will be randomized (1:1)  by the research pharmacist  to receive

Version:   6.8.16   
  
 
either  NewGam  10% 0.4 g/kg or 0.9%  saline placebo once every 14 days for two months  for a 
total of five infusions.  
5.2 Enrollment  
A subject  is considered enrolled  when they have been  randomized  and received  any 
amount  of study  medication (i.e.,  IVIG or placebo)  by infusion.  
 
6.0 STUDY  DRUG  AND TREATMENT  
 
6.1 Description of  study  drug 
NewGam,  the current  working title for a new IVIG formulation,  is a newly  developed 10% 
human normal  immunoglobulin solution ready  for intravenous  administration.  Adverse Drug 
Reactions  (ADRs)  reported for NewGam  are expected to be similar  in type and intensity  to  
those reported with other  IVIG preparations.  
The NewGam  manufacturing  process  achieves  a significant  viral reduction through a 
combination of two dedicated manufacturing  process  steps:  solvent/detergent  (S/D)  treatment  
and nanofiltration (20 nm). Based on the combination of these two steps,  NewGam  complies  
with the latest  international consensus  on best practices  for viral safety.  The Source Q 
chromatography  (ion-exchange chromatography)  step in the NewGam  process  also contributes  
significantly  to the viral safety  of NewGam.  The efficacy  of the virus inactivation procedures  has 
been extensively  validated according  to relevant  international  guidelines  in place.  Further  
information can be found  in the current  Investigator’s  Brochure.  
6.2 Shipping,  handling,  and storage 
IVIG will be shipped directly  to the pharmacy  or investigational site,  after all required  
regulatory  and legal documents  have been received by the Sponsor.  
Upon receipt  of the study  drug shipments,  the unblinded  pharmacist  will verify the 
condition of the study  drug and perform  study  drug accountability.  Acknowledgement  of receipt  
will be documented  in the Pharmacy  Binder.  A temperature logger  showing  the transport  
temperature will be read out by the shipper  and release the drug if the transport  temperature is 
verified  to be between +2°C  to + 8°C (36°F to 46°F).  If there was a deviation  from this 
temperature range,  an Octapharma Project  Manager  or Qualified Person must  assess the 
temperature log and approve release.  
The study  drug will be stored in a secure  area with access restricted only  to authorized 
personnel.  NewGam  may be stored for 15 months  at +2°C  to + 8°C (36°F to 46°F)  from the date 
of manufacture.  
6.3 Special  precautions for storage  
• Do not freeze.  Frozen product  should not be used 
• Do not use after  expiration  date 
• Other  than the unblinded pharmacist,  all other  site personnel are fully blinded and may 
not handl e, store or dispense study  drug 
6.4 Drug  accountability  
The investigator  is responsible to ensure supervision of accurate monitoring of the 
receipt,  storage  and allocation of the study  drug.  Copies  of all invoices  of study  drug shipments  
must  be retained.  Accurate study  drug inventory,  dispensing  and accountability  logs must  be 
obtained and stored in the Pharmacy  Binder.  
Sutter  Institute  for Medical  Research  Protocol  PI: Shawn  Kile MD 
Page  12 
Version:   6.8.16   
  
 
6.5 Blinding and unblinding 
 
The study  coordinator,  investigator,  and infusion nurse will be blinded to whether  the 
subject  is receiving  placebo or  NewGam.  The pharmacist  will receive the assignment  from the 
research scientist  who will develop the randomization scheme.  Both will know  of the subject’s  
treatment  assignment.  While participating in the study, a subject’s  treatment assignment  should 
only be unblinded when knowledge of the treatment  is essential  for the further  medical 
management  of the subject. Unblinding  for any  other  reason during the study will be considered a 
protocol  violation.  
 
Subjects participating in the extension portion of the study may be unblinded upon study 
completion (Visit 15/month 60).  Subjects declining participation in the extension portion of the 
study or subjects not completing the study will be unblinded upon request . 
 
6.6 Study  drug  dosage 
The dose  level of IVIG at 0.4 g/kg or 0.9%  saline placebo will be administered by IV 
infusion once every  14 days for two months.  There is no provision for dose adjustments  by the 
investigator  under  this protocol.  
6.7 Study  drug  preparation and infusion 
• The unblinded pharmacist  will prepare the IVIG or placebo for each  infusion.  
• The IVIG should be inspected visually  for particulate matter  and discoloration prior  to 
administration,  whenever  solution and container  permit.  Do not  use if turbid  and/or  
discoloration is observed.  
• The IVIG must  not be mixed  with other  medicinal  products  or administered 
simultaneously  with other  intravenous  preparation in the same infusion set.  Do not mix 
with IVIG products  from other  manufacturers.  
• Do not freeze.  Solutions  that have  been frozen should not  be used.  
• IVIG bottle is for single use only. NewGam  contains  no preservative.  Any bottle that has 
been entered should be used promptly.  Partially  used bottles  should be discarded.  
• Content  of IVIG bottles  may be pooled under  aseptic  conditions  into sterile infusion bags  
and infused within  8 hours  after pooling  (within 72 hours  if stored at 2-8°C [36-46°F]).  
• Do not use after expiration  date.  
• IVIG should not be diluted.  
• IVIG must  be allowed to warm  to room  or body  temperature prior to infusion  if stored at 
2-8°C (36-46°F).  
• 0.4 g/kg body  weight  of Newgam  10% or 0.9%  saline placebo is transferred into an EVA 
infusion bag. 
• The infusion  bag must  be covered with a dark hood  and dark infusion lines  attached 
prior to infusion to maintain  the study  blind.  
6.8 Incompatibilities  
• NewGam  must  not be mixed  with other  medicinal  products  or administered 
simultaneously  with other  intravenous  preparations  in the same infusion  set. 
Sutter  Institute  for Medical  Research  Protocol  PI: Shawn  Kile MD 
Page  13 
Version:   6.8.16   
  
 
6.9 Administration 
• IVIG should be inspected visually  for particulate matter  and discoloration prior to 
administration,  whenever  solution and container  permit.  Do not  use if turbid  and/or  
discoloration is observe  
• IVIG should be at room  or body  temperature during  administration.  Only administer  
intravenously.  
• Any bottle that  has been opened should be used promptly.  Partially  used bottles  should 
be discarded.  
• NewGam  is not supplied with an infusion  set. If an in-line filter is used  the pore size 
should be 0.2 – 200 microns.  
• Do not use a needle of larger  than 16 gauge  to prevent  the possibility  of coring.  Insert  
needle only  once,  within the stopper  area delineated (by the raised ring for penetration).  
The stopper  should be penetrated perpendicular  to the plane of the stopper  within  the 
ring. 
6.10 Rate  of administration 
The initial infusion  rate of IVIG (NewGam)  or placebo will be 0.01 mL/kg/min (60 
mg/kg/hr)  for the first 30 minutes;  if tolerated,  advanced to 0.02 mL/kg/min  (120 mg/kg/hr)  for 
the second 30 minutes;  if tolerated,  advanced to 0.03 mL/kg/min (180 mg/kg/hr)  for the second  
30 minutes  and, if tolerated,  advanced to 0.04 mL/kg/min  (240 mg/kg/hr)  for the remaining  time 
at the discretion of the treating Investigator.  
If adverse events  (AEs)  occur  during  infusion,  the rate should be reduced to half the rate 
at which  the event  occurred,  or the infusion interrupted until symptoms  subside.  The infusion  
may then be resumed at  a rate tolerated by the patient.  
The batch number(s)  and number  of different  vial sizes  used will be recorded on the 
drug accountability  form.  
6.11 Concomitant  therapy  
6.11.1  Prohibited  
During the course of the study,  experimental  medications  for MCI or AD and all other  
experimental  medications  are prohibited.  Subject  must  refrain  from using  any medication,  
vitamin,  or herbal  supplement  considered to enhance cognition or indicated  for a-MCI or AD 
unless  approved by the investigator.  Prohibited medications,  vitamins  and herbal supplement  
included but  are not limited to cholinesterase inhibitors,  memantine,  Axona, ginko  biloba,  and 
huperzine.  
6.11.1  Permitted  
Concomitant  medications  will be assessed  at all study  visits.  Concomitant  medications  
are prescribed or over-the-counter  medications  and should be consistent  with the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Concomitant  medication appropriate to the subject’s  condition may 
be prescribed during the course  of the study  with the exception of those listed above.  
Routine vaccinations  (i.e., flu vaccination)  with commercially  available  therapeutics  are 
permitted but must  not be given  within  four weeks  before or after the administrat ion of the study  
drug.  No vaccination for a-MCI or AD is allowed during  the course of the study.

volume between the 0.4 g/kg NewGam  or 0.9%  saline  solution (placebo)  groups.  
 
9.0 WITHDRAWAL  AND REPLACEMENT  OF SUBJECTS  
 
9.1 Criteria  for subject  withdrawal  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and other  applicable regulations,  a subject  
has the right to withdraw  from the study  at any time and for any reason.  If a subject  requests  or 
decides  to withdraw,  every  attempt  will be made  to complete an early  termination visit.  
The investigator  has the right to withdraw  subjects  from the study  if a subject:  
• Is in significant  violation of  the protocol  
• Experiences  an intolerable AE or SAE 
• Is non-compliant  
• Withdrawal  of consent  
• Lost to follow  up 
• Death 
9.2 Replacement  of subjects 
Subjects  screened but  not randomized will  be replaced.  Subjects  withdrawn  after 
receiving  the third infusion will not be replaced but  will be followed if  they provide consent.  
 
10.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
10.1 Adverse event  definition 
An AE is any untoward event  that occurs  any time after randomization to the double 
blind treatment  until the end of study  (visit 12, visit 15, or ET visit).  The event  need not have  a 
causal relationship with the study  drug or treatment.  Adverse events  include,  but are not limited  
to clinically  significant  changes  in clinical status,  physical  or neurological examinations,  ECG,  
abnormal laboratory  findings,  exacerbations  of underlying  disease,  and drug interactions,  
Sutter  Institute  for Medical  Research  Protocol  PI: Shawn  Kile MD 
Page  20 
Version:   6.8.16   
 dependency,  misuse  and abuse.  All AEs must  be documented on the Adverse  Event  page of 
the CRF and in the  subject’s  medical notes.  Each  AE is evaluated for duration,  severity,  
seriousness,  relatedness  to study  drug,  and action  taken.  The investigator  may be asked to 
provide follow -up information.  
10.2 Serious adverse event  (SAE)  definition  
A serious  adverse event  is one that  at any dose  (including  overdose):  
• Results  in death 
• Is life-threatening1 
• Requires  inpatient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results  in persistent  or significant  disability  or incapacity2 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is a medically  important  condition:  
Suspected transmission of an infectious  agent,  
Thromboembolic  events,  
Cerebral hemorrhage resulting  in clinical disability,  or 
Other  reactions  that should be reported in an expedited manner  although they 
did not immediately  result  in one of the above seriousness  criteria  
10.3 Other  relevant  drug safety  information:  
Any safety  information relating  to 
• Pregnancies/breastfeeding,  
• Drug  abuse (persistent, sporadic  or intentional excessive use of a medicinal product  
inconsistent  with the SPC or acceptable medical  practice),  
• Overdose (treatment  exceeding  the medically  recommended dose),  
• Medication errors  (prescribing  or dispensing  error),  
• Interactions  with other  medicinal products  or devices  
• Associated with NewGam  10%,  even  if no adverse drug reaction occurred.  
 
 
1“Life-threatening”  means  that the subject  was at immediate risk of death  at the time of  the serious  adverse event;  it does  
not refer to a serious  adverse event  that hypothetically  might  have  caused  death if  it were more  severe.  
2“Persistent  or significant  disability  or incapacity”  means  that there  is a substantial  disruption of a person’s  ability  to carry  
out normal  life functions.

10.4 Adverse events severity 
Severity  of AEs will be assessed using the National  Cancer  Institute  (NCI)  Common 
Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse Events  (CTCAE)  Version 3.0 for toxicity  and adverse event  
reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE  Version 3.0 can be downloaded  from the CTEP  homepage  
(http://ctep.info.nih.gov ). AEs not corresponding  to the CTCAE  term will be assessed  
according  to their impact on the subject’s  ability  to perform  daily activities  as follows:  
• Mild (grade 1) – the AE does  not interfere in a significant  manner  with the 
subject’s  normal  functioning level.  It may be an annoyance.  
• Moderate (grade 2) – the AE produces  some impairment  of functioning,  but is 
not hazardous  to health.  It is uncomfortable or an embarrassment.  
• Severe (grade 3) – the AE produces  significant  impairment  of functioning  or 
incapacitation and is  a definite hazard to the subject’s  health.  
• Life Threatening (grade 4) – Life threatening or disabling.  
• Fatal  (grade 5)  Causes  death of the participant.  
The investigator  must  appraise all abnormal  laboratory  results  for their clinical 
significance.  If any abnormal  laboratory  result  is considered clinically  significant,  the investigator  
must  provide details  about  the action taken with respect  to the test drug and about  the patient’s  
outcome.  
10.5 Adverse event  reporting 
All AEs, whether  observed  by the investigator  or reported by the patient,  must  be 
recorded,  with details  about the duration and intensity  of each episode,  the action taken with 
respect  to the test drug,  and the patient’s  outcome.  The investigator  must  evaluate each  
adverse experience for its relationship to the test drug and for its seriousness.  The initial report  
must  be as complete as  possible,  including  details  of the current  illness  and (serious)  adverse 
event,  and an assessment  of the causal relationship between the event  and the investigational  
product(s).  Information not available  at the time of the initial report  (e.g.,  an end date for the 
adverse event  or laboratory  values  received after the report)  must  be documented on a follow - 
up form.  A final report to document  resolution of the adverse event  is required.  
10.6 Investigator  reporting to the FDA 
Adverse drug reactions  that are serious,  unlisted/unexpected,  and at least  possibly  
associated to the drug,  and that have  not previously  been reported in the Investigators  
brochure,  or reference safety  information document  should be reported promptly  to the FDA in 
writing  by each investigator/physician engaged in clinical  research.  A clear  description of the 
suspected reaction should be provided  along  with an assessment  as to whether  the event  is 
drug or disease related.  
The investigator/physician shall  notify  the FDA by telephone or  by fax of any unexpected 
fatal or life threatening  experience  associated with the use of the drug as soon  as possible,  but 
no later than 7 calendar  days after the sponsors  initial receipt  of the information.  Each  phone 
call or fax shall be transmitted to the FDA new drug review  division in the Center  for Drug 
Evaluation and Research or  the product  review  division  in the Center  for Biologics  Evaluation 
and Research that has responsibility  for review  of the IND if applicable.  
10.7 Reporting of adverse drug reactions and other  safety  information to study  
supporter  
All suspected AEs and other  safety  information associated with the administration of 
NewGam  have to be reported to:

24 hrs). Non-serious  adverse drug reactions  and other  safety  information should be reported to 
Octapharma,  if possible,  upon recognition but no later than 10 days.  
10.8 Report  of adverse events to  the institutional  review  board 
The principal  investigator  is required to notify  the Sutter  Health  Institutional Review  
Committee  (SHCIRC)  of a serious  adverse event  according  to institutional  policy.  
10.9 Reporting of adverse drug reactions and other  safety  information to study  
sponsor  
Octapharma shall notify  the Investigator  via an IND Safety  Report  of the following  
information:  
• Any AE associated with the use of study  drug in any studies  involving  Newgam  10% that 
is both serious  and unexpected.  
• Any finding  from tests in laboratory  animals  that suggests  a significant  risk for human  
subjects  including  reports  of mutagenicity,  teratogenicity,  or carcinogenicity.  
10.10 Adverse event  updates 
The investigator  must  keep  copies  of all AE information,  including  correspondence with 
Octapharma and the SHCIRC,  on file. 
The investigator  shall notify  the SHCIRC promptly  of any new serious  and unexpected 
AE(s)  or significant  risks to subjects.  
 
11.0 IND ANNUAL  REPORTS  
 
The conduct  of the study  will comply  with all FDA safety  reporting requirements.  
11.1 IND annual  reports  
If the FDA has granted an IND number,  it is a requirement  of 21 CFR 312.33,  that an 
annual  report  is provided to the FDA within  60-days of the IND anniversary  date.  21 CRF 312.33 
provides  the data elements that  are to be submitted in the report.  The Annual  Report  should be 
filed in the study's Regulatory  Binder,  and a copy  provided to Octapharma as a supporter  of this 
study  as follows:

2.0 12.0 RESPONSE CRITERIA  
 
The MMSE,  CDR- SB, and ADAS- cog are scheduled to occur  at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, 
48, and 60 months  after Visit 1. 
 
3.0 13.0 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
 
When  an emergency  occurs  that requires  a deviation from the protocol  for a subject,  a 
deviation will be made only  for that subject.  A decision will  be made as  soon as possible to  
determine whether  or not the subject  (for whom  the deviation from protocol was effected)  is to 
continue in the study. The subject’s  medical  records  will completely  describe the deviation from 
the protocol and state  the reasons  for such deviation.  In addition,  the Investigator  will notify  the 
SHCIRC in writing  of such deviation from protocol.  
Non-emergency  minor  deviations  from the protocol  will be permitted with approval of  the 
principal investigator.  
 
14.0 DATA  RECORDING,  RETENTION,  AND MONITORING  
 
14.1 Data  entry  and maintenance  
Investigator  responsibilities  are set out in the ICH guideline  for Good  Clinical Practice  
(GCP)  and in the US Code  of Federal Regulations.  
Study  personnel will construct  case report  forms  (CRFs),  record all study  data onto the 
CRFs  and enter  the data into a 21 CFR Part  11 compliant  database.  
14.2 Study  records retention 
The investigator  must  ensure that the records  and documents  pertaining to the conduct  
of the study  and the distribution of the study  drug,  that is copies  of CRFs  and source documents  
(original documents,  data,  and records  [e.g.,  hospital  records;  clinical and office  charts;  
laboratory  notes;  memoranda;  subject’s  diaries  or evaluation checklists;  SAE reports,  pharmacy  
dispensing records;  recorded data from automated instruments;  copies  or transcriptions  certified  
after verification as  being accurate copies;  microfiches;  photographic  nega tives,  microfilm,  or 
magnetic  media;  x-rays;  subject  files; and records  kept at the pharmacy,  at the laboratories,  and 
at medico- technical departments  involved in the clinical  study;  documents  regarding subject  
treatment  and study  drug accountability;  original signed informed consents,  etc.])  be retained by 
the investigator  for as long as needed to comply  with national and international  regulations  
(generally  2 years  after discontinuing  clinical development  or after the last marketing  approval).  
The investigator  agrees  to adhere to the document/records  retention procedures  by signing the 
protocol.  
14.3 Data  monitoring  committee 
The Data Monitoring  Committee  (DMC)  will be composed of independent  reviewers  who 
will meet  to review  the efficacy  and safety  data and determine a risk/benefit  analysis  in this 
subject  population.  The purpose of the DMC  is to advise  on serious  safety  considerations,  lack 
of efficacy,  and any  other  considerations  within the charge to the Committee. The DMC may 
request  additional meetings  or safety  reports  as deemed necessary  upon discussion  with the 
investigator  or Octapharma and its  representatives.  The DMC  may stop the study  following  
review  of results  from the interim  analysis.

15.0 STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS  
 
15.1 Primary  endpoint  
The aim of the primary  efficacy  analysis  is to demonstrate an advantage for subjects  
treated with IVIG over subjects  treated with placebo at  the end of the study  as measured by 
change in ventricular  volume.  The primary  efficacy  analyses  will be performed on the intent -to- 
treat (ITT)  population.  The ITT population is  defined as all subjects  who were  randomized,  
received three or more infusions,  and had a brain MRI at baseline and at 24 months.  
Annualized percent  change in total ventricular  volume  (APCV)  is the primary  biomarker  
of interest.  Brain  MRI will be obtained at  baseline,  12 months,  24 months,  36 months,  48 
months,  and 60 months.  Differences  between the IVIG and placebo group at month 12,  24, 36, 
48, and 60 will be analyzed using  a 2 x 2 analysis  of variance.  Participants  will also be classified 
as early  MCI (EMCI)  if baseline  CDR- SB is less than 1.5, and late MCI (LMCI)  if CDR- SB is 
greater  than or  equal  to 1.5. 
Treatment  (IVIG,  placebo),  MCI status  (EMCI,  LMCI),  and the treatment  X MCI status  
interaction will  be included  in the model.  If the interaction is statistically  significant  (p< 0.05),  
MCI status  will be stratified and differences  in APCV between the groups  compared within  each 
stratum.  
15.2 Secondary  Endpoints  
15.2.1 Conversion to AD 
Conversion to AD is measured by NINCDS -ADRDA  and NIA [14] criteria  for diagnosis  of 
Alzheimer  Disease and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)  (Appendix  A). 
Kaplan- Meier  survival  curves  will be estimated and will plot the proportion of treatment  
and control subjects  who remain without  a diagnosis  of AD at month 24, 36, 48, and 60. The 
log-rank test will be used to determine whether  the survival  curves  are different  for the two 
groups  of subjects.  Cox proportional hazards  will be used to assess the incidence of AD in 
treatment  versus  control  subjects  adjusting for age and sex. 
15.2.2 Cognitive change  
The CDR- SB, MMSE,  and ADAS- cog are administered at baseline and at months  4, 8, 
12, 16, 20, 24, 36, 48, and 60.   Separate linear  mixed -effects  modeling  will be used to compare  
differences  in the scores  on each these tests  using all available observations.  Treatment  
(IVIG/placebo),  MCI status  (early,  late),  and treatment  X MCI status  will be fixed  factors  and the 
respective baseline score  will be included  as the continuous  covariate.  For statistically  
significant  (p< 0.05),  interactions,  MCI status  will be stratified and the analyses  will be 
conducted for each stratum.  
Data  will be analyzed to assess safety  after 25 subjects complete three  months  of follow - 
up. Safety  will be evaluated though documentation of adverse events.  Appropriate safety  data 
summaries  will be provided to the DSMC  after each  interim  analysis.  
15.2.3 CSF Aβ1-42/CSF P-Tau 181P  Alzheimer signature  
Annualized percent  change in ventricular  volume between the IVIG and placebo group at 
month  12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 will be also analyzed specifically  in subjects  with positive CSF 
Aβ1-42/CSF P Tau 181P  Alzheimer signature.

16.0    SAMPLE  SIZE  AND POWER  FOR  PRIMARY  ENDPOINT  
 
Twenty -five subjects  will be randomized to placebo and 25 subjects  will be randomized  
to the group receiving  IVIG. Twenty -five subjects  in each group provides  82% power  to detect  a 
120 unit difference in mean  ventricular  volume  between the groups  at month 26. This calculation 
is based on a two-sided test  with alpha set at 0.05.  
 
17.0    IMPLICATIONS  AND  DIRECTION FOR  FUTURE  STUDIES  
 
This study  is designed to assess the efficacy  of the smallest  reasonable dose of IVIG 
that could prevent  ventricular  atrophy  in patients  with a-MCI. Subjects  will receive IVIG  0.4g/kg  
every  2 weeks as the half-life of IVIG antibodies  has been reported as 9.3 days [8]; furthermore 
Relkin [8] found  the dosing  schedule of 0.4/kg every  2 weeks  to be most  effective  in reducing  
brain  atrophy.  [9] We decided to study  the smallest  reasonable course  of IVIG which  would be 5 
total treatments as  a 2g/kg  total treatment  dose is  standard dose used for other  indications  of 
IVIG (including  neurological disorders).  IVIG has not been investigated in a -MCI and we 
hypothesis  that patients  with early  Alzheimer’s  pathology  may require smaller  doses  of IVIG. 
Furthermore if effective, this short  course  would  both reduce the risk of IVIG treatment  adverse 
events  and reduce cost  of treatment.  Both of the former  would increase accessibility  of this 
treatment  to patients  with a -MCI. At the end of the two years  we plan to perform  an add-on 
study  with participating  subjects  to include an additional  three  years  of follow -up (five years  
total).  
If the results  of this exploratory  study  are found at the end of two years  to show  a trend 
towards  positive efficacy  with this treatment  strategy,  the current  study  may be expanded  to 
include  more  subjects  with dose- ranging investigations  or the results  used to design a large,  
multi- arm randomized trial. 
 
18.0 ETHICAL  AND LEGAL  ISSUES  
 
The study  will be submitted to the SHCIRC.  A data safety  monitoring committee will be 
convened to provide oversight  of subjects’ safety  before commencement  of the study.  
18.1 Institutional  review  board approval  
The protocol  for this study  has been designed in  accordance with the general  ethical  
principles  outlined in the Declaration  of Helsinki.  The review  of this protocol  by the SHCIRC and 
the performance of all aspects  of the study,  including  the methods  used for obtaining  informed 
consent,  must  also be in accordance with principles  enunciated in the declaration,  as well as 
ICH Guidelines,  Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations  (CFR),  Part 50 Protection of Human  
Subjects  and Part 56 Institutional Review  Boards.  
The investigator  will be responsible for preparing documents  for submission to the 
SHCIRC and obtaining  written approval  for this study.  The approval will  be obtained prior  to the 
initiation  of the study.  
The approval  for both the protocol and informed consent  must  specify  the date of 
approval,  protocol  number  and version,  or amendment  number.  
Any amendments  to the protocol after  receipt  of SHCIRC  approval must  be submitted by 
the Investigator  to the SHCIRC  for approval.  The Investigator  is also responsible for notifying   
the SHCIRC of any serious  deviations  from the protocol,  or anything else that may involve  
added risk to subjects.  
 
Sutter  Institute  for Medical  Research  Protocol  PI: Shawn  Kile MD 
Page  26 
Version:   6.8.16   
  
Any advertisements  used  to recruit  subjects  for the study  must  be reviewed  and  
approved by the SHCIRC  prior to use. 
18.2 Informed consent  
The investigator  must  obtain informed consent  of a subject  or his/her  designee  prior to 
any study  related procedures  as per GCPs  as set forth in the CFR and ICH guidelines.  
Documentation that informed consent  occurred prior to the subject’s  entry  into the study  
and the informed consent  process  should be recorded in the subject’s source  documents.  The 
original consent  form signed and dated by  the subject  and by the person consenting  the subject  
prior to the subject’s entry  into the study,  must  be maintained in the investigator’s  study  files. 
18.3 Subject  confidentiality  
Octapharma affirms  the subject’s  right to protection  against  invasion of privacy.  In 
compliance with United States  federal  regulations,  Octapharma requires  the investigator  to 
permit  Octapharma representatives  and, when necessary,  representatives  of the FDA or other  
regulatory  authorities  to review  and/or  copy any medical records  relevant  to the study  in 
accordance with local laws.  
Should direct  access to medical records  require a waiver  or authorization separate from 
the subject’s  statement  of informed consent,  it is the responsibility  of the Investigator  to obtain 
such  permission in writing  from the appropriate individual.  
18.4 Protocol  amendments  
Any amendment  to this protocol  must  be agreed to by the principal  investigator  and 
reviewed by Octapharma.  Amendments  should only be submitted to the SHCIRC  after 
consideration of Octapharma review.  Written  verification of SHCIRC approval  will be obtained 
before any  amendment  is implemented.  
18.5 Premature discontinuation of study  
The responsible local clinical investigator  and Octapharma have the right to discontinue 
this study  at any time for reasonable medical or  administrative reasons.  Possible reasons  for 
termination of the study  could be but  are not limited to:  
• Unsatisfactory  enrollment  with respect  to quantity  or quality.  
• Inaccurate or  incomplete data collection.  
• Falsification  of records.  
• Failure to adhere to the study  protocol.  
• Statistical  analysis  demonstrates  overwhelming  efficacy  of treatment.  
Any possible premature discontinuation would  be documented adequately  with reasons  
being  stated,  and information would have to be issued  according  to local requirements  (e.g.,  
SHCIRC/EC,  regulatory  authorities,  etc.).

20.0 APPENDIX  A. 
 
20.1 NINCDS -ADRDA  criteria for diagnosis Alzheimer  Disease [16] 
• Dementia established by  clinical examination and documented by the Mini-Mental State  
Test,  Blessed Dementia Scale or  some similar  examination,  and confirmed by 
neuropsychological tests  
• Deficits  in two or more  areas  of cognition  
• Progressive worsening of memory  and other  cognitive  functions  
• No disturbance of consciousness  
• Onset  between ages  40 and 90, most  often  after age 65 
• Absence of systemic disorders  or other  brain diseases  that in and of themselves  could 
account  for the progressive  deficits in memory  and cognition 
20.1.1 The diagnosis  of probable Alzheimer  disease is supported by: 
• Progressive deterioration of specific  cognitive skills  such as language (aphasia),  motor  
skills  (apraxia),  and perception (agnosia)  
• Impaired activities  of daily living  and altered patterns  of behavior  
• Family  history  of similar  disorders,  particularly  if confirmed neuropathologically  
• Laboratory  results  of: 
1. Normal lumbar  puncture as evaluated by standard techniques  
2. Normal pattern or  nonspecific  changes  in EEG,  such  as increased slow-wave  
activity  
3. Evidence of  cerebral  atrophy  on CT with progression documented by serial  
Observation  
20.1.2 Other  clinical features  consistent  with the diagnosis  of probable Alzheimer  
disease,  after exclusion of causes  of dementia other  than Alzheimer  disease:  
• Plateaus  in the progression of the illness  
• Associated symptoms  of depression,  insomnia,  incontinence,  delusions,  illusions,  
hallucinations;  catastrophic  verbal,  emotional,  or physical outbursts,  sexual  disorders,  
and weight  loss 
• Other  neurologic  abnormalities  in some patients,  especially  with more  advanced disease 
and including motor  signs  such as increased muscle  tone,  myoclonus,  or gait disorder

 25.0 AMENDMENT  1: FEBRUARY,  2011  
 
25.1 AMENDMENT  1: INTRODUCTION  
The mains  reason for protocol amendment  1 are to revise exclusion criteria 23,  Appendix  E 
Brain  MRI Instructions  and administrative changes.  
 
 
25.2 AMENDMENT  1: SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
Section 4.2 Exclusion  Criteria  – Exclusion 23 
Changed from:  
23.  Concurrent  or prior treatment  with cholinesterase inhibitors  and/or  memantine,  or Axona for 
cognitive enhancement.  Exceptions  (e.g. brief exposure  to one of these medications)  may be 
authorized if  agreed upon  by PI and sub-I) 
 
 
Changed to: 
23.  Concurrent  treatment  with cholinesterase inhibitors,  memantine,  Axona,  or other  
prescription cognitive enhancing  agents,  or discontinuation of any of these agents  within 90 
days prior to screening.  
 
 
Rationale:  Exclusion 23 was  originally  included because it may clinicians  have proposed 
cholinesterase inhibitors  and memantine may improve  cognitive function in patients  with MCI. 
We did not want this to confound the results  of the study.  A study  published  in the Archives  of 
Neurology  in January,  2011 found that cholinesterase inhibitors  or memantine were  not 
associated with clinical improvement  and may alternatively  be associated with a decline in 
patients  with MCI.  This information,  coupled with the fact the so many  practitioners  have started 
patients  with MCI on these medications  which  makes  recruitment  of medication- naive patients  
difficult,  led us  to amend this exclusion.  Therefore,  we are allowing  enrollment  of patients  
previously  exposed to cholinesterase inhibitors  and memantine after  a 90 day wash -out. 
 
 
Section 7.2.2  Study  Drug Infusion and Section 7.3.1 Study  Drug  Infusion  
Updated language in bold: Subjects  will be given the option of prophylaxis  oral acetaminophen,  
diphenhydramine,  or both 15-30 minutes  prior to infusion  
Rationale:  Standard of care is give prophylaxis  medications  30 minutes  prior to start of infusion.  
Section 7.3.3  One hour following final infusion at  Visit 6 
Section was completely  removed  since  visits  3 through 6 require  the subject  to stay at clinic  for 
15 minutes  post infusion.

30.0 AMENDMENT  6: SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
 
30.1 Introduction:  
Amendment  6 consists of changes  in the measurement  of the primary  endpoint  and 
statistical  analysis  plan in sections  15.1 and 15.2  
30.2 Rationale:  
Since the study  was designed and initiated,  research from the Alzheimer’s  Disease  
Neuroimaging  Initiative  (ADNI)  and others  have utilized  a sub-classification of early  MCI (EMCI)  
and late MCI (LMCI)  to improve  the understanding  of effects  of interventions  which  may be 
unique to particular  early  stages  in the progression of AD. Based on those studies,  and using  
the cognitive data available  in this study,  participants  were  classified  as EMCI  if baseline CDR - 
SB was less than or equal to 1.5 and LMCI  if CDR -SB was greater  than 1.5. 
This amendment  includes  the change of primary  endpoint  from ventricular  volume to 
annualized  percent  change in ventricular  volume.  The amendment  also reflects the change in 
the statistical  analysis  to include early  and late MCI as study  factors  for all endpoints.  
 
31.0 AMENDMENT  7: SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
 
31.1 Introduction:  
 
Amendment  7 consists of administrative changes  to the table of  contents and sections  15.1 and  15.2.

31.2 Rationale:  
 
To correct errors and add missing  CSF secondary  endpoint.  
 
32.0 AMENDMENT  8: SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
 
32.1 Introduction:  
In section 15.2 we  stated  “Participants  will also be classified as  early  MCI (EMCI)  if baseline CDR - 
SB is  less than 1.5, and late MCI  (LMCI)  if CDR- SB is  greater than  1.5.” This doesn't  say what 
happens  if a patient falls  at 1.5. Amendment 8  revises  to state LMCI  as 1.5 or greater.  
 
32.2 Rationale:  
The 1.5 cut -off more accurately depicts the early and late MCI  status in that there are no 
conversions  at year 1, and only 1 conversion at year  2 in the early MCI  status.  
 
33.0 AMENDMENT  9: SUMMARY  OF CHANGES  
33.1 Change:  
The protocol is amended to include unblinding subjects who want to know if they received IVIG or 
placebo. Subjects participating in the extension portion of the study may be unblinded upon study 
completion. Subjects who declined participation in the extension portion of the study or who did not complete the study will be unblinded upon request.  
The Pr incipal Investigator will inform subjects of their group assignment at their last study visit, and 
will not have access to individual subject data following study completion.  
This unblinding protocol was approved by the DSMC on 6/3/16. No changes were made  to the 
unblinding protocol during study participation.

1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background  
Stroke affects nearly 800,000 individuals in the United States per year and is the fifth  leading 
cause of death1. Carotid artery stenosis —the narrowing of the carotid arteries due to 
atherosclerotic plaques —is one of the leading causes of stroke. The annual risk of stroke in 
individuals with asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ACS) is about 1 to 3%, but the risk is around 4 to 
12% for individuals with symptomatic stenosis (SCS) without carotid intervention2. Early treatment 
of carotid stenosis  (CEA)  has the potential to prevent or delay the occurrence of strokes.   
Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a surgical procedure to remove the stenosis together with 
unstable plaque, thereby reducing the risk of stroke3. It has been found to be effective in patients 
with high -grade symptomatic ( ~70%) or asymptomatic (< 60%) internal carotid artery stenosis 
and has been proven to be superior to medical management alone4. Most perioperative strokes 
are ischemic in nature, some of which may be caused by the temporary interruption of blood flow 
during CEA when the carotid artery is clamped3. A carotid shunt may be used to minimize this 
interruption of blood flow and ensure sufficient cerebral perfusion during carotid cross clamping, 
which may decrease the incidence of perioperative stroke. Carotid shunting can either be used in 
all patients undergoing CEA (routine shunting) or in a proportion of patients who are at a high risk 
of developing cerebral ischemia during carotid clamping (selective shunting). However, t here is 
no conclusive evidence of the superiority of one method over the other, and it often depends on 
the surgeon’s preference and familiarity with the method3–5.   
1.2 Study Device  
1.2.1  Device Description  
The Integra Sundt™  internal and external (Loop) Carotid Endarterectomy Shunts are designed to 
provide temporary carotid bypass for cerebral circulation during carotid endarterectomy 
procedures.  
The Sundt ™ internal and external Carotid Endarterectomy shunts are constructed of silicone 
elastomer with stainless steel spring reinforcement to minimize kinking and occlusion of the 
cannula lumen and to aid in the ease of insertion of the proximal and distal ends.  The ends of the 
shunts have cone- shaped bulbs to facilitate fixation of the shunt in the vessel. Quite frequently in 
the internal type shunt a distal tourniquet is not required because, if the proper shunt size is 
selected, the bulb fits firmly enough against the wall of the vessel that there is no bleeding around 
the distal bulb. A tourniquet is always required on the proximal end of both the external and 
internal shunts and usually on the distal end of the external shunt

1.3 Intended Use  
The carotid endarter ectomy shunts are indicated for temporary carotid artery bypass during 
carotid endarterectomy procedures in order to help protect the cerebral hemispheres from 
ischemia during the period of carotid artery occlusion. These shunts are designed as temporary 
indwelling catheters and are not intended for permanent placement.

5.1 Device Performance  
The delegated site staff will colle ct information regarding the device performance.  
 
The following device performance questions will be part of the case report form and will be 
collected from the  patient medical record including both the operative note and the anesthesia 
record for the procedure.  For the “yes / no” questions below, if the medical record is silent on the 
answer to the question it will be assumed that the answer is “no”.  
1. Was the shunt use routine or selective?  If selective, specify the test and the result that 
led to use of the shunt.  
 
2. Was there any delay in surgery or complication due to preparation of the device for 
surgery? If yes, please explain.  
 
3. What was the clamping method type for shunt insertion?  
 
4. How long was the carotid artery cross clamped for shunt insertion?  
 
5. Was there any device- related damage to the artery during insertion of the shunt? If yes, 
please explain.  
 
6. Was there evidence of clot formation within the shunt at any point during the 
procedure?   If yes, describe how this was detected and what was the remedy.   What 
was the impact to the procedure?  
 
7. Was there any evidence of reduced flow within the shunt  other than clot formation (e.g. 
due to kinking, malposition within the artery)?  
 
8. Was there any evidence of excessive bleeding around the shunt after initial placement?  
If yes, what was the remedy and the result of that remedy? 
 
9. Did removal of the shunt cause vessel injury or complicate closure?  If yes, please 
explain.  
 
10. Was there evidenc e of post -operative cerebral ischemia noted in the neurological exam ?  
 
11. Did the subject experience injury to the artery due to the device as evidenced by the 
imaging of the carotid artery either by carotid duplex ultrasound or angiogram?  
 
12. Were there any other device- related complications  not previously recorded in the case 
report forms ? If yes, please explain.

6 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
The PMCF is a retrospective chart review. All analyses will be descriptive in nature. No formal 
statistical analyses will be performed. The study objectives will be presented by summary 
statistics.   
Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, quintiles, counts, and percentages) will be 
presented for all demographic (i.e. age,  gender , etc.), clinical baseline characteristics (dia gnosis, 
medical history, medicat ions), surgical procedures (procedures performed, duration of surgery)  
and complications.   
The primary objective will be evaluated by summarizing the incidence of injury to the artery or 
cerebral ischemia secondary to s hunt placement . 
All statistical analysis will be conducted using SAS . 
7 ETHICS AND REGUALTORY REQUIREMENTS  
7.1 Confidentiality  
In order to observe the confidentiality of personal data, each patient will be allocated a confidential 
identification code consisting of the investigator site number followed by a 3 -digit patient number. 
CRFs or any other documents submitted to the sponsor will identify the patient by this 
identification code. Each investigator will maintain a patient identification list which would detail 
the identification code along with the corresponding patient identifiers (name and date of birth).   
Each subject should be numbered in reverse chronological order from 001 as the most recent 
subject prior to study initiation at the site.  
7.2 Waiver of Consent  
A waiver of informed consent is key to perform this retrospective chart review study. Informed 
consent will not be possible to obtain as the care has already been provided by the 
surgeon/investigator and it is unlikely the patient will return to the surgeon for a clinical visit. In 
addition, this chart review involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects and the waiver will 
not affect the rights and welfare of the subjects since care has already been given.  
7.3 Waiver of HIPAA Authorization 
Waiver  of HIPAA authorization is key for the success of this chart review. Not only will it be difficult 
to obtain the authorization since the care has already been provided by the surgeon/investigator 
and it is unlikely that the patient will return to the surgeon for a clinical visit, but the use or 
 Integra LifeSciences   
 
Sundt™ Carotid Shunt PMCF Stu dy Confidential  Protocol Version 28- Nov-2018  
Protocol Version Number 1.0   Page 14 of 15 
 
disclosure of protected health information involves no more than a minimal risk to the privacy of 
the individuals.  
8 STUDY FINANCES  
The study will be funded by Integra Lifesciences Corporation. The Sundt™ internal and  external 
(Loop) Carotid Endarterectomy Shunt  is considered a pre- amendment device and is FDA 
registered under the device listing D024713.  
9 RETENTION 
Study records must be retained by the Investigator for 2 years following the conclusion/ 
termination of the study and the publication (if applicable). Study records should not be destroyed 
without prior written agreement between the Sponsor and the study I nvestigator. At the 
completion of the study, details of the archival process must be provided to the Sponsor. Study 
records are subject to inspection by applicable health and regulatory agencies at any time.  
10 PUBLICATION PLA N

Corporation SOPs. It will include the study objectives, the methodology, statistical analysis and 
raw data listings, and the conclusions of the study.  
The sponsor is not allowed to use investigator's name in any publication without prior written 
consent. The investigator is not allowed to use sponsor's name in any publication without prior

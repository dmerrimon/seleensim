2 This is a phase II open label study on the use of Ibrutinib on the inhibition of food -induced anaphylaxis in 
adults with food allerg y.  Ibrutinib (brand name Imbru vica) is currently FDA approved for the treatment of 
mantle cell lymphoma  (MCL) , chronic lymphocytic leukemia  (CLL) , and Waldenstrom’s macroglobulineia  
(WM) .  We propose to administer this  approved  drug to adults with food allergy to inhibit anaphylaxis.  
STUDY SCHEMA  
This is open -label study consists of 2 parts.  Part 1 is designed to determine the fewest doses and 
shortest length of time , from two days to up to 7 days , needed for ibrutinib to fully  inhibit tests for food 
allergy, and to determine the length of persistence of efficacy  after the drug is stopped .  Part 2  is 
designed to determine the ability of ibrutinib, optimally dosed as defined in Part 1, to prevent signs and  
symptoms of anaphylaxis  during a food challenge in food -
allerg ic subjects .    
   
Part 1 : At Visit 1 , after undergoing informed consent 
subject s will be screened for eligibility  (history, skin prick test 
[SPT] to peanut /tree nuts  with histamine and saline SPT 
positive and negative controls, respectively , basophil 
activation test [BAT], peanut  or tree nut -specific IgE).  30 mL 
of peripheral blood will be collected by a trained phlebotomist 
using standard procedures for BAT, sIgE to peanut /tree nuts  
and components, quantitative immunoglobulins ( QUIGs ), 
eosinophil and basophil enumeration , as well a s screening 
for toxicities (see below).   After this visit, subjects will be given ibrutinib (two 
doses of 420 mg of ibrutinib to start the following day and to be taken orally at 
8am exactly 24 hours apart) and return for Visit 2 to undergo repeat PST and 
phlebotomy for testing preformed in an identical manner to Visit 1. If two 
consecutive doses of 420 mg of ibrutinib given 24 hours apart is insufficient 
to cause >80% inhibition of the SPT and BAT response, subjects will be 
given two additional doses of 420 mg of ibrutinib to continue to take at 8am 
exactly 24 hours apart for two more days, and return for Visit 3 for identical 
repeat testing as in Visits 1 and 2.  If four consecutive doses of 420 mg of 
ibrutinib given 24 hours apart is insufficient to cause >80% inhibition of the 
SPT and BAT response, subjects will be given three additional d oses of 420 
mg of ibrutinib to continue to take 24 hours apart for three more 
days, and return for Visit 4 for identical repeat testing as in 
Visits 1, 2 and 3, where based on preliminary data, we expect 
SPT and BAT to be suppressed.  Once both the SPT and  BAT 
responses are inhibited, no further ibrutinib doses will be given, 
and subjects will return on a weekly basis until both the peanut /tree nut  PST and BAT return to at least 
80% of baseline values.  At this point, Part 1 will have been completed.  At each visit, patients will be 
monitored for toxicities, including CBC, CMP, and pregnancy testing.   Prior to drug initiation and at the 
end of the trial, an E KG will be performed.  
 
Part 2: Visit 1  will be identical to those for Part 1 except that  subjects will take a higher dose of ibrutinib 
(560mg daily) for 2 days and a single -blind, placebo -controlled ( SBPC) graded food challenge of up to 8 
mg of peanut  or tree nut  protein, administered over  escalating doses , will be performed in a monitored at 
the study site in a clinical research unit (CRU) setting.  Prior to the SBPC  food challenge, 30 mL of 
peripheral blood will be collected for BAT, sIgE to peanut and components, as well as for total IgE, 
eosinophil a nd basophil enumeration.  During the challenge, subjects will be repeatedly assessed for 
signs and symptoms of food -induced anaphylaxis between each dose per food challenge protocol.  This 
visit will establish each subject’s baseline threshold dose for pea nut/tree nut  reactivity.    
 
Once a confirmed reaction occurs , the food challenge will be terminated and the reaction treated until it 
has resolved.  Within 15 minutes of a positive challenge, an additional 10 mL of blood will be drawn for 
mast cell microparticle analysis.  After a minimum of a two week recovery period, each subject will then 
begin taking ibrutinib 560 mg orally daily for 2 days, w hich is the minimum number of doses that Clinical protocol for part 1 (top) and part 2 
(bottom).  + or - = predicted response; ??? = 
question to be answered; * = if needed

3 demonstrate efficacy as determined in Part 1.  Two hours after the final dose, subjects will return to the 
study site  for Visit 2, and PST and SBPC  food challenges will be repeated to establish each subject’s 
new threshold dose for peanut /tree nut  reactivity  while on ibrutinib , and with repeat post -challenge blood 
collection for mast cell microparticle analysis.  At this point of the protocol, ibrutinib dosing will be 
stopped.  Follow up visits starti ng 3 months after cessation of ibrutinib will be conducted to repeat toxicity 
labs and skin testing .

1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Disease Background  
Food allergy is a potentially life threatening disease, and its prevalence continues to increase 
despite public health efforts  (1,2)  Newer studies have shown that it is less likely that a subject  will 
lose their food allergies over time and food allergies can also start in adulthood, so more adults 
now have life -threatening food allergies.  Near fatal and fatal reactions can occur of subject s with 
food allergies and can lead to devastating results  (3,4).  Furthermore, the economic burden of 
childhood food allergy is nearly $25 billi on per year, including 200,000 emergency department 
trips annually  (5).  Despite this significant disease burden, there are currently no approved 
therapies for food allergy.  Standard of care is constant vigilance in avoidance of allergen, and 
use of self -injected epinephrine after a reaction has occurred.  Therefore, there is a large unmet 
need for new therapeutics to prevent serious allergic disease including food allergy and 
anaphylaxis.  Newly FDA approved BTK inhibitors such as ibrutinib (as well as others under 
development  (6,7)) may be able to fill this void, and offer a therapy to these subject s.   
1.2 Study Drug Background and Associated Known Toxicitie s 
Ibrutinib is a once daily, oral, selective, irreversible small -molecule inhibitor of Bruton’s  tyrosine 
kinase (BTK),  a key component of B -cell receptor signaling  (8,9).  BTK is also essential for FcεRI 
signaling and triggering of mast cells and b asophils  (10){Iyer, 2011 #10272;Kuehn, 2008 
#10273;MacGlashan, 2011 #8797} .  It is currently FDA approved for the treatment of Mantle Cell 
Lymphoma  (MCL) , Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia  (CLL) and Wa ldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia  
(WM) . 
 
In subject s with recurrent B -cell lymphoma, >90% irreversible occupancy of the BTK active site in 
peripheral blood mononuclear ce lls was observed up to 24 hours after ibrutinib doses of >/= 2.5  
mg/kg/day.  Ibrutinib is absorbed with a median Tmax o f 1-2 hours.  It is metabolized by 
cytochrome P450 and CYP3A, and has a half -life of 4 -6 hours.  The majority (80%) is fecally 
excreted.  
 
The approved CLL and WM  dose (420 mg orally once daily) has been shown to inhibit allergy test 
responses in cancer subject s receiving this drug by 1 week of treatment  (the earliest time point 
examined) in preliminary data from our group .  The 560  mg dose (used for MCL) has similar side -
effect and toxicity profiles as the lower dose.  Initial data from Part 1 sug gests that the 420mg 
dose can at least partially (in some cases fully) inhibit skin test responses to peanut and tree nuts 
in allergic subjects  after just 2 doses , with minimal side effects and no observed toxicity thus far in 
subjects taking ibrutinib for  up to 7 days .  Therefore , we can justify using the higher dose of 560 
mg orally once daily for Part 2 to investigate whether this higher dose can further reduce skin test 
response s beyond what is seen with the lower dose.   
 
In human studies, ibrutinib is metabolized in the liver, and not significantly renally cleared.  In 
healthy volunteers, co -admi nistration with CYP3A inhibitors increased Cmax, and therefore the 
drug will not be concomitantly administered with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A.  Known 
toxicities in cancer subject s receiving ibrutinib chronically include bleeding events (5% of MCL 
subject s), infection (25% of MCL subject s), myelosuppression (41% of subject s), and renal 
toxicity has also been reported.  Ibrutinib is also pregnancy category D.  This underscores our 
goal of finding the fewest possible doses to achieve the anti -allergy effect we are seeking, which 
could be as few as just 2 doses.  
1.3 Rationale  
There are currently no treatments for food allergy. IgE uniquely arms mast cells and basophi ls via 
their surface expression of FcεRI in allergy.  Crosslinking of the receptor is known to activate a 
number of SRC -family kinases (e.g., LYN, SYK) required for receptor function. BTK is a key 
PROTOCOL                                                                                                                                                      Version: Aug 7, 2017

5 component of FcεRI signaling and triggering of mast cells a nd basophils.  Since signaling 
mediated by FcεRI aggregation is thought to require the activity of BTK  (8,9), MacGlashan et . al. 
(9) tested ibrutinib, formerly known as PCI -32765, for its ability to prevent activation of human 
basophils in vitro. For stimulation with anti -IgE, ibrutinib inhibited CD63, CD203c and CD11b 
upregulation, and release of histamine, LTC4 and IL -4 as well as th e cytosolic calcium response 
(IC90 of ≈50 nM).  Ibrutinib did not inhibit basophil activation by FMLP or C5a and did not inhibit 
IL-13 release induced by IL -3, suggesting that BTK is required for IgE -mediated activation of 
human basophils .  We propose to t est whether this pharmacology can be exploited in vivo  to 
prevent allergic reactions.  
 Peanut and tree nut allergies are among the most common adult food allergens, and can 
often be the most sever e.  Additionally, peanut  and tree nut allergies are  often life-long.  Young 
adults and adolescents have a higher rate of accidental exposure and mortality as a result of food 
allergies than younger children, so there is an unmet  need for therapies directed at food allergy, 
especially in this population.  Therefore, we have chosen peanut and tree nut allergies  in an effort 
to investigate a treatment that has the potential to benefit the most individuals with a potentially 
severe allergy.  
 
2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary Objective  
2.1.1  To determine if short term ad ministration  of ibrutinib to adults with peanut (or tree  
nut) allergy will safely change allergen challenge thresholds

situations, since the investigators and study team are English spe aking.  
3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 
3.2.1  Subject s who have been on immunomodulatory therapies or oral cortico steroids 
within 1 month prior to study participation  will be excluded , and those taking 
antihistamines must stop these drugs for one week prior to enrollment and  must 
refrain from taking antihistamines during the duration of the study so as not to 
interfere with SPT responses . 
 
3.2.2  Subject s with symptoms not consistent with type 1 food reactions (atopic 
dermatitis, eosinophilic esophagitis and any other  non-IgE-mediated food 
sensitivities ) will be excluded .

biologic composition to  ibrutinib . 
 
3.2.4  Uncontrolled inter -current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active 
infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac 
arrhythmia,  beta-blocker use  or psychiatric illness/social situations that would 
limit compliance with study requirements.  
 
3.2.5  Subject s must not be pregnant or nursing due to t he potential for congenital 
abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.  
 
3.2.6  Subjec ts on anticoagulants, anti -platelet therapy, or any other predisposition 
towards bleeding . 
 
3.2.7  Subjects with h istory of idiopathic urticaria, dermatographism, idiopathic or 
unexplained anaphylaxis , or anaphylaxis (to foods or otherwise) resulting in 
intubation, prolonged hypotension, or neurological sequelae  
3.3 Study Stopping Criteria  
The study will be stopped if >50% of patients cannot complete the protocol due to 
toxicities or adverse events.  Toxicities (section 4.2) and adverse events (section 7.0) are 
listed below. Monitoring is described in section 8.0.  
3.4 Recruitment  
Patients with a diagnosis of peanut or tree nut allergy by a board certified allergist -
immunologist will be identified as potential subjects from the allergy clinics at 
Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. The treating physician will ask 
potential subjec ts permission to be contacted by study personnel. Potential subjects will 
then be contacted by authorized study personnel and given time to review the study 
information and consider participation.  
 
4.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
4.1 Treatment Dosage and Administration  
 
For Part 1 of the study, we will determine the length of treatment (i.e., the number of daily 
doses) required to inhibit both basophil and food skin test responses.  Preliminary data 
demonstrates that 7 days of treatment will inhibit both basophil and mast cell 
responsiveness  to aeroallergens, but have not yet tested shor ter time points .  Prior 
studies in cancer subject s suggest that one dose is sufficient to completely inhibit BAT, 
but we propose a minimum of two doses to allow for diffusion and penetration of ibrutinib 
into the skin  compartment where our SPT is performed  to assess skin mast cell 
responsiveness.   For Part 1, 6 subject s will take ibrutinib 420  mg, by mouth once daily 
(every 24 hours) on an out patient  basis.  After two days, the subject  will undergo blood 
testing and SPT to assess  basophil and mast cell re activity.  If both tests are negative, 
Part 1 is completed.  If both tests are not negative, then the subject  will take 2 more days 
of ibrutinib (same dose , for a total of 4 doses ), and identical  testing will be  repeated. If 
testing is not negative at day 4, the subject  will take 3 more days of ibrutinib (same dose , 
for a total of 7 doses ), which is the maximum anticipated number of doses needed to 
suppress both the BAT and SPT .  
PROTOCOL                                                                                                                                                      Version: Aug 7, 2017  
_______________________________________________________________________ _ 
8  
For Part 2 of the study, 6 subject s will take ibrutinib  560 mg once daily by mouth  (every 
24 hours) for 2 days, which is  the minimum number of days required to cause ≥80% 
inhibition of food SPT and BAT responses as determined in part 1.  Part 2 will last a 
minimum of 3 days. 
 
Dose -limiting tox icity (DLT) includes any grade 3 or 4  hematologic toxicity, grade 3 
hepatotoxicity or increase in creatinine x  2.5 normal limit.  DLT will be monitored at each 
visit, at any time during treatment.   
 
Maximally tolerated dose (MTD) will occur at the point DLT occurs.  Ibrutinib is approved 
as a daily medi cation for another indication, and we propose to use the drug in adults 
only at its approved oral dosing of 420 or 560 mg daily for a minimum of two days and a 
maximum of 7 days .  Dose limiting events include grade 3 or 4 hematologic events, grade 
3 or 4 hepatotoxicity, AST or ALT >3 times normal range, creatinine > 2.5 times normal 
range.  DLT evaluation will be completed throughout the study, anytime during treatment.   
 
In healthy volunteers, co -administration with CYP3A inhibitors increased C max, and 
therefore the drug will not be concomitantly administered with strong or moderate 
inhibitors of CYP3A ( for example, “ azole ” medications and subject s will be advised 
against drinking grapefruit juice ). 
4.2 Toxicities and Dosing Delays  
Any subject  who receives treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity . Each 
subject  will be assessed for the development of toxicity according  to the Time and Events 
table ( Section 5.4 ).  
 
At each visit, subject s will be monitored for toxicities.  If a subject  develops a grade 3 or 4 
hematologic, renal, or hepatotoxicity, the medication will be stopped.  Toxicities with 
grades are listed below.

the normal limit will result in discontinuation of protocol therapy.   
 
Hepatotoxicity :  Grade 3 hepatotoxicity, or an increase in AST or ALT >3 times upper limit 
of normal will result in discontinuation in protocol therapy.  
4.3 Concomitant Medications/Treatments  
The following concomitant medications/treatments  are not allowed: immunomodulatory  
therapies,  oral cortico steroids within 1 month  of study participation ; those taking 
antihistamines must stop these drugs for one week prior to enrollment and must refrain 
from taking antihistamines during the duration of the study so as not to interfere with SPT 
responses; and  any other prior investigational interventions .   
4.4 Duration of Therapy  
Treatment will continue for a minimum of 2 days and a maximum of 7 days per Part 1 of 
the protocol.  Other reasons the medication may be discontinued include:  
 Inter-current illness that prevents further administration of treatment ; 
 Unacceptable adverse event(s) ; 
 Subject  decides to withdraw from the study ; or 
 General or specific changes in the subject ’s condition render the subject  
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
4.5 Duration of Follow Up  
Subject s will be followed until  SPT and  BAT return to baseline  in Part 1, and for up to 6 
months after cessation of ibrutinib treatment  in Part 2. Subject s removed from treatment  
for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or sta bilization of the 
adverse event .  
 
Subject s will be removed from therapy  when any of the criteria listed in Section 5.5 apply . 
The Principa l Investigator will be notified.  T he reason for study removal and the date the 
subject  was removed  will be documented  in the Case Report Form . The subject  will be 
followed -up per protocol .

5.3.1  Screening /Baseline  visit (Visit 1)  
  Screening:  
 Physical exam, vital signs  
 Urine Pregnancy test (if required)  
 CBC  
 CMP  
 Immunoglobulin  levels  
 EKG  
 Spirometry (only if the subject has a history of asthma)  
 
Procedures  (to be done only if labs and EKG are within normal limits)  
 Skin prick testing  
 Basophi l activation test  
 SBPC  oral food challenge as follows:  
 
All oral food challenges (OFC) shall be performed as single  (patient) -blind ed, placebo 
controlled food challenges according to standard published guidelines (11, 12).  
Placebo challenge and active challenge will be performed in that order on the same day 
if the subject has no symptoms during the first (placebo) challenge.  If a reaction 
requiring treatment occurs during the first challenge, the next challenge should not be 
performed until the symptoms  have subsided.  Oral food challenge to peanut or tree nut 
protein will be performed according to standard operating procedure.  At physician 
discretion, based upon history and possible subjective or very mild objective symptoms 
during a challenge, dosing intervals may be  extended . 
 
Actions to minimize risk of severe allergic reactions during oral food challenge (OFC):  
Prior to the OFC visit, subjects will be told to contact study staff about asthma and 
seasonal allergy symptoms, fever, acute infections inclu ding upper respiratory 
infections, rashes or change in status of chronic medical conditions.  OFCs will be 
rescheduled in the event that any of these occur. Study staff will contact subjects 1 -3 
days before the OFC to inquire about recent symptoms.  
 
All OF Cs will be conducted in the Clinical Research Unit within the main hospital.  
Intravenous access will be obtained before the OFC begins.  Emergency medications 
(epinephrine, diphenhydramine, cetirizine, albuterol, ranitidine) will be immediately 
accessible  in the subject’s room.  All OFCs will be conducted by trained personnel and 
supervised by a clinician with experience in performing OFCs and trained in the 
treatment of anaphylaxis.  Spirometry (assessment of pulmonary function) will be 
performed prior to  the onset of the OFC. Vital signs and pulse oximetry will be obtained 
at baseline and prior to each dose of the food allergen and q15 minutes thereafter with 
an observation period of at last 2 hours after the last dose is consumed (longer should a 
reactio n occur).  The OFC will begin with a low dose, which will increase incrementally.  
At physician discretion, based upon history and possible subjective or very mild 
objective symptoms during a challenge, dosing intervals may be extended .  The 
procedure will be stopped when clear objective symptoms are noted.  
 
Subjects will be discharged after a period of observation appropriate to the nature of the 
symptoms.  They will receive information regarding possible delayed manifestations 
and home trea tment.  All subjects will be provided with an epinephrine auto -injector to 
take home (if they do not have one already) and instructions on how and when to use it.

request, or they may be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for safety, 
behavioral or administrativ e reasons. The reason(s) for discontinuation will be 
documented and may include:  
5.5.1  Subject  voluntarily withdraws from treatment (follow -up permitted);   
5.5.2  Subject  withdraws consent (termination of treatment and follow -up); 
5.5.3  Subject  is unable to comply with protocol requirements;  
5.5.4  Subject  experiences toxicity that makes continuation in the protocol unsafe;  
5.5.5  Treating physician judges continuation on the study would not be in the subject ’s 
best interest;  
5.5.6  Subject  becomes pregnant (pregnancy to be reported along same timelines as a 
serious adverse event);  or 
5.5.7  Lost to follow -up. If a research subject ca nnot be located after a period of 2 
months , the subject may be considered “lost to follow -up.” All attempts to contact 
the subject during the 2 months  must be documented.  
6.0        RESPONSE CRITERIA  
6.1 Safety/tolerability  
Analyses will be performed for all subject s having received at least one dose of study 
drug. CBC, CMP, EKG will be performed on all subjects to monitor for toxicities and 
safety.  
6.2  Efficacy  
Increase in quantity of food that can be ingested on oral food challenge, decreased skin 
prick tests and decreased basophil activation will be used to assess efficacy of the 
treatment.

16 7.1.2 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use  
Prior studies of ibrutinib adverse events were performed on cancer patients who had 
often failed other treatments, and were treated chronically.  However, A dvani et . al. (13) 
reported side effects in a phase 1 study for only 28 days , the shortest duration of 
treatment that has been reported in the literature .  In that study, a total of 56 patients with 
a variety of relapsed B -cell malignancies were treated over seven dosage cohorts (1.25 - 
12 mg/kg/day) .  For the cohort receiving dosages closest to the one being used in our 
study (a total of 6 subjects given 5 mg/kg/da y, or 420 mg/day for an 81  kg person) the 
most common adverse events were typically grade 1 or 2 in severity.  Grade 3 or 4 
events were infrequent and independent of dose.  Data from this cohort of 6 subjects was 
extracted and reproduced from Table 3  of the Advani et. al. paper below.  For the entire 
cohort of 56 subjects, Grade 3 -4 hematologic toxicities included neutropenia (12.5%), 
thrombocytopenia (7.2%) and anemia (7.1%) .  According to the authors , no evidence of 
cumulative hemat ologic or non-hematologic toxicity was observed in patients with 
prolonged dosing , nor was any consistent relationship  seen  between dose level and 
adverse events .   
 
 
As the subjects  enrolled in this study  will be generally health y except for food allergy,  and 
on ibrutinib for a much shorter duration  (maximum of 7 days, perhaps as little as 2 days) , 
we expected adverse events to be milder and less frequent, if at all, compared  to prior 
studies of ibrutinib in cancer trials .  However, for completeness, adver se events as 
documented with chronic use are detailed below.  
7.1.2.1 Hemorrhage  
Five percent of patients with MCL had Grade 3 or higher bleeding events 
(subdural hematoma, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hematuria). Overall, bleeding 
events including bruis ing of any grade occurred in 48% of patients with MCL 
treated with 560 mg daily.  
The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood.  
7.1.2.2 Infections  
Fatal and non -fatal infections have occurred with ibrutinib  therapy. At least 25% 
of patients with MCL had infections Grade 3 or greater NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events CTCAE) (14). 
7.1.2.3 Myelosuppression  
Treatment -emergent Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias  were reported in 41% of patients. 
These included neutropenia (29%), thrombocytopenia (17%) and anemia (9%). 
Monitor complete blood counts monthly.  
7.1.2.4 Renal Toxicity  
Fatal and serious cases of renal failure have occurred with ibrutinib  therapy. 
Treatm ent- emergent increases in creatinine levels up to 1.5 times the upper limit 
of normal occurred in 67% of patients and from 1.5 to 3 times the upper limit of 
normal in 9% of patients. Periodically monitor creatinine levels. Maintain 
hydration.  

PROTOCOL                                                                                                                                                      Version: Aug 7, 2017

17 7.1.2.5 Embr yo-Fetal Toxicity  
Based on findings in animals, ibrutinib  can cause fetal harm when administered 
to a pregnant woman. Ibrutinib caused malformations in rats at exposures 14 
times those reported in patients with MCL receiving the ibrutinib dose of 560 mg 
per day. Reduced fetal weights were observed at lower exposures. Advise 
women to avoid becoming pregnant while taking ibrutinib . If this drug is used 
during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the 
patient should be apprised o f the potential hazard to a fetus.  
7.1.3  Interaction with other medications  
As stated, metabolism o f ibrutinib is inhibited by CYP3A  inhibitors.  Patients on 
these medications will be excluded.  
7.1.4  Adverse Reactions  
As per package insert  (15), adverse reactions are listed in Section 7.1.2 . Of note, 
patients in the trial references took a larger dose and for much longer duration 
that we propose in this study.  
The most commonly occurring adverse reactions ( approx. 20%) were 
thrombocytopenia, di arrhea, neutropenia, anemia, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, 
peripheral edema, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, bruising, dyspnea, 
constipation, rash, abdominal pain, vomiting and decreased appetite.  
The most common Grade 3 or 4 non -hematological adverse reactions ( approx. 
5%) were pneumonia, abdominal pain, atrial fibrillation, diarrhea, fatigue, and 
skin infections.  
Adverse reactions from the MCL trial (N=111) using single agent IMBRUVICA 
560 mg daily occurring at a rate of approx.  10%.  
Ten patie nts (9%) discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions in the trial 
(N=111). The most frequent adverse reaction leading to treatment 
discontinuation was subdural hematoma (1.8%). Adverse reactions leading to 
dose reduction occurred in 14% of patients.  
Patients with MCL who develop lymphocytosis greater than 400,000/mcL have 
developed intracranial hemorrhage, lethargy, gait instability, and headache. 
However, some of these cases were in the setting of disease progression.  
Forty percent of patients had elev ated uric acid levels on study including 13% 
with values above 10 mg/dL. Adverse reaction of hyperuricemia was reported for 
15% of patients.   
8.0 ADVERSE EVENT MONITORING  
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are 
done to ensure the safety o f Subjects enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in 
future studies using similar agents . Adverse events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled 
times during a trial . Additionally, cert ain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner 
to allow for opt imal monitoring of subject  safety and care .  
 
All subject s experiencing an adverse event, regardless of its relationship  to study drug /device , will 
be monitored until:  
 the adverse event resolves or the symptoms or signs that constitute the adverse event 
PROTOCOL                                                                                                                                                      Version: Aug 7, 2017

 any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline;  
 there is a satisfactory explanation other than the study drug for the changes observed; or  
 death.  
8.1 Definitions  
8.1.1  Definition of Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward m edical occurrence in a subject  receiving 
study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an experimental intervention, whether or not related to 
the intervention.  
8.1.2  Severity of Adverse Events  
The severity of an AE is graded as follows:  
 
Mild (grade 1):  the event causes discomfort without disruption of no rmal daily 
activities.  
 
Moderate (grade 2):  the event causes discomfort that affects normal daily 
activities.  
 
Severe (grade 3):  the event makes the subject  unable to perform normal daily 
activities or significantly affects his/her clinical status.  
 
Life-threatening (grade 4):  the subject  was at risk of death at the time of the 
event.  
 
Fatal (grade 5):  the event caused death.  
8.1.3  Serious Adverse Events  
A “serious” adverse event is defined in regulatory terminology as any untoward 
medical occurrence that:  
8.1.3.1       Results  in death.  
If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease  should 
be reported as event (SAE) itself.  
8.1.3.2       Is life -threatening.  
(the subject  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event that hypotheti cally might have caused death if it were 
more severe).  
PROTOCOL                                                                                                                                                      Version: Aug 7, 2017  
_______________________________________________________________________ _ 
19 8.1.3.3        Requires in -subject  hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization  for ≥ 24 hours . 
8.1.3.4        Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
8.1.3.5        Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
8.1.3.6        Is an important medical event . 
 
Any event that does not meet the above criteria, but that in the judgment of the 
investigator jeopardizes the subject , may be considered for reporting as a serious 
adverse event . The event may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in the definition of “Serious Adverse Event“. For 
example: allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home; convulsions that may not result in hospitalization; development 
of drug abuse or drug d ependency.  
8.2 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event Requires Expedited Reporting  
Step 1 : Identify t he type of adverse event . 
 
Step 2 : Grade the adverse event . 
 
Step 3 : Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy  
Attribution categories are as follows:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be  related  to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
Note : This includes all events that occur within 30 days of the last dose of protocol 
treatment . Any event that occurs more than 30 days after the last dose of treatment and 
is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) must also be reported 
accordingly.  
 
Step 4 :  Determine the prior experience of the adverse event .  
Expected events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from 
administration of the agent . An adverse event is considered unexpected, for expedited 
reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity of the event is not 
listed in:  
 the current known adverse events listed in the Agent Information Section of this 
protocol;  
 the drug package insert;  
 the current Investigator’s Brochure  
8.3 Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events  
8.3.1  Expedited Reporting  
 The Principal Investigator must be notified within 24 hours of learning of any 
seriou s adverse events, regardless of attribution, occurring during the study 
or within 30 days of the last administration of the study drug .  
 The Northwestern University IRB  must be notified within 5 business days of 
any unanticipated problems involving ri sk to  subjects or others ( UPIRSO ). 
The following events meet the definition of UP IRSO: 
PROTOCOL                                                                                                                                                      Version: Aug 7, 2017  
_______________________________________________________________________ _ 
20 1. Any serious event (injuries, side effects, deaths or other problems), 
which in the opinion of the Principal Investigator was unanticipated, 
involved risk to subjects or others, and was possibly related to the 
research procedures.  
2. Any serious accidental or unintentional change to the IRB -approved 
protocol that alters the level of risk.  
3. Any deviation from the protocol taken without prior IRB review to 
eliminate apparent imm ediate hazard to a research subject.  
4. Any new information (e.g., publication, safety monitoring report, updated 
sponsor safety report), interim result or other finding that indicates an 
unexpected change to the risk/benefit ratio for the research.  
5. Any breac h in confidentiality that may involve risk to the subject or 
others.  
6. Any complaint of a subject that indicates an unanticipated risk or that 
cannot be resolved by the Principal Investigator.  
7. The FDA should be notified within 7 business days of any unexpect ed 
fatal or life -threatening adverse event with possible relationship to study 
drug, and 15 business days of any event that is considered: 1) serious, 
2) unexpected, and 3) at least possibly related to study participation.  
8.3.2     Routine Reporting  
All other adverse events - such as those that are expected, or are unlikely or 
definitely not related to the study participation - are to be reported annually as part 
of regular data submission.  
8.3.3 Stopping Rules  
The study will be stopped if >50% of patients  cannot complete the protocol due to 
toxicities or adverse events.    
 
9.0 DRUG INFORMATION  
9.1 Ibrutinib 140  mg tablets  
 Other names for the drug(s) /device : Imbruvica®  
 Classification - type of agent /device : small molecule BTK inhibitor  
 
Mode of action:  Ibrutinib forms a covalent bond with a cysteine residue in the BTK active 
site, leading to inhibition of BTK enzymatic activity.  BTK is a signaling molecule of the B -
cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. BTK’s role in signaling 
through the B -cell surface receptors results in activation of pathways necessary for B -cell 
trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion. Nonclinical studies show that ibrutinib inhibits 
malignant B -cell proliferation and survival in vivo as well as cell migration an d substrate 
adhesion in vitro.  
 Storage and stability:   Ibrutinib is stored at room temperature and the tablets are 
stable.  
 Protocol dose: 420 or 560 mg once daily for 2 -7 days  
 Preparation:  as supplied from the manufacturer  
 Route of administration for thi s study:  By mouth  
 Incompatibilities:  N/A 
PROTOCOL                                                                                                                                                      Version: Aug 7, 2017  
_______________________________________________________________________ _ 
21  Availability : commercially available by prescription.  Medication will be paid for 
through NIH funding, and provided free of charge to subjects.  
 Side effects: Most common side effects are diarrhea, nausea, fatigue and 
musculoskeletal pain.  Other side effects include myelosuppression, bleeding and 
hepatoxicity.  Please refer to package insert for comprehensive list of side effects.  
 Nursing implications:   Ibruti nib is category D.  It should not be  used in nursing 
mothers.   
 9.2       Return and Retention of Study Drug  
Study d rug will obtained by the research pharmacy at Northwestern Feinberg School of 
Medicine by prescription only.  Study drug will disp ensed as needed, until next follow up.  
Therefore, we do not anticipate retention of study drug.  However, if there is unused 
study drug, it will be disposed of in an appropriate manner.  
 
9.2.1  Compliance will be assess ed by subject diary and self -report.   
 
10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Descriptive statistics will be completed to determine an 80% reduction in skin prick wheal size 
and basophil activation test reactivity (as determined by % inhibition of anti -IgE-induced  CD63 
expression) .  As this is an open label study, each patient’s  responsiveness will be examined 
compared to themselves prior to initiation of treatment.  
10.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints  
This is an open label study of ibrutnib in  12 food allergic adults to  determine the shortest 
amount of time and fewest ibrutinib doses required to eliminate food SPT and BAT 
reactivity and to evaluate the effect of pretreatment with ibrutinib on food allergen 
reactivity in food allergic subjects give n ibrutinib 420  or 560 mg daily for 2 -7 doses .  
Given the nature  of the study, it will be stopped if >50% of patients have a DLT at target 
enrollment .  
10.2 Sample Size and Accrual  
12 subjects allows 80% power to detect a reduction in skin test positivity rate from 100% 
before treatment to 15% after treatment using a one -sided 0.05 level McNemar’s test.   
Patients will be recruited from the allergy clinics at Northwestern University Feinberg 
School of Medicine with a diagnosis of peanut (or tree  nut) allergy by a board certified 
allergist -immunologist.  
 
10.3 Data Analyses Plans  
As this is an open label trial, descriptive statistics will be used.  Each patient will be 
compared to him/h erself prior to beginning treatment and at each time point in the study 
to assess SPT size (parts 1 and 2), BAT response (parts 1 and 2), and OFC threshold 
and response (part 2).   
11.0 STUDY MANAGEMENT  
11.1 Conflict of Interest  
Any investigator who has a conflict of interest with this study (patent ownership, royalties, 
or financial gain greater than the minimum allowable by their institution, etc.) must have 
the conflict reviewed by  Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine.   All investigators  will 
follow the University conflict of interest policy . 
PROTOCOL                                                                                                                                                      Version: Aug 7, 2017  
_______________________________________________________________________ _ 
22  11.2 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval and Consent   
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in accordance 
with federally mandated regulations . The IRB should approve the consent form and 
protocol.  
 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the 
applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
and to ethica l principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
  
Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the subject  will be given a full 
explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. 
Each consent fo rm must include all the relevant elements currently required by the FDA 
Regulations and local or state regulations. Once this essential information has been 
provided to the subject  and the investigator is assured that the subject  understands the 
implicatio ns of participating in the study, the subject  will be asked to  give consent to 
participate i n the study by signing an IRB -approved consent form.  
 
Prior to a subject ’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form should be 
signed and personally dated by the subject  and by the person who conducted the 
informed consent discussion.  
11.3 Data Management and Monitoring /Auditing  
As has been done previously for the phase 1 study of ibrutinib  (13), adverse events will 
be monitored throughout treatment and toxicities will be assessed using the National 
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for AEs, with its latest version, currently 
version 4.03.   
11.4 Adherence to the Protocol  
Except for an eme rgency situation in which proper care for the protection, safety, and 
well-being of the study subject  requires alternative treatment, the study shall be 
conducted exactly as described in the a pproved protocol .  
11.4.1 Emergency Modifications  
Investigators may implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to 
eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to trial subjects without prior IRB approval .  
 
For any such emergency modification implemented, a IRB modification form 
must be completed within  five (5) business days  of making the change .  
11.4.2 Other Protocol Deviations/Violations  
All other planned deviations from the protocol must have prior approval by the  
Principal Investigator and the IRB . According to the IRB, a protocol deviation  is 
any unplanned variance from an IRB approved protocol that:  
 Is generally noted or recognized after it occurs  
 Has no substantive effect on the risks to research participants  
 Has no substantive effect on the scientific integrity of the research plan or t he 
value of the data collected  
 Did not result from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the 
investigator(s).  
 
An unplanned protocol variance is considered a violation  if the variance:  
 Has harmed or increased the risk of harm to one or more resear ch 
participants.  
PROTOCOL                                                                                                                                                      Version: Aug 7, 2017

23  Has damaged the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study.  
 Results from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the investigator(s).  
 Demonstrates serious or continuing noncompliance with federal regulations, 
State laws,  or University policies.  
 
If a deviation or violation occurs without prior approval from the Principal 
Investigator, please follow the guidelines below:  
 
Protocol Deviations: Deviations should be summarized and reported to the IRB  
at the time of continuing  review.  
 
Protocol Violations: Study personnel should report violations  within two (2)  
week of the investigator becoming aware of the event using the same IRB online 
mechanism used to report Unanticipated Problems .  
11.5 Amendments to the Protocol  
Should amendments to the protocol be required, the amendments will be originated and 
documented by t he Principal Investigator . It should also be noted that when an 
amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design or the potential risk to the 
subject , a revised consent fo rm might be required .  
 
The written amendment, and if required the amended consent form, must be sent to the 
IRB for approval prior to implementation .  
11.6  Confidentiality  
The specimens will be coded and data will be stored in the Allergy -Immunology Research 
Labs, Mezzanine, McGaw Pavilion, or in locked file cabinets and/or on password 
protected computers.  Only the study personnel will have access to the specimens and 
data generated.  The PI and the study team members will be responsible for receipt or 
transmission of the data and specimens. The specimens will be maintained until 
exhausted or until the study ends.  If there are remaining samples at the end of the study, 
any identifying information will be removed from the sample vial and the specimens will 
be treated with 10% bleach and discarded.  Unused portions of the specimens may be 
shared with other members of the University community.  The original data will remain 
with the PI in the Allergy Division.  No PHI will be shared.  
11.7 Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
Certain other people besides the PI and his research team may review the results of the 
study, such as administrative staff members from  the Office of Research, Office of 
Research Integrity and members of the Institutional Review Board, and members of the 
Office for Human Research Protections.  There is a slight risk that a subject’s privacy 
might be at risk.  All of the above mentioned pe ople in the respective capacities are 
obligated to protect a subject’s privacy and have training and certification in the 
safeguarding of the patient’s privacy.  All data and results will be maintained in the 
Allergy -Immunology Research Labs, Mezzanine, Mc Gaw Pavilion, in locked file cabinets 
and/or on password protected computers.  
  
To help the subjects feel at ease, these safeguards are outlined in the consent form.  
  
As far as information in medical records, only licensed medical personnel would have 
permission to access the information.  
PROTOCOL                                                                                                                                                      Version: Aug 7, 2017

24  11.8 Record Retention  
Study documentation includes all Case Report Forms, data correction forms or queries, 
source documents, Sponsor -Investigator correspondence, monitoring logs/letters, and 
regulatory documents (e.g., protocol and amendments, IRB correspondence and 
approval, signed subject  consent forms).  
 
Source documents include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical activities 
and all reports and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical 
research study.  
 
Government agency regulations and directives require that the study investigator must 
retain all study documentation pertaining to the conduct of a clinical trial . In the case of a 
study with a drug seeking regulatory approval and marketing, these document s shall be 
retained for at least two years after the last approval of marketing application in an 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) region . In all other cases, study 
documents should be kept on file until three years after the completion and final study 
report of this investigational study.  
11.9 Obligations of Investigators  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for the conduct of the clinical trial at the site in 
accordance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations and/or the Declar ation of 
Helsinki . The Principal Investigator is responsible for personally overseeing the treatment 
of all study subject s. The Principal Investigator must assure that all study site personnel, 
including sub -investigators and other study staff members, adhere to the study protocol 
and all FDA/GCP/NCI regulations and guidelines regarding clinical trials both during and 
after stu dy completion.  
 
The Principal Investigator at each institution or site will be responsible for assuring that all 
the required data will be collected and entered onto the Case Report Forms. P eriodically, 
monitoring visits will be conducted and the Principal  Investigator will provide access to 
his/her original records to permit verification of proper entry of data. At the completion of 
the study, all case report forms will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator and will 
require his/her final signature to v erify the accuracy of the data.

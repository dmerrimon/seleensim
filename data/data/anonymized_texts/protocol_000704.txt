 ABSTRACT  
 
Relapsed neuroblastoma is incurable in the majority of cases. One of the most effective therapies utilized 
when patients have refractory or relapsed disease is 131I-Metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG). Previous 
studies have proven that it is safe to combin e 131I-MIBG with putative  radiation sensitizers, and an ongoing 
clinical trial seeks to determine if MIBG in combination with these agents is more efficacious than giving 
MIBG alone. Dinutuximab, a chimeric 14.18 monoclonal antibody that targets the tumor cell surface marker 
glyco sphingolipid  GD2 ganglioside (GD2) , has significantly improved the event -free survival for patients 
with high -risk neuroblastoma when given as part of upfront therapy. A recent study performed by the 
Children’s Oncology Group (COG) has demonstrated that dinutuximab can be safely given with  cytotoxic 
chemotherapy, and unlike previous studies with dinutuximab as a single agent, can produce responses 
even in patients with bulky disease. Data from pre -clinical and adult studies suggest that radiation can 
enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy an d targeted therapies such as dinutuximab. We propose a phase 
I, dose -escalation study of 131I-MIBG given in combination with dinutuximab  (Part A) . The primary objective 
of this part of the study is to define the recommended phase 2 dose  (RP2D)  of 131I-MIBG  and dinutuximab 
when given in combination, and to define and describe the toxicities.  In Part B , we will add vorinostat to the 
131I-MIBG and dinutuximab combination , at the RP2D determined in Part A . The rationale for this is based 
on pre -clinical data de monstrating that vorinostat increases GD2 cell surface expression in neuroblastoma 
cells, leading  to increased anti -tumor activity  when combined with anti -GD2 antibody  in murine models of 
neuroblastoma , and clinical data from NANT 11 -01 demonstrating that the addition of vorinostat to 
therapeutic 131I-MIBG produces  a higher objective response rate compared to 131I-MIBG alone.  The primary 
objective of Part B  is to define the RP2D  of vorinostat in combination with 131I-MIBG and dinutuximab, and 
to define and describe the toxicities  of this combination .

 2.0 BACKGROUND  
 
2.1  Neuroblastoma   
Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood. While it comprises only 8% of all 
childhood cancer cases, neuroblastoma is responsible for 12% of cancer deaths in children under 15 years 
of age (1,2). Approximately 50%  of neuroblastoma patients are classified as high -risk, and over half of 
these children will die from their disease despite intensive multi -modal therapy (3,4). The prognosis is even 
more grim for patients whose disease is refractory to initial therapy or who experience a recurrence of their 
tumor during or after completion of therapy, as the vast majority of these patients cannot be cured (5,6).  
 
2.2 Clinical Experience with 131I -MIBG for Neuroblastoma  
Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is a norepinephrine an alog that is selectively taken up by sympathetic 
nervous system tissue through the cell surface norepinephrine transporter (7). Approximately 90% of 
neuroblastoma tumors accumulate MIBG, making this a potential therapeutic target (8,9). MIBG labeled 
with i odine -123 (123I-MIBG) has become a key component of the diagnostic, staging, and response 
evaluation in neuroblastoma. MIBG labeled with iodine -131 (131I-MIBG) can be used as a systemic, targeted 
radiotherapy and has demonstrated activity in both relapsed/ refractory and newly diagnosed patients (10 -
15). In a single -agent phase I dose -escalation study, 131I-MIBG showed a response rate of 37% in children 
with relapsed disease, with 10 mCi/kg being the minimum dose at which responses were seen (16). A 
phase II  study at the recommended phase II dose of 18 mCi/kg, showed a 36% response rate with another 
34% of patients with stable disease (17). The primary toxicity of 131I-MIBG is myelosuppression, particularly 
thrombocytopenia, and about one -third to one -half of  patients will require autologous hematopoietic stem -
cell transplantation (AHSCT) (16 -18). Because of this, it is now standard practice to prophylactically perform 
an AHSCT in the majority of patients approximately 2 weeks after MIBG infusion. Non-hematolo gic toxicity 
is rare, with grade 3 or 4 hepatic toxicity in 5%, pulmonary toxicity in 3.6%, infectious toxicity in 10.9%, and 
febrile neutropenia in 9.7% (17).  
 
2.3 Clinical Experience with 131I-MIBG in Combination with Other Agents for Neuroblastoma  
Several clinical trials have sought to improve upon the success of single agent 131I-MIBG by combining it 
with other chemotherapeutic agents. The New Approaches to Neuroblastoma Therapy (NANT) consortium 
conducted a phase I study of 131I-MIBG  in combination with vincristine and irinotecan. This combination 
was well -tolerated at a maximum 131I-MIBG dose of 18 mCi/kg. Dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) included 
grade 3 diarrhea (dose level 15 mCi/kg), grade 3 ALT elevation (dose level 18 mCi/kg), a nd grade 3 
hallucination (dose level 18 mCi/kg). There were no unexpected hematologic toxicities and the objective 
response rate was 25% (19). A subsequent pilot study showed that by giving the irinotecan over one week 
instead of two that you could reduce the amount of grade 3 or 4 diarrhea without compromising the efficacy 
(20). A second phase I study conducted by NANT tested 131I-MIBG in combination with vorinostat. The 
recommended phase II doses were 131I-MIBG 18 mCi/kg and vorinostat 180 mg/m2/day. At t his dose level, 
0 of 5 patients had a DLT and the objective response rate was 17% (21). These two trials have proven that 
131I-MIBG can be safely given with other systemic anti -cancer agents, with toxicities limited to those specific 
to the known side effe cts of the concomitant chemotherapy. A phase II trial comparing these two regimens 
to single -agent 131I-MIBG is ongoing.  
 
2.4 Clinical Experience with Dinutuximab for Neuroblastoma  
Dinutuximab is a chimeric (ch) 14.18 monoclonal antibody that targets the disialoganglioside GD2. While 
GD2 is nearly ubiquitously expressed on neuroblastoma cells, its expression on human tissues is limited to 
peripheral neurons, melanocytes, and peripher al pain fibers, making it an ideal therapeutic target (22 -24). 
Phase I and II clinical trials of ch 14.18 both alone and in combination with cytokines such as GM -CSF 
and/or interleukin -2 (IL2) have demonstrated signals of efficacy against neuroblastoma (25 -28). This led to 
a randomized phase III trial performed by the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) comparing dinutuximab 
combined with GM -CSF, IL2, and isotretinoin to isotretinoin alone as post -consolidation therapy. This trial 
was stopped early because the event -free survival (EFS) for patients treated with dinutuximab was 
significantly better than for patients treated with isotretinoin alone (66% vs. 46%; P = 0.01) (29). Very few 
patients with bulk disease achieved an objective response, a finding that has been supported by other 
studies (29,30). Despite this, dinutuximab is now considered part of the standard upfront therapy for patients 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   15 
 with high -risk neuroblastoma. While this immunotherapy has proven to be effective, it has a significant side 
effect profi le, especially when given with IL2; however, these toxicities are typically manageable. Common 
grade 3 or 4 toxicities include neuropathic pain (52%), hypotension (18%), fever (39%), acute capillary leak 
(23%), hypersensitivity reactions (25%), infection ( 39%), hyponatremia (23%), hypokalemia (35%), and 
ALT elevation (23%) (29).  
 
2.5 Pre-clinical and Clinical Experience with Dinutuximab in Combination with Chemotherapy 
for Neuroblastoma  
Preclinical studies suggest that anti -GD2 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) can augment the effects of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. In a small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell line, the combination of cisplatin and anti -GD2 mAb 
resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity, at least in part due to the anti -GD2 mAb inducing direct apoptosis of the 
SCLC  cells (31). In a second study with a neuroblastoma cell line (IMR -32), the addition of the anti -GD2 
14G2a antibody resulted in additive effects on cell killing when combined with carboplatin and synergistic 
effects when combined with doxorubicin and topot ecan (32).  
 
A recent phase II trial conducted by the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) randomized patients to receive 
either dinutuximab or temsirolimus with chemotherapy (irinotecan and temozolomide) for the treatment of 
high-risk neuroblastoma patients wit h primary refractory disease and those in first relapse. Among the 17 
patients randomized to the dinutuximab arm, 9 (53%) had an objective response (partial response = 4, 
complete response = 5), which included 3 patients with bulky disease and 3 patients w ith prior anti -GD2 
exposure (33). This 53% objective response rate (ORR) was remarkably better than the 15% ORR seen 
with irinotecan/temodar alone (34). No unanticipated toxicity was experienced in patients treated on the 
dinutuximab arm, and this stratum was determined to be the optimal combination for further study (33).  
 
A study being conducted by St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital is testing the safety and efficacy of 
giving their anti -GD2 antibody, hu14.18K332A, to all newly diagnosed high -risk neur oblastoma patients 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Preliminary data from an interim analysis show that the response rate on this study after 
two cycles of anti -GD2 antibody plus topotecan/cyclophosphamide is 80%, and that the regimen -related 
toxicity was tolerable (35). Th is response rate is notably better than the 40% response rate seen in a 
previous study that gave topotecan/cyclophosphamide alone (36).  
 
These two studies combining an anti -GD2 antibody with cytotoxic therapy suggests that this approach is 
safe and may pr oduce better response rates than either of the agents given alone.  
 
2.6 Rationale for Combining Dinutuximab with Radiation Therapy  
Additional data combining dinutuximab with other therapies are limited, however preclinical and clinical 
studies in adult maligna ncies have shown that the effects of immunotherapy can be augmented if patients 
are first exposed to radiation (37 -41). This is supported by the clinical phenomenon known as the abscopal 
effect where tumor regression occurs at sites distant to the irradiat ed field through radiation -induced, 
immune -mediated anti -tumor mechanisms. Data ha ve shown that this occurs through the release of pro -
inflammatory cytokines and enhanced expression of tumor -associated antigens, death receptors, and co -
stimulatory molecule s on tumors cells exposed to radiation which increases their recognition and killing by 
T cells (42 -47). Given antibody -based therapies rely on antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), 
radiation, by promoting systemic activation of the immune syste m, creates the optimal environment to 
augment immunotherapy anti -tumor response.  
 
In adult clinical trials across a variety of malignancies, clinical responses have been seen when radiation 
therapy has been combined with several different types of immunot herapy including dendritic cell (DC) 
vaccines, immune checkpoint blockade, cytokines and other immunoadjuvants (48 -55). In a case reported 
by Hiniker et al., a patient with metastatic melanoma had complete regression of all metastatic lesions when 
treated with ipilimumab and concurrent radiation (54 Gy in three fractions)(56). Grimaldi et al. reported 21 
patients with melanoma who had progressed on immune checkpoint blockade, and 11 (52%) of these 
subsequently demonstrated an abscopal response when treated with radiation (51). In a phase I  trial, 
intratumoral injections of autologous DCs were given to patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma 
2 days after a single fraction of radiotherapy (52). A  partial response was reported in 2/14 patients. In a 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   16 
 different study where DCs were injected into sarcomas during fractionated radiotherapy given as 
neoadjuvant treatment, 12 of 17 patients were free from progression of their cancer at 1 year (57). This 
preliminary data and data from multiple other studies have  served as the background for scores of ongoing 
clinical trials testing the radiation plus immunotherapy approach (58).  
 
These pre -clinical and clinical data provide rationale for combining a systemic radiation therapy such as 
131I-MIBG with the immunotherapy dinutuximab. In an effort to take advantage of the systemic, radiation -
induced, inflammatory -mediated, anti -tumor effect (abscopal effect) potentially produced by the 131I-MIBG, 
we will administer the 131I-MIBG prior to the di nutuximab. This sequence will allow us to administer the 
dinutuximab at a time when the immune system is already activated and primed to augment the anti -tumor 
effects produced by the immunotherapy dinutuximab.  
 
2.7 Summary and Rationale for Clinical Use of 131I-MIBG with Dinutuximab  
Relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma is incurable in the majority of cases, underscoring the critical need for 
novel therapeutic approaches. 131I-MIBG, a targeted, systemic radiotherapy, is the most effective salvage 
therapy availabl e for this population of patients, and recent data suggests it can be safely combined with 
chemotherapy. Dinutuximab, an anti -GD2 monoclonal antibody, has significantly improved the outcomes 
for patients with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma. Dinutuximab, whe n given in combination with 
chemotherapy, can be administered safely and produce s promising response rates against even bulky 
relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma. Lastly, radiation therapy induces systemic, anti -tumor immune 
responses to augment the effects of immunotherapy. We therefore propose a phase I trial testing 131I-MIBG 
with dinutuximab for patients with relapse d/refractory neuroblastoma. In order to maximize the systemic, 
immune -mediated, anti -tumor effects of this combination and determine the opti mal dosing to produce this 
synergy, we will administer the standard dose of dinutuximab (17.5 mg/m2/dose) to all patients while 
escalating the 131I-MIBG.  
 
2.8 Correlative and Biology Studies  
 
2.8.1   Characterization of Immune and Cytokine Profile Following 131I-MIBG Therapy  
Dinutuximab works by binding to cell surface GD2 and inducing cell lysis. This occurs via antibody -
dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated mainly by natural killer (NK ) cells, neutrophils, and 
monocytes, and to a lesser degree by complement -dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) (29,59 -62). Immune -
activating cytokines augment the ADCC by increasing the number of granulocytes and macrophages (GM -
CSF), as well as NK cells and antig en-specific T cells (IL -2) (59,61).  
 
131I-MIBG is a myelo suppressive  therapy that requires autologous  stem cell rescue in up to 50% of patients 
(16-18). The median time to platelet nadir post 131I-MIBG is 24 days (range: 8 -47) and median time to 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) nadir is 42 days (range: 10 -68) (63). While 131I-MIBG causes neutropenia 
in the majority of cases, it is unclear what impact 131I-MIBG has on the other effector cells of the immune 
system and the cytokines they produce, or what impac t this has on the patient’s ability to activate ADCC. 
We will collect blood at baseline and at serial time points to evaluate the number and function of the effector 
cells involved with ADCC, as well as the pro -inflammatory cytokines that may augment the e ffects of 
immunotherapy and stimulate an immune -mediated anti -tumor response.  
 
 2.8.2 Descriptive Profile of Human Anti -Chimeric Antibody (HACA) and Neutralizing Anti -Drug Antibody 
(ADA)  
Due to the chimeric nature of dinutuximab, some patients will develop  HACA as part of their immune 
response. Studies performed in neuroblastoma patients have shown that the development of HACA does 
not occur in a significant number of patients, and the development of neutralizing ADA occurs rarely. 
However, a recent pharmac okinetic study of ch14.18 antibody suggested that while non -neutralizing 
antibodies may not have a biologic effect, they can still form immune complexes that are removed by the 
reticuloendothelial system leading to increased clearance of the drug ( 64). Als o, the clinical impact of ADA 
may be dependent on the titer of the antibody ( 64). There are no data describing the effect of 131I-MIBG on 
the development of HACA or neutralizing ADA. We will describe the HACA and ADA profile in patients post -
131I-MIBG therapy and during treatment with dinutuximab, and correlate this with anti -tumor response.  
 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   17 
 2.8.3 Five Gene NB-5 Assay by TLDA for Neuroblastoma Tumor Cell Detection  
Dr. Robert Seeger’s laboratory developed the NB -5 assay, a five gene TLDA array for sensi tive detection 
of neuroblastoma tumor cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow. Five genes [chromogranin A (CHGA), 
doublecortin (DCX), dopadecarboxylase (DDC), paired -like homeobox 2B (PHOX2B), and tyrosine 
hydroxylase (TH)] are highly expressed by neurob lastoma cell lines and tumors. These same genes are 
rarely expressed by normal blood cells, peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC), and bone marrow. Four 
housekeeping genes are used for quality control and data analysis. Heterogeneity in expression of the 
detection genes among neuroblastoma cell lines (n=22) and primary untreated stage 4 neuroblastoma 
tumors (n=23) is minimal. However, the use of five genes assures that heterogeneity will not impact tumor 
cell detection.  
 
Spiking experiments demonstrate the sensitivity of neuroblastoma cell detection using this 5 -gene 
signature. Detection sensitivity with five genes (including TH) is superior to that of a single gene (TH). The 
five-gene detector has nearly 100% sensitivity to detect neuroblastoma RNA at a dose of 10 -5, whereas 
the TH -only detector has sensitivity of <60%. In terms of neuroblastoma cell detection, the 5 -gene signature 
can detect a 10 -6 neuroblastoma cell frequency in PBMC with 81% probability compared to <30%  for a TH -
alone detector.  
 
NB-5 Detection Gene Score (DG score) is highly correlated with Immunocytology Score (number of tumor 
cells/106 total cells) when Immunocytology is positive in bone marrow. Forty -four unselected fresh bone 
marrow specimens were tested by both assays. The rank correlation between the TLDA DG Score and 
Immunocytology Score was r = -.93 (p < 0.001), which demonstrates  a clear relationship between the two 
assays. The NB-5 assay also can detect tumor cells in bone marrow that are not detected by 
Immunocytology. Thirty -six of the 44 bone marrows were negative by Immunocytology, but 20 of these 
were positive by NB-5. These  data further confirm that the NB-5 assay is more sensitive than 
Immunocytology for detecting tumor cells. Moreover, detection of occult bone marrow tumor cells by NB-5 
appears to have clinical relevance. In patients with newly diagnosed high -risk neurobla stoma, detection of 
tumor cells by TLDA in a bone marrow sample negative by Immunocytology at the end of therapy was 
associated with significantly worse event -free survival than bone marrow samples negative for tumor cells 
by TLDA assay.  
In the NANT biolo gy study , mRNA for CHGA, DCX, DDC, PHOX2B, and TH was quantified in BM and blood 
from 101 patients concurrently with clinical disease evaluations  (65). Correlation between NB -mRNA (delta 
cycle threshold [ΔCt] for the geometric mean of genes from the TaqMan ® Low Density Array NB5 assay ) 
and morphologically -defined tumor cell percentage in BM, 123I-meta -iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) Curie 
score, and CT/MRI -defined tumor longest diameter was determined. Time -dependent covariate Cox 
regression was used to analyze the relationship between Ct and progression -free survival (PFS). NB-
mRNA was detectable in 83% of BM (185/223) and 63% (89/142) of blood specimens, and their Cts were 
correlated (Spearman r=0.67, p<0.0001) although BM Ct was 7.9±0.5 Ct stronger than blood Ct. When BM 
morphology, MIBG, or CT/MRI were positive, NB -mRNA was detected in 99% (99/100), 88% (100/113 ), 
and 81% (82/101) of BMs. When all three were negative, NB -mRNA was detected in 55% (11/20) of BMs. 
BM NB -mRNA correlated with BM morphology or  MIBG positivity (p<0.0001 and p=0.007). BM and blood 
ΔCts correlated with PFS (p<0.001; p=0.001) even when BM was morphologically negative (p=0.001; 
p=0.014). Multivariate analysis showed that BM and blood ΔCts were associated with PFS independently 
of clinical disease and MYCN  gene status (p<0.001; p=0.055). This five -gene NB5 assay for NB -mRNA 
improves definition of disease status and correlates independently with PFS in relapsed/refractory NB.   
 
The current study includes an exploratory aim to evaluate  neuroblastoma cell detection in blood and bone 
marrow by NB5 assay within the context of this study . These samples will be obtained as part of the 
companion NANT biology study ( N04-05). 
 
2.8.4  Evaluation of the Tumor Microenvironment  (TME)  and Immune Response Genetic Signatures  
Recent studies in neuroblastoma have demonstrated an increasingly important role of the TME in 
contributing to neuroblastoma cell growth, metastasis , drug resistance, and evasion from immune -mediated 
destruction ( 66,67). An analysis of tumor tissue from patients with high -risk neuroblastoma demonstrated 
higher infiltration of tumor -associated macrophages  (TAMs) in metastatic compared to locoregional tumors, 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   18 
 and patients with metastatic tumors at age ≥ 18 months had hi gher expression of inflammation -related 
genes than those with metastatic tumors at age < 18 months ( 66). This so -called inflammatory subtype of 
neuroblastoma is thought to have a high risk of recurrence and a poor prognosis. In this study we will 
evaluate the most recently obtained soft tissue tumor samples  when present  for the presence of TAMs,  as 
well as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and correlate this with response to therapy. We will also 
evaluate for the presence of the immune checkpoint proteins CD274 (PDL1) and CD276 (B7H3) as these 
may affect the activity of the effector T and NK cells and impact immune activation and potentially ADCC.  
Furthermore, expression of immune response related genes may be predictive of anti -tumor ef fect and 
ADCC in patients treated with dinutuximab and 131I-MIBG. RNA samples obtained from the blood prior to 
and following therapy, and samples collected after administration of 131I-MIBG and dinutuximab will be used 
for analysis of expression of a panel  of genes related to immune function (including cell surface receptors, 
proteases, cytokines and cytokine receptors, cell cycle and protein kinases, etc .) and for more global 
analysis via RNASeq (68). We will also perform these analyses on tumor tissue whe n available.  
 
2.9  Preclinical Experience with Vorinostat in Neuroblastoma  
Vorinostat, known as a pan -histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor due to its ability to inhibit both class -I and 
class -II HDACs, is a potent inhibitor of HDAC activity at low nanomolar concentrations (69). A variety of 
HDAC inhibitors have demonstrated the abil ity to promote apoptosis and differentiation across multiple 
neuroblatoma cell lines (70 -74). Preclinical testing of vorinostat in xenograft mouse models derived from 
neuroblastoma cell lines demonstrated statistically significant prolongation of event -free survival in 4/6 cell 
lines tested (75). Preclinical studies have demonstrated additional potential benefits of vorinostat in 
neuroblastoma, such as the ability to increase expression of the norepinephrine transporter and increase 
MIBG uptake in vitro  and in vivo  within 24 hours of vorinostat exposure (76). Vorinostat has also been 
shown to sensitize neuroblastoma cells to the effects of ionizing radiation, and enhance the efficacy of 
radiation when given in combination (77). These data provided rationale for the NANT 07 -03 phase 1 study 
testing 131I-MIBG plus vorinostat in patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma (21).  
  
2.10  Rationale for Testing Vorinostat in Combination with 131I-MIBG and Dinutuximab  
Preclinical data demonstrate that vorinostat upregulates GD2 cell surface expression in vitro  (murine 
9464D, human IMR -32 and SKNAS cell lines) and in vivo  (C57Bl/6 mice bearing 9464D tumors) 
neuroblastoma models (69,78). While the exact mechanism of how vorinostat increases GD2 expression 
remains un clear, preliminary investigations suggest that it either works directly by affecting the acetylation 
of GD2 synthase or indirectly through transcriptional regulation of the GD2 synthase stabilizing gene (69). 
By increasing the number of macrophages with ac tivating Fc receptors and decreasing the number of 
myeloid -derived suppressor cells, vorinostat creates a permissive tumor microenvironment for anti -GD2 
immunotherapy (69). Most importantly, Kroesen et al., using their TH -MYCN transgenic mouse model, 
demon strated that the anti -GD2 antibody plus vorinostat combination was synergistic, and led to both 
significantly superior inhibition of neuroblastoma tumor growth and survival compared to vorinostat alone 
(9/9 mice alive at day 45 in combination compared to 4 /9 mice in single agent). This provides rationale for 
clinically testing vorinostat in combination with anti -GD2 antibody therapy in patients with 
relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma.  
 
The NANT 2011 -01 study was a randomized, pick -the-winner, phase 2 trial that sought to determine 
whether the addition of one of two different putative radiation sensitizers, vincristine/irinotecan (Arm B) or 
vorinostat (Arm C), given in combination with 131I-MIBG  (18 mCi/kg), produced superior response rates 
compared to 131I-MIBG  monotherapy (Arm A) in patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma. Patients 
treated on Arm C of N11 -01 received vorinostat at 180 mg/m2/day on days -1 to +12 (14 days) with 131I-
MIBG  on day 1 (18 mCi/kg) based on the preceeding phase 1 trial (NANT 07 -03) that established this as 
the RP2D and demonstrated that this combination was safe and well -tolerated (21). On NANT 11 -01, after 
one course of therapy in 105 response -evaluable patients, the objective response rate (ORR) on Arms A 
(N=36), B (N=35), and C (N=34) were 17% (95% CI: 7 -33%), 14% (95% CI: 5 -31%), and 32% (95% CI: 18 -
51%), respectively (79). An additional 7 patients on Arm C met criteria for a minor response per NANT 
criteria. Rates of ≥ grade 3 non -hematologic toxicity were comparable between the 131I-MIBG  monotherapy 
and 131I-MIBG  + vorinostat arm, accounting for the known vorinostat toxicities. These data demonstrate that 
the addition of vorinostat to 131I-MIBG  produc es almost twice the ORR compared to 131I-MIBG  monotherapy. 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   19 
 We will administer vorinostat on the same dose and schedule, unless intolerable, as was utilized in the 
N11-01 study.  
 
Potential overlapping toxicities between vorinostat and dinutuximab may includ e GI toxicities such as loss 
of appetite, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and elevated liver function tests, and 
nephrotoxicities such as elevated creatinine and electrolyte wasting. We do not expect increased 
hematologic toxicity from the vorin ostat + dinutuximab combination. The NANT phase 1 trial (NANT 08 -02) 
that combined vorinostat with cis -retinoic acid showed that ≥ grade 3 non -hematologic toxicity from 
vorinostat is infrequent (80). In 28 DLT -evaluable patients, there were no grade 4, cyc le 1 treatment -related, 
non-hematologic events, and grade 3 events were limited to pain (N=3 events), cheilitis (N=1), nausea 
(N=1), vomiting (N=1), AST/ALT elevation (N=3), and rash (N=1). NANT 11 -01 demonstrated that only one -
third of the patients treate d on Arm C (131I-MIBG + vorinostat) experienced a > grade 3 non -hematologic 
toxicity, and no patients experienced ≥ grade 3 diarrhea (74). The first 2 dose levels (N=11) of NANT 17 -
01 have shown low rates of treatment related non -hematologic toxicity, with  no episodes of grade 4 non -
hematologic toxicity, and grade 3 events limited to abdominal pain (N=2), GGT increased (N=1), and 
hypokalemia (N=1). Based on these data, we anticipate that any overlapping toxicities between vorinostat, 
131I-MIBG, and dinutuximab will be low  grade and easily managed.  
 
2.11  Rationale for Protocol Amendments  
 
Amendment #1   
 
Pre-activation amendment dealt with updates and clarifications in required observations, drug information, 
and statistical design, in addition to administrative changes.  
 
Amendment #2  
 
The 3+3 de sign was replaced by Rolling 6  design. Due to the long duration of each course the study 
committee deemed the Rolling 6  design to be more efficient; especially in the light of recent approval from 
the FDA to charge patients for the investigational use of 131I-MIBG . In addition, language was  updated 
regarding plasma and PBMC separation and storage (Appendix VI) . This new la nguage simplif ies the 
process through using CPT tubes, remov es the need for sites to make the freeze media as this will be 
provided by Emory. As a result, Appendix VII is no longer needed and specific instructions were provided 
for the volume of freeze med ia to add.  Language was also added to allow sites to use local procedures for 
plasma and PBMC isolation if approved by study committee.  After discussion with FDA, NDP was removed 
supplier for 131I-MIBG. At this time Jubilant Radio pharma  will be the only supplier for 131I-MIBG.  The GM -
CSF toxicity table in the consent was revised to better reflect the package insert and protocol . A new 
subsection  was added to outline general instructions for ordering dinutuximab. After discussion with stu dy 
committee, HACA and ADA collection time points were revised to be consistent with  HACA and ADA  
collection  time points in current NANT studies.  Two additional sampling times were added to complete 
HACA/ADA levels analysis.  
 
Amendment #3  
 
Based on review of hepatic toxicity in patients treated on this protocol, DLT language was revised to exclude 
Grade 3 GGT (attributable to protocol therapy) as a DLT since ALT, AST and bilirubin are the main 
parameters used for eligibility  and required  observations , and are the parameters that are most clinically 
meaningful.  Statistical language was updated to reflect Rolling 6 design.  Additional administrative edits 
were implemented throughout the protocol.  
 
 
Amendment #3 A 
 
Language was revised in sample consent regarding risk and results of germline genetic testing. Language 
was added in section 6.0 (Drug Information) regarding unit dose vials and radiochemical purity testing . 
 
 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   20 
 Amendment #4 A 
 
Based on results of the NANT 2011-01 study and preclinical data suggesting HDAC inhibitors can synergize 
with anti -GD2 antibody, this amendment added Part B which will test vorin ostat in combination with 131I-
MIBG and dinutuximab/GM -CSF. We will test one dose level of vorinostat in combination with the 
MTD/RP2D of 131I-MIBG  /Dinutuximab/GM -CSF from Part A of this study  (18 mCi/kg/dose) , with 1 dose de -
escalation level if needed, and then enroll to an expansion cohort testing the vorinost at, 131I-MIBG , and 
dinutuximab/GM -CSF combination. Eligibil ity changes to reflect part B requirements were made.  Changes 
related to GM -CSF were made to exclude patients who previously had to permanently discontinue GM -
CSF due to toxicity, clarify GM -CSF a dministration, and remove any minimum requirement of GM -CSF 
received to be evaluable for dose -escalation purposes. To align with other NANT trials, the definition of 
evaluable for response was modified to state that any patient on Part A who receive s 131I-MIBG  or any 
patient that receive s a dose of vorinostat on Part B w ill be evaluable for response.  Patients previously 
treated on study prior to amendment #4 A will have their response re -classified using this updated definition, 
and all patients enrolled on study after amendment #4 A will have to meet this updated definition to be 
considered evaluable for response.  Additionally, the definition of evaluable for dose escalation 
consideration (DLT -evaluable) was modified with this amendment. The new definition of  evaluability applies 
only for patients treated on the Part A dose expansion cohort and patients on Part B. Patients treated on 
the Part A dose escalation cohort both before and after amendment #4 A will continue to use the previous 
definition of DLT -evaluable (i.e., patients treated on study prior to amendment #4 A will not be re -classified 
using the amendment #4 A definition of DLT -evaluable).  A new Informed consent for Part B was added.  In 
addition , changes to response to clarify version 2.0 for bone marrow response were included.  Other 
administrative changes were made to the protocol.  
 
 
Amendment #5  
 
The protocol was amended to remove the 131I-MIBG radiochemical purity testing requirement prior to 131I-
MIBG infusion that was previously mandated on this protocol. This change was made for consistency with 
the most up -to-date Jubilant Radiopharma Nuclear Medicine Manual (Version 8). Prior referen ces to 
“Jubilant Draximage” were updated to “Jubilant Radiopharma” to correspond with the company’s name 
change. Additionally, editorial changes have been made throughout the protocol document.

 3.0  PATIENT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND R EGISTRATION   
3.1  Patient Preparation for Study Entry and Registration  
The NANT Operations Center will accept treatment reservations for this study  once the patient has been 
reviewed at an 131I-MIBG treatment center as a possible candidate for this study.     
3.1.1   Patient Registration on Study  
NANT trials have two components for data entry workflow: 1. Data collection on paper CRF and data entry 
at the NANT Operations Center through the CAFÉ d atabase and 2. Remote data entry via Medidata Rave 
clinical data management system.   
This is a dose escalation study and treatment slots are obtained through the standard NANT reservation 
process by sending an email to NANTrsvp@chla.usc.edu  
 
Sites begin the reservation process by completing a subject screen form in Medidata.  This generates a 
unique subject screen number  (S-xxx).  The site uses this number to reserve a treatment slot for the patient  
with the NANT Operations Center ( NANTrsvp@chla.usc.edu ) .  Once assigned a treatment slot by the 
NANT Operations Center, s ites should  send signed informed consent /assent  and all source documentation 
confirming eligibility to the NANT Operations Center  at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles by email  to 
nantcrf@chla.usc.edu  or if unable to email by FAX at 323 -361-1803 , Monday through Friday, 8:30am – 
5:00pm Pacific Time except holidays.   
Once all necessary source documentation is received in the NANT Operations Center, sites can complete 
the enrollment process by submitting the eligibility form in Medidata Rave.  The NA NT Operations Center 
will v erify eligibility and assign a unique NANT registration and study subject number in Medidata Rave.  
The dose level  for treatment will be assigned by the NANT Operations Center at the time of study 
registration.  Once study regist ration is completed , the NANT Operations Center will send an email  to the 
site confirming registration and dose level for treatment.  This  registration  email must  be received prior to 
starting any protocol therapy or the patient will be declared ineligible .  The registration email will be sent to 
the treating facilities, Study Chair, Study Vice -Chair, and relevant committee members.  The registration 
steps are summarized in Table 3 below.

 3Refer to protocol Section 4 .2.3.3 for criteria to receive dinutuximab on Day 8 and Day 29.  
 
4Disease evaluation is to occur between Days 43 -57.  In case of treatment delays with dinutuximab during Course 1, 
the time interval between performing end of Course 1 disease evaluation and administration of Course 2 131I-MIBG is 
not to exceed 4 weeks.  
 
4.1.2  Part B  
 
Patients receive vorinostat on Days 0 to +13  (14 days) and 131I-MIBG on Day 1. The dose of vorinostat and 
131I-MIBG  will be based on the dose level assigned at the  time of patient registration. Patients will receive 
a total of 14 doses of vorinostat. Missed doses may be made up provided there is at least 24 hours between 
vorinostat and infusion of stem cells, and stem cell infusion is not delayed beyond Day 17; vori nostat should 
not be administered after stem cell infusion regardless of the number of doses received. Patients should 
not exceed 14 total doses of vorinostat for any reason . If a patient vomits within 15 minutes of vorinostat 
dose administration, the patient should be re -dosed. If the patient vomits after the second dose, the patient 
should not b e re-dosed again. If a patient vomits more than 15 minutes from dose administration, the patient 
should not be re -dosed. Refer to Section 4.2.5 .1 and 6.5.4  for vorinostat drug administration guidelines.  
 
Dinutuximab 17.5 mg/m2 is given intravenously on Days 8-11 and 29 -32 of therapy, along with GM -CSF 
250 mcg/m2 on Days 8 -17 and 29 -38. All patients receive autologous hematopoietic stem cell infusion on 
Day 15 (+2 /-1) of therapy. This must occur at a NANT site.  
 
Course duration is defined as 57 days or longer if hematopoietic recovery to eligibility criteria occurs after

4.2      Drug Administration  
 
4.2.1  131I-MIBG  Therapy  
 
DOSE:  Based on dose level assignment at study registration.  Refer to Section 4.3 dose escalation.  
 
DAY:  Day 1 of therapy intravenously via either a central or a peripheral IV catheter over 1.5 to  2 
 hours.     
 
 Starting therapy on Tuesday – Thursday is strongly encouraged. Notify NANT Operations 
Center/ Study Chairperson if  treatment is delayed for any reason and will not start on a Tuesday – 
Thursday . 
 
The primary 131I-MIBG supplier for this study is Jubilant Radiopharma , Canada.  
  
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   31 
  
4.2.1.1.  General Instructions for Drug Ordering and Administration  
• To allow time for appropriate planning, the weight that is used to order  the 131I-MIBG dose can 
be obtained at the time of initial consult or consent. However, due to the potential for significant 
weight changes while waiting to initiate therapy,  the 131I-MIBG dose that is administered  MUST 
be calculated based on a weight obtained within 7 days before the  date of 131I-MIBG 
administration.    
 
Sites will use the “131I-MIBG Order Notification Form for NANT 2017 -01”, available on the NANT 
website , and the site specific 131I-MIBG Order  form provided by Jubilant Radiopharma  to order  
a 131I-MIBG dose from supplier.  NANTCRF@chla.usc.edu  is to be copied on all drug orders 
and correspondence regarding 131I-MIBG dose planning between site and supplier.   
 
• The therapeutic dose of 131I-MIBG will be infused intravenously over 1.5 -2 hours on Day 1 of 
therapy with appropriate hydration, radiati on isolation, thyroid blocking with potassium iodide 
(SSKI) , and bladder protection with a Foley catheter.  
 
• The maximum absolute dose of 131I-MIBG  that may be infused  on this protocol is 1200 mCi. 
The dose administered should be within 10% of the prescribed dose. There will be no 
adjustment for obesity except to cap the absolute dose at 1200 mCi.  
 
• Radiopurity is checked by the supplier  prior to shipment. As of 10/20/21 , radiochemical 
purity testing at clinical sites following receipt of 131I-MIBG  is no longer required. Should 
clinical sites still wish to perform radiochemical purity testing, a suggested technique can 
be found in Appendix V.  
 
• The patient will remain in a radiation protected isolation room until radiation em issions meet 
institutional/state guidelines. Radiation levels will be measured at least once daily by Radiation 
Safety using a handheld monitor standing at a distance of one meter from the patient. It usually 
takes 3 -5 days for the patient to be cleared an d then they can be discharged.  
 
• Patients should be transfused as needed to achieve a documented hemoglobin of ≥ 10 
g/dL on the day of or one day prior to 131I-MIBG administration.  
 
4.2.1.2  Hydration  
In order to ensure adequate hydration, patients will receive a minimum of 1.5 -times maintenance 
rate IV fluids starting the night prior to 131I-MIBG infusion and continuing until the radiation dose 
rate is < 7 mRem/hr at 1 meter. Once < 7 mRem/hr, IV hydra tion is at the discretion of the treating 
institution.  
 
4.2.1.3  Bladder Protection  
A Foley catheter is strongly recommended for all patients prior to 131I-MIBG infusion and required 
of all patients < 12 years of age. Patients ≥ 12 years of age may decline Foley catheter placement 
at investigator discretion if they agree to void every 2 hours throughout the first 48 hours after 131I-
MIBG infusion . If for ph ysical/anatomic reasons it is not possible to successfully place or retain a 
catheter, then the treatment may proceed for continent patients who are able to comply with voiding 
every 2 hours throughout the first 48 hours following the infusion. For contine nt patients, the 
catheter may be removed after 72 hours or after the patient’s dose rate at 1 meter is < 7 mRem/hr, 
whichever occurs earlier. For incontinent (diapered) patients, the catheter is recommended to 
remain in place until the patient is released from radiation isolation.  
  
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   32 
  
4.2.1.4  Thyroid Protection  
Potassium iodide solution (SSKI) will be given in a loading dose of 6 mg/kg by mouth 8 -12 hours 
prior to the infusion of 131I-MIBG  on Day 1, and then 1 mg/kg/dose by mouth starting 4 -6 hours after 
completion o f the 131I-MIBG  infusion, and continuing every 4 hours on protocol Days 1 to 7, and 
then 1 mg/kg/dose by mouth once daily on protocol Days 8 to 45.  
  
If 131I-MIBG infusion is delayed due to shipment or other issues and the patient has already received 
their loading dose, a suggested practice is to hold any further SSKI and to repeat the loading dose 
as above; this is to spare the patient and family an additio nal day of q4h SSKI dosing. An acceptable 
alternative approach is to just start the subsequent SSKI doses on schedule as though the 131I-
MIBG infusion had been completed on schedule.  
 
 
4.2.1.5  Radiation Isolation  
Following the 131I-MIBG infusion, patients must rem ain in radiation isolation until the patient’s 
radiation emissions meet state/institutional guidelines for release.  
 
4.2.1.6  Imaging  
An MIBG imaging study similar to the diagnostic scan will be done at the time of release from 
radiation isolation and will not requ ire an additional injection. This is to confirm tumor MIBG uptake 
and to survey for occult sites of disease.  SPECT is not required for this MIBG scan.  Sedation is 
generally not necessary for this scan.  
 
4.2.1.7  Whole Body Dosimetry  
Whole body dosimetry will not b e calculated in real time.  However, serial measurements of 
radiation levels will be obtained. While in radiation isolation, whole -body monitoring will be 
performed using a ceiling -mounted meter at consistent patient geometry. The person obtaining the 
meas urement should be certain the patient is centered under the monitor and that the height of the 
bed has not been changed.  
 
All times are noted from the beginning of the 131I-MIBG infusion and assume  a 2-hour infusion.  
The minimum whole body measurements will be taken as follows, and saved in the computer log. 
All times are measured from the beginning of the MIBG infusion.  
  
TIME  SCHEDULE  
Infusion  0, 1, 2 (including end infusion, with 
time marked)  
Post-Infusion Hours 2 -8 Every 30 minutes hours 2 -8 
Post-Infusion Hours 8 -24 Hours 8, 12, 16, 20, 24  
Subsequent Days  Every 8 hours until hospital 
discharge or hour 120, whichever 
occurs first  
 
If the ceiling mounted monitor is not functional for any reason , then measurements will be 
taken with a handheld ion chamber at 1 meter from the umbilicus with consistent geometry and 
distance beginning at the completion of the infusion (hour 2) and at hours 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, then every 
8 hours thereafter.  
  
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   33 
  
4.2.2 Autologous Peripheral Stem Cell Infusion  
 DOSE: Minimum dose  2.0 x 106 viable CD34+ cells/kg.  
 
DAY:  Day 15 + /- 2 days (Part A) or + 2/-1 day (Part B) to avoid weekend or holiday infusion , to 
accommodate logistical/scheduling issues, or to avoid occurring  within 24 hours of last dose of 
vorinostat .   
  
 Stem cell infusion is planned for 14 days after 131I-MIBG infusion. If the 131I-MIBG infusion is 
 delayed, the date of stem cell infusion should be re -dated for 14 days after 131I-MIBG infusion.  
 
Stem cells must be infused at the treating NANT institution.   
  
4.2.2.1 General Instructions for Peripheral Stem Cell Administration   
• In situations in which t he DMSO concentration in the stem cell product would exceed an 
accepted level for infusion within a 24 -hour period, stem cell products may be infused over two 
days to meet this standard.  
 
• Stem cell infusion may occur sooner  than Day 15  if indicated (i.e. due to an infectious or 
bleeding complication) after consultation with the Study Chairperson  or designee.  
 
• For patients whose body weight exceeds ideal body weight (IBW) by more than 20%, adjusted 
body weight may be used for calculation of PBSC dose (Refer ence: Bone Marrow Transplant. 
40(7):665 -9; Appendix III).  
 
4.2.2.2 Pre-medications for Stem Cell infusion  
Stem cells will be infused following institutional guidelines for prophylaxis of hypersensitivity 
reactions and monitoring.  
 
4.2.2.3 Location of Stem Cell Infusion  
Stem cell infusion is considered a supportive care measure on this protocol.   Stem cells m ust be 
infused at the treating NANT institution.   
 
4.2.3  Dinutuximab  
 DOSE:  Based on dose level assignment at study registration  for Part A . Refer to Section 4.3 dose 
 escalation.  All patients on Part B will receive 17.5 mg/m2/dose.  
 
 DAY:  Days 8-11 and Days 29 -32 intravenously over approximately 10 hours if tolerated.  
 
 Refer to Section 4.2.3.1 Instructions for Dinutuximab Administration , Section 4.2.3.2 Criteria to 
 Receive Dinutuximab  and Sections 4.2.3.3 – 4.2.3.5 for recommendations on pre -medication, 
 pain management and monitoring during infusion .   
 
4.2.3.1  General Instructions for Drug Ordering  
 
• Sites will use the “Dinutuximab Order Form for NANT 2017 -01”, available on the NANT website , to 
place an order for dinutuximab . A copy of the drug order form is to be sent to NANTCRF@chla.usc.edu  
 
• To conserve dinutuximab vials, recommendation has bee n made to not use 2 vials per day until 
patient’s BSA exceeds 1.1  m2. For patients between BSA 1.0 -1.1 m2, this is less than a 10% 
deviation; which is allowed . 
  
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   34 
  
4.2.3. 2 Instructions for Dinutuximab Administration  
• Each daily dose of dinutuximab should be infused IV over approximately 10 hours, starting at 
0.88 mg/m2/hr x 0.5 hr, then increasing to 1.75 mg/m2/hr for the remainder of the dose, if 
tolerated. The infusion duration may be extended up to 20 hours for anticipated toxicities (pain, 
fever , tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension), not responding to other supportive measures, and 
the duration should be recorded.   
 
• The maximum infusion time is 20 hours; dinutuximab administration must be stopped after 20 
hours even if the total dose has not been administered. The total dose given in 20 hours should 
be recorded.   
 
4.2.3. 3 Criteria to Receive Dinutuximab  
• Day 8 Dose   
The day 8 dinutuximab dose can be given anytime from Day 6 until Day 11 as long as ALL of the 
following  criteria are met:  
o Cleared the 131I-MIBG (radiation level < 7 mRem/hr at 1 meter)  
o No evidence of infection, or if present, infection under control with negative blood culture  
o ALT ≤ 450 U/L ( 10 x ULN  where ULN = 45 U/L).  
o Total bilirubin ≤ 5 x ULN ( Grade 2)  
o Creatinine ≤ 3 x ULN ( Grade 2)  
o If the Day 8 dose is delayed beyond Day 11 then patient is off protocol therapy.   If the delay 
is the result of toxicity, this event would be considered a DLT  
o QTc ≤ 480 msec (Part B only)  
 
• Day 29 Dose  
The start of the Day 29 dinutuximab infusion may be delayed up to 2 weeks if needed to meet the 
following criteria : 
o At least 3 weeks have passed since the start of the Day 8 dinutuximab infusion  
o Meet the renal function requirements as outlined in Section 3.2.9 .2   
o ALT ≤  225 U/L ( 5 x ULN (grade 2)  where ULN = 45 U/L).  
o Absolute phagocyte count (APC) ≥ 750 /μL 
o No evidence of infection, or if present, infection under control with negative blood culture  
o No DLT prior to start of the Day 29 infusion  
o If the Day 29 dose is delayed beyond 2 weeks  then patient is off protocol therapy.   If the 
delay is the result of t oxicity, this event would be considered a DLT  
 
4.2.3. 4 Recommended Premedications :  
• Hydroxyzine (0.5 -1 mg/kg; max dose 50 mg) PO or diphenhydramine (0.5 -1 mg/kg; max dose 
50 mg) IV over 10 minutes to start approximately 20 minutes prior to dinutuximab infusion; may 
be repeated every 6 hours as needed during dinutuximab infusion. Note : intravenous 
hydroxyzine is NOT recommended.  
 
• Acetaminophen (10 -15 mg/kg; max dose 650 mg) PO given approximately 20 minutes prior to 
dinutuximab infusion; may be repeated every 4 -6 hours either scheduled or as needed for fever.  
 
4.2.3.5  Recommended Pain Management :  
• Morphine sulfate loading dose immediately  prior to dinutuximab administration. A dose of 50 
mcg/kg is recommended, though this may be adjusted based on a given patient’s pain history 
or institutional guidelines. Other narcotics such as hydromorphone or fentanyl can be used 
instead of morphine.  
• Continue with morphine sulfate drip titrated to effect. The recommended dose range for the 
continuous infusion is 20 -50 mcg/kg/hr to continue for 2 hours after completion of the 
dinutuximab infusion, although institutional standards may be utilized. Other n arcotics such as 
hydromorphone or fentanyl can be used instead of morphine.  
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   35 
  
• Gabapentin may be used in conjunction with other pain medications per institutional practice.  
 
• If additional or alternative pain medications (lidocaine, ketamine, etc.) are need ed, it is strongly 
recommended that this be done in consultation with pediatric pain management specialists.  
 
4.2.3.6  Monitoring during Dinutuximab Infusion :  
• Vital signs should be assessed every 15 minutes for the first hour of the infusion, then hourly 
during t he remainder of the infusion if stable after the first hour. More frequent assessment may 
be required based on the patient’s clinical condition. Between antibody doses, vitals should be 
assessed every 4 hours.  
 
• Strict observation of intake and output is r equired on the days of dinutuximab administration.  
 
• Patients should be weighed daily on the days of dinutuximab administration.  
 
  
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   36 
 4.2.4  Sargramostim (GM -CSF)  
DOSE:  250 mcg/m2/dose . 
 
DAY:  Once daily on Days 8 -17 and Days 29 -38. 
 
4.2.4.1  Instructions for GM -CSF Administration  
• The standard route of administration is subcutaneous (SQ); use of an insuflon catheter is 
permitted.  
 
• In extenuating circumstances, IV administration over 2 hours is permitted. The reason for IV 
administration of thi s agent must be documented.  
 
• See Section 4.2.4. 2 for criteria to extend GM -CSF administration.   
 
• If the Day 8 or Day 29 GM -CSF dose is given but then the respective dinutuximab dose is not 
started the same day, additional doses of GM -CSF should not be given beyond the planned 10 
doses with each cycle of dinutuximab.  
 
4.2.4.2 Growth Factor Support Outside Planned GM -CSF Doses on  Days 8-17 and Day s 29-38  
• It is strongly recommended that GM -CSF be the only growth factor used on this study. The use 
of filgrastim (G -CSF) or pegfilgrastim, even if the patient experiences febrile neutropenia, is 
strongly discouraged.  
 
• GM-CSF is strongly recommended for any pati ent who develops Grade 4 neutropenia [absolute 
neutrophil count (ANC) < 500/μL]. If GM -CSF is started or continued during this time, it is 
recommended that it be continued until the ANC is > 2000/μL.  
 
• If a patient experiences Grade 4 neutropenia while receiving vorinostat prior to the Day 8 
dinutuximab/GM -CSF dose, GM -CSF can be initiated early  once they clear radiation isolation. 
If GM -CSF is started prior to the Day 8 dinutuximab dose, the GM -CSF should still be continued 
at least until the Day 17 GM -CSF dose, i.e. the patient should still receive the full 10 doses of 
GM-CSF associated with the Day 8 dinutuximab dose.  
 
4.2.5  Vorinostat  
DOSE:  Based on dose level assignment at study registration. Refer to Section 4.3 .2 dose escalation.  The 
maximum  vorinostat dose is 400 mg.  
 
DAY: D ays 0 to +1 3 (14 total doses)  of therapy once daily by mouth, NG, or G -tube 
 
4.2.5.1  Instructions for Vorinostat Administration  
• Vorinostat will be given for 14 days continuously, even if the 131I-MIBG portion of therapy is delayed 
due to production or other logistical reasons  or if dinutuximab start date is delayed .  
• Missed doses may be made up provided there is at least 24 hours between vorinostat and infusion 
of stem cells, and stem cell infusion is not dela yed beyond Day 17; vorino stat should not be 
administered after stem cell infusion regardless of the number of doses received. Pati ents should 
not exceed 14 total doses of vorinostat for any reason.  
• If a patient vomits within 15 minutes of vorinostat dose administration, the patient should be re -
dosed. If the patient vomits after the second dose, the patient should not be re -dosed aga in. If a 
patient vomits more than 15 minutes from dose administration, the patient should not be re -dosed.  
• For patients unable to swallow capsules, vorinostat will be given as a 50 mg/mL extempo raneous 
liquid suspension (see S ection 6.6.4  for preparation i nstructions) with dosing according to the 
nomogram in Appendix VIII. The maximum vorinostat dose is 400 mg. (Please contact NANT 
Operations if extemporaneous liquid suspension is not available)  
• Patients who are able to swallow capsules may receive vorinostat capsules instead of suspension 
if their calculated vorinostat dose is within +/ - 10% of a 100 mg increment ( e.g. 100 mg, 200 mg, 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   37 
 300 mg, or 400 mg). Otherwise, they will need to receive vorinostat as suspension and dosed 
according to the nomogra m in Appendix VIII. The maximum vorinostat dose is 400 mg.  
• Vorinostat should be taken with food or within 30 minutes after a meal. The dose should be taken 
in the morning whenever possible.  
 
4.2.5.2  Instructions for Ordering Vorinostat  
• Vorinostat will be o btained via commercial supply.  
 
4.3 Dose Escalation Schedule  
 
4.3.1  Part A  
 
 Dose Level  131I-MIBG (mCi/kg/dose)  Dinutuximab (mg/m2/dose)  
0 12 14 
Starting Dose Level:  1 12 17.5 
 2 15 17.5 
3 18 17.5 
 
Dose escalation will begin at Dose Level 1, with escalation up to Dose Level 3 following the Rolling  6 dose 
escalation design.  If Dose Level 1 is deemed intolerable per the dose escalation rules, then Dose Level 0 
will be evaluated. Patients will be treated at the dose of 131I-MIBG and dinutuximab assigned at study 
registration.  There will be no intrapatient dose escalation.  
 
The star ting dose of 131I-MIBG  is 12 mCi/kg at Dose Level 1.  The dinutuximab dose is 17.5 mg/m2/dose. If 
the starting dose level ( Dose Level 1) is not tolerated, patients will be enrolled to Dose Level 0, which keeps 
the 131I-MIBG dose at 12 mCi/kg, but reduces the dinutuximab dose to 14 mg/m2/dose.  
 
4.3.2  Part B  
 
 Dose Level  Vorinostat 
(mg/m2/dose)# 131I-MIBG 
(mCi/kg /dose ) Dinutuximab 
(mg/m2/dose)  
Starting Dose Level  4 180 18 17.5 
 4a* 150 18 17.5 
#Maximum vorinostat  dose: 400 mg  
*De-escalation dose level 4a to enroll only if dose level 4 is not tolerated  
 
The starting dose level for Part B will be Dose Level 4. Patients on this dose level will receive vorinostat at 
180 mg/m2/dose and 131I-MIBG at  18 mCi/kg/dose  (the MTD/RP2D determined in Part A ). Dinutuximab will 
be given at 17.5 mg/m2/dose. Enrollment will follow the Rolling 6 dose escalation design. If Dose Level 4 is 
deemed intolerable per the dose escalation rules, then Dose Level 4a will be evaluated.  Pati ents will be 
treated at the assigned dose of vorinostat and 131I-MIBG.  There will be no intrapatient dose escalation. 
Once the MTD/RP2D is establi shed in Part B , we will enroll 6 evaluable patient s in an  expansion cohort  to 
further test the MIBG, vorinost at, and dinutuximab/GM -CSF combination . 
 
 
4.4 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
Toxicity will be graded using the CTCAE criteria, version 5. The CTCAE provides descriptive 
terminology and a grading scale for each adverse event listed. A copy of the CTCAE can be 
downloaded from the CTEP home page (http://ctep.cancer.gov ).  Any dose -limiting toxicity shoul d 
be reported immediately through the NANT Operations Center to the Study Chairperson.  
 
 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   38 
 4.4.1  Definition of Evaluable for Dose Escalation  
A patient will be considered evaluable for dose escalation purposes if they receive ≥ 90% of the 
assigned dose of 131I-MIBG, ≥ 80% of the assigned doses of dinutuximab and GM -CSF (GM-CSF 
criterion only applicable to Part A dose -escalation) , and > 78% of th e assigned doses of vorinostat 
(at least 11 days; Part B only)  during Course 1. Patients who receive less than 90% of the assigned 
131I-MIBG dose , less than 80% of the assigned dinutuximab  or GM -CSF doses (Part A dose -
escalation only) , or less than 78% of the assigned  vorinostat  doses  (less than 11 days; Part B  only) 
for reasons other than toxicity will be replaced for the purposes of evaluating the dose level for 
dose escalation/de -escalat ion purposes, unless they experience a  DLT in first course. All patients 
who receive 131I-MIBG  in Part A  or vorinostat in Part B are evaluable for toxicity reporting.  
 
4.4.2  Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
DLT will be defined as any of the following events that are possibly, probably, or definitely 
attributable to study regimen . Only dose limiting toxicities as described below that occur during 
Course 1 that are possibly, probably or definitely related to t he regimen (and not excluded in Section 
4.4.3 below) will be used for determination of the MTD /RP2D  of 131I-MIBG  (Part A) or vorinostat 
(Part B)  although all DLT s during any course will be reported.  Patients who experience a DLT 
during the first course of therapy will not be offered further treatment on study.  
 
Certain frequently observed side effects known to be related to dinutuximab are transient, and can 
be well -controlled clinically. These trans ient side effects, if well -controlled clinically , will not be 
used in this study to determine dose limiting toxicity. The list of toxicities that will NOT be 
considered DLT are outlined in Section 4.4.3. 
 
4.4.3 Non-Hematologic Dose Limiting Toxicity  
Non-hematologic dose -limiting toxicity is defined as a ny Grade 3 or Grade 4 non -hematologic 
toxicity that is possibly, probably, or definitely attributable to the combination of therapy with the 
specific exclusion of the following :  
 
1 Grade 3 nausea or vomiting  
2 Grade 3 or 4 serum amylase elevation that resolves to grade 2 within 14 days and is not 
accompanied by grade 2 lipase elevation or grade ≥ 3 salivary gland toxicity (dry mouth; 
parotid pain).

13 Grade 3 proteinuria that returns to ≤ grade 1 within 5 days of completion of dinutuximab  
14 Grade 3 weight gain that resolves to ≤ grade 2 within 3 days of completion of dinutuximab  
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   39 
 15 Grade 3 weight loss or anorexia that resolves to ≤ Grade 2 within 3 days  
16 Grade 3 dehydration that resolves to ≤ Grade 2 within 3 days

U/L on this study.  
23 Grade 3  GGT; Grade 4 GGT that returns to ≤ grade 2 within 7 days  
24 Grade 3 bilirubin elevation that returns to ≤ Grade 2 within 7 days  
25 Grade 3 or Grade 4 alkaline phosphatase elevation that returns to ≤ Grade 2 within 7 days  
26 Grade 3 neurotoxicity (i.e. interference with function plus objective weakness) will not be a 
DLT if transient and reversing within 3 days of completion of dinutuximab for any course, or 
within 2 weeks of completion for grade 3 sensory changes interfering with daily activities.  
Subjective findings (e.g. tingling, hot or cold hands, taste change, etc.) are expected and will 
not be a DLT.  
27 Grade 3 allergic reactions or anaphylaxis that is readily controlled with supportive anti -
allergic (non -steroidal) treatments (ie: Benadryl, epinephrine)  
28 Grade 3 capillary leak syndrome  
29 Grade 3 cough, dyspnea, hypoxia and bronchospasm that decrease to ≤ Grade 2 within 72

medications (ie; narcotics, diphenhydramine, meperidine, etc .) during dinutuximab  
 
Note : Any non -hematologic toxicity that leads to a patient receiving < 78% of assigned vorinostat doses 
will also be classified as a DLT  in Part B . 
 
4.4.4 Definition of Engraftment and Hematologic Dose Limiting Toxicity  
  
4.4.4.1  Definition of Engraftment  
• Neutrophil engraftment will be defined as an ANC ≥ 500/μL for a minimum of 3 days following 
neutrophil nadir, with or without growth factor support. Date of neutrophil engraftment will be 
the first day of 3 days with ANC ≥ 500/μL.  
 
• Platelet engraftment will be defined as platelets ≥ 20,000/μL for a minimum of 3 days following 
platelet nadir without platelet transfusion for one week. Date of platelet engraftment will be the 
first day of 3 days with platelets ≥ 20,000/μL. If a patient has a platelet transfusion and then 
does not have a nother platelet count < 20,000/μL, the date of platelet engraftment will be the 
first date with platelet count ≥ 20,000 following platelet transfusion.  
  
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   40 
 4.4.4.2 Definition of Hematologic Dose Limiting Toxicity  
• Once stem cell infusion is given, hematologi c dose limiting toxicity will be defined as any of the 
following in the absence of progressive bone marrow disease:  
o Neutrophils (ANC) < 500/µL at 28 days after stem cell infusion  
o Platelets < 20,000/μL at 56 days after stem cell infusion  
o Infusion of additional stem cells for any medical reason after the initial stem cell infusion 
has been given AND prior to engraftment of neutrophils or platelets after that initial stem 
cell infusion.  
 
4.5 Dose Modification and Recommendations for Managem ent of Dinutuximab/GM -CSF 
 Toxicity  
 
4.5.1 There will be no dose reductions of either 131I-MIBG or dinutuximab on this study. The infusion rate 
of dinutuximab may be decreased due to toxicity as outlined below. Patients who experience a DLT 
will come off protocol therapy at that point in time . 
 
4.5.2 Treatment of dinutuximab -induced hypotensio n (without evidence of allergic reaction)  
 
If hypotension is severe and accompanied by poor perfusion, end organ dysfunction, or acidemia,  
Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) guidelines should be followed and dinutuximab infusion 
should be discontinued . 
 
A. If moderate  hypotension is observed  (without  poor perfusion, end organ dysfunction , or 
academia) : 
o Immediately hold dinutuximab  
o Give normal saline bolus (20 mL/kg as rapidly as possible)  
o Stop or adjust doses of narcotics and sedating H1 blockers  
o Consider use of Trendelenberg position  
 
B.  If hypotension persists after the above measures have been taken:  
o Reassess perfusion and end organ function; follow PALS algorithm if needed  
o Repeat NS bolus  
o Consider use of albumin if albumin < 3 gm/dL  
o Consider use of PRBCs if Hb < 10 gm/dL  
o Consider transfer to intensive care setting  
  
C. If hypotension persists following 2 volume boluses, give an additional bolus and prepare to 
administer pressors  
o Epinephrine is preferred over dopamine if possible  
 
D. Resumpt ion of dinutuximab  
For patients whose hypotension resolves promptly and completely with limited volume  
resuscitation and without requirement for pressor support, dinutuximab may be restarted at 
50% of the previous infusion rate. The dinutuximab may be restarted on the same day if it is 
possible to do so within 20 hours of the start of the day’s infusion. If blood pressures are stable 
for 2 hours, the infusion may be given at full rate for that day and subsequent days. If the patient 
again experiences hypotension requiring multiple volume boluses (e.g., > 60 mL/kg) when 
dinutuximab is given at full rate but tolerates the  50% infusion rate, the remaining days’ doses 
of dinutuximab should be given at the 50% rate of infusion. If > 20 hours have elapsed since 
the start of the infusion, restart dinutuximab the following day.  
 
o If blood pressures are stable for 2 hours after resumption of dinutuximab at the reduced 
rate, the remainder of the antibody infusion may be given at the full rate.  
 
o If hypotension recurs at the reduced rate, the measures above should again be taken and 
no further dinutuximab should be given  that day. The antibody infusion may be restarted 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   41 
 the following day after ensuring that the patient is volume replete. The antibody rate upon 
resumption of treatment should be 50% of the initial rate. If blood pressures are stable for 
2 hours, the infusion  may be given at full rate for that day and subsequent days. If the 
patient’s blood pressures are only stable at the 50% rate and not at full rate, the remaining 
days’ doses of dinutuximab should be given at the 50% rate of infusion.  
 
For patients who requ ire multiple volume boluses for hemodynamic stabilization, dinutuximab 
should be resumed the following day at 50% of the initial infusion rate.  
 
o If blood pressures are stable for 2 hours after resumption of dinutuximab at the reduced 
rate, the remainder o f the antibody infusion may be given at the full rate.  
 
o If hypotension recurs at the reduced rate, the measures above should again be taken and 
no further dinutuximab should be given that day. The antibody infusion may be restarted 
the following day after ensuring that the patient is volume replete. The antibody rate upon 
resumption of treatment should be 50% of the initial rate. If blood pressures are stable for 
2 hours, the infusion may be given at full rate for that day and subsequent days. If the 
patien t’s blood pressures are only stable at the 50% rate and not at full rate, the remaining 
days’ doses of dinutuximab should be given at the 50% rate of infusion.  
 
o For patients who require pressors for treatment of hypotension, if blood pressure is stable 
off pressors for at least 6 hours, administration of dinutuximab may be resumed at 50% of 
the initial infusion rate on the day following the hypotensive episode. Care should be taken 
to ensure that the patient is volume replete. Dinutuximab should not be give n to patients 
who continue to require pressor support. Patients who require pressor support for ≥ 24 
hours due to treatment -related hypotension despite appropriate volume resuscitation 
should discontinue protocol therapy. Patients who again require pressor  support when 
dinutuximab is resumed should discontinue protocol therapy.  
 
4.5.3     Treatment of Allergic Reactions/Infusion Reactions  
Note: Coughing may herald the onset of bronchospasm and if occurs, patient s should be 
closely monitored.  
 
 4.5.3.1 Mild allergic reactions/infusion reactions to dinutuximab infusion  
 
o Mild allergic reaction is limited to rash, flushing, urticaria, mild dyspnea – Grade 1 or 2  
 
o The following recommendations do NOT  apply to Grade 3 o r 4 allergic reactions, including 
anaphylaxis  
 
o Management  
a. Administer H1 blocker (diphenhydramine, cetirizine recommended)  
b. Administer H2 blocker  
c. Meperidine may be used for rigors  
d. Can decrease rate of dinutuximab to 50% of the full rate if clinically indicated  
e. When symptoms resolve, if the rate has been reduced, resume original infusion 
rate 
f. If symptoms recur when original rate is resumed  (after a rate reduction ), decrease 
to 50% rate again  
g. Infusion must be stopped after 20 hours (whether th e full dose of dinutuximab has 
been administered or not); document total amount of drug given in the 20 hour time 
period  
 
 
 
 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   42 
 4.5.3.2 Moderate to severe  allergic reactions/infusion reactions to dinutuximab infusion  
 
o Moderate to severe reactions include any of the following: symptomatic bronchospasm, 
allergy -related edema/angioedema, hypotension, or anaphylaxis – Grade 3 or 4  
 
o The following recommendations  do NOT  apply to Grade 1 or 2 allergic reactions  
 
o Management  
a. Immediately hold dinutuximab  
b. Assess airway, breathing and circulation  
c. Follow institutional guidelines for rapid response team notification if clinically 
indicated  
 
d. For airway concerns  
• Administer oxygen and albuterol immediately for bronchospasm  
• Administer IV diphenhydramine  
• Administer epinephrine (1:1000 IM recommended) immediately if upper airway 
involved or if airway issues are accompanied by cardiovascular collapse  
• Administer IV hydr ocortisone (1 -2 mg/kg) if the patient has frank anaphylaxis 
with cardiorespiratory collapse OR if ≥ 2 doses of epinephrine are required OR 
if moderate to severe symptoms recur upon rechallenge with dinutuximab  
 
e. For hypotension in the setting of allergic re action  
• Give normal saline bolus (20 mL/kg as rapidly as possible)  
• Stop or adjust doses of narcotics and sedating H1 blockers  
• Consider use of Trendelenberg position  
• See previous section for management of persistent hypotension  
 
f. For patients with mild bronchospasm or angioedema that does not impact 
breathing, completely resolves without the use of epinephrine and hydrocortisone 
and for patients whose hypotension resolves following volume bolus, dinutuximab 
may be resumed at 50% of the previous rate of  infusion on the same day as the 
reaction occurred. If symptomatic angioedema or asymptomatic bronchospasm 
recurs when the dinutuximab is restarted, discontinue immunotherapy for that day 
and if symptoms/signs resolve completely that day, resume the next day  with 
additional premedication of hydrocortisone 1 -2 mg/kg IV. For this re -challenge, the 
infusion should be given in an ICU setting.  
 
g. For patients whose bronchospasm or angioedema requires the use of systemic 
epinephrine, protocol therapy should be disco ntinued.  
 
h. For patients with bronchospasm or angioedema that does not require systemic 
epinephrine but whose hypotension requires more extensive volume resuscitation, 
guidance in Section 4.5.2 should be followed.  
 
 
  
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   43 
 4.5.4  Management of capillary leak synd rome (≥ Grade 3) due to dinutuximab  
 
 *** Capillary leak syndrome should be managed aggressively.  
See Section 4.5.2 for management of hypotension, anemia and hypoalbuminemia  
 
o Hold dinutuximab infusion  
o Provide oxygen and fluids as needed  
o Consider use of albumin if albumin < 3 gm/dL, especially prior to diuretics  
o Consider use of PRBCs if Hb < 10 gm/dL  
o Do NOT resume dinutuximab therapy if symptoms of severe capillary leak syndrome persist 
on the same day or subsequent days of a given 4-day dinutuximab cycle . Only resume 
dinutuximab therapy when the capillary leak syndrome resolves or requires less significant 
intervention (Grade 2 or less).  
o If capillary leak resolves, may resume dinutuximab infusion at 50% rate the same day and for 
subsequent doses during a given 4-day dinutuximab cycle. The infusion may be given at the 
full rate at the start of the day 29 dose, or during course 2 when applicable . 
o If mechanical ventilation (any duration) or pressor support for ≥ 24 hours is required due to 
therapy -related capillary leak syndrome, the patient should discontinue protocol therapy.  
 
4.5.5  Management of renal insufficiency (unrelated to hypotension) while receiving dinutuximab  
 
o Consider the possibility of renal hypoperfusion in the context of bor derline hypotension; 
administer volume if appropriate  
o If the patient’s creatinine is elevated to ≥ 2 x the upper limit of normal for age/gender (see table 
in Section 3.2.9.2) and elevation persists despite optimized fluid management, hold 
dinutuxima b 
o Modify dosing of concomitant medications that may contribut e to or be affected by renal 
insufficiency  
o When creatinine returns to < 2 x upper limit of normal for age/gender, resume dinutuximab at 
50% rate. If renal function normalizes by the following day, dinutuximab may be administered 
at full rate. If renal func tion is not sufficiently improved  (creatinine  < 2x ULN for age/gender ) by 
the planned end date of the 4 -day dinutuximab cycle , no further dinutuximab should be given 
during that 4 day cycle of dinutuximab therapy. Subsequently, i f renal function meets  criteria to 
start the day 29 dinutuximab or a second course of therapy if applicable, retreatment with 
dinutuximab is permitted.  
 
4.5.6  Management of hyponatremia (≥ Grade 3; Na < 130 mEq/L) while receiving dinutuximab  
 
o Change hypotonic fluids to isotonic  fluids as compatibilities permit  
o Avoid administration of oral free water  
o Correct fluid losses due to diarrhea  
o 3% saline  as indicated  
o If Grade 4 hyponatremia occurs , discontinue dinutuximab. This will be considered a DLT and 
the patient will be taken off of protocol therapy.  
 
4.5.7  Management of fever in the absence of hypotension while receiving dinutuximab  
 
o Administer antipyretics  
o Adjust fluids to account for insensible losses if fever is persistent  
o For a temperature ≥ 39○ C, obtain a blood culture per institutional standards. Additional blood 
cultures are only needed for a positive blood culture or clinical decompensation (hypotension, 
concern for sepsis, etc.).  
o For temperature ≥ 39○ C, after drawing a blood culture, the decision whether to administer 
antibiotics will be determined by institutional guidelines. If the patient is neutropenic (ANC ≤ 
500), broad spectrum antibiotics should be administered per institutional guidelines for fe brile 
neutropenia.  If the patient has a positive blood culture, treat per institutional guidelines.  
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   44 
 4.5.8  Management of treatment -related pain due to dinutuximab  
 
o No further dinutuximab therapy should be given to pa tients who experience treatment -related 
pain that cannot be controlled by narcotics. Treatment with gabapentin or similar agent should 
be initiated if not already being administered. If pain that is not controlled with narcotics recurs 
during a subsequent 4-day dinutuximab cycle, the patient shou ld discontinue protocol therapy  
 
o For patients with treatment -related pain requiring intravenous narcotics for ≥ 48 hours following 
completion of dinutuximab therapy, gabapentin or similar agent should be initiated if not already 
being administered. If pain  requiring prolonged intravenous narcotics (≥48 hours following 
completion of dinutuximab therapy) recurs during a subsequent 4-day dinutuximab cycle 
despite this intervention, the patient should discontinue protocol therapy.  
 
4.5.9  Management of visual changes due to dinutuximab  
 
Occasionally, dinutuximab may cause impaired accommodation and/or dilated pupils with sluggish 
light reflex +/ - photophobia. If this occurs, no modifications, dose reductions, or changes in infusion 
rate should be made unless there is vision loss . If the patient experiences vision loss or a grade 4 
event then dinutuximab should be stopped and protocol therapy should be discontinued.  
 
4.5.10 Management of serum sickness due to dinutuximab  
 
o Identification of serum sickness – signs and symptoms include  arthralgias/arthritis, 
splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, glomerulonephritis in the presence of persistent fevers, 
cutaneous eruptions  
o Serum sicknes s typically develops 1 to 3 weeks after administration of the causative agent, but 
can develop within 12 -36 hours in patients who have previously been sensitized to the 
causative agent  
o Patients with ≥ Grade 3 serum sickness should discontinue protocol ther apy and receive 
appropriate treatment for this condition.  
o For Grade 2 serum sickness, antihistamines should be prescribed.  
 
4.5.11 Management of neurotoxicity due to dinutuximab  
o Patients who develop Grade 4 neurotoxicity should discontinue protocol therapy.  
o Dinutuximab should be discontinued for the remainder of the current treatment course (8 -11 or 
29-32) of therapy for patients who develop Grade 3 sensory neuropathy or Grade 3 motor 
neuropathy. If this occurs during Days 8 -11, gabapentin or a simi lar agent should be initiated if 
not already being administered. If abnormalities resolve by the start of the next course of 
dinutuximab (either Day 29 or the start of the second course if applicable) the patient may 
receive dinutuximab at full dose. If s ymptoms do not completely resolve or recur with 
dinutuximab then the patient should discontinue protocol therapy.  
 
4.5.12  Management of GM -CSF related toxicities  
 
o Hold GM -CSF if total white blood cell count is > 50,000/µL; resume at 50% dose when the 
count is < 20,000/µL. Administer full dose subsequent ly (starting with Day 29 dose or with the 
second course if applicable) and modify again if the count exceeds 50,000/µL. If GM -CSF is 
being used for neutropenia following 131I-MIBG then full dose should be used.  
o Localized skin reactions to GM -CSF are common, and GM -CSF can be continued when 
reactions are mild. Rotation of sites of injections is recommended rather than use of insuflon 
for subcutaneous injection when skin reactions occur. Consider use of antihistamines. If ≥ 
Grade 3 injection site reactions occur, stop GM -CSF and discontin ue all subsequent GM-CSF 
doses . 
 
o A syndrome characterized by respiratory distress, hypoxia, flushing, hypotension, syncope, 
and/or tachycardia has been reported following the administration of the first dose of GM -CSF 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   45 
 in a particular cycle. This syndrome g enerally resolves with symptomatic treatment and usually 
does not recur with subsequent doses of GM -CSF. For safety purposes in this study, if such a 
“first dose reaction” occurs, the GM -CSF dose will be reduced to 50% for the next dose (i.e., 
GM-CSF dose 125 mcg/m2). If a similar reaction occurs at the 50% dose, the GM -CSF will be 
discontinued for that patient. If the first dose at 50% does not cause any recurrent severe 
symptoms, subsequent doses can be escalated back to 100%. If recurrent severe symptoms  
are observed at 100% dose, then the dose will be reduced to 50%. If 50% is tolerated, that 
dose should be administered for all subsequent protocol treatment for that patient. If recurrent 
severe symptoms are seen at the 50% dose, the GM -CSF will be discon tinued.  
 
4.6 Dose Modifications for Vorinostat   
Any dose modification of vorinostat should be reported to the study chair and to the NANT Operations 
Center . Vorinostat will NOT be held for hematologic toxicity  unless patients become platelet 
transfusion refractory while receiving vorinostat .  
 
4.6.1  Patients who develop Grade 4 neutropenia while receiving vorinostat will continue to receive 
vorinostat at the prescribed dose and schedule . GM-CSF can be initiate d early per Section 4. 2.4.2  
once the patient  clear s radiation isolation . If GM -CSF is started prior to the Day 8 dinutuximab dose, 
the GM -CSF should still be continued at least until the Day 17 GM -CSF dose, i.e. the patient should 
still receive the full 10 doses of GM -CSF associated with the Day 8 dinutuximab dose.  
 
4.6.2 Patients who develop Grade 4 thromboc ytopenia while receiving vorinostat will continue to receive

begin earlier than  3 weeks from the start of the most recent 4 day dinutuximab infusion.  No 
protocol defined dose limiting toxicity in first course of therapy Section 4.4);  
• Disease response of stable disease or better at end of first course ( Section 1 1.0); 
• Grade 3 vision toxicity due to pupillary dilation and/or accommodation defects must be stable 
to improved.  
 
4.8 Concomitant Therapy  
• Immunosuppressive drugs (other than corticosteroids used to treat side effects of protocol 
therapy) are not allowed during protocol therapy. Dexamethasone should be avoided as an 
anti-nausea/anti emetic therapy.  
• Corticosteroid therapy should be utilized only for life threatening conditions.  
• No other cancer chemotherapy, immunomodulating agents, or biologics can be used during 
protocol therapy.  
• External beam r adiation therapy can NOT  be used during protocol therapy.  
• Appropriate antibiotics, blood products, anti -emetics, fluids, electrolytes a nd general supportive 
care are to be used as necessary for good patient care.  
• No medications that interfere with MIBG uptake should be given while patient is receiving 
protocol therapy.  
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   46 
 • IVIG should not be give n while patient is receiving protocol therapy.   
• No other investigational agents may be given while the patient is receiving protocol therapy.  
• Patients on Part B  may not receive valproic acid until disease re -evaluation following the last 
planned course of therapy has been completed.  
• Patients on Part B  may not receive other medications known to prolong the QTc interval within 
1 week prior to or 1 week following vorinostat (Appendix VII; note that this list pro hibits the use 
of pentamidine and cautions investigators with the use of ondansetron).  
• Vorinostat treatment may result in mild increases in serum creatinine. Caution should be 
exercised with the use of nephrotoxic medications while patients are receiving vorinostat.

5.0 SUPPORTIVE CARE  
 
5.1   Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis Jiroveci  Pneumonia  (PJP)  
All patients must receive prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci  pneumonia (PJP) using Bactrim 
or other appropriate agent according to institutional guidelines.  
 
5.2 Use of Myeloid Growth Factors  
See Section 4.2. 4.  It is strongly recommended that GM -CSF be the only growth factor used 
on this study.  The use of filgrastim (G -CSF) or peg -filgrastim, even if the patient experiences 
febrile neutropenia, is strongly discouraged.  
 
5.3 Antiemetics  
 Dexamethasone should not be used as anti -nausea / antiemetic therapy.  The use of 
 alternative anti -emetics will be at the investigator’s discretion.  Symptomatic patients should be 
 treated with standard anti -nausea /  antiemetic therapy such as ondansetr on or an 
 appropriate serotonin antagonist as necessary.  
  
5.4 Fever During MIBG  
Patients who develop a fever as defined by institutional guidelines during the first   
24 hours after the 131I-MIBG infusion should be given a single dose of ceftriaxone  or ap propriate 
substitute  without sending a blood culture or other labs, as blood cannot be safely sent to the lab 
during this time due to radioactivity. If the patient is neutropenic, has an allergy to cephalosporins , 
or there is clinical concern for a more severe infection , alternative antibiotics can be used  per 
institutional guidelines . The need for subsequent antibiotics will be determined based on blood 
culture results, clinical status, and presence/absence of neutropenia. For fever that occurs > 24  
hours after the 131I-MIBG infusion, institutional guidelines for fever in the non -neutropenic or 
neutropenic patient may be utilized.  
 
5.5  Supportive Care During Dinutuximab  Therapy  
  Most laboratory findings in patients receiving dinutuximab are trans ient during therapy and can be 
corrected with appropriate supportive care.  Consider keeping albumin > 3 g/dL by infusing with 
1gm/kg of 25% albumin. In addition, consider keeping hemoglobin >10 g/dL to help support 
intravascular volume.  
 
5.6 Other  
 Unless  specifically excluded by the protocol, additional supportive care measures should be 
 utilized as needed to provide good patient care.

 6.2 Dinutuximab (Chimeric Monoclonal Antibody 14.18; Chimeric MOAB 14.18; human/murine 
 anti-GD2 monoclonal  antibody; chimeric anti -GD2; chimeric mAb 14.18; ch14.18; 
 Unituxin®) NSC# 764038  
 
6.2.1 Source and Pharmacology  
Dinutuximab is an anti -GD2 monoclonal antibody composed of the variable region heavy and light 
chain genes of the murine mAb 14.G2a and the human constant region genes for heavy chain IgG1 
and light chain kappa. Dinutuximab exerts its antitumor effect by binding specifically to the 
disialoganglioside GD2, an antigen found in human tumors of neuroectodermal origin such as 
melanoma and neuroblas toma. This chimeric antibody has been shown to lyse melanoma and 
neuroblastoma cells through the process of antibody -dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity  (ADCC)  
and complement -dependent cytotoxicity  (CDC) . By targeting the GD2 antigen on the cell surface, 
dinutuximab may also prevent attachment of circulating malignant cells to the extracellular matrix. 
Additionally, dinutuximab mediates lysis of several melanoma and neuroblastoma cell lines in a 
dose dependent manner in the presence of potent mediators of ch14.18 -dependent cytotoxicity, 
such as human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and granulocytes. This is most profound with 
neutrophils, especially in the presence of recombinant human granulocyte -macrophage colony -
stimulating factor.  
 
The PK profile of ch14.18 has been determined in adults with melanoma and children with 
neuroblastoma. Although the plasma clearance for both groups of patients follow a two -
compartment model, circulating antibody is cleared from the plasma at a much faster rate in 
children  than adults (mean t ½β = 66.6 ± 27.4 hours in children versus 123 ± 29 hours and 181 ± 73 
hours in two adult trials, respectively). Maturation of the hepatic and renal systems with age is 
thought to impact on drug metabolism and elimination and could accou nt for these differences. In 
general, the mAb half -life following the first course of treatment was longer than the half -lives 
following subsequent courses in a given patient.

 6.3 SARGRAMOSTIM (Granulocyte Macrophag e Colony Stimulating Factor, rhu GM -CSF, rGM -
 CSF, GM -CSF, Leukine®) NSC #613795  
 
6.3.1 Source and Pharmacology  
Sargramostim (recombinant human GM -CSF) is a glycoprotein produced in yeast (S. cerevisiae) 
by recombinant DNA technology. rGM -CSF is a hematopo ietic growth factor which supports 
survival, clonal expansion, and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. rGM -CSF induces 
partially committed progenitor cells to divide and differentiate in the granulocyte -macrophage 
pathways. rGM -CSF stimulate s the production of monocytes, granulocytes, erythrocytes, and 
sometimes, megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. It also induces mature neutrophil and monocytes 
to increase phagocytosis, superoxide generation, ADCC, tumoricidal killing and cytokine production 
(IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor). Recombinant human GM -CSF is a glycoprotein of 127 amino 
acids characterized by three primary molecular masses of 15500, 16800, and 19500 daltons. The 
amino acid sequence differs from the natural sequence by a substitution of leucine at position 23 
and the CHO moiety may be different from the native protein. After subcutaneous administration of 
sargramostim, peak levels were obtained in 1 -4 hours and were detectable at therapeutic levels for 
12-16 hours post injection. The e limination t ½ ranges from 1.5 -2.7 hours after SQ or IV 
administration.

Sargramostim is available as a lyophilized sterile, white, preservative free powder with 250 mcg 
(1.4 million International Units) per vial and as a sterile, preserved injectable solution in a 500 
mcg/mL (2.8 million International Units/mL) 1 mL vial. The sargramostim reconstituted lyophilized 
vial contains 40 mg/mL mannitol, USP; 10 mg/mL sucrose, NF; and 1.2 mg/mL tromethamine, USP, 
as excipients. The liquid formulation also contains 1.1% benzyl alcohol (11 mg/mL). Store 
refrigerated at 2 -8°C (36 -46°F). Do not freeze or shake.  
 
6.3.4 Guidelines for Administration  
See Treatment, Dose Modifications, and Supportive Care sections of the protocol.  
 
Reconstitute lyophilized powder for injection with 1 mL SWFI o r 1 mL Bacteriostatic Water for 
Injection. Use SWFI without benzyl alcohol for neonates, infants, and children < 2 years of age or 
patients with hypersensitivity to benzyl alcohol. During reconstitution, direct the diluent at the side 
of the vial and gentl y swirl the contents to avoid foaming during dissolution. Avoid excessive or 
vigorous agitation; do not shake. Reconstituted solutions prepared with Bacteriostatic Water for 
Injection (0.9% benzyl alcohol) or the liquid preserved solution may be stored for  up to 20 days 
following the first entry into the vial at 2° -8°C (36° -46°F). Discard reconstituted solution after 20 
days have elapsed. Reconstituted solutions prepared with SWFI (without preservative) should be 
administered as soon as possible and within 6 hours following reconstitution.  
 
Use sargramostim for subcutaneous injection without further dilution. Perform dilution for IV infusion 
in NS. If the final concentration is < 10 mcg/mL, add albumin (human) at a final concentration of 
0.1% to the saline p rior to addition of sargramostim to prevent adsorption to the components of the 
drug delivery system. For a final concentration of 0.1% albumin (human), add 1 mg albumin 
(human) per 1 mL NS. For example, for a final volume of 50 mL NS, add 50 mg (or 1 mL) of 5% 
albumin [human]. Intravenous dilutions are stable for up to 48 hours at room temperature or 
refrigerated but should be used within 6 hours due to microbiological concerns. Do not use an in -
line membrane filter for IV infusion.  
 
6.3.5 Supplier  
Sargramostim is commercially available in the U.S and so will be obtained from commercial supply. 
See package insert for more detailed information. Only sargramostim (yeast -derived recombinant 
human GM -CSF) will be used in this study. The Escherichia coli -derived product (molgramostim) 
will not be used.

6.5 VORINOSTAT (ZOLINZA™)  
 
6.5.1 Structure and Molecular Weight  
The chemical names for vorinostat are N -hydroxy -N’-phenyl -octane -1,8-diotic acid diamide or N -
hydroxylN’ -phenyl (9CI) octanediamide. The molecular formula is: C14H20N203. The molecular weight is 
264.32.  
 
6.5.2 Description  
Vorinostat is a histone deacetyl ase (HDAC) inhibitor. HDACs are a group of proteins that regulate gene 
transcription by affecting the acetylation status of histones. Vorinostat binds to the catalytic pocket of HDAC 
enzymes and inhibits their activity.  
 
6.5.3 Supplier   
Vorinostat is comm ercially available in the U.S. and so will be obtained from  commercial supply . See 
package insert for more detailed information.  
 
6.5.4 Guidelines for Administration and Compounding   
Vorinostat is administered orally or via NG tube or G -tube. Vorinostat sh ould be taken with food or within 
30 minutes after a meal. The dose should be taken in the morning whenever possible. Altered taste and 
decreased food and liquid intake are associated with vorinostat administration. These toxicities can be 
actively managed  with fluid management and nutritional consult  and support . During the period of vorinostat 
administration, patients are recommended to consume adequate fluid daily to prevent dehydration. Patient 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   56 
 may require electrolyte replacement. Early use of anti -emet ics is encouraged. If a patient vomits within 15 
minutes of vorinostat dose administration, the patient should be re -dosed. If the patient vomits after the 
second dose, the patient should not be re -dosed again. If a patient vomits more than 15 minutes from  dose 
administration, the patient should not be re -dosed.  If patients experience dysgeusia, popsicles or Gatorade 
may be successful in maintaining oral intake. Missed doses may be made up provided there is at least 24 
hours between vorinostat and infusion of stem cells, and stem cell infusio n is not delayed beyon d Day 17. 
Vorinostat should not be administered after stem cell infusion regardless of the number of doses received. 
Patients should not exceed 14 total dos es of vorinostat for any reason. P atients should not double -up on 
missed doses during treatment .  
 
Patients will receive vorinostat as a liquid suspension or as capsules. Capsules can be used only for 
patients with a calculated dose within +/ - 10% of a 100 mg dosing increment (e .g. 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 
mg, or 400 mg).  
 
The COG phase I study of vorinosta t, NANT  2007-03, and NANT  2011-01 all used the following formula for 
preparing a liquid suspension with a final vorinostat concentration of 50 mg/mL.  
 
Required components  
Vorinostat 100 mg capsules (20)  
OraPlus or Suspensol S 20 mL  
OraSweet 20 mL  
 
Instructions  
Add 20 mL of Suspensol S or OraPlus into an amber or clear glass 4 ounce bottle. Place the contents of 
20 capsules of vorinostat 100 mg into the same bottle and shake to disperse. Shaking may tak e up to 3 
minutes. Once dispersed, add 20 mL of OraSweet to achieve a total volume of 40 mL. Shake again to 
disperse. Final concentration is 50 mg/mL. Store at room temperature. The suspension is stable for 4 weeks 
when stored at room temperature, away fro m excessive heat and humidity. The suspension should not be 
mixed with food or beverages.  
If there are any issues with ability to compound, please contact NANT Operations at nantcrf@chla.usc.edu.  
 
The maximum daily dose of vorinostat on this protocol is 4 00 mg.  
 
6.5.5 Potential Drug Interactions  
The major pathways of vorinostat metabolism involve glucuronidation and β -oxidation. As vorinostat is not 
eliminated via CYP450 pathways, no drug -drug interactions are expected with known CYP450 inhibitors or 
inducers.  
 
Although vorinostat is not a potent  reversible CYP450 inhibitor, studies performed to monitor gene 
expression changes indicated some potential for CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 activity suppression. However, 
these changes were observed at concentrations higher than the pharmacologically relevant concen tration.  
 
6.5.6 Special Handling  
Vorinostat is an anticancer drug. Clean powder spills from broken or damaged vorinostat capsules carefully 
minimizing inhalation. Wash spill area at least 3 times with ethyl alcohol, followed by water.  
 
6.5.7 Patient Car e Implications  
Because vorinostat’s dose limiting toxicities in previous studies included anorexia, dehydration, diarrhea, 
and fatigue, patients should maintain adequate fluid and food intake.  
 
6.5.8 Toxicity  
The most common drug -related adverse reactions can be classified into  4 symptom complexes: 
gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, anorexia, weight decrease, vomiting, constipation), 
constitutional symptoms (fatigue, chills), hematologic abnormalities (thr ombocytopenia, anemia), and 
taste disorders (dysgeusia, dry mouth). The most common serious drug -related adverse reactions were 
pulmonary embolism and anemia.  
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   57 
  
Serious Adverse Reactions  
The most common serious adverse reactions in the 86 Cutaneous T C ell Lymphoma patients in  two 
clinical trials were pulmonary embolism reported in  4.7% (4/86)  of  patients, squamous cell  carcinoma 
reported in  3.5% (3/86)  of  patients and anemia  reported in  2.3%  (2/86)  of  patients. There were single 
events of  cholecystitis, death (of unknown  cause), deep vein thrombosis, enterococcal infection, 
exfoliative dermatitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, infection, lobar pneumonia, myocardial infarction, 
ischemic stroke, pelviureteric obstruction, sepsis, spinal cor d injury,  streptococcal bacteremia, syncope, 
T-cell lymphoma, thrombocytopenia and ureteric obstruction.

vorinostat remains 
undetermined)  
 
Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, ZOLINZA can cause fetal harm  
when administered to a pregnant woman  
 
Note: Vorinostat in combination with other agents could cause an exacerbation of any adverse 
event  currently known to be caused by the other agent, or the combination may result in events 
never  previously associated w ith either agent.

1. Required for verification of eligibility. An eligibility checklist is available and may be used as a source document with PI 
signature or by uploading directly into patient EMR.  
2. Tumor imaging = CT and/or MRI (Chest, abdomen, pelvis) plus CT/MRI imaging of an y other sites with MIBG uptake for 
optimum visualization of all areas of bulk tumor (primary & metastasis)  excluding extremities .  If patient has a history of 
tumor lesions in the skull, orbits or brain, OR if MIBG scan shows uptake in these same areas, th en a CT or MRI of the 
brain/orbits is strongly suggested. MRI is the recommended imaging technique for patients with epidural or hepatic tumor 
lesions.  FDG -PET is required if used at baseline to document evaluable soft tissue tumor lesion(s) for response.   123I-
MIBG scans are preferred for disease status evaluation . SPECT is required on this study.  All patients are required to 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   60 
 have a diagnostic bone marrow sent with each disease evaluation.   All disease status tests must be performed within 28 
days prior to study entry and subsequent to any intervening therapy  
3. Vital signs should be done more frequently when indicated per Section 4.2 and for good patient care. Examinations may 
be performed +/ - 2 days for D15, D36 and D43. Height and BSA only needed at screening, Day 29 of Course 1 and 2, 
and prior to Course 2.  
4. Continue twice weekly ( required once during week of 131I-MIBG infusion (Day 1 – Day 7) until ANC > =500 cells/μL and 
platelet  count > = 20,000 cells/μL x 3 days without transfusion , and then obtain weekly through the end of the course .    
5. Obtain for females 10 years of age and older or post -pubertal.  Women of childbearing potential require  a negative 
pregnancy test prior to starting treatment  (Course 1 & Course 2) .  Male and female subjects of reproductive age and 
childbearing potential must agree to use two acceptable methods of birth control (i.e., a hormonal contraceptive, intra -
uterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) or to abstain from heterosexual 
intercourse for the duration of their participation in the study.  
6. The end of course evaluations  (clinical labs, echocardi ogram, electrocardiogram, correlative studies)  are to be performed 
between Days 46 - 57 except for disease status evaluation (tumor imaging by CT/MRI and bilateral bone marrow 
aspirate/biopsy) which may be performed between Days 43 and 57 of each course.  In case of treatment delays with 
dinutuximab during Course 1, t he time interval between performing end of Course 1 disease evaluation and administration 
of Course 2 131I-MIBG is not to exceed 4 weeks.  Urine catecholamines are no longer required as part of patient disease 
status evaluation submitted to NANT Operation s Center and may be obtained at investigator discretion.  
7. The patient will remain in a radiation protected isolation room until radiation emissions meet institutional/state guidelines , 
but at least until the radiation level is < 7 mRem/hr at 1 meter. Radiat ion levels will be measured at least once daily until 
the patient is cleared by Radiation Safety using a handheld monitor standing at a distant of one meter from the patient.  
8. See Section 4.2.1. 7 for dosimetry guidelines.   
9. If total bilirubin result ≥ Grade 3 then fractionate and obtain a direct bilirubin along with total bilirubin until total bilirubin ≤ 
Grade 2.  
10. One EKG to be obtained prior to Day 8 dinutuximab dose. Patient must have a QTc interval ≤ 480 msec  prior to proceeding 
with Day 8 dinutuximab dose (Part B only; see Section 4.2.3. 3). 
11. Part B only  
12. Part A only  
 
7.2 Recommended Follow -Up Observations  
 The following are recommendations only, but may be altered at discretion of treating physician. 
Repeat the following if abnormal on a monthly basis until stable or normalized after the end of 
therapy. If normal at the end of therapy then repeat only as cli nically indicated:  
• History, physical exam (Ht, Wt, VS)  
• CBC/Differential, Platelets, AST, ALT, Bilirubin, BUN, Creatinine  
• T4, TSH and MIBG scan every 3 months until 1 year post treatment, then every 6 months until 
progression, death or other therapy.  
  
 After completion of protocol therapy, the disease status, sites of relapse, and last alive date will be 
recorded until first relapse/progression or until patient receives another non -protocol therapy, after 
which only last alive date will be reported, as w ell as date of death and cause of death (if applicable).  
 
 
7.3  Documentation of Tumor Response  
 Patients will undergo complete disease re -staging between Day 43 and Day 57 of each course of 
therapy.   If there are treatment delays during Course 1, disea se restaging after Course 1 may be 
delayed.  This delay is not to exceed 4 weeks before the start of Course 2.   It is recommended that 
all scans and tests previously done to document tumor lesions be performed in subsequent 
evaluations of disease status.   
 
 All patients will have diagnostic bone marrows performed with each disease evaluation, regardless 
of involvement at study registration.  To confirm a bone marrow response of CR, an additional bone 
marrow examination for morphology (for a total of 2 bon e marrow exams) must be done a minimum 
of three weeks apart ( Section 1 1.0).  
 
 Once a patient receives therapy other than prescribed on this protocol, no further scans or bone 
marrow evaluations will be required for this protocol since the patient will no longer be evaluable for 
response to dinutuximab and 131I-MIBG.  
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   61 
  
8.0 CORRELATIVE  BIOLOGY STUDIES  (See Appendix  II) 
Collection of samples for correlative biology studies is to be performed during the first course of 
therapy  only. If the scheduled start of the first day of dinutuximab infusions on Day 8 and /or Day 
29 are delayed, then the corresponding Day 8 and /or Day 29 biologic correlate sampling should 
also be delayed until the first day of dinutuximab infusion  is given . The Day 15 biologic correlates 
should be obtained  BEFORE stem cell infusion.  
 
NOTE:  It is strongly encouraged to begin 131I-MIBG on Tuesday – Thursday to allow biologic 
correlates to be received at the processing laboratory on a Wednesday – Friday.  Please 
contact the NANT Operations Center/ Study Chairperson if treatment is delayed and will not 
start on a Tuesday – Thursday s chedule.   
  
8.1 Characterization of Immune and Cytokine Profile Following 131I-MIBG Therapy  (Required)  
We will obtain preliminary data regarding the number of T, B, and NK cells present in the circulation 
at baseline and after treatment with 131I-MIBG , and will also perform a more detailed analysis of NK 
cells. This T -B-NK panel quantifies these cells using flow cytometry. We will also freeze  additional 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for future immunophenotyping studies . The additional 
PBMCs will be obtained from the blood collected for the cytokine profiling studies as detailed below 
in Section 8.1. 2.2. 
 
Below is the panel that we will test by flow cytometry:  
 
Lineage 
Panel  Live/Dead  (L/D) , CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD14, CD45RA, 
CD197, CD25, CD127, HLA -DR 
NK Cell 
Panel  L/D, CD45, CD3, CD8, CD16, CD56, CD57, CD107a, CD158, 
CD314, CD335  
 
We will also evaluate the pro -inflammatory cytokines that may augment the effects of 
immunotherapy , stimulate an immune -mediated anti-tumor response , and help establish the TME . 
The key cytokines and chemokines that will be analyzed are included below . This testing will be 
performed using a multiplex cytokine array on a Luminex platform.

%Day 36 labs should be collected four days post last dose of dinutuximab  
 
8.5.2 Sample Processing and Labeling  
 
• Gently invert PAXgene tube 8 -10 times after collection. Keep tube at room temperature for 2 – 
72 hours and then freeze upright in a wire rack (NOT STYROFOAM HOLDER) for 24 hrs at -
20○C and then transfer to -70○C or -80○C freezer until ready to batch ship at the completi on of 
the study.  
o It is strongly suggested that each PAXgene tube be placed in a ziplock bag to avoid 
losing the sample if the PAXgene tube bursts during freezing.  Contact the Study 
Chairperson if this event occurs.  
 
• Label PAXgene tubes in the following manner:  
o Patient’s NANT Registration Number (N0xxx)  
o Study identifier:  
▪ RNA  
o Date and time blood was drawn  
o Protocol sampling time point (ie: Screening, Day 8 etc .)

8.5.3 Shipping  
 All samples will be stored frozen at N ANT site and batch shipped at the end of Course 1 . 
 Refer to Section 8.3 for shipping instructions  and address . 
 
8.6 Isolation of DNA for Future Gene Expression Studies  (Optional)  
 In consenting patients, two 250µL  aliquots (approximately 0.25  mL) of whole blood  previously 
 collected for immune profiling by flow cytometry ( Section 8.1.2.1) will be processed and stored at 
 Emory University. No  additional blood needs to be drawn from  the patient to perform these 
 studies.  
 
8.7 Storage of Remaining Biologic Samples for Future Analysis (Optional)  
The NANT Biology Study (N ANT 2004 -05) provides a mechanism to allow for banking of biologic 
specimens collected through other NANT protocols. Consenting patients  will be asked to allow  
storage/banking of samples leftover from correlative testing on this study for future analysis to 
address scientific questions related to 131I-MIBG, dinutuximab, neuroblastoma or other childhood 
cancers.   A decision to perform such exploratory research studies would be based on outcome 
data from this study or from new scientific findings related to the d rugs or disease.  
 
8.8 Evaluation of the Tumor Microenvironment  (Optional)  
In consenting patients,  archival tumor tissue from the most recent biopsy of a soft tissue lesion 
obtained prior to study registration will be collected from those  patients  who have adequate tumor 
tissue  to submit . We will use this tissue to  evaluat e the tumor microenvironment  (TME) . Tumor 
samples wil l be evaluated for the presence of TILs and TAMs, as well as the immune checkpoint 
proteins CD274 (PDL1) and CD276 (B7H3) by immunohistochemistry. We will also perform 
RNAseq and exome sequencing to evaluate for immune response genes.  Three mL of peripher al 
blood will be drawn for germline DNA and the tumor sequencing will be interpreted in the context 
of these results.  
 
For consenting patients, in the future, if a biopsy is performed for clinical reasons prior to starting 
therapy subsequent to this  protocol treatment , we will request that  tumor tissue  be submitted.  This 
tumor tissue will be analyzed for changes in the TME that occur as a consequence of the 131I-MIBG 
+ dinutuximab therapy, and will be compared to pre -study samples  when available . 
 
8.8.1 Sample Requirements  
Coordinate to collect blood so blood and tumor may be shipped together at the same time.  
 
• Collect 3  mL peripheral blood in purple top (EDTA) tube.  This sample must arrive in the CHLA 
lab NO LATER THAN 48 hours after it was drawn.  
o Confirm there is tumor specimen available that can meet the sampling 
requirements  below  prior to arranging for blood to be drawn.    
• One FFPE block; OR  
• 10 tissue scrolls 15 µm thick AND 10 -25 unstained slides  
If scrolls AND slides are submitted, they should be cut sequentially from one 
representative block. 
 
  
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   68 
 8.8.2 Sample Labeling

10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
 
Part A:  This is a Phase I trial with a dose escalation portion using a Rolling 6  design , followed by a brief 
expansion cohort of 6 evaluable patients at the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D).  
 
Part B : Enrollment to Part B of the study will not begin until enrollment of the Part A expansion 
cohort is complete. Part B  will test 1 dose level of vorinostat  with a de -escalation dose level if needed, 
using  a Rolling 6 , Phase 1 trial  design . This will be followed by a brief expansion cohort of 6 evaluable 
patients at the RP2D.   
 
 
10.1 Sample Size and Study Duration  
 
10.1.1  Part A  
A maximum of four dose levels is planned for this part of the study (see Table in  
Section 4.3 .1).  Dose Level 1 (12 mCi/kg dose of 131I-MIBG and 17.5 mg/m2/dose of dinutuximab) will be 
the starting dose; in Dose Levels 2 and 3, the dose of 131I-MIBG will be escalated to 15 and then 18 mCi/kg, 
with the dose of dinutuximab fixed at 17.5 mg/m2/dose.  If the starting dose level (Dose Level 1) is not 
tolerated (i.e. 2+ patients experience DLT), then 3 -6 subsequent patients will be enrolled to Dose Level 0, 
which keeps the 131I-MIBG dose at 12 mCi/kg, but reduces the dinutuximab dose to 14 mg/m2/dose.  
 
A minimum of 3 (or 2 if the 1st 2 patients at a dose level experience DLT) and maximum of 6 patients 
evaluable for toxicity (as defined in Section 10.2.1) will be entered at each dose level. Once the final 
MTD/RP2D has been determined, a  maximum of 6 additional DLT-evaluable patients will be enrolled at the 
MTD/RP2D.  The number of evaluable patients needed during the expansion will be determined when  a 
robust cohort , treated at the MTD/RP2D , has been established to des cribe toxicity, response, and immune 
correlated data . Thus a minimum of 4 DLT-evaluable patients (if the 1st 2 patients at Dose Level 1 
experience DLT and the 1st 2 patients at Dose Level 0 experience DLT) and a maximum of 30 DLT-
evaluable patients (if 6 DLT-evaluable  patients are enrolled at all 4 dose levels and Dose Level 0 is the 
MTD:  4x6+6=30) could be enrolled on this study.  Based on NANT 17 -1 enrollments to date  and 20% -30% 
patients may be DLT -inevaluable , we anticipat e that 30 to 32 patients will be enrolled.  
 
Review of accrual to previous NANT studies indicates that up to 15 patients per year should be accrued ; 
however, given  that NANT 11 -01 will be open concurrently,  and there will be study closures for dose level 
evaluation, we anticipate that it will take  3 years  to complete this part of the study , i.e. about 10  patients per 
year accrual.  
 
10.1.2  Part B  
A maximum of two dose levels is planned for this part of the study (see Table in  
Section 4.3 .2).  Dose Level 4 (180 mg/ m2/dose  of vorinostat, 17.5 mg/m2/dose of dinutuximab , and 18 
mCi/kg/dose 131I-MIBG) will be the starting dose. If the s tarting dose level (Dose Level 4 ) is not tolerated 
(i.e. 2+ patients experience DLT), then 3 -6 subsequent patients will be enrolled to Dose Level 4a, which 
keeps the 131I-MIBG  (18 mCi/k g/dose ) and dinutuximab ( 17.5 mg/m2/dose ) dose the same, but reduces the 
vorinostat dose to 150 mg/ m2/dose .  
 
A minimum of 3 (or 2 if the 1st 2 patients at a dose level experience DLT) and maximum of 6 DLT-evaluable  
patients evaluable for toxicity (as defined in Section 10.2.1) will be entered at  each dose level. Once the 
final MTD/RP2D has been determined, an additional 6 DLT-evaluable  patients will be enrolled at the 
MTD/RP2D.  Thus a minimum of 4 DLT-evaluable  patients (if the 1st 2 patients at Dose Level 4 experience 
DLT and the 1st 2 patients  at Dose Level 4a experience DLT) and a maximum of 18 DLT-evaluable  patients 
(if 6 DLT-evaluable  patients are enrolled at both dose levels and Dose Level 4a is the MTD:  2x6+6= 18) 
could be enrolled on this study.  We anticipate that 15 to 18 patients will be enrolled , based on the NANT 
17-1 enrollments to date that 20%-30% patients may be DLT -inevaluable . 
 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   71 
 NANT 2017-01 was opened to accrual in September  of 2018 , and 20 patients have been enrolled since 
that time, i.e. ~ 10 patients per year ac crual. Based on this, we anticipate that it will take 1.5 to 2 years  to 
complete this part of the study . 
 
10.2  Definitions  
10.2.1  Evaluable for Inclusion in Dose Escalation Consideration  (i.e. “DLT -Evaluable”)  
Dose escalation considerations will be based on Course 1 data only. Toxicity will be assessed and 
reported on all patients who begin protocol  therapy. The definition of DLT is given in Section 4.4.   
 
Part A Dose Escalation Cohort:  A patient will be considered evaluable for inclusion in dose 
escalation/expansion/de -escalation decisions if he/she has received at least 90% of the assigned 
dose of 131I-MIBG, and at least 80% of the assigned doses of dinutuximab and GM -CSF during 
Course one AND are followed  until Day 57 or until platelet and neutrophil engraftment ( defined  in 
Section 4.5.2.1 ), whichever occurs last. In addition, patients who experience DLT at any time after 
the first dose of dinutuximab  are evaluable for inclusion in dose  escalation consideration. Toxicity 
will be assessed and reported on all patients who begin protocol therapy.  
 
Part A Dose Expansion and Part B Cohorts:  A patient will be considered evaluable for inclusion 
in dose escalation/expansion/de -escalation decisions if he/she has received at least 90% of the 
assigned dose of 131I-MIBG, at least 80% of the assigned dose  of dinutuximab , and at least 78% of 
the assigned doses of vorinostat (at least 11 days; Part B only)  during Course one AND are followed 
without receiving any non -protocol therapy at least through  14 days after the last dose of 
dinutux imab  or until platelet and neutrophil engraftment ( defined  in Section 4.5.2.1)  or resolution of 
all non -hematologic toxicities at least possibly related to protocol therapy to ≤ Grade 2 , whichever 
occurs last. In addition, patients who experience DLT at an y time after the first dose of dinutuximab  
are evaluable for inclusion in dose escalation consideration s. Toxicity will be assessed and reported 
on all patients who begin protocol therapy.   
 
Patients who receive less than 90% of the assigned 131I-MIBG dose , less than 80% of the assigned 
dinutuximab  or GM-CSF doses  (Part A dose -escalation phase only) , or less than 78% of the 
assigned vorinostat doses (less than 11 days; Part B only)  for reasons other than toxicity AND/OR 
are not followed through 14 days after the last dose of dinutuximab  without receiving any non -
protocol therapy , or until platelet and neutrophil engraftment (defined in Section 4.5.2.1), or until 
resolution of all non -hematologic toxicities at least possibly related to protocol therapy to  
≤ Grade 2 , whichever occurs last will be replaced for the purposes of evaluating the dose level for 
dose escalation/de -escalation purposes, unless they  have DLT in first course.   
 
Certain adverse events associated with dinutuximab are known to occur and to be patient 
dependent . These will not be considered DLTs even if they result in treatment delays or skipped 
doses.  If doses are eliminated or treatment is terminated because of these toxicities, so that the 
patient is no longer DLT -evaluable, this patient will also be replaced. The number of these patients 
and toxicities will be evaluated by the study management committee and the incidence compared 
to standard dinutuximab therapy . 
 
Patients who do not meet definition of hematologic engraftment DLT ( Section 4.5.2.1) and begin 
other therapy prior to platelet and/or neutrophil engraftment will not be fully evaluable for 
hematologic toxicity and will be replaced.  
 
10.2.2  Evaluable for Response  
Eligible patients with measurable or evaluable disease (which will include all patients since the 
trial requi res that a patient have MIBG -avid disease at study entry) who (a) have received any 
dose of protocol therapy  and (b) have at least one evaluation of tumor status as mandated in 
required observations OR have tumor progression demonstrated on at least one parameter 
(CT/MRI, MIBG, or bone marrow) OR have clinical evidence of progression per treating physician 
OR who  die due to toxicity, will be classified as “evaluable for response”.  Patients who are not 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   72 
 evaluable for response will NOT be replaced.  Response will be described for all patients entered 
on study.  
 
All patients who are registered onto the study must be assessed for response to treatment, even if 
there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible. Each patient will be assigned 
one of the following categories (see Section 1 1.6): 
 
a. Complete Response  
b. Complete Response MD   
c. Partial Response  
d. Progressive Disease   
e. Stable Disease   
f. Stable Disease -Non-Target Lesions   
g. Minor Response  
h. Minimal Disease   
i. Not Evaluable   
j. No Progression   
k. Not Done   
 
All eligible patients who receive any amount of 131I-MIBG will be included in the initial , primary  
analysis of response. Patients in groups a through c will be classified as responders; patients in 
groups d through j will be classified as non -responders. In a second analysis, the proportion of 
responders (patients in gro ups a through c) will be calculated from the subset of patients who are 
evaluable for response (as defined above).  
 
10.2.3  Maximum tolerated dose (MTD)  
The MTD is the highest dose level tested at which 0/6 or 1/6 patients experience DLT (that is possibly, 
probably, or definitely related to the study drug(s) as defined in Section 4.5) with at least 2/3 or 2/6 
patients encountering DLT at the next higher dose.  If 0/6 or 1/6 patients experience DLT at the 3rd 
and highest dose level, then Dose Level 3 is the highest tested dose and will be called the MTD.  
 
10.2.4   Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D)  
The RP2D will be the MTD, pending comprehensive review of all toxicities (for example if the patient 
receives more t han one course). If the RP2D is not the MTD, then the protocol will be amended to 
explain the decision.  
 
10.3 Dose Escalation  
Toxicity will be graded using the CTCAE criteria, version 5.0 which can be downloaded from the 
CTEP home page (http://ctep.cancer.gov).  The definition of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is given in 
Section 4.5.  
 
10.3.1    Dose Levels 0, 1-3, 4, and 4a: 
 
This study will utilize the Rolling 6 design for dose escalation (81). This design is a modification of 
the classic 3+3 dose escalation strategy.  With this design, three to six patients can be concurrently 
enrolled onto a dose level, dependent upon (1) the number of patients enrolled at the current dose 
level, (2) the number of patients who have experienced DLT  at the current dose level, and (3) the 
number of patients entered but with toxicity data pending at the current dose level. Accrual at a 
dose level is suspended when a cohort of six has enrolled or when the study endpoints have been 
met. In order to facil itate the safe conduct of the Rolling 6 design, NANT operations and sites will 
remain in close contact to monitor occurrence of DLT in a timely fashion with increased reporting 
requirements from sites and study committee oversight.  
 
The rules for the Rolli ng 6 design are as follow s: 
- At each dose level, up to 6  patients can be enrolled.    
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   73 
 o Unless 2+ patients experience DLT, a minimum of 3 patients will be enrolled  at each 
dose level.  
o At most 6 evaluable patients will be treated at each dose level.  
- At any time if 2+ patients experience DLT at a dose level, then the MTD has been exceeded . 
o At Dose Levels 1  and 2: dose escalation will be stopped , and the dose level will be de -
escalated, if there are fewer than 6 patients at the next lower dose level.   
o At Dose Levels 3 and 4: dose level will be de -escalated, if there are fewer than 6 patients 
at the next lower dose level.   
o At Dose Level 0  and 4a : the protocol will be terminated or amended.    
- If 6 patients have been enrolled and evaluated, and only 0 or 1 patients have experienced at 
DLT, the following rules apply.  
o At Dose Levels 1 and 2: the next patient will be enrolled at the next higher dose level.   
o At Dose Leve ls 0, 3, 4 and 4a : the current Dose Level  will be labeled the MTD.  
- Once 3 -5 patients have been treated at a dose level and only 0 or 1 have experienced a  DLT, 
then the following rules will be followed as listed in the Table below.

*Study Committee may opt to hold accrual until all patients have been evaluated  
 
When participants are inevaluable for toxicity, they are replaced with the next available participant 
if escalation or de -escalation rules have not been fulfilled at the time the next available participant 
is enrolled onto the study.  
 
In this study, the MTD will be defined as the highest dose tested in which 0 or only 1 patient – out 
of a total of 6 patients – experiences a DLT during the first course of therapy.    
 
 
Oper ating Characteristics of the Rolling 6 . This trial was designed to select an MIBG dose that, 
combined with dinutuximab, has a DLT rate that is 25% or less.  The operating characteristics of 
the Rolling 6 rules, in terms of the probability of DLT at the sel ected MTD, are very similar to those 
of the 3+3 rules.  Both tend to select an MTD with a probability of DLT in the range 0f 0.10 to 0.25.  
The table s below estimates the characteristics of the proposed design for a variety of scenario, 
using the 3+3 rules  in which the dose can be escalated over 3 doses, with a single dose reduction 
if too many DLT’s are observed at Dose Level 1.

10.3.2  Expansion Cohort at the RP2D/ MTD  
Once the MTD of dinutuximab and 131I-MIBG  in Part A and vorinostat, dinutuximab, and 131I-MIBG 
in Part B  has been determined, an expansion cohort will be enrolled at the RP2D/MTD  of each part 
of the study . This number of ad ditional patients will provide a maximum  of 12 DLT-evaluable 
patients ( 3-6 DLT-evaluable  patients already treated at the RP2D/MTD plus 6 -9 new DLT-evaluable  
patients in the expansion cohort) treated at the RP2D/MTD.  If one or more patients are not DLT 
evaluable and evaluable for response (see definitions above), then they will be replaced ..  
 
The purpose of the expansion cohort is to provide a more precise assessment of the tolerability 
and toxicities of this regimen when dosed at the RP2D/MTD as well as provide additional biologic 
correlate data. In addition, this expansion cohort will provide  preliminary data regarding the anti -
tumor activity at the RP2D/MTD. The number of DLT-evaluable patients  needed during expansion 
will be determined when a robust cohort , treated at the RP2D/MTD , has been established to 
describe toxicity, response, and immune correlated data.  
 
Detailed toxicity data will be collected on patients in the expansion cohort in a manner identical to 
the toxicity data collection in the dose -escalation portion of the study. Toxicities observed in the 
expansion coho rt will not alter the defined MTD from the dose -escalation portion of the study, but 
may impact on the final selection of the RP2D,  and on the study committee’s recommendation for 
supportive care with this regimen and for the role of this regimen in the fu ture.  
 
Accrual to the MTD expansion cohort will be continuous and will not depend upon completion of 
treatment of the previous patients in the expansion cohort. There will not be formal rules for 
continuing or terminating enrollment to the expansion cohor t. However, we will adopt the following 
guideline:  
 
Toxicity Monitoring Guideline:   if a second DLT is observed in the patients in either  expansion 
cohort, then cumulative toxicities will be reviewed prior to enrolling the next patient.  The table below 
summarizes the probability of observing 2 or more patients with DLT (out of 6  in each of the two 
expansion cohorts ) for a range of DLT rates.

The group of all DLT-evaluable  patients (dose escalation + expansion) treated at the MTD  of each 
part of the study  will also provide additional preliminary information regarding the anti -tumor activity 
of this regimen at the MTD. The overall response rate will be determined. In addition, MIBG 
response rates, bone marrow response rates, and CT/MRI response rates will b e documented.  
 
Including the dose -expansion phase, the total number of patients treated on this study will not 
exceed 35 patients  in Part A and 20 patients in Part B . 
 
10.4 Analysis of Results  
The outcome status (in terms of toxicity, engraftment, response, reason off study, progression, and 
survival) of all registered patients will be reported.  
 
If a patient is found to be ineligible and does not receive any protocol treatment, or if an eligib le 
patient refuses treatment and receives no protocol therapy, then the enrollment of that patient will 
be documented but that patient will not be included in any analyses.  
 
If a patient is found to be ineligible after he or she has begun treatment on this  trial, then data from 
that patient will continue to be collected and recorded as long as he or she continues treatment and 
then for a minimum of 30 days afterwards or until resolution of toxicities – whichever comes last.  
In the reporting of results, the  enrollment of that patient will be documented but that patient will not 
be included in any analyses.  For completeness, the toxicities and adverse events experienced by 
that patient will be listed separately.   
 
Finally, if an eligible patient, who began treatment, subsequently withdrew consent for further 
treatment, then data from that patient will continue to be collected and recorded as long as he or 
she continues treatment and then for a minimum of 30 days afterwards or until resolution of 
toxicities – whichever comes last.  However, if the patient consents to continued follow -up, these 
data will also be collected.  The results of this patient will be included in all analyses as with all the 
other eligible patients, unless he or she requests that his or  her data not be used.  
 
10.4.1 Toxicity   
All toxicities observed will be summarized in terms of type (organ affected or laboratory 
determination), severity (by NCI CTCAE  v5), and attribution. Tables will be created to summarize 
theses toxicities and side effects by dose level and by course. All eligible patients who begin 
treatment will be included  in these summaries.  Ineligible patients who begin treatment will be listed 
separately.  
 
10.4.2  Response/Outcome   
All eligible patients who begin treatment will be included in the analysis of survival, time -to-failure, 
and best response. Patients with measurable or evaluable tumor who receive 131I-MIBG or who 
progress prior to com pletion of therapy will be included in a planned subset analysis of tumor 
response.  
 
10.4.3  Evaluation of Patients Receiving Multiple Courses of Therapy    
It is anticipated that one -third of patients will receive a second course of therapy. Therefore, to xicity 
and response from a second course of therapy will be reported descriptively. In addition, if any 
patient experiences a protocol -defined dose limiting toxicity in the second course of therapy, the 
study committee will discuss the event and determine whether future patients should continue to 
be offered a second course of therapy.  
 
 
 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   77 
 10.5 Monitoring Plan for Specific Toxicities  
 
10.5.1  Monitoring plan for opportunistic infection   
Opportunistic infections are anticipated to be rare events in these patients, particularly as all 
patients will be required to receive PCP prophylaxis. Any diagnosis of an opportunistic infection 
within 90 days of stem cell infusion will be reviewed by the  Study Committee and IND sponsor and 
decision will be made to close the trial, modify the trial, or continue unchanged; in addition, it will 
be determined if the event requires that new information be added to the informed consent.  
 
10.5.2  Monitoring pla n in the event of death prior to engraftment or within 2 months of stem cell infusion 
(whichever occurs last)   
Any time that a patient dies while undergoing treatment prior to a stem cell infusion, or within two 
months of stem cell infusion, the status of the study will be examined. Information reviewed will 
include the specific details of the patient who died, the timing of the death, the specifics of all 
patients who experienced the same type of toxicity that did not lead to death, and all toxicities 
obse rved to date.  
 
Each death on study not due to tumor will be reviewed by the NANT Study Management 
Committee, reported to NANT DSMB and a decision in consultation with NANT DSMB and IND 
sponsor will be made to close the trial, modify the trial, or continue  unchanged; in addition, it will 
be determined if the event requires that new information be added to the informed consent.  Each 
death occurring within 30 days of completing the last dose of dinutuximab regardless of cause will 
be reviewed and reported to  the NANT DSMB and to the FDA according to standard procedure.   
 
10.6  Analysis of Correlative Studies  
Summary statistics and descriptive plots will be generated for the correlative biology studies. The 
changes will be assessed using a paired t -test or Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank sum test 
when appropriate. Linear mixed models (with appropriate transformation if necessary) may also be 
considered to take advantage of the repeated measurements.  All these analyses will be 
descriptive, exploratory, an d hypotheses generating in nature.  
 
10.7     Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
The study is open to all participants regardless of gender or ethnicity. Review of accrual to past 
NANT studies of new agents demonstrates the accrual of both genders and all NI H-identified 
ethnicities to such studies. The small number of patients entered into this trial will obviate any 
analysis of variation in response rate with gender or ethnicity.  
 
  
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   78 
  
11.0 NANT RESPONSE CRITERIA v2.0 
For evaluation of response this study will utilize the New Approaches to Neuroblastoma Therapy (NANT) 
Response Criteria v2.0. Since patients on this study must have MIBG avid tumors, any reference to 
MIBG non -avid tumors is not applicable , but the language  is retained here to present the NANT 
response criteria in its entirety .  
 
Overall response will incorporate all three parameters: Soft Tissue Response, Bone Response, and Bone 
Marrow Response with Overall Response defined as outlined in Section 11.6.  Response for each 
parameter and overall response will be reported by the treating site using the criteria below. However, the 
final statistical analysis of response will utilize responses as graded by central review, using the same 
criteria below.  
 
11.1 Soft Tissue Response Criteria  
Soft tissue lesions will be evaluated by CT/MRI, using the definitions of measurable disease from 
the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1; European Journal Cancer 45: 228 -
247, 2009) modified per the criteria  below to define target lesions (lesions which are measurable 
AND evaluable for response).  
 
Note that the response criteria for lymph nodes measured by short axis will only be applied to 
discrete lymph nodes (i .e. cervical, axillary) that are not adjacent to the primary site and are not 
composed of a coalesced mass of multiple lymph nodes. Coalesced masses of lymph nodes should 
be assessed using non -lymph node criteria and measured using longest dimension.  
 
11.1.1  DEFINITION OF SOFT TISSUE TARGET LESIONS:  
. 
Soft tissue target lesions that will be followed for response must meet criteria  1 and 2 , OR criteria 3  below:  
1. A target lesion must be measurable, defined as a soft tissue lesion that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension with a longest diameter ≥ 10mm, or for discrete lymph 
nodes ≥ 15mm on short axis.  (The short axis is measured after identifying the longest diameter 
of a lymph node, and then measuring the longest perpendicular diameter to that as the short 
axis).  For coalesced masses of multiple lymph nodes, the longest diameter will be used.  
2. A target lesion must also be MIBG avid OR FDG -PET avid (if tumor known to be MIBG non -
avid), and have a biopsy if required in the eligibility crite ria.  If one avid soft tissue or bone 
lesion present at enrollment is biopsied showing neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroblastoma at 
any time point prior to enrollment, then all other avid soft tissue lesions present at enrollment 
are considered target lesions.    
3. A lesion that is measurable but does not have either MIBG or FDG -PET uptake will be 
considered a target lesion if a biopsy done at any time prior to enrollment demonstrates 
neuroblastoma and/or ganglioneuroblastoma.  
 
NOTE: Soft tissue components of bone  lesions will be considered measurable soft tissue lesions if 
> 10mm in at least one dimension, and target lesions evaluable for response if MIBG avid (or FDG -
PET-avid if tumor known to be MIBG non -avid).  
 
Serial measurements of target lesions are to be do ne with the same method of assessment (either 
CT or MRI) used to characterize each lesion reported at baseline.  The sum of diameters (longest 
for non -nodal lesions and coalesced masses of multiple lymph node, short axis for discrete nodal 
lesions) for all  target soft tissue lesions will be calculated and reported as the sum of diameters . 
 
11.1.2  DEFINITION  OF NON -TARGET SOFT TISSUE LESIONS : 
 
a. Leptomeningeal tumor and tumor in cerebrospinal fluid cytology.  
b. Lesions that are considered likely to be active tumor by the treating physician based on clinical 
correlation (for example, hepatic and pulmonary nodules)  
 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   79 
 11.1.3    The following lesions will NOT be followed to evaluate response either as target lesions or non -
target lesions, if they meet the cri teria below AND  the treating physician feels they are unlikely to 
represent active tumor (an exception for active tumor will be made for c. below):  
a. Measurable non -lymph node and coalesced masses of lymph node soft tissue lesions ≥ 10mm 
and discrete lymph n odes >15 mm that are not MIBG avid or FDG -PET avid (if tumor known to 
be MIBG non -avid) and if biopsied did not show neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroblastoma.  
b. Non-measurable non -lymph node soft tissue lesions < 10mm or non -measurable discrete 
lymph nodes (def ined as lymph nodes >10 to <15mm on short axis).  
c. Intramedullary bone lesions will not be followed for CT/MRI response even though they are felt 
to represent active tumor since they will be evaluated with MIBG scans (or FDG -PET scans if 
MIBG non -avid), and since bone changes on CT/MRI are known to persist after resolution of 
active tumor.   
 
11.1.4   SOFT TISSUE RESPONSE CRITERIA:  
 
11.1.4.1 Complete Response (CR)  
All target and non -target soft tissue lesions have longest diameter < 10 mm. Discrete lymph nodes 
identified as target lesions must decrease to a short axis < 15 mm. Resolution of all MIBG uptake 
(FDG -PET uptake if tumor known to be MIBG non -avid).  
 
11.1.4.2 Partial Response (PR)  
At least a 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target soft ti ssue lesions (using longest diameter 
for non -nodal and coalesced masses of lymph node lesions and short axis for discrete lymph node 
lesions), taking as reference the measurement of target lesions performed at study enrollment. 
Non-target soft tissue lesio ns must be stable to smaller in size.  No new lesions.  MIBG (FDG -PET 
for MIBG non -avid tumors) uptake may still be present in lesions positive at enrollment.  
 
11.1.4.3 Progressive Disease (PD)  
At least a 20% increase in sum of diameters of target soft tissue lesions (using longest dimension 
for non -nodal and coalesced masses of lymph node lesions and short axis for discrete lymph node 
lesions) taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters wh ile on study (this includes the baseline 
if that is the smallest while on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of 5 mm. A new target or non -target soft tissue lesion seen on 
CT/MRI without  MIBG or PET uptake is considered PD, but may be biopsied to rule out PD.  An 
overall substantial worsening of non -target soft tissue lesions is also considered as a criteria for 
PD (guidance for substantial includes a 73% increase  in volume, or sufficien t worsening of overall 
non-target disease such that the treating physician feels a change in therapy is indicated).     
 
New uptake of MIBG (or FDG -PET for MIBG non -avid tumors) at target and/or non -target soft tissue 
lesions which are stable in size, will  also be considered PD.  Biopsy of such lesions can be done 
to rule out PD for the MIBG (or FDG -PET) response.   
 
11.1.4.4  Stable disease (SD)  
(Applies only to patients with target soft tissue lesions)  
Neither sufficient shrinkage in sum of diameters to qualify for PR nor does the  patient meet any 
criteria for PD. No new soft tissue lesions.  Non -target soft tissue lesions must be stable to smaller 
in size.  
 
11.1.4.5 Stable  disease -no target lesions (SD -NTL)  (Applies to patients with non -target soft tissue 
lesions only)  
Non-target soft tissue lesions are still present; may be smaller or stable in size, and do not meet 
criteria for PD.  No new soft tissue lesions and no new uptake of MIBG (FDG -PET if tumor known 
to be MIBG non -avid) at existing non -target soft tissue lesions.  New lesions or lesions with new 
MIBG (FDG -PET) uptake may be biopsied to rule out PD.  
 
 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   80 
 11.1.4.6  Not involved (NI):   No target or non -target soft tissue lesions  
 
11.1.4.7  Not evaluable (NE)  
CT/MRI scans and/or MIBG scans (FDG -PET if tumor known to be MIBG non -avid) are of 
inadequate quality as assessed by central reviewer, or scans are not repeated of all anatomic sites 
with tumor documented at entry. (Note that patients not evaluable at a given time point may be 
evaluable for re sponse at later time points if all scans done with adequate quality at later time point) 
or if based on Study Management Committee / PI review it is deemed that there is insufficient data 
to grade response.  
 
11.1.4.8  Not done (ND)  
No CT/MRI scans were don e at the given time point.  
 
 
11.2 Bone Marrow Response Criteria  
 
Methodology:   
1. Routine morphology with immunohistochemistry will be used for all bone marrow evaluations.  
Immunohistochemistry (with antibodies that are used per local site’s standard procedure) is 
recommended for evaluating percentage of tumor but it is not required.  If immunohistochemistry 
is not done on the baseline bone marrow, then BM response should be graded based on routine 
morphology only  at all time points.  
2. The perce ntage of tumor in the bone marrow at study entry (baseline) and all subsequent time 
points reported will use the highest tumor percentage noted among the four samples (bilateral 
aspirates and biopsies).   
3. The percentage of tumor in an aspirate will be calc ulated as the number of tumor cells divided by 
the number of total nucleated cells.   
4. The percentage of tumor in a biopsy will be calculated as the percent of tumor cells (including 
neuroblasts, mature and maturing ganglion cells) based on the bone marrow parenchymal surface 
area examined.  Schwannian stroma only is considered negative.  
 
Bone marrow response will be graded using the bone marrow done at study entry as the reference 
point.  The baseline bone marrow must include an attempt to obtain bilateral a spirates and biopsies, 
and will be considered as evaluable if at least one biopsy sample is adequate to determine the 
percentage tumor involvement. At baseline, or any subsequent time point, the percentage tumor 
from the unilateral evaluable biopsy will be  used to grade bone marrow response. Patients with ≤ 
5% tumor (including patients with tumor seen by immunohistochemistry only) on all samples of the 
bilateral bone marrow aspirate and biopsies at the baseline evaluation will be evaluable for bone 
marrow response, but defined separately from patients with > 5% at study entry as outlined below.  
 
Central review will be performed on bilateral biopsies only, unless BM tumor is seen only on 
aspirates.  If a patient meets protocol criteria for central review of BM response, morphology slides 
will b e requested.     
 
11.2.1  Complete Response (CR)  
Greater than 5% tumor at study entry, with no tumor seen at one subsequent time point  
 
11.2.2  Complete Response Minimal Disease (CR -MD)  
 ≤ 5% tumor at study entry, with no tumor seen at one subsequent time p oint.  
 
11.2.3  Partial Response (PR)  
Greater than 20% tumor at study entry, with >0 to < 5% tumor at a subsequent time point.  
 
 
 
 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   81 
 11.2.4   Minimal Disease (MD)  
One of the following:  
A. No tumor at study entry, with >0 to <5% tumor at a subsequent time point  
B. >0 to <5% tumor at study entry, with >0 to <5% tumor at a subsequent time point  
C. >5-<20% tumor at study entry, with > 0 to <5% at a subsequent time point.  
 
11.2.5  Progressive Disease (PD) 
Patients with any amount of tumor in the bone marrow at study entry will be considered to have PD if one 
subsequent evaluation shows >20% tumor on any one bone marrow sample AND there is a greater than 2 
times increase in the amount of tumor compared to study entry.  
 
Patients with  ≤ 5% tumor at study entry must  increase to > 20% tumor to have PD; a patient with 30% tumor 
at study entry must increase to >60% tumor.  If patients have an increase in tumor amount which is less 
than the amount specified for PD, the response will be classified as SD.  
 
Patients with  no tumor at study entry will be considered PD if ONE subsequent evaluation shows >5% 
tumor.   
 
Patients who are deemed to have bone marrow progression based on review of prior bone marrows by 
physician assessment and confirmed by the study management commit tee.   
 
 
11.2.6  Stable Disease (SD)  
Persistence of an amount of tumor in the bone marrow that does not meet criteria for progressive disease 
or PR or MD, and is > 5%. .  
 
11.2.7   Not Evaluable (NE)  
Patients for whom follow -up bone marrow evaluations do not include an attempt to obtain bilateral aspirates 
and biopsies and do not have at least one adequate biopsy sample, as assessed by local site’s pathology 
report for that time point or if based on St udy Management Committee / PI review it is deemed that there is 
insufficient data to grade response.    
 
11.2.8   Not involved (NI)  
Patients with no evidence of neuroblastoma in the bone marrow at study entry, and bone marrow remains 
negative on subsequent evaluations.   
 
11.2.9   Not done (ND)  
Bone marrow evaluation not done at a given time point.

11.3.  Bone Response Criteria Using MIBG Scans (for MIBG avid tumors)  
 
Bone response will be evaluated using MIBG scans for MIBG avid tumors.  FDG -PET scans (see 
section 11.4) may be substituted for MIBG scans to assess bone response only if the tumor is 
known to be MIBG non -avid.  Bone response will be graded using a modification of the Curie 
scoring scale ( Eur J Cancer 1995;31A:256 -261). The treating site will report the Bone Response 
using MIBG scoring done at local si te, however the statistical endpoint of Bone Response will utilize 
the MIBG score from the central reviewer.  
 
MIBG scans will be scored for 9 anatomic regions for bone metastases only, MIBG uptake in soft 
tissue disease will NOT be included, since this upt ake is utlized as part of evaluating Soft Tissue 
Response .  SPECT scans are strongly encouraged to be used for MIBG scoring, if SPECT is 
available at baseline and subsequent time points.  If SPECT scans are not available at all time 
points, then conjugate planar imaging alone should be used to score each region, and SPECT may 
be used only as an adjunct  to help delineate the location of the MIBG avid lesion.  
 
Table 7: Scoring of Bone  Disease  
Regions 1 – 9 
Scoring  MIBG uptake  
0 No MIBG uptake  
1 1 focal lesion  
2 > 1 focal lesion  
3 > 50% of a region  
 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   83 
  
The absolute extension score  is obtained by adding the scores of all nine regions.  The presence of a 
MIBG avid lesion, and NOT the “intensity” of MIBG -avidity, determines the scoring within a particular region.  
 
REGIONS 1 – 9 / BONE DISEASE:  Cranio -facial disease is scored in Region 1, cervico -thoracic spine in 
Region 2, ribs / sternum / clavicles / scapula in Region 3, lumbar -sacral spine in Region 4, pelvis in Region 
5, humeri in Region 6, distal upper extremities in Region 7, femurs in Region 8, and distal lower extremities 
in Region 9 (see figure above).  
 
The relative score  is calculated by dividing the absolute score of bone lesions at each time by the 
corresponding pre -treatment overall absolute score. The relative score of each patient is calculated at each 
response asses sment and classified as below:  
a. Complete response :  all areas of bone uptake on MIBG scan completely resolved.  
b. Partial response : Relative score > 0.1 to < 0.5 
c. Stable disease : Relative score  0.5 to < 1.2  
d. Progressive disease :  New bone lesions  on MIBG scan compared to most recent prior MIBG 
scan OR a relative score > 1.2.  Biopsy of new lesions may be done to rule out progressive 
disease. If biopsy is negative for tumor (neuroblastoma and/or ganglioneuroblastoma), patient 
will not meet definiti on of PD.   
e.   Not evaluable (NE):   MIBG scan of inadequate quality as assessed by central reviewer.  
f.  Not involved (NI):  No MIBG avid bone lesions at study entry and subsequent response time 
points.  
g. Not done (ND): MIBG scan not done at a given resp onse time point  
 
11.4 Bone Response Criteria Using FDG -PET Scans (only for MIBG non -avid tumors)  
Patients known to be non -avid for MIBG should have FDG -PET scans performed for monitoring bone 
response. FDG -PET avid bone lesions will be scored by the presence or absence of a lesion with uptake that 
is two times above background.  For MIBG non -avid patients, uptake of FDG -PET in soft tissue lesions will 
be utilized in the Soft Tissue Response (see section 11.1).  
 
11.4.1  Complete response (CR)  
Resolution  of all FDG -PET uptake in all FDG -PET avid bone lesions identified at baseline and no new FDG -
PET avid bone lesions.  
 

 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   84 
 11.4.2   Partial response (PR)  
Reduction of number of bone lesions by FDG -PET by ≥50%.  No new FDG -PET avid bone lesions.  
 
11.4.3   Stable d isease (SD)  
Changes that do not meet the criteria for PR or PD.   
 
11.4.4   Progressive disease (PD)  
New bone lesions on FDG -PET scan.  Note: biopsy may be done to exclude causes of FDG -PET uptake 
other than tumor.  If biopsy of the new lesion is negative f or tumor (neuroblastoma and/or 
ganglioneuroblastoma), patient will not meet definition of PD.   
 
11.4.5   Not evaluable (NE)  
FDG-PET scan of inadequate quality to evaluate bone response or if based on Study Management Committee 
/ PI review it is deemed that  there is insufficient data to grade response.  
 
11.4.6   Not involved (NI)  
No FDG -PET uptake in bone sites that is two times above background.   
 
11.4.7   Not done (ND)  
FDG-PET scan not done at a given time point.  
 
On central review, FDG -PET avid bone lesion s will be evaluated by both the MIBG scoring method outlined 
in Section 11.3 and also by enumeration of lesions to grade bone response.  
 
11.5 Urine Catecholamines  
Due to variance with diet and concomitant medications, frequently missing dopamine levels, and lack of 
standardized methodology for this assay, urine catecholamines will not be utilized in grading response.  
Results of urine catecholamines will not be requested.  
 
 
 
11.6 Definition of Overall Response  
 
The criteria below will be used to define the overall response for each patient, with consideration of all three 
individual response parameters: Soft tissue Response, Bone Response, and Bone Marrow Response.  
 
11.6.1  Complete Response (CR)  
Response of CR or NI for soft tissue and bone, soft tissue with bone marrow response of CR or CR -MD.   
 
11.6.2  Complete  Response MD (CR -MD) 
Soft tissue and bone response are both NI, with BM response of CR -MD  
 
11.6.3  Partial Response (PR) includes any one of the following:  
a. Response of PR for soft tissue, bone response of PR, and BM response of CR, CR -MD, PR, MD, 
or NI.  
b. Response of CR, SD -NTL or NI for soft tissue, with bone response of PR, and BM response of CR, 
CR-MD, PR, MD, or NI.   
c. Soft tissue response of PR; with bone response of CR  or NI; and BM response of CR, CR -MD, PR, 
MD, or NI.  
d. CR for soft tissue and bone response, with MD for bone marrow response  
 
11.6.4  Progressive Disease (PD) includes either one of the following:  
a. PD for at least one response parameter, including soft ti ssue, bone, and bone marrow response.  
If PD is found by one parameter, the other two parameters are not required to be evaluated to 
define an overall response of PD.  
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   85 
 b. Treating physician grades patient as progressive disease based on clinical assessment wit hout 
radiographic or bone marrow evaluations.  
  
11.6.5  Stable disease (SD)   
Response of stable disease for at least one parameter, with response of SD, NI, MD, or SD -NTL for other 
parameters.   
 
11.6.6   Stable disease -Non-target lesions (SD -NTL)  
Response of SD -NTL for soft tissue, with response of NI for bone and bone marrow.  
 
11.6.7   Minor response (MR)  
Complete response, Complete -MD response, and/or partial response for one parameter (i.e. soft tissue, 
bone, or bone marrow), with response of stable disease for a second parameter and any response other than 
PD for third parameter.  
 
11.6.8   Minimal disease (MD)  
Soft tissue and bone marrow responses are both NI, with bone marrow response of MD.  
 
11.6.9  Not evaluable (NE)  
Response of Not evaluable for one or more response parameters including soft tissue, bone, or bone marrow 
for any parameter that had sites evaluabl e for response at study enrollment.  However, if one parameter is 
done and demonstrates PD this is defined as an overall response of PD.  The SMC will review all patients 
where one or more parameters were graded as not evaluable, and make the final determi nation if the overall 
response is evaluable at that time point.  In addition, response may be declared not evaluable if review by the 
Study Management Committee (SMC) that there is insufficient data to grade response.  The SMC may also 
declare response at a given time point evaluable if only one parameter is missing and was not involved at 
study enrollment.  
 
11.6.10  No progression  
Baseline status at enrollment was NI for soft tissue response, NI for bone marrow response, NI for bone 
response, and there has NOT bee n PD for any of the three parameters since on protocol therapy  
 
11.6.11  Not done (ND)  
Response not assessed at this time point.  If only one parameter is not done at a given response time point, 
the SMC and PI will review and make the final determination if the ov erall response is evaluable at that time 
point.  
 
11.6.1 2   Summary  
The overall response as assessed at any particular time point based on consideration of each of the three 
parameters as defined above is summarized in the following table:

12.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
12.1 Purpose  
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are 
done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future 
studies using similar agents. Adverse events are reported in a routin e manner at scheduled times 
during a trial. (Please follow directions for routine reporting provided in the data collection packet 
for this protocol). Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to 
allow for timelier monito ring of patient safety and care. The following sections provide information 
about expedited reporting through the use of a written IND safety report (MedWatch) to the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA).  
 
Adverse events will be graded according to the NCI C ommon Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE), Version 5.  A copy of the CTCAEv 5 can be downloaded from the CTEP home 
page ( http://ctep.cancer.gov) .   
 
12.2 Definitions  
 
Adverse Event (AE):  An adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with 
the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
 
Suspected Adverse Reaction: Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the  adverse event.  Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Event or Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction:  An adverse event 
or suspected adverse reaction is c onsidered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator 
brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator 
brochure is not available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the g eneral 
investigational plan.  
 
Serious Adverse Events (SAE) or Serious Suspected Adverse Reactions:  An adverse event 
or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the followin g outcomes:  
 
Table 9: Severe Adverse Events or Reactions  
Death of Patient  An event that results in the death of a patient.  
Life-Threatening  An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been 
taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal 
if it had occurred in a more severe form.  
Hospitalization  An event that results in an admission to the hospital for any length 
of time.  This does not include an emergency room visit or 
admission to an outpatient facility.  
Prolongation of 
Hospitalization  An event that occurs while the study patient is hospitalized and 
prolongs the patient’s hospital stay.  
Congenital Anomaly  An anomaly detected at or after birth or any anomaly that result in 
fetal loss.  
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   89 
 Persistent or Significant 
Disability/ Incapacity  An event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with 
the activities of daily living of a study patient.  Disability is not 
intended t o include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, or accidental trauma ( e.g., sprained ankle).  
Important Medical Event 
Requiring Medical or 
Surgical Intervention to 
Prevent Serious Outcome  An important medical event  that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based on 
medical judgment may jeopardize the patient and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the o utcomes 
listed above ( i.e., death of patient, life -threatening, hospitalization, 
prolongation of hospitalization, congenital anomaly, or persistent 
or significant disability/incapacity). Examples of such events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring inten sive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that 
do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
12.3 Expedited Serious Adverse Event Reporting to NANT Operations  
 
For any serious adverse event, both expected and unexpected : 
 
o Contact the Study Chairperson and the NANT Operations Center to alert them to the 
existence of the serious adverse event within 24 hours of learning of the event . 
o Within 48 hours of learning of the event , complete the NANT SAE form online through 
Medidata  Rave.  If access to Medidata  Rave is unavailable for some reason, use the paper 
SAE form found on the NANT website  (see NANT website ( www .nant.org ) and email to 
NANTstaff@chla.usc.edu .  
 
o Follow -up information should be submitted online in an updated report through Medidata  
Rave as soon as relevant information is available.  
 
Copies of all serious adverse event reports will be kept on file in the NANT Operations Center. All 
NANT institutions are to file SAE reports with their Institutional Review Boards according to local 
institut ional policy .   
 
12.4 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting to the FDA  
Per CFR 312.32 (c), the sponsor of the IND, Araz Marachelian , MD , must notify the FDA and all 
participating investigators in a written IND safety report of any adverse experience associated  with 
use of the drug  that is both serious and unexpected.  Each written notification shall be made as 
soon as possible, and in no event later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of 
the information.  Each written notification may be submitted on FDA Form 3500A (MedWatch) or 
in a narrative format and must bear prominent identification of its contents, i.e., “IND Safety Report”.  
Follow -up information to a safety report should be submitted as soon as the relevant inf ormation is 
available.  
 
The sponsor must also notify FDA by telephone  or by facsimile  transmission of any unexpected 
fatal or life -threatening  experience associated with use of the drug  in the clinical studies 
conducted under the IND as soon as possible bu t in no event later than 7 calendar  days after initial 
receipt of the information.  
 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   90 
 Each telephone call or facsimile transmission to the FDA shall be transmitted to the FDA division that 
has responsibility for review of the IND; a specific contact person is assigned to each IND at the time 
the application is filed, and this will be includ ed in the FDA’s correspondence acknowledging receipt 
of the IND application.   
 
12.5 NANT Operations Center Role in Expedited Adverse Event Reporting to the FDA and  
Participating Sites   
For purposes of this protocol, the MedWatch Report Form (FDA 3500A) will be submitted to the FDA 
by NANT on behalf of the IND sponsor, Araz Marachelian , MD.  These forms will be  submitted to the 
appropriate FDA division and will serve as the written IND safety report.  The NANT Operations 
Center will file all expedited adverse event reports as well as other adverse events with the FDA and 
other relevant authorities or investigators.  The IND sponsor, Araz Marachelian , MD , has also 
delegated to the NANT Operations Center the telephone/facsimile FDA  notification responsibilities 
for unexpected fatal or life -threatening experiences.  All IND submissions will be maintained in a 
master file at  the NANT Operations Center . 
 
For Adverse Events associated with the use of the drug that are both Serious and U nexpected:  
• The MedWatch form will be drafted by the NANT Operations Center based on the SAE form within 
10 days of the adverse event and reviewed with PI at treating site and the study chair.  Final 
MedWatch form will be submitted to FDA by NANT Operations  Center.  Electronic version of 
MedWatch form is available from NANT Operations Center or MedWatch website 
www.fda.gov/medwatch . NANT will forward the completed report  to the FDA and other relevant 
authorities or  investigators on behalf of the IND Sponsor, Araz Marachelian , MD .  
• Follow -up information should be submitted as soon as relevant information is available.  
 
For Adverse Events associated with the use of the drug that are Unexpected or Life Threatening:  
• Notify the NANT Operations Center (who will notify the FDA and other relevant authorities and 
investigators) by telephone or fax as soon as possible but no later than 7 calendar days from the 
occurrence of the event.  
 
FDA PHONE:  1-800-332-1088  
FDA FAX:  1-800-332-0178  
 
• The MedWatch form will be drafted by the NANT Operations Center based on the SAE form within 
10 days of the adverse event and reviewed with PI at treating site and the study chair.  Final Medwatch 
form will be submitted to FDA and other relevant authoritie s or investig ators by NANT Operations 
Center on behalf of the IND Sponsor, Araz Marachelian , MD.   
• Follow -up information should be submitted as soon as relevant information is available.  
 
A cover letter to accompany the MedWatch report will be prepared by the NANT Operations Center in 
collaboration with the IND sponsor, Araz Marachelian , MD. The c over letter will be submitted with MedWatch 
report to the FDA and other NANT institutions and r elevant authorities.  Contents will include:  
 
1. An assessment of the adverse event and its significance/relevance to the study.  And the impact on 
the risk/benefit ratio of the study . 
2. A statement as to whether this adverse event has been reported previously, and if so, whether the 
frequency is considered unusually high.  
3. A statement as to whether the  protocol and/or  informed consent should reflect changes in the 
potential risks involved.  
 
Copies of all adverse event reports will be kept on file in the NANT Oper ations Center.  All NANT institutions 
are to file AE reports with their Institutional Review Boards according to local institutional policy.

NANT 2017 -01:  A PHASE I STUDY OF 131I-MIBG WITH DINUTUXIMAB FOR 
RELAPSED/REFRACTORY NEUROBLASTOMA  
 
FOR PATIENTS ON PART A  
 
A New Approaches to Neuroblastoma Therapy (NANT) treatment protocol.  
 
The word “you” used throughout this document refers to you or your child.  
 
WHAT IS THIS STUDY ABOUT?  
This study is a clinical trial, a type of research study. Clinical trials include only patients who choose to take 
part. Please take your time to make your decision about participating. You may discuss your decision with 
your friends, family, and health care team. If you have any questions, you may ask your doctor.  
 
You are being asked to participate in this study because you have a kind of cancer called neuroblastoma. 
It may be that your cancer went away for  a while but has grown back (relapsed) or it may be that it has 
never gone away (persistent or resistant tumor) after standard treatment. Standard treatment may have 
included chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, high -dose chemotherapy with a stem cell  transplant 
and/or immunotherapy.  
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
 
The purposes of this study are:  
 
• To find the highest safe dose  of 131I-MIBG that can be given with dinutuximab to children with 
refractory or recurrent neuroblastoma without causing severe s ide effects  
• To find out what side effects there are from giving 131I-MIBG and dinutuximab together on this 
schedule at different dose levels  
• To see if your tumor gets smaller after treatment with 131I-MIBG and dinutuximab  
• To learn  what happens to your immune system and other proteins that cause inflammation when 
giving different doses of  131I-MIBG with dinutuximab.  
• To see what effect  giving different doses of 131I-MIBG has on your body in making an antibody to 
the dinutuximab  
• To see what effect treatment with 131I-MIBG  in combination with dinutuximab  has on the cells of 
your immune system that surround and invade your tumor  
• To describe the amount of neuroblastoma tumor found in the blood and bone marrow by testing 
samples with a new  test (called NB5 assay).  
 
The research is being done because:  
Currently there is no known effective treatment for neuroblastoma that has returned or that has not 
responded to treatment.   
 
This study will use a chemical agent called metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG)  together with  an intravenous 
(IV) drug called dinutuximab . MIBG is taken up by neuroblastoma tumor cells. MIBG can be combined with 
radioactive iodine (131I) in the laboratory to form the radioactive compound 131I-MIBG. 131I-MIBG delivers 
radiation to the neuroblastoma cancer cells and causes them to die. 131I-MIBG lowers the number of blood 
forming cells (called stem cells) in the bone marrow when it is given at higher doses  as in this study . 
Because of this,  all patients wil l get back their own stem cells to help the bone marrow recover from this 
therapy.   
 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   99 
 Dinutuximab works differently than most standard chemotherapy drugs. Dinutuximab is a monoclonal 
antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins made in the lab, designed to attach to specific targets on 
cancer cells. When dinutuximab attaches to neuroblastom a cells, the body’s immune system is stimulated 
to attack and kill the neuroblastoma cells. Dinutuximab represents a new kind of cancer therapy called 
immunotherapy which, unlike chemotherapy and radiation, targets the cancer cells without destroying 
nearb y healthy cells.  
 
Laboratory studies have shown greater anti -cancer effects when radiation is given before an 
immunotherapy treatment.  Some clinical responses have been seen in adults when radiation has been 
combined with different types of immunotherapy in treating their cancers.  
 
Giving dinutuximab together with 131I-MIBG may help the 131I-MIBG kill more neuroblastoma cells. This is 
the first study to test giving dinutuximab together with 131I-MIBG.   We want to find out if giving increasing 
doses of 131I-MIBG  along with dinutuximab can be tolerated.  We also want to see how effective this drug 
combination is against relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma.   
 
Dinutuximab is a drug that has been approved  by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating 
newly diagnosed patients with neuroblastoma . The use of dinutuximab in combination with 131I-MIBG  for 
the treatment of relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma  is considered experimental.  
 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?  
There will be a maximum of 30 patients enrolling to this part of the  study. Between 9 and 24 people will 
take part in the dos e escalation part of the study. When you join the study , you will be assigned a certain 
131I-MIBG  and dinutuximab  dose. This study will test up to three 131I-MIBG  doses in groups of 3 -6 patients.  
The starting 131I-MIBG  dose for the first group of patients is about  2/3 of the standard dose when 131I-MIBG  
is given alone as treatment .  The dose of dinutuximab is the standard dose used for patients with 
neuroblastoma.   The dinutuximab dose will not be increased during the study.  If the  first dose level is 
tolerated without serious side effects, then t he 131I-MIBG  dose will be increased (“dose escalation”) in 
groups of 3 -6 patients until the third dose level or until serious side effects are seen.  At that point, 
investigators will have found the highest dose of 131I-MIBG  that can be given in combinatio n with 
dinutuximab without bad side effects  (called maximum tolerated dose) .  This part of the trial is called the 
dose escalation phase . 
   
Once the maximum tolerated dose is determined, a group of 6  more  patients will be enrolled and treated at 
this dose of 131I-MIBG  and dinutuximab , known as the dose expansion part of the study.  The purpose of 
the dose expansion part of the study is to gather more information about side effects seen in patients treated 
at the maximum tolerated dose of 131I-MIBG  in combination with dinutuximab . The dose expansion cohort 
will not enroll patients until the dose escalation part of the study is completed and the highest dose of 131I-
MIBG  that can be safely given in combinatio n with dinutuximab  without serious side effects is found.  
 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME IF I TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?  
 
Before You Begin the Study   
Before you can get treatment on this study, blood stem cells must be available that meet the study 
requirements. We will check your child’s previously stored stem cells to make sure  that they can be used 
for the stem cell infusion.  
 
You will need to have the following exams, tests or procedures to find out if you can take part in the study. 
Most  of thes e exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and may be done even if you do 
not join the study. These tests will also be done at various times throughout the study and at the end of the 
study.  The purpose of these tests is to see how well the treatment works and to measure the status of your 
neuroblastoma.   If you have had some of them recently, they may not need to be repeated. This will be up 
to your doctor.

A medical history & physical  exam  Bone marrow tests2 to check your tumor  
Blood tests  Various scans3 to check your tumor  
Pregnancy test (urine or blood)1 Echocardiogram to check the heart function 
Urine tests   
 
1If you are a female at least 10 years old or who could have children, you will have a pregnancy test done 
by the doctor the week before starting treatment and then before each cycle of treatment begins.  You will 
be informed of a positive pregnancy test. R eporting of a positive pregnancy test to your parent or guardian 
will depend on local and/ or state regulations.   All men and women who could have children must either 
agree to practice abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or use two effective methods of birth control for 
as long as they participate in this study.  
 
2Bone marrow tests are done by inserting a needle into the hip bone to remove the marrow which is inside 
the bone.  
 
3Various scans are done for diagnosis and checking the response of the tum or to treatment. These may 
include CT and /or MRI scans and MIBG scans. We will recommend scans specific for your case and we 
will answer your questions about these scans . 
 
During the Study    
If the exams, tests and procedures show that you can be in the study, and you choose to take part, 131I-
MIBG will be given on Day 1 and dinutuximab will be given on Days 8 -11 and Days 29 -32 of each treatment 
course.  The growth factor GM -CSF is given on the same days as the dinutuximab and continues after the 
dinutuximab has finished for a total of 10 doses (days 8 -17 and days 29 -38).  All patients will be given an 
infusion of their  stem cells on Day 15 of each course. Each course is 57 days long and you may receive up 
to two treatment courses of 131I-MIBG and dinutuximab as long as you are benefiting from the treatment 
and meet the criteria to continue the treatment safely.

Treatment with 131I-MIBG  
Patients will be assigned a certain dose level of 131I-MIBG at time of study registration.  If you are enrolled 
early in this study you may get a lower dose than those who are enrolled later .  Whatever 131I-MIBG dose 
you start at, this dose will not be inc reased  during the study.   Dosing is done this way because we do not 
yet know the best dose to use in children when it is used together with dinutuximab.    
 
Treatment with 131I-MIBG will be done at a hospital that is set up to take care of patients that are treated 
with radioactive substances.  This means that you may need to travel some distance to another hospital to 
get this treatment.  Your health care team will talk with you and help you plan for the trip to get this treatment.  
 
Patient s will be admitted to an 131I-MIBG treatment center one day before starting 131I-MIBG therapy. On 
the following day (Day 1), 131I-MIBG is given into a temporary IV or in your central venous catheter over 90 -
120 minutes.  IV fluids for hydration and other m edicines will be given through your central venous catheter.  
 
Patients who get 131I-MIBG are considered to be “hot” or radioactive and you will stay in the special room 
until your radiation measurement reaches a safe level , usually 3 - 5 days , since you could expose others 
to radiation .  Special care precautions include:  
 
• A single room in a bed surrounded by a lead shield to keep family and the staff who take care of you 
from being exposed to radiation from the 131I-MIBG treatment. This usually takes about 5 days.  
 
• The length of time family can visit inside the room in front  of the protective lead shield that is around 
your bed will depend on how much radiation is measured in the room each day by the radiation 
specialist. Usually family can visit for a  total of 30 -45 minutes on the first day and longer on the days 
after that because there will be less radiation measured in the room each day.  
 
• Family may visit anytime outside of the room or behind a lead shield. You will be able to see who is 
visiting ov er this shield.  
 
• No one will be able to spend the night in this special room with you during this time.  
 
Your urine will be radioactive after treatment with 131I-MIBG. A urinary catheter will be inserted to drain the 
radioactive urine from your body. A urinary catheter is a soft tube that is inserted into your urethra (the hole 
where urine comes out of your body) and up into the bladder (the place where urine waits inside your body 
until you go to the bathroom). The catheter is strongly recommended for all  patients but is required for 
patients < 12 years of age.  If the catheter comes out for any reason, it will most likely have to be replaced. 
The catheter will be removed at the time of discharge  (3-5 days) .  
 
You will also take a medicine by mouth [potassi um iodide (SSKI)] to prevent thyroid damage from the 
radioactive iodine contained in the 131I-MIBG compound. The medicine will be taken together by mouth 
beginning before treatment and continuing for a total of 6 weeks. This will be taken every 4 hours for  the 
first 7 days after the MIBG infusion and then daily for the remainder of the 6 weeks.  
 
 
Treatment with Dinutuximab and GM -CSF 
All patients on this study will receive the same dose of dinutuximab. It will be administered IV over 10 -20 
hours, once daily for four consecutive days  in the hospital . Patients will also receive GM -CSF beginning 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   102 
 with dinutuximab and continuing for a total of 10 doses . GM-CSF is a substance that is similar to one made 
by the body. Under normal circumstances, the body makes small amounts of GM -CSF that help  it to 
produce normal infection fighting white blood cells. It is now possible to make GM -CSF outside of the body 
and give humans much higher doses than their own bodies make. There is some evidence that, in the lab 
and in  animals, GM -CSF increases the anti -cancer effect of monoclonal antibodies like dinutuximab. GM -
CSF is administered under the skin [subcutaneously (SQ)] except in special circum stances when it can be 
given IV  
 
Stem Cell Infusion  
All patients on this study will receive an  autologous stem cell infusion on Day 15.  You will receive your 
stored stem cells back by vein two weeks after the 131I-MIBG infusion. This may be done as a day visit to 
the hospital or may require a brief (one night) stay in the hosp ital.  The stem cells can be given at any NANT 
hospital .  
 
If you develop a low white blood count, you may receive GM-CSF (Leukine/sargramostim), G-CSF 
(Neupogen), or pegfilgrastim (Neulasta)  in order to help your white blood cells recover faster after tre atment, 
though it is strongly recommended that GM -CSF be the only growth factor used. GM-CSF, G -CSF, or 
pegfilgrastim will be given under the skin (SQ). You may also get a dose (or doses) of one of these 
medicines after you have received your stem cells, e ven if your blood counts are not low yet.  
 
You can receive this therapy two times as part of this study, as long as:  
• your tumor is not getting worse;  
• you have not had any other anti -cancer treatments since the first course;  
• you have enough stem cells to g et a second course; and  
• you have not had any bad side effects from the first course.  
 
The second course cannot start earlier than 8 weeks from the date of the first 131I-MIBG infusion.   The 
following tests and procedures will be done during the study.  They are part of regular cancer care.  
 
A medical history & physical  exam  Bone marrow tests to check your tumor  
Blood tests  Various scans to check your tumor  
Pregnancy test (urine or blood)  Echocardiogram to check the heart function 
Urine tests   
 
NANT Biology Study (N ANT 2004 -05) 
You will also be expected to join a companion NANT biology study to collect blood, bone marrow and tumor 
tissue (if available) and reports from radiology scans from patients with neuroblastoma. The biology study 
also provides a place (called NANT biorepository) where any leftover samples of tumor tissue or  bone 
marrow and blood collected on this study could be transferred and stored. While you will be asked to join 
the Biology Study (NANT 2004 -05), the decision to store/bank any leftover samples is optional and will not 
affect your ability to participate in  this treatment study with 131I-MIBG and dinutuximab.  Your doctor will talk 
with you in detail about th e NANT biology  study and have you sign a separate consent form.  
 
When You Have Finished Treatment with 131I-MIBG and Dinutuximab   
After you stop treatme nt on this study, you will continue to have tests and scans done (listed below) to 
measure how much tumor is left. If test results show you have abnormal organ function, tests are 
recommended by the study to be repeated monthly until test results are stabl e or normal. You doctor will 
tell you how often these tests and evaluations will be done.  
 
 
Medical Tests after the Study:  
 
Physical exam   Bone marrow tests & various scans to check your tumor1 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   103 
 Blood tests   
1Bone marrow tests and various scans (CT/MRI, MIBG) are done for checking the response of your tumor 
to treatment.  These tests will be done at the end of a course and at certain times following treatment to 
monitor your tumor status.  
A table detailing the tests and procedures required before , during and after the study has been attached to 
the end of this consent.  
 
 
Additional Tests in this Study  
We would like to do some extra tests called correlative biology studies.  These tests will help us learn more 
about  treatmen t with  131I-MIBG and dinutuximab and may help children and adole scents who receive this drug 
in the future.  The information learned would not change the way you are treated and the results of these tests 
will not be given to you.  Some of these tests are required but othe rs are optional meaning you can decide 
whether you want to do them or not. All of these tests  (required and optional)  will be done only during the first 
course.  
 
Evaluation of Immune Function  – Required  
During this study blood samples will be collected to look at changes in your immune function before and after 
treatment with 131I-MIBG  and dinutuximab . We will look at changes in the number and function of certain cells 
of the immune system, as well as mea sure levels of certain proteins that cause inflammation in the body. We 
will collect 13 mL (~2.5 teaspoons) of blood with each sample at 5 different time points  during course 1 ONLY.  
The total amount of blood drawn for testing will be 65 mL (13 teaspoons). If you have a central line ( such as 
a port or a Broviac ) these samples can be drawn through that line  or through a small tube placed in a vein in 
your hand or arm .  This amount of blood is considered safe to donate. Samples will be sent to Chil dren’s 
Healthcare of Atlanta for testing.  
 
Testing for Antibodies Against Dinutuximab  – Required  
During this study  blood samples will be collected to look for antibodies that attach to dinutuximab, and also to 
look at how many of these antibodies make it so the dinutuximab can’t attack your neuroblastoma. The amount 
of blood required for this test is < 1 mL  (less than  ¼ teaspoon)  and it will be taken from the amount collected 
as part of the immune functions studies at 3 of the  5 time points , and two additional time points.  We will collect 
8 mL (~1.5 teaspoon) of blood at each of these two additional time points , both t o test for the antibodies 
against dinutuximab and to save for future testing of changes in your immune function.  
 
Other Biology Research Tests in this Study - Optional  
You will be asked if you want to participate in other optional research tests.  You can decide not to let the 
doctors do these tests and still be able to be treated as part of this study. Your care will be unaffected even if 
you say “no” to participating in an y or all of these optional research studies.  There are checkboxes at the end 
of this form to mark whether you are willing to participate in these voluntary studies. The results of these 
research test s will not be shared with you or become part of your medi cal record.  These results would also 
not be used to make decisions about your care while enrolled on this study.      
 
• Using extra blood to look for proteins and genetic changes in your cells.  
Part of the research goal for this study is to look for the pre sence of and changes in certain proteins 
and genes in the blood that might affect your response to treatment. We would like to collect this 
blood before, during, and after treatment on this study.  
 
o For the tests looking at the genes in your cells (DNA), n o additional blood draw is required. 
The sample would be obtained from the blood that is collected for the testing of the cells of 
your immune system at the 5 time points described above.  
 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   104 
 o For the tests looking at proteins or at certain genes that affect your body’s immune response, 
an additional 2.5  mL (1/2 teaspoon) of blood will be collected  at 8 different time points  during 
course 1.  The total amount of blood drawn for this testing will be 20 mL (4 teaspoons). If 
you have a central line (such as  a port or a Broviac) these samples can be drawn through 
that line or through a small tube placed in a vein in your hand or arm.  This amount of blood 
is considered safe to donate. Samples will be sent to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta for 
testing.   
 
• Evaluate tumor tissue for immune system cells that surround and invade your tumor . 
Part of the research goal for this study is to learn more about the cells of your immune system that 
surround and invade your tumor, and learn how these cells change after t reatment with 131I-MIBG 
and dinutuximab. We would also like to perform genetic studies on  a small amount of your blood in 
addition to  the tumor tissue to better understand your immune response. These tumor samples and 
tests would be used to see whether we can predict response to treatment based on the kinds of cells 
we see around and in side your tumor.  
 
o If you agree we w ould ask for  three mL (approximately 1/2 teaspoon) of peripheral  blood to 
be drawn  and leftover tumor tissue from the most recent time point in the past when tumor 
tissue was removed (removal of primary tumor or removal of tumor at a relapse) to be sent 
together to a research laboratory for testing.   The laboratory uses the blood sent with your 
tumor  for determining the genetic make -up of your normal cells (known as germline testing) 
that is used to compare to the genetic make -up of your tumor.  The researchers will look for 
any changes in the genetic make -up of the tumor that are different from those  changes found 
in your normal genetic material obtained from your blood sample . 
o To see how treatment with MIBG and dinutuximab affects the immune cells around and in 
your tumor, if you agree, we would also like to ask for tumor tissue that might be collect ed  in 
the future if your doctor thinks it is in your best interest to have more of your tumor removed 
for any reason. This would happen after you have finished treatment on this study, but before 
you receive any additional therapy for your neuroblastoma.  
 
We will not remove tissue just for these additional studies. The tissue will be sent to a research 
laboratory at Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles for testing.   
 
HOW LONG WILL I BE ON THIS STUDY?   
You can get two treatment courses with 131I-MIBG and dinutuximab  as long as you are not having bad side 
effects and as long as your tumor is not getting worse .   
 
After you stop treatment, y ou will continue to have tests and scans done to measure how much tumor is  left. 
Your doctor will tell you how often these tests will be done. Researchers will continue to collect information 
about you for a lifetime. Information will be collected about whether you are still alive; whether your tumor has 
grown back and at what s ites in the body; whether you have developed any side effects from the treatment; 
or whether you have developed any additional cancer. Your doctor will give the researchers this information 
at regular intervals.  
 
CAN I STOP BEING IN THE STUDY?  
Yes. If you are thinking about stopping your participation on this study, you should talk to your doctor before 
making a final decision so he/she can tell you how to do this safely. There are certain time points in the 
study where it would be strongly recommended that  you complete the medical supportive care required to 
avoid very bad and/or fatal side effects.  
 
• Once you have gotten 131I-MIBG treatment, you will stay in the special room until you are no longer 
radioactive (usually 5 days), since you could expose others to radiation.  
 
• Once you have gotten 131I-MIBG treatment, it would be strongly recommended that you complete the 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   105 
 medical supportive care needed to avoid very bad and/or fatal side effects. This includes the stem cell 
infusion and the potassium iodide  for thyroid protection.  
 
Your doctor may also stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in your best 
interest , if you do not follow study rules , or if the study is stopped . 
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?  
This is a Phase 1 study.  A Phase 1 study looks at how common and serious side effects can be for each 
patient at a specific dose of a drug. In a Phase 1 study, some patients may have very serious side effects 
and could die as a result of these side effect s. You may be one of those patients who have serious side 
effects as a result of participating in this Phase 1 study.  
 
In this study, researchers will be looking at side effects seen in patients taking different doses of 131I-MIBG 
in combination with dinu tuximab . Though  subjects will be assigned to different dose levels of 131I-MIBG , all 
doses of 131I-MIBG being tested have been shown to be effective against neuroblastoma.  
 
Everyone taking part in the study will be watched carefully for any side effects. However, doctors don’t know 
all the side effects that may happen. Side effects may be mild or very serious. Other drugs may be given 
to make side effects less serious and more comfortable (such as for nausea, headache , itching). Many side 
effects go away s oon after you stop taking the study medications but it is always possible that side effects 
can be serious, long lasting or may never go away. There is also a risk of death. Patients are watched 
carefully and treatment will be stopped if bad side effects d evelop. There may also be risks we do not know 
about. You should talk to your doctor about any side effects that you have while taking part in this study.  
 
While on the study, you are at risk for the side effects listed below:  
 
Possible Risks of 131I-MIBG  
 
Likely   
(happens to 21 -100 children out 
of every 100 children)  Less Likely  
(happens to 5 -20 children out  of every 
100 children)  Rare  
(happens to < 5 children out of every 
100 children)  
• Decrease in the number of 
red and white blood cells 
and platelets made in the 
bone marrow.  You may 
need blood and platelet 
transfusions and sometimes 
stem cell infusions are 
necessary.  (Stem cells are 
required on this trial) The 
dose of 131I-MIBG used in  
this study will lower your 
blood counts.  
• Nausea  
• Dry mouth  
• Increase in blood marker of 
salivary gland irritation (your 
serum amylase will 
increase)  • Decreased function of the thyroid 
gland.  This causes tiredness 
(fatigue), weight gain, constipation, 
and lower blood pressure. 
Treatment for life with a medicine 
to supplement the thyroid gland 
(i.e. Synthroid or related thyroid 
supplement) may be needed.  
•  Not being able to get pregnant or 
father a child  
• High or low blood pressure during 
or after the 131I-MIBG infusion  
• Thinning of the hair

cells 
• Fatigue due to low red blood cells  
• Bleeding/bruising due to low 
platelets  
• Loss of appetite  
 • Pain in salivary glands or mouth  
• Decreased function of adrenal 
gland. This affects your activity 
level and growth.  It causes 
tiredness (fatigue), weight 
changes and blood pressure 
changes.  You may need to take 
medicine to supp lement the 
adrenal gland.  
• Decreased heart function  
• Irritation of the liver. Because 
some of the radioactive 131I-
MIBG is taken up by the liver, 
there is a possible risk of future 
liver damage from the 131I-MIBG 
alone.  
• Second cancer (such as 
leukemia) that is different from 
the kind of cancer you have 
now 
• Trouble breathing due to 
infection or damage to the lung

 • Overactive thyroid gland  
Possible risks from having a bladder catheter placed  
In order to safely receive MIBG therapy, you will need to a have a tube or catheter called a Foley catheter 
temporarily placed in your bladder. The catheter may cause you some discomfort and may increase your 
risk for getting a bladder infection.  
 
Possible Risks  of Potassium Iodide   
Likely   
(happens to 21 -100 children out 
of every 100 children)  Less Likely

NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   108 
 Possible Risk s Associated with Stem Cells 
 
• ANY TIME BEFORE STEM CELL INFUSION:  The freezer where PBSC are stored could 
malfunction, the container holding them could break and the stem cells could be damaged so they 
could not be used. This is expected to be an extremely rare event. However, if this occurs, another 
stem cell collection may be attempted or the back -up stem cells (if available) may be used if they 
were not damaged.  
 
• If stem cells need  to be shipped from one location to another, they could be lost or damaged during 
shipping such that they could not be used. This is expected to be an extre mely rare event. If this 
occurs, another stem cell collection may be attempted or the back -up stem cells, if available, may 
be used.  
 
• Some patients may need extra fluids given into the vein after getting their stem cells.  This is to 
protect the kidneys fr om the red blood cells mixed in with the stem cells.   
 
Likely  
(happens to 21 -100 
children out of every 100 
children)  Less Likely  
(happens to 5 -20 
children out of every 100 
children)  Rare  
(happens to < 5 children out of every 100 children)  
 • Fever and chills  • Allergic reaction.  Can cause difficulty 
breathing and low blood pressure.  
• High blood pressure  
• Infection  
• Infusion of tumor cells. Tumor cells may still be 
present in the harvested stem cells and they 
could regrow after stem cells are infused.  
• Cough  
• Chest Tightness  
• Flushing  
• Nausea and/or vomiting  
• Rash  
• Irregular Heart Beat  
 
Herbs and Supplements  
Some drugs or supplements may interact with your treatment plan. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or study 
team before starting any new prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, herbals, or supplements and 
before making a significant change in your diet. Supplements may come in many forms, such as teas, 
drinks, juices, liquids, drops, capsules, pills, or dried herbs. All forms should be avoided.  
  
Possible Risks to Unborn Child  
Patients who agree to participate in this study should not become pregnant while on this study. Patients 
and their sexual partners should avoid sex and /or use two effective methods of contraception that are 
medically appropriate based on your personal doctor’s recommendation at that time and should be used 
for as long as you participate in this study.  If you or your partner becomes pregnant while you a re 
participating in this study, please notify your doctor immediately.  For more information about risks and 
side effects, ask your doctor.  
 
Possible Risks to the Caregiver(s) of the Patient Getting 131I-MIBG Treatment  
Caregivers (example: parent, other fa mily member, guardian, friend, partner) will be exposed to radiation 
while you are being treated with MIBG.  Caregivers who could possibly become pregnant during this time 
need to avoid contact with the patient because the radiation exposure may increase t he unborn baby’s 
risk of developing  cancer or other health problems.   
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   109 
 If your caregiver is pregnant, then special precautions should be used to avoid contact with you during 
and for 4 weeks after getting MIBG treatment.  Should your caregiver or your care giver’s sexual partner 
be found to have been pregnant while you were getting MIBG treatment and did not know it at the time, 
please contact your doctor immediately .  
 
Possible Long Term Risk of This Treatment  
• Recurrence of tumor  
• Infection  
• Sterility and/or delayed onset of puberty  
• Increased risk of a second cancer (such as leukemia) different from the kind of cancer you have now.  
• Patients who have more than one 131I-MIBG treatment will have greater doses of radiation to the 
normal organs tha n those patients having one treatment. It is possible that there may be later damage 
to the normal function of the liver or other organs.  
 
Possible Risks from Having Blood Drawn  
The risks from having your blood taken are minimal, but can include an infecti on or a blood clot. You may also 
experience some pain or bruising at the site your blood was drawn. Experienced doctors or nurses will perform 
these blood draws to minimize this risk. You will be asked to sign a separate consent for any procedure that 
needs sedation.  
 
Possible Risks from Germline Genetic Testing    
If you agree to participation in the optional test looking at immune system cells in your tumor and immune 
response, a small amount of your blood will be collected . Researchers will  use the blood sent with your tumor 
for determining the genetic make -up of your normal cells (known as germline testing) that is used as a baseline 
to compare to the genetic make -up of your tumor. This helps the laboratory in identifying the genetic changes 
they may see in your tumor tissue.  
 
The germline genetic testing is for research purposes o nly and is performed  on de -identified samples, and so 
the information can’t be linked back to your child. Hence, the results will not be sent to you or your physician.  
 
Unknown Risks  
This treatment combination may have side effects that no one knows about yet.   The researchers will let you 
know if they learn anything that might make you change your mind about participating in the study.  
 
 
ARE THERE BENEFITS TO  TAKING PART IN THE STUDY?  
There may or may not be direct medical benefit to you. The information learned from this study may or may

 CONSENT FOR EXTRA STUDIES FOR RESEARCH   
 
The following tests are optional for all patients in the study. You may still participate in the study 
even if you do not agree to these tests.  
 
1. Using extra blood to look for proteins and genetic changes in your cells.  
 
Initial next to YES if you agree to let researchers use some of the blood (less than ¼ teaspoon) already 
drawn for one of the  required studies to look at certain immune cell genes and how changes in these genes 
might affect how you respond to the treatmen t.   No extra  blood needs to be drawn from you to do this 
optional test.  The results of th is test will be confidential and not made available to you or your treating 
physician.  
 
Initial next to NO if you do not want researchers to use some of the blood already drawn for a required test 
to look at immune cell genes .    
 
_______Yes      _______No    
 
Initial next to YES if you agree to let resear chers take an extra half teaspoon (2.5 mL) of blood 8 different 
times to look for certain proteins and changes in these proteins that might affect your response to treatment 
with 131I-MIBG and dinutuximab.   This blood would be drawn at a time when blood wa s being drawn for 
clinical purposes.  The results of th is test will be confidential and not made available to you or your treating 
physician.  
 
Initial next to NO if you do not want researchers to take extra blood above what is needed for clinical 
purposes.  
 
_______Yes      _______No  
 
2. Evaluate tumor tissue for immune system c ells that surround and invade your tumor  and 
the genes that cause an immune response , and if possible also comparing immune system cells in 
tumor samples from before and after treatment with MIBG and dinutuximab . 
 
Initial next to YES  if you agree  to let  researchers collect 3 mL (about ½ teaspoon) of blood to be sent together 
with any leftover tumor (if available from an earlier procedure)  to a laboratory so researchers can learn more 
about the immune system cells that surround and invade your tumor  and genes that cause an immune  
respon se. Looking at the immune response genes  involve s comparing your normal genetic information gotten 
from the blood sample  (called germline)  to the genetic information of your tumor and determining what is 
different between the two.  The results of these tests will be confidential and not made avai lable to you or your 
treating doctor.

NANT 2017 -01:  A PHASE I STUDY OF 131I-MIBG WITH DINUTUXIMAB  +/- VORINOSTAT  FOR 
RELAPSED/REFRACTORY NEUROBLASTOMA  
 
FOR PATIENTS ON PART B  
 
A New Approaches to Neuroblastoma Therapy (NANT) treatment protocol.  
 
The word “you” used throughout this document refers to you or your child.  
 
WHAT IS THIS STUDY ABOUT?  
This study is a clinical trial, a type of research study. Clinical trials include only patients who choose to take 
part. Please take your time to make your decision about participating. You may discuss your decision with 
your friends, family, and health care team. If you have any questions, you may ask your doctor.  
 
You are being asked to pa rticipate in this study because you have a kind of cancer called neuroblastoma. 
It may be that your cancer went away for a while but has grown back (relapsed) or it may be that it has 
never gone away (persistent or resistant tumor) after standard treatment . Standard treatment may have 
included chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, high -dose chemotherapy with a stem cell transplant 
and/or immunotherapy.  
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
 
The purposes of this study are:  
 
• To find the highest safe dose of vorinostat that can be given with 131I-MIBG and dinutuximab to 
children with refractory or recurrent neuroblastoma without causing severe side effects  
• To find out what side effects there are from giving vorinostat, 131I-MIBG , and dinutuximab together 
on this s chedule  
• To see if your tumor gets smaller after treatment with vorinostat, 131I-MIBG , and dinutuximab  
• To learn what happens to your immune system and other proteins that cause inflammation when 
giving vorinostat and  131I-MIBG with dinutuximab.  
• To see what  effect giving vorinostat and 131I-MIBG has on your body in making an antibody to the 
dinutuximab  
• To see what effect treatment with vorinostat and 131I-MIBG in combination with dinutuximab has on 
the cells of your immune system that surround and invade you r tumor  
• To describe the amount of neuroblastoma tumor found in the blood and bone marrow by testing 
samples with a new test (called NB5 assay).  
 
The research is being done because:  
Currently there is no known effective treatment for neuroblastoma that has returned or that has not 
responded to treatment.   
 
This study will use an intravenous (IV)  chemical agent called metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) together 
with an oral drug called vorinostat and an IV drug called dinutuximab. MIBG is taken up by neuroblastoma 
tumor cells. MIBG can be combined with radioactive iodine (131I) in the laboratory to form the radioactive 
compound 131I-MIBG. 131I-MIBG delivers radiation to the neuroblastoma cancer cells and causes them to 
die. 131I-MIBG lowers the number of blood forming cells (called stem cells) in the bone marrow when it is 
given at higher doses as in this study. Because of this,  all patients will get back their own stem cells to help 
the bone marrow recover from this therapy.   
 
Vorinostat is a drug tha t is FDA -approved to treat a certain type of cancer mainly seen in adults. Vorinostat 
affects the way the DNA that carries our genes is folded in cells. In the laboratory, vorinostat causes 
neuroblastoma cells to stop growing. This effect is even greater w hen vorinostat is combined with radiation. 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   117 
 A recent clinical trial has shown that g iving vorinostat together with 131I-MIBG increase s the number of 
patients who respond to 131I-MIBG  compared to giving 131I-MIBG  by itself . Laboratory studies  also show 
that dinutuximab may work better when it is given with vorinostat; however, combining vorinostat with 
dinutuximab either with or without 131I-MIBG  has never been tested in a clinical trial.  
 
Dinutuximab works differently than most standard chemotherapy drugs. Dinutuximab is a monoclonal 
antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins made in the lab, designed to attach to specific targets on 
cancer cells. When dinutuximab attaches to neuroblastoma cells, the body’ s immune system is stimulated 
to attack and kill the neuroblastoma cells. Dinutuximab represents a new kind of cancer therapy called 
immunotherapy which, unlike chemotherapy and radiation, targets the cancer cells without destroying 
nearby healthy cells.  
 
Laboratory studies have shown greater anti -cancer effects when radiation is given before an 
immunotherapy treatment.  Some clinical responses have been seen in adults when radiation has been 
combined with different types of immunotherapy in treating their cancers.  
 
Giving dinutuximab together with  vorinostat and  131I-MIBG may kill more neuroblastoma cells. This is the 
first study to test giving dinutuximab together with vorinostat and 131I-MIBG.   We want to find out if giving 
the combination of vorinostat,  131I-MIBG , and  dinutuximab can be tolerated.  We also want to see how 
effective this drug combination is against relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma.  
 
Dinutuximab is a drug that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating 
newly diagnosed patients with neuroblastoma. The use of dinutuximab in combination with vorinostat and 
131I-MIBG  for the treatment of relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma is considered experimental.  
 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?  
This study has two parts. In the first part of the study, the dose of 131I-MIBG  and dinutuximab  will be 
determined  (Part A) . 30 patients are expected to take part in the first part of the study.  This second part of 
the study  (Part B)  will add vorinostat to this combination.  There will be a pproximately  18 patients enrolling 
on this part of the study  (Part B) .  You are being asked to participate in Part B of this study. When you join 
the study, you will be assigned a certain dose of vor inostat. The doses for 131I-MIBG  and dinutuximab  will 
be the same for all patients on Part B of this study . This study will test one dose of vorinostat in 3 -6 patients. 
The starting dose of vorinostat will be the dose that has been proven safe and effective in previous trials 
giving vorinostat in combination with 131I-MIBG . The 131I-MIBG  and din utuximab doses  will be the  dose s 
that w ere demonstrated to be safe to give together in Part A of the study . This dose of vorinostat will be 
given in 3 to 6 patients. If too many patients have serious side effects then a lower dose of vorinostat will 
be tested in 3 to 6 more patients. The dose level tolerated without serious side effects will be the highest 
dose of vorinostat and 131I-MIBG that can be given in combination with dinutuximab (called the maximum 
tolerated dose).  
   
Once the maximum tolerated dose is determined, a group of 6 mor e patients will be enrolled and treated at 
this dose of vorinostat in combination with 131I-MIBG and dinutuximab , known as the dose expansion part 
of the study.  The purpose of the dose expansion part of the study is to gather more information about side 
effects seen in patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose of vorinostat in combination with 131I-MIBG 
and dinutuximab .  
 
 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME IF I TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?  
 
Before You Begin the Study   
Before you can get treatment on this study, blood stem cells must be available that meet the study 
requirements. We will check your child’s previously stored stem cells to make sure that they can be used 
for the stem cell infusion.  
 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   118 
 You will need to have the following exams, tests or procedur es to find out if you can take part in the study. 
Most of these exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and may be done even if you do 
not join the study. These tests will also be done at various times throughout the study and at the end  of the 
study.  The purpose of these tests is to see how well the treatment works and to measure the status of your 
neuroblastoma.   If you have had some of them recently, they may not need to be repeated. This will be up 
to your doctor.  
 
 
A medical history & physical  exam  Bone marrow tests2 to check your tumor  
Blood tests  Various scans3 to check your tumor  
Pregnancy test (urine or blood)1 Echocardiogram and electrocardiogram to check the heart 
function 
Urine tests   
 
1If you are a female at least 10 years old or who could have children, you will have a pregnancy test done 
by the doctor the week before starting treatment and then before each cycle of treatment begins.  You will 
be informed of a positive pregnancy test. R eporting of a positive pregnancy test to your parent or guardian 
will depend on local and/ or state regulations.   All men and women who could have children must either 
agree to practice abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or use two effective methods of birth control for 
as long as they participate in this study.  
 
2Bone marrow tests are done by inserting a need le into the hip bone to remove the marrow which is inside 
the bone.  
 
3Various scans are done for diagnosis and checking the response of the tumor to treatment. These may 
include CT and /or MRI scans and MIBG scans. We will recommend scans specific for your  case and we 
will answer your questions about these scans . 
 
During the Study    
If the exams, tests and procedures show that you can participate in the study, and you choose to take 
part in the study , the following will be your treatment plan:  
 
• Vorin ostat will be given on Days 0 to +1 3 (14 days)  
• 131I-MIBG  will be given on Day 1  
• Dinutuximab  will be given on Days 8 -11 and Days 29 -32 of each treatment course.   
• The growth factor GM-CSF will be  given on the same days as the dinutuximab and continue after 
the dinutuximab has finished for a total of 10 doses ( Days 8 -17 and Days 29 -38).   
• All patients will be given an infusion of their stem cells  around Day 15 of each course.    
• Each course is around 57 days long . 
• You may receive up to two treatment courses of vorinostat, 131I-MIBG , and dinutuximab as long as 
you are benefiting from the treatment and meet the criteria to continue the treatment safely.

Treatment with Vorinostat  
Patients will be assigned a certain dose level of vorinostat  at time of study registration.  The vorinostat dose 
you are assigned to will not be increased during the study.  Dosing is done this way because we do not yet 
know the best dose of vorinostat to us e in children when it is us ed together with 131I-MIBG and dinutuximab.  
 
The vorinostat is given by a pill or a liquid depending upon your size. If you cannot take medicines by mouth, 
the vorinostat can be given into a tube placed in the nose or stomach. You will receive vorinostat orally 
once daily for 14 days (Days 0 to +1 3). One day after starting vorinostat, 131I-MIBG will be given (Day 1). If 
you vomit  within 15 minutes of taking the vorinostat  you should retake the dose . If you vomit again with the 
second dose you should not try to take the dose again . If you vomi t more than 15 minutes after taking the 
vorinostat you should not try to retake the dose .       
 
Treatment with 131I-MIBG  
Patients will be given the 131I-MIBG  dose that has been shown can be safely given with dinutuximab during 
the first part of this study (Part A) .  Treatment with 131I-MIBG will be done at a hospital that is set up to take 
care of patients that are treated with radioactive substances.  This me ans that you may need to travel some 
distance to another hospital to get this treatment.  Your health care team will talk with you and help you 
plan for the trip to get this treatment.  
 
Patients will be admitted to an 131I-MIBG treatment center one day bef ore starting 131I-MIBG therapy. On 
the following day (Day 1), 131I-MIBG is given into a temporary IV or in your central venous catheter over 90 -
120 minutes.  IV fluids for hydration and other medicines will be given through your central venous catheter.

Patients who get 131I-MIBG are considered to be radioactive and you will stay in the special room until your 
radiation measurement reaches a safe level, usually 3 - 5 days, since you could expose others to radiation.  
Special care precautions include:  
 
• A single room in a bed surrounded by a lead shield to keep family and the staff who take care of you 
from being exposed to radiation from the 131I-MIBG treatment.  
 
• The length of time family can visit inside the room in front  of the protective lead shield tha t is around 
your bed will depend on how much radiation is measured in the room each day by the radiation 
specialist. Usually family can visit for a total of 30 -45 minutes on the first day and longer on the days 
after that because there will be less radiati on measured in the room each day.  
 
• Family may visit anytime outside of the room or behind a lead shield. You will be able to see who is 
visiting over this shield.  
 
• No one will be able to spend the night in this special room with you during this time.  
 
Your urine will be radioactive after treatment with 131I-MIBG. A urinary catheter may be inserted to drain the 
radioactive urine from your body. The catheter is strongly recommended for all patients but is required for 
patients < 12 years of age.  If the cathe ter comes out for any reason, it will most likely have to be replaced. 
The catheter will be removed at the time of discharge (3 -5 days).  
 
You will also take a medicine by mouth [potassium iodide (SSKI)] to prevent thyroid damage from the 
radioactive iodin e contained in the 131I-MIBG compound. This medicine will be taken by mouth or by tube 
before beginning treatment and will continue to be taken for a total of 6 weeks. This will be taken every 4 
hours for the first 7 days after the 131I-MIBG infusion and then daily for the remainder of the 6 weeks.  
 
Treatment with Dinutuximab and GM -CSF 
All patients on this study will receive the same dose of dinutuximab. It will be administered IV over 10 -20 
hours, once daily for four consecutive days in the hospital. Patients will also receive GM -CSF beginning 
with dinutuximab and continuing for a total of 10 doses . GM-CSF is a substance that is similar to one made 
by the body. Under normal circumstances, the body makes small amounts of GM -CSF that help  it to 
produce normal infection fighting white blood cells. It is now possible to make GM -CSF outside of the body 
and give humans much higher doses than their own bodies mak e. There is some evidence that, in the lab 
and in animals, GM -CSF increases the anti -cancer effect of monoclonal antibodies like dinutuximab. GM -
CSF is administered under the skin [subcutaneously (SQ)] except in special circumstances when it can be 
given I V. 
 
Stem Cell Infusion  
All patients on this study will receive an  autologous stem cell infusion  (an infusion of your previously collected 
stem cells)  at about Day 15  which is around 2 weeks from the 131I-MIBG  infusion .  You will receive your 
stored stem cells back by vein. This may be done as a day visit to the hospital or may require a brief (one 
night) stay in the hospital. The stem cells can be given at any NANT hospital.  
 
If you develop a low white blood count, you may receive GM -CSF (Leukine/sargramostim), G -CSF 
(Neupogen), or pegfilgrastim (Neulasta)  in order to help your white blood cells recover faster after treatment, 
though it is strongly recommended that GM -CSF be the only growth factor used. GM -CSF, G -CSF, or  
pegfilgrastim will be given under the skin (SQ). You may also get a dose (or doses) of one of these 
medicines after you have received your stem cells, even if your blood counts are not low yet.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   121 
 You can receive this therapy two times as part of this study, as long as:  
• your tumor is not getting worse;  
• you have not had any other anti -cancer treatments since the first course;  
• you have enough stem cells to get a second course; and  
• you have not had any  bad side effects from the first course.  
 
The second course cannot start earlier than 8 weeks from the date of the first 131I-MIBG infusion.  The 
following tests and procedures will be done during the study.  They are part of regular cancer care.  
 
A medical history & physical  exam  Bone marrow tests to check your tumor  
Blood tests  Various scans to check your tumor  
Pregnancy test (urine or blood)  Echocardiogram and electrocardiogram to check the heart 
function 
Urine tests   
 
NANT Biology Study (N ANT2004 -05) 
You will be required  to join a companion NANT biology study to collect blood, bone marrow and tumor 
tissue (if available) and reports from radiology scans from patients with neuroblastoma. The biology study 
also provides a place (called NANT bi orepository) where any leftover samples of tumor tissue or bone 
marrow and blood collected on this study could be transferred and stored. While you will be required  to join 
the Biology Study (NANT 2004 -05), the decision to store/bank any leftover samples i s optional and will not 
affect your ability to participate in this treatment study with vorinostat, 131I-MIBG , and dinutuximab.  Your 
doctor will talk with you in detail about the NANT biology study and have you sign a separate consent form.  
 
When You Have  Finished Treatment with Vorinostat, 131I-MIBG , and Dinutuximab   
After you stop treatment on this study, you will continue to have tests and scans done (listed below) to see 
how you are doing . If test results show you have abnormal organ function, tests are recommended by the 
study to be repeated monthly until test resu lts are stable or normal. You doctor will tell you how often these 
tests and evaluations will be done.  
 
Medical Tests after the Study:  
 
Physical exam   Bone marrow tests & various scans to check your tumor1 
Blood tests   
1Bone marrow tests and various scans (CT/MRI, MIBG) are done for checking the response of your tumor 
to treatment.  These tests will be done at the end of a course and at certain times following treatment to 
monitor your tumor status.  
 
A table detailing the tests and procedures required before, during and after the study has been attached to 
the end of this consent.  
 
Additional Tests in this Study  
We would like to do some extra tests calle d correlative biology studies. These tests will help us learn more 
about treatment with vorinostat, 131I-MIBG , and dinutuximab and may help children and adolescents who 
receive this drug in the future. The information learned would not change the way you are treated and the 
results of these tests will not be given to you.  Some of these tests are required but others are optional meaning 
you can decide whether you want to do them or not. All of these tests (required and optional) will be done only 
during the first course.  
 
 
 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   122 
 Evaluation of Immune Function – Required  
During this study blood samples will be collected to look at changes in your immune function before and after 
treatment with vorinostat, 131I-MIBG , and dinutuximab. We will look at changes in the number and function of 
certain cells of the immune system, a s well as measure levels of certain proteins that cause inflammation in 
the body. We will collect 13 mL (~2.5 teaspoons) of blood with each sample at 6 different time points during 
Course 1 ONLY. The total amount of blood drawn for testing will be 78 mL (~15.5 teaspoons). If you have a 
central line (such as a port or a Broviac) these samples can be drawn through that line or through a small tube 
placed in a vein in your hand or arm .  This amount of blood is considered safe to donate. Samples will be s ent 
to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta for testing.  
 
Testing for Antibodies Against Dinutuximab  – Required  
During this study blood samples will be collected to look for antibodies that attach to dinutuximab, and also to 
look at how many of these antibodie s make it so the dinutuximab can’t attack your neuroblastoma. The amount 
of blood required for this test is < 1 mL (less than ¼ teaspoon) and it will be taken from the amount collected 
as part of the immune functions studies at 3 of the 5 time points, and two additional time points.  We will collect 
8 mL (~1.5 teaspoon s) of blood at each of these two additional time points, both to test for the antibodies 
against dinutuximab and to save for future testing of changes in your immune function.  
 
Other Biology Re search Tests in this Study - Optional  
You will be asked if you want to participate in other optional research tests.  You can decide not to let the 
doctors do these tests and still be able to be treated as part of this study.  There are checkboxes at  the end 
of this form to mark whether you are willing to participate in these voluntary studies. The results of these 
research tests will not be shared with you or become part of your medical record.  These results would also 
not be used to make decisions about your care while enrolled on this study.     
 
• Using extra blood to look for proteins and genetic changes in your cells.  
Part of the research goal for this study is to look for the presence of and changes in certain proteins 
and genes in the blood that might affect your response to treatment. We would like to collect this 
blood before, during, and after treatment on this stu dy.  
 
o For the tests looking at the genes in your cells (DNA), no additional blood draw is required. 
The sample would be obtained from the blood that is collected for the testing of the cells of 
your immune system at the 6 time points described above.  
 
o For the tests looking at proteins or at certain genes that affect your body’s immune response, 
an additional 2.5 mL (1/2 teaspoon) of blood will be collected at 9 different time points during 
course 1. The total amount of blood d rawn for this testing will be 22.5 mL (4 .5 teaspoons). 
If you have a central line (such as a port or a Broviac) these samples can be drawn through 
that line or through a small tube placed in a vein in your hand or arm.  This amount of blood 
is considered safe to donate. Samples will be  sent to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta for 
testing.  
 
• Evaluate tumor tissue for immune system cells that surround and invade your tumor.  
Part of the research goal for this study is to learn more about the cells of your immune system that 
surround and invade your tumor, and learn how these cells change after treatment with  vorinostat,  
131I-MIBG , and dinutuximab. We would also like to perform genetic studies on a small amount of 
your blood in addition to the tumor tissue to better understand  your immune response. These tumor 
samples and tests would be used to see whether we can predict response to treatment based on 
the kinds of cells we see around and inside your tumor.  
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   123 
 o To see how treatment with vorinostat, 131I-MIBG , and dinutuximab affec ts the immune cells 
around and in your tumor, if you agree, we would also like to ask for tumor tissue that might 
be collected in the future if your doctor thinks it is in your best interest to have more of your 
tumor removed for any reason. This would hap pen after you have finished treatment on this 
study, but before you receive any additional therapy for your neuroblastoma.  
o If you agree we would ask for 3 mL (approximately 1/2 teaspoon) of peripheral blood  to be 
drawn and leftover tumor tissue from the most recent time point in the past when tumor tissue 
was removed (removal of primary tumor or removal of tumor at a relapse) to be sent together 
to a research laboratory for testing.  The laboratory uses the blo od sent with your tumor for 
determining the genetic make -up of your normal cells (known as germline testing) that is 
used to compare to the genetic make -up of your tumor.  The researchers will look for any 
changes in the genetic make -up of the tumor that a re different from those changes found in 
your normal genetic material obtained from your blood sample  
 
We will not remove tissue just for these additional studies. The tissue will be sent to a research 
laboratory at Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles for t esting.   
 
HOW LONG WILL I BE ON THIS STUDY?  
You can get two treatment courses with vorinostat, 131I-MIBG , and dinutuximab as long as you are not 
having bad side effects and as long as your tumor is not getting worse  and your insurance allows you to 
get vorin ostat and GM -CSF.    
 
After you stop treatment, y ou will continue to have tests and scans done to measure how much tumor is left. 
Your doctor will tell you how often these tests will be done. Researchers will continue to collect information 
about you for a lifetime. Information will be collected about wh ether you are still alive; whether your tumor has 
grown back and at what sites in the body; whether you have developed any side effects from the treatment; 
or whether you have developed any additional cancer. Your doctor will give the researchers this info rmation 
at regular intervals.  
 
CAN I STOP BEING IN THE STUDY?  
Yes. If you are thinking about stopping your participation on this study, you should talk to your doctor before 
making a final decision so he/she can tell you how to do this safely. There are ce rtain time points in the 
study where it would be strongly recommended that you complete the medical supportive care required to 
avoid very bad and/or fatal side effects.  
 
• Once you have gotten 131I-MIBG treatment, you will stay in the special room until you  are no longer 
radioactive (usually 5 days), since you could expose others to radiation.  
 
• Once you have gotten 131I-MIBG treatment, it would be strongly recommended that you complete the 
medical supportive care needed to avoid very bad and/or fatal side ef fects. This includes the stem cell 
infusion and the potassium iodide for thyroid protection.  
 
Your doctor may also stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in your best 
interest , if you do not follow study rules , or if the study is stopped . 
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?  
This is a Phase 1 study.  A Phase 1 study looks at how common and serious side effects can be for each 
patient at a specific dose of a drug. In a Phase 1 stud y, some patients may have very serious side effects 
and could die as a result of these side effects. You may be one of those patients who have serious side 
effects as a result of participating in this Phase 1 study.  
 
 
 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   124 
 In this study, researchers will be l ooking at side effects seen in patients taking vorinostat and  131I-MIBG in 
combination with dinutuximab. The dose  of 131I-MIBG you will receive has  been shown to be e ffective 
against neuroblastoma, and a recent study has shown that giving vorinostat with 131I-MIBG  increases the 
number of patients who will respond to 131I-MIBG . 
 
Everyone taking part in the study will be watched carefully for any side effects. However, doctors don’t know 
all the side effects that may happen. Side effects may be mild or very serious. Other drugs may be given 
to make side effects less serious and more comfortable (such as for nausea, headache , itching). Many side 
effects go away soon after you stop taking the study medications but it is always possible that side effects 
can be serious, long lasting or may never go away. There is also a risk of death. Patients are watched 
carefully and treatment will be stopped if bad side effects develop. There may also be risks we do not know 
about. You should talk to your doctor about any  side effects that you have while taking part in this study.  
 
While on the study, you are at risk for the side effects listed below:

of the heart tracing known 
as an EKG. (Mild changes 
in a specific part of the 
heart tracing known as an 
EKG has been rarely 
reported in patients treated 
with vorinostat, though it is 
not clear whether vori nostat 
caused these changes or 
not.)

NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   125 
 Possible Risks of 131I-MIBG  
 
Likely   
(happens to 21 -100 children out  
of every 100 children)  Less Likely  
(happens to 5 -20 children out of every 
100 children)  Rare  
(happens to < 5 children out  of every 
100 children)  
• Decrease in the number of 
red and white blood cells 
and platelets made in the 
bone marrow.  You may 
need blood and platelet 
transfusions and sometimes 
stem cell infusions are 
necessary.  (Stem cells are 
required on this trial) The 
dose of 131I-MIBG used in 
this study will lower your 
blood counts.  
• Nausea  
• Dry mouth  
• Increase in blood marker of 
salivary gland irritation (your 
serum amylase will 
increase)  • Decreased function of the thyroid 
gland.  This causes tiredness 
(fatigue), weight gain, constipation , 
and lower blood pressure. 
Treatment for life with a medicine 
to supplement the thyroid gland 
(i.e. Synthroid or related thyroid 
supplement) may be needed.  
•  Not being able to get pregnant or 
father a child  
• High or low blood pressure during 
or after the 131I-MIBG infusion  
• Thinning of the hair  
• Vomiting  
• Infection due to low white blood 
cells 
• Fatigue due to low red blood cells  
• Bleeding/bruising due to low 
platelets  
• Loss of appetite  
 • Pain in salivary glands or mo uth 
• Decreased function of adrenal 
gland. This affects your activity 
level and growth.  It causes 
tiredness (fatigue), weight 
changes and blood pressure 
changes.  You may need to take 
medicine to supplement the 
adrenal gland.  
• Decreased heart function  
• Irritation of the liver. Because 
some of the radioactive 131I-
MIBG is taken up by the liver, 
there is a possible risk of future 
liver damage from the 131I-MIBG 
alone.  
• Second cancer (such as 
leukemia) that is different from 
the kind of cancer you have 
now 
• Trouble  breathing due to 
infection or damage to the lung  
• Overactive thyroid gland  
 
Possible risks from having a bladder catheter placed  
In order to safely receive 131I-MIBG therapy, you will need to a have a tube or catheter called a Foley 
catheter temporarily placed in your bladder. The catheter may cause you some discomfort and may 
increase your risk for getting a bladder infection.

Possible Risks Associated with Stem Cells  
 
• ANY TIME BEFORE STEM CELL INFUSION: The freezer where PBSC are stored could 
malfunction, the container holding them could break and the stem cells could be damaged so they 
could not be used. This is expected to be an extremely rare event. However, if this occurs, another 
stem cell collection may be attempted or the back -up stem cells (if available) may be used if they 
were no t damaged.  
 
• If stem cells need  to be shipped from one location to another, they could be lost or damaged during 
shipping such that they could not be used. This is expected to be an extremely rare event. If this 
occurs, another stem cell collection may be  attempted or the back -up stem cells, if available, may 
be used.  
 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   128 
 • Some patients may need extra fluids given into the vein after getting their stem cells.  This is to 
protect the kidneys from the red blood cells mixed in with the stem cells.   
 
Likely  
(happens to 21 -100 
children out of every 100

• Rash  
• Irregular Heart Beat  
 
Herbs and Supplements  
Some drugs or supplements may interact with your treatment plan. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or study 
team before starting any new prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, herbals, or supplements and 
before making a significant change in your diet. Supplements may come in many forms, such as teas, 
drinks, juices, liquids, drops, capsules, pills, or dried herbs. All forms should be avoided.  
  
Possible Risks to Unborn Child  
Patients who agree to participate in this study should not become pregnant while on this study. Patients 
and their sexual partners should avoid sex and / or use two effective methods of contraception that are 
medically appropriate based on your personal doctor’s recommendation at that time and should be used 
for as long as you participate in this study. If you or your partner becomes pregnant while you are 
participating in this study, please notify your doctor immediately.  For more information about ris ks and 
side effects, ask your doctor.  
 
Possible Risks to the Caregiver(s) of the Patient Getting 131I-MIBG Treatment  
Caregivers (example: parent, other family member, guardian, friend, partner) will be exposed to radiation 
while you are being treated with 131I-MIBG.  Caregivers who could possibly become pregnant during this 
time need to avoid contact with the patient because the radiation exposure may increase the unborn 
baby’s risk of developing  cancer or other health problems.   
 
If your caregiver is pregnant, then special precautions should be used to avoid contact with you during 
and for 4 weeks after getting 131I-MIBG treatment.  Should your caregiver or your caregiver’s sexual 
partner be foun d to have been pregnant while you were getting 131I-MIBG treatment and did not know it 
at the time, please contact your doctor immediately.  
 
Possible Long -Term Risk s of This Treatment  
• Recurrence of tumor  
• Infection  
• Sterility and/or delayed onset of puberty  
• Increased risk of a second cancer (such as leukemia) different from the kind of cancer you have now.  
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   129 
 • Patients who have more than one 131I-MIBG treatment will have greater doses of radiation to the 
normal organs than those patients having one treatm ent. It is possible that there may be later damage 
to the normal function of the liver or other organs.  
 
 
Possible Risks from Having Blood Drawn  
The risks from having your blood taken are minimal, but can include an infection or a blood clot. Experienced 
doctors or nurses will perform these blood draws to minimize this risk. You will be asked to sign a separate 
consent for any procedure that needs sedation.  
 
Possible Risks from Germline Genetic Testing    
If you agree to participation in the opt ional test looking at immune system cells in your tumor and immune 
response, a small amount of your blood will be collected. Researchers will use the blood sent with your tumor 
for determining the genetic make -up of your normal cells (known as germline tes ting) that is used as a baseline 
to compare to the genetic make -up of your tumor. This helps the laboratory in identifying the genetic changes 
they may see in your tumor tissue.  
 
The germline genetic testing is for research purposes only and is performed on de -identified samples, and so 
the information can’t be linked back to your child. Hence, the results will not be sent to you or your physician.  
 
Unknown Risks  
This treatment combination may have side effects that no one knows about yet.  The researchers  will let you 
know if they learn anything that might make you change your mind about participating in the study.  
 
 
ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THE STUDY?

 CONSENT FOR OPTIONAL  RESEARCH STUDIES  
 
The following tests are optional for all patients in the study. You may still participate in the study 
even if you do not agree to these tests.  
 
1. Using extra blood to look for proteins and genetic changes in your cells.  
 
Initial next to YES if you agree to let researchers use some of th e blood (less than ¼ teaspoon) already 
drawn for  one of the required studies to look at certain immune cell genes and how changes in these genes 
might affect how you respond to the treatment. No extra blood needs to be drawn from you to do this 
optional test. The results of this test will be confiden tial and not made available to you or your treating 
physician.  
 
Initial next to NO if you do not want researchers to use some of the blood already drawn for a required test 
to look at immune cell genes.    
 
_______Yes      _______No    
 
Initial next to YES if you agree to let researchers take an extra half teaspoon (2.5 mL) of blood 9 different 
times to look for certain proteins and changes in these proteins that might affect your response to treatment 
with vorinostat,  131I-MIBG , and dinu tuximab.   This blood would be drawn at a time when blood was being 
drawn for clinical purposes. The results of this test will be confidential and not made available to you or 
your treating physician.  
 
Initial next to NO if you do not want researchers to t ake extra blood above what is needed for clinical 
purposes.  
 
_______Yes      _______No  
 
2. Evaluate tumor tissue for immune system cells that surround and invade your tumor and 
the genes that cause an immune response, and if possible also comparin e immune system cells in 
tumor samples from before and after treatment with vorinostat, 131I-MIBG and dinutuximab.  
 
Initial next to YES  if you agree  to let researchers collect 3 mL (about ½ teaspoon) of blood to be sent together 
with any leftover tumor (i f available from an earlier procedure) to a laboratory so researchers can learn more 
about the immune system cells that surround and invade your tumor and genes that cause an immune 
response. Looking at the immune response genes involves comparing your nor mal genetic information gotten 
from the blood sample (called germline) to the genetic information of your tumor and determining what is 
different between the two. The results of these tests will be confidential and not made available to you or your 
treatin g doctor.  
 
Initial next to NO if you do not want extra blood drawn and leftover tumor from an earlier procedure, if it is 
available, to be sent to a research laboratory.  
 
_______ Yes      _______No   
 
Initial next to YES if you agree to have leftover tumor sent to the research lab if a biopsy is done in  
the future for clinical care and this happens after finishing this protocol therapy and before starting the next 
treatment for your tumor.  The purpose of this part of the test is to see if the  131I-MIBG had any effect on 
the immune cells that surround and invade your tumor.   
 
Initial next to NO if you do not want leftover tumor from a future procedure to be sent to a research laboratory.  
 
_______Yes      _______No   
 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   133

1.  Dr. ____________ ___ is doing a research study about the treatment of neuroblastoma.  
 
2.  You have a kind of cancer called neuroblastoma. We are doing a study about this k ind of cancer. It 
may be that your cancer went away for a while but has come back. Or it may be that it has never 
gone away. We are asking you to take part in a research study because doctors want to learn more 
about treating neuroblastoma with two medicin es called  MIBG  and dinutuximab  to see what effects 
(both good and bad) this medicine has  on patients and their cancer. The doctors think that giving 
MIBG  with dinutuximab  may kill  more  neuroblastoma cancer cells .  They also want to find out what 
the side effects are when MIBG is given together with dinutuximab.  
 
3. If you agree to be in this study this is what will happen:  
 
You can get up to two courses of this therapy  as long as your tumor doesn’t get worse and you don’t 
have too bad of side effects.  
 
131I-MIBG  
131I-MIBG is a radioactive medicine given into an IV over 2 hours on the first day .   Because of this 
radiation treatment you will need to stay in your hospital room  until you go home.   This is usually about 
5 days. Your parents  cannot sleep in your room but they will be able to stay just outside your room 
and you will be able to see a nd talk to them anytime you want.  They can visit inside your room for a 
short time each day.  
 
Because not all hospitals can give the 131I-MIBG, you might have to go with your parents to another  
hospital to get the MIBG part.   Your doctor will talk with yo u and your parents about the different 
hospitals that can give the MIBG, and which one will be the best for you.  
 
You may need to have a urinary c atheter  placed to help drain your urine while you are getting the 
131I-MIBG treatment. A soft tube will be put inside your urethra (the hole where urine comes out of our 
bodies), and up into your bladder (the place where urine waits inside our bodies until we go to the 
bathroom). Because the 131I-MIBG will be in your urine, a nd can cause damage to your bladder, the 
catheter is necessary to prevent this from happening by keeping your bladder completely empty all 
the time.    
 
 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   137 
  
Stem Cells  
 
131I-MIBG is a medicine that can lower the numbers of your normal blood cells.  Stem cells make all 
the normal blood cells your body needs to be healthy. This includes white blood cells that fight 
infection, platelets that stop you from bleeding, and red blood cells that carry oxygen to your body.  
When 131I-MIBG is given at higher doses it can damage stem c ells so they don’t make enough of the 
normal blood cells we need to live. Your stem cells which were collected during your initial visit will be 
given back to you like a blood transfusion after the 131I-MIBG and other treatment s are finished.  This 
is call ed Stem Cell Infusion or Stem Cell Rescue.  Two weeks after getting 131I-MIBG, we will  give the 
stem cells back through your central line either in the hospital or in the clinic. It is a lot like getting a 
platelet transfusion – the stem cells look like wa tery blood.  
 
Dinutuximab  
 
You will get dinutuximab in your IV once a day for 4 straight days on Days 8 -11 and Days 29 -32. The 
dinutuximab is given over 10 -20 hours.   You will be in the hospital when dinutuximab is given.  
 
Sargramostim/ GM-CSF 
 
The G M-CSF helps the dinutuximab work better and also helps the blood cells grow back faster after 
treatment.  G M-CSF is given through your IV or as an injection (shot) from a v ery small needle into your 
leg that your parents will learn how to give you.  It is given one time a day. You will get GM -CSF during 
the 4 days you are receiving dinutuximab and then for 6 days afterwards (total of 10 days with each 
dinutuximab; Days 8 -17 and 29 -38). You may also get G M-CSF if your blood cells are low after getting 
131I-MIBG , or your doctor may choose to give you a different medicine such as G -CSF or pegfilgrastim . 
If you are given GM -CSF because your blood cells are low it will be  continued  until your blood ce lls have 
started to grow back. We will know when the blood counts are high enough to stop the G M-CSF by doing 
a blood test.  
 
Coming to See the Doctors:  
During and after you have finished the treatment, you will have appointments with the doctors who are 
taking care of you. This is called “ Follow -Up”.  This is to see how well the treatment has worked so far. 
The doctors will want to do some special tests to find this information out. They will include;  
   
• Blood tests ( we will do this twice each week to start with, and then less often)  
• MRI, CT, and MIBG Scans (special pictures of your tumor)  
• Bone marrow test (to look for tumor in your bone marrow)  
• Tests for your heart  and your kidneys  
• Check your urine  
• Feel your belly, look into your eyes and ears, and listen to your heart and lungs.  
• Ask you and your parents a lot of questions about how you are feeling, how you are doing in 
school, and any problems you might be having.  
• You may have to come to the clinic to have bl ood and platelet transfusions when the blood counts 
are low or stay in the hospital if you have a fever with low blood counts.  
• You will come to visit your doctor every week or so to start with, then less often if everything is 
going well.  
 
4. When you are in  a research study, sometimes good things and bad things can happen.  
Sometimes things happen to kids in research studies that may make them feel bad.  These are called 
“risks”.  Some of the risks of this study are:   
• You may feel sick to your stomach and you  may throw up.   
• You may feel tired.  
• You may have a bad appetite.  
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   138 
 • You may have pain or your body may hold onto too much fluid when you are getting the 
dinutuximab.  
• You might have a fever and maybe an infection where you will need to be in the hospital to get 
medicines to treat the infection.   
• You may feel tired and weak and need a blood transfusion or you may get bruises or have 
bleeding (most often a nosebleed) and  need a platelet transfusion.  
• During 131I-MIBG , the urinary catheter may be uncomfortable, and some people feel 
embarrassed having it – but you will only need it for a few days.  It may also be hard to be in a 
room for a long time by yourself until the radiation levels are low enough that it is safe for your 
parents and everyone else to be around you all the time.  
• The treatments may not work, and your tumor may grow, or it might come back again after the 
treatment has finished. If this happens we will tr y other ways to stop the tumor from growing.  
• You could get a different kind of cancer, this doesn’t happen often, but can happen years later.  
• It is possible that you could die from the treatment or cancer.  
• Not all of these things may happen to you. Or thin gs may happen that the doctors don’t know 
about yet.  
 
5. Things that happen to children in research studies that are good are called “benefits”.  Some of the good 
things for this research study could be:  
• This treatment might make your neuroblastoma tumor stay  the same size or get smaller for some 
time.  
• We hope to learn more about this new treatment which could help other children with 
neuroblastoma  
 
6. We will do everything possible to keep your information private and prevent people outside of the study 
from see ing information about you.  
 
7. Please talk this over with your parents before you decide whether or not to be in this study. We will 
also ask your parents to give their permission for you to take part in this study.  But even if your parents 
say “yes” you can still decide not to do this .   
 
8. Being in this study is up to you. You do not have to be in this study if you don’t want to. You may stop 
being in this study at any time but there are two times where you would be at more risk for being sick 
or having side effects or being dangerous t o other people if yo u stopped being in the study.   
1)  If you got 131I-MIBG and left the special room before the doctors said it was ok to leave, then you 
would still be radioactive and this would be dangerous to everyone who was around you since 
you woul d give them radiation from your body.    
 2)  If you decided to stop treatment after getting 131I-MIBG but before you were given your stem cells 
back, the high dose of 131I-MIBG could kill your blood cells so they would not grow back on their 
own without getting back your stem cells.  In this case you would not be able to make your own 
blood cells and could have bad infections or bleeding, and you could die from not having enough 
normal blood cells.  
 
9. You can ask any questions that you have about the study. If you have a question later that you didn’t 
think of now, you can call me or ask me next time you see me.

 10. Special Study Tests:  
You will have blood tests done to measure changes in the number and function of certain cells of your 
immune system, as well as to measure levels of certain proteins that cause inflammation in the body . 
You will also have blood tests done to look for antib odies that attach to the dinutuximab and make it so 
it can’t attack your neuroblastoma. These blood tests will be done 7 times over the first course of 
treatment. A central line can be used to draw these blood samples.  Otherwise you may need to have 
a nee dle poke or a small plastic tube placed in a vein of your hand or arm for these samples.  
 
There are extra tests on this study that are optional meaning that you can say no to doing these tests 
and still be part of the main study.   These extra tests are do ne for research only so the results won’t 
be told to your doctor or to you.  
 
#1:   Check YES if it is ok for us  to take 1/2 teaspoon of extra blood at  different 8 times to learn 
more about how the body  respond s to this treatment. There will be no extra blood draw. We 
will draw this blood at the same time blood is being drawn to take care of you.   
 
  Check NO if it is not ok for us to take this extra blood.  
 
____________  YES,   you can draw the extra blood  
 
____________  NO,    I don’t want to have the extra blood drawn  
 
 
#2:  Check YES if it is ok to use a  little bit of blood (less than half a teaspoon) that was drawn to do 
another test  on this study  to look at the genes in charge of how your immune system responds 
to this treatment.  No extra blood draws are needed to do this test.  
 
____________  YES,   you can do this test.   
____________  NO,    I don’t want this test done.  
 
#3  Check YES if it is OK to let us  look at  some leftover tumor collected from a surgery you had 
before as part of your treatment  to learn more about the immune cells that are inside your tumor  
and outside surrounding it , and the genes that are in charge of your bod y’s immune response.  
In order to do this test, researchers also need to collect a small about of blood (half teaspoon) 
that would be sent to the laboratory at the same time as the tumor sample.  
 
____________  YES,    you can use my tumor samples and draw the extra blood  
 
____________  NO,    I don’t want my tumor samples to be used  or have extra

1. Dr. ____________ ___ is doing a research study about the treatment of neuroblastoma.  
 
2. You have a kind of canc er called neuroblastoma. We are doing a study about this kind of cancer. It 
may be that your cancer went away for a while but has come back. Or it may be that it has never 
gone away. We are asking you to take part in a research study because doctors want t o learn more 
about treating neuroblastoma with t hree medicines called  vorinostat , 131I-MIBG , and dinutuximab  to 
see what effects (both good and bad) this medicine has  on patients and their cancer. The doctors 
think that giving MIBG  with dinutuximab  and vorinostat may kill  more  neuroblastoma cancer cells .  
They also want to find out what the side effects are when MIBG is given together with dinutuximab  
and vorinostat . 
 
3. If you agree to be in this study this is what will happen:  
 
You can get up to two courses of this therapy  as long as your tumor doesn’t get worse and you don’t 
have too bad of side effects.  
 
Vorinostat  
You will take vorinostat by mouth or by a tube inserted through the nose or stomach once a day for 
14 days.  If you vomit within 15 minutes of taking the vorinostat you should retake the dose. If you 
vomit again with the second dose you should not try to take the dose again. If you vomit m ore than 15 
minutes after taking the vorinostat you should not try to retake the dose.        
 
131I-MIBG  
131I-MIBG is a radioactive medicine given into an IV over 2 hours on the first day . Because of this 
radiation treatment you will need to stay in your hospital room  until you go home.   This is usually about 
5 days. Your parents  cannot sleep in your room but they will be able to stay just outside your room and 
you will be able to see and t alk to them anytime you want.  They can visit inside your room for a short 
time each day.  
 
Because not all hospitals can give the 131I-MIBG, you might have to go with your parents to another  
hospital to get the 131I-MIBG part.  Your doctor will talk with yo u and your parents about the different 
hospitals that can give the 131I-MIBG, and which one will be the best for you.  
 
You may need to have a urinary c atheter  placed to help drain your urine while you are getting the 131I-
MIBG treatment. A soft tube will be put inside your urethra (the hole where urine comes out of our 
bodies), and up into your bladder (the place where urine waits inside our bodies until we go to the 
bathroom). Because the 131I-MIBG will be in your urine, and can cause damage to your bladder, the 
catheter is necessary to prevent this from happening by keeping your bladder completely empty all the 
time.    
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   142 
  
Dinutuximab  
You will get dinutuximab in your IV once a day for 4 straight days on Days 8 -11 and Days 29 -32. The 
dinutuximab is given over 10 -20 hours.  You will be in the hospital when dinutuximab is given.  
 
Sargramostim/ GM-CSF 
The G M-CSF helps the dinutuximab work better and also helps the blood cells grow back faster after 
treatment.  G M-CSF is given through your IV or as an injection (shot) from a very small needle into your 
leg that your parents will learn how to give you.  It is given one time a day. You will get GM -CSF during 
the 4 days you are receiving dinutuximab and then for 6 days afterwards (total of 10 days with each 
dinutuximab; Days 8 -17 and 29 -38). You may also get G M-CSF if your blood cells are low after getting 
131I-MIBG , or your doctor may choose to give you a different medicine such as G -CSF or pegfilgrastim . If 
you are given GM -CSF because your blood cells are low it will be continued  until your blood ce lls have 
started to grow back. We will know when the blood counts are high e nough to stop the G M-CSF by doing 
a blood test.  
 
Stem Cells  
131I-MIBG is a medicine that can lower the numbers of your normal blood cells.  Stem cells make all the 
normal blood cells your body needs to be healthy. This includes white blood cells that fight  infection, 
platelets that stop you from bleeding, and red blood cells that carry oxygen to your body.  When 131I-
MIBG is given at higher doses it can damage stem cells so they don’t make enough of the normal blood 
cells we need to live. Your stem cells  which were collected from you from your initial visit  will be given 
back to you like a blood transfusion after the 131I-MIBG and other treatment s are finished.  This is called 
Stem Cell Infusion or Stem Cell Rescue.  Two weeks after getting 131I-MIBG, we will  give the stem cells 
back through your central line either in the hospital or in the clinic. It is a lot like getting a platelet 
transfusion – the stem cells look like watery blood.  
 
 
Coming to See the Doctors:  
During and after you have finished the treatment, you will have appointments with the doctors who are 
taking care of you. This is called “ Follow -Up”.  This is to see how well the treatment ha s worked so far. 
The doctors will want to do some special tests to find this information out. They will include;  
 
• Blood tests (we will do this twice each week to start with, and then less often)  
• MRI, CT, and MIBG Scans (special pictures of your tumor)  
• Bone marrow test (to look for tumor in your bone marrow)  
• Tests for your heart and your kidneys  
• Check your urine  
• Feel your belly, look into your eyes and ears, and listen to your heart and lungs.  
• Ask you and your parents a lot of questions about how you are feeling, how you are doing in 
school, and any problems you might be having.  
• You may have to come to the clinic to have blood and platelet transfusions when the blood counts 
are low or stay in the hospital if you have a fever with low blood coun ts. 
• You will come to visit your doctor every week or so to start with, then less often if everything is 
going well.  
 
4. When you are in a research study, sometimes good things and bad things can happen.  
Sometimes things happen to kids in research studies tha t may make them feel bad.  These are called 
“risks”.  Some of the risks of this study are:   
• You may feel sick to your stomach and you may throw up.   
• You may feel tired.  
• You may have a bad appetite.  
• You may have pain or your body may hold onto too much fluid when you are getting the 
dinutuximab.  
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   143 
 • You might have a fever and maybe an infection where you will need to be in the hospital to get 
medicines to treat the infection.   
• You may feel tired and weak and need a blood transfusion or you may get bruises o r have 
bleeding (most often a nosebleed) and need a platelet transfusion.  
• During 131I-MIBG , the urinary catheter may be uncomfortable, and some people feel 
embarrassed having it – but you will only need it for a few days.  It may also be hard to be in a 
room for a long time by yourself until the radiation levels are low enough that it is safe for your 
parents and everyone else to be around you all the time.  
• The treatments may not work, and your tumor may grow, or it might come back again after the 
treatme nt has finished. If this happens we will try other ways to stop the tumor from growing.  
• You could get a different kind of cancer, this doesn’t happen often, but can happen years later.  
• It is possible that you could die from the treatment or cancer.  
• Not all  of these things may happen to you. Or things may happen that the doctors don’t know 
about yet.  
 
5. Things that happen to children in research studies that are good are called “benefits”.  Some of the good 
things for this research study could be:  
a. This treatme nt might make your neuroblastoma tumor stay the same size or get smaller for some 
time.  
b. We hope to learn more about this new treatment which could help other children with 
neuroblastoma  
 
6. We will do everything possible to keep your information private and prevent people outside of the study 
from seeing information about you.  
 
7. Please talk this over with your parents before you decide whether or not to be in this study. We will also 
ask your  parents to give their permission for you to take part in this study.  But even if your parents say 
“yes” you can still decide not to do this.   
 
8. Being in this study is up to you. You do not have to be in this study if you don’t want to. You may stop 
being  in this study at any time but there are two times where you would be at more risk for being sick 
or having side effects or being dangerous to other people if yo u stopped being in the study.   
1)  If you got 131I-MIBG and left the special room before the doctors said it was ok to leave, then you 
would still be radioactive and this would be dangerous to everyone who was around you since 
you would give them radiation from your body.    
 2)  If you decided to stop treatment after getting 131I-MIBG but before you were given your stem cells 
back, the high dose of 131I-MIBG could kill your blood cells so they would not grow back on their 
own without getting back your stem cells.  In this case y ou would not be able to make your own 
blood cells and could have bad infections or bleeding, and you could die from not having enough 
normal blood cells.  
 
9. You can ask any questions that you have about the study. If you have a question later that you didn’t  
think of now, you can call me or ask me next time you see me.   
• Study doctor’s phone number: __________________  
 
10. Special Study Tests:  
You will have blood tests done to measure changes in the number and function of certain cells of your 
immune system, as well as to measure levels of certain proteins that cause inflammation in the body . 
You will also have blood tests done to look for antibodies that attach to the dinutuximab and make it so 
it can’t attack your neuroblastoma. These blood tests will be done 8 times over the first course of 
treatment. A central line can be used to draw these blood samples.  Otherwise you may need to have 
a needle poke or a small plastic tube placed in a vein of your hand or arm for these samples.  
 
 
NANT 2017 -01 Amendment 5 v02.21.2022   144 
 There are extra tests on this study that are optional meaning that you can say no to doing these tests 
and still be part of the main study.   These extra tests are done for research only so the results won’t 
be told to your doctor or to you.  
 
 
#1:   Check YES if it is ok for us to take 1/2 teaspoon of extra blood at different 8 times to learn 
more about how the body responds to this treatment. We will draw this blood at the same 
time blood is being drawn to take care of you.  
 
  Check NO if it is not ok for us to take this extra blood.  
 
____________  YES,   you can draw the extra blood  
 
____________  NO,    I don’t want to have the extra blood drawn  
 
 
#2:  Check YES if it is ok to use a little bit of blood (less than half a teaspoon) that was drawn to do 
another test on this study to look at the genes in charge of how your immune system responds 
to this treatment.  No extra blood draws are needed to do this test.  
 
____________  YES,   you can do this test . 
____________  NO,    I don’t want this test done.  
 
#3  Check YES if it is OK to let us look at some leftover tumor collected from a surgery you had 
before as part of your treatment to learn more about the immune cells that are inside your tumor 
and outside surrounding it, and the genes that are in charge of your body’s immune response.  
In order to do this test, researchers also need to collect a small about of blood (half teaspoon) 
that would be sent t o the laboratory at the same time as the tumor sample.  
 
____________  YES,    you can use my tumor samples and draw the extra blood  
 
____________  NO,    I don’t want my tumor samples to be used or have extra 
blood drawn for this test.  
 
 
 
#4 Check YES if you agree to let researchers have a tumor sample if you have tumor surgery 
sometime after you finish treatment with MIBG on this study. Researchers want to see if the 
MIBG had any effect on the immune cells that are around and invade your tumo r.   
 
____________  YES,    you can use my tumor samples collected in the future  
 
____________  NO,    I don’t want my tumor samples to be used

 APPENDIX II:  SUMMARY FOR CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
 
Summary of Research Blood Samples:  Blood volumes below are maximum values. For patients with a 
weight below t he minimum required to tolerate all blood draws requested for correlative studies, please 
consult with study chair to determine prioritization of samples. The correlative studies are to be drawn 
only during the first course of therapy with exception of the  N04-05 specimens. Please refer to the N04 -05 
for complete collection requirements.  
 
When immune and cytokine profiling (section 8.2) and NB5 (TLDA assay) (N04 -05) samples coincide, the 
priority is to collect the immune and cytokine profiling first and if maximum blood volume allowable for 
research purposes has not been surpassed then the NB5 (TLDA)   sample may be collected  (refer to 
protocol section 8.3) .  Patients can submit only bone marrow for NB5 (TLDA) if blood volumes for research 
do not allow for blood submission.    
 
This table is a summary overview of correlative studies.  Refer to specific protocol section for all details 
regarding specimen collection timing, processing, labeling and shipping.

 APPENDIX III: ADJUSTED BODY WEIGHT CALCULATION FOR STEM CELL DOSING  
 
For patients whose actual body weight exceeds ideal body weight ( IBW) by more than 20%, the dose of 
stem cells may be based on adjusted b ody weight ( ABW ) rather than actual body weight.  
 
IBW F ormulas:  
1-17 years: height is in cm, weight is in kg  
IBW = (height2 x 1.65)/1000  
 
1-17 years and 5 feet or taller:  
IBW in kg (male) = 39 + (2.27 x height in inches over 5 feet)  
IBW in kg (female) = 45.5 + (2.27 x height in inches over 5 feet)  
 
18 years and older:  
IBW in kg (male) = 50 + (2.3 x height in inches over 5 feet)  
IBW in kg (female) = 45.5 + (2.3 x height in inches over 5 feet)  
 
ABW  is determined:  
ABW =IBW + 0.4 x (actual BW-IBW)

 APPENDIX V: QUALITY CONTROL FOR FREE IODINE IN 131I-MIBG (DETECTION OF RADIOLYTIC  
DECOMPOSITION)  
 
NOTE:  As of 10/20/21 , radiochemical purity testing at clinical sites following receipt of  131I-MIBG 
from Jubilant Radiopharma  is no longer required. Sites are still to check for discoloration and 
particulate matters prior to product administration to the patient. Additionally , if a “Temperature 
Alarm” is detected on the temperature monitor provided in the 131I-MIBG shipment, sites are NOT to 
use the product and should store the vial in the lead pot and call JRP Customer Service immediately 
for further instructions.  
 
Should clin ical sites still wish to perform radiochemical purity testing, the below is a sugge sted 
technique:

➢ PBS with 2% FBS (room temperature)  
➢ Freeze Media 1 and Freeze Media 2 (room temperature)   
 
Note  
• After collection, store tube upright at room temper ature until centrifugation.  
• Blood samples should be centrifuged within 2 hours of blood collection.  
 
Procedure  
1. Gently invert tubes 5 times before placing in the centrifuge.  
2. Counter balance extra collection tubes for centrifugation.  
3. Centrifuge samples in a horizontal (swing bucket) rotor for 15 minutes  at 1,600 rcf  at room 
temperature . 
4. Remove blood collection tubes from centrifuge and ensure that tubes are kept in the upright position.   
5. Using a sterile serological pipette, draw off (transfer) the upper layer (plasma) into a new 15mL 
conical tube labeled “plasma”.  Leave the mononuclear layer undisturbed (see image above).  
6. Using a sterile pipette, transfer everything remaining above the polyester gel layer (plasma, 
mononuclear cells, platelets, and density solution) into a new 15 mL conical tube labeled “PBMCs.”  
7. Discard blood collection t ubes in the appropriate biohazard waste container.

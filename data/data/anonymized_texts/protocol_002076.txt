Protocol Synopsis
Title Sirolimus treatment in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia
(The SCOPE Trial)
Rationale In late 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of 
pneumonia cases in the city of Wuhan, China. This virus has now been designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease has been named COVID-19. To date, COVID-19 has affected >1,000,000 individuals across 204 countries and led to ~50,000 deaths. United States currently has the world’s highest number of affected individuals with COVID-19 in the world, with >200,000 cases and >5,000 fatalities. The disease spectrum from COVID-19 varies within individuals and can broadly be categorized into three subsets: 1) mild upper respiratory tract illness in ~80%, 2) severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization in ~15%, and 3) critical illness with multiorgan dysfunction in ~5% of the patients. The overall fatality rate from COVID-19 is estimated at ~2%. A number of different investigational agents have been prescribed to patients with COVID-19; these agents can broadly be classified into two subgroups: 1) drugs aimed at inhibiting the viral growth such as the antiviral agents remdesivir and lopinavir-ritonavir, and hydroxychloroquine (either alone or in combination with azithromycin) and 2) drugs such as the IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab, that are aimed at dampening the cytokine storm that is prevalent in critically ill patients with COVID-19. However, there is no proven effective pharmacological therapy against COVID-19 and supportive care remains the cornerstone of management. Development of novel treatment options for COVID-19 is a critical public health need. 
A variety of laboratory parameters have emerged as prognostic biomarkers in 
patients with COVID-19 that can portend an increased propensity to progress towards acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. Key prognostic biomarkers reported thus far include elevated serum levels of ferritin, d-dimer, LDH, and lymphopenia. Lymphopenia has been observed in 60-80% of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Absolute lymphocyte count is inversely proportional to disease severity in patients with COVID-19 and patients with worse lymphopenia have increased risk of progression to ARDS and death. Lymphopenia was also seen in 50-80% of cases and predicted poor prognosis in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a similar illness to COVID-19 that also assumed epidemic proportions and was caused by a related coronavirus, SARS-CoV. Analysis of blood and autopsy specimens from SARS patients revealed the presence of viral particles within circulating and tissue resident lymphocytes, thus implicating direct viral damage as the mechanism for the observed lymphopenia. T-lymphocytes have been demonstrated to play a crucial role in viral clearance in SARS, and play a key role in inhibiting the hyper-activation of innate immunity. A recent single cell transcriptome analysis performed on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens obtained from six hospitalized individuals with COVID-19 revealed that patients with mild disease 
2had a more robust CD8 T cell adaptive immune response compared to patients 
with severe disease. 
Sirolimus (rapamycin) is a macrolide produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus  
that complexes with FKBP-12 and binds to and inhibits the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Sirolimus is primarily used as an immunosuppressive agent to prevent rejection in organ transplant recipients. However, in contrast to its role as an immunosuppressive agent in the renal transplant population, sirolimus has been demonstrated to exert an immunostimulatory effect on CD8 T lymphocytes in response to viral infections. In addition, sirolimus has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on the replication of a variety of different viral pathogens, including a related coronavirus, MERS-CoV. In a single center trial, the addition of sirolimus to standard of care treatment resulted in faster viral clearance and improved oxygenation in critically ill patients with H1N1 influenza. Inhibiting the mTOR pathway has been shown to reduce mortality in a murine influenza model, upregulate antiviral gene expression, and boost the response to influenza vaccination in elderly patients. Lastly, a recently conducted pharmacology network analysis has suggested mTOR inhibition as a potentially useful strategy in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Study 
OverviewThe main objective of our study is to determine if treatment with sirolimus can 
improve clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We will employ a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study design. 30 subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to receive sirolimus or placebo. Sirolimus will be given as a 6mg oral loading dose on day 1 followed by 2mg daily for a maximum treatment duration of 14 days or until hospital discharge, whichever happens sooner. Chart reviews will be conducted daily to determine changes in clinical status, concomitant medications and laboratory parameters. Study specific biomarkers will be measured at baseline and then at days 3, 7 and 14. 
Sample Size In a study evaluating 201 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in China, 82% (165 
patients) required supplemental oxygen. Among the patients needing supplemental oxygen, 40% (67 patients) progressed to require advanced respiratory support during their hospital stay. Considering the fact that our study inclusion criteria mandates the need for supplemental oxygen and the presence of at least one additional poor prognostic biomarker, we anticipate that 50% of our control group will progress to require advanced respiratory support during their hospitalization. We expect that treatment with sirolimus will reduce the need for advanced respiratory support to 25%. 
The goal of this pilot study is to determine a meaningful treatment difference in 
order to conduct a larger confirmatory trial. Given the limited data on treatment responsiveness in COVID-19 populations, we examined various enrollment sizes commensurate with planning a pilot study. Specifically, we undertook a recommended approach for pilot studies in clinical research, which is to not perform hypothesis testing with a significance level set at the traditional value of 0.05. The confidence intervals for the treatment difference were calculated based on demonstrating a reduction in the proportion of subjects needing advanced respiratory support from 0.50 in the placebo group to 0.25 in the sirolimus group. Various levels have been proposed as optimal thresholds for the tolerance of type I error in the context of pilot studies, with the highest being p=0.25. We chose the type I error rate of 0.2 to denote significant treatment effect between the treatment and placebo arms in our study, as proposed by Stallard. A sample size of 30 patients randomized in a 2:1 fashion in favor of sirolimus will allow us to estimate the treatment differences with 80% confidence based on a binomial two-proportion test. A two-sided test will be used since we are unsure if the treatment will have a beneficial effect in this patient population. 
Data Analysis The primary endpoint of this study is progression to respiratory failure requiring 
advanced support measures. The difference in proportions of progression between the placebo and sirolimus groups and the 80% confidence interval will be calculated. If the confidence interval for the difference in proportions does not include zero, then we will conclude that the treatment difference is clinically meaningful. Considering the small sample size of our study, the significant impact of age and other pre-existing conditions such as diabetes mellitus on overall prognosis in patients with COVID-19 cannot be accounted for in the primary analysis. Patients will be randomized according to a computer-generated 
5permuted block randomization stratified on age: <50 years, 50 - 64 years, and ≥65 
years. In case recruitment lags we will add external study sites. In such a scenario, University of Cincinnati and the facilities of the affiliated health systems UC Health, LLC and University of Cincinnati Physicians Company, LLC will follow the same randomization scheme. In case of other external sites, randomization will be stratified based on site in addition to the above-mentioned age-based stratification. As exploratory analysis, we will conduct analyses examining differences based on other prognostic factors, and concomitant medication use, such as corticosteroids, hydroxychlororquine, azithromycin etc. An intent-to-treat analysis will be performed for the primary outcome.

123. Background and Rationale
3.1 Background:
In late 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in the city of Wuhan, China. This virus has now been designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease has been named COVID-19. To date, COVID-19 has affected >1,000,000 individuals across 204 countries and led to ~50,000 deaths. United States currently has the world’s highest number of affected individuals with COVID-19 in the world, with >200,000 cases and >5,000 fatalities.
1 The disease spectrum from COVID-19 is 
variable and can broadly be categorized into three subsets: 1) mild illness in ~80%, 2) severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization in ~15%, and 3) critical illness with multiorgan dysfunction in ~5% of the patients. The overall fatality rate from COVID-19 is estimated at ~2%.
2 A number 
of different investigational agents have been prescribed to patients with COVID-19; these agents can broadly be classified into two subgroups: 1) drugs aimed at inhibiting the viral growth such as the antiviral agents remdesivir
3 and lopinavir-ritonavir4, and hydroxychloroquine (either 
alone or in combination with azithromycin)5 and 2) drugs such as the IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab,6 
that are aimed at dampening the cytokine storm that is prevalent in critically ill patients with COVID-19. However, there is no proven effective pharmacological therapy against COVID-19 and development of novel treatment options for COVID-19 is a critical public health need. 
3.2 Lymphopenia and other poor prognostic biomarkers in COVID-19
A variety of laboratory parameters have emerged as prognostic biomarkers in patients with COVID-19 that can portend an increased propensity to progress towards acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. Key prognostic biomarkers reported thus far include elevated serum levels of ferritin, d-dimer, LDH, and lymphopenia.
7,8 Lymphopenia has been 
observed in 60-80% of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients.8-11 Absolute lymphocyte count is 
inversely proportional to disease severity in patients with COVID-19 and patients with worse lymphopenia have increased risk of progression to ARDS and death.

3.3 T lymphocytes play a critical role in viral clearance in patients with SARS as well as COVID-19 Lymphopenia was also seen in 50-80% of cases and predicted poor prognosis in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),
12,13 a similar illness to COVID-19 that also assumed 
epidemic proportions and was caused by a related coronavirus, SARS-CoV. Analysis of blood and autopsy specimens from SARS patients revealed the presence of viral particles within circulating and tissue resident lymphocytes, thus implicating direct viral damage as the mechanism for the observed lymphopenia.
14 T-lymphocytes have been demonstrated to play a

innate immunity.16 A recent single cell transcriptome analysis performed on bronchoalveolar 
lavage fluid specimens obtained from six hospitalized individuals with COVID-19 revealed that 
13patients with mild disease had a more robust CD8 T cell adaptive immune response compared 
to patients with severe disease.17 
3.4 Sirolimus is effective against a variety of viral pathogens including influenza as well 
as related coronaviruses Sirolimus is a macrolide produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus  that complexes with FKBP-
12 and inhibits the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Sirolimus is primarily used as an immunosuppressive agent to prevent rejection in organ transplant recipients.

However, in contrast to its role as an immunosuppressive agent in the renal transplant population, sirolimus has been demonstrated to exert an immunostimulatory effect on CD8 T lymphocytes in response to viral infections.
19 In addition, sirolimus has been shown to have an 
inhibitory effect on replication of a variety of viral pathogens, including a related coronavirus, MERS-CoV.
20-23 In a single center trial, the addition of sirolimus to standard of care resulted in

Inhibiting the mTOR pathway has been shown to reduce mortality in a murine influenza model,25 
upregulate antiviral gene expression, and boost the response to influenza vaccination in elderly patients.
26 Lastly, a recently conducted network analysis has suggested mTOR inhibition as a 
potentially useful strategy in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.27
3.5 Rationale for the proposed studyImproved understanding of the role of host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of novel treatment options for COVID-19 are critical unmet public health needs. By harnessing the similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and utilizing the insights gained from SARS, we believe that the key to successful recovery from COVID-19 lies in targeted stimulation of the host adaptive immune response. The mTOR inhibitor, sirolimus, has been shown to exert an immunostimulatory effect on CD8 lymphocytes in response to a variety of different viral pathogens, including a related novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV. We postulate that impaired T cell responsiveness is a key driver in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and that treatment with sirolimus can enhance the virus-specific T cell response leading to effective viral clearance and improved clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Sirolimus also inhibits viral replication by limiting cellular proliferation and progression through the cell cycle. Successful completion of our aims will lead to improved understanding of the role of adaptive immune response in mitigating COVID-19 pathology, and pave the way for the development of a novel treatment option for patients with COVID-19. 
144. Study Objectives and Endpoints
4.1 Main Study Objective
The main objective of our study is to determine if treatment with sirolimus can improve clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
4.2 Primary Endpoint:
Progression to respiratory failure requiring advanced support measures, either due to 
inadequate ventilation (non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation) or inadequate oxygenation (CPAP* or high flow supplemental oxygen at rates ≥ 15 liters/minute), in patients 
given sirolimus compared to the placebo group. 
4.3 Secondary Endpoints:
Key secondary endpoints:
•Escalation in level of care
•Increase in total lymphocyte count
•Normalization of biomarkers (Ferritin, LDH, and d-dimer) 
•Survival to hospital discharge
•Drug safety profile (Incidence and type of adverse and serious adverse events) 
Other outcomes measures: 
•Fever
•Duration of advanced respiratory support 
•Duration of hospital stay (in survivors)
•Time from treatment initiation to death (in non-survivors)
•Need for initiation of other off-label rescue therapies such as Anti IL-6 agents, at the 
discretion of treating clinicians
* CPAP use for known obstructive sleep apnea will not be considered as disease progression.
155. Study Design
We will employ a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study design. 30 patients 
hospitalized with COVID-19 and meeting the inclusion criteria specified below will be randomized to receive sirolimus or placebo in a 2:1 manner. The treatment regimen and duration are provided in Sections 5.5 and 5.6. 
5.1 Identification and Screening
Patients will be identified by the medical staff that cares for patients with COVID-19 at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center and the facilities of the affiliated health systems UC Health, LLC and University of Cincinnati Physicians Company, LLC. In addition, the study staff will actively screen for potential subjects by chart reviews of the patients admitted on the COVID units and based on automated alerts generated on patients under investigation for COVID-19. Identification and screening will take place until 30 evaluable patients have been enrolled, or the incidence of new cases does not permit further enrollment. Potentially eligible patients will be  
approached by the study investigators, and then by study staff. In order to limit staff exposure to patients with COVID-19 as well as to protect critical personal protective equipment (PPE), study investigators will communicate with potential subjects remotely via telephone rather than in-person visits, as much as possible. Potential patients will be informed about the study, and following completion of the informed consent process, a screening evaluation will be performed. The patient will provide informed consent before  any study procedures are performed.  Patients 
who learn of the study from the study listing on ClinicalTrials.gov or from any other source will 
also be able to be screened for enrollment. 
5.2 Inclusion Criteria

precludes the patient from enrolling in the trial, including (but not limited to):
oHistory of liver cirrhosis 
oEnd stage renal disease or need for renal replacement therapy 
oDecompensated heart failure 
oKnown active tuberculosis or history of incompletely treated tuberculosis
oUncontrolled systemic bacterial or fungal infections
oActive viral infection other than COVID-19
oLymphoma or other systemic malignancies, either current or treated within the 
past 2 years. Localized non-melanoma skin cancer is not an exclusion. 
5.4 Recruitment
After IRB and DSMB approval has been obtained, the screening and identification for subjects will be performed as described in Section 5.1. Interested individuals will be provided with detailed study information and the informed consent form (ICF). After they have had a chance to review the study procedures and the ICF, and after ensuring that all questions are answered, patients can be enrolled into the study. Details of the informed consent process are provided in Section 6.3. 
5.5 Study Drug Treatment
Patients who meet eligibility criteria, provide informed consent and are enrolled in the study will be randomized to receive sirolimus or placebo in a double-blind manner and a 2:1 randomization scheme in favor of sirolimus. The sirolimus dose for the study will be 6mg daily on day 1 followed by 2mg daily for a maximum treatment duration of 14 days, or until hospital discharge, whatever happens first. The study drug will be provided by the drug manufacturer, Pfizer, encapsulated and dispensed by the University of Cincinnati’s Investigational Drug Services (IDS) Pharmacy, and given to the patients by their bedside nurse. Patients will be reminded about the side effects of sirolimus. Every attempt will be made to give the medication at the same time every day. Chart reviews will be conducted on a daily basis to determine changes in clinical status, concomitant medications and laboratory parameters. Study specific biomarkers will be measured at baseline and then at days 3, 7 and 14. Section 6.2 provides a detailed description of the study specific schedule of events. Patients will be instructed to 
17contact the study staff should they experience any side effects. Study drug may be held or 
reduced in the event of unacceptable side effects. 
5.6 Treatment Regimen
Patients will be randomized to either a 6mg oral loading dose of sirolimus followed by 2mg daily for a maximum treatment duration of 14 days, or matching placebo. We have chosen this dosing strategy to mirror the typical regimen in patients who start sirolimus following a kidney transplant, in order to ensure rapid therapeutic mTOR inhibition in these patients. The 2mg daily dose is also consistent with the Chinese randomized clinical trial that showed a clinically useful beneficial effect of sirolimus in critically patients with H1N1 influenza.

186. Study Procedures and Timelines
6.1 Study and Timeline Overview
Patients will be identified by the medical and research staff at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center and the facilities of the affiliated health systems UC Health, LLC and University of Cincinnati Physicians Company, LLC. Recruitment will take place until 30 evaluable patients have been enrolled, or the incidence of new cases does not permit further enrollment. Patients who meet eligibility criteria, provide informed consent and are enrolled in the study will receive instructions regarding study drug dosage, route and administration. The study drug will be given each morning along with other inpatient medications at roughly the same time every day. Patients will be on the study drug for a maximum duration of 14 days, or until hospital discharge, whatever happens first. In case a patient progresses to require advanced respiratory support, the study drug can continue as scheduled at the discretion of the treating clinician(s). If deemed clinically necessary on a case-by-case basis, in these scenarios the patient may need to be withdrawn ± unblinded. 
All study procedures will take place after obtaining informed consent. Details of the informed 
consent process are provided in Section 6.3. Prior to starting study drug, baseline demographic and clinical variables will be collected along with vital signs, amount of supplemental oxygen required, laboratory biomarkers such as absolute lymphocyte count, ferritin, LDH, and d-dimer, renal and liver function tests, concomitant medications, past medical history, and results of the chest imaging. After study initiation, chart reviews will be conducted on a daily basis to assess vital signs, changes to concomitant medications, lab values, and oxygenation indices. Study-specific biomarkers: absolute lymphocyte count, serum ferritin, d-dimer and LDH will be measured at Day 3, 7 and 14 following study initiation, unless already checked clinically in the 24 hours prior to the testing time.

206.3 Study Visits
Screening/Initial Visit
All study procedures will begin only after the subject has completed the informed consent process. 
Informed consent process for this study: Potential study patients will be contacted by the study 
staff to determine interest in study participation. Interested individuals will be provided with 
detailed study information and a copy of the ICF. Patients will be given ample time to read and discuss the ICF with the study staff. The study staff will then answer any remaining questions asked by the patients. The patients will be offered the option of signing the consent form. Those who agree to participate will undergo the remainder of study procedures. In order to prevent transmission of COVID-19 from ICFs that have been in physical contact with the patients (e.g. during the act of obtaining signatures), we will obtain consent by following either the quarantine consent process or the telephone consent process, as detailed below. 
Quarantine Consent 
•The subject (or their legally authorized representative (LAR)) will be provided with a copy 
of the ICF to keep at the bedside during the quarantine period. 
•The informed consent discussion will be presented to the subject (or their LAR) by an authorized study representative (investigator/coordinator) who is sufficiently knowledgeable about the research to properly interpret and correctly answer questions. 
•A witness who is not a member of the study team will be present for the informed consent discussion. 
•We will identify all participants and their role in the study (e.g. study staff, patient, next of kin, LAR, impartial witness etc.).
•We will review the ICF in a comprehensive manner with the patient (or their LAR), solicit and answer all questions. 
•The subject (or their LAR), study team member obtaining informed consent, and the witness will sign the subject’s (or their LAR’s) copy of the ICF. The subject will keep the original ICF for their records. 
•Immediately after the informed consent discussion, the investigator and witness will document their signatures on a separate ICF outside of isolation/quarantined areas. We will document “Quarantine consent obtained” in the subject’s (or their LAR’s) signature line. 
Telephone Consent The following stepwise process will be followed in order to obtain telephone consent from 
interested subjects prior to study enrollment. 
•A copy of the ICF will be provided to the subject (or their LAR) to review over the phone. 
21•The informed consent discussion will be presented to the subject (or their LAR) by an 
authorized study representative (investigator/coordinator) who is sufficiently knowledgeable about the research to properly interpret and correctly answer questions. 
•A witness who is not a member of the study team will be present for the informed 
consent discussion with the investigator/study coordinator. 
•We will begin the call by identifying all participants on the call and their role in the study 
(e.g. study staff, patient, next of kin, LAR, impartial witness etc.)
•Next, we will review the ICF in a comprehensive manner with the patient (or their LAR), 
solicit and answer all questions. 
•We will obtain verbal confirmation from the witness that the subject’s questions have 
been answered. 
•Obtain verbal confirmation from the subject (or their LAR) regarding their agreement to 
participate in the study, and that they have signed the ICF in their possession while the witness is still on the telephone.
•Obtain verbal confirmation from the study staff member that the subject has agreed to 
participate in the study and sign the ICF while the witness is still on the telephone. 
•The investigator and witness will sign the ICF and document “telephone consent 
obtained” in the subject’s (or their LAR’s) signature line. 
Script for telephone consent
1. Hello, my name is ___________________. I am calling from the University of Cincinnati 
regarding a research study for COVID-19. We are conducting a study to assess if an already approved medication called sirolimus can help patients hospitalized with COVID-19. I’d like to ask your permission to tell you about the study. 
If the patient and/or LAR is agreeable, proceed with the following : I would like to provide you 
with a copy of the informed consent form for you to keep and arrange a time that I can call you back to answer any questions you may have. It is important that you have time to read the consent form and have it with you when we talk about the study. 
2. Hello, this is ___________________ calling back about the COVID-19 study at the 
University of Cincinnati. Is this a good time? Also present on this phone call is _____________, who will act as a witness to our conversation and be present throughout the phone call. Do we have your permission to proceed? 
If the patient agrees, we will confirm that the patient has access to a copy of the ICF with them 
and proceed with the steps outlined above. Prior to obtaining signatures, we will explicitly solicit any questions from the subject and ensure that all questions have been answered to their satisfaction. 
After obtaining informed consent, we will review the inclusion/exclusion criteria to 
determine study eligibility. For patients who provide informed consent and meet all eligibility criteria, the screening visit can be their initial study visit. We anticipate that in most patients the 
22screening visit will be the initial study visit, and the following additional steps will be completed 
during the visit:
•Review medical history 
•Record current medications 
•Record vital signs: heart rate, blood pressure, temperature as specified in Section 6.2
•Record baseline oxygenation indices: oxygen saturation and FiO 2 as specified in Section 
6.2
•For women of childbearing potential, obtain a urine pregnancy test, if not already obtained 
during the hospitalization
•If not already obtained clinically in the previous 24 hours, then obtain measurements for 
study specific biomarkers: LDH, ferritin, d-dimer, and absolute lymphocyte count
•If not already obtained clinically in the previous 24 hours, then obtain other laboratory 
parameters: CBC (total WBCs, Hb, Platelets), serum creatinine, AST, and ALT
Subsequent visits 
Subjects’ medical chart will be reviewed on a daily basis after study enrollment. The following parameters will be obtained on a daily basis from chart review:
•Vital signs: heart rate, blood pressure, temperature as specified in Section 6.2
•Oxygenation indices: oxygen saturation and FiO
2 as specified in Section 6.2
•Concomitant medications
•Advanced respiratory support use status
•Vital status
In addition, the following activities will be performed on days 3, 7 and 14 of the study
•If not already obtained clinically in the previous 24 hours, then obtain measurements for 
study specific biomarkers: LDH, ferritin, d-dimer, and absolute lymphocyte count. If COVID-19 biorepository sample obtained on the day of these tests, they can be postponed to the next day.
•If not already obtained clinically in the previous 24 hours, then obtain other laboratory 
parameters: CBC (total WBCs, Hb, Platelets), serum creatinine, AST, and ALT
•Query the patient with regards to any adverse effects from the study medication. This can 
be done remotely via telephone interview rather than in-person visit in order to minimize study staff exposure as well as preserve PPE
In case a subject is discharged from the hospital before Day 14, every effort will be made to 
complete the day 14 activities on the day of hospital discharge. In case the duration of hospitalization extends beyond the study duration of 14 days, we will periodically monitor the electronic medical record and record key variables such as the need for advanced respiratory support, duration of hospitalization, duration of ICU status, time spent on mechanical ventilation, and vital status. 
236.4 Enrollment
Enrollment in the study will continue until the enrollment target of 30 patients is reached. This research study will be explained in lay terms to each potential research participant. The potential participant will sign an ICF before undergoing any screening study procedures.  Participants who are deemed eligible for the study (see Section 6.3) will be enrolled and assigned a unique participant ID number.
6.5 Consent for future contact
During the consent process, patients will have the option to provide permission for future contact. This permission allows for patient contact information, including their full name, address and telephone number, to be retained. The permission for future contact allows for possible patient re-contact regarding future IRB-approved studies. If the patient denies permission, no future contact will be made. 
6.6 Consent for continuing data review of medical records
During the consent process, patients will have the option to provide permission for future data review of their medical records. This permission allows for study staff to contact the patient (or the patient’s caregiver(s)) to obtain medical records and other information for a period of up to two years after the patient has withdrawn from or completed the study. The purpose of this data review is to capture information including but not limited to clinical, radiographic, pathologic, laboratory and pulmonary function data, after the patient has exited the study. The rationale for future data review is that there may be long term effects of COVID-19 or the study drug, that are unknown to the investigators at this time.  
247. Stopping rules
7.1 Participant withdrawal criteria
Participants may be terminated early from the study for the following reasons:
a. The participant elects to withdraw consent from study activities.b. The participant dies.c. The participant has a serious allergic or anaphylactic reaction to the study drugc. The participant’s condition deteriorates significantly necessitating either a transfer to the 
intensive care unit (ICU) or the need for advanced respiratory support (high flow oxygen ≥ 15 
L/minute, CPAP, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation), and the treating clinician thinks it is in the best interest of the patient to be withdrawn ± unblinded. If the patient is unblinded, any open label use of sirolimus after that will be based on clinical grounds at the discretion of the treating clinician(s). The study drug (sirolimus or placebo) will continue for the maximum stipulated duration of 14 days regardless of escalation in care, unless the patient is withdrawn from the study. 
d. The participant develops a medical condition or is started on new medication(s) not previously 
mentioned in the list of prohibited medications that, in the opinion of the investigator, may pose additional risks from participation in the study, or that may impact the quality of the data obtained from the study.
e. In the opinion of the investigator, it is not in the participant’s best medical interest to continue 
to participate in the study.  
7.2 Criteria for terminating the study
Up to 30 patients will be enrolled in this study. The maximum duration of patient participation is 14 days. In the event of any death or Grade IV Serious adverse event (SAE) that is unexpected and attributable to the study agent, enrollment will be suspended, pending Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) review. 
258. Study variables and measuring methods
8.1 Vital signs
We will abstract the following vital signs from electronic health record review of study subjects daily throughout the study duration: heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature. 
Heart rate : The average (mean) heart rate in the 24-hour time frame corresponding to a 
calendar date will be recorded as that day’s heart rate. 
Blood pressure : The average (mean) Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) in the 24-hour time 
frame corresponding to a calendar date will be recorded as that day’s blood pressure. We anticipate MAP to be available in all subjects’ medical charts. However, in case MAP is not recorded then we will calculate it based on this formula:
MAP = [2 x (diastolic blood pressure) + 1 x (systolic blood pressure)]/3Temperature : The highest temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) in the 24-hour time frame 
corresponding to a calendar date will be recorded as that day’s temperature. 
8.2 Oxygenation indices
We will abstract the following oxygenation indices from electronic health record review of study subjects daily throughout the study duration: peripheral blood oxygen saturation and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO
2). 
Oxygen saturation : The average (mean) oxygen saturation in the 24-hour time frame 
corresponding to a calendar date will be recorded as that day’s oxygen saturation. 
FiO 2: FiO 2 (%) will be recorded if directly available from chart review such as in patients on 
ultra-high flow devices (e.g. vapotherm, optiflow etc.) or in patients on advanced respiratory support. For all other patients, FiO
2 (%) will be calculated based on the following conversion 
table provided below and also in Section 6.2. The average (mean) FiO 2 in the 24-hour time 
frame corresponding to a calendar date will be recorded as that day’s FiO 2. 
Supplemental O 2 (l/min) 01234567891 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4
FiO 2 (%) 21 24 27 30 33 36 39 42 45 48 51 54 57 60 63
Table : FiO 2 conversion based on supplemental oxygen needs
8.3 Laboratory parameters
The following laboratory parameters will be obtained for our study: CBC (total WBCs, Hb, Platelets), absolute lymphocyte count, AST, ALT, serum creatinine, LDH, ferritin and d-dimer. These labs will be obtained at baseline (within 24 hours of study drug initiation) and at days 3, 7 and 14. In case these labs were drawn in the 24 hours prior to the study stipulated time on 
26clinical grounds, then we will use those values for the study. If not drawn clinically in the 
preceding 24 hours, then we will obtain these values as research tests. If COVID-19 biorepository sample obtained on the day of these tests, they can be postponed to the next day. In case a subject is discharged from the hospital prior to the 14-day period or is withdrawn from the study, we will make all efforts to father the Day 14 assessments on that day. 
8.4 Urine pregnancy test
For women of childbearing potential, we will obtain a urine pregnancy test, if not already obtained during the hospitalization prior to study enrollment. 
8.5 Other study parameters 
Daily chart reviews will be performed to record other variables of interest:
Need for advanced respiratory support : Recorded as Yes/No and type, whether high flow 
oxygen ≥ 15 liters/minute, CPAP, non-invasive, or invasive mechanical ventilation. If a patient 
receives more than one form of advanced respiratory support in the same day, (e.g. started on non-invasive and worsens to require invasive ventilation, or extubated from invasive to non-invasive ventilation), we will designate the most advanced form of ventilation (in the above scenarios – mechanical ventilation) for that day. The ranking order for the above modes of respiratory support are (from most advanced to least advanced means): 1. Mechanical ventilation, 2. Non-invasive ventilation (e.g. bilevel), 3. CPAP, 4. High flow supplemental oxygen ≥ 15 L/minute. Of note, the use of CPAP employed to treat pre-existing obstructive sleep apnea 
will not count as advanced respiratory support. 
Duration of advanced respiratory support : For patients who progress to require advanced 
respiratory support, the type(s) of support and the time spent on the support (individual modes as well as cumulative, days) will be recorded. 
Vital status : The vital status (alive/deceased) will be recorded at study termination as well as at 
the time of hospital discharge (in case that happens after the 14-day study period). For non-survivors, the time from study initiation to death will also be recorded. 
Duration of hospital stay (days):  will be recorded starting from the day of admission to the day 
of hospital discharge. This parameter will only be used for analysis in patients who survive the hospital stay. 
279. Risks
9.1 Risks of the investigational product
In general, sirolimus is a well-tolerated drug. The most common side effects attributable to sirolimus in clinical trials include stomatitis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, peripheral edema, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, acneiform rash, headaches and myalgias.
28,29 Other 
less common but reported AEs from sirolimus include allergic reactions to the drug including angioedema, proteinuria, increased serum creatinine, impaired would healing, interstitial pneumonitis, and increased risk of secondary infections and malignancies such as skin cancer and lymphomas.
28 Key AEs attributable to sirolimus are summarized in the table below. It is 
worth mentioning that a large proportion of these AEs are derived from studies in renal transplant patients where patients are taking multiple immunosuppressive medications at the same time, and it is not clear if these AEs can be attributable to the use of sirolimus as a single agent.

Table:  Key adverse reactions associated with the use of sirolimus. This is not an exhaustive list. 
Percentages for the incidence of a particular adverse event are derived from the FDA label and from a review of multiple clinical trials evaluating adverse effects from sirolimus.
18,28-32 
The vast majority of the common side effects (e.g. hyperlipidemia, increased risk of 
malignancies) are of concern with prolonged/long-term use of sirolimus. Since our study duration is limited to 14 days, these measurements may not be of significant concern. Side effects of particular interest given the nature of this study will be incidence of secondary infections and other organ system toxicities (pneumonitis, increased serum creatinine, decreased blood counts). We will carefully monitor for all laboratory abnormalities at baseline and on days 3, 7, and 14. We will also enquire about any possible AEs from the patients at days 1, 3, 7, and 14.
9.2 Risks of study procedures
Blood draws:  The risks of blood draws include bleeding, bruising, discomfort, fainting and 
lightheadedness infection or pain at the needle site. All research personnel and hospital staff drawing blood are trained in the procedure and are familiar with proper infection control protocol. We anticipate that most of the assessments needed as part of the study will already be obtained on clinical grounds and that the need for additional blood draws specific for this research study will be minimal. 
9.3 Adequacy of protection against risks
Each participant in this study will be informed of the intent of the study and asked to sign an IRB approved informed consent form. The consent form will fully describe the procedures, risks, alternatives, and potential benefits of the study. Consent will be obtained from eligible participants by a physician investigator or by the study research coordinator. The participants will be given the opportunity to refuse to participate in the study, under the assurance that such refusal will in no way affect their regular treatment. All questions asked by study subject will be answered to the best of the knowledge of the investigator and the study staff. Time will be given for the patient to read the consent form and ask questions prior to performing any study procedures. A copy of the signed and dated consent form will be given to subject. Details of the informed consent process for this study are provided in Section 6.3. There are no alternatives in this study other than not to participate. Potential risks and benefits will be thoroughly explained to the subjects participating and they are free to withdraw from this study at any point in time prior to or during the course of these investigations.
All information, data, etc., collected as a result of these studies is considered confidential and 
29will be released only as required by law. Information published as a result of this study will be 
protected completely preserving the anonymity of the participants. Per the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) guidelines, research records will be stored in a locked room identified specifically as a patient record room. All transmitting of data is done by coded names and does not identify any types of names (first or last). Results of any procedures or tests will also be de-identified so as to hide the true identity of patient's names or any other identifiers. On occasion, it may be necessary, for legal reasons, or for good clinical practice, for third parties such as the IRB or DSMB members to review medical records that are identified by name. This however would be on special occasions and would not be a common occurrence. Every effort in all areas of care will be made to keep the patient's information as confidential as possible. As noted above, we will minimize risks to human subjects by creating and maintaining a standard of excellence such as we had with our previous clinical trials at our site. Such standard includes active interactions between faculty and staff on a weekly formal basis, and as needed otherwise, careful attention to training of staff in procedures and their possible complications, and a philosophy of ‘patient first’ in all of our dealings. Specifically, we use only trained personnel to perform procedures. The plan to handle adverse events is described in detail in the section of data and safety monitoring plan. 
9.4 Plans for assuring compliance with safety guidelines and regulations
All clinical staff will be required to participate in training offered through their respective Institutional Review Boards. Training is also required in HIPAA in order to have access to study subject records. International Conference of Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines are utilized daily in the clinical research practice and are reviewed periodically. The clinical research teams will have weekly conference calls to provide an opportunity for staff to review and discuss the activities of the study. All clinical and laboratory staff are required to take courses handling blood borne pathogens on a yearly basis as well as training in laboratory safety, handling of biohazards, storage and shipping of clinical and laboratory specimens including dangerous goods.  
3010. Benefits
10.1 Benefits of the investigational agent
As with other randomized, placebo-controlled studies, there may or may not be any benefits for the subject participating in the study. However, participation in this study will provide additional data on the safety and effectiveness of sirolimus for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The information learned from this research study may benefit other subjects with COVID-19, or other similar viral illnesses, in the future. Subjects who participate in the study will receive all study medications at no charge. The laboratory parameters that are obtained strictly for research purposes will not be billed to the patient or their insurance carrier(s). 
10.2 Importance of the knowledge to be gained
The knowledge gained from this study may benefit many subjects with COVID-19, and other similar viral illnesses. The information obtained may improve the scientific community's understanding of the management of COVID-19. Specifically, the study will identify the safety and efficacy of sirolimus in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and thus may alter the clinical approach to patients with this and other similar viral diseases.
10.3 Benefits of Study Procedures
None.
3111. Study Drug 
11.1 Sirolimus or Placebo
Sirolimus is a macrocyclic lactone produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus.

11.2 Pharmacokinetics of sirolimus in humans
Absorption:  Following administration of sirolimus oral solution, the mean times to peak 
concentration (t max) of sirolimus are approximately 1 hour and 2 hours in healthy subjects and 
renal transplant patients, respectively. The systemic availability of sirolimus is low, and was 
estimated to be approximately 14% after the administration of the oral solution. In healthy subjects, the mean bioavailability of sirolimus after administration of the tablet is approximately 
3227% higher relative to the solution. Sirolimus tablets are not bioequivalent to the solution; 
however, clinical equivalence has been demonstrated at the 2mg dose level.28 
Distribution:  The mean (± SD) blood-to-plasma ratio of sirolimus was 36 ± 18 in stable renal 
allograft patients, indicating that sirolimus is extensively partitioned into formed blood elements. The mean volume of distribution of sirolimus is 12 ± 8 L/kg. Sirolimus is extensively bound (approximately 92%) to human plasma proteins, mainly serum albumin (97%), α1-acid  
glycoprotein, and lipoproteins.
28
Metabolism:  Sirolimus is a substrate for both CYP3A4 and P-gp. Sirolimus is extensively 
metabolized in the intestinal wall and liver and undergoes counter-transport from enterocytes of the small intestine into the gut lumen. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp increase sirolimus concentrations. Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp decrease sirolimus concentrations. Sirolimus is extensively metabolized by O-demethylation and/or hydroxylation. Seven major metabolites, including hydroxy, demethyl, and hydroxydemethyl, are identifiable in whole blood. Some of these metabolites are also detectable in plasma, fecal, and urine samples. Sirolimus is the major component in human whole blood and contributes to more than 90% of the drug’s activity.
28
Elimination : After a single dose of [14C] sirolimus oral solution in healthy volunteers, the 
majority (91%) of radioactivity was recovered from the feces, and only a minor amount (2.2%) was excreted in urine. The mean ± SD terminal elimination half-life (t1 ⁄2) of sirolimus after 
multiple dosing in stable renal transplant patients was estimated to be about 62 ± 16 hours.
28
11.3 Accountability of Investigational ProductUnder Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR §312.62) the investigator will maintain adequate records of the disposition of the investigational product(s)/intervention material(s), including the date and quantity of the drug received, to whom the drug was dispensed (participant-by-participant accounting), and a detailed accounting of any investigational product(s)/intervention material(s) accidentally or deliberately destroyed. Records for receipt, storage, use, and disposition will be maintained by the University of Cincinnati’s IDS Pharmacy located at the study site.  A dispensing log will be kept current for each participant. This log will contain the identification of each participant and the date and quantity of investigational product(s)/intervention material(s) dispensed. All records regarding the disposition of the investigational product will be available for inspection by the DSMB, IRB or other appropriate monitoring bodies. 
11.4 Assessment of compliance with the investigational product
Assessment of compliance will be done by daily review of the medication administration record (MAR) in the study subject’s medical chart. In case of lack of absolute clarity regarding study drug administration based on MAR review, contact will be made with one or all of the following: patient’s bedside nurse, investigational pharmacy, and the study subject, in order to determine if the daily dose of the study drug was administered.  
3312. Modification or discontinuation of the investigational product
12.1 Modification of investigational product
The tablet form of the investigational product will be overencapsulated to maintain the blind. The liquid solution will be matched with a liquid placebo solution that has an identical appearance. Placebo capsules are prepared by filling the capsule body with lactose powder.  
For majority of the subjects, sirolimus will be administered in the tablet formulation. However, in 
some subjects this may be substituted to the oral solution while maintaining blinded randomization as clinically indicated, e.g. in patients who have progressed to require advanced respiratory support and cannot take oral pills, the liquid solution may be administered via a feeding tube. 
12.2 Premature discontinuation of investigational product
Refer to Sections 7.1, 12.3 and 13.1. 
12.3 Medication adjustments 
12.3.1 Dose Delays
For patients who are unable to tolerate the protocol-specified dosing schedule, dose adjustments are permitted in order to keep the patient on study drug. If administration of sirolimus must be interrupted because of unacceptable toxicity, drug dosing will be interrupted or modified according to rules described in Section 12.3.2. Given the short trial duration, this will likely result in participant withdrawal from the study. Sirolimus therapy may also be interrupted to accommodate surgical procedures or other invasive therapies at the discretion of treating clinicians. Major Events are non-treatment-related grade 3 and 4 pulmonary and non-pulmonary toxicities. Treatment should be delayed for major events if sirolimus may further complicate the non-treatment related event. If a major event requires a delay of treatment, treatment must be delayed until toxicity is resolved (≤ Grade 1 or ≤ Baseline). For treatment-related toxicities and 
major events, if toxicity is not resolved in ≤ 4 weeks, patient will be taken off the treatment that is 
most likely to be related to the toxicity. 
12.3.2 Dose Reduction 
Any AE of ≥ Grade 3 and attributed as possibly, probably or definitely related to sirolimus will 
result in the dose being held until the AE has resolved to ≤ grade 1 or baseline. If the AE 
resolves, reinstitution of treatment can occur but at a reduced dose of 1mg daily. If the AE recurs at the reduced dose, treatment will be held and the subject will be withdrawn from the study. Of note, an escalation in patient’s level of care (e.g. floor to ICU) or the need for advanced respiratory support will not automatically result in dose reduction of the study drug, unless deemed necessary for patient safety by the PI or the treating clinicians feel it is in the patient’s best interest to be withdrawn ± unblinded. In case the dose of study drug is altered in a subject, in order to maintain blind, a corresponding change will also be made in a placebo subject. Toxicities that may be attributable to sirolimus are listed in Sections 9.1 and 14.3.6. If 
34any of these AEs occur at grade ≤ 2, sirolimus may be continued and the AE managed with 
supportive care. For any AE with a grade ≥ 3, the rules outlined in Sections 14.2 – 14.10 apply 
for holding of dose, dose reduction, removal from study and reporting requirements. 
12.3.3 Concomitant medications
All concomitant medications including taken during the course of the study will be documented on a CRF on a daily basis. This record will include start and stop dates, dose, and indication for use for each concomitant medication. 
12.3.4 Prohibited medications
Metabolism of sirolimus occurs in the liver and the small intestine by the CYP3A4 family of enzymes. Thus, concomitant administration of sirolimus with other CYP3A substrates or inducers can alter the oral bioavailability of sirolimus.
33 Because of the potential interaction with 
other drugs involving CYP3A4 metabolic pathways, strong inhibitors and strong inducers of CYP3A4 will not be allowed to be used concomitantly with the study medication. Similarly, patients on chronic immunosuppressive medications may be at higher risk of adverse effects from sirolimus and will be excluded from study participation. A list of the prohibited medications is provided below. While this list covers the majority of medications, the PI will carefully review the concomitant medications in each potential subject prior to enrollment to ensure the study drug can be given safely. In case, a subject is not enrolled due to a concomitant medciation not listed in this table, we will note medication and the rationale on our screening log. 
List of prohibited medications for this study

3513. Procedures
13.1 Stopping rules
13.1.1 Study discontinuation
The DSMB and the IRB have the authority to stop or suspend this trial at any time. This study may be suspended or closed if:
•Early stopping rules have been met
•The study objectives have been met
•The study chair/investigators believe it is not safe for the study to continue
•The DSMB suspends or closes the trial
13.1.2 Subject discontinuation
An intent-to-treat approach will be used. All data acquired prior to termination for the reasons outlined below will be included in the primary analysis unless patient withdraws consent. Every effort will be made to conduct a final study visit with the participant and participants will be followed clinically until, if applicable, all AEs attributable to study drug resolve. Please refer to Section 7.1 for a list of the reasons that may lead to participant withdrawal from the study. 
13.1.3 Study early stopping rules
Study enrollment will be suspended pending expedited review of all pertinent data by the IRB and the DSMB if any one of the following occurs:
•Death from any cause in any subject judged related to study drug
•Multiple medically similar serious adverse events related to study medication
•Events that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator contraindicate further dosing of 
additional subjects
If one of the above-listed stopping rules are met, a prompt cumulative review of safety data and 
of the circumstances of the event(s) in question will be conducted to determine whether study entry should be resumed, whether the protocol will be modified, or whether the study will be discontinued permanently. Review and approval by the DSMB is required for resumption of the study in the event the study is interrupted because of one of the above-listed events.
13.1.4 Individual early stopping rules
A study participant will be terminated from the study if any of the following occurs during the 
study:
•Recurrent or persistent sirolimus-related toxicity unresponsive to treatment in spite of dose 
adjustments.
•Pregnancy 
•The participant refuses to continue in the study 
•The investigator determines that the participant should be withdrawn from the study for 
reasons not listed above
36A subject will be considered evaluable if they took one dose of the study drug. Subjects who are 
withdrawn before initiating treatment will be considered as premature discontinuation, and will be replaced by another participant. 
Every effort will be made to obtain endpoint evaluations for subjects who withdraw or who 
discontinue prematurely from the study. The same evaluations performed at final visit will be completed at the time of termination. If withdrawal is due to inability to tolerate investigational drug or other untoward event related to investigational drug, the withdrawal will be noted in data analysis as treatment failure. 
13.2 Follow-up after early study termination
Participants who are prematurely withdrawn from study drug exposure due to adverse events will be followed to monitor safety until hospital discharge or until resolution or stabilization of the disqualifying event or until the PI determines that further follow-up is not needed.
13.3 Participant replacement
Participants with early termination from this study will be replaced if they are deemed non-evaluable. 
3714. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan
The study protocol will be reviewed and approved by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) and the University of Cincinnati IRB prior to study initiation.  Participant enrollment may only begin with IRB approved consent forms. This is an interventional exploratory phase II study.
14.1 Study Oversight
The Principal Investigator (PI) has primary oversight responsibility of this clinical trial. The DSMB has oversight responsibility of the Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) for this clinical trial. The DSMB will review accrual, patterns and frequencies of all adverse events, and protocol compliance on a periodic basis. For this study the DSMB will meet once prior to study activation, and at the following subsequent times: once the study has reached 25% (7 subjects), 50% (15 subjects), 75% (22 subjects) and 100% (30 subjects) of its target enrollment. The DSMB will review the patient safety data at these meetings in an unblinded fashion to assess for participant safety. No interim analysis for efficacy will be performed. The DSMB makes recommendations to the PI regarding the continuation status of the protocol.
The site PI and their research team (co-Investigators, research nurses, clinical trial coordinators, 
and data managers) are responsible for identifying AEs. Aggregate report - detailed by severity, attribution (expected or unexpected), and relationship to the study drug/study procedures – will be available for site review. 
14.2 Adverse Events
This section defines the types of AEs and outlines the procedures for appropriately collecting, grading, recording, and reporting them. Information in this section complies with ICH Guideline E2A: Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting and ICH E6: Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and applies the standards set forth in the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 5.0. These criteria have been reviewed by the study investigators and have been determined appropriate for this study population.
14.3 Definitions
14.3.1 Adverse events
An AE is any occurrence or worsening of an undesirable or unintended sign, symptom, laboratory finding, or disease that is experienced during participation in the trial. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) Study Agent(s) or a study procedure, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) Study Agent(s) or study procedure. Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is screened will be considered as baseline and not recorded as an AE. However, if the condition deteriorates or changes in severity at any time during the study it will be recorded and reported as an AE.  
3814.3.2 Suspected adverse reaction and adverse reaction
Suspected adverse reaction (SAR) means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A SAR implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction (AR), which means any adverse event caused by a drug.
An AR means any AE caused by a drug. ARs are a subset of all SARs for which there are 
reasons to conclude that the drug caused the event.
14.3.3 Adverse events associated with study procedures
The following clinical situations and laboratory parameters will be considered to be outside of the normal range of findings and will be recorded as AEs. These situations do not limit the PI from reporting any other events, associated or not with these procedures, from being recorded and reported as AEs.  
Blood draws
•Fainting/vasovagal events
•Bruising at puncture site greater than 2 cm in diameter
•Bleeding from puncture site lasting more than 5 minutes
•Swelling at puncture site larger than 2 cm
14.3.4 Adverse events associated with laboratory testing
The following table highlights the laboratory values that are being obtained as part of the study 
along with the reference range for normal values. While any value outside the reference range 
will be classified as abnormal, the clinical significance of those abnormal values will be 
determined based on the criteria set forth in the table. All lab values identified as clinically 
significant will be marked as an AE. The causality and attribution of the lab value to the study 
drug, as well as action items with regards to follow-up and management of laboratory values 
that are listed as clinically significant, will be adjudicated on an individual basis by the study PI. 
Laboratory parameter Reference Range Reported as clinically significant if
Serum Creatinine 0.50 – 0.99 mg/dl ≥1.5 times baseline
AST 10 – 35 U/L ≥ 105 U/L (3 times ULN)
ALT 6 – 29 U/L ≥ 87 U/L (3 times ULN)
Hemoglobin 11.7 – 15.5 gm/dl Decrease of ≥2gm/dL  from baseline
Total white blood cells 3.8 – 10.8 x 103/μL≤ 3 or ≥ 11.5 x 103/μL
Absolute neutrophils 1500 – 7800 cells/ μL< 1,000 or > 9,500 cells/ μL
Absolute lymphocytes 850 – 3900 cells/ μL < 500 or > 4500 cells/ μL
Absolute monocytes 200 – 950 cells/ μL < 150 or > 1,500 cells/ μL
Absolute eosinophils 15 – 500 cells/ μL < 5 or > 1,000 cells/ μL
Absolute basophils 0 – 200 cells/ μL > 500 cells/ μL
Platelet count 140 – 400 x 103/μL < 120 or > 450 x 103/μL
39Abbreviations : AST = Aspartate aminotransferase, ALT = Alanine aminotransferase, MCH = 
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin, MCHC = Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, MCV = 
Mean corpuscular volume, RDW = Red blood cell distribution width. 
While the guidance above is meant to cover all laboratory values obtained during the study, we 
realize that it may not be able to cover all the unique circumstances that can arise during the 
conduct of a clinical trial. As such, in rare situations, the study PI may change the clinical 
significance of a lab value outside of the above guidance. We do not anticipate this situation to 
arise commonly, however, and if deviating from the above range while assigning clinical 
significance, the reason for this diversion will be clearly outlined in the subject’s study binder. 
Adverse events related to study medication will be tabulated by body system and by severity using the NCI CTCAE v 5.0. 
14.3.5 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
An AE or SAR is considered “serious” if it results in any of the following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32(a):
•Death:  A death that occurs during the study or that comes to the attention of the 
investigator during the protocol-defined follow-up. 
•A life-threatening event: An AE or SAR is considered “life-threatening” if, in the opinion 
of the investigator, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or SAR that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.
•An inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.
•Persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions.
•An important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, in the opinion of the investigator, it may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
•Congenital anomaly or birth defect.
Regardless of the relationship of the AE to the study, the event will be reported per Section 
14.3.5 as an SAE if it meets any of the above definitions. 
14.3.6 Expected adverse events
Detailed information regarding adverse effects of sirolimus is provided in Section 9.1. This section lists the AEs regarded as expected for sirolimus (in alphabetical order of systems):
Cardiovascular: Peripheral edema, hypertension
Cutaneous: Acne, skin rash, mucositisGastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dyspepsia General: Fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias Hematological: Anemia, thrombocytopeniaInfectious: Increased risk of infectionsLiver: Increased serum bilirubin
40Nervous system: headache
Pulmonary: pneumonitis Renal: Increased serum creatinine
14.3.7 Unexpected adverse event
An AE or SAR is considered “unexpected” when its nature, severity or frequency is not consistent with the information that is provided with the information in the protocol. 
14.4 Collecting, recording and managing adverse events
14.4.1 Identifying adverse events
Any AE that occurs from the moment the subject has signed the consent form will be recorded and is reportable. Collection time for AEs and SAEs will begin after the screening visit when the consent form is signed and will continue until the end of the treatment.
Adverse events may be discovered through any of these methods:
•Electronic medical record review
•Observing the participant
•Questioning the participant, with standardized questions/procedures.
•Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the participant.
•An abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can also indicate an 
AE when determined to be clinically significant by the PI. Pre-specified criteria for abnormal lab values are provided in Section 14.3.4. 
14.4.2 Recording AEs
Throughout the study all identified AEs (serious and non-serious) will be recorded on all appropriate source document and AE case report forms (CRFs) regardless of their severity or relation to the study.  A complete description of all AEs will include event description, time of onset, investigator assessment of severity, relationship to study agent or procedures, time of resolution/stabilization of the event, expectedness, determination of whether the AE qualifies as a SAE, and action taken. A change in the severity of the AE will also be documented. Assessment of severity and relationship will be documented on the source documents or on the CRFs. 
14.4.3 Recording SAEs
SAEs will be recorded on the SAE CRF and will include a narrative of the event signed and dated by the PI. 
14.5 Managing adverse events
The study investigator must apply his or her clinical judgment as to whether an AE is of sufficient severity to require that the participant immediately be removed from further receiving 
41the study agent under the protocol. The investigator must institute any necessary medical 
therapy to protect a participant from any immediate dangers.
An AE will be followed until any of the following takes place:  a) it is resolved, b) participant is 
stable, c) participant is discharged from the hospital and the PI determines that follow-up is no longer needed.
If an abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation is determined to be an AE, 
then the evaluation that produced the value or result can be repeated until the value or result returns to normal, or the result can be explained, or the usual standard of care does not require further follow-up, and the participant’s safety is not at risk.  
Non-serious expected AEs will be submitted to the DSMB in a timely fashion. The events will be 
presented in tabular form and given to the DSMB at every scheduled meeting. Study investigators are also required to fulfill all reporting requirements of their local institutions.
14.6 Grading and Attribution
14.6.1 Grading Criteria
In addition to determining whether an AE fulfills criteria for a SAE or not, the severity of AEs experienced by study participants will be graded according to the criteria set forth in the NCI CTCAE v 5.0. This document provides a common language to describe levels of severity, to analyze and interpret data, and to articulate the clinical significance of all adverse events.  All AEs whether or not listed in the NCI CTCAE manual will be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following standards in the NCI-CTCAE manual (A semi-colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade):
Grade 1  = Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated. 
Grade 2  = Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc).
Grade 3  = Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or 
prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living (bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden). 
Grade 4  = Life-threatening consequences; or urgent intervention indicated.
Grade 5  = Death related to AE.
14.7 Definition of Attribution
The attribution of an AE to the study drug will be determined by the PI or designated physician co/sub-investigator. The PI or designee will record the determination of attribution on the 
42appropriate AE or SAE form. The attribution of an AE to the investigational drug or to a study 
procedure will be determined using the descriptors in the following table. For the purpose of this study, in addition to all study medications, the following procedures will be considered when determining attribution:
Code Descriptor Definition (guidelines)
UNRELATED CATEGORY 
1 Unrelated The adverse event is clearly not related to study.  The event is 
completely related to an etiology other than the study product or study intervention (the alternative etiology must be documented in the study subject’s medical record)
2 Unlikely The adverse event is doubtfully related to study and likely to be 
related to factors other than study product or study intervention.
RELATED CATEGORIES
3 Possible The adverse event may be related to study.  There is an 
association between the event and the administration of study product and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the study product; there may be also an alternative etiology, such as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status and/or underlying disease
4 Probable The adverse event is likely related to study.  There is (1) an 
association between the event and the administration of study product or study intervention, (2) a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the study product, and (3) the event could not be reasonably explained by known characteristics of the subject’s clinical status and or an alternative etiology is not apparent
5 Definite The adverse event is clearly related to study.  There is (1) an 
association between the event and the administration of the study product or study intervention, (2) a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the related to the study product, and (3) causes other than the study product have been ruled out and/or the event re-appeared on re-exposure to the study product
For additional information and a printable version of the NCI-CTCAE manual, the NCI-CTCAE 
website: http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html will be consulted. In a clinical trial, the study 
product\intervention will always be suspect when attributing an AE and the “unrelated” attribution will be used only when there is an undisputable or likely alternative explanation for the AE. 
14.8 SAE Reporting Criteria and Procedures
The PI will be notified by the study staff as soon as a study staff member becomes aware of the SAE. In the absence of the PI, a physician sub-investigator will be notified. An unexpected, non-serious AE that is of Grade 3 severity or higher and study related will be recorded and reported 
43under the SAE reporting procedure. 
14.8.1 Notifying the IRB and DSMB
The PI will submit all safety reports on an ongoing basis to the DSMB.  Individual or clusters of 
SAEs may be reported expeditiously to the DSMB upon determination. The PI determines causality (definitely not related, probably not related, possibly related, probably related, definitely related) of the AE. The DSMB Chair may request further information if necessary and possibly request changes to the protocol or consent form as a consequence of the AE. A back-up notification system will be instituted so that any delays in review by the Chair beyond a specified period of time are forwarded to a secondary reviewer. 
SAE’s that are life-threatening/disabling or result in death of research participant; AND 
unexpected; AND related to the research  must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of 
learning of the event. The sponsor/investigator will report the event to the IRB and DSMB promptly. Investigators must report all other SAEs to the DSMB within 5 working days  (of 
learning of the event).
The PI will ensure the timely dissemination of SAE information, including expedited reports, to 
the IRB in accordance with IRB regulations and guidelines. Events that will be reported to the IRB but do not require prompt reporting  
1. Reasonably anticipated (“expected”) potential risks and adverse events described in the 
Informed Consent Process and listed on the Informed Consent Form.
2. Deaths not attributed to the research and deemed not related to the research   (no 
connection between the study procedures and the death) do not require prompt reporting.
3.Protocol deviations or violations not involving risks  to participants or unlikely to recur
4.Data Safety Monitoring Board reports, interim analyses, or other reports, findings, or new 
information not altering the risk/benefit profile
5. Investigator Brochure updates not involving safety information6. Problems or findings not involving risk (unless the information could affect participants’ 
willingness to continue in the research)
Events that require prompt reporting  to the IRB 
1. Unanticipated problems involving risks to participants and others 
2. Adverse events that are unexpected, related to the research, and involve new or increased 
risk to participant or others
3. Significant protocol deviations (or other accidental or unintentional changes to the protocol 
or procedures) involving safety or integrity risks or with the potential to reoccur
4. Complaints made by research participants indicating an unanticipated event, or complaints 
that cannot be resolved by the research staff
5. Unapproved changes made to the research to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to a 
research participant 
446. Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reports, interim analyses, or other oversight 
committee/monitoring reports/recommendations altering the risks/benefit profile
7. New information indicating an unexpected change in risks or potential benefits  8. Investigator’s Brochure (IB or IDB) updates or revisions to safety information9.   Other unanticipated problems such as breach of confidentiality, loss of study data or forms, 
etc. that could influence the safe conduct of the research
14.8.2 Notifying the FDA
The Investigational New Drug (IND) sponsor (PI) is responsible for the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) safety submissions as follows: The IND Sponsor for this study will handle all regulatory communications with the FDA and will be responsible to update the IND to include this trial, file all regulatory related issues including any MEDWATCH reports which will be reviewed and approved by the PI and Steering Committee. The IND sponsor will be responsible for submission of yearly reports and final report for this study. All DSMB recommendations will be communicated to the IND sponsor in a timely fashion. 
The following process for reporting a serious adverse event ensures compliance with the ICH 
guidelines, 21CFR §312.32. 
•Expedited safety report to the FDA applies if the adverse event is classified as one of the 
following:
oSerious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction (SUSAR) (Sections 14.3.4, 
14.3.6, and 14.7) (i.e. serious, unexpected, and related)Or
oAggregate analysis of adverse events that suggest a causal relationship to the 
study medicationsOr
oAny findings from clinical, epidemiological, pooled analysis of data pooled across 
multiple studies, published or unpublished scientific papers or any findings from animal or in vitro testing that would result in a safety-related change in the protocol, informed consent, investigator brochure or other aspects of the overall conduct of the trial will be reported.
Expedited Safety Reports must be reported by the IND Sponsor to the FDA within 15 calendar 
days; fatal or immediately life-threatening serious, unexpected, suspected adverse reactions must be reported within 7 calendar days. SAEs that do not strictly fit the above criteria may be reported to the FDA in an expedited manner if the IND Sponsor chose to do so.  Each 7-day report must be followed up by a 15-day report.
The following types of SAEs will be reported in the IND Annual Report:
• Serious, expected, suspected adverse reactions • Serious but not a suspected adverse reaction 
45For standard reporting, the IND Sponsor or designee will file the IND Annual Report. All AEs 
(not just those requiring 24 hour reporting) will be reported in the Annual IND Report.
14.9 Reporting Pregnancy
A research subject will be terminated from the study due to pregnancy. The PI will be informed immediately of any pregnancy and will report all pregnancies within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event to DSMB utilizing the SAE report form. This report is for tracking purposes only. All pregnancies that are identified during the study will be followed to conclusion and the outcome of each will be reported. The PI will discuss with the participant and/or the treating physician the known possible risks of the investigational product(s) on the fetus. Monitoring of the participant will continue until the conclusion of the pregnancy, and a follow-up SAE report form detailing the outcome of the pregnancy will be submitted to the DSMB. Due to the short study time (maximum of 14 days), and the exclusion of pregnant women from study participation, we do not anticipate having to report pregnancy as part of this study. 
14.10 Non-serious adverse events reporting
14.10.1 Notifying the data and safety monitoring board
The DSMB will be notified of non-serious AEs during their regularly scheduled meetings. The events will be presented to the Board in tabular format. 
14.10.2 Notifying the Institutional Review Board
The PI will ensure the timely dissemination of AE information to the IRB in accordance with applicable regulations and guidelines. 
14.10.3 Notifying the FDA
The IND sponsor (the Study Chair) will file all adverse events per 21 CFR 312.32, whether 
expedited or part of the IND Annual Report.  The IND sponsor will be responsible for compiling the IND Annual Report.
14.10.4 Unanticipated Problems
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:
Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;
Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research); and
46Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.
Incidents or events that meet the OHRP criteria for unanticipated problems will be reported to 
the DSMB and IRB, in the following time frames:
1. Unanticipated problems that are SAEs should be reported to the IRB within 1 week of the 
investigator becoming aware of the event.
2. Any other unanticipated problem should be reported to the IRB according to the IRB’s 
reporting policies.
14.11 Data Management
All study data will be collected via systems created by using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap, an online data management software) and will comply with all applicable guidelines regarding patient confidentiality and data integrity. Data access in REDCap is password protected and limited to authorized study personnel. All paper records will be kept in secure files in locked cabinets inside locked offices with access limited to authorized study personnel. All other study specific documents and logs will be stored on computer drives hosted and protected by the University of Cincinnati policies with regular back-ups. 
14.11.1 Registration
Registration of participants on this protocol will employ an interactive data system in which the clinical site (University of Cincinnati) will attest to the participant’s eligibility as per protocol criteria and obtain appropriate informed consent. IRB approval for the protocol must be obtained before accrual can occur from the clinical site.
Each participant enrolled will be assigned a local identifier by the enrollment site.  This number 
can be a combination of the site identifier (location code) and a serial accession number.  Only the registering site will have access to the linkage between this number and the personal identifier of the subject.  
14.11.2 Data Entry
Data collection for this study will be accomplished with online electronic case report forms. Using encrypted communication links, on-line forms will be developed that contain the requisite data fields. 
14.11.3 Data Quality and Monitoring Measures
As much as possible data quality is assessed at the data entry point using intelligent on-line data entry via visual basic designed screen forms. Data element constraints, whether 
47independent range and/or format limitations or ‘relative’ referential integrity limitations, can be 
enforced by all methods employed for data input. Quality assurance reports assess data quality post-data entry. As we note, data quality begins with the design of the data collection forms and procedures and incorporates reasonable checks to minimize transcription and omission errors. Of the more important quality assurance measures are the internal validity checks for reasonableness and consistency. 
The DSMB will review data quality on an ongoing basis. A risk-based monitoring plan will be 
developed to support the study. The purposes of study monitoring are to ensure the safety and welfare of study participants and to confirm the accuracy of study data. 
An onsite monitoring visit will occur once during the conduct of the trial, with the option of 
making a second visit if deemed necessary by the PI, to address enrollment, or protocol deviation issues. The Monitoring Plan will detail the frequency and level of intensity of on-site monitoring visits. In general, the study will be monitored for all participants at a level of 100% of study data gathered for inclusion and exclusion criteria, informed consent procedures, AEs and unanticipated problems. The study monitor(s) will collaborate with the PI to conduct remedial site training to ensure compliance with GCP and all regulations.   
During scheduled interim remote monitoring visits, the clinical monitors will verify that the 
protocol is being followed and that data are being collected according to protocol requirements. The clinical monitor(s) will review the Study Regulatory File to determine that all required documentation is being collected and that the IRB approval for the site is current. The monitor will then verify that each participant has signed the correct version of the ICF, and that this document is filed in the participant’s source documents.  At each visit, the monitor will perform an audit of the source documents in the subject’s binder by checking them against the database. AE documentation will be checked for completeness and accuracy. At the study closeout, the monitor(s) will confirm that all data have been reviewed, all source documents have been verified, and all required documents are present in the Study Regulatory File.  
Protocol deviations and unanticipated problems will be reviewed by the PI, and the regulatory 
and monitoring staff to determine the need for corrective and preventative action (CAPA). In the event that corrective and/or preventative action is warranted, a root cause analysis will be performed and a CAPA will be completed as per institutional policy. The PI is responsible for communicating the CAPA plan to appropriate staff (i.e. Site Investigator, study team) and obtaining appropriate signatures to address the issues at hand. The PI will work with regulatory and monitoring staff to ensure that the CAPA is followed and is effective in resolving the issue(s). Protocol deviations and unanticipated problems will be reported to the IRB as per institutional policy.  
The table below describes the variables to be reviewed during monitoring visits.

14.12 Protocol Deviations
The practices below are consistent with Good Clinical Practice (GCP ICH E6) Sections:
•Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3
•Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1
•Noncompliance sections 5.20.1, and 5.20.2
14.12.1 Protocol deviation Definition
14.12.1.1 Protocol Deviation  - Any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or 
procedures of a research protocol that affects the subject's rights, safety, or well-being and/or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data constitutes a protocol violation. Changes or alterations in the conduct of the trial which do not have a major impact on the subject's rights, safety or well-being, or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data are considered non-major protocol deviations. Site Principal Investigator is responsible for reporting protocol deviations to the IRB using the standard reporting form. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by the site and implemented promptly.
14.12.1.2 Major Protocol Deviation (Protocol Violation)  - A protocol violation is a deviation 
from the IRB approved protocol that may affect the subject's rights, safety, or well-being and/or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data. 
If the deviation meets any of the following criteria, it is considered a major protocol deviation.  
However, the lists of deviation examples that follow are not exhaustive. 
•The deviation has harmed or posed a significant or substantive risk of harm to the 
research subject.
Examples:
1. A research subject received the wrong treatment or incorrect dose.
2. A research subject met withdrawal criteria during the study but was not withdrawn3. A research subject received an excluded concomitant medication.
•The deviation compromises the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study.
Examples:
1. A research subject was enrolled but does not meet the protocol's eligibility criteria.
2. Changing the protocol without prior IRB approval, except for modification to ensure the 
49safety of study participants.
3. Inadvertent loss of samples or data.
•The deviation is a willful or knowing breach of human subject protection regulations, 
policies, or procedures on the part of the investigator(s).
Examples:
1. Working under an expired professional license or certification.
2. Failure to follow federal and/or local regulations.3. Repeated minor deviations.
•The deviation is inconsistent with the NIH Human Research Protection Program’s 
research, medical, and ethical principles. 
Examples:
1. A breach of confidentiality.
2. Inadequate or improper informed consent procedure.
14.12.1.3 Non-Major Protocol Deviation  - A non-major protocol deviation is any change, 
divergence, or departure from the study design or procedures of a research protocol that has not been approved by the IRB and which does not have a major impact on the subject's rights, safety or well-being, or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data. 
14.12.2 Reporting Protocol Deviations
Deviations from the protocol are not allowed. It is the responsibility of the study site to use continuous vigilance to identify and report any protocol deviations. Upon determination that a protocol deviation has occurred, the study staff will notify the PI and complete the Protocol Deviation form. The PI will complete and sign the Protocol Deviation form and submit it to the IRB, per IRB regulations. Major protocol deviations will be reported to the DSMB at the regular DSMB reporting interval. 
5015. Statistical considerations
Sample size determination : In a study evaluating 201 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in 
China, 82% (165 patients) required supplemental oxygen. Among the patients needing supplemental oxygen, 40% (67 patients) progressed to require advanced respiratory support during their hospital stay.
8 Considering the fact that our study inclusion criteria mandates the 
need for supplemental oxygen and the presence of at least one additional poor prognostic biomarker, we anticipate that 50% of our control group will progress to require advanced respiratory support during their hospitalization. We expect that treatment with sirolimus will reduce the need for advanced respiratory support to 25%. 
The goal of this pilot study is to determine a meaningful treatment difference in order to conduct 
a larger confirmatory trial. Given the limited data on treatment responsiveness in COVID-19 populations, we examined various enrollment sizes commensurate with planning a pilot study. Specifically, we undertook a recommended approach for pilot studies in clinical research, which is to not perform hypothesis testing with a significance level set at the traditional value of 0.05.
34-
37 The confidence intervals for the treatment difference were calculated based on demonstrating 
a reduction in the proportion of subjects needing advanced respiratory support from 0.50 in the placebo group to 0.25 in the sirolimus group. Various levels have been proposed as optimal thresholds for the tolerance of type I error in the context of pilot studies, with the highest being p=0.25.
34 We chose the type I error rate of 0.2 to denote significant treatment effect between the 
treatment and placebo arms in our study, as proposed by Stallard.37 A sample size of 30 
patients randomized in a 2:1 fashion in favor of sirolimus will allow us to estimate the treatment differences with 80% confidence based on a binomial two-proportion test. A two-sided test will be used since we are unsure if the treatment will have a beneficial effect in this patient population. 
Data Analysis Plan: The primary endpoint of this study is progression to respiratory failure 
requiring advanced support measures. The difference in proportions of progression between the placebo and sirolimus groups and the 80% confidence interval will be calculated. If the confidence interval for the difference in proportions does not include zero, then we will conclude that the treatment difference is clinically meaningful. Considering the small sample size of our study, the significant impact of age and other pre-existing conditions such as diabetes mellitus on overall prognosis in patients with COVID-19 cannot be accounted for in the primary analysis. Patients will be randomized according to a computer-generated permuted block randomization stratified on age: <50 years, 50 – 64 years, and ≥65 years. In case recruitment lags we will add 
external study sites. In such a scenario, University of Cincinnati and the facilities of the affiliated health systems UC Health, LLC and University of Cincinnati Physicians Company, LLC will follow the same randomization scheme. In case of other external sites, randomization will be stratified based on site in addition to the above-mentioned age-based stratification. As exploratory analysis, we will conduct analyses examining differences based on other prognostic factors and concomitant medications such as corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin etc. An intent-to-treat analysis will be performed for the primary outcome.  
5116. Identification and access to source data
16.1 Identifying source data
The site PI will keep accurate records to ensure that the conduct of the study is fully documented. Data derived from source documents will be transferred to protocol-specific CRFs. The results of all clinical and clinical laboratory evaluations will be maintained in the participant’s medical records or hospital database and the data will be transferred to clinical CRFs, as applicable.
16.2 Updating source documentation
Documents describing the safety profile of an investigational product will be amended as needed to ensure that the description of safety information adequately reflects any new clinical findings. The site PI will provide the IRB with the most up-to-date versions of the above documents as soon as the PI becomes aware of any changes.  
16.3 Permitting access to source data
The investigational site participating in this study (University of Cincinnati) will maintain the highest degree of confidentiality for the clinical and research information obtained from the participants in this clinical trial.  Medical and research records will be maintained at the study site in the strictest confidence.  However, as a part of the quality assurance and legal responsibilities of an investigator, the investigational site will permit the study monitor, authorized representatives of the IRB, the FDA, and health authorities to examine (and when required by applicable law, to copy) clinical records for the purpose of quality assurance reviews, audits, and evaluations of the study safety and progress. Unless required by the laws that permit copying of records, only the coded identity associated with documents or with other participant data may be copied (and all personally identifying information will be removed). Authorized representatives as noted above are bound to maintain the strict confidentiality of medical and research information that is linked to identify individuals.  
16.4 Quality control and quality assurance
The PI will keep accurate records to ensure that the conduct of the study is fully documented. The investigator will ensure that all CRFs and participant study files are legible and complete for every participant.
The PI, through the use of the DSMB, will be responsible for the regular review of the conduct of 
the trial, for verifying adherence to the protocol, and for confirming the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of all documented data and accuracy of source documentation verification.  
When the CRFs are complete, they will be reviewed and signed by the PI.  All discrepancies 
identified by the site monitor will be reviewed, and any resulting queries will be resolved with the site PIs and the CRFs will be amended as needed.
5217. Ethical considerations and compliance with good clinical practice
17.1 Statement of Compliance
This study was designed to ensure the protection of subjects according to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and amendments concerning medical research in human subjects. This clinical study will be conducted using current good clinical practice (cGCP), as delineated in ICH, Guidance for Industry: E6 Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance, and according to the criteria specified in this study protocol.  Before study initiation, the protocol and the informed consent documents will be reviewed and approved by the DSMB, the IRB, as well as any other appropriate health authorities. Any amendments to the protocol or to the consent materials will also be approved by the appropriate bodies listed above prior to implementation.
17.2 Informed Consent
Each subject will be provided with oral and written information describing the nature and duration of the study. Written consent must be obtained prior to screening while following the informed consent procedures as detailed in Section 6.3. Prospective participant must be given ample opportunity to review the informed consent and inquire about the results of the study. All participants must read, sign, and date a consent form prior to study participation. Subject will enter the date of the consent. The original, signed consent form will be retained with the study center’s records, and each subject will receive a copy. The ICF will provide information about the study to a prospective participant to allow for an informed decision about participation in the study. Consent materials for participants who do not speak or read English will be translated into the participants’ appropriate language.
The ICF will be revised and receive IRB approval whenever important new safety information is 
available, whenever the protocol is amended, and/or whenever any new information becomes available that may affect participation in the trial.
A copy of the ICF will be given to a prospective participant for review. The PI or an approved 
designee will discuss the consent with the prospective participant and answer questions.  The prospective participant will be told that being in the trial is voluntary and that he or she may withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason. The site will document details of the informed consent process within the study records.
5318. Privacy and Confidentiality
A participant’s privacy and confidentiality will be respected throughout the study.  Each 
participant will be assigned a sequential identification number and these numbers rather than names will be used during collection, storage, and reporting of participant information.
Data for this study will be received in electronic format from EPIC. Data will come from EPIC 
notes written as part of the research encounters, as well as field data collected using specific case report forms designed for this study. Field data will be collected on a stationary desktop computer using RedCap and will comply with all applicable guidelines regarding patient confidentiality and data integrity. Data access in REDCap is password protected and limited to authorized study personnel. Electronic data collected in the field will be protected from theft using whole disk encryption. During the study, data will be hosted at University of Cincinnati’s secure Data Center with regular back-ups. All paper records will be kept in secure files in locked cabinets inside locked offices with access limited to authorized study personnel. Upon completion of the study, private data will be destroyed by certified system administrators per UC policy.

The researcher and sponsor of this study do not promise that you will receive any benefits from this study.WHY IS THIS RESEARCH BEING DONE?
The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and efficacy of sirolimus in patients admitted to the hospital with the novel Coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). Sirolimus is FDA approved to prevent rejection in patients who receive kidney transplants and to treat a rare lung disease named Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). Sirolimus is not FDA-approved to treat COVID-19. COVID-19 is a life-threatening illness that can lead to hospitalization in about 20% of the patients. One-fourth of the hospitalized patients are sick enough to require intensive care unit (ICU) admission. COVID-19 is fatal in about 2% of the patients. 
WHY HAVE YOU BEEN ASKED TO TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY?
You are being asked to take part in this research study because you have been diagnosed 
with either confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia or your doctors feel that you have a very high likelihood of having COVID-19 pneumonia. You are eligible because you are admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia, have low oxygen levels, and have at least one other marker that suggests that you may be at a higher risk of complications from COVID-19. You must also be over 18 years old to be eligible for this study. The results from this study will help us determine the safety and efficacy of sirolimus in treating hospitalized patients with COVID-19. 
HOW LONG WILL YOU BE IN THE RESEARCH STUDY?
You will be in the research study for 14 days, or until hospital discharge, whatever happens 
first. This consent shall remain in effect until the end of the research study, unless you choose to withdraw it.
Your doctor may remove you from the study if your disease becomes worse or if side effects 
become very severe.  Your doctor may also remove you from the study if new scientific developments occur that indicate the treatment is no longer optimal. You may also be withdrawn from the study if you fail to follow instructions provided by the investigators.
You may withdraw from the study at any time. If you decide to stop participating in the study, 
we encourage you to talk to the researcher and your regular doctor first so that stopping can be done safely. Another reason to tell your doctor that you are thinking about stopping is to discuss what follow-up care and testing could be most helpful to you.
If you withdraw, the data collected to the point of withdrawal will remain part of the study data 
and may not be removed. You may be asked whether you wish to provide further data collection from your routine medical care.Approved: 4/13/2020

WHO IS CONDUCTING THE RESEARCH STUDY? 
This study is being directed and carried out by Nishant Gupta MD, a researcher at the 
University of Cincinnati. Dr. Gupta is the lead investigator for this study. The study drug, sirolimus, is being provided by the drug manufacturer, Pfizer, at no charge. 
Research will take place at University of Cincinnati and the facilities of the affiliated health 
systems UC Health, LLC and University of Cincinnati Physicians Company, LLC.
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THE RESEARCH STUDY?
About 30 people will take part in this study. WHO SHOULD NOT BE IN THE RESEARCH STUDY? 
You cannot participate in this study if any of the following apply to you:
•If you are not able or willing to give consent
•If you are enrolled in other clinical trials
•If you are under the age of 18 years
•If you are pregnant or breast feeding
•If you are on ventilatory support for your breathing 
•If you have serious co-existing medical conditions like liver cirrhosis, kidney failure, 
heart failure or untreated infections other than COVID-19
•If you have active cancers such as lymphoma
•If you are on a medication that can suppress your immune system such as 
cyclosporine, adalimumab, methotrexate, infliximab, mycophenolate, azathioprine, or on medications that have known interactions with sirolimus such as rifampin, phenytoin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, St. John’s wort, erythromycin. 
WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE RESEARCH STUDY? 
At the first visit, we will give you this consent form to read and sign. We will explain the study 
to you.  We will answer any questions you might have about this study. After all of your questions are answered and you have had a chance to read and sign the consent form, you will be allowed to participate in this research study. 
If you take part in this study, you will be asked to provide your medical history including any 
available medical records. We will review your medical history to make sure that you are eligible to participate. 
You will be randomly selected to receive either sirolimus or a placebo that contains no active 
medication.  You will have a 2 out of 3 chance of receiving sirolimus and a 1 out of 3 chance of receiving the placebo.  Neither you nor the researchers will know if you are getting sirolimus or placebo. This is essential in order to not bias the study results. You will receive Approved: 4/13/2020
Do Not Use After: 4/12/2021IRB #: 2020-0337
Page 4 of 13either sirolimus or placebo for a maximum period of 14 days. The treatment duration may be 
less than 14 days if you get discharged from the hospital before the 14 day time frame. 
You will be given the study medication at roughly the same time by your nurse. We will collect 
data from your medical records on a daily basis. In addition, we will contact you on days 1, 3, 7 and 14 to check on your status and determine if you are having any side effects from the study medication. We will also collect blood to measure lab tests that can help determine if the treatment has had a beneficial effect. These tests will be performed on days 3, 7, and 14. The trial may end before all of your study procedures are completed if trial continuation is determined to be unsafe.
If you take part in this study, you will have the following tests and procedures:
1. Blood Draw: Blood tests to measure laboratory parameters that can help assess 
treatment benefit will be drawn at baseline and then at days 3, 7 and 14.  Up to four 
tubes of blood are withdrawn from one of the large veins of the forearm. The total volume of blood drawn is approximately two to three tablespoons (30-45 mL). The following tests will be performed on the blood samples: blood counts, d-dimer, ferritin, kidney and liver function tests, and LDH. 
2. Urine Pregnancy Test: Taking sirolimus while pregnant might cause birth deformities 
or threaten the life of a fetus. If you have the ability to become pregnant, you will have a urine pregnancy test before enrolling in the study. The result of the pregnancy test must be received before you take any study medicine. 
3. Study Medication: You will be given study medication to take at the same time each 
day. It is very important that you take this medication as instructed and do not skip doses or take extra doses. The medication will be given once a day for a maximum of 14 days. If you experience significant side effects, the researchers may ask you to decrease the dose or stop the medication.
In addition to the above tests and procedures, we will collect information regarding your 
demographics and medical history at baseline. We will monitor your medical record on a daily basis to note the following:
1) Your clinical condition2) Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature)3) Oxygenation indices (blood oxygen level and the amount of oxygen you need) 4) Other medications that you are receiving in the hospital 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS OF THE RESEARCH STUDY?
Risks of Sirolimus :
Sirolimus is in a class of medications called immunosuppressants. It works by suppressing the body's immune system. Sirolimus may increase the risk that you will develop an infection or cancer, especially lymphoma (cancer of a part of the immune system) or skin cancer.Approved: 4/13/2020
Do Not Use After: 4/12/2021IRB #: 2020-0337
Page 5 of 13Most of the serious side effects of sirolimus are a concern in patients who use the drug on a 
long-term basis. Because you will only be receiving the study drug for a maximum of 14 days, the risks associated with the study drug may be less likely to occur. Sirolimus may affect your liver and kidney function tests, as well as lead to anemia. We will monitor your blood tests closely to monitor these side effects. 
Common side effects associated with the use of sirolimus
Side Effects The approximate number of people that may 
experience a side effect out of 100 people 
Increased risk of infections 10 - 30Delayed wound healing 20 - 25Lymphoma 1 - 3Headache 20 - 30

Skin rash 10 - 20Acne 20 - 25Mouth ulcers 40 - 50
Blood disorders
Low blood counts 20 - 30High cholesterol 40 - 50
Kidney disorders
Kidney function worsening 30
Risks of Blood Collection : Laboratory tests involve removing blood from a vein with a needle. 
Risks associated with blood draws include soreness, bruising, and in rare instances, an Approved: 4/13/2020

effects from sirolimus and to assess the efficacy of treatment. If any side effects should be noted, the medication may need to be adjusted or stopped.
Information that you share with any of your physicians may become part of your personal 
medical record. It may be available to persons who have legal access to your medical records. Questions about access to your personal medical record should be directed to your personal physician.
There may be unknown or unforeseen risks associated with study participation. If you wish to 
discuss the information above or any other discomforts you may experience, you may ask questions now or call the study doctor listed on the front of this form.
URINE PREGNANCY TEST
If you have the ability to become pregnant, you will have a urine pregnancy test before 
enrolling in the research study. The result of the pregnancy test must be received before you take any medicine. 
WHAT ARE THE REPRODUCTION RISKS?
We will confirm that you are not pregnant with a urine pregnancy test before enrolling you into 
the study. 
Because the drug in this research study can affect an unborn baby, you should not become 
pregnant while on this research study. This includes the 4 weeks following the last day you take study medication. This is very important because there is the possibility that sirolimus could affect the development of a fetus for up to 4 weeks following the last day that you receive the medication. Therefore, even if you are withdrawn or decide not to continue to participate in the study, you will be strongly encouraged to use birth control for 4 weeks following the last time you take the study medication. Acceptable forms of birth control include prior surgical sterilization. Qualifying surgeries include hysterectomy, removal of both ovaries, tubal ligation, and vasectomy in partner(s). You may also use complete abstinence or double barrier methods. Double barrier methods include condom with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, or cervical cap with spermicide. Intrauterine devices (IUD), and progestin-based contraceptives are also acceptable.  
You should not nurse your baby while on this research study and for 4 weeks following the 
last day you receive the study medication. 
You should notify your study doctor immediately if you become pregnant.  We will ask to 
follow the outcome of the pregnancy.  
ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THE RESEARCH STUDY?
If you agree to take part in this research study, there may not be a direct medical benefit to 
you. We hope the information learned from this research study will benefit other patients with COVID-19 and similar viral illnesses in the future.Approved: 4/13/2020

Statistical methods 
 
The i ntent-to-treat  analysis  included all  randomized partici pants. We used R software  (r-project.org) and 
SPSS  version 23 (IBM, A rmonk, NY, USA). Univariate tests compared  groups on baseli ne characteristics. 
Histograms were  inspected for normality. The primary hypot hesis was tested us ing a linear re gression 
model of day  1 SSI (SSIday1) with ba seline SSI (SSIBL) and treatment  as the predictors: SSIday1 ~ SS IBL + 
treatment.  Secondary ana lyses  tested treatment  effect on response and remiss ion. Effect size 
calculatio ns used Cohen’s d and number needed  to treat ( NNT). We used regres sion models analogous 
to that for SSI to test effects on depression, mania, and anxiet y. The POMS was analyzed with  a 
general ized lea st squares  (GLS)  model over its  three  assessment t ime-points. Since at randomization  
only one subject was not taking psyc hiatric medications and  only one subject had baseli ne SSI <8, we did 
not adjust for the randomization  strata.  We tested a  repeated  measu res analysis of covariance 
(ANCOV A) model of SSI, including 230 minute and day 1 assessments,  analyzed response  to the open- 
label ketamine infusion, and tested the  correlation between change in depressive symptoms and  change 
in SSI. We pl otted mean S SI during the 6-week follow-up in those randomized to ketamine and 
performed p aired t tests  of the score each week compared  to baseli ne. We investigated  infusion effects 
on neurocognition and explored relationships of clinical var iables with  CAR,  serum BDNF, and post- 
infusion plasma  ketamine, norketamine and dehyd ronorketamine.31 Saf ety analyses investigated 
dissociat ive, psyc hotomimetic and cardio-respiratory effects.

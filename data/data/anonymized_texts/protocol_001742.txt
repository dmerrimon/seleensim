AMENDMENT RATIONALE AND SUMMARY:  
The protocol was revised to clarify the dose delay and dose modification procedures, to 
remove duplicate information,  add stool specimen collection,  and to revise the registration, data 
management, and single subject/subject exception sections.  
In reference to the dose de lay and dose modification updates, a dverse reaction terms were 
inadvertently removed from the “Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications” section and 
have been added back: Infusion -related reactions; Dermatologic reaction; Pulmonary 
Fibrosis/ILD, Col itis, Pneumonitis, Hypophysitis, Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, Nephritis and Renal 
Dysfunction, Rash, Encephalitis, Other. Also included with the updates  are the following adverse 
reaction terms and their corresponding severity and dose modification action: Ad renal 
Insufficiency, Myocarditis, Infusion Related Reaction, and Uveitis, eye pain, blurred vision.  
Additionally, Baseline Liver Function Tests were inadvertently remo ved from the “Nivolumab 
and/or I pilimumab Dose Modifications/Delays for Liver Toxicity” table and have been added 
back: AST or ALT normal, AST or ALT 1.1 to ≤ 2.5 X ULN (Grade 1), Total Bilirubin normal, 
and Total Bilirubin 1.1 to ≤ 1.5 X ULN (Grade 1).   
The registration, data management , and single subject/subject exception procedures were 
updated to align with current Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center procedures.  In addition, 
pregnancy reporting requirements for female partners of male subjects was added.  
Lastly, stool specimen  collection  was added to identify gut microbial composition at 
baseline and at first restaging.

 1.0 BACKGROUND AND  RATIONALE  
1.1 Study  Synopsis  
We will conduct a single -arm, open -label Phase II clinical trial investigating the 
combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab with panitumumab in subjects with 
unresectable, refractory, KRAS /NRAS /BRAF wild-type, microsatellite stable 
(MSS) metastatic colorect al cancer (mCRC). There will be an initial safety  lead-in 
cohort to ensure the combination is well -tolerated. The primary objective of this 
study is to estimate the overall response rate (CR + PR) in these subjects at 12 
weeks by RECIST 1.1 criteria and al so by irRECIST criteria. Secondary 
objectives include the following: estimating the overall response rate (CR + PR) 
in these subjects at 12 weeks by irRECIST criteria, estimating the best response 
rate by both RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST criteria, estimating P FS and duration of 
response using both RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST criteria, estimating OS, and 
characterizing the safety issues associated with this regimen. Exploratory 
objectives involve investigating various biomarkers and peripheral blood and 
tumor  assays . 
 
This treatment regimen will be of clinical interest if the objective response rate 
increases from the standard of care response rate of 22% with panitumumab alone 
to approximately 35% with combination therapy (adding nivolumab and 
ipilumumab to panitumu mab).  
 
1.2 Colorectal Cancer  Background  
CRC is the second most common cause of cancer mortality in the United States, 
causing an estimated 49,190 deaths in 2016. Mortality is primarily driven by the 
20% of CRC subjects with metastatic disease, who suffer 5 -year overall survival 
of only 12.9% 1.  Subjects with mCRC, have experienced improvements in 
median overall survival (OS), from 14.2 months for those diagnosed in 1990 -1997 
to over 29 months for those diagnosed after 20042. Much of these improvements 
are attr ibutable to development of novel therapies. Previously, only 
fluoropyrimidines were standard options for subjects with CRC, but starting in the 
mid-2000s, increasing numbers of subjects were treated with novel chemotherapy 
agents such as irinotecan, oxalip latin, and novel biologic drugs such as 
bevacizumab and the monoclonal antibodies targeting the epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR); subsequent widespread use of these agents has contributed to 
improvements in survival. Nevertheless, barring surgical r esection of 
oligometastatic disease, inevitably metastatic cancers develop resistance to 
therapies, thus resulting in clinical progression and ultimately death. There is a 
great unmet need to better understand biologic mechanisms of resistance to 
available  therapies and use this knowledge to guide future therapy choices for 
individual subjects with  CRC.  
 
While efforts have been extensive to identify molecular markers to guide 
evidence -based therapy for subjects with CRC, the impact of these efforts thus far  
LCCC 1632

 on the standard of care for CRC has been limited. Microsatellite instability high 
(MSI -H) is a molecular fingerprint of a deficient mismatch repair system that is 
evident in approximately 15% of CRC that has been recognized since the 1990s3. 
The MSI -H phenotype is a unique subset characterized by less aggressive 
behavior and a favorable prognosis compared to microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC, 
at least among subjects with stage II disease4. The prognostic value of MSI -H 
should be evaluated in all stage II CRC subjects regarding chemotherapy as some 
subjects can be spared adjuvant chemotherapy. Evidence for supporting the 
preferential efficacy of irinotecan in MSI -H tumors is continuing to emerge but 
remains inconclusiv e based on disparate results from clinical  trials3,5,6. 
 
Currently, available biomarkers for CRC are limited to identifying subjects for 
whom certain treatment is not suited, rather than identifying those who may 
benefit from treatment7. KRAS and NRAS muta tion status provide a basis for 
subject selection regarding benefit from EGFR targeting antibodies8 as subjects 
with KRAS or NRAS mutations, which are detected in approximately 40% of 
CRCs, do not derive benefit from these treatments. There are no prognost ic or 
predictive molecular markers for bevacizumab -based therapy which is directed 
against the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF -R) pathway; 
moreover, due to the heterogeneous nature of CRC, a number of subjects receive 
little benefit or no  benefit from these targeted agents7. Although unique subtypes 
within CRC have been identified as shown in Table 1 below based on a consensus 
molecular subtyping strategy devised and recently reported by the Colorectal 
Cancer Subtyping Consortium, 9,10 critical questions remain regarding the 
pathogenesis and biology of these tumors, and unfortunately, optimal biomarkers 
for evidence -based therapeutic approaches remain elusive. Key areas of unmet 
need include optimizing use of EGFR antibodies for RAS/RAF wild-type disease 
and improving treatment for subjects with RAS and RAF mutations where no 
proven targeted therapy exists.

1.3 Panitumumab in  CRC  
Panitumumab is indicated for treatment of subjects with KRAS wild-type mCRC 
as monotherapy afte r disease progression after prior treatment with 
fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan containing chemotherapy regimens. 
Panitumumab is a fully human IgG2 antibody that binds the EGFR. The EGFR 
and proteins involved in its downstream signal transdu ction play important roles 
in oncogenesis and tumor progression in CRC. EGFR is a transmembrane 
receptor tyrosine kinase that homodimerizes upon ligand binding to activate 
downstream intracellular signal transduction cascades, notably including the 
mitogen  activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway via RAS, RAF, and MEK, to 
ultimately promote cell proliferation and survival.11 There are three human RAS 
genes that encode homologous proteins, HRAS , NRAS , and KRAS.12 Mutations in 
codons 12 and 13 of KRAS are foun d in 37 -43% of colorectal cancer subjects,13,14 
and contribute to oncogenesis by driving cell proliferation in a growth factor - 
independent fashion.14 Panitumumab, administered at 6 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks, 
significantly improves progression -free survival ( PFS) compared to best 
supportive care when administered to subjects with chemo -refractory mCRC 
whose tumors are wild -type in KRAS codons 12 and 13 (hazard ratio 0.45, 95%  CI 
0.34 to 0.59). After additional studies demonstrated that benefit with anti -EGFR 
therapy was limited to subjects whose tumors are wild -type in exons 2, 3, and 4 of 
KRAS and NRAS , consensus guidelines now recommend that only subjects who 
are wild -type on extended RAS testing receive anti -EGFR therapy15. Additional 
studies have suggested that wild -type BRAF is also required for optimal response 
to anti -EGFR therapy16. Thus, while panitumumab is effective for subjects with 
extended RAS and BRAF wild-type mCR C, the duration of benefit is limited, and 
so improving on panitumumab monotherapy with novel combination therapies is 
needed to extend the duration of benefit.  
 
1.4 Ipilimumab and Nivolumab in  CRC  
Therapy with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies, such as inh ibitory  antibodies 
against cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen -4 (CTLA -4) or programmed cell death -1 
(PD-1) receptors on T cells, relieves tumor immune evasion and allows cytotoxic 
antitumor immune attack. These therapies have been found to yield durable 
diseas e response in several malignancies, including melanoma and non -small -cell 
lung carcinoma, and are undergoing investigation in a variety of other 
malignancies. However, efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy in 
CRC has been limited, with cases of prolonged disease response initially found 
only in the rare subjects with MSI -H disease 11,17 -20. Subsequently, in subjects 
with MSI -H mCRC, nivolumab monotherapy yielded 31% response rate21, and 
nivolumab + ipilimumab yielded 33% response rate 20. Since only 11% of mCRC 
subjects are MSI -H,22 this indicates that immune checkpoint inhibitor 
monotherapy is ineffective in the majority of subjects, who have MSS  mCRC.  
LCCC 1632

 Indeed, in early clinical trials of nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab + 
ipilimumab in subjects with MSS mCRC, there was only 1/20 objective 
responses 20. Thus, investigating combinations of immune checkpoint therapy  
with additional agents to further activate the immune system’s antitumor response 
is necessary in order to improve ou tcomes in the majority of subjects with mCRC 
who have MSS disease.  
 
1.5 Rationale for  LCCC1632  
Monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) targeting the EGFR are commonly used as 
standard of care in the 40 -50% of MSS mCRC subjects with tumors that are wild - 
type in KRAS and NRAS .14 Cetuximab is a chimeric mouse/human IgG1 Mab 
against EGFR, while panitumumab is a fully human IgG2 anti -EGFR Mab.  
Although inhibition of downstream signaling transduction from EGFR is an 
important mechanism of efficacy of these antibody therapies,23 the ineffectiveness 
of small molecule EGFR inhibitors in this setting implies that additional 
mechanisms may explain Mab efficacy. Indeed, Mabs are known to interface with 
the immune system to trigger antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)  or 
facilitate activation of the adaptive immune system. Though the general 
consensus is that IgG2 Mabs like panitumumab do not trigger classical natural 
killer (NK) cell -mediated ADCC,24 panitumumab does recruit myeloid lineage 
cells, like neutrophils and monoc ytes, to perform ADCC and impair tumor 
growth.25 This observation and others noted below support the hypothesis that 
anti-EGFR Mab efficacy is also linked to immune  modulation.  
 
In addition, immune activation does appear to play an important role in the 
efficacy of anti -EGFR Mabs in preclinical models. Novel murine xenograft 
models with reconstituted immune cells demonstrate that cetuximab requires both 
innate and adaptive immunity to cause tumor regression, including causing 
proliferation of tumor antigen -specific CD8+ T cells in draining lymph nodes.26 
Furthermore, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from subjects 
in clinical trials of chemotherapy with cetuximab revealed increases of activated 
Th1 cytotoxic T -cells, central memory cells, an d NK cells.27 Similarly, head and 
neck cancer subjects treated with cetuximab had a significant increase in 
circulating CD8+ T -cells specific to EGFR epitopes.28 The combination of 
cetuximab with cytotoxic chemotherapy increased dendritic cell activation a nd 
phagocytosis29  and increased ADCC.30  However, cetuximab conversely was 
found to also activate immunosuppressive M2 macrophages, causing upregulation 
of PD -L1 and contributing further to immune evasion.31 Indeed, our preliminary 
data based on gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of gene expression 
microarrays from 68 CRC subjects treated with cetuximab indicates that 
cetuximab -resistant subjects tend to have an increase in monocyte/macrophage 
signatures, and  also have a signature reflecting PD1 -ligated T -cells as compared 
to control T cells 32 This suggests that while cetuximab can induce ADCC and 
requires activation of cytotoxic T cells, there is also an immunosuppressive effect 
triggered by cetuximab that m ay ultimately limit its activity. Translational studies 
in subjects treated with panitumumab show similar immunologic effects.  Notably,  
LCCC 1632

UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA

5  
 response to panitumumab in a phase II clinical trial was predicted by a high level 
of CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor FOXP3 expression.33,34 
Furthermore, first -line treatment with panitumumab and chemotherapy yielded 
increases in  all lymphocyte subsets, total dendritic cells, and dendritic cell 
subsets, suggesting an impact on in vivo T -cell mediated responses.35 Thus, we 
hypothesize that the immunosuppressive effect of anti -EGFR Mabs combined 
with chemotherapy may be overcome and the pro -adaptive immune response may 
be potentiated by co -administration with immune checkpoint inhibitors.  
 
In studies of immune checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma36, non -small cell lung 
cancer37, and MSI -H CRC,20 the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab has 
yielded greater response rates and PFS than nivolumab alone. Additionally, 
CTLA4+ regulatory cells may  impair cytotoxicity associated with anti -EGFR 
antibodies in head and neck cancers.38 Thus, administration of the anti -CTLA -4 
antibody ipilimumab may facilitate suppression of the inhibitory regulatory T 
cells and help activate an immune response driven by  enhanced antigen 
presentation via effective therapy with panitumumab, while anti -PD-1 antibody 
nivolumab may allow this nascent T cell response to be more effectively 
unleashed. Given the otherwise poor efficacy of immune checkpoint therapy in 
MSS mCRC, w e propose adding the combination of CTLA -4 inhibition and PD -1 
inhibition, through administration of ipilimumab and nivolumab, to treatment 
with panitumumab.  
 
Though panitumumab and cetuximab have clinically shown comparable 
efficacy,39-44 cetuximab has a greater incidence of infusion -related reactions than 
panitumumab (13% vs 3%), including grade 3 -4 reactions (2% vs <0.5%). These 
hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions triggered by cetuximab infusion are 
particularly relevant in broad swaths of the So utheastern U.S., as grade 3 -4 
reactions during the first infusion of cetuximab reach rates as high as 22% in this 
region.45 These infusion -related reactions are possibly related to geographically 
prevalent IgE antibodies that target an oligosaccharide pres ent on cetuximab but 
not panitumumab.46 There is no cross -reactivity with panitumumab,47 and 
consequently panitumumab is used as the standard of care anti -EGFR mAb rather 
than cetuximab in the Southeastern U.S due to its superior safety profile and 
equival ent efficacy. Given the limited safety data currently available for the 
combination of cetuximab with immune checkpoint inhibitors in a geographic 
region with high rates of grade 3 -4 immunologically -mediated hypersensitivity 
reactions to cetuximab, and the  unclear effects of immunotherapy on these 
anaphylactic reactions, we favor pursuing a clinical trial of nivolumab + 
ipilimumab combined with panitumumab.  
 
Thus, we propose a single -arm, open -label, multicenter Phase II clinical trial 
investigating the com bination of nivolumab and ipilimumab with panitumumab in 
subjects with unresectable refractory KRAS /NRAS /BRAF wild-type MSS mCRC. 
There will be an initial safety lead -in cohort to ensure the combination is well 
tolerated.

 1.6 Correlative  Studies  
We will collect peripheral blood samples serially to facilitate analyses such as 
mutation analysis of circulating free tumor DNA and quantitation of circulating 
cytokines and EGFR ligands including epiregulin and amphiregulin. There is a 
growing body of ev idence that one mechanism of resistance to anti -EGFR Mab 
therapy is the emergence of mutations or amplification in key components of the 
MAPK signaling pathways, including in EGFR , KRAS , and NRAS . 48-51 In 
addition, we have retrospective data indicating th at treatment with anti -EGFR 
Mabs is associated with differential levels of cytokines and growth factors, 
including epiregulin and TRAIL. 52 These different resistance mechanisms, 
especially circulating TRAIL levels, are likely to have consequences on immun e 
activation and response, and the association of each of these markers with RR, 
PFS, and OS will be determined.  
 
We will also plan to perform peripheral blood immune monitoring, such as 
assessment of ADCC and T cell activity, and can consider sequencing p eripheral 
blood mononuclear cells for FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa polymorphisms. There have 
been conflicting studies regarding the prognostic utility of FcγRIIa or FcγRIIIa 
polymorphisms and anti -EGFR Mab efficacy,25,53 -59 though the largest study to 
date showed no significant association in KRAS wild -type subjects with mCRC.60 
Since these factors may affect immune activation, sequencing for polymorphisms 
in FCGR2A and FCGR3A may be informative. Additionally, isolation of T cells 
and NK cells from subject -derived PBMCs to perform ex vivo ADCC assays and 
interferon γ release assays would provide important data on the activation of 
adaptive and innate immune cells.  
 
Additionally, we will include optional serial tumor biopsies to identify potential 
biomarkers for immu ne checkpoint inhibitors and anti -EGFR antibodies. These 
could include integrated genomic analysis with multiplex next generation DNA 
and RNA sequencing for baseline mutation analysis, and gene expression 
analyses. This approach can also facilitate sequenc ing of low -diversity B cell and 
T cell receptors, both at baseline and serially in subjects who opt to undergo serial 
biopsies, which may aid in discovery of future potential targets for intervention.  
 
Finally, we will collec t stool specimens to identify gut microbial composition  at 
baseline and at first restaging . Several studies have shown significant associations 
between gut microbial dysbiosis and lack of efficacy of immune checkpoint 
inhibitors, and we will perform exploratory studies to determine the  association 
between baseline gut microbiome and efficacy of therapy.

 4.1.1 Rationale for Doses Selected  
We plan to perform a single -arm, open -label, multicenter Phase II clinical trial of 
nivolumab 240 mg IV q2wk), ipilimumab (1 mg/kg IV q6wk), and panitumumab 
(6 mg/kg IV q2wk), after a safety lead -in cohort of a total of 6 subjects has 
completed 12 weeks of  combination therapy at the proposed starting doses. The 
starting doses and schedule were carefully selected after consideration of existing 
clinical studies and preclinical data. The efficacy of ipilimumab monotherapy is 
dose-dependent, but the rate and s everity of immune -related adverse events is also 
dose-dependent 61. The FDA -approved dose of combination ipilimumab and 
nivolumab in management of metastatic melanoma is ipilimumab 3 mg/kg IV 
q3wk for four doses combined with nivolumab 1 mg/kg IV q3wk; fol lowed by 
nivolumab monotherapy 240 mg flat dose IV q2wk. Notably, studies of 
combination ipilimumab and nivolumab have started both antibodies 
concurrently, with the rationale that preclinical models showed that the 
combination is synergistic only when adm inistered concurrently rather than 
sequentially62, and so we plan to administer the investigational drugs concurrently 
as well. Subsequent clinical trials have investigated combinations of ipilimumab 
and nivolumab that would attenuate the frequency and sev erity of immune -related 
adverse events without mitigating efficacy. The efficacy and toxicity profiles of 
more infrequent dosing of ipilimumab combined with nivolumab were studied in 
a phase I study in subjects with chemotherapy -naïve recurrent stage IIIB or IV 
NSCLC, CheckMate 012. In this study, treatment with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg q6wk 
combined with nivolumab 3 mg/kg q2wk was much better tolerated than 
treatment with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg q3wk combined with nivolumab 3 mg/kg 
q3wk. Additional dosing combination  regimens tested revealed inferior efficacy 
when nivolumab dosing was decreased to 1 mg/kg. Treatment with ipilimumab 1 
mg/kg q6wk combined with nivolumab 3 mg/kg q2wk resulted in a 33% rate of 
grade 3 -4 treatment -related AEs, but only 13% rate of treatmen t-related AEs 
leading to study drug discontinuation63 (compared to 19% grade 3 -4 treatment - 
related AEs and 10% treatment -related AEs leading to discontinuation in 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV q2wk arm).29 The FDA has determined that based on 
population pharmacoki netics models, there is a negligible difference in overall 
exposure between nivolumab 240 mg IV q2wk and 3 mg/kg IV  q2wk.  
Consequently, we plan the ipilimumab and nivolumab dosing within safety cohort 
1 to be ipilimumab 1 mg/kg IV q6wk plus nivolumab 240 mg IV q2wk. The dose 
of panitumumab selected within dose level 1 is the FDA -approved monotherapy 
dose.  
 
If DLTs occur in no more than one subject in the first 6 subjects treated during  the 
12 week assessment period in the first safety cohort, then the tria l would continue 
enrolling subjects to the remainder of the  first stage of the  phase II portion to 
complete enrollment to 3 2 subjects to assess efficacy of panitumumab, ipilimumab 
and nivolumab (3 -drug combination).  This would then be followed by interim 
analysis to determine whether the second stage would merit enrollment.  If the 3 -
drug combination is not well tolerated, then 6 additional subjects will be enrolled 
into safety cohort 2 and receive panitumumab and nivolumab (2 -drug 
combination) .  If no mor e than one subject experiences a DLT in safety cohort 2, 
then the trial will continue  enrolling  subjects  into the phase II portion and the 2 -

 drug combination of panitumumab and nivolumab will be evaluated for efficacy. 
Subjects may c ontinue combination treatment as long as they are benefitting from 
therapy until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal for other 
reasons as deemed necessary by the investigator.  
 
DLT definitions applicable to the safety assessment run -in are defined in section  
4.2. Subjects will undergo disease evaluation every 6 weeks for the first year, and 
will continue on this disease assessment schedule if they are at least stable but 
have less than a CR. If subjects co ntinue on study after one year with a CR, then 
disease evaluations may occur every 12 weeks from that point forward.  
 
4.2 Dose Limiting Toxicities for Safety  Lead -in 
The safety lead -in DLT assessment period is defined as the first 12 weeks (84 
days) of ipilimu mab/nivolumab/panitumumab therapy. An event will be 
considered a DLT if it occurs within the first 84 days of combination therapy and 
meets one of the following criteria.  
 
 Grade 4 neutropenia lasting ≥ 5  days 
 Febrile  neutropenia  
 Grade 4  thrombocytopenia  
 Grade 4  anemia  
 Grade 2 drug -related uveitis that does not respond to topical therapy and 
does not improve to Grade 1 severity within 6 weeks OR requires  systemic 
treatment  
 Grade 3 drug -related  uveitis  
 Grade 3 -4 pneumonitis  
 Grade 3 -4 bronchospasm  
 Grade 3 -4 diarrhea  
 Grade 3 -4 colitis  
 Grade 3 -4 neurologic adverse  event  
 Grade 3 -4 adrenal  insufficiency  
 Grade 3 -4 hypersensitivity  reaction  
 Grade 3 -4 infusion reaction of any  duration  
 Grade 3 non -skin, drug -related non -hematologic toxicity per NCI -CTCAE 
criteria 4.0 3 lasting over 7  days 
 Grade 4 non -hematologic toxicity per NCI -CTCAE criteria 4.03

If the 3 -drug combination is not tolerated in Cohort 1, then ipilimumab will be omitted 
and panitumumab in combination with nivolumab will be evaluated for safety. If no 
more than 1 subject out of 6 experiences DLTs after 12 weeks on therapy, then  
additional subjects will be enrolled to evaluate the safety and efficacy of panitumumab 
and nivolumab (2 -drug combination). If neither the 3 -drug or 2 -drug combination is 
well-tolerated, the dosing approach for these agents will be reconsidered.

weeks,  permanently discontinue nivolumab +/ - ipilimumab  
* For additional management, including monitoring and use of corticosteroids or additional 
immunosuppressant therapies, recommend using guidelines for management of 
immunotherapy related toxicities, primarily the NCCN Management of Immunotherapy -
Related Toxicities Version 1.2020. Section 11.2 has algorithms for possible management 
of selected to xicities, but management does not have to follow direction of Section 11.2.  
 
 
4.4.2.2  Dose Delay Criteria for  Nivolumab  +/- Ipilimumab  
Because of the potential for clinically meaningful nivolumab -related AEs requiring 
early recognition and prompt intervention, management algorithms have been 
developed for suspected AEs of selected categories [see current Investigator 
Brochure and Appendix  11.2].  Hepatotoxicity guidelines are provided in the section 
above.  
 
Dose delay criteria apply for all drug -related adverse events  related to nivolumab 
and/or ipilimumab  (regardless of whether or  not the event is attributed  to nivolumab , 
ipilimumab, or both ). If both nivolumab and ipilimumab are being administered, both 
must  be delayed until treatment can resume.  
 
Nivolumab  +/- ipilimumab  administration should be delayed per the criteria in 4.4.2 
and 4.4.2.1.  
 
 
Additionally , nivolumab +/- ipilimu mab should be held in the event of a ny AE, 
laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the 
investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication.  
LCCC 1632  
PI: Autumn McRee , MD CONFIDENTIAL 
UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
October 01, , 
2020  
20  
  
Subjects who require delay of nivolumab +/ - ipilimumab should be re -evaluated 
weekly or more frequently if clinically indicated and resume nivolumab +/ - 
ipilimumab dosing when re -treatment criteria are met . 
 
4.4.2.3  Criteria to Resume Nivolumab  +/- Ipilimumab  Treatment  
Subjects may resume treatment with study drug when the drug -related AE(s) resolve to 
Grade ≤1 or baseline value, with the following exceptions:  
• Subjects may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2  fatigue  
• Subjects who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug -related skin AE may resume 
treatment in  the presence of Grade 2 skin  toxicity  
• Subjects with baseline Grade 1 AST/ALT or total bilirubin who require dose 
delays for reasons other than a 2 -grade shift in AST/ALT or total bilirubin may 
resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 AST/ALT OR total  bilirubin  
• Drug -related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis, must have resolved to 
baseline before treatment is resumed. Subjects with persistent Grade 1 
pneumonitis after completion of a steroid taper over at least 1 month may  be 
eligible for retreatm ent if investigator  allows.  
• Subjects with drug -related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only 
physiologic hormone replacement may resume treatment if the investigator allows 
it, but this should be documented clearly in the electronic case report form 
(eCRF).  
 
4.4.2.3.1  Guidance on Cycle Counting  after Treatment Delay  
If the criteria to resume treatment are met, and treatment was delayed for up to one week (≤ 7 
days), make up the missed treatment visit. If treatment was delayed for 8 -42 days, skip the 
missed treatment(s) and resume treatment at the next relevant cycle/day treatment visit, unless 
the subject is ≥ 42 days from the last dose of ipilimumab, in which case resume treatment at day 
1 of the next treatment cycle.  
 
If treatment is delayed or interrupted for > 6 weeks  due to toxicity, adverse effect, or medical 
comorbidity , the subject must be permanently discontinued from study therapy, except as 
specified in the discontinuation section  4.4.2.5 . 
 
4.4.2.4  Mana gement Algorithms for  Immune -related Events for Nivolumab  +/- 
Ipilimumab  
Guidelines for the management of immune -related events can be found in the current 
Nivolumab Investigator Brochure AND in the approved USPI in the US.  
 
Immuno -oncology (I -O) agents are associated with AEs that can differ in severity and 
duration than AEs caused by other therapeutic classes. Nivolumab is considered an  
I-O agent in this protocol. Early recognition and management of AEs associated with 
immuno -oncology agents may mitigat e severe toxicity. Management algorithms have 
been developed to assist investigators in assessing and managing the following groups of 
AEs:  
 
For mandatory guidance on dosing of nivolumab and/or ipilimumab  with 
specified immune related adverse events , please refer to section 4.4.2  and

 section 4.4.2.1.  For additional management, including monitoring and use of 
corticosteroids or additional immunosuppressant therapies, recommend using 
guidelines for management of immunotherapy related toxicities, primarily the 
NCCN Management of Immunotherapy -Related Toxicities Version 1.2020. 
Section 11.2 has algorithms for possible  further  management of selected 
toxicities, but management does not have to follow direction of Section 11.2.  
Instead, these algorithms are only an additional resource to complement  other 
guidelines and the Investigator’s medical judgment.  
 
4.4.2.5  Discontinuation Criteria for  Nivolumab  and/or ipilimumab  
Treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab should be permanently discontinued for the 
following:   
• Any Grade 2 drug -related uveitis or eye pain or blurred vision that does not 
respond to topical therapy and does not improve to Grade 1 severi ty within the re - 
treatment period OR requires systemic  treatment  
• Any Grade 3 non -skin, drug -related adverse event lasting > 7 days, with the 
following exceptions for drug -related laboratory abnormalities, uveitis, 
pneumonitis, bronchospasm, hypersensitivi ty reactions, and infusion  reactions, 
and endocrinopathies:  
o Grade 3 drug -related uveitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm,  hypersensitivity 
reaction, or infusion reaction of any duration requires  discontinuation  
o Grade 3 drug -related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only 
physiologic hormone replacement do not require  discontinuation  
o Grade 3 drug -related laboratory abnormalities do not require  treatment 
discontinuation except those noted  below  
• Grade 3 drug -related thrombocytopenia > 7 days or associated  with bleeding 
requires  discontinuation  
• Any drug -related liver function test (LFT) abnormality that meets the  following 
criteria requires  discontinuation:  
o If baseline AST or ALT is within normal limits, AST or ALT > 5 x  ULN  
o If baseline AST or ALT is Grade 1, AST or ALT > 8 x  ULN  
LCCC 1632  
PI: Autumn McRee , MD CONFIDENTIAL 
UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA

22  
 o If baseline total bilirubin is within normal limits, total bilirubin > 3x  ULN  
o If baseline total bilirubin is Grade 1, total bilirubin > 5 x  ULN  
 
• Any Grade 4 drug -related adverse event or laboratory abnormality, except for the 
following events which do not require  discontinuation:  
o Isolated Grade 4 amylase or lipase abnormalities that are not associated with 
symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis and decrease to < Grade  4 
within 1 week of  onset.  
o Isolated Grade 4 electrolyte imbalances/abnormalities that are not associated 
with clinical sequelae and are corrected with supplementation/appropriate 
management within 72 hours of their  onset  
o Grade 4 lymphopenia or  leucopenia  
o Grade 4 drug -related endocrinopathy a dverse events, such as adrenal 
insufficiency, ACTH deficiency, hyper - or hypothyroidism, or glucose 
intolerance, which resolve or are adequately controlled with  physiologic 
hormone replacement (corticosteroids, thyroid hormones) or glucose - 
controlling age nts, respectively, may not require discontinuation after 
discussion with and approval from the  Investigator  
• Any dosing interruption lasting > 6 weeks with the following  exceptions:  
o Dosing delays or interruptions to allow for prolonged steroid tapers to  manage 
drug-related adverse events are allowed. Prior to re -initiating treatment in a 
subject with a dosing interruption lasting > 6 weeks, the Investigator must be 
consulted. Tumor assessments should continue as per protocol even if dosing 
is interrupted or delayed  
o Dosing interruptions or delays lasting > 6 weeks that occur for non -drug- 
related reasons may be allowed if approved by the Investigator. Prior to re - 
initiating treatment in a subject with a dosing interruption lasting > 6 weeks, 
the Investigat or must be consulted. Tumor assessments should continue as per 
protocol even if dosing is  interrupted  
• Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which,  in the 
judgment of the Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the  subject 
with continued nivolumab  and ipilimumab  dosing  
 
Additionally, after any immune related adverse event  that does not meet the mandatory 
discontinuation requirement , the treating investigator should carefully consider the safety of 
resum ing nivolumab and/or ipilimumab.  In select cases, like for colitis, it would be appropriate to 
discontinue ipilimumab but continue nivolumab. This should be discussed with the medical monitor, 
and decisions should use guidelines for rechallenge after immu ne-related adverse events, such as 
found in the NCCN Management of Immunotherapy -Related Toxicities Version 1.2020.

 4.5 Concomitant  Medications/Treatments  
Subjects on the trial are allowed to receive all supportive care therapy needed to 
alleviate symptoms rel ated to CRC or other medical problems at the investigator’s 
discretion. No treatments should be withheld due to a subject’s participation in 
this study. Prophylaxis for infusion -related reactions should be employed per 
institutional guidelines.  
 
Infusion -related reactions (including anaphylaxis) may occur during the infusion 
of nivolumab. Infusion -related reactions are also associated with panitumumab 
treatment , but no prophylaxis measures are suggested. The infusion of nivolumab 
(and panitumumab)  should be administered at a site properly equipped and staffed 
to manage anaphylaxis should it occur. Monitor subjects during infusion. If 
anaphylaxis occurs immediately and permanently discontinue administration of 
the study medication and administer app ropriate medical therapy per institutional 
standards. If a mild or moderate infusion -related reaction occurs, the infusion 
should be interrupted , or the rate of infusion slowed , and appropriate medical 
management instituted. Subjects who experienced a prio r infusion -related reaction 
to nivolumab should be pre -medicated for subsequent infusions per institutional 
standards. Premedication may include acetaminophen, an antihistamine and a 
corticosteroid.  
 
Brief (up to 7 days) and episodic use of systemic cortic osteroids for other general 
conditions (e.g. pre -medication for radiographic imaging due to IV contrast 
allergy, COPD exacerbation, poison ivy, etc.) is allowed.  
 
4.5.1 Prophylaxis for acneiform skin rash related to panitumumab  therapy  
Subjects receiving panitumumab should receive prophylactic management for 
EGFR -I associated skin toxicity in accordance with the strategies employed in the 
STEPP and J -STEPP randomized clinical trials. Subjects should be educated 
thoroughly on avoiding sun  exposure as able. If sun avoidance is not possible, 
subjects should be advised to wear a hat with brim and to cover extremities with 
non-restrictive UV protectant clothing.  
 
All subjects should be prescribed prophylactic oral tetracycline antibiotic 
(Doxy cycline 100mg PO BID or  Minocycline 100mg PO  Daily) . 
 
Additionally, the following measures are suggested for rash 
prophylaxis/management:  
 
1. Skin moisturizer applied to face, hands, feet, neck, back and chest both in the 
morning on rising and evening  (bedtim e) 
2. Sunscreen (PABA Free, UVA and UVB protectant, SPF 25 or  higher) 
applied to potentially sun -expo sed areas before going  outdoors.  
3. Topical steroids (0.5% Hydrocortisone Cream) applied to face, hands,  feet, 
neck, back and chest both in the morning on rising and evening  (bedtime)  
LCCC 1632  
PI: Autumn McRee , MD CONFIDENTIAL 
UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA

24  
 Prophylactic management with the above regimen was continued for 8 weeks in 
the STEPP and J -STEPP studies (or until the development to intolerance to a 
component of the prophylactic regimen). Treatment with the above regimen can 
be continued for the duration of panitumumab -containing therapy at the discretion 
of the treating physician.  
 
While skin toxicity management is employed pre -emptively per the J -STEPP 
regimen described above, emergent skin toxicity may sti ll occur. Additional 
measures for the alleviation of emergent skin toxicity grade 2 or higher will be at 
the discretion of the treating physician. Treatment strategies/agents selected may 
include higher -potency topical steroids, oral steroids, and addition al topical or 
systemic antibiotics. Grade 3 rash is considered to be at the panitumumab 
treatment threshold, and panitumumab dose reduction or delay are implemented 
also at the discretion of the treating physician. Dermatology consultation is 
recommended f or subjects being considered for dose reduction or cessation due to 
skin toxicity. Referral to dermatologist should also be recommended for grade 3 
or 4 toxicity, skin toxicity that is difficult to manage employing the measures 
above or does not improve wi thin 1 -2 weeks, and any skin toxicity that is severely 
symptomatic or has an uncharacteristic appearance or  distribution.  
 
4.5.2 Treatment of Therapy -Related Infusion  Reactions  
Since nivolumab contains only human immunoglobulin protein sequences, it is 
unlikely to be immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensitivity reactions. 
Panitumumab caused grade 3 -4 infusion reactions in <0.5% of subjects44. 
However, if such a reaction were to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, 
rigors, headache, rash, pruritus, arthralgias, hypo - or hypertension, bronchospasm, 
or other symptoms of allergic -like reactions.  
 
All Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions should be reported as an SAE if criteria are 
met. Infusion reactions should be graded according to NCI CTCAEv4.03 
guideline s. 
 
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on 
local treatment standards and guidelines as appropriate:  
 
For Grade 1 symptoms during panitumumab infusion : (Mild reaction; 
infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not indicated). Remain at bedside 
and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. The following prophylactic 
premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and 325 to 1000 mg acetaminophen at least 30 minutes befor e 
additional therapeutic antibody administrations. Decrease the infusion rate of 
panitumumab to 50% of the original infusion rate.  
 
For Grade 1 symptoms during nivolumab infusion : (Mild reaction; infusion 
interruption not indicated; intervention not indicated). Remain at bedside and

 monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. The following prophylactic 
premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and 325 to 1000 mg acetaminophen at least 30  minutes before 
additional nivolumab administrations.  
 
For Grade 2 symptoms during panitumumab infusion : (Moderate reaction 
requires therapy or infusion interruption but responds promptly to symptomatic 
treatment [eg, antihistamines, non -steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs, narcotics, 
corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophylactic medications indicated 
for 24 hours).  
 
Stop the panitumumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat 
the subject with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equi valent) and 325 to 1000 mg 
acetaminophen; remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of 
symptoms. Corticosteroid or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as 
appropriate. If the infusion is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50%  of the 
original infusion rate when symptoms resolve. Monitor subject closely. If 
symptoms recur , then no further panitumumab will be administered at that visit. 
Administer diphenhydramine 50 mg IV  and remain at bedside and monitor the 
subject until resol ution of symptoms. The amount of study drug infused must be 
recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF). The following prophylactic 
premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and 325 to 1000 mg acetami nophen should be administered at 
least 30 minutes before additional NVB administrations. If necessary, 
corticosteroids (recommended dose: up to 25 mg of IV hydrocortisone or 
equivalent) may be used.  
 
For Grade 2 symptoms during nivolumab infusion : (Moderat e reaction 
requires therapy or infusion interruption but responds promptly to symptomatic 
treatment [eg, antihistamines, non -steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs, narcotics, 
corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophylactic medications indicated 
for 24 hours).  
 
Stop the nivolumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the 
subject with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and 325 to 1000 mg 
acetaminophen; remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of 
symptoms. Corti costeroid or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as 
appropriate. If the infusion is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50% of the 
original infusion rate when symptoms resolve; if no further complications ensue 
after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of the original infusion rate. 
Monitor subject closely. If symptoms recur , then no further nivolumab will be 
administered at that visit. Administer diphenhydramine 50 mg IV  and remain at 
bedside and monitor the subject until resol ution of symptoms. The amount of 
study drug infused must be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF). 
The following prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions:

 should be administered at least 30 minutes before additional NVB 
administrations. If necessary, corticosteroids (recommended dose: up to 25 mg of 
IV hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used.  
 
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms of panit umumab or nivolumab : (Severe 
reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [ie, not rapidly responsive to symptomatic 
medication and/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of symptoms 
following initial improvement; hospitalization indicated for other clinical seque lae 
[eg, renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]). Grade 4: (life threatening; pressor 
or ventilatory support indicated).  
 
Immediately discontinue infusion of the therapeutic antibody. Begin an IV 
infusion of normal saline  and treat the subject as follows. Recommend 
bronchodilators, epinephrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1,000 solution for subcutaneous 
administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution injected slowly for IV 
administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with  methylprednisolone 100 
mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subject should be monitored until the 
investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. The offending 
therapeutic antibody will be permanently discontinued. Investigators should 
follow t heir institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at 
bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms.  
 
In the case of late -occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (eg, appearance of a 
localized or generalized pruritus within 1 wee k after treatment), symptomatic 
treatment may be given (eg, oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids).  
 
4.5.3 Special warnings and  precautions  
 Nivolumab and ipil imumab are associated with immune -related AEs. 
Subjects should be monitored continuously (at least up to 5 months after the 
last dose) as an AE with nivolumab/ipilimumab may occur at any time during 
or after discontinuation of  therapy.  
 
 For suspected immune -related reactions, adequate evaluation should be 
performed to confirm etiology or exclude other caus es. Based on the 
severity of the adverse reaction, nivolumab/ipilimumab should be withheld 
and corticosteroids administered. If immunosuppression with corticosteroids 
is used to treat an AE, a taper of at least 1 -month duration should be 
initiated upon im provement. Rapid tapering may lead to worsening of the 
AE. Non -corticosteroid immunosuppressive therapy should be added if 
there is worsening or no improvement despite corticosteroid  use. 
 
4.6 Duration of  Therapy  
Subjects should continue protocol therapy as de scribed until:  
• Disease progression (Note: treatment should continue until progression is 
confirmed by repeat scan approximately 6 weeks later to rule out 
pseudoprogression based on investigator  discretion)  
• Inter -current illness prevents further administration of  treatment  
• Unacceptable adverse  event(s)  
LCCC 1632  
PI: Autumn McRee , MD CONFIDENTIAL 
UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
October 01, , 
2020  
27  
 • Subject decides to withdraw from the study,  OR 
• General or specific changes in the subject’s condition render the subjects 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the  investigator.  
 
4.7 Duration of Follow  Up 
Subjects will be followed for up to 3 years after removal from study treatment for 
determination of OS. Subjects removed from study treatment for unacceptable 
AEs will be followed for resolution or stabilization of the adverse event(s). All 
subjects (including those withdrawn for AEs) should be followed after removal 
from study treatment as stipulated in the protocol.  
 
4.8 Removal of Subjects from Protocol  Therapy  
Subjects will be removed from protocol therapy and the PI not ified when any of 
the criteria listed in section 4.6 apply. The reason for discontinuation of protocol 
therapy will be documented on the eCRF.  
 
In case a subject decides to prematurely discontinue protocol therapy (“refuses 
treatment”), the subject should be asked if she or he may still be contacted for 
further scheduled study assessments. The outcome of that discussion should be 
documented in both the medical records and in the eCRF.  
 
Excessive subject withdrawals from protoc ol therapy or from the study can render 
the study un -interpretable; therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of subjects should 
be avoided.  
 
4.9 Study  Withdrawal  
If a subject decides to withdraw from the study (and not just from protocol 
therapy) an effort should be made to complete and report study assessments as 
thoroughly as possible. At the time of withdrawal, the investigator should attempt 
to establish as completely as possible the reason for the study withdrawal.  
 The subject should be asked if they are willing to allow for the abstraction 
of relevant information from their medical record in order to meet the  long 
term follow up (e.g., survival) objectives outlined in the  protocol.  
 A complete final evaluation at the time of the subject’s study withdrawal 
should be obtained with an explanation of why the subject is withdrawing 
from the  study.  
 If the subject is noncompliant and does not return for an end of study 
follow up assessment, this should be documented in the  eCRF.  
 If the reason for removal of a subject fro m the study is an adverse  event, 
the principal specific event will be recorded on the  eCRF.

 1. Radiological assessments and physical exam may be performed within 4 weeks prior to 
day 1 of treatment.  Other evaluations except for pregnancy test must be performed 
within 3 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) of treatment. Serum or urine β -HCG  must 
be performed within 24 hours prior to first dose of study medication for women  of 
child -bearing potential. Other screening labs performed within 72 hours prior to Cycle 1 
Day 1 do not need to be repeated on C1D1.  
 
2. Treatment cycles are to be repeated every 42 d ays until progression. A window of +/ - 3 
days applies to all study visits unless otherwise  specified.  While the treatment window 
is +/- 3 days, a minimum of 12 days must pass before the next dose of nivolumab.  
 
3. The end of treatment visit should only occur when subjects permanently stop study 
treatment. Subjects who have an ongoing ≥grade 2 or serious AE (SAE) at this visit will 
continue to be followed until the event is resolved or deemed irreversible by the 
investigator.   The 30 -day (+/ - 7 days) follow up  visit after stopping study treatment 
should be performed to check for ongoing toxicity. Subsequently, subjects should be 
contacted by telephone at approximately 100 days (+/ - 7 days) after discontinuing study 
treatment for the emergence of SAEs (including  checking for pregnancy) and to ensure 
contraceptive guidelines are followed as stipulated in inclusion criteria 3.1.11 and 3.1.12. 
Subsequent long -term follow -up for survival, defined as every 90 days thereafter (+/ - 15 
days) for up to 3 years or until d eath (whichever is first) may be conducted via telephone 
or chart review and/or clinic visit. Long term survival follow up will be limited to history 
of any subsequent cancer treatments, an assessment of any SAEs (including checking for 
pregnancy) consider ed to be possibly or probably related to study treatment until 
resolution, and survival  status.  
 
4. Complete history at baseline only, thereafter focused history on symptoms/toxicity; 
physical exam to include height (baseline only), examination of the skin, w eight, and 
vital signs. Note that starting with cycle 7, only include assessment by physician on  days 
15 and 29 if clinical signs and symptoms warrant MD  consult  
 
5. Tumor imaging should remain consistent throughout study  and should include those 
thought by investigator to best capture status of disease. Disease assessments should 
include contrasted computed tomography (CT) of the chest and either contrasted CT of 
abdomen and pelvis or MRI of abdomen and pelvis. Repeat tumor imaging every 12 
weeks (+/ - 1 week ). 
 
6. Urine or serum β -HCG must be performed within 24 hours prior to first dose of study 
medication for women of child -bearing potential. The test result must be confirmed as 
negative prior to dosing with study medication. A serum or urine pregnancy test must be 
repeated every 6 weeks while receiving study medications and repeated approximately 30 
days after discontinuing the study  medications.  
 
7. Hematolog y: CBC with differential including Hgb, and platelet count. Serum chemistries 
will include a complete m etabolic panel (ie, BUN, creatinine, sodium (Na), potassium 
(K), Chloride (Cl), Bicarbonate (CO 2), glucose, calcium (Ca), albumin, total protein, total 
bilirubin, ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase) + magnesium (Mg) and  phosphorus.  
 
8. Thyroid function test : TSH and free T3/T4 should be assessed prior to initiating study 
treatment and performed every 6 weeks +/ - 3 days during study treatment and at the end 
of treatment. ACTH, amylase and lipase should be measured at baseline (pre -study)  and

 then on D1 of each cycle. CEA should be measured pre -study and then on D1 of each 
cycle.  
 
9. Please note all subjects should receive prophylaxis for panitumumab -associated rash with 
a tetracycline antibiotic (like doxycycline or minocycline)  and continue for at least the 
duration of the first cycle of study combination treatment (i.e., 6 weeks), a s described in 
section  4.5.1  
 
10. Ipilimumab dosing will be halted and will not be given if the triple combination is 
determined to be unsafe during the safety run -in period (Cohort 1). If this is the case then 
subjects will be dosed with panitumumab and nivolumab in (Cohort 2) as described in 
section  4.3.2  
 
11. Fixed paraffin -embedded blocks or slides from the original diagnostic specimen or from a 
metastatic or recurrent site must be requested for sub jects at baseline. Subjects with 
inadequate archival specimens must undergo a mandatory biopsy prior to initiating study 
medications.  
 
12. Blood samples will be collected for correlative studies on D1 of each cycle prior to 
dosing, and at the end of treatment  visit.  
 
13. Stool s pecimen  should be collected +/ - 7 days from C3D1.  
 
14. We will collect fresh on -treatment biopsies (optional) in consenting patients for 
correlative studies in up to 15 patients. The on -treatment biopsy will be performed during 
cycle 1 on or bet ween days 28 and 35.  
 
6.2 Pre-Study  Assessments  
Pre-study evaluations are to be conducted within 3 weeks prior to start of protocol 
therapy.  Scans for tumor evaluation must be done within 4 weeks prior to the 
start of therapy.  Pre -study assessments  include:

as every 90 days thereafter (+/ - 15 days) for up to 3 years or until death 
(whichever is fir st) and may be conducted via telephone, medical record check, 
and/or via clinic visit. These visits will be limited to history of any subsequent 
cancer treatments, an assessment of any SAE’s considered to be possibly or 
probably related to study treatment until resolution, and survival status.  
 
6.5 Correlative Studies  Procedures  
Blood samples will be collected for correlative studies on D1 of each cycle and at 
the end of treatment visit. Collection details will be provided in the study 
laboratory manual.  
 
Stool  specimens will be collected during screening and on approximately Cycle 3 
Day 1 (see 6.1 for details on timing of collection). Collection details will be 
provided in the study laboratory manual.  
 
Handling of Biospecimens Collected for Correlative Research  
Biospecimens collected for this study will be stored in the Lineberger 
Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) Tissue Procurement Facility (TPF), or if 
needed, in a secure off -site storage facility. All biospecimen samples will be 
obtained in accordance with p rocedures outlined in the LCCC 1632 Study 
Laboratory Manual and stored in containers with controlled access. Each sample 
will be assigned a unique code number and no identifiable personal health 
information (PHI) will be on the specimen label. Information about the subject’s 
disease will be linked to the specimens stored in the repository database. TPF - 
associated research staff, LCCC Bioinformatics staff who support the TPF 
database and the LCCC Data Warehouse, and researchers with IRB -approval for 
access to PHI for each subject in this study will be able to link specimens to 
relevant medical information. Some results from laboratory analyses that occurred 
during the subject’s participation in the clinical study may also be included. This 
information may be  important for understanding how the subject’s cancer 
developed and responded to treatment.  
 
All the planned correlative research studies will be performed by laboratories 
affiliated with UNC -Chapel Hill (for additional details please consult the 
laborator y manual).  
 
Storage Time:  
The biospecimen will be used first and foremost for research purposes 
outlined within the confines of this protocol. Samples will be 
discarded/destroyed after relevant data are collected for this study,

 unless consent was obtained  from the subject to use tissue for other 
research purposes (e.g., TPF consent form was signed by the subject).  
In this circumstance, there is no time limit on how long biospecimens 
may be stored.  
o  The investigator must agree to abide by policies and procedures of the 
TPF facility and sign a letter of research agreement for ethical and 
appropriate conduct of their research that utilizes specimens obtained from 
the TPF facility (e.g., Use of leftover specimens will require a protocol 
outlin ing the research plan for biospecimen use).  
 
Compliance Statement  
Biospecimen collection for this study will be conducted in full accordance to all 
applicable University of North Carolina (UNC) Research Policies and Procedures 
and all applicable Federal an d state laws and regulations including 45 CFR 46, 
and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy 
Rule. Any episode of noncompliance will be documented.  
 
The investigators will perform the study in accordance with this protocol,  will 
obtain consent and assent (unless a waiver is granted), and will report unexpected 
problems in accordance with The UNC IRB Policies and Procedures and all 
federal requirements. Collection, recording, and reporting of data will be accurate 
and will en sure the privacy, health, and welfare of research subjects during and 
after the study.  
 
6.6 Assessment of  Safety  
Any subject who receives at least one dose of study therapy on this protocol will 
be evaluable for toxicity. Each subject will be assessed periodically for the 
development of any toxicity according to the Time and Events table. Toxicity 
will be assessed according to the NCI CTCAEv4.03.  
 
6.7 Assessment of  Efficacy  
Efficacy will be assessed per RECIST 1.1 Criteria in the next section and by 
irRECIS T as described in Section 6.7.5.1 . 
 
6.7.1 Assessment of Disease -Tumor Measurement Based on RECIST  1.1 
See the international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee, version 1.1 (Eur J Cancer 45;2009:228 -247) 
for additional details on RECIST1.1.  
 
Measurable disease will be defined as the presence of at least one measurable 
lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with the longest 
diameter a minimum size of:  
 >10mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5  mm)  
 10mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions which cannot  be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non - 
measurable).  
 20 mm by chest  x-ray. 
LCCC 1632

For malignant lymph nodes to be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥15mm in short axis when assessed by CT 
scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5mm). At 
baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will b e measured and followed.  
 
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis) as well as truly non - 
measurable lesions, will be considered non -measurable. Lesions considered truly 
non-measurable include: leptomeningeal disease; ascites; pleural/pericardial 
effusion; inflammatory breast disease; lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, 
abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is 
not measurable by reprod ucible imaging techniques.  
 
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if 
clinically assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as 
possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the begin ning 
of the treatment. The same method of assessment and the same technique should 
be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during 
follow -up. Imaging based evaluation should always be done rather than clinical 
examination  unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are 
assessable by clinical exam. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable 
when they are superficial and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. 
skin nodules). For the case of ski n lesions, documentation by color photography 
including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesions is recommended.  
 
6.7.2 Baseline Documentation of Target and Non -Target  Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of 
two les ions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified 
as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline.  
 
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longer 
diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be  those 
that lend themselves to reproducible repeated  measurements.  
 
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal 
lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported  as the baseline sum 
diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, only the short axis is 
added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to 
further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension o f 
the disease.  
 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should 
be identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  
Measurements are not required , and these lesions should be followed as 
“present” or “absent”, or in rare cases “unequivocal progression”.

 6.7.3 Evaluation of Target Lesions using RECIST 1.1  Criteria  
NOTE: In addition to the information below, also see section 4.3.2 in the 
international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (RECIST) Committee, version 1.1 (Eur J Cancer 45;2009:228 -247) for 
special notes on the assessment of target lesions.  
 
Complete response (CR)− Disappearance of all target le sions. Any pathological 
lymph node (LN) (whether target or non -target) must have decreased in short axis 
to <10mm.  
 
Partial response (PR) −At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of the target 
lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD.  
 
Progressi ve Disease (PD )−At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of the 
target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the 
treatment started including baseline if that is the smallest on study. In addition to 
the relative increase of 20% , the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase 
of at least 5mm.  The appearance of one or more new lesions also constitutes PD.  
 
Stable disease (SD)− Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD taking as re ferences the smallest sum LD since the 
treatment started.  
 
6.7.4 Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions using RECIST 1.1  Criteria  
Complete response (CR)− Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker levels. All LN must be non -pathological i n size 
(<10mm short axis).  
 
Non-complete response (non -CR)/non -progression (non -PD)−Persistence of one 
or more non -target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above  the 
normal  limits.  
 
Progressive disease (PD) −Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions.  
 
NOTE: Any progressive disease as defined by RECIST1.1 in subjects that are 
asymptomatic without signs or symptoms of impending visceral crisis SHOULD 
be confirmed by repeat scan to rul e out "tumor flare" (pseudoprogression) related 
to immune response. In these subjects and per MD discretion, study therapy 
should be continued in these subjects until the repeat scan is performed 
approximately 4 weeks but no more than 6 weeks later. If PD is confirmed, 
subjects will be withdrawn from study. If tumor flare confirmed, subjects may 
continue therapy as per protocol. Subjects that have clear progressive disease as 
defined by RECIST 1.1 should be withdrawn from treatment and a repeat scan is 
not necessary.

 6.7.4.1  Evaluation of Best Overall Response - The best overall responses  for both 
RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST are defined as the best response achieved across all 
time points prior to progression (for example, a subject who has SD at f irst 
assessment, PR at second assessment, and PD on last assessment has a best  overall 
response of PR). Please Note: In the case of SD, measurements must have met the 
SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 12 weeks from 
initia tion of  treatment.  
 
The best overall response will be defined according to the following table:  
 
Overall 
Response First 
Time Point  Overall Response 
Subsequent Time 
Point  BEST Overall Response  
CR CR CR 
CR PR SD, PD, or PR1 
CR SD SD provided minimum criteria for SD duration met, otherwise, PD

PR PR PR 
PR SD SD 
PR PD SD provided minimum criteria for SD duration met, otherwise, PD  
PR NE2 SD provided minimum criteria for SD duration met, otherwise, 
NE2 
NE NE2 NE2 
1 If a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria relative  to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best 
response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed 
when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were l ikely still present and in fact the subject had PR, not CR at the 
first time point.  Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.

6.7.5  Other Efficacy Parameters (Immune Response  Criter ia) 
 
6.7.5.1  Evaluation of Response by  irRECIST  
Secondary objectives of this study involve  assessment of ORR and PFS based in 
immune response criteria as outlined below (see Guidelines for the evaluation of 
immune therapy activity in solid tumors: immune -related response criteria.  
Wolchok JD et al. Clin Cancer Res 2009;15(23):7412 -20, Nishino e t al. Clin 
Cancer Res 19(14):3936 -43, and Bohnsack O. et al., Adaptation of the immune 
related response criteria: irRECIST. Annals of Oncology (2014) 25 (suppl_4): 
iv361 -iv372. 10.1093/annonc/mdu342, 2014).  
 
irRECIST criteria are based on irRC criteria ( Wolchok et al) adapted for 
unidimensional measurement as outlined by Nishino et al. The adaptation 
described by Bohnsack et al. further aligns irRECIST to allow for assessment of

 baseline non -target lesions and new non -measurable lesions  and discusses the 
impact of those lesions on the overall tumor response assessment. The adaptation 
by Bohnsack et al. allows for evaluation of subjects with non -target disease only 
and subjects in the adjuvant setting (not applicable for this study in subject s with 
metastatic disease).  
 
Overall response using the irRECIST is based on tumor burden as follows:  
 
irCR  Complete disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or 
not, and no new lesions) Lymph nodes must decrease to < 10 
mm in short axis. Confirmati on of response is not mandatory.  
irPR Decrease in tumor burden ≥30% in TMTB relative to baseline 
confirmed by a consecutive assessment at least 4 weeks after 
first documentation, non -target lesions are irNN, and no 
equivocal progression of new non-measurable lesions.  
irSD  Not meeting criteria for irCR, irPR, in absence of irPD  
irPD  Increase in tumor burden ≥20% increase and minimum 5 mm 
absolute increase in TMTB compared to nadir, or irPD  for non - 
target or new non -measurable lesions confirmed by a repeat, 
consecutive assessment no less than 4 weeks from the date first 
documented  
irNN  No target disease was identified at baseline and at follow -up the 
subject fails to meet criteria for irCR  or irPD.  
irNN = irNon -CR/Non -PD 
TMTB = Total measureable tumor burden  
 
7.0 ADVERSE  EVENTS  
7.1 Definitions  
 
7.1.1 Adverse Event  (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., an abnormal 
laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
drug) in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sig n 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the 
medicinal product.

 Hospitalization for elective surgery or routine clinical procedures that are not the 
result of an AE (e.g., surgical insertion of central line) need not be considered 
AEs and should not be recorded as an AE. Disease progression should not be 
recorded as an AE  unless it is attributable by the investigator to the study  therapy.  
 
7.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction  (SAR)  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any AE for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug is the cause. Reasonable possibility means that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the  drug and the AE. A 
suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
 
Causality assessment to a study drug is a medical judgment made in consideration 
of the following factors: temporal relationship of the AE to study drug exposure, 
known mechanism of action or side effect profile of study treatment, other recent 
or concomitant drug exposures, normal clinical course of the disease under 
investigation, and a ny other underlying or concurrent medical conditions. Other 
factors to consider in considering drug as the cause of the AE:  
 Single occurrence of an uncommon event known to be strongly  associated 
with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson 
Syndrome)  
 One or more occurrences of an event not commonly associated with  drug 
exposure, but otherwise uncommon in the population (e.g., tendon 
rupture); often more than once occurrence from one or multiple studies 
would be needed before the spon sor could determine that there is 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the  event.  
 An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial  that 
indicates the events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group 
than in a concurrent or historical control  group  
 
7.1.3 Unexpected AE or  SAR  
An AE or SAR is considered unexpected if the specificity or severity of it is not 
consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure 
(IB) for an unapproved investigational pro duct or package insert/summary of 
product characteristics for an approved product). Unexpected also refers to AEs 
or SARs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug  but are not 
specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.  
 
7.1.4 Serious AE or  SAR  
An AE or SAR is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes : 
 Death;  
 Is life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it  occurred);  
LCCC 1632  
PI: Autumn Mc Ree, 
MD CONFIDENTIAL 
UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
October 01 , 2020  
49  
  Requires in subject hospitalization (>24 hours) or prolongation  of 
existing  hospitalization;*  
 Results in congenital anomaly/birth  defect;  
 Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or  substantial 
disruption of the ability to conduct normal life  functions;  
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life - 
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious 
adverse  drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
in the definition. For reporting purposes, also consider the o ccurrences 
of pregnancy as an event which must be reported as an important 
medical  event.  
 Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an 
important medical  event.  
 Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic  or 
nonpathogen ic) via the study drug is an  SAE.  
 Although pregnancy, overdose, and cancer are not always serious  by 
regulatory definition, these events must be handled as  SAEs.  
 
*Hospitalization for anticipated or protocol specified procedures such as 
administration of chemotherapy, central line insertion, metastasis interventional 
therapy, resection of primary tumor, or elective surgery, will not be considered 
serious adverse events.  
 
Pregnancy that occurs during the study must also be reported as an SAE.  
 
7.2 Documentation  of non -serious AEs or  SARs  
For non -serious AEs or SARs, documentation must begin from day 1 of study 
treatment and continue through the 100 -day follow -up period after treatment is 
discontinued.  
 
Collected information should be recorded in the electronic Case Report Forms 
(eCRF) for that subject. Please include a description of the event, its severity 
or toxicity grade, onset and resolved dates (if applicable), and the relationship 
to the study drug. Documentation should occur at least monthly.  
 
7.3 SAEs or Ser ious SARs  
 
7.3.1 Timing  
After informed consent but prior to initiation of study medications, only SAEs 
caused by a protocol -mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. SAEs related to 
invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout).  
LCCC 1632  
PI: Autumn Mc Ree, 
MD CONFIDENTIAL 
UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
October 01 , 2020  
50  
 For any other experience or condition that meets the definition of an SAE or a 
serious SAR, recording of the event must begin from day 1 of study treatment and 
continue through the 100 -day follow -up period after treatment is discontinued.  
 
7.3.2 Documentation and  Notification  
SAEs or Serious SARs must be recorded in the SAE console within Oncore™ for 
that subject within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Additionally, the 
Regulatory Associate and Medical Monitor  must also be notified via em ail of all 
SAEs within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  
 
7.3.3 Reporting  
IRB Reporting Requirements:  
UNC : 
 The UNC -IRB will be notified of all SAEs that qualify as an 
Unanticipated Problem as per the UNC IRB Policies using the IRB’s web - 
based reporting system within 7 days of the  Investigator becoming aware 
of the  problem.  These events must  be reported to the sponsor within 24 
hours of learning of the occurrence.  
 
Affiliate sites:  
 For affiliate sites using a local IRB of record, please submit adverse  events 
per local IRB  policy.  
 For affiliate sites relying on the UNC -IRB, an aggregated list of all SAEs 
will be submitted to the UNC IRB annually at the time of study renewal 
according to the UNC IRB policies and procedures. In addition, any SAEs 
that qualify as an Unanticipated Problem will be entered into Oncore by 
the affiliate site and reported to the UNC IRB by the Multicenter 
Regulatory Associate  using the IRB’s web -based reporting system within 
7 days of the Investigator becoming aware of the  problem.  
Pregnancy  
Pregnancies and suspected pre gnancies (including a positive pregnancy test 
regardless of age or disease state) of a female subject or a female partner of a 
male subject occurring while the subject is on study, or within the period 
stipulated for continued contraceptive use for WOCBP ( 5 months) and sexually 
active men ( 6 months) after the subject’s last dose of study medication should be 
recorded as SAEs. The female subject is to be discontinued immediately from the 
study for a pregnancy event.  
 
For Affiliate sites, the pregnancy, susp ected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test 
must be reported to the Multicenter  Project Manager immediately (within 24 
hours) at CPOMultiCenter@med.unc.edu (primary route of submission) or 
facsimile (919) 966 -4300 (back -up)). The Multicenter  Project Manager will then 
report the event to the Funding Source (see requirements below). The female 
subject  or the female partner of a male subject  should be referred to an 
obstetrician -gynecologist, preferably one exp erienced in reproductive toxicity for 
further evaluation and counseling.  
LCCC 1632  
PI: Autumn Mc Ree, 
MD CONFIDENTIAL 
UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
October 01 , 2020  
51  
 The Investigator will follow the female subject or female partner of a male subject until 
completion of the pregnancy, and must document the outcome of the pregnancy (either 
normal or abnormal outcome) and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the 
Multicenter  Project Manager. If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (e. g., 
spontaneous or therapeutic abortion), the Investigator should report the abnormal outcome 
as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as 
an SAE.  
 
Note if the female subject or female partner of a male subjec t has received nivolumab, the 
investigator must immediately notify Worldwide Safety @BMS of this event via the 
Pregnancy Surveillance Form in accordance with SAE reporting procedures. The 
nivolumab IB notes that non -clinical safety findings of adverse preg nancy outcomes and 
infant losses in the absence of maternal toxicity have been reported. Findings in monkeys 
suggest a potential risk to human pregnancy if there is continued treatment with 
nivolumab during pregnancy.  
 
Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
The fol lowing laboratory abnormalities should be documented and reported appropriately:  
 any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets  the definition 
of an  SAE  
 any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to have study  drug discontinued or  
interrupted  
 any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to receive  specific corrective  
therapy.  
 
Overdose  
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a 
product that is considered both exces sive and medically important. All occurrences of 
overdose must be reported as an SAE.  
 
Other Safety Considerations  
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, 
electrocardiograms, x rays, and any other potential safety assessments, whether or not 
these procedures are required by the protocol, should also be recorded as a nonserious or 
serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.

FDA Expedited Reporting requirements for studies conducted under an  IND: 
A sponsor (in this case the LCCC) must report any suspected adverse reaction that 
is both serious  and unexpected to the FDA. The sponsor must report an adverse 
event as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event, such  as: 
 A single  occurrence  of an event  that is uncommon  and known  to be strongly 
associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens - 
Johnson  Syndrome);  
 One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly  associated with 
drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the populati on exposed to 
the drug (e.g. tendon  rupture);  
 An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such 
as known consequences of underlying disease or condition under 
investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study populati on 
independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more 
frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical 
control  group.  
 
The sponsor must submit each IND safety report on FDA Form 3500A. Each 
notification to FDA must  bear prominent identification of its contents, i.e., “IND 
Safety Report,” and must be transmitted to the review division that has the 
responsibility for review of the IND. In each IND safety report, the sponsor must 
identify all IND safety reports previou sly submitted to FDA concerning a similar 
suspected adverse reaction, and must analyze the significance of the suspected 
adverse reaction in light of previous, similar reports or any other relevant 
information.  
 
Timing  
FDA must be notified of potential ser ious risks within 15 calendar days after the 
sponsor determines the event requires reporting. FDA must be notified of 
unexpected  fatal or life-threatening  suspected  adverse  reactions  as soon  as possible 
but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the 
information. The sponsor must be notified by the investigator within 24 hours of 
the event. For Multicenter trials, Lineberger is the sponsor, therefore, the 
Mult icenter Project Manager must be notified of the SAE within 24 hours of the 
event.  If the results of a sponsor’s investigation show that an adverse event not 
initially determined to be reportable is reportable, the sponsor must report such 
suspected adverse  reaction in an IND safety report as soon as possible, but in no 
case later than 15 calendar days after the determination is  made.  
 
Follow -up 
LCCC 1632  
PI: Autumn Mc Ree, 
MD CONFIDENTIAL 
UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
October 01 , 2020  
54  
 The sponsor must promptly investigate all safety information it receives. Relevant 
follow -up informa tion to an IND safety report must be submitted as soon as the 
information is available and as such the Multicenter Project Manager should be 
updated within 24 hours of the information being available via a follow -up 
MedWatch Form 3500A.  
 
Notification of Investigators  
The sponsor must notify all participating investigators (i.e., all investigators to 
whom the sponsor is providing drug under its INDs or under any investigator’s 
IND) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any 
other source, as soon  as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after 
the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting.  
 
Process  
If the sponsor deems that an event is both a serious SAR AND unexpected, it must 
also (in addition to Oncore) be re corded on the MedWatch Form 3500A . 
Unexpected adverse events or adverse reaction refers to an event or reaction that is 
not listed in the investigator’s brochure /IND  or is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observe d; or if an investigator’s brochure is not required or 
available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general 
investigation plan or elsewhere in the current IND application.  
 
The MedWatch 3500A form and supporting documents definin g the event and 
causality should be sent to the electronic mailbox (CPOMultiCenter@med.unc.edu; 
primary route of submission) (or facsimile (919) 966 -4300 (back -up)) of the 
Multicenter Project Manager along with supporting documentation defining the 
event a nd causality.  The Multicenter Project Manager will then send the report to 
the Funding Source. The MedWatch 3500a form can be accessed at: 
http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/Download Forms/default.htm . 
 
(Please be sure and access form 3500a, and not form 3500).  
 
Once the UNC Principal Investigator determines an event is a serious SAR AND 
unexpected, the MedWatch 3500A form will be submitted to the FDA . If the event 
is serious, unexpected and considered to be possibly -, probably - or definitely -related 
to the study treatment, the Multicenter Project Manager will inform the Regulatory 
Associate at UNC  and IND Specialist. The MedWatch form will be submitted  
according to LCCC SOP for safety reporting for a multi -site study . 
 
All IND safety reports must be submitted on Form 3500A and be accompanied by 
Form 1571. The FDA must be notified or any unexpected or life -threatening 
suspected adverse reactions as soon as possible, but no later than 7 calendar days of 
learning of the event.

55  
 The Multicenter Project Manager wil l also be responsible for informing each 
Affiliate site of all serious and unexpected SARs reported to the FDA via fax as 
soon as possible.  
 
Additional Reporting Requirements  
The following additional items must be reported via IND safety report:  
 Findings from other studies. The sponsor must report any findings  from 
epidemiological studies, pooled analysis of multiple studies, or clinical 
studies, whether or not conducted under an IND, and whether or not 
conducted by the sponsor, that suggest a sig nificant risk to humans 
exposed to the  drug.  
 Findings from animal or in vitro testing. The sponsor must report any 
findings from animal or in vitro testing, whether or not conducted by  the 
sponsor, that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the d rug, 
such as reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity, or 
reports of significant organ toxicity t or near the expected human 
exposure.  
 Increased rate of occurrence of serious suspected adverse  reactions.  
 
Additional Guidance  
Please refer  to 21CFR312.32 and “Guidance for Industry and Investigators: 
Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies” for additional 
information and reporting requirements. All IND Safety Reports will be  submitted 
in accordance with these  regulations/gui dances.  
 
7.4 Data and Safety Monitoring  Plan  
The Principal Investigator will provide continuous monitoring of subject safety in 
this trial with periodic reporting to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC).  
 
Meetings/teleconferences will be held at a f requency dependent on study accrual, 
and in consultation with the study Biostatistician. These meetings will include the 
investigators as well as protocol nurses, clinical research associates, regulatory 
associates, data managers, biostatisticians, and any  other relevant personnel the 
principal investigators may deem appropriate.  At these meetings, the research 
team will discuss all issues relevant to study progress, including enrollment, 
safety, regulatory, data collection, etc.  
 
The team will produce sum maries or minutes of these meetings. These summaries 
will be available for inspection when requested by any of the regulatory bodies 
charged with the safety of human subjects and the integrity of data including, but 
not limited to, the oversight (Office of  Human Research Ethics (OHRE) 
Biomedical IRB, the Oncology Protocol Review Committee (PRC) or the North 
Carolina TraCS Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).  
LCCC 1632  
PI: Autumn Mc Ree, 
MD CONFIDENTIAL 
UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA

56  
 The UNC LCCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review the  
study on a regular (quarterly to annually) basis, with the frequency of review 
based on risk and complexity as determined by the UNC Protocol Review 
Committee. The UNC PI will be responsible for submitting the following 
information for review: 1) safety a nd accrual data including the number of 
subjects treated; 2) significant developments reported in the literature that may 
affect the safety of participants or the ethics of the study; 3) preliminary response 
data; and 4) summaries of team meetings that hav e occurred since the last report. 
Findings of the DSMC review will be disseminated by memo to the UNC PI, 
PRC, and the UNC IRB and DSMB.  
 
8.0 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 Study Design/Study  Endpoints  
 
This study will be a prospective, single arm, multicenter, open -label phase II 
clinical trial investigating the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab with 
panitumumab in subjects with unresectable, refractory, KRAS /NRAS /BRAF wild- 
type, microsatellite st able metastatic colorectal cancer. The primary objective of 
this study is to estimate the ORR (CR + PR) in these subjects at 12 weeks by 
RECIST 1.1 criteria. Secondary objectives include the following: estimating the 
ORR (CR + PR) at 12 weeks by irRECIST c riteria, estimating the best response 
rate by both RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST criteria, estimating PFS and duration of 
response using both RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST criteria, estimating OS, and 
characterizing the safety issues associated with this regimen. Expl oratory 
objectives involve investigating various biomarkers and peripheral blood and 
tumor assays.  
 
8.2 Sample Size and  Accrual  
Power and sample size considerations for this study are based on the primary 
objective. The historical overall response rate (CR+PR)  of KRAS wild-type 
mCRC to panitumumab is approximately 22%. The proposed treatment regimen 
is expected to increase the response rate to a clinically relevant rate of at least 
35%. A Simon two -stage minimax design will be used, with an alpha=0.10, and 
powe r of 80%, to evaluate the efficacy of this treatment regimen. The null and 
alternative hypothesis overall response rates (CR + PR) are 22% and 35%, 
respectively. In the first stage, 32 evaluable subjects will be enrolled and treated. 
If 6 or less of these 32 first stage subjects are ‘responders’ (i.e., either a CR or a 
PR), the trial will be suspended and study investigators will consult with the study 
funding sources (BMS and Amgen) and with the DSMC about whether or not to 
continue accruing subjects to th e study. However, if 7 subjects or more are found 
to be responders, another 24 evaluable subjects will be accrued for a total of at 
least 56 evaluable subjects. If a total of 17 (or more) responders are  observed  
LCCC 1632  
PI: Autumn Mc Ree, 
MD CONFIDENTIAL 
UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
October 01 , 2020  
57  
 among the total of 56 evaluabl e subjects, then this treatment regimen would be 
considered of clinical interest and therefore would justify further development.  
 
We expect to accrue subjects at a rate of approximately 4 subjects per month. At 
this rate, we expect total accrual to this s tudy to take approximately 30 months, 
allowing for up to 6 month assessment period for response between the first and 
second stages.  
 
8.3 Toxicity  Monitoring  
Toxicity will be assessed using NCI CTCAE version 4.03. Subjects will be monitored 
for excessive toxic ity over the duration of the study. A toxicity rate due to the study 
regimen greater than 35% would be considered unacceptable.  Toxicity events that 
will be monitored will be those that call for discontinuation of therapy, as defined in 
Section 4.4. 
 
Pocock -type boundaries will be utilized as described in Ivanova, A., et al. Biometrics. 
2005; 61(2):540 -5. If a toxicity boundary is reached, accrual for the study will be 
suspended and the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be alerted.  
The DSMC (in consultation with the Principal Investigator and the drug company) 
will evaluate the toxicity events to help determine whether or not to terminate the 
study.  
 
Accrual to the trial is to be suspended if the number of pr otocol defined toxic 
events is equal to or larger than boundary in the table below.

8.4 Data Analysis  Plans  
 
ORRs and best response rates will be determined using both the RECIST 1.1 and 
irRECIST criteria will be reported along with their correspon ding 95% confidence 
intervals. Wilson’s method will be used to calculate confidence intervals for these 
rates (reported as percentages). PFS and the duration of response estimates using 
both the RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST criteria will be calculated using the  Kaplan - 
Meier (or product -limit) method. OS will also be calculated using the Kaplan - 
Meier (or product -limit) method. These time to event estimated functions will be 
plotted, and median time to estimates will be reported along with their 95%  
LCCC 1632  
PI: Autumn Mc Ree, 
MD CONFIDENTIAL 
UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA

58  
 confidence intervals. The confidence intervals for these time to event functions 
will be calculated using the standard and well known “loglog” method. If 
appropriate, 6, 12, and 24 month estimates for the time to event functions will 
also be reported.  
 
The primary analysis will apply to the total number of evaluable subjects. 
Toxicity and safety information will be reported in a descriptive manner in the 
form of frequency tables. Toxicity will be defined through the number and 
frequency of treatment -emer gent grade 3 and 4 toxicities as defined by National 
Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI 
CTCAE v4.03). Hypothesis generating exploratory analyses will be performed 
when appropriate sample size considerations allow. The de finitions of the 
outcomes (or endpoints) of interest can be found in section 2.4. 
 
9.0 STUDY  MANAGEMENT  
9.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval and  Consent  
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in 
accordance with federally mandated regulations. The IRB should approve the 
consent form and protocol.  
 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply 
with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adher e to Good  Clinical 
Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration 
of Helsinki.  
 
Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the subject will be given a full 
explanation of the study and will be given the opportuni ty to review the consent 
form. Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required 
by the FDA Regulations and local or state regulations. Once this essential 
information has been provided to the subject and the investigator is assur ed that 
the subject understands the implications of participating in the study, the subject 
will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by signing an  
IRB-approved consent form.  
 
Prior to a subject’s participation in the trial, the written inf ormed consent form 
should be signed and personally dated by the subject and by the person who 
conducted the informed consent discussion.  
 
9.2 Required  Documentation  
Before the study can be initiated at any site, the following documentation must be 
provided to the Clinical Protocol Office (CPO) at the University of North 
Carolina.

9.4 Data Management and  Monitoring/Auditing  
UNC LCCC will serve as the coordinatin g center for this trial. Data will be collected 
through a web based clinical research platform, OnCore®. Other study institutions will 
be given a password to directly enter their own data onto the web site via electronic 
case report forms (eCRFs). Multicenter personnel will coordinate and manage data for 
quality control assurance and integrity.  
 
All data will be collected and entered into OnCore® by Clinical Research Associates 
(CRAs) from UNC LCCC and participating institutions. The investigators at each site 
will allow monitors to review all source documents supporting data entered into 
OnCore®. The Multicenter Data Coordinator can be reached at 919 -843-2742 or 1 -877-
668-0683.  
 
All data will be monitored  and source data will be verified on selected subjects.   Queries 
will be issued on an ongoing basis on all subjects. Participating sites should respond to 
data queries within 14 days of receipt. The LCCC compliance committee or their 
designee will audit tr ial sites every twelve months while still enrolling or subjects are still 
on treatment. Participating sites must send source and regulatory documents to LCCC 
upon request, for remote monitoring and/or audit review.  
 
9.5 Adherence to the  Protocol  
Except for an emergency situation in which proper care for the protection,  safety, and 
well-being of the study subject requires alternative treatment, the study shall be 
conducted exactly as described in the approved  protocol.

9.5.1 Emergency  Modifications  
UNC and Affiliate investigators may implement a deviation from, or a change of, the 
protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to trial subjects without prior UNC or 
their respective institution’s IRB/IEC approval/favorable opinion.  
 
For Institutions Relying on UNC’s IRB:  
For any such emergency modification implemented, a UNC IRB  modification form 
must be completed by UNC Research Personnel within five (5) business days of 
making the  change.  
 
For Institutions Relying on Their Own IRB:  
For Affiliate investigators relying on  their own institution’s IRB, as soon as 
possible after the modification has been made, the implemented deviation or 
change and the reasons for it should be submitted to:  
 
 To UNC Principal Investigator for  agreement  
 The Affiliate institution’s IRB for revi ew and approval. (Once 
IRB’s response is received, this should be forwarded to the 
Multicenter Regulatory  Associate).  
 
9.5.2 Single Subject/Subject  Exceptions  
Eligibility single subject exceptions are not permitted for Lineberger Comprehensive 
Cancer Center Investigator Initiated Trials under any circumstances. Other types of 
single subject exceptions may be allowed if proper regulatory review has been 
completed in accordance with Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center’s Single 
Subject Exceptions Polic y. 
 
 
9.5.3 Other Protocol  Deviations/Violations  
According to UNC’s IRB, a protocol deviation is any unplanned variance from an IRB 
approved protocol that:  
 Is generally noted or recognized after it  occurs  
 Has no substantive effect on the risks to research  partici pants  
 Has no substantive effect on the scientific integrity of the research  plan or 
the value of the data  collected  
 Did not result from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of  the 
investigator(s).  
 
An unplanned protocol variance is considered a violation if the variance meets any 
of the following criteria:  
LCCC 1632  
PI: Autumn Mc Ree, 
MD CONFIDENTIAL 
UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
October 01 , 2020  
61  
  Has harmed or increased the risk of harm to one or more  research 
participants.  
 Has damaged the scientific integrity of the data collected for the  study.  
 Results from willful or knowing  misconduct on the part of  the 
investigator(s).  
 Demonstrates serious or continuing noncompliance with  federal 
regulations, State laws, or University  policies.  
If a deviation or violation occurs please follow the guidelines below: 
For Institutions Relying on UNC’s IRB : 
Protocol Deviations: UNC or Affiliate personnel will record the deviation in 
OnCore®, and report to any sponsor or data and safety monitoring committee in 
accordance with their policies. Deviations should be summarized and reported to 
the IRB  at the time of continuing review.  
 
Protocol Violations: Violations should be reported by UNC personnel within one  
(1) week of the investigator becoming aware of the event using the same IRB 
online mechanism used to report Unanticipated Problems.  
 
For Inst itutions Relying on Their Own IRB:  
In addition to adhering to the policies regarding protocol compliance set forth by 
your institution’s IRB, the following is also required:  
 
Protocol Deviations: In the event a deviation from protocol procedures is 
identif ied, record the deviation in OnCore®. 
 
Protocol Violations: Any protocol violation that occurs must be reported to your 
IRB per institutional policies and reported to the Multicenter Project Manager 
within 5 days. UNC -CH will determine if the violati on affects the safety of the 
subject and integrity of the data. Once your institution’s IRB response is received, 
please forward to the Multicenter Regulatory Associate.  
 
Unanticipated Problems:  
UNC  
Any events that meet the criteria for “Unanticipated Problems” as defined by 
UNC’s IRB must be reported by the Study Coordinator using the IRB’s web - 
based reporting system.  
 
Affiliate Sites:  
Any events that meet the criteria for “Unanticipated Problems (UPs)” as defined 
by UNC’s IRB must also  be reported to the Multicenter Project Manager. The 
Multicenter Project Manager  will report the event to the UNC IRB using the 
IRB’s web -based reporting system. Examples of such UPs include a lost or stolen

Algorithms are presented for management of GI, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, endocrine, 
skin and neurological toxicities are provided. NCI -CTCAEv4.03 criteria apply as 
referenced in the protocol.  The algorithms are potential suggested schemes for 
management of potential irAEs  but should only serve as a complement to 
investigator judgment and additional guidelines for monitoring and management of 
immune related toxicities . Additionally, recommend management refer ring to NCCN 
Guidelines  “Management of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor -Related Toxicities.”  In cases 
of discrepancy between the algorithms and additional guidelines, investigator judgment 
should be used, and highly encourage consultation with medical monitor.

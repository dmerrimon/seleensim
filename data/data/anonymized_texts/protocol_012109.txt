TITLE A Phase Ib/II Study of Anti-PD- 1 Antibody Pembrolizumab and Imp rime 
PGG for Patients with Metastati c Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Aft er 
Progression on First-Line Therap y
PHASE  Phase Ib/II 
OBJECTIVES Primary Objectives: 
Phase Ib Dose Escalation Cohort :  To establish the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) of Imprime PGG in combina tion with pembrolizumab for subj ects with 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after progression  on first-line 
platinum-based chemotherapy.  
Phase II Study:   To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) using RECIST v1.1  
in subjects with metastatic NSCLC treated with Imprime PGG in c ombination 
with pembrolizumab after progression on first-line systemic the rapy (either 
platinum-based chemotherapy with or without immune checkpoint i nhibitor or 
immune checkpoint inhibitor as first line therapy) based on REC IST v1.1.  
Secondary Objectives for Phase Ib:  
 Characterize adverse effects (AEs) of Imprime PGG in combinatio n with 
pembrolizumab in subjects with NSCLC who progressed after first -line 
platinum-based chemotherapy.  
 Estimate clinical benefit rate (CBR: complete response, partial  response, or 
stable disease) measured by RECIST v1.1 of Imprime PGG in combi nation 
with pembrolizumab in subjects with NSCLC who progressed after first-line 
platinum-based chemotherapy.  
 Estimate Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and 6 month PFS using RECIST v1.1 
in subjects with NSCLC who progressed after first-line platinum -based 
chemotherapy when treated with Imprime PGG in combination with 
pembrolizumab.  
 Estimate overall survival (OS) and 1-year OS in subjects with N SCLC who 
progressed after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy when tr eated with 
Imprime PGG in combinati on with pembrolizumab.  
Secondary Objectives for Phase II:  
 Characterize adverse effects (AEs) of Imprime PGG in combinatio n with 
pembrolizumab in subjects with NSCLC who progressed after first -line 
systemic therapy.  
 Estimate clinical benefit rate (CBR: complete response, partial  response, or 
stable disease) of Imprime PGG in  combination with pembrolizuma b in 
subjects with NSCLC who progressed after first-line systemic th erapy. 
 Estimate Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and 6 month PFS using RECIST v1.1 
in subjects with NSCLC when treated with Imprime PGG in combina tion with 
pembrolizumab who progressed after  first-line systemic therapy.   
 Estimate overall survival (OS) and 1-year OS in subjects with N SCLC when 
treated with Imprime PGG in combi nation with pembrolizumab who progressed 
after first-line systemic therapy.  
Correlative Objectives for Phase Ib/II Study:  
 Correlate biomarkers on immune cell subsets (including, but not  limited to 
monocytes, macrophages, granuloc ytes, and lymphocytes, and PD-L 1) 
concentrations and localization (peri- vs. intratumoral) in arc hived diagnostic 
tumor tissue with PFS and CBR. 
 Correlate change in soluble PD-L1 levels pre-dose Cycles 2 and 3 , relative to 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium BTCRC LUN15-017 Version Date  29OCT2020 
  Confidential  
Page 4 of 68 baseline (i.e., pre-dose Day 1 of  Cycle 1) level with PFS and C BR. 
 Correlate PD-L1 expression on cir culating peripheral mononuclea r cells from 
whole blood pre-dose Cycles 2 and 3, relative to baseline (i.e. , pre-dose Day 1 of 
Cycle 1) level.  
 Correlate anti-β-glucan antibody  (ABA) (IgM, IgG) levels with P FS and CBR. 
 Correlate proteomic i mmune classifiers at baseline with PFS and  CBR. 
 Correlate Fc RIIa polymorphism to PFS and CBR.

TREATMENT 
PLAN Phase Ib: Dosing will occur in 21- day cycles. Imprime PGG in th is dose 
escalation study will be dosed a t 2 mg/kg IV or 4 mg/kg IV on D ay 1, 8, and 
15 of each 21 day cycle. On Day 1 of  each cycle, pembrolizumab will be 
infused at 200 mg.  On Day 1 of each cycle, the Imprime PGG int ravenous 
infusion is given first followed 15-30 minutes later by the pem brolizumab 
infusion. Imprime PGG will be administered as a 2-4 hour intrav enous infusion 
(based on dose and on the subject’s weight). Pembrolizumab will  be 
administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion. Subsequent cy cles beyond 
Cycle 1 must meet the criteria found in section 6.1. 
Phase II: Imprime PGG will be dosed at the dose established in Phase 1b (4 
mg/kg) on Day 1, 8, and 15 of each 21 da y cycle for the first 4  cycles (12 
weeks) and on Day 1 for Cycle s 5-16. On Day 1 of each cycle, pe mbrolizumab 
will be infused at 200 mg. On Da y 1 of each cycle, the Imprime PGG 
intravenous infusion is given first followed 15-30 minutes late r by the 
pembrolizumab infusion. Imprime PGG will be administered as a 2 -4 hour 
intravenous infusion (based on dose and on the subject’s weight ). 
Pembrolizumab will be administered as a 30-minute intravenous i nfusion. 
Subse quent c ycles be yond C ycle 1 must meet the criteria found in section 6.1.

Page 6 of 68 STATISTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS  Phase Ib: A standard “3+3” design will be used with maximum number of 
subjects accrued to be 12.  
Phase II:  For this single arm Phase II study, study endpoint will be med ian 
PFS as assessed by the RECIST v1.1 criteria. 
The null hypothesis is that median PFS of combination drug is 3 .2 months 
(equal to single agent pembrolizumab among subjects with a prop ortion score 
of 1 to 49%); the alternative hypothe sis is that the PFS is 6.3  months (equal to 
single agent pembrolizumab among subjects with a proportion sco re of ≥ 
50%).  
With a total sample size of 24 t he study will have 90% power to  detect a 
difference of 3.1 months (i.e ., 6.3 months versus 3.2 months), controlling for a 
two-sided type I error probability of 5%. The power analysis wa s conducted 
using the power calculation for one arm survival design propose d by 
Lawless39.  
Unevaluable sub jects will be re placed.

1.1. Introduction 
Lung cancer is one of the most c ommonly diagnosed cancers world wide with 1.8 million cases that 
account for 13.0% of the total.  It is also one of the leading causes of death worldwide accounting for 
1.6 million or 19.4% of al l cancer related deaths.1 Historically, one management algorithm was 
applied to all patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) . A platinum agent combined with 
pemetrexed (for nonsquamous), pac litaxel, docetaxel, vinorelbin e, or gemcitabine was recommended 
for first-line chemotherapy. 
 
More recently (May 10, 2017) the U.S. Food and Drug Administrat ion (FDA) approved the immune 
checkpoint inhibitor (as describe d below) pembrolizumab in comb ination with pemetrexed and 
carboplatin for the treatment of patients with previously untre ated metastatic non-squamous non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).2 Just prior to that time (Oct ober 24, 2016) the FDA approved 
pembrolizumab as monotherapy for second-line therapy in patient s with metastatic NSCLC whose 
tumors have high PD-L1 expression (Tumor Proportion Score [TPS]  greater than or equal to 50%) as 
determined by an FDA-approved test.3 
 
Second-line chemotherapy at the time of disease progression cou ld include docetaxel, or pemetrexed 
and erlotinib was recommended as second/third-line therapy.4 Commonly used 2nd line therapy for 
NSCLC creates median overall surv ival (OS) and progression free  survival (PFS) of 7.5 (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 6.6–8.4) and 4.1 (95% CI: 3.7–4.5) mo nths, respectivel y, in community 
setting.5 Single docetaxel use results i n 7.5% partial response rate (RR ),6 pemetrexed use in 9.1% 
RR,7 and erlotinib use in 8.9% RR.8   These low survival and RR rates clearly indicate the need to 
develop more effective therapies for NSCLC after disease progre ssion following first line therapy. 
 There are now at least 3 immune checkpoint inhibitors that are approved in the second-line setting: 
nivolumab,
9,10 pembrolizumab,11 and atezolizumab.12 Of note, nivolumab and atezolizumab are 
approved in this setting regardless of the degree of PD-L1 expr ession while PDL-1 expression >1% 
is required in the case of pembrolizumab.  1.1.1.  The Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) Receptor, Its Ligand PD-L1, and a  Novel 
Immunotherapy  
An increasing body of evidence, both from lab based animal mode ls and from clinical 
epidemiology, suggests that the immune system can operate as a significant barrier to tumor 
formation and progression. One of  the hallmarks of cancer is it s ability to evade immune 
destruction.13 The Programmed death 1 (PD-1) r eceptor is expressed on activate d T- and B-
cells.14 Its major ligand, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) (B7-H1) is  typically expressed 
on a subset of macrophages, but can be induced by inflammatory cytokines in a variety of 
tissue types, including tumor cells.15-19 When activated T-cells expressing PD-1 encounter PD-
L1, T-cell effector functions are  diminished. PD-1 also binds p rogrammed death ligand 2 (PD-
L2) (B7-DC), which is expressed selectively on macrophages and dendritic cells.19-21 These 
unique expression patterns suggest t hat PD-L1 promotes self-tol erance in peripheral tissues, 
while PD-L2 may function in lymphoid organs, although the role of PD-L2 in 
immunomodulation is not as well understood.22 Multiple tumor types have been shown to 
express PD-L1 and PD-L2, effectiv ely co-opting a native toleran ce mechanism.23-26 It has been 
postulated that antibodies that block the interaction between P D-1 and PD-L1 in tumor tissue 
may preferentially unleash the cytotoxic function of tumor-spec ific T cells with fewer

Page 16 of 68 systematic toxic effects than those that are seen with other im mune checkpoint inhibitors, such 
as anti-cytotoxic T- lymphocyte-associate d antigen 4 (CTLA-4) an tibodies.27  
 Two large, dose-escalation, phase  1 clinical trials evaluating the safety of the anti–PD-1 
antibody nivolumab (formerly known as BMS936558) and the anti–P D-L1 antibody 
BMS936559 showed significant antitu mor activity in subjects wit h advanced melanoma, lung 
carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma, among other cancers, thus validating the PD-1–PD-L1 
axis as a therapeutic target.
28-30 Most tumor responses were durable beyond 1 year.29,30 Toxic 
effects were generally of low gr ade. Especially relevant to thi s protocol, cumulative response 
rates (all doses) were 18% among patients with non-small-cell l ung cancer (14 of 76 patients).30 
 A recent randomized, open-label, phase 3, international study c omparing nivolumab to 
docetaxel in patients with adva nced squamous-cell non–small-cel l lung cancer who had disease 
progression during or after first -line chemotherapy showed that  OS, PFS and RR were 
significantly better with nivolum ab than docetaxel. The median overall survival was 9.2 
months (95% confidence interva l [CI], 7.3 to 13.3) with nivolum ab versus 6.0 months (95% 
CI, 5.1 to 7.3) with docetaxel. The risk of death was 41% lower  with nivolumab than with 
docetaxel (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.79; P<0.001). At 1 year, the OS rate was 42% 
(95% CI, 34 to 50) with nivolumab  versus 24% (95% CI, 17 to 31)  with docetaxel. The RR 
was 20% with nivolumab versus 9%  with docetaxel (P=0.008). The median PFS was 3.5 
months with nivolumab versus 2.8 months with docetaxel (hazard ratio for death or disease 
progression, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.81; P<0.001). Treatment-re lated adverse events of grade 
3 or 4 were reported in 7% of the patients in the nivolumab gro up as compared with 55% of 
those in the docetaxel group.31 
 Pembrolizumab (formerly known as  MK-3475) is a highly selective , humanized monoclonal 
IgG4–kappa isotype antibody against PD-1 that can disrupt the e ngagement of PD-1 with its 
ligands and impede inhibitory signals in T Cells, with resultan t tumor recognition by cytotoxic 
T cells. The anti-tumor activity, side effects and safety of pe mbrolizumab in patients with 
advanced non-small-cell lung can cer was studied as part of the large, international, Phase 1 
KEYNOTE-001 trial. The KEYNOTE- 001 trial supporte d the approval  by the U. S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) of pembrolizumab for the treatment of  patients with metastatic 
NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L 1 as determined by an FDA-approv ed test and who have 
disease progression on or after p latinum-containing chemotherap y. In this trial 495 patients 
received intravenous (IV) pembrolizumab at a dose of either 2mg  or 10mg per kilogram of 
body weight every 3 weeks or 10 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks o ver a 30-minute period. The 
overall RR was 19.4% (95% CI 16.0-23.2), which included a respo nse rate of 18.0% (95% CI, 
14.4 to 22.2) in 394 previously treated patients and 24.8% (95%  CI 16.7 to 34.3) in the 101 
previously untreated patients. The best overall response was st able disease in 21.8% of 
patients. The RR was similar regardless of dose, schedule and h istologic analysis. The median 
duration of response was 12.5 months (range 1.0 to 23.3) in all  patients, 10.4 months (range, 
1.0 to 10.4) in previously treated patients and 23.3 months (ra nge, 1.0 to 23.3) in previously 
untreated patients. Median PFS wa s 3.7 months (95% CI, 2.9 to 4 .1) for all the patients, 3.0 
months (95% CI, 2.2 to 4.0) for previously treated patients, an d 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.1 to 
8.6) for previously untreated pat ients. Median OS was 12.0 mont hs (95% CI, 9.3 to 14.7) for 
all the patients, 9.3 months ( 95% CI, 8.4 to 12.4) for previous ly treated patients, and 16.2 
months (95% CI, 16.2 to not reached) for previously untreated p atients.32 Treatment-related 
adverse events occurred in 351 patients (70.9%),  with no clear difference according to dose or

Page 17 of 68 schedule. The most common treatmen t-related adverse events were  fatigue, pruritus, and 
decreased appetite. Adverse even ts of grade 3 or higher were re ported in 47 of 495 patients 
(9.5%). The only treatment-relat ed adverse events of an inflamm atory or immune-mediated 
nature that occurred in more tha n 2% of patients were infusion- related reactions (in 15 patients 
[3.0%]), hypothyroidism (in 34 patients [6.9%]), and pneumoniti s (in 18 patients [3.6%]). One 
infusion reaction led to treatment discontinuation. All the pat ients with hypothyroidism were 
successfully treated with medical therapy. Pneumonitis of grade  3 or greater was observed in 
9 patients (1.8%), including 1 (0.2%) who died.32 This study showed durable responses and 
acceptable tolerance and toxicity profile of pembrolizumab in p atients with non-small-cell lung 
cancer, previously treated as well as untreated patients. It ec hoed findings from melanoma 
studies that efficacy and side-ef fect profile was not significa ntly different between patients 
receiving the dose of 10 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks and thos e receiving 10 mg per 
kilogram every 3 weeks.   In a recent multicenter study of 135 subjects with advanced mel anoma, treatment with MK-
3475 was demonstrated to have a h igh rate of sustained tumor re gression with mainly grade 1 
or 2 toxicities, and a very low incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxic ities.
33 Selection of 200 mg as the 
appropriate dose for a switch to fixed dosing is based on simul ation results indicating that 200 
mg will provide exposures that are reasonably consistent with t hose obtained with 2 mg/kg 
dose and importantly will main tain individual patient exposures  within the exposure range 
established in melanoma as associated with maximal clinical res ponse.  A population PK 
model, which characterized the influence of body weight and oth er patient covariates on 
exposure, has been developed usin g available data from 476 subj ects from PN001. The 
distribution of exposures from th e 200 mg fixed dose are predic ted to overlap considerably to 
those obtained with the 2mg/kg dose, with some tendency for ind ividual values to range 
slightly higher with the 200 mg fixed dose. The slight increase  in PK variability predicted for 
the fixed dose relative to wei ght-based dosing is not expected to be important clinically given 
that the range of individual exposures is well contained within  the range of exposures shown 
in the melanoma and NSCLC studies  of 2 and 10 mg/kg to provide similar efficacy and safety.  
The population PK evaluation revealed that there was no signifi cant impact of tumor burden 
on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCL C and melanoma indications. 
Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure between  different tumor types and 
indication settings.  
1.1.2.  Imprime PGG: A Novel Potentiator  of Checkpoint Inhibitor Therap y 
 Preclinical Mechanism of Action 
Imprime PGG is a 1,3/1,6  glucan isolated from the cell wall of a proprietary strain of the 
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae  and is in development for the treatment of cancer in concert 
with anti-cancer therapeutic an tibodies, anti-angiogenics and c heckpoint inhibitors. 
 
Imprime PGG is administered in travenously and is bound by natur ally occurring anti-  glucan 
antibodies (ABA) (IgG, IgM) which can then activate complement resulting in the 
opsonization of the Imprime-ABA c omplex. This immune complex ca n then bind directly to 
innate immune effector cells (macrophages, monocytes, neutrophi ls) via complement receptor 
3 and FcgRIIa (CD32a) and possibly the dectin receptor. Levels of ABA vary in the human 
population. In healthy human volun teer studies, binding of the Imprime PGG immune complex 
correlates with higher ABA levels, in particular IgG ABA. These  IgG ABA are predominantly

Confidential  
Page 18 of 68 of the IgG2a subtype and interact  specifically with the IgG rec eptor FcgRIIa (CD32a). There 
are two genetic variants of FcgRIIa – a high binding and a low binding variant- encoded by 
either the HIS131 or Arg131 allele s, respectively. Imprime PGG binding to, and subsequent 
activation of, innate immune effe ctor cells is thereby influenc ed by the levels of ABA and by 
the affinity of the FcgRIIa. Patients with higher ABA and/ or t he high-binding FcgRIIa allele 
may therefore have the highest likelihood of responding to Impr ime PGG- based therapy. A 
f u l l y  q u a l i f i e d  E L I S A  f o r  A B A  h a s  b e e n  d e v e l o p e d .  A  g e n e t i c  a n a lysis for the single 
nucleotide polymorphism at codon 131 has also been developed. B oth are being assessed as 
possible patient selection or  stratification markers.34,35 
 Preclinical mechanistic work has revealed that Imprime PGG acts  therapeutically as a 
Pathogen Associated Molecular Pattern  (PAMP). PAMPs are critical, “non-self” signals 
efficiently and effectively recognized by the different lineage s of the innate immune system- 
macrophages, monocytes, neutrophi ls. As a PAMP, Imprime PGG enh ances innate immune 
cell killing, macrophage re-polar ization and, importantly, the maturation and activation of 
professional antigen presenting cells (i.e. dendritic cells). A ccordingly, both ex vivo  research 
in human whole blood and in vivo  tumor studies in immunocompete nt mice have indicated that 
Imprime PGG treatment may drive e nhanced antigen presentation a nd cross-talk with T cells, 
thereby enhancing the efficacy  of checkpoint inh ibitor therapy.  In the syngeneic tumor model 
MC-38, Imprime PGG treatment si gnificantly expanded the percent age of mice remaining 
tumor-free from 33% (6/18) in mice treated with PD-L1 antibody alone to to 83% (14/17) in 
mice treated with the combination of Imprime PGG and PD-L1 antibody.  Importantly, when 
re-challenged with MC-38 tumo r cells injected on the opposite f lank, all of these tumor-free 
mice remained tumor- free while age-matched, tumor-naïve mice d eveloped tumors. These 
data provide compelling preclinic a l  e v i d e n c e  t h a t  I m p r i m e  P G G  t reatment expanded the 
percent of mice effectively trea ted with this checkpoint inhibi tor and fostered immunologic 
memory.
34 
 Furthermore, recent work presented at the 2015 American Associa tion for Cancer Research
36 
showed that Imprime PGG can modu late PD-L1 expression.  Monocyt es derived from human 
whole blood treated with Imprime PGG or vehicle were cultured i n media with appropriate 
cytokines to foster differentia tion of macrophages or dendritic  cells. Imprime PGG increased 
the expression of PD-L1 and produc tion of interferon in both ma crophages and dendritic cells. 
When incubated with cell lines from numerous cancer types, incl uding NSCLC, breast, 
pancreatic, and colon, PD-L1 expr ession was substantially unreg ulated on NSCLC, pancreatic 
and breast cancer cell lines.  Collectively, these preclinical mechanistic studies indicate th at Imprime PGG acts as a PAMP 
to enlist the full functionality of the innate immune system, t o generate cross-talk with the 
adaptive immune system via enhan ced antigen presentation and th ereby to boost the anti-tumor 
efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors.  Clinical Experience to Date   Clinical benefit of Imprime PGG in NSCLC was demonstrated when Imprime PGG was added 
to carboplatin, paclitaxel, and cetuximab in a Phase 2 study of  90 patients with previously 
untreated stage IIIb/IV NSCLC. P atients received cetuximab with out or with Imprime PGG 4 
mg/kg (2:1 randomization) on Days 1, 8, 15 of each 3-week treat ment cycle with carboplatin 
and paclitaxel on Day 2 of each treatment cycle for the first 4  to 6 cycles.  If patients achieved

Page 19 of 68 radiographic stability or respon se they received cetuximab or c etuximab/Imprime PGG 
maintenance treatment. Among al l evaluable patients, median ove rall survival was 11.7 
months in the control group and 12.4 months in the Imprime PGG group (hazard ratio of 1.04, 
p=0.90 vs. control). The objective RR (ORR) based on the invest igator radiology review of the 
primary efficacy population was 48% in the Imprime PGG group co mpared to 23% in the 
control group (p = 0.047 vs. control). Thr ee-year survival could  not be estimated in the control 
group and was 14% in the Imprime group. Adverse events were con sistent with toxicities 
attributable to the carbopla tin, paclitaxel, or cetuximab.37 
 In another multicenter, open-labe l, international,  Phase 2 tria l with 92 patients, Imprime PGG 
in carboplatin and paclitaxel and bevacizumab was compared to c hemotherapy and 
bevacizumab alone in patients w ith previously untreated stage I IIb/IV non-squamous NSCLC.  
In 3-week treatment cycles, patients received the standard dose  of bevacizumab on Day 1, and 
standard doses of carboplatin and paclitaxel on Day 2 for 4 to 6 cycles, with or without Imprime 
PGG 4 mg/kg (2:1 randomization) on Days 1, 8 and 15.  Based on central independent 
radiology review of the primar y efficacy population, Imprime PG G improved overall RR by 
approximately 17% percentage points (60.4% vs 43.5% in control group, p-value 0.2096). The 
duration of response was increased by 4.7 months in the Imprime  PGG group (10.3 months vs 
5.6 in control group; p-value 0.940 ).  There was also a trend t owards improved PFS (11.6 
months in Imprime PG G group vs 9.6 months i n control group; p-v alue 0.5639) and OS (16.1 
months in Imprime PGG group vs 11.6 months in control group; ha zard ratio 0.66; p-value 
0.1345), yielding a 34% reduction in  the risk of death. Rates o f overall and serious adverse 
events were similar between group s and were reflective of expec ted toxicities with the standard 
of care backbone therapy or comp lications of patients underlyin g cancer. The incidence of 
grade 3 or higher toxicities was  higher in the Imprime PGG grou p overall with no clear 
preponderance of any specific or gan system (93.2% vs 66.7%). Fa tal adverse events in the 
Imprime PGG group were associated with progression of patient’s  lung cancer. Overall, no 
significant increase in toxicity with the exception of grade 3/ 4 neutropenia (39% versus 26.7%) 
was observed.
38 
 Imprime PGG Dosing Schedule After 12 weeks (4 cycles) of week ly dosing of Imprime PGG durin g Phase II, the compound 
will be administered on a 3-weekly schedule coinciding with and  preceding the administration 
of pembrolizumab on the first day of each cycle. The change to q3wk dosing during the Phase 
II aligns with the q3wk dosing of  pembrolizumab and will follow  two response assessments 
by RECIST v1.1 (CTs will be done prior to initiation of dosing a t  C y c l e  3  a n d  C y c l e  5 ) .  
Previous clinical experience with Imprime PGG in NSCLC indicate  that most observed clinical 
responses have occurre d within the first 12 weeks of dosing. Th ere are no concerns that this 
change would negatively impact patient safety. This change is i ntended to explore whether 
parameters of innate immune responses (cytokines, chemokines, m yeloid cell mobilization, 
complement activation, etc.) are maintained on a 3-week schedul e with maintenance of clinical 
benefits in a more convenientl y manageable clinical schedule.

1.2. Study Rationale  
There is recent convincing evide nce that anti-PD -1 antibodies, like pembrolizumab, have efficacy in 
treating NSCLC. Imprime PGG improved the overall response rates  and improved trends towards 
PFS and overall survival when giv en in conjunction with standar d of care NSCLC therapy. Imprime 
PGG also increased PD-L1 expression in NSCLC cell lines. In add ition, preclinical mechanistic 
studies have revealed that Imprime PGG acts as a PAMP to enlist  the full functionality of the innate 
immune system, enhancing dendritic cell maturation and antigen presentation and eliciting T cell 
expansion to boost the anti-tumor efficacy of checkpoint inhibi tors. The present study is an 
exploratory single-arm study cons isting of a dose escalation Ph ase 1b component and a Phase 2 
component for combination thera py of pembrolizumab and Imprime PGG. The primary endpoint for 
the Phase Ib component is the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of I mprime PGG in combination with 
pembrolizumab. For the Phase II component of the study, based u pon the scientific evidence for 
Imprime PGG’s therapeutic effect , we hypothesize that addition of Imprime PGG to pembrolizumab 
will enhance therapeutic responses to pembrolizumab in second l ine setting of NSCLC.

5. OVERALL DESIGN AND  TREATMENT PLAN   
 
5.1. Phase Ib Dose Escalation Study 
This Phase Ib dose escalation study will evaluate pembrolizumab  in combination with Imprime 
PGG in subjects with metastatic NSCLC after failure of first-li ne platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Imprime PGG will be given on Day 1, 8 and 15 and pembrolizumab will be given on Day 1 of each 
21-day cycle. Treatment will con tinue until disease progression , unacceptable toxicity, subject 
refusal, or subject death either  from progression of disease, t he therapy itself, or from other causes, 
or completion of 16 cycles of t reatment. Subjects who voluntari ly stop the study, have progressive 
disease, or unacceptable toxicities will be followed for up to 5 years from the start of study 
medication.

2 3-6 4 mg/kg 200 
 5.1.1.  Dose Escalation Rules and MTD Definition 
 Three to six subjects will initially be enrolled at dose level 1. If none of the 3 subjects 
experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first cycl e of therapy, an additional 
three subjects will be enrolled at dose level 2. If all subject s in dose level 2 complete the 
first cycle of therapy without DLT, 3 more subjects will be enr olled into dose level 2 to 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium BTCRC-LUN15-017 Version Date  29OCT2020 
Confidential  
Page 26 of 68 ensure only 0-1 of 6 subjects have a DLT. There will be no furt her escalation beyond dose 
level 2.  
 Alternatively, if 1 o f the first 3 subjects  within a dose level  cohort experiences a DLT, the 
cohort will be expanded to 6 subj ects. If this happens within d ose level 1 and only 1 of the 
total 6 subjects in dose level 1 experience DLT, the study will  proceed to dose level 2. If 2 
or more of 6 subjects in a cohort experience DLTs, or 2 subject s within a cohort of 3 
subjects experience DLT during th e first cycle of therapy (>33%  of subjects experiencing 
DLT), the MTD is exceeded. If this occurs at dose level 2, 3 ad ditional subjects will be 
enrolled into dose level 1, unless there have been 6 subjects a lready enrolled into dose level 
1.  
 The maximum tolerated dose of Imp rime PGG in combination with p embrolizumab is the 
highest tested dose of Imprime PGG combined with pembrolizumab with DLT rate of less 
than 33% in first cycle of therapy (i.e., ≤1 out of 6 subjects with DLT). That dose will be 
recommended for the Phase II study.   
 At the discretion of the sponsor-investigator, a lower phase II  dose may be recommended 
if other toxicity emerges during the Phase Ib study which does not meet DLT criteria but 
limits the dose that can be ad ministered cumulatively. 
 
5.1.2.  Definition of Dose Limiting Toxicity 
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as one of the following  events occurring during cycle 
1:   
 Grade 3 or greater treatment-related excluding : 
o Grade 3-4 nausea and/or vomit ing that resolves in 72 hours. 
o Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities that are not clinically sign ificant and which resolve 
in 72 hours. 
o Grade 3 fatigue lasting < 5 days. 
 Delay of cycle 2 tr eatment start by more than 2 week s due to un resolved treatment related 
grade 3 or greater non-he matologic toxicity. 
 DLTs will be counted based on the number of subjects with DLT a t a given dose level, not the 
absolute number of DLTs. No singl e subject can trigger more tha n one DLT event.  
 Additional subject cohorts will not be enrolled at the second d osing level until all subjects at 
the initial dosing level complete all planned treatment for cyc le 1 (defined as 1 dose of 
pembrolizumab, and 3 doses of Imprime PGG) and are able to star t cycle 2 with  no more than 
a 2-week delay.  Intra-subject dose escalation is not permitted.  Once the maximum tolerated dose of pembrolizumab in combination  with Imprime PGG is 
determined, enrollment will continue until at least 6 subjects total are accrued at the maximum 
tolerated dose.

5.2. Phase II Study 
The primary objective of the Phase  II trial is to determine the  activity of the combination of 
pembrolizumab and Imprime PGG in second line therapy for subjec ts with NSCLC as assessed by 
progression-free survival (PFS). Pembrolizumab will be given on  Day 1 of each 21 day cycle after 
Imprime PGG, and the RP2D dose of Imprime PGG will be given on Days 1, 8 and 15 for Cycles 
1-4, and on Day 1 only for Cycles 5-16 of each 21 day cycle. Tr eatment will continue up to 16 
cycles, or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, su bject refusal, or subject death either 
from progression of dis ease, the therapy it self, or from other causes. Subjects w ho voluntarily stop 
the study, have progressive diseas e, or unacceptable toxicities  will be followed for a total of 5 years.  
 
5.3. Correlative Research (all phases) 
Correlative research analyses include examining the relationshi p between clinical response at the 
end of Cycle 2 (Week 6) with biomarkers on immune cell subsets (including, but not limited to 
monocytes, macrophages, granulocyt es, and lymphocytes, and PD-L 1) concentrations and 
localization (peri- vs. intratumoral) in archived diagnostic tu mor tissue with PFS and CBR. 
Research analyses also include e xamining the relationship betwe en changes in soluble PD-L1 level 
and PD-L1 expression on circulating mononuclear cells at baseli ne (i.e., pre-dose Day 1 of Cycle 
1) and during therapy (assessed pre-dose on Da y 1 of Cycles 2 a nd 3) and correla ted with PFS and 
to CBR. Additionally, baseline immune classifiers, Fc RIIa polymorphism, and anti-β-glucan 
antibody (ABA) (IgM, IgG) levels  will be correlated with PFS an d CBR.  
 
5.4. Imprime PGG Pre-medication  
Each cycle will be 3 weeks in duration. The most common adverse  events leading to treatment 
discontinuation of Imprime PGG in clinical trials as of the Imp rime PGG Investigator’s Brochure 
Edition 10 (October 29, 2014) included infusion related reactio ns/hypersensitivity  (rash, nausea, 
dyspnea, tachycardia, urticaria, hypersensitivity). In addition , in a trial comparing Imprime PGG in 
combination with bevacizumab and concomitant paclitaxel and car boplatin (BPC) versus the BPC 
chemotherapy combination without  Imprime PGG, events potentiall y associated with 
hypersensitivity reactions occurred more frequently in the Impr ime PGG arm. These included one 
grade 3 event of anaphylactic reac tion deemed related to Imprim e PGG. Based on this, Imprime PGG 
premedication is recommended, but  not mandated. Subjects may re ceive pre-medication as outlined 
below before dosing of Imprime PGG on each treatment day and as  needed post-dosing. 
 
 Cycle 1/Day 1: Pretreat with an H1 antagonist (e.g., 25- 50 mg of diphenhydramine PO or IV) 
along with ranitidine (or equi valent) 50 mg IV or 150 mg PO. 
 Subsequent cycles: Premedication is allowed but preferably woul d be at reduced doses of those 
used at Cycle 1 Day 1.

 Subsequent cycles must meet the  criteria found in section 6.1 a nd may begin 1 day earlier or 
up to 2 days later to accommoda te scheduling issues. 
 For All Phases of Study: 
 Please note that the infusion timeline is approximate and may v ary depending on the 
individual subject (weight and r eaction to former treatment wit h study drugs may alter 
length of treatment a nd monitoring).  
 
 The Imprime PGG dose should be re calculated if t he subject’s we ight changes by ≥ 10%.   
 
5.5.3.  Monitoring:  
 Vital signs including blood pre ssure, pulse, temperature, respi rations, and pulse oximetry, 
will be measured as follows:  
o Imprime PGG infusion: prior to infusion, every 2 hours during i nfusion (±15 min), and 
within 30 minutes of the completion of the Imprime PGG infusion  (and prior to 
pembrolizumab infusion). 
o Pembrolizumab infusion: prior to infusion (NOTE: this can be sa me as the post 
Imprime PGG infusion timepoint ) and within 10 minutes of infusi on completion.  
 Subjects will be closely monitore d for toxicities. Toxicity wil l be assessed using CTCAE 
version 4.  
 
5.6. Supportive Care 
Optimal care should be given to all subjects.  Nausea/vomiting: Nausea and vomi ting should be treated aggressi vely, and consideration should be 
given in subsequent cycles to the administration of prophylacti c antiemetic therapy according to 
standard institutional practice.  If prophylactic antiemetic the rapy is needed, 5-HT3 receptor 
antagonists (without corticosteroi ds) should be tried first. Du e to the potential of benzodiazepines to 
cause sedation, the use of benzodiazepines for antiemetic proph ylaxis should be reserved for subjects 
who cannot be satisfactorily managed otherwise.  Subjects should be strongly  encouraged to maintain 
liberal oral fluid intake.  Subjects should receive full s upportive care during the study, including transfusion of blood and 
blood products, treatment with an tibiotics, analgesics, erythro poietin, or bisphosphonates, when 
appropriate.   Although acetaminophen at doses of ≤2 grams/day is permitted, i t should be used with caution in 
subjects with impaire d liver function.

Page 30 of 68  
5.6.1.  Pembrolizumab Supportive Care 
Subjects should receive appropr iate supportive care measures as  deemed necessary by the 
treating investigator. Suggested  supportive care measures for t he management of adverse 
events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined in Tabl e 4.  
 Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with 
corticosteroids as well as additional anti-inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with 
administration of corticosteroids . Note that several courses of  steroid tapering may be 
necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decre ased. For each disorder, 
attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metast atic disease or bacterial or viral 
infection, which might require a dditional suppor tive care. The treatment guidelines are 
intended to be applied when the investigator determines the eve nts to be related to 
pembrolizumab.   NOTE : if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be rel ated, the investigator does 
not need to follow the treatment  guidance (as outlined in Table  4). 
 It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as b ronchoscopy, endoscopy, or 
skin photography as part of evaluation of the event.  
 
5.7. Concomitant Medications 
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the excl usion criteria are not allowed during 
the ongoing trial. If there is a clinical indication for one of  these or other medica tions or vaccinations 
specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be 
required. The investigator should discuss any questions regardi ng this with the sponsor-investigator 
by contacting the BTCRC Project M anager. The final decision on any supportive therapy or 
vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the subject's pr imary physician. 
 5.7.1.  Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a subject’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of  the investigator in keeping w ith the community standards of 
medical care. All concomitant medications will be recorded on t he electronic case report form 
(eCRF).   All concomitant medications received within 28 days before the first dose of trial treatment 
and 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment should be re corded. Concomitant medications 
administered beyond 30 days after the last dose of trial treatm ent should be recorded for SAEs 
and ECIs as defined in Section 11.   Myeloid growth factors to treat subjects with neutropenia accor ding to the American Society

Medications with potential CNS eff ects are not prohibited in th is study, but it is recommended 
that their use be minimized to av oid confusion in the interpret ation of CNS effects should they 
occur during the course of trea tment with pembro lizumab and Imp rime PGG. 
 In appropriate settings, such a s combinations with agents known  to produce frequent 
thrombocytopenia, restricted us es of anticoagulants should be c onsidered.  
 All other medical cond itions should be treated at the discretio n of the investigator in 
accordance with local community standards of medical care.  
 
5.7.2.  Prohibited Concomitant Medications 
Subjects are prohibited from rece iving the following therapies during the Screening and 
Treatment Phase of this trial: 
 Anti-cancer systemic chemothera py or biological  therapy not spe cified in this protocol 
 Immunotherapy not specifi ed in this protocol 
 Concomitant use of chemotherapy  
 Investigational agents ot her than Imprime PGG 
 Radiation therapy  
o Note: Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may be allowed 
after consultation with sponsor-i nvestigator via the BTCRC Proj ect Manager.  
 Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial t reatment and while participating 
in the trial. Examples of live v accines include, but are not li mited to, the following: measles, 
mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typ hoid (oral) vaccine. 
Seasonal influenza vaccines for  injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are 
allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. Flu-Mist
®) are live attenuated 
vaccines and are not allowed.  
 Systemic glucocorticoids for a ny purpose other th an to modulate  symptoms from an event 
of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology. The use  of physiologic doses of 
corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the spo nsor-investigator via the 
BTCRC Project Manager.  
 Subjects who, in the assessment  by the investigator, require th e use of any of the 
aforementioned treatments for cl inical management should be rem oved from the trial. 
 There are no prohibited therapi es during the Post-Treatment Fol low-up Phase. 
 
5.8. Diet/Activity/Other Considerations 
 Diet Subjects should maintain a norma l diet unless modifications are  required to manage an AE such as 
diarrhea, nausea , or vomiting. 
 Contraception: Pembrolizumab may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero . Furthermore, it is not known if 
pembrolizumab has tran sient adverse effect s on the composition of sperm.  
 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium BTCRC-LUN15-017 Version Date  29OCT2020 
Confidential  
Page 32 of 68 It is not known if Imprime PGG has adverse effects on a fetus in utero  nor if there are adverse effects 
on the composition of sperm.   Non-pregnant, non-breast-feeding women may be enrolled if they are willing to use 2 methods of 
birth control or are considere d highly unlikely to conceive. Hi ghly unlikely to conceive  is defined as 
1) surgically sterilized (hystere ctomy, bilateral tubal ligatio n, or bilateral oophorectomy), or 2) 
postmenopausal (a woman who is ≥45 years of age and has not had  menses for greater than 12 
consecutive months), or 3) not heterosexually active for the du ration of the study and at least 120 
days after the last dose of study drug. The two birth control m ethods can be either two barrier methods 
or a barrier method plus a horm onal method to prevent pregnancy . Subjects should start using birth 
control from the first study visit, throughout the study period , and up to 120 days after the last dose 
of study drug.   The following are considered ade quate barrier methods of contra ception: diaphragm, condom (by the 
partner), copper intrauterine d evice, sponge, or spermicide. Ap propriate hormonal contraceptives will 
include any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that co ntains an estrogen and/or a 
progestational agent (including or al, subcutaneous, intrauterin e, or intramusc ular agents). 
 Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication ma y involve unknown risks to the fetus 
(unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study. In o rder to participate in the study they 
must adhere to the con traception requirements described above f or the duration of the study and 120 
days following the last dose of study drug. If there is any que stion that a subject will not reliably 
comply with the requirements for  contraception, that subject sh ould not be entered into the study. 
 Use in Pregnancy: If a subject inadvertently become s pregnant while on study, the  subject will immediately be removed 
from the study. The site will contact the subject at least mont hly and document the subject’s status 
until the pregnancy has been compl eted or terminated. The outco me of the pregnancy will be reported 
to BTCRC Administrative Headqua rters (AHQ) immediately and with in 24 hours if the outcome is a 
serious adverse experience (e .g., death, abortion, congenital a nomaly, or other disabling or life-
threatening complication to the mother or newborn). The study i nvestigator will make every effort to 
obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and re port the condition of the fetus or 
newborn to BTCRC AHQ. B TCRC AHQ will report the event to Merck and HiberCell. 
 If a male subject impregnates his female partner, he must immed iately inform the site study personnel 
and the pregnancy reported to BTCRC AHQ and to Merck and follow ed as described above and in 
Section 11. BTCRC AHQ will report th e event to Merck and HiberC ell. 
 
Use in Nursing Women: 
It is unknown whether pembrolizumab or Imprime PGG is excreted in human milk. Since many drugs 
are excreted in human milk, and b ecause of the potential for se rious adverse reacti ons in the nursing 
infant, subjects who are breast- feeding are not eligible for en rollment.

6. DOSE DELAYS  
The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4 will be used to grade 
adverse events.  Subjects enrolled in this study wi ll be evaluated clinically an d with standard laborato ry tests before and at 
regular intervals during their pa rticipation i n this study as s pecified in Section 7. 
 Subjects will be evaluated for adverse events (all grades), ser ious adverse events, and adverse events 
requiring protocol therapy interr uption or discontinuation at e ach study visit for the duration of their 
participation in the study.    Subjects discontinued from the treatment phase of the study for  any reason will be evaluated 30 days (± 
7) after the last dose of protocol therapy.  
6.1. Start of a New Cycle 
A new treatment cycle will only b e initiated when all of the fo llowing conditions are met: 
 ANC ≥ 1,000× 109/L  
 platelets ≥ 80 × 109/L  
 non-hematologic treatment related  ≥ grade 3 toxicities need to improve to either ≤ Grade 1 or as 
specified in table 4 or to the s ubject’s baseline values (excep t alopecia) 
 
If toxicities are outside the acceptable threshold, the subject  should be assessed weekly (phone or 
clinic) until toxicities are at an acceptable level. Missed dos es will not be made up. If treatment is 
unable to restart within 12 weeks of the planned treatment date , the subject will be permanently 
discontinued from study therapy (both pembrolizumab and Imprime  PGG should be stopped).   
 NOTE :  For cycle 1 only, the inability to start cycle 2 within 2 we eks of the planned date is a DLT; 
however, the subject is allowed an additional week of recovery and is allowed to remain on study if 
treatment restarts within 12 weeks.  
6.2. Management of Allergic Rea ction/ Hypersensitivity 
 6.2.1.  Imprime PGG 
In case of severe adverse events  during infusion of Imprime PGG , the infusion may be interrupted at 
the discretion of the treating physician for 30-60 minutes and restarted when the adverse event has 
resolved. Alternatively, the infu sion rate may be decreased by 50% instead of, or after, interruption 
at the discretion of the trea ting physician.  Management of adv erse events should include treatments 
as indicated by symptoms. 
 An appropriate resuscitation pl an should in place and a physici an readily availabl e during the period 
of drug administration. 
 
6.2.2.  Pembrolizumab 
Pembrolizumab may cause severe or  life-threatening infusion-rea ctions including severe 
hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis. S igns and symptoms usually dev elop during or shortly after drug 
infusion and generally resolve  completely within 24 hours of co mpletion of infusion.

6.4. Dose Modifications 
6.4.1.  Pembrolizumab Dose Modifications  
Adverse events (both non-serious and serious) associated with p embrolizumab exposure  may 
represent an immunologic etiology. These immune-related AEs (ir AEs) may occur shortly after the 
first dose or several months after the last dose of pembrolizum ab treatment and may affect more than 
on body system simultaneously. Ther efore, early recognition and  initiation of treatment is critical to 
reduce complications.  Based on existing clinical study data, m ost irAEs were reversible and could 
be managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, administration of corticosteroids and/or other 
supportive care. For suspected irA Es, ensure adequate evaluatio n to confirm etiology or exclude other 
causes. Additional procedures or tests such as bronchoscopy, en doscopy, skin biopsy may be included 
as part of the evaluation. Base d on the severity of irAEs, with hold or permanently discontinue 
pembrolizumab and administer corticosteroids. Dose modification  and toxicity management 
guidelines for irAEs associate d with pembrolizumab are provided  in Table 4 below.

Page 36 of 68 Table 4: Dose modification and to xicity management guidelines f or immune-related AEs associated with pembrolizumab. 
General instructions: 
1. Corticosteroid taper should be initiated upon AE improving to G rade 1 or less and continue to taper over at least 4 weeks. 
2. For situations where pembrolizumab has been withheld, pembroliz umab can be resumed after AE has  been reduced to Grade 1 or 0 a nd corticosteroid has 
been tapered. Pembrolizumab should be permanently discontinued if AE does not resolve within 12 weeks of last dose or corticos teroids cannot be 
reduced to ≤10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day within 12 we eks.  
3. For severe and life-threatening irAEs, IV corticosteroid should  be initiated first followed by o ral steroid. Other immunosuppr essive treatment should be 
initiated if irAEs cannot be c ontrolled by corticosteroids.

8. CRITERIA FOR DISEASE EVALUATION 
Response assessments will be made using RECIST v1.1. The same m easurable and non-measurable 
lesions will be followed by RECI ST v1.1. Disease progression wi ll be determined using RECIST v1.1 
criteria.  
8.1. Definitions Associated with Resp onse Evaluation Criteria in Sol id Tumors (RECIST) v. 1.1 
8.1.1.  Measurable disease 
The presence of at least one measurable lesion. If the measurab le disease is restricted to a 
solitary lesion, its neoplastic  nature should be confirmed by c ytology/histology.  
8.1.1.1.  Measurable lesions:  
Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least 
one dimension (longest diameter to  be recorded) as >20 mm by ch est x-ray, as >10 
mm with CT scan, or >10 mm with calipers by clinical exam.  All  tumor 
measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fracti ons of centimeters).  
8.1.1.2.  Non-measurable lesions:  
Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium BTCRC LUN15-017 Version Date  29OCT2020 
Confidential  
Page 44 of 68 All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesion s (longest diameter <10 
mm or pathological lymph nodes w ith ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis),  are considered 
non-measurable disease.  Bone les ions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, ly mphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, i nflammatory breast 
disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non-
measurable.  
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographical ly defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as mali gnant lesions (neither measurab le nor non-
measurable) since they are , by definition, simple cysts.  
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to repre sent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurabilit y described above. 
However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same subject,  these are preferred for 
selection as target lesions. 
8.1.1.3.  Malignant lymph nodes.   
To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymp h node must be >15 
mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickn ess recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, onl y the short axis will be 
measured and followed.  
8.1.1.4.  Baseline documentation of “Targe t” and “Non-Target” lesions:  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ a nd 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  a n d  
recorded and measured at baseline.   
Target lesions . Target lesions should be selecte d on the basis of their size (l esions 
with the longest diameter), be re presentative of all involved o rgans, but in addition 
should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated m easurements.  It may 
be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend  itself to reproducible 
measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which  can be measured 
reproducibly should be selected.   A sum of the diameters (longe st for non-nodal 
lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions w ill be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, 
then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline s um diameters will be 
used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor r egression in the 
measurable dimension of the disease. Non-target lesions . All other lesions (or sites of d isease) including any measurabl e 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identifie d as non-target lesions 
and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these  lesions are not 
required, but the presence, absence , or in rare cases unequivoc al progression of each 
should be noted throughout follow-up.

Page 45 of 68 8.2. Response Criteria for Target Lesions 
 
8.2.1.  Evaluation of Target Lesions: 
 
Table 5: Target Lesions Eval uation Response Criteria 
Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all target l esions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have 
reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in t he sum of the diameters 
of target lesions, taking as r eference the baseline sum 
diameters 
Progressive Disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the  sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as r eference the smallest sum on 
study (this includes the base line sum if that is the 
smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum m ust also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). 
Stable Disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrink age to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qu alify for PD, taking as 
reference the smallest s um diameters while on study 
 
8.2.2.  Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions: 
 
Table 6: Non-Target Lesion E valuation Response Criteria 
Response Criteria Evaluati on of non-target lesions 
* Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level 
* Incomplete Response/    Stable Disease (SD) Persistence of one or more non-target 
lesion(s) or/and mai ntenance of tumor 
marker level above t he normal limits 
* Progressive Disease (PD) Appearance of one or more new lesions 
and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions* 
* Although a clear progression of “n on-target” le sions only is exceptional, the opinion 
of the treating physician should pr evail in such c ircumstances.  
 
8.3. Evaluation of Best Overall Response: 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from th e start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest  measurements recorded since the 
treatment started). In general, the subject's best response ass ignment will depend on the achievement 
of both measurement and c onfirmation criteria.

*In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non-t arget lesions may be accepted 
as disease progression.  
 
Subjects with a global deteriora tion of health status requiring  discontinuation of t reatment without 
objective evidence of disease pr ogression at that time should b e classified as having  “symptomatic 
deterioration.” Every effort s hould be made to document the obj ective progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment. In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residu al disease from normal tissue. When the 
evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual 
lesion be investigated (fine need le aspirate/biopsy) to confirm  the complete response status. 
 
8.4. Definitions for Response Eval uation –RECIST version 1.1 
 
8.4.1.  First Documentation of Response:  
The time between initiation of t herapy and first documentation of PR or CR.  
8.4.2.  Confirmation of Response:  
To be assigned a status of comple te or partial re sponse, change s in tumor measurements must 
be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than four weeks after the criteria for 
response are first met. 
8.4.3.  Duration of Response:  
Duration of overall response—the period measured from the time that measurement criteria 
are met for complete or partial response (whichever status is r ecorded first) until the date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (tak ing as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurement s recorded since treatment star ted). 
8.4.4.  Duration of Overall Complete Response:  
The period measured from the time  that measurement criteria are  met for complete response 
until the first date that progressive disease is objectively do cumented.  
8.4.5.  Response rate:  
The response rate is the proportion of all subjects with confir med PR or CR according to 
RECIST v1.   
Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium BTCRC LUN15-017 Version Date  29OCT2020 
Confidential  
Page 47 of 68 8.4.6.  Clinical Benefit Rate: 
The proportion of subjects with a c onfirmed complete response, a partial response or stable 
disease based on RECIST v1.1. 
8.4.7.  Progression-Free Survival: 
A measurement from the start of the treatment until the criteri a for disease progression is met 
as defined by RECIST v1.1 or death occurs. Subjects who have no t progressed will be right-
censored at the date of the last disease evaluation. Subjects t hat receive at least one dose of 
study treatment and complete 1 post-baseline disease assessment  or die prior to the first post 
baseline disease assessment will  be considered evaluable for PF S. 
8.4.8.  Overall Survival 
A measurement from the start of  the treatment un til death from any cause. Subjects alive at 
last time of contact will be right-censored. 
  
9. BIOLOGICAL CORRELATIVES

weight. Withdraw a volume of the  0.9% NS equal to the calculate d Imprime PGG dose volume 
(from Step 1) and discard the withdrawn NS solution. 
 Example A  (For weight <75 kg): Since subject weighs 70 kg, a 500 mL 0.9%  NS bag should 
be used. Withdraw and discard 280 mL s of NS from the 500 mL NS bag. 
 Example B  (For weight >75 kg, up to ≤150 kg): Since subject weighs 100 k g, a 750 mL 0.9% 
NS bag should be used. Withdraw  and discard 400 mLs of NS from the 750 mL NS bag. 
 Example C  (For weight >150 kg): Since subject weighs 160 kg, a 1000 mL 0 .9% NS bag 
should be used. Withdraw and discard 640 mLs of NS from the 100 0 mL NS bag. 
 3. Withdraw the calculated Imprime  PGG dose volume from the Imprim e PGG vials (from Step 1). 
 Example A
 (For weight <75 kg): From a tot al of 6 50-mL vials of Imprime PGG, withdraw 
the required 280 mg (280 mLs) and inject the Imprime PGG into t he NS bag and mix gently. 
 Example B  (For weight >75 kg, up to ≤150 kg): From a total of 8 50-mL vi als of Imprime 
PGG, withdraw the required 400 mg (400 mLs) and inject the Impr ime PGG into the NS bag 
and mix gently. 
 Example C  (For weight >150 kg): From a total of 13 50-mL vials of Imprim e PGG, withdraw 
the required 640 mg (640 mLs) and inject the Imprime PGG into t he NS bag and mix gently. 
 4. Label bag appropriately. 
 5. Attach a low protein binding 0.22- micrometer in-l ine filter to appropriate IV tubing, and using an 
infusion pump infuse at the rate determined by the total infusi on volume/infusion time described: 
 Example A  (For weight <75 kg): Since subject’s weight was 70 kg, a 500 m L total fluid 
volume was calculated. The le ngth of infusion will be 2 hours a t a rate of 4.2 mL/min.

Page 52 of 68  Example b  (For weight >75 kg, up to ≤150 kg): Since subject’s weight was  100 kg, a 750 mL 
total fluid volume was calculated. The length of infusion will be 3 hours at a rate of 4.2 
mL/min. 
 Example C  (For weight >150 kg): Since subject’s weight was 160 kg, a 100 0 mL total fluid 
volume was calculated. The le ngth of infusion will be 4 hours a t a rate of 4.2 mL/min. 
 6. When infusion is complete, flu sh tubing with additional NS to e nsure complete dosing.  
 Risks Imprime PGG is an investigationa l product that may only be used  under the terms defined in this 
protocol and associated IB.   To date, 84 of the 103 healthy s ubjects enrolled into the Impri me PGG studies have been administered 
at least one dose of Imprime PGG.  Of these 84 subjects, 27 subj ects were administered Imprime PGG 
alone and 57 subjects were admin istered Imprime PGG and concomi tant G-CSF (10 mcg/kg/day for 
four consecutive days). More specifically, 51 of the 84 subject s received single doses of Imprime 
PGG up to 6 mg/kg and 33 of the 84 subjects  received multiple d oses of Imprime PGG (single doses 
administered on either 2 days, 4 consecutive days, or 7 consecu tive days) in doses up to 4 mg/kg. 
With regard to the 19 subjects receiving only placebo, 10 of th ese subjects were concomitantly also 
administered G-CSF (10 mg/kg/da y for four consecutive days). Im prime PGG administration has 
demonstrated no tendency to resu lt in life-threatening AEs, SAE s, or AEs of severe intensity in 
healthy volunteers.   In a metastatic CRC subject population, to date, 50 subjects ha ve been administered Imprime PGG 
in the completed CRC0713 and CRC0821 studies. Subjects in the c ompleted studies have been dosed 
for up to 64 weeks in combination with a standard regimen of ce tuximab and irinotecan, or cetuximab 
alone. In the ongoing CRC1031 study , 141 subjects have received  the combination of Imprime PGG 
plus standard regimen of cetuximab.   In an NSCLC subject population, to date, 118 subjects have been  administered Imprime PGG in the 
ongoing studies LCA0821 and LCA0822. Subjects have been dosed f or up to 69 weeks in 
combination with a standard regimen of bevacizumab, carboplatin  and paclitaxel, and up to 54 weeks 
in combination with a standard r egimen of cetuximab, carboplati n and paclitaxel.   
 Subjects should be continuously m onitored for AEs and/or any sa fety concerns. 
 Warnings and Precautions The drug is considered to be gene rally safe and well-tolerated.

 Side Effects Please refer to the current version of the Investigator’s Broch ure for a complete list of adverse events. 
 
Pembrolizumab is generally well tolerated and demonstrates a fa vorable safety profile in comparison 
to chemotherapy. Pembrolizumab is an immunomodulatory agent, an d based on this mechanism of 
action, immune mediated adverse events are of primary concern. Important identified risks for 
pembrolizumab are of an immune mediate nature, including: pneum onitis, colitis, hepatitis, nephritis, 
endocrinopathies that include adrenal insufficiency (primary an d secondary) and hypophysitis 
(including hypopituitarism), thyroid disorder (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis), Type 
I diabetes mellitus, uveitis, myositis, Guillain-Barre Syndrome , pancreatitis, myocar ditis, myasthenic 
syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), encephalit is, sarcoidosis, severe skin reactions 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium BTCRC LUN15-017 Version Date  29OCT2020

Page 54 of 68 including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal ne crolysis (TEN), some with fatal 
outcome; and “solid organ trans plant rejection following pembro lizumab treatment in donor organ 
recipients” (risk applicable to post-marketing setting only, as  such patients are currently excluded from 
Merck clinical trials with pembrolizumab).   Immune-mediated adverse reactions (ARs), including severe and f atal cases, have occurred in patients 
receiving pembrolizumab. Immune-mediated ARs can occur after di scontinuation of treatment. 
Immune-mediated ARs affecting more than one body system can occ ur simultaneously. In clinical 
studies, most immune-mediated ARs were reversible and managed w ith interruptions of 
pembrolizumab, administration of corticosteroids, and/or suppor tive care. 
 The risk profile for pembrolizumab also includes 2 important po tential risks – i.e. increased risk of 
severe complications (such as early severe graft versus host di sease and veno-occlusive disease) of 
allogeneic transplant in patients with hematologic malignancies  who have previously been treated with 
PD-1 inhibitors; and GVHD after pembrolizum ab administration in  patients with a history of 
allogeneic HSCT. 
 
One new identified risk of myelitis has been added to the Warni ngs and Precautions section of the 
Merck company core data sheet for pembrolizumab based on routin e pharmacovigilance. In addition, 
new ADRs of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada  syndrome and hemophagocytic ly mphohistiocytosis were 
identified based primarily on postmarketing reports. 
 Further details around frequency, reporting, and management of immune-related adverse events 
(irAEs) can be found in the curre nt version of the Investigator ’s Brochure. In addition to the 
previously noted identified ris ks, infusion-related reactions a re a risk but are not considered immune 
mediated; these are also furth er described in the current IB. 
 
11. ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
11.1. Definitions of Adverse Events:  
11.1.1.  Adverse Event (AE):  
An AE is any untoward medical oc currence whether or not conside red related to the study drug 
that appears to change in intens ity during the course of the st udy. The following are examples 
of AEs:  
 Unintended or unfavorable sign or symptom 
 A disease temporally associate d with participa tion in the proto col 
 An intercurrent illnes s or injury that imp airs the well-being o f the subject 
 Abnormal laboratory values or di agnostic test results constitut e AEs only if they induce clinical 
signs or symptoms or require tre atment or further diagnostic te sts   
 Hospitalization for elective sur gery or routine clinical proced ures that are not the result of an 
AE (e.g., surgical insertion of central line) should not be rec orded as an AE.  
 Disease progression should not be recorded as an AE, unless it is attributable to the study 
regimen by the site investigator.  
11.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  
Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium BTCRC LUN15-017 Version Date  29OCT2020 
Confidential  
Page 55 of 68 An SAE is an adverse event that:  
 Results in death. NOTE: Death due to disease progression should not be reported as a 
SAE, unless it is attributable  by the site investigator to the study drug(s) 
 Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject w as at risk of death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypotheticall y might have caused death if 
it were more severe) 
 Requires inpatient hospitalizatio n for >24 hours or prolongatio n of existing hospitalization. 
NOTE:  Hospitalization for anticipated or protocol specified procedur es such as 
administration of chemotherapy, central line insertion, metasta sis interventional therapy, 
resection of primary tumor, or elective surgery, will not be co nsidered serious adverse 
events. 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 Is a congenital anom aly or birth defect 
 Is an important medical event (de fined as a medical event(s) th at may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in d eath or hospitalization but, bas ed upon appropriate medical 
and scientific judgment, may je opardize the subject or may requ ire intervention (e.g., 
medical, surgical) to prevent one of the other serious outcomes  listed in the definition 
above). Examples of such events include, but are not limited to , intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for a llergic bronchospasm; blood dysc rasias or convulsions 
not resulting in hospitalization;  or the development of drug de pendency or drug abuse. 
 Pembrolizumab overdose. For purpo ses of this trial, an overdose  will be defined as any 
dose exceeding the prescribed dose for pembrolizumab by 20% ove r the prescribed dose. 
See section 11.3 for further details.  
 11.1.3.  Unexpected Adverse Event:  
For this study, an AE is consider ed unexpected when it varies i n nature, intensity or frequency 
from information provided in the current IB, package insert, or  when it is not included in the 
informed consent document as a potential risk. Unexpected also refers to AEs that are 
m e n t i o n e d  i n  t h e  I B  a s  o c c u r r i n g  w i t h  a  c l a s s  o f  d r u g s  o r  a r e  a nticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of t he drug, but are not specificall y mentioned as occurring with 
the particular drug under investigation. 
 11.1.4.  Relatedness 
AEs will be categorized according to the likelihood that they a re related to the study drug(s). 
Specifically, they will be categ orized using the following term s:  
 
Unrelated 
The Adverse Event is clearly not related  to the drug(s)  
Unlikely The Adverse Event is doubtfully related  to the drug(s)  
Possible The Adverse Event may be related  to the drug(s)  
Probable The Adverse Event is  likely related  to the drug(s)  
Definite The Adverse Event is clearly related  to the drug(s)

Page 56 of 68 11.2. Adverse Event (AE) Reporting:  
 Adverse events (AEs) will be recorded from the time of consent until 30 days after treatment 
discontinuation of study drugs or un til a new anti-cancer treat ment starts, whichever occurs first. 
 AEs will be recorded regardless of whether or not the event(s) are considered related to the study 
drugs.  
 All AEs will be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on  the appropriate study specific 
eCRF form within the EDC system. 
 All AEs considered related to study drugs will be followed unti l resolution to ≤ Grade 1 or 
baseline, deemed clinically ins i g n i f i c a n t ,  a n d / o r  u n t i l  a  n e w  a nti-cancer treatment starts, 
whichever is earlier. 
 
11.3. Definition and Reporting of a P embrolizumab Overdose:  
For purposes of this trial, an overdose will be defined as any dose exceeding the prescribed dose for 
pembrolizumab by 20% over the prescribed dose. No specific info rmation is available on the 
treatment of overdose of pembro lizumab. In the event of overdos e, subject should be observed closely 
for signs of toxicity. Appropria te supportive tr eatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  
 
 If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a Merck product, the 
adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even i f no other seriousness criteria are 
met. 
 If a dose of Merck’s product mee ting the protocol definition of  overdose is taken without any 
associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, th e overdose is reported as a non-
serious Event of Clinical Inter est (ECI), using the terminology  “accidental or intentional 
overdose without adverse effect.” 
 All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 1 working day to 
BTCRC Administrative Headquart ers (AHQ). BTCRC AHQ will report the event within 1 working 
day to Merck Global Safety (Attn : Worldwide Product Safety; FAX  215-993-1220). 
 
11.4. Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactation: 
Although pregnancy and lactation are not considered adverse eve nts, it is the responsibility of 
investigators or their designees  to report any pregnancy or lac tation in a subject (spontaneously 
reported to them), including the pregnancy of a male subject’s female partner that occurs during the 
trial or within 120 days of completing the trial, or 30 days fo llowing cessation of treatment if the 
subject initiates new anticancer  therapy, whichever is earlier.  All subjects and female partners of male 
subjects who become pregnant must be followed to the completion /termination of the pregnancy. 
Pregnancy outcomes of spontan eous abortion, missed abortion, be nign hydatidiform mole, blighted 
ovum, fetal death, intrauterine d eath, miscarriage, and stillbi rth must be reported as serious events 
(Important Medical Events). If th e pregnancy continues to term,  the outcome (health of infant) must 
also be reported.  Such events must be reporte d within 1 working day to BTCRC AHQ on the Pregnancy Report Form 
(See Documents/Info tab in the EDC). BTCRC AHQ will report the event within 1 working day to 
Merck Global Safety (Attn: Worl dwide Product Safety; FAX 215-99 3-1220). 
  
11.5. Definition and Reporting of Events of Clinical Interest (ECI): 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium BTCRC LUN15-017 Version Date  29OCT2020 
Confidential  
Page 57 of 68 Selected non-serious and serious adverse events are also known as Events of Clinical Interest (ECI) 
and must be recorded as such on the Adverse Event case report f orms/worksheets and reported to 
BTCRC AHQ within 1 working day of the event. Events of clinical interest for this trial include: 
1. An overdose of Merck product, as defined above, that is not ass ociated with clinical symptoms 
or abnormal laboratory results.  
2. An elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3 × the upper limit of normal, 
and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2 × the upper limit of 
normal, and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that is l ess than 2 × the upper 
limit of normal, as determined by way of protocol-specified lab oratory testing or unscheduled 
laboratory testing.* *NOTE:  These criteria are base d upon available regulatory guid ance documents. The purpose of 
the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic test s that may require an additional 
evaluation for an underlying etiology.  
 Subjects should be assessed for possible ECIs prior to each dos e. Lab results should be evaluated and 
subjects should be asked for signs and symptoms suggestive of a n immune-related event. Subjects 
who develop an ECI thought to be immune-related should have add itional testing to rule out other 
etiologic causes. If lab results  or symptoms indicate a possibl e immune-related ECI, then additional 
testing should be performed to rule out other etiologic causes.  If no other cause is found, then it is 
assumed to be immune-related.   ECIs that occur in any subject fr om the date of first dose thro ugh 90 days following cessation of 
treatment, or 30 days following cessation of treatment if the s ubject initiates a new anticancer therapy, 
whichever is earlier, whether or  not related to the Merck’s pro duct, must be reported within 1 working 
day to BTCRC AHQ. BTCRC AHQ will report the event within 1 work ing day to Merck Global 
Safety (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215-993-1220).  
11.6. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
 
11.6.1.  Site Requirements for Reporting S AEs to BTCRC Administrative He adquarters:

12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
12.1. Study Design: 
This is a single arm study. Phase Ib: The primary objective of the Phase Ib dose escalation cohort 
study is to establish the MTD of study drug Imprime PGG when us ed in combination with 
pembrolizumab for subjects with NSCLC after failure of first li ne platinum-based chemotherapy. A 
standard “3+3” design will be  used to establish the MTD.  
 Phase II: The primary objective of the Phase II trial is to est imate Progression-Free Survival (PFS) 
using RECIST v1.1 in subjects with metastatic non-small cell lu ng cancer (NSCLC) treated with 
Imprime PGG in combination with pembrolizumab after progression  on first-line systemic therapy 
(either platinum-based chemother apy with or without immune chec kpoint inhibitor or immune 
checkpoint inhibitor as first line therapy). Pembrolizumab will  be given on Day 1 and maximum 
tolerated dose of I mprime PGG will be given on Days 1, 8 and 15  for Cycles 1-4, and on Day 1 only 
for Cycles 5-16 of each 21 day cycle. Treatment continues until  16 cycles have been completed, 
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, subject refusal, or  subject death either from progression 
of disease, the therapy itself, or from other causes. Subjects who voluntarily stop the study, have 
progressive disease, or unacceptable toxicities will be followe d for a total of 5 years.   
 Correlative research analyses include examining the relationshi p between PFS and CBR to immune 
biomarker (NK cells, neutrophils, CD8+ T cells and PD-L1) conce ntrations as well as localization 
(peri- vs. intratumo ral) in the ar chived diagnostic tumor tissu e and tumor vascular  density. Research 
analyses also include examining the relationship between change s in soluble PD-L1 level and PD-L1 
expression on circulating mononuc lear cells at baseline (i.e., pre-dose Day 1 of Cycle 1) and during 
therapy (assessed pre-dose Cycles 2 and 3) and PFS and to CBR. Additionally, immune classifiers, 
FcRIIa polymorphism, and anti-β-g lucan antibody (ABA) (IgM, IgG) levels at will be correlated 
with PFS and CBR. 
 
12.2. Criteria for Stopping Study: 
The Phase Ib portion of the st udy will be stopped if 2 or more DLTs occur at dose level 1.  
 The Phase II portion of the study will be stopped if any grade 5 toxicity occurs which is thought to 
be directly attributable to the c ombination of Imprime PGG and pembrolizumab.  
 
12.3. Sample Size: 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium BTCRC LUN15-017 Version Date  29OCT2020 
Confidential  
Page 60 of 68 Phase Ib: A standard “3+3” design will be used with maximum num ber of subjects accrued to be 12. 
 Phase II: Study endpoint will be p rogression-fre e survival (PFS ), as assessed by the RECIST v1.1 
criteria. The null hypothesis is that median PFS of combination  drug is 3.2 months (equal to single 
agent pembrolizumab among subjects with a proportion score of 1  to 49%); the alternative hypothesis 
is that the PFS is 6.3 months (equal to single agent pembrolizu mab among subjects with a proportion 
score of ≥ 50%). 
 
The hypothesized median PFS is 6.3 months. With a total sample size of 24 we will have 90% power 
to detect a difference of 3.1 months (i.e., 6.3 months versus 3 .2 months) with a two-sided exponential 
MLE test, controlling for a type I error probability of 5%. The  power analysis was conducted using 
power calculation for one arm survival design proposed by Lawle ss.
39 
 Unevaluable subjects will be replaced.  
12.4. Analysis of Primary Objectives/Aims 
 Phase Ib Analysis of Primary Endpoint:  The primary endpoint is determina tion of the MTD of Imprime PGG . The MTD will be defined as 
the highest explored dose of Imprime PGG combined with 200 mg o f pembrolizumab at which ≤1 
out of 6 subjects have experienced  a  D L T  w i t h i n  t h e  f i r s t  c y c l e  of therapy. That dose will be 
recommended for the Phase II study (i.e., will be declared the RP2D). At the discretion of the sponsor-
investigator, a lower phase II dose may be recommended if other  toxicity emerges during the Phase 
Ib study which does not meet DLT criteria but limits the dose t hat can be administered cumulatively. 
 Phase II Analysis of Primary Endpoint:  The primary endpoint is determina tion of the activity of the co mbination of pembrolizumab and 
Imprime PGG in second line systemic therapy for NSCLC as assess ed by progression-free survival 
based on RECIST v1.1. Median PFS times will be computed with as sociated 95% confidence 
intervals. Kaplan-Meier curves will be plotted.  
 
12.5. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints: 
 
12.5.1.  Phase Ib Analysis of Secondary Endpoints

Page 63 of 68 There will be at least one visit within a year of the first sub ject accrual per site. Additional for-cause 
visits may occur as necessary. Source documents will be reviewe d for verification of agreement with 
data entered into the EDC system.  It is important for the site  investigator and their relevant personnel 
to be available for a sufficient amount of time during the moni toring visits or audit, if applicable. The 
site investigator and institution guarantee access to source do cuments by BTCRC AHQ or its 
designee.  The trial site may also be subject to quality assurance audit b y Merck, HiberCell,  or their designee as 
well as inspection by appropria te regulatory agencies. 
 
13.4. Compliance with Trial Registration and Results Posting Requirem ents 
Under the terms of the Food and Dr ug Administration Modernizati on Act (FDAMA) and the Food 
and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA), the sponsor-inv estigator of the trial is solely 
responsible for determining whet her the trial and its results a re subject to the requirements for 
submission to the Clinical Trials Data Bank, http://www.clinicaltrials.gov . The sponsor-investigator 
has delegated responsibility to BTCRC AHQ for registering the t rial and posting the results on 
clinicaltrials.gov. Information posted will allow subjects to i dentify potentially appr opriate trials for 
their disease conditions and pursue participation by calling a central contact number for further 
information on appropriate trial  locations and study site conta ct information.  
  
14. DATA HANDLING AND  RECORD KEEPING 
 
14.1. Data Management 
BTCRC AHQ will serve as the Clinical Research Organization for this trial. Data wi ll be collected 
through a web based clinical resea rch platform compliant with G ood Clinical Practices and Federal 
Rules and Regulations. Other study institutions will be given a  password to directly enter their own 
data onto the web site via elect ronic case report forms (eCRFs) . BTCRC AHQ personnel will 
coordinate and manage data for qua lity control assurance and in tegrity. 
 All data will be collected and e ntered into the EDC system by s tudy site personnel from 
participating institutions.  
14.2. Case Report Forms and Submission: 
An electronic case report form (eCRF) is required and must be c ompleted for each included subject. 
The completed dataset is housed  at BTCRC AHQ and is the sole pr operty of the sponsor-
investigator’s institution. It should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for 
authorized representatives of appropriate Health/Regulatory Aut horities, without permission from the 
sponsor-investigator and BTCRC AHQ.  After the initial publicati on, the complete data set will be 
available to all BTCRC institutions.  
14.3. Record Retention: 
To enable evaluations and/or aud its from Health Authorities/BTC RC AHQ, the investigator agrees 
to keep records, including the identity of all participating su bjects (sufficient information to link 
records; e.g., hospital records), all original signed informed consent forms, copies of all source 
documents, and detailed records of drug disposition. To comply with international regulations, the 
records should be retained by the  investigator in compliance wi th regulations. 
 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consortium BTCRC LUN15-017 Version Date  29OCT2020 
Confidential  
Page 64 of 68 During data entry, range and miss ing data checks will be perfor med on-line. The checks to be 
performed will be documented in the Data Monitoring Plan for th e study. A summary report (QC 
Report) of these checks together with any queries resulting fro m manual review of the eCRFs will be 
generated for each site and transmitted to the site and the sit e monitor. Corrections will be made by 
the study site personnel. This will be done on an ongoing basis . 
 
14.4. Confidentiality 
There is a slight risk of loss of confidentiality of subject in formation. All records identifying the 
subject will be kept confidentia l and, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws and/or regulations, 
will not be made public ly available.   
 Information collected will be maintained on secure, password pr otected electronic systems. Paper 
files that contain personal information will be kept in locked and secure locations only accessible to 
the study team. Samples that are c ollected will be identified b y a subject study number assigned at 
the time of registration to the trial. Any material issued to c ollaborating researchers will be 
anonymized and only identified by the subject study number. 
 Subjects will be informed in writing that some organizations in cluding the sponsor-investigator and 
his/her research associates, BTCRC AHQ, Merck, IRB, or governme nt agencies, like the FDA, may 
inspect their medical records to verify the information collect ed, and that all personal information 
made available for inspection wi ll be handled in strictest conf idence and in accordance with local 
data protection laws.  If the results of the  study are published, t he subject’s identi ty will remain confidential.

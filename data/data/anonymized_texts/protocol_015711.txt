 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
 
Full Title:   A Randomized Double -Blind Study Comparing Oseltamivir versus Placebo for the 
Treatment of Influenza in Low Risk Adults  
 
Short Title:  IRC-004 
 
Sponsor:  Office of Clinical Research Policy and Regulatory Operations (OCRPRO), Division of 
Clinical Research (DCR), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)  
 
Conducted by: NIAID Influenza Research Collaboration (NIRC)  
 
Sample Size:  N= 560 sub jects 
 
Accrual Ceiling: Up to  800 subjects will be screened to randomize 560 subjects  
 
Study Population:  Outpatient subjects at low risk for complications and morbidity from 
influenza (using US CDC criteria), and that have a diagnosis of influenza by rapid  antigen or 
PCR.  
 
Study Design:   This randomized double -blind study will evaluate whether oseltamivir modifies 
viral shedding in an ambulatory population with uncomplicated influenza. This study is also 
designed to explore the relationship between virologi c effects and clinical effects, and to start 
understanding if improvements to virologic shedding correlate with improvements in clinical 
outcomes.  This is a multicenter international study.  Up to approximately 50 sites may 
participate in this protocol.  
 
Subjects with an influenza -like illness will be screened for the study, and those found positive for 
influenza will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to receive a blinded study treatment consisting of 
either oseltamivir or placebo for 5 days. Subjects will be assessed on Study Day 0 (pre -dose), 
and on Study Days 3, 7, and 28. All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy and safety 
assessments during the study. Subjects will have a NP swab to test for influenza virus on Days 0, 
3, 7, and blood samples will be collected on Days 0, 3, 7, and 28. Subjects will also perform self -
collection of nasal swabs  for the detection of influenza virus on Days 0, 1, 2, and 3.  
 
Study Agent: Oseltamivir versus placebo.  
 
Primary Objective:   
The overall objective of the study is t o evaluate the antiviral efficacy of oseltamivir compared to 
placebo in the treatment of subjects with confirmed influenza infection (Primary Efficacy 
Population) as measured by percentage of subjects with virus detectable by PCR in NP swab at 
Day 3.  
 
Seco ndary Objectives:   
Statistical Analysis  Plan  IRC004  Page 4 of 17  
1. Evaluate the antiviral efficacy of treatment with oseltamivir compared with placebo in those 
subjects with confirmed influenza infection (primary efficacy population) and intention to treat 
(ITT) population as assessed by the followin g parameters:  
 
Virologic: (by PCR in NP swab)  
◦ AUC of viral shedding  
◦ Duration of viral shedding  
◦ Percent cessation of viral shedding on Days 3 and 7  
◦ Frequency of emergence of antiviral resistance  
 
Clinical:  
◦ Time to alleviation of influenza clinical symptoms  
◦ Time to absence of fever  
◦ Time to resolution of all symptoms AND fever  
◦ Time to resumption of normal activity  
                  Note: in this analysis, this objective will be assessed by:  
o Time to feeling as good as before the onset o f the influenza illness  (as measured 
by a global assessment question)  
o Time to return to pre -influenza illness level of function  (as measured by a global 
assessment question)  
o Time to return to pre -influenza illness level of physical function (as measured by  
SF-36 physical score)  
◦ Proportion of subjects who require hospitalization  
◦ Proportion of subjects who develop bronchitis, pneumonia, or other complications of 
influenza  
 
2. Evaluate the association of viral shedding (both qualitative and quantitative) t o clinical 
symptoms and fever.  
 
3. Evaluate if changes in viral shedding by antiviral treatment predict changes in clinical 
symptoms and fever.  
 
4.  Evaluate subject self -collected nasal samples compared with study team collected samples for 
the determina tion of viral shedding.  
 
5. Evaluate the variability in the sample collection. (pilot study only)  [NOTE: This is not 
addressed in this SAP]

1 General analysis considerations  
Unless otherwise specified, data summaries and analyses will be presented overall and by 
randomized arm .  
 
To help protect participant confidentiality, listings of individual  patient level data will be 
minimized as much as possible.  Dates will also not be presented in listings; instead, for 
example, listings will present details as days since randomization.  
2 Application validation  
All study -specific programs for creation of de rived datasets for derivation of the endpoint 
defined in this document will require application validation and verification per written Standard 
Operating Procedures as appropriate.  
3 Visit and Evaluation Schedule  
The expected schedule for clinic visits (per  protocol) is shown in Table 1  below. To allow for 
possible deviations from these, the visit windows have been expanded for analysis purposes as 
indicated.  If there are multiple measurements within a window, then the one closest to the 
scheduled time will  be used in analysis.  
 
   
Statistical Analysis  Plan  IRC004  Page 6 of 17  
Table 1. IRC003 Study days and analysis windows  
  Days since randomization  
Visit Day 0 
(Baseline*)  Day 1  
(Home)  Day 2  
(Home)  Day 3  Day 7  Day 28  
Per protocol (Days)  0 1 2 3 7±1 28±3 
Analysis (Days)  0 (-1 if 0 not 
available)  1 2 3±1 7±2 28±7 
 *  Baseline evaluation must be completed prior to the first dose of study medication.  
 
For the diary cards, the auto -populated study day (‘stday’) on the CRF will be used to select the 
measurements  at each time point . If there are multiple measurements within a window , the 
calculated study day  (i.e. date of evaluation - randomization date), will be used  to choose the one 
closest to the scheduled time . 
4 Analysis Plan  
Unless otherwise stated, all tables and figures will show results by randomiz ed arms.   
 
Throughout this analysis plan, annotations in square brackets ([XXX]) provide the source 
table/view names and, in some cases, target fields in the IRC004 database.  
 
Per protocol, at study entry, results from laboratory tests obtained for clinic al indications within 
24 hours before randomization may be used if available.  
 
Unless otherwise stated, data will be presented in tables.  For tables with categorical variables, 
the number (%) will be presented.  For tables with continuous variables, the mean, standard 
deviation, median, 25th and 75th percentiles, min and max will be presented. The number with 
missing values will also be shown.  In calculation of percentages, subjects with missing data will 
not be included in the denominator. Data presente d as listings or figures noted.  
4.1 Analysis Populations  
All tables and figures will note the analysis population used:  
 Enrolled Population includes all subjects who had a signed informed consent form for 
screening.  
 Intention To Treat (ITT) Population includes all subjects who were randomized and who 
received at least one dose of study drug (as defined in Section 7.2.1 of the protocol).  
 Primary Efficacy Population (PEP) includes subjects in the ITT population with in fluenza 
infection confirmed in central laboratory testing.  Given the virology needed to analyze 
the primary endpoint, this is defined as having an influenza virus isolated and typed in the 
qualitative PCR evaluation at Day 0 from central laboratory testin g (or Day -1 if Day 0 
not available).  
 The population for the primary analysis is defined as the subgroup of the PE Population 
that excludes the subjects who participated in the pilot study (because efficacy results for 
those subjects were used in selectin g the primary endpoint for the study).

4.8 Efficacy Analysis  
The following ef ficacy analyses will be presented for the Primary Efficacy Population (study 
participants with confirmed influenza) and also for the Intent to Treat Population.  The primary 
analysis of the primary endpoint will exclude the 50 subjects enrolled in the pilot  study.  A 
secondary analysis will, however, be undertaken which includes these 50 subjects. All analyses 
of secondary efficacy endpoints will be undertaken including the 50 subjects enrolled in the pilot 
study.    
 
4.8.1  Primary Endpoint  [IRCRSLT] ( population for the primary analysis  and PEP ) 
The primary endpoint is defined as the percentage of subjects shedding virus by PCR in 
nasopharyngeal swabs obtained at Day 3.     
a. Completeness of viral shedding results showing number (%) at Day 0, 3 and 7 who:  
 had qPCR r esult  
 were lost to follow -up prior to the visit  
 were in follow -up but had missing value  
b. Primary Analysis: Among subjects with Day 3 qPCR results, number (%) with 
detectable viral shedding at Day 3. Comparison of randomized arms with associated 
95% confide nce interval and p -value based on the normal approximation to the 
binomial distribution.  
Statistical Analysis  Plan  IRC004  Page 12 of 17  
c. Sensitivity Analyses (PEP only): to assess potential impact of missing measurements. 
Repeat the primary analysis (above) considering missing measurements in turn as (a ) 
above the limit of detection, or (b) below the limit of detection, or (c) above the limit 
of detection in one randomized arm and below in the other arm (so as to maximize the 
difference between arms), or (d) the opposite of (c) (so as to minimize the dif ference 
between arms).  
d. Sensitivity Analyses (PEP only): Repeat the primary analysis above but restricted (a) 
to samples in which one or more housekeeping genes had detectable levels (hence 
indicating adequate sample); and (b) to samples in which all housekeeping genes had 
detectable levels.  
e. Subgroup Analyses (PEP only): Comparison of randomized treatments will be 
undertaken by sex (male vs female), influenza type (A vs B), and country/race 
(US/white vs US/non -white vs Thailand vs other countries).  To  assess whether the 
difference between randomized treatments varies by subgroup, a treatment by 
subgroup interaction test will be undertaken using logistic regression.   
 
4.8.2  Secondary Endpoint s: Virologic Endpoints  [IRCRSLTS]  (PEP  and ITT ) 
Viral shedding wil l be assessed by quantitative RT -PCR (reported as log 10 RNA copies/mL) with 
measurements obtained on Days 0, 3, and 7.  These measurements will be used to define the 
following variables:  
a. Figure and associated table showing number (%) of subjects who had va lues <LOD, 
LOD -<LLOQ, ≥LLOQ at each visit.  
b. Figure and associated table showing number of subjects and minimum, maximum, 
median, 25% and 75% percentile of the value of viral shedding at each visit (subjects 
with values <LOD will be ranked as lower than dete ctable values in this analysis; 
minimum and maximum in table only). Comparison of randomized arms at each of 
Day 3 and Day 7 will be based on the extension of Wilcoxon’s test to handle censoring 
of measurements which are <LLOQ.  
c. Number (%) of subjects with  undetectable viral load at both Day 3 and Day 7;  
detectable at Day 3 and undetectable at Day 7; detectable at Day 7 (irrespective of 
whether or not detectable at Day 3).  Analysis will be restricted to subjects with 
measurements at both Day 3 and Day 7.  Comparison of percentages of subjects in this 
table using the Wilcoxon  Test.  
d. Above tables/figures/analyses will be repeated for the subset of subjects who had 
detectable viral load at Day 0.  
 
 
4.9 Secondary Endpoints: Clinical Endpoints  [DIARY1] (PEP  and ITT ) 
Many of the clinical endpoints rely on data collected on diary cards completed by the 
study participants.  The subjects are asked to complete these twice a day (at 8AM and 
8PM) on Days 0 through 14 and then again on Day 28.  Fever is recorded for the 
preceding 12 hour period at both times each day, and symptoms are recorded at both 
times for Days 0 to 7 and then once daily on Days 8 to 14. Functional status (based on the 
Physical Function domain questions from the SF -36) and two questions giving a global 
assessment of status are completed daily at 8AM.

a. Duration of clinical symptoms . Duration of clinical symptoms is  defined as the 
time from Day 0 to the first of two successive measurements at which all clinical 
symptoms are grade 0 (absent) or 1 (mild).  A measurement is considered to be 
the 8AM or 8PM assessment during Days 0 to 7 (so two measurements are 
obtained per day) and then the daily assessment thereafter.  Time will then be 
calculated in half -days through to Day 7.  For the purposes of defining th e 
endpoint, i f the subjects’ first two assessments on (baseline assessment  and first 
subsequent diary card assessment) satisfy this criterion, then the duration will be 
set to zero.  Missing values will be ignored [this is equivalent to assuming that a 
missing value would have (a) indicated at least one grade 2+ symptom if the 
preceding record includes a grade 2+ symptom or if the first Day 0 value is 
missing; (b) indicated no grade 2+ symptoms if the preceding and succeeding 
assessments show no grade 2+ sy mptoms; and (c) indicated a grade 2+ symptom 
if the preceding assessment shows no grade 2+ symptom and the succeeding value  
shows a grade 2+ symptom].   Times will be considered  as discrete (i.e. based on 
the schedule of completion of diary cards ) and subje cts not having two succeeding 
assessments with only grade 0 or 1 symptoms at any time during follow -up will 
be censored immediately after Day 14  (the last scheduled measurement time on 
which an endpoint can occur).  
 
 Kaplan -Meier plot (and associated table)  of the percent of subjects without 
clinical symptoms per the above definition over time, with the median 
duration of time to alleviation of such symptoms and its 95% confidence 
interval.  
 P-value comparing randomized arms from the log rank test.  
 Sensitivit y analyses assuming (a) that missing values would include grade 2+ 
symptoms, (b) that missing values would not include grade 2+ symptoms, (c) 
that missing values would include grade 2+ symptoms in one randomized arm 
and would not include grade 2+ symptoms in the other arm (so as to maximize 
the difference between arms), and (d) the opposite of (c) (so as to minimize 
the difference between arms).  
 
Note: Secondary analyses restricting to those with at least one grade2 (moderate) 
or grade 3 (severe) clinical s ymptom based on the Diary Card at randomization, 
will be conducted for section a described above.  
 
b. Absence of fever Time to the absence of fever is defined as the time f rom Day 0 
to the first of two successive assessments (through to Day 7) or the first 
assessment (Day 8 to Day 28) at which no fever ≥38.0°C is reported during the 
prior 12 hours and no antipyretics have been taken during the 24 hours . Time will 
then be cal culated in half -days through to Day 7.  For the purposes of defining the 
endpoint, if the first two assessments on Day 0 or 1 satisfy this criterion, then the 
duration will be set to zero.  Missing values will be ignored [this is equivalent to 
assuming tha t a missing value would have (a) indicated fever  if the preceding 
record includes fever  or if the first Day 0 value is missing; (b) indicated no fever  
Statistical Analysis  Plan  IRC004  Page 14 of 17  
if the preceding and succeeding assessments show no fever ; and (c) indicated 
fever  if the preceding asses sment shows no fever  and the succeeding value shows 
fever ].  Times will be considered as discrete (i.e. based on the schedule of 
completion of diary cards) and subjects not having a 24-hour period without fever  
at any time during follow -up will be censored  immediately after Day 14 (the last 
scheduled measurement time on which an endpoint can occur).  
 
 Analysis for duration of fever will follow the same approach as for duration of 
clinical symptoms.  
 
c. Resolution of Symptoms and Fever. Time to resolution of all  symptoms AND 
Fever is defined as the time from Day 0 to the first of two successive 
measurements at which all clinical symptoms are grade 0 (absent) or 1 (mild) and 
no fever ≥38.0°C is reported during the prior 12 hours and no antipyretics have 
been taken  during the 24 hours.  
 
 Analysis for duration of clinical symptoms and fever will follow the same 
approach as for duration of clinical symptoms.  
 
 
d. Global assessment:  Times to “feeling as good as you did before you had the flu” 
and “functioning as well as you did before you had the flu” will be defined as the 
times of two successive measurements  with “yes” responses to the respective 
global assessment questions.  
 
 The details of the definition, handling of missing values and analysis will 
follow that for dur ation of clinical symptoms.  
 
e. Functional status: This is assessed using the 10 -item domain of Physical Function 
from the SF -36, and calculated as the average of the scores of all 10 items.  
Functional status is evaluated daily through to Day 14 and then at Day 28.  
 
 Scoring, including handling of missing values, will be undertaken per the 
standard instructions for the RAND 36 -Item Health Survey 1.0 instrument 
(located at:  
http://www.rand.org/health/surveys_tools/mos/mos_core_36item_scoring.htm
l ).  If all 10 components are not scored, the pre -illness functional status will 
be scored as missing.  
 
 Figure and associated Table: Median, 25th and 75th percentiles, (and min and 
max value in table), with sample size, at each required measurement time.  
 
 Figure and asso ciated Table: Median, 25th and 75th percentiles, (and min and 
max value in table), with sample size, change from Day 0 at each required 
measurement time.  
 
Statistical Analysis  Plan  IRC004  Page 15 of 17  
 Statistical comparison between randomized arms of changes in score will be 
undertaken at Days 3, 7, 1 4 and 28 using Wilcoxon’s test.  
 
 Time to return of physical function to pre -illness level is defined as the time 
from Day 0 to the first of two successive measurements at which the physical 
function score equals or is better than the pre -illness score (ob tained by recall 
at enrollment).  Time will be calculated in daily increments through to Day 
14.  For the purposes of defining the endpoint, if a subject’s  Day 0 and Day 1 
assessments satisfy this criterion, then the duration will be set to zero.  
Missing values will be ignored.  Times will be considered as discrete (i.e. 
based on the schedule of completion of diary cards) and subjects not having 
two successive assessments with scores equal to or better than the pre -illness 
score will be censored immediatel y after Day 14 (the last scheduled 
measurement time on which an endpoint can occur).  
 
 Kaplan -Meier plot (and associated table) of the percent of subjects returning 
to pre -illness level per the above definition over time, with the median 
duration of time to  return and its 95% confidence interval.  
 
 P-value comparing randomized arms from the log rank test.  
 
f. The following outcomes are targeted in the protocol:  
 
 Bronchitis / bronchiolitis  
 Pneumonia  
 Other complications  
 
For each of these, the percentage of subjec ts experiencing the event during 
follow -up will be obtained with the associated 95% confidence interval and 
comparison of arms will be based on the normal approximation to the binomial 
distribution, or exact methods based on the binomial distribution if nu mbers are 
small.  
 
4.9.1  Association of viral shedding to clinical symptoms and fever  (PEP and ITT)  
Association between viral shedding and clinical symptoms and fever is listed as a 
secondary objective.  The analysis depends on what is seen in virology results, a nd 
therefore the analysis is not presented in this analysis plan.  The planned analysis will be 
detailed in a later analysis plan.  
 
4.10 Evaluation of self -collected samples (PEP and ITT)  
Self-collected NP are collected on Day 0  (prior to treatment initiation) , Day 0 evening, 
Day 1, Day 1 evening, Day 2, Day 2 evening and Day 3. Viral shedding will be assessed 
using these self -collected swabs by the same assay used for the team collected swabs, i.e., 
quantitative RT -PCR (reported as log 10 RNA copies/mL).

a. Comp leteness of viral shedding results showing number (%) at Day 0, Day 0 evening, 
Day 1, Day 1 evening, Day 2, Day 2 evening and Day 3  who:  
 had swab taken  (i.e. submitted)  
 had qPCR result  
 died prior to visit  
 were lost to follow -up prior to the visit  
 were in  follow -up but had missing value  
 
b. Among subjects with Day 3 qPCR results, number (%) with detectable viral shedding 
at Day 3. Comparison of randomized arms with associated 95% confidence interval 
and p -value based on the normal approximation to the binomial  distribution.  
This table can be compared to table 4.8.1a, the primary endpoint , to determine if the 
self-swabs would have similar treatment effects  
 Repeat analysis in the population for the primary analysis (PEP  excluding 
pilot study) to allow direct com parison with primary endpoint.  
 
c. Bland -Altman plot showing the agreement between the result from the self -collected 
swabs and team -collected swabs across all available swabs  
 
d. Bland -Altman plot showing the agreement between the result from the self -collecte d 
swabs and team -collected swabs on Day 0  and Day 3.  
 
e. Table: Mean,  standard deviation, median, min, max, 25% and 75% percentiles of the 
viral load difference between self -collected swabs and team -collected swabs on Day 
0, Day1, Day 2 and Day 3. P-values comparing the difference based on normal 
approximation or Wilcoxon signed rank test, as appropriate for the data.  
 
f. Plots of association s between viral load based on self-collected swabs and viral load 
based on team -collected  swabs  on Day 0, Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3 . Spearman  
correlation coefficient s, along with their 95% confidence interval s, will be provided . 
Plots of association s and estimated correlation coefficient s will be provided both over 
all subjects and by strata defined by quartile of th e viral load  based on team -collected 
swabs at each time point .  
  
g. AUCs will be calculated for the self-collected swabs .  This is defined as the area 
below the line formed by joining the measured values at each successive scheduled 
measurement time and abov e the limit of detection.  This will be calculated using the 
trapezoidal rule.  Missing values will be ignored (this is equivalent to imputing a 
missing value using linear interpolation between the previous and succeeding 
available values).  If the Day 0 v alue is missing, then the subject will be excluded 
from the analysis.  
 Figure and associated table showing number of subjects and minimum, 
maximum, median, 25% and 75% percentile of the value of viral shedding at 
each scheduled measurement time.  This will  be presented (a) imputing values

as defined above for the calculation of AUC, and (b) using observed values 
only.  
 Table showing number of subjects and minimum, maximum, median, 25% 
and 75% percentile of the AUC, both over all subjects and by strata define d 
by quartile of Day 0 measurement.  
 P-value comparing randomized arms from Wilcoxon rank sum test stratified 
by quartile of Day 0 measurement.  
 
 
4.11 Emergence of antiviral resistance.  (ITT)  
Due to technical demands and cost of sequencing, resistance will be evaluated only in subjects 
that have virus present at Day 7, i.e., subjects that stop viral shedding by Day 7 will be 
considered as not having clinically significant resistance. All subjec ts with virus isolated at Day 
7 will have Day 0 and 7 samples evaluated by DNA Sequencing (Sanger method) of M2, NA and 
HA genes.  As this is primarily descriptive data of genetic sequences, and not statistical analysis, 
this data will be presented in a se parate report.   
a. Number (% of subjects with Day 7 measurement) of subjects with detectable viral 
shedding at Day 7.  
b. The number (% of number) of subjects with samples sequenced.  
c. The number (% of number) of subjects with detectable viral load, but were not 
sequenced as the viral load was near the limits of quantification (suggesting resistance 
is unlikely).  
d. Listing, separated by strain (H1N1, H3N2, and B) of subject ID, study day, viral load, 
amino acid substitutions tested (those known to convey amantadine o r oseltamivir 
resistance), amino acids detected in the sample at the given position.  
e. Interpretation if any amino acid substitutions detected are likely to confer resistance 
(based on literature review).

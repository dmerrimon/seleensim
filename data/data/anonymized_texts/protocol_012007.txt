SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title:  DOS [Dosing Optimization Study]: Open -label, Single -arm, 
Proof -of-Concept Dosing Study of Afrezza® in Adult Subjects 
18 Years and Older with Type 1 or Type  2 Diabetes Mellitus  
Protocol Number:  MKC -TI-191 
Sponsor:  MannKind Corporation  
Investigator(s)/Study 
Center(s):  This study will be conducted by Investigators at 2 or more  study 
centers located in the United States.  
Phase of 
Development:  Phase 4  
Objectives:  Primary Objective:  
 To evaluate the efficacy of Afrezza administered at 2 different 
doses , combined with basal  insulin, in adults 18  years and older 
with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) as measured by:  
o Mean change from baseline po stprandial glucose based 
on self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) from 
immediately before administering Afrezza (t=0 ; baseline ) 
to 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120  minutes after Afrezza 
dosing in conjunction with a standardized meal  challenge  
Secondary Objective:  
 To evaluate the safety of Afrezza  administered  at 2 different 
doses , combined with basal insulin, in adults 18 years and older 
with T1DM or T2DM, as measured by:  
o Event rates and incidence of Level 1 (<70 mg/dL) and 
Level 2 (<54 mg/dL) hypoglycemic events within the 
120 minutes after Afrezza dosing  
o Event rates and incidence of severe hypoglycemic events, 
defined as events requiring assistance of another person 
to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other 
resuscitative actions within the 120 minut es after Afrezza 
dosing  
o Change in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 
1 second (FEV 1) before Afrezza dosing to 120  minutes 
after Afrezza dosing  
o Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs): 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious AE s 
(SAEs), and AEs of special interest (AESIs)  
Study Design:  MKC -TI-191 is a Phase 4, single -arm, multicenter , proof -of-concept  
clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Afrezza, 
administered according to the  current Afrezza prescribing 
  Protocol MKC -TI-191

information (PI)  compared to a titrated dose , in combination with a 
basal insulin in adult subjects (≥18 years of age)  with T1DM or 
T2DM.  
Eligible subjects will be on a stable regimen consisting of a 
basal -bolus insulin therapy  prior to screening . 
The stu dy is composed of up to 4 clinic visits (screening, 2 treatment 
visits, and a follow -up visit) : 
 Screening (Visit 1):  Informed consent will be obtained and 
eligibility confirmed. Eligible subjects will be enrolled at Visit 1.  
 Visit  2: The first dose of Afrezza will be based on the dose of 
subcutaneous rapid -acting insulin analog (RAA)  that the subject 
would normally take, converted according to the guidelines 
provided in the current Afrezza PI . If the subject’s normal RAA 
dose is <4 units, the subject wi ll be asked to consume enough 
nutritional shake, per their normal insulin:carbohydrate ratio, to 
cover an RAA dose of ≥4 units such that their Afrezza dose at 
Visit 3 is higher than the dose taken at Visit 2. After completing 
the standardized meal challeng e, the Investigator will decide, 
based on the subject’s glucose excursion at Visit 2 , if the subject 
should proceed to Visit  3 where a second  dose of Afrezza will be 
administered.  
 Visit 3: The second dose of Afrezza will be based on the dose of 
subcutaneou s RAA that the subject would normally take, 
converted by multiplying their RAA dose by 2 and rounding 
down to the nearest Afrezza cartridge size .  
 Follow -up (Visit 4): Subjects will return for safety assessments 
24 to 72 hours after their last dose of Afrezza . 
Treatment Period  
Subjects will come into the clinic in a fasting state for Visits 2 and 3, 
with exception of treating hypoglycemia. Fasting will be defined as 
no intake of drink or food, with exception of water, for ≥ 6 hours 
before the clinic visi t. At the beginning of each visit, before their 
dose of Afrezza, subjects will have FEV 1 measurements taken in the 
clinic.  
Before each dose of Afrezza, subjects will be trained on proper 
inhalation technique with BluHale® PRO.  
Each meal challenge will con sist of 1 to 2 bottle s of nutritional shake 
to be fully consumed within 15 minutes.  The nutritional shake will 
contain approximately 240 calories, 41 g carbohydrate, 10 g protein, 
and 4 g fat per bottle . Each Afrezza dose  will be administered at the 
start of the meal challenge.  
The subject’s SMBG value must be between 100 and 200 mg/dL 
without requiring a correction dose of bolus insulin in order to 
receive the Afrezza dose and complete the meal challenge. Subjects 
  Protocol MKC -TI-191 
Confidential  Page 5 of 44 
using an insulin pump will be instructed to make sure their insulin 
pump is not in automated insulin delivery mode for the 3 hours 
before and during Visits 2 and 3. Subjects  will also be instructed not 
to inject correction doses of bolus insulin during the 6 hours 
immediately preceding each Afrez za dose.  If the subject requires a 
bolus insulin injection to correct hyperglycemia  within the 6 hours 
prior to the scheduled visit , the meal challenge will need to be 
rescheduled.  An SMBG measurement will be taken 15 minutes 
before the expected dose of Af rezza so the Investigator can  assess if 
the subject is within the required SMBG range (100 to 200  mg/dL). 
If the subject’s SMBG value is <100 mg/dL at the start of the visit, 
the Investigator can provide 15  g of fast -acting carbohydrates and 
remeasure SMBG  after 30  minutes to determine if the subject should 
proceed to the meal challenge. The SMBG value obtained 
immediately before each dose of Afrezza (t=0) will be used to 
determine if the subject can proceed to the meal challenge and will 
serve as the basel ine value  for that visit . 
Subjects will be monitored by the Investigator for at least 2 hours 
after administering  each dose of Afrezza. The subject will be 
instructed not to ingest additional food for the 2 hours they are in the 
clinic for observation, wit h exception of treating hypoglycemia ; any 
treatment for hypoglycemia (e.g., snack or glucose) will be 
documented .  
Subjects will take SMBG measurement s 15 minutes before their 
Afrezza dose and at t=0  (baseline) , 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 
120 minutes  with respect to their Afrezza dose , where t=0 
corresponds to the time immediately before administering  their dose 
of Afrezza. Additional SMBG measurements may be taken per 
Investigator discretion.  
Subjects will have an FEV 1 measurement after completion of  each 
standardized meal challenge (120 minutes after the Afrezza dose)  at 
Visits 2 and 3 . 
Follow -up Visit  
Subjects will be asked to return to the clinic within 24 to 72 hours 
after their last dose of Afrezza  for safety assessments, including a 
final FEV 1 measurement.  
Planned Sample Size:  20 subjects  (number of subjects to complete the study)  
Medical Condition or 
Disease Under 
Investigation:  T1DM  and T2DM , with no more than 50% of subjects having T2DM

1  INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
Diabetes constitutes one of the fasting growing global health emergencies.  The prevalence of 
type 1 diabetes mellitus  (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are rising, with nearly half 
a billion people living with diabetes worldwide ( IDF 2019 ). Among adults aged 20 -79 years, an 
estimated 463.0 million adults worldwide have diabetes  (~9.3% of all adults in this age group) . 
In both T1DM  and T2DM , the therapeutic ob jective is to optimally control blood  glucose levels 
and this objective is fundamentally the same in all subjects with diabetes , with individual 
circumstances and needs dictating what those optimal levels should be . In order to delay or 
prevent complicatio ns associated with diabetes, it is critical that patients adhere to their diabetes 
treatment regimen. Among patients treated with a multiple daily injection regimen  of insulin , 1 
in 5 (~20%) mealtime injections are intentionally missed , leading to challeng es in achieving 
effective glycemic control  (Peyrot et al. 2010 ). Reasons for omitting insulin injections include 
interference with daily activities, injection pain, and embarrassment.  
Technosphere® Insulin inhalation powder  (TI inhalation powder ) provides an alternative to 
injectable insulin. TI inhalation powder and the Gen2 Inhaler were approved as Afrezza® (insulin 
human) inhalation powder and Afrezza Inhaler by the United States Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA)  on 27  June 2014 to improve glycemic control in adult patients ≥ 18 years 
of age with diabetes mellitus and has been registered by the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency 
(ANVISA) as of 03  June 2019. Afrezza  is an ultra -rapid -acting insulin that is administered by 
oral inhalation using a breath -powered inhaler. Afrezza  particles have a median diameter of  
approximately 2 to 2.5 μm, a size appropriate for inhalation into the lung. Following inhalation,  
Afrezza  particles dissolve immediately at the physiologic pH of the lung, and insulin is absorbed 
systemically . After administration of Afrezza  in adults,  the maximum serum insulin 
concentration occurs in approximately 12 to 15 minutes (versus 45  to 60 minutes for a 
rapid -acting insulin analog [RAA] via subcutan eous [SC] route ) and returns to  near baseline 
levels in approximately 180 minutes (versus about 5 hours for RAA) ( Afrezza IB 2021 ).  
This unique ultra-rapid time-action profile allows for simpler and more flexible mealtime dosing, 
lessens t he potential for interprandial hypoglycemia, and enables additional postprandial dosing 
to decrease meal time glycemic excursions, when needed, based on the patient’s self -measured 
glucose levels.   
1.2 Study Rationale  
The current study aims to evaluate 2 differ ent doses of  Afrezza in adults ≥ 18 years of age . 
Subjects will administer an  Afrezza dose based on the current prescribing information (PI) with a 
meal challenge, and then proceed to a second meal challenge where a second Afrezza dose will 
be administered  based on the subject’s RAA dose multiplied by 2  and rounded down to the 
nearest Afrezza cartridge  size, subject to Investigator discretion .  
  Protocol MKC -TI-191 
Confidential  Page 15 of 44 
Pooled Afrezza trial data suggests  that subjects achieve similar glycemic control with a dose 
ratio of 1.5 - to 2-fold the equivalent unit value of a SC insulin analog in head -to-head 
comparisons ( Kendall  et al. 2020 , Grant et al. 2019 ). Thus, the Sponsor has chosen to evaluate 
2 different doses of Afrezza to assess whether a higher  dose result s in improved postprandial 
glucose control . 
1.3 Risks and Benefits  
A clear benefit of Afrezza  is fewer  injections compared to subjects using RAAs injected 
subcutaneously.  
The following safety risks have been identified through evaluation of all currently available data 
with Afrezza : 
Important identified risks  
 Bronchospasm in subject s with underlying chronic obstructive lung disease  
 Severe hypoglycemia  
 Hyperglycemia during initiation of treatment due to inadequate conversion of RAA dose  
Important potential risks  
 Diabetic ketoacidosis  (DKA)  
 Hyperglycemia during acute illness or change of treatment  
 Lung cancer: Data are insufficient to determi ne whether Afrezza has an effect on lung or 
respiratory tract tumors. In subject s with active lung cancer, a prior history of lung 
cancer, or in subject s at risk for lung cancer, the Investigator considers whether the 
benefits of Afrezza use outweigh this potential risk.  
Further information on the benefits and risks of Afrezza  are provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure  (IB) ( Afrezza IB 2021 ).

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
MKC -TI-191 is a Phase 4, single -arm, multicenter clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety 
of Afrezza, administered according to the current Afrezza  PI compared to a titrated dose , in 
combination with a basal insulin in adult subjects (≥18 years of age) with T1DM or T2DM.  
Eligible subjects will be on a stable regimen consisting of a basal -bolus insulin therapy prior to 
screening.  
The study is compose d of up to 4 clinic visits (screening, 2 treatment visits, and a follow -up 
visit):  
 Screening ( Visit 1 ): Informed consent will be obtained and eligibility confirmed. 
Eligible subjects will be enrolled at Visit 1.  
 Visit 2:  The first dose of Afrezza  will be b ased on the dose of SC RAA that the subject 
would normally take, converted according to the guidelines provided in the current 
Afrezza PI. If the subject’s normal RAA dose is <4  units, the subject will be asked to 
consume enough nutritional shake, per thei r normal insulin:carbohydrate ratio, to cover 
an RAA dose of ≥4 units such that their Afrezza dose at Visit  3 is higher than the dose 
taken at Visit 2. After completing the standardized meal challenge, the Investigator will 
decide, based on the subject’s g lucose excursion at Visit 2, if the subject should proceed 
to Visit 3 where a second  dose of Afrezza will be administered.  
 Visit 3: The second dose of Afrezza  will be based on the dose of SC RAA that the 
subject would normally take, converted by multiplying their RAA dose by 2 and 
rounding down to the nearest Afrezza cartridge size .  
 Follow -up Visit  (Visit 4) : Subjects will return for safety assessments , including a final 
FEV 1 measurement,  24 to 72  hours after their last dose of Afrezza . 
See Section  3.5 for information on the assessments to be performed at these visits.  
3.2 Study Duration  
Two individual doses of Afrezza will be administered during the study, during Visits 2 and 3. 
The duration of each subject’s participation in the trial is expected to be approximately  2 weeks.  
The end of the clinical study is defined as the day the last s ubject completes his/her last visit. The 
length of the entire study (from the first subject enrolled to the last subject last visit) is expected 
to be approximately 3 months.  
3.3 Selection of Study Population  
The population sought for this study is adult subje cts ≥18 years of age with T1DM  or T2DM . No 
more than 50% of subjects enrolled will have T2DM.  Twenty subjects are planned to complete 
the study. Subjects who do not complete the study may be replaced.  
Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed in Section  3.3.1  and Section  3.3.2 .

7. Use of antiadrenergic drugs (e.g., beta blockers and clonidine)  
8. Any concurrent illness (other than diabetes mellitus) not controlled by a stable 
therapeutic regimen  
9. History of a significant eating disorder (e.g., anorexia or bulimia nervosa)  
10. Current drug or alcohol abuse or a history of drug or alcohol abuse that, in the opinion of

  Protocol MKC -TI-191 
Confidential  Page 19 of 44 
15. Exposure to Afrezza in the 30 days before  screening  
Subject s who are unable to comply with the requirements of the study or who , in the  opinion of 
the Investigator , should not participate in the study  are not eligibl e. In addition, any subjects for 
whom Afrezza is contraindicated, based on the Afrezza PI ( Afrezza 2020 ), should not be 
enrolled in the study.  
3.3.3 Removal of Subject s from  Therapy or Assessment  
A subject  will be considered to have completed the study when the subject  completes the 
treatment visits  and the follow -up visit assessments .  
If a subject  discontinues from the study before completing all protocol -specified visits , an 
early -termination visit shoul d be conducted as soon as possible to have the assessments shown in 
the Schedule of Assessments (Table  2).  
Participation in the study is strictly voluntary. A subject  or legally authorized representative  has 
the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason. If he/she chooses t o 
withdraw, the Investigator must be informed immediately. The Investigator  has the right to 
terminate participation of any subject  at any time if the Investigator deems it in the subject ’s best 
interest. The Investigator should discuss the subject’s withd rawal with the medical monitor 
beforehand, if possible. If not possible, the Investigator  should discuss the withdrawal with the 
medical monitor within 24 hours of being informed of the decision.   
For any subject who fails to return to the site, the Invest igator should make every effort to 
contact the subject (e.g., contact the subject’s family or private physician, review available 
registries or health care database) and to determine their health status. Attempts to contact the 
subject must be documented i n the subject’s study records (e.g., times and dates of attempted 
telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter, and a copy of the letter).  
Subjects withdrawn from the study must not be re -enrolled  in the study. Their identification  
numbers must not be reused.  
3.3.3.1  Reasons for Discontinuation  
The reason and circumstances for early termination  will be documented in the subject ’s case 
report form ( CRF) . The reason for any early discontinuation should be indicated on this form . The 
primary r eason for a subject ’s early  study termination should be selected from the following 
standard categories of early termination:  
 Adverse Event : Clinical or laboratory events occur that, in the medical judgment of the 
Investigator  could affect the subject’s sa fety or well -being if treatment is continued . This 
includes serious (Section 4.1.2 ) and nonserious AEs regardless of relation to the study 
drug. 
 Withdrawal of Consent : The subject  desire s to withdraw from further participation in the 
study in the absence of an Investigator -determined medical need to withdraw. If the 
subject  gives a reason for withdrawing, it should be recorded in the CRF.  
  Protocol MKC -TI-191 
Confidential  Page 20 of 44 
 Major Protocol Violation : The subject’s findings or conduct fails to meet the protocol 
entry criteria or fails to adhere to the protocol requirements  that are deemed to affect 
subject safety or the integrity of the study data .  
 Pregnancy:  The subject becomes pregnant.  
 Smoking:  The subject begins smoking  or vaping , including smoking marijuana . 
 Lost to Follow -up: The subject  stops coming for visits and study personnel are unable to 
contact the subject . 
 Other : The subject  discontinues  from the study for a reason other than those listed above, 
such as termination of study by Sponsor.  
If a subject  discontinues from the study  due to the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2) global pandemic, information should be captured on the CRF so 
this information can be summarized in the clinical study report at the end of the study, in line 
with the FDA Gui dance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID -19 
Public Health Emergency ( FDA 2021 ). The reason for discontinuation should be recorded on the 
CRF as SARS -CoV -2/coronavirus 2019 ( COVID -19), if applicable, an d include as many details 
as possible.  
For example, specific reasons may include, but are not limited to:  
 The subject  exhibits symptoms consistent with COVID -19 within the last 10 days  
(yes/no) . 
 The subject  has a positive test result for SARS -CoV -2 (yes/n o). 
 The subject  has neither symptoms nor a positive test but has chosen  to discontinue 
treatment due to COVID -19 concerns.  
3.3.4 Replacement of Subject s 
Subject s who discontinue  from the study will not be replaced.  
3.4 Treatments

procedures are complete, eligible subjects will be enrolled . 
3.4.4 Drug Packaging and Blinding  
This is an open -label clinical study. Neither clinical site personnel nor subjects will be blinded to 
treatment.  
3.4.5 Drug Inventory a nd Accountability  
The Investigator  or designee is responsible for maintaining Afrezza  and inhaler accountability 
records to ensure appropriate distribution throughout the clinical study. Investigators should 
maintain records that document adequately that t he subjects were provided the doses specified by 
the protocol and reconcile all  Afrezza and inhalers  received at the site before final disposition. At 
the end of the study, or as directed, all Afrezza and inhalers , including unused, partially used, 
and emp ty containers will be discarded . 
3.4.6 Treatment Compliance  
It is expected that subjects will be compliant with all dosing instructions  and subjects will 
administer both doses of Afrezza under clinical supervision at the study site .  
3.4.7 Prior and Concomitant Illnes ses and Treatments  
3.4.7.1  Prior and Concomitant Illnesses  
Illnesses  present at screening will be considered to be prior illnesses (medical history). The 
subject’s history of diabetes should be recorded at screening on the CRF. Subjects will also be 
questioned about drug and environmental allergies, family pulmonary diseas e history, and their 
smoking status /exposure to pulmonary toxins . Investigators (or their designee) should document 
all other significant illnesses that the subject has experienced within 6 months of screening  as 
medical history on the CRF .  
After enrollme nt, any new or worsening illnesses should be documented as AEs in the CRF.  
3.4.7.2  Concomitant Treatments  
Any medication or therapy that is taken by or administered to the subject during the course of the 
study must be recorded in the CRF. The entry must include t he dose, regimen, route, indication, 
and dates of use.  
Concomitant treatments, defined as treatments taken after enrollment , include all nonstudy 
treatments that are taken by subjects at any time during the clinical study, including prescription 
drugs, her bal supplements, or over -the-counter medications , should be recorded as concomitant 
medications .  
Antiadrenergic drugs (e.g., beta blockers and clonidine) are prohibited during the study. Subjects 
should continue their  prestudy antihyperglycemic medication s but no changes to their 
medications should be made between Visits 1 and 3. The initiation of d rugs or herbal 
  Protocol MKC -TI-191

Note: Subjects should arrive to the clinic in  a fasting state for Visits 2 and 3, with exception of treating hypoglycemia . Fasting is 
defined as no intake of drink or food , with exception of water,  for ≥ 6 hours before  the clinic visit.  
a. Visits 1 and 2 may be consolidated into a single clinic visit, p rovided the subject is in a fasting state and able to complete all 
assessments required for both visits.  
b. Subjects will be asked to provide a recent negative COVID -19 test (if available), confirm they have no symptoms of 
COVID -19, or provide evidence of COVID -19 vaccination.

enrollment, additional pregnancy tests may be conducted as needed at the discretion of the Investigator.  
  Protocol MKC -TI-191 
Confidential  Page 25 of 44 
d. The subject’s SMBG value must be between 100 and 200 mg/dL without requiring a correction dose of bolus insulin in 
order to receive the Afrezza dose and complete the meal challenge . 
e. Subjects should use their Sponsor -provided blood glucose meter to take SMBG va lues: 15 minutes before their Afrezza 
dose, immediately before administering  their dose of Afrezza (t=0 ; baseline ) and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after 
Afrezza dosing . Additional SMBG measurements may be taken per Investigator discretion.  
f. If the  subject is wearing a CGM, they will be asked to write down their CGM value every time they take an SMBG 
measurement in the clinic. These CGM values will be entered in the CRF completed at Visit 2  and Visit 3 . 
g. At the beginning of Visits 2 and 3 , before  their dose of Afrezza, subjects will have FEV 1 measurements taken in the clinic. 
After completion of the standardized meal challenge (120 minutes after Afrezza dose), subjects will have another FEV 1 
measurement before  leaving the clinic.  
h. Any AE that occurs  after the subject enrolls in the study (consent date) will be recorded.  
i. Hypoglycemi c episodes will be defined as all SMBG measurements <70 mg/dL. See Section 3.5.5.6 . 
 
3.5.2 Study Procedures  
Subject consent will be obtained at screening before any clinical study procedures are performed.  
Procedures will be performed at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Ass essments ( Table  2). A 
detailed description of each assessment can be found in Sections 3.5.4  (efficacy) and 3.5.5  
(safety).   
3.5.2.1  Screening (Visit 1)  
Subject consent will be obtained upon screening before  any study procedures are performed.  
The following will be performed at Visit 1:  
 Record demographics and medical history (see Section 3.5.5.1 ) 
 Record vital signs (see Section 3.5.5.4 ) 
 Perform complete physical examination (see Section 3.5.5.2 ) 
 Record height and weight (see Section 3.5.5.3 ) 
 Record concomitant  medications (see Section 3.4.7.2 ) 
 Record smoking status and pulmo nary toxin exposure  
 Measure and record FEV 1 
 Collect blood and urine for laboratory tests (see Section  3.5.5.7 ) 
 Perform COVID -19 screening assessment  
 Enrollment (if eligibility criteria are met)  
Visits 1 and 2 may be consolidated into a single clinic visit, provided the subject is in a fasting 
state and able to complete all assessments required for both visits.  
3.5.2.2  Treatment Period  
Subjects will come into the clinic in a fasting state for Visits 2 and 3, with exception of treating 
hypoglycemia. Fasting will be defined as no intake of drink or food, with e xception of water, for 
≥6 hours before the clinic visit.  
Subjects must have an SMBG value between 100 and 200 mg/dL without requiring a correction 
dose of bolus insulin in order to receive each Afrezza dose and complete the meal challenges. 
  Protocol MKC -TI-191 
Confidential  Page 26 of 44 
Subjects using  an insulin pump will be instructed to make sure their insulin pump is not in the 
automated insulin delivery mode for the 3 hours before and during treatment visits. Subjects will 
also be instructed not to inject correction doses of bolus insulin during th e 6 hours immediately 
preceding each Afrezza dose. If the subject requires a bolus insulin injection  to correct 
hyperglycemia within the 6 hours prior to the scheduled visit, the meal challenge will need to be 
rescheduled. An SMBG measurement will be taken  15 minutes before the expected dose of 
Afrezza so the Investigator can assess  if the subject is within the required SMBG range (100 to 
200 mg/dL). If the subject’s SMBG value is <100  mg/dL, the Investigator can provide 15  g of 
fast-acting carbohydrates an d remeasure SMBG after 30 minutes to determine if the subject 
should proceed to the meal challenge. The SMBG value obtained immediately before each dose 
of Afrezza (t=0) will be used to determine if the subject can proceed to the meal challenge and 
will se rve as the baseline value for that visit.  
Each meal challenge will consist of 1 to 2 bottles of nutritional shake to be fully consumed 
within 15 minutes. The nutritional shake will contain approximately 240 calories, 41  g 
carbohydrate, 10 g protein, and 4 g fat per bottle. Each Afrezza dose will be administered at the 
start of the meal challenge.  
3.5.2.2.1  Visit 2  
The following procedures will be performed at Visit 2: 
 Record concomitant medications (see Section 3.4.7.2 ) 
 Complete training on the Afrezza inhaler using BluHale® PRO  
 Measure  and record FEV 1 before  Afrezza dose  
 Take first dose of Afrezza with standardized meal challenge according to 
Section  3.5.2.2.1.1  
 Measure and record  FEV 1 after completion of the meal challenge  
 Record AEs  
 Collect and review glucose meter data  
 Record any hypoglycemic ep isodes (see Section 3.5.5.6 )  
 Provide discharge instructions  to the subject  
3.5.2.2.1.1  Standardized Meal Challenge and Afrezza Dosing at Visit 2  
The Afrezza dose to be taken at Visit 2 will be based on the dose of RAA that the subject would 
normally take, converted according to the guidelines provided in the current Afrezza PI  as shown 
in Table  3.  
For Afrezza doses exceeding 12 units, inhalations from multiple cartridges are necessary. To 
achieve the required total mealtime dose, subjects should use a combination of 4 -unit, 8 -unit, and 
12-unit ca rtridges.

RAA=rapid -acting insulin analog (e.g., insulin aspart or insulin lispro)  
Note: There is no maximum dose of Afrezza and the required total mealtime dose may differ from the examples provided in this 
table.  
The dose of Afrezza will be administered at the start of the meal challenge. The subject must 
consume 1 to 2 bottles of nutritional shake within 15 minutes for the meal challenge and take 
SMBG measurements 15 minutes before their Afrezza dose, immediately before administering 
the Afrezza dose (t=0; baseline) and at 15, 3 0, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after Afrezza dosing. 
The subject will remain under clinical supervision for the 2 hours after their dose of Afrezza.  
If the subject is wearing a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), they will be asked to write down 
their CGM va lue every time they take an SMBG measurement in the clinic. These CGM values 
will be entered in the CRF completed at Visit 2.  
After completing the standardized meal challenge, the Investigator will decide, based on the 
subject’s glucose excursion at Visit 2 if the subject should proceed to Visit 3 where a titrated 
dose of Afrezza will be administered  according to Table  4. 
  Protocol MKC -TI-191 
Confidential  Page 28 of 44 
3.5.2.2.2  Visit 3 
The following procedures will be performed at Visit 3: 
 Record concomitant medications (see Section 3.4.7.2 ) 
 Complete refresher training on the Afrezza inhaler using BluHale PRO  
 Measure and record  FEV 1 before  Afrezza dose  
 Take the dose of Afrezza with standardized meal challenge according to 
Section  3.5.2.2.1.1  
 Measure and record  FEV 1 after completion of the meal challenge  
 Record AEs  
 Collect and review glucose meter data  
 Record any hypoglycemic episodes (see Section 3.5.5.6 ) 
 Provide discharge instructions to the subject  
3.5.2.2.2.1  Standardized Meal Challenge and Afrezza Dosing at Visit 3 
The Afrezza dose to be taken at Visit 3 will be based on the dose of RAA that the subject would 
normally take, converted by multiplying their RAA dose by 2 and rounding down to the nearest 
Afrezza cartridge size  as shown in  Table  4. If the subject’s normal RAA dose is <4 units, the 
subject will be asked to consume enough nutritional shake, per their normal insulin:carb ohydrate  
ratio, to cover an RAA dose of ≥4 units such  that their Afrezza dose at Visit 3 is higher than the 
dose taken at Visit 2.  
For Afrezza doses exceeding 12 units, inhalations from multiple cartridges are necessary. To 
achieve the required total mealtime dose, subjects should use a combination of 4 -unit, 8-unit, and 
12-unit cartridges.

Note: There is no maximum dose of Afrezza and the required total mealtime dose may differ from the examples provided in this 
table.  
The dose of Afrezza will be administered at th e start of the meal challenge. The subject must 
consume 1 to 2 bottles of nutritional shake within 15 minutes for the meal challenge and take 
SMBG measurements 15 minutes before their Afrezza dose, immediately before administering 
the Afrezza dose (t=0; ba seline) and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after Afrezza dosing. 
The subject will remain under clinical supervision for the 2 hours after their dose of Afrezza.  
If the subject is wearing a CGM, they will be asked to write down their CGM value ever y time 
they take an SMBG measurement in the clinic. These CGM values will be entered in the CRF 
completed at Visit 3.

3.5.2.3  Follow -up (Visit 4 ) / Early -Termination Visit  
The following procedures will be performed at Visit 4, or if the subject discontinues early, at the 
early -termination  visit: 
 Record concomitant medications (see Section 3.4.7.2 ) 
 Measure and record  FEV 1  
 Record AEs  
3.5.3 Procedures for Subjects  Who Prematurely Withdraw from the Study  
Any subject who discontinues treatment prematurely should have an early -termination  visit 
conducted as soon as possible  to complete the assessments indicated in Table  2 and 
Section  3.5.2.3 .  
3.5.4 Efficacy Assessment  
3.5.4.1  Self-Monitored Blood Glucose  
Subjects will measure their blood glucose  using the Sponsor -provided blood glucose meter and 
corresponding supplies (lancets, control solutio ns, test strips, etc.). Subjects will be instructed at 
both Visits 2 and 3 to take SMBG values 15 minutes before their Afrezza dose, immediately 
before administering their dose of Afrezza (t=0 ; baseline ), and at 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes 
after Afrezza  dosing . Additional SMBG measurements may be taken per Investigator discretion.  
3.5.5 Safety Assessments  
3.5.5.1  Medical History and Demographics  
A detailed medical history should be taken to assess whether or not subjects meet the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, includin g history of diabetes (e.g., age at onset of diabetes, start and 
stop dates of previous insulin treatments, treatment name, dose[s], frequency and method of dose 
delivery, date of clinical diagnosis of T1DM or T2DM).  In addition, subjects will be queried 
about drug and environmental allergies, family pulmonary disease history, and any change in 
their smoking status.  
Demographic data, including age (years), race, ethnicity, and gender (male, female, other, or 
“decline  to state”) will also be collected.  
3.5.5.2  Physical Examinations  
A complete physical examination, including general appearance, ear, nose, throat, lung, and 
cardiac auscultation will be performed at Visit 1.  
Abbreviated physical examinations will be performed as  deemed appropriate by the Investigator 
for safety reasons; these abbreviated physical examinations will include, but are not limited to, 
general appearance, respiratory and cardiovascular systems, and other evaluations, as needed.  
All changes identified a s clinically noteworthy must be recorded in an AE page of the CRF.  
  Protocol MKC -TI-191 
Confidential  Page 31 of 44 
3.5.5.3  Height and Weight  
Height, in centimeters, should be measured when the subject’s shoes are off, feet together, and 
arms by the sides. Heels, buttocks, and upper back should also be in conta ct with the wall when 
the measurement is made.  
Body weight, in kilograms, should be obtained with the subject wearing undergarments or very 
light clothing and no shoes, and with an empty bladder. The floor surface on which the scale 
rests must be hard and should not be carpeted or covered with other soft material. The same scale 
should be used throughout the study and calibrated on a regular basis as recommended by the 
manufacturer.  
The body mass index ( BMI ) value will be calculated based on the height and weight . 
3.5.5.4  Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include body temperature, respiratory rate, pulse, and sitting systolic and 
diastolic blood pressures. Vital sign measurements will be recorded with the subject in a sitting 
position for 5  minutes before the measurement  is taken.  
3.5.5.5  Pulmonary Function Tests  
Subjects will undergo pulmonary function tests  (spirometry)  according to American Thoracic 
Society and European Respiratory Society recommendations  in the clinic .  
The FEV 1 values will be recorded in the CRF . 
3.5.5.6  Hypoglycemi c Events  
A hypoglycemi c episode is defined as any event with SMBG <70 mg/dL  (i.e., Level 1 
hypoglycemia) or SMBG <54 mg/dL ( i.e., Level 2 hypoglycemia) . Severe hypoglycemic events 
are defined as events requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, 
glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Severe hypoglycemic events will be documented as 
SAEs in the CRF . Nonsevere hypoglycemic events will not be document ed as AEs but will be 
recorded in the hypoglycemia page of the CRF .  
After the standardized meal challenges at Visit 2 and Visit  3, subjects will be monitored for signs 
of hypoglycemia. Subjects exhibiting signs of hypoglycemia will be treated as appropria te (e.g., 
provided with a snack or glucose) and the type of treatment given and time will be recorded. If a 
subject experiences hypoglycemia, SMBG measurements should be performed every 15  minutes 
until hypoglycemia is resolved.  
3.5.5.7  Clinical Laboratory Tests  
The clinical site will collect blood samples  for HbA1c from subjects at Visit 1  and samples will 
be forwarded to the central laboratory for analysis. Urine pregnancy tests  (for β -human chorionic 
gonadotropin) will be performed locally  for women of child -bearing potential only .

3.5.5.8  Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring after enrollment  and through the duration of the study will be recorded.  See 
Section  4 for additional information.  
3.5.6 Appropriateness of Measurements  
All assessments to be used in this study are commonly used  and generally recognized as relevant 
in diabetes  studies.   
  Protocol MKC -TI-191

4 ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING  
Throughout the course of the study, all AEs will be monitored and re corde d in an AE  page of the  
CRF, including the AE’s description, start and end date, seriousness, severity, action taken, and 
relationship to the study drug . If AEs occur, the first concern will be the safety of the study 
subject s. All AEs will be followed until resolved or stable and the outcome documented in the 
CRF.  
4.1 Definitions and Criteria  
4.1.1 Adverse Events  
Per International Council for Harmonisation  of Tech nical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for 
Human Use  (ICH) E2A , an AE is a ny untoward medical occurrence in a subject  or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have 
to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to 
the medicinal product.  
The intensity of each AE will be determined according to the following criteria:  
 Mild: no modification of daily activities and does not require corrective/symptomatic 
treatment.  
 Moderate: hinders normal daily activities and/or requires corrective/symptomatic 
treatment.  
 Severe: prevents daily activities and requires corrective/symptomatic treatment.  
Medical interventions such as surgeries, diagnostic procedures, and therapeutic procedures are 
not AEs but the action taken to treat a partic ular medical condition. They should be recorded as 
treatment of the AEs.  
4.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE  or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening  
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 Is an important medical event ( e.g., intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home 
for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse; malignancy tumors 
[histological ly different from primar y tumor] ) 
  Protocol MKC -TI-191 
Confidential  Page 34 of 44 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject  or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  
Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. A n 
SAE is not necessarily severe  (e.g., an overnight hospitalization for a diagnostic procedure must 
be reported as an SAE even though the occurrence is not medically serious ). Furthermore, a  
sever e AE is not necessarily serious ( e.g., nausea of several hours’ duration may be rated as 
sever e but may not be considered serious ). 
4.1.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AESI  is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern, specific to the 
investigational medicinal product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
commun ication by the Investigator to the Sponsor may be appropriate. Such events may require 
further investigation in order to characterize and understand them.  
For AESIs, the Sponsor must be informed immediately ( i.e., within 24 hours), per the SAE 
notificatio n guidelines described in Section  4.2.2 .  
The following AEs are considered AESIs:  
 Acute bronchospasm  
 Clinically relevant decline in pulmonary function  (>20% decline from baseline  percent 
predicted FEV 1 accompanied by respiratory symptoms ) 
 Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can occur with insulin products, 
including Afrezza  
 DKA  
The following diagnostic criteria must be met to be con sidered a DKA event ( ADA 2004 ): 
 Arterial blood pH <7.30 or serum bicarbonate <15 mEq/L  
 Blood glucose >250 mg/dL (or >13.9 mmol/L)  
 Serum ketones or large/moderate urine ketones  
 Symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, or vom iting 
 Treatment provided in a health care facility  
4.1.4 Abnormal Laboratory Value s 
Any abnormality in a laboratory value that is new in onset or that has worsened in severity or 
frequency from the baseline condition and meets one of the following criteria will be recorded in 
the AE pages of the CRF:  
 Requires therapeutic intervention or diagnostic tests  
 Leads to discontinuation of study drug  
 Has accompanying or inducing symptoms or signs  
  Protocol MKC -TI-191 
Confidential  Page 35 of 44 
 Is judged by the Investigator  as clinically significant  
4.1.5 Assessing Relationsh ip 
The Investigator will classify every AE according to its relationship to study drug , study device, 
or study -related procedure. The AE relationship categories that will be used are listed below : 
Related:   
 An AE that o ccurs at a reasonable time interval after administration of the investigational 
product, use of the device, or procedure  
 An AE that f ollows a known response pattern to the investigational product, use of the 
device, or procedure  
 An AE that i mproves after stopping the investigational product,  use of the device, or 
procedure and reappears after repeated exposure to the investigational product, device, or 
procedure. Depending on the nature of the AE, rechallenge may not be possible.  
Probably related:   
 An AE that occurs at a reasonable time inter val after administration of the investigational 
product, use of the device, or procedure  
 An AE that follows a known response pattern to the investigational product, use of the 
device, or procedure, where an alternative explanation (e.g., a concomitant drug  or 
concurrent disease) is less likely  
Possibly related:  
 An AE that o ccurs at a reasonable time interval after administration of the investigational 
product, use of the device, or procedure  
 An AE that f ollows a known response pattern to the investigationa l product, use of the 
device, or procedure, but could have been produced by the subject’s clinical status or by 
other therapies  
Unlikely related :  
 An AE for which sufficient information exists to indicate that the etiology is unrelated to 
the investigation al product, use of the device, or procedure  
 An AE for which a nother etiology is specified  
Not related :  
 An AE without a temporal relationship to the investigational product ( e.g., an AE 
occurring in a subject who has not received investigational product), use of the device, or 
procedure  
 An AE for which another cause is known  
  Protocol MKC -TI-191

4.2 Reporting Procedures and Requirements  
4.2.1 Adverse Events  
Any AEs occurring from when the subject  enrolls in the study (consent date)  until they exit the 
study  will be recorded .  
The Investigator should document all AEs in the subjects’ source documentation, on the AE page 
of the CRF, and the SAE report (if the AE is serious). AEs of hypoglycemia that meet SAE 
criteria should be documented in the AE page of the CRF and SAE report.   
The Investigator should specify the date of the onset of the AE, the intensity (see definitions in 
Section  4.1), action taken with respect to the study drug , corrective treatment/therapy given, 
additional investigations performed, outcome, and the relationship to study drug  (Section 4.1.5 ). 
Whene ver possible, the diagnosis or syndrome should be reported instead of individual 
associated symptoms (e.g., record “influenza” if this is the diagnosis instead of “fever” and 
“chills”).  
Every AE and SAE should be followed until resolved, or resolved with sequelae, or considered 
stable in the opinion of the Investigator. To the extent possible, event resolution information will 
be obtained by means of due diligence (see the site operations manual).  
If the severity of an AE increases, a new AE page in the CRF must be completed for that AE. 
The date of change would be included as the end date for the original AE and the start date for 
the new AE of greater severity.  
4.2.2 Adverse Events of Special Interest and Severe Hypoglycemia  
As soon as possible (desired within 24 hours of Investigator  or study coordinator awareness), the 
investigational center staff must report all events of severe hypoglycemia and AESIs  (including 
DKA) to the Sponsor . For these  events, the AE page of the CRF will be completed with all 
known details as soon as possible, this will serve as notification to the Sponsor . If the study 
database cannot be accessed due to technical problems, contact the Sponsor  and provide the 
known details of the event. Once the a ccess issue has been corrected, the event should be entered 
onto an AE page in the CRF.  
Source documents that support the event (e.g. , clinic notes, hospital admission and discharge 
records, lab reports, emergency medical technician  reports, emergency room /urgent care ) should 
be provided to the Sponsor . All source documents/medical records should be redacted. Each 
source page should be identified with the subject identification number . 
4.2.3 Serious Adverse Events  
Prompt notification by the Investigator to th e Sponsor of an SAE (within  24 hours) is essential so 
that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities toward  the safety of participants and the safety 
of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.   
  Protocol MKC -TI-191 
Confidential  Page 37 of 44 
The Sponsor  has a legal responsibility  to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply with all applicable  regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to 
the regu latory authority, institutional review board ( IRB), and investigators.  
Any SAE brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after the end of the study for the 
subject and considered by the Investigator to be caused by the investigational product with a 
reasonable possibility should also be reported.  
4.3 Procedures for Documenting Pregnancy During Study  
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study, the Investigator will notify the medical 
monitor immediately following pregnancy confirm ation. A subject who becomes pregnant  over 
the course of this study will be discontinued from study drug  and followed for safety outcomes 
until 30  days beyond resolution of the pregnancy . Pregnancy is not in and of itself an AE. 
However, if any adverse fin dings in a child or fetus of a subject  exposed to the study drug  before 
conception or during pregnancy should be reported as AEs.

5 DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
5.1 Data Management Considerations  
Paper CRFs will be employed for this study. Completed  CRFs for this study will be forwarded to 
the Sponsor or its representative where editing and construction of a validated  database will 
occur. Data will be quality checked, double -entered, and verified before entry into the database. 
Queries will be issued  for any inconsistencies, omissions, and discrepancies and will be resolved 
by the appropriate parties. The statistical analysis of these data will be performed by the Sponsor 
or its representative. All AEs will be coded using the latest version of the Med ical Dictionary for 
Regulated Activities (MedDRA). Concomitant medications will be coded using the latest version 
of WHODrug Global. Data management details will be outlined in a separate data management 
plan.  
5.2 Statistical Considerations  
Any deviations from  the analyses described below will be documented prior to database lock , 
which will be described  in the clinical study report.  
5.2.1 General Considerations  
All statistical processing will be performed using the most current version of SAS® software 
(SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) at the time of the analysis. Summary tables (descriptive statistics 
and/or frequency tables) will be provided for screening and/or baseline variables, efficacy 
variables, and safety variables. Continuous variables wil l be described by descriptive statistics 
(n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum). Frequency counts and 
percentage of subjects within each category will be provided for categorical data.  
Individual data will be listed and sorted by trea tment, subject identification number , visit, and 
time point.  
Database  lock will occur upon  the completion of the study.  
5.2.2 Randomization  
This study is an open -label, single -arm study ( not randomized ). 
5.2.3 Sample Size Justification  
The sample size (20 subjects com pleting the study) was not determined using statistical methods, 
but rather was chosen based on clinical considerations.  
5.2.4 Analysis Populations  
All subjects in the clinical study who receive a dose of Afrezza will be included in the analyses  
reported at the  end of the study . 
5.2.5 Protocol Deviations

6 STUDY MANAGEMENT  
6.1 Ethics and Consent  
6.1.1 Regulat ions and  Guidelines  
The study will be performed in accordance with this protocol state and federal laws, and ICH 
guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.  
6.1.2 Institutional Review Board  
The clinical trial docum ents, including this protocol , will be reviewed by  the relevant IRB before  
the start of the study.  
Conduct of the trial must be approved by an appropriately constituted IRB. Approval is required 
for the study protocol, protocol amendment(s), informed cons ent forms (s), subject information 
sheets, and any advertising materials. No investigational product will be shipped to a site until 
written IRB authorization has been received by the Sponsor or its representative . 
6.1.3 Informed Consent  
For each trial subject , written consent  will be obtained before any protocol -related activities  are 
performed . As part of this procedure, the Investigator or a designated representative must explain 
orally and in writing the nature, duration, and purpose of the study, and the action of the study 
drug in such a manner that the subject  is aware of the potential risks, inconveniences, or adverse 
effects that may occur. Subject s should be informed that they may withdraw from the study at 
any time without any resulting disadvantage. They will receive all information that is required by 
local regulations and ICH guidelines.  
6.1.4 Data Protection  
The Sponsor will ensure the confidentiality of a subject ’s medical information in accordance 
with all applicable laws and regulations.  
Personal d ata generated within the scope of this study must be available for inspection upon 
request by representatives of the  Sponsors ’ monitors, representatives, and collaborators.  
6.2 Discontinuation of the Study by the Sponsor  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study at this site or at all sites for safety or 
administrative reasons at any time. In particular, a sit e that does not recruit at a reasonable rate 
may be discontinued. Should the study be terminated and/or the site closed for whatever reason, 
all documentation pertaining to the study and study drug must be returned to the Sponsor or its 
representative.  
6.3 Study Documentation

  Protocol MKC -TI-191 
Confidential  Page 42 of 44 
6.4 Data Management and Quality Control  
6.4.1 Case Report Forms  
The Investigator should maintain adequate and accurate source documents and trial records that 
include all pertinent observations on each of the site’s trial subjects. Source data should be 
attributable, leg ible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete.  
All clinical data will be captured in a validated database .  
The Investigator  site staff will enter and edit the data via a secure network, with secure access  
features (username and password). A comp lete audit trail will be maintained. The  Investigator 
will approve the data using an electronic signature , and this  approval will be  used to confirm the 
accuracy of the data recorded. Data for all subjects  will be recorded in CRFs . The subject  data 
will be  accessible from the  Investigator ’s site throughout the trial. The CRF must be kept current 
to reflect subject  status at each phase during the course of the trial. The  CRF will not capture 
personalized data. The Investigator  must make a separate confidenti al record of personalized 
details (name and initials) on the subject  identification and enrollment log.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator  of the respective site to ensure that all subject  
discontinuations or changes in study or other medications entered in the subject ’s CRF are  also 
made on the subject ’s medical records.  The CRFs for any subject  leaving the study should be 
completed at the time of the final visit or shortly thereafter.  
6.4.2 Stud y Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
This study will be performed in compliance with the Sponsor’s standard operating procedures 
(SOPs) or with the contract research organization’s SOPs, if applicable, and with regulations set 
forth by the FDA, ICH, and othe r significant regulatory authorities. Compliance will be achieved 
through study -specific audits of clinical sites and review of data. The Investigator or their 
qualified designee will enter the information required by the protocol on CRFs provided by the 
Sponsor. Site monitors should visit each clinical site at a frequency documented in the 
monitoring plan to review CRFs for completeness and accuracy. Any discrepancies found 
between source documents and completed CRFs should be queried and appropriate clini cal site 
personnel should address and or correct those discrepancies.  
Computerized and manual procedures should be used to review and check data from CRFs  and 
data from external sources for omissions, apparent errors, and values that may require  further 
clarification from the clinical site. Data queries will be addressed by appropriate  clinical 
personnel in the CRF. Only authorized personnel can make corrections to CRF in the  clinical 
database and all corrections are documented in the CRF audit trail.  
6.5 Rete ntion of Records  
The Investigator must arrange for retention of study records at the site. The Investigator  should 
take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents  for the duration 
of the retention period . 
  Protocol MKC -TI-191 
Confidential  Page 43 of 44 
The Investigator and institution must agree to provide direct access to all study -related materials, 
study staff, facilities, and source documents for study monitors, auditors, or regulatory 
inspectors.  
6.6 Use of Study Findings  
By signing the study protocol, the Investigator agrees to the use of results of the study for the 
purposes of national and international registration. If necessary, the authorities will be notified of 
the Investigator’s name, address, qualifications, and extent of involvement. Reports covering 
clinical and biometric aspects of the study will be prepared by the Sponsor or its representative.  
6.7 Financial Disclosure  
Investigators will be required to disclose any financial equity interests in the Sponsor and any 
conflicts of interest.  
6.8 Publications  and Disclosu re Policy  
This clinical study will be registered on ClinicalTrials.gov no later than 21 days after the first 
subject is enrolled , in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.  
As a multicenter trial, the Sponsor intends to publish clinical data fr om all centers participating 
in the investigation. Authorship and manuscript composition will reflect joint cooperation 
between multiple investigators, sites, and the Sponsor’s personnel. Authorship will be 
established before writing of the manuscript.  
In conformity with International Committee of Medical Journal Edito rs (ICMJE 2019 ) 
recommendations , investigators whose contribution consists solely in the collection of data will 
not be named individually as authors. Rather, those in vestigators may be included in  a collective 
authorship (e.g., “Clinical Investigators ”) or acknowledged individually with their 
contribution(s) specified . 
Individual investigators and/or their associates subsequently may publish additional findings of 
this study in scientific journals or present them at scientific meetings, provided that the Sponsor

A Prospective, Multicent re, Non -Interventional Study Evaluating the Bleeding Inci-
dence in Patients with Von Willebrand Disease Undergoing On- Demand Treatment 
(WIL -29) 
Rationale and Background:  
The purpose of this study is to prospectively obtain reliable data on the bleeding and 
treatment pattern of p atients with VWD undergoing on -demand treatment with a VWF -
containing product over a period of 6 months. The data obtained will be used as a basis for historical comparisons with the bleeding and treatment pattern obtained from  a clinical 
study on the effic acy of prophylactic treatment with a VWF/FVIII concentrate.  
Research Question and Objectives:  
The primary objective of this study is to characterise  the bleeding and treatment pattern of 
patients with type 3, type 2 (except 2N), or severe type 1 VWD undergoing routine on-demand treatment with a VWF -containing product.  
The secondary objectives of this study are to: 
Determine the effectiveness of  the V WF-containing product used  in the treat-
ment of bleeding episodes (BEs)
Determine the effectiveness of  the VWF -containing product used  in surgical
prophylaxis
Assess the quality of life (QoL) of VWD patients undergoing on- demand treat-
ment with a VWF -contain ing product
Assess the safety of the VWF -containing product used for on- demand VWD
treatment
Study Design:  
This is a prospective, multicentre, international, non -controlled non -interventional study.  
Population: 
Patients who meet all of the following criteria are eligible for the study:  
1.Male or female patients aged ≥5.5 years at the time of enrolment
2. VWD type 1 (baseline von Willebrand factor activity [VWF: RCo, <30 IU/dL),
2A, 2B, 2M, or 3 according to medical history requiring substitution therapy
with a VWF -containing product to control bleeding
3. Currently receiving on- demand treatment with a VWF -containing product
4.In female patients of child -bearing potential using hormonal contraception, the
medication class should remain unchanged during the period of participation in
the studyProperty of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission

6.1 VON WILLEBRAND DISEASE  
Inherited von Willebrand disease (V WD) is the most  common inher ited hae morrhag ic dis-
order, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in every 1000 individuals of either sex. There is 
wide geno - and phenotypic variability of the disease, and not all patients with VWD require 
treatment.  
Three types of inher ited VW D are known. W hereas type 1 and type 3 disease are character-
ised by a qua ntitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor ( VWF), VWD type 2 arises from 
a qualitative deficiency of VW F. There are various subtypes within the three inherited types 
of VWD. VWD may also be acquired. 
Of the inherited forms, t ype 1 is the most common, accounting  for 70–80% of cases , fol-
lowed by type 2, which affects approx imate ly 20% of pa tients. Type 3, the most severe 
form of VWD characterised by a complete absence of VWF, is rare and affects about 1 –3% 
of all patients [1]. 
Treatment of VWD depends on the ty pe and sever ity of the dis ease. Whereas m ild to  mod-
erate  forms of type 1 and type 2A disease often respond adequate ly to  treatment with 
desmopressin (1-dea mino-8-D- arginine vasopre ssin, DDAVP), DDAVP  is cont raindicated 
in type 2B and not  effective in  type 3 disease. T reatment with  DDAVP  may  also be cont ra-
indicated for othe r clinical reasons or may be associated with signifi cant side effects.  
The appropriate treatment for the patients in whom DDAVP is ineffective or contraindicated 
are
 VWF/factor VIII (FVIII) concentrates, which have become the mainstay of VWD treat-
ment. Cryoprecipitate, which is screened for viruses but not treated to inac tivate them, is 
also rich in VWF, but is likely to be less safe than the viral- attenuated concentrates [2]. 
VWD affects all ethnic groups and both sexes. Women are more likely to experience symp-toms of VWD and may pose a special treatment challenge because of the physio logical 
events related to menstruation, pregnancy, and birth [3] . If untreated, pregnant women with 
VWD are at increased risk of postpartum bleeding. In women with VWD types 1 or 2, the levels of VWF and FVIII rise 2 - to 3-fold during the second and third trimesters, but fall to 
baseline levels soon after delivery. By contrast, in VWD type 2B, the increase of the abnor-mal VWF can cause or worsen thrombocytopenia. In women with VWD type 3, VWF and FVIII do not increase during pregnancy, so that administration of VWF -containing products 
may be required during pregnancy and at birth [3].

Page  17 of 57 6.2 RATIONALE FOR CONDUCTING THE STUDY  
Bleeding diso rders are a disease area in which good record -keeping is an essential compo-
nent of home -based care. Complete bleeding and treatment records are an essential tool of 
communication between patients and their health -care providers (HCPs), and they help 
HCPs mo nitor patients and medication use to ensure optimal treatment [4 –6]. However, 
record -keeping varies  considerably between treatment centr es and  countries, posing a chal-
lenge when  retrospectively estimating bleeding rates in a reliable manner.  
The purpose of this study is to prospectively obtain reliable data on the bleeding and treat-
ment  pattern of patients with VWD undergoing on- demand treatmen t with a VWF -contain-
ing product over a period of 6 months. The data obtained will be used as a basis for historical 
comparisons with the bleeding  and treatment  pattern  obtained in a clinical study on the ef-
ficacy  of prophylactic treatment with a VWF/FVIII concentrate.

8.1 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a prospective, multicentre, international, non- controlled non- interventional study 
(NIS).  
8.2 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
8.2.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint of this NIS is to characterise  the total annualised bleeding rate (TABR) 
of patients with type 3, type 2 (except 2N), or severe type 1 VWD undergoing routine on -
demand treatment with a VWF -containing product. 
The TABR will be calculated as the total number of spontaneous , traumatic  and other  BEs 
in the time period between the start of data collection for each patient  and the Study Com-
pletion Visit, divided by the duration (in years) between the start of data collection and the 
Study Completion Visit. Surgery periods, and BEs occurring within these surgery periods, 
as well as menstrual bleeds will be excluded from the calculation of TABR.  
8.2.2 Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints of this study are the: 
Spontaneous annualised bleeding rate (SABR), calculated in analogy with TABR
Data on the consumption of the VWF-containing product (VWF/FVIII IU/kg per
month per patient) used for routine on- demand treatment
Effectiveness of VWF -containing product in the treatment of BEs based on the
proportion of successfully treated BEs
Effectiveness of surgical prophylaxis with VWF -containing product based on the
proportion of successfully treated surgeries
QoL based on the PROMIS -29 for all patients , SF-36v2 for patients ≥16 years , and
SF-10 for patients ≥5.5 and <16 years of age.
Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS)
Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart (PBAC) score
Safety of the patient’s VWF -containing product by monitoring adverse drug reac-
tions (ADRs) throughout the study

Page  21 of 57 8.4 STUDY CONDUCT  
8.4.1 Study Setting and Centres  
This study will be conducted in about 20 centres for the treatment of bleeding disorders  
world -wide . 
8.4.2 Study Duration  
The overall study duration will be approximately 2 years. Each patient will be followed for 
around 6 months from the time of enrolment. The study will be considered completed at the 
time of database lock.  
8.4.3 Patient Codes  
Each patient enrolled into this N IS will be uniquely identifiable by a patient code consisting 
of the study code, centre code, and patient number. The centre code is assigned to the study 
site by Octapharma. At each site, enrolled patients will be numbered consecutively. Once assigned to a patient, a patient number will not be reused. 
8.4.4 Study Conduct  
Male or female patients aged ≥5.5 years at the time of enrolment with VWD type 1 (baseline 
von Willebrand factor activity [VWF: RCo], <30 IU/dL), 2A, 2B, 2M, or 3 according to 
medical history having been prescribed on -demand therapy with a VWF -containing product 
to control their bleeding will be included into this study  after written informed consent has 
been obtained (see Section 9.1). 
Patient eligibility for enrolment will be determined at the Screening Visit, during which 
demographic and baseline data, the medical history, and prior medications will be recorded  
(see Section 8.5.1 and Section 8.5.2). Quality of life will also be assessed during the Screen-
ing Visit (see Section 8.5.8).  
Patients and/or their parents or legal guardians will be asked to keep a patient diary to doc-
ument any bleeding and treatment details as well as information on the patients ’ medical 
condition, treatment side effects , other noteworthy medical events , and concomitant medi-
cations throughout the study  (see Section  8.4.5). In addition, treating physicians should en-

8.4.5 Patient  Diaries  
Documenting treatment and bleeding data is an integral part of home treatment for VWD. 
In this study, enrolled patients will be provided with a patient diary during the Screening 
Visit. Patients will be asked to complete their diaries and to bring  them along to each follow-
up visit. The completed diary pages will be collected by the treating physician , and the i n-
formation recorded will be transcribed to the electronic Case Report Forms ( eCRFs ). The 
patient diaries are  considered source data, and th e original diary pages will be included in 
the patient’s medical record.  
The following data should be recorded in the patient diary: 
Bleeding episode data (see Section 8.5.3)
Data on the administration of the VWF -containing product (see Section 8.5.4)
Assessment of the effectiveness of the treatment of BEs  (see Section 8.5.5)
Any medications taken, or other treatments received (e.g., physical therapy, bloodtransfusions), by the patient throughout the duration of the studyProperty of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission

8.5.1 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
The demographic and baseline characteristics are age, ethnic origin, height, weight, AB0 
blood group ( if derivable from the  patient’s medical history), and pregnancy and breast -
feeding status.  
In addition, the Hemophilia Joint He alth Score (HJHS, see Section 8.5.9) will be  obtained. 
Also, target joint(s), defined as having had 3 or more spontaneous BEs into a single joint in 6 consecutive months before the Screening Visit, will be recorded , if available . 
8.5.2 Medical History and Prior Medications  
The medical history as well as prior and concomitant medications will be obtained by patient 
interview.  Records of past diseases and treatments (e.g., hospital discharge letters) will be 
obtained for the study files, if available. 
VWF activity using VWF:RCo, VWF:Gp1bM, VWF:Gp1bR, or any other pertinent method 
will be recorded, as will VWF:Ag, the VWF multimer pattern for VWD type 2A, and the genotype for VWD type 2B, if available. 
In addition, the age at first treatment for VWD and information on on- demand treatment 
with VWF -containing product in the previous 6 months before enrolment will be collected.  
Patients should preferably have a record of at least 6 spontaneous BE s requiring treatment 
in the past 3 months before screening. If this is not the case, the investigator shoul d assess 
whether the patient experiences frequen t enough bleedings to be included in the study. 
For female patients of child -bearing potential, the birth control measures used within 
6 months before enrolment will be documented. For all female patients, an y history of heavy 
menstrual bleeding  will be recorded.  
8.5.3 Bleeding Episode (BE) Data  
Study participants will be instructed by the investigator on recording BEs in the ir patient 
diaries . For any BE occurring during the study , whether treated or not, the following data 
will be recorded:  
BE type (spontaneous, traumatic, postoperative, menstrual , other)
BE site
BE severity (minor, major)  (see Table 4)
Date and time the BE first occurred or was first noticed
Date and time the BE ended
BE treated or not treated
Data on the administration of the VWF -containing product (see Section 8.5.4)
Assessment of the effectiveness of treatment at the end of the BE  (see Section
8.5.5)Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission
NIS Protocol  
WIL -29 CONFIDENTIAL  Version 0 5 
  05-Aug-2020 
Page  24 of 57 All of these parameters will be documented by the patient (together with the treating physi-
cian in case of on -site treatments) in the patient diary . Patients who experience a major BE 
should be treated at the treatment centre, if possible.  
Based on these data, the frequency of BEs and the TABR and SABR under on- demand 
treatment will be calculated.  
If the treatment of a BE in one bleeding site is interrupted for more than 48 hours, two separate BEs will have to be recorded; if, in addition to the original bleeding site, another bleeding site is affected, these events will be recorded as separate BEs at any time.  
The s everity of menstrual bleeding will be categorized as  either  ‘minor or ‘major ’. Thus, 
menstrual bleeding of regular intensity  classified as minor  will be considered normal . Heavy 
menstrual bleeding will be regarded as a BE of ‘major’ severity  (see Table 4). 
BE severity will be assessed using the criteria given in Table 4. 
Table 4 Definition of the Severity of  Bleeding  
Type of bleeding  Description  
Minor bleeding  Mild haemarthrosis (mild swelling, ‘aura,’ pain, warmth of the skin over the joint,
change in range of motion, decrease in mobility and activity, slight difficulty in us-
ing the limb compared with baseline)
Superficial muscle bleed  (pain and/or swelling and functional impairment com-
pared with baseline)
Soft-tissue bleeding (scrape s, superficial cuts such as those cause by shaving
razor, knife, or scissors, bleeding episodes that require frequent bandage
changes, cutaneous bleeds with numerous bruises >1 cm)
Oral bleeding  (superficial mouth bleeds, oozing or bleeding related to tooth erup-
tion or extraction, spontaneous or after brushing/flossing, gum bleeding, bleedingafter bites to lip or tongue)
Most nose bleeds (i.e., those causing distress or interference with daily or social
activities)
Major bleeding Generally , 
requires hospitalization
causes incapacity, significant pain, and  substantial decrease in range of motion of
affected j oint (in case of joint bleeds)
includes symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ  (such as intracranial,
intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraabdominal, intraartic ular, or pericardial
bleeds), intramuscular bleeds with comp artment syndrome, bleeds of the pel-
vic muscles, periorbital bleeds, gastrointestinal bleeds, other cent ral nerv-
ous system bleeds, heavy menstrual bleeding ,* bleeding in the area of the
neck, throat, or pharynx , major trauma, or bleeding causing a decrease in
haemoglobin levels by 20 g/L  (1.24 mmol/L) or more.
*Heavy menstrual bleeding qualifies as ‘major bl eeding’ and is defined as any
menstrual bleeding that
−interferes with daily activities such as work, housework, exercise, or social
activities ,
−requires changing pads /tampons  more  frequently than hourly (referred to as
‘flooding’),
−lasts 7 or more days ,
−includes the presence of clots >1 cm combined with a history of flooding, or
−yields a PBAC score  ≥185.Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission

The following parameters will be documented: 
Name and batch number of VWF-containing product
Dates  and times of injections of VWF -containing product
Doses of VWF -containing product in IU and IU/kg
Purpose of injection with VWF -containing product (treatment of BE, prophylaxis
of recurrent bleeding, surgery , prophylaxis after surgery)
8.5.5 Assessment of the Effectiveness of Treatment of BEs  
At the end of a BE, treatment effectiveness  will be assessed by the patient (together with 
the treating physician  in case of on -site treatment) using the predefined criteria detailed in 
Table 5. The assessment of the treatment effectiveness is not required for menstrual bleed-
ings. 
Table 5 Effectiveness  Assessment  of the Treatment of BEs  
Excellent  Bleeding was completely stopped within 3 days in case of minor bleed, within 7 days in case 
of major bleed, and within 10 days in case of gastrointestinal bleed  
Good  Bleeding was completely stopped, but time and/or dose slightly exceeded expectations  
Moderate  Bleeding could be stopped only by significantly exceeding time and/or dose expectations  
None  Bleeding could be stopped only by using other VWF -containing products  
The proportion of BEs successfully treated with VWF -containing product  will be eval-
uated for all BEs taken together and by BE severity. All effectiveness  ratings assessed as 
either ‘excellent’ or ‘good’ will be considered ‘successfully treated.’

8.5.7 Assessment of the Effectiveness of Surgical Prophylaxis 
An overall assessment of effectiveness  will be made at the end of the postoperative period 
by the treating physician (Table 7). 
Table 7 Effectiveness  Assessment of Surgical Prophylaxis by Treating Physician 
Excellent  Haemostasis similar to that of a haemostatically normal patient 
Good  Mildly abnormal haemostasis in terms of quantity and/or quality (e.g., slight oozing)  
Moderate/poor  Moderately abnormal haemostasis in terms of quantity and/or quality (e.g., moderate, 
controllable bleeding)  
None  Severely abnormal haemostasis in terms of quantity and/or quality (e.g., severe haem-
orrhage that is difficult to control)  
All effectiveness ratings assessed as either ‘excellent’ or ‘good’ will be considered ‘suc-cessfully treated’ surgeries.  
8.5.8 Quality of Life  
For the assessment of QoL, the following instruments will be used: 
Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) -29 [7 –9]
for patients of all ages.  For patients aged  ≥5.5 to <8 years , the questionnaires will
be completed by the patient’s parent/legal guardi an. F or patients ≥8 years , self-re-
porting will be used , if possible.
36-Item Short Form Health Survey, version 2 (SF-36v2, [10] ) for patients ≥16
years
10-Item Short From Health Survey (SF-10, [11] ) for patients ≥ 5.5 and <16 years of
age
The completeness of the questionnaire will be checked by the treating physician , and the 
data will be entered in the e CRF.  Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission

Page  28 of 57 8.5.9 Joint Health Status  
Joint health will be assessed using the Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) [12] , which 
has been specifically validated for the assessment of clinical outcome in VWD [13] . Also, 
target joint(s), defined as having had 3 or more spontaneous BEs into a single joint in 6 
consecutive months before the Screening Visit, will be recorded , if available . 
8.5.10 Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart 
Bleeding information from each menstrual period in this study will be collected using the Pictoria l Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC)  [14, 15]. The PBAC will be provided to all fe-
male patients of child -bearing potential. 
The investigator will train all relevant patients on how to complete th e PBAC . At each study 
visit, the investigator will review the completed PBAC and also calculate the PBAC score. The data documented in the PBAC  and the investigator -calculated final score will be rec-
orded in the eCRF.
 
8.6 DATA SOURCES  
The data source for the calculation of the bleeding rate will be the information documented in the patient diaries as well as the information collected based on the review of the patient’s medical records . 
8.7 DATA MANAGEMENT  
The treating physician will document clinical data as per routine practice in the patients’ medical records and transfer information to the study- specific eCRF as required.  
If any errors in the eCRFs are found during data review, queries will be generated and sub-mitted to the site personnel. Once the query has been answered, Data Management will review the new or changed data to ensure an appropriate response and close the query. 
8.8 DATA ANALYSIS  
No formal sample size calculations were performed. The sample size of 55 patients was 
chosen based on feasibility and to allow data summaries to be produced. However, with a sample size of 55, a two -sided 95% confidence interval for the mean ABR will extend ± 0.8 
from the observed mean, assuming that the standard deviation is 3 or less and the confidence interval is based on the large sample z statistic.  
The data will be analysed using descriptive statistical methods. Full details of the planned analyses will be given in a Statistical Analysis Plan, which will be completed before data analys is.

REACTIONS  
10.1 SAFETY MONITORING  
Throughout this NIS , all adverse drug reactions  and other relevant safety information be-
coming known or arising during treatment with any of the VWF -containing products used 
in this study and as defined  below have to be documented and reported to Octapharma. 
10.1.1 Definition of A dverse D rug Reaction and O ther Safety Information 
Adverse Drug R eaction  
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and 
unintended [ Directive  2001/83/EC Art. 1(11)]. 
‘Response’ here means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an ad-
verse event  (AE) is at least a reasonable possibility [Guideline ICH-E2A]. 
ADRs may arise from the use of a product within or outside the terms of the marketing 
authorisation or from occupational exposure [ Directive  2001/83/EC Art 101(1)]. Conditions 
of use outside the marketing authorisation include off -label use, overdose, misuse, abuse , 
and medication errors.  
Serious A dverse Drug R eaction  
A serious ADR (SADR) is an ADR  that fulfil s at least one of the following criteria:  
Results in death
Is life -threatening (this implies that the patient was at risk of death at the time of
the event ; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused
death if more severe)
Requires in -patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing in -patient hospitali-
sation (hospitalisation does not refer to the treatment of an ADR on an out- patient
status)
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Is a medically important event , e.g. ,
– Suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product
– Inhibitor development– Thromboembolic event– Other reactions that should be reported in an expedited manner , although they
did not immediately result in one of the above seriousness criteria, e.g., inten-sive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm,blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisationProperty of Octapharma.

Page  33 of 57 Other R elevant S afety Information 
Other relevant safety information is any information relating to : 
Pregnancies  or breast -feeding
Drug abuse (persistent, sporadic, or intentional excessive use of a medicinal prod-
uct inconsistent with the product’s summary of product characteristics ( SmPC) or
prescribing information, or acceptable medical practice)
Misuse  (situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately
used not in accordance with the authorised product information)
Overdose ( administration of a dose of a medicinal product given per administration
or cumulatively which is above the maximum recommended dose according to theauthorised product information)
Medication errors (prescribing or dispensing error)
Interactions with other medicinal products or devices
Occupational exposure  (an exposure to a medicinal product as a result of one’s
professional or non-professional occupation) associated with any VWF concentrateused during this study, even if no ADR  occurred.
10.1.2 R
eporting of A dverse D rug Reactions and O ther Relevant Safety I nfor-
mation  
For information about possible ADRs and other relevant safety information associated with each product used during this study, refer to the local summary of product characteristics  or 
prescribing information. 
Patients who carry out home treatment should be asked to inform their treating physicians 
about any relevant safety information as soon as they become aware of it. The treating phy-sician will then assess the causal relationship of any events f or ADRs and report these and 
other relevant drug safety information as required.  
ADRs in patients treated with Wilate  
All suspected (serious and non-serious) ADRs and other relevant safety information asso-
ciated with the administration of  Wilate  have to be  reported in the Case Safety Report 
Form  (CSRF)  (see Section 13, Annex 1 ), which should be sent, by email , to the local safety 
units within one business day . The contact details of the local safety units are given in Sec-
tion 13, Annex 2 . 
Quarterly a reconciliation shall be made between study team  and local safety units  to ensure 
all ADR and other safety relevant information have  been completely forwarded to local 
safety units . Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission

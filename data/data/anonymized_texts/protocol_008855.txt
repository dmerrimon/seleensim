CONFIDENTIAL2.0 STUDY SUMMARY
Name of Sponsor(s):
Takeda Development Center Americas, Inc.Compound:
Soticlestat (also known as TAK -935)
Title of Protocol: A Multicenter, Randomized, 
Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Parallel Group Study to 
Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Soticlestat 
as Adjunctive Therapy in Pediatric and Adult Subjects With 
Lennox -Gastaut Syndrome (LGS)IND No.: 133627 EudraCT No.:
2021 -002481 -40
Study Number: TAK -935-3002 Amendment 2 Phase: 3
Study Design:
This is a phase 3, global, multicenter, 1:1 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of soticlestat as an adjunctive therapy in pediatric and adult subjects with 
LGS. The treatment period is 16 weeks. The total duration of the study is approximately 25 weeks for subjects who 
complete the study and choose not to roll over to the open -label ext ensio n (OLE) study. For those who roll over to the 
OLE study, the study duration is 3 weeks shorter.
Appro ximately 234 male and female pediatric and adult subjects will be randomized.
The study  will consist of the following periods:
4-to 6-week screeni ng/baseline period. The minimum visit window for screening is 28 days (ie, Visit 2/Day 0
cannot occur earlier than 29 days after screening).
16-week full treatment period:
–
4-week titration period.
–
12-week maintenance period.
1-week taper period for those discontinuing study drug, followed by a 2 -week safety follow -up visit or a phone 
call.
This is a 2 -arm study. All subjects will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive standard of care (SOC) plus one of the 
following adjunctive th erapies: soticlestat or pl acebo.
Soticlestat or matching placebo added to current antiseizure therapy will be administered orally twice daily (BID) with 
or without food or via gastrostomy tube (G -tube) or low -profile gastric tube (MIC-KEY button). A jejunostomy tube 
(J-tube) may be considered following written approval by the medical monitor or sponsor. Note: Study drug will be 
administered only orally for subjects enrolled in sites in jurisdictions where alternative means are not permitted.
All doses will be blinded and will unde rgo the same titration scheme, with the same number and type of 
tablets/mini -tabs. Subjects randomized to placebo will undergo a mock titration to ensure the blind is maintained (see 
tables below).

CONFIDENTIALThe total daily dose of study drug (either placebo or sot iclestat) will be calculated based on body weight at Visit 1 
(screening visit) and given BID starting on the morning after Visit 2/Day 0 (ie, on study Day 1) (see tables below). The 
100 mg BID dose (or 100 mg BID equivalent weight -based dosing for weight < 45 kg) is the minimum dose allowed 
during the study. Subjects who cannot tolerate the minimal dose will be discontinued from the study. Subjects 
weighing <45 kg will be dispensed 20 mg mini -tablets or matching placebo. Subjects weighing ≥45 kg may be 
dispe nsed 20 mg mini -tablets or 100 mg tablets or matching placebo.

The study  design allows virtual visits if aligned with institutional or local guidelines, via phone or via any platforms 
approved by local regulations, in addition to the communication platform offered through the study. Screening (Visit 
1) and Visit 11 (D ay 113)/early termination must be conducted in person; Visit 9 is to be conducted in person if 
possible but may be conducted virtually (via video or phone) in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID -19) 
pandemic and/or based on sponsor approval and if permitted by local regulations. In extenuating circumstances, the 
randomization visit (Visit 2) and Visit 11 (Day 113)/early termination can be virtual visits (only via video, not phone), 
with sponsor approval and if permitted by local regulations. In addition, any visit identified as a virtual visit in this 
protocol may be conducted in clinic and in person if requested by the subject/parent or guardian and/or at the 
investigator’s discretion.
Dose Titration Period (4 Weeks):
Subjects will take the first dose of study drug (Dose 1) the day after the study medication is received. Approximately 7 
days after initiating study medication, if there are no tolerability issues, study drug dose will be increased to Dose 2. 
After approximately 7 days on Dose 2, if there are no tolerability issues, study drug dose will be increased to Dose 3. 
If the subjects do not experience any tolerability issues, they will continue on Dose 3 for the remainder of the titration 
period. Subjects will only be allowed to increase their dose within the 4 -week titration period before entering the 
12-week maintenance period. Decrease in dose level is allowed during the titration period if required for safety and 
tolerability. Subjects who cannot tolerate the minimum dose of 100 mg BI D (or weight -
based equivalent dosing <45 
kg) will be discontinued from treatment. The maximum allowed dose is 300 mg BID. The subjects/parents or 
caregivers will be contacted by phone within approximately 2 days following each dose escalation to assess saf ety and 
tolerability of the study drug. The final dose tolerated by the end of the 4 -week titration period should be maintained 
until the end of the maintenance period, unless tolerability issues arise.
Maintenance Period (12 Weeks):
The dose level at the end of the titration period will be maintained until the end of the maintenance; period (dose 
increases are not permitted); however, during the maintenance period, the dose may be decreased by 1 dose level to the 
previous lower dose, for safety and tolerab ility issues. For example, Dose 3 may be reduced to Dose 2, and Dose 2 may 
be reduced to Dose 1. The minimum dose is Dose 1 (100 mg BID adult reference dose; or weight -based equivalent 
dosing for <45 kg); subjects who cannot tolerate the minimum dose of 10 0 mg BID will be discontinued from 
treatment. Dose changes during the maintenance period are allowed for safety or tolerability reasons as assessed by the 
investigator; however, if possible, dose changes will need to be discussed with the medical monitor and/or the sponsor.

CONFIDENTIALStudy Discontinuation/Completion:
At Visit 11/early termination, subjects will have the option to enroll in the OLE study as per that study’s 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Subjects who enroll in the OLE study on the same day as Visit 11/early termination will take their final dose of 
double -blind study drug in the evening of the day of Visit 11/early termination and should continue to record seizures 
in the seizure diary until midnight of the day of Visit 11/early termination, at which time they will exit the study.
Subjects who do not roll over to the OLE study on the same day as Visit 11/early termination will take their final dose 
of double -blind study  drug in the morning of Visit 11/early termination, followed by a taper period. The study drug 
dose will be tapered down to a lower dose (taper Dose 3 to Dose 2, taper Dose 2 to Dose 1) approximately ever y 3 days 
until the study drug dose is discontinued. The subject/parent or caregiver should continue to record seizures in the 
seizure d iary until the safety follow -up pho ne call, which will occur approximately 14 days after the last dose of study 
drug. After completion of the safety follow -up phone call, the subject will exit the study.
Subjects/parents or caregivers who choose to enroll in the OLE study after Visit 11/early termination will continue the 
taper procedure until the investigator confirms eligibility for the OLE study; the subject will then exit the study and 
roll over to the OLE study.
Primary Objectives:
To assess the efficacy of soticlestat in reducing MMD seizure frequency as add-on therapy to SOC as compared 
with placebo during the full treatment period (titration + maintenance).
For European Medicines Agency (EMA) registration:
To assess the efficacy o f soticlestat in reducing MMD seizure frequency  as add -on therapy  to SOC compared with 
placebo during the maintenance period only.
Secondary Objectives:
To assess the following in subjects taking soticlestat as compared with placebo during the full treatment period, unless 
otherwise noted:
Proportio n of treatment responders defined as those with ≥50% reduction in MMD seizures from baseline during 
the maintenance period and the full treatment period. 
Effect on total seizure frequency of all seizure types d uring the maintenance period and the full treatment period.
Change f rom baseline in proportion of MMD seizure –free days.
Longest MMD seizure –free interval.
Number of days when rescue antiseizure medications (ASMs) are used.

Statistical Considerations:
Efficacy Analyses
The seizure frequency will be calculated based on all data collected during the baseline and treatment periods. For all 
efficacy analyses on seizure frequency, baseline refers to the prospective 4 -to 6-week baseline period. The efficacy 
endpoints will be summarized for each treatment group, and comparisons will be made between soticlestat and 
placebo groups. Percent change from baseline in MMD seizure frequency per 28 days will be analyzed using rank 
analy sis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment group as the main effect; age group ( ≤6 years, >6 years) and 
baseline seizure frequency will be covariates. Sensitivity analyses will be performed using the van Elteren test and the 
Wilcoxon rank sum test. Gender will also be added to the rank ANCOVA model as a sen sitivity analysis.
Percent change from baseline in frequency of all seizures per 28 days will be compared between soticlestat and 
placebo using rank ANCOVA, adjusting for baseline seizure frequency and age stratum. The Hodges -Lehmann 
estimator and the corr esponding 95% CI comparing soticlestat and placebo will also be displayed.
The proportion of responders will be analyzed using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by age group ( ≤6 years, 
>6 years).

CONFIDENTIALThe main analysis for CGI -I (clinician), Care GI -I, CGI-I Seizure Severity and Duration, CGI -I Nonseizure 
Symptoms, and QI -Disability scores will be based on the responses at each subject’s last visit during which these 
instruments were utilized. The QI -Disability scores will be analyzed with a mixed model for repeated measures and 
the other scores will be analyzed using ordinal logistic regression. A sensitivity analysis will be performed using the 
van Elteren test stratified by the 2 age groups. A supportive analysis based on responses for completers at th e end of 16 
weeks of treatment will also be performed using ordinal logistic regression.
The global type I error will be controlled using a hierarchical gatekeeping procedure on the primary and secondary 
endpoints. The order of testing will be soticlestat versus placebo for the primary endpoint, responder rate, Care GI -I, 
CGI-I (clinician), CGI-I Nonseizure Symptoms, QI -Disability, and CGI -I Seizure Intensity and Duration. All 
statistical tests will be 2 -sided at the 5% significance level. Techniques for ha ndling missing information with respect 
to reporting of seizures in the treatment period and with respect to subjects who discontinue early will be specified in 
detail in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).
Safety Analyses
Descriptive statistics will be u sed to summarize all safety endpoints for each of the 2 treatment groups. Two -sided 
95% CIs will be presented where meaningful. Data summaries will be displayed for incidence of AEs, clinical 
laborato ry variables, vital signs, body weight, and ECG paramete rs, as appropriate.
Exploratory/Additional Analyses
Percent change from baseline in each seizure type frequency per 28 days during the full treatment period will be 
compared between soticlestat and placebo using rank ANCOVA ,adjusting for baseline seizure frequency and age 
stratum. The Hodges -Lehmann estimator and the corresponding 95% CI comparing soticlestat and placebo will also 
be displayed.
Health care resource utilization, including but not limited to emergency room vis its and hospitalizations, and the effect 
on the EQ -5D-5L quality of life scale will be analyzed for soticlestat and placebo. Descriptive and graphical analyses 
will be used to summarize results from the exploratory endpoints.
Alpha-1 acidic glycoprotein wi ll be analyzed as part of the laboratory serum chemistry panel at each visit where PK 
samples are obtained.
Plasma concentrations of soticlestat and metabolite(s) will be summarized and displayed graphically per nominal time 
points. Mean plasma concentrations over time will be presented graphically.
Correlation of change in PD (24HC) exposure and efficacy (change in MMD seizure over the full treatment period) 
will be investigated.
Sample Size Justification: The study will randomize a total of ap proximately 234 subjects at a 1:1 ratio to receive 1 
dose level of soticlestat or placebo, resulting in approximately 117 subjects per arm.
The primary endpoint for this study is the percent change from baseline in MMD seizure frequency per 28 days. The 
definition for MMD is different for this study than for ELEKTRA, however, the variability of this endpoint is assumed 
to be the same. This leads to an assumption that the pooled SD of the percent change from baseline in MMD seizure 
frequency  is 65%.
A differ ence of 26.5% in mean percent reduction in MMD seizure frequency between treatments is an appropriate 
target. A sample size of 117 subjects per treatment arm will provide at least 85% power at a two -tailed 5% significance 
level to detect a difference of 26 .5% in mean percent reduction in seizure frequency between treatments using the 
Wilcoxon rank -sum test, assuming the pooled SD above of 65%.

CONFIDENTIAL4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
Lennox -Gastaut syndro me (LGS) is rare and is one of the most severe forms of childhood 
epilepsy . The syndrome usually has its onset between the ages of 1 and 8 years, but occasionally it  
occurs in children who are older than 8 years, or even into adulthood . LGS includes the presence of 
multiple seizure ty pes: the hallmark tonic -atonic drop seizures. Other seizure ty pes include 
atypical absence seizures, but tonic -clonic, my oclonic, and partial  seizures are also frequently 
present. 
Soticlestat i s a fi rst-in-class small mo lecule inhibit or of cho lesterol -24 hydroxylase (CH24H) in 
the brain. It is hypothesized that soticlestat treatment will decrease the levels o f 
24S- hydroxycho lesterol  (24HC) and improve MMD seizure control in LGS subjects. Nonclinical 
studi eshave dem onstrated that soti clestat m odulates the gl utam atergic si gnaling and significantly 
reduces spontaneous seizure in murine models of LGS. Clinical Study  TAK -935-2002 
(ELEKTRA) showed efficacy  of soticlestat in subjects with Dravet syndrome (DS) or L GS.
ELEKTRA was a phase 2, mult icenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study  that 
evaluated the efficacy , safet y, tolerabilit y, pharmacokinet ics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) 
of soticlestat as adjunct ive therapy in pediatric subjects aged ≥2 and ≤17 years with LGS or DS. A 
total of 141 subjects were enrolled (51 with DS and 90 wi th LGS), and 126 com pleted the study . 
Subjects were eligible for enrollment if they demonstrated ≥3convulsive seizures (in the DS 
cohort) or ≥4 drop seizures (in th e LGS cohort) during a minimum of 4 weeks during the 
prospective baseline period (based on the seizure diary  records), and they  were currently on a 
stable regimen of 1 to 4 concomitant antiseizure medicat ions (ASMs). This study  consisted of 
2main periods, a 4-to 6-week screening/baseline period, fo llowed by a 20 -week treatm ent period 
(8-week titration and dose -optimizat ion peri od and a 12 -week maintenance period). Subjects who 
met the entry  criteria were stratified by syndro me and randomized in a 1:1 rati o to soti clestat or 
matching placebo within each cohort. Subjects were dosed with oral 20 mg or 100 mg soticlestat 
tablets or m atching pl acebo at 100 mg twice daily (BID) for 1 week, followed by 200 mg BID for 
another week, before titrating up to 300 mg BI D, the maximum allowable dose. Subjects weighing 
<60 kg were dosed by  weight.
In the DS cohort (n = 51), subjects treated with soticlestat demonstrated a 33.8% median reduct ion 
in convulsive seizure frequency co
mpared with a 7.0% median increase seen in su bjects taking 
placebo during the 20 -week treatm ent peri od (m edian placebo -adjusted reducti on in convulsive 
seizure frequency was 46.0%; p = 0.0007). The responder rate ( ≥50% reduction in convulsive 
seizure frequency compared with baseline) for subjects taking soticlestat in the DS cohort was 
30.8% while for placebo was 0%. In the LGS cohort (n=88), soticlestat decreased drop seizures by 
a median of 20.6% as compared wit h a m edian decrease of 6% in the placebo group (median 
placebo -adjusted reducti on in seiz ure frequency  was 14.8%, p=0.1279) during the 20- week 
treatm ent peri od. Other secondary  endpoints included the Clinical Glo bal Im pressi on of Change 
(CGI -C) and the Caregiver Global Impression o f Change (Care GI -C). For the CGI- C, more 
soticlestat -treated D S and LGS subjects showed improvement than those receiving placebo

CONFIDENTIAL(26.9% versus 8% and 27.9% versus 11.1%, respectively) as deemed by the invest igator. 
Caregivers also rated greater improvement in 57.7% and 51.2% of soticlestat -treated DS and LGS 
subjects compared wi th 32% and 28.9% of those receiving placebo, respectively , as assessed by  
the Care GI -C.
In ELEKTRA, soticlestat was generally well tolerated and safet y data were consistent with 
findings in previous studies. The incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was 
similar in the treatment and placebo groups with 57 (80.3%) (n=57) of soticlestat subjects 
experiencing at least 1 TEAE compared with 52 (74.3%) of placebo subjects. The most common 
TEAEs in the soticlestat group were upper resp iratory  tract infect ion, py rexia, seizure, 
nasopharyngit is, decreased appetite, and vo miting. The most frequent TEAEs reported in 
soticlestat -treated subjects with ≥5% difference from placebo were lethargy and const ipation. The 
incidence of serious TEAEs w as similar in both soticlestat and placebo groups, with 11 (15.5%) in 
the soti clestat group experiencing at least 1 serious TEAE compared with 13 (18.6%) in the 
placebo group. Four soticlestat (5.6%) subjects discontinued the study  com pared wi th 3 in the 
placebo group (4.3%) due to TEAEs. 
More informat ion about the known and expected benefits, risks, and reasonably anticipated 
adverse events (AEs) of soticlestat may be found in the current edit ion of the Invest igator’s 
Brochure (IB).
4.2 Rationale for the Prop osed Study
Soticlestat has shown ant iseizure efficacy  in nonclinical studi es, incl uding m odels relevant to the 
rare developmental epilept ic encephalopathies (DEEs) that are inadequately treated by  current 
adjunctive ant iepileptic drugs. In phase 1 studies in healt hy adult subjects and in phase 1b/2a 
(TAK -935- 2001) and phase 2 (ELEKTRA) studies in adult and pediatric subjects with DEEs, 
acceptable PK and safet y characterist ics have been observed.
Based on the efficacy , safet y, and tol erabilit y data collected in the phase 2 ELEKTRA study, 
combined wit h the safet y and tol erabili ty data from  phase 1 and other com pleted or ongoing 
studi es (please see the IB), soticlestat is being proposed as adjunct ive therapy in pediatric and adult  
subjects wi th LGS, a hi ghly impacted popul ation with great unm et need. Thi s phase 3 study  will 
evaluate the efficacy , safet y, and tolerabilit y of soticlestat in this populat ion. The current study  is 
designed to further characterize the effects of soticlestat on MMD seizure frequency by using a 
seizure diary  in subjects wi th LGS. Addit ional aims are to assess efficacy by the investigator 
(characteri zed by  Clinical Gl obal Impressi on of Improvem ent [CGI -I]) as well as by the 
caregivers, CGI -I in nonseizure -related symptom s, impact on quali ty of life, and the safet y, 
tolerabilit y, PK, and PD (24HC) of soticlestat administration in pediatric and adult subjects with 
LGS.

CONFIDENTIALgenerally well tolerated in subjects with DEEs at doses up to 300 mg BID ( weight -based dosing for 
<60 kg).
The fo llowing have been ident ified as important potential risks and are being closely mo nitored 
during the clinical development program:
Neurol ogical and psychiatric effects (clinical safety data and risks associated with c ompounds 
affect ing glutamate excitotoxicit y).
Cogni tive effects (soticlestat inhibit ion of neuronal CH24H and clinical safet y data).
Suicidal  ideati on or behaviors (class effect of ASMs).
Cataracts (nonclinical data).
Corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongat ion (nonclinical data).
More informat ion about the known and expected benefits and reasonably anticipated AEs of 
soticlestat m ay be found in the current edit ion of the IB. This study will further examine risk and 
establish benefit in LGS. This study  will enroll subjects aged 2 to 55 years, inclusive. 
LGS i s characteri zed by  multiple treatm ent-resistant sei zure ty pes, abnorm al 
electroencephalogram (EEG), and intellectual impairment. Given the severe, profound, and 
chronic nature of LGS, its impact on qualit yof life, and i ts associ ated si gns and symptom s, and 
considering the potential benefits that can be conferred to patients affected by  LGS, the 
benefit -risk profile is acceptable for this population.

6.0 STUDY DESIGN AND DESCRIPTION
6.1 Stud
y Design
This is a phase 3, global, mult icenter, 1:1 randomized, double -blind, pl acebo -controlled, 
parallel- group study  to evaluate the efficacy, safet y, and tolerabilit y of soticlestat as an adjunct ive 
therapy  in pediatric and adult subjects with LGS . The treatm ent period is approximately 16 weeks. 
The total duration of the study is approximately 25 weeks for subjects who complete the study and 
choose not to roll over to the open -label extensio n (OLE) study . For those who roll over to the 
OLE study , the st udy duration is 3 weeks shorter.
Approximately 234 male and female pediatric and adult subjects will be rando mized. 
This study  consists of the fo llowing peri ods:
4-to 6-week screening/baseline period. The minimum duration for screening is 28 days 
(ie,Visit 2/Day  0 cannot occur earlier than 29 days after screening).
16-week treatment period.
4-week ti tration peri od.
12-week m aintenance period.
1-week taper period for those discont inuing study drug, followed by a 2 -week safet y follow-up 
visit or phone call .
This is a 2- arm study . All subjects m eeting entry criteria will be rando mized at a 1:1 ratio to 
receive SOC plus 1 of the fo llowing adjunct ive therapies: soticlestat or placebo.

visit (Visit 1); this will need to be discussed with the medical mo nitor and/or sponsor.
6.1.1 Dose Titration Period (4 We eks)
Subjects will take the first dose of study  drug (Dose 1) the day  after the study  medicat ion is 
received. Approximately 7 days after init iating study medicat ion, ifthere are no tolerabilit y issues, 
study  drug dose will be increased to Dose 2. After approximately  7 days on Dose 2, if there are no 
tolerabilit y issues, study  drug dose will be increased to Dose 3. If the subjects do not experience 
any tol erabilit y issues, they  will cont inue on Dose 3 for the remainder of the titration period. 
Subjects will only be allowed to increase their dose within the 4- week ti tration peri od before 
entering the 12- week maintenance period. Decrease in dose level is allowed during the titration 
period if required for safety  and tol erabilit y. Subjects who cannot tolerate t he minimum dose of 
100 mg BID (or weight -based equivalent dosing <45 kg) will be discont inued from treatment. The 
maximum allowed dose is 300 mg BID. The subjects/parents or caregivers will be contacted by  
phone within approximately 2 days fo llowing each d ose escalat ion to assess safet y and tolerabilit y 
of the study  drug. The final dose tolerated by  the end of the 4 -week ti tration peri od shoul d be

6.2.1 Study Design
This is a rando mized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study  to further evaluate 
the safet y, tolerabilit y, and efficacy  of soticlestat as adjunct ive therapy in pediatric and adult 
subjects wi th LGS .
Randomization o f subjects in the study  will be stratified by  age group and country . The strata for 
stratificat ion by age group will be: ≤6 years and >6 years; these age -group randomization strata 
will be included as a fixed effect factor in the statistical model for the analysis o f the primary 
endpoint.
The strata for stratificat ion by co untry  will be: China, Japan, and the rest of the world. This country 
stratificat ion is planned to be implemented for an administrative reason and therefore will not be 
included in the primary  analysis model.
Durin g this study , subjects will cont inue their current ASMs; therefore, placebo was chosen as the 
control  group to provide maximum difference between the treatment and control arms.

CONFIDENTIAL6.2.2 Endpoints
An ideal outcom e measure for assessment of seizures should be clinic ally relevant, easily 
ident ifiable, and reliably counted by the parent or caregiver. The primary endpo int is percent 
change from baseline in MMD seizure frequency  per 28 day s for those subj ects on soti clestat 
compared wit h placebo during the 16- week treatm ent period (for EMA regions, analysis will only 
include MMD seizure frequency during the 12 -week m aintenance period). In close cooperation 
with researchers in the epilepsy field and epileptologists, and in consent with The Epilepsy Study  
Consortium (TESC) and consistent with the International League Against Epilepsy seizure 
classificat ion, the sponsor will evaluate soticlestat’s effect in the percent change fro m baseline in 
MMD seizures co mpared with placebo during the full treatment period (or maintenance period for 
EMA registration regions) as the primary efficacy endpo int using the modified intent -to-treat 
(mITT) analysis set.
The secondary  and exploratory  endpoints defined are clinically  meaningful  and consistent wi th 
seizure studies in similar populat ions. The secondary efficacy endpo ints and exploratory endpoints 
could elucidate benefit s outsi de of  seizure reduction to demonstrate soticlestat’s potential impact 
on overall qualit y of life for the subjects (QI- Disabilit y) and f or the parents/caregivers 
(EQ-5D- 5L) and explore the potential for 24HC to be a bio marker for optimal demo nstrati on of  
efficacy .
Measurement of plasma 24HC levels is included in this study  as a PD bi omarker rel ated to the 
mechanism o f action of  soticlestat.
The safet y-related endpoin ts of TEAEs, clinical laboratory  test resul ts, vi tal sign measurements, 
C-SSRS m easurements, and ECG parameters selected for this study  are standard m ethods for 
assessing safet y and tol erabili ty in clinical studies as well as the potential risks for soticl estat.
6.2.3 Dose
Dose sel ection is based on a comprehensive analysis of the safet y, tolerabilit y, PK, and PD data 
from 4 com pleted single -and m ultiple-dose phase 1 studies in healthy subjects; the safet y, 
tolerabilit y, and PK data from the phase 1b/2a study  of soticlestat as adjunct ive therapy in adult 
subjects with DEEs; and the efficacy , safet y, PK, and PD data in the ELEKTRA study  in pediatric 
subjects with DS or LGS, where the same target dose of 300 mg BID (weight -based equivalent in 
pediatrics) demonstrated statist ically significant and clinically meaningful seizure reduction in DS 
subjects while maintaining a favorable safet y and tol erabili ty profile. Num erical reducti on in 
seizure frequency was also noted in subjects with LGS .
The efficacy o f soticlestat is related to CH24H inhibit ion and a decrease in 24HC levels in humans. 
The extent of CH24H inhibit ion required for efficacy  was estimated in an animal model of 
epilepsy . In a m ouse pent ylenetetrazol -induced kindling development model, effects of soticlestat 
on sei zure severi ty were associ ated wi th the degree of CH24H inhibit ion (Nishi  et al . 2020 ). A 
75% reduction in the severit y score was associated with 90% reduction in brain 24HC levels. The 
minimum required 24HC lowering for efficacy was approximately 60%, yielding 40% decrease in 
the severit y score. The 24HC lowering effect was then con verted into 65% of the CH24H enzyme 
occupancy  (EO) rate, using a m odel established in mice ( Target occupancy  evaluat ion for

CONFIDENTIALcholesterol  24-hydroxylase (CH24H) inhibi tor, s oticlestat , with liquid chro matography /tandem  
mass spectrometry . Report number:16354 ). In summary , these preclinical pharmacology  studi es 
suggest that high degree of target occupancy ( ≥65%) and 24HC reduction (≥60%) are considered 
to be rel ated to the efficacy in the nonclinical animal model. 
The target dose of 300 mg BID (weight -based eq uivalent in pedi atrics) will achieve the degree 
target occupancy and 24HC reduction required for efficacy. Based on a populat ion PK/PD/EO 
model using data from 4 phase 1 studies in healthy subjects, the phase 1b/2a study in adult subjects 
with DEEs, and th e TAK -935- 2002 (ELEKTRA) study  in pediatric subjects with DS or LGS, the 
300 m
g BID dose (wei ght-based equivalent in pediatrics) is est imated to achieve approximately 
90% EO with approximately 82% decrease in 24HC level and potentially result ing in efficacy.
In addit ion, the same soticlestat target dose of 300 mg BID (adul t reference dose; weight -based 
equivalent dosing <60 kg) was administered in ELEKTRA, and demonstrated seizure reduction in 
LGS subjects while maintaining a favorable safet y and tolerabilit y profile. Approximately 79% of 
subjects in the double -blind, rando mized, placebo -controlled ELEKTRA study  were able to be 
titrated up to and maintained on 300 mg BID (or adult weight -based equivalent) until the end of the 
maintenance period. Soticlestat -treated subjects with LGS reported a 20.6% median reduction in 
drop seizures while those subjects receiving placebo experienced a median decrease of 6% in drop 
seizures (median placebo -adjusted reducti on in seizure frequency was 14.8%) over the 20 -week 
treatm ent peri od. Responder rates ( ≥50% reduction in drop seizure frequ ency com pared wi th 
baseline) for soticlestat -treated subjects with LGS were 16.3% versus 13.3% in placebo, 
respectively . Soti clestat was generally safe and well tolerated at this dose in this study , and safet y 
was consistent with previous studies with no n ew signals identified. The incidence of TEAEs was 
similar between the DS and LGS strata compared wit h placebo with 57 soticlestat subjects (80.3%) 
experiencing at least 1 TEAE compared wit h 52 placebo subjects (74.3%). The most frequent 
TEAEs reported in s oticlestat -treated subjects with ≥5% difference from placebo were lethargy  
and const ipation. The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was similar in both soticlestat 
and placebo groups, with 11 (15.5%) in the soticlestat group experiencing at least 1
treatm ent-emergent SAE compared with 13 (18.6%) in the placebo group. There were no deaths 
reported. The combinat ion of drop seizure reduction and favorable tolerabilit y and safet y profile in 
ELEKTRA support the select ion of 300 mg BID as the soticlestat target dose (adult reference dose; 
weight-based equivalent dosing <45 kg BID).
Before reaching the target dose in the current study, subjects will receive the minimum soticlestat 
dose (ie, 100 mg BID adult equivalent dose for 1 week, followed by 200 mg BID adult equivalent  
dose for 1 week) in the titration phase. The goal of titration is to reach the target final dose of 300 
mg BID adult equivalent dose after a 14 -day titration period; the same titration regimen was 
evaluated in study  ELEKTRA and demonstrat ed a favorable safet y and tol erabilit y profile in 
addition to drop seizure reduction as above. 
The weight -based equivalent dosing in pediatrics was determined using the populat ion PK model. 
Simulations were conducted using body weight intervals of 1 kg, d ose strengths fro m 40 to 300 mg 
using 20 mg mini -tablets and 100 mg tablets, and a BID dosing regimen. A total of 10,000 
simulat ions of steady -state exposure (median area under the plasma concentration -time curve

CONFIDENTIAL[AUC]) were performed. A threshold for the fraction of subjects at or above the reference value 
was set to 35%. Setting the percentage thresho ld at “35%” ensures the safet y of pedi atric subjects 
as the reference AUC values are median steady -state AUC values in adult s, ie, 50% of the adult 
popul ation has AUCs above the reference AUC values while no more than 35% of pediatric 
popul ation will have AUCs above the reference AUC values). Furthermore, an effort has been 
made to keep pediatric exposure fro m exceeding the 90th percentile of the adult exposure. The 
resul ting weight -based equivalent dosing in pediatrics is provided in Table 6.athrough Table 6.d.

The primary  reason for di scont inuat ion or wi thdrawal  of the subject from  the study  shoul d be 
recorded in the eCRF using the c ategori es detailed in this sect ion. For screen failure subjects, refer 
to Section 9.1.18 .
Study  subjects will be wit hdrawn fro m the study /study  drug for the fo llowing reasons:
1.Failure to meet continuat ion criteria: Enrollment in any  other clinical  study  involving an 
investigat ional product or enrollment in any  other type of clinical trial judged not to be 
scientifically or medically co mpatible wit h this study .
2.Withdrawal by invest igator (Note: The specific reason for discont inuat ion must be recorded in 
the eCRF, and is only to be used if no other pertinent reason for discont inuat ion is applicable):
a)The invest igator decides that the subject should be discontinued from the study .
b)If the subject, for any  reason, requi res treatm ent with another therapeutic agent, 
discontinuat ion from the study  occurs before introduction of the new agent.
3.Withdrawal by subject/parent or legal guardian (Note: The specific reason for discontinuatio n 
shoul d be recorded in the eCRF and is only to be used if no other pertinent reason for 
discontinuat ion is applicable). All attempts should be made to determine the underlying reason 
for the wi thdrawal  and, where possible, the pri mary  underlying reason should be recorded (ie, 
withdrawal  due to a TEAE shoul d not be recorded in this category . Similarly, l ack of  efficacy 
shoul d not be recorded in this category ).
4.Sponsor decisio n:
a)The sponsor or its designee discont inues the study.
b)Thesponsor or its designee discont inues the subject’s participat ion in the study  for 
medical, safet y, regul atory , or other reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulat ions, 
and GCP.
c)The sponsor or its designee stops the clinical study at a particular sit e.
5.Discontinuati on due to AE: The subject has experienced an AE that requires early terminat ion 
because cont inued participat ion imposes an unacceptable risk to the subject’s health, or the 
subject is unwilling to continue because of the AE.
If the invest igator deci des that the subject should be withdrawn because of an AE or a 
clinically significant laboratory  value, the study  drug is to be discont inued and appropriate 
measures are to be taken. The sponsor or its designee is to be alerted immediately.
a)LFT abnorm alities: Study  drug shoul d be discont inued immediately (wit hdrawal o f the 
subject from the study  shoul d be discussed wit h the sponsor/medical mo nitor) wi th 
appropriate clinical fo llow-up, including repeat laboratory tests, until a subject’s laborator y 
profile has returned to normal/baseline status (see Section 9.3.1 ) if the fo llowing 
circumstances occur at any  time during study  drug treatm ent:

8.1.3 Dose and Regimen
This study  involves a comparison of soticlestat to matching placebo.
The invest igator or his/her designee is responsible for the fo llowing:
Explaining the correct use of the study  drug to the subject/parent or caregiver.
Verifying that instructions are fo llowed properly.
Maintaining accurate records of study  drug dispensing and collect ion.
Returning or destroying all unused study  drugs to the sponsor or its designee at the end of the 
study  after the m onitor com pletes final accountabilit y and reconciliat ion.
Note :In some cases, si tes may  destroy  the m aterial if, during the invest igator site select ion, the 
evaluator has verified and documented that the site has appropriate facilit ies and wri tten 
procedures to dispose clinical study  materials. Clinical supply  manager review and approval are 
requi red before proceeding.
Subject/parent or caregiver will be instructed to contact the invest igator as soon as possible if he or 
she has a complaint or problem with the study  drug so that the situation can be assessed.
All study  drug pr ovided to the invest igator will be stored in a secure place and allocated and 
dispensed by appropriately trained persons. The allocation and dispensing of the study drug will be 
fully documented and verified by a second person. Detailed records of the amou nts of the study  
drug received, dispensed, and remaining at the end of the study  will be maintained.
All subjects will receive study  drug BID orally wit h or wi thout food or vi a G-tube or MIC -KEY 
button . A J-tube m ay be considered fo llowing wri tten approval by the sponsor and medical

for the G -tube, MIC -KEY button , or J -tube will be provided to the subject/parent or caregiver . 
Other medications or enteral feeds should not be given concu rrently wi th the study  drug.
Soticlestat or pl acebo tabl ets shoul d be administered at approximately the same times each day . 
The actual  date, time, and dose of study  drug administrati ons before PK sample collection will be 
recorded. The actual date and time of all PK sample collect ions will also be recorded.
If a subject misses a dose, the missed dose should be skipped, and the subject should cont inue wit h 
his/her normal dosing schedule. The scheduled dose can be administered or taken up to 4 hours 
afterthe scheduled time of dosing. If the subject/parent or caregiver remembers after 4 hours of the 
scheduled time of dosing, the dosing should be skipped and reported as a missed dose in their 
electroni c daily  seizure and medicat ion diary and on the next cli nic visit.
The planned daily dose and tablet count to be administered to subjects during the t itration period is 
shown in Section 6.1. During the titration period, 2 day s after each dose escalat ion or taper, the 
subject /parent or caregiver will be contacted by  phone (safet y check phone call) to monitor study  
drug compliance, to assess the tolerabilit y and safety o f the study drug, and to monitor concomitant 
medicat ion use and TEAEs.
The subject or the subject’s parent or caregiver should return unused study drug at each study visit  
to allow the investigator or designee to evaluate subject’s compliance with the dosing instructions.
8.1.4 Overdose
An overdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administration of study drug, to or by a 
study  subject, at doses above that which is assigned to that individual subject according to the 
study  protocol .
All cases of overdose (with or without associated TEAEs) will be docum ented on an Overdose 
page of the eCRF to capture this important safet y informat ion consistently in the database. Cases 
of overdose wi thout m anifested si gns or symptom s are not considered TEAEs. TEAEs associated 
with an overdose will be documented on TEAE e CRFs according to Section 10.2.1 . 
SAEs associated with overdose should be reported according to the procedure outlined in 
Secti on10.2.2 .
In the event of drug overdose, the subject should be treated symptomat ically, as determined by the 
investigator.
8.2 Study Drug Assignment and Dispensing Procedures
Sites should refer to the interactive web response system (IWRS) manual for specific instructions. 
The subjects will be assigned to receive their treatment according to the rando mizat ion schedule.

CONFIDENTIALThe investigator or invest igator’s designee will access the IWRS at the Visit 1 (screening/baseline) 
to obtain the subject number. At Visit 2 (randomization), the investigator or the invest igator’s 
designee will use the IWRS to randomize eligible subjects into the study . During this visit, the 
investigator or designee will pro vide the necessary subject identifying informat ion, including the 
subject number assigned at screening. The medicatio n ident ificat ion number of the study  drug to 
be dispensed will then be provided by the IWRS. If study drug supplied is lost or damaged, the site 
can request a replacement from IWRS (refer to the IWRS manual provided separately). At 
subsequent drug -dispensing visits, the invest igator or designee will again access the IWRS to 
request addit ional study drug for a subject. The medicat ion ident ification number of the study drug 
to be di spensed will be provided by  the IWRS.
8.3 Unblinding Procedures
Unblinding should only be considered for the safety o f the subject. The study  drug blind shall not 
be broken by the investigator unless informat ion concerning the study  drug i s necessary for the 
medical treatment of the subject. All study  assessments and causalit y assessment should be 
perform ed, if possible, pri or to unblinding. In the event of a medical emergency, if possible, the 
medical mo nitor or sponsor s hould be contacted before the study drug blind is broken to discuss 
the need for unblinding. If unblinding is deemed necessary by the invest igator, the invest igator can 
unblind the subject’s treatment allocation using IWRS. The invest igator must note the d ate, time, 
and reason for unblinding in subject’s source documents.
If an invest igator, site personnel performing assessments, or subject is unblinded, the subject must 
be discont inued fro m the study . The invest igator should inform the sponsor that the sub ject was 
unblinded; however, they  are not requi red to reveal to the sponsor the subject’s treatment 
allocat ion.
In cases where there are ethical reasons to have the subject remain in the study , the invest igator 
must obtain specific approval fro m the sponsor’s medical mo nitor for the subject to continue in the 
study .
When a TEAE is an unexpected, related SAE, the blind will be broken by the sponsor only for that 
specific subject for reporting purposes and to adhere to regional regulatory requirements for 
unblinding investigators. The blind will be maintained for persons responsible for the ongoing 
conduct of the study  (such as the m oni
tors, i nvest igators, etc.) and those responsible for data 
analysis and interpretation of results at the conclusio n of the stud y, such as bi ometrics personnel . 
Unblinded informat ion will only be accessible to those who need to be involved in the safety 
reporting to health authorit ies, ethi cs co mmittees, and/or IRBs.
Invest igators will receive only blinded informat ion unless unblinded information is judged 
necessary  for regulatory  requi rements or safet y reasons.
8.4 Accountability and Destruction of Study Drugs
Drug supplies, including the number of returned tablets to sites, will be counted and reconciled at 
the site before being retur ned to the sponsor or designee or destroy ed at the si te.

9.0 STUDY PLAN
9.1 Study Procedures
The fo llowing sect ions describe the study procedures and data to be collected. For each procedure, 
subjects are to be assessed by the same invest igator or site personnel whenever possible. The 
schedule of study  procedures is l ocated in Appendix A.
9.1.1 Informed Consent Procedure
Inform ed consent m ust be obtained before the subject enters into the study  and before any 
protocol -directed procedures are performed.
A unique subject ident ificat ion number (subject number) will be assigned to each subject at the 
time that informed consent is obtained; this subject number will be use d throughout the study .
The invest igational site is responsible for the consenting process. The requirements of informed 
consent are described in Sect ion 15.2.

CONFIDENTIAL9.1.2 Histo rical Seizure Diary Review
Per inclusion criteria, historical seizure informat ion will be used to support study  entry . It is very  
commo n for caregivers of subjects with LGS to maintain daily seizure diaries that capture both 
seizure ty pe and frequency and days when no seizures occur as part of their SOC treatment 
regimen. A 3- month (12 -week) daily historical seizure diary  will be reviewed at screening 
(Visit1) to determine eligibilit y. In the event that daily seizure diaries are not routinely maintained 
aspart of the SOC, the investigator will be asked to review in detail wit h the subject/caregiver the 
number of seizures over the last 3 months for each seizure type and attest eligibilit y to the study at 
screening (Visit 1).
9.1.3 Seizure Identification and Diagn ostic Review Forms (TESC)
Per inclusio n criteria, enro llment into the study is based on subject having ≥8MMD seizures each 
month in the 3 mo nths prior to screening based on the historical informat ion and having ≥8MMD 
seizures per 28 day s during the 4- to6-week prospective baseline period (Days -42 to Day -1). To 
confirm diagnosis, standardize seizure ident ification and classificat ion, and approve seizures that 
will be recorded by  the parent/caregiver in the electronic daily seizure and medication diary , 
a 
Seizure Ident ificat ion Form (SIF)/Diagnost ic Review Form (DRF) will be submitted to, reviewed, 
and approved by TESC. In addit ion, previously prepared documents (including, but not limited to, 
EEG and imaging results andsummary  reports) may  be sent to TE SC as part of the SIF/DRF for 
diagnosis evaluat ion, if allowed by local regulat ions. Submissio n of these materials is expected 
shortly  after the screening visit and needs to be approved before randomizat ion.
All new reports of seizures (parent or caregiver descript ions) identified by  the parent or caregiver 
after screening (Vi sit 1) m ust also be reviewed by  the invest igator and approved by TESC to 
confirm seizure classificat ion. A new DRF must be submitted to TESC for review and approval for 
all new seizure s and/or recurrence of past (>1 year) ident ified seizures throughout the course of the 
study . Only seizure cl assificat ion/descript ions approved by TESC will be co llected in the 
electroni c seizure and medication diary  for thi s study .
9.1.4 Seizure Frequency
The p rimary  efficacy  measure i s the percent change fro m baseline in MMD seizure frequency  per 
28 days in subjects on soticlestat as compared with placebo during the treatment period (or during 
the 12-week maintenance period only for EMA registration regions) . Secondary efficacy measures 
include the proportion of responders defined as those with a ≥50% reducti on in MMD seizures 
from baseline.
Seizure frequency will be collected via an electronic daily  seizure and medicat ion diary. The 
electroni c diary  will allow a 7-day window for data entry /correcti on by the subject/parent or 
caregiver. In the event of a device malfunct ion, the subject/parent or caregiver should contact the 
site as soon as possible for the back- up sol ution (access to web back -up) to record daily  seizures 
and medicat ions. The backup paper daily seizure and medicat ion diary will be utilized to ensure 
compliance and reduce the incidence of missed entries only  in cases when the web backup is not 
available. The electronic daily seizure and medicatio n diary is an observer -reported clinical

seizures occurring in a cluster. Countable and uncountable seizures occurring within a cluster will 
be captured. Subject/parent or caregiver will be the observers and reporters in the current study . 
Subject/parent or caregiver will be educated on the importance to record seizures throughout the 
day to ensure that the daily diary  assessment is completed each evening, even if n o seizures 
occurred.
MMD seizures include:
Hemi -clonic or f ocal clonic.
Focal  to bilateral  tonic-clonic.
Generalized tonic -clonic.
Bilateral clo nic.
Focal  seizures wi th major motor si gns (eg hypermotor seizures or involving major body  areas 
such as lower e xtremit ies or trunk) leading to fall or likely fall.
Atonic seizures invo lving major body areas such as lower extremit ies or trunk leading to fall or 
likely  fall.
Tonic seizures invo lving major body areas such as lower extremit ies or trunk leading to fall or 
likely  fall.
Convulsive status.
At the screening visit (Visit 1), the subject/parent or caregiver will be provided with the electronic 
daily  seizure and m edicat ion diary and specific instructions to ensure compliance wit h the seizure 
recording. In addit ion, a corresponding web backup solut ion and paper daily seizure and 
medicat ion diary will be provided in the case of an electronic diary device malfunction. All seizure 
events will be recorded starting at the screening/baseline period up unt il the fo llow-up visit. At 
each visit, the electronic diary will be reviewed, and paper diary co llected, if applicable. All entries 
will be reviewed by the invest igator with the subject/parent or caregiver at the time of each visit to 
ensure proper recording. Any  new se izures that may have occurred since the last visit must be 
reviewed by  the invest igator and approved by TESC via submission o f a DRF. Only  seizure 
classificat ion/descript ions approved by TESC will be co llected in the electronic daily seizure and 
medicat iondiary  for this study .
For the prospective baseline period, the seizure frequency will be calculated as:
(total  number of seizures) / (total number of days seizures were assessed) × 28.
Seizure frequency calculated through this method will be used to confi rm the eligibilit y.
9.1.5 Demographics, Medical History, and Medication History Procedure
Dem ographic information to be obtained will include date of birth or age, sex, Hispanic ethnicit y, 
and race as described by  the subject at screening.

criteria and efficacy/safet y evaluat ion stopped at or wi thin 6 m onths before si gning of informed 
consent. 
All ASMs stopped prior to signing of informed consent should be recorded.
9.1.6 Height and Weight
Weight and height are to be measured while the subject is wearing indoor clothing and with shoes 
off. If una ble to obtain height or weight, data that was obtained ≤30 days before the screening visit  
may be collected from other sources (eg, medical records or the subject’s caregiver). The 
investigator must record in the source document the reason for not obtainin g height or weight (eg, 
the subject i s in a wheelchair). These data may be used to determine the weight -based starting 
dose.
9.1.7 Concomitant Medications and Nonpharmacologic Therapies and Procedures
Concomitant medicat ions will be coded using the World Health Organizat ion (WHO) Drug 
Dictionary. A by-subject list ing of conco mitant m edications will include all medications 
(including vaccinations) taken during the study  regardl ess of the timing for the start of the 
medicat ion. All medications started before the ad ministration of the study drug will be included in 
the data but will be ident ified as “prior” in the list ing. Only the conco mitant medicat ion use will be 
summarized.
The number and percentage of subjects who took at least 1 medicat ion during the double -blind 
period as well as the number and percentage of subjects who took each type of medicat ion will be 
presented for each treatment group. Medications will be listed according to their WHO Drug 
Dictionary Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) class level 4 and preferred drug name within 
ATC class level 4 by decreasing frequency of incidence for all act ive treatment groups combined. 
The list of excluded medicat ions is provided in Appendix B.
9.1.8 Vital Sign Procedure
The fo llowing vital signs will be recorded at the times specified in Appendix A: height (cm ), 
weight (kg), sy stolic and diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg), heart rate (beats/min), respiratory rate 
(breaths/min), and temperature (°C or °F). If clinically significant vital sign changes fro m 
screening/baseline are noted, the changes will be documented as TEAEs in the TEAE eCRF. 
Screening/baseline events will be documented in the Medical History eCRF. Clinical significance 
is defined as any variat ion in vital signs that has medical relevance and may result in an alteration 
in medical care. The investigator will cont inue to m onitor the subject until the parameter returns to 
baseline or until the investigator determines that follow -up is no l onger medically  necessary .

continue to monitor the subject until the parameter returns to baseline or until the invest igator 
determines that fo llow-up is no l onger medically  necessary .
9.1.10 Neurological Examination Procedure
A separate neurological examinat ion will be per formed and results collected in the eCRF. This will 
include testing mental sta tus, gai t, cerebellar funct ion, cranial nerves, motor function (including 
strength and reflexes), and sensat ion.
9.1.11 Safety Evaluations
Invest igators are responsible for monitoring the safety of subjects who have entered this study and 
for alerting the sponsor or its desi gnee to any  event that seem s unusual, even if this event may  be 
considered an unant icipated benefit to the subject.
The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of subjects during the study.
The invest igator remains responsi ble for following, through an appropriate health care option, 
TEAEs that are serious, considered related to the study  treatm ent or the study , or that caused the 
subject to discontinue before complet ing the study. The subject should be fo llowed until the ev ent 
is reso lved or explained. Frequency of fo llow-up evaluat ion is left to the discret ion of the 
investigator.

9.1.11.1 Ophthalmological Evaluation Procedure
An ophthalmo logic evaluat ion will be conducted by a pediatric ophthalmo logist or 
neuro -ophthalmo logist preferably, although an adul t ophthalm ologist or an optom etrist 
experienced wit h examining children may be allo wed fo llowing discussio n with the medical  
monitor. The oph thalmo logic evaluat ion may include:
1.Age and developmentally  appropriate quanti tative visual  acui ty.
a)If the subject is unable to perform quant itative visual acuit y assessment due to age or 
developmental abilit y, a qualitat ive assessment should be attempted.
2.Bilateral red reflex test (also known as Bruckner transilluminat ion test), to assess for lens 
abnorm alities.
3.Postinstillation of mydriatic eye drop (cyclopentylate is contraindicated in this populat ion with 
epilepsy ), slit lamp (portabl e acceptable) examinat ion for anteri or or posteri or lens opaci ties 
concerning for cataracts after adequate pupil dilat ion. For subjects unable to cooperate with slit  
lamp examinat ion due to age or developmental abilit y, use of a 20 -D doubl e aspheric binocular 
indirect ophthalmoscopy  lens or penlight i s acceptable.
4.Indirect and or di rect ophthalmoscopy  of the opti c nerve and retin a after adequate pupillary 
dilation, preferably with a picture of the fundus.
These evaluat ions are to be collected at baseline (between the screening and rando mizat ion visit s) 
and end of the study (before the last visit) for subjects who complete the 16 w eeks of double- blind 
treatm ent or at the early termination visit for those subjects who do not complete (please see 
Appendix A).
9.1.11.2 ECG Procedure
For each subject, 12 -lead digital electrocardi ograms (ECGs) will be collected according to the 
schedule of study  procedures ( Appendix A). Subjects m ust be supine for approximately  5 to 
10minute s before ECG collect ion and rem ain supine but awake during ECG collect ion.
ECGs m ay be obtained at addit ional times, when deemed clinically necessary. Collect ion of more 
ECGs (more replicates) than expected at a particular time point is allowed when needed to ensure 
high-qualit y recordings.
ECGs will init ially be interpreted by  a qualified physician (the invest igator or qualified designee) 
at the site as soon after the time of ECG collect ion as possible, and ideally while the subject is st ill

After enro llment, if a clinically significant increase in the QT/corrected QT (QTc) interval fro m 
baseline or other clinically  significant quant itative or qualitat ive change fro m baseline is 
ident ified, the subject will be assessed by the investigator for symptoms (eg, palpitations, near 
syncope, syncope) and to determine whether t he subject can continue in the study, and the medica l 
monitor or the sponsor should be contacted. The investigator or qualified designee is responsible 
for determining if any change in subject’s management is needed and must document his/her 
review of the ECG printed at the time of evaluat ion fro m at least 1 of the replicate ECGs fro m each 
time point.
Any clinically  significant finding that was not present at screening/baseline will be reported and 
discussed wi th the m edical m onitor or the sponsor. When the re are differences in ECG 
interpretati on between the invest igator (or qualified designee) and the site/local cardio logist, the 
investigator (or qualified designee’s) interpretation will be used for study  entry  and immediate 
subject management. The invest igator (or qualified designee) must document his/her review o f the

9.1.15.6 EQ-5D- 5L Quality of Life Scale
The EQ -5D- 5L is the 5 –response level versio n of the EQ -5D instrument. It consists of 2 sections, a 
descript ive system quest ionnaire and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The questionnaire 
provi des a descriptive profile across the dimensio ns of m obility, self -care, usual act ivities, 
pain/disco mfort, and anxiet y/depressi on. In the EQ -
5D-5L versio n, each dimensio n has 5 response 
levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and unable to/extreme 
probl ems. The parents or caregivers are asked to indicate their own healt h qualit y of life by t icking 
the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the dimensio ns. In addit ion, the EQ VAS 
is used to indicate the general health status, with 100 indicating the best healt h status. These 
questionnaires will be administered according to the schedule of assessments ( Appendix A).
9.1.16 Contraception and Pregnancy Avoidance Procedure
9.1.16.1 Male Subjects and Their Female Partners
Male subjects are not required to use barrier contraception. Donati on of  sperm is not allowed 
during the study  and wi thin 90 days fo llowing the last administration of the study  drug.
9.1.16.2 Female Subjects and Their Male Partners
Plasma pregnancy testing at scree ning and the subject’s last clinic visit will be processed using the 
central  laboratory. Addi tional pregnancy tests (serum or urine) may be performed by a local 
laboratory  throughout the study  at the invest igator’s discret ion.
Please refer to Section 7.1for inclusio n criteria for detailed contraception requirements.

CONFIDENTIALThe follow ing definitions apply for contraception and pregnancy avoidance procedures.
A wo man is considered a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP), ie, fert ile, following 
menarche and unt il beco ming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent 
sterilizat ion methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral 
ooph orectomy . A postm enopausal  state i s defined as no m enses for 12 months wi thout an 
alternat ive medical cause. A high fo llicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the 
postm enopausal range (FSH >40 IU/L) may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in 
younger wom en (eg, those <45 years old) or women who are not using hormonal contraception 
or horm onal replacement therapy . However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a 
single FSH measurement is insufficient.
For sterilized male partners, at least 1 year shoul d have passed since bilateral vasectomy, and they 
must confirm they  have obtained docum entati on of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate or have 
had bilateral orchidectomy. Subjects and parents/legal guardians will be provided with 
inform ation regardi ng acceptable methods of contraception as part of the informed consent 
process and will be asked to sign a consent form stating that there is clear understanding (including 
by the parents/legal guardian) of the requirements for avoidance of pregnancy and d onati on of ova 
during the course of the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug. This consent may be 
signed by the l egally authori zed representative of the subject. 
Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negat ive serum human chori onic 
gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy  test at screening (Visit 1). A pregnancy test at randomizat ion 
(Visit 2) is not requi red for eligibilit y if perform ed and confirmed negat ive at Visit 1 and if the 
investigator does not deem it necessary  to repeat pre gnancy test at Visit 2. 
During the course of the study , subjects will receive continued guidance with respect to the 
avoidance of pregnancy and ova donation as part of the study procedures. A serum or urine hCG 
pregnancy test will also be performed at Vis it 11 (Day  113)/early terminat ion. Addit ional 
pregnancy tests (serum or urine) may be performed throughout the study  at the invest igator’s 
discreti on.
9.1.16.3 General Guidance With Respect to the Avoidance of Pregnancy
Such guidance should include a reminder of th e following:
Contraceptive requirements of the study .
Assessment of subject compliance through such questions as:
–Have you used the contraception consistent ly and correctly since the last visit ?
–Have you forgotten to use contraception since the last visit ?
–Are y our menses l ate? (Even in wo men wit h irregular or infrequent menstrual cycles, a 
pregnancy test must be performed if the answer is “yes.”)
–Is there a chance you could be pregnant?

CONFIDENTIAL9.1.17 Pregnancy
If any subject is found to be pregnant during the study, sh e should be withdrawn immediately, and 
the study  drug shoul d be immediately  discontinued. 
For female subjects, if the pregnancy occurs during administration of act ive study  drug, eg, after 
Visit 2 or wi thin 30 days of the last dose of active study  drug, the pregnancy should be reported 
immediately , using a pregnancy notificat ion form, to the co ntact listed in Section 1.1. For partners 
of male subjects, if the pregnancy  occurs during the study  or wi thin 90 days after the last dose, it 
shou ld be reported following authorizat ion from the subject’s partner.
Shoul d the pregnancy  occur during or after administration of blinded drug, the invest igator must 
inform  the subject of their right to receive treatment information. If the subject chooses t o receive 
unblinded treatment informat ion, the individual blind should be broken by the invest igator. 
Subjects rando mized to placebo need not be fo llowed.
If the female subject and/or female partner of a male subject agrees to the primary care physician 
being informed, the invest igator should notify the primary care physician that the female 
subject/female partner of the subject was participating in a clinical study  at the time she became 
pregnant and provide details o f the study  drug the subject received ( blinded or unblinded, as 
applicable).
All pregnancies, including female partners of male subjects, in subjects on active study  drug will  
be fo llowed up to final outcome, using the pregnancy form. Pregnancies will remain blinded to the 
study  team . The outcom e, including any  premature terminat ion, must be reported to the sponsor. 
An evaluat ion after the birth o f the child will also be conducted.
9.1.18 Documentation of Screen Failure
Invest igators must account for all subjects with a signed informed consent. If the subject is found 
to be ineligible for the study  before randomizati on, the investi gator shoul d record the primary  
reason for screen failure in the eCRF. The IWRS should be contacted as a notification o f screen 
failure.
The primary  reason for screen failure i s to be recorded in the IWRS. Subjects may  be rescreened 
after consul tation wi th the m edical m onitor or sponsor.

9.2 Monitoring Subject Treatment Compliance
The subject/parent or caregiver will record the study drug taken by subject daily, in the morning 
and evening. This m odule in the electroni c daily seizure and medicat ion diary  is only  available to 
the subject/parent or caregiver for entry each day, and retroactive entries are not allowed using the 
handheld device or web portal.
Confirmation o f study  drug intake and dosin g will  be recorded in the electronic daily  seizure and 
medicat ion diary on a daily basis. Any missed doses will be recorded in the electronic daily seizure 
and medicat ion diary by the subject/parent or caregiver and reviewed by  the si te personnel . The 
subject/parent or caregiver will be required to bring used/unused study  drug and the electronic 
daily  seizure and m edicati on diary  device to each site visit. All subject/parent or caregiver should 
be re -instructed about the dosing requirements during study  contacts. The authorized site 
personnel conduct ing the re -education must document the process in the subject’s source records.
Missed or discrepant entries must be reconciled at the site level and must be accurately reflected in 
the eCRF. Sites will be asked to submit data correction request forms to correct any discrepancies 
regarding study  medicat ion that m ay pose a potential safet y concern for the participant. This 
includes potential ty pographical and/or data entry  errors indicat ing study  drug overdose or 
underdose, etc. Sites must ensure the eCRF accurately reflects study drug administration in 
accordance with eCRF co mpletion gui delines.
Subject com pliance wi th study  drug will be assessed at each visit.
Com pliance will  be tracked through the subject electro nic daily seizure and medicat ion diary and 
all entries will  be reviewed by  site personnel , reconciled against returned study  medicat ion with 
queri es, as necessary .
Subjects who are significant ly no ncompliant will be discont inued fro m the study. A subject w ill be 
considered significant ly nonco mpliant if he or she misses more than 20% of study  medicat ion 
during the study  durati on unless there is a valid reason for interruption in the study  medicat ion 
such as hospitalizat ion. These cases should be discussed wi th the study  monitor. Similarly , a 
subject will be considered significant ly nonco mpliant if he or she is judged by the investigator to 
have intent ionally  or repeatedly taken more than the prescribed amount of medicat ion.

The PK parameters of soticlestat will be estimated fro m the sparse concentration -time data for all 
evalua ble subjects using a populat ion PK approach. Actual sampling times will be used in all PK 
computati ons invo lving sampling t imes. Date and time of the last dose of the study drug and 
individual conco mitant ASMs must be captured by the subject/parent or care giver in the electronic 
daily  seizure and m edicati on diary .

multiple-dose phase 1 through phase 2 studi es in heal thy subjects and pat ients will be updated 
using data from this study  and used to estimate PK parameters (ie, exposure) and will also be 
updated using data fro m this study  exposure. The detailed populat ion analysis approach will be

9.3.5.4 PD Measurements
Blood sam ples f or the m easurement of 24HC levels in plasma will be collected according to the 
schedule shown in Appendix A.
Measurements of plasma 24HC levels will be in cluded in thi s study  as a PD bi omarker rel ated to 
the mechanism of act ion of soti clestat. The conversion of cho lesterol  to 24HC i s a mechanism to 
maintain cholesterol ho meostasis in the brain and its release into the cerebrospinal fluid and 
plasma (Bretillo n et al . 2000 ; Cartagena et al. 2008 ; Tian et al . 2010 ). Evidence suggests that 
plasma 24HC l evels are m ostly  derived from  the central  nervous system  (Lutjohann et al . 1996 ). 
Data from single -rising dose and mult iple-rising dose studies showed a decrease in plasma 24HC 
levels after administration of soticlestat in healt hy subjects, which was correl ated with the changes 
in EO percentage measured in the brain using the positron emissio n tom ography  radioligand 
displacement approach (Study TAK -935- 1003). In the current study, baseline and postdose plasma 
24HC l evels will be measured to estimate the aver age 24HC reduction during a dosing interval in 
each subject exposed to soticlestat. As no informatio n is available regarding 24HC levels in 
subjects wi th epilepsy , baseline data will be collected for possible future comparisons wit h 
aged -matched healt hy subjects.
The date, time, and dose of the last dose of the study drug and any ASMs must be captured by the 
subject/parent or caregiver in the electronic daily seizure and medicat ion diary. The exact date and 
time of the 24HC blood sample co llection will be r ecorded in the eCRF.

CONFIDENTIAL10.0 COLLECTION AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS
10.1 Definitions
In thi s study , AE refers to both PTEs and TEAEs. PTEs are AEs that s tarted after the signing of 
inform ed consent but before receiving any study  drug. TEAEs are AEs that started after the first 
dose of study  drug.
10.1.1 AEs
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical invest igation subject who has 
been admini stered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relat ionship wit h this 
treatm ent.
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory  value), symptom, or disease temporally associated wi th the use o f a drug whether or not 
it is considered related to the drug.
10.1.2 Additional Points to Consider for AEs
An untoward finding generally may:
Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre- exist ing condit ion. (Intermittent 
events for pre -exist ing condit ions or underlying disease should not be considered AEs.)
Necessitate therapeutic intervent ion.
Requi re an invasive diagnostic procedure.
Requi re discont inuat ion or a change in dose of study  drug or a concomitant medicat ion.
Be considered un favorable by the invest igator for any reason.
Diagnoses versus signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single  diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs (including 
abnorm al laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded a s 
additional AEs. If  a diagnosis is unknown, signs or symptoms should be recorded 
appropriately as AEs.
Laboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory values or ECG findings are only considered to be AEs if they are judged 
to be clinically signi ficant (i e, if so me act ion or intervent ion is required, or if the invest igator 
judges the change to be beyo nd the range of normal physio logic fluctuati on). A l aboratory  or 
ECG re- test and/or continued monitoring of an abnormal value or finding are not cons idered an 
intervent ion. In addit ion, repeated or addit ional noninvasive testing for verificat ion, evaluatio n 
or monitoring of an abnormalit y is not considered an intervent ion.

Protocol Incorporating Global Amendment 2 22April 2022
CONFIDENTIALIf abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for wh ich there is an 
overall diagnosis (eg, increased serum creat inine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
Pre-exist ing condit ions (present at the time o f signing of informed consent) are con sidered 
concurrent medical condit ions and should NOT be recorded as AEs. Baseline evaluat ions (eg, 
laboratory  tests, ECG, radi ographs) should NOT be recorded as PTEs unless related to study  
procedures. However, if the subject experiences a worsening or com plicat ion of such a 
concurrent medical condit ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded appropriately 
as a PTE (worsening or complicat ion occurs before start of study drug) or a TEAE (worsening 
or com plicat ion occurs after start of study  drug). Investigators should ensure that the event 
term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a pre -exist ing episodic concurrent medical condit ion (eg, asthma, epilepsy), 
any occurrence of an episode should only be c aptured as an AE if the condit ion beco mes more 
frequent, serious or severe in nature. Investigators should ensure that the event term recorded 
captures the change in the condit ion from baseline (eg, “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a degenerat ive concurr ent medical condit ion (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid 
arthri tis), worsening of the condit ion should only be recorded as a AE if occurring to a greater 
extent to that which would be expected. Invest igators should ensure that the event term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
Worsening of AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of a PTE after the start of study  drug, 
the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded as a TEAE. Invest igators should ensure that 
theevent term recorded captures the change in the PTE (eg, “worsening of…”).
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of a TEAE after any  change in study  
drug, the worsening or complicat ion shoul d be recorded as a new AE. Invest igators should 
ensure that the event term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening 
of…”).
Changes in intensit y of AEs:
If the subject experiences changes in intensit y of an AE, the event should be captured once 
with the m aximum  intensity recorded.
Preplanned procedures (surgeries or intervent ions):
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapies) that were scheduled before signing of informed 
consent are not considered AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is performed early (eg, as 
an emergency) due t o a worsening of the pre -exist ing condit ion, the worsening of the condit ion 
shoul d be recorded as an AE. Complications resulting from any planned surgery  shoul d be 
reported as AEs.

CONFIDENTIALElect ive surgeries or procedures:
Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condit ion 
shoul d not be recorded as AEs but should be documented in the subject’s source documents. 
Com plicat ions result ing from an elect ive surgery should be reported as AEs.
Insufficient clinical response (lack of e fficacy):
Insufficient clinical response, efficacy, or pharmacologic act ion should NOT be recorded as an 
AE. The invest igator must make the dist inction between exacerbation of pre -exist ing illness 
and lack of therapeutic efficacy.
Overdose:
Cases of overdo se with any medication wit hout m anifested si de effects are NOT considered 
AEs but instead will be documented on an Overdose page of the (e)CRF. Any manifested side 
effects will be considered AEs and will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF.
10.1.3 SAEs
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
1.Results in DEATH.
2.Is LIFE THREATENING.
The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hyp othetically  might have caused death 
if it were m ore severe.
3.Requi res inpat ient HOSPITALIZATION or prolongation of exist ing hospitalizat ion.
4. Results in persistent or significant DISABILITY/INCAPACITY.
5.Leads to a CONGENITAL ANOMALY/BIRTH DEFECT.
6.Is an IMPORT ANT MEDICAL EVENT that satisfies any of the fo llowing:
May require intervent ion to prevent items 1 through 5 above.
May expose the subject to danger, even though the event is not immediately life 
threatening or fatal or does not result in hospitalization.
10.1.4 AEs of S pecial Interest
An AE of special interest (serious or nonserious) is one of scient ific and medical concern specific 
to the compound or program for which ongo ing monitoring and rapid co mmunicat ion by the 
investigator to Takeda may be appropriate. Su ch events may require further invest igation in order 
to characterize and understand them and would be described in protocols and instructions provided 
for invest igators as to how and when they should be reported to Takeda.

CONFIDENTIALPotenti al drug -drug interacti on between soti clestat and perampanel leading to increased 
seizure frequency:
A potential drug -drug interaction with perampanel and soticlestat resulting in increased seizure 
frequency  was noted in 3 subjects in the TAK -935- 2001 study of adult subjects with DE Es. To 
assess this potential interact ion, the fo llowing clinical safet y monitoring and expanded 
evaluat ion will be performed to closely mo nitor seizure frequency in these subjects. (Please 
see Section 9.3.3 .)
Cataracts:
During nonclinical studies, incipient posterior cortical, subcapsular lent icular cataracts of 
moderate grade were seen in 1 male rat at 300 mg/kg/d and in 1 female rat at 100 mg/kg/d. T o 
assess these potential changes, a detailed ophthalmological monitoring and evaluat ion will be 
perform ed. (Pl ease see Section
 9.1.11.1 and Section 9.3.4 .)
Psychosis:
During the phase 1 mult iple rising dose study  in healthy subjects, epi sodes of confusion, 
euphori a, and psychosis were seen at the highest dose of 600 mg/d. However, in this study  
subjects were not up -titrated to the target dose. Psychiatri c AEs should be monitored closely by 
the invest igator and reported based on AE/SAE criteria described in Sect ion10.1.3 .
AEs of special interest must be recorded as AEs in the eCRF. An evaluat ion form along with all 
other required documentation must be submitted to the sponsor.
10.1.5 Intensity of AEs
The different categories o f intensit y (severit y) are characteri zed as follows:
Mild: The event is transient and easily tolerated by the subject.
Moderate: The event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s usual activities.
Severe: The event causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual activities.
10.1.6 Causality of AEs
The rel ationship of each AE to study  drug(s) will be assessed using the fo llowing categori es:
Related: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from admi nistratio n of a drug (including the 
course after withdrawal of the drug), or for which possible involvement of the drug cannot be 
ruled out , although factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant medications and concu rrent treatments, may also be responsible.
Not Related: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug and/o r 
that can reasonably be explained by other factors, such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomita nt medicatio ns, and concurrent treatments.
10.1.7 Relationship to Study Procedures
Relationship (causalit y) to study  procedures should be determined for all AEs.

Protocol Incorporating Global Amendment 2 22April 2022
CONFIDENTIALThe relationship should be assessed as Related if the investigator considers that there is reasonable 
possibilit y that an event is due to a study procedure. Otherwise, the relationship should be assessed 
as Not Related. 
10.1.8 Start Date
The start date of the AE is the date that the first signs/symptoms were noted by  the subject and/or 
investigator.
10.1.9 Stop Date 
The stop date of the AE is the date at which the subject recovered, the event resolved but with 
sequelae, or the subject died.
10.1.10 Frequency
Episodi c AEs (eg, vomit ing) or those which occur repeatedly over a period of consecut ive days are 
intermittent. All other events are continuous.
10.1.11 Action Concerning Study Drug 
Drug withdrawn –a study  drug i s stopped due to the particular AE.
Dose not changed –the particula r AE di d not require stopping a study  drug.
Unknown –only to be used if it has not been possible to determine what action has been taken.
Not applicable –a study  drug was stopped for a reason other than the particular AE (eg, the 
study  has been terminate d, the subject died, dosing with study drug was already stopped before 
the onset of the AE).
Dose reduced –the dose was reduced due to the particular AE.
Dose increased –the dose was increased due to the particular AE.
Dose interrupted –the dose was int errupted due to the particular AE.
10.1.12 Outcome
Recovered/reso lved – subject returned to first assessment status with respect to the AE.
Recovering/resolving –the intensit y is lowered by  1 or m ore stages: the diagnosis or 
sign/symptom  has alm ost di sappeared; the abnormal  laboratory  value improved but has not 
returned to the normal range or to baseline; the subject died from a cause other than the 
particular AE wi th the condi tion rem aining “recovering/resolving.”
Not recovered/not resolved –there is no change in the diagnosis, signs, or symptoms; the 
intensity of the di agnosis, sign/symptom , or laboratory  value on the l ast day  of the observed 
study  period is worse than when it started; is an irreversible congenital anomaly; the subject 
died from another cause w ith the parti cular AE state remaining “not recovered/not resolved.”

perm anent/si gnificant impairment (eg, recovered from a cardiovascular accident but with 
some persisting pa resis).
Fatal  –the AE i s considered as the cause of death.
Unknown –the course of the AE cannot be fo llowed up due to hospi tal change or residence 
change at the end of the subject’s participation in the study .
10.2 Procedures
10.2.1 Collection and Reporting of AEs
10.2.1.1 AE Collection Period
Collect ion of PTEs will co mmence from the time the subject/parent or legal guardian signs the 
inform ed consent to participate in the study and will cont inue unt il the subject is first administered 
study  drug (Day  1) or until  screen fail ure. For subjects who discont inue before study  drug 
administration, PTEs are collected unt il the subject discont inues study participation.
Collect ion of TEAEs will co mmence from the t ime that the subject is first administered study drug 
(Day  1). Routine co llection of TEAEs will continue until Visit 12 for those who do not roll over to 
the OLE study .For those who do roll over, routine collect ion of TEAEs will cont inue to midnight  
on the day  of Visi t 11.
10.2.1.2 AE Reporting
At each study  visit, the investi gator wil l assess whether any  subjective AEs have occurred. A 
neutral  quest ion, such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit ?” may be asked. 
Subjects m ay report AEs occurri ng at any  other time during the study . Subjects experi encing a 
serious PTE m ust b e monitored until  the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant changes in 
laboratory  values have returned to baseline or there is a sat isfactory  explanati on for the change. 
Nonserious PTEs, related or unrelated to the study  procedure, need not to be fo llowed-up for the 
purposes of the protocol.
All subjects experiencing TEAEs, whether considered associated with the use of the study drug or 
not, m ust be m onitored until  the symptoms subside and any clinically  relevant changes in 
laboratory  values have ret urned to baseline or until a satisfactory  explanati on for the changes is 
observed. All AEs will be documented in the AE page of the eCRF, whether or not the invest igator 
concl udes that the event is related to the drug treatment. The following informat ion will be 
docum ented for each event:

Subject diary  and/or heal th outcom e/quali ty of life measures will not be used as a primary means 
to collect AEs. However, should the invest igator become aware of a potential AE through the 
inform ation collected with this instrument, proper fo llow-up wi th the subject for medical 
evaluat ion shoul d be unde rtaken. Through thi s follow-up, if it is determined that an AE not 
previously reported has been identified, normal reporting requirements should be applied.
10.2.2 Collection and Reporting of SAEs
When an SAE occurs through the AE collection period, it should be reported according to the 
following procedure:
A sponsor SAE form must be completed, in English, and signed by the invest igator 
immediately  or wi thin 24 hours of first onset or notification o f the event.
Regardless of causalit y, SAEs m ust be reported to the sponsor Global Pharmacovigilance 
departm ent or desi gnee, to the attention of the individual identified in the contact information 
list, which will be provided in the study  manual , within 24 hours of bec oming aware of the 
event. Thi s will be done by transmitting an EDC SAE report. If transmissio n of an EDC SAE 
report is not feasible within 24 hours, then a facsimile of the completed paper -based SAE form 
shoul d be sent. If SAEs are reported via fax or by  email, EDC must be updated as soon as 
possible with the appropriate information.
Any SAE spontaneously reported to the invest igator fo llowing the AE collect ion period should be 
reported to the sponsor if considered related to study  parti cipat ion.
Reporting of serious PTEs will follow the procedure described for SAEs.
10.3 Follow -up of SAEs
If informat ion not available at the time of the first report becomes available at a later date, the 
investigator should complete a fo llow-up SAE form  or provi de other wri tten d ocum entati on and 
transmit it immediately  within 24 hours of receipt. Copies of any relevant data fro m the hospi tal 
notes (eg, ECGs, laboratory  tests, di scharge summary , postm ortem  resul ts) shoul d be sent to the 
addressee, if requested.
All SAEs should be f ollowed up unt il reso lution or perm anent outcome of the event. The timelines

provi sion to the sponsor or sponsor’s designee, SUSARs will be submitted to the regulatory  
authori ties as expedited report within 7 days for fatal and life-t hreatening events and 15 days for 
other serious events, unless otherwise required by nat ional regulat ions. The sponsor will also 
prepare an expedited report for other safet y issues where these might materially  alter the current 
benefit -risk assessment of a study  drug/sponsor supplied drug or that would be sufficient to 
consider changes in the study drug/sponsor -supplied drug administration or in the overall conduct 
of the trial. The study site also will forward a copy of all expedited reports to his or her IRB or IEC.

13.0 STATISTICAL METHODS
13.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
A stati stical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized before unblinding of subject’s 
treatm ent assi gnment. Thi s docum ent will provide further details regarding the definit ion of 
analysis variables and analysis methodology  to address all study  object ives.
A blinded data review will be conducted before unblinding of subject’s treatment assignment. This 
review will assess the accuracy  and c ompleteness of the study  database, subject evaluabilit y, and 
appropriateness of the planned statist ical methods.
13.2 Determination of Sample Size
The study will rando mize a total of approximately 234 subjects at a 1:1 ratio to receive 1 dose leve l 
of soticlest at or pl acebo, result ing in approximately 117 subjects per arm.
The primary endpo int for this study is the percent change fro m baseline in MMD seizure frequenc y 
per 28 day s. The definit ion for MMD i s different for this study  than for ELEKTRA, however, the 
variabilit y of this endpoint i s assumed to be the same. This leads to an assumpt ion that the pooled 
SD of the percent change fro m baseline in MMD seizure frequency is 65%.
A difference of 26.5% in mean percent reduction in MMD seizure frequency between tre atments is 
an appropriate target. A sample size of 117 subjects per treatment arm will provide at least 85% 
power at a two -tailed 5% significance level to detect a difference of 26.5% in mean percent 
reducti on in seizure frequency  between treatm ents using the Wilco xon rank -sum test, assuming 
the pool ed SD above of 65%.
13.2.1 Analysis Sets

All rando mized subjects who have received at least 1 dose of study drug and have been assessed 
for seizures for at least 1 day in the treatment period will be included in the mITT analysis set. All 
mITT analyses will be based on eac h subject’s randomized treatment assignment.
13.2.1.3 Safety Analysis Set
All subjects who take at least 1 dose of study drug will be included in the safet y analysis set. Safet y 
analyses will be based on the medication that was administered to each subject.
13.2.2 Analysi s of Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Dem ographic and other baseline characterist ics will be summarized and listed for enrolled 
subjects by  treatm ent group and overall. Descript ive statist ics will be used to summarize data for 
continuous variables such as age and weight (eg, number of subjects, mean, median, SD, and 
range) and for such categorical variables as sex, ethnicit y, and race (number and percentage of 
subjects wi thin each category ). Medi cal history  and medicat ion history  will be listed by subject.
13.2.3 Subject Disposition
All subjects who discont inue from the study  will be i dentified. If known, a reason for their 
discontinuat ion will  be given.
13.2.4 Efficacy Analysis
The primary  efficacy  analysis will be performed on the mITT analysis set. The seizure frequency 
will be calculated based on all data collected during the baseline and treatment periods. For all 
efficacy  analyses on seizure frequency , baseline refers to the prospective 4 -to 6-week baseline 
period. The efficacy endpoints will be summarized for each treatment group, and comparisons will 
be made between the soticlestat and placebo groups. The primary objective of the study  is to 
demonstrate that soti clestat i s superior to placebo. The primary  endpoint (percent change from 
baseline in MMD seizu re frequency per 28 day s) will be analyzed using rank analysis of 
covari ance (ANCOVA) with treatment group as the main effect; age group ( ≤6years, >6 years), 
and baseline seizure frequency will be covariates. Sensit ivity analyses on the primary  endpoint 
will be perform ed using the van Elteren test and the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Gender will also be 
added to the rank ANCOVA model as a sensit ivity analysis.
The proportion of responders will be analyzed using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by 
age g roup ( ≤6 years, >6 y ears).
The m ain analysis for CGI -I (clinician), Care GI -I, CGI -I Seizure Intensit y and Durat ion, CGI -I 
Nonseizure Symptoms, and QI -Disabilit y scores will be based on the responses at each subject’s 
last vi sit where these instrum ents wer e utilized. The QI- Disabilit y scores will be analyzed with a 
mixed model for repeated measures, and the other scores will be analyzed using ordinal logist ic 
regression. Sensit ivity analyses will be performed as specified in the SAP.

14.0 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
14.1 Study -Site Monitoring Visits
Moni toring visit s to the study  site will  be made peri odically  during the study  to ensure th at all 
aspects of the protocol are fo llowed. Source documents will be reviewed for verificat ion of data 
recorded on the eCRFs. Source documents are defined as original documents, data, and records. 
With the except ion of visit s in China, monitoring visit s can be virtual or on site, as indicated in the 
clinical mo nitoring plan. The invest igator guarantees access to source documents by the sponsor or 
its designee (CRO) and by the IRB or IEC.
All aspects of the study and its documentation will be subject to rev iew by t he sponsor or sponsor’s 
designee (as long as blinding is not jeopardized), including but not limited to the Investigator’s 
Binder, study  drug, subject m edical records, informed consent documentation, documentation of 
subject authorizat ion to use pe rsonal healt h information and review of eCRFs and associated 
source documents. It is important that the invest igator and other study personnel are available 
during the monitoring visits and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.
In case of prolong ed access restrict ions to external visit s (study  monitors) to an invest igative site 
due to COVID -19 pandemic and wherever possible by local regulat ions, rem ote Source Data 
Verificat ion (rSDV) may be considered for crit ical data related to subject’s safet y and any key  
variables to ensure data accuracy  and integrit y.
If rSDV i s requi red, f ull details of the process will be included the Clinical Monitoring Plan 
following any applicable local guidance for secure access to remote source documents and data 
securi ty provisi ons to protect personal data.
14.2 Protocol Deviations
The invest igator should not deviate fro m the protocol , except where necessary  to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to study subjects. Should other unexpected circumstances arise that will require 
deviation from protocol -specified procedures, the investigator should consult with the sponsor or 
designee (and IRB or IEC, as required) to determine the appropriate course of action. There will be 
no exempt ions (a prospectively approved deviat ion) from the in clusi on or exclusio n criteria.
The site should document all protocol deviat ions in the subject’s source documents. In the event of 
a significant devi ation, the si te shoul d notify  the sponsor or i ts desi gnee (and IRB or IEC, as

misconduct, increase the health risk to the subject, or confound interpretation of primary study 
assessment. A protocol deviat ion form shoul d be com pleted by  the si te and signed by the spons or 
or desi gnee for any  significant deviat ion from the protocol.
The fo llowing procedure applies to Japanese sites only: 
The invest igator can deviate and change from the protocol for any medically unavo idable reason, 
for example, to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects, without a prior written agreement 
with the sponsor or a prior approval from IRB. In the event of a deviat ion or change, the principal 
investigator should notify  the sponsor and the head of the study  site of the deviat ion or change as 
well as its reason in a written form, and then retain a copy of the written form. When necessary, the 
principal investigator may  consul t and agree wi th the sponsor on a protocol  amendment. If the 
protocol  amendment i s appropri ate, the am endment proposa l shoul d be submi tted to the head of 
the study  site as soon as possible and an approval from IRB should be obtained.
The invest igator should document all protocol deviations.
14.3 Quality Assurance Audits and Regulatory Agency Inspections
The study  site also m ay be subject to qualit y assurance audi ts by  the sponsor or desi gnees. In this 
circumstance, the sponsor -designated audi tor will  contact the si te in advance to arrange an 
auditing visit. The auditor may ask to visit the facilit ies where laboratory  samples a re collected, 
where the medication is stored and prepared, and any other facilit y used during the study . In 
addition, there is the possibilit y that this study may be inspected by regulatory agencies, including 
those of foreign governments (eg, the United S tates [US] F ood and Drug Administration [FDA], 
the United Kingdo m Medicines and Healt hcare products Regulatory Agency, the Pharmaceut icals 
and Medical Devices Agency o f Japan). If the study  site is contacted for an inspect ion by a 
regul atory  body , the spon sor should be notified immediately. The invest igator and study site (or in 
Japan, the head of the study  site) guarantee access for qualit y assurance auditors to all study  
docum ents as described in Sect ion 14.1.
15.0 ETHICAL ASPECTS OF T HE STUDY
This study  will be conducted wi th the highest respect for the individual subjects (ie, subjects) 
according to the protocol, the ethical principles that have their origin in the De clarati on of  
Helsinki, and the ICH Harmonised Tripart ite Guideline for GCP. Each investigator will conduct 
the study  according to applicable local or regional regulatory  requi rements and align his or her 
conduct in accordance with the “Responsibilit ies of the Investigator” that are listed in Appendix D. 
The principles of Helsinki are addressed through the protocol and through appendices containing 
requi rements for inform ed consent and invest igator responsibilities.
15.1 IRB and/or IEC Approval
IRBs and IECs must be constituted according to the applicable state and federal/local requirements 
of each participat ing regio n. The sponsor or designee will require documentation noting all names 
and tit les of members who make up the respective IRB or IEC. If any member of the IRB or IEC

voting must also be obtained. Those Americas sites unw illing to provide names and tit les of all 
members due to privacy  and conflict of interest concerns should instead provide a Federal Wide 
Assurance Number or comparable number assigned by the US Department of Healt h and Human 
Services (for studies including TDC Ameri cas).
The sponsor or designee will supply relevant documents for submissio n to the respective IRB 
orIEC for the protocol’s review and approval. This protocol, the IB, the informed consent form, 
and, if applicable, subject recruit ment materials a nd/or advertisements and other documents 
requi red by all applicable laws and regulat ions, must be submitted to a central or local IRB or IEC 
for approval . The IRB’s or IEC’s written approval of the protocol and subject informed consent 
must be obtained and submi tted to the sponsor or designee before commencement of the study . 
The IRB or IEC approval must refer to the study by exact protocol t itle, number, and versio n date; 
ident ify versio ns of other documents (eg, informed consent form) reviewed; and state the approval 
date. The sponsor will notify the site once the sponsor has confirmed the adequacy o f site 
regul atory  docum entati on and, when applicable, the sponsor has received permissio n from 
competent authori ty to begin the study .
Study  sites m ust adhere to all requirements st ipulated by their respect ive IRB or IEC. This may 
include notificat ion to the IRB or IEC regarding protocol amendments, updates to the informed 
consent form, recruit ment materials intended for viewing by  subjects, l ocal safety reporti ng 
requi rements, reports and updates regarding the ongoing review of the study at intervals specified 
by the respect ive IRB or IEC, and submission o f the invest igator’s final status report to IRB or 
IEC. All IRB and IEC approvals and relevant documentation for these items must be provided to 
the sponsor or its designee.
Subject incentives should not exert undue influence for participat ion. Payments to subjects must 
be approved by the IRB or IEC and sponsor.
15.2 Subject Information, Informed Consent, and Subject Authorization
Written and electronic consent documents will embody  the el ements of informed consent as 
described in the Declarat ion of Helsinki and the ICH Guidelines for GCP and will be in accordance 
with all applicable laws and regulat ions. The informed consent form, subject authorizat ion form (if 
applicable), and subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) describe the planned and permitted uses, 
transfers, and disclo sures of the subject’s personal and personal healt h informat ion for purposes of 
conductin g the study , incl uding the use of electronic devices and associated technologies (if 
applicable). The informed consent form and the subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) further 
explain the nature of the study , its obj ectives, and potenti al risks and b enefi ts, as well  as the date 
inform ed consent i s given. The informed consent form will detail the requirements of the subject 
and the fact that he or she is free to withdraw at any  time wit hout giving a reason and wit hout 
prejudice to hi s or her further m edical  care.
The invest igator is responsible for the preparation, content, and IRB or IEC approval of the 
inform ed consent form  and if applicable, the subject authorization form. The informed consent

CONFIDENTIALform, subject authorizat ion form (if applicable), and sub ject information sheet (if applicable) must 
be approved by both the IRB or IEC and the sponsor prior to use.
The informed consent form, subject authorizat ion form  (if applicable), and subject informat ion 
sheet (if applicable) must be written in a language fully co mprehensible to the prospective subject. 
It is the responsibilit y of the invest igator to explain the detailed elements of the informed consent 
form, subject authorizat ion form (if applicable), and subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) to the 
subject. Information should be given in both oral and written form whenever possible and in the 
manner deemed appropriate by the IRB or IEC. In the event the subject is not capable of rendering 
adequate informed consent, then the subject’s legally acceptable representative may  provide such 
consent for the subject in accordance with applicable laws and regulat ions.
The subject, or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, must be given ample opportunit y to: 
(1) inquire about details of the study and (2) decide whether or not to participate in the study. If the 
subject, or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, determines he or she will part icipate in 
the study , then the informed consent form and subject authorizat ion form (if applicable) m ust b e 
signed and dated by  the subject, or the subject’s legally  acceptable representative, at the time of 
consent and prior to the subject entering into the study . The subject or the subject’s legally 
acceptable representative should be instructed to sign usin g thei r legal  names, not ni cknames, 
using a ballpo int pen wi th either blue or bl ack ballpoint ink in the case of written consent. The 
investigator must also sign and date the informed consent form and subject authorizat ion (if 
applicable) at the time of consent or after the receipt of subject signature (in the case of consent) 
and prior to subject entering into the study; however, the sponsor may  allow a designee of the 
investigator to sign to the extent permitted by  applicable.
Once signed, the original in formed consent form  or certified copy  (if applicable), subject 
authori zation form (if applicable), and subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) will be maintained 
by the study  site. The invest igator must document the date the subject signs the informed co nsent 
in the subject’s medical record. Copies o f the signed informed consent form, the signed subject 
authori zation form (if applicable), and subject info rmation sheet (if applicable) shall be provided 
to the subject.
All revised informed consent forms mus t be reviewed and signed by relevant subjects or the 
relevant subject’s legally  acceptable representative in the same manner as the original informed 
consent. The date the revised consent was ob tained shoul d be recorded in the subject’s medical 
record, and the subject should receive a copy  of the revised informed consent form.
15.3 Subject Confidentiality
The sponsor and designees affirm and upho ld the principle of the subject’s right to protection 
against invasio n of privacy. Throughout this study , a subject’s source data will only be linked to 
the sponsor’s clinical trial database or documentation via a subject ident ification number. As 
permitted by all applicable laws and regulat ions, limited subject attributes, such as sex, age, or date 
of birth, and subject initials, may be used to verify the subject and accuracy o f the subject’s unique 
ident ificat ion number.

CONFIDENTIALaVVs are allowed if aligned with institutional or local guidelines, via phone or via any platforms approved by local regulations, in additio n to the communication 
platform offered through the study. V1 (screening) and V11 (Day 113)/ET must be conducted in person; V9 (Day  57)is to be conducted in person if possible, but 
may be conducted virtually (via video or phone) in response to the COVID -19 pandemic and/or based on sponsor approval and if permitted by local regulations .In 
extenuating circumstances, V2 (Day 0/ randomization) and V11 (Day  113)/ET can be virtual visit s(only  via video, not phone), with sponsor approval and if 
permitted by local regulations .In addition, any visit identified as VV in this table may be conducted in clinic and in person if requested by the subject/pa rent o r 
guardian and/or at the investigator’s discretion.
b The minimum duration for screening is 28 days (ie , V2 [Day 0/randomization] cannot occur earlier than 29 days after V1 [screening]). All efforts shall be made to 
complete all procedures at randomization visit (V2 [Day 0/randomization]). If unable to complete, reason should be captured a nd subject can pro ceed to 
randomization if there are no clinically significant abnormalities in screening procedures and it is thought appropriate, in the investigator’s judgment. For female 
subjects of childbearing potential, pregnancy test at V2 (Day 0/ randomization) is not required for eligibility if performed and confirmed negative at V1 (screening) 
and if the investigator does not deem it necessary to repeat pregnancy test at V2 (Day 0/ randomization) .
cDose 1 is started the morning after V2 (Day 0/ randomization) or the day after study  medication is received. Dose 2 and Dose 3 are started the evening of dose 
titration (V4 [Day 8] and V6 [Day 15], respectively).
dApproximately 2 days after starting Dose 1 and after each dose escalation or taper and before the next visit, subjects will be contacted by phone to monitor study 
drug compliance, to assess the tolerability and safety of the study drug, and to monitor concomitant medication use and treat ment -emergent AEs. These safety 
checks at V3 (Day  3), V5 (Day  10), and V7 (Day 17)are calculated as approximately 2 days after starting Dose 1, Dose 2, and Dose 3, respectively.
eDates of V4 [Day 8] and V6 [Day 15] are calculated from the date of the first dose (Day 1) and the date of titration to Dose 2 (V6 [Day 15]), respective ly.
fDates calculated from V2 (Day 0/ randomization) .
gSubjects who do not continue into the OLE study will undergo the dose taper procedures and will then proceed to the follow -up period.
hSubjects who withdraw early from the study should complete all final visit procedures at V11 (Day 113)/ET.
(For legibility considerations, footnote iis not used.)
jA 12 -lead ECG will be recorded at V1 (Day -42 to -1/screening), V2 (Day 0/ randomization ), V9 (Day 57), and V11 (Day 113)/ET and will be read locally. ECG at 
V1 needs to be recorded before randomization to evaluate subject’s eligibility.
kAt V11 (Day 113)/ET, subjects who do not enroll in the OLE study will be dispensed study drug to taper down . Subjects who enroll in the OLE study should take 
their final dose of double -blind study drug in the evening of the day of V11 (Day  113)/ET .
lThe timing of the follow -up phone call, follow -up period, or follow -up visit will depend on the dose taper proce dures followed. Visit will be eliminated for subjects 
enrolled in OLE.
mFor female subjects of childbearing potential, pregnancy test at V2 (Day 0/ randomization) is not required for eligibility if performed and confirmed negative at V1 
(screening) and if the investigator does not deem it necessary to repeat pregnancy test at V2 (Day 0/ randomization) . A serum or urine hCG pregnancy test will also 
be performed at V11 (Day 113)/ET. Additional pregnancy tests (serum or urine) may be performed throughout the st udy at the investigator’s discretion.
n Ophthalmological examination at V11 (Day 113)/ET may be conducted within a 14 -day window ( -14 days) before V11 (Day 113)/ET.

CONFIDENTIALAppendix CVirtual Visits and Trial Management During COVID -19 Pandemic and Other 
Extenuating Circumstances
The purpose of this section is to safeguard the safety  of study  subjects, ensure continuation of 
study  conduct and uninterrupted maintenance of treatment, and preserve the integrit y of the study, 
in case o f a general public healt h crisis or pandemic, such as COVID -19, or other extenuating 
circumstances, such as war or natural disaster. This sect ion addresses situations in which 
scheduled in -person clinic visit s are not feasible due to local, regional, or national restrictions.
COVID -19 vaccinat ion of subjects is allowed during the study .
The principal invest igator holds the ult imate responsibilit y for the safet y and well -being of study  
subjects and shall maintain compliance with the current local and health authorit y guidelines and 
recommendat ions pertaining to the pandemic. The study  procedures outlined in this protocol may 
be modified subsequent ly according to any emerging or revised healt h authorit y guidelines during 
conduct of the trial due to the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic.
Due to the COVID- 19 pandemic or other extenuat ing circumstances, such as war or natural 
disaster, study  subjects may not be able to attend scheduled in -person clinic visit s as per protocol. 
All invest igational sites shoul d follow local and country  healt h and government authorit ies’ 
restri ctions and recommendat ions on conduct of clinical trials during the event. Sites are 
encouraged to discuss subjects and their cont inued virtual part icipationwith the m edical m onitor.
In the event an in -person visit i s not possible for the planned clinic visit sand in alignment with 
institutional or local guidelines, comfort level of site staff, and caregiver/family willingness to 
travel , virtual visits are al lowed to monitor subject safet y. Addit ional details around such virtual 
visits are provided in Appendix A.
The virtual  visit s identified in Appendix A, if ali gned wi th institutional or local guidelines, to 
ensure a point of contact between subjects/parents/caregivers and site staff, can be conducted via 
phone or vi a any  platforms approved by local regulat ions, besides the co mmu nicat ion platform 
offered through the study . This flexibilit y of co mmunicat ion is not expected to negatively affect 
subject safety  or study data integri ty.
In addit ion, the virtual visits included in the s tudy, if aligned with inst itutional or l ocal guidelines, 
can be converted into clinic visit s at the request of subjects or parents/caregivers or at 
investigators’ discret ion to l essen the burden of the study  and support invest igators, subjects, and 
parents /caregivers, particularly during the COVID- 19 pandemic or other extenuat ing 
circumstances such as war or natural disaster. This conversio n is not expected to negat ively affect  
subjects’ safet y or study  data integrit y.
A decentralized clinical trial plat form may be used to conduct the virtual visit s, if permitted by 
local regulati ons. The si te will  ensure that any  related subject data privacy aspects are 
appropriately  managed and will obtain subjects’ consent for the use of the plat form for virtual 
visits.

CONFIDENTIALIf necessary and in alignment with inst itutional or local guidelines and as all owed by l ocal 
regul ations, a virtual visit can be conducted as a phone visit instead. Likewise, if necessary, the site 
can use the site’s own plat form or phone/tabl et social med ia apps in place of virtual visits. 
In case subjects are not able to attend the planned clinic visits, Direct to Patient (DTP) study  drug 
shipment m ay be considered using a specialized courier vendor, if in alignment with inst itutional 
or local guidelines and as all owed by l ocal regulat ions. A process has been put in place to ensure 
shipment traceabilit y, proper tem perature control  condi tions, study  drug return and accountabilit y 
shoul d be properly  managed to ensure that any  related subj ect data privacy as pects are 
appropriately  covered. The investigator will obtain subject’s consent to DTP study  drug shipment 
and the use of their personal data to that effect.
Any protocol deviat ions, missing visit s, or missing assessments related to COVID -19 restrict ions 
will be recorded and reported in the clinical study  report.
In case of prolonged access restrict ions to external visit s (study  monitors) to an invest igative site 
due to COVID -19 pandemic and wherever possible by local regulat ions, rem ote Source Data 
Verific ation (rSDV) may be considered for crit ical data related to subject’s safet y and any key  
variables to ensure data accuracy  / integri ty.
If rSDV i s requi red, f ull details of the process will be included the Clinical Monitoring Plan 
following any applicable local guidance for secure access to remote source documents and data

1.2 Protocol Summary  
The objective of this post -market  clinical follow -up study is to evaluate safety endpoints in  
patients receiving PhotoFix® Decellularized Bovine Pericardium (PhotoFix) as a patch within a 
vascular repair  or reconstruction procedure.  PhotoFix is prepared from bovine pericardium, 
which is stabilized using a dye -mediated photo -oxidation process and sterilized using aseptic 
processing techniques.  The primary endpoint for patients with carotid artery stenosi s (CAS) 
undergoing carotid endarterectomies (CEA) will be rate of ipsilateral central neurologic events; 
the primary endpoint for all other vascular procedures will be primary patency.  The secondary 
endpoints include all -cause reoperation rate, device -related reoperation rate, explant rate, 
restenosis rate, secondary patency (hemodialysis access repair (HAR) only) and survival.  A goal 
of 100 patients will be enrolled at approximately 10 sites.  The enrollment period will span a 
minimum of 8 months from In stitutional Review Board (IRB) approval and site activation.  
Candidates for this study are adults who require vascular repair or reconstruction surgery that 
necessitates the use of a patch.  Patients will be consented pre -operatively and enrolled patients  
will be followed for approximately 6 months after PhotoFix surgery.  Data will be collected at 5 
time points: baseline (pre -operatively), intra -operatively, 1 month post -operatively, 3 months 
post-operatively, and 6 months post -operatively.  Patients will  be required to return to the office 
for the 3 visits occurring after hospital discharge.  Follow -up data collection will focus on the

1.4 Study Objective  
The objective of this  post-market clinical follow -up study is to evaluate  the clinical outcomes of 
patients receiving PhotoFix  as a patch  within a vascular r epair  or reconstruction  procedure.  
 
1.5 Clinical Background   
Vascular  disease is a p revalent medical issue , which can require affected patients to undergo 
surgery .  The need for surgery is dependent on the indication, but can be required  to reestablish 
blood flow , repair weakened artery walls, or create hemodialysis access.  These surgeri es can  
require the use of a vascular  patch to close or repair  defects; primary suture closure is not always 
an option.   
 
Incidence Rates : 
Vascular surgery is r equired for a variety of  indications.  A large percentage of vascular surgeries 
are performed du e to CAS , peripheral  artery disease (PAD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) 
and HAR  in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD).  These combined conditions  represent 
a large population of individuals.  Not all patients require surgical intervention; how ever, many 
patients, including those who are asymptomatic , will undergo surgery  to prevent p otential long 
term complications .   
 
The prevalence of CAS has been reported to affect  3.4% and 4.2% of females and males, 
respectively.1 The prevalence of CAS vari es by race, with increased risk in Caucasians and 
Native Americans.1 The worldwide prevale nce of PAD has been estimated  at greater than 200 
million people.2 A recent meta -analysis estimated a pooled prevalence for AAA to be 4.8%, with 
obvious global varian ce, with higher prevalence in Australia compared to America and Europe.3   
 
Lastly, the worldwide number of patients who received renal replacement therapy (RRT)  was 
recently estimated as 2.6 million.  A conservative estimate determined that the number who  
received RRT  vastly underestimates the total who need it; an estimated 4.9 million people need 
RRT .4 For t hose requiring hemodialysis , a type of RRT,  arteriovenous fistula  and arteriovenous 
graft are generally preferred over long-term central venous cathe ter.  However,  these  options  
require surgical intervention s to create and  maintain access .  In these cases, patches may be 
required to  repair  and reconstruct defects.  
 
The intention of vascular patching is to improve blood flow, vessel geometry and biomech anics.

bovine pericardium used as a patch in vascular repair  and reconstruction  surgery  
CryoLife, Inc.    Page 3 of 61 Confidentia l Alternative Treatments for Vascular  Surgery Requiring Patch Material:   
Currently available patch materials include vein patches (saphenous or neck veins) and synthetic 
patches (polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), Dacron, or bovine pericardium).  Select ion of the ideal 
patch material is a debated topic; anatomical characteristics, availability, comorbidities, and 
patch indication are considered within th e selection process .  The theoretical benefit of 
autologous patches include an increase in luminal siz e, provision of endothelialized tissue to the 
patch site,  less thrombogenicity, and increased resistance to infection.5 However, issues with 
availability, increased operative time, harvesting -related morbidity, and late aneurysmal 
dilatation have been rep orted with autologous patch use .5  Synthetic  patches have been used as an 
alternative; early criticisms of these patches included prolonged hemostasis time and increased 
thrombosis.5   
 
Clinical Results in Alternative Treatments : 
There are numerous studies  reporting resu lts of vascular patches  for cases of  CAS requiring 
CEA .  These studies have compared  outcomes between patches and direct suture, as well as 
outcomes  between different  patch  materials.  
 
A recent systematic review and meta -analysis compared CEA outcomes over multiple studies.6 
Results from 10 studies comparing primary closure to patch closure were included in one of the 
meta -analyses.  Amongst the 10 studies, patches included saphenous vein patches (n=3), 
synthetic patches (n=3), and combined v ein and synthetic (PTFE or Dacron) (n=4).6   Procedures 
using patches significantly reduced the risk of perioperative stroke and long -term stroke (OR = 
0.49, p = 0.02) .6  The use of patches also reduced the risks of perioperative arterial occlusion (OR 
= 0.18, p < 0.0011) and long -term recurrent stenosis (OR = 0.24, p < 0.01).6  Aggregate r esult s 
from 9 studies were also compared in a meta -analysis; studies reported the comparison of vein 
and PTFE patches.  Perioperative and long term rates of stroke, ipsil ateral stroke, combined 
stroke and death and mortality were not different between groups.6    Aggregate r esults from 4 
studies compared Dacron to other synthetic patches.6    At 30 days, Dacron was associated with 
higher risk of perioperative stroke and tr ansient ischemic attack (TIA) (p=0.03) and restenosis 
(p=0.004).6  There was also significantly more strokes (p=0.03), combined stroke and death 
(p=0.02), and arterial restenosis (p<0.001) with Dacron during longer term follow -up. 
 
Marien et al. compared p eri and post -operative outcomes between CEA patients who received 
bovine pericardium (n=51) and Dacron (n=44).7 Suture  line bleeding at 3 minutes and 4 minutes 
was significantly higher in the Dacron group (55% vs. 14%, p<0.001, 30% vs. 4%, p=0.001 
respecti vely).7 The surgeons also reported that bovine pericardium had superior handling 
characteristics compared to Dacron.7   
 
There is limited published data comparing vascular patch outcomes in surgeries for AAA, PAD 
or HAR .  One small retrospective study comp ared patency outcomes in HAR with stenting  
(n=34)  vs. patch angioplasty  (n=15) .8 Initial post -interventional patency and patency after 
secondary reintervention were  not statistically different between patients who received a patch 
and those who were stente d; however, patch angioplasty trended towards reduced patency after 
second reintervention.8

bovine pericardium used as a patch in vascular repair  and reconstruction  surgery  
CryoLife, Inc.    Page 4 of 61 Confidentia l PhotoFix Decellularized Bovine Pericardium : 
There is still a need for vascular patches with mechanical properties that mimic natural tissue, 
resist deterioration and do not increase the risk for restenosis and other device -related 
complications.  PhotoFix offers another option to vein patches and other synthetic patches, 
specifically, glutaraldehyde t reated xenografts.  PhotoFix tissue is treated through dye -mediat ed 
photo -oxidation ; the processing  stabilizes the internal collagen structure while eliminating toxic 
by-products which allow calcium to bind to the tissue.  Dye-mediated photo -oxidation was first 
described i n the medical literature in the 1990’s.9 The treated tissue was described as “stable 
toward chemical, enzymatic, and in vivo degradation while maintaining physical properties of 
natural tissue”.9 Moore  expanded on the PhotoFix process in 2001 by further describing the 
material as “biostable, biocompatib le, relatively nonclacific, and flexible”.10  
 
Biomechanical  Testing Results:  
PhotoFix mechanical testing  has demonstrated that the patch  is either superior or comparable to 
currently marketed patches  in terms of  tear resistance strength, ultimate tensile strength, suture 
retention, and ball burst strength.   Testing was completed on CryoLife -manufactured product and 
evaluated the device’s average force of failure.  The average maximum load for suture retention, 
ultimate tensile strength, ball burst strength , and tear resistance were 8.39  N, 15.6  N, 309.85  N, 
and 7.3  N, respectively.  
 
Biocompatibility Results : 
Biocompatibility testing was performed under the guidance from ISO 10993 -1.  The specific 
biocompatibility testing performed for PhotoFix is consisten t with the exposure duration of the 
product and its intended use (i.e. permanent exposure of product in contact with blood).  The full 
battery of tests supports the biocompatibility of the device . 
 
Preclinical Results:  
PhotoFix  (formerly CardioFix) was imp lanted in a rat subcutaneous study which concluded that 
the test article had excellent biostability (greater than 71%) and low to minimal calcification.  
PhotoFix was also  examined in a 20 -week sheep study.  PhotoFix was implanted within the 
pericardial sa c, in the  atrial septal , and the ascending and descending aortic positions .  There was 
no evidence of creep or stretching, structural degradation, or collagen degradation.  There was 
also no evidence of thrombogenicity, infection, excessive inflammation or  intrinsic calcification.  
Overall, the testing demonstrated acceptable in vivo  performance in cardiovascular and 
pericardial repair applications.   These  results in a cardiac model can be considered applicable to 
its use in peripheral or non -cardiac vascul ar indications since cardiac conditions represent more 
exaggerated conditions of pressure, contractility and stretching.  
 
The PhotoFix biocompatibility data, photo -fixation data, pre -clinical data, and clinical literature 
of equivalent devices  support the safety of the device.  Post -market clinical follow -up through a 
clinical study will support active surveillance efforts to identify any residual risk.

2.6 Identification of Critical Components  
The PhotoFix primary packaging system consists of the container (Nalgene bottle), which stores 
the tissue in 22% buffered ethanol solution, and the closure (screw on cap us ing a torque limited 
closure device) which prevents leakage of the solution.  A tamper evident shrink band is then 
applied around the bottle and the cap.

3.1 Type of Study  
This study is a  prospective , multi center , post-market  clinical follow -up study to evaluate 
PhotoFix safety  outcomes in vascular repair  and reconstruction  surgery .  This is an observational 
study on a cu rrently marketed device; no study activities are experimental.  
 
3.2 Study Size  & Duration  
Patients will be enrolled at approximately  10 sites .  The enrollment period will s pan the time 
needed to consent approximately 166  patients .  The target sample size is 10 0; projected 
enrollment considers a screen failure rate of 3 3% an d an early termination rate of 1 0%.  
Enrollment is estimated to take a minimum of 8 month s from Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
approval and site activation .  Enrollment will begin at the pr incipal investigator’s site  and in 
agreement with all central and local IRB requirements.  The enrollment period will continue until 
the Sponsor decides to stop enrollment.  The Sponsor will activate additional sites at their 
discretion.  
 
A singular anatom ical region will be selected for patch use.  More than one patch can be used 
within the repair or reconstruction of this target region.  However, patients requiring patches at 
distinct anatomical regions will be excluded.  Additionally, p atients undergoing  concomitant 
procedures requiring additional prosthetics  (e.g. stents)  will be excluded.   For complex cases, 
where clarification on the se criteria is required, the Sponsor should be contacted prior to 
obtaining consent.    
 
Patients undergoing a vascular  procedure which falls within the indications for use and requires 
the use of PhotoFix will be screened and consented for the study,  pre-operatively .   
 
The study will collect prospective data at 5 time points ; data  will be collected pre-operatively , 
intraop eratively /immediately post -operatively,  1 month  post-operatively, 3 months post -
operatively, and 6 months post -operatively .  All study patient s will be expected to participate in 
all study required evaluations .  Patients will be expected to come into the o ffice at the 3 follow -
up visits , post hospital discharge.   For all post-operative visits  outside the hospital , a +/- 14 day 
window  is allow ed for schedule fluctuations, but visits should ideally remain at the intended  
intervals.   Data will also be collecte d on any unscheduled events (i.e. re operation , explants, etc.) 
which may occur during the study period.  
 
Patient  demographics and  medical history , including medications,  comorbidities, pertinent 
surgical history,  and fundamental vascular  diagnosis, will be  collected at time of consent.  
Medications will only include drugs of interest and will not require a complete listing.  Adverse 
events will be collected after surgery on all patients consented and  enrolled into the study .  The 
investigation will be conduc ted for a period  necessary to collect a ll follow -up, as needed on each 
patient , but will not exceed 7 months  after surgery .  The total time a patient will be followed will 
be determined by their date of surgery; dates of surgery should occur within 60 days  of consent.   
If the patient’s surgery is scheduled after 60 days, a re -screen request must be submitted to the 
Sponsor.   The anticipated  final follow -up will be conducted in November 2019 , but will 
ultimately be determined  by IRB approvals, site activatio n, and  by rate of patient enrollment .

4.1 Anticipated Complications  
For this study, a complication is defined as the following:  morbid event or consequences of a 
morbid event.  While all complications will be summariz ed in the fi nal report, the primary focus 
of the analysis will  be complications  involving the vascular system,  such as transient ischemic 
attack  (TIA) , amaurosis fugax, stroke, symptomatic carotid occlusion , thrombosis, bleeding, and 
death .  The terms “adv erse event” and “complication” will be used interchangeably.  
 
An Adverse Event (AE), Unanticipated Adverse Effect (UAE) and Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
are defined in Appendix E.  All AEs, UAEs and SAEs that occur during the course of the study 
(until the completion of the final follow -up visit ), whether observed by the investigator or by the 
patient, and whether or not thought to be PhotoFix related, will be reported in detail on the 
Adverse Event  eCRF and followed to a satisfactory resolution.  The invest igator will follow the 
patient until the event resolves.  In the unusual circumstance that the event has not resolved by 
the time of the patient ’s completion of the study, an explanation will be entered on the Adverse 
Event  eCRF; the circumstance may be de termined to be a permanent condition, and will be 
documented as such.   
 
Secondary morbid events will not be included in the calculation of device -related complication 
rates.  A morbid event should be documented only once unless there are multiple occurren ces of 
that event.  
 
Consequences of morbid events, such as explant, mortality, and reoperation will be captured on 
the Adverse Event eCRF , which details the associated event.   In the case of an explant, 
additional information will be captured on the Expla nt eCRF  (Appendix D) . 
 
Potential complications that may occur with any vascular surgery include, but are not limited to:  
 Allergic reaction to medication  
 Bleeding  
 Breathing difficulty  
 Chest pain  
 Heart attack  
 Infection  (ex. pneumonia, urinary tract infectio n, wound infection)  
 Irregular heartbeat  
 Lung or kidney failure  
 Memory loss  
 Pain 
 Sickness/ nausea   
 Stroke  
 Thrombosis  
 
Complications specific to the use of the PhotoFix may include, but are not limited to the 
following:   
 Abscess  
 Adhesion

 Calcification/mineralization  
 Complete heart block (arrhythmia)  
 Death  
 Inflammatory immune response  
 Infection  
 Intimal hyperplasia  
 Rejection  
 Tissue damage/degradation  
 Tissue failure or rupture  
 Toxic response/reaction  
 TSE trans mission/ variant Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease  
 
The likelihood of any complication is specific to the indication of surgery.  
 
4.2 Consequences of Morbid Events:  
Morbid events can result in m ortality  or the p ermanent cessation of all vital bodily functions.    
Morbi d events can also require r eoperation .  Reoperation  includes a ny operation that repairs, 
alters, or replaces a PhotoFix patch .  Morbid events can also require explant.  Explant includes 
any removal of the patch for any reason.   Details on the con sequences of any morbid event will 
be captured in the Adverse Event eCRF and Explant eCRF, as applicable (Appendix D).  
 
4.3 Reporting Expectations  
Adverse events will be reported per the following guidelines for all enrolled  patients:   
 
1. Any (potential) AE must be re ported to CryoLife as soon as possible, but no later  than 10 
 working days after knowledge of occurrence, by entry into the EDC . 
2. Any UAE, SAEs or AEs of special interest (i.e. vascular complications) must be reported 
to CryoLife within 24 hours after g aining knowledge of the event , by email or telephone , 
in addition to entry into the EDC . 
3. De-identified source documentation (i.e., physicians/nurse notes or summaries) regarding 
an AE, UAE or SAE should be provided in addition to the eCRF.   The source d ocuments 
can be uploaded into the eCRF (as a single file) or sent by e -mail to CryoLife.  
4. Any patient  death will also be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF (requested death 
certificate and autopsy report, if performed, should also be provided).  
5. Additi onally, all events shall be reported to the reviewing IRB per their reporting 
 requirements (definitions and timelines).

CryoLife, Inc.    Page 14 of 61 Confidentia l 5 RISK/BENEFIT ANALYSI S 
 
5.1 Benefits  
A decellularized, photo -oxidized bovine pericardium potentially offers benefits similar to 
autologous pericardium ( i.e., similar  texture, nonimm unogenic, and biocompatible) without the 
disadvantages of glutaraldehyde treated tissue ; the additional (not naturally -occurring) aldehyde 
residue from glutaraldehy de can interact with surrounding tissue , which  leads to membrane 
damage and trapping of  calcium (Ca2+) on residues .11  Design features of PhotoFix may increase 
the durability and functionality  of the device : 
 
 Photo -oxidation:  Processing c reates crosslink s and stabilize s the internal collagen 
structure, while eliminating toxic by -products that cre ate sites where calcium can bind to 
the tissue . 
 
The calcification potential of g lutaraldehyde -fixed bovine pericardium  is well known .12 ,13 
Preclinical  results have shown  that PhotoFix implanted in a cardiac sheep  model  demonstrated  
no evidence of collage n degradation, thrombogenicity, infection, excessive inflammation or 
intrinsic calcification in the 20-week  follow -up period.  PhotoFix may have enormous potential 
for clinical use.  The long -term benefits of the unique features of PhotoFix are currently 
hypothetical.  
 
5.2 Risks  
Risks and complications related to vascular  surgery are extensively docum ented in the medical 
literature.  C omplications specific to the use of PhotoFix may include, but are not limited to, the 
following:  abscess, adhesion, blood leakag e through suture line/holes/ tears,  calcification  
/mineralization, complete heart block (arrhythmia), death, inflammatory immune response, 
infection, intimal hyperplasia, rejection, tissue damage  /degradation, tiss ue failure  /rupture, toxic 
response/reactio n, and TSE transmission/ variant Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease.   The likelihood of 
each event is dependent on the specific  surgical  indication . 
 
5.3 Minimization of Foreseeable Risks  
Each physician must consider all the risks and benefits to the patient on an indi vidual basis , 
when choosing a vascular  patch .  Efforts will be made to minimize these risks by selecting 
Investigators who are experienced i n vascular  surgery.  In addition, efforts will be made to 
ensure that the treatment and follow -up of all patients wi ll be consistent with current medical 
practice.  
 
All procedures will be performed on patient s who are candidates for vascular  surgery , requiring 
the use of a patch .  Patient s will be carefully monitored throughout the follow -up period   and any 
complication s related to the study  will be document ed and evaluated.  
 
 
6 DATA COLLECTION  
 
All data will be entered by site personnel into an electronic data capture (EDC) system,

The completed eCRFs will be  reviewed for completeness and clarity by the  Sponsor’s  data 
manager  and the Sponsor’s representative clinical research associates .  Throughout the study, the 
data manager and clinical research associates will issue queries for any information inadvertently 
omitted, inconsistent, not supported by source documents, or not answered  within the EDC.  The 
data manager  may request further documentation when data issues , complications, device 
malfunctions, or explants  are observed and reported.   The site will be responsible for clarification 
and resolution of all queries.  The data manager will close queries after sufficient clarification 
and resolution is achieved.    
 
6.6 Data Quality Control  
Site investigators will sign off on all study forms prior to data lock.  Additionally, data will be 
100% source document verified by the Sponsor or a representative of the Sponsor, as deemed 
necessary . 
 
6.7 Statistical Analysis Plan  
Enrolle d patient s will be described in aggregate  and by indication (as deemed appropriate); 
baseline characteristics will include, but not limited to, age, sex, r ace, ethnicity, body mass index 
(BMI) , comorbidities, fundamental diagnosis/etiology, and pertinent s urgical history.  Operative 
details will be described in aggregate  and include a summary of the types of procedures 
performed , by relevant category .  Parameters with continuous data types will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics, i.e., mean, standar d deviation, and range.  Categorical clinical 
parameters will be summarized based on percentages.   
 
Ipsilatera l central neurologic event rate , overall survival,  re-operation rate, explant rate, and 
restenosis rate  (≥ 50% stenosis) will be summarized based on percentages of affected patients  
and included in a table, which will summarize the endpoints  in aggregate and  by surgi cal 
indication (ex. CAS, ESRD, PAD , AAA, etc.) .  The summary of ipsilateral central neurologi c 
event rates will include all events  (transient ischemic attack, amaurosis fugax, stroke, and 
symptomatic carotid occlusion ), as well as the incidence of each event individually.  
 
Additional a nalysis of follow -up data will also be performed with the Kapla n-Meier method, as 
deemed appropriate by the incidence of events.  Kaplan -Meier plots may be generated for 
endpoints including overall survival , primary patency, secondary patency, as well as freedom 
from ipsilateral central neurologic event rate, re -opera tion, explant, and restenosis  (≥ 50% 
stenosis) .  Kaplan -Meier plots for survival will include the following mortality classifications:  
all causes of mortality, vascular -related mortality and device -related mortality  (as applicable).  
The remaining plots w ill be specific to indication, if the sample sizes allow for the creation of 
meaningful plots.  
 
The incidence of adverse events will be categorized and summarized with percentages  for the 
aggregate sample.  A dverse  events will be divided into early and lat e post -operative events to 
represent the distri bution of occurrences.  E vents will be considered as early events if the event 
occurs < 30 days  after the operation , while late post -operative events will be considered to be all 
events happening after this tim e period.  Early and late events will be presented by indication for 
surgery , seriousness of event, and relation to PhotoFix.  Adverse  events occurring secondary to

CryoLife, Inc.    Page 18 of 61 Confidentia l another complication will be collected, but not included in the calculation of adverse  even t rates.   
Adverse events occurring prior to PhotoFix implant will not be reported.  
 
An interim analysis of the data will be performed  approximately  6 months after the initiation of 
enrollment.  The sample size  will be dependent on enrollment rate ; follow -up could range  from 0 
days to 5 months.  This analysis will be used to assess the interim performance and safety of 
PhotoFix.  The analysis of this data will also be used to address the planned enrollment of the 
study and to determine if any modifications t o the study are necessary.  
 
6.8 Privacy of Patient Data  & Patient  De-identification  
All patient data will remain confidential.  Patient names, social security number, address es, or 
any other identifying information will not be reported.  Patients and their dat a will be de -
identified with the use of a Screening ID .  Patients will sign a HIPAA waiver acknowledging that 
their information will remain confidential .  The sample HIPAA waiver is attached in Appendix

metabolic demands of the body, assuming the evidence of adequate venous return.   
 
INFECTION  
Bacterial or  fungal proliferation confirmed by organism culture or systemic or localized reaction . 
 
INFORMED CONSENT  
A written document that contains relevant information about the clinical study and that is signed 
and dated by the patient or the patient’s legally acc eptable representative.  
INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW  BOARD (IRB)  
An independent body consisting of medical professionals and nonmedical members responsible 
for reviewing and providing initial and continuing approval of research in human patients and 
verifying that  the safety, integrity, and human rights of patients participating in a particular 
clinical study  are protected.  
 
MORTALITY  
Permanent cessation of all vital bodily functions.  
 
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION  
An area of coagulation necrosis resulting from impaired ox ygenation of the myocardium.  Events 
that are excluded are those patients who possess normal coronary arteries or if the patient is less 
than 40 years of age (will be reported as embolism events).  
 
NEW YORK HEART ASSOCATION CLASSIFICATION (NYHA)  
Classifica tion system used to categorize a patient’s  symptoms  of heart failure.  
 
NSAID  
Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drug.  
 
NYHA CLASS I   
Patients with cardiac disease but without resulting limitations of physical activity.  Ordinary 
physical activity does not caus e undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or angina pain.  
  
NYHA CLASS II   
Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity.  They are 
comfortable at rest.  Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal 
pain.

bovine pericardium used as a patch in vascular repair  and reconstruction  surgery  
CryoLife, Inc.    Page 57 of 61 Confidentia l NYHA CLASS III   
Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity.  They are 
comfortable at rest.  Less than ordinary physical activity causes fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or 
anginal pain.  
 
NYHA CLASS I V  
Patient with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without 
discomfort.  Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency or of the anginal syndrome may be present event 
at rest.  If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.  
 
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGAT OR 
An individual responsible for the conduct of the clinical investigation at a study site.  In the event 
the study is conducted by a team of individuals at a study site, the Principal Investigator is the 
responsible leader  of the team.  
 
REOPERATION  
Any operation that repairs, alters, or replaces PhotoFix and/or the surrounding tissue . 
 
RUTHERFORD CLASSIFICATION  FOR CHRONIC LIMB ISCHEMIA  
Category 0:   Asymptomatic —no hemodynamically significant occlusive disease  
Category 1:  Mild claudication  
Category 2:   Moderate claudication  
Category 3 :  Severe claudication  
Category 4:  Ischemic rest pain  
Category 5:   Minor tissue loss —nonhealing ulcer, focal gangrene with diffuse pedal ischemia  
Category 6:  Majo r tissue loss —extending above  transmetatarsal  level, functional foot no longer 
salvageable  
 
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE)  
A serious adverse event (experience) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any 
dose: results in death, is life -threatening, requires inpatient hospi talization or prolongation of 
existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect.  
 
SPONSOR  
An individual, device company, governmental agency, academic institution, private organiza tion, 
or organization that takes responsibility for and initiates a clinical investigation.  
 
SUDDEN UNEXPECTED, U NEXPLAINED DEATH  
The cause of these deaths is unknown and the relationship to a bypass conduit is also unknown.  
These deaths should be reporte d as a separate category of bypass mortality if the cause cannot be 
determined by clinical data or autopsy.  
 
THIRTY -DAY MORTALITY  
Thirty -day Mortality (sometimes termed Operative Mortality) is death within 30 days of 
operation regardless of the patient's g eographic location.  Hospital Mortality is any death within

CryoLife, Inc.    Page 58 of 61 Confidentia l any time interval after operation if the patient is not discharged from the hospital.  (Hospital -to-
hospital transfer is not considered discharge; transfer to a nursing home or rehabilitation unit  is 
considered hospital discharge unless the patient subsequently dies of complications of the 
operation.)  
 
UNANTICIPATED ADVERS E EFFECTS (UAE s) 
Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused 
by, or associate d with, a product, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in 
nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the study protocol, or any other unanticipated serious 
problems associated with a product that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of a Patient .

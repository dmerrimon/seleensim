INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT:  CIVI  007 
PHASE:  2 
INDICATION:  Treatment of hypercholesterolemia  
OBJECTIVES:  
The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of CIVI 007 following multiple 
subcutaneous (SC) doses in patients on a background of a stable dose of statin therapy.  
The secondar y objective is to assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of CIVI 007 on total plasma 
proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and LDL -C levels in the study population.  
The exploratory objectives include the following:

Version 3.0, 1 4-Nov 2019  7pharmacokinetics) of CIVI  007 in patients  on a backgroun d of statin therapy  with or without ezetimibe . 
Patients  are required to be  on standard of care treatment for high blood cholesterol consistent with 2018 
ACC/AHA guidelines  that includes a  stable dose of statin therapy  (with or without ezetimibe ) for at lea st 
4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit. The study will enroll approximately 48 patients  who will be 
randomized to 1  of 3 active treatment groups or the placebo reference group ( 12 patients  per active 
treatment group and 12 in the placebo treatment group).  
All potentially eligible patients  will partake in the Screening Visit up to 21 days prior to Day 1. The 
Screening Visit will be the first study visit.  
The Treatment Period will be approximately 28 days from Day 1 to Day 29 ; each treatment group will 
receive 2 administrations of study drug. Eligible patients  will be randomized on Day 1 in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 
one of the following treatment groups:  
• Group 1: mg CIVI  007 administered SC on Days 1 and 2 9 
• Group 2: mg CIVI 007  administered SC on Day 1 followed by mg CIVI 007 administered 
SC on Day 29  
• Group 3: mg CIVI 007 administered SC on Days 1 and 29  
• Group 4: Placebo for CIVI  007 administered SC on Days 1 and 2 9 
The Follow -up Period will be approximately 8 weeks  and be gin following the last dose of study drug, 
unless extended follow -up is required based on the Day 85 LDL -C assessment or other Investigator 
determined safety considerations.  
Extended follow -up visits will be conducted on a monthly basis for up to 3 months if Day 85 LDL -C levels 
are <80% of their baseline level; extended follow -up will end within the 3 -month period if LDL -C levels 
are ≥80% of baseline. Extended follow -up visits  (frequency and assessments will be at the discretion of 
the Investigator) to monitor Investigator determined safety considerations may extend beyond 3 months, 
if deemed appropriate by the Investigator, and will continue until there are no safety observati ons requiring 
further follow -up. The total duration of the study for each patient will be approximately 3 to 6.5 months, 
depending on the length of the screening, and follow up periods.  
The study design is graphically summarized below . 
 
Patients  will be routinely monitored for safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamic effects. The s chedule of 
procedures and clinical laboratory analytes are detailed in Appendices : Measurements will be taken  as 
detailed in  Appendix  A (schedule)  and Appendix  B (clinical laboratory analytes) .

Version 3.0, 1 4-Nov 2019  9SAFETY/EFFICACY/PK VARIABLES AND ENDPOINTS:  
Primary Endpoints  
The primary safety/tolerability endpoints for this study are as follows:  
• incidence and severity of any drug -related AE  
• incidence of clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, based on drug -induced changes from 
baseline in  hematology , clinical safety chemistry, and urinalysis test results  
Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints include the following changes from baseline measured approximately 
28 days after the first and 28 and 56 days after the last injection of study drug:  
• percent change  in total plasma PCSK9 and LDL -C  
Exploratory Endpoints  
The exploratory PD endpoints are the absolute and % changes from baseline (except where indicated) in 
the levels of the following in serum or plasma over the time course of the treatment period and fo llow-up: 
• PCSK9 (absolute only)  
• LDL -C (absolute only)  
• VLDL -C 
• triglycerides  
• HDL -C 
• Non-HDL -C 
• total cholesterol  
• lipoprotein  (a) 
• apolipoproteins B and A -I 
• hsCRP  
 
The following PK parameters will be calculated for CIVI 007, where possible:  
• Cmax 
• time of the maximum observed plasma concentration  (tmax) 
• AUC 0-t 
• concentration observed at pre -dose (C trough) 
 
Additional exploratory PK parameters, which may include but are not limited to the following, may be 
calculated:  
• area under the plasma concentration -time cur ve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-∞) 
• area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC 0-24) 
• area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 to 48  hours (AUC 0-48) 
• percentage of AUC 0‑∞ that is due to extrapolation (%AUC extrap) 
• apparent termination elimination rate constant (λ z) 
• apparent plasma terminal elimination half ‑life (t 1/2) 
• apparent total plasma clearance (CL/F)  
• apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase (V z/F) 
SAF ETY VARIABLES:  
The safety variables include adverse events, clinical safety laboratory parameters (including clinical safety 
chemistry, hematology, coagulation parameters including fibrinogen, complement activation, cytokines

the potential future assessment of anti -drug antibodies .   
PHARMACOKINETICS:  
Sparse PK sampling will be conducted for all consenting patients  in each active treatment group. Sampl ing 
will be performed on dosing days, and at each study visit during the Treatment and Follow -up Periods. For 
each of the dosing days, a PK sample will be drawn pre -dose (-1 hour), 3 hours ( ±1 hour) post -dose, and  
at 8 hours (±1  hour) post -dose.  
The population PK model created based on data from the ongoing  Phase 1 study will be refined to evaluate 
the relationship of CIVI 007 PK to demographics and background statin therapy. The model will be 
periodically refined as new and broader datasets emerge t o include the covariates of special populations, 
concomitant medications, and disease state.  
STATISTICAL ANALYSES:  
All adverse events (AEs) will be listed and summarized using descriptive methodology. The incidence of 
AEs for each treatment will be presented by severity and by association with the study drug (CIVI 007 or 
placebo) as determined by the Investigator (or d esignee). Each AE will be coded using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Injection site reactions will be listed (those recorded as AEs will also 
be included in the AE outputs).  
Observed values and clinically important changes from baseline  for clinical laboratory test data, 12 lead 
ECGs, and vital signs will be listed and summarized. CTCAE grading (using the most recent version 
available) summaries will be provided as appropriate. All other safety data will be listed.  
Plasma concentrations  of CIVI 007 will be listed; PK parameters (where possible) of CIVI 007 after each 
dose will be listed and summarized using descriptive statistics. Individual and mean C IVI 007 plasma 
concentration time profiles for each treatment cohort will also be prese nted graphically.  
The PD data will be listed and summarized using descriptive statistics by cohort.  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population will include all patients  who are randomized to the study and will be 
used to assess efficacy. The change from baselin e measures in lipids and lipoproteins will be analyzed 
using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model to compare the mean percent change from baseline in 
PCSK9 and LDL -C 28  days after the first injection and 28 and 56 days after the second injection of stu dy 
drug between treatment groups with placebo. This ANCOVA model will include treatment as a factor and 
baseline LDL -C level as a covariate.  
The Per -Protocol Population will include all patients  who are randomized to the study and do not have any 
major pr otocol deviations. Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be repeated with the Per -Protocol 
Population.  
Further details will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION:  
Approximately 48 patients  (12 patients  per active treatment group, 12 per placebo treatment) will be 
randomized into 1  of 4 treatment groups.  
The sample size chosen for this study was not based on power calculations. However, the number of 
participating patients  in each part of the present study is common in early clinical studies and is 
considered sufficient to achieve the objectives of the study without exposing undue numbers of patients  
to study drug.

Version 3.0, 1 4-Nov 2019  211 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB)1 for additional detailed information concerning the 
available pharmacology, toxicology, drug metabolism, clinical studies, and adverse event profile 
of the investigational medicinal product (IMP).  
1.1 Overview  
CIVI 007   is an antisense oligonucleotide under development 
as an adjunct to diet with or without concurrent hypolipidemic  agents for treatment of adults who 
require additional lowering of low -density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C). 
Consistent evidence from experimental, clinical and genetic studies unequivocally establishes  that 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) causes atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).2 First-line 
drug treatment for hypercholesterolemia is with statins, wh ich inhibit 3 hydroxy -3-methyl -
glutaryl -coenzyme A reductase, a key step in cholesterol synthesis. They decrease plasma levels 
of cholesterol by increasing its hepatic clearance through the upregulation of LDL receptors 
(LDL -R) on hepatocytes. As a result,  statins are effective in preventing ASCVD occurrence, the 
effectiveness of which is dependent on the patient’s baseline ASCVD risk, absolute degree and 
length of cholesterol lowering achieved.3 However, there are important limitations to statin 
therapy, i ncluding muscular intolerance to therapy,4 dose limiting side effects including 
transaminitis5 as well as limitations on their LDL -C lowering capacity and the ability to achieve 
recommended LDL -C target levels.6 An important factor limiting statin’s LDL -C lowering 
capacity is the result of the upregulation of proprotein convertase subtilisin /kexin type 9 (PCSK9) 
that occurs concurrently with the intended upregulation of LDL -R. This statin mediated PCSK9 
upregulation counteracts LDL -R upregulation by enhanci ng LDL -R degradation which  limits the 
hepatic uptake of cholesterol, and therefore paradoxically limits the level of plasma cholesterol 
reduction that can be achieved.7 Thus, there remains an unmet medical need beyond statin therapy 
for novel pharmaceutica l agents to reduce cardiovascular  (CV) morbidity and mortality caused by 
elevated LDL -C, particularly for patients with inadequate response of LDL -C to statin therapy, 
those intolerant to it and those with very high LDL -C levels caused by genetic mutations , such as 
familial hypercholesterolemia . 
The inhibition of PCSK9 is one novel approach being taken to overcome the residual shortcomings 
of statin therapy. As PCSK9 acts to inactivate LDL -R, its inhibition reverses this process and has 
been shown to cause a decrease in plasma LDL levels of up to 60% in humans. Currently, 
2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to PCSK9 have been approved for clinical use, and 2 outcomes 
trials have shown reductions in CV events, thus validating the clinical benefit of inhibiting the  
PCSK9 target.8,9 The PCSK9 mAbs (evolocumab, alirocumab) target only the circulating levels of 
PCSK9  and have the potential for production of antidrug antibodies . Common side effects include 
injection site reactions, common cold, and influenza. Serious allergic reactions have also been 
reported.  
An alternative approach to reducing the impact of PCSK9 on LDL -C is blocking its production at 
the level of messenger rib onucleic acid (mRNA) using an antisense inhibitor complementary and 
specific to human PCSK9 mRNA. Compared to mAb therapy, this mode of action will have the 
advantage of blocking both intra - and extracellular PCSK9 levels, reducing the potential for 
antidr ug antibody formation and impacting novel ASCVD risk biomarkers such as ceramides.10 In 
addition, due to its high potency and long half -life in liver administration of CIVI 007 to human 
subjects , CIVI 007 treatment is expected to lead to stable reductions i n LDL -C when dosed

Version 3.0, 1 4-Nov 2019  22monthly at a single low volume dose ( mg), thus improving patien t convenience 
and compliance  and potentially reducing local pain at the injection site compared to mAbs that can 
require 3 injections of each 1.5ml or an on -body infusor when dosed monthly . 
CIVI 007  is currently under development by CiVi Biopharma , Inc. (CiVi, hereinafter) . CIVI 007  
is an antisense inhibitor complementary to human PCSK9 mRNA and is based on the Locked 
Nucleic Acid (LNA) drug platform, which was pioneered by Santaris Pharma. The LNA 
oligonucleotide is designed to specifically bind to, and degrade, the mRNA encoding PCSK9, 
using the endogenously expressed enzyme, ribonuclease H, to cleave the mRNA. To facilitate 
optimal delivery of the drug to  the intended target organ (liver), the LNA oligonucleotide is 
conjugated to a galactose/N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) moiety that facilitates functional 
uptake by hepatocytes through binding to the surface expressed asialoglycoprotein receptor.  
In summary , treatment with CIVI 007 , through its degradation of PCSK9 mRNA, is designed to 
increase the number of LDL -R on the surface of hepatocytes leading to a reduction in circulating 
LDL -C. Ultimately, this therapeutic approach may be a useful addition to currentl y available drug 
therapy for hypercholesterolemia  either as a monotherapy or as combination therapy with existing 
LDL -C lowering drugs, such as statins.  
1.2 Summary of Preclinical  Pharmacology  
1.2.1 Primary Pharmacodynamics  
In monkeys administered CIVI 007  at 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg once weekly for 4 weeks via the 
subcutaneous ( SC) route, the PCSK9 protein in serum was reduced by  compared to 
the baseline level, respectively. The maximum effect was achieved on Day 29, an d PCSK9 levels 
did not fully return to pre -study values during the 8 -week recovery phase. The effects were 
substantially greater than those seen with (the oligonucleotide moiety of CIVI 007 , 
without  GalNAc conjugate), underpinning the ability of th e GalNAc moiety to drive effective liver 
delivery.  
In the same study, CIVI 007  caused dose responsive LDL -C reductions of 53% and 70% compared 
to baseline, respectively, with maximum effect on Day 29; the half -life for reversal of the LDL -C 
reductions was  days, respectively. As expected, LDL reductions were tracked by 
apolipoprotein (apo) B reductions. On Day 29, apoB levels were down dose dependently by  
, respectively, and apoB levels did not return fully to baseline during the 7 wee ks of 
recovery in either of the 2 dose groups. Weak or no effects on high -density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(HDL -C), total cholesterol, and triglycerides were observed.  
The administration route seemed to have an effect on the intended pharmacology (serum PCS K9, 
plasma apoB, and LDL -C), with the intravenous (IV) route being significantly less effective than 
the SC route. Receptor saturation differences might account for an apparent greater effect with the 
more protracted distribution phase associated with SC a dministration than with the shorter 
distribution phase associated with IV administration.  
1.2.2 Effect on Plasma Ceramide Levels in Monkeys  
To investigate the potential effect of CIVI 007  on ceramides in monkeys, samples were drawn 
from 6 animals receiving 1.5 m g/kg/week for 4 weeks, on pretreatment  Day -8, Day -1, and 
Day 29, one week after the final dose. Compared to both pretreatment  days, 
treatment  with CIVI  007 significantly decreased the levels of ceramides

. In these lipid classes, the total levels and practically all molecular species within the class 
were decreased by approximately  when compared to the pre -dose levels. This is qu ite 
similar to the effect of the PCSK9 loss of function mutation (R46L) in humans, suggesting that 
treatment with CIVI 007  may recapitulate the known CV benefit of this mutation. For some reason, 
the  levels varied considerably between pre -dose samples, obscuring 
any potential effect of the treatment on this class of ceramides.

In the pivotal GLP toxicology studies (2 -week and 13 -week studies in both rats and monkeys), 
doses of CIVI 007 were administered SC at either  weekly  (2-week studies)  or biweekly (13-week 
studies) intervals at 0, 5, 20, or 50  mg/kg/dose (rats) and 0, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg/dose (monkeys).

Based on the combined observations in the 2 and 13 -week studies, the no observed adverse effect 
level (NOAEL) was considered to be 20 mg/kg/dose in the rat, which corresponds to a C max of 
 and an AUC 0-336 of  (mean of both sexes on Day 85), and 30 mg/kg/dose 
in the monkey, which corresponded to CIVI 007 exposures (mean of both sexes on Day 85) of  
 for AUC0.5 -24 and  for Cmax.  
The genotoxic and mutagenic potential of CIVI 007  was evaluated in GLP in vit ro bacterial 
mutagenicity and chromosomal aberrations studies and were found to be negative at maximum 
“limit ” doses specified in regulatory guidelines.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
In conclusion, it is considered that the available safety information supports the administration of 
CIVI 007 to volunteers in this study.

1.7 Clinical Summary  
The first in human ( FIH) study is a placeb o controlled, single blind, randomized, Phase 1, single 
ascending dose ( SAD ) and multiple ascending dose ( MAD ) study to assess the safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetic s (PK) , and pharmacodynamic s (PD) of CIVI 007 SC administered in otherwise

Version 3.0, 1 4-Nov 2019  281.8 Rationale  
The purpose of this study is to further investigate the early clin ical profile of lower doses of 
CIVI  007 in patients with hypercholesterolemia and on a stable dose of background statin therapy.  
The princi pal objective  of this study is to obtain safety and tolerability data when CIVI 007  is 
administered SC given twice over a 28 -day dosing interval. This information, together with the 
PK and PD data, will help establish the doses and dosage regimen suitable for administration to  
larger groups of patients in Phase 2b and 3 clinical development.  
1.9 Risk/Benefit  
Patient s in the current study are not expected  to receive any significant, long -term health benefit 
(beyond that of an assessment of their medical status)  from participating in the study.  
The risks of participation are primarily those associated with adverse reactions to the study 
treatment  as previously described . Based on initial observations in the ongoing Phase 1 trial, CIVI 
007 has a favorable clinica l profile at lower doses and number of injections to justify advancement 
of CIVI 007  to Phase 2 a clinical development . The proposed Phase 2a study will provide robust 
information to determine advancement of the program to Phase 2b/3 testing.  
There may also  be some discomfort from collection of blood samples and other study procedures. 
More information about the known and expected benefits, risks, and reasonably anticipated 
adverse events  associated with CIVI 007  may be found in the IB1.

Version 3.0, 1 4-Nov 2019  303 STUDY DESCRIPTION  
3.1 Summary of Study Design  
This is a Phase 2a, randomized, double -blind (investigator/subject),  sponsor open,  parallel -group, 
multicenter study to evaluate the early clinical profile (safety, tolerability, PD, and PK) of 
CIVI  007 in patients  on a background of statin therapy  with or without ezetimibe . Patients  are 
required to be on standard of care treatment for high blood cholesterol consistent with 2018 
ACC/AHA guidelines14, that includes  a stable dose of statin therapy for at least 4 weeks prior to 
the Screening Visit. The study will enroll approximately 48 patients  who will be randomized to 1 
of 3 active treatment groups or the placebo reference group ( 12 patients  per active treatment group  
and 12 in the placebo treatment group).  
All potentially eligible patients  will partake in the Screening Visit up to 21 days prior to Day 1. 
The Screening Visit will be the first study visit.  
The Treatment Period begins with the first administration of stu dy drug on Day 1 where eligible 
patients  will be randomized in a 1:1:1 :1 ratio to one of the following treatment groups:  
• Group 1: mg CIVI 007 administered SC on Day 1 and Day 29  
• Group 2:  mg CIVI 007 administered SC on Day 1 followed by mg CIVI 007  administered 
SC on Day 29  
• Group 3:  mg CIVI 007 administered SC on Day 1 and Day 29  
• Group 4: Placebo for CIVI 007 administered SC  on Day 1 and Day 29  
Patients will receive an initial dose of CIVI 007 or placebo at the study site on Day 1 . For 
convenienc e, eligible patients will have the option to be admitted to the study site the day prior to 
Day 1. Patients will be discharged from the  study site after completing the 8-hour post -dose follow -
up assessments and will attend scheduled outpatient visits  at Days 8, 15  and 22 to assess safety, 
tolerability, PK, and PD prior to their second dose. These visits and  associated lab results will be 
used to assess eligibility to receive the second study drug administration. All doses will be 
administered in the f asted state in the morning, in accordance with a randomization schedule.  
The second administration of study drug ends the  Treatment Period and is to occur 4 weeks later 
on Day 29. Patients will again be discharged from the  study site  after completing the 8-hour post 
dose follow -up assessments . This will end the Treatment Period.  
The Follow -up Period then begins  and patients will attend scheduled  follow -up visits at Days 36, 
43, 57 and 85  to assess safety, tolerability, PK, and PD. The duration of the Follo w-up Period will 
therefore be approximately 2 months from the last dose of study drug, unless extended follow -up 
is required based on Day 85 LDL -C assessments or other Investigator determined safety 
considerations.  
Extended follow -up visits will be conduc ted on a monthly basis for up to 3 months if Day 85 
LDL -C levels are <80% of their baseline level; extended follow -up will end within the 3 -month 
period if LDL -C levels are ≥80% of baseline. Extended follow -up visits (frequency and 
assessments will be at t he discretion of the Investigator) to monitor Investigator determined safety 
considerations may extend beyond 3 months, if deemed appropriate by the Investigator, and will 
continue until there are no safety observations requiring further follow -up. The tot al duration of

Version 3.0, 1 4-Nov 2019  31the study for each patient will be approximately 3 to 6.5 months, depending on the variable length 
of the screening, and follow up periods.   
A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will perform interim unblinded  reviews of safety, tolerability, 
and available PK and PD data collected for the purposes of protecting subject safety as well as 
providing guidance to the Sponsor  on the evolving clinical profile of CIVI 007 . The SRC will 
comprise, at a minimum, the Sponsor’s clinical development contact, the study Medical Monitor, 
a gastroenterologist not involved in study conduct and a pharmacokineticist.  A separate document 
will detail the SRC’s operating procedures.  
The stud y design is graphically summarized  in Figure 1: 
Figure 1. Summary of the Study Design  
 
Mo = month; Q4W = Every 4 weeks ; Wk = week ; R = randomiz ation;  
 
A visit window of ±3 days will be permitted for each study visit except for the first day of study  
drug administration.  
Appendices A  and B define the detailed  Schedule of Procedures  and Clinical Laboratory Analy te 
measures , respectively,  to be performed  during the study.   
3.2 Study Design Rationale  
Based on initial data from the ongoing FIH study and within the context of a limited experience, 
CIVI 007 appears to provide the expected pharmacologic profile associated with PCSK9 
inhibition. CIVI 007 shows PCSK9 knockdown that begins around 12.5 mg with  maximal 
inhibition of approximately 90% at mg. The efficacy profile includes robust, dose -dependent 
reductions in atherogenic lipoproteins and lipids that appear to peak within a week following 
administration and are stable out to 4 weeks after adminis tration. Changes in lipoproteins and lipids 
after multiple doses are consistent with those after single doses.

Version 3.0, 1 4-Nov 2019  32CIVI 007 therefore appears to have a favorable clinical profile  and  justify 
advance ment  to Phase 2 testing in this study. The Phase 2a study will provide robust information 
to determine advancement of the program  to Phase 2b/3 testing. A forced  up-titration dosing group 
( mg) will provide an initial understanding of this dosing strategy on CIVI 007’s clinical 
profile.  
A parallel group design , as opposed to an ascending dose design,  has been chosen as initial Phase  1 
observations have demonstrated safety in the study dose range. Subcutaneous dos ing has been  
chosen  as this is the intended clinical route of administration.  
Dosing and follow -up will occur in a double -blind  state for the Investigator and clinical staff in 
order to avoid bias in the collection of data.   
Conducting the study in patient s with LDL -C levels in the study range and on a background of a 
stable dose of stat in therapy  (with or without ezetimibe)  will enable  safety, tolera bility , PK, and 
PD data to be collected in the intended clinical population in whom additional drug treatment may 
be warranted to optimize their LDL -C levels.  
Placebo has been chosen as the control treatment to assess whether any observed ef fects are 
treatment -related or simply reflect the study conditions.  
3.3 Study Start and End  of Study Definitions  
The start of the study is defined as the date the first patient  who is subsequently enrolled to the 
study signs an Informed Consent Form (ICF). The  end-of-the study is defined as the date of the 
last patient ’s last assessment (scheduled or unscheduled).  
3.4 Study Termination  
The study may be discontinued at the discretion of the Investigator (or designee), Sponsor, or 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor if any of the following criteria are met:  
• Medical or ethical reasons affecting the continued performance of the study  
• Difficulties in the recruitment of patient s and execution of the study  
• Cancellation of drug development

Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 3.0, 1 4-Nov 2019  36• Termination of the study by the Sponsor or the regulatory authority . 
Patients are encouraged not to change their statin dose or use of ezetimibe during the study. If such 
occurs, they should not be withdrawn from the study.  
If a patient  withdraws prematurely from the study due to the above criteria or any other reason, 
study staff should make every effort to complete the full panel of assessments scheduled for the 
end of follow -up visit  (Day 85).  The reason for patient  withdrawal must be documented in the 
electronic case report form (eCRF) . 
A patient will be considered lost  to follow -up if the patient repeatedly fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be contacted by the clinical study site. In the case of patient s lost to follow -
up, attempts to contact the patient  must be made and documented in the patient ’s medical records.

5.1 Treatment Groups  
All eligible patients will participate  in the Screening Visit up to 21 days prior to Day 1. The 
Screening Visit will be their first study visit.  
The Treatment Period will consist of two  administrations of study drug. Eligible patients will be 
randomized on Day 1 in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the following treatment groups:  
• Group 1: mg CIVI 007 administered SC on Days 1 and 29  
• Group 2: mg CIVI 007 administered SC on Day 1 followed by  mg CIVI 007 
administered SC on Day 29  
• Group 3:  mg CIVI 007 administered SC on Days 1 and 29  
• Group 4: Placebo for CIVI 007 administered SC on Days 1 and 29  
5.2 Rationale for Dosing  
Standard antisense molecules have been demonstrated to scale allometricall y between the mouse, 
monkey , and human based on body weight.15 Accordingly, with a NOAEL in monkeys of 
30 mg/kg, the dose s of and mg/patient  (based on an average body weight of 60 kg) is  
>-fold below the NOAEL.  
More importantly, based on initial dat a from the ongoing FIH study and within the context of a 
limited experience, CIVI 007 appears to provide the expected pharmacologic profile associated 
with PCSK9 inhibition. CIVI 007 shows PCSK9 knockdown that begins around 12.5 mg with 
maximal inhibition of approximately 90% at  mg. The efficacy profile includes robust, dose -
dependent reductions in atherogenic lipoproteins and lipids that begin within 1 week of 
administration and are stable out to  4 weeks after administration. Changes in lipoproteins an d lipids 
after multiple doses are consistent with those after single doses.  
There were no obvious drug -related  safety findings in the dose range of 12.5 to mg. Grade 1 
ALT elevations appeared in both placebo and active doses with similar frequency. At higher doses, 
and based on higher levels of ALT increase, a signal of hepatotoxicity was apparent at 300 mg 
with a potential signal in one subject at 150 mg that was confounded with alcohol intake at the 
time of liver testing.  
CIVI 007 therefore appears t o have a favorable clinical profile at lower doses and these justify 
advance ment  to Phase 2 a testing in this study.  
5.3 Randomization and Blinding  
Approximately 48 patients will be assigned randomly to placebo, mg CIVI 007 , mg CIVI 
007 followed by mg CIVI 007 or mg CIVI 007 in a 1: 1:1:1 allocation ratio .  
Throughout the study, study t reatment will be administered in a double -blinded  fashion  for the 
Investigator, clinical staff,  and patients. Only where required will key site staff (such as 
pharmacist) be unblinded throughout the study.  
The following controls will be employed to maintain the double -blind execution  of the study:  
• The placebo solution will be identical in appearance to the CIVI 007  solution.

Version 3.0, 1 4-Nov 2019  38• The Investiga tor and other members of staff involved with the study will remain blinded . 
• Lipid levels after randomization will be blinded to the study site.  
• Appropriate firewalls will exist to prevent communication between the unblinded SRC and 
personnel involved in study execution.  
5.4 Breaking the Blind  
In order to manage patient  safety (in the event of possibl e treatment -related SAEs or severe adverse 
event s), the decision to unblind resides solely with the Investigator. Whenever possible, and 
providing it does not interfere with or delay any decision in the best interest of the patient , the 
Investigator will discuss the intended code -break with the study Medical Monitor.  If it becomes 
necessary to break the code it will be done using the IRT and the date, time, and reason will be 
recorded in the patient ’s source data . 
5.5 Drug Supplies  
5.5.1 Formulation and Packaging  
CIVI 007  for SC administration will be supplied  by the Sponsor  in vials packaged in a study drug 
kit (2 vials per kit). The placebo study drug (commercial grade sterile saline solution for SC 
administration) will also be supplied by the Sponsor.  
Study drug will be packaged according to current Good Manuf acturing Practice (GMP) and Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.  
Study drug will be labeled according to the requirements of local law and legislation, as well as 
current GMP and GCP guidelines. Proof labels, detailing actual label text, will be avail able in the 
study files.  
An unblinded pharmacist will prepare the appropriate study drug or placebo for blinded 
administration by the Investigator site.  
5.5.2 Study Drug Preparation and Dispensing  
The study drugs will be transferred from  the pharmacy  to the are a where patients will be dosed by 
qualified clinical staff  who will remain blinded to the treatment group . 
5.5.3 Study Drug Administration  
CIVI 007 and placebo are sterile solutions to be administered by SC injection.  
Dosing is to be in the morning following an  overnight fast : 
• CIVI 007 ( or mg) is to be administered SC into the abdomen (or thigh or upper arm, if 
necessary) from a solution at 150 mg/mL ( mg per mL vial).  
• Placebo is to be administered SC into the abdomen (or in thigh or upper arm, if n ecessary). 
The volume of injection will be randomly assigned to match  one of the two active CIVI 007 
doses. 
Note: For the second dose  of CIVI 007 or placebo administration, the investigator s should try 
to avoid using the same injection site area as the fir st dose. For other permitted concomitant

study drug, for at least 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug.  
5.5.4 Treatment Compliance  
The following measures will be e mployed to ensure treatment compliance:  
• All doses will be administered by and under the supervision of suitably qualified study site 
staff.  
5.5.5 Storage and Accountability  
Both CIVI 007 and placebo  will be stored at the study site, according to the instructions on the 
label, in a location that is locked with restricted access.  
The unblinded pharmacist will maintain an accurate record of the receipt of CIVI 007   and placebo 
vials received. In additio n, an accurate drug disposition record will be kept, specifying the amount 
dispensed to each patient  and the date of dispensing. This drug accountability record will be 
available for inspection at any time. At the completion of the study, the original drug  accountability 
record will be available for review by the Sponsor upon request.  
Used and empty dose kits will be discarded upon satisfactory completion of the compliance and 
accountability procedures  by study CRO personnel  monitoring the study . Any unused  or partially 
used kits  will be retained until completion of the study.  
At the completion of the study, all unused CIVI 007  kits and vials will be returned to the Sponsor 
or disposed of by the study site, per the Sponsor’s written instructions.  
5.6 Prior and C oncomitant Medications and/or Procedures  
5.6.1 Excluded Medications and/or Procedures  
Once eligibility is determined, and u ntil study completion, p atient s are to  be counseled  from use 
of any new, or change in dose, of any prescription or nonprescription medicati ons/products . 
Specific attention is to be paid to maintaining the concurrent dose of statin /ezetimibe  therapy 
during the course of the study.  
5.6.2 Restricted Medications and/or Procedures  
Patient s are restricted from using any new prescription or over -the-counter cholesterol lowering 
medication. In addition, until completion of follow -up, change in the concurrent dose or 
discontinuation of statin /ezetimibe  medication during the course of the study i s prohibited unless 
deemed medically necessary  by the Investigator (or designee) or the patient’s medical care 
provider .  
5.6.3 Allowed Medications and/or Procedures  
Except as noted in restricted medications, and if medically warranted and deemed necessary by 
the Investigator (or designee) or the patient’s medical care provider, concurrent medication  is to 
be added or doses changed  as needed given the  patient’s  prior consent to its use.

Version 3.0, 1 4-Nov 2019  405.6.4 Documentation of Prior and Concomitant Medication Use  
Any medication taken by  a patient  during the course of the study and the reason for its use will be 
documented in the source data.  For patients not taking a lower than recommended statin therapy, 
the reason should be documented in the CRF.  
5.7 Dietary and Lifestyle Restrictions  
5.7.1 Diet  
Most study visits require measurement of fasting lipids. Those study visits requiring lipid 
measurement should be following an overnight fast  by the patient  (10 hours ±2 hours ). 
In addition, o n Day 1  and Day 29 , patient s will be fasted overnight (1 0 ±2 hours) prior to study 
drug administration and until 3 hours post-dose, after which a meal will be provided  by study staff  
(lunch times will be staggered as needed between patient s to ensure this 3-hour interval in each 
case). Patients may consume water ad libitum  during the days of study drug administration . 
At all  other  times during the study, patient s are to follow their normal dietary pattern and may 
consume water ad libitum.  
Consumption of alcohol will not be permitted  the day immediat ely prior to and days of study drug 
administration.  Alcohol intake will be limited to a maximum of 2 units/day on all other days, from 
screening through the final Follow -up Visit . 
5.7.2 Smoking  
Smoking will not be permitted on days of study drug administration  until after lunch, and for 
1 hour before each BP and pulse rate measurement outside these periods. Patient s will otherwise 
be permitted to smoke their normal daily number of cigarette s. 
5.7.3 Exercise  
Patient s are required to refrain from strenuous exercise from  the screening visit  until the final 
Follow -up Visit  and will otherwise maintain their normal level of physical activity during this time 
(i.e., will not begin a new exercise program nor participate in any unusually strenuous physical 
exertion).  
5.7.4 Blood Donation  
Patient s are required to refrain from donation until 3 months after the final Follow -up Visit . 
5.7.5 Contraception  
Female patient s who are of non -childbearing potential will not be required to use contraception. 
Women of non-childbearing potential are defined as perman ently sterile (i .e., due to hysterectomy, 
bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as at least 1-year 
post cessation  of menses without an alternative medical cause). Postmenopausal status will be 
confirmed with a scree ning serum FSH level >40 mIU/mL . FSH testing will be conducted in all 
postmenopausal females  who are not surgically sterile  regardless of age . Women aged >60 years 
whose FSH values are not >40 mIU/ mL may be included at the discretion of the Investigator an d 
in consultation with the Sponsor.

Clinical Study Protocol CIVI 007 -2-01 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 3.0, 1 4-Nov 2019  41Female patient s of childbearing potential must be willing to use a highly effective method of birth 
control (i .e., contraceptive measure with a failure rate of <1% per year) in conjunction with male 
barrier contraception  (i.e., male condom with spermicide) from the time of signing the ICF until 
30 days after the last dose of study drug. Highly effective methods of contraception include  the 
following : 
• Intrauterine device (IUD; e.g., Mirena®). Steel or copper IUDs are acceptable.  
• Established use of oral, implanted, transdermal, or injectable hormonal method of 
contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation.  
• Male sterilization (performed at least 90 days prior to the Screening Visit ), with verbal 
confirmation of surgical success (for female patient s on the study, the vasectomi zed male 
partner should be the sole partner for that patient ). 
• Bilateral tubal ligation or occlusion (performed at least 90 days prior to the Screening Visit ). 
Male patient s with partners of childbearing potential must use a male barrier method of 
contraception ( i.e., male condom with spermicide) in addition to a second method of acceptable 
contraception used by their female partners, from Day 1 until 90 days after th e last dose of study 
drug. In addition to the list of highly effective contraception methods above, other acceptable 
methods of contraception for the female partner include  the following : 
• Established use of progesterone -only oral contraception, where inhib ition of ovulation is not 
the primary mode of action.  
• Diaphragm, cap, or sponge in conjunction with spermicide.  
For male patient s, sexual intercourse with female partners who are pregnant or breastfeeding 
should be avoided unless condoms are used from the time of the first dose until 90 days after the 
last dose of study drug. Male patient s are required to refrain from donation of sperm from Day 1  
until 90 days after the last dose of study drug.  
Patient s who practice true abstinence, because of the patient ’s lifestyle choice ( i.e., the patient  
should not become abstinent just for the purpose of study participation) are exempt from 
contraceptive requirements. Periodic abstinence ( e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post 
ovulation  methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. If a patient  who 
is abstinent at the time of signing the ICF becomes sexually active they must agree to use 
contraception as described previously.  
For patient s who are exclusively in sa me sex relationships, contraceptive requirements do not 
apply. If a patient  who is in a same sex relationship at the time of signing the ICF becomes engaged 
in a heterosexual relationship, they must agree to use contraception as previously described.  
The c ontraceptive method(s) being employed by patients should be reviewed with the patient 
during the course of the trial.

7.4 Pharma cokinetics  
Sparse PK sampling will be conducted for all consenting participants . Sampling will be performed 
on dosing da ys, and at each study visit during the Treatment and Follow -up Periods. For each of 
the dosing days, a PK sample will be drawn pre -dose (- 1 hour), 3 hours (±1 h our) post -dose, and  
at 8 hours (±1  hour) post -dose.  
The population PK model created based on da ta from the ongoing Phase 1 study will be refined to 
evaluate the relationship of CIVI 007 PK to demographics and background statin therapy. The 
model will be periodically refined as new and broader datasets emerge to include the covariates of 
special popu lations, concomitant medications, and disease state.

The safety variables include adverse events, safety laboratory parameters (including clinical safety 
chemistry, hematology, coagulation parameters including fibrinogen, complement activation, 
cytokines,  and urinalysis), 12 -lead ECGs, physical examinations, and vital signs. Samples will also 
be collected for the potential future assessment of anti -drug antibodies.  
8.1 Individual Patient Safety Monitoring and Criteria For Discontinuation of Study 
Drug  
When  any the following criteria are met, patients will be monitored for safety and 
discontinuation of study drug considered using  the following guidance.  
• Liver  (as per FDA guidance on drug -induced liver injury16) 
- Patients with signs or symptoms consistent with liver injury (such as nausea, 
vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, right upper abdominal pain or discomfort) should 
undergo immediate testing of ALT, AST, GGT , bilirubin, ALP,  PT, and INR . 
- In the absence of clinical symptoms, p atients with ALT or AST > 3xULN  (if 
normal at baseline) or >2 -fold change (if abnormal at baseline)  should be retested  
within 48 to 72 hours for the usual serum measures (ALT, AST, ALP, a nd 
bilirubin ) to confirm the abnormalities and to determine if they are increasing or 
decreasing.  There also should be inquiry made about symptoms  at the time of 
follow -up.  
- If the above abnormalities are confirmed,  
▪ repeat liver enzyme and serum bilirubi n tests two or three times weekly.  
The frequency of retesting can decrease to once a week or less if 
abnormalities stabilize or the study drug has been discontinued and the 
patient  is asymptomatic.  
▪ Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or c oncurrent  
diseases.  
▪ Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription 
medications and herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, 
recreational drug use, and special diets.  
▪ Rule out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and  E; autoimmune or 
alcoholic hepatitis; NASH; hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary 
tract disease.  
▪ Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.  
▪ Obtain additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (e.g., INR, 
direct bilir ubin).  
▪ Considering gastroenterology or hepatology consultations.   
- Study drug discontinuation should occur if:  
▪ ALT or AST >8xULN  
▪ ALT or AST >5xULN for more than 2 weeks  
▪ ALT or AST >3xULN and (bilirubin >2xULN or INR >1.5)  
▪ ALT or AST >3xULN with the appearan ce of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, 
right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia 
(>5%)  
• Platelet Count  
CiVi Biopharma, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol CIVI 007 -2-01 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 3.0, 1 4-Nov 2019  52- Patients whose platelet count decreases to <140,000 mm3 should begin weekly 
platelet monitoring, and patient whose platelet coun t decreases to <75,000 mm3 
should have platelets monitored every 2 to 3 days. Patients whose platelet count 
decreases to <50,000 mm3 should discontinue drug and undergo daily platelet 
monitoring; consultation with a hematologist is also recommended.  
• Renal  
- Patients with concern for renal toxicity, spot urine UPCR and/or spot UACR 
should be obtained. Patients with UPCR >50% from baseline or 1.5x ULN should 
be monitored at least every 2 weeks.  
- Study drug should be discontinued if patients experience an  unexplained, 
confirmed increase in serum creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL above baseline; unexplained, 
confirmed 25% decline in eGFR from baseline; or new -onset hematuria, 
albuminuria (UACR ≥250 mg/g), or proteinuria (≥UPCR 500 mg/g) confirmed on 
repeat testing.  
8.2 Adverse Events  
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient  
administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An adverse event  can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of an IMP, whether or not related to the IMP. All adverse events, including observed or 
volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF . 
Adverse events, which include clinical laboratory test variables, will be monitored and 
documented from the time of screening until completion of the Day 85 Visit, early termina tion 
visit or extended Follow -up, whichever is later . Patient s should be instructed to report any adverse 
event that they experience to the Investigator , whether or not they think the event is due to study 
treatment . Beginning at screening,  Investigators  should make an assessment for adverse events at 
each visit and record the event on the appropriate adverse event eCRF.  
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by the Investi gator  and recorded on the eCRF. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or 
syndrome by the Investigator , it should be recorded as a separate adverse event on the eCRF.  
Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., surgery, endoscopy, 
tooth extraction, or transfusion) should be recorded as an adverse event, not the procedure  itself .  
Any medical condition already present at Screening , should be recorded as medical history and 
not be reported as an adverse event unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at 
baseline changes in severity , frequency,  or seriousness at any time during the study. In this case, 
it should be reported as an adverse event.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination ( e.g., ECG ) findings that are 
detected during the study or are present at Screenin g, and significantly wo rsen during the study 
should be reported as adverse event s, as described below . The Investigator  will exercise his or her 
medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other 
abnormal assessment is clinically signific ant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values 
occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or 
are no longer clinically significant. Abnormal test results that are determined to be an error sh ould 
CiVi Biopharma, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol CIVI 007 -2-01 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 3.0, 1 4-Nov 2019  53not be reported as an adverse event. Laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal clinical findings 
(e.g., ECG  abnormalities) should be reported as an adverse event if any of the following are 
applicable:  
• If an intervention is required as a result of the abnormality  
• If action take n with the study drug is required as a result of the abnormality  
• Based on the clinical judgment of the Investigator  
8.2.1 Adverse (Drug) Reaction  
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should  be 
considere d an adverse drug reaction . “Responses” to a medicinal product means that a causal 
relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, 
i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out.  
8.2.2 Unexpected Adver se Drug Reaction  
An Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of 
which is not consistent with the applicable product information. For CIVI 007  the reference safety 
information is included in the IB currently  in force. The reference safety information will be 
reviewed yearly and the periodicity of the review will be harmonized with the reporting period of 
the De velopment Safety Update Report.  
8.2.3 Assessment of Adverse Events by the Investigator  
The Investigator  will assess the severity (intensity) of each adverse event as mild, moderate, or 
severe, and will also categorize each adverse event as to its potential relationship to study drug 
using the categories of yes or no. 
Assessment of severity : 
Mild – An event tha t is easily tolerated and generally not interfering with normal daily activities.  
Moderate – An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal daily activities.  
Severe – An event that is incapacitating with inability to work or perform n ormal daily activities.  
Causality assessment : 
The relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the study drug is to be assessed 
according to the following definitions:  
No (unrelated, not related, unlikely to be related ) – The time course between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event rules out a causal relationship 
and another cause (concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, etc.) is suspected.  
Yes ( possibly, probably, or definitely related ) – The time course between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal 
relationship and no other cause (concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, etc.) can be 
identified.  
The definit ion implies a reasonable  possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments  to suggest a causal relationship.  
CiVi Biopharma, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol CIVI 007 -2-01 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 3.0, 1 4-Nov 2019  54The following factors should also be considered:  
• The temporal sequ ence from study drug administration - 
The event should occur after the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
• Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases - 
Each r eport should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease 
being treated and any other disease the patient  may have.  
• Concomitant drug - 
The other drugs the patient  is taking or the treatment the patient  receives should be exam ined 
to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in question.  
• Known response pattern for this class of study drug - 
Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate whether a particular response is likely to be a 
class effect.  
• Expos ure to physical and/or mental stresses - 
The exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the recipient and provide a logical and 
better explanation for the event.  
• The pharmacology and PK of the study drug - 
The known pharmacologic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of 
the study drug should be considered.  
8.2.4 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The Investigator will monitor each patient  for clinical and laboratory evidence for adverse events 
of special interest (AESIs) throughout the patient ’s participation in this study  as defined below .  
The Investigator will assess and record any additional information on the AESI in detail on an 
adverse event form which must be submitted within 24 hours of awareness of the event . 
For this study, AESIs include the following:  
• CTCAE (current version) Grade 2 or higher ALT measurements confirmed on repeat 
measurement  
• Severe or serious injection site reactions (ISRs), ISRs that are associated with a recall 
phenomenon (reaction at the site of a prior injection with subsequent injections), recurrent 
ISRs that are increasing in severity, or ISRs that lead to temporary dose interruption or 
permanent discontinuation of study drug.  
• An ISR is defined as a local reaction at or near the site of inje ction.  “At or near” the 
injection site includes reactions at the injection site, adjacent to the injection site, or a 
reaction which may shift slightly away from the injection site due to gravity (e .g., as may 
occur with swelling or hematoma).  A systemic  reaction which includes the injection site 
(e.g., generalized urticaria, other distinct entities or conditions like lymphadenopathy that 
may be near the injection site) is not considered an ISR

Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 3.0, 1 4-Nov 2019  55Adverse events of special interes t must be recorded in the eCRF.  
8.3 Serious Adverse Event s 
An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator  
or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death . 
• A life -threatening adverse event . 
Note: An adverse event or a dverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in view of either 
the Investigator  or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient  at immediate risk  of death. It does 
not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused de ath. 
• Hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalizations . 
Note: Any hospital admission with at least 1 overnight stay will be considered an inpatient 
hospitalization. An emergency room or urgent care visit without hospital admission will not 
be re corded as a SAE  under this criterion, nor will hospitalization for a procedure scheduled 
or planned before signing of informed consent , or elective treatment of a preexisting condition 
that did not worsen from Baseline . However, unexpected complications an d/or prolongation 
of hospitalization that occur during elective surgery should be recorded as adverse event s and 
assessed for seriousness.  Admission to the hospital for social or situational reasons ( i.e., no 
place to stay, live too far away to come for ho spital visits , respite care ) will not be considered 
inpatient hospitalizations.  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions . 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
• An important me dical event.  
Note: Important medical events that do not meet any of the above criteria  may be considered 
an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient  and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one o f the outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalizations, or the development o f drug dependency.  
8.4 Serious Adverse Event Reporting - Procedures for Investigators  
Initial reports  
All SAEs occurring from  the time of informed consent until completion of the follow -up period  
must be reported to Medpace Clinical Safety within 24 hours of the knowledge of the occurrence . 
After the 30 -day reporting window, any SAE  that the Investigator  considers related to study drug 
must be reported to Medpace Clinical Safety or the Sponsor /designee . 
To report the SAE, complete the SAE form electronically i n the electronic data capture (EDC) 
system for the study. When the form is completed, Medpace Safety personnel will be notified 
electronically  by the EDC system  and will retrieve the form. If the event meets serious criteria and 
it is not possible to acces s the EDC system , send an email to Medpace Safety at medpace -

Clinical Study Protocol CIVI 007 -2-01 
Confidential & Proprietary   
Version 3.0, 1 4-Nov 2019  56safetynotification@medpace.com or call the Medpace SAE reporting line  (phone number listed 
below), and fax /email  the completed paper SAE form to Medpace ( contact information  listed in 
Section 8.7) within 24 hours of awareness. When the EDC system becomes avai lable, the SAE 
information must be entered within 24 hours of the system becoming available . 
Follow -up reports  
The Investigator  must continue to follow the patient  until the SAE has subsided or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment) , or the patient  
dies. 
Within 24 hours of receipt of follow -up information, the Investigator  must update the SAE form 
electronica lly in the EDC system for the study and submit any supporting documentation ( e.g., 
patient  discharge summary or autopsy reports) to Medpace Clinical Safety via fax or email. If it is 
not possible to access the EDC system, refer to the procedures outlined a bove for initial reporting 
of SAEs.  
8.5 Pregnancy Reporting  
If a patient  becomes pregnant during the study or within the safety follow -up period, the 
Investigator is to stop dosing with study drug(s) immediately and the patient  should be withdrawn 
from the stu dy. Early termination procedures should be implemented at that time.  
A pregnancy is not considered to be an adverse event or SAE; however, it must be reported to 
Medpace Clinical Safety within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. Medpace Clinical Safety wi ll 
then provide the Investigator/site the Exposure In Utero (EIU) form for completion. The 
Investigator/site must complete the EIU form and fax/email it back to Medpace Clinical Safety.  
If the female partner of a male patient  becomes pregnant while the patient is receiving study drug 
or within the safety follow -up period, the Investigator should notify Medpace Clinical Safety as 
described above.

8.7 Special Situation Reports  
Special situation reports include reports of overdose, misuse, abuse, medication error, and reports 
of adverse reactions associated with product complaints.  
• Overdose:  Refers to the administration of  a quantity of a medicinal product given per 
administration or cumulatively (accidentally or intentionally), which is above the maximum 
recommended dose according to the protocol. Clinical judgement should always be applied. 
In cases of a discrepancy in th e drug accountability, overdose will be established only when 
it is clear that the patient  has taken additional dose(s) or the Investigator has reason to suspect 
that the patient  has taken additional dose(s).  
• Misuse:  Refers to situations where the medicin al product is intentionally and inappropriately 
used not in a way that is not in accordance with the protocol instructions or local prescribing 
information and may be accompanied by harmful physical and/or psychological effects.  
• Abuse:  Is defined as persi stent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of a medicinal product, 
which is accompanied by harmful physical or psychological effects.  
• Medication error:  Is any unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, or administration 
of a medicinal product by  a healthcare professional, patient, or consumer, respectively. The 
administration or consumption of the unassigned treatment and administration of an expired 
product are always reportable as medication errors ; cases of patient s missing doses of 
investigat ional product are not considered reportable as medication error.  
• Product complaint:  Is defined as any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges 
deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or 
performance of a drug or device after it is released for distribution. A Special Situation s 
Report  form will only be completed if a complaint is associated with an adverse drug 
reaction.  
All special situation events as described above must be reported on the Special Situations Report 
form and faxed/emailed to Medpace Clinical Safety (contact information listed below) within 
24 hours of knowledge of the event. All adverse events associated with these Special Situation s 
Report  forms  should be reported as adv erse events or SAEs as well as recorded on the adverse 
event eCRF and/or the SAE report form. Details of the symptoms and signs, clinical management, 
and outcome should be provided, when available.

9.1 Analysis Populations  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population will include all p atient s who are randomized to the study and 
will be used to assess efficacy.  
The Per -Protocol Population will include all p atient s who are randomized to the study and do not 
have any major protocol deviations.  
The Safety Analysis Population will include all p atient s who receive any amount of study drug.  
9.2 Statistical Methods  
9.2.1 Analysis of Primary Safety /Tolerability  Data 
Analysis of safety will be descriptive.  
The number and percentage of patients who experience 1 or more adverse events will be 
summarized by dose, relationship to study drug, and severity by descriptive statistics. Adverse 
events will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities terminology. Listings of 
patients with SAE or discontinuations due to an adverse event will be presented.  
Laboratory parameters will be summarized by dose using descriptive statistics; data listings of 
clinically significant abnormalities will be presented. Individual results of vital signs will be listed 
and summarized. Observed values and changes from baseline in vital signs will be summarized by 
dose. Individual results of quantitative safety ECG paramet ers from the 12 -lead safety ECGs will 
be listed. Observed values and changes from baseline in quantitative ECG parameters will be 
summarized by dose. Abnormal ECGs will be summarized for each dose level. Physical 
examination findings will be listed.  
Where appropriate, safety findings will be graded using the CTCAE version available at the time 
of analysis . 
9.2.2 Secondary  and Exploratory E fficacy Analysis  
The PCSK9, LDL -C, and exploratory lipid /PD endpoints will be listed and summarized using 
descriptive statisti cs by treatment group over the study period to describe absolute and percent 
changes from baseline .  
The presentation of results will be the observed data and include the estimated means by treatment 
group , their standard errors, and the estimated differences in means between the p atient  treatments  
and corresponding 95% confidence intervals and p -values.  
The treatment comparisons between each active dose versus placebo will be tested following a 
fixed sequence step -down procedure to control the mul tiplicity.  
Analysis of the secondary  efficacy endpoint s will be repeated with the Per Protocol Population.  
Further d etails will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
9.2.2.1  Secondary efficacy analysis  
The secondary endpoints of the study will be a nalyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
models to compare the mean percent change from baseline in LDL -C and PCSK9 28 days after 
the first injection and 28 and 56 days after the second injection of study drug between treatment

Version 3.0, 1 4-Nov 2019  61groups with placebo. Th is ANCOVA model will include treatment as a factor and baseline level 
as a covariate.  
9.2.2.2  Pharmacokinetic analysis  
Plasma concentrations of CIVI 007  will be determined for patient s randomi zed to active drug; 
samples for placebo patient s will not be analy zed un less required ( e.g., to help explain anomalous 
results). Plasma concentrations of CIVI 007  will be listed. Individual and mean CIVI 007  plasma 
concentration -time profiles for each treatment cohort will also be presented graphically.  
Where possible, plasma  PK parameters of CIVI 007  after each dose will be calculated using 
standard non-compartmental methods and will be listed and summari zed using descriptive 
statistics.  
Where sufficient data are available, CIVI 007  fold increase in exposure will be examined between 
the dose cohorts. The PK parameters may be analy zed for dose proportionality using a variance 
model approach or analysis of variance model as appropriate.  
Pharmacokinetic analysis will use actual times as rec orded on the eCRF. Other details and data 
handling procedures will be detailed in the SAP.  
9.2.3 Interi m Analysis  
No formal interim analyses are planned for this study other than descriptive analyses required for 
the SRC to review accumulating safety information . Interim safety reviews  and lipid analyses 
(sponsor only)  will initially occur when approximately  12 patients  have received their first study 
drug injection and have two weeks of follow -up data available . Subsequent analyses will occur 
with the accrual of  each 12 new patients who have two week follow -up data available with a final 
review when the last 12 patients have two week follow -up data available.  
Guidelines for interim study stoppage by the SRC will be based on safety parameters and the 
cumulative ev idence of treatment group imbalances as follows:  
• Clinically relevant signs or symptoms of similar nature occur in 3 or more patients in a 
treatment group that , in the opinion of the Investigator, warrants stopping  based on concerns 
of patient safety .  
• Two or more patients experienc ing a non-cardiova scular  SAE or 4 or more patients experience 
severe AEs .   
• There is evidence of clinically significant increases in the following:  
o liver tests, defined as 3 × ULN (confirmed with repeat testing) in either ALT or  
AST ; or 2 × ULN in either ALP or bilirubin, in 3 or more patients  in a treatment 
group.  
o confirmed platelet count decreases to <140,000 mm3  
o confirmed increase s in serum creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL above baseline  
9.2.4 Sample Size Determination  
Approximately 48 patient s (12 patient s per active treatment group, 12 patients per placebo 
treatment) will be randomized into 1 of 4 treatment groups.

conducting, recording, and reporting studies that involve human patient s. Compliance with this 
standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety, and well-being of study patient s are 
protected, consistent with the principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, and 
that the clinical study data are credible.  
11.2 Institutional Review Board  
The Institutional Review Board (IRB) will review all appropr iate study documentation in order to 
safeguard the rights, safety, and well -being of patient s. The study will only be conducted at sites 
where IRB approval has been obtained. The protocol, IB, ICF, advertisements (if applicable), 
written information given to the patient s, safety updates, annual progress reports, and any revisions 
to these documents will be provided to the IRB  by the Investigator.  
Federal regulations and ICH Guidelines require that approval be obtained from an IRB  prior to 
participation of patient s in research studies. Prior to study onset, the protocol, any protocol 
amendments, ICFs, advertisements to be used for patient  recruitment, and any other written 
information regarding this study to be provided to a patient  or patient ’s legal guardian must be 
approved by the IRB . 
No drug will be released to the site for dosing until written IRB  authorization has been received 
by the Sponsor.  
11.3 Informed Consent  
The ICF and any changes to the ICF made during the course of the st udy must be agreed to by the 
Sponsor  or designee and the IRB prior to its use and must be in compliance with all ICH GCP,

a  All eligible patients  will partake in the Screening Visit up to 21 days prior to Day 1 . 
b,c Study assessments will be completed within 3 days of the given time point for all study visits other than Day 1. Extended f ollow -up beyond day 8 5 for below baseline LDL -C 
will assess the fasting lipid panel and occur monthly for up to 3 months or  until L DL-C returns to within 80% of its baseline level . Those visits will also record AEs and concomitant 
medication.  
d  The Investigator will query the participant on Day 1 to determine if there have been any changes in the participant’s health that  would affec t eligibility or require an update to 
his/her medical/surgical history.  
e  Vital signs include pulse rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, and temperature. Blood pressure should be obtained in a sea ted position after the participant has  been sitting  or at 
least 5 minutes. Blood pressure at the Screening Visit should be obtained in both arms, and the arm with the highest value sh ould be used for ongoing monitoring throughout the 
rest of the study. If an automated assessment is performed, the same mach ine should be used for the participant throughout the study whenever possible. Care should be taken to 
ensure an appropriate cuff size is utilized.  
f  Height will be measured only at the participant’s Screening Visit.  
g  A urine microscopic examination wil l be performed when the dipstick result is abnormal ( i.e., positive for blood, leukocyte esterase, or nitrites).  
h  Pregnancy tests are for women of childbearing potential only. A serum pregnancy test will be performed at screening. Urine pregnancy test  will be conducted at all other visits . 
Unscheduled serum pregnancy testing will be performed for confirmation of positive urine pregnancy testing. FSH tests are for  all postmenopausal women who are not surgically 
sterile; FSH testing will be performed once a t screening.   
i  Drugs of abuse along with t hyroid -stimulating hormone, HbA1c, and serology ( HBsAg, HBV, HCV, and HIV) will be measured at the participant’s Screening Visit.  Serology 
testing will be HBsAg, HCV, and HIV, with confirmatory testing for positive HCV and HIV Ab screens.  
j  The fasting lipid panel includes LDL -C, non –HDL -C, TC, TGs, HDL -C, and VLDL -C. Fasting will be defined as no food or caloric beverage for at least 10 hours  (±2 hours ) prior 
to sample collection. Patients  will be permitted to have water.  LDL -C will be estimated.  
k  Fasting apolipoproteins include apoB, apoA1, and Lp(a). Beta quant  LDL is beta -quantification measurement of LDL -C. Fasting will be defined as no food or ca loric beverage 
for at least 10 hours  (±2 hours) prior to sample collection. Patients  will be permitted to have water.  
l  PK, cytokine panel,  and complement activation sampling will be performed on dosing days and at each study visit during the Follow -up Period. For each of the dosing days , 
samples  will be drawn at pre -dose (-1 hour), 3 hours ( ±1 hour) post-dose, and  at 8 hours  (±1 hour) post -dose. 
m Patients  should be at rest for at least 5 minutes lying quietly in a fully supine position prior to each triplicate 12-lead ECG.  The triplicate measurements should be taken approximately 
one minute apart.  ECGs on Days 1 and 29 should be performed  twice: the first should be pre-dose ( -1 hour) and the second at 2.5 h ours post -dose (±0.5 h ours) which is  about 30 
min prior to the 3-hour PK draw . 
n Statin PK blood sample will be taken for measurement of their steady state levels/major components when validated assays are available for such measurements .

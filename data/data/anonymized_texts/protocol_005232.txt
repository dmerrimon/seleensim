 SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title:  A Multi-Center, Double-Masked Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety 
of CSF-1 in the Treatment of Presbyopia  
Protocol Number:  18-150-0006 
Investigational 
Products:  • CSF-1: pilocarpine hydrochloride (0.2% [low dose])/(0.4% 
[high dose]) and diclofenac sodium (0.006%) 
• Pilocarpine hydrochloride (0.2% [low dose])/(0.4% [high 
dose])  
• Diclofenac sodium (0.006%)  
Study Phase:  2b 
Primary Objective:  • To evaluate the efficacy of  CSF-1 for the treatment of presbyopia  
Secondary 
Objectives:  • To evaluate the safety , tolerability , and efficacy of CSF-1 versus 
the individual components for the treatment of presbyopia  
• To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy (onset and 
duration) of 2 concentrations of CSF-1 ([0.2%/0.006%] and 
[0.4%/0.006%]) for the treatment of presbyopia  
Overall Study Design:  
Structure:  Multi-center, randomized, double- masked, parallel -group, safety, and 
efficacy study  
Duration:  Approximately 2 to 4 weeks (4 study visits)  
Controls: Individual components of the combination therapy (pilocarpine 
hydrochloride alone and diclofenac sodium alone) 
Treatment plan:  Visit 1: Qualified subjects will receive 1 drop of Refresh Classic® 
(placebo) instilled to each eye.  
Visit 2: Following the pre-treatment assessments, qualified subjects 
will be randomized 1:1:1 to 1 of the following treatment arms: CSF -1 
(pilocarpine hydrochloride [0.2%] /diclofenac sodium [0.006%] ), 
pilocarpine (0.2%) alone, or diclofenac sodium (0.006%) alone . All 
subjects will dose twice daily  
 in both eyes with a single 
drop for approximately 1 week. 
Visit 3: Following the visit 3 assessments, subjects will continue BID 
dosing  
in both eyes for approximately 1 week. Subjects 
initially randomized to the CSF -1 arm will now receive pilocarpine 
hydrochloride (0.4%)/diclofenac sodium (0.006%); subjects randomized to the pilocarpine hydrochloride (0.2%) alone arm will 
now receive pilocarpine hydrochloride (0.4%) alone; and subjects 
randomized to the diclofenac sodium alone arm will continue dosing 
with diclofenac  sodium (0.006%) alone.

during data collection and  the evaluation of clinical endpoints.  
Study Population Characteristics:  
Number of 
Subjects:  Approximately 150 subjects (3 arms; 50 subjects per treatment arm) 
will be enrolled . 
Condition/Disease:  Healthy adult subjects ages 45 to 64 years who have presbyopia  
Inclusion Criteria:  Subjects must:  
1. 
 
 
 
 
 
4. Have best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 40 cm ≥ 0.40 and 
≤ 0.90 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution  
(LogMAR , approximately between 20/50 and 20/160 Snellen) 
in at least 1 eye at visit 1 prior to placebo dosing and in the 
same eye at vis it 2 (pre-treatment );

 Have a condition or a situation that  in the investigator’s opinion 
may put the subject at increased risk, confound study data, or 
interfere significantly with the subject’s study participation, including but not limited to unstable cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, hematologic, neurologic, or psychiatric disease. 
Study Treatments  • CSF-1: Pilocarpine hydrochloride (0.2% [low dose])/(0.4% 
[high dose]) and diclofenac (0.006%) 
• Pilocarpine hydrochloride (0.2% [low dose])/(0.4% [high dose]) 
• Diclofenac sodium (0.006%) 
All patients will dose BID  
in both eyes with a single drop of 
IP. 
Evaluation Criteria:  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  Percentage of subjects with a ≥ 3-line (15 letter) gain in BCVA at 40 
cm, 1-hour post- treatment at visit 3 and visit 4  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
 •  
 
• Percentage of subjects with a ≥ 2-line (10 letter)  gain in BC VA 
at 40 cm at each time point at visit 3 and visit 4  
•  
Safety Endpoints

General Statistical Methods and Types of Analyses 
Analysis Sets:  
• Intent-to-Treat Analysis Set – The Intent-to-Treat analysis set ( ITT) will include all 
randomized subjects. Subjects in the ITT will be analyzed as randomized.  
• Per Protocol Set – The per -protocol (PP) set will include subjects in the ITT who do not 
have significant protocol deviations that affect the primary endpoint. Protocol deviations

 will be assessed prior to database lock and unmasking. Subjects in the PP set will be 
analyzed as treated.  
•  
 
 
 
 
• Safety Set – The safety set will include all subjects who have received at least one dose of 
the IP. Subjects in the safety population will be analyzed as treated. 
Unit of Analysis: 
The study eye will be used for all monocular analyses. The fellow eye will inherently be 
included in all binocular analyses. Both eyes will be displayed and analyzed for all ophthalmic safety variables.  
The study eye will be defined as the eye that meets all enrollment criteria.  If both eyes meet all 
enrollment criteria, then the eye with the worse Visit 2 (Day 1) BCVA at 40 cm will be th e 
study eye.  If both eyes have the same BCVA at 40 cm , the right eye will be the study eye.  
General Considerations:  
In general, quantitative/continuous data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and max imum). Qualit ative/categorical data will be summarized 
using frequencies and percentages. Statistical testing, unless otherwise indicated, will be performed at a 2 -sided 0.05 significance level.

 Safety analyses will be conducted in the safety population.  
Hypothesis: 
H01: The difference, between study eyes treated with CSF -1 (0.4%/0.006%) and study eyes 
treated with diclofenac sodium (0.006%) , in the percentage of study eyes  with a ≥ 3-line (15 
letter) gain in BCVA at 40 cm, 1-hour post- treatment = 0.  
H11: The difference, between study eyes treated with CSF -1 (0.4%/0.006%) and study eyes 
treated with diclofenac sodium (0.006%) , in the percentage of study eyes  with a ≥ 3-line (15 
letter) gain in BCVA at 40 cm, 1-hour post- treatment ≠ 0.  
H02: The difference, between study eyes  treated with Pilocarpine (0. 4%) and study eyes 
treated with diclofenac sodium 0.006% , in the percentage of study eyes  with a ≥ 3-line (15 
letter) gain in BCVA at 40cm, 1-hour post- treatment = 0.  
H12: The difference, between study eyes treated with Pilocarpine (0. 4%) and study eyes 
treated with diclofenac sodium 0.006% , in the percentage of study eyes  with a ≥ 3-line (15 
letter) gain in BCVA at 40cm, 1-hour post- treatment ≠ 0.  
The study will be considered a success if either of the null hypotheses, H 01 or H02, are rejected 
in favor of their corresponding alternative hypotheses, H 11 or H12. The overall Type I error of 
the 2-sided alpha = 0.10 will be preserved through the use of Bonferroni correction procedures 
testing each hypothesis at a 2 -sided alpha = 0.05. 
If H01 is rejected and CSF -1 (0.4%/0.006%) is considered a success, then CSF-1 
(0.2%/0.006%) will be tested against diclofenac sodium (0.006%) at a 2-sided alpha = 0.05. 
Similarly, if H02 is rejected and Pilocarpine (0.4%) is considered a success, then Pilocarpine 
(0.2%) will be tested against diclofenac sodium (0.006%) at a 2-sided alpha = 0.05. Within 
these hierarchical framework s, these hypothese s can be tested at a 2 -sided alpha = 0.05 while 
still preserving an overall Type I error of alpha = 0.10.

 H14: The difference, between study eyes treated with Pilocarpine  (0.2%) and study eyes 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sample Size:  
Fifty subjects per each of the 3 treatment arms (150 total), yields an 85% power to establish 
superiority of CSF -1 (0.4%/0.006%) and Pilocarpine (0. 4%) to diclofenac sodium 0.006% 
alone in the percentage of study eyes demonstrating a ≥ 3-line (15- letter) gain in BCVA at 40 
cm, 1-hour post- treatment from the baseline measurement using a Pearson chi -squared test at a 
2-sided alpha = 0.05 assuming that the diclofenac sodium 0.006% alone response is 5% and 
the CSF-1 response is 27%, resulting in an overall 2-sided alpha = 0.10 that accounts for the 2 
tests of hypotheses utilizing Bonferroni correction procedure s. 
 
 
Primary Efficacy Analysis: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Descriptive statistics will be presented for each time point by treatment group. Testing of the percentage of subjects with a ≥ 3-line (15- letter) improvement from baseline will be completed 
accounting for the correlations between treatments and periods within a subject using a logistic (binomial error and logit link) model estimated by generalized estimating equation (GEE) 
methods. Aspects of the model include: 
• Response measure: indicator of whether the subject had a ≥ 3-line (15- letter) 
improvement from baseline in the assessment of BCVA at 40 cm in the study eye 
• Covariate: baseline BCVA at 40 cm in the study eye 
• Fixed effect explanatory measures: treatment

 • Random effect measure: subject, to account for the correlation between treatments 
within a subject 
• Repeated measures correlation : estimated with an unstructured covariance matrix in the 
GEE model 
Standard errors  and confidence intervals ( CIs, 90% and 95%) will also be presented for each 
treatment group and the difference between treatment groups.

Safety Analysis:  
Verbatim descriptions of AEs will be mapped to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  
(MedDRA ) terms and be presented in a data listing. Treatment emergent AEs, those that occur 
after the first dose of IP, will be summarized by treatment group using frequency and percent 
for each system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) within each SOC. Similar 
summaries will also be presented for treatment- emergent AEs ( TEAEs) related to IP and by 
severity. When reporting the incidence of AEs, a subject will only be counted once if they ever 
experience an event within the SOC and ever experience the individual PT within the specific treatment period. AEs  will be reported separately by period.

 1 INTRODUCTION 
Most individuals will develop symptoms of presbyopia by age 50 ( Truscott 2009) , and 
approximately 50% of the population with presbyopia does not have adequate corrective lenses, 
resulting in some level of disability when performing tasks re quiring near visual acuity (VA) 
(Holden et al 2008) . This result ed in a global burden of presbyopia exceeding 1.8 billion people 
in 2015 (Holden et al 2008) , and prevalence is increasing. The primary symptom of this 
condition is a progressive blurring of vision when performing near tasks such as reading, sewing, working at a computer, and using a tablet or cellular phone. Other symptoms include headaches and visual fatigue, which impair one’s quality of life ( Truscott 2009) .  
The underlying cause of presbyopia is an inability to change optical power (accommodation) (Donders 1864) . Accommodation is facilitated by the contraction of the ciliary muscle fibers, 
which change the shape an d location of the crystalline lens of the eye. In response to near vision, 
the crystalline lens becomes thicker and more rounded in response to the actions of the ciliary muscle fibers (Garner and Yap 1997, Croft et al 2001, Glasser 2006) . As an individual ages, the 
lens becomes stiffer and less amenable to changing shape in response to ciliary muscle activity and this culminates in the symptoms of presbyopia.  
The neural mechanism of accommodation is the adjustment of the size of the pupil. Pupil size is 
determined by the dimensions of sphincter and dilator muscle spindles of the iris. The pupil 
becomes smaller when the eye accommodates. This reduction in the size of the pupil (termed 
miosis) improves the resolution of the retinal image by preventing diverging light rays hitting the periphery of the cornea and lens from reaching the retina. Miosis further increases the depth of field of the eye. A relatively small pupil offers increased depth of field in a way similar to that achieved by reducing the aperture of a camera.  
Current presbyopia treatment strategies include: corrective lenses with single vision or bifocal/multifocal lenses, corneal refractive surgery, corneal inlay procedures, and  intra-ocular 
lens surgery. Monovision correction improves the near vision of one eye (through the use of lenses, contacts, or surgery) while allowing the other eye to be used for distance vision. This approach has had variable results and may cause disturbances in depth-perception ( Fernandez et 
al 2013). Glasses consisting of a pinhole to block out peripheral rays of light have also been used 
to improve vision in presbyopia ( Emsley 1946, Borish 1975) . Pinhole glasses severely restrict 
the wearer’s peripheral vision placing the patient at risk while driving or performing other similar tasks. Lastly, surgical correction of vision in presbyopia includes conductive keratoplasty, laser -assisted in -situ keratomileusis (LASIK), laser -assisted epithelial 
keratomileusis (LASEK), photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), corneal inlays, and accommodative or multifocal intraocular lenses (IOLs). The results of these procedures are variable, at times inconsistent, and contraindicated in some patient groups (Moussa et al 2017) . 
The inconsistencies regarding the success of some of these procedures of presbyopia treatment indicate a need for alternative strategies.  
The treatment proposed here repurposes a muscarinic receptor agonist to stimulate effects on iris and ciliary contractility via stimulation of Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3. Pilocarpine, a 
muscarinic agonist, has been successful in treating cases of dilated pupil following ocular surgery (Patel et al 2002 ) and a broad spectrum of systemic conditions including botulism 
(Monaco et al 1998) , leprosy ( Lana-Peixoto et al 2014) , sarcoidosis ( Bowie and Givre 2003) , and 
Ross syndrome ( Weller et al 1992 , Chemman am et al 2007) . Low dose pilocarpine

 hydrochloride induced miosis also improves Adie’s pupil (a neurological disorder affecting the 
pupil size) in adults, children ( Younge and Buski 1976, Flach and Dolan 1985, Soylev et al 1997, 
Jacobson and Vierkant 1998, Bartlett and Jaanus 2002) , dogs (Gerding et al 1986) , and cases of 
pharmacologically -induced anisocoria (Jacobson and Olson 1993) .  
Muscarinic receptor agonists are known to induce inflammation ( Verbout and Jacoby 2012) . 
Thus, combining a non- steroidal anti -inflammatory drug (NSAID) with pilocarpine 
hydrochloride may reduce the inflammatory response associated with pilocarpine hydrochloride. Diclofenac sodium is a safe and effective NSAID prescribed for the management of pain following corneal refractive surgery (Narvaez et al 2004 , Colin and Paquette 2006, Parker et al 
2011), inflammation post- cataract extraction (Flach et al 1998, Kocak et al 1998, Flach and 
Dolan 2000) , and allergic conjunctivitis (Laibovitz et al 1995) .  
CSF-1 Ophthalmic Solution (CSF- 1) was well tolerated and resulted in noticeable miosis after 
topical application in an investigator -initiated feasibility study. Two additional clinical studies 
(Phase 2a) demonstrated favorable safety and preliminary efficacy and thus support the continued development of CSF-1 as an ophthalmic solution to treat presbyopia. This is a factorial study to determine the importance of each active ingredient and the impact of increasing pilocarpine hydrochloride concentrations (0.2% versus  0.4%) on the e fficacy of CSF -1 for the 
treatment of presbyopia.  
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
2.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of CSF -1 for the treatment of 
presbyopia. 
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives of this study are:  
• To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of CSF -1 versus the individual 
components for the treatment of presbyopia  
•  
 
3 CLINICAL HYPOTHESES  
The clinical hypothesis of this study is that CSF-1 (the combination of pilocarpine hydrochloride 
and diclofenac sodium ) is superior and/or safer /better tolerated  compared with pilocarpine 
hydrochloride alone and diclofenac sodium alone (0.006%) in improving near vision in subjects 
with presbyopia. 
4 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN 
This is a 4-visit randomized, double-masked, multi -center, parallel -group study evaluating the 
safety and efficacy of CSF-1 compared with pilocarpine hydrochloride alone and diclofenac

7 STUDY MATERIALS  
7.1 Study Treatment s 
7.1.1 Investigational Product 
The IP is CSF-1, a topical eye drop solution for  presbyopia, which 
works by reducing the natural pupil size and increasing the depth of field. The formulation 
developed by Orasis Pharmaceuticals Ltd. is a viscous eye drop containing the active ingredients pilocarpine hydrochloride and diclofenac sodium with the addition of excipients,  
. The inclusion of an 
NSAID (diclofenac sodium) may reduce the inflammatory response induced by pilocarpine 
hydrochloride. Pilocarpine hydrochloride alone will be evaluated for comparison at both 0.2% and 0.4%, with the same formulation tabulated in Table 1, except for the removal of diclofenac sodium. Similarly, a control of diclofenac sodium 0.006% alone will be evaluated for 
comparison, likewise, wi th the same formulation tabulated in  Table 1, except for the removal of 
pilocarpine hydrochloride.

medications during the timeframe noted below:  
i. The day of the study visit or within 12 hours prior to a study visit (chronic, daily use is not allowed):   
a. nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs  (NSAIDs) (e.g.  Advil®, Motrin®)  
b. narcotic (opiate class) pain medication ( e.g. codeine, OxyContin®, Vicodin®, 
Tramadol®) 
ii. Two (2) weeks (14  days) prior to visit 1 or for the duration of the study:  
c.  bladder medication (e.g.  Urecholine®, bethanechol) 
d.  antipsychotics

 8.1.5 Pregnancy  
Females must have a negative urine pregnancy test at visit 1, if female of childbearing potential 
(those who have experienced menarche and who are not surgically sterilized [bilateral tubal 
ligation, hysterectomy , or bilateral oophorectomy] or post-menopausal [12 months after last 
menses]) and must use adequate birth control throughout the study period. Adequate birth control 
is defined as hormonal – oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal contraceptives; mechanical 
– spermicide in conjunction with a barrier such as condom or dia phragm; IUD; or surgical 
sterilization of partner. For non- sexually active females, abstinence may be regarded as an 
adequate method of birth control. 
In the event a female has a positive urine pregnancy test at visit 4, the subject will be withdrawn 
from the study and the investigator  will notify  and the sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge 
of the positive pregnancy test. 
8.1.6 Methods for Assignment to Treatment Groups   
Each subject who signs an ICF will be assigned a subject  number (a five -digit number sta rting 
with the 2 -digit site number followed by a sequential three -digit number starting with 001). Once 
a subject meets all qualification criteria  at visit 2, he/she will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio via 
an interactive response technology system to 1 of 3 treatment groups: 1: CSF -1, 2: pilocarpine 
hydrochloride alone, 3: diclofenac sodium alone, and stratified by iris color (brown  versus light 
[i.e. blue, green, gray, and hazel]) and by baseline manifest refraction spherical equivalent (-4.5 D 
to <-0.5 D, -0.5 D to +0.75 D, and >+0.75 D to +2.0 D) ; randomization will not be stratified by 
site.  
Randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects to treatment, to increase 
the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes ( e.g. iris color and baseline 
characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups.  Double-masked treatment will be used to reduce 
the potential of bias during data collection and the evaluation of clinical endpoints.  
8.2 Concurrent Therapies  and Medical History  
The use of any concurrent medication, prescription , or OTC taken within 30 days of Visit 1, is to 
be recorded on the subject’s source document and corresponding electronic case report form 
(eCRF) along with the reason the medication was taken. 
All significant current and prior ocular medical and surgical history is to be recorded on the 
subject’s source document and corresponding eCRF. All current and prior significant gener al 
medical and surgical history is to be recorded on the subject’s source document and corresponding eCRF. 
Concurrent enrollment in another investigational drug or medical device study is not permitted.  
Prohibited Medications/Treatments  
Washout intervals as described in Section  8.1.2 should be followed for all prohibited 
medications.  Soft contact lenses must be removed at least  7 days prior to study visit 1 and during 
the study, and RGP  contact lenses must be removed at least 14 days prior to study visit 1 and 
during the study.

 8.9 Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
During the course of the study an  monitor, or designee, will make routine site visits to 
review protocol compliance, asse ss IP accountability, and ensure the study is being conducted 
according to the pertinent regulatory requirements. The review of the subjects’ medical records will be performed in a manner that adequately maintains subject confidentiality. Further details of the study monitoring will be outlined in a monitoring plan.  
Regulatory authorities of domestic and foreign agencies, and   quality assurance and /or 
its designees may carry out on -site inspections and/or audits that  may include source data checks. 
Therefore,  direct access to the original source data will be required for inspections and/or audits. 
All inspections and audits will be carried out giving consideration to data protection as well as subject confidentiality to the extent that local, state, and federal laws apply.  
9 ADVERSE EVENTS  
9.1 Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an IP in 
humans, whether or not considered IP- related. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of an IP, without any judgment about causality. An AE  can arise from any use of the IP 
(e.g. off-label use, use in combination with another drug or medical device) and from any route 
of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
All AEs spontaneously reported by the subject and/or in response to an open question from study 
personnel or revealed by observation, physical examination, or other diagnostic procedures will be recorded in the subject’s source document and e CRF. Any clinically relevant deterioration in 
clinical finding is considered an AE and must be recorded. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. 
Documentation regarding the AE  should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, 
severity, relationship to IP, expectedness, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign 
or symptom observed by the physician or reported by the patient upon indirect questioning. All AEs will be collected from the time a subject signs the ICF through the subject’s study exit 
visit. 
9.1.1 Severity 
The severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an AE 
as determined by the investigator  or reported to him/her by the patient/subject.  The assessment of 
severity is made irrespective of relationship to IP or seriousness of the event and should be 
evaluated according to the following scale:  
• Mild: Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and does not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate : Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities.

IND # 131464   05 June 2019 
Proprietary & Confi dential 
Page 33 of 86 
 • Severe: Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapy, and 
interferes with the subject’s daily activities.  
9.1.2 Relationship to Investigational Product 
The relationship of each AE to the IP should be determined by the investigator using these 
explanations: 
• Suspected : A reasonable possibility exists that the IP caused the AE. 
• Not Suspected: A reasonable possibility does not exist that the IP caused the AE. 
“Suspected adverse reaction ” means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
IP caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the IP and the AE. Types of evidence that would suggest a causal 
relationship between the IP and the AE  include: a single occurrence of an event that is 
uncommon and known to be strongly associated with IP exposure ( e.g. angioedema, hepatic 
injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome); one or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly 
associated with IP exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the IP (e.g. 
tendon rupture); an aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the IP-treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control 
group. 
9.1.3 Expectedness  
The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information about 
the IP using these explanations: 
• Unexpected : an AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or is not listed at 
the specificity or severity that has been observed.  
• Expected: an AE that is listed in the IB at the specificity and severity that has been 
observed. 
• Not applicable:  an AE unrelated to the IP. 
AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of products or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological (or other) properties of the product but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the part icular product under investigation are to be considered unexpected. 
The investigator should initially classify the expectedness of an AE . The medical monitor will 
review and determine the expectedness of any serious adverse event (SAE) following the investigator’s assessment. The  final classification  of an AE is subject to the sponsor’s 
determination.  
9.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any 
of the following outcomes: 
• Death; 
• A life-threatening AE; 
Orasis Pharmaceuticals   CSF-1 Ophthalmic Solution 
Protocol 18- 150-0006  Amendment 2 (Version 3.0) 
IND # 131464   05 June 2019 
Proprietary & Confi dential 
Page 34 of 86 
 Note: An AE is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not 
include an AE  that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; 
Note: The term “inpatient hospitalization” refers to any inpatient admission (even if 
< 24 hours). For chronic or long- term inpatients, inpatient admission includes transfer 
within the hospital to an acute/intensive care inpatient unit.  Inpatient hospitalization does 
not include: emergency room visits; outpatient/same -day/ambulatory procedures; 
observation/short stay units; rehabilitation facilities; hospice facilities; nursing homes; or 
clinical research/ Phase 1 units. 
Note: The term “prolongation of existing hospitalization” refers to any extension of an 
inpatient hospitalization beyond the stay anticipated or required for the reason for the initial admission as determined by the investigator or treating physician.  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; 
Note: An SAE specifically related to visu al threat would be interpreted as any potential 
impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes ( e.g. intra-ocular hemorrhage, retinal 
detachment, central corneal ulcer , or damage to the optic nerve). 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
9.3 Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs and their outcomes must be reported to , the study sponsor, and the IRB as required 
by the IRB, federal, state, or local regulations and governing health authorities and recorded on 
the appropriate subject source document and e CRF. 
9.3.1 Reporting a Suspected Unexpected Adverse Reaction  
All AEs that are ‘suspected’ and ‘unexpected’ are to be reported to  the study sponsor, and 
the IRB as required by the IRB, federal, state, or local regulations and governing health authorities.  
9.3.2 Reporting a Serious Adverse Event  
To ensure subject safety, all SAEs, regardless of relationship to the IP, must be immediately 
reported by the investigator to and the sponsor within 24 hours of becoming aware of the 
event. All information relevant to the SAE must be recorded on the appropriate source document, 
SAE Report Form, and eCRF . The investigator is obligated to pursue and obtain information 
requested by and/or the sponsor in addition to the information reported on the source 
document, SAE Report Form, and eCRF . All subjects experiencing a SAE must be followed -up 
with and the outcome reported. 

Orasis Pharmaceuticals   CSF-1 Ophthalmic Solution

IND # 131464   05 June 2019 
Proprietary & Confi dential 
Page 35 of 86 
 In the event of a SAE , the investigator must notify and the sponsor immediately; obtain and 
maintain in his/her files all pertinent medical records, information, and medical judgments from 
colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow-up of the subject; provide and the study sponsor with a complete case history, which includes a statement as to whether the event was or was not suspected to be related to the use of the IP; and inform the IRB of the AE  within their 
guidelines for reporting SAEs. 
Contact information for reporting SAEs: 
Medical Monitor:   
 
  
 
Project Manager:    
 
 
 
9.4 Procedures for Unmasking (if applicable)  
When medically necessary, the investigator may need to determine what treatment has been 
assigned to a subject.  When possible ( i.e. in non-emergent situations),  and/or the study 
sponsor should be notified before unmasking the IP . 
9.5 Type and Duration of the Follow -up of Subjects after Adverse Events  
The investigator will follow unresolved AEs  to resolution, until the subject is lost to follow -up or 
until the AE is otherwise explained.  Resolution means the subject has returned to baseline state 
of health or the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the AE . If 
the subject is lost to follow -up, the investigator should make 3 reasonable attempts to contact the 
subject via telephone, post, or certified mail. All follow -up will be documented in the subject’s 
source document. Non-serious AEs  identified on the last scheduled contact must be recorded on 
the source document with the status noted.  
If the investigator becomes aware of any new information regarding a SAE (i.e. resolution, 
change in condition, or new treatment), a new SAE  Report Form must be completed and 
faxed/emailed to  and/or the study sponsor within 24 hours. The original SAE Report Form is 
not to be altered.  The SAE Report Form should describe whether the event has resolved or 
continues and how the event was treated. 
10 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES AND METHODS OF ANALYSES  
10.1 General Considerations  
In general, quantitative/continuous data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, 
standard deviation [ SD], median, minimum, and max imum). Qualitative/categorical data will be 

Orasis Pharmaceuticals   CSF-1 Ophthalmic Solution 
Protocol 18- 150-0006  Amendment 2 (Version 3.0) 
IND # 131464   05 June 2019 
Proprietary & Confi dential 
Page 36 of 86 
 summarized using frequencies and percentages. Statistical testing, unless otherwise indicated, 
will be performed at a 2 -sided 0.05 significance level. 
For all variables, baseline is defined as the pre-randomization measurement taken at Visit 2 (Day 
1). If the measurement is not available  from Visit 2 (Day 1) , then the measurement from 
screening Visit 1 (Day -1 to -14) will be used as baseline for all treatments/visits. Change from 
baseline will be calculated as follow -up measure minus baseline measure.  
The primary analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints will be conducted in the PP, 
include observed data only, and use st atistical models , which adjust for the correlation between 
treatments within an eye and/or subject.  
The secondary analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints will be conducted in the ITT, 
include observed data only, and use similar statistical models as the primary analyses.  No subject 
data will be excluded from the ITT due to protocol violations/deviations.Sensitivity analysis on 
the primary efficacy variable will be performed on both the PP and ITT imputing missing data as 
failures;  
 
 
 
 
Safety analyses will be conducted in the safety population. 
10.2 Hypotheses  
H01: The difference, between study e yes treated with CSF -1 (0.4%/0.006%) and study eyes 
treated with diclofenac sodium 0.006% , in the percentage of study eyes with a ≥ 3-line (15 letter) 
gain in BCVA at 40 cm, 1-hour post- treatment = 0.  
H11: The difference, between study eyes treated with CSF -1 (0.4%/0.006%) and study eyes 
treated with diclofenac sodium 0.006% , in the percentage of study eyes with a ≥ 3-line (15 letter) 
gain in BCVA at 40 cm, 1-hour post- treatment ≠ 0.  
H02: The difference, bet ween study eyes treated with Pilocarpine (0. 4%) and study eyes 
treated with diclofenac sodium 0.006% , in the percentage of study eyes with a ≥ 3-line (15 letter) 
gain in BCVA at 40 cm, 1-hour post- treatment = 0.  
H12: The difference, between study eyes treated with Pilocarpine (0. 4%) and study eyes 
treated with diclofenac sodium 0.006% , in the percentage of study eyes with a ≥ 3-line (15 letter) 
gain in BCVA at 40 cm, 1-hour post- treatment ≠ 0.  
The study will be considered a success if either of the null hypotheses , H01 or H02, are rejected in 
favor of their corresponding alternative hypotheses, H 11 or H12. The overall Type I error of  the 
2-sided alpha = 0.10 will be preserved through the use of Bonferroni correction procedures testing each hypothesis at a 2 -sided alpha = 0.05. 
If H
01 is rejected and CSF -1 (0.4%/0.006%) is considered a success, then CSF-1 (0.2%/0.006%) 
will be tested against diclofenac sodium (0.006%) at a 2-sided alpha = 0.05. Similarly, if H02 is 
rejected and Pilocarpine (0.4%) is considered a success, then Pilocarpine (0.2%) will be tested against diclofenac sodium (0.006%) at a 2-sided alpha = 0.05. Within these hierarchical

 frameworks, these hypotheses can be tested at a 2 -sided alpha = 0.05 while still preserving an 
overall Type I error o f alpha = 0.10. 
  
  
 
  
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
10.3 Study Populations  
• Intent-to-Treat Analysis Set – The ITT will include all randomized subjects. Subjects in 
the ITT will be analyzed as randomized.  
• Per Protocol Set – The PP set will include subjects in the ITT who do not have s ignificant 
protocol deviations that affect the primary endpoint. Protocol deviations will be assessed 
prior to database lock and unmasking. Subjects in the PP set will be analyzed as treated. 
•  
 
 
 
 
 
• Safety Set – The safety set will include all subjects who have received at least 1 dose of 
the IP. Subjects in the safety population will be analyzed as treated. 
10.4 Unit of Analysis 
The study eye will be used for all monocular a nalyses. The fellow eye will inherently be 
included in all binocular analyses. Both eyes will be displayed and analyzed for all ophthalmic safety variables.  
The study eye will be defined as the eye that meets all enrollment criteria. If both eyes meet all enrollment criteria, then the eye with the worse Visit 2 (Day 1) BCVA at 40 cm will be the study 
eye. If both eyes have the same BC VA at 40 cm, the right eye will be the study eye.

 10.5 Efficacy Endpoints 
10.5.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The percentage of subjects with a ≥ 3- line (15 letter) gain in BCVA at 40 cm, 1-hour 
post-treatment at visit 3 and visit 4  from the baseline measurement  
10.5.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are: 
  
• Percentage of subjects with a ≥ 2-line (10 letter) gain in BC VA at 40 cm  
 at visit 3 and visit 4  
  
10.6 Safety Endpoints  
The safety endpoints are:  
• BCVA 
• Best-corrected low luminance distance VA  
• Slit lamp biomicroscopy  
• Conjunctival redness grading 
• IP drop comfort assessment 
• IOP 
• AEs (reported, elicited, an d observed) 
10.7 Sample Size  
Fifty subjects per each of the 3 treatment arms (150 total), yields an 85% power to establish 
superiority of CSF -1 (0.4%/0.006%) and Pilocarpine (0. 4%) to diclofenac sodium 0.006% alone 
in the percentage of study eyes demonstrating a ≥ 3-line (15- letter) gain in BCVA at 40 cm, 1-
hour post- treatment from the baseline measurement using a Pearson chi -squared test at a 2 -sided 
alpha = 0.05 assuming that the diclofenac sodium 0.006% alone response is 5% and the CSF-1 
response is 27%, resulting in an overall 2 -sided alpha = 0.10 that  accounts for the 2 tests of 
hypotheses utilizing Bo nferroni correction procedures. 
At least approximately 30% of subjects will have light ( i.e. blue, green, gray, and hazel ) iris and 
at least approximately 30% will have a brown iris . The actual percentages will vary based on 
enrollment.  
10.8 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Subject demographics including age, gender, race, ethnicity, and iris color will be presented using summary statistics  (mean, SD, minimum, maximum, and median) .

 10.9 Efficacy Analysis 
10.9.1 Primary Efficacy Analyses  
The primary efficacy variable in this study is the percentage of study eyes with a ≥ 3-line 
(15-letter) gain in BCVA at 40 cm, 1-hour post- treatment at visit 3 and/or visit 4 from the 
baseline measurement. The p rimary analysis will use the PP population on observed data only. 
The primary analyses will be completed using Bonferroni alpha adjust ment to maintain the 
overall Type I error  as detailed in the hypothesis section with statistical inference made on the 
comparisons between CSF -1 (0.4%/0.006%) versus diclofenac sodium 0.006% and  between 
Pilocarpine (0. 4%) versus diclofenac sodium 0.006% Again as detailed in the hypothesis section, 
only if the higher dose concentrations, for CSF-1 (0.4%/0.006%) and/or Pilocarpine (0.4%), 
respectively, are successful will the corresponding lower dose concentrations, for CSF-1 (0.2%/0.006%) and/or Pilocarpine (0. 2%), respectively, have inference made on the statistical 
test.

10.10 Safety Analysis 
Verbatim descriptions of AEs will be mapped to  Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA ) terms and be presented in a data listing. Treatment emergent AEs  (TEAEs) , those 
that occur after the first dose of IP within each period , will be summarized by treatment group 
using frequency and percent for each system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) within 
each SOC. Similar summaries will also be presented for TEAEs related to the IP and by severity. 
When reporting the incidence of AEs, a subject will only be counted once if they ever experience an event within the SOC and ever experience the individual PT within the specific treatment period. AEs  will be reported separately by period.
 
  
 
 
Full details of the safety analyses will be specified in the formal SAP.

Page 41 of 86 
 10.11 Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis may be provided when approximately 50% of the subjects have completed 
the study. If an interim analysis is completed, O’Brien -Fleming alpha spending function will be 
used to specify the interim boundaries for stopping for efficacy and for non- binding futility as 
well as adjusting the final 2 -sided alpha level.  
10.12 Missing Data 
Sensitivity analysis on the primary efficacy variable will be performed on both the PP and ITT 
imputing missing data as failures; additional sensitivity analyses such as pattern mixture model 
multiple imputation methodologies and tipping point analyses may be performed and will be specified in the SAP. 
10.13 Adjustment for Multiplicity  
For the primary hypotheses, the study will be considered a success if either of the null hypotheses, H
01 or H02, are rejected in favor of their corresponding alternative hypotheses, H 11 or 
H12. The overall Type I error of the 2-sided alpha = 0.10 will be preserved through the use of 
Bonferroni correction procedures testing each hypothesis at a 2-sided alpha = 0.05. 
Again as detailed in the hypothesis section, only if the higher dose concentrations, for CSF-1 
(0.4%/0.006%) and/or Pilocarpine (0.4%), respectively, are succes sful will the corresponding 
lower dose concentrations, for CSF-1 (0. 2%/0.006%) and/or Pilocarpine (0. 2%), respectively, 
have inference made on the statistical test.  Within these hierarchical frameworks, these 
hypotheses can be tested at a 2 -sided alpha = 0 .05 while still preserving an overall Type I error 
of alpha = 0.10. 
There will be no adjustment for multiplicity for testing of secondary endpoints. 
 
 
11 COMPLIANCE WITH GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICES, ETHICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS, AND ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUE S  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, current GCPs , including the ICH 
Guidelines, and will, in general, be consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki.  In addition, all 
applicable local, state, and federal requirements relevant to the use of IPs in the countries 
involved will be adhered to. 
11.1  Protection of Human Subjects  
11.1.1 Subject Informed Consent  
Informed consent must take place before any study -specific procedures are initiated.  Signed and 
dated written informed consent must be obtained from each subject and/or from the subject’s 
parent or legal guardian prior to enrollment into the study.  
All ICFs must be approved for use by the sponsor and receive approval/favorable opinion from 
an IRB prior to their use. If the ICF  requires revision ( e.g. due to a protocol amendment or

 significant new safety information), it is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that the 
amended informed consent is reviewed and approved by  prior to submission to the 
governing IRB  and that it is read, signed, and dated by all subjects subsequently enrolled in the 
study as well as those currently enrolled in the study. 
If informed consent is taken under special circumstances (oral informed consent), then the 
procedures to be followed must be determined by  and/or the sponsor and provided in writing 
by  and/or the sponsor prior to the consent process. 
11.1.2 IRB Approval 
This study is to be conducted in accordance with IRB regulations (U.S. 21 CFR Part 56.103). 
The investigator must obtain appropriate IRB approval before initiating the study and 
re-approval at least annually.  
Only an IRB-approved version of the ICF will be used. 
11.2  Ethical Conduct of the Study  
This study will be co nducted in accordance with the ethical principles that originated with the 
Declaration of Helsinki.  
11.3  Subject Confidentiality  
All personal study subject data collected and processed for the purposes of this study should be maintained by the investigator and his/her staff with adequate precautions as to ensure that the 
confidentiality of the data is in accordance with local, state, and federal laws and regulations.  
Monitors, auditors and other authorized representatives of  the sponsor, the IRB approving this study, the FDA, the Department of Health and Human Services , other domestic government 
agencies, and other foreign regulatory agencies will be granted direct access to the study subject’s original medical and study records for verification of the data and/or clinical trial procedures. Access to this information will be permitted to the aforementioned individuals to the extent permitted by law.  
A report o f the results of this study may be published or sent to the appropriate health authorities 
in any country in which the IP may ultimately be marketed  in, but the subject’s identity will not 
be disclosed in these documents. 
11.4  Documentation 
Source documents ma y include a subject’s medical records, hospital charts, clinic charts, the 
investigator’s subject files, as well as the results of diagnostic tests such as X -rays, laboratory 
tests, and electrocardiograms . The investigator’s copy of the eCRFs  serves as the investigator’s 
record of a subject’s study- related data.  
11.4.1 Retention of Documentation 
All study-related correspondence, patient records, consent forms, record s of the distribution and 
use of all IPs, and copies of case report forms should be maintained on f ile for at least 2  years 
after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending 
or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region; or until at least two years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IP. These documents will be 
retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an 

Orasis Pharmaceuticals   CSF-1 Ophthalmic Solution

 agreement with the sponsor. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the 
investigator/institution  as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. 
If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the responsibility of keeping study records, custody must be transferred to a person who will accept the responsibility.  The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name and address of the new 
custodian. 
11.5 Labeling, Packaging, Storage, Accountability, and Return or Disposal of 
Investigational Product 
11.5.1 Labeling/Packaging 
  
  
The IP will be packaged and labeled into clinical kits . Each subject will be  assigned a single 
master kit containing two smaller (inner) kits. Each master kit will be uniquely identified by the 
kit number; the 2 smaller kits inside will bear the same kit number with additional designation indicating the visit at which each is to b e dispensed (i.e., visit 2 or visit 3).  
 
Clinical label texts for the packaging will meet applicable regulatory requirements and include the statement “Caution: New Drug -Limited by Federal Law to Investigational Use.”  
11.5.2 Storage of Investigational Product 
  
 
 
 
 
  
11.5.3 Accountability of Investigational Product 
For in-office dosing, the IP is to be administered by study site personnel, and is to only be used 
in accordance with this protocol. The IP must only be distributed to subjects properly qualified 
under this protocol to receive IP. 
The investigator must keep an accurate accounting of the IP received from the supplier. This 
includes the amount of IP administer ed to subjects and the amount returned or disposed 
throughout the course of the study. A detailed inventory must be completed for the IP. 
11.5.4 Return or Disposal of Investigational Product 
All IPs will be returned to the sponsor or their designee or destroyed. The return or disposal of IP 
will be specified in writing.  Any remaining IP will be collected from subjects at visit 3 and 
visit 4 before study exit.

investigational product can be found in the study IP Manual. 
11.6 Recording of Data on Source Documents and Electronic Case Reports Forms 
(eCRFs) 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that study data is completely and accurately recorded 
on each subject’s s ource document, eCRF , and all study- related material.  All study data should 
also be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, and original. Recorded datum should only be 
corrected in a manner that does not obliterate, destroy, or render illegible the previous entry (e.g. by drawing a single line through the incorrect entry and writing the revision next to the 
corrected data).  An individual who has corrected a data entry should make clear who made the 
correction and when by adding to the correction his/her initials as well as the date of the correction. 
11.7 Handling of Biological Specimens  
Not applicable 11.8 Publications  
Authorship and manuscript composition will reflect cooperation among all parties involved in

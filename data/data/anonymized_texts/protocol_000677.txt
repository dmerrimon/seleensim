1.Objectives
1.1. Purpose, specific aims, or objectives:
The purpose  of this proposal  is to test the efficacy of yoga  as a mind and body intervention  to 
decrease stress, anxiety,  and depression in parents of critically ill neonates hospitalized in the 
Seattle Children’s and University of Washington neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Specific 
aims include developing a randomized controlled pilot study to elucidate the optimal research 
strategy with which to implement mind and body interventions for parents of NICU patients.  We 
will ultimately use these data to plan a multicenter  Randomized Controlled  Trial (RCT) to 
evaluate the short and long-term  effects  of yoga practice on NICU parents, the parent-child 
interaction, and child outcomes.
  
1.2. Hypotheses to be tested:
  
We hypothesize that a combined program  of breath  work,  physical practice  and 
meditation will decrease parental  stress, anxiety, and depression in the NICU,  improve  
parent-child bonding,  and through this, child, and family  outcomes.
  
2.Background
2.1. Relevant prior experience and gaps in current knowledge:
  
Preterm infants are often  critically ill and require  prolonged hospitalization in neonatal  intensive  
care units (NICUs). The care of these  infants is often regionalized, so that they can get the 
specialized treatment  needed  in centers with expertise in delivering this care. An unintended 
consequence of regionalization is the physical  and emotional isolation parents experience when 
they stay with their hospitalized child far from family,  friends, and work. As a result of these  
stressors, loss of parental control, autonomy, and concern  for their child’s wellbeing, nearly half 
of NICU mothers  develop anxiety, depression, or posttraumatic  stress disorder, and this may 
persist for years. 
Helping parents to cope with the birth and hospitalization  of a preterm  infant is critical for the 
parents’ health and wellbeing, as well as for the optimal  development  of their child, as parental 
anxiety and depression may affect  parent-child  bonding and result in altered  child development. 
The practice  of yoga,  which  encompasses physical  postures (asana), but also includes breathing  
techniques (pranayama), and meditation (dhyana), has proven benefits  in many areas  of 
medicine and wellness including stress management, mental and emotional  health and 
promoting sleep. Given the positive effects on both physical and emotional health,  these mind  
and body techniques are promising  as a therapeutic modality by which parental stress, anxiety 
and depression could be reduced.
There are gaps in our knowledge as previous studies of yoga have not occurred  in hospital 
settings and have not included subjects in an acute state  of distress such  as parents of critically 
ill hospitalized neonates. Furthermore, in the current COVID-19  environment it is important to 
explore ways to make  yoga interventions available  to families by remote  access, and to test 
whether this approach  is successful.
Faculty advisors  of this project have extensive prior experience with design  and completion of 
multicenter trials involving  newborn infants in NICUs across  the United  States.  To allow us to 
evaluate the use of yoga  as a means for helping parents  cope with hospitalization of their 
newborn infants,  we have enlisted a team  of yoga practitioners including  a registered  prenatal 
and postnatal  yoga teacher (Leanne Matullo), UW NICU  RN, yoga teacher  and NICU parent 
advocate (Rebecca DeBoer, RN). Faculty advisor  Dr. Sandra Juul is also a certified  Yoga  and

Meditation teacher  and will provide guidance in the design  of the yoga intervention for NICU 
parents.
2.2. Relevant preliminary data:2
  
This is the continuation of a prior project: Yoga in the NICU Pilot Study see 2.4. 
Surveys were completed  by both NICU parents  (n=31)  and hospital stakeholders 
(n=140) to assess the feasibility and desirability of a yoga  intervention for NICU parents. 
Preliminary data for Aim 1 suggest that NICU  parents  struggle  primarily with stress and 
anxiety compared with depression. Parents  with an infant hospitalized at UW NICU or 
SCH NICU primarily cope with the admission through social  support (e.g.,  talking with 
friends and family), though  mindfulness and meditation activities  are considered  
important as well. A small  percentage of hospital stakeholders surveyed  had concerns 
about the safety  (22%) and liability (14%)  of a yoga intervention for parents,  however 
most stakeholders had few concerns.
We were pleased  to learn through our survey data that hospital  stakeholders strongly 
view an intervention  of yoga for NICU parents to increase parent satisfaction  and 
confidence. Overall, there was overwhelming support from both parents and 
stakeholders in both institutions for a yoga intervention for parents of NICU babies.

5.Procedures Involved
5.1. Study  design:9
  
This will be a randomized  controlled pilot study to elucidate the optimal research strategy with 
which to implement mind and body interventions for parents  of NICU patients , at 2 sites 
(University of Washington NICU  and Seattle Children’s Hospital NICU) comparing: 1) control  
group 2) yoga intervention  (i.e: breathing  exercises + meditation +postures).  
Parents will be enrolled in the study after day 10 of infant admission to NICU and begin 
participation by day 14 of NICU  admission (see Recruitment methods section 19). 
The non-birth  parent will be invited  to participate in this study and may participate without the 
birth parent. If both parents  are participating the partner would be randomized to the same group 
(control or intervention) see randomization section 5.2. In the circumstance that the birth parent 
declines participation and non-birth parent consents to participation, we will still obtain  consent 
from parents to access infant medical  records, however  we will not obtain birth parent EPDS  
scale (see section 5.2)
If an infant  is transferred from UWMC to SCH as part of their clinical  care, a parent enrolled 
initially at UWMC may continue participation in this study while infant  is admitted at SCH.
Control group: Parents  will experience usual  care including all available parental support as 
practiced in the specific site NICU.  We will utilize a ‘waitlist’  control model for this project, 
whereby the parents randomized to control group will have unlimited  access  to the online 
platform hosting the yoga  intervention following the completion of the study period.  
Intervention group: In addition  to usual  care, the parents randomized to the intervention group  
will be provided a yoga mat and participate  in 30-min  online led yoga sessions done at least 
twice weekly at the parent’s pace using a secure, virtual platform (website). There will be 6 total 
yoga classes (one introduced per week for a 6 week period). Each yoga session will be divided  
into three components, which  will vary in duration based on a curriculum designed specifically 
with the post-partum state of mothers in mind:
Yoga  postures (Asana) = low impact gentle  postures meant to be done individually  
Breathing techniques  (Pranayama) = deliberate modifications of breath such  as rapid

diaphragmatic breathing,  slow/deep breathing, alternate nostril  breathing, breath  holding
Meditation  (Dhyana) = guided meditation 
The goal of this project is to conduct a pilot study to both allow optimization of engagement  for a 
future definitive study, and to obtain empirical estimates of effect  sizes and variability  within the 
target study population. 
  
5.2. Research procedures:10
  
Screening: see section 19
Randomization: The parent(s) who consent to participate  in the study will be randomized  using 
a 2x2 computerized block randomization (www.sealedenvelope.com/simple-randomiser/v1/lists).  
Participants will be stratified  by NICU into two groups A) usual care B) yoga intervention. At the 
time of consent, the study coordinator will be blinded  to the randomization,  and the parent will 
be presented with a sealed envelope that identifies group A (control)  and group B (intervention). 
When both parents from the same family  are eligible and interested in study participation, both 
will be consented and then randomized to the same group and followed separately with outcome 
surveys. Since parental outcomes are likely correlated. Prior to randomization we will ask 
parents to designate one parent as the primary  study participant. Outcomes of the parent 
designated as the secondary study participant will be included in exploratory  analyses  that 
appropriately accounts for potentially  correlated outcomes.
Intervention Group: Parents will receive an information sheet (see ‘Welcome Packet  YOGA 
GROUP’ in “other attachments” ) explaining the practice of yoga, meditation and breathing 
exercises, FAQs about the study including  how to access an electronic tablet while  in the unit (if 
parent is unable  to supply their own device), instructions on how to access study website and 
Zoom. Parents will also sign the study consent  form and HIPAA authorization,  receive a 
personal yoga mat, ear-pods  (if needed),  and details  regarding  compensation for the study  (see 
23.1). Participants have the opportunity to keep the ear-pods and yoga mat at the conclusion of 
the study. Parents  in the intervention group will receive usual care for parent support offered in 
site NICU and be enrolled  in a 6-week  virtual  yoga  curriculum (see description in 5.1). They  will 
also be asked to periodically fill out questionnaires  throughout  the study.
Control Group:  Parents will sign the study consent  and HIPAA  forms. Information will be 
provided regarding the waitlist control model  (see 5.1), and details about the compensation  for 
the study (see 23.1).  Parents in the control group  will receive usual care for parent support 
offered in site NICU. They will also be asked  to periodically via email to fill out identical 
questionnaires as the intervention  group throughout the 6-week study period.
In general, a participating non-birth parent may skip self-report  items that are considered not 
applicable, however there should be very few items that cannot be answered by either  parent. 
SELF-REPORT SURVEYS:
Yoga in the NICU Introduction Survey: demographic survey completed on a smart device  at the 
time of enrollment. This survey (see supplemental materials) will include basic demographic  data 
including age, ethnic  background, race, education  level, employment  status, assessment of 
household food insecurity (measure  of SES), assessment of prior mental health treatment (in the 
past 12 months before  delivery of premature baby), assessment of yoga practice  prior to and 
during pregnancy (for either birth parent or participating partner). We will also collect a personal 
email address where subsequent study  surveys will be sent directly  from REDCap.

To further assess parental stress, anxiety and depression,  participants in both arms of the study 
will complete the following  surveys (see supplemental materials)
1.Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS21): to assess  baseline participant depression, 
anxiety, and stress  with these three self-report scales. Each of the three scales contains 7 
items divided  into subscales with similar content  (depression, anxiety,  and stress). Scores  
for depression, anxiety and stress are calculated  by summing the scores for relevant items. 
Two-times: at enrollment  and conclusion of study
2.Parental Stress Scale: Neonatal Intensive Care  Unit (PSS:NICU) a 26-item self-report scale 
designed to measure the degree of stress experienced by parents during hospitalization 
related to alterations in their parental role, the appearance and behavior of their child, and 
sights and sound of the unit.
Three times: at study  start, midpoint (3 weeks) and at the conclusion of the study
3.Postpartum  Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ) a 19-item self-report scale evaluating two factors  
involved in parent-infant bonding. 
One time: at conclusion of the study
4.Course Completion Survey filled out by all participants  at the conclusion of the study. There  
will be specific  questions in this survey directed through branching logic to parents in the 
intervention group  relating to safety  and adverse events as well as parent  opinions about  the 
yoga intervention.  
To address  the baseline level of post-partum depression in the parent population, we will 
obtain individual responses and composite scores of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scales  
(EPDS) that have  been  administered by the unit Social  Worker (as a regular part of parental 
NICU care). EPDS are entered  by SW and stored in the infant EPIC chart (at UWMC) or the 
maternal chart (at SCH) (see section 5.4). For non-birth parent participants,  or those  participants 
who have not received a baseline EPDS  by the unit social worker, the study coordinator will 
administer the EPDS (see other attachments) at the time of enrollment as part of this research 
study. The EPDS has been validated for use in male partners (Matthey S, et. al. Journal of 
Affective Disorders (2001)). In the circumstance that birth parent declines participation and non-
birth parent consents  to participation, we will not obtain birth parent  EPDS scale. 
Video and Web-based Resources: A study website  will be designed using the www.rise.com 
(team url = nest) platform, a secure, user friendly, and engaging virtual  platform  for creating  
courses, guides and training content.  Rise is easy to navigate, adaptable for all devices  (mobile, 
tablet, PC), and supports multimedia activities. Study website will be designed to accommodate 
the 6-week study period (see webpage screen shots in supplemental materials). Yoga sessions 
(30 min each) will be pre-recorded and uploaded as links on the study website (see sample files 
in supplemental materials). A tablet device will be made available for use in the building 
(UWMC/SCH) for those  parents who do not have  a suitable personal device. 
UWMC: 9 tablets available  for parents  to borrow courtesy of NICU
SCH: 3 tablets have been  made available for parents to borrow  courtesy of Child Health, 
Behavior and Development (CHBD)  and Seattle Children’s IT
Parental response and adherence to the online program  will be assessed throughout the study  
period by tracking participation of the yoga sessions on the website (rise.com)
Zoom check-ins: There will be optional weekly  virtual (Zoom) ‘check-in sessions’ available for

participants in the intervention group to speak directly with a yoga instructor in real time to ask 
questions. A recurring  date/time will be selected by study  coordinator,  and yoga instructors will 
sign up to host sessions using a google  document available in a shared drive. The study 
coordinator will substitute if a yoga instructor is unavailable, and relay  questions from 
participants to the instructor via email.  For Spanish speaking participants logging into the zoom  
session, we will call a Certified Language  Interpreter  (CLI) remotely (see other documents  for 
CLI access) to interpret  Q&A  session.
  
5.3. Data sources that will be used  to collect data about subjects:11

9.2. Exclusion criteria for each subject population:
  
Expected length of stay of NICU inpatient  weeks <6
Parent  only speaks  or reads in a language  other than English or Spanish
Parent  plans to relinquish  child
Child  or parents are too unstable as assessed by the Attending Physician
9.2.1. Justification if subjects who use a language other  than English or subjects with a 
parent/legally authorized representative (LAR)  who uses a language  other than 
English, will be excluded from the research:21
The goal of this pilot study is to generate data to support  a parent mindfulness  intervention of 
yoga, breath work, and meditation to reduce stress, depression, and anxiety of parents with 
infants hospitalized in the NICU. Based on the small  sample of parent  participants, the inclusion 
of multiple languages to this study  population may confound our research or render appropriate 
analysis of the data impractical.  Further limitations of including a population that uses a 
language other than English  or Spanish include lack of appropriate validated instruments,  
surveys, or assessments  published in other languages to determine  parental stress  and parent-
child bonding  for NICU  parents. 
To improve equity within this project the PI (Dr. Sara Neches) is submitting  this modification of 
the current  IRB to include  Spanish speaking  parents. The results of this pilot study will be used 
to generate a universally accessible parent mindfulness  intervention that is inclusive of all 
ethnicities and languages with the goal to be inclusive of every parent in the NICU regardless of 
their language  of care.

All infants at UWMC  and SCH  NICU  will be screened if born <32-weeks gestation and/or 
<1500g or LOS estimated >6 weeks
  
10.4. Power analysis:
  
According to research by Pace et al. (2016)  the proportion of parents with low birthweight infants 
hospitalized in NICUs who endorsed anxiety approached  50%. Smaller  studies of parents of 
very low birthweight infants  have shown  rates of depression in mothers  and fathers ranging from 
30-60% (Meyer, EC et al (1994), Davis, L (2003), Mackley,  AB, 2010). The study population in 
Aim 1 (NICU parents)  reported  a higher level of baseline  anxiety and stress (~60%) regarding 
having an infant in the NICU.

Based on this information, and an anticipated 20-30% decrease in stress  and anxiety with 
yoga practice,  we will need  a sample  size of 16 parents enrolled in each group to see a power 
of 0.80 at an alpha level of 0.05. Given this information, and the possibility of attrition of study 
participants, we will plan to enroll 20 parents in control and 20 parents  in intervention group for 
this pilot study.
  
11.Withdrawal of Subjects
11.1. Anticipated circumstances  under which subjects will be withdrawn  from the research without 
their consent:
  
N/A
  
11.2. Procedures for orderly termination:
  
N/A
  
11.3. Procedures that will be followed when subjects withdraw from the research, including  partial 
withdrawal from procedures with continued data collection and withdrawal from 
data/biospecimen banking:
  
Parents may withdraw from the study at any time. Data will be retained for analysis  even if 
participant withdraws. Parents will only receive compensation for the portion of the study 
completed.
  
12.Risks  to Subjects
12.1. Reasonably foreseeable risks to subjects (include each study population, each arm, and 
optional procedures): 
  
Infants: risks related  to breach of confidentiality due to improper use of personally  identifying 
medical information.  To minimize these risks as much as possible, personally  identifying 
information will be stored  in the secure manner  described  in 15.1 below, and only de-identified 
aggregated data will be used  in the analysis.
Parents: 
Control group: Parents  will receive usual care available  for parental support. There  are minimal 
risks associated with filling out the research questionnaires (depression, social anxiety,  parental-
child bonding,  NICU related  stress).
Intervention group: Parents in the intervention  group will receive usual care for parent support. 
There are minimal risks associated with filling out the research questionnaires (depression, 
social anxiety, parental-child bonding, NICU related stress). There  is minimal risk of physical 
injury in the yoga intervention group,  as parents  will be performing low impact postures  designed 
with the specific  physical limitations  of post-partum mothers in mind.
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores of parents in both control  and intervention  groups 
will be accessed from the infant or maternal  charts (or administered separately if not 
administered by social  worker or if non-birth parent is participant), thus there are risks related to 
breach of confidentiality due to improper use of personally identifying medical information. 
  
12.2. Procedures with unforeseeable risks:

pregnant:
  
N/A
  
12.4. Risks to others  who are not subjects:
  
N/A
  
12.5. Procedures performed  to lessen the probability or magnitude of risks:
  
Risk of breach of confidentiality will be minimized by storing  personally identifying information in 
the secure manner described in 15.1 below, and only de-identified  aggregated data will be used 
in the analysis . 
Instructions of how to minimize risks of physical  injury will be explained prior to performing 
physical postures, and during each session. There will be weekly virtual  check-in  sessions for 
participants to ask questions in real time to a yoga instructor.
 
13.Potential Benefits to Subjects
13.1. Potential benefits that individual  subjects may experience from taking part in the research:36

birth and hospitalization of a preterm infant, improve parent-child bonding.
  
14.Data Analysis/Management
14.1. Data analysis plan, including statistical procedures:
  
All data will be collected in REDCap spreadsheets and analyzed using STATA  17.0 statistics 
and data analysis software using appropriate  statistical tests. Additional  assistance with 
statistics will be provided by the Institute of Translational  Health Sciences  (ITHS) Research 
Services at the UW.
  
14.2. Quality control procedures  for collected data:37
  
Data will be reviewed by study mentors for accuracy 
 
15.Confidentiality and Privacy38
15.1. Procedures to secure  research records39, data, and/or  biospecimens during storage, use, and 
transmission:
  
Record ID, identifying info (name, email address), infant  demographics, and participant 
responses to self-report  scales will be stored in a UW REDCap database.  Note  that any EPDS 
administered to either birth parent or non-birth  parent as part of this study will be linked to the 
participant by their record ID number. There will be no identifying parent information  on any 
paper forms. Results  of EPDS will then be entered by the study coordinator into a secure 
REDCap form according to participant record ID. 
Links to study surveys will be sent to participants  directly from REDCap  via email and data. 
Infant medical record numbers  and surname  will be saved on a password protected file in the 
Seattle Children’s computer  server. There will be no patient identifying information associated  
with the study website.

Parents will be invited to the website, provided  a username  and prompted to create a unique  
password. There will be no patient information on the website, and no means  for synchronous 
communication. There will be a means of asynchronous communication (email) between  the 
participant and PI during the study for questions or concerns. 
Zoom video  conferencing: UW HIPAA secure zoom account
A recurring zoom  meeting will be scheduled  weekly  for parents to communicate directly with a 
yoga teacher. See 15.1 for privacy related  to zoom
  
17.2. Measures in place to protect the privacy or confidentiality of subjects:43
  
No identifying information regarding  the patient  (infant) will be shared during this study. Weekly 
zoom check-ins will be voluntary and for parents  participating in the yoga intervention only, no 
names or patient information will be disclosed  during  these meetings. 
  
17.3. Types  of communications  that will be submitted to the IRB for review:44

19.Recruitment Methods46
19.1. When, where, and how potential subjects will be recruited47:
  
University of Washington and Seattle Children’s Hospital: All infants born <32 weeks 
gestation and/or <1500g  or with a length of stay estimated to be >6 weeks, and who has been 
admitted to the University of Washington  NICU or Seattle Children’s NICU will be screened for 
eligibility by principal investigator (Sara Neches). 
A screening form (see other attachments) will be maintained on REDCap to document patients  
screened, reasons  for eligibility/ineligibility, reasons for nonparticipation of eligible parents. A 
recruitment log (see other attachments) will be maintained in a password protected database 
located on the Seattle Children’s server containing MRN of enrolled infant, record ID of parent  
participant and date of consent for data collection purposes. PI will send secure  email  with 
names of patients who meet inclusion criteria to weekly  attending of record for final approval to 
contact (re: patient/parent stability). PI or representative (resident/fellow or APP caring for 
infant) will make  first contact  with parent with a standardized bedside conversation  or phone

call to explain  study.   If family  is interested in more information PI will meet  family in person  in 
the NICU at least 10 days after admission. Following consent, the introductory  survey and first 
set of self-report scales will be completed during enrollment  process. 
Participants in the intervention group will be guided on how to log into the study website, and 
will be instructed to respond to emails with links for self-report scales to be completed 
throughout the study period.  Participants in the control group will be instructed to respond to 
emails with links for self-report scales to be completed throughout the study period.  The first 
week of intervention will begin on the Monday after enrollment or 10-14 days after infant  
admission to the NICU.
Note that UWMC is a birth hospital, thus 10 days after admission will likely  be 10 days of life. 
Infants are typically referred/transferred to SCH NICU from other NICUs, and thus 10 days 
after admission may reflect different ages.  The inclusion  criteria for both institutions will be the 
same. 
19.2. Steps  that will be taken to protect privacy during the recruitment process:48
Site enrollment  log will be maintained in a password protected database located on the Seattle 
Children’s server.  Screening  form will be maintained by the site PI on a secure REDCap  
database, and will contain  the following information: Record  ID, screening date,  mother/father, 
eligibility (yes/no), attending  approval to enroll (y/n), whether  they were enrolled,  and if not 
enrolled, the reason  why. If the parent is enrolled as a study participant, document  that 
consent was obtained, and the study ID number.  MRN  numbers of infants  will be stored on a 
separate recruitment log in a password protected excel sheet  on the Seattle Children’s server. 
MRN number is required to access infant  demographic  information. 
19.3. Sources of subjects:49  
All parents of infants born <32 weeks gestation or <1500 grams will be screened by study 
coordinator.
Subjects will be recruited by screening of the electronic  medical record (EPIC) at the 
University of Washington and Seattle Children’s NICUs
  
19.4. Methods  that will be used to identify potential subjects:
  
See 19.1
  
19.5. Materials that will be used to recruit  subjects:50 
A Study  poster will be used  to inform staff, faculty,  and parents about the study.  Posters will be 
available in the NICU Attending office and NICU Staff lounges and staff bathrooms at both 
institutions to increase awareness of the study
  
19.6. Recruitment methods  not controlled by Seattle Children’s:
  
N/A  
  
20.Consent/Assent/Permission51 
20.1. Consent/assent/permission  process:52
The Attending health care provider will approve the research coordinator to meet and discuss 
the study with potential subjects. If either parent is interested in learning  more  about the study,  
Principal Researcher: Sara Neches,  MD

Protocol  Version Date: 11/4/2021
Protocol Template (HRP-503) Click Template Version  4.1: July 2021 
Page 17 of 31
the research coordinator or investigator will be notified  so they can discuss the study with the 
parent and seek consent  in person. Investigators will only approach a family after infant’s 
attending heath care provider gives permission and family  indicates  that they are interested  in 
further information about  the study. The parent may withdraw from study at any time. 
Investigator will retain the original signed  document, and a copy  will be provided to the 
subjects. Consent for participation must be obtained after the baby is at least  10 days  of age 
(UWMC) or has been admitted at least 10 days (SCH).  An identical consent  form will be 
presented by the research coordinator to both control and intervention  groups reviewing the 
practice of yoga, meditation and breathing  exercise  as well as the details of the study.
20.1.1. Alternative way of obtaining consent/assent/permission information  for individuals who are 
not able to receive/access/use the electronic  consent system being used or explanation as 
to why an alternative process is unnecessary:53
Consent form will be signed on paper, no electronic  consent  system will be used. Any 
initial parent REDCap  surveys or demonstration  of the study website will be done on iPads 
made available specifically for parents participating in the YIN study. 
20.1.2. Where the consent/assent/permission process will take place:
  
At the site where infant is admitted (UWMC  or SCH NICU) in person with parent(s). 
  
20.1.3. Steps that will be taken to protect privacy during the consent/assent/permission  process:54
  
Consent discussion will take place in patient’s individual room or private  conference room  if 
available, keeping in mind  the privacy  of the parent  and infant. 
20.2. Plan for documenting consent/assent/permission:55
Consent will be documented in writing on a paper form provided at the time of the consent  
conversation. REDCap  screening form will document date of consent. REDCap randomization 
form will record date of randomization and outcome of randomization (Group  A or B).
20.2.1. Plan to confirm that the individual who provides the electronic  signature56 is the subject  (or 
their parent/LAR), when the signature  is not personally witnessed by a member of the 
study team or explanation as to why such  a plan is unnecessary:57
Study coordinator will only receive actual  signatures of participants  on paper consenting 
forms. NO electronic signature will be used.

21.HIPAA Authorization and RCW Criteria
21.1. HIPAA  Authorization (check all boxes that apply):
☐ The study  does not involve  the receipt, creation, use and/or  disclosure of protected health 
information (PHI).81
☒ HIPAA  authorization  will be obtained  as part of a signed consent  form.  
☒ The study  will access PHI without prior authorization from subjects (including for 
recruitment purposes – e.g., reviewing the medical  record to determine  eligibility).  
Complete Section  21.2 to request Waiver  of HIPAA  Authorization.
☐ Subjects will review  a written  statement/information sheet with the appropriate HIPAA 
language but will not provide a written signature.  Complete Section 21.2 below to 
request an Alteration  of HIPAA Authorization.82
☐ Other.   Explain:83
N/A
  
21.2. HIPAA  Waiver/Alteration Criteria: 84  
21.2.1. Reasons for requesting a waiver or alteration of HIPAA  Authorization: 
Research coordinator or designee  will review medical record to determine eligibility 
for this study.
21.2.2. The use or disclosure of PHI involves  no more  than a minimal risk to privacy  of 
individuals, based on, at least  the presence of the following elements:
21.2.2.1. An adequate plan to protect the identifiers  from improper use and 
disclosure: 
  
Record ID, screening date and parent surname, parent email address 
will be saved in the screening  form, and additional data regarding 
demographics and characteristics of NICU baby and parent will all be 
collected and stored in a secure REDCap database. Infant surname and 
MRN will be stored in a recruitment sheet located in a password 
protected file on the Seattle Children’s Server. 
  
21.2.2.2. An adequate plan to destroy identifiers at earliest opportunity consistent 
with conduct  of research:
  
Identifiers saved in REDCap and SCH server will be destroyed within 
one year of collection. 
  
21.2.2.3. Assurances that PHI will not be reused or disclosed to any other party or 
entity, except  as required by law or for authorized oversight of the 
research:
  
PHI collected will not be reused or disclosed to any entity, except  as it 
relates to concerns for parent safety (e.g.,  unit social worker will be

contacted if depression or anxiety scales are concerning  and further 
intervention for parent  is advised).
  
21.2.3. The research  could not practicably be conducted without the waiver or alteration of 
authorization:
  
 Without the waiver,  screening for eligibility would not be possible. All parents  of 
infants in the NICU  would need to be approached, which would  unnecessarily 
burden those  who are ineligible for the research.
  
21.2.4. The research  could not practicably be conducted without access  to and use of the 
PHI:85
  
This research  requires  the screening of patients in the NICU prior to consent to 
target the study to the appropriate population. 
  
22.Payments/Costs to Subjects86
22.1. Amount, method,  and timing of payments  to subjects:87
  
Parents participating in both control  and intervention groups will receive  a total of $50 in gift

and supervise the research:92
  
Sara Neches. MD is a current Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine fellow  at the University of 
Washington/Seattle Children’s Hospital,  and holds a BA in Psychology from Hunter College, The 
City University of New York.  Additionally, she has been a practitioner of yoga for over 15 years.  
Dr. Neches is supported  in this research  by Dr. Sunny Juul Professor and Division Head of 
Neonatology at the University of Washington. Dr. Juul has ample experience  in running clinical 
trials, as she has previously led both single site studies, and multicenter  trials. She is the PI of 
the NINDS funded Preterm Epo Neuroprotection  Trial (PENUT; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), and multi-PI of 
the High-Dose  Erythropoietin  for Asphyxia  and Encepha lopathy trial (HEAL; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Dr. 
Juul is also a certified Yoga and Meditation teacher, having  taken a 200-hour  Yoga Teacher  
Training in December 2019, and a 20-hour Yoga Philosophy class  in May 2020.  Dr. Dennis  
Mayock was an integral part of AIM 1 of the YIN study (to assess feasibility), and serves as a 
research advisor to Dr. Neches.  
  
24.2. Other  resources available to conduct the research:93
  
We plan to recruit  a total of 40 parents participants (20 from UWMC NICU and 20 from SCH 
NICU). Based  on a query of NeoData software for the years 2018-2020, there are 
approximately 10-20  admissions monthly of infants meeting the screening criteria (<32 weeks 
gestation or <1500 grams) at the UWMC and 5-14 admissions monthly  of infants meeting 
criteria at Seattle Children’s  NICU. 
We need  to recruit a total of 20 parents from each NICU  site over the 5-month recruitment 
period. We will begin enrolling  parents in the study in Aug 2021 and recruit parents for a total 
of 5 months (Dec 2021). Sara Neches  (PI) will dedicate research time to the intervention as 
well as the collection and analysis of data. As detailed in the proposal above,  research will be 
conducted using a virtual  web-based platform to be accessed by participants in a location  
determined by the participant  but not limited to bedside  with neonate at UWMC or SCH  NICU, 
Seattle Children’s Chapel and Meditation room as made available by chaplain,  hotel or other 
lodging. 
This study poses minimal  risk to subjects.  Should concerns arise regarding  the psychological 
state of parents throughout the study these concerns will be brought  to the attention of the site 
NICU social  worker.

25.2.1. Process to ensure communication among sites:94
  
Prior to the initiation of recruitment Sara Neches  will communicate with attending 
physicians, APPs at both sites, fellow physicians, site NICU leadership,  social 
workers at both UWMC  and SCH  to alert staff of project, recruitment methods and 
study time-period.  Sara Neches will remain in direct contact  with leadership in both 
sites and will ensure modifications to the study proposal are accurately reflected  in 
the study materials. Sara  Neches will remain in close contact throughout  the study 
time-period regarding  recruitment, enrollment, and randomization of participants.  
General study  documents (blank consent form, study packet, mindfulness readings, 
blank surveys) will be available to all investigators via shared drive. 
  
25.2.2. Process to ensure all site investigators conduct the study according to the IRB 
approved protocol  and report all non-compliance:
    
Sara Neches will periodically report progress  during Dr. Juul’s clinical  study meeting  
where individual projects are discussed with full study team.  Copies of this IRB will 
be presented to all site investigators.       
  
25.2.3. Process to ensure all required approvals are obtained at each site:
    
See 25.2.1.
  
25.2.4. Process to ensure all sites are informed of any problems  and/or interim results:
  
Besides weekly progress reports through the clinical study group, Sara Neches will 
plan to check  in with NICU leadership of both sites (UWMC and SCH) at the 
midpoint of the study (Oct 2021) to present interim results and discuss any problems  
with recruitment  or participation.

1 Provide a list of the participating  sites (pSITEs). pSITEs are those sites outside Seattle Children’s that will rely on 
the Seattle Children’s IRB as their IRB of record. All pSITEs should be listed  even  if no study procedures will occur at 
the site. Remove the heading if this is not a study where Seattle Children’s  IRB will serve as the IRB of record  for 
other institutions.
2 Include information  if this protocol is associated  with other IRB-approved studies  (e.g. is this application the next 
part/phase of a previously  approved application.
3 In clinical trials,  an endpoint is an event or outcome that can be measured objectively to determine whether  the 
intervention being studied is beneficial. Some examples of endpoints are survival, improvements in quality of life, 
relief of symptoms, and disappearance of the tumor.  
4 Include information on a drug or biologic  in this section  if: (1) the study specifies the use of an approved  drug or 
biologic; (2) the study uses an unapproved  drug or biologic;  (3) the study uses  a food or dietary supplement to 
diagnose, cure, treat, or mitigate a disease or condition;  or (4) data regarding subjects will be submitted to or held for 
inspection by the Food and Drug Administration  (FDA).  Only  include information on a device in this section if: (1) the 
study evaluates  the safety  or effectiveness of a device;  (2) the study  uses a humanitarian use device (HUD) for 
research purposes;  or (3) data regarding  subjects  will be submitted to or held for inspection by the FDA.  Please  note 
that mobile medical  applications may meet the definition of a device – see FDA Guidance .
5 See the Investigator Manual HRP-103 for sponsor requirements for FDA-regulated research.
6 Explain what  IND exemption category applies to the drug and why.  Note  that a drug is not exempt from an IND 
unless all criteria for one category are met.  See  “HRP-306: Drugs” for more information.
7 Explain what  IDE exemption  category applies to the device and why.  Note that a device  is not exempt from an IDE 
unless all criteria for one category are met.  See  “HRP-307: Devices” for more information.
8 Explain why the device is NOT a significant risk device.   A significant risk device means an investigational  device 
that: (a) is intended  as an implant and presents a potential  for serious risk to the health,  safety,  or welfare of a 
subject; (b) is purported or represented to be for use supporting or sustaining  human life and presents a potential  for 
serious risk to the health,  safety, or welfare of a subject; (c) is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing,  
curing, mitigating, or treating  disease, or otherwise  preventing  impairment of human health and presents a potential  
for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or (d) otherwise presents  a potential for serious risk to the 
health, safety,  or welfare of a subject. 
9 Be sure to indicate  if controls will be included and include information about why control arms are ethically 
acceptable.
10 Describe all of the research procedures being  performed. Be sure to make it clear which procedures apply to each 
subject population. When applicable,  describe how research  procedures  differ  from standard of care and/or  affect  
standard of care.   Describe any audio/video recording that will be involved.

12 Include information about  the frequency of data collection.
13 See HRP-001 - SOP  – Definitions for definition of banking.  Type N/A if not applicable.  If the data is subject  to NIH 
Genomic Data  Sharing Policies (e.g. you will submit data to dbGaP, NDAR,  FITBIR), indicate here.  
14 If applicable,  include  a list of identifiers that will be banked.
15 Be general (e.g.,  researchers’  lab, clinic, etc.)
16 Generally, data and/or biospecimens  should be released in a coded, non – identifiable manner.
17 Include a description of the process  used  to verify and document that any required approvals have been obtained 
prior to release of data/biospecimens from the bank.
18 You can allow for use for broad purposes
19 This includes putting  results  and/or data in the subject  medical records.
20 If your population will differ from the representative population where the study  will take place (e.g., race, ethnic 
group, or gender), provide a rationale for the differences.
21 Seattle Children’s IRB prohibits the exclusion  of populations who use a language other than English from research 
unless there is sufficient justification for the exclusion. In most circumstances, the cost of translation and/or interpreter 
services will not be considered sufficient justification for the exclusion of  participants  who use a language other than 
English in accordance with NIH guidelines. (“Cost is not an acceptable reason for exclusion except when the study 
would duplicate data from other sources.”  59 FR 11146,  March 28, 1994). See Investigator Manual HRP-103  for 
additional information.
22 If you check a box below, be sure to include the additional  considerations associated  with the population.
23 Refer to HRP-416 CHECKLIST: Children.   
24 If the study is minimal risk, explain why. Must  also include,  as applicable: (1) why direct benefits are anticipated, (2) 
why risks are justified by anticipated benefit and/or the relationship between risk and prospective benefit compared to 
available alternatives,  (3) why risk represents  only minor increase over minimal risk, (4) how study procedures are 
reasonably commensurate  with those inherent to the child’s actual or expected conditions,  (5) whether the 
interventions/procedures are likely  to yield generalizable knowledge about the participant’s  condition and why it is of 
“vital importance”  to understanding or amelioration  of the participant’s underlying  disorder  or condition,  and (6) an 
explanation of what alternative methods/approaches were considered to make the above assessments (as 
applicable).
25 This population may be wards of the state or any other agency, institution, or entity. Refer  to HRP-416  
CHECKLIST: Children,  Section 6, for additional  guidance on required considerations for this population.
26 This refers to both cognitive  impairments and adults  who are incapacitated for any other reason.  As applicable, 
refer to HRP-417 CHECKLIST: Cognitively Impaired Adults.

32 Indicate how you will ensure  that there  is no coercion or undue influence
33 A subject is considered “enrolled” when they consent  to be in the study.
34 Only applicable for multisite studies.
35 i.e., numbers of subjects excluding screen failures.
36 Payment  for participation is not considered a benefit.
37 For example, data will be double entered,  data will be reviewed by another study  team member to ensure 
accuracy, etc.
38 If your study is multisite  and there are differences in how confidentiality will be maintained by the coordination 
center and our local site, this should be explained  in this section  (e.g. local site will have samples that are linked to a 
person’s name, but the coordination center  will only receive coded samples without any links).  Confidentiality  
regarding use of Social Media will be explained  in a protocol section below.
39 Including the signed  consent/assent/permission forms and any information/documentation  collected during  the 
consent process.
40 Privacy refers to persons and their interests  in controlling the access of others  to themselves. For example,  based 
on privacy  interests, people want to control the time and place  where they give information, the nature  of the 
information they give and who receives and can use the information.
When providing  a response, consider  the subject population and nature  of the study.   For example, persons  might  not 
want to be seen entering  a place that might stigmatize them, such as a pregnancy counseling center that is clearly 
identified as such by signs on the building.
41 Applicable for studies that present more than minimal  risk.
42 Include information about  who (describe in terms of role or group) will review the data.
43 This should be specific to the social media you are using for the research.
44 All communications that are directed towards subjects  and specific to a particular  study  will require prior IRB review 
and approval.  All non-IRB reviewable communications can be described in general  terms by category – news  stories, 
relevant publications – and representative examples of each can be provided.  
45 Applicable if the research involves  more  than minimal  risk to subjects.  If  minimal  risk, this section  is N/A.
46 If this is a multicenter  study and subjects  will be recruited  by methods not under the control  of the local site (e.g., 
call centers,  national advertisements) those  methods should also be described here.

47 If the study will enroll or seek permission from individuals  who speak  a language  other than English and 
recruitment methods will differ  for these individuals  (e.g., they will be approached by a bi-lingual person outside the 
study team), be sure your description covers these methods as well.
48 For example, subjects will be initially approached in a private room  or a letter rather  than a postcard will be sent 
when the study  name  may disclose health  information about the potential subject.
49 For example, medical records, CIS, clinical databases, other study  records. If the study  will access  PHI for 
recruitment purposes without prior authorization  from subjects, please address  this in the HIPAA  Authorization 
section below.
50 Attach copies of these documents to the Recruitment Materials section of the study SmartForm. For printed 
advertisements, attach the final copy. For online advertisements, attach the final screen shots  (including any images).  
When advertisements are taped  for broadcast,  send the final audio/video  tape to IRB@seattlechildrens.org. You may 
attach the wording of the advertisement to the SmartForm prior to taping to preclude  re-taping because of 
inappropriate wording, provided the IRB reviews the final audio/video  tape.
51 “Permission”  refers to consent  obtained from a parent  or LAR.
52Address the following in the response, as applicable: 
1.How you will ensure that subjects and/or their parent/LAR  have sufficient opportunity to discuss and 
consider whether or not to participate in the research. 
2.Speak  to the suitability of the intended consent process for the intended audience,  taking  into consideration 
the subject’s and/or parent/LAR’s age, language,  comprehension level,  and familiarity with technology  tools  
(if applicable).
3.If using an electronic process to send consent information or obtain documentation  of consent (e.g., e-
signature), identify the process to be used  to send  the consent information  (e.g.,  e-mail).
4.If using an electronic process (e.g., e-mail), describe  the procedures that ensure the electronic process 
allows subjects/parents/LARs to ask questions they may have before signing (e.g., by in-person discussions, 
telephone calls, videoconferencing). If conducting a consent conference, describe the method to be used for 
the conference (e.g., telephone call, video  conference),  specifying any programs (e.g., Zoom)  to be used. If 
applicable, indicate that the consent discussion will be audio or video recorded  and whether  recording  will 
occur within  any programs being used  (e.g., Zoom).
5. If using an electronic process, describe  how the subject  and/or parent/LAR  will navigate the consent 
materials, including whether the subject/parent/LAR  will have the ability to move backwards and forwards 
within the electronic system  and to stop and continue  at a later time.  Also indicate how long it will take. 
6.The availability of study  personnel to assist subjects  and/or their parent/LAR in using the electronic process, 
if applicable.
53 Some  study teams  are currently considering creative solutions for such  individuals; these potential solutions 
include snail mail, drive  through paperwork  for consent, and loaner device/hotspots for e-consenting.  If no alternative 
will be made  available (meaning these  individuals  cannot be enrolled), the IRB will look for a sufficient rationale for 
this exclusion.
54 For example, the consent discussion will take place in a private  room.
55 Address the following in the response, as applicable:
1.Identify  the means of documenting consent/assent/permission (e.g., in writing, verbally, etc.). If obtaining an 
electronic signature, identify the specific software/application to be used. 
2.Include a description of how the consent/assent form(s) will be delivered, including any programs (e.g. 
REDCap) to be used. 
3.Include a list of any information about the individual  that will be collected during the 
assent/consent/permission process.

4.If the research is conducted outside of Washington  State, provide confirmation that the electronic 
documentation of consent is legally effective in that jurisdiction. Note,  the study  team’s location while 
conducting the study dictates the jurisdiction. For single IRB studies,  the participating site’s study  team 
location while conducting the study dictates the jurisdiction.
56 Electronic  signature in this context refers  to a legally effective electronic signature (e.g., a signature  obtained  via 
DocuSign) and does not apply to procedures where a waiver  of documentation  of consent is requested.
57 Indicate “N/A”  if not obtaining an electronic  signature. Researchers are encouraged to consider the risks and 
benefits of the research when determining whether it is necessary to verify the subject/parent/LAR identity. For 
example, consider how likely  it is that someone other  than the subject would  provide the consent.  Social behavioral 
minimal risk research will not typically warrant identity verification.   
58 For example, consent forms will be downloaded  as soon as they are full executed  and saved electronically in a 
location accessible to the study team.
59 This section describes  the ways in which the procedures will not follow Seattle Children’s  SOP.
60 See “HRP-411:  Waiver  or Written  Documentation of Informed  Consent” for further  information.
61 An information sheet template (HRP-502D) can be found in the Click IRB Library and should be attached to the 
consent form of the study SmartForm.  For internet  research, the information  sheet can be translated to an on-line 
format, if desired.
62 The IRB sometimes requires a script if you are having  the consent conversation over the phone  rather  than in 
person.  Templates  for a consent script are available  on the IRB website on the Participant Recruitment page and 
should be attached to the study  SmartForm.
63 This section describes  the way(s) in which the processes for this study will not follow Seattle Children’s SOP.
64 Note the Short Form Consent  may only be used when  certain conditions are met.  See HRP-091 for requirements  
for Short Form consent  form use.
65 For research conducted in the state,  review  “SOP: Legally  Authorized Representatives, Children, and Guardians  
(HRP-013)” to be aware of which individuals in the state meet  the definition of “children.”  The age of majority in 
Washington is 18; however,  sometimes younger children  have ability to consent for certain types  of care (e.g. sexual 
reproduction/health; mental health; drug/alcohol treatment).  For research conducted outside  of the state, provide 
information that describes  which persons have  not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures 
involved the research,  under  the applicable  law of the jurisdiction in which  research  will be conducted. One method of 
obtaining this information is to have a legal counsel or authority review your protocol  along the definition of “children”  
in “SOP: Legally Authorized Representatives,  Children, and Guardians (HRP-013).”   If the sites in other states in the 
study are conducting their own IRB review,  you do not need to worry about this--type  N/A.  If you are conducting  
research and are actively recruiting participants outside of Washington who are NOT coming to SCH  to give consent  
and who will be covered under SCH IRB approval, this section should be addressed in your protocol.
66 For minimal  risk studies and greater than minimal risk studies that offer a prospect  of benefit, the IRB generally  
requires one parent  to provide permission  for the child to participate.
67 If parental  permission  will not be obtained, please address  this in the Waiver  or Alteration of Consent Process 
below.
68 See HRP-013 for more information.
69 The IRB generally follows the following  guidelines for written assent: children  7-12 should provide written assent  on 
the “simple” assent form (HRP-502G); children 13-17 should provide written assent  by co-signing the parental  
permission form (HRP-502A).  The IRB will consider other assent scenarios (e.g. verbal assent for some or all

children; not requiring  assent for some or all children; or waiving assent):  please  provide  details  about the plan for 
your study.   See HRP-090 and HRP-416 for more information on waiving assent  and when assent is not necessary.
70 See Appendix  A-13  of the Investigator Manual  HRP-103 for requirements for re-consent at age 18.  If you think  you 
meet the conditions for a waiver at 18, please  address this in the Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process below.
71 See “HRP-417 Cognitively Impaired Adults” for further information.  
72 For example: durable power  of attorney for health  care, court appointed guardian for health care decisions, spouse, 
and adult child.  If you are following  HRP-013  in order  to make this determination, simply state that in this section. For 
research conducted  in the state, review “SOP: Legally Authorized Representatives, Children, and Guardians  (HRP-
013)” to be aware of which individuals in the state meet  the definition of “legally authorized representative.” For 
research conducted  outside  of the state, provide information that describes which individuals are authorized under 
applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective subject  to their participation in the procedure(s)  involved in this 
research. One method of obtaining this information is to have a legal  counsel or authority review your protocol  along 
the definition  of “legally authorized representative” in “SOP: Legally Authorized Representatives,  Children, and 
Guardians (HRP-013).”  If the sites in other states  in the study are conducting their own IRB review, you do not need 
to worry about this--type N/A.  If you are conducting research  and are actively recruiting participants  outside of 
Washington who are NOT coming to Washington  to give consent  and who will be covered under SCH  IRB approval,  
this section should be addressed in your protocol.
73 The IRB may allow the person obtaining assent to document  assent on the consent document.
74 Provide justifications/explanations for each subject population for which a waiver/alteration is being requested.  
75 For example: consent/parental permission will not be obtained, required information will not be disclosed,  the 
research involves deception,  waiver for participants who turn 18, waiver for information collected about a non-present 
parent, or other waivers as necessary.
76 The IRB needs to make all the waiver findings and key to this determination is that the IRB understand why it is not 
practicable to do the research without  a waiver of consent.  You need to provide a rationale in order for the IRB to 
consider whether the waiver  criteria are met. See “HRP-410: Waiver or Alteration of the Consent Process” for further  
information.  
77 Possible reasons might  include: a) you are not collecting information that could  put subjects or their families at 
harm, e.g., affect eligibility for insurance,  employability, stigmatization; b) you are not collecting  information that would  
alter or affect the subject’s  care;  c) any publication  or presentation of research results would  be done in a manner that 
would never reveal an individual’s identity  either directly or indirectly.
78 Possible reasons could be: a) inability to locate  families because of the lengthy time period  over which  the 
records/samples were created; b) many of the subjects  whose  records, data, or biospecimens will be used may have 
died and contacting  the families  about the research could  cause harm and anguish to families; c) all eligible  patients  
must be included in the study for the results  to be meaningful.
79 For example, identifiers  are necessary, so that researchers can perform quality  checks or identifiers are necessary  
to link data from multiple sources.
80 See “HRP 419: Waiver of Consent for Emergency  Research” for further information.
81 PHI is health  information that is also identifiable because  it includes one or more  of the 18 HIPAA identifiers.   See 
Investigator Manual HRP-103 for the list of HIPAA identifiers.  
82 If your study involves using or creating PHI and your only contact  with participants  is online, you can request  an 
alteration of HIPAA authorization to remove the signature requirement.  As  an alternative to a waiver of

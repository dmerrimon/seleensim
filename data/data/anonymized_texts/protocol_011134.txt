When the MTD is reached, 4

the MTD in an expansion cohort.  
Target  enrollment : 6-32 patients  
 
This is  a single -cohort  phase lb study, with a  3+3 dose -escalation  design, to  establish the maximum 
tolerated dose  (MTD) of  combined  MAPK  and PI3K pathway inhibition  with vemurafenib  (BRAF 
inhibitor) and  copanlisib  (pan-Pl3K  inhibitor)  in patients with  advanced radioiodine -refractory  (RAIR) 
BRAFV600  mutant  thyroid  carcinoma.  Once  the MTD for the combination is  established,  4 
additional  patients will be  enrolled  in an expansion  cohort at the  identified  MTD  (to ensure  that a 
total of 10 patients are treated at the MTD).  
The goal of  this study is  to determine  a safe dosage  of vemurafenib  plus copanlisib  that effectively 
redifferentiates RAIR tumors such  that they become  susceptible  to radioiodine  (RAI) therapy and  Disease  monitoring:

enhances retention. Following pretreatment 1 -124 PET/CT  assessment,  vemurafenib  alone will  be 
given for about 1  week followed by  the combination of  vemurafenib  plus copanlisib. During this 
period, patients will  be assessed  with 1-124 PET/CT  to establish whether they meet  the dosimetry 
requirements  to warrant  treatment  with RAI (1-131). Patients  who meet  the dosimetry  requirements 
will be treated with  1-131. Those  who do not will have  study drug  discontinued and  removed from 
study.  
The primary objective of this study  is to establish the  MTD for vemurafenib  plus copanlisib. 
Secondary objectives  include assessin g the proportion  of patients  who meet  the criteria  for 1-131 
therapy,  evaluating  the effect  of vemurafenib  plus copanlisib  on RAI uptake  and retention on  serial  1- 
124 PET/CT  scans,  and determining  the overall response rate  (ORR;  per RECIST v1 .1 [response 
evaluation  criteria in  solid  tumors  version 1.1]) and  progression -free survival (PFS)  at 6 months  after 
combination vemurafenib plus copanlisib  and 1-131 therapy.  
Pre- and on-treatment  biopsies will  be performed to assess  changes  in tumoral  gene expression; 
these  findings  will be correlated  with changes observed  in RAI uptake quantified  on 1-124 PET 
scans.

3.0 BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
3.1 RAIR  differentiated  thyroid  cancers  (DTCs)  
The majority  of thyroid cancers are differentiated carcinomas  of follicular origin, with  papillary thyroid 
cancer {PTC)  the most  common,  followed by  follicular  thyroid cancer. rvletastatic  disease  represents 
the most frequent cause of thyroid cancer -related death,1 and RAI (1 -131) remains a mainstay of 
therapy. RAI is selectively concentrated in thyroid tumors, making it an effective therapy, with 
manageable side effects. However, many patients with metastatic tumors do not have, or lose, the 
ability to  trap iodine;  this is  designated as  RAIR disease. RAIR metastatic  DTCs  are incurable, with  a 
10-year overall survival of only 10% .1 
Standard  therapy  for RAIR  DTCs  includes the  multitargeted tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors {TKls)  lenvatinib 
and sorafenib.2•3 SELECT, a randomized phase Ill trial evaluating lenvatinib (Eisai) compared with 
placebo, met its primary PFS endpoint (median PFS, 18.3 months [lenvatinib]  versus 3.6 months 
[placebo];  hazard  ratio,  0.23 [95%  Cl, 0.14-0.31];  p<0.0001),  leading to  FDA approval.2 Unfortunately, 
toxicity remains a significant issue, with a 76% rate of grade  3 treatment -related toxicity in the 
lenvatinib  group, compared with 9.9% in the placebo group . Treatment  that can  restore  the capacity 
of RAIR  tumors  to trap and  respond  to a single administration  of 1-131 ("redifferentiation") without the 
need for maintenance  drug therapy  could replace or defer the need for TKls . Last,  a survival benefit 
of TKls in  patients  with RAIR  thyroid cancer  has yet to be  demonstrated.  
3.2 Inhibition of aberrant mitogen -activated protein kinase  (MAPK) signaling partially 
redifferentiates  RAIR thyroid  cancers and  restores RAI avidity  
Approximately  70% of PTCs  possess  mutually  exclusive  oncogenic  mutations  in the rv1APK  pathway,4 
the most comm on of which is BRAFv600E, which has been shown to be a factor of poor prognosis.5 
Constitutive  rv1APK  pathway  activation  promotes  RAI refractoriness  by suppressing  the expression  of 
genes that mediate iodide uptake and thyroid hormone biosynthesis, such  as the Na+n - symporter, 
thyroid peroxidase, and  thyroglobulin.6,7 Using genetically engineered mouse  models  of BRAFmutant 
thyroid  cancer,  we previously  demonstrated  that f'v1APK  pathway  inhibition restores  the expression  of 
these genes to enhance tumor RAI avidity.6,7 
We subsequently  translated this concept  to the clinic, demonstrating in a proof -of-concept  study that 
the allosteric MEK 1/2 inhibitor selumetinib (AstraZene ca) can restore RAI avidity and efficacy in 
patients with RAIR disease (Figure  1).8 A critical  feature of this study was the use of 1 -124 PET/CT 
scans  to precisely  quantify  drug-induced  changes  in iodine  incorporation  within  specific  lesions  
("lesional  dosimetry").19•20 This technique  provides  a substantial  advantage over  traditional whole -body 
radioactive iodine scintigraphy, which does not provide correlative anatomic localization for iodine 
uptake, is less sensitive for detecting iodine -avid metastases,21 and is only loosely quantitative 
(visually similar  lesions can  represent as much as a 3 -log range of radiation dosages).  Using 1 -124 
PET, we can  transform the 1 -124 quantification into the predicted 1 -131 radiation dosage delivered 
within every individual  tumor  within a  patient's  body. Each  of the 20 evaluable  patients i n the study 
had RAIR  disease,  defined  as having  one of the following  criteria:  (1) non-RAl-avid lesion/s  on

disease underwent 1 -124 PET/CT scans after stimulation with recombinant thyroid -stimulating 
hormone  (TSH), before  and after  receiving  a 4-week  course  of selumetinib (75 mg  BID twice  a day). 
If the second  1-124 PET scan  predicted that a  lesional RAI dose of  2,000 cGy  could  be achieved, 1 - 
131 was  administered while patients continued  to receive selumetinib. Of  the 20 evaluable  patients, 
12 (60%) had new or increased 1 -124 incorporation after selumetinib (Figure 1A -C). For 8 patients 
(40%),  the second  1-124 PET  scan  predicted that the  lesional absorbed radiation dose  would exceed 
2,000 cGy; these patients continued to receive sel umetinib and went on to  receive therapeutic  RAI. 
Reduction  in tumor size,  by RECIST, was  achieved in  all patients, with  5 confirmed partial  responses; 
3 patients  had stable  disease  (Figure  1D). Substantial decreases  in serum  thyroglobulin  (Tg) following 
RAI therapy were  achieved in all 8  patients . These  results were  reported  in the New England  Journal 
of Medicine.  18 
However,  in the selumetinib study, only 1  of 9 patients with  BRAFv600E responded to  MEK 1/2  inhibitor 
treatment.8 We hypothesized  that to  improve  outcomes  in the BRAFmutant group  would  require more­ 
potent inhibition of MAPK signaling than what could be achieved with MEK inhibition alone. 
Vemurafenib is an ATP -competitive BRAF inhibitor that abro gates monomeric BRAFv6ooE signaling 
and paradoxically  activates  BRAF  wild-type dimers  in normal cells,22 resulting  in a wide  therapeutic  
 
 
window that facilitates robust MAPK inhibition in the tumor cells . We subsequently studied 
vemurafenib in a 10 -patient pilot study of BRAF mutant RAIR OTC. Six of the 10 patients had 
increased  iodine  avidity,  as quantified on  1-124 PET/CT -4 of whom  met the criteria  for treatment with

analysis of sequential biopsy specimens from 3  patients  showed  that successful  inhibition of the 1 \/lAPK 
pathway with vemurafenib led to induction of thyroid -specific gene expression , which we predicted 
would mediate RAI uptake .10 These exc iting results, derived from patient samples, validated the 
biologic  principles first demonstrated in our mouse  models.  
3.3 Preclinical  data  supporting  the use of combined  MAPK  and Pl3K  pathway  inhibition 
to enhance RAI uptake and retention  
The effectiveness  of 1-131 is governed  by the degree  to which  thyroid tumors  can absorb  (uptake) and 
retain  (retention)  RAI. In  our BRAFmutant  mouse  models,  we observed  that, although  1\/lAPK  inhibition 
enhanced  RAI uptake, deficient  iodide retention was  not changed.  Exposure  to BRAF  inhibition led  to 
increased AKT phosphorylation, suggesting that activated Pl3K signaling contributes to the 
suppression of genes involved in iodide  retention. Using our BRAF mutant thyroid cancer mouse 
model, we investigated the effect of the pan class I PI3K inhibitor GDC -0941 (Genentech) in 
combination  with the  BRAF/MEK inhibitor  CH5126766 (Chugai) on  iodide uptake and  retention . After 
8 days of th erapy, both iodide uptake and retention were enhanced with combination therapy, with 
retention enhanced to  levels approximating  what is observed in normal thyroid glands  (Figure  2A). 
On histopathologic examination, the combination resulted in a  significant reorganization of tumor 
cytologic  architecture,  including  the creation  of large  colloid -filled  follicles.  These  are thyroid  hormone­ 
producing  mechanical  subunits  in normal  thyroid glands that  take up elemental  iodide and  catalyze  its 
covalent  bonding  to the protein  thyroglobulin  (a process  known  as "iodine  organification")  (Figure  2B). 
The physiologic and histopathologic  changes observed  in this thyroid  cancer  mouse  model  correlated 
with dramatic restoration of expression of dual oxidase 1 and 2  (DUOX1 , DUOX2),  thyroid -specific 
genes  that catalyze  a critical  step in iodine  organification  and that are key mediators  of iodine  retention . 
In animals treated with 1 -131 concurrently  with combination  targeted  drug therapy,  higher  levels  of 
 
RAl-bound thyroglobulin,  which  is a surrogate marker  for greater RAI  retention, were  observed within 
the tumors.  Taken  together, these  results  strongly suggest  that adding  pan-Pl3K inhibition to  1\/lAPK 
pathway targeting restores  both RAI uptake and  retention by  promoting the  creation  of normal  thyroid 
follicles that facilitate iodine organification within the  tumor,  translating to  a greater  concentration and 
residence  time of the  1-131 radiation  dose  to the tumor,  which  would  be predicted to result  in greater 
antitumor efficacy . 
3.4 BRAF  inhibition  in DTC 
 
BRAFv600E mutant thyroid cancers  are associated  with a more  aggressive course  and increased 
cancer -related  mortality, compared with non-BRAF mutant PTCs.11•12 Targeting BRAF  in these  
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center

patients  has been shown  to have clinically  meaningful activity. In a  phase  II study  of vemurafenib in 
patients  with BRAFV600E  mutant PTC,  the response  rate was 39% in the untreated  cohort and 
27% in the cohort previously exposed to  multitargeted VEGF TKls.13 
Whereas the  addition  of MEK inhibition  has been  shown  to improve  outcomes  in other cancers,  such 
as BRAFmutant melanoma14•15 and anaplastic thyroid  carcinoma,16the same  has not yet been 
demonstrated for BRAF  mutant PTC.  In a randomized phase II trial of  dabrafenib  versus  dabrafenib 
plus trametinib in patients  with BRAF  mutant PTC,  objective  response rates were  largely  similar 
(45% with dabrafenib,  38% with dabrafenib plus trametinib) .17 In addition,  median PFS  was not 
statistically different  (11.4 months  for dabrafenib versus 15.1  months for  dabrafenib plus trametinib), 
nor was median duration of  response (15.7 months  for dabrafenib  versus  13.3 months  for dabrafenib 
plus trametinib).17  
Given the lack  of compelling clinical  data supporting enhanced efficacy of combined  BRAF/MEK 
inhibition  and the  potential  for increased  toxicity w hen drugs  inhibiting  both pathways are 
administered,  the present  study  is limited to  targeting BRAF alone with  vemurafenib  plus copanlisib . 
Furthermore, the  data from  our 10 -person pilot study of vemurafenib for redifferentiation  of BRAF 
mutant RAIR thyroid cancer  will serve as  a useful comparator  to evaluate  the contribution of 
copanlisib for this purpose.  
 
3.5 Clinical  experience  with combined  MAPK and  Pl3K  inhibition  
 
Previous studies attempting to combine  MAPK  and Pl3K pathway inhibitors  reported variable 
tolerability,  including 2  trials that  failed to identify an  MTD with a  continuous dosing  schedule (MEK 
inhibitor trametinib plus AKT inhibitor afuresertib24 and vemurafenib plus pan -Pl3K inhibitor 
BKM12025) and 1 that successfully established an MTD but  still identified  issues  with long-term 
tolerability  (trametinib plus pan -Pl3K inhibitor bup arlisib26). A phase  I trial  combining vemurafenib 
with the pan-Pl3K  inhibitor PX -866 successfully  identified an  MTD for  the combination (vemurafenib 
720 mg  BID plus PX -866 8 mg daily).27 The most  common  all-grade treatment -related  adverse 
events observed  included  gastrointestinal  toxicities  (nausea,  diarrhea, vomiting), arthralgia,  fatigue, 
and skin  adverse events (rash  and photosensitivity).  Evaluation of 4  dose  levels identified  2 dose­ 
limiting toxicities (DLTs) : grade 3  rash and grade 3  pancreatitis. Other grade .::3  treatment -related 
adverse -events included lipase elevation and  liver function  test abnormalities  (AST/ALT  elevation). 
The additional  advantage  of developing  a MAPK  plus Pl3K pathway inhibitor combination for tumor 
redifferentiation is  that only a  limited, discrete period of  drug therapy  would need  to be applied  (~16 
days without dose  interruptions),  increasing the likelihood  of identifying  therapeutic  doses  that are 
effective and tolerable . 
 
Vemurafenib  is FDA approved  for the  treatment of unresectable or  metastatic  melanoma  with BRAF 
V600E mutation and for Erdheim -Chester  disease with BRAFV600  mutation. Vemurafenib  is also 
National  Comprehensive Cancer  Network (NCCN) Compendium -approved for BRAF -positive  OTC. 
Copanlisib is  FDA approved for  the treatment of  patients with relapsed  follicular lymphoma who  have 
had at least 2 prior systemic therapies.  
 
We will likely be able  to establish a  safe and effective dose/schedule for combination vemurafenib 
and copanlisib  administered for  only slightly more  than 2 weeks in  total (~16  days).  We hypothesize  
that vemurafenib  (BRAF  inhibitor)  plus copan/isib (P/3K inhibitor) can  be safely administered to 
restore  RA/ uptake  and retention,  thus vvarranting  therapy  Vvith 1 -131, in patients  Vvith  RAIR  thyroid 
cancer.

4.0 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
4.1 Design  
This is a phase  lb trial that will follow  a 3+3 dose -escalation  design,  as detailed  in Section 9.2.  The 
primary  objective  of this study  is to determine  the MTD  of vemurafenib  plus copanlisib . When the 
MTD  is reached,  4 additional  patients  will be enrolled  at the MTD.  Patients  for whom  vemurafenib 
plus copanlisib  enhances  RAI avidity  (as measured on serial  1-124 PET/CT scans) beyond  the 
lesional  dosimetry  threshold  specified  in the  protocol  will receive  Thyrogen -stimulated  1-131 therapy . 
Secondary objectives  include determining the  proportion  of patients in whom the  combination of 
vemurafenib plus  copanlisib  increases  tumoral  iodine incorporation (calculated  for patients treated at 
the MTD and all dose  levels) . Tumor uptake and  retention of iodine will  be evaluated . For patients 
treated with  1-131, the efficacy of  the therapy  will be evaluated  by assessing the  ORR  (by RECIST 
v1.1) and  the proportion  of patients  alive and  without  disease  progression  at 6 months after 
treatment with  vemurafenib plus copanlisib and 1 -131. 
As an exploratory objective, we  will perform  sequential pre - and on-treatment biopsies to  analyze the 
changes in  tumoral  gene expression induced by vemurafenib plus copanlisib, as well  as the  putative 
associations of  genetic  alterations in the  tumor that may  portend  successful  redifferentiation  with the 
experimental combination . We will also  collect data about time  for patie nts to initiate new thyroid 
cancer  treatment and radiographic  progression after study treatment.  
4.2 Intervention  
Eligible patients  with BRAF  mutant RAIR thyroid cancer will  undergo recombinant human TSH 
(Thyrogen; Genzyme  Corporation,  Cambridge,  MA)-stimulated 1 -124 PET/CT  lesion  dosimetry  (total 
of 4 1-124 PET/CT  scans  will be performed during this process)  to quantify baseline RAI avidity in 
index metastatic lesion(s).  
Patients  will then receive  vemurafenib  alone  for approximately  7 days, followed  by the addition  of 
copanlisib  at the designated  dose  levels  (see Table 9 -1). A second on -treatment  Thyrogen - 
stimulated  1-124 PET/CT  lesional  dosimetry analysis  will be performed  to assess for  changes  in 1- 
124 uptake and  retention.  If lesional dosimetry  with the second  1-124 PET/CT  scan  (at ~48 h {~2 
days)  after delivery  of 1-124) reveals that a  dose  of .::2000 cGy  can be delivered  to at least 1  tumor 
with :s;300  mCi of 1-131, then the Principal  Investigator  (Pl) and  treating physician(s)  will decide 
whether  1-131 therapy  should  proceed  for that patient.  For eligible  patients,  therapeutic  1-131 will be 
administered concurrently with  vemurafenib and copanlisib. The  study medication will  then be 
discontinued,  and tumor assessments will  be conducted by serial radiologic  scan(s)  and serum 
thyroglobulin  tests  (scans  will be performed  at baseline, before  1-131, 3-4 months  after 1 -131, and  6 
months  after 1 -131).  For patients  whose  tumors do  not demonstrate sufficient iodine incorporation, 
the study medication will  be discontinued, a  final imaging assessment will  be performed, and the 
patient will be  removed from the  study. Without dose  interruption,  this schedule would involve 
treating patients with vemurafenib for approximately 20  days;  copanlisib will  be administered once  a 
week, for a total of 2 doses.  
If there is  evidence of disease  progression before completing treatment with  vemurafenib  and 
copanlisi b, study  treatment  with these  drugs  and 1-131 will be allowed to  continue  if the treating 
physician deems that such  a decision is clinically justifiable .

5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC  AGENTS  
5.1 Therapeutic  agent  copanlisib  
 
The Pl3K/AKT/mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is  one of the most  prominent 
pathways that promote cellular survival and is constitutively activated in many  types of  cancers.21 
Class  I Pl3K is  downstream of most  cancer -associated  tyrosine  kinase growth factor receptors (such 
as epidermal growth factor receptor/human  epidermal growth factor receptor, insulin -like growth 
factor 1  receptor, platelet -derived growth factor  receptor, vascular endothelial  growth factor, and c­ 
KIT or mesenchymal epithelial  transition factor).  
Four of these  Pl3K isoforms (Pl3Ka, Pl3Kf3, Pl3Ky, and Pl3Ko) are categorized as  class  I enzymes 
because they can  use phosphatidylinositol -4,5-bisphosphate  (Pl-4,5-P2) as a substrate to  generate 
phosphatidylinositol -3,4,5 -trisphosphate  (PIP3) . Elevated  PIP3  in cellular  membranes  drives  several 
hallmarks of  the cancer  phenotype:  cell proliferation, survival, metabolic reprogramming,  and 
migration.  PI3Ka and f3 are ubiquit ous; PI3Ky  and o are expressed  mostly  in hematopoietic  tissues . 
As expected from its pharmacological  properties, copanlisib,  a small  molecule pan -class 1 Pl3K 
inhibitor with predominant activity against Pl3Ka and Pl3Ko isoforms,  demonstrated antitumor 
activity  in preclinical models,  characterized  by activating genetic aberrations  of the Pl3K pathway.  
Copanlisib exhibits a  potent kinase  inhibitory  effect  on all 4 isoforms,  with biochemical  ICso (the  half 
maximal  inhibitor  concentration) values of  0.5 nM, 0 .7 nM, 3 .7 nM, and 6.4  nM for Pl3Ka, Pl3Ko, 
Pl3Kf3,  and Pl3Ky, respectively. Copanlisib also  potent ly regulates nuclear localization of the 
forkhead family members,  resulting  in the  induction of transcriptional  programs  that lead  to rapid  cell 
death by  apoptosis. For additional  background information,  please  refer to the  Investigator's 
Brochure.  
Copanlisib is  supplied as a  lyophilized preparation  in a 6-ml injection vial. The  total amount of 
copanlisib  (BAY 80 -6946) per vial  is 60 mg. The solution  for intravenous  (IV) infusion is  obtained 
after reconstitution of  the lyophilisate  with 0.9% sodium chloride solution.  
Please  refer  to the  Pharmacy  Instructions for detailed  instructions  for the reconstitution  of the 
lyophilisate  and for further dilution of the  reconstituted solution.  
Copanlisib  is administered in  a normal  saline  solution  IV during the  course  of 1 h. No IV glucose 
preparations  should be  administered on the days of infusion.  
For continuous use  (as in follicular  lymphoma),  dosing is  weekly for the  first 3 weeks of  a 28-day 
cycle (on  days 1,  8, and 15), followed by a  1-week break (i.e., no  infusion on day 22).  
Copanlisib  will be supplied  by Bayer  (Bayer  AG; Leverkusen,  Germany).  
5.2 Therapeutic  agent  vemurafenib  
Vemurafenib  is a low-molecular -weight  orally available  inhibitor  of the activated form of  the BRAF 
serine -threonine kinase enzyme, which is  commonly  found in thyroid cancer. Vemurafenib 
selectively inhibits  oncogenic  BRAF kinase. The rationale for  identifying  such  a compound  was first 
provided  in 2002, when  the high prevalence of  activating mutations  in the BRAF  gene was  identified 
in a variety of cancers.  The high level of selectivity of vemurafenib has been demonstrated in  
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center 
IRB Number: 20 -053 A(4)  
Approval  date: 09-Nov-2021   
biochemical,  cell-based, and  in vivo assay s. The dose  of vemurafenib,  960 mg  BID, was  identified  in 
the phase I  dose -finding  study  PLX 06-02 and is established as  the recommended  dosage  for phase 
II and Ill trials. Commercial supply of vemurafenib  will be  used for this trial.  
5.3 Diagnostic  agentthyrotropin  a (Thyrogen;  Genzyme)  
Patients will undergo  1-124 PET/CT  scanning  after 2  consecutive  daily  injections of  thyrotropin  a 
(Thyrogen;  Genzyme,  Cambridge,  rv1A,  USA)  at 0.9 mg intramuscularly,  as previously  described .37 
Thyrogen contains a  highly purified  recombinant form of  human  TSH and  is FDA  approved  for 
thyroid dosimetry.  
5.4 Therapeutic  agent  1-131 (RAI)  
 
Oral 1-131 (RAI)  will be used  for treatment  of patients whose  second  lesional dosimetry 1 -124 
PET/CT  scan  reveals  iodine  incorporation  that satisfies  the threshold  for RAI (1-131) treatment.  1-131 
has a  half-life of 8  days and a  relatively  high principal photon energy of 364  keV, characterized  by 
beta particle emissions . It is administered orally  in the form  of capsules or liquid.  Pregnancy is the 
only contraindication  to 1-131 treatment.  A serum  beta-HCG pregnancy  test must  be performed  up to 
2 days before the  administration  of 1-131 (for woman  of child -bearing potential).  Commercial  supply 
of 1-131 will be used for this trial.  
5.5 Diagnostic  agent  1-124 PET tracer  
Clinical -grade  1-124 was  first produced  at 1\/lemorial  Sloan Kettering Cancer  Center  (MSK)  in the 
1950s . It has been produced in MSK cyclotrons by  bombarding tellurium targets. It is  purified  using 
novel radiochemical techniques. For  this study,  clinical -grade 1 -124 will be  provided by outside 
suppliers  (e.g. Sofie  Biosciences  [Dulles,  VA, USA; formerly  known as  IBA 1\/blecular  North America 
and Zevacor  Pharma];  3D Imaging [Little Rock,  AR, USA]) who  meet MSK's minimum specifications 
as stated  in the MSK -held investigational  new drug (IND;  IND#  71343).  1-124 will be given orally as  a 
capsule  or liquid . The normal  organ dosimetry  of 1-124 is provided  in Appendix A

7.0 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
Potential research  subjects will be  identified  by a member  of the patient's  treatment team, the 
protocol investigator,  or research  team. Patient recruitment most  likely will occur  in the medical 
oncology  and endocrinology  clinics of the Head and  Neck Disease  management team.  If the 
investigator  is a member  of the treatment team,  s/he will screen  their patient's medical  records  for 
suitable research  study participants and discuss the  study and their potential  for enrolling  in the 
research  study. Potential  subjects contacted  by their treating physician will  be referred to  the 
investigator/research s taff of  the study . Investigators  will discuss  the study and review/sign the 
informed consent documents with the patient.  
During  the initial  conversation between the  investigator/research  staff and the patient, the  patient  may 
be asked to  provide certain  health information  that is  necessary  to the recruitment and enrollment 
process.  The investigator/research staff may also review portions  of their medical records  in order to 
further assess  eligibility.  They  will use the information  provided  by the patient  and/or  medical  record 
to confirm  that the patient is  eligible  and to  contact  the patient regarding  study  enrollment.  If the 
patient turns out  to be  ineligible  for the research  study, the research  staff will  destroy  all information  
collected  on the patient  during  the initial  conversation  and medical  records  review.  
 
 
8.0 PRETREATMENT  EVALUATION  
To be performed any  time before  the start of study  medication :

9.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  PLAN  
 
9.1 Schedule  of events  (for all patients  initiating  treatment)  
The week and  day designations  below  may be subject to  change if disruption in the  evaluation  or 
treatment  schedule occurs.  If there is  a disruption to  the schedule of events (including but  not limited 
to a dose  hold, inability  to schedule  appointments  or procedures, or failure  to comply  with a  low­ 
iodine diet), making up or rescheduling some  or all of  the study assessments or  treatments may be 
considered after discussion  with the Principal Investigator  (this is  not a requirement).

• As detailed in  the calendars included in Section  10, protocol procedures are subdivided into 3 
consecutive study  periods: (1)  the pretreatment  1-124 PET/CT lesional dosimetry process  (the 
days/scheduling during  this period  are designated  as "Daypre -tx [Dpre -tx]"); followed  by (2) on­ 
treatment  procedures  during  study drug  treatment (designated  as "Daytx  [Dtx]"), which  is the MTD 
period; and ending with  (3) posttreatment assessments . The protocol  procedures listed  above will 
be taking  place simultaneously with the dose  escalation.  
 
• After providing  signed  informed consent, patients will be  required to  perform a  pretreatment 
biopsy  (before starting  vemurafenib and  copanlisib),  unless  the patient is  exempt as  defined  in 
Section 6.1.  
 
 
1)  Pretreatment  Thyrogen -stimulated  1-124 PET/CT  lesional  dosimetry  {Dore -txl 
 
Thyrogen -stimulated  1-124 PET/CT  lesional  dosimetry  will be performed  to establish  baseline iodine 
avidity  (for details of 1 -124 PET/CT  acquisition,  analysis, and interpretation,  please see  Appendix 
B). 
o Patients  will adhere  to a low-iodine diet (Appendix  C) beginning  preferably 7  days  before  the 
initiation  of the lesional dosimetry  process (but minimally 5 days prior).  
o Blood  draw(s)  for TSH,  free T4, thyroglobulin,  and thyroglobulin  antibody  will be collected  on Dpre­ 
tx 1 (before  Thyrogen  injection)  and Dpre -tx 3. TSH,  thyroglobulin,  and thyroglobulin  antibody  will be 
collected on Dpre -tx 5. 
o Thyrogen  injections  (0.9 mg) will be administered  intramuscularly  on Dpre -ix 1 and 2. 
o 1-124 (approximately  6 mCi (4-7 mCi))  will be  administered  orally  on Dpre -tx 3. 
o 1-124 PET/CT will be  performed  on Dpre -ix 4 (~24 h), Dpre -tx 5 (~48  h), Dpre -ix 6 (~72 h), and Dpre -ix 8 
(~120  h) (hour designations  are approximations of  the interval  from the time  that the 1 -124 is  
orally  administered, not specific  hours at  which  the scans  must  be done). The low  iodine diet can 
be discontinued  after the last  1-124 PET/CT  scan . Note:  If no iodine uptake is  detected on the  
PET/CT  scan  done on Dpre -tx 5 (~48 h after  delivery  of 1-124), the subsequent  PET/CT scans 
(e.g., at  ~72, and ~120 h  after delivery  of 1-124) will not be  performed.  
o See Table  10-1 for the baseline  (pretreatment)  1-124 PET/CT  schedule  and requirements.  
 
2)  On-treatment  procedures (D! l!. ) (see Figure  3 below)  
 
• The initiation  of study  drugs  (Dix 1)  will be scheduled  to ensure  an interval  of at least  approximately 
4 weeks  between the delivery  of 1-124 tracer during  the pretreatment  1-124 PET/CT and the on­ 
treatment 1 -124 PET/CT (to ensure sufficient  elimination  of the first 1 -124 tracer  during  the 
pretreatment  Thyrogen -stimulated  1-124 PET/CT  lesional  dosimetry  process).  If the first 1-124 
PET/CT  lesional  dosimetry  scan  does  not demonstrate any  significant uptake, starting  vemurafenib 
plus copanlisib earlier may be considered . 
• On Dtx 1, patients  will initiate  vemurafenib  at the dose  determined  by the dose  escalation  rules  in 
Section  9.2. For ease  of scheduling,  if possible,  Dix1  should  be scheduled  for a fv1onday . 
• On Dtx8 (+/ -1 day) and Day 15  (+/-1 day), patients  will receive the  copanlisib infusions per the 
dose escalation rules in Section 9.2.  
o For guidance about  meal  times  and glucose  monitoring,  please  see the respective  Sections  9.3 
and 9.4 and the table  of events  in Section  10 (below) . All patients  must  be fasting  for a 
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center 
IRB Number: 20 -053 A(4)  
Approval  date: 09-Nov-2021   
minimum of  8 h before  the first infusion  of copanlisib.  For patients with diabetes,  consider 
holding insulin and sulfonylureas  on the morning  of the fast to avoid hypoglycemia . Fasting  for 4 
h or more before  the second  infusion of copanlisib  should be considered.  
o Pre-treatment  glucose  levels  must  be <160 mg/dl  prior to  infusions if  fasting,  or random 
glucose of <200 mg/dl if not fasting.  
o Blood  glucose  will be measured  approximately  1 hour after completion  of infusion  and 
subsequently  if clinically  indicated,  at the discretion  of the investigator.  
o Low glycemic index meals should  be eaten for approximately  48 hours after  copanlisib  infusion. 
For further guidance about  mealtimes and glucose  monitoring,  please see Sections  9.3 and 9.4 
and the table of events  in Section 10 below . 
o Please  refer to Table  11-13 and consider  consultation  with an endocrinologist  for management  
of hyperglycemia.  
o  Blood pressure will  be measured approximately  every 5 -10 minutes prior to each copanlisib 
dose until 2  consecutive results <150/90 mmHg  are recorded. If blood pressure is  150/90 
mmHg,  the investigator  can consider  a medical  intervention  or can  delay infusion of  the study 
drug. The  patient  should rest before blood pressure  is recorded.  
o On infusion days, blood pressure will  be measured at Oh (pre -dose), approximately  30 min 
(mid-infusion),  approximately  60 min  (end of infusion),  and approximately  1 h after the  end of 
infusion.  Note:  A window of ±15  min is allowed  for all  blood pressure  measurements, except for  
the 0 h (pre-dose)  measurement.  
o No dose  should be  given  if blood pressure  is 150/90 mmHg.  Antihypertensive medication may 
be given  to control increased blood pressure . Dosing can  proceed on  the scheduled day if at 
least 2  consecutive measurements <150/90 mmHg  are recorded. In the absence of these 
measurements, dosing must be delayed.  
• Patients  will initiate a  low-iodine diet preferably 7 days before  initiation  of the  lesional dosimetry 
process,  but minimally 5  days  before  initiation  of the lesional dosimetry  process (Appendix  C). 
•  Patients  will undergo a second  biopsy while  on therapy,  unless  the patient  is exempt  as defined 
in Section 6.1. When performing the second (on -treatment) biopsy, every attempt should be 
made  to obtain tissue from  the same  tumor sampled at  baseline  (the pretreatment biopsy) . Every 
effort will  be made  to perform the on -treatment biopsy  on Dtx15  or Dtx16  before the  Thyrogen 
injection . However,  the timing of  the biopsy may be changed at  the discretion of the Principle 
Investigator  to account for patient preference and scheduling needs.  
• For DtxB  to Dtx 15, patients  will complete  a second  (on-treatment)  Thyrogen -stimulated  1-124 
PET/CT  lesional dosimetry while on therapy, as described above (see Table 10 -2 for the on­ 
treatment  Thyrogen -stimulated  1-124 PET/CT  schedule  and requirements).  In addition  to this, the 
second  Thyrogen -stimulated 1 -124 PET/CT  process will  incorporate routine analyses for  
determining the  maximum  tolerated activity (MTA),  to guide subsequent 1 -131 therapy. This 
analysis  reproduces  the standard -of-care MTA analysis  used  routinely with  1-131, and includes:  
o Routine  blood  samples  will be collected  (into green -top tubes)  on days  1 (pre-Thyrogen),  3, 4, 
5, 6, and  8 for radioiodine pharmacokinetics  (enumeration of days here  are relative  to the day 
of the first Thyrogen injection  [given  on DtxB]). These  blood  collections are  non-research  and 
will be performed  in the Nuclear fv1edicine  clinic,  therefore deviations  from the specific  
timepoints  or approach  to collection will  be allowed . 
o Note:  Hour designations  noted here  are approximations of the  intervals  from the time  that the 
1-124 is orally administered,  not specific  hours at  which  the blood  collections  must  be done.  
 
• Interpretation  of the on-treatment  1-124 PET/CTscan(performed  on DtxBto  Dtx15)  
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center 
IRB Number: 20 -053 A(4)  
Approval  date: 09-Nov-2021   
o If lesional dosimetry with  the second  1-124 PET/CT scan  (at~ 2 days after  delivery  of 1-124 
during  the on-treatment  Thyrogen -stimulated  1-124 PET/CT  lesional dosimetry (Dtx  12 scan)) 
reveals that a  dose of  2000 cGy can be  delivered  to at least 1  tumor with  ::;300 mCi of  I- 
131(the lesional dosimetry  threshold),  the Principal Investigator  and treating physician(s)will 
decide  whether 1 -131 therapy should  proceed. As an alternative  to relying  on the PET/CT 
performed just  2 days after 1 -124, per the  Principal Investigator's  discretion, the  decision to 
proceed  with therapeutic  1-131 could also  be determined  after the  biologic half -life has  been 
calculated from the  full complement of  1-124 PET/CT  images  collected (completed by  Dtx 15 
according  to Table  10.2).  
o If deemed  appropriate,  the patient  will receive  Thyrogen  (0.9 mg) on  Dtx 16 and Dtx 17 and 
then will  be treated  with 1-131 therapy on  Dtx 18. (depending  on scheduling issues, Thyrogen 
injection could also  be given  Dtx 15 and Dtx 16, followed by 1 -131 therapy on  Dtx 17.) 
o  For patients  who have  sufficient  uptake  to warrant  treatment  with 1-131, the low-iodine diet 
must  be continued for  2 days  after administration  of therapeutic 1 -131 (1-131 activity 
administered for  each  patient will be  guided by the  calculated MTA) . Vemurafenib  will 
continue for 2  days after  the administration  of 1-131 therapy.  
o  For patients  who did not  meet the  lesional  dosimetry threshold  required  for treatment  with 1 - 
131, study drugs  and low -iodine  diet will be  discontinued  immediately,  and a  final tumor 
assessment  will be performed.  This includes  not administering  a second dose  of copanlisib 
scheduled  for Day 15  (+/-1 day)  (these patients  will have  received  only 1 dose  of copanlisib).  
o If there is  evidence  of disease  progression before  completing treatment  with vemurafenib and 
copanlisib, study treatment with  these  drugs and  1-131 will be allowed to continue if the 
treating physician deems that such  a decision is clinically justifiable.  
o Note:  If no iodine  uptake  is detected  on the  second  1-124 PET/CT  scan  done  on Dtx 12 (~2 
days  after  1-124), the subsequent 1 -124 PET/CT scans (e.g., at ~3 and ~5 days after 1 -124) 
and the planned  blood  sample collections for MTA  determination  does not  have  to be 
completed. If the degree of iodine uptake  measured  on the  Dtx 1 2 (~2  days  after  1-124) 1-124 
PET/CT  scan  is determined to be  insufficient  for 1-131 therapy, the planned blood sample 
collections for  MTA determination  may not be completed; however, the  subsequent 1 -124 
PET/CT  scans  (e.g.,  at ~72 and ~120  h after 1 -124) may still be performed to  evaluate  iodine 
retention . 
• If a patient  is unable to  receive  the on -treatment Thyrogen -stimulated  1-124 PET/CT  lesional 
dosimetry process for  unanticipated  reasons (e .g., weather delays, holidays,  travel issues, 
personal  conflicts, availability  of tracer),  performance of  the 1-124 PET/CT  protocol will be 
rescheduled to  the following week.  To avoid unnecessary drug exposure, vemurafenib and 
copanlisib  can be stopped and  restarted  3 days before  the rescheduled  administration  of 1-124 
tracer.  
• Note:  If feasible,  tumor  measurements  (per RECIST  v1.1) will be performed  with CT scans  (without 
iodinated  contrast)  and/or  MRI scans  at separate  times  from the 1-124 PET/CT  scans  according  to 
the schedule in Section 10.0 .

9.2 Dose -escalation  rules  and definition  of DLT 
Dose  escalation will proceed  within each  cohort  according to  a 3+3  design as outlined in  the schema 
below . 
Table  9-1: Dose levels  (modified  3+3 design)  
 
 
Dose  
Level  Vemurafenib  
Dose  Copanlisib  Dose  
2 960 mg PO bid 60 mg IV weekly  
1 (start)  960 mg PO bid 45 mg IV weekly  
-1 720 mg PO bid 45 mg IV weekly  
-2 480 mg PO bid 45 mg IV weekly  
 
Dose -escalation/de -escalation rules  for the 3+3 design : Three patients  viii be evaluated  for the  
dose  level being tested. If  O of the initial 3 patients  experience  a DLT, the next higher dose  level viii  
be tested.  If 1 of the initial  3 patients  at any dose  level experiences  a DLT, 3 additional  
patients  w/1 be  treated  at the same  dose  level. Escalation  to the next  dose  level viii  only occur if 
no additional  DLTs  are observed. If  2 patients  experience a DLT,  the next lo'v \er dose  level viii be 
tested. Please see  below the specific plan for possible iterations  that may be  observed  and how 
MTD viii  be determined.  
 
• If O of the initial  3 patients  at dose  level 1 experience  a DLT,  dose level  2 will be studied.  
• If 1 of the initial  3 patients at dose  level 1  experiences  a DLT,  3 additional  patients will  be treated 
at the same  dose  level. Escalation to  dose  level 2 will proceed only if  no additional  DLTs  have 
been observed . 
• If 2 patients  at dose  level  1 experience  a DLT,  dose  level  -1 will be studied . 
• If 2 patients  at dose  level  -1 experience  a DLT,  dose  level  -2 will be studied.  
 
MTD  determinations:  
• If only 3  patients  have been treated  at the dose  under consideration  as the MTD, an  additional  3 
patients will be  treated at  the same  level. The dose  will be  declared  the MTD if  :::;;1 DLTwas 
observed  among  the 6  treated patients . If there  is >1 DLT among  the 6  treated patients, the next 
lower dose level will be considered the MTD.  
• If 2 patients at  dose  level  2 experience  a DLT,  and :::;;1 out of 6 patients treated at  dose  level 1 
experience a  DLT, then dose level 1 will  be declared the MTD.  
• If 2 patients  at dose  level  -2 experience a  DLT,  the combination  will be determined  to be 
unsafe,  and the  trial will  end. 
 
Once  the MTD for vemurafenib plus copanlisib is established, up  to an  additional  4 patients  will be 
enrolled  in the  cohort, bringing the total number of  patients treated at the MTD to  10. As an added 
precaution  for safety,  if 2 of the additional 4  patients experience a  DLT,  further accrual  will be halted.

Approval  date: 09-Nov-2021   
 
Definitions  of DLTs:  
Toxicities will be  evaluated  using  CTCAE version 5.0 (CTCAE  v5.0). Only  toxicities  that meet  DLT 
definitions  within the  DLT assessment  window  (from  the initiation  of copanlisib study  treatment  to 7 
days after completion  of study  drug administration) and  are attributed to  vemurafenib,  copanlisib  or 
copanlisib plus vemurafenib  will be  counted as  DLTs.  Toxicities unrelated  to either drug  will not  be 
considered DLTs.  If a patient withdraws from  the study prior to the  completion of the  DLT 
assessment window for reasons  other than a  DLT,  the patient  may be replaced and no  DLTwill be 
considered to  have occurred,  unless the  Principal Investigator  judges that the case  should be 
considered a DLT. Dl Ts will otherwise  be defi ned as : 
1.  Any grade  3 adverse event possibly,  probably, or  definitely related to  vemurafenib,  copanlisib or 
the combination of  copanlisib and vemurafenib . Exceptions to  this rule  include nausea, vomiting, 
or diarrhea  without maximal supportive therapy,  grade 3 hypertension without optimal medical 
intervention  or which  is transient (improves without  medical  intervention), development  of new 
nonmelanoma skin cancer,  alopecia, asymptomatic lipase and/or  amylase elevation,  grade  3 
fatigue lasting for -5.7 days,  grade 3 decreased  lymphocyte  count, hyperglycemia, grade 3  rash 
or palmar -plantar erythrodysethesia that improves to  grade 2 with supportive therapy within 7 
days, grade 3 fever controlled  with medication within  7 days  and/or  other grade  3 
asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities  that can be  corrected  within 7 days.  
2. Any grade  5 adverse  events,  unless  clearly  not related  to treatment.  
3. Any adverse  event  that leads  to a dose  delay  of 7 days . 
4. Any adverse  event  that requires  a permanent  dose  reduction.  
5.  Febrile neutropenia  occurring  from the time of initiating  study  drugs up  to 4 weeks  after 
therapeutic  RAI (1 -131) will be considered a  DLT.  
 
Patients who  experience  a DLT will  be allowed to  continue in  the study at  a lower dose, in 
accordance  with the protocol -specified  dose  modification, following recovery of  the toxicity to  grade  
-5.1 or the baseline  level of severity  (see Section  11). 
 
Patients who  delay vemurafenib or  copanlisib for  3 days as a  result of  unanticipated  scheduling 
issues  (e.g.,  weather, emergencies;  not drug-related toxicity) will  not be evaluable  and be replaced 
for DLT evaluation  but may  continue on  the protocol. All patients  receiving at  least one dose  of 
copanlisib will be evaluable  for DLT.  
 
If a patient  experiences  intolerable  or Grade  3 toxicities  possibly,  probably, or  definitely  related  to 
vemurafenib before the  first dose  of copanlisib is administered,  this will  NOT  be considered a  DLT 
and the  patient will be  replaced. The patient can be  taken off  study OR continue on protocol with 
vemurafenib alone with  dose reduction per Section 11.0.  
 
 
9.3 Recommendations  on meal  timing  with copanlisib  
 
Because  of its inhibitory  effect on  PI3Ka, which  has been implicated in insulin metabolism, 
copanlisib infusions could  be associated  with a temporary increase  in blood glucose . Consuming a 
meal  in close  proximity  to copanlisib infusion may  exacerbate glucose  increase.  It is recommended 
that the  timing and content of  caloric intake on  infusion days are  monitored by  the investigators.  
Consultation  with an endocrinologist may  be necessary . 
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center 
IRB Number: 20 -053 A(4)  
Approval  date: 09-Nov-2021   
 
The investiga tor will review  the glucose  profile during  and after  copanlisib infusions . Timing  and 
content of caloric intake on infusion days will be  managed by the investigator.  
 
To minimize  glucose increases,  the investigator  may manage  the timing  of postinfusion  meals  on the 
basis  of the glucose profile  during  prior infusion(s) . This is in addition  to glucose -lowering 
medication. For only the firstcopanlisib infusion, fasting is  required (8 -h minimum) before the first 
glucose measurement on the date of infusion.  A low -glycemic -index  meal may be  taken 2  h after 
infusion. For  all subsequent copanlisib infusions, the  decision regarding meal  timing  can be made  by 
the investigator  on the basis of  glucose -response  patterns during prior treatment days . Generally,  a 
low-glycemic -index  meal may be  taken within  4 h before the start of the study drug infusion.  
 
A low-glycemic -index  diet (see Appendix  D) is recommended  for the first 48 h after study  drug 
infusion. However, caloric  restriction is not  intended for the  population  under study.  
 
Note:  Caloric intake  and timing recommendations  for patients  with diabetes who  require insulin 
treatment before the  infusion at  any time  point should  be managed  by the investigator  on the basis 
of consultation  with the treating physician  or diabetes/endocrinologist physician.  
9.4 Recommendation  on glucose  monitoring with  copanlisib 
Glucose monitoring  for the first copanlisib  administration  
•  Blood glucose  will be  measured  at Oh (predose) and ~1  h after completion of infusion and 
subsequently  if clinically indicated, at  the discretion of the  investigator.  Patients should be 
educated  on the signs and  symptoms  of hyperglycemia, such  as frequent  urination,  increased 
thirst, blurred vision, headaches, and difficulty concentrating,  and must  report these to  the 
investigator  or their physician immediately.  
 
Glucose  monitoring  for the second  copanlisib  infusion  
 
• If hyperglycemia  is <250  mg/dl  after the  first copanlisib infusion, at the discretion of the 
investigator,  post-infusion glucose  monitoring may  or may not be  performed. Pre -infusion 
glucose testing before copanlisib is required to ensure fasting levels  <160 mg/dl  or 
random/nonfast ing glucose levels  <200 mg/dl.  
 
Glucose  monitoring  at home  
•  For all patients who experience  persistent glucose >250 mg/dl  (13.9 mmol/L) or who receive 
antidiabetic  treatment on the  day of  infusion, fasting  glucose  should  be measured  the next  day. 
If the glucose reading is <100 mg/dl  (5.5 mmol/L; nondiabetic)  or <160 mg/dl  (8.9 mmol/L; 
diabetic),  record  the reading and stop further  glucose  measurements until  the next copanlisib 
infusion.  If the glucose reading is >100 mg/dl  (5.5 mmol/L; nondiabetic)  or >160 mg/dl  (8.9 
mmol/L;  diabetic), inform the  study  nurse  or investigator.  If the patient has  known diabetes and 
already monitors his/her blood glucose  as part of routine diabetes  care, the  routine 
measurements should  not be replaced by  the study -specific  measurements. In this situation, 
patients should add the study -specific measurements to  their routine.  
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center 
IRB Number: 20 -053 A(4)  
Approval  date: 09-Nov-2021   
• For patients  without diabetes  who e xperience persisting glucose >250 mg/dl  (13.9  mmol/L)  or 
who require treatment  to maintain optimal  glucose  levels, consultation with  an endocrinologist is 
encouraged.  These patients without diabetes will be  trained on  how to measure  their capillary 
blood glucose levels at home.  If applicable,  patients will be  provided  with a  glucose meter  and 
supplies (e.g., lancets, test strips,  and diary) to register measured values and record oral 
glucose -lowering  medication and/or insulin administ ration.  
Please  refer  to Table  11-13 and consider  consultation with  an endocrinologist  for the management 
of hyperglycemia.  
 
9.5 Concomitant  medications  and therapies 
Permitted concomitant  therapy:  
• Standard  therapies for  concurrent  medical  conditions  
•  Treatment with nonconventional therapies  (for example, herbs or acupuncture) and 
vitamin/mineral  supplements is  acceptable, provided they do  not interfere with  the study 
endpoints, in  the opinion of  the Investigator.  St. John's wort  is not  permitted.  
• Bisph osphonates  or other  bone -modifying  agents  (e.g.,  denosumab)  
• Patients who  are therapeutically treated  with an agent such  as warfarin  or heparin  will be  allowed 
to participate,  provided  their medication dose  and international  normalized ratio/partial 
thromboplastin  time is  stable . Close monitoring  is recommended,  in accordance with  the 
standard of  care.  If either of these  values  is above the  therapeutic  range, the  doses  should be 
modified and the assessments should  be repeated weekly until the  value(s) become(s) stable . 
•  Antiemetics:  prophylactic  anti-emetics may  be administered in  accordance  with standard 
practice.  The routine use  of standard antiemetics,  including  5-HT3 blockers, such  as granisetron, 
ondansetron,  or an  equivalent  agent, is allowed as  needed.  
•  The use of corticosteroids  as antiemetics before copanlisib administration  will not  be allowed 
(given the risk  of worsened hyperglycemia).  
• Palliative  and supportive care  for the other disease -related  symptoms  and for toxicities 
associated with treatment will be  offered to  all patients  in this trial.  
• Patients  may receive  palliative  and supportive  care for any underlying  illness.  
• Low-dose  aspirin  (maximum 100  mg/day)  and low-dose  heparin  are permitted.  
• Patients  taking narrow -therapeutic -index medications  should  be monitored  proactively if  these 
medications cannot be  avoided . These  medications may  include quinidine,  cyclosporine, and 
digoxin.  
•  Therapeutic  drugs known to  be substrates of  P-gp and/or BCRP  with narrow therapeutic  index 
should be used with  caution, and patients should be  monitored for any  sign of toxicity. 
Furthermore, sensitive  substrates  of the renal  drug transporter MATE2K  (e.g., metformin)  should 
be used  with caution (see  Appendix  E). Metformin  should  be interrupted  for 48  h after receipt  of 
iodinated  contrast  media. Please  see prescribing information for further  information.  
•  Calcium  channel  blockers  may be used  to control  preexisting hypertension.  Nondihydropyridine 
calcium  channel blockers (e.g., verapamil and diltiazem) should be avoided  because  of a 
potential interaction with CYP3A4 . 
•  Short -term (up to 7 days) systemic corticosteroids  >15 mg prednisone  or equivalent  will be 
allowed  for the management  of acute  conditions (e .g., treatment  of noninfectious  pneumonitis 
[NIP]) .

Prohibited  concomitant  therapy:  
The following  medications  are prohibited  during study  treatment (see  Table  9-2 below). 
This list is  not comprehensive and is only meant to  be used as a guide.  
• Strong  inhibitors  or inducers  of CYP3M/5  
• Substrates  of CYP3A4/5  with narrow  therapeutic  index  
• Medications  that carry  a strong  risk for QT  prolongation  
• Herbal  medications/preparations  (except  for vitamins)  
• Other  investigational and  antineoplastic  therapies  
• Anti-arrhythmic  therapy  other  than beta blockers  or digoxin  
•  Systemic corticosteroid  therapy at  a daily dose >15  mg prednisone or equivalent.  Previous 
corticosteroid  therapy must  be stopped or reduced to  the allowed  dose at  least 7  days  before 
study  registration.  If a patient is  on chronic  corticosteroid  therapy,  corticosteroids  should  be de­ 
escalated to  the maximum allowed dose  before the  screening. Patients may  be using  topical or 
inhaled corticosteroids.  Short -term (up  to 7 days) systemic corticosteroids  >15 mg prednisolone 
or equivalent  will be  allowed  for the management of acute  issues.  The use  of corticosteroids  as 
antiemetics before copanlisib administration will not be allowed.  
• Ongoing  immunosuppressive  therapy  
• Concomitant  radiotherapy  
• Herbal medications, including but not limited to  St. John's wort,  Kava, e phedra (ma  huang), 
ginkgo biloba,  dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), yohimbe, saw  palmetto,  black  cohosh, and 
ginseng. Patients should  stop using  all herbal medications at  least  7 days  before  the first  dose  of 
study treatment.

9.6 Correlative  studies  
Ex oratory  objective : To evaluate  how vemurafenib and  copanlisib  affect  I\AAPK/Pl3K  signaling  and 
thyroid differentiation in  tumors  of patients  with RAIR disease.  Biopsies  will be performed  at baseline 
and on  treatment with  vemurafenib plus copanlisib (as in  Table  10-2), unless the  patient is exempt 
(Section  6.1). Biopsies of  any tumor site  is allowed, but metastatic  tumors  are preferred, and every  
attempt should be made when  performing both biopsies to obtain tissue  from the  same  tumor. The 
RNA and DNA assays suggested  below may  be substituted for other  techniques  or platforms, 
depending  on availability.  
 
Transcriptomic  and protein -based  analyses of serial biopsy specimens : As the amount of frozen 
tissue  obtained  from biopsies is limited, we  will prioritize sensitive array -based t echnologies to 
quantify gene expression and to sequence cancer  genes . We will isolate RNA from pre - and post­ 
treatment biopsy specimens for  interrogation. RNAseq will be  performed to quantify transcripts 
regulated by  MAPK  (MAPK output},22 the BRAF -RAS score  (a 71-gene signature  that distinguishes 
BRAFv6ooE from RAS  mutant tumors5), and the enhanced Thyroid Differentiation Score (which  is a 
gene signature of  thyroid -specific differentiation .5 Each  of these scores provides an  average fold­ 
change for all mRNAs in  the respective gene sets, compared  with the  median of  all samples.  In 
addition,  we will measure  the effects of  vemurafenib  plus copanlisib on the  transcription of  iodine 
organification genes and PI3K transcriptional  output. These transcriptomic  readouts will  then be 
analyzed in  the context  of change in  lesional 1 -124 concentration observed  with 1-124 PET.  The 
transcriptomic  data will also be investigated  for other exploratory  pathways,  signatures,  and biologic 
parameters.  Alternative  platforms to RNAseq may  also be used  if appropriate  and available . Other 
protein  markers  of interest, such  as phospho -AKT,  may be analyzed  by the  appropriate  assay  (e.g., 
immunohistochemistry,  Western blot, mass spectrometry, reverse protein phase array).  
 
Genomic Analysis:  Baseline  genomic analysis  will be performed using MSK -IMPACT,  a next­ 
generation  sequencing  platform  .23 Alternative  techniques may  be considered  or performed  (e.g. 
Sequenom analysis, Sanger sequencing, whole -exome) at  the time  of analyses, if  deemed 
appropriate.

copanlisib dose . 
dFasting  is required  for at least  8 h before  the first infusion  of copanlisib.  A low -glycemic  meal  can be consumed  2 h after the first infusim  of 
copanlisib . A low -glycemic diet  is recommended  for 48 h after the copanlisib  infusion . 
"Fasting  for 4 h or more  before  the second  and third infusions of copanlisib  should  be considered . The decision  regarding meal  timing  after 
infusion can  be made by the  investigator on the basis of glucose  response patterns during  prior treatment days . A low  -glycemic diet  is 
recommended  for 48 h after the  infusion of copanlisib (see  Sections 9 .3 and 9 .4).

Investigator to account for patient preference and scheduling needs . 
1The screening  period  for DLTs  will be from the initiation  of study  treatment  to 7 days  after completion  of study  drug admnistration . The 
continuous nature  of this  monitoring  does  not imply  the need  for daily communication  with the patient; the  reporting  of adverse  events  or 
DLTs  that are brought  to the attention of  the study  team  will be captured.  
mBlood  pressure will  be measured approximately  every  5-10 mn before  each  copanlisib dose , until 2 consecutive results  <150/90 mmHg 
are recorded (no  more than 4 measurements) . If blood pressure is  150/90  mmHg,  the investigator can  consider medical  intervention  or 
delay the infusion of the study drug . The patient should rest  before blood pressure is recorded . On infusion days,  blood pressure will  be 
measured  at O h , 30 mn  (midinfusion) , 60 mn  (end of infusion),  and 1 h (all  approximate  time points) after  the end of the infusion.  Of note ,

11.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
11.1 Clinical  Toxicity  Data  forVemurafenib  
Vemurafenib  is FDA approved  for the treatment  of unresectable or  metastatic  melanoma  with BRAF 
V600E mutation and for Erdheim -Chester  disease with BRAF V600  mutation. Vemurafenib  is also 
NCCN compendium -approved for BRAF -positive  OTC. Because  clinical  studies are conducted 
under widely varying  conditions, adverse -reaction  rates observed in  the clinical studies  of a drug 
cannot be directly compared  to rates  in the clinical studies  of another  drug and  may not predict the 
rates observed in a  broader  patient population  in clinical practice . This section describes adverse 
drug reactions identified  from analyses of 2  trials:  trial 118 and trial 2.19 Trial 1  randomized  (1:1) 675 
treatment -naive  patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma to receive either vemurafenib 
(960 mg PO  BID) or dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2 IV every 3  weeks). In trial 2,  132 patients with 
metastatic melanoma and  failure of  at least 1  prior systemic therapy received treatment with 
vemurafenib  (960 mg PO BID) . 
Table  11-1 presents the adverse reactions reported in at  least  10% of  patients treated with 
vemurafenib.  The most  common  adverse reactions of any grade ( 30% in either study) in 
vemurafenib -treated patients  were  arthralgia, rash, alopecia, fatigue, photosensitivity reaction, 
nausea, pruritus, and skin  papilloma. The most  common ( 5%) grade 3 adverse reactions  were 
cutaneous  squamous cell  carcinoma (SCC) and rash. The  incidence of grade 4  adverse reactions 
was :54% in  both studies.  In trial 1, the  incidence of adverse events resulting in  permanent 
discontinuation of  study medication was 7%  for the vemurafenib arm and  4% for the  dacarbazine 
arm. In trial  2, the incidence of adverse events resulting in  permanent discontinuation of study 
medication was  3%. In trial 1,  the median duration of  study treatment was  4.2 months  for 
vemurafenib and  0.8 months  for dacarbazine; in  trial 2, the median duration of  study  treatment was  
5.7 months.

11.2 Clinical  toxicity  data for copanlisib  
 
Copanlisib is  FDA approved for  the treatment of  patients with relapsed  follicular lymphoma  who have 
had at least 2  prior systemic therapies.  This approval was based  on a large  phase II study of 
copanlisib in 142  patients  with relapsed/refractory  indolent  lymphoma who had  received 2  or more 
prior therapies. The  objective response rate  was 59% (84/142 patients), with  a median duration of 
response  of 22.6 months.20 The overall  safety profile of copanlisib  is based on data from 317 
subjects treated  in clinical studies . In clinical studies, the most  commonly reported  suspected 
adverse  reactions in  patients  with non-Hodgkin's  lymphoma (indolent and aggressive) and  solid 
tumors  treated with  copanlisib monotherapy included  pneumonitis, lower respiratory tract infections 
(including pneumonia),  and febrile neutropenia;  the most  common  adverse reactions ( 20%) were 
hyperglycemia, decreased  general strength and energy (including fatig ue and asthenia), 
hypertension,  diarrhea, nausea, leukopenia,  and neutropenia.

Special  warnings  with copanlisib  monotherapy:  
 
•  Infections : Serious infections (including  fatal infections) occurred  in 19% of 317  subjects 
treated with copanlisib monotherapy.  The most  common  infections were  pneumonia, lung 
infection, and  lower respiratory  tract infection. Pneumocystis jirovecii  pneumonia occurred in 
0.6% of  317 subjects treated with copanlisib monotherapy. Before in itiating  treatment with 
copanlisib, consider Pneumocystisjiroveciipneumonia prophylaxis  for populations  at risk . 
 
• Noninfectious  pneumonitis (NIP) : NIP (all  events grade  S3) occurred  in 5.0%  of 317 subjects 
treated with copanlisib monotherapy.  
 
•  Neutropenia/febrile  neutropenia : Grade  4 neutropenia  (febrile  and nonfebrile) occurred  in 
9.1% of  317 subjects treated with copanlisib monotherapy. Serious febrile neutropenia 
occurred in 1.9%.  
 
•  Transient  hypertension : Serious hypertension (all events grade  3) occurred  in 0.9%  of 317 
subjects treated with copanlisib monotherapy.  Treatment with copanlisib may  result in 
transient hypertension.  The mean systolic blood pressure  and diastolic blood pressure 
increased after dosing on cycle  1, day 1 and started to decrease approximately  2 h 
postinfusion.

45 mg IV weekly  •  Transient hypergl ycemia: Serious grade  4 hyperglycemia (>500  mg/dl)  occurred  in 0.9%  of 
317 subjects  treated with copanlisib monotherapy.  Treatment  with copanlisib may  result in 
transient hyperglycemia . Blood glucose  levels  typically peaked 5 to  8 h postinfusion and 
subsequently  declined  to baseline  levels . Optimal  blood glucose  control  should be  achieved 
before starting  each  copanlisib infusion. Of  the 20  subjects  with diabetes  mellitus treated  in 
CHRONOS -1, 7 developed  grade 4  hyperglycemia  and 2 discontinued treatment.  
 
• Embryofetal  toxicity:  On the basis of  its mechanism of  action and  findings  in a rat embryofetal 
development  study, copanlisib may  cause embryofetal harm.  
 
 
General  guidelines  for dose  modification  and toxicity  management  
The recommendations  for the management  of adverse  events in this section  are to  serve  as general 
guidelines; dose  reductions or  delays for  any event of any  CTCAE  grade may always be  considered 
for safety reasons, at the discretion  of the treating investigator . 
 
Patients who  require discontinuation  of either drug  may continue  to receive  the remaining drug 
(vemurafenib or copanlisib).

Recommendations  for Non-infectious  Pneurnonitis  (NIP)  
In the event of  suspected  NIP of any grade, copanlisib must  be interrupted  and diagnostic 
examination of the  patient experiencing  pulmonary symptoms conducted . If NIP  is the final 
diagnosis, copanlisib must  be permanently  discontinued if  CTC grade  3. For CTC  grade 2,  the 
patient should  be treated until  resolution  or improvement to CTC  grade  1; the next lower  dose  level 
of copanlisib should  then be  given. Pneumonitis  is to be reported as such  only in  the event of  NIP. If 
NIP related  to copanlisib  is confirmed,  the treating investigator  should  administer systemic  steroids.  

Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center 
IRB Number: 20 -053 A(4)  
Approval  date: 09-Nov-2021   
The investigator  is requested to differentiate  between  NIP and infectious pneumonitis (viral,  
bacterial, fungal), aspiration pneumonitis, or  other pneumonitis clearly not  due to  a potential 
hypersensitivity reaction to  the copanlisib infusion;  the investigator  must  provide the basis  for their 
assessment  of infectious or  other diagnosis,  as appropriate . The investigator  is requested to  use the 
most -specific clinical  terms to  describe the condition  in their report, not simply  "pneumonitis."

The lowest  dose  level is 45 mg; if the patient  is already  at the 45 -mg dose  level  and cannottolerate treatment,  the study 
treatmentwill be discontinued permanently . 
 
Recommendations  for arterial  hypertension  
Blood pressure will be measured every 5 -10 min before each copanlisib dose (no more than 4 
measurements) until  2 consecutive  results <150/90 mmHg are  recorded. If blood pressure  is 150/90 
mmHg,  the investigator  can consider a medical  intervention  or delay infusion of the study drug. The 
patient should rest for 5 -10 min  before blood pressure  is recorded.  
On infusion  days,  blood  pressure  will be measured  at Oh (predose),  30 min (midinfusion),  60 min (end 
of infusion),  and 1 h after the end of infusion  
Note: A window of ±10 min is allowed for all blood pressure measurements, except for the 0 -h 
(predose) measurement.  
 
No dose should be given if blood pressure is  150/90 mmHg. Antihypertensive medication may be 
given to con trol increased blood pressure . Dosing can proceed on the scheduled day if at least 2 
consecutive measurements <150/90  mmHg are recorded. Otherwise, dosing must  be delayed.  
 
If drug -related arterial hypertension (postdose blood  pressure  of CTCAE grade  3 or 160/100 mmHg) 
is not manageable with optimal antihypertensive treatment, the dose for the subsequent copanlisib 
administrations should  be at  the next lowest  dose  level.  Patients with  a postdose  blood pressure that 
may have  life-threatening  consequences  (e.g.,  malignant  arterial  hypertension,  transient  or permanent 
neurologic  deficit, hypertensive  crisis)  must  permanently discontinue the study drug.  
 
It is important that patients with  preexisting arterial hypertension adhere to  their regular medication 
schedule and take their usual doses on the  days of study drug infusion.  
 
The management  of acute  blood  pressure  increases  following  copanlisib  will be individualized  for each 
patient, but the experience in phase I study has suggested a benefit of dihydropyridine calcium 
channel blockers (i.e., amlodipine, felodipine). Nitrates should also be considered. Verapamil and 
diltiazem (non -dihydropyridine calcium channel  blockers and moderate inhibitors of  CYP3M) should 
be used  with caution, owing to  a potential interaction  with CYP3M. In general,  it is advisable  for sites 
to be prepared  so that antihypertensive medication is  readily  available  if needed.

In the event of arterial hypertension  150/90 mmHg during infusion of copanlisib during any cycle, 
antihypertensive treatment is suggested, as indicated in Table 8. In the event of CTCAE grade 3 
arterial hypertension ( 160/100  mmHg) during infusion of copan lisib, the infusion should be 
interrupted and antihypertensive treatment administered, as suggested above. Infusion can be 
resumed when blood pressure has returned  to <150/90 mmHg .

given  as appropriate . Adequate  hydration through appropriate  fluid maintenance  is essential for the 
treatment of  diarrhea  or vomiting. Antidiarrhea  medications may  be introduced if  symptoms occur.  
 
The recommended dose of  loperamide  is 4 mg  at first onset, followed by 2  mg every 2 -4 h until 
diarrhea -free for 12 h;  a maximum  daily dose  of 16 mg is not to be  exceeded . If clinically indicated, 
diphenoxylate  hydrochloride  with or without atropine  sulfate can  be used.  The routine  use of 
standard antiemetics, including 5 -HT3 blockers, is allowed (see  permitted concomitant therapy

12.0 CRITERIA FOR  THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
For the purposes of this study, patients  should be re -evaluated for  response as per the study 
calendars in  Section  10.0. Confirmatory scans  for assessment  of partial  and complete responses 
should also  be obtained no  less than  4 weeks after initial documentation of objective response.  
 
Response  and progression  will be  evaluated  using  the new international  criteria proposed by the 
revised  RECIST guidelines  (version 1 .1)24, with some  amendments,  as indicated below for this 
protocol.  Changes in  the largest  diameter (unidimensional measurement)  of the tumor  lesion and  the 
shortest diameter,  in the case of  malignant lymph nodes, are included in  RECIST 1 .1. 
 
Definitions  
 
Evaluable  for DLT: All patients will  be evaluable  for DLT from the  time of their first  treatment with 
vemurafenib  and copanlisib.  
 
Evaluable  for toxicity : All patients  will be evaluable  for toxicity  from the time of their first  treatment 
with vemurafenib . 
 
Evaluable  for objective response : Please  see Section  14 for guidelines  regarding evaluable  for 
response.  
 
Evaluable  Non-Target  Disease  Response : Patients who  have lesions present at  baseline that are 
evaluable  but do not meet  the definitions  of measurable disease,  have received at  least  one cycle  of 
therapy, and have had  their disease  re-evaluated  will be considered evaluable  for non-target 
disease. The  response assessment  is based on  the presence,  absence, or  unequivocal  progression 
of the lesions . 
 
Disease  Parameters  
 
rvleasurable  disease:  rvleasurable  lesions  are defined  as those  that can be accurately  measured  in at 
least one dimension (longest diameter to  be recorded) as  20 mm by chest  x-ray or as  10 mm with 
CT scan,  MRI,  or calipers  by clinical  exam. All  tumor  measurements must  be recorded in   millimeters  
(or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor  lesions that are  situated in a  previously  irradiated  area might or  might not  be 
considered  measurable. If the investigator  thinks  it appropriate  to include them,  the conditions under 
Vlthich  such  lesions should  be considered must  be defined in the  protocol . 
 
Malignant  lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged and  measurable, a  lymph node 
must  be 15 mm in short  axis when assessed by  CT scan  (CT scan  slice thickness recommended to 
be no greater than 5  mm).  At baseline and in  follow -up, only the short axis will  be measured  and 
followed.

Non-measurable disease: All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small  lesions (longest 
diameter  <10 mm or pathological lymph  nodes  with 2::10  to <15 mm short  axis),  are considered  non­ 
measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal  disease, ascites,  pleural/pericardia!  effusions, 
lymphangitis  cutis/pulmonitis,  inflammatory breast  disease,  and abdominal  masses  (not followed by 
CT or MRI),  are considered as non -measurable.  
Note:  Cystic  lesions  that meet  the criteria  for radiographically  defined  simple  cysts  should  not be 
considered  as malignant  lesions (neither  measurable  nor non -measurable)  since  they are,  by 
definition,  simple cysts.  
 
'Cystic lesions' thought to represent cystic metastases can  be considered as  measurable lesions, if 
they meet  the definition  of measurability  described  above. However,  if non-cystic  lesions are  present 
in the same  patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
Target  lesions : All measurable  lesions up to  a maximum of  2 lesions per  organ and 5  lesions in  total, 
representative  of all involved  organs, should be identified  as target  lesions and recorded and 
measured  at baseline. Target lesions should be  selected on the  basis  of their size  (lesions with  the 
longest diameter), be  representative  of all involved  organs, but  in addition should be  those that lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated  measurements. It may be  the case  that, on occasion,  the 
largest lesion  does  not lend itself to  reproducible  measurement in  which  circumstance the  next 
largest lesion which  can be measured reproducibly  should be  selected. A sum  of the diameters 
(longest for non -nodal  lesions, short  axis for nodal lesions)  for all target  lesions  will be calculated 
and reported as the  baseline sum  diameters.  If lymph  nodes are  to be  included in  the sum,  then only 
the short  axis is added into the  sum.  The baseline sum  diameters will be  used  as reference to  further 
characterize any objective tumor  regression in  the measurable dimension of the  disease.  
 
Non-target lesions : All other  lesions (or  sites  of disease)  including any  measurable  lesions over and 
above the 5  target  lesions should  be identified  as non-target  lesions  and should  also be recorded  
at baseline. Measurements of these  lesions  are not  required,  but the  presence,  absence,  or in rare 
cases  unequivocal  progression of  each should be noted throughout  follow -up. 
 
rv1ethods  for Evaluation  of rv1easurable  Disease  
 
All measurements should be  taken and recorded in  metric notation  using a  ruler or calipers. All 
baseline evaluations  should  be performed  as closely  as possible  to the beginning of treatment  and 
never more  than 4 weeks before the beginning  of the study.  
 
The same  method of assessment and  the same  technique  should be used to characterize each 
identified  and reported lesion at  baseline and  during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation  is 
preferred  to evaluation  by clinical examination  unless  the lesion(s)  being followed cannot  be imaged 
but are assessable by clinical exam.  
 
Clinical  lesions : Clinical  lesions  will only be  considered  measurable when  they are  superficial  (e.g., 
skin nodules  and palpable  lymph nodes) and  10 mm diameter as  assessed  using  calipers (e.g., 
skin nodules).  In the  case  of skin  lesions,  documentation by color  photography,  including a ruler  to 
estimate the size  of the lesion, is recommended . 
 
Chest  x-ray: Lesions on  chest  x-ray are  acceptable  as measurable lesions  when they  are clearly 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT  is preferable.

Conventional  CT and MRI:  This guideline  has defined  measurability of  lesions  on CT scan  based  on 
the assumption  that CT slice  thickness  is 5 mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater 
than 5 mm,  the minimum size  for a measurable lesion should be  twice the slice  thickness . ALL CTs 
SHOULD BE PERFORMED WITHOUT IODINATED  CONTRAST.  
 
MRI is also  acceptable in  certain situations ( e.g. for body scans).  Use of MRI remains  a complex 
issue.  MRI has  excellent contrast,  spatial, and  temporal resolution; however, there are  many  image 
acquisition variables  involved  in MRI,  which  greatly impact image  qualit y, lesion conspicuity,  and 
measurement. Furthermore, the  availability  of MRI is variable globally . As with  CT, if an MRI is 
performed, the technical  specifications  of the scanning sequences  used  should be  optimized for  the 
evaluation  of the type and  site of disease. Furthermore, as with  CT, the modality used at  follow -up 
should be the same  as was  used at  baseline and  the lesions should be  measured/assessed  on the 
same  pulse sequence . It is beyond the scope  of the RECIST  guidelines  to prescribe  specific MRI 
pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts,  and diseases . Ideally,  the same  type of 
scanner  should be  used  and the image acquisition protocol should be  followed as closely as 
possible to  prior scans.  Body scans should  be performed with breath -hold scanning techniques, if 
possible.  
 
PET-CT: At present, the low dose  or attenuation  correction CT  portion of  a combined PET -CT is not 
always of  optimal diagnosti c CT quality  for use with RECIST measurements. However, if the  site can 
document that the CT  performed as  part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a  diagnostic 
CT, then the CT  portion of the PET -CT can be  used for RECIST measurements and can be  used 
interchangeably with  conventional  CT in  accurately measuring cancer  lesions over time. Note, 
however,  that the PET  portion  of the  CT introduces additional  data which  may bias an investigator  if 
it is not routinely or serially performed . 
 
Ultrasound : Ultrasound  is not useful  in assessment of  lesion size  and should not be  used as a 
method  of measurement. Ultrasound  examinations  cannot be  reproduced  in their entirety for 
independent  review at a  later date  and, because  they are  operator  dependent,  it cannot be 
guaranteed  that the same  technique and measurements will  be taken from  one assessment to  the 
next. If new lesions are  identified  by ultrasound in the  course  of the  study,  confirmation by CT  or MRI 
is advised . If there is concern  about radiation exposure at  CT, MRI may  be used instead of CT  in 
selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy : The utilization  of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation  is not 
advised.  However,  such  techniques may  be useful to confirm complete  pathological  response  when 
biopsies are  obtained  or to determine relapse in  trials  where  recurrence  following  complete  response 
(CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 
Cytology, Histology : These  techniques can  be used  to differentiate  between  partial responses  (PR) 
and complete  responses (CR)  in rare cases  (e.g.,  residual lesions in  tumor types, such  as germ  cell 
tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
The cytological confirmation of  the neoplastic origin of  any effusion  that appears or  worsens  during 
treatment when  the measurable  tumor has  met criteria  for response  or stable  disease  is mandatory 
to differentiate  between response  or stable disease (an  effusion may be  a side effect of the 
treatment) and progressive disease.

FOG -PET: While  FOG -PET response assessments need  additional  study, it is sometimes 
reasonable  to incorporate the use  of FOG -PET scanning  to complement CT  scanning  in assessment 
of progression (particularly possible 'new'  disease). New lesions  on the basis of FOG -PET imaging 
can be  identified  according to  the follow ing algorithm:  
 
a. Negative  FOG -PET at baseline, with  a positive  FOG -PET at follow -up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion.  
b.  No FOG -PET at baseline and a  positive FOG -PET at follow -up: If the positive  FOG -PET 
at follow -up corresponds to  a new site  of disease  confirmed by  CT, this is PD . If the 
positive  FOG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed  as a new site of disease  on CT, additional 
follow -up CT  scans  are needed to  determine if  there is  truly progression occurring  at that 
site (if so, the  date of PD will  be the  date of  the initial abnormal FOG -PET scan).  If the 
positive  FOG -PET at follow -up corresponds to  a pre-existing  site of disease on  CT that is 
not progressing on the basis  of the anatomic  images,  this is not PD . 
c. FOG -PET may be used  to upgrade a  response  to a CR in a manner similar  to a biopsy  in 
cases where  a residual radiographic  abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or 
scarring.  The use  of FOG -PET in this circumstance should  be prospectively  described  in 
the protocol and supported  by disease -specific  medical  literature  for the indication . 
However,  it must  be acknowledged  that both approaches  may lead to false positive CR 
due to limitations of FOG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
 
Note: A  'positive'  FOG -PET scan  lesion  means  one which  is FOG  avid with  an uptake greater than 
twice that of  the surrounding tissue on  the attenuation corrected image.  
 
Response  Criteria  
 
Evaluation  of Target  Lesions:  
 
Com  ete Response  (CR) : Disappearance of  all target lesions.  Any pathological  lymph  nodes 
(whether target or non -target)  must  have reduction in  short axis to <10  mm. 
 
Partial Response  (PR) : At least  a 30% decrease  in the sum of the diameters of target  lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline  sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease  (PD) : At least a 20% increase  in the sum  of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the  smallest  sum on study (this  includes the baseline sum  if that is the  smallest 
on study).  In addition to the  relative increase of  20%, the  sum must  also demonstrate an  absolute 
increase of  at least 5  mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progressions).  
 
Stable  Disease  (SD) : Neither  sufficient shrinkage to  qualify  for PR nor sufficient increase  to qualify 
for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on  study.  
 
Evaluation  of Non-Target  Lesions:  
 
Com  ete Response  (CR) : Disappearance of  all non -target lesions and  normalization  of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must  be non -pathological  in size (<10 mm short axis).

IRB Number: 20 -053 A(4)  
Approval  date: 09-Nov-2021   
Note:  If tumor  markers  are initially  above the upper normal  limit,  they must  normalize  for a patient to 
be considered in complete clinical response . 
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence  of one or  more  non-target  lesion(s)  and/or  maintenance of  tumor 
marker level above the normal  limits.  
 
Progressive  Disease  (PD) : Appearance  of one or  more  new lesions  and/or  unequivocal  progression 
of existing non -target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump  target lesion 
status.  It must  be representative of  overall disease status change,  not a  single lesion increase.  
 
Although  a clear  progression of  "non -target"  lesions only is  exceptional,  the opinion  of the treating 
physician should prevail in  such  circumstances,  and the progression status  should be  confirmed at  a 
later time  by the review  panel (or Principal Investigator).  
 
Evaluation  of Best  Overall  Response:  
 
The best overall response is  the best response  recorded from the  start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence  (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since  the treatment started) . The patient's best response assignment will  depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

NOTE:  Patients with clinical and/or  radiographic  evidence  of disease progression  (as described 
above) on  assessments performed before the  6-month evaluation  post-vemurafenib  and copanlisib 
plus 1-131 evaluation (i.e. on  scans  and/or evaluations  performed  prior to the  evaluation  scheduled 
for 6 months after  therapeutic  1-131is co -administered  with vemurafenib/copanlisib)  will be allowed to 
continue  on study treatment and will  be assessed  as mandated by  the protocol, if  deemed clinically 
reasonable  by the treating  physician . For these patients,  the final objective  response  assessment 
will be bas ed on  a comparison between the 6 -month  post-vemurafenib plus 131I radiologic 
scan(s)/evaluations  and the baseline, pretreatment  radiologic scans.  
 
PFS 
 
PFS is defined  as the duration  of time from start of treatment (initiation  of vemurafenib)  to time of 
progression or death, whichever occurs first.  
 
13.0 CRITERIAFOR  REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
 
•  Disease  progression . Hovi.ever,  patients with evidence of clinical disease progression  or 
radiographic  progression (such  as on the  1-124 PET/CTs or  other  scans) before the  6-month 
evaluation  following vemurafenib, copanlisib, and 1 -131 may continue on  the protocol  to 
complete all  mandated assessments  if the treating physician deems it  clinically reasonable.  If 
there is  evidence of  disease p rogression before completing treatment  with vemurafenib  and 
copanlisib,  study  treatment with  these  drugs  and 1-131 will be allowed to  continue  if the treating 
physician deems that such  a decision is clinically  justifiable.  
 
• Initiation  of new drug treatment  for thyroid  cancer.  
 
• Death  
 
• Decision  of patient  to withdraw  from the study.  
 
• Completion  of all planned  study  therapies  and assessments.  
 
 
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS  
The primary objective  of this study is  to determine the MTD of vemurafenib  plus copanlisib in 
patients with advanced  BRAF mutant  RAIR  thyroid cancer . The MTD is  defined as  the highest dose 
at which no  more  than 1 of 6  patients  treated at that dose experience  a DLT.  The dose  levels  of 
vemurafenib  plus copanlisib will be  tested  in a standard 3+3 dose -escalation  design, as outlined in 
Section 9.2 . 
 
If a patient  withdraws from  the study  prior to the  completion of DLT  assessment window  (from  the 
initiation  of copanlisib study treatment to  7 days after completion of  study  drug administration)  for 
reasons other than a DLT, the patient  may be replaced and no DLTwill be  considered to have 
occurred, unless the  Principal Investigator  judges  that the case  should be considered  a DLT.  
 
Patients  who experience  a DLT will  be allowed  to continue  in the study  at a lower  dose,  according  to 
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center 
IRB Number: 20 -053 A(4)  
Approval  date: 09-Nov-2021   
the protocol -specified  dose  modification,  following  recovery  of the toxicity  to grade  =:;;1 or the baseline 
level  of severity.  If a patient experiences  intolerable  or.:::,  Grade  3 toxicities related to  vemurafenib 
before the  first dose  of copanlisib is administered,  this will NOT  be considered a  DLT and the  patient 
will be replaced. The patient can  be taken off  study  OR continue on  protocol with  vemurafenib alone 
with dose reduction per Section 11.0.  
 
In addition  to the formal  DLT evaluation,  longer term  laboratory monitoring will  be conducted up  to 6 
months  following 1 -131 to provide greater insight into the overall safety  of the  study  regimen.  
 
October  2021  amendment: In a prior version of  the protocol, only patients who  received 2  doses of 
copanlisib or experienced  a DLT with just 1  dose  of copanlisib would  have been considered 
evaluable  for DLT.  After four  patients  completed Dose  Level 1,  we observed two  patients receive  1311 
with 2 doses of  copanlisib and two receive only 1 dose of copanlisib without the 1311.No DLTs  were 
observed and no  clear differences in toxicity were  noted between  1 vs.  2 doses of copanlisib  in 
combination with  vemurafenib.  All Grade 3  and higher adverse  events  definitely,  probably and 
possibly related to  vemurafenib,  copanlisib or both  for each  patient  are noted below.  
 
Patient  #1 (2 doses  of copanlisib)  
Grade 3  maculopapular rash,  possibly  related to  copanlisib  and vemurafenib,  not a  DLT given 
improvement to  grade 2 within 7 days . 
 
Patient  #2 (1 dose  of copanlisib)  
- Grade  3 hypertension,  possibly  related to  copanlisib  infusion,  occurred  same  day as  copanlisib 
infusion and  improved to  grade 2  the same  day without  intervention and did not  recur . 
- Grade  3 decreased  lymphocyte  count,  possibly  related  to vemurafenib  (not DLT).  
 
Patient  #3 (1 dose  of copanlisib) : 
Grade  3 maculopapular rash,  probably related to copanlisib  and possibly  related  to vemurafenib,  not 
a DLT given improvement to  grade 2 within 7 days . 
 
Patient  #4 (2 doses  of copanlisib) : 
No Grade  3 or higher  adverse  events  were  observed . 
 
Given the safety  observed thus  far, the  protocol  will include all patients who  have received at  least 1 
dose  of copanlisib  in the DLT evaluation,  regardless of  whether  1-131 is  given. With  this rule, the  first 
four patients  treated at  Dose  Level 1  will count towards  DLT assessment. Since  those  4 patients did 
not experience  a DLT,  the protocol will proceed to  evaluating  Dose  Level  2 according  to the  rules 
outlined  in Section  9.2. With historical redifferentiation rates, we  would then anticipate  that 6 of  the 
10 patients treated at  the MTD  with the planned expansion will have been  treated with  2 doses of 
copanlisib and evaluated  for safety.  
 
Secondary  objectives : 
 
• To determine the proportion of patients  with BRAFmutant RAIR thyroid  cancer  treated with 
vemurafenib and  copanlisib at  the MTD  who meet  the criteria  for 1-131 treatment  as determined  by 
1-124 PET/CT  lesional dosimetry.

Approval  date: 09-Nov-2021   
• To determine the  proportion of  patients  with BRAFmutant RAIR thyroid  cancer  treated with 
vemurafenib and  copanlisib (all  dose  levels) who  meet  the criteria for 1 -131 treatment as 
determined by 1 -124 PET/CT  lesional dosimetry . 
 
• To quantify  the effect of vemurafenib  and copanlisib on  RAI uptake  and retention  using serial 1 -124 
PET/CT  scans.  
 
• To evaluate whether  the combination  of vemurafenib and  copanlisib  enhances  1-131 activity,  by 
determining the ORR (per RECIST v1.1) at 6  months after treatment with vemurafenib  plus 
copanlis  ib and 1 -131. 
 
• To evaluate whether  the combination  of vemurafenib and  copanlisib enhances  1-131 activity, by 
determining progression -free survival  (PFS)  at 6 months (per  RECIST v1.1)  after treatment with 
vemurafenib plus copanlisib and 1 -131. 
 
We will determine the  proportion  of patients with BRAF mutant RAIR thyroid cancer  in which  the 
combination of vemurafenib and copanlisib administered at the  MTD  increases iodine incorporation 
in thyroid  cancer metastases  such  that a dose of  2000  cGy can be delivered  to at least  1 tumor 
with :5300  mCi of 1-131. Once  the MTD  is identified,  up to an  additional  4 patients  will be enrolled  in 
the cohort, to  bring  the total number  of patients treated at  the MTD to  10. As an added precaution for 
safety,  if 2 of the additional  4 patients experience  a DLT,  further  accrual  will be  halted;  the next  dose 
1 level below  will be evaluated  for DLTin  a minimum  of 6 patients,  and expanded  to include  10 total 
if 1 experience DLT.  The proportion  of patients treated at  all vemurafenib  and copanlisib dose 
levels who  experienced  increased  iodine incorporation sufficient to warrant  1-131 treatment will also 
be calculated . The number of patients  with sufficiently increased RAI  uptake to  warrant treatment  
with 1-131 will be analyzed  using proportions and  corresponding confidence intervals.  
We will also  determine the ORR  (per RECIST v1.1) and  the proportion of patients  who are alive 
without disease  progression (per RECIST v1 .1) at the 6 -month  time point (this refers to  the 
assessments designated  to occur  ~6 months  after 1-131 therapy)  for patients who  receive 1 -131 
therapy.  Patients  who have  completed  the second  1-124 PET/CT  and received  1-131 therapy,  but did 
not complete the 6 -month  evaluation,  will be considered to have  had a  progression/death event  for 
the PFS analysis and will  be categorized as  nonresponders  for the ORR  analysis. The ORR will  be 
analyzed using proportions and corresponding confidence intervals.  
It is possible that  patients  will have c linical  or RECIST v1.1 radiologic  evidence of  disease 
progression before  the 6 -month evaluation  for several reasons: (1)  vemurafenib and  copanlisib, 
without the  addition  of 1-131, may  not have significant clinical  efficacy; (2)  Thyrogen stimulation can 
transiently  increase  tumor size,  which can be mistaken for disease progression;  (3) the therapeutic 
effects  of 1-131 can  be delayed;  and (4) evidence of progression  may be present before 
administration  of 1-131. Hence,  patients  with evidence  of disease  progress  ion after 1-131, but  prior to 
the 6 -month evaluation,  may remain on the study to complete  the 6 -month assessments if  the 
treating physician deems  that such  a decision is clinically justifiable . If there is  evidence of  disease 
progression before  completing treatment with  vemurafenib  and copanlisib,  study  treatment with 
these  drugs and  1-131 will be allowed to  continue if the  treating  physician  deems  that such  a 
decision is clinically justifiable.  The final objective  response  and disease progression assessments 
at 6 months  for these patients  will be based on a  comparison  between the 6 -month radiologic 
scan(s)  and the baseline,  prestudy radiologic  scans. However,  if in the opinion  of the treating 
physician, patients  with evidence of  progression before the  6-month assessment are  unlikely  to 
experience benefit by the  6-month time  point, the patients  will be considered to have had  a

progression/death  event for  the PFS analysis,  categorized as  nonresponders  for the  ORR  analysis, 
and removed from the study . 
Patients who  receive  additional  treatment for thyroid cancer  outside of this  protocol  before the 6 - 
month  time point (except  for TSH suppression, palliative  radiation to  a nontarget lesion,  or therapy to 
prevent pathologic  fractures  caused  by bone metastases [e.g ., zoledronic  acid and denosumab]) will 
be considered to have had  a progression/death event  for the  PFS analysis  and will  be categorized 
as nonresponders  for the ORR analysis.  
 
To characterize  how the combination of vemurafenib plus copanlisib affects RAI uptake and 
retention within select  index lesions, we  propose to  analyze  the 4  PET/CT  scans  obtained in  each 
the pretreatment  and on-treatment periods. This analysis will  directly test  our hypothesis that the 
combination of vemurafenib plus copanlisib affects  not only RAI uptake but also  retention within 
thyroid tumors . These data will be analyzed using descriptive  statistics.  
Exploratory  Objectives:  
 
We will perform correlative  studies on  serial  research  biopsy specimens and  archival  tumor  tissue  in 
order  to evaluate the effect  of vemurafenib  on (1) expression and  phosphorylation  of 1\/lAPK  
signaling pathway proteins; (2)  expression and phosphorylation of negative feedback loops 
connected  to the 1\/lAPK pathway (such  as HER3);  (3) quantitative  levels of mRNA  transcripts for 
1\/lAPK,  Pl3K, and  Sl\tlAD signaling pathways, as  well as thyroid -specific  gene products;  and (4) the 
presence  of other genetic  alterations (through the use  of MSK -IMPACT,  supplemented,  if needed, 
by the  RNA Targeted Archer Solid Tumorfusion  panel). These  analyses will be  descriptiv e and  
exploratory,  given  the limited  number  of samples  examined.  Changes  in these  molecular  profiles  will 
be correlated directly  with the changes  in RAI uptake and  retention measured  on the 1-124 PET/CT 
scans . These  data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics.  
Another exploratory  objective will be  to evaluate  time to next thyroid cancer  treatment, tumor size 
changes after study  therapy, serum  thyroglobulin  changes and  survival.  This data will  be important 
for gaining  more  insight into  the degree of  tumor  control that may  be achieved with  vemurafenib  plus 
copanlisib +/ - 1-131. To collect  this data beyond the protocol -mandated  scans  and tests,  an 
observation period to  collect data for up  to 1 year after study  drug discontinuation will be  completed 
for all patients.  Data that to  be collected will include RECIST measurements of  both protocol­ 
mandated scans and  scans conducted as  part of standard of  care. Thyroglobulin/TSH  serum values 
draw on  protocol and  as part  of standard of  care will also  be collected. Other data to  be collected  are 
survival status  and initiation  of new treatments (radiation,  surgery  and drug therapy). If RECST 
disease  progression  and initiation  of drug therapy,  or death, is  observed,  the observation phase  may 
be discontinued.  Data encompassing this observation  phase may  also be collected/analyzed 
retrospectively. This exploratory analysis will be conducted using descriptive statistics.  
Sample  size:  6-32 patients.  We plan to  accrue  about  1-2 patient(s)  per month  for a total accrual 
time of 1 -2 years . 
 
 
15.0 RESEARCH  PARTICIPANT  REGISTRATION  AND  RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURES  
15.1 Research  Participant  Registration  
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center

Approval  date: 09-Nov-2021   
Confirm  eligibility  as defined in  the section  entitled  Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria. Obtain 
informed consent, by  following procedures defined in section  entitled  Informed Consent 
Procedures.  During  the registration process  registering individuals  will be  required to 
complete  a protocol  specific  Eligibility  Checklist.  The individual  signing  the Eligibility  Checklist 
is confirming  whether  or not  the participant  is eligible  to enroll in the  study. Study staff  are 
responsible for  ensuring that  all institutional requirements  necessary  to enroll a participant to 
the study have been  completed. See related Clinical Research  Policy and  Procedure #401 
(Protocol Participant Registration).  
 
15.2 Randomization  
 
Not applicable.  
16.0 DATA  MANAGEMENT  ISSUES  
A Clinical Research  Coordinator  (CRC)  will be assigned to  the study.  The responsibilities of 
the CRC  include project compliance,  data collection, abstraction and entry, data reporting, 
regulatory  monitoring,  problem  resolution  and prioritization, and  coordinating  the activities  of 
the protocol study team.  
The data collected  for this study  will be  entered into a  secure  database, Medidata  Rave . 
Source documentation will  be available  to support the computerized patient record . 
16.1 Quality  Assurance  
 
Weekly  registration  reports will  be generated  to monitor patient  accruals and  completeness 
of registration data . Routine data quality reports will be  generated  to assess missing  data 
and inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates and  extent  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow -up will 
be monitored periodically throughout the study  period  and potential problems  will be brought 
to the attention of the study team for discussion and action . 
 
 
16.2 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data  and Safety Monitoring  Plan utilized  for this study  must  align with  the  MSK DSM  
Plan, where applicable . 
 
The Data  and Safety Monitoring  (DSM) Plans  at Memorial Sloan Kettering were  approved by 
the National  Cancer  Institute in  August  2018. The  plans address  the new  policies set  forth by 
the NCI in  the document  entitled  "Policy  of the National  Cancer  Institute for Data  and Safety  
Monitoring  of Clinical Trials ." 
 
There are several different  mechanisms by  which  clinical studies are monitored for data, 
safety and quality. At a departmental/Pl  level there exists procedures for  quality  control  by 
the research team(s) . Institutional  processes in  place for quality assurance  include protocol 
monitoring, compliance  and data verification audits, staff  education on clinical research  QA 
and two  institutional  committees that are responsible for monitoring  the activities  of our 
clinical  trials programs.  The committees:  Data  and Safety Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC) for 
Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB) for  Phase  Ill 
clinical trials, report to the Deputy Physician -in-Chief,  Clinical Research.  
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center 
IRB Number: 20 -053 A(4)  
Approval  date: 09-Nov-2021   
During  the protocol  development  and review process,  each  protocol will  be assessed  for its 
level of risk  and degree of monitoring required.  
 
The MSK DSMB monitors  phase  Ill trials and  the DSMC monitors  non-phase Ill  trials.  The 
DSMB/C have oversight over the following trials:  
 
• MSK  Investigator  Initiated  Trials  (IITs;  MSK  as sponsor)  
• External  studies  where MSK  is the data coordinating  center  
• Low risk studies  identified  as requiring  DSMB/C  review  
 
The DSMC  will initiate  review  following  the enrollment  of the first participanUor  by the  end of 
the year  one if no accruals  and will continue  for the study  lifecycle  until there are  no 
participants  under  active therapy  and the protocol  has closed  to accrual. The  DSMB  will 
initiate  review  once the protocol  is open  to accrual.  
 
17.0 PROTECTION  OF HUMAN  SUBJECTS  
 
Inclusion of  Children  in Research  
This protocol/project  does not include children, because  the number of children with this 
disease is  limited and because the  majority  of affected children are already accessed  by a 
nationwide  pediatric  cancer  research  network . This statement is based  on exclusion  4b of  the 
NIH Policy and  Guidelines  on the Inclusion of Children  as Participants  in Research  Involving 
Human Subjects . 
Risks,  Benefits,  Toxicities/Side  Effects  
Potential risks  to human  subjects  include  drug-related toxicities, placement of  IV catheters, 
phlebotomy,  and possible  psychological  discomfort from  the stresses associated  with 
obtaining  imaging studies (e .g., CT scan,  PET scan) . All efforts will  be made  to avoid any 
complication by  completely reviewing patients' symptoms,  providing appropriate 
management, and monitoring  blood tests.  
If an adverse  medical  event  occurs, the  patient  will first contact the  primary oncologist  or the 
Principal  Investigator.  At nights  and on weekends,  there  is an oncology  physician  on call at 
all times. Patients  may either  call or  come directly  to the urgent  care center  at Memorial 
Hospital  (or to their  local emergency  room) to  be seen.  Patients  suffering  serious  adverse 
reactions  must be  carefully  followed  and all  follow -up information  also recorded.  
Alternatives/0ptions  
Participation  in this trial is voluntary. Depending on  the specific  details  of the situation,  patient 
options without being in  a study might include:  
• Other  palliative  chemotherapy  off-study.  
 
• Participation  in a different  clinical  trial. 
 
• Best supportive  care.  
 
Financial  Costs/Burdens  
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center 
IRB Number: 20 -053 A(4)  
Approval  date: 09-Nov-2021   
The patient will be  responsible for all  costs related to  treatment and complications of 
treatment. Costs  to the patient (third -party insurer)  will include hospitalizations,  routine blood 
tests  and diagnostic studies,  office visits,  baseline EKG,  and doctor  fees.  Patients will not be 
charged the cost  of analysis for the research  correlates. Bayer will  financially  support the 
study, and Copanlisib will be  supplied by Bayer. The  patient  will not be charged for the 
subsequent research  analysis of these  specimens. Vemurafenib  is an  NCCN compendium­ 
approved medication. Serial 1 -124 lesion dosimetry scans  will be supported through R01 
CA201250 -03. 
17.1 Privacy  
MSK's Privacy Office  may allow the use  and disclosure of protected health information 
pursuant to  a completed  and signed Research  Authorization  form. The use  and disclosure  of 
protected health information  will be limited to the  individuals  described  in the  Research 
Authorization  form.  A Research  Authorization  form must  be completed by the Principal 
Investigator  and approved  by the IRB and Privacy Board (IRB/PB) . 
17.2 Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  Reporting  
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY  of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
•  An adverse  event that  results  in inpatient hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing 
hospitalization  
•  A persistent or  significant incapacity  or substantial disruption  of the  ability to  conduct 
normal life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events (IME)  that may not result in death, be  life threatening,  or 
require hospitalization  may be considered serious  when,  based upon  medical  judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or  subject and  may require medical  or surgical 
intervention  to prevent one of  the outcomes listed  in this definition  
Note : Hospital admission  for a planned procedure/disease  treatment is  not considered an 
SAE.  
 
SAE reporting is required as soon  as the participant signs consent.  SAE reporting is 
required  for 30-days  after the  participant's  last investigational  treatment  or intervention.  Any 
events that occur  after the 30 -day period and  that are  at least possibly related to protocol 
treatment must be reported.  
 
If an SAE requires submission  to the IRB office  per IRB SOP  RR-408 'Reporting of Serious 
Adverse Events', the SAE  report must  be sent to the IRB within 5  calendar days of the  event. 
The IRB requires a Clinical Research  Database  (CRDB) SAE report  be submitted 
electronically to the SAE Office as follows:  
For IND/IDE  trials: Reports that include a  Grade 5 SAE should be  sent to 
saegrade5@mskcc .org. All other reports should be sent to   saemskind@mskcc .org. 
 
For all other trials: Reports that include a  Grade 5  SAE should be sent  to 
saegrade5@mskcc .org. All other reports should be sent to   sae@mskcc .org.

report will be  forwarded to  the FDA by  the SAE staff through the  IND Office  
 
17.2.1  Other Adverse Events Reporting 
Adverse events of special safety interest  
On the basis  of data from clinical studies of  copanlisib in patients with lymphoma, as 
soon as  there is reasonable suspicion of  the following  adverse event, the  investigator 
should im mediately notify Bayer (within 24 h),  regardless of whether the event is 
assessed  as causally related/not  related to  the study  drug or as  serious/nonserious.  The 
adverse event of special  interest  should be  entered on  an SAE form; if the event is 
assessed  as nonserious, the nonserious assessment should  be noted in  the form.  
• Noninfectious  pneumonitis  (NIP)  
 
 
 
Pregnancies  
The investigator  must  report  all pregnancies  occurring  in female study  patients during 
their participation  in this study. The outcome  of the pregnancy  should  be followed up 
carefully,  and any outcome  of the  mother  and the  child  at delivery should be  reported.

Appendix  B: 1-124 PET  /CT-based Lesional  Dosimetry  Image  Acquisition, 
Analysis, and Interpretation  
 
The 1-124 PET/CT  scan  will be  performed on  a PET/CT  scanner 2  days after administration  of 5-7 
mCi of 1-124, the time  at which  maximal uptake of  iodide  by thyroid tumors  generally  occurs.  The 
index lesion (i.e.,  metastatic thyroid tumor) will  be identified by radiology  coinvestigators.  The index 
lesion  volume  (in milliliters),  V1esion,  will be estimated  by the CT study  performed  for attenuation 
correction  and anatomic  registration  as part of the 1-124 PET/CT  scan  on the PET/CT  scanner.  This 
"low-dose" attenuation -correction CT  scan  will be  performed without  contrast  or (respiratory) gating 
and with  acquisition and processing  parameters routinely  used  for such  scans at  the participating 
sites. Once  reconstructed, and using the  commercial image -processing  software provided  on the 
PET/CT  scanner's computer or a compatible networked workstation, regions of interest (ROls) 
circumscribing  the index lesion  on all contiguous  CT slices on which  the lesion appears will be 
drawn,  yielding  V1esion.  Only  lesions  on the first 1-124 PET/CT  scan  that are ::_5 mm in  length  in 
the maximal  diameter will be  used  as an index  lesion for this  analysis.  
Using the PET acquisition and processing parameters routinely  used  for PET/CT  scans,  the 
reconstructed  PET images  will be parameterized,  as usual, in  terms  of standard  uptake value  (SUV) 
(= µCi measured by PET/g of tissue/ µCi  administered/g of total body mass) . Using  the commercial 
image -processing  software provided  on the PET/CT  scanner's computer or a compatible 
workstation, ROls circumscribing  the index lesion on  all contiguous PET slices on which  the lesion  
 
appears  will be drawn,  yielding  the index  lesion  mean  SUV, SUV  lesion;  alternatively,  the lesion  ROls 
drawn on  the CT sca n (see above)  may be  superimposed on  the registered PET  images to  yield  
 
SUV1esion.  From the definition of the SUV (above), the mean PET -derived 1 -124 concentration (in 
µCi/ml)  in the  index  lesion not corrected for  partial -volume -averaging,  ( [1241A] lesion)RC -uncorrected, will 
be calculated from SUV  lesion:  
 
( [124 1A] lesion)RC -uncorrected  -- AA 
= SUV1esion  Mm (1) 
 
where  AA is the 1-124 administered  activity  (in µCi) and Mrs is the patient  total body  mass  (in µCi).  
 
Note that the  SUVs  provided by the  PET scanner  are not automatically corrected  for partial -volume 
averaging . Using  the CT-derived  lesion  volume,  V1esion,  and the volume  (V)--dependent  recovery 
coefficient (i.e., PET -derived activity concentration [in  µCi/ml]/actual  activity concentration [in 
µCi/ml]), RC(V),  previously  measured  for the PET/CT  scanner,  the PET -derived mean 1 -124 
concentration  (in µCi/ml) in  the index  lesion  not corrected  for partial -volume  averaging,  ([1241A] 
1esion)Rc -uncorrected,  will be corrected  to yield  the actual mean  1-124 concentration in the  index lesion,

The mean 1 -124 activity  concentration in the index lesion per 1 -124 administered  activity (in 
µCi/ml/mCi),  ( [1241 A_ier  mci] lesion)Rc -corrected, will  then be calculated:  
 
 
( [124 I A_ier mCi] lesion)RC -corrected  = ([1241 A]lesion)RC -corrected  
 
AA/1000  (3) 
( [1241 A_ier  mCi] lesion)RC -corrected  can be converted to the mean 1 -131 activity concentration in the index 
lesion per 1 -131 administered activity (in µCi/mUmCi),  ( [131I A_iermCi]  lesion)RC -corrected,  1-131 (and not 1- 
124)  being  used  for therapy:  
 
 
( [131 I A_ier  mCi] lesion)RC -corrected  = ( [124 I A_ier mCi] lesion)RC -corrected  eP.-I124- "-l131)timaging  (4) 
 
where 11,1124  and 11,1131  are the physical  decay constants of 1 -124 (0.00693/h)  and 1-131 (0.00359/h), 
respectively,  and !imaging  is the  time after administration  of PET/CT imaging  (in hours).  
On the basis of  prior clinical experience,  the biological  half-life, Tb, of iodine  in metastatic thyroid 
cancer lesions  is typically  2 d (48 h) to 4 d (96 h), which  will be the  assumed range of  biologic  half­ 
life used in these calculations.  For 1 -131, with a physical half -life TP of 8.04  d = 193 h,  the effective 
half-life, Te, of 1-131 in the  index  lesion is  therefore  (if assuming 48 h biologic  half-life): 
 
Te = 
 
 
=  Tb Tp  
Tb+ Tp (5a) 
 
48 h • 193 h  
48 h + 193 h (5b) 
 
= 38.4 h (5c) 
 
Assuming, as  usual, that the  uptake  of radioiodine  in the index lesion  (i.e., the  24- to 48-h uptake 
value)  will be instantaneous and  that 1-131 lesion  irradiation  will be due exclusively to  complete  local  
 
absorption  of 1-131 beta rays,  the mean  lesion absorbed  dose  (in rad/mCi  1-131),  [1311Opermci]  lesion, 
will be:  
 
[131I Oper mCi] lesion  = 1.44 Te ( [131I A_ier  mCi] lesion)RC -corrected  np (6a) 
 
 
= 1.44 • 38.4 h ( [1311A_ier  mCi] lesion}RC -corrected

where  L'.1np = 0.405 g -rad/µCi -h is the equilibrium  dose constant  for nonpenetrating  radiations (i.e., 
beta rays) for 1 -131. 
Finally,  the 1-131 administered  activity  (in mCi)  required to  deliver  the stipulated  mean  absorbed 
dose  of 2,000 rad  to the  index lesion,  1311Mooo  rad lesion,  will be:  
131 I AA2000  rad lesion   = 2,000  rad/[131I Oper  mci]lesion  (7) 
 
 
 
If the projected 1311Mooo  rad lesion  is reasonable  ( 300 mCi)  (assuming  a 48h to  96 h iodine biologic 
half-life), the Principal  Investigator  and the  Co-lnvestigator(s) will  decide whether 1 -131 therapy 
should proceed . 
While  the foregoing  analysis will  be performed on data  from the  second  1-124 PET/CT scan 
performed  at ~48 hours  after 1-124 with the noted  assumptions  about  the biologic  half-life of iodine, 
per the Principal  Investigator's  discretion,  the decision  to proceed  with therapeutic 1 -131 could  also 
be determined after  the biologic  half-life has been  calculated from  the full  complement  of 1-124 
PET/CT  images collected (completed by D1x15 according to  Table 10.2).

Appendix  C: The Low -Iodine  Diet 
 
What  is iodine?  
Iodine  is a mineral. It plays an  important role in  several processes  thattake place  in the body. One  is 
the production of a hormone called thyroxine,  which  occurs in  the thyroid gland.  
 
Where  is iodine  found?  
The amount of iodine found in  food varies. Much of  the iodine we  get comes from  iodized salt  and 
breads.  Adults need 150  micrograms  of iodine a  day. This booklet  describes a  low-iodine diet. This 
is a diet with less than 50  micrograms of  iodine per day.  
 
Why  is a low-iodine  diet necessary?  
The iodine  in your  diet can block  the uptake  of radioactive  iodine  by the  thyroid  gland.  Your  doctor 
could  put you on a low-iodine  diet 1 or 2 weeks  before  you get the radioactive  iodine.  Stay on this 
diet until your test or treatment  is complete.  Your  doctor  will tell  you when  to begin  and when to stop 
this diet. If you have  any questions,  speak  with your doctor.  You may also see a dietitian  if 
necessary.  If you have  any questions  about  your diet, call (212)  639-7312  to speak  to a dietitian.  
 
What  should  you avoid?  
 
Read  all food labels  to check  for iodine  content.  Do NOT  eat or use: 
• Iodized  salt 
• Sea salt in any form 
• Onion  salt 
• Celery  salt 
• Garlic  salt 
• Seasoned  salt 
• Kelp (seaweed)  
• Any food that has: 
o lodates  
o Iodides  
o Algin  
o Alginates  
o Carrageen  
o Agar 
• Commercial  breads  and bakery  products,  because  they often  contain  iodate.  
• Milk (except  for 1 ounce  a day),  eggs,  and seafood  
• Vitamins  and food supplements,  if they have iodine.  If you  have  any doubt,  do not take them  
• Food, pills,  or capsules  with food  dyes or  that are  orange, red,  or brown  in color.  Examples include 
red or pink cereals or candies  
• Antiseptics,  such  as tincture  of iodine  (Betadine)  applied  on a cut 
• Cough  medicines  (especially those  with red coloring)  
• Supplements  such  as: 
o Ensure  
o Boost  
o Commercial shakes  
o Nutrament  
• Restaurant  and processed  foods,  because  they are often  high in  iodine  content.  
• Soy products,  such  as edamame,  tofu, and soy burgers  (e.g., Boca)  
• All canned  foods,  because  the lining  of the can contains  iodine  
 
Do not stop taking any of  your medicines  unless your  doctor  tells you to.  If you are receiving  tube­ 
feeding formula, ask  your dietitian or doctor  what to  do. This low -iodine diet does not meet the 
suggested daily allowance for all  nutrients.  You will  be on  it for a  short time  only.

Following screening, eligible subjects will enter a two week  
flexible baseline period, at which time the IA diary will be i ssued 
to the subject’s primary caregiver.  At the end of the two week  
baseline period, eligible subjects whose primary caregiver has 
maintained at least 80% compliance with the IA diary will be 
randomized 1:1:1 to 18  mg/day SPN -810, 36  mg/day SPN -810, or 
placebo.    To give caregivers the 
opportunity to improve

This document is confidential.  It contains proprietary information of Supernus® Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Any viewing or disclosure 
of such information that is not authorized in writing by the Sponsor is strictly prohibited.  Such information may be used solely 
for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. Screening will take place for up to 28 45 days prior to 
randomization and may be carried out over more than one visit 
if necessary.   
3.2.1.1  27 The following was added:  
Staff at study sites are encouraged to complete screening 
procedures as early as possible to provide more flexibility in 
the baseline period for the caregivers to achieve IA diary 
compliance (see Section 3.2.1.2).  For clarification  
3.2.1.2  28 The following was changed:  
Subjects who meet study entry requirements will proceed to the 
two week  flexible 15 -day baseline period.  At Visit 2  primary and 
(if assigned) secondary caregivers will receive training on the use 
of the IA diary.  A an IA diary device (LogPad) will be issued to the 
primary caregiver.  The primary and (if assigned) secondary 
caregivers will receive training on the use of  the IA diary. Every 
effort will be made to provide adequate caregiver training on 
the use of the IA diary at Visit 2 and acknowledgement of 
training will be captured on the device.  The caregiver will be 
instructed to maintain the diary for two weeks.  At the end of 
this period, caregiver compliance with the IA diary will be 
assessed.   
Following at least 15 days of IA diary use, caregiver compliance 
with the IA diary will be assessed.  Compliance will be 
calculated as the percentage of days over the past 1 5 days  
during the baseline period for which an evening diary was 
completed.  Compliance of at least 80% must be demonstrated 
to continue into the titration period and to be eligible for 
randomization. Compliance will be measured by the percentage 
of evenin g diary entries completed during the baseline period. 
Subjects whose caregivers demonstrate at least 80% 
compliance  will be eligible for randomization and continue 
into the titration period.  
Subjects whose caregivers do not reach 80% compliance during 
the first 15 days of the baseline period may be allowed to 
continue to use the diary for up to 15 additional days.  For 
these subjects, caregivers will receive remedial training on the 
use of the  IA diary.  During this time, caregiver compliance with 
the IA diary will be monitored daily by study site personnel 
over the past 15 -days as a “rolling window”.  When the 
caregivers’ performance with the IA diary improves such that 
the caregivers are able  to demonstrate at least 80% compliance 
over the past 15 -day rolling window, the subject will be eligible 
for randomization and allowed to continue into the titration 
period.  
Although there are up to 30 days available for  each of the 
screening and the b aseline period, the total duration of 
screening and baseline periods may not exceed 45 days.  
Rescreening  
As a general rule, rescreening of subjects is not allowed.  The 
only exception to this will be for subjects who had failed 
screening due to caregiver non -compliance with the IA diary 
under protocol version 3.0. These subjects may be rescreened To give caregivers the 
opportunity to improve 
diary compliance

Synopsis  17 Sample size : 
The following was changed : 
 
It is assumed that approximately 20% subjects will dropout 
before the completion of the study and hence, an adjusted total 
of 291 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to obtain 231  
subjects in the ITT population at the completion of the study.   
Based on the 810P301 study Interim Analysis result decision,

To preserve the overall Type I error rate at 0.050 for the primary 
efficacy endpoint, a step up Hochberg procedure (Hochberg  
1988) will be used to compare SPN 810 36 mg dose group with 
Placebo. If the observed p value from the comparison is < 0.050 
in favor of the SPN 810 dose group, then 36mg dose group will 
be declared statistically significantly better than placebo.  
 
The superiority of 36 mg dose to placebo will be claimed if the 
p-value from this analysis < 0.05 at alpha of 5% significance 
level. There is no multiplicity adjustment with respect to the

To preserve the overall type I error rate at 0.05 for the 
secondary endpoints, a sequential testing procedure will be used 
with the following features. First only dose or doses that are 
significantly different from placebo for the primary endpoint will 
be tested for secondary endpoints. The first of the secondary 
endpoints will be compared to placebo using the Hochberg step 
up pr ocedure but only using those doses retained as a result of 
testing the primary endpoint. The second secondary endpoint 
will be tested in the same manner but only using those doses 
that were retained from the primary and the first secondary 
endpoint and so forth. As the endpoints are gone through in the 
predefined order doses will only be retained if significant for all 
endpoints tested so far and at the given stage the Hochberg 
step up procedure will be applied.  
The ordering of the  6 secondary endpoints f rom first to be 
tested to sixth is: Investigator Clinical Global Impression  
Improvement  Scale (CGI I)(Endpoint 1), Clinical Global

Synopsis  25 Sample size:  
Based on results from the Phase 2 study, it is assumed that the  a 
15-point  average difference in favor of the SPN -810 treatment 
difference between SPN 810 dose groups and  arms compared 
with  placebo is 15 with  assumed; the change from baseline to 
endpoint in total R -MOAS rating was used to evaluate the 
difference. The R -MOAS was used because there have been no 
prior studies with the IA diary.   A common standard deviation of 
27.3. A  34.83 was obtained from a blin ded analysis of SPN -
810P301 data.  Based on these parameter assumptions,  a 
sample size of 77 122 subjects per arm (231 subjects for 3 arms)   
will yield 90% power to detect a non -zero difference between 
the median of 18 mg or 36 mg dose group  SPN-810 treatme nt 
and the placebo groups  using the Wilcoxon rank -sum test with a 
2-sided significance level alpha  α=0.05.

After  the 810P301 study Interim Analysis result decision, the 18 
mg dose arm was dropped partway through the study. As a 
result, subjects in was completed , the 18 mg dose arm will was

mg arm would  be re -randomized allocated to the 36 mg or 
placebo arm in a ratio of 2:1 to receive 36 mg/day SPN 810 or 
placebo . As such there will be an unequal randomization 
between the 36 mg dose group and placebo. With th is post -
interim analysis un -equal randomization,  the placebo arm is 
expected to approach approximately 121 subjects of the total 
of 306 subjects randomized.

Population as follows:  
 
Scores of CGI -I  (investigator and caregiver) will be analyzed 
using a Mixed -Effect Model for Repeated Measure (MMRM) 
similar to the key secondary outcome.  
 
Scores for CHQ -PF28, PS I-4-SF, and SNAP -IV will be analyzed 
using the  analysis of covariance method based on the ITT 
population with missing data imputed using the Last Observation 
Carried Forward (LOCF) method . The model includes treatment 
and baseline as fixed independent cova riates and change from 
baseline to final maintenance visit  Visit 6 value  as a response 
variable.  
 
The superiority of 36 mg dose to placebo will be claimed if the p
value < 0.05 at alpha 5% significance level. There is no 
multiplicity adjustment with respec t to the primary endpoint 
since only 2 treatments groups are compared.  
 
The Type I error rate of the tests involving the secondary efficacy 
endpoints will be controlled by the Hochberg’s method at the 
0.05 two sided level.  
 
The percentage of responders with at least 30% reduction and 
with at least 50% reduction in the frequency of IA behaviors 
per 7 days in the Treatment (Titration and Maintenance) period 
relative to the Baseline period will be derived analyzed using 
the logi stic regression model with treatment as explanatory 
variables and baseline as covariate. Odds ratio (36 mg 
dose/placebo), and 95% CI for the odds ratio and p -value will 
be presented. In addition, the number and percentage of 
responders will also be tabulat ed. 
  
If the null hypothesis for the primary analysis is not rejected, 
then no multiplicity adjustment will be done for the key 
secondary endpoint. If the key secondary endpoint hypothesis 
is rejected then, a sequential testing procedure to preserve the 
type I error rate at 0.05 will be conducted for the ad ditional 
secondary endpoints as described below:

Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change  (PCH T) in the frequency  (unweighted score)  of IA 
behaviors per 7 days in the Treatment (Titration and Maintenance) period relative to the Baseline 
period calculated over the number of days with non -missing IA diary  data.     
 
The primary efficacy endpoint PCH T will be calculated  by PCH T= 100*( T – B)/B, where T and B are IA 
behavior frequencies per 7 days during the treatment period and baseline period , respectively. The IA 
behavior frequency per 7 days is defined as (S UM/DAY) x 7, where S UM  is  the total  of the IA 
behaviors  reported in the subject IA diary, and D AY is the number of days with non -missing IA score   
in the subject IA diary  during the specified study period .

Sample size:  
Based on results from the Phase 2 study, a 15-point average difference in favor of the SPN -810 
treatment arms compared with placebo is assumed ; the change from baseline to endpoint in total R -
MOAS rating  was used to evaluate the difference.  The R -MOAS was used because there have been no 
prior studies with the IA diary.  A common standard deviation of 34.83 was obtained from a blinded 
analysis of SPN -810P301 data.  Based on these parameter assumptions, a sample siz e of 122 subjects 
per arm will yield 90% power to detect a non -zero difference between the median of SPN -810 
treatment and the placebo groups using the Wilcoxon rank -sum test with a 2 -sided significance level 
α=0.05.  
 
The original sample size of 291 was ba sed on having 3 treatment groups (97 subjec ts per arm) and 
specific assumptions on the drug placebo difference, standard deviation and discontinuation rate.   
 
After the 810P301 study In terim Analysis result was completed, t he 18 mg dose arm was discontinued

Safety Population :  will include all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population :  will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug 
and have a baseline and at least 1 valid post -randomizatio n assessment of frequency of IA  behaviors 
based on IA  diary entry.  
Per-Protocol (PP) Population :  will include all of the subjects in the ITT population who completed the 
treatment period with 80% diary completion compliance and who did not have major prot ocol 
deviations.  
PK population :  will include  all subjects in the safety population  who had at least one PK sample 
drawn which had a quantitatable concentration for at least one analyte of interest . 
Hypothes is: 
Per the adaptive design feature of protocol 810P301 that led to discontin uation of the 18 mg dose 
group,  SPN-810 36 mg vs. placebo will be tested.  
The null (H 0) and the alternative (H a) hypotheses are as in the following.  
 H01: There is no difference between the median of the 36 mg dose SPN-810 and t he median of 
placebo vs. H a1: There is a difference between the median of the 36 mg dose SPN-810  and 
the median of placebo . 
Handling Missing Data:  
For the primary efficacy endpoint, the frequency of IA behaviors during the Treatment period will be 
calcul ated over the number of days with non -missing IA diary data in the Treatment  period. No 
explicit imputation of missing data will be used, but this approach is implicitly equivalent to using the 
frequency of IA behaviors during the days with non -missing IA diary data to impute the frequency for 
days after study discontinuation and days with missing IA diary data.

percent change in the frequency  (unweighted score) of IA behaviors per 7 days in the Treatment 
(Titration and Maintenance) period relative to the Baseline  period in the ITT population calculated 
over the number of days with non -missing IA diary  data.  
 
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed using the Wilcoxon rank -sum test to compare the 
median of SPN -810 36 mg and the median of the Placebo.  The Hodges -Lehmann estimate and the 
associated 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated .   
 
The k ey secondary endpoint will be analized using Mixed -Effect Mode l for Repeated Measure 
(MMRM). The model includes treatment, visit, and interaction between treatment and visit as fixed 
factors, and baseline as covariate.  The between -group comparison will be performed using the simple 
contrast at the respective visits.  The least squares means for 36 mg dose and placebo, the difference 
in the least squares mean (36 mg dose minus placebo), and the 2 -sided 95% CI for the difference will 
be calculated at Visit 6 u sing the simple contrast.   
 
The other  secondary endpoints will be analyzed as follows:  
 Actual scores of CGI -I  (investigator and caregiver) will be analyzed using a Mixed -Effect 
Model for Repeated Measure (MMRM) similar to the key secondary outcome . 
 Actual Scores for CHQ -PF28, PSI -4-SF, and SNAP -IV will be analyzed using the analysis of 
covariance method based on the ITT population . The model includes treatment and baseline 
as fixed independent covariates and Visit 6 value as a response variable. The least squares 
mean of each treatment group, the difference in the  least squares mean (36 mg dose minus 
placebo), and the 2 -sided 95% CI for the difference will be obtained.  
 The percentage of responders with at least 30% reduction  and with at least 50% reduction  in 
the frequency of IA behaviors per 7 days in the Treatment (Titration  and Maintenance) period 
relative to the Baseline period will be derived analyzed using the logistic regression model 
with treatment as explanatory variables  and baseline as cova riate . Odds ratio (36 mg 
dose/p lacebo), and 95% CI for the odds ratio and p -value will be presented.  In addition, the 
number and percentage of responders will also be tabulated . 
  
Interim analysis:  
There will be no planned interim analysis.  
 
Safety analysi s: 
Safety  analyses  will be based on the safety population.   All AEs will be coded using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and will be summarized using discrete summaries at 
the subject and event level by system organ class and preferred term for each treatment group.  
Similarly, treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized by severity and relationship separately.  Vital 
signs will be summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment groups.  The summary includes 
sample size, mean, and standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum.  Contin uous laboratory 
parameters will be summarized similarly.  If applicable, categorical laboratory tests will be 
summarized using number and percent of subjects by treatment groups.   Data on infrequent

1.1 Background 
Behavior with the immediate intent to cause harm – whether to self, others, objects, or property – 
constitutes aggression. Aggressive behavior becomes maladaptive when it persists, occurs outside an 
acceptable social context, and is of an intensity, frequency, severity and/or duration detrimental to the 
child’s interests  (Connor 2006; Jensen 2007). Maladaptive aggression is an expression of central nervous 
system dysfunction and may therefore be amenable to treatments targeting its neurobiologic substrate.  
Aggression can be categorized into two broad subtypes based on the aggressor’s motivation –  1) 
reactive or impulsive and 2) proactive or instrumental (Vitiello 1997). Impulsive aggression (IA) is angry, 
retaliatory aggression arising out of frustration, annoyance, or hostility to real or perceived provocations 
– stressors that youth of the same age typically experience with equanimity. IA is therefore an 
unplanned and immediate response reflecting out- of-control emotionality that satisfies immediate 
emotional pressures, albeit with negative consequences to the aggressor. In contrast, instrumental 
aggression is consciously planned, goal-oriented behavior with the specific intent of benefiting the 
aggressor (Jensen 2007) .   
IA is commonly associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is often refractory to 
primary ADHD therapy. In the Multimodal Treatment of Children with ADHD (MTA) study (MTA 1999), 
54% of preadolescent study participants with ADHD Combined subtype displayed clinically significant 
aggression at baseline. Of these, 44% remained significantly symptomatic in terms of aggressive 
behavior after 14 months of optimal medication (stimulants) with/without behavioral therapy (Jensen 
2007).  
IA amplifies the psychological, academic, emotional, and social problems associated with ADHD (Shelton 
1998), markedly increasing the risk of persistent behavioral problems, conduct disorder, encounters 
with the justice system, deficits in academic achievement, behavioral and disciplinary problems at 
school, and substance experimentation/abuse. Early-onset, pervasive and unremitting IA in the context 
of impulsive thoughts, emotional lability, and impulsive behavior is thought to represent a high-risk 
profile for progression from childhood ADHD to adult antisocial disorders (McKay 2001). In the context 
of ADHD it represents a serious clinical and public health concern and warrants effective and timely 
intervention. 
Since primary ADHD therapy has limited effect on IA, a stepped-care approach has been recommended, 
with aggression-targeted therapy such as an antipsychotic added to ADHD therapy to manage residual 
aggressive behaviors (Scotto Rosato 2012). Risperidone and other “atypical” antipsychotics have 
historically been at the forefront of treatment recommendations regarding combination therapy for 
managing aggression associated with ADHD in children (Pappadopulos et al. 2003; Pliszka et al. 2006; 
Pliszka et al. 2007). However, only two double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials of risperidone 
as adjunctive therapy in children with ADHD and aggression refractory to stimulants have been 
published –  1) a pilot study in 25 children that was likely underpowered and did not detect a significant 
treatment effect (Armenteros 2007; Aman 2014) and 2) the recently completed TOSCA (Treatment of

risperidone’s effect on IA was small (0.29), even though the dosage could be adjusted to optimal effect . 
The TOSCA study provides initial empirical evidence supporting a stepped-care approach in which ADHD 
children with severe aggression are initially treated with primary ADHD therapy followed by adjunctive 
antipsychotic therapy targeted to IA.  However, the long-term effects of risperidone and similar 
antipsychotics in terms of metabolic derangements predictive of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, 
have become cause for considerable concern, especially in the face of very limited evidence of efficacy 
as aggressi on-targeted therapy in ADHD.   The TOSCA study confirmed that stimulant co-therapy does 
not attenuate the adverse effects of risperidone or similar agents on body composition, metabolic 
parameters, prolactin, or sedation (Calarge 2009; Penzner 2009). 
Molindone hydrochloride (molindone) is a medium potency antipsychotic, and is currently under 
development by the Sponsor as an extended-release formulation (SPN-810), for its potential utility in 
treating IA in children with ADHD.  
In an open-label study, molindone improved aggressive behavior in children (N=6, 6-11 years of age) 
with undersocialized conduct disorder, aggressive type (Greenhill 1981).  The optimum dose was 0.5 
mg/kg/day.  Molindone was also shown to be effective in treating aggressive behavior in a double-blind, 
8-week, inpatient study of 31 children, ages 6 to 11, with undersocialized conduct disorder, aggressive 
type (Greenhill 1985).  
Prior to its withdrawal from the US market for commercial reasons, Immediate-Release Molindone 
(Moban®) was approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and adolescents. Its use was also 
evaluated in a pediatric population with early-onset schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder when it 
was selected as the first-generation antipsychotic on the basis of its more favorable safety profile for 
comparison with second-generation agents (risperidone, olanzapine) in an NIH-sponsored study (TEOSS, 
Treatment of Early-Onset Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders Study) (McClellan 2007). At an average 
dose of 60 mg/day (range, 10-140 mg/day), molindone was shown to be safe and well-tolerated (Sikich 
2008). Molindone (10-140 mg/day) was not associated with significant increases in weight/BMI (in 
contrast to olanzapine). Molindone was also not associated with more dystonic or parkinsonian 
symptoms when given with benztropine, although akathisia was reported by more molindone-treated 
subjects. Results of randomized controlled trials such as TEOSS stimulated interest in the potential 
usefulness of molindone as a weight- and metabolically-neutral D2-receptor antagonist in children with 
ADHD and associated with IA. 
1.2 Sponsor’s Phase 2a Study 
Study 810P201, was a proof- of-concept, multicenter, open-label, parallel-group, randomized, dose-
ranging, safety, and tolerability study of molindone administered as experimental Molindone Immediate 
Release ( IR) capsules in children with ADHD and persistent serious conduct problems (Stocks 2012) . 
Target subjects were healthy male or female children aged 6 to 12 years, inclusive, with a diagnosis of 
ADHD accompanied by persistent serious conduct problems. A total of 78 subjects (19-20 per treatment 
group) in ten U.S sites were randomized. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of four weight-based dosages of Molindone IR dosed three times daily in children with ADHD

concentration exposure and safety/tolerability endpoints and 2) assess the effect of Molindone IR after 
6 weeks of maintenance treatment in reducing persistent serious conduct problems as measured by the 
Conduct Problem Subscale of the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form-Typical Intelligence Quotient 
(NCBRF-TIQ). 
 
 
 
1.3 Sponsor’s Phase 2b Study 
Sponsor completed a Phase 2b multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in the 
United States in pediatric subjects 6 to 12 years of age diagnosed with ADHD and IA that was not 
controlled by optimal stimulant and behavioral therapy (Sponsor Study 810P202).  The primary objective 
of the study was to assess the effect of an extended-release tablet formulation of molindone 
hydrochloride (SPN-810) (12 to 54 mg/day) in reducing IA as measured by the Retrospective-Modified 
Overt Aggression Scale (R-MOAS) after at least three weeks of assigned treatment. Secondary endpoints 
included the rate of remission of IA and measurement of the effectiveness of SPN-810 on Clinical Global 
Impression (CGI) and ADHD scales as well as evaluation of the safety and tolerability of the 
drug.  Patients who completed the study were offered the opportunity to continue into an open-label 
phase of six months duration.   
SPN-810 dose within treatment groups was stratified by weight (below/above 20 kg).  Both the medium 
(24/36 mg) and low (12/18 mg) dose groups showed statistically significant difference from the placebo 
group in the change from baseline to Visit 10 in R-MOAS but the high (36/54 mg) dose group was not 
significantly different from the placebo group. Furthermore, both the low dose and medium dose groups 
were significantly different from the high dose based on pair-wise comparison among the dose groups.

1.4 Impulsive Aggression Diary (IA Diary)  
Sponsor has developed and validated a new measurement tool to assess behaviors associated with IA . 
The impulsive aggression diary ( IA diary) is an electronic observer-reported outcome (eObsRO) 
instrument that comprises an episodic diary (to be reported as soon as possible after the parent or other 
guardian or observer witnesses the child’s IA behavior) and an evening diary (to enable at a minimum, 
completion of the diary once each day).  The IA diary monitors the frequency of occurrence of 15 IA 
behaviors: Yelling, Screaming, Threatening, Scratching, Throwing, Slamming, Hitting Self, Arguing, 
Cursing, Name Calling, Shoving, Hair Pulling, Fighting, Hitting Others, Kicking Others.  The development 
process followed FDA’s “Guidance for Industry Patient -Reported Outcome Measures: Use in Medical 
Product Development to Support Labeling Claims. ”  Through this process, the IA diary was demonstrated 
to be a psychometrically valid and reliable tool to assess IA in children (Sponsor Study 810P501).   
1.5 Study Rationale 
The results of the Phase 2b study indicated that doses ranging from  were safe, effective 
and well tolerated.  This Phase 3 study seeks to demonstrate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of SPN-
810 in the treatment of IA in patients with ADHD in conjunction with standard ADHD treatment. Study 
medication (SM) will be given as a divided dose twice daily (BID) with food.  A randomized, placebo-
controlled, double blind, multicenter, parallel group, fixed dose study design will be used. Frequency of 
IA behaviors will serve as a proxy for IA severity.  The IA diary will be used to assess the frequency of IA 
behaviors.  The IA diary was developed and validated for use as a contemporaneous, event-driven, 
observer-reported outcome measure .  It monitors behaviors that have been specifically linked to IA.  It 
does not rely on long periods of recall or subjective weighting of behaviors.  For these reasons, the IA 
diary is uniquely suited to detect changes in the frequency IA behaviors, which in turn is indicative of the 
severity of IA.    
Additionally, IA severity and improvement will be assessed using Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scales 
completed by both investigator and caregiver.  Subject and caregiver quality of life will also be 
evaluated.   
The effect of molindone on body composition, metabolic parameters, and prolactin will be evaluated.  
Emergence of extrapyramidal symptoms will be monitored.

Impression – Severity Scale (CGI-S).  
Additional secondary objectives are to assess the following:  
 the effect of SPN-810 on the Clinical Global Impression – Improvement Scale (CGI-I)  
 the effect of SPN-810 on t he child’s overall health as measured by the Child Health 
Questionnaire Parent Form 28-item (CHQ-PF28) 
 the effect of treating the child with SPN-810 on the parent-child relationship as measured by the 
Parenting Stress Index – Short Form version 4 (PSI-4- SF)  
 the effect of SPN-810 on the caregiver-completed CGI-I 
 the effect of SPN-810 on inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity measured by the SNAP- IV 
Rating Scale 
 the effect of SPN- 810 on the responder rate (defined as ≥ 50% in the reduction of the freque ncy 
of IA behavior s) 
 the effect of SPN- 810 on the responder rate (defined as ≥ 30 %in the reduction of the frequency 
of IA behaviors) 
2.3 Tertiary Objective 
 
 
 
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
3.1 Rationale for Study Design, Including Choice of Treatment Groups, 
Appropriateness of Measurements 
The present study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of SPN-810 in patients 
aged 6 to 12 years with ADHD associated with IA, when taken in conjunction with a standard ADHD 
treatment.  In this patient population, IA behaviors persist, despite monotherapy treatment with an 
FDA-approved ADHD medication, stimulant or non-stimulant, at an FDA-approved optimized dose. 
A titration schedule will be followed to ensure a safe escalation to each dose level.   The titration rate 
and dose range under investigation in the present study were demonstrated to be safe, efficacious, and 
well tolerated in a similar patient population in the previous Phase 2b study.  Administration of study 
medication will be recorded using an electronic dosing diary. 
The IA diary will serve as the primary assessment tool for efficacy.  The IA diary is a new electronic 
observer-reported outcome (eObsRO) instrument developed by the Sponsor to record  behaviors 
associated with IA.  Secondary measures of efficacy will include the effect of SPN-810 on the Clinical 
Global Impression – Improvement Scale (CGI-I), the effect of SPN-810 on the Clinical Global Impression –

Health Questionnaire Parent Form 28-item (CHQ-PF28), and the effect of treating the child with SPN-810 
on the parent-child relationship as measured by the Parenting Stress Index – Short Form (PSI-4-SF).  The 
child’s ADHD symptoms will be measured using the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham Rating Scale - Revised 
(SNAP-IV). 
Safety will be assessed by the monitoring of AEs, concomitant medications, vital signs, clinical laboratory 
tests, physical examinations, and ECGs, as well as by the Simpson-Angus Scale, the Barnes Akathisia 
Scale, and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS).  The scales were chosen to specifically 
monitor EPS, since youth treated with antipsychotics are at greater risk for EPS side effects than adults 
(Findling 2005).  These scales were utilized in Phase 2 studies and have been used in other clinical 
studies of atypical antipsychotics in children. 
3.2 Overall Study Design and Plan 
Protocol 810P301 is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, multicenter, parallel group, fixed 
dose study to demonstrate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of SPN-810 in the treatment of IA in 
patients aged 6-12 years with ADHD in conjunction with standard ADHD treatment.   The study is 
presented schematically in Figure 1  and Figure 2 .  The study is divided into three phases: Pre-Treatment, 
Treatment, and Conversion/Taper. 
Following screening, eligible subjects will enter a flexible baseline period, at which time the IA diary will 
be issued to the subject’ s primary caregiver.  At the end of the baseline period, per the original plan, 
eligible subjects whose primary caregiver has maintained at least 80% compliance with the IA diary will 
be randomized to 1:1:1 to 18 mg/day SPN-810, 36 mg/day SPN-810, or placebo. However, based on the 
810P301 study Interim Analysis result decision, the 18 mg arm was dropped partway through the study . 
As a result, subjects planned to be randomized to the 18 mg arm will be re-allocated to the 36 mg or 
placebo arm in a ratio of 2:1.  A dose titration schedule will be followed, with dosing in the active 
treatment groups initiated at 3 mg/day and increased approximately every 3 days until the target dose is 
reached.   After completing the two-week titration period and the three-week maintenance period, 
subjects will enter the conversion or tapering phase prior to discontinuing SM, at which time subjects 
will have the option to enter an open label extension (OLE) study.  A subject who discontinues during 
the maintenance period prior to Visit 6 may be allowed to participate in the OLE on a case- by-case basis 
only after consultation between the Investigator, the Medical Monitor and the Sponsor.  The OLE study 
will be conducted under a separate protocol.  Subjects who choose to participate in the OLE will enter 
that study at a dose of 18 mg/day SPN-810. 
3.2.1 Pre-Treatment Phase 
3.2.1.1  Screening Period 
Screening will take place for up to 45 days prior to randomization and may be carried out over more 
than one visit if necessary.   Prior to conducting any screening procedures, written informed 
consent/assent must be obtained from the parent or legal representative, and subject (when required). 
Each screened subject will be assigned a subject number starting from 2001 to 2999 in a sequential

provide more flexibility in the baseline period for the caregivers to achieve IA diary compliance (see 
Section 3.2.1.2 ). 
The R-MOAS and CGI-S will be administered to determine entry to the baseline period of the study and 
also to determine eligibility for randomization to treatment.  The Vitiello Aggression Scale will be used to 
evaluate subtype of aggression (planned vs. impulsive); only those children who score as predominantly 
impulsive will be included. The diagnosis of ADHD will be confirmed with the Schedule for Affective 
Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-aged Children —Present and Lifetime Versions 2013 (K-SADS- PL 
2013 ). The K-SADS- PL 2013 is a semi-structured diagnostic interview designed to diagnose current and 
past episodes of psychopathology in children and adolescents according to DSM-5 criteria.    The 
Introductory and Screen Interviews will be completed.  The Screen Interview will assess the different 
diagnoses and determine which supplements should be completed.  Supplement 4 (Neurodevelopment, 
Disruptive and Conduct Disorders) must be completed to assess ADHD, ODD, CD, Tic and ASD (Autism 
Spectrum Disorder).  If an exclusionary diagnosis is confirmed, the remainder of the diagnostic will not 
be completed and the subject will be deemed a screen failure.   
3.2.1.2  Baseline Period 
Subjects who meet study entry requirements will proceed to the flexible 15-day baseline period.  At Visit 
2, an IA diary device (LogPad) will be issued to the primary caregiver.  The primary and (if assigned) 
secondary caregivers will receive training on the use of the IA diary. Every effort will be made to provide 
adequate caregiver training on the use of the IA diary at Visit 2 and acknowledgement of training will be 
captured on the device.   
Following at least 15 days of IA diary use, caregiver compliance with the IA diary will be assessed. 
Compliance will be calculated as the percentage of days over the past 15 days during the baseline period 
for which an evening diary was completed.    Subjects whose caregivers demonstrate at least 80% 
compliance will be eligible for randomization and continue into the titration period. 
Subjects whose caregivers do not reach 80% compliance during the first 15 days of the baseline period 
may be allowed to continue to use the diary for up to 15 additional days.  For these subjects, caregivers 
will receive remedial training on the use of the IA diary.  During this time, caregiver compliance with the 
IA diary will be monitored daily by study site personnel over the past 15- days as a “rolling window”.  
When the caregivers’ performan ce with the IA diary improves such that the caregivers are able to 
demonstrate at least 80% compliance over the past 15-day rolling window, the subject will be eligible 
for randomization and allowed to continue into the titration period.  
Although there are up to 30 days available for each of the screening and the baseline period, the total 
duration of screening and baseline periods may not exceed 45 days. 
Rescreening 
As a general rule, rescreening of subjects is not allowed.  The only exception to this will be for subjects 
who failed screening due to caregiver non-compliance with the IA diary under protocol version 3.0.

be assigned a new subject ID number and will complete all study screening procedures. 
3.2.2 Treatment Phase 
3.2.2.1  Randomization 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be re-assessed to verify eligibility prior to study randomization at the end 
of Visit 3 (Randomization).  Eligible subjects whose primary caregiver has maintained at least 80% 
compliance with the IA diary will be randomized.  Per the original randomization eligible subjects who 
complete the baseline period and meet the requirements for the double blind study will  be randomized 
at Visit 3 (Day 1) in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 18 mg/day, 36 mg/day SPN-810 or placebo and proceed to 
the titration period, which will be two weeks.  However, based on the 810P301 study Interim Analysis 
result decision, the 18 mg arm was dropped partway through the study. As a result, subjects planned to 
be randomized to the 18 mg arm will be re-allocated to the 36 mg or placebo arm in a ratio of 2:1. 
3.2.2.2  Titration Period 
Subjects will be titrated to maintenance dose over a period of 2 weeks. 
3.2.2.3  Maintenance Period 
Following dose titration, subjects on active treatment will be maintained at their designated dose level 
for 3 weeks.   
3.2.3 Conversion/Taper Phase 
All subjects who complete the randomized, double blind portion of study 810P302 will have the option 
to participate in an OLE study (study protocol 810P304) in which all subjects will receive active SM 
treatment.  Subjects choosing to participate will receive blinded conversion medication kits, and the ir 
total daily dose for the open label extension will be converted to 18 mg/day ( Figure 1 ).  Those subjects 
who do not elect to participate in this extension will be tapered off SM ( Figure 2 ).   
The 18 mg line in the 2 figures below will not be applicable to subjects re-randomized following the 
810P301 interim analysis decision to drop the 18 mg dose. 
3.2.4 End of Study / Early Termination 
Subjects will return to the study site for a final visit, after completing the 1-week Taper/Conversion 
Period.  Those subjects who elect to continue in the OLE study will have procedures performed for that 
study as well.   Subject who discontinues from the study during the maintenance period will be offered a 
Taper kit and will return to the study site for a follow-up visit (EOS).  Subjects who discontinue during 
the titration period will not receive a taper kit and will only complete the EOS procedures .

4.2 Schedule of Visits and Procedures 
All subjects who are randomized and take any SM will be followed according to the protocol regardless 
of the number of doses of SM taken, unless consent for follow-up is withdrawn.  The Sponsor, or the 
Sponsor’s designee, must be notified of all deviations from the protocol visits or procedu res, and these 
procedures, if applicable, will be rescheduled or performed at the nearest possible time to the original 
schedule.  Subjects will be instructed to call study personnel to report any abnormalities during the 
intervals in between study visits and to come to the study site if medical evaluation is needed and as the 
urgency of the situation indicates.  Unscheduled visits may be conducted at the discretion of the 
investigator throughout all study periods. The medical monitor must be contacted promptly in the event 
that any clinically significant findings or information are obtained during the unscheduled visit. This 
should be captured in the appropriate eCRF. For emergency and other unscheduled visits to a medical 
facility other than the study site, medical records will be obtained by the Investigator or qualified 
designee as source data for study follow- up.

of such information that is not authorized in writing by the Sponsor is strictly prohibited.  Such information may be used solely 
for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. If the subject decides to complete the PK sampling over one visit then he/she will arrive at the clinic in 
the morning prior to taking the morning dose.   A PK sample will be drawn pre-dose; then the dose will 
be observed in the clinic.  Post-dose PK samples will be taken at approximately 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours 
and 6 hours after the time of the observed dose.  PK samples should be obtained within 15 minutes of 
the 1 hour and 2 hour timepoints and within 30 minutes of the 4 hour and 6 hour timepoints.  
If the subject decides to come for the PK sampling over two visits, then on one visit the subject will 
arrive at the clinic in the morning, prior to taking their morning dose. A PK sample will be drawn pre-
dose; then the dose will be observed in the clinic.  Post-dose PK samples will be taken at approximately 
1 hour and 2 hours after the time of the observed dose. PK samples should be obtained within 15 
minutes of the targeted timepoints. At the other visit, subjects will arrive at the clinic after taking their 
morning dose.   PK samples will be taken at approximately 4 hours and 6 hours after the time that the 
morning dose was taken.  PK samples should be obtained within 30 minutes of the targeted timepoints. 
Blood samples will be collected and processed as per instructions in the Laboratory Manual. 
4.3 Treatments 
4.3.1 Treatments Administered 
Subjects will take molindone hydrochloride extended-release tablet (SPN-810) or placebo twice each 
day (BID) with food, in the morning and in the evening, in addition to the stable dose of the optimized 
ADHD medication determined from the lead-in period.  If initiating treatment before noon, patients 
should start with the morning dose; if after noon, the evening dose. 
Subjects will be randomized to one of three treatments at Visit 3 .  Subjects will be titrated up to the final 
randomized total daily dose (TDD) .   
 Reference treatment 
o Treatment 1: Placebo tablets, PO, BID 
 Test treatments  
o Treatment 2: Molindone extended-release tablets, 18 mg TDD, PO, BID 
o Treatment 3: Molindone extended-release tablets, 36 mg TDD, PO, BID 
Based on the 810P301 study Interim Analysis result decision, the 18 mg dose arm was dropped 
partway through the study.    
4.3.2 Identity of Investigational Product(s) 
Test and reference (matching placebo) products are either purple (3mg) or yellow (9mg) round tablets 
printed on one side with the tablet dose strength (“ 3” or “ 9”) that will be supplied in labeled blister 
cards by the Sponsor. The Sponsor will package the SM in a double-blind configuration.   
Each SM blister card will contain combinations of molindone extended-release and/or placebo tablets, 
which will supply a subject with 6 (six) to 8 (eight) days of dosing as well as some extras for lost product 
and/or to account for visit delays associated with patient/site schedules.  The SM blister card types

for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. include: Titration (two blister cards), Maintenance (three blister cards), Taper (one blister card), and 
Conversion (one blister card).   
A single SM kit contains a total of 7 pre-packaged blister cards (two Titration blister cards, three 
Maintenance blister cards, one Tapering blister card and one Conversion blister card) and is marked with 
a unique 4-digit SM kit number.   
4.3.3 Study Medication Handling and Accountability 
All SM will be supplied to the Investigator by the Sponsor.  SM supplies must be kept in an appropriate 
secure area (e.g., locked cabinet) and stored according to the conditions specified on the SM labels.  SM 
must be stored between 59 °F – 86°F (15°C –  30°C). 
Following Sponsor instructions and in compliance with ICH E6 as well as local, state, and federal 
regulations, the Investigator and study staff will be responsible for the accountability of all clinical 
supplies (receiving, shipment, dispensing, inventory, and record keeping) in a SM accountability log, a 
copy of which will be collected by the Sponsor at the end of the study. 
Under no circumstances will the Investigator allow the SM to be used other than as directed by this 
protocol.  Clinical supplies will not be dispensed to any individual who is not randomized into the study. 
An accurate and timely record of the receipt of all clinical supplies; dispensing of SM to the subject; 
collection of unused supplies returned by the subject; and subsequent return of unused SM to the 
Sponsor must be maintained with dates.  This SM accountability log includes, but may not be limited to: 
(a) documentation of receipt of clinical supplies, (b) SM inventory log, (c) SM accountability log, and (d) 
all shipping service receipts.  All forms will be provided by the Sponsor.  Any comparable forms that the 
study site wishes to use must be approved by the Sponsor.  
The supplies and inventory records must be made available, upon request, for inspection by the 
designated representative of the Sponsor, a representative of the FDA, or a representative of a non-US 
health authority.  The assigned Clinical Research Associate (CRA) will review these documents along with 
all other study conduct documents at each and every visit to the study site once SM has been received 
by the study site.  All used, partly used, and unused clinical supplies, including empty containers, are to 
be returned to the Investigator by the subject and ultimately to the Sponsor at the conclusion of the 
study, unless provision is made by the Sponsor for destruction of supplies and containers at the study 
site.  Upon completion of SM accountability and reconciliation procedures by study site personnel and 
documentation procedures by Sponsor personnel, SM is to be returned to the Sponsor with a copy of 
the completed SM disposition form as outlined in the Study Medication Manual. 
4.3.4 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Allocation of study drug will be completed centrally through the use of an interactive web response 
system (IWRS) that will determine which kit to assign to the subject. The randomization schedules will 
be created by a designated unmasked statistician using SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, Version 
9.2 or higher).  Separate schedules for subject randomization and drug list will be  created. The original 
randomization scheme assigns treatment to each randomization number in a 1:1:1. However, based on

by the IWRS vendor, and accessible only to authorized persons until the time of unblinding. 
The test tablets have matching placebo tablets.  The blind is maintained primarily through the IWRS.  
The blind will be maintained through the end of the Conversion/Taper period. 
The Investigator must try to avoid breaking the blind.  The decoding information will not be viewed 
unless an actual medical or medication safety emergency occurs.  The Investigator can access the 
subject’s randomized treatment information via IWRS only if  knowledge of the treatment regimen will 
influence or assist with medical management of the subject in an acute emergency.  Before breaking the 
blind, every effort must be made to contact the Medical Monitor to ascertain the necessity of breaking 
the code.  If the Investigator is unsuccessful in contacting the Medical Monitor, he/she will contact the 
backup Medical Monitor (or other appropriate designee if the backup Medical Monitor is unavailable).  
If it is not possible to contact the Medical Monitor or the backup Medical Monitor (or designee), and the 
situation is an emergency, the Investigator may break the blind and contact the Medical Monitor as 
soon as possible.  The Investigator is to make a careful note of the date and time of decoding, the reason 
that necessitated breaking the code, and the signature of the person who broke the code.  Upon 
breaking the randomization code, the subject should be withdrawn from the study but should be 
followed up for safety purposes. 
4.4 Prohibited Medications: 
Subjects may not be on any prohibited medication while on study as indicated in the Inclusion/Exclusion 
Criteria. These medications include:  
 α 2- adrenergic agonists (e.g. clonidine and guanfacine) used for any other reason except for 
monotherapy treatment for ADH D  
 Anti-psychotics including aripiprazole,  risperidone, quetiapine, and ziprasidone  
 Anticonvulsants including carbamazepine and valproic acid, antidepressants, mood stabilizers 
including lithium, benzodiazepines, cholinesterase inhibitors or any drug known to inhibit 
CYP2D6 activity 
 Herbal supplements 
4.5 Concomitant Medication 
The dose of the ongoing ADHD medication will not be adjusted during the study, starting at Visit 1. No 
additional concomitant medications are allowed during the study, with the following exceptions: 
 Chronic medication for conditions not related to ADHD or IA that are allowed by Investigator at 
Screening 
 Nutritional supplements (e.g. multivitamins, fish oil) 
 Emla or other numbing cream for PK venipuncture 
 Benztropine is permitted for the treatment of emerging EPS at a starting dose of 0.5mg BID up 
to a range of 1 to 4mg/day.  Lorazepam (1 to 2 mg per dose not to exceed three times daily) and

emerging EPS.    
 Common over-the-counter (OTC) therapies for minor transient ailments (e.g. acetaminophen for 
headache, ibuprofen for fever) will be allowed without exception. 
 Treatment for AEs other than EPS or minor transient ailments is only permitted in consultation 
with the Medical Monitor.  
All concomitant medications will be recorded in the eCRF. 
4.6 Completion of Study and Discontinuation of Subjects  
Subjects will be considered to have completed the study if they complete all visits up to and including 
Visit 6.  All subjects who discontinue early will complete Visit 7.  Any subject who discontinues from the 
study after Visit 5 will be offered a Taper kit.  
The Investigator(s) or subjects themselves may stop SM treatment at any time for safety or personal 
reasons.  A subject is free to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason without prejudice to 
their future medical care by the physician or at the institution.  The Investigator or Sponsor may also 
withdraw the subject at any time in the interest of subject safety.  The withdrawal of a subject from the 
study should be discussed where possible with the Medical Monitor and/or CRA before the subject stops 
SM.  Subjects removed from the study for any reason will not be replaced. 
Reasons for withdrawal may include but are not limited to subject withdrawal of consent, occurrence of 
unmanageable AEs, or if it is in the best interest of the subject as per Investigator’s discretion . 
The primary reason for withdrawal must be re corded in the subject’s medical record and on the eCRF.  If 
a subject is withdrawn for more than one reason, each reason should be documented in the source 
document and the most medically significant  reason should be entered on the eCRF. 
5 ANALYSIS VARIABLES 
5.1 Primary Efficacy Variable 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be based on a checklist of 15 IA behaviors collected in an electronic IA 
diary .  The IA diary comprises two parts:   1) an episodic diary that will be used by the primary caregiver 
(or alternate) to enter events as soon as possible after they are observed; and 2) an evening diary that 
will prompt the caregiver to review events for the day and to enter any events that were not previously 
captured.  Events can be directly observed by the caregiver or could be reported to the caregiver by 
another observer such as a teacher.   Each event will be characterized by a checklist of 15 observed 
behaviors:  Yelling, Screaming, Threatening, Scratching, Throwing, Slamming, Hitting Self, Arguing, 
Cursing, Name Calling, Shoving, Hair Pulling, Fighting, Hitting Others, Kicking Others.  The checklist will 
indicate whether each behavior was observed (coded 1) or was not observed (coded 0) during the 
incidence of an event.  Each day can have multiple events.  A day can have no event, as can be attested

this, the daily event score for that subject will be 0.   Behaviors not on this list will not be captured.    
5.2 Secondary Efficacy Variables 
The following efficacy scales will be administered at visits designated in the Schedule of Visits and 
Procedures ( Table 1 ). 
5.2.1 Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scales 
The CGI scale was developed to provide a brief, stand- alone assessment of the clinician’s view of a 
subject’s global functioning prior to and after a dministration of a SM (Guy 1976).   Severity of illness (CGI-
S) and global improvement (CGI-I) are both rated on a scale of 1 to 7 with 7 being “extremely ill” or “very 
much worse”, respectively.  Successful therapy is indicated by a lower overall score in subsequent 
testing.  Investigators should consider their total clinical experience with children who have IA 
associated with ADHD and rate how severe the subject’s condition is at the time.   
 CGI-S will be evaluated by the Investigator at each visit on a 7-point scale with 1=Normal,    
2=Borderline ill, 3=Mildly ill, 4=Moderately ill, 5=Markedly ill, 6=Severely ill, and 7=Extremely ill.    
 CGI-I, relative to the condition at Baseline (Visit 1), will be evaluated by the caregiver and by the 
Investigator at each post-baseline visit on a 7-point scale with 1=Very much improved, 2=Much 
improved, 3=Minimally improved, 4=No change, 5=Minimally worse, 6=Much worse, and 7=Very 
much worse.    
CGI-S will be assessed by the Investigator at Visit 1, Visit 3, Visit 4, Visit 5 and Visit 6.  CGI-I will be 
assessed by the caregiver and the Investigator at Visit 4, Visit 5 and Visit 6.   
5.2.2 Swanson, Nolan, Pelham Rating Scale- Revised (SNAP- IV) 
The SNAP-IV rating scale includes 18 ADHD and 8 oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms as 
specified in the DSM- IV-TR and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health Related 
Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders.  The symptoms are 
scored by assigning a severity estimate for each symptom on a 4-point scale (Swanson 2001).  The SNAP-
IV rating should be performed by the same parent or legal representative at each visit when possible. 
The ratings from the SNAP-IV scale are grouped into the following 4 subscales:   
 ADHD-Inattention (items #1-9),  
 ADHD-Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (items #10- 18) 
 ODD (items #19-26)   
 ADHD-Combined subscale: the first two subscales are combined   
Each subscale score is the sum of the scores for the individual items included in the subscale. 
The SNAP-IV rating scale will be administered at Visit 3 and Visit 6.

The Child Health Questionnaire Parent Form 28-item (CHQ-PF28) is a short generic measure of health 
status and health related quality of life (Landgraf 1996).  CHQ-PF28 items have four, five, or six response 
options, divided over eight multi-item scales (physical functioning, general behavior, mental health, self 
esteem, general health perceptions, parental impact: emotional, parental impact: time, and family 
activities) and five single item concepts (role functioning: emotional/behavior, role functioning: physical, 
bodily pain, family cohesion, and change in health). The CHQ-PF28 should be performed by the primary 
caregiver when possible.   
The CHQ-PF28 will be administered at Visit 3 and Visit 6. 
5.2.4 Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-4- SF) 
Reduction in stress is considered important for parents of children with disruptive behavior problems, 
developmental disabilities, and chronic illness (Haskett 2006).  The Parenting Stress Index – Short Form 
(PSI-4- SF) is a 36-item self-report measure of parenting stress (Abidin 1995) . Three subscales (Parental

of such information that is not authorized in writing by the Sponsor is strictly prohibited.  Such information may be used solely 
for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. 5.4 Safety Assessments 
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring of and recording of all concomitant medications and AEs, 
clinical laboratory tests, measurement of vital signs and 12-lead ECGs, suicidality monitoring, and the 
performance of physical examinations at visits designated in the Schedule of Visits and Procedures 
(Table 1 ). 
Assessment of possible neurological side effects and EPS will be performed using the Simpson- Angu s 
scale, the Barnes Akathisia scale and the AIMS.  A positive rating or finding on the safety scale will be 
captured as an AE at the discretion of the Investigator. 
5.4.1 Adverse Events 
As defined by the ICH Guideline for GCP, an adverse event (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence in a 
patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with treatment. 
An AE can be: 
 Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product. 
 Any new disease, intercurrent injuries, or exacerbation of an existing disease. 
 Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG) that results in symptoms, 
a change in treatment, or discontinuation from SM. 
 Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at baseline. 
Surgical procedures are not AEs; they are therapeutic measures for conditions that require surgery.  The 
condition for which the surgery is required is an AE, if it occurs or is detected during the study period. 
5.4.1.1  Causality 
AEs may be categorized as either Adverse Drug Reactions or Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions based 
on their relationship to SM and the degree of certainty about causality.  
Suspected adverse drug reactions  (SADRs) are a subset of adverse events for which there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE, i.e., there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the adverse event.   
Adverse drug reactions  (ADRs) are a subset of all SADRs for which there is reason to conclude that the 
drug caused the event. 
5.4.1.2  Recording and Evaluation of Adverse Events 
All subjects who are enrolled (starting at Visit 3) will be questioned regarding the occurrence of AEs.  At 
each contact with the subject, the investigator must seek information on AEs by specific questioning 
and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all AEs should be recorded immediately in the 
source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the eCRF.  All clearly related

This document is confidential.  It contains proprietary information of Supernus® Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Any viewing or disclosure 
of such information that is not authorized in writing by the Sponsor is strictly prohibited.  Such information may be used solely 
for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should be recorded in the source 
document, though they may be grouped under one diagnosis.  For example, fever, elevated WBC, cough, 
abnormal chest X-ray, etc. , can all be reported as “pneumonia”.  
All AEs occurring after enrollment and throughout the study period must be recorded.  A treatment-
emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE with a start date on or after the first dose of study 
drug, or that worsened following first administration of study drug. For subjects who receive SM, TEAEs 
will be collected starting from the first dose of SM.  The clinical course of each AE should be followed 
until resolution or until, in the medical judgment of the Investigator, the event has stabilized or is 
assessed as chronic.   
An increase in the CSSRS, Simpson Angus Scale, Barnes Akathisia Scale, or the AIMS will not necessarily 
be rated as an AE unless the event meets AE criteria. 
The Investigator is responsible for evaluating AEs and determining the following: 
 Serious vs. Non-serious:  Is the event a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)? 
 Causality:  Was AE related or possibly related to the SM? 
 Severity: How pronounced is the incapacity/discomfort caused by an AE? 
5.4.1.3  Criteria for Assessing Severity 
The Investigator will evaluate the comments of the subject and the response to treatment in order that 
he or she may judge the true nature and severity of the AE.  Severity refers to the accumulated intensity 
of discomfort/impairment of health since the last recording of AEs and will be assessed according to the 
following criteria: 
 Mild:   Awareness of sign, symptom, or event, but easily tolerated 
 Moderate : Discomfort enough to interfere with usual activity and may warrant intervention 
 Severe:  Incapacitating with inability to do usual activities or significantly affects clinical status 
and warrants intervention 
The criteria for assessing severity are different from those used for seriousness. 
5.4.1.4  Criteria for Assessing Causality 
The Investigator is responsible for determining the relationship between the administration of SM and 
the occurrence of an AE a s not suspected  or as a suspected reaction to SM.  These are defined as 
follows: 
Not suspected:  The temporal relationship of the AE to SM administration makes a causal relationship 
unlikely , or other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions provide a sufficient 
explanation for the observed event.  
 Not related:  Temporal relationship to SM administration is missing or implausible, or there is an 
evident other cause.

of such information that is not authorized in writing by the Sponsor is strictly prohibited.  Such information may be used solely 
for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study.  Unlikely related :  Temporal relationship to SM administration makes a causal relationship 
improbable; and other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations. 
Suspected:  The temporal relationship of the AE to SM administration makes a causal relationship 
possible, and other drugs, therapeutic inte rventions, or underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient 
explanation for the observed event.  
 Possibly related:   Temporal relationship to SM administration is plausible, but concurrent 
disease or other drugs or chemicals could also explain event.  Information on drug withdrawal 
may be lacking or unclear.  This will be reported as a Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction (SADR) . 
 Definitely related:  Temporal relationship to SM administration is plausible, and concurrent 
disease or other drugs or chemicals cannot explain event.   The response to withdrawal of the 
medication (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible.   The ev ent must be definitive 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if 
necessary.   This will be reported as an Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) . 
5.4.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAE) 
AEs are classified as serious or non-serious.  An AE or ADR is considered “ serious ” if, in the view of either 
the investigator or Sponsor, it results in one of the following outcomes:  
 death 
 life-threatening AE (i.e., the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred.  
This does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to 
continue, might have caused death.) 
 in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
 persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 an important medical event 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or 
hospitalization, but are clearly of major clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug 
dependence or abuse, blood dyscrasias, a seizure that did not result in in-patient hospitalization, or 
intensive treatment for allergic bronchospasm in an emergency department would typically be 
considered serious. 
5.4.2.1  Investigator Responsibilities for Reporting SAEs 
The Investigator must immediately report to the Sponsor all SAEs, regardless of whether the Investigator 
believes they are drug related. 
All SAEs must be reported to the Drug Safety Contact within 24 hours of first becoming aware of the 
SAE.  The Investigator must complete an SAE eCRF in EDC  and include a detailed description of the SAE,

other relevant documents).  Should the site be unable to access EDC, a paper SAE form must be 
completed and sent to  Drug Safety by email or fax . The investigator will keep a copy of this SAE 
Report form on file at the study site.  Once EDC becomes available, the site must complete the SAE eCRF 
in EDC.  
The Investigator or study physician, after thorough consideration of all facts that are available, must 
include an assessment of causality of an AE to SM in the report to the Sponsor.   
Follow-up information, or new information available after the initial report, should be actively sought 
and reported to the Sponsor as it becomes available using the SAE Report Form.   
The Drug Safety Contact for SAE reporting is: 
 
 
 
 
5.4.2.2  Other Events Requiring Immediate Reporting 
The Investigator must report a pregnancy  that occurs in a subject during a clinical study to the Drug 
Safety Contact within 24 hours of first becoming aware of the event.   Pregnancy should be reported on a 
Pregnancy Report Form.   The Investigator should discuss the case with the Medical Monitor; the 
Investigator must follow any pregnant subject for 3 months after the child is born.  The Investigator 
must complete a Pregnancy Outcome Form as a follow up. Any AEs concerning the pregnancy of the 
subject during pregnancy or the child after birth must be documented and reported to the Sponsor. 
Treatment-emerging EPS (e.g. akathisia, dystonia, Parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia) and neuroleptic 
malignant syndrome should be reported to the Drug Safety Contact person(s) by completing the Adverse 
Event of Special Interest (AESI) eCRF in EDC.  Should the site be unable to access EDC, a paper AESI form 
must be completed and sent to  Drug Safety by email or fax  within 24 hours of first becoming 
aware of the event.   Once EDC becomes available the site must complete AESI eCRF in EDC. EPS 
incidence will be summarized and shared with study Investigators throughout the trial.   
Overdosage of molindone presumably may be manifested by severe EPS and sedation.  Coma with 
respiratory depression and severe hypotension resulting in a shock-like syndrome could occur. In the 
event of a suspected overdose, the parent or legal representative should be instructed to call 911 or 
their local poison control center  
Symptomatic, supportive therapy should be the rule.   Gastric lavage is indicated for the reduction of 
absorption of molindone which is freely soluble in water. Since the ad sorption of molindone by 
activated charcoal has not been determined, the use of this antidote must be considered of theoretical 
value.

blocked by molindo ne in animals, this blocking effect has not been determined in humans. 
5.4.2.3  Sponsor Responsibilities for Expedited Reporting of SAEs 
The Sponsor will inform Investigators and regulatory authorities of reportable events, in compliance 
with applicable regulatory requirements, on an expedited basis (i.e., within specific timeframes) .  For 
this reason, it is imperative that study sites subm it SAE information to the Sponsor in the manner 
described above.  
Investigators must comply with the applicable regulatory requirements related to the reporting of SAEs 
to the IRB/IEC.  Investigators must also submit the safety information provided by the Sponsor to the 
IRB/IEC unless the country legal regulation requires that the Sponsor should be responsible for the 
safety reporting to the IRB/IEC. 
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to notify all participating investigators, in a written IND safety 
report, of any SADR that is both serious and unexpected.  The Sponsor will also notify participating 
investigators of any findings from other sources (other studies, animal and in vitro testing, etc.) that 
suggest a significant risk for human subjects.  Such findings will typically lead to safety-related changes 
in the study protocol, Informed Consent, and/or Investigator’s Brochure.  
5.4.3 Management of Treatment-Emerging EPS 
If a subject experiences treatment-emerging EPS (including akathisia, dystonia, Parkinsonism, or tardive 
dyskinesia), benztropine will be permitted at a starting dose of 0.5 mg BID up to a range of 1 to 
4 mg/day.  Lorazepam (1 to 2 mg per dose not to exceed three times daily) and clonazepam (0.25 to 1 
mg per dose not to exceed twice daily) will also be permitted to treat emerging EPS. 
A positive finding on an EPS safety assessment scale (Barnes Akathisia, Simpson-Angus, AIMS) does not 
necessarily equate to an EPS event.  Investigators should evaluate positive findings on the EPS safety 
assessment scales and integrate them into a global clinical observation to determine if an AE of EPS 
should be recorded. 
5.4.4 Laboratory Measurements 
With the exception of urine pregnancy test, clinical laboratory tests will be performed by a central 
laboratory as specified in the reference binder. 
Details for collecting, handling, and shipping samples (including shipment addresses) will be detailed in a 
separate laboratory manual.   The Schedule of Visits and Procedures ( Table 1 ) shows the time points at 
which urine samples will be collected for urinalysis and blood samples will be collected for clinical 
laboratory tests and plasma concentration levels.    
Table 3  presents the clinical laboratory tests to be performed.   Metabolic parameters (including insulin, 
glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol) and prolactin will be measured. A subject will be excluded if the 
Screening blood test results indicates > 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) of alanine

and/or serum creatinine. Laboratory tests will not be repeated for these subjects. 
All laboratory tests will be reviewed in a timely manner by qualified site personnel to ensure safety.  
Abnormal lab findings may be confirmed if necessary by one repeated testing at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  Any repeat laboratory testing will be conducted under fasting condition. Any laboratory 
abnormality may qualify as an AE in the Investigator’s judgment.  
A total of approximately 42 mL of blood per subject will be drawn during the study: 22 mL is for clinical 
laboratory tests and 20 mL is for PK sampling.

measure the PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals, and heart rate. 
All ECG tracings will be reviewed within 24 hours by the Investigator or qualified S ub-Investigator.  PR 
intervals will be determined for each of these ECGs from a single reading.  Invalid measurements will be 
repeated.  QTc will be reported as QTcF ( QT corrected using Fridericia's method).  
5.4.8 Other Special Tests 
The following special tests will be administered in the clinic at visits designated in the Schedule of Visits 
and Procedures ( Table 1 ).   
5.4.8.1  K-SADS- PL 2013 Diagnostic Interview 
The K-SADS- PL 2013 is a semi-structured diagnostic interview designed to diagnose current and past 
episodes of psychopathology in children and adolescents according to DSM-5 criteria (Kaufman 1997). 
We will use a version of K-SADS 2013 that was revised to be compatible to the DSM-5 criteria.  It 
includes  the parent and child DSM-5 cross-cutting symptoms measures  (DSM-5 CC-SM); an 
unstructured Introductory Interview; the Diagnostic Screening Interview; the Supplement Completion 
Checklist; the Diagnostic Supplements and the Summary Lifetime Diagnostic Checklist.  The K-SADS- PL 
2013 will be used at screening to confirm the diagnosis of ADHD, as well as to rule out exclusionary 
diagnoses.  The Screen Interview will assess the different diagnos es and determine which supplements 
should be completed.  Supplement 4 (Neurodevelopment, Disruptive and Conduct Disorders ) must be 
completed to assess ADHD, ODD, CD Tic and ASD.  If an exclusionary diagnosis is confirmed, the 
remainder of the diagnostic will not be completed.   This assessment will be administered at Visit 1. 
5.4.8.2  Simpson-Angus Scale 
The Simpson-Angus scale is a 10-item rating scale that is widely used for assessment of neuroleptic-
induced Parkinsonism (Simpson 1970).  It consists of 1 item measuring gait, 6 items measuring rigidity, 
and three items measuring glabella tap, tremor and salivation, respectively.  This assessment will be 
administered at Visit 3 and all subsequent visits. 
5.4.8.3  Barnes Akathisia Scale 
The Barnes Akathisia scale is a rating scale for drug-induced akathisia and includes components for 
rating the observable, restless movements characteristic of akathisia, the awareness of restlessness, and 
any distress associated with the condition (Barnes 1989).  This assessment will be administered at Visit 3 
and all subsequent visits. 
5.4.8.4  Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) 
The AIMS test is a rating scale used to measure tardive dyskinesia (Munetz 1988).  There are 12 items 
that rate involuntary movements of various areas of the subject’s body.  This assessment will be 
administered at Visit 3 and all subsequent visits.

The Vitiello Aggression Scale is a 10-item rating scale that uses a cluster analysis to categorize aggression 
into two subtypes, predatory (or planned) and affective (or impulsive) (Vitiello 1990).   This assessment 
will be administered at Visit 1. 
5.4.8.6  Retrospective-Modified Overt Aggression Scale (R-MOAS) 
The Retrospective-Modified Overt Aggression Scale (R-MOAS) was developed to gauge the severity of 
aggressive behavior (Blader 2010).   Parents rate the frequency over the past week of 16 aggressive 
behaviors in four areas: verbal aggression; physical aggression toward others; aggression toward 
oneself; and destruction or hostile misuse of property.  Numeric weighting amplifies the seriousness of 
more harmful behaviors in the total score.   This assessment will be administered at Visit 1. 
5.4.8.7  Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) 
The C-SSRS is a questionnaire that prospectively assess es suicidal ideation and behavior using a semi-
structured interview to probe patient responses (Posner 2011) .  The C-SSRS versions applicable to the 
current study are the Baseline version and the Since Last Visit version. 
The Baseline version of the scale assesses lifetime suicidal ideation and behavior.  This version is suitable 
as part of a subject’s first inter view and will be used at Visit 1 to identify volunteers who must not 
participate in the trial due to their suicidal tendencies. 
The Since Last Visit version of the scale assesses any suicidal thoughts or behaviors the subjects may 
have had since the last administration of the C-SSRS.  This version will be used for the other study visits. 
5.4.8.8  Infrequent Behaviors Checklist 
The infrequent behaviors checklist is a checklist of 15 behaviors that (along with the 15 IA Diary 
behaviors) were qualitatively linked to IA during the development of the IA diary.  These behaviors 
include teasing, spitting, biting, weapons, ripping, breaking, vandalizing, destroying, fire setting, hitting 
animal, kicking self, kicking animal, severe injury self, severe injury others, severe injury animal.  
Caregivers will be asked which, if any, of these behaviors have been observed since the patient’s last 
visit.  This assessment will be administered at Visit 3 , Visit 4 , Visit 5, and Visit 6. 
6 STATISTICAL METHODS 
6.1 Statistical and Analytical Pla ns 
Tabular summaries of the data collected during the study will be presented to provide a general 
description of the subjects studied and an overview of the Efficacy, PK and safety results.  Data from all 
sites will be combined in the computation of these summaries and summaries will be presented by 
treatment group.  Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of 
subjects, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, and minimum and maximum values).  Categorical 
(nominal) variables will be summarized using frequency tables (number and percentage of subjects in 
each category).

for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. In addition to tabular summaries, subject data listings, as specified in Sections 16.2 and 16.4 of ICH 
Guidance E3, will be provided.  Additional subject data listings to be provided for this study are listed 
under the relevant subsections below. All data analyses will be performed by the CRO after the study is 
completed and the database is released.  Statistical programming and analyses will be performed usin g 
SAS® and/or other validated statistical software as required. 
Complete details of the statistical analysis will be provided in a separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) , 
which will be written, finalized, and approved prior to database lock and will be included in the Clinical 
Study Report (CSR) for this protocol.  The statistical analysis plan will supersede the statistical analysis 
methods described in this clinical protocol. Any deviation from the statistical plan will be documented 
and described in the final report.  If changes to principal features stated in the protocol are required, 
these will be documented in a protocol amendment.  The final SAP will take into account any 
amendment to the protocol. 
In general, the baseline value for a variable is defined as the last observation prior to the first dose of 
double-blind study medication, ideally Visit 3, but including the screening value, if necessary. 
6.2 Handling Missing Data 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, the frequency of IA behaviors during the Treatment period will be 
calculated over the number of days with non-missing IA diary data in the Treatment period. No explicit 
imputation of missing data will be used, but this approach is implicitly equivalent to using the frequency 
of IA behaviors during the days with non-missing IA diary data to impute the frequency for days after 
study discontinuation and days with missing IA diary data.    
6.3 Analysis Populations 
The population of “ all enrolled subjects” consists of all those screened subjects who meet the  
requirements for study participation and are entered in the Baseline period of the study.   The 
population of “ all randomized subjects” consists of all those enrolled subjects who complete the 
Baseline Period, meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and are randomized. 
Safety Population:  will include all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
Intent- to-Treat (ITT) Population :  will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and 
have a baseline and at least 1 valid post-randomization assessment of frequency of IA behaviors based 
on IA diary entry. 
Per-Protocol (PP) Population:  will include all of the subjects in the ITT population who completed the

Duration of exposure is defined as the total number of days a subject is exposed to any study treatment. 
This will be calculated for each subject by taking the difference between the date of last dose minus the 
date of the first dose, plus 1 (date of last dose – date of first dose +1).  
Duration of Treatment exposure will also be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, 
median, minimum, and maximum). 
Percent of study drug compliance is defined as {(number of tablets dispensed – number of tablets 
returned) / 4*(date of last dose – date of first dose + 1)}* 100%.  
Each subject is expected to take 4 tablets per day. For each treatment, SM compliance will be summarized 
by compliance category (<80%, 80-120%, and >120%) and number of subjects in each compliance 
category.  Study medication compliance will also be summarized as a continuous variable using descriptive 
statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) for each treatment.    
Summaries of treatment compliance and exposure will be presented separately for the Titration Period, 
Maintenance Period, and combined Titration and Maintenance Periods. 
6.8 Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant medications will be assigned an 11-digit code using the World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary (WHO DD) drug codes.  Concomitant medications will be further coded to the appropriate 
Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical (ATC) code indicating therapeutic classification.  A tabular summary of 
concomitant medications by drug class will be presented for the safety population. 
6.9 Efficacy Analyses 
6.9.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change (PCH T) in the frequency (unweighted score) of IA 
behaviors per 7 days in the Treatment (Titration and Maintenance) period relative to the Baseline period 
calculated over the number of days with non-missing IA diary data.   The frequency of IA behaviors per 7 
days is the sum of scores for all events in a given period of sequential days, adjusted to 7 days. 
The primary efficacy endpoint PCH T will be calculated by PCH T= 100*(T – B)/B, where T and B are IA 
behavior frequencies per 7 days during the treatment period and baseline period, respectively. The IA 
behavior frequency per 7 days is defined as (SUM/DAY) x 7, where SUM  is  the sum of the IA behaviors  
reported in the subject IA diary, and DAY is the number of days with non-missing IA frequency data in 
the subject IA diary during the specified study period. 
Per the adaptive design feature of protocol 810P301 that led to discontinuation of the 18 mg dose 
group, SPN-810 36 mg vs. placebo will be tested. 
The null (H 0) and the alternative (H a) hypotheses are as in the following:

of such information that is not authorized in writing by the Sponsor is strictly prohibited.  Such information may be used solely 
for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study.  H01: There is no difference between the median of the 36 mg dose SPN-810 and the median of 
placebo vs.  
 Ha1: There is a difference between the median of the 36 mg dose SPN-810  and the median of 
placebo. 
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare the 
median of 36 mg dose of SPN-810 with the median of the Placebo.  The Hodges-Lehmann estimate and 
the associated 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated. The superiority of 36 mg dose to placebo 
will be claimed if the p-value from this analysis < 0.05 at alpha of 5% significance level. There is no 
multiplicity adjustment with respect to the primary endpoint since only 2 treatments are compared.          
6.9.2 Key Secondary Efficacy Analys es 
The key secondary efficacy analysis is the change from Visit 3 to Visit 6 in Investigator CGI-S score. 
The Key Secondary endpoint will be analyzed using Mixed-Effect Model for Repeated Measure (MMRM) 
for the ITT population. The model includes treatment, visit, and interaction between treatment and visit 
as fixed factors, and baseline as covariate. The model parameters will be estimated using restricted 
maximum likelihood method with unstructured variance-covariance matrix and Kenward-Roger 
approximation to estimate denominator degrees of freedom.  The between-group comparison will be 
performed using the simple contrast at the respective visits. The least squares mean of 36 mg dose and 
placebo, the difference in the least squares mean (36 mg dose minus placebo), and the 2-sided 95% CI 
for the difference will be calculated. 
6.9.3 Additional Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
1. Investigator CGI-I score at Visit 6    
2. CHQ-28 score at Visit 6 
3. PSI-4- SF scores at Visit 6 in: 
a. Parental Distress 
b. Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction 
c. Difficult Child 
4. Caregiver CGI-I score at Visit 6 
5. SNAP- IV ADHD scores at Visit 6 in: 
a. Inattention ratings 
b. Hyperactivity/Impulsivity ratings 
c. Oppositional Defiant Disorder 
d. Combined Scale ratings  
6. Percentage of responders with ≥50% reduction in the frequency of IA behaviors from baseline 
7. Percentage of responders with ≥30% reduction in the frequency of IA behaviors from baseline 
The other secondary endpoints will be analyzed using the ITT Population as follows: 
Scores of CGI-I  (investigator and caregiver) will be analyzed using a Mixed-Effect Model for Repeated 
Measure (MMRM) similar to the key secondary outcome.

This document is confidential.  It contains proprietary information of Supernus® Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Any viewing or disclosure 
of such information that is not authorized in writing by the Sponsor is strictly prohibited.  Such information may be used solely 
for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. Scores for CHQ-PF28, PSI-4-SF, and SNAP-IV will be analyzed using the analysis of covariance method 
based on the ITT population. The model includes treatment and baseline as fixed independent 
covariates and Visit 6 value as a response variable. The least squares mean of each treatment group, the 
difference in the least squares mean (36 mg dose minus placebo), and the 2-sided 95% CI for the 
difference will be obtained.    
The percentage of responders with at least 30% reduction and with at least 50% reduction in the 
frequency of IA behaviors per 7 days in the Treatment (Titration and Maintenance) period relative to the 
Base line period will be derived analyzed using the logistic regression model with treatment as explanatory 
variables and baseline as covariate. Odds ratio (36 mg dose/placebo), and 95% CI for the odds ratio and 
p-value will be presented. In addition, the number and percentage of responders will also be tabulated.  
If the null hypothesis for the primary analysis is not rejected, then no multiplicity adjustment will be 
done for the key secondary endpoint. If the key secondary endpoint hypothesis is rejected then, a 
sequential testing procedure to preserve the type I error rate at 0.05 will be conducted for the adiidtinal 
secondary endpoints as described below: 
First, the first of the additional secondary endpoints (Investigator CGI-I score at Visit 6) will be used to 
test H 01: no difference between SPN-810 36 mg and Placebo in the treatment of IA in subjects with 
ADHD in conjunction with standard ADHD treatment.  If this test is rejected, then the 2nd test using the 
same hypothesis will be repeated using the 2nd additional secondary endpoint (CHQ-28 score at Visit 6). 
If the first hypothesis is not rejected then no other additional secondary endpoint test will be 
performed. If the 2nd  test is rejected then the 3rd  test will be conducted for the 3rd additional secondary 
endpoint (PSI-4-SF scores) and so on until the last  additional secondary endpoint is used for testing in 
the above pre-specified order above. 
6.9.4 Sensitivity Analysis 
In the presence of a high drop-out rate, performance of sensitivity analysis is crucial.  The purpose of 
sensitivity analysis is to see whether different methods of handling missing data provide consistent and 
similar results for the primary efficacy analysis.   To this end, two sensitivity analyses will be performed: 
1. Multiple imputation under MAR using available data on the primary endpoint  
2. Placebo-  based imputation under MNAR  
 
6.9.4.1  Multiple imputation under Missing at Random (MAR) 
The multiple imputation (MI) method assumes that the missing data are missing at random (MAR), that 
is, the probability that an observation is missing may depend on the observed values but not the missing 
values. For example, if a subject’s Diary values are available on Day 1 and Day 2 but missing on Day 3, 
then the missing value on Day 3 is related to the non-missing value on Day 1 and Day 2. 
MI is implemented using the following three steps.

This document is confidential.  It contains proprietary information of Supernus® Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Any viewing or disclosure 
of such information that is not authorized in writing by the Sponsor is strictly prohibited.  Such information may be used solely 
for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. 1) SAS PROC MI is applied with input dataset containing some missing values for all days during the 
titration and maintenance period to create 100 datasets. The data sets will include separate 
columns for the frequency of incidences during each day starting from baseline. The Markov 
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method will be used to complete the missingness pattern to a 
monotone pattern separately by treatment arm.  The monotone patterns will be achieved by 
applying sequential imputation based on Bayesian regression with the treatment arm included 
as a covariate.  All copies contain identical values of the non-missing data items, but different 
values imputed for missing values.  
2) For each of these MI data sets, the percent change will be computed as in the observed data set 
and the primary analysis based on the Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be conducted and asymptotic 
95% confidence intervals will be constructed. 
3) To produce a single confidence interval for each dose placebo comparison (e.g., Dose 1 versus 
placebo), PR OC MIANALYZE will be used and Rubin’s combination rules will be applied to the 
treatment effect estimates and associated asymptotic standard errors from the MI data sets 
(Rubin 1987).  The treatment effect estimates will be defined as the midpoints of the asymptotic 
confidence intervals and the standard errors will be defined as the asymptotic standard errors 
(based on the width of the associated 95% confidence intervals) from the Hodges-Lehmann 
estimate of the individual datasets. 
6.9.4.2  Multiple imputation under Missing Not at Random (MNAR) 
This approach can be labeled “worst -case” sensitivity analyses as it assumes that after discontinuation 
subjects from the dosing arms would adopt the outcome model estimated from the placebo arm.  To 
generate missing values fr om this “placebo -based” imputation model, PROC MI with the MNAR 
statement (available in SAS 9.3 and later versions) will be used or, alternatively, SAS macros available at 
the DIA Missing Data Working Group site (Ratitch et al., 2013; Ayele et al., 2014) can be used. 
6.9.5 Supplementary Analysis 
A supplementary analysis based on the per-protocol population will be performed. 
6.10 Sample Size and Power Considerations 
Based on results from the Phase 2 study, a 15-point average difference in favor of the SPN-810 
treatment arms compared with placebo is assumed; the change from baseline to endpoint in total R-
MOAS rating was used to evaluate the difference. The R-MOAS was used because there have been no 
prior studies with the IA diary.  A common standard deviation of 34.83 was obtained from a blinded 
analysis of SPN-810P301 data .  
Based on these parameter assumptions, a sample size of approximately 122 per arm will yield 90% 
power to detect a non-zero difference between the median of SPN-810 treatment and the placebo 
groups using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test with a 2- sided significance level α=0.05.  
The original sample size of 291 was based on having 3 treatment groups (97 subjects per arm) and 
specific assumptions on the drug placebo difference, standard deviation and discontinuation rate.

and subjects planned to be randomized to the 18 mg arm would be re-allocated to the 36 mg or placebo 
arm in a ratio of 2:1.  As such there will be an unequal randomization between the 36 mg dose group 
and placebo.  With this post-interim analysis un-equal randomization, the placebo arm is expected to 
approach approximately 121 subjects of the total of 306 subjects randomized. 
The sample size was calculated using the nQuery Advisor Software, Version 7.

6.13 Safety Analyses 
Evaluation of safety will be performed for the safety population.  Safety data that will be evaluated 
include concomitant medications, AEs, clinical laboratory results, vital signs, ECGs, and findings from the 
physical examinations.  The occurrence of neurological side effects will be assessed by looking at any 
worsening in scores from Visit 3 to each subsequent visit for each of the Simpson-Angus scale, Barnes 
Akathisia scale, and AIMS. Suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior will be measured by C-SSRS. 
All summary tables related to safety analyses will use the safety population. 
6.13.1  Adverse Events 
AEs will be classified into standardized medical terminology from the verbatim description (Investigator 
term) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  AEs will be summarized using 
discrete summaries at the subject and event level by system organ class and preferred term for each 
treatment group.  Similarly, treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized by severity and relationship 
separately.  Verbatim description and all MedDRA level terms, including the lower level terms, for all AEs 
will be contained in the subject data listings.

who receive SM, treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be collected starting after the first dose of SM 
(Visit 3) to the end of the study.  These AEs include those that emerge during treatment or worsen in 
severity during treatment. These AEs will be tabulated, listed and analyzed. 
Separate TEAE incidence tables will be presented for the three treatment groups.  The incidence rates 
for all SADRs will also be summarized as described for all TEAEs. 
In addition, these same tables will be presented by treatment period (Titration, Maintenance, and 
combined Titration and Maintenance).  For the combined Titration and Maintenance Periods, the 
incidence of TEAEs will also be presented by highest severity reported and the dose of SM at first 
occurrence.   
Listings (and tabular summaries, if warranted) of deaths, other SAEs, and other significant TEAEs, 
including TEAEs resulting in treatment discontinuation, will be provided. 
6.13.2  Laboratory Values 
Clinical laboratory values will be summarized by visit by treatment group using descriptive statistics for 
hematology and biochemistry.  For quantitative laboratory parameters, both actual values and change 
from baseline values will be summarized.   
Laboratory test results will be assigned a low, normal, high (LNH) classification according to whether the 
values were b elow (L), within (N), or above (H) the laboratory parameters’ reference ranges provided by 
the central laboratory.  Within-treatment comparisons will be based on three by three tables (shift 
tables) that, for a particular laboratory test, compare the LNH classification at baseline to the LNH 
classification at visit.  By subject-listings of all abnormal laboratory values, i.e., those with L or H 
classification will be provided. 
6.13.3  Vital Signs, Height and Weight 
Vital signs will be summarized by visit by treatment group using descriptive statistics.  Both actual values 
changes from baseline to visit will be summarized.  Descriptive summary statistics (mean, SD, median, 
and range) for vital sign data, height, weight and BMI will be evaluated by treatment group. 
6.13.4  ECG Results 
By-visit tabular summaries of the quantitative ECG parameters and the overall ECG findings (normal, 
abnormal not clinically significant, or abnormal clinically significant) will be presented.   The QT will be 
corrected using Fridericia’s method.  
ECG results will be summarized by visit by treatment group using descriptive statistics (for quantitative 
ECG parameters) and frequency tables (for qualitative ECG parameters, including the overall ECG 
finding).  For quantitative ECG parameters, both actual values and change from screening values will be 
summarized.

Findings from the physical examinations will be listed for each system or area examined. 
6.13.6  Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) 
C-SSRS outcomes will be summarized using number and percent of subjects by categories for suicidal 
ideation only, suicidal behavior only and suicidality (ideation and behavior combined). The summary will 
be presented by treatment groups.  The proportion of subjects in each treatment group will be 
compared with the proportion of subjects in the placebo group using Fisher’s exact test or Chi -square 
test as applicable if appropriate.  
6.13.7  Infrequent Behaviors Checklist 
Infrequent behaviors will be listed for each subject by treatment group. 
6.13.8  Other Special Tests 
The occurrence of neurological side effects will be assessed by looking at the changes in scores from 
baseline to post-baseline visits for each of the Simpson-Angus scale, Barnes Akathisia scale, and AIMS.  
For each item on each of these scales, the number (and percentage) of subjects with a worse score at 
any post-baseline visit, compared to baseline, will be presented.  A listing of these subjects will also be

7 DOCUMENTATION 
7.1 Adherence to the Protocol 
The Investigator agrees, when signing the protocol, to adhere to the instructions and procedures 
described in the protocol and to adhere to the principles of ICH GCP to which the protocol conforms as 
well as all governing local regulations and principles for medical research. 
The protocol, ICF, and appropriate related documents must be reviewed and approved by an IRB 
constituted and functioning in accordance with ICH E6 and any local regulations . Documentation of IRB 
compliance with the ICH and any local regulations regarding constitution and review conduct will be 
provided to the Sponsor. 
A signed letter of study approval from the IRB Chairman must be sent to the Investigator with a copy to 
the Sponsor prior to study start and the release of any SM to the site by the Sponsor or its designee.  If 
the IRB decides to suspend or terminate the study, the Investigator will immediately send the notice of 
study suspension or termination by the IRB to the Sponsor. 
Study progress is to be reported to IRB annually (or as required) by the Investigator or Sponsor, 
depending on local regulatory obligations.  If the Investigator is required to report to the IRB, he/she will 
forward a copy to the Sponsor at the time of each periodic report.   
7.2 Changes to the Protocol 
There are to be no changes to the protocol without written approval from the Sponsor.

This document is confidential.  It contains proprietary information of Supernus® Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Any viewing or disclosure 
of such information that is not authorized in writing by the Sponsor is strictly prohibited.  Such information may be used solely 
for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. Any change to the protocol requires a written protocol amendment or administrative change that must 
be approved by the Sponsor before implementation.  Amendments specifically affecting the safety of 
subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scientific quality of the study require additional approval 
by the applicable IRBs and, in some countries, by the regulatory authority.  These requirements should 
in no way prevent any immediate action from being taken by the Investigator, or by the Sponsor, in the 
interest of preserving the safety of all subjects included in the study.  If an immediate change to the 
protocol is warranted as per the Investigator, for safety reasons, the Medical Monitor and IRB must be 
notified promptly. 
Changes affecting only administrative aspects of the study do not require formal protocol amendments 
or IRB approval, but the IRB must be kept informed of such changes.  In these cases, the Sponsor will 
send a letter to the IRB detailing such changes. 
7.3 Protocol Deviations 
There are to be no Investigator-initiated deviations from the protocol.  Any subject whose treatment 
deviates from the protocol or who is not qualified for study participation may be ineligible for analysis 
and may compromise the study.  The date of and reason for deviations must be documented in all cases. 
Significant or major protocol deviations impacting the safety of the subject or the integrity of the study 
must be reported by the Investigator to the IRB immediately. Reporting of all other protocol deviations 
must adhere to the requirements of the governing IRB. Protocol assessments will continue until the end 
of the study, unless the protocol deviations put the subject at risk or the subject’s condition requires 
that he/she be discontinued from the stud y. 
7.4 Data Quality Assurance 
This study will be organized, performed, and reported in compliance with the protocol, standard 
operating procedures (SOPs), working practice documents, and applicable regulations and guidelines.  
Site visit audits may be made periodically by the Sponsor’s Quality Assurance team or qualified 
designee, which is an independent function from the study conduct team. 
7.4.1 Data Collection 
The primary source document will be the subject’s medical record.  If separate research records are 
maintained by the Investigator(s), both the medical record and the research record will be considered 
the source documents for the purposes of monitoring and auditing the study. 
Electronic data collection techniques will be used to collect data directly from the study sites using 
eCRFs.  The electronic data will be stored centrally in a fully validated clinical database.

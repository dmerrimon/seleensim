WB01 -205 Version 1.0/Amendment_1  May 25, 2018 Page 5 of 32	Background:	
Diabetes	mellitus	and	its	comorbidities	are	currently	a	global,	public	health	crisis,	with	
approximately	30	million	people	diagnosed	with	diabetes	and	an	estimated	80	million	
additional	people	with	prediabetes	in	the	US	alone.	Although	diabetes	is	a	multif actorial	
disease,	it	is	widely	believed	that	the	proliferation	of	diabetes	worldwide	can	be	largely	attributed	to	the	adoption	of	the	Western	diet.	Recently,	research	has	shown	that	the	use	of	
the	Western	diet	has	significant	impacts	on	the	gut	microbiome,	altering	both	the	
composition	and	activities	of	that	microbiome	(The	microbiome	refers	to	the	bacteria,	viruses,	fungi,	phage,	and	other	microorganisms	that	reside	in	the	human	intestine).		
An	individual’s	gut	microbiome	contains	10	to	100-fold	more	genetic	information	than	
resides	in	the	host’s	genome.	There	is	increasing	evidence	that	the	gut	microbiome	offers	
an	opportunity	for	the	development	of	novel	interventions	for	a	variety	of	diseases	by	
modulating	the	composition	of	the	gut	microbiome.	Specific	bacterial	strains	in	the	gut	microbiome	ferment	indigestible	dietary	fibers	in	the	colon	to	produce	short	chain	fatty	
acids	(SCFAs),	such	as	acetate,	propionate,	and	butyrate	(Nohr -2013).		Use	of	the	Western	
diet	leads	to	a	reduction	in	both	the	number	and 	density	of	butyrate -producing	microbes.	
SCFAs,	and	butyrate	in	particular,	bind	to	the	G	protein-coupled	receptors,	GPR119,	GPR41	
and	GPR43,	which	trigger	the	downstream	signaling	pathway	for	GLP-1,	a	hormone	known	to	play	a	key	role	in	the	development	and	progression	of	diabetes.	These	observations	lead	
to	a	hypothesis	that	replenishing	the	content	of	butyrate	microbes	in	the	intestinal	tracts	of	
these	individuals	will	have	beneficial	metabolic	effects.			
Whole	Biome	has	developed	a	proprietary	discovery	platform	to	identify,	characterize	and	
manufacture	beneficial	bacterial	strains.	Whole	Biome	is	developing	a	medical	food	
containing	a	subset	of	commensal	butyrate-producing	strains	and	mucin	regulating	strains	
that	can	be	grown	under	controlled	conditions 	that	meet	the	standards	for	Current	Good	
Manufacturing	Practice	(cGMP),	thus	allowing	them	to	be	administered	to	humans.			
	
Purpose:		
The	goal	of	this	study	is	to	characterize	the	performance	of	a	Continuous	Glucose	Monitoring	
System	in	medical	food	studies.	The	 Freestyle	Libre(™)	Glucose	Sensors1	will	be	used	to	follow	
subjects	 10-day	 glucose	 trajectories	 over	 the	 course	 of	 a	 5-week,	 double -blind,	 placebo -
controlled,	2x2	crossover,	medical	 food	experiment.	The	medical	food	has	been	designed	to	
increase	butyrate	production	and	promote	the	health	of	the	colonic	mucin	layer.

All	ingredients	contained	in	the	study	product	formulations	used	in	this	study	have	received	
Generally	Recognized	as	Safe	(GRAS)	designation.	They	are	commensal	or ganisms	that	have	
been	documented	in	multiple	studies	to	inhabit	the	human	GI	tract	of	healthy	individuals.		The	 organisms	 were	 grown	 under	 controlled	 conditions	 consistent	 with	 Current	 Good	
Manufacturing	Practices	(cGMP)	and	employ	no	animal-derived	products.		The	microbes	and	
all	 ingredients	 utilized	 during	 manufacturing	 were	 food	 grade	 and	 qualified	 as	 Generally	
Recognized	 as	 Safe	 (GRAS).	 	 Each	 of	 the	 microbes	 have	 been	 characterized	 in	 detail	(including	whole	genome	sequencing).		Each	manufactured	lot	has	also	been	tested	with	
standard	methods	to	ensure	the	absence	of	toxins,	heavy	metals,	etc.	
All	strains	have	also	been	tested	 in	vivo	 in	a	diet -induced	obese	mouse	model	and	Sprague-
Dawley	rats.		Each	of	these	rodent	models	were	dosed	for	28	days	at	multiples	≥60	times	
(based	on	body	weight)	the	amounts	being	administered	in	this	study.		In	each	study,	safety	was	 evaluated	 by	 clinical	 observation,	 routine	 chemistry,	 and	 hematology	 parameters,	 in	
addition	to	necropsy	evaluation	at	study	conclusion.		In	bot h	studies,	no	clinical,	laboratory,	
or	necropsy	observations	were	observed	that	suggest	adverse	effects. 			
In	addition,	a	5 -person	safety	study	was	conducted	with	administration	of	3	strains	for	14	
days.	No	adverse	events	or	tolerability	issues	were	reported .	
Finally,	 both	 formulations 	being	 utilized	 in	 this	 study	 (WBF -0009	 and	 WBF -0011)	 are	
currently	 being	 evaluated	 in	 an	 ongoing	 multi-site,	 double -blind,	 placebo -controlled,	
medical-food	trial.	 	This	 ongoing	 study	 is	testing	the	product	in	 approximately	 60	subjects	at	
six	sites	in	the	USA.	It	is	currently	 still	underway	and	 to	date	 there	has	been	 multiple	subjects	
who	have	 up	to	12	weeks	 of	exposure	(in	a	12-week	trial ).	There	have	been	no	reports	of	
significant	related	adverse	events	in	this	study	to	date.

WB01 -205 Version 1.0/Amendment_1  May 25, 2018 Page 8 of 32	A.	Study	Product	Portion	Selection: 	
Selection	of	study	product	portion	size	was	guided	by	the	exposure	in	Sprague -Dawley	rats	
for	28	days	and	a	human	safety	study	as	described	above	under	Study	Product	Safety.	In	the	
human	safety	study,	subjects	consumed	7.0	x	109	CFU	of	strain	WB-STR-0005,	4.0	x	109	CFU	
of	strain	WB -STR-0006,	and	2.0	x	108	CFU	of	strain	WB-STR-0009	daily	 for	7	days,	followed	
by	a	5-fold	increase	in	consumption	to	3.5	x	1010	CFU	of	strain	WB -STR-0005,	2.0	x	1010	CFU	
of	strain	WB -STR-0006,	and	1.0	x	109	CFU	of	strain	WB -STR-0009	daily	 for	an	additional	7	
days.	 The	 administered	 strains	 were	 detected	 in	 stool	 by	 the	 end	 of	 the	 first	 week	 of	consumption,	with	an	increase	in	quantity	following	the	5-fold	increase	in	consumption.		
	
B.	Study	Structure:	 	
This	 is	 a	 double -blind,	 2x2 -crossover	 experiment	 consisting	 of	 two	 two -week	 treatment	
periods.	Subjects	are	randomized	to	one	of	two	arms;	placebo -first	or	placebo -second.	Upon	
completion	of	the	 first	14 -day	treatment	period,	all	subjects	undergo	a	3 -day	washout	period	
before	 beginning	 the	 second	 14 -day	 period.	 After	 the	 second	 treatment	 period,	 subjects	
undergo	a	3 -day	washout	period	to	complete	the	study.	 At	completion	of	the	study	subjects	
will	be	interviewed	 using	 two	structured	questionnaires	 about	the	study	design,	procedures ,	
date	and	 changes	in	health 	(Appendix	D)	 that	they	may	have	noticed	during	the	course	of	the	
study.		
	
C.	Duration:		
The	total	duration	of	a	subject’s	participation	will	 be	approximately	5	weeks,	including	an	
enrollment	visit	occurring	2	days	prior	to	the	 baseline	visit. 	
Throughout	the	study,	subjects	will	wear	a	14 -day	continuous	glucose	sensor.	This	sensor	
will	be	applied	on	study	day	 -2,	12,	26	at	the	same	location	on	an	individual’s	left	arm.		
On	days	-2,	12,	14,	26,	31	subjects	will	receive	the 	Appendix		A:	Instructions	for	Collecting	
Stool	Sample	
On	study	days	1,	14,	18,	31	and	35,	subjects	will		(1)	deliver	a	fecal	sample	(self -collected

Once	screened	and	qualified	 for	entry,	subjects	will	be	instructed	as	follows: 	
1. Take	no	new	prescription	or	over -the-counter	medications	excluded	by	the	
protocol	without	prior	notification	of	the	investigator.	 	
2. Remain	on	their	usual	diet	and	exercise	regimen	throughout	the	study	unless	instructed	to	change	by	the	investigator.	
3. Fast	overnight	for	at	least	8	hours	(no	food	or	beverage	except	water)	prior	to	each	visit.		(Note:	this	includes	tea	and	coffee.) 	
CONFIDENTIAL  
WB01 -205 Version 1.0/Amendment_1  May 25, 2018 Page 13 of 32	4. Do	not	donate	blood	for	the	duration	of	the	study. 	
The	sponsor	should	be	contacted	if	the	investigator	is	informed	of	any	violations	of	these	
restrictions.	The	sponsor	will	decide	whether	a	subject	with	restriction	violations	will	be	
granted	a	deviation	and	allowed	to	continue	study	participation. 	
J.	Study	Food	Product:	
Study	product	will	consist	of	coated	capsules	designed	to	pass	through	the	stomach	intact	
and	disintegrate	in	the	terminal	portion	of	the	small	intestine.		Subjects	will	be	instructed	
to	take	3	capsules	of	the	food	product	30	minutes	before	the	morning	and	evening	meals	beginning	with	the	evening	meal	on	study-day	one	through	the	completion	of	14	days 	
dosing;	and	again	on	study	day	18 	through	the	completion	of	another	14	days	dosing.			
The	capsules	will	be	identical	in	general	appearance,	size,	and	color	across	all	the	tr eatment	
arms.		Each	formulation	capsule	will	contain	the	designated	commensal	microbe	mixture	(Table	1);	and	inulin,	sucrose,	trehalose,	glycerin,	hydroxypropyl	methylcellulose,	hydroxypropyl	methylcellulose	phthalate,	titanium	dioxide,	polyvinylpyrrolidon e,	skim	
milk,	and	colloidal	silicon	dioxide.		Placebo	(WBF-0009)	capsules	will	contain	colloidal	silicon	dioxide.	All	ingredients	are	GRAS	certified.	
1. Packaging	and	Storage 	
The	study	food	product	will	be	provided	in	sealed,	labelled	screw	cap	 bottles.		Each	bottle	
will	contain	45	capsules	to	support	7	days	of	administration	(42	capsules),	plus	3	excess	capsules	 to	 allow	 for	 replacement	 of	 lost	 capsules,	 etc.	 Additionally,	 the	 capsules	 for	 all	
treatment	arms,	will	have	identical	appearances	to	s upport	the	study	blind. 	
The	study	food	product	should	be	refrigerated	at	4	
o	C	except	when	the	subject	removes	the

Study	materials	will	be	provided	to	subjects	by	the	investigator,	medically	qualified	
sub-investigator,	or	other	qualified	study -site	personnel.	The	study	food	 product	will	
be	provided	with	a	lunch	bag	and	ice	packs	to	keep	the	 product	cold	until	it	can	be	
refrigerated.	Under	no	circumstance	will	the	investigator	or	sub-investigator(s)	allow	the	study	product	to	be	used	other	than	as	directed	by	the	protocol	or	to	be	
administered	to	any	persons	other	than	subjects	who	have	signed	an	informed	consent	
form	and	are	participating	in	the	study. 	
Study	personnel	will	be	responsible	for	instructing	subjects	to	administer	the	correct	amounts	of	study	product,	i.e.	3	capsules	30	minutes	before	each	morning	and	evening	meal.			
3. Study	Product	Accountability 	
The	investiga tor	listed	will	be	responsible	for	study	accountability.	 Under	no	
circumstances	will	the	investigator	or	sub-investigators	allow	the	study	product	to	be	used	other	than	as	specified	in	the	protocol.	
4. Amount	Administration,	Route	and	Schedule 	
Study	food	 product	will	be	self-administered	by	the	subject	30	minutes	prior	to	the	
morning	and	evening	meals	as	described	above.	
Study	product	dispensing	and	returns	will	be	recorded	on	a	study	product	disposition	
form,	to	provide	a	complete	accounting	of	the	receipt,	disposition,	and	return	of	study	
product.		At	the	completion	of	the	study,	all	remaining	used	and	unused	study	product,	empty	containers,	and	copies	of	the	completed	study	product	disposition	forms	will	be	
returned	by	the	subject. 	
K.	Study	Methods:	 	
Prior	to	study	visits	requiring	a	standardized	meal	test,	subjects	will	be	asked	to	fast	
overnight	for	at	least	8	hours	(i.e.,	no	food	or	beverage	except	water).	Subjects	should	report	to	the	clinical	study	site	in	the	morning	of	each	scheduled	visit	(ideally	between	
0800	and	0900	hours).	For	all	study	visits	which	require	the	subjects	to	be	fasting,	the	
subjects	should	refrain	from	administering	the	morning	portion	of	study	product	prior	to	
the	visit	and	bring	the	morning’s	portion	of	study	product	with	them	to	the	study -site	to

Unique	Study 	
Procedure		Procedure	Description 	
CGM	 sensor-
instructions 	• Subjects	are	 instructed	on	using	the	patch	and	reader	device.	First,	before	
distributing	reader	or	applying	patch ,	instruct 	the	subject 	to	refrain	from		 using	
any	data	produced	by	the	system	in	a	'treatment'	context.	Re -iterate	that	this	is	a	
research	study	and	that	this	is	not	a	medical	device.	Continuous	glucose	data	will	
not	be	available	to	subjects	until	the	end	of	the	stu dy.	
• Ensure	subject	is	not	likely	to	be	swimming	or	submerged	for	more	than	30	
minutes	at	a	time,	 subject	 will	not	be	in	extreme	temperatures,	will	not	remove	
the	patch	and	will	let	us	know	if	the	patch	has	failed	or	fallen	off	during	the	study.	
Furthermore ,	if	these	events	do	occur	subjects	will	be	instructed	to	add	 a	
comment	 using	the	provided	application. 	
• Ensure	that	the	subject	can	scan	the	sensor	at	least	every	8	hours.	Instruct	subject	
that	they	may	be	notified	via	SMS 	(text	message)	 if	they	have	not	s canned	within	
the	last	8	hours.	Subjects	should	connect	the	reader	devices	to	a	wifi	network	at	
home	 or	at	work.	If	no	wifi	network	is	available	to	subject,	ensure	that	subject	
brings	reader	device	to	study	site	at	each	visit. 	
• All	subjects	should	use	the	s ame	location	on	the	left	arm	to	apply	the	patch,	
unless	there	are	specific	issues	with	the	left	arm,	e.g.,	scarring,	tattoos,	etc.	If	
subject	is	unable	to	use	left	arm,	subject	should	consistently	use	right	arm	
throughout	the	study. 	
• After	subjects	have	the 	sensor	applied	(see	'Apply -sensor').	Demonstrate	
scanning	the	sensor	and	confirm	that	device	is	correctly	associated	with	subject. 	
• The	reader	will	stay	with	a	subject	for	the	entire	study	and	will	be	stickered	with	
a	subject- specific	barcode. 	
• Demonstrate	 the	distinct	ways	of	scanning	the	patch	(underarm/overarm).	
Instruct	subject	on	location	of	sensor	on	reader	device. 	
• Demonstrate	adding	comments	using	reader	device	using	both	notes	and	photos.	
Instruct	subject	that	photographs 	of	the	food	to	be	consumed	 should	be	taken	 at	
every	meal,	 before	any	food	or	beverage	is	consumed.	This	excludes	water,	tea	
and	coffee,	but	includes	alcoholic	beverages.	If	the	subject	misses	a	consumption	
event,	they	should	add	 a	comment	 including	the	time	of	consumption,	e.g.,'ate	
burrito	 -2	hours'	or	'ate	burrito	2	hours	ago' 	
CONFIDENTIAL  
WB01 -205 Version 1.0/Amendment_1  May 25, 2018 Page 16 of 32	• Instruct	subject	on	procedure	for	a	sensor	being	knocked	partially	free.	Subject	
should	lightly	press	and	hold	the	sensor	for	a	moment	to	reaffirm	adhesive.	
Subject	should	add	 a	comment	 that	sensor	was	'reseat ed'	
Apply -sensor	 • Sensor	should	be	applied	to	the	left	arm	unless	subject	had	previously	applied	
sensor	to	right	arm	or	subject	wishes	to	use	right	arm.	Subject	should	not	change	
arm	or	arm	location	during	study.	Follow	instructions	for	patch	 application.

Register -reader	 • Study	staff	to	scan	reader	barcode	 and	subject	barcode	for	reader	
registration.	
Distribute- SCK	 • Give	subject	stool	 collection	kit	(SCK)	 and	describe	stool	collection	procedure 	–	
written	instructions	included .	
• Explain	importance	of	attempting	to	collect	the	sample	at	 the	same	time	of	day	for	
each	fecal	collection	event	throughout	the	study.	We	know	that	the	microbiome	
varies	regularly	with	things	like	time	of	day,	time	since	last	meal,	etc.	For	most	
people,	the	 most	consistent	time	to	collect	a	sample	is	shortly	after	waking	up. 	
• Upon	receiving	the	kit,	subjects	 should	be	 instructed	to	store	the	 unused	 kit	in	the	
freezer,	so	that	the	ice -packs	can	completely	freeze	prior	to	 stool	collection	and	
transporting	the	sa mple	to	Whole	Biome. 	
• 36-12	hours	prior	to	subject's	standardized -meal	visit,	subjects	should	remove	
the	collection	kit	from	the	freezer	and	following	the	procedure	outlined	in:	
Appendix 	A.	After	collecting	the	sample,	return	the	sealed	bucket	to	the	cooler 	
and	return	the	cooler	to	the	freezer	for	at	least	12	hours	before	transporting	it	to	
Whole	Biome. 	
• Instruct	subject	that	collected	SCK	should	not	remain	outside	of	freezer	for	more	
than	4	hours	in	transit	to	study	site	for	drop	off. 	
Standardized	Meal 	 • At	4	time	 point s	throughout	the	study,	subjects	will	perform	a	fasted	meal -
tolerance	test	( Arm	1	 Baseline	&	Measurements,	 Arm	 2	Baseline	&	
Measurements).	This	test	is	administered	following	a	 8-hour	fast. 	
• Following	a	 8-hour	fast,	subjects	will	 perform 	a	pre -meal	scan	and	finger -stick	
measurement	of	their	blood	glucose	using	a	provided	sensor	and	strip.	Subjects	
will	then	consume	a	standardized	meal	 supplement	drink	 (See	 Appendix 	C).	
Optional:	At	30	minutes	subjects	will 	scan	the	sensor	and	take	a	final	blood	
glucose	measure	at	the	study	site.	Subjects	will	be	asked	to	continue	to	fast	for	an	
additional	hour,	scanning	the	sensor	again	at	minute	60	and	90.

L.	Ethical	Safety	Considerations: 	
The	overall	risk	 to	subjects	participating	in	this	study	is	low.		The	safety	of	the	microbes	in	
the	study	product	formulations	are	all	commensal	organisms	manufactured	according	to	
cGMP	standards	and	employ	no	animal	derived	products.		(See	Section	A	above	for	detailed	
discussion.)	
M.	Safety	Assessments:	 	
Safety	will	be	assessed	throughout	the	study	by	examination	of 	reported	adverse	events	
(AEs).	
Reporting	of	Adverse	Events 	
Adverse	events	will	be	reported	in	accordance	with	the	National	Cancer	Institute -	
Common	Terminology	Criteria	for	Adverse	Events	(NCI-CTCAE),	version	4.03.		The	
CTCAE	grades	the	severity	of	the	AE	based	upon	Grades	1	through	5	and	lists	unique	clinical	descriptions	of	severity	for	each	AE.	
Grade	1:		 Mild;	asymptomatic	or	mild	symptoms;	clinical	or	diagnostic	observations	
only;	intervention	not	indicated.	Grade	2: 		Moderate;	minimal,	local	or	noninvasive	intervention	indicated	or	limiting	age-
appropriate	instrumental	ADL.	
Grade	3: 		Severe	or	medically	significant	but	not	immediately	life-threatening	
hospitalization	or	prolongation	of	hospitalization	indicated;	disabling;	limiting	self -care	
ADL.	
Grade	4: 		Life	threatening	consequences;	urgent	intervention	indicated. 	
Grade	5: 		Death	related	to	AE.	
In	the	event	of	the	occurrence	of	a	same	category	of	three	or	more	grade	3	CTCAE	or	two	
grade	4	CTCAE	or	one	grade	5	CTCAE,	the	trial	will	be	paused,	evaluated	for	safety	by	the	Safety	Monitoring	Committee	and	allowed	to	proceed	only	after	the	Committee	
determines	the	causality	is	not	associated	with	the	investigational	food	study	product.

Adverse	Event	
Any	untoward	medical	occurrence	associated	with	the	use	of	a	therapy	in		 humans,	
whether	considered	treatment	related	or	not	treatment	related. 	
Life-Threatening	Any	untoward	medical	occurrence	that	places	the	patient	or	subject	
at		 immediate	risk	of	death.	It	does	not	include	an	adverse	event	or	suspected	
	 adverse	reaction	that,	had	it	occurred	in	a	more	severe	form,	might	have	caused	
	 death.	
Serious	Adverse	Event	(SAE)	ANY	SAE	THAT	OCCURS	AFTER	THE	SIGNING	OF	THE	ICF	
THROUGH	30	DAYS	AFTER	ADMINISTRATION	OF	THE 	LAST	AMOUNT	OF	STUDY	
MEDICATION	MUST	BE	REPORTED	IMMEDIATELY	(WITHIN	24	HOURS	OF	
KNOWLEDGE)	TO	THE	SPONSOR’S	MEDICAL	MONITOR	(858-342-7057).	FAX	THE	SAE	
REPORT	FORM	TO	THE	NUMBER	LISTED	ON	THE	FORM. 	
An	adverse	event	is	considered	"Serious"	if,	in	the	view	of	either	the	investigator	or	
sponsor,	it	results	in	any	of	the	following	outcomes: 	
● Death	
● A	life-threatening	adverse	event 	
● Inpatient	hospitalization	or	prolongation	of	existing	hospitalization 	
● A	persistent	or	significant	incapacity	or	substantial	disruption	of	the	ability	to	conduct	normal	life	functions	
● A	congenital	anomaly/birth	defect	
Important	medical	events	that	may	not	result	in	death,	be	life-threatening,	
or	require	hospitalization	may	be	considered	serious	when,	based	upon	appropriate	medical	judgment,	they	may	jeopardize	the	patient	or	subject	
and	may	require	medical	or	surgical	intervention	to	prevent	one	of	the	
outcomes	listed	in	this	definition.	
Any	SAE,	unexpected	events,	or	death	encountered	during	the	study	and	for	
30	days	thereafter	will	be	reported	to	the	principal	and/or	co -investigators	
by	the	subject 	or	their	representative	in	the	case	of	death .	The	investigator	
will	immediately	report	the	SAE/unexpected	event	or	death	within	24	hours	of	being	notified	to	the	sponsor 	in	writing	for	review	and	
assessment/causality	confirmation,	and	to	the	IRB	(per	FDA	requirements).	
	
CONFIDENTIAL  
WB01 -205 Version 1.0/Amendment_1  May 25, 2018 Page 19 of 32	Unexpected	Adverse	Event		
An	adverse	event	is	considered	“unexpected”	if	it	is	not	listed	in	the	study	
product	data	information	document	or	is	not	listed	at	the	specificity	or	
severity	that	has	been	 previously	 observed. 	
FDA	guidelines	recognize	that:	
1. “Individual	adverse	event	reports	generally	require	an	evaluation	of	their	relevance	and	significance 	to	the	study,	including	an	evaluation	of	
other	adverse	events,	before	they	can	be	considered	an	unanticipated	problem,”		
and	
2. “All	reports	to	the	IRB	of	unanticipated	problems	should	explain	
clearly	why	the	event	described	represents	a	‘problem’	for	the	study	
and	why	it	is	‘unanticipated.’’ 	
Investigators	are	required	to	report	unexpected	adverse	events	that	fit	the	
following	criteria	 within	10	working	days	 of	the	time	the	investigator	has	
become	informed	of	the	event(s)	to	the	IRB	if	applicable 	and	sponsor. 	
The	following	guidelines	provide	further	definition	to	unexpected	adverse	
events:	
• Event	is	 unexpected	(in	terms	of	nature,	severity,	or	frequency)	
given	(a)	the	research	procedures	that	are	described	in	the	protocol -related	documents,	such	as	the	IRB-	approved	research	
protocol	and	informed	consent	form,	or	the	investigator	brochure;	and	(b)	the	characteristics	of	the	subject	population	being	studied, 	
• Related	or	possibly	related	to	participation	in	the	research	
(possibly	related	means	there	is	a	reasonable	possibility	 that	the	
incident,	experience,	or	outcome	may	have	been	caused	by	the	procedures	involved	in	the	research);	and 	
• Suggests	that	the	research	 places	subjects	or	others	at	a	
greater	risk	of	harm	(including	physical,	psychological,	
economic,	or	social	harm)	than	was	previously	known	or	recognized. 	
If	the	adverse	event	is	clearly	not	related	to	the	study	food	product,	device,	procedures,	or	washout	process,	it	would	not	represent	a	risk	to	other	
subjects	in	the	research	or	a	“problem”	for	the	study	and,	therefore,	does	
CONFIDENTIAL  
WB01 -205 Version 1.0/Amendment_1  May 25, 2018 Page 20 of 32	not	have	to	be	reported	to	the	IRB. 	
1. Intensity 	
The	intensity	of	each	adverse	event	will	be	characterized	as	mild,	moderate,	or	
severe,	as	follows: 	
● MILD:	Usually	transient,	requires	no	special	treatment,	and	does	not	interfere	with	the	subject’s	daily	activities. 	
● MODERATE:	Usually	causes	a	low	level	of	inconvenience	or	concern	to	the	
subject	and	may	interfere	with	daily	activities,	but	is	usually	ameliorated	
by	simple	therapeutic	measures.	
● SEVERE:	Interrupts	a	subject’s	usual	daily	activities	and	generally	requires	systemic	drug	therapy	or	other	treatment.	
2. Causality	
The	investigator	will	grade	the	association	of	the	adverse	event	as	UNRELATED	or	RELATED	to	study	medication.	The	following	criteria	should	
be	considered	for	determining	relatedness: 	
• UNRELATED:	The	adverse	event	is	judged	to	be	produced	by	the	subject's	clinical	state	or	by	other	therapies	administered	to	the	
subject.	
• RELATED:	The	adverse	event	is	judged	to	be	related	to	the	
administration	of	study	medication.	
N.	Data	Management: 	
All	data	collected	will	be	entered	onto	standardized	Case	Report	Forms	(CRFs)	and	entered	
into	a	database	that	will	allow	summaries	and	the	statis tical	analyses	outlined	in	the	
statistical	analysis	plan	to	be	conducted.		Upon	conclusion	of	the	study,	all	materials	will	be	archived. 	
O.	Statistical	Considerations: 	
Analysis	Populations: 	
	
● Intent-To-Treat	(ITT):	The	ITT	Population	will	include	all	randomized	subjects	who	
receive	at	least	one	portion	of	randomized	study	product,	i.e.	Placebo	(WBF -0009)	or	
WBF -0011.	
● Evaluable: 	The	evaluable	population	will	include	all	ITT	subjects	who	have	had	adequate	
exposure	to	the	randomized	study	product	during	the	5 -week	treatment	period.

P.	Safety	Analyses: 	
All	non-serious	adverse	events	occurring	from	the	time	of	randomization	through	the	
subject’s	final	study	visit	will	be	recorded	in	the	adverse	event	electronic	CRF.	Adverse	
events	will	be	collected	for	 subjects	who	terminate	early	from	the	study	until	the	time	of	
their	withdrawal. 	
All	serious	adverse	events	occurring	from	the	time	of	randomization	through	the	subject’s	
final	study	visit	will	be	recorded	on	the	Serious	Adverse	Event	eform	(eSAE).		Serious 	
adverse	events	will	be	collected	for	subjects	who	terminate	early	from	the	study	until	the	time	of	their	withdrawal.		
All	adverse	events	will	be	tabulated	and	ordered	by	decreasing	frequency	for	all	subjects	by	
study	arm.	If	appropriate,	the	incidence	of	adverse	events	will	be	compared	by	Fisher’s	
exact	test.	Special	attention	will	be	given	to	subjects	who	discontinue	treatment	because	of	
adverse	events. 		
Additionally,	treatment	emergent	adverse	events	(TEAEs)	of	special	interest,	i.e.,	specif ic	
gastrointestinal	symptoms,	will	be	summarized	separately,	if	deemed	necessary.	
All	vital	signs,	and	any	laboratory 	results	will	be	listed	by	subject	and	visit,	including	
scheduled	and	unscheduled/repeat	measurements.		Laboratory	assessments	that	are	
outside	of	normal	ranges	and/or	with	potential	clinical	importance	will	be	flagged.		
Baseline	values,	the	values	at	each	visit,	and	changes	from	baseline	values	will	be	summarized	descriptively	for	each	of	the	quantitative	laboratory	assessments.		
	
Q.	Sample	 Size	and	Power	Calculation: 	
The	primary	purpose	of	this	study	is	to	enable	subsequent	power	calculations;	the	sample	
size	 has	 been	 selected	 to	 minimize	 recruitment	 time	 and	 study	 costs	 while	 obtaining	sufficient	precision	for	subsequent	experimental	design.			
R.	Informed	Consent:	
Each	participant	will	be	provided	with	oral	and	written	information	describing	the	nature,	
purpose	and	duration	of	the	study,	procedures	involved	in	the	study,	
participation/termination	conditions,	and	risks	and	benefits.		Prior	to	initiation	of	any	
study -related	procedures,	subjects	will	sign	and	date	the	informed	consent	form	(ICF)	to	
participate	in	the	study .

You	will	be	 given	a	stool	collection	kit	to	take	home	so	that	you	can	collect	the	sample	at	
your	convenience. 	
	
Stool	Collection	Kit	Checklist:	
	
1) A	Stool	Collection	Device	(SCD)	consisting	of	3	separate	components	(Figure	1) 	
a) A	Stability	Frame	for	positioning	the	collection	bucket	on	the	toilet 	
b) A	barcoded	Stool	Collection	Bucket		
c) A	Stool	Bucket	Lid	with	a	label	for	the	date	and	time	of	day	
2) Disposable	Gloves	 -	2	pairs 	
3) Sanitary	Wipes	
4) Ballpoint	Pen	 	
5) Stool	Collection	Bucket	Cooler	&	Ice	Packs 	
	
The	Stool	Collection	Bucket	Cooler	with	Ice	Packs,	Bucket	and	Lid	should	be	stored	in	your	
freezer	upon	arriving	home.	Collecting	a	Sample:	
	
Note:		Always	use	disposable	gloves	when	handling	an	open	bucket.	
	
1) Obtain	the	Stool	Bucket	and	Lid	from	the	Stool	Collection	Bucket	Cooler	in	your	freezer.	
2) Completely	empty	bladder.	
3) Remove	all	items	from	the	biohazard	bag.	
4) Use	a	sanitary	wipe	to	cleanse	toilet	seat	and	rim	of	toilet	bowl.	
5) Fill	out	the	date	(month/day/year)	and	check	the	box	corresponding	to	the	time	of	day	on	the	bucket	lid	label	with	the	provided	ballpoint	pen. 	
6) Remove	the	lid	from	the	bucket	and	place	the	lid	inside	of	the	biohazard	bag.	
7) Assemble	the	SCD	by	inserting	the	Collection	Bucket	securely	into	the	Stability	Frame	(Figure	1).	
8) Lift	the	toilet	seat	and	place	the	 SCD	horizontally	on	the	edges	of	the	toilet	bowl.	The	
	narrow	side	of	the	frame	should	face	towards	the	rear	end	of	the	toilet	bowl	(Figure	
3A).	
9) Lower	the	toilet	seat	to	secure	the	SCD	(Figure	4A/Figure	4B).	
10)  Sit	on	the	toilet	and	arrange	yourself	so	that	the	stool	sample	will	fall	directly	into	the	
bucket.	Note:		Do	not	urinate	or	place	toilet	paper	into	the	Collection	Bucket.

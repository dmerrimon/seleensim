Revised 6-2016  3	2.	Purpose	of	the	Study (See Initial Review Guidelines Section 2) 1 Literature Review:  2  3 Heavy drinking peaks during late adolescence and early adulthood and is especially common among 18 – 4 24 year-old young adults who attend college (Hingson et al., 2005). College students often drink large 5 quantities of alcohol over relatively brief time periods, which can result in dangerously high blood 6 alcohol concentrations (Fourneir et al., 2004).  These patterns of heavy drinking place college students 7 at high risk for alcohol-related health and social problems.  Hingson et al. (2005) estimated that alcohol 8 use contributed to over 1,700 deaths among U.S. college students in 2001.  Large numbers of students 9 also experienced other past-year alcohol-related health and social problems, including having 10 unprotected sex, driving under the influence of alcohol, being injured due to drinking, being assaulted or 11 hit by a student who was drinking, and being the victim of sexual assault or date rape (Hingson et al., 12 2005).  Heavy drinking can also impede critical developmental tasks such as educational attainment and 13 career development (Bachman et al., 1997), which may in turn increase risk for substance abuse and 14 other problematic outcomes during adulthood (Bennette et al.,1999).  Heavy drinkers tend to enter 15 college with lower academic aptitude, are less engaged in academic activities during college, and finish 16 with lower grades than other students (Ham & Hope, 2003). 17  18 Growing recognition of these social and health problems has made the prevention and treatment of 19 college student alcohol abuse a significant research and public health priority (Ham & Hope, 2003).  20 Colleges are an especially promising context for prevention and early intervention because 21 approximately one-third of young adults do not begin to drink heavily until they arrive at college 22 (Gledhill-Hoyt et al., 2000).  Most students begin drinking during their 1st year, which makes the initial 23 transition to college an important time to conduct prevention programs. 24  25 The most promising interventions for college student drinkers include personalized feedback about 26 drinking patterns, blood alcohol content (BAC), and alcohol-related risks along with advice to moderate 27 drinking (Dimeff et al., 1999; Larimer et al., 2004/2005).  Typically the personal drinking feedback and 28 advice are delivered in the context of a motivational interview (MI), a supportive and nonjudgmental 29 therapeutic approach that focuses on increasing motivation to change drinking (Miller & Rollnick, 2002). 30 The goals of these interventions are pragmatic and focused on reducing drinking and related 31 consequences.  For example, students are advised to limit their overall alcohol quantity and to space 32 their drinks out over several hours.  These brief motivational interventions (BMIs) result in drinking 33 reductions that exceed various control conditions (Murphy et al., 2001, 2004). 34  35 In one of the largest BMI trials with college students, Marlatt et al. (1998) identified 300 incoming 36 college students who were at risk for alcohol problems based on their reported levels of drinking in high 37 school and randomly assigned them to either an assessment-only control condition or a single-session 38 BMI (Marlatt et al., 1998).  Students who received a BMI showed significant reductions in drinking 39 quantity and alcohol-related problems relative to untreated controls throughout the 4-year follow-up.  40 The amount of change was small, but meaningful in light of the harm reduction goals.  Average quantity 41 consumed per occasion decreased from 4.7 to 3.6 standard drinks among treated participants, a mean 42 shift from risky “binge” drinking to more moderate and less harmful consumption levels.  These findings 43 were replicated by Borsari and Carey (2000), and other studies have found an advantage for BMIs 44 relative to active control conditions.  Murphy et al. (2001) found that, among the heavier drinkers in a 45 sample of undergraduates, an individual BMI intervention showed a significant advantage for reducing 46 total drinks per week and frequency of heavy drinking over a traditional educational intervention. 47 
Revised 6-2016  4	Several empirically supported alcohol treatments for adults (e.g., contingency management, community 48 reinforcement, and coping skills training) attempt to develop viable alternatives to substance use such 49 as recreational pursuits, exercise,  or increased engagement in career related activities (Petry et al., 50 2000). Recently, research in college student populations has demonstrated support for a behavioral 51 economic supplement to BMIs that addresses a previous limitation that these interventions do not 52 attempt to also increase positive activities that might substitute for alcohol and drug use (see Murphy et 53 al., 2012a). A pilot study at the University of Memphis found that the combination of an alcohol-focused 54 BMI and Substance-Free Activity Session (SFAS) resulted in significantly greater reductions in alcohol 55 problems and binge drinking compared to an alcohol BMI + relaxation session control intervention 56 (Murphy et al., 2012a,b). Given the promising results of the in-person SFAS, the proposed project will 57 develop and evaluate a mobile-based (text-message) BMI + SFAS that attempts to increase students’ 58 participation in academic, community, and recreational activities while taking full advantage of the 59 technological advances many young adults already own and use (Anderson, 2015).  60  61 Possible Contribution: 62 The goals of the SFAS - increasing student engagement in academic, campus, and career-related 63 activities- are consistent with the priorities of most colleges. Therefore, if the mobile intervention is 64 found to be efficacious, it would likely be appealing to colleges and has the potential for cost-effective 65 and widespread dissemination.  66  67 Study Goals:  68 The proposed project will develop and empirically evaluate a mobile-based alcohol brief intervention 69 and substance-free activity session. To do this, study personnel will develop and systematically evaluate 70 an intervention that includes efficacious elements of brief alcohol interventions along with personalized 71 feedback. Intervention elements will be delivered remotely via personalized web-based feedback and 72 text-messages.  We will evaluate the efficacy of the mobile-based brief alcohol intervention compared 73 to mobile-based alcohol and nutrition education in the context of a randomized pilot trial. 74  75 3.	Methods	and	Procedures (See Initial Review Guidelines Section 3) 76 This research will be divided into two stages:  Stage 1, the screening stage, and Stage 2, the randomized 77 pilot trial stage.  During the screening stage, participants will be recruited and screened for eligibility to 78 participate in Stage 2.  During the randomized controlled trial stage (stage 2), we will test the feasibility 79 and efficacy of a mobile-based BMI + SFAS in the context of a two-group experimental design.  All 80 students (N = 100) will complete a baseline assessment and will then be randomly assigned to either 81 receive a mobile-based BMI + SFAS, or mobile-based alcohol and nutrition education. Each group will 82 receive 4 weeks of booster contact (1 booster session per week) on material from their respective study 83 condition. Outcomes will be assessed after the fourth booster session and at a 3-month follow-up. 84 Procedures: 85 Screening to Identify Eligible Participants: 86 In order to identify enough eligible participants, we estimate that we will need to screen approximately 87 1000 college students (recruited through the University of Memphis psychology subject pool, emails 88 sent to undergraduate courses, classroom screeners, local and university publication advertisements, 89 and flyers around the University of Memphis campus and other local college campuses; see Appendix 90 for recruitment flyer/ad). Participants will complete a brief screening survey via classroom screeners, 91 
Revised 6-2016  5	the SONA system or through a secure weblink sent via email or posted in flyers to identify those 92 students who might be eligible to participate in the study. In order to be contacted about the clinical 93 trial, respondents will be asked to provide contact information. Ads and flyers will also include study 94 contact information for interested respondants/participants to contact study staff directly and screen 95 for eligibility. Given that heavy drinking levels are highest among teenagers and twenty year olds, 96 college students 18 to 25 years who report two or more binge drinking episodes in the past month (4/5 97 or more drinks for women/men on one occasion) will be eligible to participate in this trial (eligibility 98 criteria listed in Section 7). We expect 100 students to participate in the clinical trial. 99 If the participant meets eligibility criteria as described above, the researcher will speak with the 100 participant via phone call to confirm eligibility status, explain the project procedures and confidentiality 101 in more detail, and allow the participant the opportunity to ask any questions they may have about the 102 study.  Text messaging and email may also be used as methods to communicate with participants who 103 meet the eligibility criteria and will be used as the primary method of communication if the student 104 prefers. Participants will be informed that the study is designed to learn more about college students’ 105 lifestyle and health behaviors and that the study will involve random assignment to one of two 106 treatment conditions, along with 4 booster sessions by text-message, a post-intervention survey 107 immediately following the 4th booster session, and a survey follow-up three months after their last 108 booster session. If the participant expresses interest in the study, the study administrator will invite 109 them to participate in further phases of the study. If students do not meet the eligibility criteria at the 110 time of screening, but indicate drinking in the past 6-months, they may be contacted later and 111 rescreened via phone, text message or email and then enrolled if interested in the study. Eligible and 112 interested individuals will remotely read and e-sign the consent form, provide contact information, and 113 complete the initial baseline assessment via a secure web-link.  114 All self-report measures will be completed by the participant via a secure, web-based survey. Prior to 115 completing baseline measures, participants will be provided with a consent form and will be informed of 116 the study’s purpose, risks, benefits, compensation, and all other pertinent study details. Participants will 117 be provided with a phone number and email address should they have questions and will also be 118 informed in the consent that they can discontinue the study at any time. If participants choose not to e-119 sign the consent form or decide not to participate in the study at any time, they will be provided with 120 information about college student alcohol misuse on websites, hotlines, and local resources to learn 121 more about their drinking if they are interested. The remote web-based assessment will last 122 approximately 30 minutes. After completing the assessment, participants will be randomized to either  123 a) the mobile-based BMI+SFAS (mBMI+SFAS); or b) mobile-based alcohol and nutrition education 124 (mANE) (both described below). Immediately following the baseline assessment and random 125 assignment, participants will take part in a 60-minute session of either the mobile BMI or mobile Alcohol 126 Education. Later the same week, participants will take part in either one 60-minute session of the 127 mobile SFAS or mobile Nutrition Education. The interventionist conducting the mobile BMI or Alcohol 128 Education earlier in the week will also conduct the mobile SFAS or Nutrition Education, respectively, as 129 well as all booster contact. A brief 3-item survey will be administered immediately following the mobile 130 SFAS or Nutrition Education session that will solicit initial impressions and feedback on these respective 131 sessions. 132 Booster contact will take place once a week for four weeks for approximately 20 minutes. Booster 133 contact for the mBMI+SFAS group will also collect information on past week time allocation, level of 134 discounting of future monetary rewards (delay discounting), and the subjective reward value of alcohol, 135 which are associated with problematic alcohol use. Upon completion of the booster contact, 136 
Revised 6-2016  6	participants will complete a post-intervention assessment survey via secure web link. The post-137 intervention survey will collect information on the participants’ experiences with the mobile-based 138 interventions and will solicit feedback about the interventions. They will then be thanked for their 139 participation and reminded of their 3-month follow-up appointment. 140 For completing the baseline assessment participants will be awarded either 1 hour of credit for 141 participation, which the researcher will grant through the SONA System, or $25. Participants may earn 142 $10 for completing at least 3 booster contact surveys, and another $10 for completing the post-143 intervention assessment survey. This is to help ensure high survey completion rates.  144 All participants will be asked to download on to their smartphone or personal computer a secure 145 messaging web app called Babelnet (https://www.babelnet.com/en/). Babelnet is free to download and 146 use, and study personnel will assist participants in the download and use of the app. Participants will be 147 assigned a userID that will be similar to their study ID and a password that will be saved in a secure, 148 password protected file only accessible to study personnel. In the event a participant has forgotten or 149 lost their Babelnet login information, they may contact study personnel to retrieve it and log in securely. 150 Messages sent through Babelnet are heavily encrypted by the app. However, study personnel will record 151 (via screenshot or copy-and-paste) the text conversations to facilitate later communication and for 152 intervention supervisory, as well as fidelity, purposes. These recordings will be saved on a secure server 153 in a password protected shared drive that is accessible only to study personnel.  154 Three months post-baseline, participants will be asked to remotely complete a web-based follow-up 155 self-report assessment battery. The follow-up will assess the impact of the interventions on attitudes 156 and behaviors toward alcohol use, as well as patterns of alcohol-related problems and drinking levels, 157 and will last approximately 30 minutes. Upon completion, participants will be thanked for their 158 participation, debriefed, and awarded 1 credit hour through the SONA System, or paid $20 for their 159 participation. Participants may earn a total of $65 for their participation across all study assessements 160 (baseline, boosters, post-intervention survey, and 3-month follow-up). 161 After the 3-month assessment, participants will be given the option to complete any of the intervention 162 sessions that they did not complete as a part of the study or to complete a session for a second time. 163 Interventions 164 Mobile-based Brief Motivational Interview (mBMI). Following the baseline assessment, participants will 165 complete a mobile text-message-based BMI. This session will last approximately 60 minutes. 166 Personalized feedback will be provided with information on how the participant’s drinking compares to 167 that of other students, along with information on risk factors such as engaging in heavy drinking and 168 their use of protective behavioral strategies. The goals of this session are to raise concern about 169 potential consequences of heavy drinking, correct faulty normative perceptions of drinking, and assist 170 students in strategizing means for avoiding future consequences of drinking. The clinician will also 171 discuss and provide advice on avoiding driving after drinking if the participant endorses alcohol-impaired 172 driving. Participants will be instructed to view the personalized feedback document and respond to a 173 number of closed-ended questions embedded in the feedback document as a fidelity check. After 174 confirming receipt and processing of the document, the clinician will send participants text messages 175 containing the following open-ended questions:  176 
Revised 6-2016  7	1. What are some things you like about drinking? And what are some things you don’t like as 177 much? 178 2. What do you make of your percentile rank compared to other college students? 179 3. You also endorsed some consequences you’ve experienced because of drinking.  180 a.

Provide any suggestions if they are open to it 200 7. I want to thank you for talking with me today, and just to summarize everything: 201 a. Motivation/goal 202 b. Plan 203 c. Self-efficacy 204 Mobile-Based Substance-Free Activity Session (mobile SFAS). Following the mBMI, participants will 205 schedule a time within the same week to participate in a mobile-based SFAS. This session will last 206 approximately 20 minutes. Personalized feedback and other information, including self-reported past 207 week time allocation and the association between class attendance, GPA, and income, will be sent in a 208 secure link or as an attachment. The same clinician who conducted the mobile BMI will also conduct the 209 mobile SFAS,. Similar to the structure of the mBMI session, the clinician will have a text exchange with 210 the participant containing the following open-ended questions: 211 1. What are your goals for college?  Tell more about why these goals are important to you? What 212 would be the benefits of accomplishing them? 213 2. What do you hope to do after you graduate? Tell me more about why this would be a good fit 214 for you?  What do you need to be doing right now and over the next year or so to achieve this 215 outcome?   216 3. How does your alcohol use fit in with your ability to accomplish your goals? 217 4. People rarely think about how they spend their time, even though it is a valuable resource and 218 says a lot about your priorities and goals.  219 a. Looking at how you allocate your time (referencing feedback on time allocation), how 220 does your time allocation map onto your goals we discussed? 221 b. Are there certain activities that you would like to devote more time to? Why? 222 
Revised 6-2016  8	5. We asked you about some activities that don’t involve drinking and that you said you enjoyed. 223 Which of these activities/hobbies do you enjoy most?

What steps would you take to get back on track? 233 7. Take a moment to consider a positive experience you are looking forward to in the next couple 234 of months that is consistent with or related to your goals we discussed. Then, briefly (in 3 or 4 235 sentences) describe what it would be like to actually have this positive experience, noting in 236 particular how you will feel and what you will be thinking. 237 8. I want to thank you for talking with me again today, and just to summarize: 238 a. Goals 239 b. Plan 240 c. Self-efficacy 241 For the following four weeks after the mobile SFAS, the clinician will initiate four brief text exchanges 242 (once per week) with the participant about their goal progress and any changes in weekly time 243 allocation, as well as connecting them with activities for the upcoming week that are consistent with 244 their interests and goals. Each brief text exchange will also include a brief reminder of the positive future 245 experience that is goal-consistent described by the participant. Four weeks after the mSFAS, the 246 participant will complete a post-intervention assessment survey and will be reminded of their 3-month 247 follow-up appointment 248 Mobile Alcohol Education*. Following the baseline assessment, participants will complete a mobile text-249 message-based alcohol education session. This session will last approximately 60 minutes (in terms of 250 direct contact). Participants will be provided with information on what is a standard drink of alcohol and 251 other alcohol-related term definitions, how alcohol is metabolized and how it effects the body, what 252 blood alcohol content (BAC) is, how to identify alcohol poisoning, alcohol tolerance, and the biphasic 253 effect. The interventionist will check-in with the participant throughout for any questions or comments. 254 The alcohol education materials were developed, in part, from brochures and fact sheets provided by 255 NIAAA: (https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets). 256 Mobile Nutrition Education*. Following the mobile Alcohol Education session, participants will schedule 257 a time within the same week to participate in a mobile-based nutrition education session. This session 258 will last approximately 60 minutes. Participants will be provided with information on the different food 259 groups (e.g., fruits, grains, proteins) and the types of foods in each food group (e.g., apples, bread, 260 chicken), key recommendations on foods/nutrients to increase (e.g., whole fruits/vegetables, whole 261 grains, fish/seafood) and food/food components to decrease (e.g., sodium, trans/saturated fats, sugar), 262 and how to build a healthy eating pattern. Although problematic alcohol use has been shown to be 263 associated with poor nutrition and eating habits, providing nutrition information has not been shown to 264 significantly affect change in drinking behaviors. Nutrition education materials were developed from the 265 
Revised 6-2016  9	United States Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service (http://www.fns.usda.gov/get-266 involved/provide-nutrition-education). 267 * The Mobile-ANE (mobile Alcohol and Nutrition Education) will be delivered in an instructional manner. 268 Data Analyses. 269 The primary study analyses will examine whether or not there is a statistically significant difference 270 between treatment groups in change in a number of self-reported indicators of alcohol use severity. 271 Repeated measures mixed modeling analyses will be conducted to compare the mobile-based BMI 272 group and the mobile Alcohol and Nutrition Education group on each of the primary outcome variables 273 at 3-month follow up. Mixed modeling examines data similarly to repeated measures ANOVA; however, 274 mixed modeling provides increased flexibility in handling missing data by utilizing all available data for 275 each participant and provides ease of adaptation for multiple research designs (Hox, 2010; West, Welch, 276 and Galecki, 2007). For each model tested, one of the primary outcome variables will serve as the 277 dependent variable with gender, age, and ethnicity likely included as covariates. 278 Measures (Please see attached documents detailing measures for inclusion.) 279 Demographics. These questions will ask about participant gender, age, ethnicity, fraternity or sorority 280 affiliation, year in school, place of residence, and income/finance. Each of these demographic variables 281 have been shown to be associated with driving after drinking and will be used as covariates in statistical 282 models.  283 Motivation to change. The Readiness Ladder (Biener & Abrams, 1991) will be used to assess motivation 284 to change drinking immediately post intervention (i.e., after both the In-person and Text-based 285 interventions) to evaluate how motivation changes as a function of condition. This single item measure 286 has been found to be sensitive to changes in motivation in other brief alcohol intervention studies 287 (Murphy et al., 2010). 288 Discrepancy Rating Form (Neal & Carey, 2004). The Discrepancy Rating form is a 5-item self-report 289 measure that assesses the extent to which the individual believes alcohol is helping or interfering with 290 various aspects of their life, including relationships with friends and family, school work, health, and 291 appearance.  292 Daily Drinking Questionnaire (DDQ; Collins, Parks, & Marlatt, 1985). Students will be asked to estimate 293 the total number of standard drinks they consumed on each day during a typical week in the past 294 month. The DDQ is frequently used to assess alcohol consumption patterns among college students and 295 is correlated with self-monitoring and retrospective drinking measures (Kivlahan, Marlatt, Fromme, 296 Coppel, & Williams, 1990). A separate item will be included to assess binge drinking. Students were 297 asked to report how many times they had drunk 4 or more (if female) or 5 or more (if male) standard 298 drinks in one occasion during the past month (Wechsler et al., 1995). This measure will be used as a 299 secondary intervention outcome variable. 300 Brief Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire (B-YAACQ; Kahler, Strong, & Read, 2005). The 301 BYAACQ is a 24-item self-report measure that assesses whether or not participants have experienced 302 items on a list of potential alcohol-related problems. Participants indicate whether or not they have 303 
Revised 6-2016  10	experienced each alcohol-related problem by circling yes or no for each item. The items are then 304 summed for a total score. The BYAACQ has demonstrated high internal consistency with college 305 students (Kahler et al., 2005) as well as good reliability and validity (Kahler et al., 2008). This measure 306 will be used as a secondary intervention outcome variable. 307 Norms. Participants will be asked to estimate the percentage of drinkers that report past 3-month 308 alcohol-impaired driving. This data will be used to compare normative estimates to actual data on 309 percentage of drinkers report AI driving in the personalized feedback condition. 310 Drug Use Questionnaire. This measure is used to assess the frequency of past month illicit and 311 prescription drug use. This measure will be used as a secondary intervention outcome variable. 312 Income Questions. Participants will be asked questions pertaining to 1) parent’s annual household 313 income; 2) personal monthly income; 3) disposable income; 4) amount spent during the past month; 5) 314 Amount spent on alcohol during the past month; and 6) amount spent on drugs during the past month.  315 Time Allocation. The time allocation measure asks a number of questions about typical activities and 316 asks the respondent to record how many hours they typically spend engaged in each activity. We will 317 collect information on time spent in 16 different activity categories common to college students and 318 pertinent to the goals of the intervention (e.g., drinking/using drugs, studying, extracurricular activities, 319 class, community activities, exercise/sports; Murphy et al., 2006). Consistent with procedures from our 320 previous trials, in order to minimize recall burden, activity data will only be collected for the week 321 preceding the assessment. To enhance recall for specific activities, participants will be asked to bring 322 their day planner or smart-phone to the assessment and are provided with weather reports and news 323 events from each day during the past month. We will evaluate whether or not the SFAS resulted in 324 decreased time using alcohol or drugs, and increased time spent in substance-free activity categories, 325 and whether change in time use mediated any main effects on drinking and alcohol problems. The M-326 TLFB assessment will be used to provide personalized drinking feedback in the BMI, and feedback on 327 time allocation to substance use and to several categories of substance-free activities (e.g., 328 studying/academics, campus/community activities, volunteering, exercise) in the SFAS. This measure is 329 used to help create the feedback, which provides a visual overview of a person’s typical time allocation.  330 Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The DASS-21 is a self-report instrument that consists of 331 three, 7-item subscales: stress, anxiety, and depression. Participants indicate on a 4-point scale how 332 much each item has applied to them over the past week. Sample items include, “I found it hard to wind 333 down,” “I was aware of dryness in my mouth,” and “I couldn’t seem to experience any positive feeling at 334 all.” This measure will be used as an exploratory moderator. Previous research evaluating the SFAS 335 demonstrated that depression is an important moderator of treatment outcome (Murphy et al., 2012); 336 therefore, for the sake of relevance and brevity, the current study will only include the depression 337 subscale. 338 Delayed Discounting (DD). We will measure DD using a modified version of the Monetary Choice 339 Questionnaire (MCQ; Kirby et al., 1999). The modified MCQ is an 8-item measure of delayed reward 340 discounting with choices between two hypothetical amounts of money. Delay discounting will be 341 calculated using the approach described by Kirby et al. Hypothetical money choices provide a reliable 342 and valid estimate of discounting rates. This measure will be used as an exploratory moderator. 343 
Revised 6-2016  11	Alcohol Purchase Task (APT; Murphy et al., 2006) measure of alcohol reinforcing efficacy. The APT is a 344 simulation measure that assesses self-reported alcohol consumption and financial expenditure across a 345 range of drink prices. Participants report the number of standard drinking they would consume in a 346 hypothetical drinking scenario across 17 price increments ranging from zero (free) to $20 per drink. 347 Demand curves are estimated by fitting each participant’s reported consumption across the range of 348 prices to Hursh and Silberburg’s demand curve equation: ln Q = ln Q0 + k (e-αQ0C -1), where Q is 349 demand, Q0 is the level of demand that occurs when cost, C, approaches zero, k specifies the range of 350 Q, and α is a measure of demand curve elasticity. Several reinforcing efficacy (RE) measures are 351 generated from the demand curve: 1) intensity of demand (alcohol consumption at the lowest price), 2) 352 Omax (maximum financial expenditure on alcohol); and 3) elasticity of demand (sensitivity of alcohol 353 consumption to increases in cost). These RE indices are reliable, correlated with alcohol consumption 354 and problems, predictive of treatment response, and function as dynamic markers of intervention 355 response. This measure will be used as an exploratory moderator. 356 Consideration of Future Consequences Scale (CFCS; Strathman et al., 1994). The CFCS is a measure of 357 the extent to which an individual values immediate versus future rewards. The CFC consists of 12 358 statements weighing the present and the future; specifically, identifying whether or not the respondent 359 is more concerned with immediate outcomes as opposed to future outcomes. Participants will report 360 how much each statement represents them on a scale from 1 to 5 (1=extremely uncharacteristic to 5= 361 extremely characteristic). Several of the items are reverse coded to protect against random response. 362 The items are added up, with higher scores indicating greater consideration of future consequences.  363 Reward Probability Index (RPI). The RPI is a self-report measure of an individual’s access to reward and 364 ability to experience reward. It is a 20-item measure that consists of two subscales: Reward Probability 365 and Environmental Suppressors. Scores on the RPI reflect overall reward experience with higher scores 366 indicating a higher degree of experienced reward and lower scores indicating relative reward 367 deprivation. Environmental suppressors are obstacles in experiencing or engaging in rewarding activities 368 or opportunities. The 20 statements in the RPI are rated on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 369 (strongly agree). Because behavioral economic theory proposes that it is the reward experienced from 370 alternative, substance-free activities, and not necessarily the capacity for or ability to experience reward 371 itself that influences level of substance use, the current study will only use the environmental 372 suppressors subscale.  373 Protective Behavioral Strategies Scale (PBSS). The PBSS is a 19-item measure that assesses the frequency 374 of engagement in protective or cognitive behavioral strategies specific to reducing alcohol consumption 375 or to drinking in a manner that reduces negative consequences. Respondents mark the frequency in 376 which they engage in each protective strategy on a scale from 0 to 5 (0=Never; 5=Always). The PBSS will 377 be incorporated in the feedback for the mBMI condition. 378 Short Self-Regulation Questionnaire (SSRQ). Behavior regulation and impulsivity will be measured using 379 the SSRQ-31. This measure consists of 31 statements related to self-regulation, such as “I feel bad when 380 I don’t meet my goals” and “I enjoy a routine and like things to stay the same”. These are scored 381 between 1 and 5 (1= strongly disagree and 5= strongly agree) and are added up to create a total self-382 regulation score. The SSRQ does not have any subscales; factor analysis showed that all items load 383 heavily onto one factor (Carey, Neal, & Collins, 2004). 384 Other academic and student engagement measures. Participants will report any school or community 385 activities that they have been involved with in the past or would like to participate in during college 386 
Revised 6-2016  12	(Kuh, 2001). They will also indicate from a list of 26 activities those which they would have liked to 387 engage in more in the past month. This information will be used to prepare a personalized list of campus 388 activities that are consistent with the student’s interests and at follow-up to evaluate whether or not the 389 SFAS resulted in increased participation in extracurricular activities relative to the control conditions. We 390 will also obtain registrar reports of student GPAs. 391  392 Session Ratings. Participants will rate the intervention and booster sessions on various scales, including 393 usefulness, interest, relevance and effectiveness, and will provide free-response feedback on the 394 sessions. The session ratings survey is 15 items and is a mix of 10-point scale items and free-response 395 text items.  396  397  398 4.	Secondary	Analysis	of	Existing	Data (See Initial Review Guidelines Section 4) 399  400 N/A 401  402 5.	Investigator(s)	Qualifications	(See Initial Review Guidelines Section 5) 403 Dr. Murphy has published extensively on college student substance use and associated risk factors (e.g., 404 Murphy, Dennhardt, Skidmore, Martens, & McDevitt-Murphy, 2010; Skidmore & Murphy, 2011; 405 Murphy, et al., 2012; Murphy, Barnett, & Correia, 2012; Murphy, et al., 2013).  Further, he currently 406 holds an R01 NIAAA-funded grant (R01AA020829) examining the efficacy of a brief motivational 407 interview intervention targeting college student substance use. Recruitment for that study is largely 408 through the University of Memphis Sona System. Dr. Murphy also served as a co-investigator on a study 409 approved throught the IRB (081511-818) which examined similar constructs to the proposal submitted 410 here.   411 Kathryn Soltis, M.S., has also published on college student substance misuse and related 412 variables (Soltis, McDevitt-Murphy, & Murphy, 2017; Acuff, Soltis, Dennhardt, Borsari, & Murphy, 2017; 413 Voss, Soltis, Dennhardt, Martens, & Murphy, 2018; Soltis et al., 2018; Acuff, Soltis, Dennhardt, Berlin, & 414 Murphy, 2018; Teeters, Soltis, & Murphy, in press). Ms. Soltis worked on Dr. Murphy’s R01 described 415 above as both a research assistant and clinical interventionist and, therefore, has substantial experience 416 with young adult and college student heavy drinkers. Further, Ms. Soltis was recently awarded an F31 417 NIAAA training grant to help her conduct the currently proposed study, which will be used to complete 418 her dissertation for the clinical psychology doctoral program at the University of Memphis. 419  420 Andrew Voss and Cecilia Olin have also had experience in working with college student young adults 421 related to substance misuse, and have published on this topic in peer-reviewed journals (Voss, Soltis, 422 Dennhardt, Martens, & Murphy, 2018; Acuff, Voss, Dennhardt, Borsari, Martens, & Murphy, in press; 423 Montes, Olin, Teachman, Baldwin, & Lindgren, 2018; Ramirez, Olin, & Lindgren, 2017). Mr. Voss and Ms. 424 Olin have been trained by Dr. Murphy and Ms. Soltis as clinical interventionists and have demonstrated 425 foundational competency in motivational interviewing and effectively delivering the text-message 426 interventions outlined above. 427  428 6.	Human	Subjects (See Initial Review Guidelines Section 6)		429 a. Characteristics. Participants will be U of M students, ages 18-25.  Participants will be of varied age, 430 ethnicity, and gender.    431  432 
Revised 6-2016  13	b. Vulnerable Populations. Participants will be U of M students, ages 18-25.     433  434 c. Pre-existing relationship to subject pool. To our knowledge there is no pre-existing relationship 435 between the researcher and the subject pool.  436  437 d. Subject Selection. Participants will be U of M students, ages 18-25. To obtain a broadly representative 438 sample, participants will be of varied age, ethnicity, and gender.  439  440 e. Anticipated Number of Subjects. We anticipate recruiting 1000 participants for stage 1, and 100 441 participants for stage 2. Based on prior SONA System screening data on alcohol use among University of 442 Memphis undergraduate students, we anticipate that recruitment in this range is feasible.  443  444 7.	Recruitment (See Initial Review Guidelines Section 7) 445 Participants will be first, second, and third year undergraduate students recruited from the University of 446 Memphis and other local colleges/universities via the psychology department SONA system, classroom 447 screeners, campus wide emails, and flyers. Students will be invited to complete a brief screener 448 (N=1000) that includes demographic questions and questions on past-month heavy drinking.  They will 449 receive course credit in exchange for completing the screening survey. 450  Eligibility Criteria 451 • Inclusion Criteria 452 o Age 18-25 453 o Ability to speak, read, and write in English 454 o 2 or more heavy drinking episodes (5+/4+ drinks in one sitting for 455 males/females) in the past month 456 o Full time students  457 o Employed < 30 hours per week 458 o Reports access to a cell phone/smartphone and willingness to read study 459 materials and exchange texts post-intervention with study personnel  460 o Reports a valid email address 461 • Exclusion Criteria 462 o Currently in treatment for substance use or abuse 463  464 We are restricting our sample to students who are not employed full time because the SFAS focuses on 465 increasing engagement in campus and community activities, and those students who are employed full 466 time may not have time to do that.  Similarly, we are restricting our sample to college students age 18 to 467 25 because they are most likely to benefit from the focus on increasing engagement in constructive 468 aspects of the campus and community, and we want to focus our intervention efforts on this high risk 469 young adult population. 470  471 8.	Subject	Payment (See Initial Review Guidelines Section 8) 472 For completing the baseline assessment and brief 3-item survey immediately following the mobile SFAS 473 or mobile Nutrition Education assessment, participants will be awarded either 1 hour of credit through 474 the SONA System, or paid $25 for their participation. 475 For completing the 3-month follow-up, participants will be awarded 1 credit hour through the SONA 476 System, or paid $20 for their participation. 477 
Revised 6-2016  14	 478 Participants may earn $10, or 0.5 SONA credit, for completing at least 3 booster contact surveys. 479  480 Participants may earn $10, or 0.5 SONA credit,  for completing the post-intervention assessment survey.  481  482 Participants have the opportunity to earn up to $65 total, or 3 SONA credits, for their participation. 483  484 9.	Potential	Risks	(See Initial Review Guidelines Section 9) 485 The risks in this study include subject discomfort (e.g., psychological discomfort due to discussing 486 personal and/or sensitive information related to participant substance use or substance-related 487 problems) and risk of breach of confidentiality.  The likelihood of experiencing subjective discomfort 488 from completing the present assessment batteries is low. The questions used in this study are standard 489 research instruments that have been used without observed discomfort in numerous studies with 490 similar populations.  Some participants may find the personalized feedback or alcohol education about 491 the risks associated with drinking uncomfortable. The risk of breach of confidentiality is also judged to 492 be low based on the safeguarding procedures in place, including removing identifiers from data, storing 493 identifiers and data in separate locked file cabinets, password-protecting all data files, and limiting 494 access to project data to project personnel.  Only the study administrator and study research assistants 495 will have access to any identifying information. Any identifying information will be destroyed after 496 completion of last follow-up or if the participant does not complete the last follow up, within six-months 497 of study enrollment. We will encourage participants to password protect their cell phones or personal 498 computers to ensure confidentiality of the text information and links sent. Babelnet, the encrypted 499 messaging app described above, will provide an extra layer of security as it requires a separate password 500 and heavily encrypts all sent messages. Participants’ userIDs for Babelnet will not include any identifiers 501 and will be similar to their study ID number. This is due to preset userID requirements on Babelnet.  502  503 Planned procedures for protecting against risk.   For the possibility of subjective discomfort from 504 answering questions, any distress will be minimized by assurances that participants can refuse to 505 answer any particular question that they do not feel comfortable addressing and may withdraw at any 506 time without penalty.  Participants will also be advised to talk to a research assistant following the 507 assessment batteries should any psychological distress persist, and referrals will be provided 508 accordingly. The risk of breach of confidentiality will be handled by numerically coding all data, by 509 separating all identifying information from study data, and by ensuring that all data is collected via 510 secure web server. No participant names or identifying information will be used in presenting data in 511 lectures, presentations, or publications.  All feedback and text messages will be framed in a manner 512 that is as objective and nonjudgmental as possible, consistent with MI theory and the empirical 513 literature on effective brief intervention approaches.  514  515 Plans for ensuring necessary professional intervention in the event of an adverse event.  All 516 participants will receive information about free hotlines, websites, and campus and Memphis area 517 options for receiving alcohol-related information and treatment.  Participants who express concern 518 about their substance use will be provided with referrals to appropriate university and community 519 resources for addressing these issues.  If any participant reports suicidal ideation, the study 520 administrator (who will all be graduate-level students) will immediately notify Dr. Murphy, who is a 521 licensed clinical psychologist.  The study administrator will immediately attempt to reach the 522 participant via phone and Dr. Murphy will subsequently conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment.  If 523 necessary, Dr. Murphy will arrange for the participant to be transported to an emergency room or the 524 
Revised 6-2016  15	Psychological Services Center for further crisis intervention services.   All participants will be informed 525 that they can contact Dr. Murphy if they would like more information on obtaining substance abuse 526 services. Dr. Murphy has over 15 years of clinical and research experience with college student 527 substance abusers and is well prepared to address any clinical concerns that may arise in the context of 528 this research.   529  530 10.	Potential	Benefits	(See Initial Review Guidelines Section 10) 531 No direct benefits of participation can be guaranteed to participants.  Participants may derive 532 satisfaction from contributing to the success of the research and its scientific contributions.  533 Participants in the randomized trial may benefit from increased knowledge about methods for reducing 534 alcohol or drug use.  There is relatively strong empirical support for the efficacy of brief motivational 535 interventions like the ones we are testing (Larimer et al., 2004/2005).  536 Importance of knowledge to be gained.   College student alcohol abuse is a substantial public health 537 problem that demands attention from researchers. The proposed project will provide a comprehensive 538 test of a promising method for improving the efficacy of brief alcohol interventions.  This study will also 539 be the largest prospective analysis on the role of behavioral economic variables in the progression of 540 young adult drinking.  The finding will assist clinicians in predicting poor treatment response and 541 increasing patterns of drinking over time as well as increase the effectiveness of substance abuse 542 interventions in general and basic knowledge of how risky drinking patterns develop and remit in 543 young adulthood. 544  545 11.	Assessment (See Initial Review Guidelines Section 11) 546 Given the minimal risks to participants, the procedures we have in place to protect against those risks, 547 their effectiveness for doing so in past research, and the anticipated benefits of the study, we judge the 548 risk-benefit ratio to be acceptable for this research.  The results of this study will provide important 549 information on the risk factors and needed intervention/prevention efforts among young adults 550 engaging in risky drinking behavior.  551  552 12.	Privacy	(See Initial Review Guidelines Section 12) 553 For study recruitment, participants identified through online screening will be contacted if they meet 554 eligibility criteria. Identifying information of enrolled participants will be kept confidential, no identifying 555 information will be shared with unauthorized personnel. Identifying information of screened 556 participants who do not enroll in the study will be shredded and not retained. In response to study 557 flyers, interested participants from the community will contact the study team and be screened over the 558 phone. If participant meets eligibility criteria and are willing to participate, they will enroll in the study. 559 Identifying information of enrolled participants will be kept confidential, no identifying information will 560 be shared with unauthorized individuals. Identifying information of screened participants who do not 561 enroll in the study will be shredded and not retained. Participants’ data will be assigned a study 562 identification number, which will be used to identify all study records. Participants’ names will not be 563 associated with any subsequent publication or representation of the data. Risk of disclosure of sensitive 564 information will be minimized by removing personal identifying information from the files, and by using 565 the data only to develop statistical tables for group data in which no individual can be identified. All 566 
Revised 6-2016  16	records will be kept in a locked cabinet or on a password-protected computer in a secure and locked 567 room/office. 568  569  All personnel working on the research study will have CITI training and are graduate-level clinical 570 psychology students or faculty members. The study will take place in the HABIT laboratory in the 571 Psychology Building at the University of Memphis. Participants will be asked to complete assessment 572 batteries on three separate occasions and will be informed that they may decline any questions or tasks 573 they wish not to answer or complete. 574  575 13.	Confidentiality	(See Initial Review Guidelines Section 13) 576 Participants’ data will be assigned a number, which will be used to identify all study records. 577 Participants’ names will not be associated with any subsequent publication or representation of the 578 data. Risk of disclosure of sensitive information will be minimized by removing personal identifying 579 information from the files, and by using the data only to develop statistical tables for group data in 580 which no individual can be identified. The web-based surveys used in the present study are password 581 protected and do not ask for or record any identifying information.  All data collected from these 582 surveys are identified by ID numbers rather than names.   583 All data will be received stripped of personal identifiers. Measures will be identified with a study ID 584 number not based on a personal identifier. A cross-index of names and ID numbers will be stored in a 585 separate locked location from all data and destroyed at the completion of the study.  Additional 586 precautions include: (1) data will be entered in coded form, (2) data will be stored in computer files 587 protected from unauthorized access by passwords, (3) information that might potentially allow an 588 individual participant to be identified will not be allowed in any publications or reports sent to 589 individuals outside the study, and (4) all employees who are to handle data will be trained in 590 confidentiality policies and procedures.  Raw data that is stripped of any identifiers will be retained and 591 made available to NIH per their data sharing policies. 592 As mentioned above, all text exchanges will take place through the encrypted messaging app, Babelnet. 593 Babelnet IDs will not include identifying information and will be linked to data by study ID numbers. 594 Messages sent through Babelnet are heavily encrypted by the app. Study personnel will record (via 595 screenshot or copy-and-paste) the text conversations to facilitate later communication and for 596 supervisory and intervention fidelity purposes. These recordings will be saved on a secure server in a 597 password protected shared drive that is accessible only to study personnel. 598 We will also apply for a National Institutes of Health Certificate of Confidentiality, which protects the 599 investigators on this study from being forced to tell people that are not connected with this study about 600 participants’ participation in the study, even under a subpoena. 601 The limits to confidentiality are outlined in the informed consent agreement and will be described by 602 the research assistant during the consent process. Specifically, the consent forms state: 603 By law, there are a few limits to confidentiality. These limits were developed in 604 part to insure the safety of research participants. The researchers are required 605 by law to take some action if there is suspicion that you may harm yourself or 606 somebody else or there is suspicion that a child may be in danger. If any of these 607 situations should occur, we would attempt to contact you prior to taking any 608 action609

Purpose of the Project  You are being asked to take part in a University of Memphis research project.  This project will entail completing questions related to health and lifestyle behaviors including alcohol use.  The overall goal of the project is to evaluate the effectiveness of text-message based healthy lifestyle intervention.   2. Explanation of Procedures  We are asking you to complete questions related to health and lifestyle behaviors including alcohol use and driving behavior. We will retain the contact information you provide and may contact you at a later time. This is part of a research study being conducted at the University of Memphis HABIT lab. Some participants will be contacted and invited to participate in an additional paid phase of this research which would entail completing two surveys, receiving information about alcohol and about college/life goals, and having a discussion with a research assistant via instant messaging/text messaging. We are asking you about some activities (e.g., alcohol use) that are sensitive and in some cases illegal. However, we have obtained a federal Certificate of Confidentiality that ensures that any information you report will be kept confidential and not released to anyone.  3. Risks or Discomforts  
Revised 6-2016  Page 20 of 50   The risk to you in this study would be due to loss of confidentiality due to the sensitive information you provide to us.  However, we will make every effort to ensure your privacy and protect the information that you give us. 4. Benefits  There are no clear benefits to participating in this study.  You may find it helpful to report on your health-related behaviors.  5. Confidentiality  If you decide to take part in this research study, as part of the research, you will be asked to give us information about various health behaviors. We have obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC) from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The CoC has been issued to protect the investigators on this study from being forced to tell people that are not connected with this study about your participation in this study, even under a subpoena. The protection offered by the CoC does not stop us from voluntarily reporting information about suspected or known sexual, physical, or other abuse of a child or older person, threats of violence to self or others, or threats to destroy property. If any member of the research team is given such information, he or she will make a report to the appropriate authorities. Even when a CoC is in place, you and your family members must still continue to actively protect your own privacy. If you voluntarily give your written consent for an insurer, employer, or lawyer to receive information about your participation in the research, then we may not use the CoC to withhold this information.  The research record will include documents that contain private information about your health and other behaviors. All data will be obtained specifically only for research purposes. All data will be kept confidential and not directly linked to any individual participant. Contact and identifying information will be collected for booster and follow-up purposes, but will be kept separate from the actual data. This information will be destroyed after completion of last follow-up or if the participant does not complete the last follow up, within six-months of study enrollment. All self-report data will be collected on-line with every effort made to have participants complete all measures on secure web servers. 6. Decision to participate and right to quit at any time  Participation is voluntary and you may quit at any time.  A decision to quit the study will not affect your education at your current university in any way. You also may skip or not answer any question(s) you do not want to answer.   Questions about the study should be directed to the Principal Investigator, Dr. Murphy, at (901) 678-2630. For questions regarding your rights as a research participant contact the IRB Administrator at 678-2705. It is important for you to understand that the University of Memphis 
Revised 6-2016  Page 21 of 50  does not have funds set aside to pay for the cost of any care or treatment that might be necessary because you get hurt or sick while taking part in this study. Also, the University of Memphis will not pay for any wages you may lose if you are harmed by this study. CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE I HAVE READ THE CONSENT FORM AND FULLY UNDERSTAND IT.

Purpose of the Project  You are being asked to take part in a University of Memphis research project.  The project is designed to evaluate the effects of two different sets of text-message based information messages intended to help you maintain a healthy lifestyle.   2. Explanation of Procedures  You will be asked to complete several questionnaires related to your alcohol use and things that happen when you drink and your attitudes regarding drinking and other activities. We are asking you about some activities that are sensitive and in some cases illegal. However, we have obtained a federal Certificate of Confidentiality that ensures that any information you report will be kept confidential and not released to anyone (limits of confidentiality are discussed below).  Completing the questionnaires should take approximately 30 minutes. Then, you will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: a mobile-based brief intervention or mobile-based alcohol and nutrition education. Using the mobile app Babelnet, participants will remotely complete the mobile-based brief intervention or alcohol education with a trained clinician immediately following the initial assessment.   Participants will complete a second session within the same week after the initial session, followed by a brief feedback survey of the initial 2 sessions. Participants will then complete booster text message sessions (~20 minutes each) that will take place once a week for 4 weeks after the second session. Following the boosters, participants will complete a brief post-intervention survey. Three months after the post-intervention survey, participants will complete a web-based follow-up self-report assessment battery. The assessment session will last approximately 30 minutes.   For completing the first two sessions, participants will be awarded either 1 hour of credit for participation, which the researcher will grant through the SONA System, or $25. Participants will be awarded $10, or 0.5 SONA credit, for completing at least 3 boosters and $10, or 0.5 SONA credit, for completing the post-intervention assessment survey. Finally, upon completion of the 3-month follow-up assessment, participants will be thanked for their participation, debriefed, and awarded 1 credit hour through the SONA System, or paid $20 for their participation. This adds up to a total of $65, or 3 SONA credits, possible. After your 3-month follow-up assessment, you will 
Revised 6-2016  Page 23 of 50  be given the option to complete any of the intervention sessions that you did not complete as a part of the study or to complete a session for a second time.  In order for this project to have scientific value, we need to know whether our intervention was helpful. Therefore, we will make every effort to contact participants for these follow-up interviews. As part of your participation in this project, we will ask your permission to contact another person who knows you well enough to know how to contact you over the next 4-6 months. We will not inform any individual about the nature of the research study or speak with them about any of the confidential material you have given us as a part of the study.  Transcriptions will be made of the mobile-based text-message sessions for supervisory purposes, so that we can check to make sure the project procedures are being implemented as planned. In addition, we plan to study parts of the interventions that are related to changes in alcohol use. This information will help us further improve future interventions for college students. These transcriptions will be identified only by an identification number and will be stored separately from all other information. Any personal information provided during the session (e.g., names of friends, classes attended) will be purged from transcripts made of the sessions. In addition, any information on the transcriptions is protected by the Certificate of Confidentiality obtained for this study (see section 6). These transcripts will be destroyed following their use in this study.   3. Risks or Discomforts   The risk to you in this study would be due to loss of confidentiality due to the nature of the sensitive information you provide to us through email and text messages.  Though we will not be able to encrypt text messages, all messages will be sent from a secure mobile phone. The phones and email addresses we use will be password protected and kept in a secure locked room accessible only to research staff.  We will make every effort to ensure your privacy and protect the information that you give us. Additionally, you may experience some emotional discomfort in receiving information about your experiences with drinking. 4. Benefits We cannot guarantee that you will receive any benefits from this study. A possible benefit is that you may learn more about your alcohol use and your activity patterns.    5. Alternative Sources of Alcohol Information.   If you choose not to participate in this study, we can provide you with information on other resources on alcohol and drug use.   6. Confidentiality   If you decide to take part in this research study, as part of the research, you will be asked to give us information about various health behaviors. We have obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC) from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The CoC has been issued to protect the investigators on this study from being forced to tell people that are not connected with this study about your participation in this study, even under a subpoena. The protection offered by the CoC does not stop us from voluntarily reporting information about suspected or known sexual, 
Revised 6-2016  Page 24 of 50  physical, or other abuse of a child or older person, threats of violence to self or others, or threats to destroy property. If any member of the research team is given such information, he or she will make a report to the appropriate authorities.  Even when a CoC is in place, you and your family members must still continue to actively protect your own privacy. If you voluntarily give your written consent for an insurer, employer, or lawyer to receive information about your participation in the research, then we may not use the CoC to withhold this information.  The research record will include documents that contain private information about your health and other behaviors.  All data will be obtained specifically only for research purposes. All data will be kept confidential and not directly linked to any individual participant. Contact and identifying information will be collected for booster and follow-up purposes, but will be kept separate from the actual data. This information will be destroyed after completion of last follow-up or if the participant does not complete the last follow up, within six-months of study enrollment. All self-report data will be collected online with every effort made to have participants complete all measures on a secure web-based server. Raw data that is stripped of any identifiers will be retained and made available to the NIH per their data sharing policies.  Further, participants will be asked to download on to their smartphone or personal computer a secure messaging web app called Babelnet (https://www.babelnet.com/en/). Babelnet is free to download and use, and study personnel will assist participants in the download and use of the app. Participants will be assigned a userID and password. Because Babelnet does not store this information on their servers, study personnel will maintain this userID and password log in a password protected file on a password protected computer in a locked office only accessible to study personnel. Messages sent through Babelnet are heavily encrypted by the app to ensure maximum security and confidentiality. Study personnel will record (via screenshot or copy-and-paste) text-message intervention conversations for supervisory purposes. These records will be destroyed following their use in the study.  By law, there are a few limits to confidentiality. These limits were developed in part to insure the safety of research participants. The researchers are required by law to take some action if there is suspicion that you may harm somebody else or there is suspicion that a child may be in danger. If any of these situations should occur, we would attempt to contact you prior to taking any action.  7. Decision to participate and right to quit at any time   Participation is voluntary and you may quit at any time.  A decision to quit the study will not affect your relationship with the University of Memphis.  You also may skip or not answer any question(s) you do not want to answer.     In certain circumstances (such as being a suicide risk), the study administrator will have the right to terminate your participation in the study. If termination was deemed appropriate, the study administrator would make every effort to contact you directly and provide you with information on mental health resources in the community.

Revised 6-2016  Page 26 of 50  Appendix Telephone Script  Hello, this is (name) from the University of Memphis Psychology Department. I am calling to invite you to participate in an additional component of the research project that you participated in on the SONA system in the last week or so.  Do you have a minute so that I can tell you a bit about this paid research study?    If Yes: Great! First let me ask you a few questions just to make sure you’re eligible CHECK ELIGIBILITY   1. Are you a full time student? (Need to be full time student)  2.  Are you employed?  If so, how many hours a week do you work? (Needs to be < 30 hours)  3. This next question is asking about standard drinks of alcohol. All information collected about you will remain confidential (including what you say over the phone with me right now will not be shared with anyone outside of this research study; We would actually get in trouble if any of your information is shared with anyone outside of this research study).  A standard drink is considered 12 oz of beer, 5 oz of wine, or 1.5 ounces of hard liquor)  In the past month, on how many days did you drink 4/5 (women/men, respectively) standard drinks in one night or occasion? a. 0 days b. 1 day c. 2-3 days d. 4 or more days Needs to be 2 or more binges in past month 4. Do you have access to a smartphone, laptop, or desktop computer? a. No b. Yes Needs to be Yes  Great, looks like you are eligible to participate!  The next phase of this study will entail completing questionnaires and two sessions over the next week that will be either in person or over text message. Completing the questionnaires will take about 30 minutes.    Each of the two sessions that follow will take approximately 1 hour over text message.  The first session will include either an interview related to your lifestyle, your consumption of alcohol, and your perception of others’ alcohol consumption, or a discussion on alcohol and frequently asked questions about alcohol.  The second session will be either a discussion about your college and career goals, or a discussion on nutrition and frequently asked questions about nutrition.  
Revised 6-2016  Page 27 of 50   Following the second session, we’ll ask you to answer just a few questions about your experience with the first two sessions, and we would pay you $25.  If you’re enrolled in a psychology class we can give you up to an hour of extra credit. We’ll then briefly contact you via text-message once a week for 4 weeks as a follow-up to your initial sessions, and you’ll have an opportunity to earn $10, or 0.5 SONA credit, there if you complete at least 3 of these follow-up sessions (boosters). We would then ask you to complete a 15-20-minute survey at the end of those 4 weeks, which you would receive $10, or 0.5 SONA credit, for completing. Finally, we’ll ask you to complete one last survey 4-months from now, which would take about 30 minutes, and we’d pay you $20, or assign 1 credit hour in the SONA system. So total, you can earn up to $65 or 3 SONA credits.   All information collected about you will remain confidential. You are not obligated to participate, and you may choose to withdraw participation at any time.  If you decide to participate in this part the research project, we will schedule a convenient time for you to complete the survey and text-message sessions remotely within the next week.    Are you interested in participating?    Would you like to participate for extra credit or for the money?   Would it be okay for us to call or text you the day before your appointment just to remind you and answer any last minute questions you might have?  Also, feel free to call or text us if you need to reschedule, or are running late!

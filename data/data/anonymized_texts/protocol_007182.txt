Study Phase: III
Research Hypothesis:
•Participants with Programmed death -ligand 1 combi ned positive score (PD-L1 CPS) ≥ 20 who receive nivolumab 
in combination with ipilimumab for first-line treatment of recu rrent or metastatic SCCHN will have longer overall 
survival (OS) than comparable participants who receive the EXTRE ME regimen

metastatic SCCHN will have longer OS than comparable participan ts who receive the EXTREME regimen 
Objectives: 
Primary Objectives:
•To compare the OS of participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥  20 who are r eceiving nivolumab combined with ipilimumab 
to those receiving EXTREME regimen. 
•To compare the OS of all st udy par ticipants receiving nivolumab combi ned with ipilimumab to those  receiving 
EXTREME regimen
Secondary Objectives:

study participants
•To assess the participant’s can cer-related sympt oms and quality  of life using components of the FACT-H&N 
questionnaire in participants w ith PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20 and also in a ll study participants.
Study Design: 
This is a randomized, open-label, Phase 3 trial in participants  ≥18 years old with untreated metastatic or recurrent 
SCCHN that is not amenable to curative therapy, evaluating nivo lumab + ipilimumab versus the EXTREME regimen 
(Cetuximab + cisplatin/carboplatin + fluorouracil) as a first-li ne treatment. 
HPV p-16 status and tumor cell PD-L1 s tatus (expressing or non- expressing/non-evaluable) test results will be needed 
prior to randomization. Participan ts will undergo screening eva luations to determine eligibility prior to randomization. 
The dose and treatment schedules for each arm are as follows:
•Arm A: Nivolumab + Ipilimumab Arm:
−Nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks + Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg IV ever y 6 weeks until progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months from first nivo lumab treatment.
•Arm B: EXTREME regimen Arm: 
−Cetuximab 400 mg/m
2IV for the initial dose only, then 250 mg/m2weekly + cisplatin (100 mg/m2) or 
carboplatin (AUC of 5 mg per milliliter per minute) on Day 1 an d fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 per day for 
4 days) every 3 weeks for maximum of 6 cycles followed by mainte nance cetuximab at 250 mg/m2weekly 
(or every  2 weeks , per local prescribing information) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity; the 
choice of cisplatin or carboplatin is at the discretion of the i nvestigator.

Approximately 930 participants will be randomized to the two trea tment arms in a 1:1 ratio and stratified by the 
following factors: 
•Tumor cell PD-L1 status (expressing [ ≥1%] vs non-expressing [< 1%] or non-evaluable). Up to 10% of 
randomized participants per c ohort can be included into the study as “non-evaluable.” After this point, participants 
with non-evaluable results w ill not be permitted to be ra ndomized; the s ite would need to s ubmit an additional 
tumor tissue for testing with either a result of “expressing” o r “non-expressing” in order to randomize the 
participant. 
•HPV p-16 status (oropharyngeal HPV p-16 positive vs oropharynge al HPV p-16 negative or non-oropharyngeal). 
Oropharyngeal CA sites defined in Appendix 5 .
•Prior chemotherapy (adjuvant/neoadjuvant/multimodal treatment) status (Yes/No)
Tumor progression or response will be assessed by investigator u sing RECIST 1.1 criteria.  Treatment with study 
medication will continue until RECIST 1.1 defined progression, unacceptable toxicity, a maximum of 24 months since 
the first dose of nivolumab, or withdrawal of consent. 
In addition to investigator assessment of response and progression, there will be a blinded independent  central review 
(BICR) of tumor scans and study sites will need to submit tumor scans for central radiology review.
A DMC will be established and meet regularly during the study to  ensure that participant safety is carefully monitored 
and to provide oversight regarding safety and efficacy considerations in protocol CA209651.The maximum duration of the study from start of randomization to final analysis of OS is projecte dt o  b e  
approximately 51 months, assuming 26 months accrual duration. Add itional survival follo w-up may continue for up 
to 5 years from the time of this analysis. The study will end o nce survival follow-up has concluded.

Study Assessments: Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to t he date of death. Participants will 
be assessed for response by CT or MRI beginning 6 weeks ( ±1 week) after first dose and continuing every 6 weeks 
(±7 days) until week 48 and then every 12 weeks ( ±1 week) until progression. Tumor assessments must continue per 
protocol until RECIST 1.1 progression has occurred. Participant s will be followed for survival every 3 months via in 
person or telephone contact after the participant has discontinued study drug tr eatment. All randomized participants 
will be followed for survival.
Statistical Considerations:
Sample Size:
The primary objectives of this study are to compare OS between treatment groups, randomized participants with PD-
L1 CPS ≥ 20 and in all randomized participants. OS will be compared at the 0.025 alpha level for each of the above 
two populations.

The OS comparison in all randomized participants will require u p to 741 deaths. This number of events ensures that 
a two-sided, alpha=0.025 group sequential test using the O’Brien and Fleming spending function and with an interim 
analysis after approx imately 80% of events will have overall 97 % power for a HR of 1.2 for the first 7 months and 
0.55 thereafter. 
The final analysis of OS in all randomized participants is proj ected to occur 51 months after the first patient was 
randomized. An interim analysis in this population will be perf ormed when approximately 593 deaths occur, or all 
randomized participants have been followed up for at least 12 m onths, whichever is later. It is projected for 39 months 
after the first patient was randomized. At the same time as the OS analysis is done for all randomized participants, OS will also be compared between arms 
in the randomized participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20 via a two-sided, alpha=0.025 gr oup sequen tial test procedure 
incorporating the O’Brien and Fleming alpha spending function. The group sequential test would have an interim 
analysis and the final analysis of OS, at which a pproximately 298 and 372 deaths, respectively, are expected. Wi th 
this many events, the test procedure would have an overall 99% power if the HR was 1.06 for the first 7 months and 
0.45 thereafter. See Section 8.1 , Sample Size Determination, for additional details.
Endpoints:Primary Endpoints:
•OS in randomized participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥20 
•OS in all randomized participants
OS is defined as the time between randomization and death. For participants without documentation of death, OS will 
be censored on the last date the participant was known to be alive.
Secondary Endpoints:
OS in randomized participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1. OS is defined the same way as for the primary endpoints.
PFS is defined as the time from randomization to disease progres sion, using RECIST 1.1 criteria, or, if there is no 
documented progression, death. (The date of progression will be  based on the BICR assessment of progression). 
Participants who neither progress nor die will be censored on th e date of their last tumor assessment. Participants who 
receive subsequent anti-cancer therapy pri or to documented progressi on, including tumor-directed radiothe rapy and 
tumor-directed surgery, will ha ve their PFS time censored on th e date of their last tumor assessment prior to subsequent 
therapy.
The Objective Response Rate (O RR) is defined as the number of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of 
complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), divided by the  number randomized in the population.
The BOR is defined as the best response, based on RECIST 1.1 criteria, recorded between randomization and either 
progression or subsequent anticancer therapy (including tumor-di rected radiotherapy and tumor-directed surgery), 
whichever occurs first. (The BOR will be based on BICR assessments). For participants without evidence of RECIST 
1.1 progression or subsequent anticancer therapy, all available  tumor evaluations will contribute to the BOR 
assessment. 
Duration of objective response (DOR) is the time between the first documented response (CR or PR) and progression, 
per RECIST 1.1, or, if no progression is reported, death. The D OR of a participant who neither progresses nor dies 
will be censored as in the primary definition of PFS. DOR is ca lculated on the subset of participants whose best 
response was either CR or PR, according to BICR assessments.
Analyses:
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics:
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment arm as randomized using descriptive 
statistics. These analyses will be done on the PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20 pop ulation and on the all randomized population
Efficacy Analyses:
Efficacy analyses will be performed by treatment group as rando mized.

OS will be compared between arms via a two-sided, overall alpha =0.025, gr oup sequen tial log-rank test for each of 
the two primary endpoints population. The significance levels may be updated through graphical approach where the 
family-wise error rate will be protected in the strong sense. 
The nominal significance levels  for each l ook of the group sequ ential log-rank test will be determined by the alpha 
spending function with the O’Brien and Fleming boundary based on the actual number of events observed at the time 
of the analysis. These tests will be stratified by the stratification factors used in the randomization.
An estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) and a corresponding two si ded 100*(1 - adjusted α)% confidence interval for the 
HR will be generated for each endpoint using a stratified Cox p roportional hazards model with treatment arm as the 
sole covariate. The stratificati on factors will be the same as those used for testing. The level for the confidence interval 
for the OS hazard ratio will be based on the same nominal signi ficance level for the group sequential log-rank test.
Survival distributions will be estimated, by arm, via the Kapla n-Meier (KM) product-limit method. Median survival 
times along with 95% c onfidence intervals for the medians, will also be presented. Th e confidence interval for the 
median will be constructed using a generalization of the Brookm eyer and Crowley method based on a log {-log} 
transformation of the survival function.
Safety Analyses:
The safety analysis will be r estricted to treated participants.  Descriptive statistics of safety will be presented using the 
National Cancer Ins titute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for  Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, by 
treatment arm. Safety analyses will be performed on all treated  participants.
Pharmacokinetic Analyses:
The nivolumab and ipilimumab concentration data obtained in thi s study may be combined with data from other 
studies in the clinical development program to develop or refine a population PK model.
Biomarker Analyses:
Potential relationships between biomarker data and efficacy or safety endpoints may be investigated as part of an 
analysis plan aimed at identifyi ng baseline biomarkers that may  be used to prospectively identify participants likely 
to respond to nivolumab and ipilimumab and to identify participa nts who may be predisposed to having adverse 
reactions to treatment. These exploratory predictive biomarker analyses will be completed with biomarkers measured 
in blood and in tumor samples and w ill focus primarily on SNPs in select genes associated with immu nity, on the 
expression of PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2 proteins in tumor specimen s, and on tumor mutational burden (TMB) and 
gene expression profile (GEP).
Outcomes Research Analyses:
Exploratory analyses of EQ-5D and FACT-H&N (including FHNSI-10)  data will be performed in randomized 
participants who have an assessment at baseline (Day 1, assessm ent prior to administration of drug on day of first 
dose) and at least 1 subsequent assessment while on treatment. Questionnaire completion rate, defined as the 
proportion of questionnaires actually received out of the expected number, will be calculated and summarized at each 
assessment point. Analyses of QOL will be performed on all randomized population.
Interim Analyses:
An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will be responsi ble for monitoring safety and efficacy d ata at 
regular intervals. In addition, the DMC will review the data fo r the formal interim analysis. 
A formal interim analysis for superiority of OS will be perform ed after approximately 593 OS events (out of 
741 required) have occurred on all randomized participants, or a ll randomized participants have been followed up for 
at least 12 months, whichever is later. Both primary endpoints w ill be tested at interim using the group sequential test 
procedure with initial overall alpha=0.025 for each. The overal l alpha will be updated following the graphical
procedure which is d etailed in the SAP. The stopping boundaries f or the interim and final analyses will be determined 
by the O’Brien and Fleming alpha spending function, based on the actual number of events observed. If interim comparison of OS in either all randomized participan ts or randomized participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20 is 
significant, the DM C will inform the sponsor, as described in t he DMC charter. If comparison of OS in the  randomized 
participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20 is significant, OS in randomiz ed participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1 will be

1 INTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE
CA209651 is a randomized, open-label, global Phase 3 trial of n ivolumab (also known as 
BMS-936558) plus ipilimumab  versus EXTREME regimen (cetuximab + cisplatin/carboplatin + 
fluorouracil) as first-line therapy in recurrent or metastatic head and neck squam ous cell carcinoma 
(SCCHN). This study will determin e if nivolumab plus ipilimumab improves overall survival (OS)
over standard of care chemotherapy in all study participants and  biomarker selected patient 
population. Additional objectives include further characterizat ion of the efficacy, adverse event 
profile, pharmacokineti cs, patient-re ported outcomes, and potential predictive biomarkers of 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab in participants with SCCHN.
1.1 Study Rationale
Head and neck cancers are among the most common cancers worldwi de, accounting for more than 
550,000 cas es and around 300,000 deaths each year,1and these trends are increasing. In the United 
States, ~45,780 new cases of oral cavity and pharynx cancer and  ~8,650 people were expected to
die of this disease in 2015.2About ~90% of all head and neck cancer cancers are squamous cel l 
carcinomas. Most SCCHNs arise from the epithelial lining of the  oral cavity , oropharynx, larynx 
and hypopharynx. The most important risk factors identified in SCCHNs, include tobacco and 
alcohol use, and, in a subgroup of SCCHNs (particularly oropharynx tumors), human papilloma 
as a strong independent  prognostic fact or, with HPV positive-in fected tumors associated with more 
favorable clinical outcomes.3
The treatment approach  and prognosis for patients with SCCHN is mostly determined by the tumor 
stage at presentation. About one-third of patients presents wit h early stage disease, whereas the 
majority present with advanced disease with lymph node metastasis. With standard of care treatment, the 5-year survival for  localized oral ca vity and pharynx cancer is 83%, but survival
drops to 37.7% for metastatic dis ease.
2Approximately half of the treated population returns with 
recurrent or refractory disease, an d for these patients, the 1-year survival r ate ranges from 5% to 
33% with a median overall survival (OS) of 6 to 9 months. Recurre nt disease that is not amenable 
to curative-intent radiation or surgery have the same treatment  approach as metastatic disease, and 
participation in a clinical tria l is a recommended treatment op tion for these patients.4A Phase 3 
randomized trial in first-line recurrent or metastatic (1L R/M) SCCHN showed that cetuximab plus 
platinum-fluorouracil chemotherapy (EXTREME regimen) improved su rvival over 
platinum-fluorouracil alone as first-line treatment with a medi an OS of 10.1 months versus 
7.4 months (Hazard Ratio [ HR] = 0.80, 95% CI 0.64- 0.99, p = 0.04). A s a result, the EXTREME
regimen has been adapted as a standard treatment approach in th is population. While the addition 
of cetuximab to platinum-fluorouracil chemoth erapy improved response rates and disease control 
rates, the duration of response did not differ  significantly between tre atment regimens. Since 
the introducti on of the EXTREME regimen in 2008,4no marked improve ment in survival has been 
achieved, with patients still frequently deve loping recurrences and d istant metastasis. After 
progression, the limited treatment options avai lable are associated with s ubstantial morbidity and 
mortality. Thus, new tr eatment appro aches ne ed to be explored as the fi rst-line treatment in this 
population.5

1.2 Rationale for revised protocol 04:
Emerging data from multiple studies in r ecent years demonstrated long term OS benefit with PD-1 
inhibitor (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) therapy compared to stand ard of care chemotherapy in 
R/M SCCHN population.6’7’8’9These studies while suggesting OS benefit in all study subjects  
also showed a trend towards better efficacy in participants who e xpress Programmed 
death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in either their tumor or immune cells. Howev er, PFS did not capture the 
benefit of PD-1 therapy versus standard of care therapy in both  biomarker selected and unselected 
population.
Benefit of PD-1 inhibitors as a second-line therapy (2L) for R/M  SCCHN population:
In the two year survival update of CheckMate-141 ,6Phase 3 tri al evaluating nivolu mab as a second 
line therapy (2L) in R/M SCCHN, single-agent nivolumab s howed significant OS benefit over 
investigator’s choice chemotherapy (IC) in all stu dy participants (HR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.54 t o 0.86; 
p = 0.01), with a relatively b etter eff icacy noted in participan ts who expressed tumor cell PD-L1
≥ 1% (HR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.39–0.78). In a sub-group analysis of th is study, participants who had 
both tumor cell PD-L1 ≥ 1 % and a high tumor-associated immune cell  PD-L1 (TAIC) expression
demonstrated a relatively better OS benefit (HR = 0.43, 95% CI 0. 28, 0.67). However, significant 
PFS benefit for nivolumab was not demonstrated in the intent-to -treat populatio n (HR=0.87, 95% 
CI 0.68–1.11) or in any of the bi omarker selected sub-groups.
Similarly, in another Phase 3 tr ial in the same setting (KeyNot e-040),7pembrolizu mab showed OS 
benefit over IC in all study participants (HR = 0·80, 0·65–0·9 8), with a significan t OS benefit in 
the sub-population who e xpressed PD-L1, on both tum or and immune cells, mea sured as PD-L1
combined positive score (PD-L1 CPS) ≥ 1 (HR = 0·74, 95% CI 0·58–0·93). In thi s study as well,
PFS benefit was not demonstrated for pembrolizumab arm versus s tandard of care regimen 
(HR = 0·96, 95% CI 0·79–1·16). Thus both of these studies in 2L R/M  SCCHN demonstrate long 
term OS benefit of PD-1 inhibitors in SCCHN participants, irrespective of biomarker expression. 
Additionally, these studies also establish that PD-1 inhibitors may provide a greater efficacy 
benefit in the sub-population of SCCHN participants who e xpress PD-L1 in both tumor and 
immune cells.
Benefit of PD-1 inhibitors as a first-line therapy (1L) for R/M  SCCHN population:
Other recent trials in SCCHN are evaluating PD-1 inhibitors as a first-line therapy (1L) for R/M
SCCHN population. In a Phase 3 st udy of 1L R/M SCCHN (KeyNote- 048), efficacy of 
pembrolizumab as  a single agent or in com bination with chemotherapy (cisplatin+5FU) was 
compared to EXT REME regimen in both PD -L1 CPS high expressers (cut-offs of ≥ 20 and ≥ 1) 
and in all study par ticipants.8,9This study dem onstrated significant improvement in OS compared 
to EXTREME re gimen for pembrolizumab  monotherapy (HR  = 0.61, 95% CI 0.45-0.83, 
p = 0.0007) in part icipants whose tumors expressed PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20. This data further confirms 
that selection based on PD-L1 CPS, a measure of both tumor and i mmune cell PD-L1 expression,
may offer efficacy benefit for single agent PD-1 inhibitor in t his SCCHN population. However, 
this study also demonstrated the lack of PFS benefit for PD-1 i nhibitors versus comparator.

Pembrolizumab demonstrated a numerically lower median PFS (3.4 months) versus EXTREME 
regimen (5.0 months) in  PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20 sub-group (HR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.75-1.29).
Additionally, in the analysis of all study participants (irrespe ctive of PD-L1 CPS) in KeyNote-048, 
only pembrolizumab + chemotherapy (P+C) arm demonstrated statistic ally signi ficant 
improvement in the OS (HR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.63-0.93, p = 0.0034) co mpared to EXTREME
regimen. This suggests that comb ination therapy with PD-1 inhibi tors may be needed for optimal 
efficacy benefit in an unselected patient population. However, in KeyNote-048 P+C demonstrated 
only a modest median OS improvement in this population (13 months for P+C vs 10.7 months for 
EXTREME regimen). Additionally, the safety profile of P+C was not  better than the EXTREME 
regimen with grade 3-4 treatmen t related adverse events reporte d in 71% of participants in P+C
arm and 69% of participants in EXTRE ME regimen arm. Th is population does not currently have 
a treatment option that provides a good benefit-risk balance. Therefore, new combination treatment 
approaches need to be explored to not only improve the survival benefit in participants with high 
PD-L1 CPS but also provide safe and efficacious treatment options for participants irrespective of 
PD-L1 expression. 
Benefit of combining ipilimumab to nivolumab:
Addition of ipilimumab (CTLA-4 inhibitor) to nivolumab has demo nstrated efficacy benefit over 
single agent nivolumab in multiple disease indications including  melanoma, non-small cell lung 
cancer and renal cell carcinoma. This efficacy benefit was not restricted to patients with tumor cell
PD-L1 alone.
 Thus the summary of 
available evidence across indicat ions suggests that a ddition of ipilimumab to nivolumab may offer 
an opportunity to im prove the OS in R/M SCCHN particip ants irrespective of PD-L1 expre ssion 
status, with a relatively better efficacy benefit in participan ts with high PD-L1 CPS. 
Summary of the rationale for the key end-point changes:
Based on the above evolving data in SCCHN in recent years sugges ting PD-L1 CPS as a m ore 
appropriate PD-L1 measure for selecting participants who derive the best benefit for 
immunotherapy and potential for nivolumab + ipilimumab to benefit  a broader SCCHN patient 
population than tumor cell PD-L1 expressers alone.
The primary end-points of the current study (CheckMate 651) will be revised to compare:
•OS of participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20 who are receiving nivolu mab combined with 
ipilimumab to those receiving EXTREME regimen (changed from tumo r cell PD-L1 ≥  1%).
•OS of all study participants (irrespective of PD-L1 expression) w ho are receiving nivolumab 
combined with ipilimumab to those receiving EXTREME regimen.
Additionally, OS for nivolumab + ipilimumab versus EXTREME regime n in participants with 
PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1 will be added as a key sec ondary end-point. The primary end-point of PFS for

1.2.1 The Role of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) 
HPV-associated head and neck cancer, largely presenting in the oropharynx has been increasing 
in incidence in the past few decades.10,11In the US, two-thirds of patients with oropharynx cancer 
have HPV-associated tum ors. In 2010, a pproximately 4,200 squamou s cancers of the oropharynx 
(OPC) caused by tobacco and alcohol and 8,400 new HPV-associated oropharynx cancer will 
present for treatment.12HPV status is an independent prognostic factor for OS and progression-
free survival (PFS) among patients with squamous cell OPC.13In this study (CheckMate 651), 
64% of OPC patients had HPV-positive tumors, as measured in-sit u hybridization for the HPV 
subtype 16. The presence of HPV DNA correlated well with p-16 e xpression (kappa = 0.80; 95% 
CI, 0.73 to 0.87). Patients with HPV-positive tumors had signif icantly increased OS as well as PFS 
compared to patients with HPV-negative tumors. Furthermore, aft er adjusting for demographics, 
T stage, N stage, smoking, patients with HPV-positive OPC had a  58% reduction in the risk of 
death  and a 51% reduction in risk of progression or death. Patients with HPV-negative tumors had 
a 25.1% reduction in OS at 3 years (5 7.1% vs 82.4%) when com pared to patients with HPV-
posit ive tumors.11Local-regional relapse  at 3 years was 21% higher in patients with HPV-negative 
tumo rs: 35.1% (95% CI: 26.4 - 43.8) versus 13.6% (95% CI: 8.9 - 18.3) for HPV-positive tumors 
(P < 0.001). These poor outcomes for HPV-negative patients occur despite the gradual trend 
toward increasing intensification of treatment with altered fra ctionation schema,14concurrent

For patients with HPV-negative tumors altering the method of ra diation delivery and the dosing 
and/or types of concurrent chemotherapy is not sufficient to im prove oncologic outcomes. 
Because HPV-associated head and neck cancers more frequently pr esent in a younger population 
and seem particularly responsive to tr eatment with a b etter overall survival,19attention has focused 
on the subpopulation of > 10 pack-year smoking and N2-N3, whose prognosis is worse 
(60% - 70% 2 year PFS) as well as HPV-negative head and neck canc er patients, whose clinical 
outcome has not improved despite intensification of standard chemotherapeutic agents and 
combinations. Thus, novel therapeutic approaches, such as immune  modulation and blockade of 
suppressive immune cells and signals, are needed in clinical ev aluation.
1.2.2 Immunotherapy in SCCHN and role of PD-L1
Immunotherapeutic approaches recently have demonstrated clinica l efficacy in several cancer 
types, including melanoma, hormone-refractory renal cell c arcinoma, and non-small cell lung  
cancer.20Tumors may modulate and evade the host immune response through a number of 
mechanisms, including down regulation of tumor-specific antigen expression and presentation, 
secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and upregulation of inhibitory ligands. In SCCHN,
down-regulation of T-cell function is thought to be mediated by  multiple mechanisms: i.) Reduced 
expression of co-stimulating mo lecules of the B7-CD28 family21; ii.) Increased expression of 
PD-L1 in tumor cells and tumor associated fibroblasts; and, iii .) Loss of HLA-class I and selective

down-regulation of HLA-A,B,C locus expression resulting in defective antigen 
presentation .21,22,23In a subset of HPV-infected SCCHN, data shows that antigen-proc essing 
machinery components are downregulated compared to the adjacent  normal squamous epithelium 
with incomplete activation of tumor specific T cells or suboptim al target recognition enabling 
tumor progression.24T cell checkpoint regu lators such as CTLA-4 and programmed death-1 
(PD-1, CD279) are cell s urface molecules that, when engaged by their cognate ligands, i nduce 
signaling cascades down-regulating T cell activation and prolif eration.
PD-L1 expression has been associated with poor prognoses in cer tain tum or types such as renal, 
esophageal, gastric, ovarian, pancreatic, and lung cancer.25,26,27,28, 29,30PD-1 engagement on 
T-cells by PD-L1-positive APC or PD-L1-positive tumor cells in t he tumor microenvironment 
may limit effective immune responses. Conversely, PD-L1 express ion may be a positive 
prognostic factor as it may indicate infiltration of tumor-spec ific T cells that secrete IFN- γ, which 
upregulates PD-L1 e xpression. Consistent with this  hypothesis is t he co-localizati on of lymphoid 
cell infiltrates and PD-L1 staining observed in human melanoma lesions.31PD-L1 expression in 
SCCHN has been reported; preliminary results from a Phase 1 tria l in patients with 32recurrent or 
metastatic disease observed that 77.9% of patients tested (N = 10 4) expressed PD-L1, defined as 
≥1% of stained cells in the tumor microenvironment.
PD-L1 CPS is defined as the number of PD-L1 staining cells (tum or cells, lymphocytes, 
macrophages) divided by the total number of viable tumor cells,  multiplied by 100.33PD-L1 CPS 
is a composite score that incorporates both tumor and tumor-associated immune cell (TAIC) PD-
L1 expression, whereas tumor proportion score (TPS) or tumor ce ll PD-L1 only reflects the 
percentage of tumor cells that are positive for PD-L1 expressio n. Emerging evidence suggests that 
PD-L1 CPS as the biomarker that could be a good predictor of re sponse with check-point 
inhibitors.
The role of the PD-1 blockade in squamous non-small cell carcinom a of the lung has been
established in CA209017 study,34where nivolumab monotherapy in the second-line treatment 
setting demo nstrated clinically meaningful survival benefit regardless of PD-L1 expr ession
compared to standard of care docetaxel. In a similar histology,  for squamous cell carcinoma of the 
head and neck primary, the role of PD-1 blockade is evolving. CheckMate 141 study (CA209141), is a randomized, open-label, Phas e 3 trial that compared 
nivolumab, a fully human anti-programmed death 1 (PD- 1) monoclonal anti body, to investigator’s 
choice (IC) of systemic therapy in patients with recurrent or metastat ic SCCHN who progressed 
from a platinum-containing therapy. At the primary analysis, th e median OS was 7.5 months (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 5.5 to 9.1) with nivolumab versus 5.1  months (95% CI, 4.0 to 6.0) with 
IC. There is a 30% redu ction in the risk of death for patients on the nivolumab arm (h azard ratio 
0.70; 97.73% CI, 0.51 to 0.96; P = 0. 0101) over IC. The  overall r esponse rate (ORR) was 13.3% 
with nivolumab versus 5.8% with IC. In addition, the over all safety profile of nivolumab was 
favorable compared to IC.
35Clinical benefit seen in this chemotherapy pre-tr eated SCCHN
suggests the po tential clinical activity of nivolumab in earlie r treatment setting.

In the long-term (2-y ear) follow-up of the CheckMate 141 study ( CA209141), nivolumab showed 
a consistent long term benefit in OS compared to IC systemic ther apy (HR = 0.68 [95% CI: 0.54, 
0.86]) in the overall study- population. Furthermore, nivolumab demonstrated 45% reduction in 
risk of death versus IC in patients whose tumors expressed tumor  cell PD-L1 ≥1% (HR = 0.55 
[95% CI: 0.39, 0.78]). In a sub-group analysis of this study, p articipants who had both tumor cell 
PD-L1≥ 1% and a high tumor-associated immune cell PD-L1 (TAIC) expression demonstrated a 
relatively better OS benef it (HR: 0.43, 95% CI 0.28, 0.67) with median OS of 9 months. In 
participants who only showed high expression of TAICs a 33% redu ction in risk of death was 
noted (HR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.38, 1.18), with a median OS of 11.73 months. This recent data, while 
confirming the clinical benefit of check-point inhibitors in th e over-all SCCHN population 
(irrespective of baseline biomarker status), also demonstrates a relatively b etter efficacy in 
participants with high PD-L1 CPS.36.
A recent Phase 3 study (KeyNote-048) evaluated immunotherapy eith er as a single agent 
(pembrolizumab) or in combination with chemotherapy (pembrolizu mab+platinum+5FU) in 1L 
R/M SCCHN. The study demonstrated  that the participants expressing high PD-L1 CPS
≥ 20 derive a significant s urvival benefit with i mmunotherapy compared to treatment with 
EXTREME regimen (HR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.45- 0.83, p = 0.0007). This sub- group (PD-L1 CPS
≥ 20) covers approximately 40-45% of the 1L recurrent or metasta tic SCCHN population. The 
study also evaluated pembrolizumab monotherapy in participants w ho expressed PD-L1 CPS
≥ 1 (approximately 85% of the study population) and pembrolizumab + chemotherapy in all study 
participants. The results showed a modest 2 months improvement in  median OS for 
pembrolizumab monotherapy compared to EXTREME regimen in PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1 sub-group 
(HR= 0.78, 95% CI 0.64-0.96, p = 0.0086) and a 2.3 months improvement in median OS for pembrolizumab + chemotherapy compared to EXTREME regimen in all-c omes population 
(HR = 0.77 , 95% CI 0.63-0.93, p = 0.0034). The pembrolizumab + chemot herapy regimen did not 
offer significant benefit over EX TREME regimen for duration of tumor response (median 
6.7 months for P+C versus 4.3 months with EXTREME regimen) or in terms of overall safety 
profile. This recent data, while supporting p atient selection based on PD-L1 CPS level for 
treatment with immunotherapy, also suggests that neither pembro lizumab monotherapy or 
pembrolizumab + chemotherapy ar e optimal treatment options unsele cted 1L R/M SCCHN patient 
population or thos e with low PD-L1 CPS levels.
Similar encouraging data on PD-L1 CPS selection for PD-1 inhibitors have been recently reported 
in other indications as well. In KeyNote-059 Cohort 1, patients  with advanced gastric cancer (GC)
who had received ≥2 lines of prior chemotherapy were treated wi th pembrolizumab monotherapy 
(n = 257). Pem brolizumab showed promising clinical activity with antitumor response 
significantly associated with PD-L1 CPS (P = 0.002) but not TPS (P = 0.224) at PD-L1 
CPS/TPS ≥ 1. The odds ratio between t he PD-L1 positive and negati ve populations had increased 
from 1.4 for TPS ≥ 1 to 2.8 for PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1, indicating the bett er predictive value of PD-L1 
CPS compared to TPS.
In CA209-032 GC cohorts, P D-L1 CPS has been associated with lon ger survival. The mOS for 
patients with PD-L1 CPS 
≥ 5 was 7.7 months compared with 5.4 months for PD-L1 CPS < 5 when

all tr eatment regimens were combined. These data suggested PD-L1 CPS is a better predictor of 
treatment effects of immunotherapy in advanced or metastatic GC /GEJ.
Based on accumulating clinical data, PD-L1 CPS seems to better predict response than TPS and 
able to better select patients for treatment with checkpoint inhibitors.
Additionally, recent evolving data from multiple Phase 3 studie s in SCCHN (Checkmate 141, 
KeyNote-040 and KeyNote-048) suggest that PFS did not capture the b enefit of immunotherapy
therapy versus standard of care ther apy in both biomarker selec ted and unselected population. In 
1L R/M SCCHN, pembrolizumab showed a median PFS of 3.4 months i n participants with PD-L1 
CPS ≥ 20 sub-group and 3.2 months in participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1 sub-group versus 5.0 
months with EXTREME regimen. This s uggest that PFS is not an ideal end-point for 
immunotherapy.
Based on the review of available data, this study (CA209651) wil l be revised to compare the 
difference in OS between study arms in participants who express P D-L1 CPS ≥ 20 and in all study 
participants as the co-primary end-points. 1.2.3 Rationale for Combination of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab
Preclinical data indicate that the combination of PD-1 and CTLA -4 receptor blockade may 
improve antitumor activity. In vitro combinations of nivolumab plus ipilimumab increase IFN-γ 
production 2- to 7-fold over either agent alone in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. Increased 
antitumor activity of the combination was also observed in 3 of  5 syngeneic murine cancer models. 
In a murine melanoma vaccine model, blockade with either CTLA-4  or PD-1 antibodies increased 
the proporti on of CTLA-4 and PD-1-expressi ng CD4/CD8 tumor infiltrating T effector cells, and 
dual blockade increased tumor infiltration of  T effect or cells and decreased intratumoral 
T regulatory cells, as compared to either agent alone .
19
Checkmate 141 showed that nivolumab monotherapy increased the l ength of time p atients lived 
when compared with standard, single agent chemotherapy with a re latively better efficacy noted 
in tumor cell PD-L1 expressers. In similar trials in lung cancer p atients that had recurred after 
treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy, nivolumab monothera py also prolonged survival 
versus single agent chemotherapy, both in tumors with squamous subtype, and non-squamous 
subtype. These trials led to approval of nivolumab for previous ly treated lung cancer in the US, 
Europe, and other countries.
In the clinical setting, the combi nation of nivolumab and ipili mumab was evaluated in CA209004 
(MDX1106-04), a Phase 1b multiple ascending dose st udy in par ticipants with treatment-naive 
and previously treated advanced melanoma. Results showed promis ing activity with higher, 
tolerable toxicity profile compared to ipilimumab alone. Based on this, CA209069, a randomized 
double-blind Phase 2 study of nivolumab in combination with ipi limumab versus ipilimumab 
monotherapy in participants with BRAF-wild type (WT) and mutant, with untreated unresectable 
or metastatic melanoma, was conducted. The regimens used were: nivolumab 1 mg/kg + 
ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by nivolu mab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks 
versus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses .20In patients with BRAF-WT tumors treated

with nivolumab and ipilimumab combination, there was improved O RR at 61% (44/72), with 22% 
(16/72) complete responses (CR), as compared to 11% (4/37) with  0 CRs in those treated with 
ipilimumab alone. The median PFS was not reached in the combina tion versus 4.4 months for 
ipilimumab alone (HR = 0.4). Improved clinical outcomes (PFS and ORR) with nivolumab and 
ipilimumab combination was confirmed by CA 209067, a ra ndomized Phase 3 study. In patients 
with previously untreated, unresectable or metastatic melanoma (n =945), the median PFS was 
11.5 months (95% CI, 8.9 to 16.7) in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab  group, 6.9 months 
(95% confidence in terval [CI], 4.3 to 9.5) in the nivolumab grou p, and 2.9 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 
3.4) in the ipilimumab group. Signi ficantly longe r PFS was obse rved in the nivolumab plus
ipilimumab group than in the ipilimumab group (h azard ratio for  death or dis ease progression, 
0.42; 99.5% CI, 0.31 to 0.57; P<0.001) and in the nivolumab gro up than in the ipilimumab group 
(HR = 0.57; 99.5% CI, 0.43 to 0.76; P<0.001). The hazard ratio f or the comparison between the 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab group and the nivolumab group was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.60 to 0.92).37
Clinical activity of nivolumab and ipilimumab combination was f urther evaluated in patients with 
stage IIB-IV NSCLC as first- line treatment in CA209012 study .38This was a large Phase 1, 
multi-arm safety study of nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab i n combination with various 
systemic anticancer therapies like ipilimumab, platinum-based c hemotherapies and epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Early co mbination cohorts evaluated 
2 dosing schedules that were s tudied in the CA209004 melanoma st udy: nivolumab 1 mg/kg + 
ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (arms G and H, n = 24) and nivolumab 3 mg/kg +  ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (arms 
I and J, n = 25). Both regimens were given every 3 weeks 4 doses,  followed by maintenance 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg q 2 weeks. Unlike in melanoma, these regimens res ulted in significant toxicity 
in the NSCLC population, with 39% of patients discontinuing tre atment due to a treatment-related 
adverse events. Thus, additional combination cohorts were initi ated (arms N, O, P, Q), using lower 
doses of both nivolumab and ipilimumab, or the approved dose of  nivolumab with less frequent 
dosing of ipilimumab. These new regi mens were better tolerated, and the safety profile was 
comparable to what has been observed in  the nivolumab monotherapy cohort (arm F) in CA209012
study (Table 1.2.3-1).

Clinical activity was observed in all combination coh orts ( Table 1.2.3-2 ), but numerically higher 
response rates were observe d in cohorts evaluating t he ap proved dose of niv olumab 3 mg/kg in 
combination with ipilimumab, with confirmed respo nse r ates ≥30% ( cohorts P and Q). When 
clinical activity was analyzed by tumor cell PD-L1 expression, there appears to be higher efficacy 
in participants with PD-L1 expressing tumors however interpretation is limited by the sm all 
number of patients. Those with tumor c ell PD-L1 ≥1% expressing tumors treated with nivolumab 
and ipilimumab combination in c ohorts P and Q ha d response rate s of 48%. PFS appeared to be 
also higher in these subsets; of note, in cohort Q, PFS was not  yet reach ed (Table 1.2.3-3 ). 
Although follow-up is still limited (7 to 8 months), the PFS and ORRs obser ved i n these cohorts 
are highly encouraging. With comparable efficacy and safety dat a from cohorts P and Q, t he 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab every 6 week dosing schedule (cohort Q) is the selected regime n 
moving forward.39Aside from utilizing the approved nivolumab dose in NSCLC, it w ould also 
provide the  highest dose and frequency of ipilimumab feasible i n a combination regimen.
The combination of ipilimumab with nivolumab showed increased ac tivity versus nivolumab alone 
in multiple tumor types, including melanoma, multiple types of lung cancer, gastric cancer, and 
renal cancer as described below. This efficacy benefit is not r estricted to tumor cell PD-L1
expressers alone. The combination is currently approved for the t reatment of advanced or 
metastatic melanoma in the US and Europe. 
Given the similarity in patient profiles of NSCLC and SCCHN, ni volumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks 
and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks  
 and will also b e the treatment regimen for the experiment al arm of the Phase 3 CA209651 
study.  
 
Thus the 
summary of available evidence across indications suggests that addition of ipilimumab to 
nivolumab may offer an opportuni ty to improve the efficacy OS in  R/M SCCHN participants
irrespective PD-L1 expression , with a relativ ely better  efficacy benefit in participants with high 
PD-L1 CPS.
Overall, as discussed previously, based on the evolving data fr om SCCHN suggesting a relatively 
better efficacy for immunotherapy in PD-L1 CPS high expressers a nd potential for 
Nivolumab + Ipilimumab to benefit participants irrespective of PD- L1 CPS status, the CA209651 
study will evaluate the co-pr imary end-points of OS of the combination of nivolumab with 
ipilimumab versus EXTREME regimen in participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20 and in all study 
participants.1.2.4 Rationale for Shorter Infusion Times for Nivolumab and Ipilimumab
Long infusion times place a burden on patients and treatment ce ntres. Establishing that nivolumab 
and ipilimumab can be safely administered using shorter infusio n times of 30 minutes duration in 
participants will diminish the burden provide d no change in safet y profile. Previous clinical studies 
of nivolumab monotherapy and ipilimumab monotherapy and the combination of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab have used a 60-minute infusion duration for nivolumab and 90-minute infusion

duration for ipilimu mab (1 - 3 mg/ kg dosing for both). However, both nivolumab and ipilimumab 
have been administered at up to 10 mg/kg with the same infusion duration.
Nivolumab has been administered safely over 60 minutes at doses  ranging up to 10 mg/kg safely 
over long treatment duration. In Study CA209010 (a Phase 2, ran domized, double blinded, 
dose-ranging study of nivolumab in participants with advanced/me tastatic clear cell RCC), a dose 
association was observed for infusion site reactions and hypers ensitivity reactions (1.7% at 
0.3 mg/kg, 3.7% at 2 mg /kg and 18.5% at 10 mg /kg). All the event s were Grade 1 - 2 and were 
manageable. An infusion duration of 30 minutes for 3 mg/kg nivol umab (30% of the  dose provided 
at 10 mg/kg) is not expected to present any safety concerns com pared to the prior experience at 
10 mg/kg nivolumab dose infused over a 60-minute duration.Similarly, ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg has been safely administered over 90 minutes. In the CA184022 
study, where ipilimumab was administered up to a dose of 10 mg/ kg, on-study drug related 
hypersensitivity events (Grade 1 - 2) were reported in 1 (1.4%) participant in the 0.3 mg/kg and in 
2 (2.8%) participants in the 10 mg/kg group. There  were no drug-r elated hypersensitivity events 
reported in the 3 mg/kg group. Across the 3 treatment groups, n o Grade 3 - 4 drug-related 
hypersensitivity events were reported, and there were no reports  of infusion reacti ons. Ipilimumab 
10 mg/kg monotherapy has also been safely administered as 90 min ute infusion in large Phase 3 
studies in prostate cancer (CA184043) and as adjuvant therapy f or stage 3 melanoma (CA184029), 
with infusion reactions occurring in participants. Administering 1 mg/kg of ipilimumab represents one-tenth of the 10 mg/kg dose.
Overall, infusion reactions including high-grade hypersensitivi ty reactions have been uncommon 
across nivolumab or ipilimumab clinical studies or the combinat ion of nivolumab and ipilimumab. 
Furthermore, a 30-minute break after the first infusion for the  combination cohort will ensure the 
appropriate safety monitoring before the start of the second in fusion. Overall, a change in safety 
profile is not anticipated with 30-minute infusio n of nivoluma b, ipilimumab or combination.
1.2.5 Rationale for Permitting Continued Treatment in Select Cases of 
Progressive Disease 
Accumulating clinical evidence indicates some participants treat ed with immune system 
stimulating agents may develop progression of disease  (by conventional response criteria) before 
demonstrating clinical objective responses and/or stable diseas e. This phenomenon was observed 
in approximately 10% of participants in the Phase 1 study of niv olumab and also with ipilimumab 
monotherapy
40Two hypotheses have been put forth to explain this phenomenon. First, enhanced 
inflammation within tumors could lead to an increase in tumor s ize which would appear as 
enlarged index lesions and as newly visible small non-index lesions. Over time, both the malignant 
and inflammatory portions of the mass may then decrease leading  to overt signs of clinical 
improvement. Alternatively, in some individuals, the kinetics o f tumor growth may initially 
outpace anti-tumor immune activity. With sufficient time, the a nti-tumor activity will dominate 
and become clinically apparent. Therefore participants w ill be allowed to continue study therapy 
after initial investigator- assessed RECIST 1.1 defined progression if they are assessed to be

therapy upon evidence of further progression as defined in section 4.5.5.
1.2.6 Rationale for 24 Months Maximum Treatment Duration 
The optimal duration of treatment by checkpoint blockade inhibi tors in oncology is currently 
unknown. However, given their mechanism of action continuous tr eatment may not be required as 
opposed to targeted agents or most of cytotoxic therapies. 
With almost a decade of experience using CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, accumulating 
evidence from different clinical trials in different tumor type s indicates that most of the responses 
are generally occurring early, with a median time to response o f 2 to 4 months including in patients 
with NSCLC, and most of the responses are likely to be durable as compared to conventional 
therapies.41’42’43
Limited duration of therapy was explored in few trials, for ins tance, ipilimumab the first 
checkpoint blockade inhibitor targeting CTLA-4 was initially ap proved in metastatic melanoma in 
participants who failed standard of care chemotherapy. This appr oval was based on overall 
survival improvement after a limited  duration of ipilimumab the rapy, including only 4 induction 
doses for a duration of treatment of 12 weeks, with a sustained  plateau in survival starting at around 
year two.44Moreover, in Checkmate 003 a dose-escalation cohort expansion t rial evaluating the 
safety and clinical activity of nivolumab in patients with adva nced solid tumors implemented 
stopping nivolumab monotherapy at 96 weeks (~ 2 years). At 2 ye ars, 16 NSCLC participants who 
were on still on therapy discontinued nivolumab per protocol, o f these, 75% of p atients (n = 12) 
were alive > 5 years and did not receive further therapy after s topping nivolumab and remained 
progression free.45
Moreover, long-term follow up data from study KeyNote-006 a pha se 3 Melanoma study 
demonstrates that pembrolizumab provides durable efficacy after  stopping the protocol-specified 
duration of treatment at 2 years. The median follow-up was of 3 3.9 months, among the 104 (19%) 
participants who completed pembrolizumab, median exposure was 24 .0 months. After additional 
median follow-up of 9.0 months after completion of pembrolizuma b, 102 (98%) pts were alive 
and responses were durable in pts who completed pembrolizumab.46
In addition, data from different series are s howing that patients receiving immunotherapy-based 
treatment may discontinue tr eatment due to safety events. In a recent analysis in a melanom a study 
the majority of patients who discontinue nivolumab and/or ipili mumab for toxicity maintain 
disease control in the absence of further treatment.47
CheckMate 153 is the first ra ndomized study to evaluate treatment duration with a PD-1/PD-L1 
inhibitor. In this study, progression free survival appears to be durable with a plateau at 2 years 
from first dose including in pts who stopped nivolumab after 1 y ear, suggesting the risk of 
progression after 2 years of treatment is minimal, even in the absence of further treatment, which 
is consistent with existing data with PD-1/PD-L1 datasets. In a ddition, 34 out of 87 patients with 
clinical benefit who stopped therapy at  1 year w ere retreated upon progression as per protocol, in 
this group, nivolumab retreatment did not appear to re-induce r esponses and in the majority of the

cases, the tumor continues to  progress suggesti ng that treatmen t change, using preferentially an 
agent or approach with a different MOA.48
Collectively, these data suggest that there is likely no benefi t from treatment beyond two years in 
advanced tumors. However, even though immunotherapy is w ell tolerated, patients w ill be exposed 
to the risk of additional toxicity with longer-term treatment. Therefore, in CA209-651 treatment 
with nivolumab +/- ipilimumab will be given for up to 2 years fr om start of treatment.

1.5 Product Development Background
Nivolumab (Opdivo) is in clinical development for the treatment  of patients with melanoma, 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), head and neck carcinoma and 
other tumors (eg, gastric cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, Hodgkins lymphoma, small cell lung 
cancer). Opdivo as monotherapy has been approved in the US in m ultiple indications, including, 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression fol lowing ipilimumab and a BRAF 
inhibitor, if BRAF V600 mutation positive; previously untreated  patients with BRAF wild-type 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma;  NSCLC with progression on or after platinum-based 
chemotherapy; and advanced renal cell carcinoma who have received prior anti-angiogenic 
therapy. The combination of nivolumab a nd ipilimumab has also been approved in the US for the 
treatment of previously untreated metastatic melanoma.
Patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN have poor prognosis and experience limited survival 
benefit with standard of care therapies. In patients with recur rent or metastatic SCCHN who 
progress with platinum chemotherapy, nivolumab demonstrated pro longed survival benefit over 
standard of care in the Checkmate 141 study and is poised to be come the standard of care in this 
population. To furthe r improve clinical outcomes in patients wit h recurrent or metastatic SCCHN
in the first-line treatment setting, nivolumab in combination w ith ipilimumab is being explored in 
the CA209651 clinical study.

1.5.1 Mechanism of Action of Nivolumab
Nivolumab (also referred to as BMS-936558 or MDX1106) is a huma n monoclonal antibody 
(HuMAb; immunoglobulin G4 [IgG4]-S228P) that targets the progra mmed death-1 (PD 1) cluster 
of differentiation 279 (CD279) cell s urface membrane receptor. PD-1 is a negative regulatory 
molecule expressed by activated T and B lymphocytes49. Binding of PD-1 to its ligands, 
programmed death–ligands 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2), results in th e down-regulation of 
lymphocyte activation. Inhibition of the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands promotes 
immune responses and antigen-specific T-cell responses to both foreign antigens as well as self-
antigens. Nivolumab is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)  cells and is produced using 
standard mammalian cell cultivation and chromatographic purific ation technologies. The clinical 
study product is a sterile soluti on for parent eral administrati on.
1.5.2 Mechanism of Action of Ipilimumab
CTLA-4, an activation-induced T-cell surface molecule, is a mem ber of the CD28:B7 
immunoglobulin superfamily that comp etes with CD28 for B7. CTLA -4 mediated signals are 
inhibitory and turn off T cell-dependent immune responses. Ipil imumab is a fully human 
monoclonal IgG1κ that binds to the CTLA-4 antigen expressed on a subset of T cells from human 
and nonhuman primates. The proposed mechanism of action for ipi limumab is interference of the 
interaction of CTLA-4 with B7 molecules on APCs, with subsequen t blockade of the inhibitory 
modulation of T-cell activation promoted by the CTLA 4/B7 inter action50,51. 
1.5.3 Nivolumab Combined With IpilimumabThe combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab has been studied in  various tumor types such as 
melanoma and r ecently, as first line therapy in participants wit h previously untreated stage IV or 
recurrent NSCLC at different dose and schedules in study CA2090 12. As of 17 March 2015, 
80 patients have been treated with this combination in the origi nal cohorts (arms G, H, I, J, N). 
Additional combination dosing schedules were developed using lo wer doses of both nivolumab 
and ipilimumab (1 mg/kg), or using the approved dose of nivoluma b (3 mg/kg) with more extended 
dosing of ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (q6w and q12w). An additional 117 patients have been treated in 
these newer cohorts, a nd compared to other co horts, shows acceptable safety profile with lower 
treatment r elated AEs (all grade and Grade 3-4) as well as lower treatment related AEs leading to 
discontinua tion (Table  1.5.3-1). Based on the efficacy and safet y data, nivoluma b plus ipilimumab 
every 6 we ek dosing schedule was determined to be  optimal combination regimen in NSCLC. 
Additional clinical data and rationale for the combinat ion regimen is discussed in Section 1.2.3.

1.6 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment
Patients with recurrent, unresectable or metastatic SCCHN represe nt an important unmet need. 
There is robust clinical data available to suggest the potential to improve cli nical outcomes in 
SCCHN:
•CheckMate 141 study (CA209141), is a randomized, open label, Ph ase 3 trial that compared 
nivolumab, a fully human anti-programmed death 1 (PD 1) monoclo nal antibody, to 
investigator’s choice (IC) of systemic therapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN 
who progressed from a platinum-con taining therapy. At the primary analysis, the median OS 
was 7.5 months (95% confiden ce interval [CI], 5.5 to 9.1) with nivolumab versus 5.1 months 
(95% CI, 4.0 to 6.0) with IC. There is a 30% reduction in the r isk of death for patients  on the 
nivolumab arm  (hazard ratio 0.70;  97.73% CI, 0.51 to 0.96; P = 0.0101) over IC. The overall 
response rate (ORR) was 13.3% with nivolumab versus 5.8% with I C. The long-term follow-
up data from the study confirms the prolonged survival benefit in the overall study population, while suggesting a relatively better OS in subjects who express PD-L1 on both tumor and 
immune cells. In addition, the overall safety profile and patie nt reported outcomes of 
nivolumab was favorable compared to IC. Clinical benefit seen in  this chemotherapy pre-
treated SCCHN suggests the potential clinical activity of nivol umab in earlier treatment setting.
•A recent Phase 3 study (KeyNote-048) in 1L R/M SCCHN evaluated immunotherapy either as 
a single agent (pembrolizumab) or in combination with chemother apy (pembrolizumab 
+platinum+5FU) in 1L R/M SCCHN. The study demonstrated that the  participants expressing 
high PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20 derive a significant s urvival benefit with imm unotherapy compared to 
treatment with EXTREME regimen (HR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.45-0.83, p = 0. 0007). This study 
also demonstrated that immunotherapy had a favorable safety pro file vs EXTREME. There 
was a lower incidence of any-grade, grade 3-4, and grade 5 trea tment-related AEs, and lower 
incidence of treatment-related A Es leading to discontinuation.

•CheckMate 012 study (CA209112)
is a multi-arm large phase 1 safe ty study of nivolumab as 
a single agent or in combination with various systemic anticance r therapies including 
ipilimumab in patients with stage IIIB-IV NSCLC as first-line t reatment. Clinical activity was 
observed in all combination cohorts wit h numericall y higher response rates observed in cohorts 
evaluating nivoluma b 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg, with confirmed response rates ≥30% 
and median PFS ~8 months. 
Given the similarity in patient profiles of NSCLC and SCCHN, ni volumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks 
and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks (will be the tr eatment reg imen for the experimental arm 
of this study.
The safety profile of nivolumab and ipilimumab is well characte rized from a large safety database 
at different dose and schedules as monotherapy or in combination .52,53Consistent with the 
mechanism of action of nivolumab and ipilimumab, the most frequ ently reported drug-related 
adverse events observed in clinical trials are those associated  with activation of the immune 
system. The most common types of immune-mediated adverse events  include endocrinopathies, 
diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis and rash. I n the combination regimen, the 
frequency and intensity of these events may vary and depend on the specific dose and schedule 
used. In the combination dosing schedule selected for this stud y (nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W plus 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W), immune-mediated adverse events were mos tly low grade and 
manageable with prompt use of corticosteroids. Nivolumab was evaluated in 240 patients with recurrent or metastatic platinum refractory SCCHN 
in CA209141 study and demonstrated a favorable safety profile w ith nivolumab monotherapy as 
compared to standard of care chemotherapy. Nivolumab in combina tion with ipilimumab will be 
evaluated in the SCCHN population for the first time.
To assure an ongoing favorable risk/benefit assessment for part icipants enrolled onto CA209651, 
the following safety measures will be employed throughout the c onduct of the study:
•Institution of a Data Monitori ng Committee (DMC) to provide ind ependent oversight of safety, 
study conduct and efficacy o f nivoluma b plus ipilimumab combination versus standard of care 
chemotherapy (EXTREME regimen).
•Rigorous safety monitoring by BMS to ensure participants’ safet y including regular and 
systematic review of safety data, close follow-up of reported s afety events, intensive site and 
study investigator training/education on the implementation of the nivolumab and ipilimumab 
toxicity management algorithms as well as regular safety confer ence calls with study 
investigators.
•Open-label drug administration of study drugs to allow for prompt and accurate assessment of 
the unique toxicities associated with study treatments
In conclusion, the overall risk-benefit of nivolumab and ipilimumab as first-line treatment in 
recurrent or metastatic SCCHN is deemed acceptable.

3.1 Study Design and Duration
Protocol CA209651 is a randomized open-label, Phase 3 trial in subjects ≥18 years old with 
untreated met astatic or recurrent SCCHN that is not amenable to  curative therapy, evaluating 
nivolumab + ipilimumab versus the EXTREME regimen (cetuximab + c isplatin/carboplatin + 
fluorouracil) as a first-line treatment. 
HPV p-16 status and tumor cell PD-L1 status (expressing or non-exp ressing/non-evaluable) test 
results will be needed prior to randomization. Subjects will un dergo screening evaluations to 
determine eligibility prior to randomization. 
The dose and treatment schedules for each arm are as follows:
•Arm A: Nivolumab + Ipilimumab Arm:
−Nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks + Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg IV every 6 weeks until 
progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months fr om first study treatment.
•Arm B: EXTREME regimen Arm:
−Cetuximab 400 mg/m
2IV for the initial dose only, then 250 mg/m2weekly + cisplatin 
(100 mg/m2) or carboplatin (AUC of 5 mg per milliliter per minute) on Day  1  a n d  
fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 per day for 4 days) every 3 weeks for maximum of 6 cycles
followed by maintenance cetuximab at 250 mg/m2weekly (or every 2 weeks, per local 
prescribing informat ion) until disease progression or unacceptab le toxicity; the choice of 
cisplatin or carboplatin is at the discretio n of the investigator.
Approximately 930 subjects  will be randomized to the two tr eatment arms in a 1:1 ratio and 
stratified by the following factors: 
•Tumor cell PD-L1 status (expressing [ ≥1%] vs non-expre ssing [< 1%] or non-evaluable). Up 
to 10% of ra ndomized subjects per cohort can be included into the study as “non-evaluable.” 
After this point, subjects with non-evaluable results will not b e permitted to be randomized; 
the site would need to submit an additional tumor tissue for te sting with either a result of 
“expressing” or non-expressing” in order to randomize the subject .
•HPV p-16 status (oropharyngeal HPV p-16 positive vs oropharyngea l HPV p-16 negative or 
non-oropharyngeal). Oropharyngeal CA sites defined in Appendix 5.
•Prior chemotherapy (adjuvant/neoadjuvant/multimodal treatment) st atus (Yes/No)

Tumor progression or response will be assessed by investigator using RECIST 1.1 criteria. 
Treatment with study medicat ion will continue un til RECIST 1.1 defined progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, a maximum of 24 months from the first stu dy treatment, or withdrawal of 
consent. See Section 3.5 for full details of discontinuation of study drug treatment.
Dose reductions will be not be allowed for nivolumab or ipilimum ab.
Treatment be yond initial investigator-assessed progression (either clinical or radiographical) is 
permitted for nivolumab and ipilimumab if the part icipant has an investigator-assessed clinical 
benefit and is tolerating study drug (see Section 4.5.6 ).
In addition to investigator assessment of response  and p rogression, there w ill be a blinded 
independent central review (BICR) of tumor scans an d study sites will need to submit tumor scans 
for central radiology review.
A DMC will be established and meet regularly during the study to  ensure that participant safety is 
carefully monitored and to provide oversight regarding safety a nd efficacy considerations in 
protocol CA209651.
The maximum duration of the study from start of randomization t o final analysis of OS is projected 
to be 51 months, assuming 26 months accrual duration. Additional survival follow-up may 
continue for up to 5 years from the time of this analysis. The study will end once survival follow-
up has concluded.The study design schematic is prese nted in Figure 3.1-1.

•Participant is enrolled using the Interactive Voice Response Syst em (IVRS).
•Tumor tissue (archival or recent tumor biopsy) must be submitte d by the site to a Central Lab 
for determination of tumor cell PD-L1 status. For this study we w ill use PD-L1 stained with 
the DAKO 28-8 anti body. Additional tumor tissue may be required by Central Lab if  ini tial 
testing is unevaluable.
•HPV p-16 status must be available pri or to ra ndomization. If it is not available locally, then 
this will need to be tested by central lab, and the results need  to be known prior to 
randomization. See Section 5.6.8.
Participants will be stratified on tumor cell PD-L1 status (expr essing vs non-expressing or non-
evaluable. Up t o 10% of randomized subjects can be included into the study as non-evaluable. 
After this point, subjects with non-evaluable results will not be permitted to be randomized; 
the site would need to submit an additional tumor tissue for te sting with either a result of 
expressing or non-expressing in order to randomize the subject) .
•Participants must have the result of tumor cell PD-L1 IHC testing from the Central Lab 
available (and HPV p-16 result if not available locally) in ord er to rando mize into the study.
•Participant is assessed for study eligibility.
•All screening assessments and procedures must be performed prio r to randomization.
Treatment Phase
•The treatment begins with the contact to the IVRS to randomize t he patient.
•Treatment to begin within 3 days of randomization.
Arm A: Nivolumab + Ipilimumab Combo (1 Cycle = 6 Weeks):
•Nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV will be administered every 2 weeks ( ±3 days) + Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg 
IV will be administered every 6 weeks ( ±3d a y s ) .
•On the day of infusion, nivolumab is to be administered first. The second infusion will always 
be ipilimumab and will start at least 30 minutes after completio n of the nivolumab infusion.
•Nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W will be continue d until the 
progression of disease, discontinuation due to toxicity, withdr awal of consent, or a maximum 
of 24 months from the first study treatment, or st udy closure (see Section 3.5 for full list of 
treatment discontinuation reasons). Participants may discontinue  only ipilimumab and 
continue treatment with nivolumab if certain circumstances are met (See Section 4.5.6 ,
Treatment Beyond Disease Progression (Arm A only).
•Treatment be yond initial investigator-assessed RECIST 1.1-defin ed progression is permitted 
for Arm A if the participant has investigator-assessed clinical benefit and is tolerating 
treatment.

Arm B: EXTREME regi men Arm (1 Cycle = 3 weeks):
•Cetuximab 400 mg/m2IV for the initial dose only, then 250 mg/m2weekly + cisplatin 
(100 mg/m2) or carboplatin (AUC of 5 mg per milliliter per minute) on Day  1 and fluorouracil 
(1000 mg/m2per day for 4 days) every 3 weeks for maximum of 6 cycles follo wed by 
maintenance cetuximab at 250 mg/m2weekly (or every 2 weeks, per local prescribing 
information) until disease progre ssion or unacceptable toxicity ; the choice of cisplatin or 
carboplatin is at the disc retion of the investigator.
•Study assessments are to be collected as outlined in Table 5.1-2
•Upon completion of dosing, participants will enter the Follow-u p Phase.
Follow-up Phase
The post-treatment fo llow-up begins when the decision to discon tinue a participant from all 
treatment is made.
•Participants who discontinue treatment  for reasons other than d isease progression will continue 
to have tumor assessments (if clinically feasible) according to  the schedule in  Table 5.1-3 until 
progression.
Participants will be followed for drug-related toxicities until  these toxicities resolve, return to 
baseline or are deemed irreversible. All adverse events will be  documented for a minimum of 100 
days after the last dose of study medication.
After completion of the first 2 follow-up visits, participants wi ll be followed every 3 months for 
survival. Survival Follow-up visits may be performed by phone c ontact or office visit. BMS may 
request that survival data be collected on all tr eated participants outside of the protocol-defined 
window. At that time of this reque st, each participant will be co ntacted to determine their survival 
status unless the participant had withdrawn consent for all cont act.
3.2 Post Study Access to Therapy
At the conclusion of the study, participants who continue to demonstrate clinical benefit will be 
eligible to receive BMS supplied s tudy drug for the maximum trea tment duration as described in 
Section 1.2.6.  Study drug will be provided via an extension of the study, a r ollover study requiring

meet all eligibility criteria. Participants not meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria must not be 
enrolled into the study. There can be no exceptions to this rul e.
Participant Re-enrollment: This study permits the re-enrollment of a participant who has 
discontinued the study as a pre-treatment failure (ie, par ticipant has not been randomized/has not 
been treated). If re-enrolled, the participant must be re-consen ted.
3.3.3 Women of Childbearing Potential
A woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any fem ale who has experienced 
menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hyst erectomy or bilateral 
oophorectomy) and is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined a s 12 months of amenorrhea in 
a woman over age 45 years in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, 
females under the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle st imulating hormone (FSH) level 
> 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
Females treated wit h hormone repl acement therapy (HRT) are likely to have artificially suppresse d 
FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH level. The 
duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of the washout 
period below are suggested guidelines and the investigators should use their judgment in checking serum FSH levels. If the serum FSH level is > 40 mIU/mL at any t ime during the washout period, 
the woman can be considered postmenopausal:
•1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
•4 week minimum for transdermal products
•8 week minimum for oral products

postmenopausal.
3.4 Concomitant Treatments
3.4.1 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments
The following medications are prohibited during the study (unle ss utilized t o treat a drug related 
adverse event):
•Any live/attenuated vaccine (eg varicella, zoster, yellow fever , rotavirus, oral polio and 
measles, mumps, rubella [MMR]) during treatment and until 100 d ays post last dose.
•Immunosuppressive agents.
•Immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (except as stated in section 3.4.2)
•Any concurrent anti-neoplastic therapy (ie, chemotherapy, hormo nal therapy, immunotherapy, 
extensive, non-palliativ e radiation therapy , or standar d or investigation al agents for treatment 
of cancer)
•Surgical resection of tumor
•Any botanical preparation (eg herbal supplements or traditional  Chinese medicines) intended 
to treat the disease unde r study or provide supportive care. Use  of marij uana and its derivatives 
for treatment of symptoms related to cancer or cancer treatment  are permitted if obtained by 
medical prescription or if its use (even without a medical pres cription) has been legalized 
locally.
Caution should be used regarding the use of herbal medications as there may be as yet unknown 
interactions with nivolumab and/or ipilimumab. Discontinuation of the use of herbal medications 
prior to study enrollment is encouraged. Except for the permitt ed procedures specified as palliative 
local therapies ( Section 3.4.3 ), all other radiation therapy or surgery to any tumor lesion is not  
permitted during study treatm ent. Participants who require such non -palliative pro cedures must be 
discontinued from study treatment.
3.4.2 Other Restrictions and Precautions
Participants with a condition requiring systemic treatment with  either corticosteroids (> 10 mg 
daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medicat ions within 14 days of 
randomization are ex cluded. Inhaled or topi cal steroids, and adrenal replacement steroid doses > 
10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence  of active autoimmune disease.
It is the local imagi ng facility’s respons ibility to determine,  based on participant attributes 
(eg, allergy history, diabetic history and renal s tatus), the appropr iate imaging mod ality and 
contrast regimen for each participant. Imaging contraindication s and contrast risks should be 
considered in this assessment. Participants with renal insuffic iency should be assessed as to 
whether or not they s hould r eceive contrast and if so, what typ e and dose of contrast is appropriate. 
If CT is contraindicated for a participant because of an iodinated contrast allergy, then a contrast 
enhanced MRI of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis will be per formed.

Specific to MRI, participants with severe renal insufficiency ( ie, estimated glomerular filtration 
rate [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) are at increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. MRI 
contrast should not be given to this participant population. In addition, safety screening for 
contraindications to MRI sca nning should be performed acc ording to the MR center’s standards 
prior to each MRI procedure. The ultimate decision to perform M RI in an individual participant in 
this study rests with the site radiologist, the investigator an d the standard set by the local Ethics 
Committee.
3.4.3 Permitted Therapy
Participants are permitted the use of topical, ocular, intra-ar ticular, intranasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with  minimal systemic absorpti on). Adrenal rep lacement steroid doses > 10 mg 
daily prednisone are permitted. A brief (less than 3 weeks) cou rse of corticosteroids for 
prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non- autoimmune conditions 
(eg, delayed-type hypersensitivity r eaction cause d by a contact allergen) is permitted.
Regular concomitant use of bisphosphonates and RANK-L inhibitor s for prevent ion or redu ction 
of skeletal-related events in par ticipants with bone metastases is allowed if initiated pri or to first 
dose of study therapy. Prior palliative radiotherapy must have been completed at least 2 weeks 
prior to treatment.
Prior radiotherapy must have been completed at least 2 weeks pri or to randomization . On study 
palliative radiotherapy is only allowed for treatment of painfu l bone lesions. Palliative s urgical 
resection of tum or sites is not per mitted. Participants requiring palliative radiotherapy should b e 
evaluated for objective evidence of disease progression prior t o the initiation of such therapy, 
particularly if the most recent tumor assessment was more than 4 weeks prior to the start of local 
therapy. If progression per RECIST 1.1 is identified on any tum or assessments prior to the 
initiation of palliative local therapy, then participants must either discontinue study drug treatment 
or they must meet criteria to continue tr eatment beyond progression ( Section 4.5.6 )i n  o rder to 
resume immunotherapy after palliative local therapy. The potential for overlapping toxicities with radiotherapy and nivolumab/ipilimumab currently is 
not known; however, anecdotal d ata suggests that it is tolerable. As concurrent radiotherapy a nd 
nivolumab/ipilimumab have not been formally evaluated, in cases  where palliative radiotherapy is 
required for a tumor lesion, th en nivolumab/ipilimumab s hould b e withheld for at least 1 week 
before, during, and 1 week after radiation. Participants should  be closely monitored for any 
potential toxicity during and after receiving radiotherapy, and  AEs should resolve to Grade ≤1 or 
baseline prior to resuming study tr eatment.
3.5 Discontinuation of Subjects following any Treatment with Study Drug 
Participants MUST discontinue investigational product (study tr eatment) for any of the following 
reasons:
•Participant’s request to stop study treatment

•Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness which, in the 
opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the best interest of the participant
•Termination of the study by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS)
•Loss of ability to fr eely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily inca rceration 
for treatment of eit her a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious dis ease) illness. (Note: Under 
specific circumstances, a participant who has been imprisoned m ay be permitted to continue 
as a participant. Strict conditions apply, and BMS approval is required.)
•Pregnancy*
•Additional protocol-specified reasons for discontinuation (See Section 4.5.5 )
•A maximum of 24 months from the first study treatment (Arm A onl y)
*In the case of pregnancy, the investigator must immediately no tify the BMS Medical 
Monitor/designee of this event. In most cases, the study drug w ill be permanently discontinued in 
an appropriate manner. If the investigator determines a possibl e favorable benefit/risk ratio that 
warrants continuation of study drug, a discussion between the i nvestigator and the BMS Medical 
Monitor/designee must occur, if local regulations allow.
All participants who discontinue study drug should comply with protocol specified follow-up 
procedures as outlined in Section 5.1.  The only exception to this requirement is when a participant
withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post-treat ment study follow-up or loses the 
ability to consent fr eely (ie, is imprisoned or involuntarily i ncarcerated for the treatment of either 
a psychiatric or physical illness).
If study drug is discontinued prior to the participant’s comple tion of the study, the reason for the 
discontinuation must be documented in the participant’s medical  records and entered on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF) page.
3.6 Post Study Drug Study Follo w up
Participants who discontinue study drug must  continue to be followed for c ollection of  outcome 
and/or survival follow-up data as required and in line with Section 5.1 until death or the conclusion 
of the study.
Follow-Up Visit 1 is to occur 30 days from th e last dose (± 7 days), or Follo w-Up Visit 1 can be 
performed on date of discontinuation if it is gr eater than 35 days from last do se. Follow-Up Visit 
2 is to occur 90 days from Follow-Up Visit 1 ( ±7 days). Survival Follow-Up Visits to occur 
approximately every 3 months from Follow-Up Visit 2. Survival F ollow-up visits may be 
performed by phone contact or office visit.
BMS may request that survival data be collected on all particip ants outside of the protocol defined 
window ( Table 5.1-3 ). At the time of this request, each participant will be contacted to determine 
their survival status unless the participant has withdrawn consent for all contact.

3.6.1 Withdrawal of Consent
Participants who request to discontinue study drug will remain in the study and must continue to 
be followed for protocol specified follow-up procedures. The on ly exception to this is when a 
participant specifically withdraws consent for any further conta ct with him/her or persons 
previously authorized by participant to provide this information . Participants should notify the 
investigator of the decision to withdraw consent from future fo llow-up in writing , whenever 
possible. The withdrawal of consent should be explained in deta il in the medical records by the 
investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is from further trea tment with st udy drug only or also 
from study procedures and/or post treatment study follow-up, and entered on the appropriate CRF 
page. In the event that vital status (whether the participant is  alive or dead) is being measured, 
publicly available information s hould be used to d etermine vital s tatus only as appropriately 
directed in accordance with local law.
3.6.2 Lost to Follow-Up
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate participants to d etermine and report their ongoing 
status. This includes follow-up with persons authorized by the participant as noted above. Lost to 
follow-up is defined by the inability to reach the participant a fter a minimum of three documented 
phone calls, faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by pa rticipant t o one registered mail letter. 
All attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical records. If it is determined that the 
participant has died, the site will use permi ssible local method s to obtain the date and cause of 
death.
If investigator’s use of third-party representative to assist i n the follow- up portion of the study has 
been included in the participant ’s informed consent, then the i nvestigator may use a 
Sponsor-retained third-party representative to assist site staf f with obtaining participant’s contact 
information or other public vital status data necessary to comp lete the follow-up portion of the 
study. The site staff and representative will consult publicly available sources, such as public 
health registr ies and databases, in order to obtain updated con tact information. If after all attempts, 
the subject remains lost to fo llow-up, then the last known aliv e date as determined by the

An investigational product, als o known as investigational medic inal product in some regions, is 
defined as a pharmaceut ical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a 
reference in a clinical study, including products already with a marketing authorization but used 
or assembled (formulated or packaged) differently than the auth orized form, or used for an 
unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further informati on about the authorized form.
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area a ccording to local regulations. It is 
the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that investiga tional product is only dispensed to 
study participants. The investigational product must be dispens ed only from official study sites by 
authorized personnel according to local regulations. 
•Carboplatin
•Cetuximab
•Cisplatin
•Fluorouracil
•Ipilimumab
•Nivolumab
4.2 Non-investigational Product

4.4 Method of Assigning Participant Identification
After the participant’s initial eligibility is established and informed consent has been obtained, the 
participant must be enrolled into the study by IVRS to obtain th e participant number. Every 
participant that signs the informed consent form must be assigned  a participant number in IVRS. 
Specific instructions for using IVRS w ill be provided to the investigational site in a separate 
document. The investigator or designee will register the partic ipant for enrollment by following 
the enrollment procedures established by BMS. The following info rmation is required for 
enrollment:
•Date that informed consent was obtained
•Date of birth
•Gender at birth
Once enrolled in IVRS, enrolled participants that have met all eligibility criteria will be ready to 
be randomized th rough IVRS. Tumor cell PD-L1 e xpression data and HPV p-16 w ill be transferred 
directly from analyzing lab to IVRS (or the local HPV p-16 resul t, if available, can be entered by 
site directly into IVRS  for the oropharyngeal cancer p atients during the randomization call). The 
following information is required for participant randomization:•Participant number
•Date of birth
•HPV p-16 status (oropharyngeal HPV p-16 positive vs oropharyngea l HPV p-16 negative or 
non-oropharyngeal) - Oropharyngeal CA sites defined in Appendix 5
•Tumor cell PD-L1 expression status: ( ≥1% vs < 1% or not evaluable)
•Prior chemotherapy (adjuvant/neoadjuvant/multimodal) status (Yes vs No)
Participants meeting all eligib ility criteria will be stratified by tumor cell PD-L1 status (expressing
[≥1%, non-expressing [< 1%] or non-evaluable), HPV p-16 status (or opharyngeal HPV p-16 
positive versus oropharyngeal HPV p-16 negative or non-oropharyngeal) and prior chemotherapy 
status (Yes or No). 
The exact procedures for using the IVRS will be detailed in the IVRS manual.
4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each ParticipantThe dosing schedule is detailed below in Table 4.5-1.
All participants will be monitored continuously for A Es while on study treatment. Treatment 
modifications (e g, dose delay, reduction, retreatment, or discontinuation) will be based on specific 
laboratory and adverse event criteria, as described in Sections 4.5.2 , 4.5.3, 4.5.4, and 4.5.5 .

4.5.1 Dosing 
4.5.1.1 Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab (Arm A)Participants randomized to Arm A will receive treatment with ni volumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks 
as a 30-minute infusion and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every  6 weeks as a 30-minute i nfusio n, starting 
on Day 1, until progression, unacceptable tox icity, withdrawal of consent, the study ends, or a 
maximum of 24 months from the first study tr eatment, whicheve r occurs first.
When nivolumab and ipilimumab are to be administered on the sam e day, separate infusion bags 
and filters must be used for each infusion. Nivolumab is to be administered first. The second 
infusion will always be ipilimumab and will start  no sooner than 30 minutes after completion of 
the nivolumab infusion. Participants who require small volumes may infuse over < 30 minutes but 
no less than 20 minutes. The second infusion will always be the ipilimumab study t reatment and 
will start after the infusion line has been flushed, filters cha nged and participant has been observed 
to ensure no infusion reaction has occurred.
Nivolumab and ipilimumab may be diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Solution or 5% Dextrose 
solution. 
Dosing calculations should be based on the body weight. If the participant’s weight on the day of 
dosing differs by > 10% from the weight used to calculate the p rior dose, the dose must be 
recalculated. All doses should be rounded to the nearest milligram. There will be no dose 
modifications allowed for both nivolumab and ipilimumab.Participants may be dosed with nivolumab no less than 12 days f rom the previous dose. There are 
no premedications recommended for the first dose of study drug.
Participants should be carefully monitored for infusion reactio ns during nivolumab a dministration. 
If an acute infusion reaction is noted, participants should be managed according to Section 4.5.8
Doses of nivolumab may be interrupted, delayed, or discontinued  depending on how well the 
participant tolerates the treatment. Dosing visits are not skip ped, only delayed.
Nivolumab Injection, 100 mg/10 mL (10 mg/mL) is to be administe red as an IV infusion through 
a 0.2-micron to 1.2-micron pore size, low-protein binding in-li ne filter at the protocol-specified 
doses. It is not to be administered as an IV push or bolus inje ction. When the dose is based on 
patient weight (ie, mg/kg), nivolumab injection can be infused undiluted (10 mg/mL) or diluted 
with 0.9% Sodium Chloride In jection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injecti on, USP to protein 
concentrations as low as 0.35 mg/mL. When the dose is fixed (eg, 240 mg flat dose), nivolumab 
injection can be infused undiluted or diluted so as not to exce ed a total infusion volume of 120 
mL. Nivolumab infusion must be promptly followed by flush of diluent to clear the line. 
Instructions for dilution and infusion of nivolumab injection m ay be provided in the clinical 
protocol, pharmacy binder, or pharmacy reference sheet. Care mu st be taken to assure sterility of 
the prepared solution as the product does not contain any antim icrobial preservative or 
bacteriostatic agent. 
Nivolumab infusions are compatible with polyvinyl chloride (PVC ) or polyolefin containers and 
infusion sets, and glass bottles.

temperature/room light (RT/RL). For ipilimumab storage instruct ions, refer to ipilimumab IB 
and/or pharmacy reference sheets.
Separate infusion bags and filters should be used when administ ering nivoluma b and ipilimumab 
on the same day.Ipilimumab is to be administered  as a 30 minute IV infusion and may be infused using a volu metric 
pump with a 0.2 to 1.2 micron low-protein binding in-line filte r at the protocol-specified dose. The 
drug can be diluted with 0.9% normal saline or 5% Dextrose Inje ction to concentrations between 
1 mg/mL and 4 mg/mL. It is not to be administered as an IV push  or bolus in jections. Care must 
be taken to assure sterility of the prepared solutions, since t he drug product does not  contain any 
antimicrobial preservatives or bacteriostatic agents. At the en d of the infusion, flush the line with 
a sufficient quantity of diluent.Doses of nivolumab and/or ipilimumab may be interrupted, delaye d, or discontinued depending 
on how well the participant toler ates the treatment. F or more details, see Section 4.5.2 (dose 
delays), 4.5.4 (resuming treatment), and  4.5.5 (discontinuation).
4.5.1.2 EXTREME Regimen (Arm B)
Participants randomized to Arm B will receive treatment with an initial dose of cetuximab 
400 mg/m
2(over 2 hours i nfusion) then weekly 250 mg/m2(over 1 hour i nfusion) (or every 2 
weeks, per local prescribing i nformation), cis platin (100 mg/m2IV on Day 1) or carboplatin (AUC 
5 IV on Day 1) and 5-FU (1000 mg/m2continuous IV from Day 1 to Day 4) every 3 weeks per 
cycle for a maximum of 6 cycles. 
Cetuximab maintenance begins after 6 cycles of the cetuximab, c isplatin or carboplatin, and 5-FU 
are complete and is considered cetuximab alone at 250 mg/m2weekly (1 hour i nfusion). 
Cetuximab maintenance can continue until progression, unacceptab le toxicity, withdrawal of 
consent, or other reason (see Section 3.5 for complete list of reasons for discontinuing study 
medication). The dosing calculations should be based on the body weight. If the participant’s weight on the day 
of dosing differs by > 10% from the weight used t o calculate the dose, the dose must be 
recalculated. Doses can be rounded per institutional standards.  Participants may be dosed no less 
than 7 days between doses.The dose of Carboplatin during chemotherapy will be calculated using the following form ula
(Calvert equation):
•Carboplatin total dose in mg = AUC x (glomerular filtration rat e [GFR] +25)
NOTE: When calculating carboplatin dose, GFR should not ex ceed 125 mL/min. Thus, the 
maximum carboplatin dose for AUC of 5 will be 750 mg.

The actual weight will be used for the calculation of Creatinin e Clearance.
If one of the st udy drugs is discontinued, the other study drug s may be continued for the remainder 
of the cycles.
Premedications
For cetuximab : 
The recommended premedication is with an H1 antagonist (eg, 50mg  Diphenhydramine) IV 
30-60 minutes prior to the first dose; for subsequent doses, pre medication should be administered 
based upon clinical judgement and presence/severity o f prior i nfusion reactions in accordance with 
local institutional standard practice.
For carboplatin or cisplatin:The recommended premedication are dexamethasone (dosing accordin g to local standard; an 
equivalent dose of another corticosteroids may be substituted) and a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist 
(type per investigator discretion and local standards of care) prior to each dose. Additional use of 
emetics premedication may be employed at the discretion of the investigator. Refer to the local 
product label for more detail.For cisplatin: 
Hydration guidelines may be modified at the discretion of the t reating physician provided adequate 
pre- and post-cisplatin hydration is achieved, and renal functio n remains adequate. One suggested 
regimen consists of administeri ng cisplatin in 500 cc to 1000 c c of IV fluids following adequate 
hydration and the establishment of adequate urinary output. It is suggested the pre-cisplatin 
hydration consist of NS at 500 cc/hr x 1 liter and post-cisplat in hydration consist of 1/2 NS + 
10 meq KCl/liter + 1 gram magnesium sulfate/liter + 25 grams man nitol/liter at 500 cc/hr for at 
least one hour, followed by a dditional hydration at the discret ion of the investigator.
It is suggested that patients receive antie metic therapy, acute and delayed, including 
dexamethasone, 5-HT3 serotonin receptor antagonists. However, t he specifics of the regimen are 
at the discretion of the tr eating physicia n, provided adequate control is achieved. One potential 
regimen consists of 20 mg of oral or IV dexamethasone and a hig h dose of oral or IV 5-HT3 
antagonist (such as 2 mg oral or 10 mg/kg IV granisetron, or 32 mg oral or IV ondansetron) on the day of cisplatin administration. Followed by additional anti-em etics consisting of oral 
dexamethasone and scheduled 5-HT3 serotonin receptor antagonist s on days 2-5. For example, 
8 mg orally, twice daily for days 2 and 3, and then 4 mg orally,  twice daily for days 4 and 5, 
especially if aprepitant is not given.

All supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care should be used throughout the study. 
Recombinant erythropoietin or s imilar com pound may be administered for symptomatic and/or 
progressive > Grade 2 anemia. Agents such as G-CSF may also be used at the investigators’ 
discretion.
The use of cisplatin or carboplatin is at the discretion on the  investigator. Switch from cisplatin to 
carboplatin is allowed. If patients develop specific intolerabl e cisplatin-associated toxicities (see 
dose modifications, carboplatin substitution), such as neuropathy, renal impairment, ototoxicity, 
or nausea/vomiting, carboplatin at an AUC of 5 will be substitu ted for cisplatin.
Doses of cetuximab, cisplatin or carboplatin and 5-FU (EXTREME r egimen) may be interrupted, 
delayed, reduced or disc ontinued depending on how well the participant toler ates the treatment. 
For more details, see Sections 4.5.2 (dos e delays), 4.5.3 (dose reductions), 4.5.4 (resuming

4.5.2 Dose Delays
Recommendations for dose modifications for EXTREME regimen shou ld be considered with lo cal 
institutional standards.
4.5.2.1 Nivolumab and Ipilimumab (Arm A)
Dose delay criteria apply for all drug-related AEs. Treatment d elay is up to 6 weeks for nivolumab 
and up to 12 weeks for ipilimumab from the last dose are allowa ble (any dose delays greater than 
these will require approval from the medical monit or). It is  permissible in cases of a dose held due 
to AE to skip the dose in the  cycle in order t o bring the patient back on track with the next Cycle 
visit.
Tumor assessments for all participants should continue as per p rotocol even if dosing is delayed.
Nivolumab and ipilimumab administration should be delayed for t he following:
•Grade 2 non-skin, drug-related AE, with the exception of fatigu e
•Grade 2 drug-related creatinine, AST, ALT and/or Total Bilirubi n abnormalities
•Grade 3 skin, drug-related AE
•Grade 3 drug-related laboratory abnormality, with the following  exceptions: 
−Grade 3 lymphopenia or asymptomatic amylase or lipase does not  require dose delay
−Grade ≥3 AST, ALT, Total Bilirubin will require dose discontinu ation (see section 4.5.5)
•Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or interc urrent illness w hich, in the judgment of 
the investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medicatio n.
•Participants receiving ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab  that have drug-relate d 
toxicities that meet the criter ia for dose delay, should have b oth drugs (ipilimumab and 
nivolumab) delayed until retreatment criteria are met. (Excepti ons apply to the retreatment 
criteria after dose delay of ip ilimumab and nivolumab for Grade ≤ 3 amylase and lipase

abnormalities that are not associated with symptoms or clinical  manifestations of pancreatitis 
and that are attributed to ipilimumab alone.)
•Participants who require delay of nivolumab should be re-evalua ted weekly or more frequently 
if clinically indicated and resume nivolumab dosing when re-tre atment criteria are met.
Rescheduling:
•Nivolumab may be delayed until the next planned ipilimumab dose  if the next ipilimumab dose 
is scheduled within the next 12 days. This will permit periodic ipilimumab dosing to be 
synchronized with nivolumab dosing.
•Ipilimumab s hould be dosed at the sp ecified interval regardless of any delays in intervening 
nivolumab doses. However, in order to maintain periodic synchronized dosi ng of ip ilimumab 
and nivolumab, the dosing days of nivolumab and ipilimumab may be adjusted within the 
permitted ±3 day window, as long as consecutive nivolumab doses are given a t least 12 days 
apart. Ipilimumab may be delayed beyond the 3 day window if need ed to synchronize with the 
next nivolumab dose.
•If an ipilimumab dose is delayed beyond 6 weeks from the prior ipilimumab dose, then 
subsequent ipilimumab doses should be rescheduled to maintain t he 6 week interval between 
consecutive ipilimumab doses. 
•A dose delay of ipilimumab which results in no ipilimumab dosin g for > 12 weeks requires 
ipilimumab discontinuation, with exceptions as noted in Section 4.5.5.2.
For both nivolumab and ipilimumab: A dose given more than 3 days a fter the intended dose date 
will be considered a dose delay. L onger delays may be allowed following discussion with the 
Study Director/Medical Monitor.
4.5.2.2 EXTREME Regimen
It is permissible in cases of a dose held due to AE to skip the  dose in the cycle in order to bring 
the patient back on track with the next Cy cle visit. Cetuxima b, cisplatin, ca rboplatin, and 5-FU
should be delayed for the following:
•Presence of febrile neutropenia or neutropenia < 1500 cells/mm3for greater than one week 
despite the use of Growth factors
•Any Grade ≥2 non-skin, drug-related adverse event, except for alopecia, fa tigue or laboratory 
abnormalities
•Any Grade 3 skin drug-related AE 
•Any Grade 3 drug-related laboratory abnormality, with the follo wing exceptions:
−Grade 3 lymphopenia does not require a dose delay
−Delay if total bilirubin > 1 x ULN or if AST and/or ALT > 1.5 x U LN occurs concomitant 
with alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 x ULN 
•Any AE, laboratory abnormality or inter-current illness which, in the judgment of the 
investigator, warrants skipping the dose of study medication. 
Subsequent dose reductions may be required as per Section 4.5.3.2.  Participants may receive 
growth factors (including G-CSF and eryth ropoieti n) at the discretion of the investigator.

•Participants who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug-related sk in AE may resume treatment 
in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity.
•Participants who received systemic corticosteroids for manageme nt of any drug-related 
toxicity must be off corticosteroids or have tapered down to an equivalent dose of prednisone 
≤10 mg/day.
•For participants with Grade 2 AST, ALT and/or Total Bilirubin A bnormalities, dosing may 
resume when laboratory values return to baseline and management  with corticosteroids, if 
needed, is complete.
•Drug-related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis must have  resolved to baseline before 
treatment is resumed. Participants with persistent Grade 1 pneu monitis after completion of a 
steroid taper over at least 1 month may be eligible for retreat ment if discussed with and 
approved by the BMS Medical Monitor.
Participants with drug-related endocrinopathies adequately cont rolled with only  physiologic 
hormone rep lacement may resume treatment after consultation with the BMS M edical Monitor (or
designee). Adrenal insufficiency  requires discontinuation regar dless of control with hormone 
replacement.
4.5.4.2 Criteria to Resume Ipilimumab Dosing (Arm A)
Participants may resume treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab  when drug-related AE(s) 
resolve(s) to Grade 1 or baseline value, with the following exceptions: 
•Participants may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fa tigue.
•Participants who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug-related sk in AE may resume treatment 
in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity.
•Participants with baseline Grade 1 AST/ALT or total bilirubin w ho require dose delays for 
reasons other than a 2-grade shift in AST/ALT or total bilirubi n may resume treatment in the 
presence of Grade 2 AST/ALT or total bilirubin.
•Participants with combined Grade 2 AST/ALT and total bilirubin values meeting 
discontinuation parameters ( Secti on 4.5.5.2 )s hould have treatment permanently discontinued.
•Drug-related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea , or colitis must have resolved to baseline before 
treatment is resumed.
•Participants who received systemic corticosteroids for manageme nt of any drug-related 
toxicity must be off corticosteroids or have tapered down to an  equivalent dose of prednisone

ipilimumab discontinuation, with exceptions as noted in Section 4.5.5.2.
•Ipilimumab may not be resumed sooner than 6 weeks ( ±3 days) after the prior ipilimumab 
dose.
•In general, participants who meet criteria to resume ipilimumab  will also have met criteria to 
resume nivolumab, so it should be feasible to synchronize dosin g of both drugs when resuming

adjusted within the permitted ±3 day window, as long as consecutive nivolumab doses are 
given at least 12 days apart.
•One exception to note is when ipilimumab and nivolumab doses ar e delayed due to drug-
related Grade ≥3 amylase or lipase abnormalities not associated with symptoms or clinical 
manifestations of pancreatitis. If the investigator assesses th e Grade ≥3 amylase or lipase 
abnormality to be related to ipilimumab and not related to nivo lumab, nivolumab may be 
resumed when the amylase or lipase abnormality resolves to Grad e < 3 but ipilimumab may 
only be resumed when the amylase or lipase abnorm ality resolves to Grade 1 or bas eline. 
Investigator attribution of this toxicity to the ipilimumab dos ing must be clearly noted in the 
participant’s medical chart. The BMS Medical Monitor should be consulted prior to resuming 
nivolumab in such participants.
4.5.4.3 Criteria to Resume Chemotherapy Dosing (Arm B)
Participants may resume treatment with study drug when the drug -related AE(s) resolved or
returned to baseline value, with the following exceptions below .
•Participants may resume treatment in the presence of ANC ≥1500 / mm3 and Platelets ≥100

•Participants with combined Grade 2 AST/ALT AND total bilirubin values meeting 
discontinuation parameters ( Secti on 4.5.5.3 )s h o uld have treatment permanently discontinued.
•Drug-related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea , or c olitis, must have resolved to baseline before 
treatment is resumed.
•For Cetuximab:
−Pulmonary Toxicity: Permanently discontinue for confirmed inter stitial lung disease. 
−Skin Reaction: If a participant experiences a Grade 3 skin react ion, cetuximab therapy is 
to be withheld for up to 2 consecutive infusions; the dose level  should not be changed. The 
investigator can also consider concomitant treatment with topic al and/or oral antibiotics; 
topical corticosteroids are not recommended. If the toxicity re solves to Grade 2 or less 
within 2 weeks, treatment may resume. For repeat occurrences of  a Grade 3 skin reaction, 
see Table 4.5.3.2-1 above.

•Investigator-assessed clinical benefit and no rapid disease pro gression
•Participant is tolerating study treatment
•Stable performance status
•Treatment beyond progression will not d elay an imminent intervention to prevent serious 
complications of disease progression (eg, CNS metastases)
•Participant provides wri tten i nformed consent prior to receiving additional nivolumab and 
ipilimumab tr eatment, using an ICF describing any reasonably foreseeable ris ks or 
discomforts, or other alternative treatment options.
The decision to continue tr eatment be yond initial investigator-assessed progression s hould be 
discussed with the BMS Medical Monitor and documented in the st udy records. A follow-up scan 
should be performed within six (6) weeks ±1 week of original PD to determine whether there has 
been a decrease in the tumor size, or continued progression of disease. Subsequent scans should 
be performed every six (6) weeks ±1 week until further progression is determined. In the event of 
unscheduled scans, efforts should be made to get subsequent scan back on the every six (6) weeks 
±1 week until further progression is determined.
If the investigator feels that the participant continues to achi eve clinical benefit by continuing 
treatment, the par ticipant should remai n on the trial and contin ue to receive monitoring according 
to the Time and Events Schedule in Table 5.1-2.
For the participants who continue study therapy beyond progress ion, further progression is defined 
as an additional 10% increase in tumor burden from time of init ial PD. This includes an increase 
in the sum of diameters of all target lesions and/ or the diame ters of new measurable lesions 
compared to the time of initial PD. Nivolumab and ipilimumab tr eatment should be discontinued 
permanently upon documentation of further progression.
New lesions are considered measureable at th e time of init ial progression if the longest diameter 
is at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which mu st have a short axis of at least 
15 mm). Any new lesion considered non-measureable at the time of  initial progression may 
become measureable and therefore included in the tumor burden if the longest diameter increases 
to at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which mu st have a short axis of at least 
15 mm). In situations where the relative increase in total tumor  burden by 10% is solely due to 
inclusion of new lesions which become measurable, these new les ions must demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
4.5.7 Management Algorithms for Immuno-Oncology Agents
Immuno-oncology (I-O) agents are associated with AEs that can di ffer in severity and duration 
than AEs caused by other therapeutic classes. Nivolumab and ipi limumab are considered immuno-
oncology agents in this protocol. Early recognition and managem ent of AEs associated with 
immuno-oncology agents may mitigate severe toxicity. Management  Algorithms have been 
developed to assist investigators in assessing and managing the  following groups of AEs:

4.5.8 Treatment of Infusion Reactions
4.5.8.1 Nivolumab or Ipilimumab Infusion Reactions 
Since nivolumab and ipilimumab contain only human immunoglobuli n protein sequences, they are 
unlikely to be immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensitiv ity reactions. However, if such a 
reaction were to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, r igors, headache, rash, pruritus, 
arthralgias, hypo- or hypertension, bronchospasm, o r other symptoms. All Grade 3 or 4 i nfusion 
reactions should be reported within 24 hours to the BMS Medical Monitor and reported as an SAE 
if criteria are met. Infusion r eactions should be graded acc ording to NCI CTCAE (Version 4.0) 
guidelines.
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modifie d based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines, as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptoms: (mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated)
•Remain at bedside and monitor participant until recovery from sy mptoms. The following 
prophylactic prem edications are recomme nded for future i nfusions: diphe nhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg  at least 30 minutes before 
additional nivolumab or ipilimumab administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms: (moderate reaction requires therapy or infusion interruption but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihistamines,  non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodil ators, IV fluids]; 
prophylactic medications indicated for ≤≤24 hours)
•Stop the nivolumab or ipilimumab infusion, begin an IV infusion  of normal saline, and treat 
the participant with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) an d/or 
acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor participant until 
resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid and/or bronchodilator th erapy may also be 
administered as appropriate. If the infusion is inte rrupted, then restart the i nfusion at 50% of 
the original infusion rate when symptoms resolve; if no further  complications ensue after 
30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of the original in fusion rate. Monitor participant
closely. If symptoms rec ur, then no further nivolumab or ip ilimumab will be administered at

that visit. Administer diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, and remain at bedside and monitor the 
participant until resolution of symptoms. The am ount of study drug infused must be recorded 
on the electronic case report form (eCRF).
•For future infusions, the following prophylactic premedications are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equiv alent) and/or acetaminophen/para cetamol 325 to 1000 mg 
should be administered at least 30 minutes before nivolumab or ipilimumab infusions. If 
necessary, corticosteroids  (up to 25 m g of SoluCor tef or equiva lent) may be used.
For Grade 3 or 4 symptoms: (severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [ie, not rapidly responsive 
to symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of symptoms 
following initial improvement; hospitalization indicated for other clinical sequelae [eg, renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]. Grade 4: Life threatening; pressor or ventilatory 
support indicated)
•Immediately discontinue infusion o f nivoluma b or ipilimumab. Begin an IV infusion o f normal 
saline and tr eat the participant as follows: Reco mmend bronchodilators, epinephrine 0.2 to 1 
mg of a 1:1000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg o f a 1:10,000 
solution injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhy dramine 50 mg IV with 
methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Partic ipant should be monitored 
until the investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will no t recur. Nivolumab or 
ipilimumab will be permanently discontinued. Investigators shou ld follow their institutional 
guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor participant until 
recovery of the symptoms.
In case of late-occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (eg, appear ance of a localized or generalized 
pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, oral 
antihistamine or corticosteroids).
4.5.8.2 Treatment of Cetuximab Infusion Reactions
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modifie d based on local institutional 
standards, package inserts, and guidelines as appropriate.

Immediately disconti nue infusion of cetuximab and disconnect participant from tubi ng. Begin an 
IV infusion of normal saline, and tr eat the par ticipant as follows. Recommend bronchodilators, 
epinephrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1,000 solution for subcutaneous a dministration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of 
a 1:10,000 solution and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with methyl prednisolone 100 mg IV

must not receive any further cet uximab treatment.  Participant sh ould be monitored until the 
investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. C etuximab will be permanently 
discontinued. 
Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain 
at bedside and monitor participant until recovery from symptoms.  In the case of late-occurring 
hypersensitivity symptoms (eg, appearance of a localized or gen eralized pruritus within 1 week 
after treatment), symptomatic t reatment may be given (eg, oral a ntihistamine, or corticosteroids).
Once the cetuximab infusion rate has been decreased due to an a llergic/hypersensitivity reaction, 
it will r emain decreased for all subsequent infusions. If the participant has a sec ond 
allergic/hypersensitivity reaction with the slower infusion rate, the infusion should be stopped and 
cetuximab treatment should be discontinued. If there is any que stion as to whether an observed 
reaction is an allergic/hypersensitivity reaction of Grade 1 - 4, the sponsor should be contacted

Participants will be evaluated for safety if they have received any study drug. Toxicity  assessments 
will be continuous during the tr eatment phase. During the safety follow-up phase ( Table 5.1-3 ),
toxicity assessments should be done in person. Once participant s reach the survival follow-u p 
phase either in person or docu mented telephone calls to assess the participant ’s status ar e 
acceptable. 
Adverse events and laboratory values will be graded according t o the NCI-CTCAE version 4.0.
On-study weight, ECOG performance status, and vital signs should  be assessed at each on-study 
visit prior to dosing. Vital signs should also be taken as per institutional standard of care prior to, 
during, and after infusions. The start and stop time of the stud y therapy infusions s hould be 
documented.
Physical examinations are to be performed as clinically indicat ed. If there are any new or 
worsening clinically significant changes since the last exam, r eport changes on the appropriate 
non-serious or serious adverse event page.
Additional measures, including non-study required laboratory te sts, should be performed as 
clinically ind icated or to comply with local regu lations. Laboratory toxicities (eg, suspected drug 
induced liver enzyme evaluations) will be monitored during the f ollow-up phase via on si te/local 
labs until all study drug related toxicities resolve, return to  baseline, or are deemed irreversible.
Some of the assessments referred to in this section may not be captured as data in the eCRF. They

extension up to 72 hours prior to start of study drug may be permissible in situations where results 
cannot be obtained within the standard 24 hour window. This is pa rticipant to medical monitor 
approval.
5.3.3 Thyroid Function Testing
Local thyroid fun ction testing will be performed as outlined in Section 5.1.
At Screening, thyroid function testing is to include TS H, free T3 and free T4. At subsequent time 
points, thyroid function tes ting consists of TSH only. However, if the TSH is abnor mal, reflexive 
testing of free T3 and free T4 are to be performed. 
Management algorithms for suspected endocrinopathy adverse events (including abnormal thyroid 
function) can be found in the nivolumab investigator brochure a nd Appendix 2 of the protocol.
5.3.4 Electrocardiogram (ECG)
All participants who have met the eligibility criteria are requ ired to have a 12-lead ECG performed 
during Screening. If clinically indicated, additional ECGs may be obtained during the study.
5.4 Efficacy Assessments
Study radiologic tumor evaluations will take place in accordanc e with Time and Events tables in 
Section 5.1 and according to RECIST 1.1 Appendix 3 .
Sites will be trained prior to scanning the first study partici pant. Image acquisi tion guidelines and 
submission process will be outlined in the study Imaging Manual  to be provided by the radiology 
vendor. Images will be submitted to an imaging third-party radi ology vendor for central review as 
they are performed on an ongoing basis.
Screening (baseline) tumor assessments are to be performed prior  to first dose. In addition to the 
brain/head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, all known sites of di sease should be assessed at baseline. 
Subsequent assessments should include brain (only if brain meta stases are detected at screening, 
or if clinically indicated during the course of the trial), nec k, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and all known 
/ suspected sites of disease using the same imaging method and technique as was used at baseline.
A Screening MRI of the brain without and with Gadolinium contra st, including base of skull 
involvement, is preferred but CT scan is acceptable for all part icipants, in order to rule out active 
metastases. A CT of the head (wit h and without contrast) to be p erformed if MRI is contraindicated 
or unavailable. 
Radiographic tumor response will be assessed at Week 6 ( ±1 week) from first dose date, then 
every 6 weeks ( ±1 week) for the f irst 12 months  (until week 48) and e very 12 weeks ( ±1 week) 
thereafter, until disease progression is documented or treatmen t is discontinued (whichever occurs 
later). Previously treated CNS metastases are not considered me asurable lesions for purposes of 
RECIST determined response. MRI of  the brain (without AND with G adolinium contrast) is 
required for participants with a history of brain metastasis. S urveillance scans should be performed 
approximately every 12 weeks, or sooner if clinically indicated  (CT of the head without AND with 
contrast may be performed if MRI is contraindicated).

CT with PO and IV contrast or contrast-enhanced MRI are the pre ferred imaging modalities for 
assessing radiographic tumor response. If a participant has a kn own allergy to contrast material,
local prophylaxis standards may be used to obtain the assessmen t with contrast if at all possible, 
or use the alternate mod ality. In cases where contrast is strictly contraind icated, a non-contrast 
scan will suffice. Should a participant have a contraindication for CT IV contrast, contrast-
enhanced MRI of the head, neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis may b e obtained. Every a ttempt 
should be made to image each participant using the same image modality, acquisitio n protocol,
and same scanner for all imaging time points.
Use of CT component of a PET/CT scanner: Combined modality scan ning such as with 
FDG-PET/CT is increasingly used in clinical care, and is a moda lity/technology that is in rapid 
evolution; therefore, the recommendations outlined here may cha nge rather quickly with time. At 
present, low dose or attenuation correction CT portions of a co mbined FDG-PET/CT are of limited 
use in anatomically based efficacy assessments, and it is theref ore suggested that they should not 
be substituted for dedicated diagnostic contrast enhanced CT scans for anatomically based 
RECIST measurements. However, if a site can document that the C T performed as part of a 
FDG-PET/CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic C T (with IV and oral contrast) then 
the CT portion of the FDG-PET/CT can be used for RECIST 1.1 mea surements. Note, however, 
that the FDG-PET porti on of the CT  introduces additional data w hich may bias an investigator if 
it is not routin ely or serially performed.
Bone scan or PET scan is not adequate for assessment of RECIST 1.1 response in target lesions. 
In selected circumstances where such modalities are the sole mo dality used to assess cer tain 
non-target organs, those non-target organs may be evaluated les s frequently. For example, bone 
scans may need to be repeated only when complete response is identified in target disease or when 
progression in bone is suspected.
Tumor assessments for all par ticipants should continue as per protocol even if dosing is del ayed 
or discontinued. Tumor measurements should be made by the same investigator or radiologist for 
each assessment whenever possible. Change in tumor measurements and tumor response to guide 
ongoing study treatment decisions will be assessed by the Inves tigator using the RECIST 1.1 
criteria ( Appendix 3 ).
All radiographic assessments performed for study purposes w ill be submitted to the third-party 
radiology vendor for central review. Tumor assessments should b e submitted to the third-party 
radiology vendor as they are performed on an ongoing basis.
At the time of investigator-assessed off-treatment disease prog ression, the site must complete the

5.4.1 Primary Efficacy Assessment
The primary endpoints are OS in participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 2 0 and all randomized
participants. See Section 8.3.1 for the definitions of OS. Every effort will be made to co llect 
survival data on all participants including par ticipants withdrawn from treatment for any reason, 
who are eligible to participate in the study and who have not w ithdrawn consent for survival data 
collection. If the death of a participant is not reported, all dates in this study representing a date of 
participant contact will be used in determination of the partici pant’s last known date alive.
5.4.2 Secondary Efficacy Assessment
Secondary efficacy endpoints include OS in selected subgroups an d ORR in participants with PD-
L1 CPS ≥ 20 and in all randomized participants. See Section 8.3.2 for the definition of ORR. All 
randomized participants will be monitore d by radiographic assessment every 6 weeks ( ±1 week) 
for the first 12 months (until Week 48) and every 12 weeks ( ±1 week) until progression or 
treatment is discontinued, whichever occurs later, [beginning fr om the first on-study assessment 
on Week 6 ( ±1 week)], to determine changes in tumor size. RECIST 1.1 criteri a will be used for 
the assessment.
The assessments of progression from the blinded independent cen tral review (BICR) will be used 
for the principal analyses of PFS.
The assessments of best overall response from the blinded indep endent central review (BICR) will 
be used for the principal analys es of ORR. For details regardin g response criteria using RECIST 
1.1 refer to Appendix 3 .
5.5 Pharmacokinetic Assessments
Samples for PK and immunogenicity assessments will be collected  for all participants r eceiving 
nivolumab and ipilimumab as described in  Table 5.5-1.  All time points are relative to the start of 
study drug administration. All on-treatment time points are int ended to align with days on which 
study drug is administered, if dosing occurs on a different day , the PK and immunogenicity 
sampling should be adjusted acc ordingly. Further details of s ample collection, processing, and  
shipment will be provided in the laboratory procedures manual.
Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity Collection and  Processing 
A detailed schedule of PK and immunogenicity evaluatio ns is provided in Table 5.5-1. PK samples 
will be analyzed f or nivolumab/ipilimumab by a validate d ligand binding assay. Immunogenicity 
samples will be analyzed for anti-nivolumab antibodies / anti-ipilimumab antibodies by a validated 
immunogenicity assay; samples may also be analyzed f or neutralizing antibodies by a validated 
method. Serum samples may be analyzed by an exploratory method that measures anti-drug 
antibodies for technology exploration purposes; exploratory res ults will not be re ported. Serum 
samples designated for PK or biomarker assessments may also be used for immunogenicity 
analysis if required (eg, insufficient volume for complete immu nogenicity assessment or to follow 
up on suspected immunogenicity related AE).

5.6 Biomarker Assessments
A variety of factors that could potentially predict clinical re sponse t o nivolumab in combination 
with ipilimumab  will be investigated in peripheral blood a nd in tumor specimens taken fro m all 
participants prior to- and on-treatment and as outlined  in Table 5.6-1. Data from these 
investigations will be evalu ated for associations with respo nse, survival (OS, PFS) and/or s afety 
(adverse event) data. In addition, analyses of markers betwe en the treatment arms will provid e the 
necessary data to identify and validate biomarkers with predictive vs. prognostic value . All 
samples collected may also be used for future explorator y analyses (unless restricted by local 
requirements) to assess biomarkers associated with SCCHN or imm unotherapy tr eatment. 
Complete instru ctions on the collection, processing, handling a nd shipment of all samples 
described herein will be provided in a separate procedure manua l.

aPlasma, serum and whole blood should be collected on all patients on study, includi ng active and newly enrolled 
patients.
bAll tumor samples may be obtained ±7 days of the indicated time.
c Tumor sample prior to therapy is mandatory. If a recent tumor sample (obtained within 6 months of enrollment) is 
not available at screening, a fresh biopsy will be taken at any  point prior to randomization obtained from core 
biopsy, punch biopsy, excisional biopsy or surgical specimen
dThe Biomarker week collections correspond to the following Cycl e visits: W3D1 corresponds to C1D15 for 
treatment Arms A and B (in cases of no dose delays) W7D1 corres ponds to C2D1 for Arm A and C3D1 for Arm B 
(in cases of no dose delays). W15D1 corresponds to C3D15 for Arm A and C5D15 for Arm B (in cases of no dose 
delays). Bl ood samples can follow Cy cle visits in cases of dose d elays, however the Week 7 biopsy s hould be 
collected at week 7 irrespective of dosing delays.
eWeek 7 ( ±7days) Biopsy is optional. If progression occurs within 6 month s from first dose and a week 7 biopsy 
was done, then biopsy samples upon progression ( ±7 days) are optional. If progression occurs at greater than 6 
months from first dose then progression biopsy is required. On study biopsies should be done if deemed medically 
safe per investigators judgement.
fFor samples at progression, the timing of this co llection should be a fter the par ticipant has come off study medication 
and before they have started new therapy (subsequent anti-cance r therapy). For participants that have consented to 
be treated beyond progression, it is better to wait to perform the biopsy after further progression of the disease, after 
they have come off study therapy and before they have started n ew therapy (subsequent anti-cancer therapy).

5.6.1 Exploratory Serum Biomarkers
Blood samples  for exploratory serum biomarker analyses will be drawn at the time points indicated 
inTable 5.6-1.  Samples may be assessed by ELISA, seromics and/or other releva nt 
multiplex-based protein assay methods for immune or SCCHN-relat ed factors that may predict 
benefit or c orrelate with efficacy to study tr eatment. These f actors may include levels of soluble 
PD-L1, anti-tumor antibodies, cytokines, chemokines, inflammato ry factors and/or microRNAs 
(such as, but not limited to, soluble CD25, soluble PD-1, solubl e LAG-3, and CXCL-9).
5.6.2 Circulating Tumor DNA in PlasmaCirculating tumor DNA (ctDNA) may be extracted to assess tumor mutation burden or other 
mutations in the blood. Additional use of these data may include  correlative analyses aimed at 
identifying genotypic associatio ns with clinically-relevant bio markers identified by other 
methodologies described in this section. 
5.6.3 Tumor Tissue Specimens
Screening Biopsies:
The screening tumor biopsy tissue needs to be shipped and to the c entral laboratory prior to 
randomization for tumor cell PD-L1 and HPV p-16 testing (if needed). Two FFPE blocks or 25 
slides should be  submitted. Con tact the Study Director if suff icient tissue is not available. In the
event the tumor sample is deemed unevaluable due to insufficien t tumor content, the medical 
monitor may request the site to send another specimen, if availa ble. The presence of either an 
archival or a fresh biopsy specimen is an inclusion criterion and hence a prerequisite for full 
eligibility of a participant.
An archived biopsy prior to therapy is acceptable if the fresh biopsy cannot be obtained and if the 
archived tissue meets the defined criteria as stated below.
•Obtained in the metastatic setting or from an unresectable site of disease ob tained within 
6 months of enrollment
•An archived biopsy (block or slides) must contain tumor tissue.
•The patient has not received systemic therapy subsequent to arc hived biopsy and prior to 
screening.
•If an archived block is not available, 25 slides containing tum or are available for exploratory 
use.
Biopsy at 7 weeks:
An on-treatment tumor biopsy to be collected at Week 7 ( ±7 days) is optional but strongly 
encouraged. This time point coincides with the completion  of the first full cycle of n ivolumab + 
ipilimumab tr eatment combination and also with the first on-treatment tumor assessment. 
Pharmacodynamic changes within  candidate biomarkers (s ee Section 5.6.1) within th e tumor and 
tumor microenvironment may inform on mechanism(s) associated with rapid prog ression (ie,
intrinsic resistance) as well as inform on mechanism(s) a ssociated with disease co ntrol. Those

biomarkers will be evaluated for their potential utility as ear ly response/non-response prediction 
biomarkers.
Biopsy at time of Progression:
Changes in biomarkers (including but not limited to genomic alte rations, gene expression, and 
protein expression) in the tumo r biopsy collected at progression  will be evaluated for their utility 
in informing the mechanism(s) underlying acquired resistance to  nivolumab + ipilimumab 
combination treatment. For the biopsy at progression, the biopsy  should be after the participant
has come off study medication and before they have started new therapy (subsequent anti-cancer 
therapy).Tumor sample collection details
A minimum of 2 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tis sue block (preferred) OR a 
minimum of 25 unstained sections are required for assessment of tumor cell PD-L1 status and 
other biomarker evaluations. Specimens should contain a minimum of 100 evaluable tumor cells.
Tissue Biomarkers:
Tumor samples may be asse ssed for global gene expression , global  protein expression, and/or for 
tumor mutation burden using a variety of methodologies inclusiv e of, but not limited to RNA seq 
(or similar), mass-spectrometry, whole exome sequencing and fluo rescent in-situ hybridization 
(FISH).
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) may be used to assess the number and  composition of immune 
infiltrates in order to define the immune cell subsets present within formalin-fixed, 
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue before and after exposure  to therapy. These IHC analyses 
will include, but not necessarily be limited t o, the following markers: CD4, CD8, FOXp3, PD-1, 
PD-L1, and PD-L2. HLA and antigen loss variants may be investig ated in tumor tissues, focused 
on HLA class I, antigen processing machinery (APM) components, and expression of common 
SCCHN tumor antigens including but not limited to HPV oncogenes , EGFR, p53, etc. In cases 
where fresh tumor is available prior to therapy and/or on treatment, separation and isolation of TIL 
from tumor and stromal cells may be performed. Isolated TIL may  be utilized to assess the gene 
expression, phenotype, and function of immune cells.
The investigator, in consultation with the radiology staff, mus t determine the degree of risk 
associated with the procedure and find it acceptable. Biopsies may be done with local anesthesia 
or conscious sedation. Institutional guidelines for the safe pe rformance of biopsies should be 
followed. Excisional biopsies may be performed to obtain tumor biopsy samples. Invasive 
procedures that require general anesthesia should not be perfor med to obtain a biopsy specimen. 
However, if a surgical procedure  is performed f or a clinical in dication, excess tumor tissue may 
be used for research purposes with the consent of the participa nt.
5.6.4 Peripheral Blood Gene Expression
Gene expression analyses from whole bl ood may provide important information on the broad 
effects of nivolumab on immune modulation. Thus, genomic expres sion patterns of whole blood

collected at baseline and during on-study treatment as specifie d inTable 5.6-1 may be assessed by 
global gene expression profiling using a platform such as, but not limited to RNA seq. 
5.6.5 T cell Repertoire Analysis (Whole Blood and Tumor Tissue Sample)
A standing theory in immuno-oncology therapy suggests that a di verse and activated immune 
environment is better adept at eradicating tumor compared to a skewed repertoire of naïve and 
tolerized T cells. In order to explore whether a diverse T cell repertoire is pred ictive of response 
to therapy, next generation, high-throughput, DNA sequencing wi ll be performed on DNA isolated 
from peripheral blood and from t umor tissue to quantitate the T -cell r eceptor repertoire pri or to, 
and on-treatment.
5.6.6 Characterization of Oral Microbiome
The oral microflora of an individual can harbor up to 750 disti nct bacterial species. Certain species 
may induce chronic i nflammation or lead to the presence of alco hol or tobacco-related 
carcinogens. The association of  clinical outcomes to nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab 
with the composition of oral m icroflora is uncharacterized. In order to better understand whether 
components of the oral microbi ome are associated with drug trea tments or disease progression, 
saliva will be taken prior to therapy and prior to the Week 7 d ose for preparation of DNA. 
Pyrosequencing, or a similar technique, will be performed to ch aracterize oral microflora prior to 
and post treatment.
5.6.7 Whole Blood for Genomic Analyses
Whole blood samples for exploratory pharmacogenetic assessment will be collected from all 
participants (unless restricted by local regulations) and put i n frozen storage. Genomic DNA will 
be extracted and subsequently assessed for single nucleotide po lymorphisms (SNPs) and other 
genetic variations in candidate genes that may predispose parti cipants to clinical benefit or adverse 
events (unless restricted by lo cal requirements.) Such genes ma y include, but are not limited to,
the PD-1 axis as well as to other genes related to immune funct ion. Additional use of these data 
may include correlative analyses aimed at identifying genotypic  associations with clinically-
relevant biomarkers identified by other methodologies described  in this section. Additionally, 
genomic DNA from whole blood will be co llected and may be used as a comp arator for par ticipants 
with tumors examine d by whole exome fo r tumor m utation burden a nalyses. 
5.6.8 HPV AssessmentTumor p-16 status is an established clinical surrogate of tumor  HPV status, which is a stratification 
factor in this study (positive/negative status required only fo r oropharyngeal CA). Evaluation of 
tumor p-16 s tatus may be performed locally, but the assay is to be performe d by use of a mouse 
monoclonal antibody to p-16 (CINtec E6H4, MTM Laboratories, Hei delberg, Germany) 
visualized with the Ventana XT.
54Determination of p-16 status by PCR or ISH is also acceptable.
If documentation of p- 16 expression status as per inclusion criterion 2f (local HPV p-16 result) is 
not available, then a sample needs to be sent to the central la boratory for analysis to ensure full 
eligibility. Tissue requirements for the central laboratory are  either tissue on microscopic slides,

5.7 Outcomes Research Assessments
The evaluation of health-related qu ality of life is an increasingly important aspect of clinical 
efficacy in oncology trials. Such data provide an understanding  of the impact of treatment from 
the patient’s perspective and offer insights into patient exper ience that may not be captured th rough 
physician re porti ng. Additionally, gener ic health-related quality of life measur es provide data 
needed for calculating utility valu es to inform health economic models. 
Participants will be asked to comp lete the EQ-5D-3L and FACT-H&N before any clinical 
activities are performed during on-study clinic visits and at f ollow up visits 1 and 2. In addition, 
the EQ-5D and FHNSI-10 will be completed at designated time poin ts during the survival follow-
up phase. The questionnaires will be provided in the participan t’s preferred language if available 
and may be administered by telephone during the survival follow -up phase. A standardized script 
will be used to facilitate telephone administration of the EQ-5 D. A similar script does not exist for 
the FHNSI-10, though participants will be  provided with a hard copy of the questionnaire to take 
home and use as a visual aid during telephone interviews. Partic ipants not able to vocalize 
responses over the phone will be afforded the  opportunity to complete the questionnaires by pen 
and paper (initialing and dating each page) and return them by mail to the study site. Table 5.1-2
and Table 5.1-3 provide information regarding the timing of participant-reporte d outcomes 
assessments.
The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument used to measure self-reports of health status and 
functioning. The instrument’s descriptive system consists of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, 
usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels, reflecting 
"no health problems," "moderate health problems," and "extreme health problems." A dimension 
for which there are no problems is said to be at level 1, while  a dimension for which there are 
extreme problems is said to be at level 3. Thus, the vectors 111 11 and 33333 represent the best 
health state and the worst health s tate, respectively, desc ribed by the EQ-5D. Altogether, the 
instrument describes 35= 243 health states. Empirically derived weights can be applied  t o  a n  
individual’s responses to the EQ-5D descriptive system to gener ate an index measuring the value 
to society of his or her current health. Such preference-weight ing systems have been developed 
for the UK, US, Spain, German y, and numerous oth er populations.  In addition, the EQ-5D includes 
a VAS that allows respondents to rate their own current health on a 101-point scale ranging from 
“best imaginable” to “worst imagin able” health. The EQ-5D is ava ilable for use in over 
150 languages.
The FACT-H&N questionnaire will be used to assess the effects o f disease symptoms on 
functioning and well-being. As a generic cancer-related core, t he FACT-H&N includes the 27-
item FACT-General (FACT-G) to assess physical well-being (PWB; seven items), social/family 
well-being (SWB; seven items), emotional well-being (EWB; six i tems), and functional well-being 
(FWB; seven items). The FACT-H&N includes a 12-item disease-spe cific Head and Neck Cancer 
(HNC) subscale that assesses concerns related to vocalization, c ommunication, breathing, eating, 
swallowing, appearance, and bother due to adverse events. Ten items included in the PWB, EWB,

FWB, and HNC subscales contribute to the scoring of the FHNSI-1 0, which can be used to provide 
a targeted assessment of the effects of head and neck cancer sy mptoms. Each FACT-H&N item is 
rated on a five-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (v ery much). Scores for the PWB, FWB, 
SWB, and EWB subscales can be combined to produce a FACT-G tota l score, which provides an 
overall indicant of generic quality of life, while the FACT-G a nd HNC subscale scores can be 
combined to produce a total score for the FACT-H&N, which provi des a composite measure of 
general and targeted qu ality of life. A variant of the total score that is often more s ensitive to 
physical and functional outcomes, the Trial Outcome Index (TOI), can be derived by summing 
scores for the PWB, FWB, and HNC subscales. All scores are scaled so that higher values indicate better functioning as well as lower symptom burden. The FACT-H& N is available for use in over 
40 languages.
In addition to the aforementioned participant-reported outcomes , health care resource ut ilization 
data will be collected for all randomized participants using an  internal case report form developed 
for use in previous trials. The form, which is completed by stu dy staff, records information about 
hospital admissions, including number of days spent in various wards and discharge diagnosis, as 
well as non-protoc ol specified visits related to study therapy,  including date of visit, reason for 
visit, and type of visit. The health care resource utilization data will be used to support subsequent 
economic evaluations.
5.8 Additional Research
Additional research collections and retention are mandatory for  all participants, except where 
prohibited by local laws or regulations, ethics committees, or w here a waiver is provided by BMS 
or their designee. This protocol will include residual sample s torage for additional research (AR). 
This collection for additional research is intended to expand t he translational R&D capability at 
Bristol-Myers Squibb, and will s upport as yet undefined research aims that will advance our 
understanding of disease and options for treatment. It may also be used to support health authority 
requests for analysis, and advancement of pharmacodiagnostic development to better target drugs 
to the right patients. This may also include genetic/genomic ex ploration aimed at exploring disease 
pathways, progression, and respons e to treatment, etc. All reques ts for access to samples or data 
for additional research will be vetted through a diverse committee of the study sponsor’s senior 
leaders in Research and Development to ensure the research supp orts appropriate and well-defined 
scientific research activities. Additionally, residual blood an d tissue collection will also be retained 
by the BMS Biorepository in Hopewell, NJ or at a BMS approved third party storage management facility for additional research purposes. Additional research s amples will be retained for 15 years 
or the maximum allowed by applicable law. No additional samplin g is required for residual 
collections. F urther details of sample co llection and processing will be provided to the site in the 
laboratory procedure manual.
6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical c ondition in a clinical i nvestigation participant administered study drug and 
that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be

BMS-936558 nivolumab
any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laborato ry finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associate d with the use of study tr eatment, wh ether or not considered related to 
the study treatment.
The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all 
adverse events (AE). The cau sal relations hip can be one of the f ollowing:
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between stud y drug administration and 
the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship betw een study drug 
administration and the AE.
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is eviden ce to suggest a causal relationship. 
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported  or elicited  during open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a participant. Care should be take n not to introduce bias when 
collecting AE and/or SAEs. Inquiry about specific AEs should be  guided by clinical judgement in 
the context of known adverse events, when appropriate for the program or protocol.
BMS will be reporting adverse events to regulatory authorities and ethics committees according to 
local applicable laws including European Directive 2001/20/EC a nd FDA Code of Federal 
Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
•Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chem istry, or urinalysis) or results 
from other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vit al signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinicall y significant in the medical and 
scientific judgment of the investigator. Note that abnormal lab  tests or other safety assessments 
should only be reported a s AEs if the final diagnosis is not available. Once the final diagnosis 
is known, the reported term should be updated to be the diagnos is.
•Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in 
frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
•New conditions detected or diagnosed after st udy intervention administr ation even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-d rug interaction.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdo se of either study intervention 
or a concomitant medication. Ove rdose, as a verbatim term (as reported by the investigator), 
should not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional  overdose taken with possible 
suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported  regardless of sequelae and 
should specify "intentional overdose" as the verbatim term

Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
•Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): th e condition that leads to the 
procedure is the AE.
•Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience 
admission to a hospital).
Definition of SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot b e an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met.6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
•results in death
•is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypotheticall y might have caused death if it 
were more severe)
•requires inpatient hospitalizati on or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization (see NOTE
below)
•results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
•is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) th at may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based up on appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the participant or may requi re intervention [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in  the definition above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room  or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or co nvulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization.) Potential dr ug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 6.6 for the definition of potential DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic o r nonpathogenic) via the study drug 
is an SAE.
Although pregna ncy, overdose, cancer, a nd potential drug induce d liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by regulatory definition, these events must be h andled as SAEs. (See Section 6.1.1
for reporting pregnancies).Any compone nt of a study endpoint that is considered related to study therapy (eg, d eath is an 
endpoint, if de ath occurred due to anaphylax is, anaphylaxis must be reported) should be reported 
as SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting detail s).

The following hospitalizations are not  considered SAEs in BMS clinical studies: 
−a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not result 
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-th reatening event)
−elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
−admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
−routine h ealth assessment requi ring admission for baseline/trending of h ealth status 
(eg, routine colonoscopy)
−medical/surgical admission other than t o remedy ill health and planne d prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases
−admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status and requires no medical/surgical in tervention (eg, lack of hous ing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason)
−Admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absen ce of any other SAEs 
(applies to oncology protocols)
EVALUATING AES AND SAES
Assessment of Causality
•The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.
•A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relat ionship cannot be ruled out.
•The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the re lationship.
•Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, 
as well as the tem poral relationship of the event to st udy intervention administr ation will be 
considered and investigated.
•The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product Informati on, 
for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
•For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality .
•There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the in vestigator has minimal 
information to include in the init ial re port to Sponsor. However, it is very important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causality for every e vent before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to Sponsor.
•The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in lig ht of follow-up i nformation and 
send a SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessme nt.
The causality assessment is one  of the criteria used when deter mining regulatory reporting 
requirements.

6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Sections 5.6.1 a nd 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) repr esent the Reference Safety 
Information to determine expectedness of serious adverse events  for expedited reporting. 
Following the participant’s written consent to par ticipate in the study, all SAEs, whether related 
or not related to stud y drug, must be co llected, including thos e thought to be associated with 
protocol-specified procedures.
All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening perio d and within 100 days of 
discontinuation of dosing. If applicable, SAEs must be collecte d that relate to any later 
protocol-specified procedure (eg, a follow-up skin biopsy). For  participants randomized/assigned 
to treatment and never treated with st udy drug, SAEs should be collecte d for 30 days from the date 
of randomization/tr eatment assignment.
The investigator must report any SAE that occurs after these ti me periods and that is believed to 
be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure. 
An SAE report must be completed for any event where doubt exist s regarding its seriousness. 
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to stud y drug, but is potentially related to the 
conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complication of a study 
procedure), the relationship must be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.SAEs, whether related or not  related to study d rug, and pregnan cies must be reported to BMS 
(or designee) within 24 hours of awareness of the event. SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report Form; Pregnancies on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form (electronic or pap er forms). 
The required method for SAE data reporting collection is through  the eCRF. 
The paper SAE/pregnancy surveillance forms are only intended as  a back-up option when the 
eCRF system is not functioning. When paper forms are used, the original paper forms are to remain 
on site. In this case, the paper forms are to be transmitted vi a email or c onfirmed facsimile (fax) 
transmission to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact Information list.
SAE Facsimile Number: Refer to Contact Information list.
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC ), electronic submission is the 
required method for reporting. In the event the el ectronic system is unavailable for transmission, 
paper forms must be used and submitted immediately. When paper forms are used, the original 
paper forms are to remain on site.
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy reporting): Refer to Contact 
Information list.

If only limited information is  initially available, follow-up reports are required. (Note: Follow-up 
SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initiall y reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to s tudy drug or if n ew information 
becomes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted  within 24 hours to BMS 
(or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the  initial SAE report.
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.
A SUSAR (Suspected, Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction) is a s ubset of SAEs and will be 
reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities and investig ators following local and global 
guidelines and requirements .
6.2 Nonserious Adverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collection of nonserious A E information should begin at ini tiation of study drug. Nonserious 
AE information should also be collected from the start of a pla cebo lead-in period or other 
observational period intended to establish a baseline status fo r the participants. All nonserious 
adverse events (not only those deemed treatment-related) are to  be collected continuously during 
the treatment period and for a minimum of 100 days following th e last dose of study treatment.
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stab ilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follo w-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or disc ontinuation of study drug and for those present at the end of study treatment as 
appropriate. All identified nonserio us AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious AE 
page of the CRF (paper or electron ic). 
Completion of supplemental CRFs  may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that 
are reported/identified during the course of the study.
6.3 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities
The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be ca ptured on the nonserious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form electronic) as appropriate. Paper forms are only intended as a back-up 
option when the electronic system is not functioning.
•Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or me ets the definition of an SAE 
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the partic ipant to have study drug 
discontinued or interrupted
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the participant to receive specific 
corrective therapy
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by the 
reporting investigator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value) .

6.4 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the study dr ug, it is subsequently discovered that a study participant is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study exposur e, including during at least 
5 half-lives after product adminis tration, the investigator must  immediately notify the BMS 
Medical Monitor/designee of this event and complete and forward  a Pregnancy Surveillance Form 
to BMS Designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE reporting 
procedures described in Section 6.1.1.
In most cases, the study drug will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose 
tapering if necessary for participant safety). Please call the BMS Medical Monitor within 24 hours 
of awareness of the pregnancy.
In the rare event that the benefit of continuing study drug is thought to outweigh the risk, after 
consultation with BMS, the pregnant participant may continue stu dy drug after a thorough 
discussion of benefits and risk with the participant, if allowe d by local regulations.
Protocol-required procedures fo r study disconti nuation and foll ow-up must be performed on the 
participant unless contraindicated by pregnancy (eg, x-ray studi es). Other appropriate pregnancy 
follow-up procedures should be considered if indicated.
The investigator must immediately notify the BMS (or designee) Medical Monit or of t his event 
and complete and forward a Pre gnancy Surveillance Form to BMS ( or designee) within 24 hours 
of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE reporting procedures desc ribed in 
Section 6.1.1. Follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, in cluding perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be re ported on the Pr egnancy 
Surveillance Form.Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant should be re ported to 
BMS. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Fo rm.
6.5 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional adminis tration of any dose of a product that 
is considered both excessive and medically important. Overdose,  as a verbatim term (as reported 
by the investigat or), should not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intent ional overd ose taken 
with possible suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses shou ld be reported regardless of 
sequelae and should specify "intentional overdose" as the verbat im term. 
All instances of accidental overdose and/or dosing errors shoul d be reported on the  Dosage 
Administration Record CRF. (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting detail s.).

6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible, t imely confirmation of initial liver-related  laboratory abnormalities s hould 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occ urrences of potential DILIs, meeting 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as: 
1. AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (UL N)
AND
2. Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without init ial findings of cholestasis ( elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),
AND
3. No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation  and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limi ted to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing ch ronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
6.7 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physica l examinations, electrocardiogram, 
x-ray filming, any other potential safety assessment required o r not required by protocol should 
also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.
6.7.1 Adverse Events of Interest
Definition of immune-mediated adverse events (IMAEs)
Immune-mediated AEs are specific events (that include pneumonit is, diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, 
nephritis/renal dys function, rash, and endocrine [adrenal insufficiency, 
hypothyroidism/thyroiditis, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus,  and hypophysitis]) for which 
participants received immunosuppressive medication for treatmen t of the event, with the exception 
of endocrine events (hypothyroid ism/thyroiditis, hyperthyroidis m, hypophysitis, diabetes mellitus, 
adrenal insufficiency), which are included regardless of treatm ent since these events are often 
managed without immunosuppression.
IMAEs include events, regardless of causality, occurring within 100 days of the last dose.
Table 6.7.1-1 below provides a summary of  the IMAEs category and their respective PTs. This list 
is participant to change based on Health A uthority feedback or change of MedDRA version. The 
final list used will be described in the CSR .

7 DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE AND OTHER EXTERNAL 
COMMITTEES
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC ) will be  utilized to provide general oversight and safety 
considerations for this study. The DMC will provide advice to the Sponsor regarding actions the 
committee deems necessary for the continuing protection of parti cipants enrolled in this study. The 
DMC will be charged with assessing such actions in light of an acceptable risk/benefit profile for 
nivolumab. The DMC will act in an advisory capacity to BMS and will monitor participant safety 
data for the study.
The DMC will be advisory to the clinical study leadership team. The clinical study leadership will 
have responsibility for overall conduct of the study including managing the communication of 
study data. The group will be responsible for promptly reviewin g the DMC recommendations, for 
providing guidance regarding the continuation or termination of  the study, and for determining 
whether amendments to the protocol or changes to the study cond uct are required.
Details of the DMC responsibilities and procedures will be specified in the DMC charter.
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
The primary objectives of this study are to compare OS between treatment groups, in all 
randomized participants and randomized participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20. OS will be compared 
at the 0.025 alpha level for each of the above t wo populations.

Clinical Protocol CA209651
BMS-936558 nivolumab
The OS comparison in all ra ndomized participants w ill require up to 741 d eaths. This number of
events ensures that a two-sided, alpha = 0.025 group sequential t est using the O’Brien and Fleming 
spending function and with an int erim analysis after approximate ly 80% of events will have overall 
97% power for a HR of 1.2 for the first 7 months and 0.55 thereaf ter. 
Delayed separation of KM curves is included in the alternative h ypotheses for OS because it was 
observed in CA 209141, a rando mized phase 3 study of nivolumab v ersus investigator's choice 
therapy in platinum-refractory, recurrent/metastatic SCC HN,35and in KEYNOTE-048, a 
randomized phase 3 study of pembrolizumab or pembroliz umab with chemotherapy versus 
cetuximab with chemotherapy in untreated recurrent/metastatic SC CHN.55
The final analysis of OS in all randomized participants is projected to occur 51 months after the 
first patient was randomized. An  interim analysis in this popul ation will be pe rformed when 
approximately 593 deaths occur, or all randomized participants ha ve been followed up for at least 
12 months, whichever is later. It is projected for 39 months af ter the first patient was randomized.
Power for OS comparisons in randomized participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20
At the same time as the OS analysis is done for all ra ndomized participants, OS will also be 
compared between arms in the randomized participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20 via a two-sided, 
alpha = 0.025 group sequen tial test procedure inco rporating the O’Brien  and Fleming alpha 
spending function. The group sequential test would have an interi m analysis and the final analysis 
of OS, at which approximately 298 and 372 deaths, respectively, are expected. With this many 
events, the test procedure  would have an overall 99% po wer if the HR was 1.06 for the first 7
months and 0.45 thereafter. Table 8.1-1 summarizes the statist ical assumption and power 
calculation.

PFS is defined as the time from randomization to disease progre ssion, using RECIST 1.1 criteria, 
or, if there is no documented progression, death. (The date of progression will be  based on the 
BICR assessment of progression). Participants who neither progr ess nor die will be censored on 
the date of their last tumor assessment. Participants who receiv e subsequent anti-cancer therapy 
prior to documented progression, including tumor-directed radio therapy and tumor-directed 
surgery, will have t heir PFS time cen sored on the date of their  last tumor assessment prior to 
subsequent therapy.
The Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the number of p articipants with a best overall 
response (BOR) of com plete response (CR) or partial response (P R), divided by the number 
randomized in the population.
The BOR is defined as the best response, based on RECIST 1.1 crit eria, recorded between 
randomization and either progression or subsequent anticancer therapy (including tumor-di rected 
radiotherapy and tumor-directed surgery), whichever occurs firs t. (The BOR will be based on 
BICR assessments). For participants without evidence of RECIST 1.1 progre ssion or subsequent 
anticancer therapy, all available tumor evaluations will contribu te to the BOR assessment. 
Duration of objective response ( DOR) is the time between the fi rst documented  response (CR or 
PR) and progression, per RECIST 1.1, or, if no progre ssion is reported, death. The DOR of a 
participant who neither progresses nor dies will be censored as in the primary definition of PFS. 
DOR is calculated on the subset of participants whose best resp onse was either CR or PR, 
according to BICR assessments.
8.3.3 Exploratory Endpoint(s) 
Overall survival (OS)  in randomized participants with tumor cell PD-L 1 < 1%, or PD-L1 CPS of 
< 20, or tumor i nflammation score measure d as GEP ≥ 10, or tumor mutation burden (TMB) ≥ 7
is defined the same way as for the primary endpoints.
PFS, ORR, and DOR in randomized participants with tumor cell PD-L1 <  1%, or CPS of <20, or 
tumor inflammation score measured as GEP ≥ 10, or tumor mutatio n burden (TMB) ≥ 7 is defined 
the same way as for the secondary endpoints.ORR and DOR in subpopulation based on selected biomarkers are defined the same way as in the 
secondary endpoints. Time to Objective Response (TTR) is define d as the time from 
randomization to the first  documented response (CR or PR).
Safety and tolerability will be measured by the incidence of de aths, adverse events, serious adverse 
events, adverse events leading to discontinuation, immune-media ted adverse events, select adverse 
events, adverse events leading t o dose d elay, and specific laboratory a bnormalities (w orst grade) 
in each treatment group. Toxicities w ill be graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
Common Terminology Cri teria for Adverse Even ts (CTCAE) version 4.0.
Tumor cell PD-L1 expression is defined as the percent of tumor cell mem brane staining in a 
minimum of 100 evaluable tumor cells per validated Dako PD-L1 IH C assay. Participant’s PD-L1 
expression status using ≥1% expression level will be determined prior to randomization:

Time to symptom deterioration (TTSD) is defined as the time fro m randomization to  a clinically 
meaningful decline from baseline in the FHNSI-10 score. A clini cally meaningful decline will be 
defined as a reduction of FHNSI-10 score ≥3 points.56Subjects who die without a reported 
deterioration will be considered to have deteriorated on the da te of their death. Those who neither 
deteriorate nor die will be censored at the time of their last FHNSI-10 assessment.
Serum concentration will be used to characterize the PK of nivo lumab and ipilimumab using a 
population PK approach.
Other exploratory endpoints are discussed in detail in the stat istical analysis plan
8.4 Analyses
8.4.1 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized by  treatment arm as randomized 
using descriptive statistics. Th ese analyses will be done PD-L1  CPS ≥ 20 population and on the
all randomized population.
8.4.2 Efficacy Analyses
Efficacy analyses will be performed using all ra ndomized participants  by treatmen t group as 
randomized.
8.4.2.1 Analysis Methods for Pr imary E ndpoints
OS will be compared between arms via a two-sided, overall alpha = 0.025, group sequential log-
rank test for each of the two primary endpoints population. T he significance levels may be updated 
through graphical approach where the family-wise error rate wil l be protected in the strong sense. 
Rules for updating significan ce levels following the Bonferroni -based graphic approach by Maurer 
and Bretz (2013) will be detailed in the SAP.  Figure 8.4.2.1-1: is the graphic display of the testing 
hierarchy for the endpoints to be tested in this study. The numbe rs next to the arrows indicate the 
fracti on of alpha that could be passed from the source endpoint to th e target endpoint if the source

The nominal significance levels for each look of the group sequen tial log-rank test will be 
determined by the alpha spending function with the O’Brien and Fleming boundary based on the 
actual number of events observed at the time of the analysis. Th ese tests will be str atified by the 
stratification factors used in the randomization.
An estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) and a corresponding two si ded 100*(1 - adjusted α)% 
confidence interval for the HR w ill be gener ated for each endpoint using a stratified Cox 
proportional haza rds model with treatment arm as the sole covari ate. The stratification factors will 
be the same as those used for testing. The level for the confid ence interval for the OS hazard ratio 
will be based on the same nominal significance level for the gr oup sequential log-rank test,.
Survival distributions will be estimated, by arm, via the Kaplan-Meier (KM) product-limit method. 
Median survival times along with 95% confidence intervals for t he medians, will also be presented. 
The confidence interval for the median will be constructed using a generalization of the 
Brookmeye r and Crowley method based on a log {-log} transformat ion of the survival function.57
Greater detail on the analyses of primary endpoints, including sensitivity analyses of OS, will be 
provided in the statist ical analysis plan.
8.4.2.2 Analysis Methods for Secondary Endpoints
The analyses of OS in the randomized participants with PD-L1 CP S ≥ 1 population will be similar 
to those in the randomized participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20, except that testing will be contingent 
upon a significant result for the primary OS comparison in PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20 population, On the 
other hand, if the test for this secondary endpoint is signific ant and the initial test for OS in all 
randomized participants is  not significant, the latter can be retested with full alpha = 0. 05.
The analysis of PFS in the participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20 and in all randomized participants
will be performed using a stratified Cox proportional hazards m odel with treatment arm as the sole 
covariate. An estimate of the hazard ratio (HR) and a correspond ing two sided 95% CI for the HR 
will be gener ated. Survival distributions w ill be es timated, by arm, via the Kaplan-Meier (KM)

No statistical test will be performed.
ORR and its associated 95% CI w ill be presented per arm, in all randomized par ticipants and 
participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20. The confidence interval for OR R will be computed usi ng the 
Clopper and Pearson method. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confiden ce interval for the ratio will 
be generated using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) method. The distribution of DOR will be estimated via the KM method for participants whose best response 
is PR or CR, by arm. Medians and 6, 9, and 12 month rates will also be estimated. These analyses 
will be conducted on the all randomized population and PD-L1 CPS  ≥ 20 subpopulation.
No statistical test w ill be perf ormed for O RR, DOR for all randomized participants and participants 
with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20.
8.4.3 Safety Analyses
Safety analyses are restricted  to treated particip ants. Descriptive statistics of safety will be 
presented using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Term inology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 by treatment arm. All AEs, drug-rela ted AEs, SAEs and drug-related 
SAEs will be tabulated using the worst grade per NCI CTCAE v 4.0 criteria by system organ class 
and preferred term. On-study lab parameters including hematolog y, coagulation, chemistry, liver 
function and renal function will be summarized using worse grad e per NCI CCAE v 4.0 criteria.
These analyses will be performed on both the popul ation of trea ted participants with PD-L1 
expressing tumors and on all treated participants.
8.4.4 Pharmacokinetic Analyses
The nivolumab and ipilimumab concentration data obtained in this  study may be combined with 
data from other studies in the clinical development program to develop or refine a population PK 
model. This model may be used to evaluate the effects of intrin sic and extrinsic covariates on the 
PK of nivolumab and to determine measures of individual exposur e (such as steady-state peak, 
trough, and time-averaged concen tration). In addition, model determined exposures may be used 
for exposure-response analyses. Results of population PK and ex posure response-analyses will be 
reported separately.
8.4.5 Biomarker Analyses
Analyses of PD-L1 expression will include:
•KM Plots of efficacy by arm for each PD-L1 CPS status subset (ana lyses with PD-L1 CPS 
cutoff of ≥ 20, ≥ 1, < 20, and other exploratory cut-points). This analysis will include HRs of 
the experimental to control arm within subset and corresponding 95% CI.
•KM Plots of PFS and OS by arm for each tumor cell PD-L1 s tatus subset (< 1%, ≥ 1%, 
unknown). (Similar analyses with 5%, 10%, 50%, other explorator y PD-L1 cutoffs will be 
conducted). This analysis will include HRs of the experimental to control arm within subset
and corresponding 95% CI.

•Box plots of PD-L 1 expression at baseline versus response statu s, by treatment group
•Odds ratios for tumor response of the experimental to the control arm by PD-L1 status subset 
and corresponding 95% CI
•Model-based assessment of the interaction between treatment and  PD-L1 status for PFS, OS, 
and ORR.
The analyses of tumor mutational burden (TMB) and tumor inflamm ation gene e xpression  profile 
(GEP) will also include KM plo ts by TMB and GEP subgroups, box pl ots of TMB by response, 
and model based assessments of interaction between treatment an d TMB/GEP for PFS, OS, and 
ORR. 
Associations between other po tential biomarkers and efficacy and safety may be investigated as 
well. These analyses will be completed with biomarkers measured  in blood and in tumor samples 
and will focus primarily on SNPs in select genes associated with  immunity or on the e xpression 
of PD-1 and PD-L2 proteins in t umor specimens. Si milar ana lyses may be completed with data 
regarding serum-soluble factors, serum miRNA content, T-cell po pulations, and putative 
additional analyses to be completed using FFPET. Associations b etween biomarkers and efficacy 
measures will be analyzed on all randomized p articipants with available biomarker data. Efficacy 
measures will include response, PFS, and OS. Demographic and ca se-history factors will be 
examined to determine whether stratification or adjustments sho uld be made within the subsequent 
statist ical analyses, and if n ecessary, the appropriate stratification or adjustment w ill be made. 
Biomarkers will be summarized graphically as they relate to eff icacy and safety endpoints, as 
applicable. Summary statistics may be tabulated. SNP allele freq uencies may be summarized. The 
relationships between binary measures (eg. response) and candid ate biomarke rs will be 
investigated using logistic regression. Associations may be summ arized in terms of point and 
interval estimates of hazard ratios, odds ratios, or other stat istics, as appropriate for the analyses 
completed. Models to p redict clinical activity based on combina tions of biomarkers may also be 
investigated. Additional post hoc statist ical analyses not specified in the protocol, such as 
alternative modeling approaches may be completed. All analyses described above are based on the 
availability of the data.8.4.6 Outcomes Research Analyses
Exploratory analyses of EQ-5D and FACT-H&N (including FHNSI-10)  data will be performed in 
randomized participants who have an assessment at baseline (Day  1, assessment prior to 
administration of drug on day of first dose) and at least 1 sub sequent assessment while on 
treatment. Questionn aire completion rate, defined as the propor tion of questionnaires actually 
received out of the expected number, will be calculated and summarized at each assessment point.
EQ-5D data will be described by treatment group as randomized i n the following ways: 
•EQ-5D index scores and post-baseline changes in scores will be summarized at each 
assessment time point using descri ptive statist ics (ie, N, mean with SD and 95% CI, median, 
first and third quartiles, minimum, maximum). In the base case,  scores will be calculated using 
the UK preference-weighting algorithm.

described by treatment group as randomized in the following way s: 
•Scores and post-baseline changes in scores for the following co mponents of the FACT-H&N 
will be su mmarized at each assessment time point using descriptive s tatistics (ie, N, mean 
with SD and 95% CI, median, first and third quartiles, minimum, maximum): FACT-G, PWB, 
SWB, EWB, FWB, HNC, FHNSI-10, FACT-H&N TOI, FACT-H&N total, and  individual 
FACT-H&N items. 
FHNSI-10 data will be described by treatment group as randomize d in the following ways: 
•Scores and post-baseline changes in scores will be summarized at each assessment time point 
(i.e., first, second, third, etc. survival follow-up visit reco gnizing that the timing of visits will 
vary among participants) using descriptive s tatistics (ie, N, mean with SD and 95% CI, median, 
first and third quartiles, minimum, maximum). 
•The proportion (N) of participants with symptomatic deteriorati on, defined as a clinically 
meaningful decline in score (worsening from baseline ≥3 points) or death, will be summarized 
at each assessment time point (ie, first, second, third, etc. s urvival follow-up visit recognizing 
that the timing of visits will vary among participants).
•Time to symptom deterioration (TTSD) will be estimated using th e KM product-limit method, 
by arm as randomized. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals for me dian TTSD will be 
computed.
Analyses of patient-reported outcomes will be performed on both  the randomized PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20 
population a nd the all randomized population.

O’Brien and Fleming alpha spending function, based on the actual number of events observed. 
If interi m compa rison of OS in either all randomized participants or randomized pa rticipants with 
PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20 is significant, the DMC will inform the sponsor, as described in the DMC charter.
If comparison of OS in the randomized participants with PD-L1 C PS ≥ 20 is significant, OS in 
randomized participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1 will be subsequently t ested using group sequential 
testing procedure. The overall alpha for this secondary endpoint will be determined following the graphical procedure which is detailed in the SAP.
The DMC will have access to periodic un-blinded interim reports  of efficacy and safety to allow a 
risk/benefit assessment. Details will be included in the DMC charter.

An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate an d accurate case histories designed 
to record all observations and other d ata pertinent to the investig ation on each individual treated 
or entered as a control in the investigation. Data that are der ived from source documents and 
reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source document s or the discrepancies must be 
explained. Additional clinical information may be collected and  analyzed in an effort to enhance 
understanding of product safety. CRFs may be requested for AEs a nd/or laboratory abnormalities 
that are reported or identified during the course of the study.
•For sites using the BMS electronic data capture tool, electroni c CRFs will be prepared for all 
data collection fields except for fields specific to SAEs and p regnancy, which will be reported 
on the electronic SAE form and Pregnancy Surveillance form, res pectively. If electronic SAE 
form is not available, a paper SAE form can be used. Spaces may  be left blank only in those 
circumstances permitted by study-specific CRF completion guidel ines provided by Sponsor or 
designee.
The confidentiality of records that could identify participants  must be protected, respecting the 
privacy and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applic able regulatory requirement(s).
The investigator will maintain a signature sheet to document signatures and initials of all persons 
authorized to make entries and/or corrections on CRFs. 
The completed CRF, SAE/pregnancy CRFs, must be promptly reviewe d, signed, and dated by the 
investigator or qualified physician who is a sub investigator an d who is delegated this task on the 
Delegation of Authority Form. S ub investigators in Japan may not  be delegated the CRF approval

APPENDIX 2 MANAGEMENT ALGORITHMS
These general guidelines constitu te guidance to the Investigato r and may be supplemented by 
discussions with the Medical Monitor representing the Sponsor. The guidance applies to all 
immuno-oncology agents and regimens.
A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be di ligently evaluated according to 
standard medical practice. Non-inf lammatory etiologies should be  considered and appropriately 
treated.
Corticosteroids are a pr imary therapy for immuno-oncology drug-related adverse events. The 
oral equivalent of the recommended IV doses may be considered f or ambulatory patients with 
low-grade toxicity. The lower bioavailability of  oral corticosteroids should be taken into account 
when switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.
Consultation with a medical or surgical specialis t, especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedure, is recommended.The frequency and severity of the related adverse events covered by these algorithms will depend 
on the immuno-oncology agent or regimen being used.

APPENDIX 3 RECIST 1.1 GUIDELINES
1 EVALUATION OF LESIONS
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes w ill be categorized measurable or non-measurable as 
follows:
1.1 Measurable
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one dime nsion (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
1. 10 mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 m m)
2. 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions which cannot be accurately measured 
with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable)
3. 20 mm by chest x-ray
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph  
node must be ≥15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thi ckness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet th e  c r i t e r i o n  of  a  s h o r t  a x i s  o f  
≥15 mm by CT scan. Only the short axis of these nodes will contri bute to the baseline sum. The 
short axis of the node is the diameter normally use d by radiologists to j udge if a node is involved 
by solid tumor. Nodal size is normally reported as two dimensio ns in the plane in which the 
image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of 
acquisition may be axial, sa ggital or coronal ). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. 
For example, an abdominal node w hich is reported as being 20 mm  x 30 mm has a short axis of 
20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this exa mple, 20 mm should be 
recorded as the node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥10 mm 
but < 15 mm) should be considered non-target lesions. Nodes tha t have a short axis < 10 mm are 
considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or follo wed.
1.2 Non-Measurable
All other lesions are considered non-measurable, including smal l lesions (l ongest d iameter 
< 10mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to < 15 mm short axis) as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non-measurable  include: leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural or pe ricardial effusi on, infla mmatory  breast disease, lymphangitic 
involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical 
exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.

2 BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF ‘TARGET’ AND ‘NON-TARGET’ 
LESIONS
When more than one meas urable lesion is present at baseline all  lesions up to a maximum of five 
lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) represen tative of all involved organs 
should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and  measured at baseline (this means 
in instances where patients have only one or two organ sites in volved a maximum of two and 
four lesions respectively will be recorded).
Target lesions should be selecte d on the basis of their size (l esions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should b e those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on  occasion, the largest lesion does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstan ce the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected.A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short ax is for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis i s added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize  any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes s hould be ide ntified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Mea surements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ 
(more details to follow). In addition, it is possible to record  multiple nontarget lesions involving 
the same organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, ‘m ultiple enlarged pelvic lymph 
nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).
3 RESPONSE CRITERIA
3.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axi s to < 10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesio ns, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesio ns, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes th e baseline sum if that 
is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase  of 20%, the sum must 
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of 
one or more new lesions is also considered progression).
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient i ncrease to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.

3.1.1 Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions
3.1.1.1 Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes identified as target lesions s hould always have the actual short axis measurement
recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline  examination), even if the nodes 
regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when lymph nod es are included as target 
lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a 
normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10 mm.  Case report forms or other data 
collection methods may therefore be designed t o have target nodal lesions recorded in a separate 
section where, in order to qualify for CR, each node must achie ve a short axis < 10 mm. For PR, 
SD and PD, the actual short axi s measurement of the nodes is to  be included in the sum of target 
lesions.
3.1.1.2 Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’
While on study, all lesions (nodal and non-nodal) r ecorded at baseline s hould have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). 
However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as  target lesions at baseline 
become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel co mfortable assigning an exact 
measure and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’. Wh en this occurs it is important 
that a value be recorded on the case report form. If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the 
lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be record ed as 0 mm. If the lesion is 
believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to mea sure, a default value of 5 mm 
should be assigned (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they 
usually have a definable size when normal and are freque ntly surrounded by fat such as in the 
retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be pre sent and is faintly seen but too 
small to measure, a default value of  5 mm s hould be assigned in this circumstance as well). This 
default value is derived from the 5 mm CT slice thickness (but should not be changed with 
varying CT slice thickness). The measurement of these lesions i s potentially non-reproducible, 
therefore providing this default value will prevent false responses or progressi ons based upon 
measurement e rror. To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is  able to provide an actual measure, 
that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
3.1.1.3 Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment
When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the  fragmented portions should be 
added together to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, a s lesions coalesce, a plane between 
them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diam eter measurements of each 
individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such tha t they are no longer separable, the 
vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the m aximal longest diameter for the 
‘coalesced lesion’.

3.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to d etermine the tumor response for the 
group of non-target lesions. While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they 
need not be measured and instead  should be assessed only qualita tively at the time points 
specified in the protocol.
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tu mor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10mm short 
axis). 
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintena nce of tumor 
marker level above t he normal limits.
Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression (see comments below) of existing non-
target lesions. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progression).
3.2.1 Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non-Target Disease
The concept of progression of non-target disease requires addit ional explanation as follows:
3.2.1.1 When the patient also has measurable diseaseIn this setti ng, to achieve ‘unequi vocal progression’ on the basis of the no n-target disease, there 
must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target  disease such that, even in 
presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden  has increased sufficiently to 
merit discontinuation of therapy (see examples in Appendix 2  and further d etails bel ow). A 
modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions  is usually not sufficient to qualify 
for unequivocal progression status. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of 
change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely 
rare.
3.2.1.2 When the patient has only non-measurable disease
This circumstance arises in some trials when it is not a criter i o n  o f  s t u d y  e n t r y  t o  h a v e  
measurable disease. The same general concepts apply here as not ed above, however, in this 
instance there is no measurable disease assessment to factor in to the interpretation of an increase 
in non-measurable disease burden. Because worsening in non-target disease cannot be easily 
quantified (by definition: if all lesions are truly non-measura ble) a useful test that can be applied 
when assessing patients for unequivocal progression is to consi der if the increase in overall 
disease burden based on the change in non-measurable disease is  comparable in magnitude to the 
increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable di sease: ie, an increase in tumor 
burden representing an additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (whi ch is equivalent to a 20% 
increase diameter i n a measurable lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion 
from ‘trace’ to ‘large’, an increase in lymphangitic disease fr om localized to widespread, or may 
be described in protocols as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’. If ‘unequivocal 
progression’ is seen, the  patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that point. While

BMS-936558 nivolumab
it would be id eal to have  objective criteria to apply to non -measurable disease, the very nature of 
that disease makes it impossible to do so; therefore the increase must be substantial.
3.2.2 New Lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progres sion; therefore, some 
comments on d etection of new lesions are  important. There are n o specific criteria for the 
identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the findin g of a new lesion should be 
unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning te chnique, change in imaging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ 
bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-existing les ions). This is particularly 
important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or c omplete response. For example, 
necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is 
not.
A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical locat ion that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease pr ogression. An example of this is 
the patient who has visceral disease at baseline and while on s tudy has a CT or MRI brain 
ordered which reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastase s are considered to be evidence 
of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new di sease. If repeat scans confirm there 
is definitely a new lesion, th en progression should be declared  using the date of the init ial scan. 
While FDG-PET response assessments need additional study, it is  sometimes reasonable to 
incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanni ng in assessment of 
progression (particularly possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging 
can be identified according to the following al gorithm:
1) Negative FDG-PET at bas eline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesion.
2) No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: I f the positive FDG-PET at 
follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT,  this is PD. If the positive 
FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up 
CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the 
date of PD will be the d ate of the initial a bnormal FDG-PET sca n). If the positive FDG-PET 
at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on C T that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.
3.3 Response Assessment
3.3.1 Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from th e start of the study treatment until 
the end of treatment taking into account any requirement for co nfirmation. The patient’s best 
overall response assignment will depend on the findings of both  target and non-target disease and

will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions . Furthermore, depending on the 
nature of the study and the protocol requirements, it may also require confirmatory measurement.
3.3.2 Time Point Response
It is assumed that at each protocol specified time point, a response assessment occurs. Ta ble 
3.3.2-1 provides a su mmary of the overall response status calculation a t each time point for 
patients who have measurable disease at baseline. When patients  have non-measurable (therefore 
non-target) disease only, Table 3.3.2-2 is to be used.

3.3.3 Best Overall Response 
Best response determinati on of complete or par tial res ponse requires confirmation: Complete or 
partial responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a subsequent time point 
of ≥4 weeks later. In this circumstance, the best overall response c an be interpreted as in Table 
3.3.3-1.
Special note on response assessment: When nodal disease is included in the sum of target 
lesions and the nodes decrease to ‘normal’ size (< 10 mm), they  may still have a measurement 
reported on scans. This measurement should be recorded even tho ugh the nodes are normal in 
order not to overstate progression s hould it be based on increase in s ize of the nodes. As noted 
earlier, this means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the case report 
form (CRF).

aIf a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that poi nt (since disease must have reappeared after CR). 
Best response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD w as met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be 
claimed when subsequent scans s uggest small lesions were likely  still present and in fact the patient had PR, not 
CR at the first time point. Under these circumstances, the orig inal CR should be changed to PR and the best 
response is PR.

3.3.4 Confirmation Scans
Verification of Response: To be assigned a status of CR or PR, c hanges in tumor measurements 
must be confirmed by consecutive repeat assessments that should  be performed no less than 
28 days after the criteria for response are first met. For this study, the next scheduled tumor 
assessment can meet this requirement.
Verification of Progression: Progression of disease should be ver ified in cases where progression 
is equivocal. If repeat scans confirm PD, then progression should be declared using the date of 
the initial scan. If rep eat scans do not c onfirm PD, then the subject is considered to not have 
progressive disease.

APPENDIX 4 WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL DEFINITIONS AND 
METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until beco ming post-menopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hy sterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
•Premenarchal
•Premenopausal female wi th 1 of the following:
−Documented hysterectomy
−Documented bilateral salpingectomy
−Documented bilateral oophorectomy
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of  the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or m edical history interview.
•Postmenopausal female
−A postmenopausal state is defined as 12 months of ame norrhea in a woman over age 45 
years in the absence of other biological or physiological cause s. In addition, females 
under the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle stimulatin g hormone, (FSH) level 
> 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE FOR FEMALE PARTICIPANTS OF CHILD BEARING

•Intrauterine device (IUD)c
•Bilateral tubal occlusion
•Vasectomized partner 
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner 
is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
•Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
•It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception whe n complete abstinence is 
elected. 
•WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Section 2. 
•Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abs tinence 
NOTES: 
aTypical use failure rates may differ from those when used consi stently and correctly. Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive metho ds for participants participating in clinical 
studies. 
bHormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with t he study drug, which may reduce the efficacy 
of the contraceptive method.  Hormonal contraception is permissi ble only when there is sufficient evidence 
that the IMP and other study med ications will  not alter hormonal e xposures such that contraception would be 
ineffective or result in increased exposures that could be pote ntially hazardous.  In this case, alternative 
methods of contraception should be utilized. 
cIntrauterine devices and intrauterine hormone releasing systems are acceptable methods of contraception in the 
absence of definitive drug interaction studies when hormone exp osures from intrauterine devices do not alter 
contraception effectiveness
Unacceptable Methods of Contraception*
•Male or female condom with or wit hout spermicide.  Male and fem ale condoms cannot be

APPENDIX 6 REVISED PROTOCOL SUMMARY OF CHANGE HISTORY
Overall Rationale for the Revised Protocol 04, 20-Jun-2018
Evolving data in SCCHN in the recent years suggest that PD-L1 c ombined positive score (PD-L1 
CPS) is a more appropriate PD-L1 measure for selecting particip ants who derive the best benefit 
for immunotherapy. Additionally, recent data dem onstrate the po tential for nivolumab + 
ipilimumab to benefit a broader SCCHN patien t population than P D-L1 expressers alone. The 
primary end-points of the current study (Ch eckMate 651) w ill be revised to compare: (a) OS of 
participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 20 who are receiving nivolumab co mbined with ipilimumab to
those receiving EXTREME regimen (change d from tumor cell PD-L1 ≥ 1%) and (b) OS of all 
study participants (irrespective of PD-L1 expression) who are r eceiving nivolumab combined 
with ipilimumab to those receiving EXTREME regimen. Additionall y, OS for nivolumab +
ipilimumab versus EXTREME regimen in participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1 will be added as a 
key secondary end-point. The primary end-point of PFS for nivol umab + ipilimumab versus 
EXTREME regimen w ill be removed as evolving data suggest that P FS is not an appropriate 
end-point for immunotherapy in SCCHN.

Section 1.4.1:  Primary

made to the primary 
objectives:
(a) Modify: Compare OS for 
participants who are 
receiving nivolumab + 
ipilimumab versus 
EXTREME regimen in 
participants with PD-L1 CPS 
≥ 20 (changed from tumor 
PD-L1 ≥ 1) and 
(b) Add: OS for nivolumab + 
ipilimumab versus 
EXTREME regimen in all 
study participants 
(irrespective of PD-L1 
expression). 
(c) Remove: The primary 
end-point of PFS for 
nivolumab + ipilimumab 
versus EXTREME regimen. In all of the recent studies of PD-1 
inhibitors in SCCHN, PFS did not 
capture the benefit of PD-1 therapy 
versus standard of care therapy in 
both biomarker selected and 
unselected population. Emerging 
data from multiple studies in the 
recent years (CheckMate141, 
KeyNote-040, KeyNote-048) 
demonstrated long term OS benefit 
with PD-1 inhibitor (nivolumab and 
pembrolizumab) therapy in R/M 
SCCHN population.  
 
 
These studies while 
suggesting OS benefit in all study 
subjects also showed with a trend 
towards better efficacy in 
participants who express PD-L1 in 
either their tumor or immune cells. 
Summary of this data also suggest
that CPS is a more appropriate PD-
L1 measure for selecting 
participants who derive the best 
benefit for immunotherapy. 
Additionally, recent data 
demonstrate the potential for 
nivolumab + ipilimumab to benefit a 
broader SCCHN patient population 
than tumor cell PD-L1 expressers 
alone.

Overall Rationale for the Revised Protocol 03, 01-May-2018
The rationale for the key changes is based on the recent data f rom the 2-year survival update of 
CheckMate 141 (CA209141) study of nivolumab versus standard of c are chemotherapy in 
recurrent or metastatic SCCHN patients post platinum therapy. T he data from this update showed 
that, in the overall study p opulation, nivolumab demonstrated 32% reduction in risk of death 
compared to chemotherapy (HR = 0.68 [95% CI: 0.54, 0.86]). Furt hermore, in patients whose 
tumors expressed PD-L1 ≥1% (PD-L1 expressors), nivolumab demonstrated a 45% reduction i n 
risk of death versus chemotherapy (HR = 0.55 [95% CI: 0.39, 0.7 8]). This recent data, while 
confirming the long-term survival benefit of check-point inhibi tors in the over-all SCCHN 
population (irrespective of baselin e biomarker status), also de monstrates a r elatively better 
efficacy in PD-L1 expressors. Based on the summary of the above  data, the current Phase 3 
CA209651 study will compare the co-primary end-points of PFS an d OS between study arms in 
PD-L1 expressor population. The PFS and OS in over- all study p opulation w ill be evaluated as 
secondary end-points.
It has been shown that approximately 60% of the SCCHN tumors ma y express PD-L1. 
Therefore, the required number of events and sample size were i ncreased to allow adequate 
power to analyze the co-primary end-points of PFS and OS in thi s biomarker-selected group. The 
primary objective, endpoints, sample size and s tatist ical analys is sections of the protocol were 
revised accordingly.

Section Number & Title Description of Change Brief Rationale
Primary Objectives; 
Section 1.3.1The primary objectives were 
changed from PFS and OS in
all randomized subjects to 
PFS and OS in subjects with 
PD-L1 expressing tumors.CheckMate 141 compared 
nivolumab monotherapy to 
investigator choice monotherapy 
in platinum refractory SCCHN 
subjects. The updated analysis of 
CheckMate 141 (2-year OS 
update) provided evidence of 
efficacy in both the tumor PD-
expressor and PD-L1non-expressor (<1%) groups. 
However, the efficacy was 
greatest in the PD-L1 expressor
group. Based on these results, the 
primary comparisons of PFS and 
OS will be conducted in the 
subjects with PD-L1 expressing 
tumors. Comparisons of these 
endpoints in all study subjects
will become secondary 
objectives.
Synopsis, Study Design; 
Statistical Considerations, 
Sample Size; Section 8.1Sample Size determination 
was updated with sample 
size increased from 700 to 930.Based on the 2-year survival 
update of CheckMate 141 study, 
subjects with PD-L1 expressing 
tumors had a relatively better 
efficacy with nivolumab 
treatment. Hence, the primary 
analysis population was changed 
from all study subjects to subjects 
with PD-L1 expressing tumors. 
The required number of events 
and sample size were increased in order to provide adequate power 
in this biomarker-selected group. 
Power was provided for the 
primary comparisons of PFS and 
OS and for the secondary 
comparisons of these endpoints in 
all sub jects.
Section 8.4.2.1, Analysis 
Methods for Co-primary 
EndpointsIndicated that the primary 
analyses would be in PD-L1expressors rather than in the 
entire study population.In line with the change in the 
primary objectives.

Overall Rationale for the Revised Protocol 02, 26-Oct-2017
The purpose of this revised protocol is to increase the sample size to account for a d elay in 
separation of the Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves for both progression -free survival (PFS) and overall 
survival (OS) between the 2 treatment arms. Delayed separation of the Kaplan-Meier curves for 
nivolumab and standard of care chemotherapy was observed in CA2 09141, the Phase 3 study of 
nivolumab in platinum-refractory squamous cell carcinoma of the  head and neck.
In addition, a maximum duration of nivolumab and ipilimumab tre atment of 24 months from the 
start of treatment was a dded. Accumulating evidence from different clinical trials in different 
tumor types with nivolumab or nivolumab combined to ipilimumab indicates that no additional 
benefit is obtained for subjects treated beyond 24 months, and responses remain durable.
Duration of response has been changed from an exploratory objec tive to a secondary objective 
based on the expected improvement in duration of response as se en in other nivolumab trials. 
Response to first therapy after disease progression was changed  to an exploratory endpoint to 
limit the secondary objectives only to critical endpoints. 
Tumor mu tational burden has been shown to be a predictive biomarker of efficacy for checkpoint 
inhibitors in several tumors. Therefore, exploratory biomarker objectives were added in order to 
evaluate the potential associations  between efficacy outcomes ( such as objective response rate, 
PFS, and OS) with select biomarke rs, including tu mor mutational burden, from tumor tissue and 
peripheral blood. The amount of tumor tissue required for study entry was increased to allow 
enough samples for these additional exploratory analyses.

Primary Objectives overall survival were 
reformatted. 
Synopsis, Secondary 
Objectives; Section 1.3.2, 
Secondary Objectives Moved duration of responses
(duration of response) to a 
secondary objective.Measuring the durability of 
response is particularly important with IO agents because some 
subjects on IO agents have stay in 
response for an extended period 
of times. The objective was elevated to a secondary objective. 
Synopsis, Exploratory 
Objectives; Section 1.3.3, 
Exploratory ObjectivesMoved time to symptom 
deterioration to an 
exploratory endpoint. Time to symptom deterioration 
was moved to an exploratory 
objective in order to limit the list of secondary objectives focused on critical endpoints.
Removed response to first 
subsequent therapy after 
disease progression objective.Reliable data cannot be collected 
on this endpoint . In addition, this 
endpoint is of limited value.
Strengthened the objective related to the association 
between biomarkers and clinical outcomes. Added exploratory endpoint to 
support the collection of 
additional biological samples for biomarker analysis. 
Added an exploratory 
objective related to the 
association between tumor 
mutational burden and 
clinical outcomes.Tumor mutational burden has 
been shown to be a predictive 
biomarker of efficacy for 
checkpoint inhibitors in several 
tumors. Therefore, it is important 
to elevate this endpoint. 
Added an exploratory 
objective related to the 
association between 
biomarker and clinical outcomes. It is important to identify the predictive biomarkers of response 
and prognosis in SCCHN. 
Therefore, an exploratory 
objective was added to evaluate 
select blood and tissue based 
biomarkers in tumor and bl ood 
samples.

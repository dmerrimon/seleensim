Page 11 of 366. RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND
Migraine is a common, often disabling neurologic disease characterized by recurrent attacks 
of head pain that are typically unilateral, throbbing, and associated with a range of symptoms that may include photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting.
1-3Migraine can be 
classified as episodic or chronic based on the frequency of the migraine or headache: episodic migraine (EM) is characterized by one to 14 monthly headache days (MHDs) or monthly migraine days (MMDs), while chronic migraine (CM) is characterized by 15 or more MHDs for at least three months, with at least eight days a month on which the headaches and associated symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for migraine.
1,3,4Migraine is a 
clinically complex disorder, and in addition to its direct clinical burden, patients experience a greater number of comorbidities compared to those without migraine.
5
In 2019, an estimated 1.1 billion people in the world suffered from migraine, causing 42.1 million years lived with disability (YLD).
6Women are two to three times more likely 
than men to be affected by migraine.7-9The global age-standardized prevalence of migraine 
was 14.1% in 2019, which is an increase of 1.7% since 1990. There were 87.6 million 
incident cases of migraine globally in 2019, resulting in an incidence of 11.4%, which was an 
increase of 2.1% since 1990.6
In the US, migraine accounted for $36 billion in both direct and indirect costs in 2016.10The 
three most common locations for migraine care are primary care, neurologist, and emergency department (ED) settings, with approximately 1.2 million ED visits in the US annually due to migraine attacks.
11Indirect costs related to work productivity impairment are commonly 
incurred in patients with migraine, with presenteeism accounting for the majority of work-related productivity loss.
12,13Annual costs due to migraine-related lost productivity in the US 
were estimated at $2.1 million for the manufacturing sector and $2.9 million for the service sector (per 10,000 individuals).
14Patients with refractory migraine have higher mean annual 
frequency of outpatient visits, ED visits and admissions, and a higher intensity of care vs. patients with migraine and those without migraine.
15
While treatment goals vary by region, guidelines from both the US and France (the most recently published treatment goals in Europe) for acute migraine treatment suggest these are rapid and sustained freedom from pain, improvement in other migraine symptoms, and 
minimal or no adverse events (AEs).
16,17There is significant need for effective and tolerable 
treatments for migraine sufferers, especially those who experience at least four migraine days per month. In these patients, preventive treatment is recommended to reduce migraine-related disability and the overuse of acute therapies and rescue medication.
16Both US and European 
guidelines note the importance of reduced attack frequency, reduction or maintenance (no escalation) of acute treatment use, and an improvement in quality of life (QoL).
16,17Current 
migraine treatments leave millions of people who have migraine with unmet needs due to lack of and/or insufficient efficacy, AEs, and contraindications.

Page 12 of 36Rimegepant (VYDURA®/NURTEC® ODT), a next-generation, small molecule oral 
selective and potent calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, is the first and only migraine treatment approved for both the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults and for the preventive treatment of EM in adults who have at least four migraine attacks per month. Prior to rimegepant, there was no single medication proven to be safe and effective for both acute and preventive treatment of migraine. Rimegepant was approved in the US for the acute treatment of migraine in February 2020, and for preventive 
treatment of episodic migraine in adults who have at least 4 migraine attacks per month in 
May 2021. It was approved by the EMA for both indications in April 2022.
The Adelphi Real World (ARW) Migraine Disease Specific Programme™ (DSP) 2022 
surveys provide an opportunity to examine physician and patient perspectives for rimegepant in the US. This protocol describes the analysis of ARW Migraine VII DSP™ as a secondary real-world data (RWD) source to address the research questions.  
7. RESEARCH QUESTION AND OBJECTIVES
The objectives of this study are to 1) explore reliability of effect with acute use of rimegepant
or triptans; 2) evaluate satisfaction with rimegepant or triptans; 3) evaluate willingness to continue using rimegepant or triptans; 4) explore proportion optimized on treatment with rimegepant or triptans. 
Research questions:
1. What is the reliability of effect of rimegepant or triptans in the real world over 
multiple migraine attacks when taken PRN?
2. How satisfied are patients with rimegepant or triptans to treat their migraine attacks?3. How willing are patients to continue taking rimegepant or triptans to treat their 
migraine attacks?
4. What proportion of those treating acutely with rimegepant or triptans are adequately 
responding and well managed?
5. When do patients administer rimegepant or triptans when treating an acute attack?090177e1a08d5ddf\Approved\Approved On: 10-May-2024 14:32 (GMT)

Page 13 of 368. RESEARCH METHODS 
8.1. Study DesignA cross-sectional study design using physician and patient survey data drawn from the ARW
Migraine VII DSP will be employed to assess the acute use of, satisfaction with, willingness to continue use and treatment optimization of rimegepant or triptans in patients with migraine. Participants were recruited into the Migraine VII DSP in the US between May 2022 and November 2022. This study comprises a secondary data analysis of DSP data.
The full DSP methodology has been published and validated and the illustration below 
outlines the main phases of the DSP].
20,21,22The DSP was conducted across a number of 
countries including the EU5 and US. Given the timing of the data collection, only data from the US will be utilized as rimegepant was available on the US market at the time of administration, unlike for other countries. 
The ARW DSP ™are made available to subscribers upon the strict condition that all 
information remains the intellectual property of ARW and should not be divulged to any third party except with the written prior permission of ARW. Pfizer has subscribed to access the ARW Migraine VII DSP and so cannot be considered as the Study Sponsor.
8.2. Setting
ARW works with field partners across the US with the same principle of physician-based 
recruitment for all DSPs. Both physician-level and patient-level data are available for analyses of the migraine DSP (see Figure 1 ). 
The study population will comprise of consulting patients included in the Migraine VII DSP 
between May 2022 and November 2022; namely, consulting adult patients diagnosed with migraine and prescribed rimegepant or triptans as an acute treatment for their migraine in the US.
DSP physician participants for the migraine DSP in the US were neurologists and general 
physicians identified from public lists of healthcare professionals and meeting the following criteria:
!Physicians identified as a PCP or neurologist.
!PCPs must make treatment decisions for at least 10 patients with migraine and 
neurologists must make treatment decisions for at least 20 patients with migraine.
Candidate respondents were screened online and those who met the predefined eligibility 
criteria were invited to participate (see Section 8.2.1 andSection 8.2.2 ). 
Each participating physician was asked to provide patient data for up 8 patients with
migraine. Patient data for the migraine DSP was based on patients aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of migraine and not involved in a clinical trial. 090177e1a08d5ddf\Approved\Approved On: 10-May-2024 14:32 (GMT)

Page 14 of 36As described in Figure 1, during the US survey period (May–November 2022), physicians 
involved in the management of migraine patients were recruited to complete an online survey (Physician Survey) of their attitudes and behaviors regarding the treatment of migraine. Each physician then completed an electronic Patient Record Forms (PRFs) on 8 consecutive consulting patients with migraine, regardless of the reason for the visit. The consecutive approach to recruitment was stressed to each participating physician to remove the element of selection bias. A generic copy of the data collection forms for Physicians is included in APPENDIX 2. COPIES OF PATIENT RECORD FORM (PRF), PATIENT SELF COMPLETION (PSC) QUESTIONNAIRES and PHYSICIAN SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRES: ENGLISH LANGUAGE VERSION.
The patients were then asked if they would be willing to complete a pen-and-paper Patient 
Self-Completion (PSC) questionnaire about their experiences of having migraine. This allows a unique view of the disease from both the patient and physician perspective. Completion of the PSC by the patient was voluntary.

8.4. Data Sources
Data will be drawn from the Adelphi Migraine DSP, fielding in the US between May and 
November 2022.
8.5. Study SizeGiven the primary research objective is purely descriptive in nature (i.e., no a priori 
hypotheses specified), the available sample size is fixed by the DSP data collection methodology and simply impacts the precision of any estimates. Therefore, formal sample size calculations are not applicable and have not been performed. All patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be included in the study. For this study, the sample size is 528 (91 Rimegepant, 437 Triptans) for the physician-reported outcomes, and 143 (29 Rimegepant, 113 Triptans) for the patient-reported outcomes. Data Management 
Pseudoanonymised data are taken from the Migraine VII DSP, which is owned and managed 
by ARW.
All data analysis will be conducted using Stata 17 software, version 17.0 (StataCorp, College 
Station, Texas) / IBM
®SPSS®Data Collection Survey Reporter v7.5 or the latest available 
version at time of analysis. All programming code/ syntax written to conduct the requiredanalysis will be logged for transparency and replicability.
8.6. Data Analysis
Analyses will be based on patients receiving rimegepant or triptans only as an acute 
treatment currently for their migraine. 
Data will be stratified by time spent on rimegepant or triptans and number of migraine 
related headache days. 090177e1a08d5ddf\Approved\Approved On: 10-May-2024 14:32 (GMT)

percentiles and minimum and maximum values will be reported for numeric variables, whilst relative frequencies and percentages will be reported for categorical variables.
The real-world nature of the DSP means many variables will contain missing data. We would 
expect the base of patients to vary from variable to variable due to imperfect physician knowledge, physicians not wishing to answer the question, etc. The base relevant to each analysis will be reported in any data tables provided. There will be no imputation of missing data. Where missing values are found in a particular variable, any patients with missing values will be removed from all pieces of analysis where that variable is used. However,patients removed from one piece of analysis are still eligible for inclusion in other analyses. In the derivation of PRO variables, the handling of missing data will follow the official instructions as provided by the author/owner of the PRO questionnaire.

8.7. Quality Control
This study will be conducted according to ARW’s standard operating procedures, with the 
results of the analysis checked for validity and consistency. 
8.8. Limitations of the Research Methods
!Physicians are asked to provide data on consecutively consulting patients who meet 
the eligibility criteria, thus reducing the chance of any selection bias on the consulting population by physicians. However, generalisability of the study results to the wider patient population will be impacted as follows:
!Participants from the Migraine VII DSP (from which the study population is 
drawn) do not constitute a true random sample, more a pragmatic (physicians) and 
pseudo-random (patients) sample, and although minimal selection criteria were imposed to identify physicians for inclusion, participation is influenced by the willingness to complete the record forms.
!The patient sample may be more severely affected by their disease and/or 
treatment due to their consulting nature (ie, a requirement for inclusion in theMigraine VII DSP). Furthermore, patients who consult more frequently are more likely to be included in the patient sample. However, physicians were asked to provide data for a number of consecutively consulting patients meeting the Migraine VII DSP inclusion criteria to reduce selection bias.090177e1a08d5ddf\Approved\Approved On: 10-May-2024 14:32 (GMT)

Page 31 of 36!No patient selection verification procedures were applied to the Migraine VII
DSP, and identification of the participants included was based on physician judgement/ perception rather than formal medical coding (eg, diagnostic codes). Nevertheless, this process is representative of physicians’ real-world classification of their patients.
!The cross-sectional design of the DSP does not allow for causal relationships; 
however, identification of associations is possible.
!Physicians and patients were requested to capture patient information retrospectively 
within the PRF and PSC respectively, which may introduce recall bias – a common limitation of survey data. However, physicians did have the ability to refer to the patients’ medical records while completing the PRF, thus minimising the possibility of recall bias. Moreover, most questions within the PSC have a limited recall period to further minimise the risk of recall bias.
Study data are self-reported by participants (eg, physicians and patients) as no independent 
verification was possible due to the nature of the ARW DSP methodology.
8.9. Other Aspects
Strengths of this research methods are:
!Dataset provides the physicians’ actual treatment and prescribing decisions.
!The DSP is a pseudo-random sample. The methodology used (collecting next n 
consulting patients) aims to reduce the likelihood of selection bias, and the sample should be representative of the consulting population.
!The dataset is an independent data source providing impartiality of data reporting 
with no set hypotheses at design stage.
!The DSP includes all consulting patients, covering both insured and non-insured 
patients. Each patient is unique and there is no double-representation. 
!Amongst the variables collected, importantly, the DSP specifically includes, via the 
physician-completed record form, clinical characteristics, the patient’s complete treatment history from diagnosis to current day and reasons for prescribing / stopping treatment.090177e1a08d5ddf\Approved\Approved On: 10-May-2024 14:32 (GMT)

9.1. Patient Information and ConsentThis study is an analysis of secondary data from the Migraine VII DSP. Participating patients 
in the Migraine VII DSP were treated in accordance with usual medical practice; no additional assessments or tests were conducted in order to participate. Data were collected cross-sectionally at a single point in time and retrospectively for historical information. Patients provided their informed consent prior to completion of the PSC and did not provide any personally identifiable information.
9.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements, as well as 
with scientific purpose, value and rigor and follow generally accepted research practices. 
The DSP was performed in compliance with the EphMRA Code of Conduct and ARW 
standard operating procedures.
The Migraine VII DSP was submitted to the Pearl IRB in the US (IRB number: 22-ADRW-
143). All data were deidentified and pseudoanonymised. 
All study results will be in tabular form and aggregate analyses. As this is an analysis of 
secondary data, additional informed consent, ethics committee or IRB approval are not required. Any publications and reports will not include subject identifiers.
10. MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS/ADVERSE 
REACTIONS 
This is a database analysis study based on secondary use of data collected for other purposes.
No administration of any therapeutic or prophylactic agent was required in this protocol. No reporting of individual case safety reports (ICSRs) ie, adverse events or product quality complaints, to regulatory agencies are required for this database study, as there is no access to individual patient/subject records, it is not possible to assess the causality.
This study involves data that exist as structured data by the time of study start.In these data sources, individual patient data are not retrieved or validated, and it is not 
possible to link (ie, identify a potential association between) a particular product and medical event for any individual. Thus, the minimum criteria for reporting an adverse event (AE) (ie, 
identifiable patient, identifiable reporter, a suspect product, and event) cannot be met .090177e1a08d5ddf\Approved\Approved On: 10-May-2024 14:32 (GMT)

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 5 of 140 Drug Administration (FDA) if there are any changes in dose levels and dosing frequency. Any dose-escalation cohort that has not exceeded the MTD can be expanded up to a maximum of 10 subjects for further evaluation of safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity. The dose to be evaluated in Part B is 240 mg administered Q3W which was determined after review of safety, PK and pharmacodynamic data from subjects treated with toripalimab (JS001) in studies performed in China (see Section 1.4) as well as safety data from subjects treated in Part A of this study. All subjects will be evaluated regularly, and their clinical status classified according to RECIST v1.1 and irRECIST.  Subjects may continue to receive toripalimab Q2W (± 2 days) in Part A, or Q3W (± 2 days) in Part B, in the absence of confirmed progressive disease (a repeat scan will be conducted in 4 weeks ± 2 days in Part A and in 6 weeks ± 2 days in Part B to confirm disease progression), unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, intercurrent illness preventing further administration of study drug, or the investigator considers it in the best interest of the subject to discontinue study therapy.  If feasible, all subjects will be followed for PFS and OS (Part B only) until the end of the study, defined as the date of the last protocol-specified visit/assessment (including telephone contact), or the date the study is closed by the sponsor, whichever comes first.  AEs and SAEs will be followed from the start of the first dose of toripalimab through 90 days after the last dose of toripalimab unless a subject receives another experimental or anticancer therapy, at which time only related AE/SAEs will be collected through 90 days after the last dose of toripalimab. TARGET SUBJECT POPULATION Men and women, 18 years or older, with advanced malignancies that are evaluable by RECIST v1.1 and irRECIST criteria, that are refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists may be enrolled.  Subjects must provide written informed consent, have adequate organ function, and agree to use effective contraception (if relevant).  Subjects with certain serious medical conditions would be excluded from participation in the trial. INCLUSION / EXCLUSION CRITERIA Eligibility criteria for this study have been carefully considered to ensure the safety of the study subjects.

Pregnant or breastfeeding women. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT, DOSAGE, AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION Toripalimab is a humanized, IgG4κ monoclonal antibody specific for PD-1.  Toripalimab will be administered IV over a minimum of 60 minutes in Cycle 1.  In subsequent cycles, the infusion time may be reduced to a minimum of 30 minutes depending upon subject tolerance.  The infusion duration may be increased at any time at the discretion of the investigator.  Refer to Section 3.1.7.3 Management of Toripalimab-related Toxicities.  STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  Statistical Considerations: All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS Version 9.3 or higher, unless otherwise noted.  In general, analysis of categorical variables will include counts and percentage of subjects in each category observed.  For continuous variables, the sample size (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), mean, median, minimum, and maximum will be presented.  No formal comparisons among dose groups (escalation) or treatment cohorts(in Part B expansion cohorts) are planned.  Missing data will not be imputed unless otherwise stated.  Subject demographics, baseline characteristics, and disposition will be characterized using descriptive statistics.  PK data will be presented descriptively, with accompanying figures.  No formal interim analysis is planned for this study.  However, a review of safety data and available PK data will be performed after completion of each dose escalation cohort.  In addition to ongoing safety data review in Part B, a periodic cumulative review of safety will be performed.  A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will fully describe the planned analyses for this study. Sample Size Considerations: It is assumed that 3 cohorts will be required to determine the MTD or the MFD; therefore, up to 18 subjects will be enrolled in the dose escalation (Part A) portion of the study.  Up to 280 subjects will be enrolled in the expansion phase (Part B) at a dose determined from the safety, clinical responses, PK and pharmacodynamics found in Part A and other pertinent data, for a total of up to approximately 298 subjects.  Assuming a 10% drop out rate, a total of up to approximately 327 subjects are expected to be enrolled.  Six expansion cohorts may include 5 disease-specific cohorts and, at the discretion of the Sponsor, another tumor cohort, to a maximum of 40 subjects enrolled in each cohort with the exception of the sarcoma cohort in which a maximum of 80 subjects can be enrolled.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 23 of 140 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Disease Background Genetic and epigenetic changes occurring in cancer cells result in tumor-associated antigens that can be recognized by the immune system (Pardoll 2012).  To produce immunity against tumors, three major steps are important (Mellman, et al., 2011).  First, to initiate the immune response, dendritic cells need to encounter antigens, such as protein products of mutated genes, from the tumor, and process them.  Second, in lymphoid organs, the dendritic cells that are processing the antigens have to generate T-cell responses, such as the production of CD8+ effector cells with cytotoxic capabilities.  In addition, the dendritic cells may evoke antibody responses, or natural killer (NK) or natural killer T (NKT) cell responses.  Third, tumor-specific T cells must enter the tumor environment and attack the tumor.  However, tumors have multiple means of evading the immune response.  Among these are that tumors may facilitate a local increase in regulatory T cells (Treg) that suppress the activity of effector T cells, decrease expression of MHC class I molecules on the surface of tumor cells, decrease expression of tumor antigens targeted by the immune system, or express molecules, such as programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) or programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2), on their surfaces that interact with molecules on the surface of activated T cells.  The latter results in T-cell exhaustion or anergy.  Tumors may also produce molecules such as 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) that suppress T cell function.  Myeloid-derived cells entering the tumor may also produce molecules that suppress effector T cell function.  Hypoxia may result in production of CCL28 that facilitates movement of Treg cells into the tumor.  Tumor stroma cells may block proliferation and function of effector T cells and tumor vascular cells may inhibit T cell adhesion and thereby interfere with homing of such cells into tumors, partly mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endothelin-B receptor (ETBR). An important mechanism by which tumors thwart immune resistance is through immune checkpoint pathways, which normally mediate tolerance and lessen collateral tissue damage.  Immune checkpoints may be stimulatory or inhibitory (Mellman, et al., 2011, Pardoll 2012, Ribas 2012).  The potential T cells targets for immunoregulatory treatments with monoclonal antibodies include those that stimulate activating receptors and those that block the action of inhibitory receptors.  Activating receptors on the T cell include: HVEM, CD27, CD137, GITR, OX40, and CD28.  Inhibitory receptors include: LAG-3, VISTA, BTLA, TIGIT, TIM-3, PD-1, and CTLA-4.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 24 of 140 1.2 Toripalimab Background Toripalimab is briefly described below. Refer to the current Toripalimab Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for details.  Toripalimab injection (also known as JS001 and TAB001) is a humanized IgG4K (immunoglobulin gamma 4, kappa) monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for human programmed death-1 (PD-1), a co-inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells and is being evaluated for the treatment of cancer.  Toripalimab contains serine228 to proline substitution to minimize Fab arm exchange. As with other anti-PD-1 antibodies, toripalimab has a high affinity and blocks interaction between PD-1 and its ligand, PD-L1.  However, toripalimab differs from other such antibodies in that the binding to PD-1 is more prolonged, as measured by the dissociation coefficient.  Based on the results of nonclinical pharmacology studies performed to date, toripalimab binds to human PD-1, and blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands.  Toripalimab inhibits the inhibitory signaling cascade that is triggered by interactions between PD-1 and its ligands.  In primary cell-based assays using cells obtained from healthy donors and cancer patients, toripalimab increases T cell proliferation, effector cytokine production, and survival following stimulation with a variety of antigens. 1.3 Summary of Nonclinical Experience Toripalimab binds both human and cynomolgus monkey PD-1 with similar affinity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry, but does not bind mouse or rat PD-1.  The cynomolgus monkey is thus selected because it is a relevant toxicology species.  Single, 4-week repeat-dose (every 2 weeks over 4 weeks [total of 3 doses]) and 26-week pivotal  repeat-dose (every week over 26 weeks [total of 27 doses]) toxicology studies of toripalimab was performed in cynomolgus monkeys.   Following a single intravenous (IV) infusion of toripalimab for 30 minutes at doses up to 203 mg/kg to male and female cynomolgus monkeys (Smithers Avanza study no. 2352-13085), there was no effect on mortality, physical examinations, cageside observations, body weights, body weight changes, food consumption, or clinical pathology (clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis). The terminal half-life (t1/2) of toripalimab following the single IV dose was approximately 108 and 116 hours in male and female monkeys, respectively, dosed with 1 mg/kg and 256 hours in a female monkey dosed with 203 mg/kg toripalimab.  At Study Day (SD) 28, all

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 25 of 140 animals had antibodies to toripalimab and a confirmatory assay showed antibodies in all animals except a high dose female.  The presence of antibodies did not appear to affect the serum toripalimab levels as t1/2 was long in all animals. The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) is 203 mg/kg when administered once via IV infusion for 30 minutes to male and female cynomolgus monkeys. Following 30 minute IV infusions every 2 weeks (Q2W) over four weeks (total of three doses) of toripalimab at doses up to 100 mg/kg to male and female cynomolgus monkeys (Smithers Avanza study no. 2352-13086), there was no effect on mortality, physical examinations, cageside observations, body weights, body weight changes, food consumption, ophthalmic examination findings, electrocardiogram (ECG) evaluations, clinical pathology (clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis), gross pathology findings, absolute and relative organ weights, and histopathology findings.  Serum concentration-time profiles of toripalimab were characterized by a bi-phasic decline with time.  The serum concentration of toripalimab declined very slowly from serum following dosing, both on SD 1 and 29.  No gender difference was observed in the rate of decline; however, a dose-dependent slowing was observed with mostly higher maximum observed concentrations (Cmax) values on SD 15 and 29 indicating some accumulation at the higher doses from multiple dosing, consistent with higher residual serum concentrations in samples collected prior to dosing on SD 15 and SD 29.  Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were observed in most 1 and 10 mg/kg monkeys and persisted to the end of recovery while antibodies were only observed in 2/10 monkeys at 100 mg/kg and did not persist to recovery.  The NOAEL of toripalimab in male and female cynomolgus monkeys is 100 mg/kg when administered via 30 minute IV infusions Q2W over four weeks (total of three doses). Following IV infusions once a week over 26 weeks (total of 27 doses) of toripalimab at doses of 10, 30,  and 100 mg/kg to male and female cynomolgus monkeys (InnoStar study no. 1348RD2), there was no toripalimab-related adverse effects on in-life parameters, ophthalmic examination findings, safety pharmacology, clinical pathology (clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, urinalysis and analysis and fecal occult blood test), immune function parameters (immune-phenotype, complements, immunoglobulin and immune histological examination of the kidney), hormone analysis, macroscopic and microscopic findings. At 100 mg/kg level, the mean Cmax and AUC0-168h following the 26th dosing phase were 4.4 mg/mL and 431 mg•h/mL for males, and 5.03 mg/mL and 602 mg•h/mL for females, respectively. The dose of 100 mg/kg (every 1 week [Q1W] for 27 doses, mean AUC0-168.5h = 525944 μg•h/mL) was considered the NOAEL. The Maximum Recommended Safe Dose (MRSD) is considered to be 10 mg/kg (1/10 of NOAEL). The proposed human starting dose is 80 mg, about 1 mg/kg given an 80 kg average body weight of a patient, a

Furthermore, two FDA approved PD-1 blocking mAbs, Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) and Nivolumab (Opdivo®), were included as a positive control and compared with toripalimab in binding affinity assays and cytokine release assays. The study results showed none of the three agents induced cytokine release in unstimulated and pre-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), indicating a possible comparable safety profile.  1.4 Summary of Clinical Experience As of December 16, 2019, toripalimab has been administered to approximately 1241 subjects participating in a total of 27 Phase I-III clinical trials in China. In the United States, toripalimab has been administered to 109 subjects in 1 Phase I clinical trial. Refer to Section 5 of the IB for information on the effect of toripalimab in humans. Toripalimab was approved in China on 17 December 2018 for the treatment of patients with locally progressive or metastatic melanoma that have progressed after receiving standard treatment. The approved dose is 3 mg/kg Q2W. This update is based on the currently available pharmacokinetic (PK), efficacy and safety data of toripalimab, as well as on the types of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) obtained from summarization of safety data. This update covers the latest experience in clinical use of toripalimab to support its further clinical development.  Clinical trials of subjects with advanced solid tumors are ongoing or have been completed in China and include those for progressive or metastatic melanoma, mucosal melanoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma, recurrent refractory malignant lymphoma, NSCLC, triple-negative advanced breast cancer,  locally progressive or metastatic urothelial bladder carcinoma, advanced renal carcinoma, advanced neuroendocrine neoplasms, and high-risk recurrent hepatic carcinoma after radical surgery.   Several trials are also investigating combination therapy with toripalimab and: GP regimen (gemcitabine and cisplatin) in the treatment of advanced NPC; axitinib in subjects with advanced renal carcinoma and melanoma who failed standard care; pemetrexed and carboplatin for treating advanced or recurrent non-small-cell lung carcinoma. For further details see the IB. 1.4.1 Summary of Safety from Trials Performed in China Summary of the safety of monotherapy in Chinese subjects was based on 12 company sponsored studies. There were a total of 985 subjects, including melanoma (N=322), nasopharyngeal cancer (N=200), urothelial carcinoma (N=160), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (N=65), adenocarcinoma gastric (N=63), squamous cell carcinoma of head and

The administered doses were: 0.3 mg/kg (N=3), 1 mg/kg (N=39), 3 mg/kg (N=851), 10 mg/kg (N=31) and 240 mg (N=61).  In the 985 subjects, 964 subjects (97.9%) had at least one adverse event (AE), 928 subjects (94.2%) had study related AEs (if judged by investigators as positively related, probably related, possibly related or possibly unrelated, the causal relationship of the AE/serious adverse event [SAE] with the study drug was classified as related). The majority of subjects reported AEs of CTCAE grade 1-2. The study drug related AEs with the reporting rate ≥10% were anemia, elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), fever, hypothyroidism, weakness, elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), cough, rash, decreased appetite, pruritus, increased blood glucose, decreased white blood cell count and urine protein detected. The reporting rate of the AEs leading to termination of study drug was 13.6% (134 subjects), and 15.6% (154 subjects) for AEs leading to dose interruption of study drug. The reporting rate of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)≥ grade 3 AE was 40.3%; 302 subjects (30.7%) had CTCAE≥ grade 3 AE related to the study drug, where the reporting rate ≥1% was seen in anemia, hyponatremia, pulmonary infection and abnormal hepatic function. The reporting rate of SAEs was 22.9%; 161 subjects (16.3%) had study drug related SAEs, where the reporting rate ≥1% was seen in pulmonary infection and abnormal hepatic function.  In the 985 subjects, systematic immune-related adverse events (irAE) adjudication had been made in the 741 subjects receiving the recommended therapeutic dose (3 mg/kg or 240 mg) (not including CT8, CT14 and CT17). In the 741 subjects, 236 subjects (31.8%) had at least one category of irAE, the majority of which were grade 1-2. The most common irAE was hypothyroidism that occurred in 13.6% subjects. 1 subject died of interstitial pneumonia. Overall, the AEs observed in the pooled safety data were mainly abnormalities in various examinations, mostly grade 1-2 in severity, or consistent with the characteristics of underlying disease. The irAE profile was consistent with that reported for similar products and showed good tolerability. Overall, the AEs were manageable.  Refer to IB for detailed safety and clinical efficacy data on studies performed in China as well as the summary table of ADRs determined by company.  1.4.2 Safety Summary of Phase 1 Study in the United States (TAB001-01; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) Currently, one phase I study is ongoing for toripalimab in the United States (U.S.) (TAB001-01: a multicenter, open label, phase I clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAB001 in the subjects with advanced malignancies). The study includes two parts. Part A, the dose escalation phase, has been completed. A total of three

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 28 of 140 dose groups of 80 mg (3 subjects), 240 mg (8 subjects) and 480 mg (7 subjects) IV Q2W were set up, 18 subjects were enrolled, and 1 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) event (grade 3 myocarditis) occurred; Part B is the dose extension phase using the therapeutic dose of 240 mg IV Q3W, 280 subjects are expected to be enrolled. A total of 109 subjects were enrolled in Part A and Part B by 16 December 2019.  The DLT of myocarditis was also an SAE.  A blood test showing elevated troponin T was consistent with myocarditis.  The subject had received 2 doses of 480 mg toripalimab, the highest dose in the study. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart showed no evidence of myocarditis and a heart muscle biopsy did not show inflammation. The event was considered to be immune related and possibly related to toripalimab. Summary of safety from the phase I study in the U.S. was based on the 109 subjects who had received at least one dose of toripalimab. 104 (95.4%) subjects reported at least one AE during treatment, and 59 (54.1%) subjects reported AEs that were related to study drug. 56 (51.4%) subjects reported AEs with CTCAE ≥ grade 3, of which 17 (15.6%) were related to the study drug. For 5 (4.6%) subjects, the investigational product was interrupted due to an AE. For treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) reported in ≥10% of subjects, see Table 1.4.2-1.

The incidence of AEs does not appear to be dose related. The subjects will be continuously treated and monitored for safety and efficacy readouts (duration of response [DoR] and progression free survival[PFS]) until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. In addition to the specific risks identified in the current toripalimab studies in China and the United States, trials of other immune checkpoint inhibitors most frequently report iRAEs of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., colitis), endocrine glands (e.g., autoimmune thyroid and adrenal disease), hypophysitis, skin, and liver (e.g., autoimmune hepatitis) (Postow, et al., 2018).  To a lesser extent,  iRAEs involve the central nervous system (e.g., aseptic meningitis, transverse myelitis) and cardiovascular (e.g., myocarditis), pulmonary (e.g., pneumonitis), musculoskeletal (e.g., myositis and myasthenia gravis), and hematologic systems are involved (Postow, et al., 2018; Spain, et al., 2019). Because of the number of systems that may be involved, it is important to maintain a high index of suspicion for iRAEs and to refer subjects to the relevant specialists, such as a pulmonologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist, dermatologist, or rheumatologist.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 31 of 140 Refer to IB for detailed safety data from the TAB001-01 study performed in the U.S.  1.4.3 Summary of Pharmacokinetic Analyses A pooled PK analysis was performed by pooling the sample data of toripalimab in various dose groups (doses 0.3-10 mg/kg, as well as a fixed dose of 240 mg, Q2W) in three phase I dose- escalation clinical studies (CT1, CT2 and CT3). See Table 1.4.3-1 for the detailed parameters. The study results showed that after IV infusion of 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg to the clinical subjects, toripalimab basically presented linear PK characteristics and that after the dose increased to 10 mg/kg, the drug presented certain non-linear PK characteristics. The study results revealed that toripalimab showed an obvious "long-acting" characteristic of antibody drugs, with the plasma drug concentrations basically reaching a steady state after about 3 to 4 consecutive IV infusions of toripalimab to the clinical subjects, with mean half-life of 222.98±61.92 hours (9.29±2.58 days), Cmax of 77.17±47.3 μg/mL, and AUC(0-t) of 11635.89±7204.64, respectively, after multiple administrations in the 3 mg/kg group (n=37).

In vitro experiments demonstrated that when the

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 32 of 140 plasma concentration of toripalimab was >20 nM or 3 μg/ml, PD-1 receptors on the surface of T-cells could be saturated, and that given the limitation of the antibody’s macromolecules to enter the tumor microenvironment, the concentration of toripalimab in the peripheral blood was maintained at 20 μg/ml in order to ensure complete occupancy of lymphocyte PD- 1 in the tumor microenvironment. All Phase I studies showed that complete occupancy of PD-1 receptors could be maintained during the whole course of treatment in different dosage groups (0.3, 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg Q2W). The results of PK studies mentioned above and the resulting receptor occupancy (RO) data supported 3 mg/kg IV Q2W to be selected as the dose for the CT4 phase II key study (see Section 5.4 of the IB detailed information about the safety and efficacy of toripalimab). Two early studies explored a fixed dose of 240 mg IV every 3 weeks (Q3W). Of these two studies, a preliminary PK study involving 14 subjects revealed the peak steady-state plasma concentration and minimum steady-state plasma concentration at the dose of 240 mg Q3W (85 µg/mL and 21 µg/mL, respectively) are similar with those of 3 mg/kg Q2W (77 µg/mL and 25 µg/mL), which showed similar drug exposure and steady concentration and sufficient PD-1 RO. Those above results of toripalimab’s PK/RO and Phase II key studies about melanoma, support the fixed dose of toripalimab 240 mg IV Q3W to be used as the recommended dose in Part B of this study and in Phase III clinical studies. 1.4.4 Immunogenicity of toripalimab Use of any recombinant protein is associated with potential induction of local and systemic immune responses. Additional tests, for example, autoimmune serology or biopsies, should be used to monitor the production of ADA carefully to determine the probability of possible immunogenicity and the effect on subjects.  As of 1 May 2018, the pooled analysis on 518 subjects had shown the observation of ADA in subjects at the dose of 0.3-10 mg/kg and individual ADA positive rate of 15.4% in the subjects. The ADA positive rate observed was 18% in the 128 subjects with melanoma who received 3 mg/kg toripalimab injection. In accordance with PK and exposure-effect analysis, currently no evidence of loss of efficacy, change in the toxicity profile, or change in the PK profile was observed in the presence of ADA. No difference was observed in the efficacy and safety profile between the subjects with positive and negative ADA test results.  Based on the guideline for immunogenicity released by the U.S. FDA in January 2019, the serum matrix before administration from the subjects in the two phase II registration clinical studies for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (CT-5) and urothelial carcinoma (CT-12) and the blank matrix in humans constructed by the previous ADA test to validate the ADA positive threshold using analytical procedure were statistically analyzed in September 2019. The results showed a statistically significant difference in the response value between the two populations, thus the ADA positive threshold was reset for the serum matrix from the tested

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 33 of 140 subjects prior to administration in October 2019, and all the tested samples for relevant items were analyzed.  As of March 2020, in accordance with the new method for setting the ADA threshold, the ADA positivity rate observed in 190 subjects with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who received 3 mg/kg toripalimab injection was 3.7% and the ADA positivity rate was 6.6% in 151 subjects with urothelial carcinoma. The pooled analysis showed an ADA positivity rate of 5.0% in the 341 subjects with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma who received 3 mg/kg toripalimab injection. Currently, from the PK and exposure-effect analysis, no evidence of loss of efficacy, change in toxicity profile or change in the PK profile was observed in the presence of ADA, and no difference was observed in the efficacy and safety between the subjects with positive and negative ADA test results.  A neutralizing antibody (NAb) assay is currently being developed to evaluate the neutralizing activity of ADA positive samples. 1.4.5 Pharmacodynamics study of toripalimab in [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] The pharmacodynamic effect of toripalimab was evaluated by PD-1 RO on the target cell over the course of treatment using the flow cytometry analysis. Toripalimab bound to the target molecule PD-1 on activated T lymphocytes (CD3+ CD45RA-) with full occupancy in all subjects from three cohorts after the initial dose. The full RO (>80% RO) was maintained in all subjects throughout the study period of 84 days. 1.5 Rationale for the current Study A brief summary of the rationale for targeting PD-1 in oncology is provided below.  For a more comprehensive review of toripalimab pharmacology, PK, and toxicology data, please refer to the toripalimab IB. Blockade of the interaction between PD-1/PD-L1 has been demonstrated in non-clinical and clinical studies to enhance specific responses against tumors.  In murine studies of melanoma, breast, ovarian, lung, liver, pancreatic and colon cancers, blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 reduced tumor burden and improved survival (Blank, et al., 2004; Curiel, et al., 2004; Hirano, et al., 2005).  In humans, such blockade enhanced T cell responses against melanoma and leukemia (Fourcade, et al., 2010; Norde, et al., 2011).  A number of clinical trials have demonstrated that monoclonal anti-PD-1 antibodies show evidence of efficacy and adequate safety in melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and mismatch repair deficient tumors, including colorectal cancer (Ansell, et al., 2015; Asaoka, et al., 2015; Berger, et al., 2008; Borghaei, et al., 2015; Brahmer, et al., 2010; Brahmer, et al., 2015; Le, et al., 2015; Garon, et al., 2015; Hamid, et al., 2013; Larkin, et al., 2015; Motzer, et

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 34 of 140 al., 2015; Nghiem, et al., 2016; Robert, et al., 2015; Topalian, et al., 2012; Wolchok, et al., 2013).   While toripalimab has a high affinity and blocks interaction between PD-1 and its ligand, PD-L1, it differs from other such antibodies by demonstrating more prolonged binding to PD-1 (Refer to the IB for more details).  This raises the possibility of prolonged action of the drug in the tissues.  1.6 Rationale for Tumor Selection Blockade of PD-1 pathway by mAbs has been demonstrated in non-clinical and clinical studies to enhance specific T cell responses against a broad spectrum of human malignancies. Solid tumors have thus been selected for this dose-escalation study on the basis of unmet medical need. Selected cancer patients, including but not limited to advanced gastric cancer (GC), esophageal cancer (EC), cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular cancer (HCC), sarcomas, both chondrosarcoma  and soft tissue sarcoma (excluding leiomyosarcoma and including angiosarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and alveolar soft part sarcoma), neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) (excluding lung derived NET), NPC, or with the agreement of the Sponsor, other tumors will be enrolled for the expansion phase of the study, because of unmet medical need and evidence supporting the potential benefits to anti-PD-1 treatment. Patients with GC, EC, or gastroesophageal junction cancer (GEC) often present with advanced and metastatic stage disease, which has poor prognosis, limited treatment options and represent an important unmet medical need. Preliminary data from the phase I/II open-label study [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] for patients with GC/GEC receiving nivolumab monotherapy revealed an objective response rate of 12% (n = 7/58; 1 CR, 6 PR) and 12 patients (21%) with SD  demonstrating antitumor activity in these disease settings. (http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/160127-173).  Subsequent publication of the trial results confirmed the response rate: “Of 160 treated patients (59 with nivolumab 3 mg/kg, 49 with nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg, 52 with nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg), 79% had received two or more prior therapies. At the data cutoff, investigator-assessed objective response rates were 12% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5% to 23%), 24% (95% CI, 13% to 39%), and 8% (95% CI, 2% to 19%) in the three groups, respectively” (Jainjigian YY, et al., 2019).  Since toripalimab differs from other such antibodies in that the binding to PD-1 is more prolonged, as measured by the dissociation coefficient, GC/GEC continues to be investigated to gather more experience in the U.S. and is planned in Europe.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 35 of 140 NETs are heterogeneous and show diverse biologic and clinical behaviors, reflect primary tumor origin, type of neuroendocrine cell, and pathologic features (Kim, et al., 2016). NETs in the GI tract appear to be associated with different anatomical distributions in Western versus Eastern populations of the world. Most commonly NETs in the GI tract in the U.S. involve small intestine (38%), followed by the rectum (34%), colon (16%), stomach (11%), and unknown sites (1%). The average annual incidence of GI NETs in the U.S. is 2.5 cases per 100 000 per year, and an apparent recent increase in incidence may reflect increased identification of gastric and rectal NET cases. In Korea, the rectum (48%) is the most common location of GI tract NETs, followed by stomach (15%), pancreas (9%), colon (8%), small intestine (8%), liver (7%), appendix (3%), and biliary tract (2%). Everolimus, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, and sunitinib, a multiple receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor were approved for treatment of advanced, progressive, well-differentiated pNETs in 2011 (Liu, et al., 2016). In 2016. for everolimus, the indication  was expanded to encompass advanced, well-differentiated, non-functional gastrointestinal and lung NETs. Ongoing trials for NETs continue to investigate the clinical activity and therapeutic potential of other drugs, including other RTK and mTOR pathway inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Evidence from several clinical trials suggests some response to anti-PD-1 monotherapy in terms of Karnofsky Functional Status (KFS) scores and stable disease, and a number of trials are investigating combination therapies (Chauhan, et al., 2017). A trial of toripalimab (Title: A Trial of JS001 in Patients with Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors; Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]) enrolled chemotherapy refractory NET patients in China (Lu M, et al., 2020). Of 40 patients, 8 partial responses and 6 with stable disease were observed with a 20% objective response rate (ORR) and a 35% disease control rate (DCR). The median DOR was 15.2 months. Patients with PD-L1 expression (≥10%) or high tumor mutational burden (TMB) had better ORR than PD-L1 <10% (50.0% vs. 10.7%, P ¼ 0.019) and TMB-low patients (75.0% vs. 16.1%, P ¼ 0.03). Three of 8 (37.5%) responders had ARID1A mutations, whereas only 1 of 27 nonresponders had mutations (P ¼ 0.03). Notably, 1 exceptional responder with TMB-L, microsatellite stable (MSS), and PD-L1–negative had multiple genomic arrangements with high prediction score for neoantigens. The authors concluded that toripalimab showed antitumor activity and had acceptable safety in treating recurrent or metastatic NETs. Patients with positive PD-L1 expression, TMB-H (top 10%), and/or microsatellite instability (MSI-H) might preferentially benefit from the treatment. The genomic mutation of ARID1A and high genomic rearrangements might be correlated with clinical benefit. Based on some evidence of response to anti-PD-1 monotherapy, the results of the clinical trial in China and differences in the spectrum of disease in Asia versus the U.S., and the sparsity of data for the treatment of NETs further investigation is planned with toripalimab.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 36 of 140 Hepatobiliary malignancies represent 13% of cancers worldwide, and 3% of cancer mortality in the United States. Cholangiocarcinoma is the second most common primary hepatic cancer and the most frequent among biliary tract cancers and has a very poor prognosis (Blechacz, 2017).  Only surgery appears to have the potential curative outcomes, but the disease tends to be diagnosed late, and recurrences are frequent after resection.  Liver transplantation alone is not recommended because of high recurrence rates and 20% survival rate, but neoadjuvant radiation and chemotherapy decreases recurrence rates and increases 5 year survival.  While cholangiocarcinoma has tended to be considered resistant to chemotherapy, the addition of cisplatin and erlotinib to gemcitabine therapy has been associated with better responses.  Immune checkpoint inhibitors are being investigated as treatments for cholangiocarcinoma, and pembrolizumab has been approved for all refractory mismatch repair (MMR)–deficient cancers, including cholangiocarcinoma (Le, et al., 2017).  In the KEYNOTE 028 study, cholangiocarcinomas showed a 17% response rate with a median response duration of 40 weeks.  While there is a high unmet medical need for treatments for cholangiocarcinoma, data on immune checkpoint inhibitors for this disease are still sparse, and further investigations are warranted to clarify the role of anti-PD-1 therapy.   HCC is a major health problem and worldwide is the second leading cause of cancer-related death.  Immunotherapy seems suitable as a possible treatment for HCC since it is seen in the setting of chronic hepatic inflammation, such as in individuals infected with hepatitis B or C and those with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Brown, et al., 2017). This inflammation encourages oncogenesis and often results in immunogenic lesions. Specific gene mutations result in the expression of tumor-associated antigens and neo-antigens which become targets for the immune system.  Several clinical trials showed that immune checkpoint inhibitors have promise in the treatment of HCC. Adverse events from checkpoint inhibitors are associated with induction of autoimmunity, including hepatitis and transaminitis. Although patients with HCC treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors show increased AST/ALT in comparison with melanoma and NSCLC patients, a safety study by Brown, et al., found that this was not associated with patients discontinuing therapy or deaths attributed to drug toxicity.  Patients with unresectable, recurrent, and/or metastatic high grade soft-tissue sarcoma and chondrosarcoma who progress after systemic therapy have limited treatment options. In the phase II open-label study [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], sarcoma patients received pembrolizumab after failure of prior systemic therapy (Tawbi, et al., 2017).  In this 86-patient single-arm study, there were two cohorts, soft-tissue sarcoma or bone sarcoma.  In each cohort, pembrolizumab which is a mAb to target PD-1 was received by 42 patients of whom 40 were evaluable. Median follow-up was 17·8 months (IQR 12·3-19·3). Of 40 patients with soft-tissue sarcoma, 7 (18%) showed an OR, including 4 (40%) of 10 patients with undifferentiated

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 37 of 140 pleomorphic sarcoma, 2 (20%) of 10 patients with liposarcoma, and 1 (10%) of 10 patients with synovial sarcoma. No patients with leiomyosarcoma (n=10) had an OR. Of 40 patients with bone sarcoma, 2 (5%) had an OR, including 1 (5%) of 22 patients with osteosarcoma and 1 (20%) of 5 patients with chondrosarcoma. Of 13 patients with Ewing's sarcoma, none had an OR. The authors concluded that while the primary endpoint of overall response was not met for either cohort, pembrolizumab appeared to show activity in patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma or dedifferentiated liposarcoma.  In addition, as seen for leiomyosarcoma in the above study by Tawbi, et al., in a phase 2, single center, single agent study of 12 patients, nivolumab which is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody to target PD-1 did not demonstrate benefit in a cohort of previously treated advanced uterine leiomyosarcoma patients (Ben-Ami, et al., 2017).  As of May 2020, in the current TAB001-01 study, responses for `undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas and to a greater extent angiosarcoma have been encouraging.  Of 6 subjects with angiosarcoma, 5 were evaluable, and the best responses for 3 of those subjects were partial response (PR) (60%).  Four subjects with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma were evaluable and 1 had an initial PR (25%) and was still in follow up.  Angiosarcoma is rare, accounts for less than 2% of all soft tissue sarcomas, and mainly affects adult and elderly patients (Cao J, et al., 2019). It is an aggressive malignant tumor that arises from lymphatic or vascular endothelial cells. Angiosarcomas most frequently occur as cutaneous lesions (about 60% of cases), particularly the head and neck, may present within the soft tissues, visceral organs, bone and retroperitoneum. Angiosarcoma has a high rate of local recurrence and metastasis. Advanced/metastatic disease at presentation occurs in 16 to 44% of patients, and overall survival (OS) ranges from 6 to 16 months.  Risk factors include chronic lymphoedema, history of radiation, environmental carcinogens and certain familial syndromes. Conventional options of treatment include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Targeted therapeutic agents and immunotherapy have been studied as promising treatments of angiosarcoma. A Phase 1 clinical trial of toripalimab conducted in China, included 12 patients with chemo-refractory advanced alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) and responses were promising (Yang, et al., 2020).  Of these patients, 1 showed a complete response (CR), 2 showed PRs, and 8 showed SD.  The ORR was 25.0% (3/12) and the DCR was 91.7% (11/12). The responses were durable, as the median progression free survival (PFS) and the median overall survival (OS) were 11.1 month and 34.7 month, respectively. Alveolar soft part sarcoma is rare (Jaber, et al., 2015).  Mostly it arises in lower limb soft tissues in adults and in children in the head and neck region. Usually it presents as a slowly growing mass or as metastatic disease. ASPS is a rare neoplasm, about 0.2% to 0.9% of all soft tissue sarcomas occurring mostly in those between ages 15 to 35 years; it is rare in patients less than 5 years of age those older

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 38 of 140 than 50 years. Females are more frequently affected than males with a 2:1 ratio in the first 3 decades of life but after that a slight male predominance is seen (Jaber, et al., 2015). ASPS has a high frequency of metastasis that may occur before the primary tumor is noted (Jaber, et al., 2015). In 20% to 30% of patients the tumor recurs locally. Prognosis depends on whether the initial presentation is localized or metastatic, as well as age and tumor size. The 5-year survival rate for localized disease at presentation is 71%, compared with 20% for patients with metastatic disease at time of diagnosis. Large tumors are most likely to be associated with metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Given the safety profile of toripalimab is similar to that of other anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies, the responses seen for angiosarcoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas in the current trial and the promising results of another toripalimab clinical trial showing a high response rate for subjects with ASPS, the sarcoma cohort was expanded to enroll an additional 40 subjects focusing on these sarcoma subtypes.  In addition, there is a high unmet medical need for treatments of these rare tumors.  Patients with unresectable and/or recurrent NPC who progress after radiation therapy have limited treatment options and represent an important unmet medical need. NPC patients have been reported to have a high percentage of PD-L1 expression (>60%) by multiple studies, indicating potential implication of PD-1 blockade in treating these patients (Zhang, et al., 2015; Chang, et al., 2017; Zhang, et al., 2008).  As a result, patients with GC, EC, cholangiocarcinoma, NETs (excluding lung derived NET), sarcomas, both chondrosarcoma and soft tissue sarcoma (excluding leiomyosarcoma and including angiosarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and ASPS), HCC, and NPC, as well as other indications where PD-1 is thought to play a role in tumor immune evasion, may be enrolled in this toripalimab clinical trial. 1.7 Rationale for Dose The rationale for the proposed Phase 1 starting dose has taken into account all relevant preclinical pharmacology and toxicology data, including calculated and experimentally measured receptor occupancy, dose-response in human cell-based assays, and pharmacodynamic evaluations conducted in conjunction with the toxicology studies, as well as the safety profiles and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved clinical dose of similar drugs targeting the same molecule.  As a starting point, the guidelines presented in the FDA Guidance for Industry Estimating the Maximum Safe Starting Dose in Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy Volunteers were used.  The NOAEL determined in the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 39 of 140 compliant repeat-dose toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys was 100 mg/kg (the highest dose level tested).  Toripalimab is not pharmacologically active in rodent species and therefore rodent toxicology studies were not performed.  Since toripalimab is a protein administered IV with a molecular weight > 100 kDa, mg/kg scaling was used, and the human-equivalent dose (HED) was determined to be 100 mg/kg.  A default safety factor of 10 is appropriate, as there are no considerations indicating a safety concern that warrants increasing the safety factor.  Based on this analysis, the MRSD is considered to be 10 mg/kg (1/10 of NOAEL). The proposed human starting dose is 80 mg, about 1 mg/kg given an average patient weight of 80 kg, a dose that is 10-fold lower than the MRSD.  Furthermore, commercially purchased Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) and Nivolumab (Opdivo®) had been included as positive controls and compared with toripalimab in binding affinity assays and in vitro cytokine release assays. The study results showed none of the three agents induced cytokine release in unstimulated and pre-activated human PBMCs, indicating a possible comparable safety profile.  Based on literature reports and data obtained from other anti-PD-1 products, there is no clear relationship between body size and PK or efficacy/safety at the therapeutic dose. Given the clinical experience, the proposed starting dose of 80 mg, about 1 mg/kg, would not pose unreasonable risk on patients. We therefore propose a flat starting dose of 80 mg in this study.   Toripalimab has been administered to humans in 26 trials in China and 1 trial (TAB001-01) in the United States as of Dec 2019. One phase I study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) conducted at Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, was a 3+3 dose-escalation study treating Malignant Lymphoma. The dose-escalation cohorts are 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg biweekly (Q2W) via IV infusion. Any dose-escalation cohort that did not exceeded the MTD could be expanded up to a maximum of 3 subjects at each dose level for further evaluation of safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy. The first subject was enrolled on 5 Sep 2017 and last subject enrolled on 2 Dec 2017.  The study has enrolled a total of 13 subjects, 4 subjects in the 1 mg/kg cohort, 3 subjects in the 3 mg/kg cohort and 6 subjects in the 10 mg/kg cohort.  See Section 1.4 for details regarding study [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]. From the Phase I toripalimab dose escalation study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), toripalimab was well tolerated in up to 10 mg/kg Q2W. No DLT or death has occurred. 100% of subjects had TEAEs, but the majority of AEs were of Grade 1 or 2. The spectrum of AEs is similar to approved drugs in the same class without novel safety signals. The observed serum half-life of toripalimab was 16.4 to 18.1 days after five consecutive Q2W doses of 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg. 1 out of 13 subjects had an ADA positive sample(s) identified after dosing. The trough concentration of toripalimab after 6 doses were 10.08±5.69, 40.09±26.95 and 209.24±23.73

saturation binding and blocking effect on PD-1 was achieved when toripalimab concentration 
was no less than 2.9 µg/mL (See IB, page 30 for details). Consistent with the in vitro 
blocking study, toripalimab bound to the target molecule PD -1 on PBMC with full 
occupancy in all subjects from three cohorts after the initial dose. The full receptor

AEs or clinical response does not appear to be dose related.  Given the favorable safety and 
efficacy profile of the Phase I toripalimab study [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] and observed long half-life 
of toripalimab, upon the completion of the current dose escalation study (TAB001 -01) at 80 
mg, 240 mg and 480 mg fixed dose Q2W, we plan to explore the intermediate dose of 240 
mg Q3W in the expansion phase for further safety and efficacy evaluation.  
2 OBJECTIVES  AND ENDPOINTS 
2.1 Objectives  
2.1.1 Primary Objectives 
• Dose-escalation phase: To assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of 
toripalimab and define the MTD or the maximum feasib le dose (MFD) (highest protocol-
defined dose of toripalimab in the absence of exceeding the MTD) in subjects with 
advanced malignancies . 
• Dose-expansion phase: To further characterize the safety profile of toripalimab in 
subjects with selected advanced malignancies, and to evaluate the recommended Phase 2 
Dose (RP2D). 
2.1.2 Secondary Objectives 
• To describe the PK profile of toripalimab  
• To evaluate antitumor activity of toripalimab

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  42 of 140 3 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 Description of the Study  
3.1.1 Overview  
This Phase 1, open-label, 2-part (Part A = dose-escalation, Part B = dose-expansion) study to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and antitumor activity of toripalimab 
administered IV on a Q2W (Part A) or Q3W (Part B) dosing schedule in adult subjects with advanced solid malignancies that are refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard 
therapy exists.  In Part A, a cycle is 28 days (4 weeks) which includes toripalimab being administered IV Q2W. In Part B, a cycle is 42 days (6 weeks) which includes toripalimab being administered IV Q3W. 
3.1.2 Part A – Dose Escalation 
Part A will use a 3+3 design and will enroll cohorts of 3-6 subjects sequentially at escalating 
doses of 80 mg, 240 mg and 480 mg.  Subjects will receive their assigned dose Q2W (± 2 
days) in the absence of confirmed progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of 
consent, intercurrent illness preventing further administration of toripalimab, or the 
investigator considers it in the best interest of a subject to discontinue study treatment. A 
protocol amendment will be submitted to the FDA if there are any changes in dose levels and dosing frequency. 
Dose escalation will continue up to a flat dose of 480 mg or until identification of a MTD or 
the MFD. Up to a total of 18 immunotherapy-naïve subjects (no prior exposure to immunotherapy such as but not limited to other anti -CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, or anti-PD-L1 
antibodies excluding vaccines) may be enrolled in Part A.   
3.1.3 Part B – Dose Expansion 
In Part B, up to 280 subjects with  solid tumors including but not limited to esophageal or 
gastric carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, NETs (excluding lung derived NET), sarcomas, both 
chondrosarcoma and soft tissue sarcoma (excluding leiomyosarcoma and including angiosarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and ASPS ), or with agreement of the 
Sponsor, other tumors, including NPC and HCC, that have been treated with at least one line 
of therapy in the metastatic setting  will be enrolled. Patients with microsatellite instability -
high (MSI-H)/ mismatch repair deficient ( dMMR) tumors are eligible to enroll. 
The dose(s) to be evaluated in Part B will be 240 mg administered IV Q3W after review of 
safety, PK and pharmacodynamic data from subjects treated with TAB001.  A maximum of 
40 subjects can be enrolled in each cohort with the exception of the sarcoma cohort, in which 
TopAlliance Biosciences, Inc. Protocol TAB001-01   Version 7.0 Toripalimab Injection          25 June 2020 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 43 of 140 a maximum of 80 subjects can be enrolled.  Enrollment will consist of solid tumors that may include but will not be limited to esophageal and gastric carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, NETs (excluding lung derived NET), sarcomas, both chondrosarcoma and soft tissue sarcoma (excluding leiomyosarcoma and including angiosarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and ASPS), or with agreement of the Sponsor, other tumors, including NPC and HCC, that have been treated with at least one line of therapy in the metastatic setting. After 40 subjects have been enrolled in the sarcoma cohort, a further 40 subjects will be enrolled and will be limited to angiosarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and alveolar soft part sarcoma. Patients with MSI-H/dMMR tumors are eligible to enroll. Subjects will receive their assigned dose IV Q3W until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, intercurrent illness preventing further administration of toripalimab, or the investigator considers it in the best interest of a subject to discontinue study therapy. 3.1.4 Treatment Regimen All subjects will be evaluated regularly, and their clinical status classified according to RECIST v1.1 and irRECIST (http://www.irrecist.com/).  If feasible, all subjects will be followed for PFS and OS (Part B only) until the end of the study, defined as the date of the last protocol-specified visit/assessment (including telephone contact), or the date the study is closed by the sponsor, whichever comes first. AEs and SAEs will be followed from the start of the first dose of toripalimab through 90 days after the last dose of toripalimab. For subjects who receive another experimental or anticancer therapy, only related AE/SAEs will be collected through 90 days after the last dose of study drug. In Part A, radiological assessment of tumor response status must be performed approximately every 8 weeks (± 10 days) for the first 12 months and approximately every 12 weeks (± 10 days) thereafter, unless the Investigator determines it is more appropriate to continue the radiological assessments on an approximately 8 week frequency. In Part B, radiological assessment of tumor response status must be performed approximately every 9 weeks (± 10 days) for the first 12 months and approximately every 18 weeks (± 10 days) thereafter, unless the Investigator determines it is more appropriate to continue the radiological assessments on an approximately 9 week frequency. Subjects will be monitored for safety, PK, anti-toripalimab antibodies and clinical activity as outlined in Section 4.2.  Serum samples will be collected to screen for changes in markers of immune response and determine whether changes in serum markers are predictive of response and/or reflective of pharmacodynamic response.  In Part A, fresh pre-treatment biopsies will be requested from subjects with safely accessible lesions.  For subjects who

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 44 of 140 cannot provide a fresh pre-treatment biopsy, an archival specimen will be required.  In Part B, fresh pre-treatment biopsies will be required from all subjects with safely accessible lesions.  Archival specimens will be requested. Biopsies results from materials specifically obtained for the study will not affect eligibility.  However, the biopsy report upon which the diagnosis was based should be in the subject’s medical record. The study will be conducted at up to 30 centers in the U.S.. 3.1.5 Treatment Regimen Subjects will be treated in either Part A or Part B of the study.  Subjects will receive toripalimab IV Q2W (Part A) or Q3W (Part B) until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, intercurrent illness preventing further administration of toripalimab, or the investigator considers it in the best interest of a subject to discontinue study therapy. Toripalimab will be administered IV over a minimum of 60 minutes.  In subsequent cycles, the infusion time may be reduced to a minimum of 30 minutes depending upon subject tolerance.  The infusion duration may be increased at any time at the discretion of the investigator. Refer to Section 4.8 for a description of toripalimab dose calculation, preparation, and administration. Toripalimab may be administered in the setting of progressive disease (PD) as long as all of the following criteria are met: • Absence of clinical symptoms or signs indicating clinically significant disease progression • No decline in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status from baseline • Absence of rapid disease progression or threat to vital organs or critical anatomical sites (e.g., CNS metastasis, respiratory failure due to tumor compression, spinal cord compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention; no significant, unacceptable or irreversible toxicities related to study treatment.  These subjects would continue on to the next regulatory scheduled visit and thereafter as per the Schedule of Evaluations.  However, a repeat scan to assess for true disease progression in 4 weeks ± 2 days in Part A and in 6 weeks ± 2 days in Part B is required. It is also required that any subject with pending organ compromise be discontinued from the toripalimab treatment.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 45 of 140 If feasible, all subjects will be followed for PFS and OS (Part B only) until the end of the study, defined as the date of the last protocol-specified visit/assessment (including telephone contact), or the date the study is closed by the sponsor, whichever comes first.  3.1.6 Dose-escalation Design 3.1.6.1 General Dose Escalation and De-escalation Rules  Rules for dose escalation and de-escalation are as follows: 1. A minimum of 3 subjects will be enrolled in each dose cohort. 2. The administration of toripalimab to the first and second subjects of each cohort will be separated by at least 24 hours.  3. All safety data will be reviewed by a study-specific dose-escalation committee (including, but not limited to, the sponsor medical monitor or designee, and participating principal investigator’s or designees) before proceeding with an escalation or de-escalation decision.  All decisions from the committee will be documented and shared with each participating principal investigator. 4. A 3+3 dose-escalation design will be followed as summarized below: a. If 0 out of the 3 subjects in a dose cohort experience a DLT during the DLT evaluation period, dose escalation may proceed to the next planned cohort with approval of the dose-escalation committee.  b. If 1 of the 3 subjects in any dose cohort experiences a DLT during the DLT evaluation period, that dose cohort will be expanded to a total of 6 subjects.  If no more than 1 of 6 subjects in the dose cohort experiences a DLT, dose escalation may proceed to the next planned dose cohort(s) with the approval of the dose-escalation committee. c. If 2 or more subjects in a dose cohort experience a DLT during the DLT evaluation period, the MTD will have been exceeded and no further subjects will be enrolled into that dose cohort.  A previous lower-dose cohort or an intermediate-dose cohort may be explored based on the recommendation of the dose-escalation committee. 5. Any cohort that has not exceeded the MTD can be expanded up to a maximum of 10 subjects for further evaluation of safety and efficacy. 6. Intrasubject dose escalation will not be allowed.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 46 of 140 3.1.6.2 Dose-limiting Toxicity DLTs will be evaluated in each cohort in Part A.  The period for evaluating DLTs will be defined as the time period starting with the first dose of toripalimab until the planned administration of the third dose of toripalimab.  Subjects are considered evaluable for DLT if they receive the protocol-assigned dose(s) of toripalimab and complete the safety follow-up through the end of the DLT evaluation period, or experience a DLT during the DLT evaluation period.  Any subject who experiences a DLT will receive no further toripalimab (see Section 4.1.5 Withdrawal Criteria).  Subjects who do not remain on the study up to this time for reasons other than DLT will be replaced with another subject at the same dose level.  Grading of DLTs will be according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v4.03. A DLT will be defined as all Grade 3 or higher adverse events that occur during the DLT evaluation period that are at least possibly related to toripalimab, including but not limited to: • Neutropenic fever, regardless of grade • Grade 4 neutropenia lasting > 7 days • Increase in ALT or AST to > 3 x ULN with concurrent increase in bilirubin to > 2 x ULN • Any Grade ≥ 3 enterocolitis • Grade 4 thrombocytopenia of any duration • Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding • Any Grade 4 irAE or non-irAE irrespective of duration  • Any Grade 3 or 4 noninfectious pneumonitis irrespective of duration • Any Grade 3 irAE including rash, pruritus, or diarrhea that does not downgrade to ≤ Grade 2 within 7 days after onset of the event despite maximal supportive care including systemic corticosteroids • Any ≥ Grade 2 pneumonitis that does not resolve to ≤ Grade 1 within 14 days of the initiation of maximal supportive care The definition excludes the following conditions:  • Grade 3 fatigue or nausea for ≤ 7 days

Delayed DLTs will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis upon consultation between the sponsor and the PI.  At minimum, a review and discussion of potential delayed DLTs will take place at each safety review prior to a dose escalation decision (i.e., approximately every 6-8 weeks).  Factors taking into account whether these AEs constitute a delayed DLT include the emerging safety profile of toripalimab, whether the AE meets the definition of a DLT as defined above including duration of the event and response to intervening therapy, and clear determination of whether there is a well-documented alternative explanation for the toxicity observed.  In the event that the delayed DLT constitutes a laboratory based toxicity not associated with clinical signs or symptoms, confirmation of the laboratory results will be obtained and DLT determination will be evaluated in light of the clinical benefit of toripalimab to the subject. Once the documented AE has been designated a delayed DLT, by the sponsor and PI, the same rules of reporting as that for DLTs described in Section 5.7.1 will be followed. The impact of a delayed DLT on the dose-escalation cohort will follow the rules outlined in Section 3.1.6.  If a higher dose is under evaluation (relative to the dose cohort where a delayed DLT was noted), further enrollment in the higher dose cohort will be held pending outcome of the evaluation of the lower dose cohort.  Subjects who are tolerating study drug at the higher dose level may be allowed to continue treatment provided the PI believes there is a favorable benefit-risk and there is agreement with the sponsor. All subjects will be evaluated regularly, and their clinical status classified according to RECIST v1.1 and irRECIST (http://www.irrecist.com/).  If feasible, all subjects will be

AEs and SAEs will be followed from the start of the first dose of toripalimab through 90 days after the last dose of toripalimab unless a subject receives another experimental or anticancer therapy, at which time only related AE/SAEs will be collected through 90 days after the last dose of toripalimab.  The endpoints to be measured in this study are described in Section 2.2. 3.1.7 Management of Study Related Toxicities Management of study related toxicities will be the same for Part A and Part B of this study. 3.1.7.1 Toripalimab Dose Modifications Following the first dose of toripalimab, subsequent administration of toripalimab can be modified based on toxicities observed as described in Table 3.1.7-1.  All toxicities will be graded according to NCI-CTCAE v4.03.  Dose modifications will not be required for AEs that are clearly not attributed to toripalimab (such as an accident) or for laboratory abnormalities that are not deemed to be clinically  Table 3.1.7-1: Toripalimab Dose Modification Due to Toxicity Severity Immune-related Adverse Events (irAEs) a All Other Events b

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 51 of 140 3.1.7.2 Management of Immune-related Adverse Events Based on the mechanism of action (MOA) of toripalimab leading to T-cell activation and proliferation, there is the possibility of observing irAEs during the conduct of this study. Optimal strategies to monitor the immune related toxicities are evolving, and therefore, subjects receiving toripalimab should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of irAEs.  In the absence of alternate etiology (e.g., infection or PD), signs or symptoms of enterocolitis, pneumonitis, transaminitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathies should be considered immune-mediated.  The management guidelines summarized in Table 3.1.7-2, Management of Immune-related Adverse Events will provide guidance to investigators on the management and recommended interventions to prevent morbidity and mortality of these rare immune-related toxicities.  Immune-Related Colitis Toripalimab can cause immune-mediated colitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids with no clear alternate etiology. Immune-related colitis shares some characteristics with inflammatory bowel disease but with little specificity. Signs and symptoms of colitis may include diarrhea (loose stools) or more bowel movements than usual, blood in stools or dark, tarry, sticky stools.  The investigator will handle AEs (diarrhea and colitis) according to local standard procedure or follow the recommendations listed in Table 3.1.7-3.  Immune-Related Hepatitis Toripalimab can cause immune-mediated hepatitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids and no clear alternate etiology. Signs and symptoms of hepatitis may include transaminase elevation, total bilirubin elevation, jaundice, severe nausea or vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, drowsiness, dark urine (tea colored), bleeding or bruising more easily than normal, and decreased appetite. The investigator will handle immune-related hepatic AEs according to local standard procedure or follow the recommendations listed in Table 3.1.7-4.  The administration of any recombinant protein has the potential to induce local and systemic immunologic reactions. Subjects will be carefully monitored for the formation of ADA.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 53 of 140 3.1.7.3 Management of Toripalimab-related Toxicities Infusion-related Reactions Infusion-related reactions may manifest with symptoms such as fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruritus, arthralgia, hypo- or hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms.  In order to promptly treat infusion-related reactions, it is recommended that treatment medications be prepared prior to the start of the infusion and placed within easy access of the bedside along with standing orders for the treatment of infusion related reactions. Once symptoms of an infusion reaction occur (e.g., sense of feeling cold, chills, rigors, fever, neck pain, nausea), the infusion should be interrupted, and the subject should be assessed for other signs or symptoms (e.g., hypotension, hypoxia, wheezing, urticaria) suggestive of a more serious reaction. Medications used to treat an infusion reaction will be at the discretion of the investigator. Sites should follow the guidelines in Table 3.1.7-1 for medical management of the actual infusion (i.e., reducing the infusion rate or stopping the infusion based on symptoms the subject is eliciting). As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible.  Therefore, appropriate drugs and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available, and study personnel must be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis. See Table 3.1.7-1 for management guidelines by event severity. Liver Chemistry Testing Procedures The procedures listed below are to be followed if a subject meets the criteria for treatment discontinuation based on elevations in transaminases or total bilirubin as defined in Table 3.1.7-1 or any of the other criteria defined below.  They do not apply if a subject develops liver chemistry abnormalities as a result of progressive disease. Medical Management of Liver Chemistry Event If a subject meets any of the criteria for treatment discontinuation based on elevations in transaminases or total bilirubin as defined in Table 3.1.7-1, do the following: • Immediately withdraw the subject from further administration of toripalimab.  • Within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence, report the event to TopAlliance Biosciences Patient Safety representative as a SAE, notify the medical monitor of the

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 54 of 140 abnormality, confirm the subject has discontinued toripalimab, and appropriate follow-up has been arranged. • Complete the Liver Event Follow-up Assessments listed below, especially the autoimmune work-up. • Upon completion of the safety follow-up, permanently withdraw the subject from treatment and do not rechallenge with toripalimab.  • Follow procedures for stopping the study (See Section 3.1.8). In addition, for subjects experiencing ALT ≥ 3 × ULN and bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN (> 35% direct bilirubin) (or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN and international normalized ratio (INR) > 1.5) that was not present at baseline because of existing liver metastases or HCC which allow for ALT≤5) and is not attributable to tumor progression: • Make every reasonable attempt to have subjects return to the clinic within 24 hours for repeat liver chemistries and additional testing. • Close monitoring including specialist or hepatology consultation is recommended.  • Monitor subjects until liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin) resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline values. Liver Event Follow-up Assessments For subjects that meet study stopping criteria based on liver function abnormalities (Section 3.1.8), make every attempt to carry out the liver event follow-up assessments described below: • Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-smooth muscle antibody, and Type 1 anti-liver kidney microsomal antibodies. • Obtain viral hepatitis serology testing including: ◦ Hepatitis A Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody ◦ Hepatitis B surface antigen and Hepatitis B core antibody (IgM) ◦ Hepatitis C ribonucleic acid (RNA) • Assess eosinophilia • Liver imaging (ultrasound, magnetic resonance, or computerized tomography) to evaluate liver disease.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  61 of 140 4.1.4 Subject Enrollment  
Study participation begins (i.e., a subject is “enrolled”) once a subject receives the first dose 
of study drug.  Once informed consent is obtained, a screening number will be assigned by 
the site and the screening evaluations may begin to assess study eligibility (inclusion  / 
exclusion) criteria.  Once a subject is enrolled, a subject identification number (SID) will be assigned by .  
A master log of all consented subjects will be maintained at the site and will document all screen failures (i.e., subjects who are consented but do not meet study eligibility criteria) , 
including the reason(s) for screen failure.  
Once subjects are screened and determined by the PI to be eligible, the investigational site will complete an enrollment form and forward the completed document to  to 
request enrollment into the study.   will designate the part of the study the 
subject will enroll into (Part A [dose-escalation] or Part B [expansion]) and the cohort number.  The medical monitor may request to review the subject’s medical chart to ensure they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
Subjects who fail to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria (i.e., screen failures) may be 
rescreened and will maintain their same screening number. Subjects can be rescreened 3 
times.  
TAB001-01 is a competitive enrollment study. Up to 30 sites will be participating in 
TAB001-01 in the United States and up to 15 sites will be participating in TAB001-01 in Europe. The anticipated accrual per site is approximately 6 subjects; howeve r, given the 
tumor types of interest, the actual enrollment rate per site will vary.  
4.1.5 Withdrawal Criteria 
Permanent discontinuation of toripalimab: In Part A and Part B, an individual subject will not receive any further toripalimab if any of the following occur in the subject in question: 
• Withdrawal of consent from the study 
• Withdrawal of consent from further treatment with toripalimab 
• Lost to follow-up  
• An AE that, in the opinion of the investigator or the sponsor, contraindicates further 
dosing  
• Any AE that meets criteria for discontinuation as defined in Section 3.1.7 
• Dose-limiting toxicity (see Section 3.1.6.2 for definition of a DLT)

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 62 of 140 • Subject is determined to have met one or more of the exclusion criteria for study participation at study entry and continuing toripalimab might constitute a safety risk  • Pregnancy or intent to become pregnant  • Subject noncompliance that, in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor, warrants withdrawal (e.g., refusal to adhere to scheduled visits) • Initiation of alternative anticancer therapy including another investigational agent Subjects who are permanently discontinued from further receipt of toripalimab, regardless of the reason (withdrawal of consent, due to an AE, other), will be identified as having permanently discontinued treatment.  Subjects who permanently discontinue treatment may either be considered to have completed the study or not to have completed the study (see Section 6.3). Subjects who are permanently discontinued from receiving toripalimab will continue on study to complete their End of Treatment and 90-day Post Treatment visits and will be followed for safety per Section 5.4.1 and Section 5.5, including the collection of any protocol-specified blood specimens, unless consent is withdrawn or the subject is lost to follow-up or enrolled in another clinical study.  If feasible, all subjects will be followed for progression free survival.  A subject who receives another experimental or anticancer therapy will not continue on the study. All visits will cease.  Only related AEs/SAEs will be collected through 90 days after the last dose of toripalimab, as noted in Section 5.4.1. Withdrawal of consent: If consent is withdrawn, the subject will not receive any further toripalimab or further study observation.  Note that the subject may be offered additional tests to withdraw safely. Lost to follow-up: Subjects will be considered lost to follow-up only if no contact has been established by the time the study is completed (as defined in Section 6.3), such that there is insufficient information to determine the subject’s status at that time. Note: Subjects who refuse continuing participation in the study, including phone contact, should be documented as “withdrawal of consent” rather than “lost to follow-up.”  Subjects would be considered lost to follow-up after 3 documented unsuccessful attempts in 3 months. Investigators should document attempts to re-establish contact with missing subjects.  If contact with a missing subject is re-established, the subject should not be considered lost to follow-up. If the interruption was < 4 weeks, the subject may resume therapy in the next cycle and any evaluations should resume according to the protocol. If the interruption is ³ 4

visit if applicable. 
4.1.6 Replacement of Subjects 
Subjects are considered evaluable if they complete the first imaging evaluation or they 
discontinue toripalimab due to a DLT.  Nonevaluable subjects may be replaced in the same 
dose cohort.  
4.1.7 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for Data and Biological Samples 
4.1.7.1 Biological Samples Obtained for the Main Study 
Study data are protected by the us e of an SID number, which is a number specific to the 
subject.  The investigator is in control of the information that is needed to connect a study 
sample to a subject.  A subject’s consent to the use of data does not have a specific expiration date, but the subject may withdraw consent at any time by notifying the investigator.  If 
consent is withdrawn, any samples collected prior to that time may still be given to and used by the sponsor but no new data or samples will be collected unless specifically req uired to 
monitor the safety of the subject.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 86 of 140  4.3 Description of Study Procedures 4.3.1 Efficacy 4.3.1.1 Disease Assessment Tumor assessments will be based on RECIST v1.1 and irRECIST guidelines, and will be performed during screening and treatment according to the schedule presented in Section 4.2.  As far as possible, for consistency, the same medically qualified staff person who has been trained in RECIST and irRECIST should evaluate and measure lesions at each disease assessment. For those subjects who discontinue toripalimab as a result of confirmed PD, disease evaluation will be performed at the end of treatment visit if clinically appropriate (i.e., in the absence of rapidly deteriorating clinical status).  Additional disease assessments may be performed as clinically indicated.  In addition, when available, scans performed after disease progression in subjects who permanently discontinue toripalimab will be obtained, when possible, to determine if there was any delayed activity, unless consent is withdrawn, or the subject is lost to follow-up or starts receiving another experimental or anticancer therapy.  Sites will be required to store electronic copies of all scans and the sponsor may arrange for possible centralized storage of all imaging data.  The centralized storage of imaging data would allow for possible independent centralized review of disease assessments. The initial post treatment tumor assessment performed approximately 8 weeks (± 10 days) (Part A) or approximately every 9 weeks (± 10 days) (Part B) after Cycle 1, Day 1 will not be used to make decisions regarding continued subject participation in the study unless observed disease progression is accompanied by rapidly deteriorating clinical status.  Subjects may continue to receive toripalimab Q2W (± 2 days) (Part A) or Q3W (Part B) in the setting of progressive disease (PD) when all the following criteria described in Section 3.1.5 are met: • Absence of clinical symptoms or signs indicating clinically significant disease progression • No decline in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status from baseline • Absence of rapid disease progression or threat to vital organs or critical anatomical sites (e.g., CNS metastasis, respiratory failure due to tumor compression, spinal cord compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention; no significant, unacceptable or irreversible toxicities related to study treatment.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 88 of 140  ◦ 20 mm by chest X-ray. ◦ Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. ◦ Lytic or mixed lytic-blastic lesions with a measurable soft tissue component ≥10 mm can be selected as target lesions. • Nonmeasurable Lesion Definitions – Non-target lesions will include: • Measurable lesions not selected as target lesions. • All sites of non-measurable disease, such as neoplastic masses that are too small to measure because their longest uninterrupted diameter is <10 mm (or < two times the axial slice thickness). i.e., the longest perpendicular diameter is ≥10 and <15 mm. • Other types of lesions that are confidently felt to represent neoplastic tissue, but are difficult to measure in a reproducible manner.  These include bone metastases, leptomeningeal metastases, malignant ascites, pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions, ill-defined abdominal masses, skin lesions, etc. • Pathological nodes (those with a short axis ≥10 mm but <15 mm) should be considered non-target lesions.  Nodes that have a short axis <10 mm are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed. Special considerations regarding lesion measurability – Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require particular comment: Bone lesions: • Bone scan, (positive emission tomography (PET) scan or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions.  However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions. • Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above. • Regardless of the imaging modality, blastic bone lesions are non-measurable and therefore will not be selected as target lesions. 
TopAlliance Biosciences, Inc. Protocol TAB001-01 Version 7.0 Toripalimab Injection  25 June 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 89 of 140  Cystic lesions: • Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts. • “Cystic lesions” thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  Lesions with prior local treatment: • Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other loco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion.   Assessment of overall tumor burden and measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 • To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurement.  Measurable disease is defined by the presence of at least one measurable lesion. Baseline documentation of ‘target’ and ‘non-target’ lesions • When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline (this means in instances where patients have only one or two organ sites involved, a maximum of two and four lesions respectively will be recorded). • Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition, should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. • A sum of diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. • All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required and these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare

It is possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case record form (e.g. ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’). • Assessment of overall tumor burden and measurable disease per irRECIST Target Lesions - All lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of 2 lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions.  Occasionally, the largest lesion may not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which case the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. • Non-target Lesions - All lesions or sites of disease not recorded as target lesions should be recorded as non-target lesions at baseline.  There is no limit to the number of non-target lesions that can be recorded at baseline. Follow-up: Recording of Target and New Measurable Lesion Measurements • The longest diameters of non-nodal target and new non-nodal measurable lesions, and short axis of nodal target and new nodal measurable lesions will be recorded.  Together they determine the TMTB at follow-up. Follow-up: Definition of Measurable New Lesions • In order to be selected as new measurable lesions (≤2 lesions per organ, ≤5 lesions total, per timepoint), new lesions must meet criteria as defined for baseline target lesion selection and meet the same minimum size requirements of 10 mm in the long diameter and minimum 15 mm in the short axis for new measurable lymph nodes.  New measurable lesions shall be prioritized according to size, and the largest lesions shall be selected as new measured lesions. Follow-up: Non-Target Lesion Assessment The RECIST 1.1 definitions for the assessment of non-target lesions apply.  The response of non-target lesions primarily contributes to the overall response assessments of irCR and irNon-CR/Non-PD (irNon). Non-target lesions do not affect irPR and irSD assessments. Only a massive and unequivocal worsening of non-target lesions alone, even without progression in the TMTB is indicative of irPD.

TopAlliance Biosciences, Inc. Protocol TAB001-01 Version 7.0 Toripalimab Injection  25 June 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 91 of 140  Evaluation of target lesions Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesion, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression). Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. Special notes on the assessment of target lesions  Lymph nodes:  Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study.  This means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of <10 mm. Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’:  While on study, all lesions (nodal and non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g. 2 mm).  However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’.  When this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the CRF.  If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded at 0 mm.  If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned.  This default value is derived from the 5 mm CT slice thickness.  The measurement of these lesions is potentially non-reproducible, therefore providing this default value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon 
TopAlliance Biosciences, Inc. Protocol TAB001-01 Version 7.0 Toripalimab Injection  25 June 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 92 of 140  measurement error.  However, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm. Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment:  When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the target lesion sum.  Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion.  If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’. Evaluation of non-target lesions Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis). Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.  (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression). Special notes on the assessment of target lesions  When the patient also has measurable disease: In this setting, to achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non-target disease, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest ‘increase’ in size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare. New lesions The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression.  The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: i.e. not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor. A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 93 of 140  Evaluation of Best Overall Response The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the study treatment until the end of treatment taking into account any requirement for confirmation.   At each time point of tumor evaluation, an overall response will depend on the findings of both target and non-target disease and will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions (Table 4.3.1-1). The overall response will be assessed by the investigator based on target lesions, non-target lesions and new lesions assessed. The confirmation of CR and PR is required; and a response of CR or PR at one time point must be confirmed by subsequent tumor assessment no less than 4 weeks after first response criteria are met.  Table 4.3.1-1  Time point overall response: patients with target (+/- non-target) lesions Target lesions Non-Target lesions New lesions Overall response CR CR No CR CR Non-CR/non-PD No PR CR Not evaluated No PR PR Non-PD or not all evaluated No PR SD Non-PD or not all evaluated No SD Not all evaluated Non-PD No Inevaluable (NE) PD Any Yes or No PD Any PD Yes or No PD Any Any Yes PD  The best overall response (BOR) will be derived from overall responses at different time points, and defined as Table 4.3.1-2 (RECIST 1.1, Eisenhauer EA, et al, 2009).

Note: For this study, minimum criteria for SD duration is 4 weeks.   • Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as ‘symptomatic deterioration’.  Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response: it is a reason for stopping study therapy. • In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  When the evaluation of complete response depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) to confirm the complete response status.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 95 of 140  Confirmatory Measurement/Duration of Response per RECIST v1.1 Confirmation • The main goal of confirmation of objective response (CR/PR) is to avoid overestimating the response rate observed.  In cases where confirmation of response is not feasible, it should be made clear when reporting the outcome of such studies that the responses are not confirmed. • To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments that should be performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met.  Longer intervals as determined by the study protocol may also be appropriate. • In the case of SD, measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval (in general not less than 6-8 weeks) that is defined in the study protocol. Duration of overall response • The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met from CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded on study). • The duration of overall complete response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented. Duration of stable disease • Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the reference for calculation of PD). Evaluation of tumors based upon the irRECIST (http://www.irrecist.com/). Overall Tumor Assessments • Immune-related Complete Response (irCR) – Complete disappearance of all measurable and non-measurable lesions.  Lymph nodes must decrease to < 10 mm in short axis.  Confirmation of response is not necessary.  Immune-related Partial Response (irPR) - Decrease of ≥ 30% TMTB relative to baseline, non-target lesions are irNN, and no unequivocal progression of new non-measurable lesions. 
TopAlliance Biosciences, Inc. Protocol TAB001-01 Version 7.0 Toripalimab Injection  25 June 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 96 of 140  • Immune-related Stable Disease (irSD) - Failure to meet criteria for irCR or irPR in the absence of irPD. • Immune-related NN (irNN) – No target disease was identified at baseline and at follow-up the patient fails to meet criteria for irCR or irPD. • Immune-relate Progressive Disease (irPD) – Minimum 20% increase and minimum 5 mm absolute increase in TMTB compared to nadir, or irPD for non-target or new non-measurable lesions.  Confirmation of progression is recommended minimum 4 weeks after the first irPD assessment. • Immune-related NE (irNE) – used in exception cases where insufficient data exists. Additional Guidance per irRECIST: Total Measured Tumor Burden (TMTB) Baseline-selected target lesions and new measurable lesions should NOT be assessed separately. Measurements of those lesions should be combined into the TMTB to provide combined assessment. New Measurable Lesions Criteria for unidimensional lesion measurement apply to both target and new measurable lesions:  A minimum of 10 mm in the longest diameter for non-nodal lesions, and a minimum 15 mm in the short axis for lymph nodes.  But smaller lesions of the non-target or new non-measurable tumor burden do not get measured.  irPR if not Target Lesions If new measurable lesions appear in patients with no target lesions at baseline, irPD will be assessed.  That irPD timepoint will be considered a new baseline, and all subsequent timepoints will be compared to it for response assessment.  irPR is possible if the TMTB of new measurable lesions decreased by ≥30% compared to the first irPD documentation. Non-Target Lesions Baseline selected non-target lesions can never convert to measurable lesions, not even if they increase in size at subsequent timepoints and become measurable.  Only true new lesions can be measured and contribute to the TMTB. irPD Based on Non-Target Lesions A substantial and unequivocal increase of non-target lesions is indicative of progression.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 97 of 140  irPD Based on New Non-Measurable Lesions The reviewer may assign irPD for the patient with multiple new lesions of 9 mm if they are considered to be a sign of unequivocal, massive worsening. irPD Confirmation Progression confirmation no less than 4 weeks after the initial irPD assessment is recommended especially in the case of marginal disease growth and if the first irPD assessment is within the compound-specific tumor flare window. Best Overall Response (irBOR) The immune-related overall responses at each time point of tumor assessment will be evaluated based on measurable and non-measurable lesions by investigator using criteria in Table 4.3.1-3 (Wolchock et al., 2009). The confirmation of irCR and irPR is not required.  However, per irRECIST, the confirmation of irPD is recommended by using the subsequent tumor evaluation at least 4 weeks after the first irPD.  Table 4.3.1-3  Table Derivation of irRC Overall Responses 
   Best overall response (irBOR) will be derived from overall responses at different time points for a subject. The order of irBOR is irCR, irPR, irSD and irPD.   4.3.2 Medical History and Physical Examination, Electrocardiogram, and Vital Signs A complete physical examination and an abbreviated symptom-driven physical examination will be conducted according to the schedule presented in Section 4.2.  Note that “physical examination” implies that a licensed independent healthcare provider (i.e., physician, physician’s assistant, or licensed nurse practitioner) will perform the exam, and this is the requirement for this study; “physical assessment” or “health assessment” should not be used.

The severity of AEs, laboratory abnormalities, or other abnormal clinical assessments will be graded based on the NCI-CTCAE v4.03.  Special attention will be given to monitor any instance of irAEs such as dermatitis, colitis, pneumonitis or pulmonary toxicities.  Whole blood and serum samples should be obtained in the event subjects experience symptoms associated with irAEs and at the onset of any SAE, irAEs, during any suspected infusion related reaction, and at time of progression when a subject is taken off study, so long as the investigator believes the readouts would be informative, and that the collection would not pose an undue risk to the subject.  These samples may include chemistry, CBC, thyroid panel, PK, ADA, ANA, serum and blood collection for pharmacodynamic analysis. In the event of a serum sickness like reaction (see NCI-CTCAE), with symptoms such as fever, rash, and arthritis, the following laboratory tests should be obtained at the time of evaluation: CBC with differential, serum chemistry including BUN, creatinine and liver function tests, complement studies including CH50, C3, C4, C1q binding assay, Raji cell assay (if the complement and C1q binding assays are not definitive but serum sickness is still suspected), and urinalysis to detect urine protein and blood and rule out possible infection. 4.3.4 Pharmacokinetic Evaluation and Methods Measurement of toripalimab in serum will be performed using a validated capture ELISA method.

4.5 Archival Tumor Samples and Tumor Biopsies  
4.5.1 Archival Tumor Samples 
Archival tumor samples are required for all subjects not providing fresh pre-treatment 
biopsies, and adequate tissue for biomarker analysis must be deemed available during the  
screening period.  For subjects who have provided fresh pre-treatment biopsies, archival specimens will also be requested.  Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor samples will be collected for IHC and additional correlative markers ( e.g., tumor mutation analysis, 
RNA analysis, and immunodiversity).  If a tumor block cannot be provided for this study, 
then only freshly prepared unstained sections should be provided as described in the 
Laboratory Manual. 
4.5.2 Tumor Biopsies 
Fresh pre-treatment tumor biopsies that are safely accessible will be requested from all 
subjects in Part A and required from all subjects in Part B.  Image-guided core needle tumor 
biopsy will be performed according to institutional practice during screening .   
Following initiation of toripalimab, post-treatment tumor biopsies will be at the PIs discretion at the occurrence of progressive disease, pseudoprogression or partial response.  
Tumor lesions used for biopsy should not be lesions used as RECIST/irRECIST target lesions, unless there are no other lesions suitable for biopsy.  If a RECIST/irRECIST target 
lesion is used for biopsy the lesion must be ≥ 2 cm in longest diameter.  Additional tumor biopsies are permitted as clinically indicated ( e.g., for mixed responses or upon PD), and as 
long as the additional biopsy does not pose unacceptable medical risk to a subject as  
determined by the investigator.

Toripalimab Preparation  The toripalimab dose to be administered to the subject will be diluted in 0.9% NaCl.  The toripalimab volume, 0.9% NaCl volume, and total deliverable volume for each dose level is captured in Table 4.8.1-2. Table 4.8.1-2  Toripalimab, 0.9% NaCl and Total Deliverable Volume Dose Level (mg) Toripalimab Volume (mL) 0.9% NaCl Volume (mL) Total Deliverable Volume (mL) 80 2 98 100 240 6 94 100 480 12 88 100   Note that empty IV bags should be used and filled with the appropriate volume of 0.9% NaCl and toripalimab (e.g.; for the 80mg dose level, add to the empty IV bag, 98mLs of 0.9% NaCl followed by 2mLs of toripalimab).  Dose Preparation Steps No incompatibilities between toripalimab in diluent and plastics passing compatibility tests (i.e., polyolefin and polyvinylchloride IV bags; polycarbonate syringe) have been observed.  Toripalimab does not contain preservatives and any unused portion must be discarded.  Preparation of toripalimab is to be performed aseptically.  Total in-use storage time from removal of toripalimab from the refrigerator and diluent to completion of administration should not exceed 4 hours at room temperature.  If storage time exceeds these limits, a new dose must be prepared from new vials. Dose should be prepared in an IV bag for IV infusion.  An empty IV bag must be used (i.e., empty bag provided from manufacturer).  To prepare the IV bag, first determine the volume of toripalimab and 0.9% NaCl required based upon the assigned Dose Level (Table 4.8.1-2).  Second, add the required volume of 0.9% NaCl to the IV bag as appropriate for the intended dose.  Third, add the required dose volume of toripalimab to the IV bag.  Gently mix the solution in the bag or syringe by inverting up and down.  Avoid shaking the IV bag to prevent foaming. Following preparation of the dose, the entire contents of the IV bag should be administered as an IV infusion at a constant rate.  See Section 4.8.1.2 for treatment administration.

4.9.1 Methods for Assigning Treatment Groups 
A designated form will be used for enrollment to a cohort and assignment of unblinded toripalimab.  A subject is considered enrolled into the study when the investigator notifies the Clinical Research Organization ( CRO) of the subject’s eligibility and the CRO assigns the 
part (A or B) of the study the subject will be enrolled into.  The CRO will also assign the 
cohort into which the subject will be enrolled.   
All subjects will receive toripalimab.  
If there is a delay in the administration of toripalimab such that it will not be administered within the timeframe specified on the Enrollment Form, the study monitor must be notified immediately. 
4.9.2 Methods for Ensuring Blinding 
This study is not blinded.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 110 of 140  4.10 Restrictions During the Study and Concomitant Treatment(s) The Investigator must be informed as soon as possible about any medication taken from the time of screening through 90 days post last dose of toripalimab.  Subjects may continue their baseline medication(s) as long as the medications are not prohibited as outlined in Section 4.10.2.  The daily dose of each medication should be maintained throughout the study, if possible.  Any concomitant medication(s), including herbal preparations, taken during the study will be recorded in the eCRF.  The eCRFs will capture the medication(s), dosage, route of administration, start and stop dates, and the indication for which it was given. 4.10.1 Permitted Concomitant Medications Investigators may prescribe concomitant medications or treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care except for those medications identified as “excluded” as listed in Section 4.10.2.  Specifically, subjects should receive full supportive care during the study, including transfusions of blood and blood products, and treatment with antibiotics, anti-emetics, anti-diarrheals, and analgesics, and other care as deemed appropriate, and in accordance with their institutional guidelines. 4.10.1.1 Prophylactic Pre-Medications Primary prophylaxis against infusion-related reactions is not permitted during this study in order to avoid obscuring potential safety signals and enable a future assessment regarding whether premedications should be required for all subjects in future studies.  However, at the discretion of the investigator, secondary prophylaxis (i.e., prevention of infusion-related reaction following initial episode) is appropriate and will be permitted with the following recommended regimen: acetaminophen (e.g., 650 to 1000 mg) and diphenhydramine (e.g., 12.5 to 25 mg) may be administered approximately 30 minutes prior to the start of the toripalimab infusion.  Consideration can be given to premedicating with non-sedating anti-histamines (e.g., cetrizine) instead of diphenhydramine for subjects with recurrent infusion related reactions. At the discretion of the investigator, administer intravenous doses of meperidine (e.g., 10 to 25 mg) and promethazine (e.g., 12.5 to 25 mg) or their equivalents just prior to the start of the toripalimab infusion.   NOTE: Pre-treatment medications may need to be repeated during the course of the infusion; therefore, this should be taken into consideration when deciding on the dosage of the pre-treatment medications.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 111 of 140  4.10.1.2 Corticosteroids The following corticosteroids are permitted while on study: • Intranasal or inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent.  • Systemic corticosteroids required for the control of infusion reactions or irAEs must be tapered and be at non-immunosuppressive doses (≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) for at least 2 weeks before the next study drug administration.  For irAEs that are Grade 2 (moderate), prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day or equivalent should be initiated if symptoms persist beyond a week.  For Grade 3 (severe) or Grade 4 (life threatening) irAEs, prednisone 1-2 mg/kg/day or equivalent should be given until symptoms have improved to Grade 1 (mild) or less, then tapered slowly over a month or more.  Note that approximate equivalent doses for prednisone 5 mg are: methylprednisolone 4 mg; dexamethasone 0.75 mg; and hydrocortisone 20 mg.  Note that for the irAE of diarrhea, if corticosteroids are not effective after about 3 days, treatment with the TNF inhibitor infliximab in a dose of 5 mg/kg should be considered, but should be avoided in patients with immune-mediated hepatitis.   • Corticosteroids as prophylactic treatment for subjects with contrast allergies to diagnostic imaging contrast dyes will be permitted. 4.10.1.3 Vaccination The use of live, attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving a toripalimab dose is prohibited.  After treatment with toripalimab, it is best to wait until at least 4 weeks have transpired or until recovery of immune responses (e.g., B lymphocytes) before giving live, attenuated vaccines.  However, the use of killed vaccines for the prevention of influenza is permitted at the discretion of the investigator.  The use of killed vaccines for the prevention of any infectious disease may be permitted on a case-by-case basis and must be discussed with the medical monitor prior to its use.  All vaccinations administered during the study must be recorded in the eCRF. 4.10.1.4 Prophylactic Therapies Palliative/therapeutic therapies such as radiotherapy for pain, thoracentesis or paracentesis for comfort may be administered after consultation with the medical monitor. 4.10.1.5 Treatment of Isolated Lesions Treatment of isolated/symptomatic lesions by local surgery or radiation therapy is permitted for palliative or potentially curative management at any time during the study, provided that 
TopAlliance Biosciences, Inc. Protocol TAB001-01 Version 7.0 Toripalimab Injection  25 June 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 112 of 140  the isolated lesion is not the only target lesion being assessed.  All interventions should be discussed in advance with the medical monitor.  Radiation therapy should be scheduled to minimize treatment delays.  4.10.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications Subjects must be instructed not to take any medications, including over-the-counter products, without first consulting with the investigator. The following medications are considered exclusionary during the study.  The sponsor must be notified if a subject receives any of these during the study. • Any investigational anticancer therapy. • Any concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic, or hormonal therapy for cancer treatment.  Concurrent use of hormones for noncancer-related conditions (e.g., insulin for diabetes and hormone replacement therapy) is acceptable.  • Live attenuated vaccines • Immunosuppressive medications including, but not limited to systemic corticosteroids at doses beyond 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent, methotrexate, azathioprine, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) blockers.  Use of immunosuppressive medications for the management of toripalimab related AEs in subjects with contrast allergies is acceptable.  In addition, use of inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids are permitted at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent.  NOTE: Local treatment of isolated lesions for palliative intent is acceptable (e.g., by local surgery or radiotherapy). 4.11 Statistical Evaluation 4.11.1 General Considerations There will be no formal hypothesis testing.  All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS Version 9.3 or higher, unless otherwise noted.  In general, analysis of categorical variables will include counts and percentage of subjects in each category observed.  For continuous variables, the sample size (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), mean, median, minimum, and maximum will be presented.  Missing data will not be imputed unless otherwise stated.  Subject demographics, baseline characteristics, and disposition will be characterized using descriptive statistics.   
TopAlliance Biosciences, Inc. Protocol TAB001-01 Version 7.0 Toripalimab Injection  25 June 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 113 of 140  No formal interim analysis is planned for this study.  However, a review of safety data and available PK data will be performed after completion of each dose escalation cohort.  A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will fully describe the planned analyses for this study. 4.11.2 Sample Size The sample size will include up to 18 subjects in escalation phase plus approximately 280 subjects in expansion phase for a total of up to approximately 298 subjects.  Assuming a 10% drop out rate, a total of up to approximately 327 subjects are expected to be enrolled.  Expansion cohorts may include 5 disease-specific cohorts, and at the discretion of the Sponsor, another tumor cohort, to a maximum of 80 subjects in a sarcoma cohort (minimum of 40 subjects with either angiosarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma or alveolar soft part sarcoma) and 40 subjects for the other 5 cohorts. The indications initially pursued in the expansion phase will be decided based on responses in the escalation phase, and other considerations. 4.11.3 Safety Analysis 4.11.3.1 MTD Evaluation Maximum tolerated dose evaluation will be based on the DLT evaluable subjects. DLT events will be summarized descriptively. 4.11.3.2 Analysis of Safety Endpoints The results from AEs, CMs, vital signs, ECGs, safety lab results, and physical examinations will be provided in listings.  AEs and medical history will be coded using the MedDRA version 19.1 or higher.  CMs will be coded using WHODrug version September 2016 or higher.  Safety summaries will include the Safety Population, i.e. subjects receiving any amount of toripalimab.  Summaries of AEs and other parameters will be provided in summary tables to assess frequency of incidence.  Shift tables for AEs, ECGs, and other Safety parameters will be generated to assess changes from baseline.  A list of preferred terms designated as AESIs will be provided in the SAP. 4.11.4 Efficacy Analyses Efficacy analyses will include all subjects who received study drug.  ORR and DCR will be presented for each dose cohort in Part A and expansion cohort in Part B.  For the expansion phase, PFS will be presented for each expansion cohort.  For PFS and OS, subjects not achieving the endpoint will be censored at the time of last endpoint assessment. If a subject receives alternate therapy prior to PD (or irPD, respectively) or death without PD, this subject will be censored at the date of their last radiological assessment prior to start of

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 115 of 140  4.11.9 Interim Analysis No formal interim analysis will be performed. 5 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 5.1 Definition of Adverse Events The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) E6(R1) defines an AE as: Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE includes but is not limited to any clinically significant worsening of a subject’s pre-existing condition.  An abnormal laboratory finding (including ECG finding) that requires an action or intervention by the investigator, or a finding judged by the investigator to represent a change beyond the range of normal physiologic fluctuation, should be reported as an AE. Adverse events may be treatment emergent (i.e., occurring after initial receipt of toripalimab) or nontreatment emergent.  A nontreatment-emergent AE is any new sign or symptom, disease, or other untoward medical event that begins after written informed consent has been obtained but before the subject has received toripalimab.  Elective treatment or surgery or preplanned treatment or surgery (that was scheduled prior to the subject being enrolled into the study) for a documented pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE (serious or nonserious).  An untoward medical event occurring during the prescheduled elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment should be recorded as an AE or SAE unless the investigator deems the event to be related to the use of the study drug. Progression of disease is considered an efficacy outcome parameter, and for AE/SAE reporting purposes, is excluded from the definition of an AE and SAE.  Similarly, death from progressive disease will not be considered an AE or SAE. 5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any AE that: • Results in death 
TopAlliance Biosciences, Inc.  Protocol TAB001 -01 Version 7.0 
Toripalimab Injection   25 June 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  116 of 140 
 • Is immediately life-threatening 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in offspring of the subject  
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
◦ Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in this situation.  Examples of medically important events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalizations; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
5.3 Definition of Adverse Events of Sp ecial Interest 
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is one of scientific and medical interest specific 
to understanding of toripalimab and may require close monitoring and rapid communication 
by the investigator to the sponsor.  An AESI may be serious or nonserious.  The rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to characterize and understand them in association with the use of this toripalimab. 
5.3.1 Adverse event(s) of special interest  
Adverse events that are considered AESIs and require immediate reporting are listed below:  
• Hepatic function abnormality meeting the definition of Hy’s law. See Section 5.7.3 for 
the definition and reporting of AESIs of hepatic function abnormality.  
• ≥ Grade 3 endocrinopathy (e.g., hypophysitis, thyroiditis, adrenal insufficiency) 
• ≥ Grade 3 dermatologic AE 
• ≥ Grade 3 pneumonitis 
• ≥ Grade 3 enterocolitis 
• ≥ Grade 3 serum sickness (see Section 4.3.3.1) 
AESIs ≥ Grade 3 are required to be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to TopAlliance Biosciences Patient Safety representative ( ) using the SAE/AESI

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  117 of 140 
 Report Form, even if the event is considered to be nonserious (see Section 5.6 for contact 
information). 
5.4 Recording of Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be recorded on the eCRF using a recognized medical term or diagnosis 
that accurately reflects the event.  Adverse events will be assessed by the investigator for 
severity, relationship to toripalimab, possible etiologies, and whether the event meets criteria of an SAE and therefore requires immediate notification to TopAlliance Biosciences  Patient 
Safety representative ( ).  See Section 5.2 for the definition of SAEs and 9.1 
for guidelines for assessment of severity and relationship.  If an AE evolves into a condition that meets the regulatory definition of “serious,” it will be reported on the SAE Report Form.  
Infusion of biological products is commonly associated with infusion related reactions.  
Anaphylaxis and infusion related reactions have some common manifestations and may be difficult to distinguish from each other.  Infusion related reactions are commonly observed 
during or shortly after the first time exposure to therapeutic monoclonal antibodies delivered 
through intravenous infusion.  These reactions are less common following subsequent 
exposures. Unlike infusion related reactions, anaphylaxis is a rare event, usually occurring after subsequent exposure to an antigen, and it is most commonly accompanied by severe systemic skin and or mucosal reactions.  The Investigator is advised to carefully examine symptoms of adverse reactions observed during or shortly after exposure to toripalimab, and 
consider the above mentioned facts prior to making a final diagnosis.  Reactions occurring at 
the time of or shortly after subsequent infusions of toripalimab are to be judged by the investigator at his/her own discretion.  For the Investigator’s convenience and in order to 
facilitate consistency in judgments , a copy of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectio us 
Disease s (NIAID) and Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) guidance for 
anaphylaxis diagnosis is provided in Section 9.2. 
5.4.1 Time Period for Collection of Adverse Events  
AEs and SAEs will be collected from the start of the first dose, throughout the treatment 
period, and through the 90 days post last dose of toripalimab. 
All AEs or other clinically significant AEs occurring up to 90 days after administration of the 
last dose of study drug will be collected for subjects continuing in the study.  For subjects 
who discontinue from the study within 90 days after the administration of the last dose of 
study drug: 

TopAlliance Biosciences, Inc.  Protocol TAB001 -01 Version 7.0 
Toripalimab Injection   25 June 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  118 of 140 
 • Study drug-related AE information will be collected and should be foll owed to resolution 
/ stabilization. 
• AEs that lead to the discontinuation should be followed to resolution  / stabilization. 
• A telephone contact for the safety update would be acceptable if the subject cannot 
manage an office visit. 
Only study drug-related serious or other clinically significant ( e.g., late emerging irAEs that 
are not serious) AEs  will be collected for all subjects > 90 days after the administration of the 
last dose of study drug.   
A nonserious AE is an AE that does not have a classification  of serious.  The collection of 
nonserious AE information should begin at initiation of study drug and should conclude 90 
days after last dose of study drug.  Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or 
stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they become serious (see Section 5.2).  Follow-up is also 
required for nonserious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of study drug, or those 
that are present at the end of study treatment as appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious AE page of the eCRF. 
5.5 Follow -up of U nresolved Adverse Events  
Any AEs that are unresolved by End of study visit are followed up by the investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF.  TopAlliance 
Biosciences retains the right to request additional information for any subject with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 
5.6 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Within 24 hours of identifying an SAE, regardless of the presumed relationship to toripalimab, the investigator or qualified designee must complete the SAE /AESI  Report 
Form and fax or email it to TopAlliance Biosciences Patient Safety representative (PAREXEL International Medical Services ).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  119 of 140 
 The sponsor is responsible for reporting certain SAEs as expedited safety reports to 
applicable regulatory authorities, ethics committees, and participating investigators, in accordance with ICH Guidelines and/or local regulatory requirements.  The sponsor may be 
required to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities within 7  calendar days of being 
notified about the event; therefore, it is important that investigators submit additional information requested by the sponsor as soon as it becomes available . 
Investigators should provide all available information at the time of SAE /AESI  Report Form 
completion.  Investigators should not wait to collect additional information to fully document the event before notifying TopAlliance Biosciences  Patient Safety representative of an SAE.  
When additional information becomes available, investigators should submit a follow -up 
SAE Report Form.  Any follow-up information to an SAE also needs to be provided to TopAlliance Biosciences  Patient Safety representative within 24 hours of learning of the new 
information.  
5.7 Other Events Requiring Immediate Reporting  
5.7.1 Dose-limiting Toxicity 
Dose-limiting toxicities are defined in Section 3.1.6.2.  Any subject who the principal investigator believes has experienced a toxicity that meets the DLT  criteria should be 
reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to Medical Monitor so 
that the sponsor can confirm the occurrence of a DLT and notify all of the other 
investigators. 
5.7.2 Overdose 
An overdose is defined as a subject receiving a dose of toripalimab in excess of that specified 
in the IB, unless otherwise specified in this protocol. Any overdose of a study subject with the toripalimab, with or without associated AEs/SAEs, 
is required to be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to  
Medical Monitor.  If the overdose results in an AE, the AE must also be recorded on the AE eCRF (see Section 5.4).  Overdose does not automatically make an AE serious, but if the 
consequences of the overdose are serious, for example death or hospitalization, the event is 
serious and must be reported as an SAE (Section 5.6).  TopAlliance Biosciences does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose.  The investigator will use clinical judgment to treat any overdose.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  120 of 140 
 5.7.3 Hepatic Function Abnormality 
Adverse events of hepatic function abnormality of special interest to the sponsor are defined 
as any increase in ALT or AST to greater than 3 ×  ULN and concurrent increase in bilirubin 
to greater than 2 × ULN and no reason exists other than exposure to the study drug (i.e., Hy’s law cases).  Concurrent findings are those that derive from a single blood draw or from separate blood draws taken within 8 days of each other. In the event of hepatic function abnormality where the etiology is unknown, timely follo w-up investigations and inquiries 
should be initiated by the investigational site, based on medical judgment, to make an informed decision regarding the etiology of the event.   
If the underlying diagnosis for the hepatic function abnormality is known (incl uding 
progression of pre-existing disease such as primary or metastatic malignancy), the diagnosis should be recorded as an AE/SAE. 
If the underlying diagnosis for the hepatic function abnormality remains unknown, the term 
“hepatic function abnormal” should be used to report the AE/SAE. 
Hepatic function abnormality of unknown etiology, or which is considered attributable to 
toripalimab, is required to be reported as “hepatic function abnormal” within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event to TopAlliance Biosciences Patient Safety representative using the SAE/AESI  Report Form, even if the event is considered to be non -serious (see Section 5.6 
for contact information).  The investigator will review the data with the medical monitor.  
The investigator should then use clinical judgment to establish the cause based on local standard of care and follow the subject by conducting testing as clinically  indicated. 
If, after appropriate workup, in the opinion of the investigator, the underlying diagnosis for 
the abnormality remains unexplained, or is considered attributable to toripalimab, permanent 
discontinuation of dosing for the study subject should be considered.  
Each reported event of hepatic function abnormality will be followed by the investigator and 
evaluated by the sponsor.  
5.7.4 Pregnancy  
Pregnancy in a female subject who has received toripalimab is required to be reported within 
24 hours of knowledge of the event to TopAlliance Biosciences  Patient Safety representative 
using the Pregnancy Notification Form (see Section 5.6 for contact information).   
Subjects who become pregnant during the treatment period and prior to their first follow up 
visit must not receive additional doses of toripalimab but will not be withdrawn from the study.  The reporting period for the occurren ce of a pregnancy is through 90 days after the 
last dose of toripalimab.  The pregnancy will be followed for outcome of the mother and

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 121 of 140  child (including any premature terminations) and should be reported to TopAlliance Biosciences Patient Safety representative after outcome. Pregnancy in a female clinical trial subject is not an SAE per se. Complications of such pregnancies, for example, spontaneous abortion, may qualify as an SAE and should be reported as an SAE even if they occur greater than 90 days past the last dose of toripalimab.  Should the investigator become aware of a pregnancy in the partner of a male study subject who has received toripalimab, this should be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to TopAlliance Biosciences Patient Safety representative using the Pregnancy Notification Form (see Section 5.6 for contact information).  The sponsor will endeavor to collect follow-up information on such pregnancies provided the partner of the study subject provides consent.  6 STUDY AND DATA MANAGEMENT 6.1 Training of Study Site Personnel Before the first subject is entered into the study, a TopAlliance Biosciences representative will review and discuss the requirements of the Clinical Study Protocol and related documents with the investigational staff and also train them in any study-specific procedures and system(s) utilized. The principal investigator will ensure that appropriate training relevant to the study is given to all of these staff, and that any new information relevant to the performance of this study is forwarded to the staff involved. The principal investigator will maintain a record of all individuals involved in the study (medical, nursing and other staff). 6.2 Monitoring of the Study During the study, a TopAlliance Biosciences representative will have regular contacts with the study site, including visits to: • Provide information and support to the investigator(s). • Confirm that facilities remain acceptable. • Confirm that the investigational team are adhering to the protocol, that data are being accurately and timely recorded in the eCRFs, that biological samples are handled in accordance with the Laboratory Manual and that study drug accountability checks are being performed. 
TopAlliance Biosciences, Inc. Protocol TAB001-01 Version 7.0 Toripalimab Injection  25 June 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 122 of 140  • Perform source data verification (a comparison of the data in the eCRFs with the subject’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to the study) including verification of informed consent of participating subjects.  This will require direct access to all original records for each subject (e.g., clinic charts). • Ensure withdrawal of informed consent to the use of the subject’s biological samples is reported and biological samples are identified and disposed of/destroyed accordingly, and the action is documented, and reported to the subject. The TopAlliance Biosciences representative will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff at the center needs information and advice about the study conduct. 6.2.1 Source Data All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data.  Data reported in the eCRF derived from source documents should be consistent with the source documents. The primary source document for this study will be the subject’s medical record.  If the investigator(s) maintain separate research records, both the medical record and the research records will be considered the source documents for the purposes of auditing the study. The anonymity of subjects must be maintained.  Subjects will be identified by their initials and an assigned subject number on eCRFs and other documents submitted to the sponsor.  Documents that identify the subject beyond initials and subject number will not be submitted to the sponsor (e.g., the signed informed consent document) and must be maintained in strict confidence by the investigator, except to the extent necessary to allow auditing by the regulatory authorities, study monitor, or sponsor representatives. Data recorded on source documents will be entered into eCRFs.  The investigator must promptly review the completed eCRFs for each subject.  A study monitor representing the sponsor will review the source documents against the eCRF on a regular basis through the study period.  The principal investigator at each/the center should comply with all the terms, conditions, and obligations of the Clinical Study Agreement, or equivalent, for this study.  In the event of any inconsistency between this clinical study protocol and the Clinical Study Agreement, the terms of Clinical Study Protocol shall prevail with respect to the conduct of the study and the treatment of subjects and in all other respects, not relating to study conduct or treatment of subjects, the terms of the Clinical Study Agreement shall prevail.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 123 of 140  Agreements between TopAlliance Biosciences and the principal investigator must be in place before any study-related procedures can take place, or subjects are enrolled. 6.2.2 Archiving of Study Documents The investigator follows the principles outlined in the Clinical Study Agreement. 6.3 Study Timetable and End of Study An individual subject will be considered to have completed the study if the subject was followed through the last protocol-specified visit/assessment (including telephone contact), regardless of the number of doses of toripalimab that was received.   Subjects will be considered not to have completed the study if consent was withdrawn or the subject was lost to follow-up (see Section 4.1.5). The end of the study (“study completion”) is defined as the date of the last protocol-specified visit/assessment (including telephone contact) for the last subject in the study. 6.4 Data Management Data management will be performed by a CRO according to the study specific Data Management Plan. A Web Based Data Capture (WBDC) system will be used for data collection and query handling.  The investigator will ensure that data are recorded on the eCRFs as specified in the study protocol and in accordance with the instructions provided. The investigator ensures the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data recorded and of the provision of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study Agreement.  The investigator will sign the completed eCRFs.  A copy of the completed eCRFs will be archived at the study site. 7 ETHICAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS 7.1 Ethical Conduct of the Study The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with ICH/GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements. 
TopAlliance Biosciences, Inc. Protocol TAB001-01 Version 7.0 Toripalimab Injection  25 June 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 124 of 140  7.2 Subject Data Protection The informed consent form (ICF) will incorporate (or, in some cases, be accompanied by a separate document incorporating) wording that complies with relevant data protection and privacy legislation. The anonymity of subjects must be maintained.  Subjects will be identified by their initials and an assigned subject number on eCRFs and other documents submitted to the sponsor.  Documents that identify the subject beyond initials and subject number will not be submitted to the sponsor (e.g., the signed ICF) and must be maintained in strict confidence by the investigator, except to the extent necessary to allow auditing by the regulatory authorities, study monitor, or sponsor representatives. TopAlliance Biosciences will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, any insurance company, any employer, their family members, general physician or any other third party, unless required to do so by law. Extra precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic data being linked to the identity of the subject.  In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals might see both the genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject.  For example, in the case of a medical emergency, a TopAlliance Biosciences medical monitor or an investigator might know a subject’s identity and also have access to his or her genetic data.  Also, Regulatory authorities may require access to the relevant files, though the subject’s medical information and the genetic files would remain physically separate. 7.3 Ethics and Regulatory Review An IRB/IEC should approve the final study protocol, including the final version of the ICF and any other written information and/or materials to be provided to the subjects.  The investigator will ensure the distribution of these documents to the applicable IRB/IEC, and to the study site staff. The opinion of the IRB/IEC should be given in writing.  The investigator should submit the written approval to TopAlliance Biosciences or designee before enrollment of any subject into the study.  The IRB/IEC should approve all advertising used to recruit subjects for the study. TopAlliance Biosciences or designee should approve any modifications to the ICF that are needed to meet local requirements. If required by local regulations, the protocol should be re-approved by the IRB/IEC annually.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 125 of 140  Before enrollment of any subject into the study, the final study protocol, including the final version of the ICF, is approved by the national regulatory authority or a notification to the national regulatory authority is done, according to local regulations. TopAlliance Biosciences will handle the distribution of any of these documents to the national regulatory authorities. TopAlliance Biosciences will provide Regulatory Authorities, IRB/IEC and principal investigators with safety updates/reports according to local requirements, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs), where relevant. Each principal investigator must inform the IRB/IEC of: • Changes in informed consent • Revisions of other documents originally submitted for review • Serious and/or unexpected adverse events occurring during the study  • New information that may adversely affect the safety of subjects or the conduct of the study • Annual update and/or request for re-approval • Study completion 7.4 Informed Consent A copy of the proposed informed consent document must be submitted to the sponsor for review and comment prior to submission to the reviewing IRB/IEC.  The consent form must be approved by the IRB/IEC and contain all elements required by national, state, local and institutional regulations or requirements.  The principal investigator(s) at each center will: • Ensure each subject is given full and adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the study • Ensure each subject is notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any time • Ensure that each subject is given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided • Ensure each subject voluntarily provides signed and dated informed consent before conducting any procedure specifically for the study 
TopAlliance Biosciences, Inc. Protocol TAB001-01 Version 7.0 Toripalimab Injection  25 June 2020  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 126 of 140  • Ensure the original, signed ICF(s) is/are stored in the Investigator’s Study File • Ensure a copy of the signed ICF is given to the subject • Ensure that any incentives for subjects who participate in the study as well as any provisions for subjects harmed as a consequence of study participation are described in the ICF that is approved by an IRB/IEC 7.5 Changes to the Protocol and Informed Consent Form Protocol revisions will be prepared and approved by TopAlliance Biosciences and the medical monitor. Minor revisions will be submitted as administrative changes.  If there are any substantial changes to the study protocol, then these changes will be documented in a study protocol amendment and where required in a new version of the study protocol. All protocol amendments will be signed by the principal investigator and approved by the relevant IRB/IEC and if applicable, also the national regulatory authority approval, before implementation. Local requirements are to be followed for revised protocols.  Documentation of IRB/IEC approval must be forwarded to the sponsor TopAlliance Biosciences or their designee will distribute any subsequent amendments and new versions of the protocol to each principal investigator(s).  For distribution to IRB/IEC see Section 7.3. If a protocol amendment alters the study design, increases potential risk to the subject or otherwise affects statements in the ICF, the ICF must be revised accordingly and submitted to TopAlliance Biosciences and the IRB/IEC for review and approval before the revised ICF is used.  The approved consent form must be used to obtain informed consent from new subjects prior to enrollment and must be used to obtain ICF subjects already enrolled if they are affected by the amendment.  If local regulations require, any administrative change will be communicated to or approved by each IRB/IEC. 7.6 Audits and Inspections Authorized representatives of TopAlliance Biosciences, a regulatory authority, or an IRB/IEC may perform audits or inspections at the clinical sites, including source data verification.  The purpose of an audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study-related activities and documents, to determine whether these activities

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 134 of 140  9 APPENDIX 9.1 Appendix 1: Additional Safety Guidance Assessment of Severity Assessment of severity is one of the responsibilities of the investigator in the evaluation of AEs and SAEs.  Severity will be graded according to the NCI-CTCAE v4.03 as provided below.  The determination of severity for all other events not listed in the NCI-CTCAE should be made by the investigator based upon medical judgment and the severity categories of Grade 1 to 5 as defined below. • Grade 1 (mild): An event that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention.  The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living. • Grade 2 (moderate): An event that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention.  The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject. • Grade 3 (severe): An event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention.  The event interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects the clinical status of the subject. • Grade 4 (life threatening):  An event, and/or its immediate sequelae, that is associated with an imminent risk of death or with physical or mental disabilities that affect or limit the ability of the subject to perform activities of daily living (eating, ambulation, toileting, etc.). • Grade 5 (fatal): Death (loss of life) as a result of an event. It is important to distinguish between serious criteria and severity of an AE.  Severity is a measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Section 5.2.  A Grade 3 AE need not necessarily be considered an SAE.  For example, a Grade 3 headache that persists for several hours may not meet the regulatory definition of an SAE and would be considered a nonserious event, whereas a Grade 2 seizure resulting in a hospital admission would be considered an SAE. The NCI-CTCAE v4.03 will be provided in the Study Procedure Manual, and can be downloaded from the Cancer Treatment Evaluation Program (CTEP; http://www.eortc.be/services/doc/ctc/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 135 of 140  Assessment of Relationship Relationship to toripalimab The investigator is required to provide an assessment of relationship of AEs and SAEs to the toripalimab. An event will be considered “not related” to use of the toripalimab if any of the following are met: • An unreasonable temporal relationship between administration of the toripalimab and the onset of the event (e.g., the event occurred either before, or too long after, administration of toripalimab for it to be considered product-related). • A causal relationship between the toripalimab and the event is biologically implausible (e.g., death as a passenger in an automobile accident). • A clearly more likely alternative explanation for the event is present (e.g., typical adverse reaction to a concomitant drug and/or typical disease-related event). Individual AE/SAE reports will be considered “related” to use of toripalimab if the “not related” criteria are not met.  “Related” implies that the event is considered to be “associated with the use of the drug” meaning that there is “a reasonable possibility” that the event may have been caused by the product under investigation (i.e., there are facts, evidence, or arguments to suggest possible causation).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 136 of 140  9.2 Appendix 2: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network Guidance for Anaphylaxis Diagnosis The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) Network Guidance for Anaphylaxis define anaphylaxis as a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death (Sampson et al, 2006). They recognize 3 categories of anaphylaxis, with criteria designated to capture from 80% of cases (category 1) to > 95% of all cases of anaphylaxis (for all 3 categories).  1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (e.g., generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula) AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING: a. Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak expiratory flow [PEF], hypoxemia). b. Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence). 2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): a. Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized hives, itch-flush, swollen lips-tongue-uvula). b. Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak expiratory flow [PEF], hypoxemia). c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence). d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., crampy abdominal pain, vomiting). 3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): a. Infants and children: low systolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% decrease in systolic BP. b.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 138 of 140  9.4 Appendix 4: Cockcroft-Gault Formula Estimated creatinine clearance, or glomerular filtration rate =  [(140-Age) × Mass (in kg)] \ [72 × Serum creatinine (in mg/dL)]  If the patient is female, multiply the above by 0.85  If the subject is obese (> 30% over ideal body weight), use ideal body weight in calculation of estimated creatinine clearance.  Calculation of Ideal Body Weight  Ideal Body Weight (IBW) in kg Males = 50 + [2.3 × each inch over 5 ft]  or 50 + [2.3 kg × (each cm over 152.4/2.54)] Females = 45.5 + [2.3 × each inch over 5 ft]  or 45.5 + [2.3 kg × (each cm over 152.4/2.54)]  Calculation for Obesity  [(actual weight - IBW)/IBW] × 100%.  If this value is > 30% then the person is obese.  Example: Subject weight = 160.  Subject ideal weight = 120 160-120 = 40 40 / 120 = 0.33 0.33 × 100% = 33%

Clinical Trials Registration  
 
Clinical Trials Registration and Results Reporting  
 
Investigator–initiated clinical trials must be registered on ClinicalTrials.gov  to comply with federal FDA 
requirements in FDA 42 CFR 11 (Final Rule) and/or NIH Policy. Studies that falls under both FDA and NIH 
requirements only need to be registered once. The information posted on ClinicalTrials.gov (CT.gov) must be 
updated and verified at least every 12 months.  
 
The following information is used to identify studies that require clinical trials registration and results 
reporting, and to inform Principal Investigators (PI) of their responsibilities for registration and results 
reporting. 
 
IMPORTANT NOTE: Even if your investigator-initiated clinical trial does not meet the NIH or FDA 
clinical trials registration requirements, you are strongly advised to read and consider registering 
your trial to comply with the following additional requirements: 
• A non-federal sponsor may require registration as part of the award's terms and conditions 
• International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE)  for publication purposes  
• Center for Medicare & Medicaid for research billing claims for qualifying clinical trials  (Mass 
General Brigham Clinical Trials Office will notify you if applicable)  
• Research funders  now requiring registration and results reporting: May 18, 2017 Joint 
Statement

NOTE: When investigators can reasonably expect that more than an incidental number of 
subjects speaking the same non-English language will be enrolled (for example, if the research 
is targeting a non-English speaking group), the use of a written translation of the entire English 
version of the consent form is required.  The MGB IRB must approve all written translated 
versions of the consent from and recommends that the written translation be done by an in-
house medical translator from Interpreter Services or other qualified person or service 
recommended by Interpreter Services. Refer to the MGB IRB guidance on Obtaining And 
Documenting Informed Consent Of Subjects Who Do Not Speak English . 
  
 
Will a study subject advocate participate in the consent process?

Sensitive personal information obtained for research purposes typically does not become part of the 
subject’s health/medical record.  Rather, these data are retained in the research records only. 
  
NOTE: Certain categories of medical information are commonly recognized as potentially sensitive, 
such as information related to mental health; sexual behaviors or sexual orientation; illegal 
behaviors; and substance abuse.  Some genetic test results may be viewed similarly.  When 
applicable, investigators are reminded to inform subjects in the consent form that sensitive personal 
health information may become part of their health/medical record, e.g., routine testing for HIV 
infection.

Protected (Identifiable) Health Information 
  
PHI refers to health/medical information that is accompanied by any of the listed 18 HIPAA identifiers or 
by a code (where the key to the code is accessible to investigators) that links to the identifiers. DE-
IDENTIFIED DATA (without any identifiers or codes that link back to individuals) are not considered 
PHI, and are not subject to HIPAA regulations. 
 
Will you be recording any of the identifiers listed below with the data or using a code to link the data to 
any of the identifiers?  
• Name, including initials 
• Social Security Number (SSN) 
• Medical record number 
• Address by street location 
• Address by city, county, precinct, zip code  
• All elements of dates (except year) related directly to individuals including, but not limited to 
dates of birth, death, admission, discharge, or any service 
• All ages over 89 and all elements of dates (including year) indicative of such age 
• Fax number 
• Electronic email address 
• Web URL 
• Internet provider (IP) address 
• Health plan beneficiary number 
• Account number 
• Certificate / license number 
• Vehicle identification number and serial number 
• Biometric identifiers, including finger and voice print 
• Full face photographic images and any other comparable images 
• Any other unique identifying number, characteristic or code, including, but not limited to, globally 
unique identifier (GUID) and universally unique identifier (UUID), or equivalent identifier 
NOTE: If you are recording medical record number or other identifiers, even if temporarily for QA 
purposes or to avoid duplicating records, then answer "Yes".

Explain why it would be impossible to conduct the research without access to and use of 
identifiable health / medical information.  
  
For example, the data cannot be obtained from electronic health / medical records or databases 
without access to identifiers or identifiers are needed for prospective data collection. 
It would be impossible to conduct this research without access to identifiable health 
information as this information will be use to track which patients in the practice are eligible for 
recruitment, who has been approached, and who has consented/declined. 
 
How will the protected health information (PHI) recorded for the research be stored and protected?  
 
For paper-based information, describe where the identifiable information will be stored, who has 
access to the storage area, and how that access will be audited.  If the information is stored off-
site, describe how security at the facility is maintained and whether or not a business associate 
agreement has been or will be signed.  At a minimum, consider storing the PHI in locked drawers, 
cabinets, or offices with access restricted to the princiapl investigator (PI) and study staff 
designated by the PI.  
  
For electronic information, describe how electronic security is maintained, including what 
password protections and antivirus software are enabled.  Describe how the system will be 
audited.  At a minimum, consider storing PHI in a password-protected Mass General Brigham 
computer with anitvirus software.

All data will be stored in REDCap. 
All data collection involving HPI with identifiers will occur at MGH on MGB-managed 
computers, whose security profile is managed by MGB Information Systems (password 
protections, antivirus, etc). All data identified data will be stored and analyzed on a MGB 
computer (Clapp - stored in MGH AUS 438). Identifiable data will be limited to MGB study staff 
by use of password protected files or restricted shared file areas. De-identified data will be 
analyzed on computers/networks in accordance with MGB policies. 
 
Will identifiers be removed from the data and destroyed after all of the data has been collected, the 
study has been completed, or all regulatory and sponsor obligations have been met, consistent 
with regulatory and institutional research record keeping requirements? 
 
For guidance, see the Recordkeeping and Record Retention Requirements  document.  
◉  Yes   
⚪  No   
  
NOTE: Federal regulations mandate that, under a Waiver of Consent / Authorization, 
identifiers be destroyed as early as possible.  De-identified datasets may be retained 
indefinitely. 
 
  
Waiver of Informed Consent / Authorization 
  
Explain why the risk to subjects, specifically the risk to privacy, is no more than minimal risk. 
MRNs will be the primary personal identifier that will be used in the data collection process. 
Once the data collection is completed, the MRN will be replaced by a unique patient identifier 
before any analyses are performed and all other identifying information will be removed. All 
data collection involving HPI with identifiers will occur at MGH on MGB-managed computers, 
whose security profile is managed by MGB Information Systems (password protections, 
antivirus, etc). All data identified data will be stored and analyzed on a MGB computer (Clapp - 
stored in MGH AUS 438). Identifiable data will be limited to study staff by use of password 
protected files or restricted shared file areas. De-identified data will be analyzed on 
computers/networks in accordance with MGB policies. 
  
Explain why the research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver of consent / 
authorization. 
We anticipate that we will screen over 1000 patients to determine eligibility; the costs, time, 
and resources to locate and obtain consent for reviewing a patients medical record to 
determine eligibility criteria would be prohibitive for this study. Furthermore, the bias 
introduced by studying only consenting patients will limit the interpretability and generalizability 
of the findings. To protect the private of subjects, MRN will be the only identifier collected and 
PHI will be destroyed after the data set is constructed.  
  
NOTE: “Only in a few research studies would it be impossible to obtain informed consent; 
however in many studies the financial cost would be prohibitive and a potentially poor use 
of limited research resources.” Ensuring Voluntary Informed Consent and Protecting 
Privacy and Confidentiality, National Bioethics Advisory Commission. 
  
Explain why the rights and welfare of the subjects will not be adversely affected by the waiver of 
consent / authorization.

The welfare and rights of the subjects will not be affected by the waiver of consent because 
the study is retrospective and will occur after the pregnancy episode has completed. 
Information gathered will not directly affect the individual patients in the study. Lastly, study 
subjects' privacy will be protected by limiting the identifiable data to the study staff and having 
this data stored securely within the MGB Healthcare IS system. Study subjects will remain 
anonymous; patients will not be personally identifiable from any published or produced data 
from this project. 
NOTE: If the research uncovers information about the subjects that has important health / 
medical implications for them, contact the MGB IRB to discuss the appropriate process for 
providing subjects with additional pertinent information. 
 
  
Sending Health / Medical Information to Collaborators Outside Mass General Brigham 
  
Will any health / medical information be sent to collaborators outside Mass General Brigham?  
◉  Yes   
⚪  No   
Explain what health information will be sent, and to whom. 
Deidentified data collected in this study will be sent to Dr. Jessica Cohen (HSPH) to assist in 
the analysis and made publicly available via the funder, as part of their federal data sharing 
policy. No data will be shared without oversight/approval/DUA by the IRB and Office of 
Research Management.  
 
  
HIPAA And Tracking Disclosures Of Identifiable Health Information (PHI) 
  
1.  Disclosures of PHI to persons or entities outside Mass General Brigham without the written 
authorization of the subject must be tracked in accordance with Mass General Brigham policy 
“Accounting of Disclosures .” (MGB Intranet link)  
  
2.  Tracking is NOT required for disclosure of LIMITED DATA SETS under a DATA USE 
AGREEMENT.  For more information about LIMITED DATA SETS and DATA USE AGREEMENTS, 
refer to Mass General Brigham policy “Limited Data Sets Policy/Data Use Agreements ."  
  
NOTE: Mass General Brigham (MGB) is the HIPAA covered entity.  MGB includes BWH, Faulkner, 
MGH, McLean, PCHI, SRH, NSMC, and NWH, among others.  MGB does not include other 
Harvard affiliated hospitals, such as BIDMC, DFCI, HSPH, CHB, or MEEI. 
Pregnant Women or Human Fetuses  
 
Federal regulations require the IRB to provide additional protections for pregnant women and human fetuses 
involved in research [45 CFR 46.204].   
  
Assessing Risks And Benefits 
When assessing risks and benefits, consider the variability in health status of the subjects to be enrolled, 
their medical experiences, and the extent to which the research procedures will be a burden to the subjects 
in the context of their daily lives and/or routine medical care.  Procedures that usually present no more than 
minimal risk include: urinalysis, obtaining a small amount of blood, EEGs, allergy scratch tests, minor 
changes in diet or daily routine, and/or the use of standard psychological or educational tests.  The

assessment of the probability and magnitude of the risk, however, may vary depending on the diseases or 
conditions the subjects may have. 
  
Minimal Risk 
As defined in the regulations 45 CFR 46.102(i), “minimal risk means the probability and magnitude of harm 
or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily 
encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or 
tests.”   
  
 
Pregnant women or fetuses may be involved in research if all of the following conditions listed below are met 
[45 CFR 46.204].  Please provide study-specific information with your explanations. 
  
(a) Where scientifically appropriate, pre-clinical studies, including studies on pregnant animals, and clinical 
studies (including studies on non-pregnant women) have been conducted and provide data for assessing 
potential risks to pregnant women and fetuses. 
  
Provide a brief description of relevant prior pre-clinical and clinical studies, and based on this information, 
what you think the risks to pregnant women and to the fetus are in your research.  
This study is minimal risk for all individuals. There are no additional, specific risks to pregnant women or 
fetuses as part of this research.  
  
(b) The risk to the fetus is caused solely by the interventions or procedures that hold out the prospect of 
direct benefit for the woman or the fetus; if there is no such prospect of direct benefit, the risk to the fetus is 
not greater than minimal and the purpose of the research is the development of important biomedical 
knowledge which cannot be obtained by other means. 
  
Does the research hold out the prospect of direct benefit for the woman, or to the fetus? 
⚪  Yes   
◉  No   
Explain why you believe the risk to the fetus is not greater than minimal risk.  
This study will enroll pregnant individuals and involve sending them messages about the 
importance of primary care follow-up.  
Explain what new important knowledge will be gained, and why the information could not be obtained by 
any other means.  
This study aims to improve care transitions between pregnancy/postpartum providers and primary 
care providers. By its nature, there is no other way this information could be gained without 
studying pregnant individuals. 
  
(c) Any risk is the least possible for achieving the objectives of the research. 
  
Explain how the risks have been minimized to the least possible to achieve the research objectives.   
The risks have been minimized such that only the minimum necessary information will be collected. To 
protect the privacy of subjects, MRN will be the only identifier collected and PHI will be destroyed after 
the study has completed.  
 
Informed Consent  
Check all that apply:   
☑ Informed consent will be obtained from the pregnant woman in accordance with the consent 
provisions of Federal regulation 45 CFR 46.116.

Research Study Fact Sheet
Bridging the Gap from Postpartum to Primary Care (The Bridge Study)
Principal Investigators Mark Clapp, MD MPH (Massachusetts General Hospital)
Jessica Cohen, PhD (Harvard School of Public Health)
Overview This is a research study being conducted among pregnant and recently postpartum 
individuals who receive care at MGH.
Purpose Your primary care provider (PCP) is responsible for managing and overseeing your 
current and long-term health, and many people do not regularly see their PCP after a 
pregnancy. The purpose of this project is to improve the transition of care between 
your obstetric care and PCP after your delivery. 
Sponsor This research is being sponsored by the MIT Roybal Center for Translational 
Research to Improve Health Care for the Aging and the NBER Roybal Center for 
Behavior Change in Health.
Contact We sent you a Patient Gateway message about this study because you have or may 
be at risk for health conditions later in your life, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, 
obesity, or anxiety or depression.
Study Details If you agree to participate, you we will ask you a few questions about your health and 
visit history at the time of enrollment, which are all optional.
You will then be randomly assigned (50/50 chance) to be in the “standard care” group 
or the “facilitated transition” group. You will not be informed which group you have 
been assigned.
In the “standard care” group, you will continue to receive standard postpartum care 
from your primary obstetric provider. In addition, you will receive Patient Gateway and 
optional SMS (text) messages from the study team. 
In the “facilitated transition” group, you will continue to receive standard postpartum 
care from your primary obstetric provider. In addition, you will receive Patient 
Gateway and optional SMS (text) messages from the study team between your 
enrollment and up to four months after your delivery. The study team will also assist in 
connecting you with your primary care provider after your postpartum visit with your 
obstetric provider. Specifically, we may call your primary care provider’s office on your 
behalf and request a “health care maintenance” or “annual exam” appointment be 
scheduled. You always have the option to change or cancel this appointment.
Messages we send you via Patient Gateway will also appear in your medical record 
for other members of your care team to see.
For both groups, we will review your medical record after your delivery to see if/when 
you received any care within the Mass General Brigham health system and 
information on your health status for up to two years after your delivery.
We also may contact you once between four and twelve months after your delivery to 
ask you questions about your postpartum to primary care transition experience. You 
can decline to participate or answer any or all questions.
You may opt out of receiving messages or decline to participate in any survey, and/or 
withdraw from the study at any point without penalty.
A total of 360 people will participate in this study.

Privacy/Confidentiality We are required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to 
protect the privacy of health information obtained for research. More details related to 
the privacy of your health information is included on Pages 3-4 of this fact sheet.
All information collected as a part of this study will be kept confidential and secure. As 
with all studies, there is a very low risk that others may become aware of your 
participation or health information. The study procedures and its protections of your 
information have been approved by the Mass General Brigham Human Subjects 
Research committee. Once the study has completed, all information that could 
identify you, such as your name or medical record number, will be deleted. 
Study Information We will collect information on your health and pregnancy history, including about visits 
you have with providers within the Mass General Brigham health system. Data 
collected as a part of this study will not affect your clinical care directly. Any 
messages sent from the study team will be visible to you and your care team within 
the electronic medical record. Your de-identified information may be used or shared 
with other researchers without your additional informed consent.
Risks There are minimal risks to participate. 
Although we will make every effort to protect participant privacy and confidentiality, it 
is possible that your involvement in the study could become known to others. We will 
be sending messages via Patient Gateway, which is a HIPAA-compliant method for 
communicating with you. You have the option to also receive SMS text messages that 
will not have any identifiable or personal health information. There is a rare possibility 
that study participation or health information could become known to others despite 
the use of firewalls, password protection, and other security measures.
Costs You do not have to pay to take part in this research study. By attending a PCP visit, 
there is a possibility that you will incur a charge. Under the Affordable Care Act, 
commercial health plans are required to cover an annual Preventive Health Exam at 
no cost to the patient (no co-payment, co-insurance or deductible). MassHealth also 
covers these visits without a cost. However, if this visit turns into a “sick” or “disease 
management” visit, you may be billed for some or all aspects of the services provided, 
depending on your insurer. We will provide you information on how to check potential 
costs with your insurer prior to your visit.
Participation Those who participate will receive a $20 gift card after enrollment. 
Participation is voluntary, and you can withdrawal or stop the study at any time. 
Deciding not to participate won't affect medical care they receive at Mass General 
Brigham now or in the future, or any benefits they receive now or have a right to 
receive.

Option to Receive Text (SMS) Messages
Text messages by mobile/cell phones are a common form of communication. The Bridging the Gap from 
Postpartum to Primary Care study would like to send you no more than 3 text (SMS) messages as a part of the 
study, though this is optional and not required to participate in the Bridge Study. Texting over mobile/cell 
phones carries security risks because text messages to mobile/cell phones are not encrypted.  This means that 
information you send or receive by text message could be intercepted or viewed by an unintended recipient, or 
by your mobile/cell phone provider or carrier. 
Below are some important points about texting in as a part of a research study:
•Receiving text messages is optional in this study and not required to participate.
•Text messages are not encrypted, and therefore carry security risks. This research study and Mass 
General Brigham are not responsible for any interception of messages sent through unencrypted text 
message communications.  
•You will be responsible for all fees charged by your carrier’s service plan for text messaging.  This 
research study and Mass General Brigham are not responsible for any increased charges, data 
usage against plan limits or changes to data fees from the research texts.
•Text messaging should not be used in case of an emergency.  If you experience a medical emergency, 
call 911 or go to the nearest hospital emergency department.  
•You may decide to not send or receive text messages with staff associated with this research study at any 
time. You can do this in person or by sending the research number a text message that says “Stop 
Research Text.” 
•Your agreement applies to this research study only.  Agreeing to other texts from Mass General Brigham, 
for example appointment reminders, is a separate process.  Opting out of other texts from Mass General 
Brigham is a separate process as well.
•It is your responsibility to update your mobile/cell phone number with this research study in the event of a 
change.
Information Regarding the Privacy of Your Health Information
Federal law requires Mass General Brigham and its affiliated hospitals to protect the privacy of health 
information and related information that identifies you.  We refer to this information as “protected health 
information.” Your protected health information will be used and shared with others as explained below.  You 
are agreeing to the collection, use, and sharing of your protected health information as described in this 
information sheet. If you have questions, you may ask the researcher who is reviewing this information sheet 
with you or you can contact the researcher listed above. 
In this study, we may collect protected health information about you from:
•Past, present, and future medical records
•Research procedures, including but not limited to research visits, tests, interviews, and questionnaires
Why will protected health information about you be used or shared with others?
The main reasons include:
•to conduct  and oversee the research described in this information sheet for this study;
•to ensure the research meets legal, institutional, and accreditation requirements; and 
•to conduct public health activities (including reporting of adverse events or situations where you or 
others may be at risk of harm).
Who may see, use, and share your protected health information and why they may need to do so?
•Mass General Brigham researchers and staff involved in this study
•The sponsor(s) of the study, and people or groups it hires to help perform this research or to audit the 
research

•Other researchers and medical centers that are part of this study
•The Mass General Brigham ethics board 
•A group that oversees the data (study information) and safety of this study
•Non-research staff within Mass General Brigham who need identifiable information to do their jobs, 
such as for treatment, payment (billing), or hospital operations (such as assessing the quality of care or 
research)
•People or groups that we hire to do certain work for us, such as data storage companies, accreditors, 
insurers, and lawyers
•Federal agencies (such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and agencies 
within DHHS like the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and the Office for 
Human Research Protections), state agencies, and foreign government bodies that oversee, evaluate, 
and audit research, which may include inspection of your records
•Public health and safety authorities, if we learn information that could mean harm to you or others (such 
as to make required reports about communicable diseases or about child or elder abuse)
Some people or groups who get your protected health information might not have to follow the same privacy 
rules that we follow and might use or share your protected health information without your permission in ways 
that are not described in this form.  We share your protected health information only when we must, and we 
ask anyone who receives it from us to take measures to protect your privacy.  However, once your protected 
health information is shared outside Mass General Brigham, we cannot control all the ways that others use or 
share it and cannot promise that it will remain private.
The results of this research study may be published in a medical book or journal or used to teach 
others.  However, your name or other identifiable information  will not be used for these purposes without your 
specific permission.
For how long will protected health information about you be used or shared with others?
Because research is an ongoing process, we cannot give you an exact date when we will either destroy or stop 
using or sharing your protected health information.  Your permission to use and share your protected health 
information does not expire.
Your Privacy Rights
You have the right not to agree to our use and sharing of your protected health information for research; 
however, if you don’t agree, you can’t take part in this research study. However, refusing to agree will not affect 
your present or future care and will not cause any penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise 
entitled.
You have the right to withdraw your permission for the further use or sharing of your protected health 
information for this research study. If you want to withdraw your permission, you must notify the person in 
charge of this research study in writing at the name and address listed above.  Once permission is withdrawn, 
you cannot continue to take part in the study.
If you withdraw your permission, then to the extent that we have retained any protected health information that 
can be linked to you, we will stop using and sharing the protected health information further for the 
research.  However, we will not be able to take back information that has already been used or shared with 
others, and such information may continue to be used for certain purposes, such as to comply with the law or 
maintain the reliability of the study.
You have the right to see and get a copy of your protected health information that is used or shared for 
treatment or for payment.  To ask for this information, please contact the person in charge of this research 
study identified above.  You may only get such information after the research is finished.

Science Informed Intervention to Improve Chronic Disease Management 
among Postpartum Women
Version Date: 07/15/2022
Version Name/Number: v1.2
1.  Background and Significance
Burden of Chronic Disease and the Role of Primary Care
Chronic health conditions affect millions of people in the US each year. In 2018, 51.8% of adults 
had at least 1 chronic condition, and 27.2% had multiple conditions.1 The prevalence of chronic 
disease was higher in women compared to men, older adults (87.6% in adults ≥65 years old), 
and people with public insurance.1 Many chronic conditions, by their nature, develop over time 
and have risk factors that can be identified prior to the onset of disease. Strong evidence 
underpins prevention strategies for many conditions, which are advanced by the US 
Preventative Services Taskforce.2 While the long-term health of a patient is the responsibility of 
an entire health system, primary care providers (PCPs) provide an integral role in preventing, 
screening for, and managing disease across the lifespan. Studies have shown the health 
benefits of receiving regular care under a PCP.3–6
Despite the known benefits of having an identifiable usual source of care and the value of health 
care maintenance, the percent of the population with a PCP has been decreasing over time.7 
Consistently, adults who are younger (age 20-40 years) have the lowest rates of primary care 
use. In 2015, 44% and 36% of 20- and 30-year-olds had no identifiable source of primary care.7 
The proportion without primary care were also higher among racial/ethnic minority populations 
and among those who had less education, lower incomes, and no known comorbidities.7 The 
number of adults and the time elapsed without regular primary care follow-up can be considered 
missed opportunities to improve a patient’s current and long-term health. The disproportionate 
lack of primary care among certain subgroups of the population, often groups who already have 
worse health outcomes, only serves to widen the pre-existing disparities.
Pregnancy as a Window to Future Health
In the US, 98.2% of pregnant women receive some form of prenatal care, with the average 
patient having >10 visits during their pregnancy.8 During a pregnancy, women are screened for 
pre-existing and pregnancy-related conditions.9 In adults ages 18-39, the prevalence of obesity, 
hypertension, prediabetes/diabetes, and mental illness are estimated at 39%, 7.5%, 28%, 25%, 
respectively.10–13 Even for those who have no prior identified comorbidities, the most common

Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.07.15 Page 2 of 16pregnancy-related conditions—pregnancy-related hypertension and gestational diabetes (8% 
and 10% of pregnancies, respectively)—indicate a predisposition to or confer health risks that 
persist as women age. For example, over 25% of women with gestational diabetes will develop 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and women with pre-eclampsia have more than a two-fold risk of 
significant cardiovascular disease later in life.14,15 For these reasons, pregnancy is often 
considered a “window” into a woman’s future health and presents a unique opportunity to 
optimize a woman’s health status early in her life when she otherwise may not have been 
engaged in care.16 
Pregnancy as on Opportunity for Engagement with a Long-term Care Provider
Pregnancy is a period when women are highly engaged and active participants in their health 
care.17 It has been described as a “golden opportunity” to motivate women towards positive 
health behaviors, including prevention and management of chronic disease. However, women 
often fall off a “postpartum cliff” of health system engagement after the early postpartum 
period.18 A range of systemic, financial, and behavioral barriers often prevents patients from 
effectively transitioning to primary care. Postpartum women are often simply told to follow-up 
with their PCP without much information regarding the importance of this follow up care, without 
assistance in scheduling an appointment (or identifying a PCP if they don’t have one), and often 
without a direct transfer of relevant health information or accountability across providers. 
Postpartum women are left largely on their own to navigate this transition to primary care and, in 
particular, to navigate it at a time when they face the high cognitive and physical demands of 
caring for an infant. At this time of limited cognitive bandwidth, the importance of continuity of 
care for chronic conditions and active engagement in one’s longer-term health and wellbeing is 
unlikely to be salient and top-of-mind. These critical moments of unsupported health care 
transition can exacerbate pre-existing disparities in health and health care, with patients who 
are the least able to navigate the US health care system most likely to fall through the cracks.  
Momentum is building in US health and social safety net policy to facilitate healthy transitions 
from pregnancy to parenthood. For example, federal and state initiatives to expand pregnancy-
related Medicaid coverage from 60 days to one year postpartum have been proposed, and 
access to paid family leave is increasing. However, very little evidence exists on effective and 
cost-effective approaches to facilitating transitions to primary care and management of chronic 
diseases in the postpartum year.  
2. Specific Aims and Objectives 
The objective of the proposed study is to increase patient engagement in primary care after the 
immediate postpartum period for women with pregnancy-associated conditions that convey a 
long-term health risk. Specifically, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention bundle 
(patient-tailored health information, automatic scheduling of PCP appointment after delivery, 
and appointment reminder nudges) to increase patient attendance at a routine health care 
maintenance appointment (i.e., “annual exam”) within 4 months of delivery for women with 
obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and/or a mental health condition. 
Specific Aims:
1) Test the efficacy of an intervention bundle (patient-tailored health information, automatic 
scheduling of PCP appointment after delivery, and appointment reminder nudges) to 
increase patient attendance at a routine health care maintenance appointment within 4

Version 2022.07.15 Page 3 of 16months of delivery for women with obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and/or a mental 
health condition
2) Test the efficacy of the intervention bundle to improve compliance with the condition-
specific, guideline-based health screenings
3) Test the efficacy of the intervention bundle to reduce unscheduled or urgent encounters 
(e.g., emergency department visits) within the health system
3. General Description of Study Design
We will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing this intervention bundle to the receipt of 
generic information on the importance of primary care follow-up after delivery.  
Women will be randomized with equal probability into either a treatment or control arm, stratified 
by whether their pregnancy is covered by Medicaid or a commercial insurer and by patient race 
(white vs. non-white). The intervention combines several features designed to target reasons for 
low take-up of primary care among postpartum women (see Logic Model). We leverage the 
potential value of defaults/opt-out, pre-commitment, salient information, and reminders to 
encourage use of primary care within 4 months of delivery. Women in both the intervention and 
control arms will receive information via MGH’s patient portal toward the end of the pregnancy 
regarding the importance and benefits of primary care in the postpartum year. This information 
will be similar to, but reinforcing, the information they would receive from their obstetrician about 
following up with their primary care physician. In addition to this initial message, women in the 
treatment arm will receive the following intervention components, developed based on recent 
evidence regarding behavioral science approaches to activating health behaviors:19–21
➢Targeted messages about the importance and benefits of primary care, tailored to her 
condition(s). For example, for women with hypertensive disorders, the intervention will 
include information about the risk of developing chronic hypertension and the importance of 
blood pressure screenings to detect and manage this condition. 
➢Default scheduling into a primary care appointment at approximately 3-4 months after 
delivery. The patient will be scheduled for a primary care visit with their assigned primary 
care provider in the Mass General Brigham system. They will be given the opportunity to 
cancel the appointment, change the appointment day/time, or change the care provider 
either through the patient portal or over the phone with a research assistant working with the 
study (whichever they choose). 
➢Reminders about the appointment and importance of follow up primary care at 2-4 points 
during the postpartum period via the patient portal. 
➢Tailored language in the reminders based on recent evidence from behavioral science about 
the most effective approaches to increasing take-up. For example, messages will inform the 
patient that an appointment is being held for them at their doctor.

4. Subject Selection
Pregnant patients receiving prenatal care at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) will be 
targeted for recruitment. MGH conducts approximately 3500 deliveries per year, with roughly 
one-third of patients identifying as non-white and 35% of pregnancies covered by Medicaid.
Approximately 40% of the clinic population may ultimately be eligible to be approached.

Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.07.15 Page 6 of 16The eligibility criteria include:
•Estimated date of delivery and the following 4-month postpartum outcome 
assessment window completed prior to study end date
•Currently pregnant or within 2 weeks of delivery
•Have one or more of the following conditions: 
oChronic hypertension
oHypertensive disorders of pregnancy or risk factors for hypertensive disorders 
of pregnancy per the USPTF aspirin prescribing guidelines (e.g., history of 
pre-eclampsia, kidney disease, multiple gestation, autoimmune disease)22
oType 1 or 2 diabetes
oGestational diabetes
oObesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2)
oDepression or anxiety disorder 
•Have or be willing to be assigned a primary care provider within the Mass General 
Brigham network 
•Receive obstetric care at an MGH-affiliated outpatient prenatal clinic
•Has access to and be enrolled in the electronic health record patient portal and 
consents to be contacted via these modalities
•Able to read/speak English or Spanish language
•Age ≥18 years old
All women, regardless of race/ethnicity, who meet the eligibility criteria will be included. In 2019, 
3,789 women gave birth at the study institution, of whom 57% were white, 7% were black, 12% 
were Asian, 18% were Hispanic, and 6% declined to report their race/ethnicity. A similar 
distribution is expected for this study.
The study will distribute materials in English and Spanish languages. This encompasses >95% 
of patients who deliver at the study institution.
5. Subject Enrollment
This study will rely on recruiting for research through Patient Gateway and follow the IRB 
guidance and DHeC Research Checklist and training for this process.
In the month prior to the start of enrollment, all potentially eligible individuals (based on the 
criteria above) will be identified using RPDR and Epic Reporting search queries. This list (the 
“potentially eligible” list) will be provided to the DHeCare Research Team to build an RSH 
Record in Epic. This list will be updated monthly to identify newly eligible individuals (e.g., new 
diagnosis of gestational diabetes or new patient transferring into the practice) during the 
recruitment months and fed back to the DHeCare team to update “potentially eligible” list.
Once built and each month during recruitment phase, the study’s research coordinator (not 
study investigators) will send the IRB-approved Research Invitation Letter to patients who are 
eligible, not already enrolled, and have not declined to be sent research notifications through the 
portal. The Research Letter will employ an opt-out approach, asking individuals who do not wish 
to be approached in clinic or remotely to respond via PG messaging, email, or phone within 2 
weeks of receipt of the letter. Those who have “read” the letter and not opted out after 2 weeks 
Page 42 of 79
Compiled Summary of Protocol Amendments
Page 43 of 278
Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.07.15 Page 7 of 16will be moved from the “potentially eligible” list to the “waiting to be approached” list in the study 
workflow.
During recruitment months, the study coordinator will keep a log of patient’s upcoming 
appointments for those on the “waiting to be approached” list. They will then attempt to 
approach individuals for enrollment when they present for an in-person encounters (preferred). 
Patients will ideally be approached between 32-36 weeks of gestation, when feasible; however, 
priority will be given to patients at the latest gestation. For those Spanish-speaking patients, a 
hospital-based interpreter will be used when approaching/consenting patients.
The study staff will introduce the study and review the purpose of the study, the nature of the 
subject’s participation, the possible risks and discomforts associated with participation, the 
potential benefits of participation, a statement of the voluntary nature of participation, and a 
description of the mechanisms used to ensure confidentiality. 
All patients will receive study-related messages through Patient Gateway. In addition, patients 
will be asked if they would be willing to receive no more than 3 SMS messages to their personal 
cell phone during the first 4 months of the postpartum period. The study staff will review the 
specific concerns and risks about receiving unencrypted text messaging communications, as 
outlined by the MGB IRB. 
A waiver of documentation of informed consent is requested, as the study presents no more 
than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is 
normally required outside of the research context. Verbal consent will be obtained for 1) overall 
study participation and 2) optional SMS message participation, separately. Verbal consent will 
be obtained from both in-person and phone recruitment efforts.
A Study Fact Sheet, which summarizes the study details, risks, and benefits, will be provided to 
all subjects who are approached, either in-person, by mail, or electronically. This Study Fact 
Sheet also includes information supplied by the MGB IRB specifically related to the concerns 
and risks of receiving unencrypted SMS/text messages.
For tracking verbal consent, the study staff will keep a detailed log in REDCap documenting:
1) name of study staff performing consent,
2) date of attempted approach,
3) the method of attempted approach (in-person or via phone),
4) use of Spanish interpreter (yes/no),
5) subject agreement to be approached (agree/disagree),
6) attestation to full review of the study procedures/risks/benefits with the subject, as would 
be done during the process of reviewing a written consent form, 
7) attestation to review of supplemental consent to receive unencrypted SMS messages 
with the subject,
8) subject overall study participation status (enrolled, declined, deferred – agrees to be 
recontacted, deferred – wishes not to be recontacted),
9) if enrolled, unencrypted SMS text messaging participation (consents, declines),
10) attestation to Study Fact Sheet provided,
11) method by which Study Fact Sheet was provided (in-person, mail, electronic),
12) date in which Study Fact Sheet was provided (in-person, mail, electronic).

Version 2022.07.15 Page 8 of 166. STUDY PROCEDURES
The RA will keep a detailed log of all patients in the practice, if they are eligible, if they have 
been approached, and if they consented.
For those that agree to be enrolled, patients will be asked to complete a baseline survey to 
obtain voluntarily reported information on their demographics, socioeconomic status, health care 
visit history, and preferred primary care provider. Patients will also be asked to consent to being 
contacted by the research team via Patient Gateway messaging. A $20 gift card will be given at 
the time of enrollment for those that complete the questionnaire and receive the information 
sheet.
Randomization will occur via a prespecified random allocation sequence within strata. Within 
each stratum, the PIs will generate a random sequence of treatment-control allocation prior the 
enrollment of subjects. Then, as patients within strata are enrolled, they will be assigned to the 
intervention arm associated with that enrollment number. 
Control Group
Approximately 2 weeks before a patient’s estimated due date (EDD) or as soon as enrolled if 
this date has passed, the patient will be sent an information via the Patient Gateway on the 
importance of postpartum care and follow-up with their PCP.
Intervention Group
1. Tailored Information:
Approximately 2-4 weeks prior to the EDD (or later for those who are enrolled beyond 38 
weeks gestation or postnatally), the patient will be sent an information via the Patient 
Gateway on the importance of postpartum care and follow-up with their PCP, which also 
includes the name and phone number of their primary care provider and tailored 
information regarding their specific condition(s) (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, mental 
health).
2. Scheduled PCP Appointment:
Between 2-3 weeks after their delivery, the RA will call the patient’s PCP office and 
make an appointment for them between 3-4 months after delivery based on the 
scheduling preferences obtained in the initial survey.
3. Targeted Appointment Message:
After the PCP appointment has been made, the patient will be sent a Patient Gateway 
message saying that a PCP appointment has been reserved for them with the 
date/time/location information.
For those consenting to receive SMS messages, an unencrypted text message will also 
be sent simultaneously.
4. Nudge Reminders: 
Patient Gateway messages will be sent at approximately 4-8 weeks (goal: 4 weeks) and 
1-4 week (goal: 1 week) prior to their PCP appointment, reminding a patient of their 
upcoming appointment. 
For those consenting to receive SMS messages, an unencrypted text message will also 
be sent simultaneously.
All messages will be made available in English and Spanish.

Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.07.15 Page 9 of 16The text for these Patient Gateway messages is included in the submission. At the end of each 
patient message, patients will be given the opportunity to stop receiving study-related messages 
by emailing or calling the study staff. “Opt out” requests will be logged and patients removed 
from future planned study-related contact. 
The text for 3 SMS messages is included in the submission. SMS messages will be sent via 
Google Voice. We will follow standard recommendations from the MGB Research Information 
Security for using this system (included under Privacy and Confidentiality section).
The study team will review the patient’s EHR record for the primary and secondary outcome 
assessments. Patients will be asked to consent to have records reviewed up to 2 years after the 
date of their delivery to allow for long-term effects of the intervention on primary care use and 
health status. 
During the initial consent process, patients will be asked to agree to be potentially contacted at 
the end of the first 4-month follow-up period for a survey. Currently, this endline survey is not 
planned due to funding limitations; however, if funding becomes available, an IRB amendment 
will be submitted for review of the endline survey prior to being administered to any study 
subjects.
Deidentified data from this project may be shared outside of MGB with 1) Harvard T. H. Chan 
School of Public Health (Dr. Jessica Cohen) and 2) the study funders (J-PAL/NBER/NIA) for 
data sharing and reproducibility requirements and secondary statistical analysis. All data will be 
stripped of patient identifiers, per IRB guidance. No data will be shared without a formal Data 
Use Agreement with MGB.
5. Risks and Discomforts
There are minimal risks to participants. 
Patients will be reassured that nonparticipation will not affect clinical care. Patients will also be 
informed that the researchers with whom they will interact (e.g., during consent, face-to-face, 
during telephone interviews) are not health care providers. Participants will be consistently 
reminded that responses to any queries deemed sensitive or uncomfortable (e.g., country of 
origin/immigration status, income, previous history of abortion) should be considered optional, 
and they may decline to answer any question(s) and can refuse to continue the study at any 
point. Participants will be reassured that neither their opportunities for continued health care nor 
their relationships with health care providers will be jeopardized by study participation.
Health information collected as part of this study will be stored in REDCap. No identifiable data 
will be stored or downloaded on any personal or unauthorized computers. Study staff will 
access the data on institutionally purchased and managed computers that operate behind the 
health system’s security and firewall protections. Only the MGH study staff will have access to 
the identifiable data set. Once the study is completed, data will be deidentified such that it can 
be analyzed without risk of a breach of privacy or confidentiality. Any data that is shared outside 
of MGH will require a data use authorization.

Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.07.15 Page 10 of 16Although we will make every effort to protect participant privacy and confidentiality, it is possible 
that participants' involvement in the study could become known to others. For those in the 
intervention group, we will be sending personalized messages via the patient portal; for those 
providing additional consent, we will be sending unencrypted SMS messages that will not 
contain any personal protected health information. There is the rare possibility that study 
participation or health information could become known to others despite the use of firewalls, 
password protection, and other security measures. Standard procedures, as outlined by the 
MGB Research Information Security Office, will be followed to reduce this risk.
Those in the intervention arm will receive condition-specific information on pregnancy 
comorbidities and their implications on their long-term health. This information may cause 
anxiety or worry among patients; however, this same information is routinely reviewed by 
obstetric providers at visits. 
Individuals in the intervention group will be scheduled for an appointment with a primary care 
doctor. There is the possibility that this visit may result in a charge/cost for the patient. Under 
the Affordable Care Act, commercial health plans are required to cover an annual Preventive 
Health Exam at no cost to the patient (no co-payment, co-insurance or deductible). MassHealth 
also covers these visits without cost-sharing. However, if this visit turns into a “sick” or “disease 
management” visit, the patient may be billed for some or all aspects of the services provided, 
depending on their insurer. We will provide a link to the standard MGH information sheet on 
billing and charges for health care maintenance and directions for patients to contact their 
insurers prior to a visit to inquire about potential cost-sharing and/or deductibles for their visit. 
Patients will also be advised that some clinics may penalize individuals for not showing to a 
scheduled appointment (“no show” fee) and be given opportunities to request the appointment 
be canceled with each appointment reminder.
6. Benefits
Participants in the control group will receive information on the importance of postpartum care 
and transitioning to primary care after their delivery.
Participants in the intervention group will receive a bundle of interventions designed to increase 
attendance at primary care visits and facilitate the transition of care after their delivery.
The goal and potential benefits to the subjects in this trial is to increase patient engagement and 
connection with their primary care provider, receive recommended health screenings and 
directed counseling, and reduce unscheduled or urgent visits in the postpartum period.
7. Statistical Analysis
Statistical Methods
Analyses will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle.
Page 46 of 79
Compiled Summary of Protocol Amendments
Page 47 of 278
Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.07.15 Page 11 of 16Standard independent, two-sided, two-group comparison testing will be used to compare 
baseline characteristics between the two groups (chi squared tests, t tests, Wilcoxon rank sum 
tests, when appropriate).
The primary outcome will be attendance rates at PCP visit within 4 months after delivery, which 
will be compared between the groups using chi squared tests. Relative risks and 95% 
confidence intervals will be reported. 
Secondary outcomes will include measures of long-term health and health care use after the 
postpartum period. 
Subgroup analyses will be performed by a variety of patient characteristics including gestational 
age at enrollment, prenatal risk factors, morbidity types, patient race-ethnicity, payer, and 
enrollment location. 
P-value of less than 0.05 will be considered to indicate statistical significance.
Power Calculation
Most study calculations were estimated from the MGH 2020 delivery population. The rates of 
PCP follow-up were estimated from a randomly selected cohort of 50 patients who met the 
inclusion criteria. We plan to recruit patients into the study for a period of 4 months and expect 
1200 unique patients to be at the targeted gestational age during this period. Among these, we 
expect 88% to already have an assigned PCP in the network, leaving roughly 1,056 patients. 
Among these, we estimate that 40% have at least one of the targeted health conditions, leaving 
a target study population of 422 over the 4-month period. Based on previous studies conducted 
at MGH, we expect an 85% willingness to participate in the research, leaving an expected 
recruited population of 360 individuals. Based on our record extraction, we estimate that 33% of 
the targeted study population has a primary care visit within 4 months of delivery. Assuming an 
alpha of 0.05 and a baseline mean of 33%, with this expected sample size and power of 80%, 
our study has a minimum detectable effect size of roughly 15 percentage points (from 33% to 
48%). A previous study found that default scheduling into postpartum care appointments (with 
an OBGYN, not a PCP) increased postpartum care take-up by 24 percentage points; since our 
intervention incorporates defaults and other activating interventions, an MDE of 15 percentage 
points is reasonable.
8.   Monitoring and Quality Assurance
This is a minimal risk study in which the intervention involves default scheduling of 
appointments and patient messaging. Adverse events are not expected, and there is no 
physiologic plausibility for this intervention to cause any NIH-defined serious adverse events 
(e.g., death, prolonged hospitalization, significant disability).
No interim analyses are planned.
Adverse events will be defined and classified in accordance with NIH guidelines:
Page 47 of 79
Compiled Summary of Protocol Amendments

Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.07.15 Page 12 of 16Definition of Adverse Events (AE): Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence 
in a human subject, including any abnormal sign, symptom, or disease, temporally 
associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether considered 
related to the subject’s participation in the research or not.
Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE): Any AE that (1) results in death, (2) is life-
threatening, (3) results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization, (4) results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, (5) results in a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect, and/or (6) may jeopardize the subject’s health and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other five outcomes listed 
here.
In the unlikely event an AE or SAE occurs, it will be brought to the PI's attention, and the PI 
will classify the AE/SAE by severity, expectedness, and relatedness, as listed above. All events 
that are both serious and unexpected will be reported to Mass General Brigham's IRB, the NIA 
PO, and to the NIA Roybal DSMB within 48 hours of the research team's knowledge of the 
SAE. The summary of all other SAEs will be reported to the NIA and to the DSMB quarterly 
unless otherwise specified by the DSMB. Any unanticipated problem, defined as an issue 
related to the research suggesting the research places participants or others at greater risk 
than expected, will be reported to the IRB, the NIA PO, and to the Roybal DSMB within 48 
hours of discovery. If the problem involves death then reporting will occur within 24 hours, and 
this report will include a plan to correct the problem and prevent its occurrence. Any breach of 
PHI will be reported to the PI, who will report to the IRB and NIA PO within 24 hours of 
discovery.
The Roybal DSMB oversight is provided by the Standing Roybal DSMB, which includes the 
members listed: Andrea B. Troxel, ScD (chair); Abby King, PhD; Jerry Gurwitz, MD; Hae-Ra 
Han, PhD, RN, FAAN; Hang Lee, PhD; Ezra Golberstein, PhD; David Kim,  MD PhD; 
Christopher Celano, MD.
DSMB members will have no direct involvement with the study or conflict of interest with the 
investigators or institutions conducting the study. Each member has signed a COI statement 
which includes current affiliations, if any, with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies 
(e.g., stockholder, consultant), and any other relationship that could be perceived as a conflict 
of interest related to the study and/or associated with commercial interests pertinent to study 
objectives.
Data presented to the DSMB will be deidentified as to protect individual participants’ privacy and 
health information. Should the identity of a deidentified subject need to be  revealed, the DSMB 
request will be reviewed and ultimately at the discretion of the Mass General Brigham IRB.

Roybal Centers Program DSMB Charter 
The Roybal Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will act in an advisory capacity to the 
National Institute of Aging (NIA) Director to monitor participant safety, data quality and progress 
of the Roybal Centers . The Roybal DSMB would review and monitor pilot clinical trials that are 
determined by NIA to require DSMB oversight, and that are supported through the: 
 Roybal Centers for Translational Research on Aging (P30 Center Core Grants, under 
RFA-AG-19-006 ),  
 Roybal Centers for Translational Research on Dementia Care Provider Support (P30 
Center Core Grants, RFA-AG-19-007 ), and  
 Edward R. Roybal Coordinating Center (R24 Resource-Related Research Projects, 
RFA-AG-19-008 ).  
DSMB Responsibilities 
 Prior to each DSMB meeting, DSMB members will confirm that no conflict of interest 
exists with investigators or key personnel of the pilot trials that will be discussed. 
Interests that may create a potential conflict of interest should be disclosed to the DSMB 
prior to any discussion. The DSMB will determine how to handle any such potential 
conflict. The DSMB can require that a member with a potential conflict be present during 
discussions but abstain from voting or take other means deemed appropriate. NIA or 
DSMB Chair may request a member of the DSMB to leave the meeting in the event of 
unmanageable potential conflict or appearance of conflict. At the beginning of every 
DSMB meeting, DSMB members will reconfirm that no conflict of interests exists. 
 Review the entire IRB-approved study protocols and the MOP, with regard to participant 
safety, recruitment, randomization, intervention, data management, quality control and 
analysis and the informed consent documents. 
 Recommend changes to the protocol and the informed consent form, when applicable. 
 Identify the relevant data parameters and the format of the information to be regularly 
reported. 
 Recommend participant recruitment be initiated after receipt of a satisfactory protocol. If 
the need for modifications to the protocol, the MOP, consent form, DSMP or any other 
study document is indicated by the DSMB and/or the NIA Program Officer (PO), the 
DSMB will postpone its recommendation for the initiation of participant recruitment until 
after the receipt of a satisfactory revised protocol(s) or other study documents. 
 Presentations by PIs for pilot trials will be limited to 20 min, including questions and 
answer from DSMB members. Pilot PI will provide overview of the study; data and safety 
related issues and presentation will be limited to 15 min. At the discretion of the Chair, 
discussions may continue.  
 Review periodic (safety) reports from Safety Officers, as needed. 
 Review masked and unmasked data. These data can be related to safety, recruitment, 
randomization, retention, protocol adherence, trial operations, data completeness, form 
completion, intervention effects, gender and minority inclusion. 
Page 53 of 79
Compiled Summary of Protocol Amendments
Page 54 of 278
 Identify needs for additional data relevant to safety issues and request these data from 
the study investigators.  
 Propose additional analyses and periodically review developing data on safety and 
endpoints. 
 At each meeting, consider the rationale for continuation of the study, with respect to 
progress of randomization, retention, protocol adherence, data management, safety 
issues, and outcome data (if relevant) and make a recommendation for or against the 
trial's continuation.  
 Review and make recommendations on proposed protocol changes, and/or new 
protocols proposed during the trial. When the DSMBs are unblinded, the Boards may 
recommend to NIA to appoint a blinded working group of the DSMB to review the 
proposed protocol changes and make recommendations to NIA on whether to approve 
the requests. 
 Provide advice on issues regarding data discrepancies found by the data auditing 
system or other sources. 
 Review manuscripts of trial results if requested by the Board or the NIA PO who may 
seek DSMB review of manuscripts reporting major outcomes prior to their submission for 
publication. 
The DSMB will discharge itself from its duties when the study is complete. 
Membership 
Membership consists of persons completely independent of the investigators who have no 
financial, scientific, or other conflict of interest with the trial. Collaborators or associates of the PI 
are not eligible to serve on the DSMB. Written documentation attesting to absence of conflict of 
interest is required and will be collected by NIA. This DSMB will consist of [insert number] 
members having been approved by the Director of NIA.  
The DSMB includes experts in or representatives of the fields of: 
Geriatrics  
Dementia 
Psychiatry 
Health policy 
Psychology 
Biostatistics 
Dr. Andrea B. Troxel has been selected by NIA to serve as the Chairperson and is responsible 
for facilitating the meetings, reviewing the first draft of the meeting notes with the NIA Program 
Official and any decision making in the case of a tie vote. The Chair and NIA Program Officer 
are the contact people for the DSMB. The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research will provide 
the logistical management and support for the DSMB.  
Page 54 of 79
Compiled Summary of Protocol Amendments
Page 55 of 278
Meeting Format 
Meetings of the DSMB will be held regularly (e.g., every six to nine months) at the call of NIA or 
the DSMB Chair. The NIA Program Officer or designee (NIA staff) will be present at every 
meeting. An emergency meeting of the DSMB may be called at any time by the Chair or the 
NIA, should participant safety questions or other unanticipated problems arise. The DSMB 
should discuss the definition of a quorum. 
DSMB meetings will consist of open, closed and optional executive sessions, all closed to the 
public because discussions may address confidential participant data. The study PI and key 
staff members, DSMB members and NIA Program Officer and/or authorized NIA staff attend the 
open sessions . Discussions at these sessions focus on the review of the aggregate data, 
conduct and progress of the study, including participant accrual, protocol compliance, and 
problems encountered. Data by treatment group are not presented in the open session. 
The closed session  will be attended by unblinded study staff, the DSMB members and the NIA 
PO or designee(s). The NIA PO attends the closed and open sessions as an observer, not as a 
DSMB member, to answer any policy or administrative questions the DSMB members may 
have. The primary objective of the closed sessions is to review data by study group. To ensure 
participants safety and well-being, DSMBs for NIA-funded trials are required to review safety 
data by the actual treatment group. In many instances, safety data could also be the outcome 
data. Therefore, the unblinded Boards no longer review and provide recommendations to NIA 
on any, but safety-related protocol changes. All other protocol modifications are subject to 
review by the blinded working groups of the DSMBs. DSMBs’ working groups are appointed by 
NIA and provide their recommendations to NIA Director who makes decisions about whether to 
approve or decline proposed modifications.  
If necessary, an executive session  may be requested by the DSMB and will be attended only 
by voting DSMB members. The NIA Program Officer or designee is not permitted to attend the 
executive sessions. 
The NIA PO, DSMB Chair or the Principal Investigator will prepare the meeting agenda that 
usually includes the following: 
1. Welcome and introduction – study team, DSMB members, NIA and KAI staff  
2. Open session (review study protocol and its amendments, consent form, open study 
report, etc.) - study team, DSMB members, NIA and KAI staff  
3. Closed session (review closed session report, including unblinded data, etc.) – 
unblinded study statistician, DSMB members, NIA and KAI staff 
4. Executive session (optional, upon DSMB request) – DSMB members only 
5. Debriefing (optional, upon DSMB request, time permitting) - study team, DSMB 
members, NIA and KAI staff 
The DSMB may modify its processes and procedures at any time with the approval of the NIA 
POs. Pilot studies to be presented to the DSMB for review would be determined by NIA, 
annually, through an internal process that culminates in a meeting for Roybal studies. 
Meeting Materials  
DSMB interim report templates developed by the study staff or study-specific versions of NIA 
report templates for both the open and closed sessions and plans for interim analyses will be 
reviewed and either approved at the initial DSMB meeting or changes requested. Upon DSMB 
Page 55 of 79
Compiled Summary of Protocol Amendments
Page 56 of 278
request and approval by NIA, reports could be modified at any time during the study. All meeting 
materials should be sent by email to NIA at least 7 to 10 calendar days prior to the meeting. NIA 
PO will send the reports to the DSMB.  
Part 1 - Open Session Reports (Template for Single Site - Open ; Template for Multi Site - 
Open): Open session reports will include administrative reports that describe participants 
screened, enrolled, completed, and discontinued, as well as baseline characteristics of the 
study population. Other general information on study status may also be presented. Listings of 
adverse events and serious adverse events as well as any other information requested by the 
DSMB may also be in the open session report, but none of the data will be presented in an 
unblinded manner.  
Part 2 – Closed Session Report (Template for Single Site - Closed; Template for Multi Site - 
Closed ):  Closed session reports will present the same information as presented in the open 
session but by unblinded treatment group.  
 Reports from the DSMB 
A report containing the recommendations for continuation or modification of the study will be 
prepared by the DSMB, NIA Project Officer or NIA contractors. The draft report will be sent to 
the DSMB members for review and approval not later than three weeks after the meeting. Once 
approved by the DSMB members, the Program Official will forward the DSMB recommendations 
to the Principal Investigator indicating NIA’s concurrence with the report or its parts. It is the 
responsibility of the Principal Investigator to distribute the DSMB recommendation to all co-
investigators and to ensure that copies are submitted to the IRB that reviewed and approved the 
study documents. 
As it stated above, each meeting must include a recommendation to continue the study made 
by a formal DSMB majority or unanimous vote. Should the DSMB decide to issue a termination 
recommendation, the full vote of the DSMB is required. In the event of a split vote, majority vote 
will rule and a minority report should be appended. The DSMB Chair provides the tiebreaking 
vote in the event of a 50-50 split vote. 
A recommendation to terminate the study may be made by the DSMB at any time by majority 
vote. If this recommendation was made during the DSMB’s Executive session, the Chair should 
provide notify the NIA immediately by telephone and email. After the NIA Director makes a 
decision about whether to accept or decline the DSMB recommendation to terminate the study, 
NIA PO informs the PI about the decision.  
Confidentiality  
All materials, discussions, and proceedings of the DSMB are completely confidential. Members 
and other participants in DSMB meetings are expected to maintain confidentiality.

Bridging the Gap to Primary Care: A Behavioral Science 
Informed Intervention to Improve Chronic Disease Management 
among Postpartum Women
Brief Description of Intervention: We aim to evaluate the efficacy of a behavioral- 
science inspired intervention bundle (patient-tailored health information, automatic 
scheduling of PCP appointment after delivery, and appointment reminder nudges) to 
increase patient attendance at a routine health care maintenance appointment within 4 
months of delivery for women with obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and/or a mental 
health condition. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing this 
intervention bundle to the receipt of generic information on the importance of primary 
care follow-up after delivery.
Brief Description of Project Design
360 pregnant or recently postpartum patients with pre-existing or newly diagnosed 
health condition (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, mood disorder) will be randomly 
assigned to one of two interventions:
1. Routine care
2.Routine care + a bundle of behavioral-based interventions intended to improve 
a patient’s transition from postpartum to primary care
Stage of Behavioral Intervention Development Stage II (traditional efficacy testing)
NIH Phase III Clinical Trial? No
Note: An NIH-defined Phase III clinical trial is a broadly based prospective clinical 
investigation, usually involving several hundred or more human subjects, for the 
purpose of evaluating an experimental intervention in comparison with a standard or 
control intervention or comparing two or more existing treatments.

DSMP Template Updated 4 September 2019 11.0 PARTICIPANT SAFETY
1.1Potential Risks and Benefits for Participants 
Potential Risks:
There are minimal risks to participants. Those in the intervention arm will receive 
condition-specific information on pregnancy comorbidities and their implications on 
their long-term health. This information may cause anxiety or worry among patients; 
however, this same information is routinely reviewed by obstetrics providers at 
visits. Furthermore, individuals in the intervention group will be scheduled for an 
appointment with a primary care doctor. There is the possibility that this visit may 
result in a charge/cost for the patient. Under the Affordable Care Act, commercial
health plans are required to cover an annual Preventive Health Exam at no cost to the 
patient (no co-payment, co-insurance or deductible). MassHealth also covers these 
visits without cost-sharing. However, if this visit turns into a “sick” or “disease 
management” visit, the patient may be billed for some or all aspects of the services 
provided, depending on their insurer.
Potential Benefits :
Participants in the control group will receive information on the importance of 
postpartum care and transitioning to primary care after their delivery.
Participants in the intervention group will receive a bundle of interventions designed to 
increase attendance at primary care visits and facilitate the transition of care after their 
delivery.
The goal and potential benefits to the subjects in this trial is to increase patient 
engagement and connection with their primary care provider, receive recommended 
health screenings and directed counseling, and reduce unscheduled or urgent visits in 
the postpartum period.
1.2Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
This is a minimal-risk study in which the intervention involves default scheduling of 
appointments and patient messaging. Adverse events are not expected, and there is 
no physiologic plausibility for this intervention to cause any NIH-defined serious 
adverse events (e.g., death, prolonged hospitalization, significant disability).
Adverse events will be defined and classified in accordance with NIH guidelines:
1.2.1 Adverse Event (AE)/Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Definitions
Definition of Adverse Events: Any untoward or unfavorable medical 
occurrence in a human subject, including any abnormal sign, symptom, or
Page 61 of 79
Compiled Summary of Protocol Amendments
Page 62 of 278
DSMP Template Updated 4 September 2019 2disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, 
whether considered related to the subject’s participation in the research or not.
Definition of Serious Adverse Events: Any AE that (1) results in death, (2) is 
life-threatening, (3) results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization, (4) results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, (5) 
results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect, and/or (6) may jeopardize the 
subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the other five outcomes listed here.
1.2.2 Grading Scale 
Severity
Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and of minor 
irritation, causing no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not 
require therapy or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient. 
Moderate: Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the 
participant and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by 
simple therapeutic measures.
Severe: Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally 
require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. They are usually 
incapacitating.
Expectedness
Unexpected: nature or severity of the event is not consistent with information 
about the condition under study or intervention in the protocol or consent form. 
Expected: event is known to be associated with the intervention or condition 
under study. Because the intervention being delivered is informational in 
nature, there are no expected AEs or SAEs for this study.
1.2.3. Study Relatedness
Definitely Related: The adverse event is clearly related to the intervention- i.e. 
an event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the intervention, follows a known or expected response pattern to the 
suspected intervention, that is confirmed by improvement on stopping and 
reappearance of the event on repeated exposure and that could not be 
reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state. 
Possibly Related: An adverse event that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the study intervention, follows a known or 
expected response pattern to the suspected intervention, but that could readily 
have been produced by a number of other factors.
Not Related: The adverse event is clearly not related to the intervention- i.e. 
another cause of the event is most plausible; and/or a plausible temporal 
sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the event and the study intervention 
and/or causal relationships is considered implausible.
Page 62 of 79
Compiled Summary of Protocol Amendments
Page 63 of 278
DSMP Template Updated 4 September 2019 31.2.4. Timeline for Reporting
In the unlikely event an AE or SAE occurs, it will be brought to the PI's attention 
and the PI will classify the AE/SAE by severity, expectedness, and relatedness, 
as listed above. All events that are both serious and unexpected will be 
reported to Mass General Brigham's IRB, the NIA PO, and to the DSMB within 
48 hours of the research team's knowledge of the SAE. The summary of all 
other SAEs will be reported to the NIA and to the DSMB quarterly unless 
otherwise specified by the DSMB. Any unanticipated problem, defined as an 
issue related to the research suggesting the research places participants or 
others at greater risk than expected, will be reported to the IRB, the NIA PO, 
and to the DSMB within 48 hours of discovery. If the problem involves death 
then reporting will occur within 24 hours, and this report will include a plan to 
correct the problem and prevent its occurrence. Any breach of PHI will be 
reported to the PI, who will report to the IRB and NIA PO within 24 hours of 
discovery
1.3Protection Against Study Risks 
Informed Consent Process
Eligible patients who are interested in the study may agree to meet with a study staff 
member, who will describe the study, answer questions, and obtain written informed 
consent from eligible patients who elect to participate. The consent form will include 
information about the purpose of the study, the nature of the subject’s participation, 
the possible risks and discomforts associated with participation, the potential benefits 
of participation, a statement of the voluntary nature of participation, and a description 
of the mechanisms used to ensure confidentiality. All prospective subjects will be 
provided with an informed consent document written at the 8th-grade reading level in 
English and Spanish. The study staff also will provide a scripted oral form of the 
informed consent document and, to ensure comprehension, will ask prospective 
subjects to restate the main purposes and risks of the study, as well as restate that 
their access to ongoing care will not be influenced by their decision about 
participation. Individuals who cannot accurately restate these three elements of 
consent will not be enrolled, regardless of their interest.
Protection Against Risks
Health information collected as part of this study will be stored in REDCap. No 
identifiable data will be stored or downloaded on any personal or unauthorized 
computers. Study staff will access the data on institutionally purchased and managed 
computers that operate behind the health system’s security and firewall protections. 
Only the study MGH study staff will have access to the identifiable data set. Once the 
study is completed, data will be deidentified such that it can be analyzed without risk 
of a breach of privacy or confidentiality. Any data that is shared outside of MGH will 
require a data use authorization.
Page 63 of 79
Compiled Summary of Protocol Amendments
Page 64 of 278
DSMP Template Updated 4 September 2019 4Although we will make every effort to protect participant privacy and confidentiality, it 
is possible that participants' involvement in the study could become known to others. 
For those in the intervention group, we will be sending messages via text or the 
patient portal (per subject request); there is the possibility that study participation or 
health information could become known to others despite the use of firewalls, 
password protection, and other security measures.
For those in the intervention group, we will provide information about the possibility 
that their scheduled primary care visit may have an associated charge. We will provide 
the standard MGH information sheet on billing and charges for health care 
maintenance and directions for patients to contact their insurers prior to a visit to 
inquire about potential cost-sharing and/or deductibles for their visit.
2.0 INTERIM ANALYSIS
No interim analysis is planned as this study is no more than minimal risk for 
participants.
3.0 DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING
The Principal Investigator (PI), with the assistance of the research study staff, is 
responsible for ensuring participants’ safety and ensuring the study is implemented in 
accordance with the approved IRB protocol and procedures. The study protocol and 
DSMP will be reviewed by the NIA Roybal Center Data Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB), who will make recommendations regarding the modification, continuation, or 
conclusion of the trial.
3.6Frequency of Data and Safety Monitoring
Any AEs or SAEs will be dealt with as described in section above. The frequency of 
additional monitoring, including the submission of safety reports, will be determined by 
the DSMB and safety officer (if applicable).
3.7Data Analysis and Coordination
The PIs and research assistant will be responsible for data processing and analysis. 
All data will be directly available to the DSMB and Program Officer on request, except 
raw data identifying individual participants. Any data sharing requests of patient 
information outside the research team and the approved IRB protocol will be facilitated 
through the Mass General Brigham Office of Research Management.
3.8Content of Data and Safety Monitoring Report
We anticipate the content of the data and safety monitoring report will include study 
progress, recruitment and retention status, and safety information.

Having a primary care provider (PCP) and seeing 
them at least once a year is important for your 
health. These providers can identify health risks 
and help you improve your health through your 
entire life.
These providers have different roles than your 
obstetrician (pregnancy doctor) or midwife. It is 
recommended that all patients see their PCP after 
your pregnancy ends and your relationship with 
your pregnancy provider has ended (typically 6-12 
weeks after your delivery).
If you have questions about finding or seeing your 
PCP after your delivery, please ask your 
pregnancy provider or call your PCP.

No patients have been enrolled or approached yet. 
The following amendments are being made:  
1) minor adjustments to the enrollment criteria  
2) minor updates to the language in the patient messages  
3) added additional component to intervention arm (study team messages PCP that their patient is 
recently postpartum and an appointment has been scheduled for them) 
4) added explicit language on the possibility of PCP visit cost to study messages and study fact sheet at 
request of project funder 
5) minor sample size adjustments after more accurate estimates on potential eligible patients 
6) study schema changed to reflect accurate outcome assessment time point 
 
  
Provide rationale for the proposed changes: 
Rationale:  
1) minor adjustments to the enrollment criteria  
- requires patient to have a PCP listed in Epic as there is limited to no available of "New" primary care 
appointments at MGH  
- avoids enrollment of a patient with a new diagnosis or being evaluated for a stillbirth given the 
extenuating circumstances associated with this encounter 
2) minor updates to the language in the patient messages  
- updated to be consistent with a 6th grade reading level 
- added information on the possibility of PCP visit cost at the recommendation of the project funder 
3) added additional component to intervention arm (study team messages PCP that their patient is 
recently postpartum and an appointment has been scheduled for them) 
- after discussion with Dr. Ray (PCP on the study team), this element was felt to be important 
4) added explicit language on the possibility of PCP visit cost to study messages and study fact sheet  
- added at the recommendation of the project funder 
5) minor sample size adjustments  
- more accurate estimates on potential eligible patients became available 
6) study schema changed to reflect accurate outcome assessment time point 
- the components of the intervention arm will be timed around the estimated date of delivery for 
consistency (not the actual variable date) 
 
  
Will the proposed change(s) significantly alter the risk to benefit assessment the IRB relied upon to approve 
the protocol?

Research Study Fact Sheet
Bridging the Gap from Postpartum to Primary Care (The Bridge Study)
Principal Investigators Mark Clapp, MD MPH (Massachusetts General Hospital)
Jessica Cohen, PhD (Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health)
Overview This is a research study being conducted among pregnant and recently postpartum 
individuals who receive care at MGH.
Purpose Your primary care provider (PCP) is responsible for managing and overseeing your 
current and long-term health. The purpose of this project is to improve primary care in 
the postpartum period. 
Sponsor This research is being sponsored by the National Institute on Aging, MIT Roybal 
Center for Translational Research to Improve Health Care for the Aging and the 
NBER Roybal Center for Behavior Change in Health.
Contact We sent you a Patient Gateway message about this study because you are a person 
who may particularly benefit from receiving postpartum primary care. 
Study Details If you agree to participate, we will ask you a few questions about your health and visit 
history at the time of enrollment, which are all optional.
You will then be randomly assigned (50/50 chance) to be in the “standard care” group 
or the “facilitated transition” group. Regardless of which group you are assigned, you 
will continue to receive standard prenatal and postpartum care from your obstetrical 
care provider. 
In the “standard care” group, you will receive a limited number of messages (less than 
5) from the study team. 
In the “facilitated transition” group, you will receive a limited number of  messages 
(less than 5) from the study team between your enrollment and up to four months 
after your delivery. The study team will also assist in connecting you with your primary 
care provider after your delivery. Specifically, we may call your primary care 
provider’s office on your behalf to help schedule an appointment. You always have 
the option to change or cancel this appointment. We also will message your PCP that 
you have recently delivered and that a follow-up appointment is being arranged.
Messages that we send you via Patient Gateway will also appear in your medical 
record for other members of your care team to see.
For both groups, we will review your medical record after your delivery to see if/when 
you received any care within the Mass General Brigham health system and 
information on your health status for up to two years after your delivery.
We also may contact you once between four and twelve months after your delivery to 
ask you questions about your postpartum care experience. You can decline to 
participate or answer any or all questions.
You may opt out of receiving messages or decline to participate in any survey, and/or 
withdraw from the study at any point without penalty.
Approximately 350 people will participate in this study.
Privacy/Confidentiality We are required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to 
protect the privacy of health information obtained for research. More details related to 
the privacy of your health information is included on Pages 3-4 of this fact sheet.

All information collected as a part of this study will be kept confidential and secure. As 
with all studies, there is a very low risk that others may become aware of your 
participation or health information. The study procedures and its protections of your 
information have been approved by the Mass General Brigham Human Subjects 
Research committee. Once the study has completed, all information that could 
identify you, such as your name or medical record number, will be deleted. 
Study Information We will collect information on your health and pregnancy history, including about visits 
you have with providers within the Mass General Brigham health system. Data 
collected as a part of this study will not affect your clinical care directly. Any 
messages sent from the study team will be visible to you and your care team within 
the electronic medical record. Your de-identified information may be used or shared 
with other researchers without your additional informed consent.
Risks There are minimal risks to participate. 
Although we will make every effort to protect participant privacy and confidentiality, it 
is possible that your involvement in the study could become known to others. We will 
be sending messages via Patient Gateway, which is a HIPAA-compliant method for 
communicating with you. You have the option to also receive SMS text messages that 
will not have any identifiable or personal health information. There is a rare possibility 
that study participation or health information could become known to others despite 
the use of firewalls, password protection, and other security measures.
Costs You do not have to pay to take part in this research study. 
By attending a PCP visit, there is a possibility that you will incur a charge, such as a 
co-pay or deductible payment, depending on your individual insurance coverage. If 
you do not have insurance, you may have to pay for the entire cost of the visit. We will 
provide you information on how to check potential costs with your insurer prior to your 
visit.
Participation Those who participate will receive a $20 gift card after enrollment. 
Participation is voluntary, and you can withdraw or stop the study at any time. 
Deciding not to participate won't affect medical care you receive at Mass General 
Brigham now or in the future, or any benefits they receive now or have a right to 
receive.

Option to Receive Text (SMS) Messages
Text messages by mobile/cell phones are a common form of communication. Our study team would like to 
send you no more than 3 text (SMS) messages as a part of the study, though this is optional and not 
required to participate in the Bridge Study. Texting over mobile/cell phones carries security risks because 
text messages to mobile/cell phones are not encrypted.  This means that information you send or receive by 
text message could be intercepted or viewed by an unintended recipient, or by your mobile/cell phone provider 
or carrier. 
Below are some important points about texting as a part of a research study:
•Receiving text messages is optional in this study and not required to participate.
•Text messages are not encrypted, and therefore carry security risks. This research study and Mass 
General Brigham are not responsible for any interception of messages sent through unencrypted text 
message communications.  
•You will be responsible for all fees charged by your carrier’s service plan for text messaging.  This 
research study and Mass General Brigham are not responsible for any increased charges, data 
usage against plan limits or changes to data fees from the research texts.
•Text messaging should not be used in case of an emergency.  If you experience a medical emergency, 
call 911 or go to the nearest hospital emergency department.  
•You may decide to not send or receive text messages with staff associated with this research study at any 
time. You can do this in person or by sending the research number a text message that says “Stop 
Research Text.” 
•Your agreement applies to this research study only.  Agreeing to other texts from Mass General Brigham, 
for example appointment reminders, is a separate process.  Opting out of other texts from Mass General 
Brigham is a separate process as well.
•It is your responsibility to update your mobile/cell phone number with this research study in the event of a 
change.
Information Regarding the Privacy of Your Health Information
Federal law requires Mass General Brigham and its affiliated hospitals to protect the privacy of health 
information and related information that identifies you.  We refer to this information as “protected health 
information.” Your protected health information will be used and shared with others as explained below.  You 
are agreeing to the collection, use, and sharing of your protected health information as described in this 
information sheet. If you have questions, you may ask the researcher who is reviewing this information sheet 
with you or you can contact the researcher listed above.

Project Title: Bridging the Gap from Postpartum to Primary Care: A Behavioral 
Science Informed Intervention to Improve Chronic Disease Management 
among Postpartum Women
Version Date: 09/01/2022
Version Name/Number: v1.3
1.  Background and Significance
Burden of Chronic Disease and the Role of Primary Care
Chronic health conditions affect millions of people in the US each year. In 2018, 51.8% of adults 
had at least 1 chronic condition, and 27.2% had multiple conditions.1 The prevalence of chronic 
disease was higher in women compared to men, older adults (87.6% in adults ≥65 years old), 
and people with public insurance.1 Many chronic conditions, by their nature, develop over time 
and have risk factors that can be identified prior to the onset of disease. Strong evidence 
underpins prevention strategies for many conditions, which are advanced by the US 
Preventative Services Taskforce.2 While the long-term health of a patient is the responsibility of 
an entire health system, primary care providers (PCPs) provide an integral role in preventing, 
screening for, and managing disease across the lifespan. Studies have shown the health 
benefits of receiving regular care under a PCP.3–6
Despite the known benefits of having an identifiable usual source of care and the value of health 
care maintenance, the percent of the population with a PCP has been decreasing over time.7 
Consistently, adults who are younger (age 20-40 years) have the lowest rates of primary care 
use. In 2015, 44% and 36% of 20- and 30-year-olds had no identifiable source of primary care.7 
The proportion without primary care were also higher among racial/ethnic minority populations 
and among those who had less education, lower incomes, and no known comorbidities.7 The 
number of adults and the time elapsed without regular primary care follow-up can be considered 
missed opportunities to improve a patient’s current and long-term health. The disproportionate 
lack of primary care among certain subgroups of the population, often groups who already have 
worse health outcomes, only serves to widen the pre-existing disparities.
Pregnancy as a Window to Future Health
In the US, 98.2% of pregnant women receive some form of prenatal care, with the average 
patient having >10 visits during their pregnancy.8 During a pregnancy, women are screened for 
pre-existing and pregnancy-related conditions.9 In adults ages 18-39, the prevalence of obesity, 
hypertension, prediabetes/diabetes, and mental illness are estimated at 39%, 7.5%, 28%, 25%, 
respectively.10–13 Even for those who have no prior identified comorbidities, the most common 
Page 8 of 29
Compiled Summary of Protocol Amendments

Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.09.01 Page 2 of 15pregnancy-related conditions—pregnancy-related hypertension and gestational diabetes (8% 
and 10% of pregnancies, respectively)—indicate a predisposition to or confer health risks that 
persist as women age. For example, over 25% of women with gestational diabetes will develop 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and women with pre-eclampsia have more than a two-fold risk of 
significant cardiovascular disease later in life.14,15 For these reasons, pregnancy is often 
considered a “window” into a woman’s future health and presents a unique opportunity to 
optimize a woman’s health status early in her life when she otherwise may not have been 
engaged in care.16 
Pregnancy as on Opportunity for Engagement with a Long-term Care Provider
Pregnancy is a period when women are highly engaged and active participants in their health 
care.17 It has been described as a “golden opportunity” to motivate women towards positive 
health behaviors, including prevention and management of chronic disease. However, women 
often fall off a “postpartum cliff” of health system engagement after the early postpartum 
period.18 A range of systemic, financial, and behavioral barriers often prevents patients from 
effectively transitioning to primary care. Postpartum women are often simply told to follow-up 
with their PCP without much information regarding the importance of this follow up care, without 
assistance in scheduling an appointment (or identifying a PCP if they don’t have one), and often 
without a direct transfer of relevant health information or accountability across providers. 
Postpartum women are left largely on their own to navigate this transition to primary care and, in 
particular, to navigate it at a time when they face the high cognitive and physical demands of 
caring for an infant. At this time of limited cognitive bandwidth, the importance of continuity of 
care for chronic conditions and active engagement in one’s longer-term health and wellbeing is 
unlikely to be salient and top-of-mind. These critical moments of unsupported health care 
transition can exacerbate pre-existing disparities in health and health care, with patients who 
are the least able to navigate the US health care system most likely to fall through the cracks.  
Momentum is building in US health and social safety net policy to facilitate healthy transitions 
from pregnancy to parenthood. For example, federal and state initiatives to expand pregnancy-
related Medicaid coverage from 60 days to one year postpartum have been proposed, and 
access to paid family leave is increasing. However, very little evidence exists on effective and 
cost-effective approaches to facilitating transitions to primary care and management of chronic 
diseases in the postpartum year.  
2. Specific Aims and Objectives 
The objective of the proposed study is to increase patient engagement in primary care after the 
immediate postpartum period for women with pregnancy-associated conditions that convey a 
long-term health risk. Specifically, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention bundle 
(automatic scheduling of PCP appointment after delivery, salient labeling, and appointment 
reminder nudges) to increase patient attendance at a primary care provider appointment (within 
4 months of delivery for women with or at risk for obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and/or a 
mental health condition. 
Specific Aims:
1) Test the efficacy of an intervention bundle (patient-tailored health information, automatic 
scheduling of PCP appointment after delivery, and appointment reminder nudges) to 
increase patient attendance at a primary care provider appointment within 4 months of

Version 2022.09.01 Page 3 of 15delivery for women with obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and/or a mental health 
condition
2) Test the efficacy of the intervention bundle to improve compliance with the condition-
specific, guideline-based health screenings
3) Test the efficacy of the intervention bundle to reduce unscheduled or urgent encounters 
(e.g., emergency department visits) within the health system
3. General Description of Study Design
We will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing this intervention bundle to the receipt of 
generic information on the importance of primary care follow-up after delivery.  
Women will be randomized with equal probability into either a treatment or control arm. The 
intervention combines several features designed to target reasons for low take-up of primary 
care among postpartum women (see Logic Model). We leverage the potential value of 
defaults/opt-out, salient labels, and reminders to encourage use of primary care within 4 months 
of delivery. Women in both the intervention and control arms will receive information via MGH’s 
patient portal toward the end of the pregnancy regarding the importance of transitions to primary 
care in the postpartum year. This information will be similar to, but reinforcing, the information 
they would receive from their obstetrician about following up with their primary care physician. In 
addition to this initial message, women in the treatment arm will receive the following 
intervention components, developed based on recent evidence regarding behavioral science 
approaches to activating health behaviors:19–21
➢Targeted messages about the importance and benefits of primary care. 
➢Default scheduling into a primary care appointment at approximately 3-4 months after 
delivery. The patient will be scheduled for a primary care visit with their assigned primary 
care provider in the Mass General Brigham system. They will be informed of the option to 
cancel the appointment, change the appointment day/time, or change the care provider 
either through the patient portal). 
➢Reminders about the appointment and importance of follow up primary care at 2-4 points 
during the postpartum period via the patient portal. 
➢Tailored language in the reminders based on recent evidence from behavioral science about 
the most effective approaches to increasing take-up. For example, messages will inform the 
patient that an appointment has been reserved for them at their doctor.

4. Subject Selection
Pregnant patients receiving prenatal care at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) will be 
targeted for recruitment. MGH conducts approximately 3500 deliveries per year, with roughly 
one-third of patients identifying as non-white and 35% of pregnancies covered by Medicaid.
Approximately 49% of the clinic population may ultimately be eligible to be approached.
The eligibility criteria include:
•Estimated date of delivery and the following 4-month postpartum outcome 
assessment window completed prior to study end date
•Currently pregnant or within 2 weeks of delivery
•Have one or more of the following conditions: 
oChronic hypertension
oHypertensive disorders of pregnancy or risk factors for hypertensive disorders 
of pregnancy per the USPTF aspirin prescribing guidelines (e.g., history of 
pre-eclampsia, kidney disease, multiple gestation, autoimmune disease)22
oType 1 or 2 diabetes

oObesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2)
oDepression or anxiety disorder 
•Have a primary care provider listed in the patient’s medical record 
•Receive obstetric care at an MGH-affiliated outpatient prenatal clinic
•Has access to and be enrolled in the electronic health record patient portal and 
consents to be contacted via these modalities
•Able to read/speak English or Spanish language
•Age ≥18 years old
•Not diagnosed with or undergoing evaluation for stillbirth/fetal demise
All women, regardless of race/ethnicity, who meet the eligibility criteria will be included. In 2019, 
3,789 women gave birth at the study institution, of whom 57% were white, 7% were black, 12% 
were Asian, 18% were Hispanic, and 6% declined to report their race/ethnicity. A similar 
distribution is expected for this study.
The study will distribute materials in English and Spanish languages. This encompasses >95% 
of patients who deliver at the study institution.
5. Subject Enrollment
This study will rely on recruiting for research through Patient Gateway and follow the IRB 
guidance and DHeC Research Checklist and training for this process.
In the month prior to the start of enrollment, all potentially eligible individuals (based on the 
criteria above) will be identified using RPDR and Epic Reporting search queries. This list (the 
“potentially eligible” list) will be provided to the DHeCare Research Team to build an RSH 
Record in Epic. This list will be updated monthly to identify newly eligible individuals (e.g., new 
diagnosis of gestational diabetes or new patient transferring into the practice) during the 
recruitment months and fed back to the DHeCare team to update “potentially eligible” list.
Once built and each month during recruitment phase, the study’s research coordinator (not 
study investigators) will send the IRB-approved Research Invitation Letter to patients who are 
eligible, not already enrolled, and have not declined to be sent research notifications through the 
portal. The Research Letter will employ an opt-out approach, asking individuals who do not wish 
to be approached in clinic or remotely to respond via PG messaging, email, or phone within 2 
weeks of receipt of the letter. Those who have “read” the letter and not opted out after 2 weeks 
will be moved from the “potentially eligible” list to the “waiting to be approached” list in the study 
workflow.
During recruitment months, the study coordinator will keep a log of patient’s upcoming 
appointments for those on the “waiting to be approached” list. They will then attempt to 
approach individuals for enrollment when they present for an in-person encounters (preferred). 
Patients will ideally be approached between 32-36 weeks of gestation, when feasible; however, 
priority will be given to patients at the latest gestation. For those Spanish-speaking patients, a 
hospital-based interpreter will be used when approaching/consenting patients.

Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.09.01 Page 7 of 15The study staff will introduce the study and review the purpose of the study, the nature of the 
subject’s participation, the possible risks and discomforts associated with participation, the 
potential benefits of participation, a statement of the voluntary nature of participation, and a 
description of the mechanisms used to ensure confidentiality. 
All patients will receive study-related messages through Patient Gateway. In addition, patients 
will be asked if they would be willing to receive no more than 5 SMS messages to their personal 
cell phone during the first 4 months of the postpartum period. The study staff will review the 
specific concerns and risks about receiving unencrypted text messaging communications, as 
outlined by the MGB IRB. 
A waiver of documentation of informed consent is requested, as the study presents no more 
than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is 
normally required outside of the research context. Verbal consent will be obtained for 1) overall 
study participation and 2) optional SMS message participation, separately. Verbal consent will 
be obtained from both in-person and phone recruitment efforts.
A Study Fact Sheet, which summarizes the study details, risks, and benefits, will be provided to 
all subjects who are approached, either in-person, by mail, or electronically. This Study Fact 
Sheet also includes information supplied by the MGB IRB specifically related to the concerns 
and risks of receiving unencrypted SMS/text messages.
For tracking verbal consent, the study staff will keep a detailed log in REDCap documenting:
1) name of study staff performing consent,
2) date of attempted approach,
3) the method of attempted approach (in-person or via phone),
4) use of Spanish interpreter (yes/no),
5) subject agreement to be approached (agree/disagree),
6) attestation to full review of the study procedures/risks/benefits with the subject, as would 
be done during the process of reviewing a written consent form, 
7) attestation to review of supplemental consent to receive unencrypted SMS messages 
with the subject,
8) subject overall study participation status (enrolled, declined, deferred – agrees to be 
recontacted, deferred – wishes not to be recontacted),
9) if enrolled, unencrypted SMS text messaging participation (consents, declines),
10) attestation to Study Fact Sheet provided,
11) method by which Study Fact Sheet was provided (in-person, mail, electronic),
12) date in which Study Fact Sheet was provided (in-person, mail, electronic).
6. STUDY PROCEDURES
The RA will keep a detailed log of all patients in the practice, if they are eligible, if they have 
been approached, and if they consented.
For those that agree to be enrolled, patients will be asked to complete a baseline survey to 
obtain voluntarily reported information on their demographics, socioeconomic status, health care 
visit history, and primary care provider. Patients will also be asked to consent to being contacted

Version 2022.09.01 Page 8 of 15by the research team via Patient Gateway messaging. A $20 gift card will be given at the time of 
enrollment for those that complete the questionnaire and receive the information sheet.
Randomization will occur via a prespecified random allocation sequence within strata. Within 
each stratum, the PIs will generate a random sequence of treatment-control allocation prior the 
enrollment of subjects. Then, as patients within strata are enrolled, they will be assigned to the 
treatment arm associated with that enrollment number. 
Control Group
Approximately 2 weeks before a patient’s estimated due date (EDD) or as soon as enrolled if 
this date has passed, the patient will be sent information via the Patient Gateway on the 
importance of postpartum care and follow-up with their PCP.
Intervention Group
1. Tailored Information:
Approximately 2-4 weeks prior to the EDD (or later for those who are enrolled beyond 38 
weeks gestation or postnatally), the patient will be sent an information via the Patient 
Gateway on the importance of postpartum care and follow-up with their PCP, which also 
includes the name and phone number of their primary care provider. 
2. Scheduled PCP Appointment:
Between 2-3 weeks after their delivery, the RA will call the patient’s PCP office and 
make an appointment for them between 3-4 months after delivery based on the 
scheduling preferences obtained in the initial survey.
3. Targeted Appointment Message with Salient Labeling:
After the PCP appointment has been made, the patient will be sent a Patient Gateway 
message saying that a PCP appointment has been reserved for them with the 
date/time/location information.
For those consenting to receive SMS messages, an unencrypted text message will also 
be sent simultaneously.
4. Nudge Reminders: 
Patient Gateway messages will be sent at approximately 4-8 weeks (goal: 4 weeks) and 
1-4 week (goal: 1 week) prior to their PCP appointment, reminding a patient of their 
upcoming appointment. 
For those consenting to receive SMS messages, an unencrypted text message will also 
be sent simultaneously.
5. Facilitated PCP Communication:
A study staff member will send the patient’s PCP an Epic Inbasket message that the 
patient 1) is recently postpartum, 2) has or developed health conditions that need long-
term management, and 3) has been scheduled (or attempted to be scheduled) for a 
follow-up visit.
All messages will be made available in English and Spanish.
The text for these Patient Gateway messages is included in the submission. At the end of each 
patient message, patients will be given the opportunity to stop receiving study-related messages

Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.09.01 Page 9 of 15The text for 3 SMS messages is included in the submission. SMS messages will be sent via 
Google Voice. We will follow standard recommendations from the MGB Research Information 
Security for using this system (included under Privacy and Confidentiality section).
The study team will review the patient’s EHR record for the primary and secondary outcome 
assessments. Patients will be asked to consent to have records reviewed up to 2 years after the 
date of their delivery to allow for long-term effects of the intervention on primary care use and 
health status. 
During the initial consent process, patients will be asked to agree to be potentially contacted at 
the end of the first 4-month follow-up period for a survey. Currently, this endline survey is not 
planned due to funding limitations; however, if funding becomes available, an IRB amendment 
will be submitted for review of the endline survey prior to being administered to any study 
subjects.
Deidentified data from this project may be shared outside of MGB with the study funders (J-
PAL/NBER/NIA) for data sharing and reproducibility requirements and secondary statistical 
analysis. All data will be stripped of patient identifiers, per IRB guidance. No data will be shared 
without a formal Data Use Agreement with MGB.
6. Risks and Discomforts
There are minimal risks to participants. 
Patients will be reassured that nonparticipation will not affect clinical care. Patients will also be 
informed that the researchers with whom they will interact (e.g., during consent, face-to-face, 
during telephone interviews) are not health care providers. Participants will be consistently 
reminded that responses to any queries deemed sensitive or uncomfortable (e.g., country of 
origin/immigration status, income, previous history of abortion) should be considered optional, 
and they may decline to answer any question(s) and can refuse to continue the study at any 
point. Participants will be reassured that neither their opportunities for continued health care nor 
their relationships with health care providers will be jeopardized by study participation.
Health information collected as part of this study will be stored in REDCap. No identifiable data 
will be stored or downloaded on any personal or unauthorized computers. Study staff will 
access the data on institutionally purchased and managed computers that operate behind the 
health system’s security and firewall protections. Only the MGH study staff will have access to 
the identifiable data set. Once the study is completed, data will be deidentified such that it can 
be analyzed without risk of a breach of privacy or confidentiality. Any data that is shared outside 
of MGH will require a data use authorization.
Although we will make every effort to protect participant privacy and confidentiality, it is possible 
that participants' involvement in the study could become known to others. For those in the 
intervention group, we will be sending personalized messages via the patient portal; for those 
providing additional consent, we will be sending unencrypted SMS messages that will not 
contain any personal protected health information. There is the rare possibility that study 
participation or health information could become known to others despite the use of firewalls,

Version 2022.09.01 Page 10 of 15password protection, and other security measures. Standard procedures, as outlined by the 
MGB Research Information Security Office, will be followed to reduce this risk.
Individuals in the intervention group will be scheduled for an appointment with a primary care 
doctor. There is the possibility that this visit may result in a charge/cost for the patient. Under 
the Affordable Care Act, commercial health plans are required to cover an annual Preventive 
Health Exam at no cost to the patient (no co-payment, co-insurance or deductible). MassHealth 
also covers these visits without cost-sharing. However, if this visit turns or scheduled as into a 
“sick” or “disease management” visit, the patient may be billed for some or all aspects of the 
services provided, depending on their insurer. We will provide directions for patients on how to 
to contact their insurers or PCP’s office prior to the visit to inquire about potential cost-sharing 
and/or deductibles. Patients will also be advised that some clinics may penalize individuals for 
not showing to a scheduled appointment (“no show” fee) and be given opportunities to request 
the appointment be canceled or rescheduled with each appointment reminder.
7. Benefits
Participants in the control group will receive information on the importance of postpartum care 
and transitioning to primary care after their delivery.
Participants in the intervention group will receive a bundle of interventions designed to increase 
attendance at primary care visits and facilitate the transition of care after their delivery.
The goal and potential benefits to the subjects in this trial is to increase patient engagement and 
connection with their primary care provider, receive recommended health screenings and 
directed counseling, and reduce unscheduled or urgent visits in the postpartum period.
8. Statistical Analysis
Statistical Methods
Analyses will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle.
Standard independent, two-sided, two-group comparison testing will be used to compare 
baseline characteristics between the two groups (chi squared tests, t tests, Wilcoxon rank sum 
tests, when appropriate).
The primary outcome will be attendance rates at PCP visit within 4 months after estimated date 
of delivery (captured at time of enrollment), which will be compared between the groups using 
chi squared tests. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals will be reported. 
Secondary outcomes will include measures of long-term health and health care use after the 
postpartum period. 
Subgroup analyses will be performed by a variety of patient characteristics including gestational 
age at enrollment, prenatal risk factors, morbidity types, patient race-ethnicity, payer, and 
enrollment location.

Version 2022.09.01 Page 11 of 15P-value of less than 0.05 will be considered to indicate statistical significance.
Power Calculation
Most study calculations were estimated from the MGH 2020 delivery population. The rates of 
PCP follow-up were estimated from a randomly selected cohort of 50 patients who met the 
inclusion criteria. We plan to recruit patients into the study for a period of 4 months and expect 
1200 unique patients to be at the targeted gestational age during this period. Among these, we 
expect 86% to already have an assigned PCP in the network, leaving roughly 1,032 patients. 
Among these, we estimate that 49% have at least one of the targeted health conditions, leaving 
a target study population of 506 over the 4-month period. Based on previous studies conducted 
at MGH, we expect an 70% willingness to participate in the research, leaving an expected 
recruited population of 354 individuals. Based on our record extraction, we estimate that 15% of 
the targeted study population has a primary care visit within 4 months of delivery. Assuming an 
alpha of 0.05 and a baseline mean of 15%, with this expected sample size and power of 80%, 
our study has a minimum detectable effect size of roughly 13 percentage points (from 15% to 
28%). A previous study found that default scheduling into postpartum care appointments (with 
an OBGYN, not a PCP) increased postpartum care take-up by 24 percentage points; since our 
intervention incorporates defaults and other activating interventions, an MDE of 13 percentage 
points is reasonable.
9.   Monitoring and Quality Assurance
This is a minimal risk study in which the intervention involves default scheduling of 
appointments and patient messaging. Adverse events are not expected, and there is no 
physiologic plausibility for this intervention to cause any NIH-defined serious adverse events 
(e.g., death, prolonged hospitalization, significant disability).
No interim analyses are planned.
Adverse events will be defined and classified in accordance with NIH guidelines:
Definition of Adverse Events (AE): Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence 
in a human subject, including any abnormal sign, symptom, or disease, temporally 
associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether considered 
related to the subject’s participation in the research or not.
Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE): Any AE that (1) results in death, (2) is life-
threatening, (3) results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization, (4) results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, (5) results in a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect, and/or (6) may jeopardize the subject’s health and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other five outcomes listed 
here.
In the unlikely event an AE or SAE occurs, it will be brought to the PI's attention, and the PI 
will classify the AE/SAE by severity, expectedness, and relatedness, as listed above. All events 
that are both serious and unexpected will be reported to Mass General Brigham's IRB, the NIA 
Page 18 of 29

Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.09.01 Page 12 of 15PO, and to the NIA Roybal DSMB within 48 hours of the research team's knowledge of the 
SAE. The summary of all other SAEs will be reported to the NIA and to the DSMB quarterly 
unless otherwise specified by the DSMB. Any unanticipated problem, defined as an issue 
related to the research suggesting the research places participants or others at greater risk 
than expected, will be reported to the IRB, the NIA PO, and to the Roybal DSMB within 48 
hours of discovery. If the problem involves death then reporting will occur within 24 hours, and 
this report will include a plan to correct the problem and prevent its occurrence. Any breach of 
PHI will be reported to the PI, who will report to the IRB and NIA PO within 24 hours of 
discovery.
The Roybal DSMB oversight is provided by the Standing Roybal DSMB, which includes the 
members listed: Andrea B. Troxel, ScD (chair); Abby King, PhD; Jerry Gurwitz, MD; Hae-Ra 
Han, PhD, RN, FAAN; Hang Lee, PhD; Ezra Golberstein, PhD; David Kim,  MD PhD; 
Christopher Celano, MD.
DSMB members will have no direct involvement with the study or conflict of interest with the 
investigators or institutions conducting the study. Each member has signed a COI statement 
which includes current affiliations, if any, with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies 
(e.g., stockholder, consultant), and any other relationship that could be perceived as a conflict 
of interest related to the study and/or associated with commercial interests pertinent to study 
objectives.
Data presented to the DSMB will be deidentified as to protect individual participants’ privacy and 
health information. Should the identity of a deidentified subject need to be  revealed, the DSMB 
request will be reviewed and ultimately at the discretion of the Mass General Brigham IRB.

Documento informativo del estudio de investigación
Cerrando la brecha entre el posparto y la atención primaria (Bridge Study)
Investigadores 
principales Mark Clapp, MD MPH (Massachusetts General Hospital)
Jessica Cohen, PhD (Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health)
Descripción general Este es un estudio de investigación que se realiza entre mujeres embarazadas y que 
han dado a luz recientemente y que reciben atención en MGH.
Objetivo Su proveedor de atención primaria (PCP) es responsable de manejar y supervisar su 
salud actual y a largo plazo. El objetivo de este proyecto es mejorar la atención 
primaria en el período de posparto. 
Patrocinador Esta investigación está patrocinada por el Instituto Nacional del Envejecimiento 
(National Institute of Aging, NIA), el Centro Roybal del MIT para la Investigación 
Traslacional para Mejorar la Atención Médica de los Adultos Mayores (MIT Roybal 
Center for Translational Research to Improve Health Care for the Aging) y el Centro 
Roybal del NBER para el Cambio de Comportamiento en la Salud (NBER Roybal 
Center for Behavior Change in Health).
Contacto Le hemos enviado un mensaje de Patient Gateway sobre este estudio porque usted 
es una persona que puede beneficiarse especialmente de recibir atención primaria de 
posparto. 
Detalles del estudio Si acepta participar, le haremos algunas preguntas sobre su salud y su historial de 
visitas en el momento de la inscripción, todas ellas opcionales.
Entonces se la asignará aleatoriamente (50/50 de probabilidades) para participar en 
el grupo de “atención estándar” o en el grupo de “transición asistida”. 
Independientemente del grupo al que se la asigne, seguirá recibiendo atención 
prenatal y posparto estándar por parte de su proveedor de atención obstétrica. 
En el grupo de “atención estándar”, recibirá una cantidad limitada de mensajes 
(menos de 5) del equipo del estudio. 
En el grupo de “transición asistida”, recibirá una cantidad limitada de mensajes 
(menos de 5) del equipo del estudio entre el momento de la inscripción y hasta cuatro 
meses después del parto. El equipo del estudio también la ayudará a comunicarse 
con su proveedor de atención primaria después del parto. Específicamente, podemos 
llamar al consultorio de su proveedor de atención primaria de su parte para ayudar a 
programar una cita. Usted siempre tiene la opción de cambiar o cancelar esta cita. 
También le enviaremos un mensaje a su PCP para informarle que ha dado a luz 
recientemente y que se está programando una cita de seguimiento.
Los mensajes que le enviemos a través de Patient Gateway también figurarán en su 
historia clínica para que los demás miembros de su equipo de atención los vean.
Para ambos grupos, revisaremos su historia clínica después de su parto para ver si 
recibió y cuándo recibió algún tipo de atención dentro del sistema de salud de Mass 
General Brigham e información sobre su estado de salud hasta dos años después de 
su parto.
También es posible que nos comuniquemos con usted una vez entre cuatro y doce 
meses después de su parto para hacerle preguntas sobre su experiencia de atención 
posparto. Puede negarse a participar o a responder a alguna o a todas las preguntas.

Bridge Study: Documento informativo
2
Puede optar por no recibir mensajes o negarse a participar en cualquier encuesta, y/o 
retirarse del estudio en cualquier momento sin recibir ninguna sanción.
En este estudio, participarán aproximadamente 350 personas.
Privacidad/
Confidencialidad La Ley de Portabilidad y Responsabilidad de Seguros Médicos (Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act, HIPAA) nos exige que protejamos la privacidad de 
la información de salud obtenida para la investigación. En las páginas 3 y 4 de este 
documento informativo se incluyen más detalles relacionados con la privacidad de su 
información de salud.
Se mantendrá la confidencialidad y la seguridad de toda la información recopilada 
como parte de este estudio. Como en todos los estudios, existe un riesgo muy bajo 
de que otras personas puedan conocer su participación o su información de salud. El 
Comité de Investigación en Seres Humanos de Mass General Brigham ha aprobado 
los procedimientos del estudio y la protección de su información. Una vez finalizado 
el estudio, se eliminará toda la información que pudiera identificarla, como por 
ejemplo su nombre o número de historia clínica. 
Información del estudio Recopilaremos información sobre sus antecedentes de salud y embarazo, incluso 
sobre las visitas que realice a los proveedores del sistema de salud de Mass General 
Brigham. Los datos recopilados como parte de este estudio no afectarán de manera 
directa su atención clínica. Usted y su equipo de atención podrán ver todos los 
mensajes enviados por el equipo del estudio en la historia clínica electrónica. La 
información sobre usted sin identificación se puede usar o compartir con otros 
investigadores sin su consentimiento informado adicional.
Riesgos Los riesgos de participar son mínimos. 
Aunque haremos todo lo posible para proteger la privacidad y confidencialidad de los 
participantes, es posible que otras personas conozcan su participación en el estudio. 
Para comunicarnos con usted, le enviaremos mensajes a través de Patient Gateway, 
que es un método que cumple con la HIPAA. Usted tiene la opción de recibir también 
mensajes de texto SMS que no incluirán ninguna información de salud personal o 
que permita identificarla. Existe una posibilidad poco frecuente de que otras personas 
conozcan su participación en el estudio o la información sobre su salud, a pesar del 
uso de cortafuegos, protección con contraseña y otras medidas de seguridad.
Costos No está obligada a pagar para participar en este estudio de investigación. 
Puede haber un costo para que usted asista a una visita con un PCP, como por 
ejemplo el pago de un copago o un deducible. Sus costos se basan en la cobertura 
de su seguro individual. Si no tiene seguro, es posible que se le facture de manera 
directa la totalidad del costo de esta visita. Le proporcionaremos información sobre 
cómo comprobar los posibles costos con su aseguradora o con el consultorio de su 
PCP antes de su visita. 
Algunas clínicas pueden sancionar a las personas que no se presenten a una cita 
programada (tarifa por “no presentarse”). Se le dará la oportunidad de optar por no 
ser citada y se le recordará varias veces que debe cancelar o reprogramar la cita si

Opción de recibir mensajes de texto (SMS)
Los mensajes de texto por teléfonos móviles/celulares son una forma común de comunicación. A nuestro 
equipo del estudio le gustaría enviarle no más de 3 mensajes de texto (SMS) como parte del estudio, aunque 
esto es opcional y no se requiere para participar en Bridge Study. El envío de mensajes de texto por 
teléfonos móviles/celulares implica riesgos de seguridad debido a que tales mensajes de texto no están 
cifrados.  Esto significa que la información que usted envíe o reciba por mensajes de texto podría ser 
interceptada o vista por un destinatario no deseado, o bien por su proveedor o compañía de servicios de 
telefonía móvil/celular. 
A continuación se presentan algunos puntos importantes sobre el envío de mensajes de texto como parte de 
un estudio de investigación:
•Recibir mensajes de texto en este estudio es opcional y no es obligatorio para participar.
•Los mensajes de texto no están cifrados y, por lo tanto, presentan riesgos de seguridad. Ni este estudio 
de investigación ni Mass General Brigham son responsables de la interceptación de los mensajes 
enviados mediante comunicaciones por mensajes de texto no cifrados.  
•Usted será responsable de todas las tarifas que se le cobren según el plan de servicios de mensajes de 
texto de su compañía de servicios de telefonía.  Ni este estudio de investigación ni Mass General 
Brigham son responsables de los aumentos de los cargos, del uso de los datos en función de los límites 
del plan ni de los cambios en las tarifas de datos de los mensajes de texto de la investigación.
•No se debe enviar mensajes de texto en caso de emergencia.  Si tiene una emergencia médica, llame al 
911 o vaya al departamento de emergencias del hospital más cercano.  
•En cualquier momento, puede decidir no comunicarse con el personal asociado a este estudio de 
investigación mediante el envío o la recepción de mensajes de texto. Puede hacerlo personalmente o 
enviar un mensaje de texto que diga “Stop Research Text” (Detener mensajes de texto de la 
investigación). 
•Su aceptación se aplica a este estudio de investigación solamente.  La aceptación de otros mensajes de 
texto de Mass General Brigham, como por ejemplo los recordatorios de citas, corresponde a un proceso 
independiente.  La opción de no recibir otros mensajes de texto de Mass General Brigham también 
representa un proceso independiente.
•Es su responsabilidad actualizar su número de teléfono móvil/celular en este estudio de investigación si 
se produce algún cambio.

la información de salud protegida sobre usted sin su permiso de maneras que no se detallan en este

para enseñar a otros.  Sin embargo, no se usará su nombre ni otra información que permita identificarla con 
este fin sin su permiso específico.
¿Durante cuánto tiempo se utilizará o compartirá con terceros la información de salud protegida sobre usted?

destruiremos o dejaremos de usar o de compartir la información de salud protegida sobre usted.  El permiso 
que usted nos ha dado para usar y compartir la información de salud protegida sobre usted no vence.

Having a primary care provider (PCP) and seeing 
them at least once a year is important for your 
current and future health and wellbeing.
These providers have different roles than your 
obstetrician (pregnancy doctor) or midwife. It is 
recommended that you see your PCP in the 
months after your delivery since you will stop 
seeing your pregnancy provider.
If you have questions about finding or seeing your 
PCP after your delivery, please ask your

Amending the study protocol to add clarity to one component of the eligibility criteria 
 
  
Provide rationale for the proposed changes: 
Study approach and intervention timings were designed (and are currently operating) based on the 
established date of delivery.  
However, the current detailed protocol eligibility criteria has the condition "Currently pregnant or within 2 
weeks of delivery," which does not exactly match the language in the rest of the protocol. To add clarity 
and to match the language used throughout the rest of the protocol and the schema, this has been 
updated to "Currently pregnant or within 2 weeks of estimated date of delivery." 
This change does not affect any patients that have been previously enrolled as the study has been 
operating based on the clarified language since its start. 
No other forms or study documents contain language that need to be updated as a result of this change, 
including the study fact sheet.

Project Title: Bridging the Gap from Postpartum to Primary Care: A Behavioral 
Science Informed Intervention to Improve Chronic Disease Management 
among Postpartum Women
Version Date: 12/01/2022
Version Name/Number: v1.4
1.  Background and Significance
Burden of Chronic Disease and the Role of Primary Care
Chronic health conditions affect millions of people in the US each year. In 2018, 51.8% of adults 
had at least 1 chronic condition, and 27.2% had multiple conditions.1 The prevalence of chronic 
disease was higher in women compared to men, older adults (87.6% in adults ≥65 years old), 
and people with public insurance.1 Many chronic conditions, by their nature, develop over time 
and have risk factors that can be identified prior to the onset of disease. Strong evidence 
underpins prevention strategies for many conditions, which are advanced by the US 
Preventative Services Taskforce.2 While the long-term health of a patient is the responsibility of 
an entire health system, primary care providers (PCPs) provide an integral role in preventing, 
screening for, and managing disease across the lifespan. Studies have shown the health 
benefits of receiving regular care under a PCP.3–6
Despite the known benefits of having an identifiable usual source of care and the value of health 
care maintenance, the percent of the population with a PCP has been decreasing over time.7 
Consistently, adults who are younger (age 20-40 years) have the lowest rates of primary care 
use. In 2015, 44% and 36% of 20- and 30-year-olds had no identifiable source of primary care.7 
The proportion without primary care were also higher among racial/ethnic minority populations 
and among those who had less education, lower incomes, and no known comorbidities.7 The 
number of adults and the time elapsed without regular primary care follow-up can be considered 
missed opportunities to improve a patient’s current and long-term health. The disproportionate 
lack of primary care among certain subgroups of the population, often groups who already have 
worse health outcomes, only serves to widen the pre-existing disparities.
Pregnancy as a Window to Future Health
In the US, 98.2% of pregnant women receive some form of prenatal care, with the average 
patient having >10 visits during their pregnancy.8 During a pregnancy, women are screened for 
pre-existing and pregnancy-related conditions.9 In adults ages 18-39, the prevalence of obesity, 
hypertension, prediabetes/diabetes, and mental illness are estimated at 39%, 7.5%, 28%, 25%, 
respectively.10–13 Even for those who have no prior identified comorbidities, the most common 
Page 3 of 17

Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.09.01 Page 2 of 15pregnancy-related conditions—pregnancy-related hypertension and gestational diabetes (8% 
and 10% of pregnancies, respectively)—indicate a predisposition to or confer health risks that 
persist as women age. For example, over 25% of women with gestational diabetes will develop 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and women with pre-eclampsia have more than a two-fold risk of 
significant cardiovascular disease later in life.14,15 For these reasons, pregnancy is often 
considered a “window” into a woman’s future health and presents a unique opportunity to 
optimize a woman’s health status early in her life when she otherwise may not have been 
engaged in care.16 
Pregnancy as on Opportunity for Engagement with a Long-term Care Provider
Pregnancy is a period when women are highly engaged and active participants in their health 
care.17 It has been described as a “golden opportunity” to motivate women towards positive 
health behaviors, including prevention and management of chronic disease. However, women 
often fall off a “postpartum cliff” of health system engagement after the early postpartum 
period.18 A range of systemic, financial, and behavioral barriers often prevents patients from 
effectively transitioning to primary care. Postpartum women are often simply told to follow-up 
with their PCP without much information regarding the importance of this follow up care, without 
assistance in scheduling an appointment (or identifying a PCP if they don’t have one), and often 
without a direct transfer of relevant health information or accountability across providers. 
Postpartum women are left largely on their own to navigate this transition to primary care and, in 
particular, to navigate it at a time when they face the high cognitive and physical demands of 
caring for an infant. At this time of limited cognitive bandwidth, the importance of continuity of 
care for chronic conditions and active engagement in one’s longer-term health and wellbeing is 
unlikely to be salient and top-of-mind. These critical moments of unsupported health care 
transition can exacerbate pre-existing disparities in health and health care, with patients who 
are the least able to navigate the US health care system most likely to fall through the cracks.  
Momentum is building in US health and social safety net policy to facilitate healthy transitions 
from pregnancy to parenthood. For example, federal and state initiatives to expand pregnancy-
related Medicaid coverage from 60 days to one year postpartum have been proposed, and 
access to paid family leave is increasing. However, very little evidence exists on effective and 
cost-effective approaches to facilitating transitions to primary care and management of chronic 
diseases in the postpartum year.  
2. Specific Aims and Objectives 
The objective of the proposed study is to increase patient engagement in primary care after the 
immediate postpartum period for women with pregnancy-associated conditions that convey a 
long-term health risk. Specifically, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention bundle 
(automatic scheduling of PCP appointment after delivery, salient labeling, and appointment 
reminder nudges) to increase patient attendance at a primary care provider appointment (within 
4 months of delivery for women with or at risk for obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and/or a 
mental health condition. 
Specific Aims:
1) Test the efficacy of an intervention bundle (patient-tailored health information, automatic 
scheduling of PCP appointment after delivery, and appointment reminder nudges) to 
increase patient attendance at a primary care provider appointment within 4 months of

Version 2022.09.01 Page 3 of 15delivery for women with obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and/or a mental health 
condition
2) Test the efficacy of the intervention bundle to improve compliance with the condition-
specific, guideline-based health screenings
3) Test the efficacy of the intervention bundle to reduce unscheduled or urgent encounters 
(e.g., emergency department visits) within the health system
3. General Description of Study Design
We will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing this intervention bundle to the receipt of 
generic information on the importance of primary care follow-up after delivery.  
Women will be randomized with equal probability into either a treatment or control arm. The 
intervention combines several features designed to target reasons for low take-up of primary 
care among postpartum women (see Logic Model). We leverage the potential value of 
defaults/opt-out, salient labels, and reminders to encourage use of primary care within 4 months 
of delivery. Women in both the intervention and control arms will receive information via MGH’s 
patient portal toward the end of the pregnancy regarding the importance of transitions to primary 
care in the postpartum year. This information will be similar to, but reinforcing, the information 
they would receive from their obstetrician about following up with their primary care physician. In 
addition to this initial message, women in the treatment arm will receive the following 
intervention components, developed based on recent evidence regarding behavioral science 
approaches to activating health behaviors:19–21
➢Targeted messages about the importance and benefits of primary care. 
➢Default scheduling into a primary care appointment at approximately 3-4 months after 
delivery. The patient will be scheduled for a primary care visit with their assigned primary 
care provider in the Mass General Brigham system. They will be informed of the option to 
cancel the appointment, change the appointment day/time, or change the care provider 
either through the patient portal). 
➢Reminders about the appointment and importance of follow up primary care at 2-4 points 
during the postpartum period via the patient portal. 
➢Tailored language in the reminders based on recent evidence from behavioral science about 
the most effective approaches to increasing take-up. For example, messages will inform the 
patient that an appointment has been reserved for them at their doctor.

4. Subject Selection
Pregnant patients receiving prenatal care at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) will be 
targeted for recruitment. MGH conducts approximately 3500 deliveries per year, with roughly 
one-third of patients identifying as non-white and 35% of pregnancies covered by Medicaid.
Approximately 49% of the clinic population may ultimately be eligible to be approached.
The eligibility criteria include:
•Estimated date of delivery and the following 4-month postpartum outcome 
assessment window completed prior to study end date
•Currently pregnant or within 2 weeks of estimated date of delivery
•Have one or more of the following conditions: 
oChronic hypertension
oHypertensive disorders of pregnancy or risk factors for hypertensive disorders 
of pregnancy per the USPTF aspirin prescribing guidelines (e.g., history of 
pre-eclampsia, kidney disease, multiple gestation, autoimmune disease)22
oType 1 or 2 diabetes

oObesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2)
oDepression or anxiety disorder 
•Have a primary care provider listed in the patient’s medical record 
•Receive obstetric care at an MGH-affiliated outpatient prenatal clinic
•Has access to and be enrolled in the electronic health record patient portal and 
consents to be contacted via these modalities
•Able to read/speak English or Spanish language
•Age ≥18 years old
•Not diagnosed with or undergoing evaluation for stillbirth/fetal demise
All women, regardless of race/ethnicity, who meet the eligibility criteria will be included. In 2019, 
3,789 women gave birth at the study institution, of whom 57% were white, 7% were black, 12% 
were Asian, 18% were Hispanic, and 6% declined to report their race/ethnicity. A similar 
distribution is expected for this study.
The study will distribute materials in English and Spanish languages. This encompasses >95% 
of patients who deliver at the study institution.
5. Subject Enrollment
This study will rely on recruiting for research through Patient Gateway and follow the IRB 
guidance and DHeC Research Checklist and training for this process.
In the month prior to the start of enrollment, all potentially eligible individuals (based on the 
criteria above) will be identified using RPDR and Epic Reporting search queries. This list (the 
“potentially eligible” list) will be provided to the DHeCare Research Team to build an RSH 
Record in Epic. This list will be updated monthly to identify newly eligible individuals (e.g., new 
diagnosis of gestational diabetes or new patient transferring into the practice) during the 
recruitment months and fed back to the DHeCare team to update “potentially eligible” list.
Once built and each month during recruitment phase, the study’s research coordinator (not 
study investigators) will send the IRB-approved Research Invitation Letter to patients who are 
eligible, not already enrolled, and have not declined to be sent research notifications through the 
portal. The Research Letter will employ an opt-out approach, asking individuals who do not wish 
to be approached in clinic or remotely to respond via PG messaging, email, or phone within 2 
weeks of receipt of the letter. Those who have “read” the letter and not opted out after 2 weeks 
will be moved from the “potentially eligible” list to the “waiting to be approached” list in the study 
workflow.
During recruitment months, the study coordinator will keep a log of patient’s upcoming 
appointments for those on the “waiting to be approached” list. They will then attempt to 
approach individuals for enrollment when they present for an in-person encounters (preferred). 
Patients will ideally be approached between 32-36 weeks of gestation, when feasible; however, 
priority will be given to patients at the latest gestation. For those Spanish-speaking patients, a 
hospital-based interpreter will be used when approaching/consenting patients.

Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.09.01 Page 7 of 15The study staff will introduce the study and review the purpose of the study, the nature of the 
subject’s participation, the possible risks and discomforts associated with participation, the 
potential benefits of participation, a statement of the voluntary nature of participation, and a 
description of the mechanisms used to ensure confidentiality. 
All patients will receive study-related messages through Patient Gateway. In addition, patients 
will be asked if they would be willing to receive no more than 5 SMS messages to their personal 
cell phone during the first 4 months of the postpartum period. The study staff will review the 
specific concerns and risks about receiving unencrypted text messaging communications, as 
outlined by the MGB IRB. 
A waiver of documentation of informed consent is requested, as the study presents no more 
than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is 
normally required outside of the research context. Verbal consent will be obtained for 1) overall 
study participation and 2) optional SMS message participation, separately. Verbal consent will 
be obtained from both in-person and phone recruitment efforts.
A Study Fact Sheet, which summarizes the study details, risks, and benefits, will be provided to 
all subjects who are approached, either in-person, by mail, or electronically. This Study Fact 
Sheet also includes information supplied by the MGB IRB specifically related to the concerns 
and risks of receiving unencrypted SMS/text messages.
For tracking verbal consent, the study staff will keep a detailed log in REDCap documenting:
1) name of study staff performing consent,
2) date of attempted approach,
3) the method of attempted approach (in-person or via phone),
4) use of Spanish interpreter (yes/no),
5) subject agreement to be approached (agree/disagree),
6) attestation to full review of the study procedures/risks/benefits with the subject, as would 
be done during the process of reviewing a written consent form, 
7) attestation to review of supplemental consent to receive unencrypted SMS messages 
with the subject,
8) subject overall study participation status (enrolled, declined, deferred – agrees to be 
recontacted, deferred – wishes not to be recontacted),
9) if enrolled, unencrypted SMS text messaging participation (consents, declines),
10) attestation to Study Fact Sheet provided,
11) method by which Study Fact Sheet was provided (in-person, mail, electronic),
12) date in which Study Fact Sheet was provided (in-person, mail, electronic).
6. STUDY PROCEDURES
The RA will keep a detailed log of all patients in the practice, if they are eligible, if they have 
been approached, and if they consented.
For those that agree to be enrolled, patients will be asked to complete a baseline survey to 
obtain voluntarily reported information on their demographics, socioeconomic status, health care 
visit history, and primary care provider. Patients will also be asked to consent to being contacted

Version 2022.09.01 Page 8 of 15by the research team via Patient Gateway messaging. A $20 gift card will be given at the time of 
enrollment for those that complete the questionnaire and receive the information sheet.
Randomization will occur via a prespecified random allocation sequence within strata. Within 
each stratum, the PIs will generate a random sequence of treatment-control allocation prior the 
enrollment of subjects. Then, as patients within strata are enrolled, they will be assigned to the 
treatment arm associated with that enrollment number. 
Control Group
Approximately 2 weeks before a patient’s estimated due date (EDD) or as soon as enrolled if 
this date has passed, the patient will be sent information via the Patient Gateway on the 
importance of postpartum care and follow-up with their PCP.
Intervention Group
1. Tailored Information:
Approximately 2-4 weeks prior to the EDD (or later for those who are enrolled beyond 38 
weeks gestation or postnatally), the patient will be sent an information via the Patient 
Gateway on the importance of postpartum care and follow-up with their PCP, which also 
includes the name and phone number of their primary care provider. 
2. Scheduled PCP Appointment:
Between 2-3 weeks after their delivery, the RA will call the patient’s PCP office and 
make an appointment for them between 3-4 months after delivery based on the 
scheduling preferences obtained in the initial survey.
3. Targeted Appointment Message with Salient Labeling:
After the PCP appointment has been made, the patient will be sent a Patient Gateway 
message saying that a PCP appointment has been reserved for them with the 
date/time/location information.
For those consenting to receive SMS messages, an unencrypted text message will also 
be sent simultaneously.
4. Nudge Reminders: 
Patient Gateway messages will be sent at approximately 4-8 weeks (goal: 4 weeks) and 
1-4 week (goal: 1 week) prior to their PCP appointment, reminding a patient of their 
upcoming appointment. 
For those consenting to receive SMS messages, an unencrypted text message will also 
be sent simultaneously.
5. Facilitated PCP Communication:
A study staff member will send the patient’s PCP an Epic Inbasket message that the 
patient 1) is recently postpartum, 2) has or developed health conditions that need long-
term management, and 3) has been scheduled (or attempted to be scheduled) for a 
follow-up visit.
All messages will be made available in English and Spanish.
The text for these Patient Gateway messages is included in the submission. At the end of each 
patient message, patients will be given the opportunity to stop receiving study-related messages 
by emailing or calling the study staff. “Opt out” requests will be logged and patients removed 
from future planned study-related contact.

Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.09.01 Page 9 of 15The text for 3 SMS messages is included in the submission. SMS messages will be sent via 
Google Voice. We will follow standard recommendations from the MGB Research Information 
Security for using this system (included under Privacy and Confidentiality section).
The study team will review the patient’s EHR record for the primary and secondary outcome 
assessments. Patients will be asked to consent to have records reviewed up to 2 years after the 
date of their delivery to allow for long-term effects of the intervention on primary care use and 
health status. 
During the initial consent process, patients will be asked to agree to be potentially contacted at 
the end of the first 4-month follow-up period for a survey. Currently, this endline survey is not 
planned due to funding limitations; however, if funding becomes available, an IRB amendment 
will be submitted for review of the endline survey prior to being administered to any study 
subjects.
Deidentified data from this project may be shared outside of MGB with the study funders (J-
PAL/NBER/NIA) for data sharing and reproducibility requirements and secondary statistical 
analysis. All data will be stripped of patient identifiers, per IRB guidance. No data will be shared 
without a formal Data Use Agreement with MGB.
6. Risks and Discomforts
There are minimal risks to participants. 
Patients will be reassured that nonparticipation will not affect clinical care. Patients will also be 
informed that the researchers with whom they will interact (e.g., during consent, face-to-face, 
during telephone interviews) are not health care providers. Participants will be consistently 
reminded that responses to any queries deemed sensitive or uncomfortable (e.g., country of 
origin/immigration status, income, previous history of abortion) should be considered optional, 
and they may decline to answer any question(s) and can refuse to continue the study at any 
point. Participants will be reassured that neither their opportunities for continued health care nor 
their relationships with health care providers will be jeopardized by study participation.
Health information collected as part of this study will be stored in REDCap. No identifiable data 
will be stored or downloaded on any personal or unauthorized computers. Study staff will 
access the data on institutionally purchased and managed computers that operate behind the 
health system’s security and firewall protections. Only the MGH study staff will have access to 
the identifiable data set. Once the study is completed, data will be deidentified such that it can 
be analyzed without risk of a breach of privacy or confidentiality. Any data that is shared outside 
of MGH will require a data use authorization.
Although we will make every effort to protect participant privacy and confidentiality, it is possible 
that participants' involvement in the study could become known to others. For those in the 
intervention group, we will be sending personalized messages via the patient portal; for those 
providing additional consent, we will be sending unencrypted SMS messages that will not 
contain any personal protected health information. There is the rare possibility that study 
participation or health information could become known to others despite the use of firewalls,

Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.09.01 Page 10 of 15password protection, and other security measures. Standard procedures, as outlined by the 
MGB Research Information Security Office, will be followed to reduce this risk.
Individuals in the intervention group will be scheduled for an appointment with a primary care 
doctor. There is the possibility that this visit may result in a charge/cost for the patient. Under 
the Affordable Care Act, commercial health plans are required to cover an annual Preventive 
Health Exam at no cost to the patient (no co-payment, co-insurance or deductible). MassHealth 
also covers these visits without cost-sharing. However, if this visit turns or scheduled as into a 
“sick” or “disease management” visit, the patient may be billed for some or all aspects of the 
services provided, depending on their insurer. We will provide directions for patients on how to 
to contact their insurers or PCP’s office prior to the visit to inquire about potential cost-sharing 
and/or deductibles. Patients will also be advised that some clinics may penalize individuals for 
not showing to a scheduled appointment (“no show” fee) and be given opportunities to request 
the appointment be canceled or rescheduled with each appointment reminder.
7. Benefits
Participants in the control group will receive information on the importance of postpartum care 
and transitioning to primary care after their delivery.
Participants in the intervention group will receive a bundle of interventions designed to increase 
attendance at primary care visits and facilitate the transition of care after their delivery.
The goal and potential benefits to the subjects in this trial is to increase patient engagement and 
connection with their primary care provider, receive recommended health screenings and 
directed counseling, and reduce unscheduled or urgent visits in the postpartum period.
8. Statistical Analysis
Statistical Methods
Analyses will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle.
Standard independent, two-sided, two-group comparison testing will be used to compare 
baseline characteristics between the two groups (chi squared tests, t tests, Wilcoxon rank sum 
tests, when appropriate).
The primary outcome will be attendance rates at PCP visit within 4 months after estimated date 
of delivery (captured at time of enrollment), which will be compared between the groups using 
chi squared tests. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals will be reported. 
Secondary outcomes will include measures of long-term health and health care use after the 
postpartum period. 
Subgroup analyses will be performed by a variety of patient characteristics including gestational 
age at enrollment, prenatal risk factors, morbidity types, patient race-ethnicity, payer, and 
enrollment location.

Power Calculation
Most study calculations were estimated from the MGH 2020 delivery population. The rates of 
PCP follow-up were estimated from a randomly selected cohort of 50 patients who met the 
inclusion criteria. We plan to recruit patients into the study for a period of 4 months and expect 
1200 unique patients to be at the targeted gestational age during this period. Among these, we 
expect 86% to already have an assigned PCP in the network, leaving roughly 1,032 patients. 
Among these, we estimate that 49% have at least one of the targeted health conditions, leaving 
a target study population of 506 over the 4-month period. Based on previous studies conducted 
at MGH, we expect an 70% willingness to participate in the research, leaving an expected 
recruited population of 354 individuals. Based on our record extraction, we estimate that 15% of 
the targeted study population has a primary care visit within 4 months of delivery. Assuming an 
alpha of 0.05 and a baseline mean of 15%, with this expected sample size and power of 80%, 
our study has a minimum detectable effect size of roughly 13 percentage points (from 15% to 
28%). A previous study found that default scheduling into postpartum care appointments (with 
an OBGYN, not a PCP) increased postpartum care take-up by 24 percentage points; since our 
intervention incorporates defaults and other activating interventions, an MDE of 13 percentage 
points is reasonable.
9.   Monitoring and Quality Assurance
This is a minimal risk study in which the intervention involves default scheduling of 
appointments and patient messaging. Adverse events are not expected, and there is no 
physiologic plausibility for this intervention to cause any NIH-defined serious adverse events 
(e.g., death, prolonged hospitalization, significant disability).
No interim analyses are planned.
Adverse events will be defined and classified in accordance with NIH guidelines:
Definition of Adverse Events (AE): Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence 
in a human subject, including any abnormal sign, symptom, or disease, temporally 
associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether considered 
related to the subject’s participation in the research or not.
Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE): Any AE that (1) results in death, (2) is life-
threatening, (3) results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization, (4) results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, (5) results in a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect, and/or (6) may jeopardize the subject’s health and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other five outcomes listed 
here.
In the unlikely event an AE or SAE occurs, it will be brought to the PI's attention, and the PI 
will classify the AE/SAE by severity, expectedness, and relatedness, as listed above. All events 
that are both serious and unexpected will be reported to Mass General Brigham's IRB, the NIA

Version 2022.09.01 Page 12 of 15PO, and to the NIA Roybal DSMB within 48 hours of the research team's knowledge of the 
SAE. The summary of all other SAEs will be reported to the NIA and to the DSMB quarterly 
unless otherwise specified by the DSMB. Any unanticipated problem, defined as an issue 
related to the research suggesting the research places participants or others at greater risk 
than expected, will be reported to the IRB, the NIA PO, and to the Roybal DSMB within 48 
hours of discovery. If the problem involves death then reporting will occur within 24 hours, and 
this report will include a plan to correct the problem and prevent its occurrence. Any breach of 
PHI will be reported to the PI, who will report to the IRB and NIA PO within 24 hours of 
discovery.
The Roybal DSMB oversight is provided by the Standing Roybal DSMB, which includes the 
members listed: Andrea B. Troxel, ScD (chair); Abby King, PhD; Jerry Gurwitz, MD; Hae-Ra 
Han, PhD, RN, FAAN; Hang Lee, PhD; Ezra Golberstein, PhD; David Kim,  MD PhD; 
Christopher Celano, MD.
DSMB members will have no direct involvement with the study or conflict of interest with the 
investigators or institutions conducting the study. Each member has signed a COI statement 
which includes current affiliations, if any, with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies 
(e.g., stockholder, consultant), and any other relationship that could be perceived as a conflict 
of interest related to the study and/or associated with commercial interests pertinent to study 
objectives.
Data presented to the DSMB will be deidentified as to protect individual participants’ privacy and 
health information. Should the identity of a deidentified subject need to be  revealed, the DSMB 
request will be reviewed and ultimately at the discretion of the Mass General Brigham IRB.

Briefly describe the proposed changes: 
The protocol is being amended to include a endline survey among participants enrolled in the study. 
Consent to contact patients for the survey was approved as part of the initial IRB approval. This 
amendment adds the survey tool, the administration procedure, and the text of the mail and SMS 
messages that will be used. The study schema was updated to add "and patient survey" in the bottom 
outcomes assessment box. 
There are no changes to the Study Fact Sheet or consent process as this endline survey was already 
included. 
 
  
Provide rationale for the proposed changes: 
An endline survey was planned during the conception of this project, but the final tool was developed 
after the initial study protocol was approved. No individuals that have been enrolled have yet to reach 
the "4 months after due date" follow-up window yet -- the starting time point for the outcomes 
assessment.  
 
  
Will the proposed change(s) significantly alter the risk to benefit assessment the IRB relied upon to approve 
the protocol?

Science Informed Intervention to Improve Chronic Disease Management 
among Postpartum Women
Version Date: 01/26/2023
Version Name/Number: v1.5
1.  Background and Significance
Burden of Chronic Disease and the Role of Primary Care
Chronic health conditions affect millions of people in the US each year. In 2018, 51.8% of adults 
had at least 1 chronic condition, and 27.2% had multiple conditions.1 The prevalence of chronic 
disease was higher in women compared to men, older adults (87.6% in adults ≥65 years old), 
and people with public insurance.1 Many chronic conditions, by their nature, develop over time 
and have risk factors that can be identified prior to the onset of disease. Strong evidence 
underpins prevention strategies for many conditions, which are advanced by the US 
Preventative Services Taskforce.2 While the long-term health of a patient is the responsibility of 
an entire health system, primary care providers (PCPs) provide an integral role in preventing, 
screening for, and managing disease across the lifespan. Studies have shown the health 
benefits of receiving regular care under a PCP.3–6
Despite the known benefits of having an identifiable usual source of care and the value of health 
care maintenance, the percent of the population with a PCP has been decreasing over time.7 
Consistently, adults who are younger (age 20-40 years) have the lowest rates of primary care 
use. In 2015, 44% and 36% of 20- and 30-year-olds had no identifiable source of primary care.7 
The proportion without primary care were also higher among racial/ethnic minority populations 
and among those who had less education, lower incomes, and no known comorbidities.7 The 
number of adults and the time elapsed without regular primary care follow-up can be considered 
missed opportunities to improve a patient’s current and long-term health. The disproportionate 
lack of primary care among certain subgroups of the population, often groups who already have 
worse health outcomes, only serves to widen the pre-existing disparities.
Pregnancy as a Window to Future Health
In the US, 98.2% of pregnant women receive some form of prenatal care, with the average 
patient having >10 visits during their pregnancy.8 During a pregnancy, women are screened for 
pre-existing and pregnancy-related conditions.9 In adults ages 18-39, the prevalence of obesity, 
hypertension, prediabetes/diabetes, and mental illness are estimated at 39%, 7.5%, 28%, 25%, 
respectively.10–13 Even for those who have no prior identified comorbidities, the most common

Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.09.01 Page 2 of 16pregnancy-related conditions—pregnancy-related hypertension and gestational diabetes (8% 
and 10% of pregnancies, respectively)—indicate a predisposition to or confer health risks that 
persist as women age. For example, over 25% of women with gestational diabetes will develop 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and women with pre-eclampsia have more than a two-fold risk of 
significant cardiovascular disease later in life.14,15 For these reasons, pregnancy is often 
considered a “window” into a woman’s future health and presents a unique opportunity to 
optimize a woman’s health status early in her life when she otherwise may not have been 
engaged in care.16 
Pregnancy as on Opportunity for Engagement with a Long-term Care Provider
Pregnancy is a period when women are highly engaged and active participants in their health 
care.17 It has been described as a “golden opportunity” to motivate women towards positive 
health behaviors, including prevention and management of chronic disease. However, women 
often fall off a “postpartum cliff” of health system engagement after the early postpartum 
period.18 A range of systemic, financial, and behavioral barriers often prevents patients from 
effectively transitioning to primary care. Postpartum women are often simply told to follow-up 
with their PCP without much information regarding the importance of this follow up care, without 
assistance in scheduling an appointment (or identifying a PCP if they don’t have one), and often 
without a direct transfer of relevant health information or accountability across providers. 
Postpartum women are left largely on their own to navigate this transition to primary care and, in 
particular, to navigate it at a time when they face the high cognitive and physical demands of 
caring for an infant. At this time of limited cognitive bandwidth, the importance of continuity of 
care for chronic conditions and active engagement in one’s longer-term health and wellbeing is 
unlikely to be salient and top-of-mind. These critical moments of unsupported health care 
transition can exacerbate pre-existing disparities in health and health care, with patients who 
are the least able to navigate the US health care system most likely to fall through the cracks.  
Momentum is building in US health and social safety net policy to facilitate healthy transitions 
from pregnancy to parenthood. For example, federal and state initiatives to expand pregnancy-
related Medicaid coverage from 60 days to one year postpartum have been proposed, and 
access to paid family leave is increasing. However, very little evidence exists on effective and 
cost-effective approaches to facilitating transitions to primary care and management of chronic 
diseases in the postpartum year.  
2. Specific Aims and Objectives 
The objective of the proposed study is to increase patient engagement in primary care after the 
immediate postpartum period for women with pregnancy-associated conditions that convey a 
long-term health risk. Specifically, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention bundle 
(automatic scheduling of PCP appointment after delivery, salient labeling, and appointment 
reminder nudges) to increase patient attendance at a primary care provider appointment (within 
4 months of delivery for women with or at risk for obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and/or a 
mental health condition. 
Specific Aims:
1) Test the efficacy of an intervention bundle (patient-tailored health information, automatic 
scheduling of PCP appointment after delivery, and appointment reminder nudges) to 
increase patient attendance at a primary care provider appointment within 4 months of

(e.g., emergency department visits) within the health system
3. General Description of Study Design
We will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing this intervention bundle to the receipt of 
generic information on the importance of primary care follow-up after delivery.  
Women will be randomized with equal probability into either a treatment or control arm. The 
intervention combines several features designed to target reasons for low take-up of primary 
care among postpartum women (see Logic Model). We leverage the potential value of 
defaults/opt-out, salient labels, and reminders to encourage use of primary care within 4 months 
of delivery. Women in both the intervention and control arms will receive information via MGH’s 
patient portal toward the end of the pregnancy regarding the importance of transitions to primary 
care in the postpartum year. This information will be similar to, but reinforcing, the information 
they would receive from their obstetrician about following up with their primary care physician. In 
addition to this initial message, women in the treatment arm will receive the following 
intervention components, developed based on recent evidence regarding behavioral science 
approaches to activating health behaviors:19–21
➢Targeted messages about the importance and benefits of primary care. 
➢Default scheduling into a primary care appointment at approximately 3-4 months after 
delivery. The patient will be scheduled for a primary care visit with their assigned primary 
care provider in the Mass General Brigham system. They will be informed of the option to 
cancel the appointment, change the appointment day/time, or change the care provider 
either through the patient portal). 
➢Reminders about the appointment and importance of follow up primary care at 2-4 points 
during the postpartum period via the patient portal. 
➢Tailored language in the reminders based on recent evidence from behavioral science about 
the most effective approaches to increasing take-up. For example, messages will inform the 
patient that an appointment has been reserved for them at their doctor.

4. Subject Selection
Pregnant patients receiving prenatal care at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) will be 
targeted for recruitment. MGH conducts approximately 3500 deliveries per year, with roughly 
one-third of patients identifying as non-white and 35% of pregnancies covered by Medicaid.
Approximately 49% of the clinic population may ultimately be eligible to be approached.
The eligibility criteria include:
•Estimated date of delivery and the following 4-month postpartum outcome 
assessment window completed prior to study end date
•Currently pregnant or within 2 weeks of estimated date of delivery
•Have one or more of the following conditions: 
oChronic hypertension
oHypertensive disorders of pregnancy or risk factors for hypertensive disorders 
of pregnancy per the USPTF aspirin prescribing guidelines (e.g., history of 
pre-eclampsia, kidney disease, multiple gestation, autoimmune disease)22
oType 1 or 2 diabetes

Version 2022.09.01 Page 6 of 16oGestational diabetes
oObesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2)
oDepression or anxiety disorder 
•Have a primary care provider listed in the patient’s medical record 
•Receive obstetric care at an MGH-affiliated outpatient prenatal clinic
•Has access to and be enrolled in the electronic health record patient portal and 
consents to be contacted via these modalities
•Able to read/speak English or Spanish language
•Age ≥18 years old
•Not diagnosed with or undergoing evaluation for stillbirth/fetal demise
All women, regardless of race/ethnicity, who meet the eligibility criteria will be included. In 2019, 
3,789 women gave birth at the study institution, of whom 57% were white, 7% were black, 12% 
were Asian, 18% were Hispanic, and 6% declined to report their race/ethnicity. A similar 
distribution is expected for this study.
The study will distribute materials in English and Spanish languages. This encompasses >95% 
of patients who deliver at the study institution.
5. Subject Enrollment
This study will rely on recruiting for research through Patient Gateway and follow the IRB 
guidance and DHeC Research Checklist and training for this process.
In the month prior to the start of enrollment, all potentially eligible individuals (based on the 
criteria above) will be identified using RPDR and Epic Reporting search queries. This list (the 
“potentially eligible” list) will be provided to the DHeCare Research Team to build an RSH 
Record in Epic. This list will be updated monthly to identify newly eligible individuals (e.g., new 
diagnosis of gestational diabetes or new patient transferring into the practice) during the 
recruitment months and fed back to the DHeCare team to update “potentially eligible” list.
Once built and each month during recruitment phase, the study’s research coordinator (not 
study investigators) will send the IRB-approved Research Invitation Letter to patients who are 
eligible, not already enrolled, and have not declined to be sent research notifications through the 
portal. The Research Letter will employ an opt-out approach, asking individuals who do not wish 
to be approached in clinic or remotely to respond via PG messaging, email, or phone within 2 
weeks of receipt of the letter. Those who have “read” the letter and not opted out after 2 weeks 
will be moved from the “potentially eligible” list to the “waiting to be approached” list in the study 
workflow.
During recruitment months, the study coordinator will keep a log of patient’s upcoming 
appointments for those on the “waiting to be approached” list. They will then attempt to 
approach individuals for enrollment when they present for an in-person encounters (preferred). 
Patients will ideally be approached between 32-36 weeks of gestation, when feasible; however, 
priority will be given to patients at the latest gestation. For those Spanish-speaking patients, a 
hospital-based interpreter will be used when approaching/consenting patients.

Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.09.01 Page 7 of 16The study staff will introduce the study and review the purpose of the study, the nature of the 
subject’s participation, the possible risks and discomforts associated with participation, the 
potential benefits of participation, a statement of the voluntary nature of participation, and a 
description of the mechanisms used to ensure confidentiality. 
All patients will receive study-related messages through Patient Gateway. In addition, patients 
will be asked if they would be willing to receive no more than 5 SMS messages to their personal 
cell phone during the first 4 months of the postpartum period. The study staff will review the 
specific concerns and risks about receiving unencrypted text messaging communications, as 
outlined by the MGB IRB. 
A waiver of documentation of informed consent is requested, as the study presents no more 
than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is 
normally required outside of the research context. Verbal consent will be obtained for 1) overall 
study participation and 2) optional SMS message participation, separately. Verbal consent will 
be obtained from both in-person and phone recruitment efforts.
A Study Fact Sheet, which summarizes the study details, risks, and benefits, will be provided to 
all subjects who are approached, either in-person, by mail, or electronically. This Study Fact 
Sheet also includes information supplied by the MGB IRB specifically related to the concerns 
and risks of receiving unencrypted SMS/text messages.
For tracking verbal consent, the study staff will keep a detailed log in REDCap documenting:
1) name of study staff performing consent,
2) date of attempted approach,
3) the method of attempted approach (in-person or via phone),
4) use of Spanish interpreter (yes/no),
5) subject agreement to be approached (agree/disagree),
6) attestation to full review of the study procedures/risks/benefits with the subject, as would 
be done during the process of reviewing a written consent form, 
7) attestation to review of supplemental consent to receive unencrypted SMS messages 
with the subject,
8) subject overall study participation status (enrolled, declined, deferred – agrees to be 
recontacted, deferred – wishes not to be recontacted),
9) if enrolled, unencrypted SMS text messaging participation (consents, declines),
10) attestation to Study Fact Sheet provided,
11) method by which Study Fact Sheet was provided (in-person, mail, electronic),
12) date in which Study Fact Sheet was provided (in-person, mail, electronic).
6. STUDY PROCEDURES
The RA will keep a detailed log of all patients in the practice, if they are eligible, if they have 
been approached, and if they consented.
For those that agree to be enrolled, patients will be asked to complete a baseline survey to 
obtain voluntarily reported information on their demographics, socioeconomic status, health care 
visit history, and primary care provider. Patients will also be asked to consent to being contacted

Version 2022.09.01 Page 8 of 16by the research team via Patient Gateway messaging. A $20 gift card will be given at the time of 
enrollment for those that complete the questionnaire and receive the information sheet.
Randomization will occur via a prespecified random allocation sequence within strata. Within 
each stratum, the PIs will generate a random sequence of treatment-control allocation prior the 
enrollment of subjects. Then, as patients within strata are enrolled, they will be assigned to the 
treatment arm associated with that enrollment number. 
Control Group
Approximately 2 weeks before a patient’s estimated due date (EDD) or as soon as enrolled if 
this date has passed, the patient will be sent information via the Patient Gateway on the 
importance of postpartum care and follow-up with their PCP.
Intervention Group
1. Tailored Information:
Approximately 2-4 weeks prior to the EDD (or later for those who are enrolled beyond 38 
weeks gestation or postnatally), the patient will be sent an information via the Patient 
Gateway on the importance of postpartum care and follow-up with their PCP, which also 
includes the name and phone number of their primary care provider. 
2. Scheduled PCP Appointment:
Between 2-3 weeks after their delivery, the RA will call the patient’s PCP office and 
make an appointment for them between 3-4 months after delivery based on the 
scheduling preferences obtained in the initial survey.
3. Targeted Appointment Message with Salient Labeling:
After the PCP appointment has been made, the patient will be sent a Patient Gateway 
message saying that a PCP appointment has been reserved for them with the 
date/time/location information.
For those consenting to receive SMS messages, an unencrypted text message will also 
be sent simultaneously.
4. Nudge Reminders: 
Patient Gateway messages will be sent at approximately 4-8 weeks (goal: 4 weeks) and 
1-4 week (goal: 1 week) prior to their PCP appointment, reminding a patient of their 
upcoming appointment. 
For those consenting to receive SMS messages, an unencrypted text message will also 
be sent simultaneously.
5. Facilitated PCP Communication:
A study staff member will send the patient’s PCP an Epic Inbasket message that the 
patient 1) is recently postpartum, 2) has or developed health conditions that need long-
term management, and 3) has been scheduled (or attempted to be scheduled) for a 
follow-up visit.
All messages will be made available in English and Spanish.
The text for these Patient Gateway messages is included in the submission. At the end of each 
patient message, patients will be given the opportunity to stop receiving study-related messages 
by emailing or calling the study staff. “Opt out” requests will be logged and patients removed 
from future planned study-related contact.

Version 2022.09.01 Page 9 of 16The text for 3 SMS messages is included in the submission. SMS messages will be sent via 
Google Voice. We will follow standard recommendations from the MGB Research Information 
Security for using this system (included under Privacy and Confidentiality section).
Outcome Assessment
1. EHR Review
The study team will review the patient’s EHR record for the primary and secondary outcome 
assessments. Patients will be asked to consent to have records reviewed up to 2 years after the 
date of their delivery to allow for long-term effects of the intervention on primary care use and 
health status. 
2. Endline Survey
After 4 months from their established due date (EDD), a patient will be eligible to participate the 
endline survey. The goal timing for the survey completion is 4-6 months after the EDD, but 
patients will remain eligible for up to one year. 
The survey will be administered through REDCap. Study participants will be emailed a unique 
link to complete the survey. Consent to be contacted for this survey will be obtained at the time 
of the subject’s enrollment in the trial. The patient’s email address for contact is verified at the 
time of study enrollment. 
Subjects will be asked to complete a 15-20-minute survey on their care after their delivery. They 
will be reminded that all questions are optional and that responses will be linked to their study 
record; however, no responses will be entered into the electronic health record or become part 
of their permanent medical record. Participants who complete the survey will be offered a $25 
gift card for their participation, which they will be informed of prior to starting the survey. There is 
no penalty for not completing the survey.
If there is no response within approximately 1-2 weeks, the subject will be emailed the link again 
with a reminder to complete the survey. If there is no response within approximately 2-4 weeks 
from the initial email OR the patient does not have a working email address, the subject will be 
called and asked if they would like to complete the survey over the phone. For those that agree, 
the survey text and questions will be read verbatim by a research assistant not affiliated with the 
patient’s clinical care. Individuals who decline to participate in the survey over the phone or 
cannot be reached will be marked as non-respondents.
Patients that consented to receive SMS messages as a part of the study will be sent a text 
message reminder to complete the survey at the same time that emails are sent. No more than 
2 SMS message reminders will be sent to each subject.
Deidentified data from this project may be shared outside of MGB with the study funders (J-
PAL/NBER/NIA) for data sharing and reproducibility requirements and secondary statistical 
analysis. All data will be stripped of patient identifiers, per IRB guidance. No data will be shared 
without a formal Data Use Agreement with MGB.

Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.09.01 Page 10 of 166. Risks and Discomforts
There are minimal risks to participants. 
Patients will be reassured that nonparticipation will not affect clinical care. Patients will also be 
informed that the researchers with whom they will interact (e.g., during consent, face-to-face, 
during telephone interviews) are not health care providers. Participants will be consistently 
reminded that responses to any queries deemed sensitive or uncomfortable (e.g., country of 
origin/immigration status, income, previous history of abortion) should be considered optional, 
and they may decline to answer any question(s) and can refuse to continue the study at any 
point. Participants will be reassured that neither their opportunities for continued health care nor 
their relationships with health care providers will be jeopardized by study participation.
Health information collected as part of this study will be stored in REDCap. No identifiable data 
will be stored or downloaded on any personal or unauthorized computers. Study staff will 
access the data on institutionally purchased and managed computers that operate behind the 
health system’s security and firewall protections. Only the MGH study staff will have access to 
the identifiable data set. Once the study is completed, data will be deidentified such that it can 
be analyzed without risk of a breach of privacy or confidentiality. Any data that is shared outside 
of MGH will require a data use authorization.
Although we will make every effort to protect participant privacy and confidentiality, it is possible 
that participants' involvement in the study could become known to others. For those in the 
intervention group, we will be sending personalized messages via the patient portal; for those 
providing additional consent, we will be sending unencrypted SMS messages that will not 
contain any personal protected health information. There is the rare possibility that study 
participation or health information could become known to others despite the use of firewalls, 
password protection, and other security measures. Standard procedures, as outlined by the 
MGB Research Information Security Office, will be followed to reduce this risk.
Individuals in the intervention group will be scheduled for an appointment with a primary care 
doctor. There is the possibility that this visit may result in a charge/cost for the patient. Under 
the Affordable Care Act, commercial health plans are required to cover an annual Preventive 
Health Exam at no cost to the patient (no co-payment, co-insurance or deductible). MassHealth 
also covers these visits without cost-sharing. However, if this visit turns or scheduled as into a 
“sick” or “disease management” visit, the patient may be billed for some or all aspects of the 
services provided, depending on their insurer. We will provide directions for patients on how to 
to contact their insurers or PCP’s office prior to the visit to inquire about potential cost-sharing 
and/or deductibles. Patients will also be advised that some clinics may penalize individuals for 
not showing to a scheduled appointment (“no show” fee) and be given opportunities to request 
the appointment be canceled or rescheduled with each appointment reminder.
7. Benefits
Participants in the control group will receive information on the importance of postpartum care 
and transitioning to primary care after their delivery.
Page 16 of 41
Compiled Summary of Protocol Amendments
Page 187 of 278
Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.09.01 Page 11 of 16Participants in the intervention group will receive a bundle of interventions designed to increase 
attendance at primary care visits and facilitate the transition of care after their delivery.
The goal and potential benefits to the subjects in this trial is to increase patient engagement and 
connection with their primary care provider, receive recommended health screenings and 
directed counseling, and reduce unscheduled or urgent visits in the postpartum period.
8. Statistical Analysis
Statistical Methods
Analyses will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle.
Standard independent, two-sided, two-group comparison testing will be used to compare 
baseline characteristics between the two groups (chi squared tests, t tests, Wilcoxon rank sum 
tests, when appropriate).
The primary outcome will be attendance rates at PCP visit within 4 months after estimated date 
of delivery (captured at time of enrollment), which will be compared between the groups using 
chi squared tests. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals will be reported. 
Secondary outcomes will include measures of long-term health and health care use after the 
postpartum period. 
Subgroup analyses will be performed by a variety of patient characteristics including gestational 
age at enrollment, prenatal risk factors, morbidity types, patient race-ethnicity, payer, and 
enrollment location. 
P-value of less than 0.05 will be considered to indicate statistical significance.
Power Calculation
Most study calculations were estimated from the MGH 2020 delivery population. The rates of 
PCP follow-up were estimated from a randomly selected cohort of 50 patients who met the 
inclusion criteria. We plan to recruit patients into the study for a period of 4 months and expect 
1200 unique patients to be at the targeted gestational age during this period. Among these, we 
expect 86% to already have an assigned PCP in the network, leaving roughly 1,032 patients. 
Among these, we estimate that 49% have at least one of the targeted health conditions, leaving 
a target study population of 506 over the 4-month period. Based on previous studies conducted 
at MGH, we expect an 70% willingness to participate in the research, leaving an expected 
recruited population of 354 individuals. Based on our record extraction, we estimate that 15% of 
the targeted study population has a primary care visit within 4 months of delivery. Assuming an 
alpha of 0.05 and a baseline mean of 15%, with this expected sample size and power of 80%, 
our study has a minimum detectable effect size of roughly 13 percentage points (from 15% to 
28%). A previous study found that default scheduling into postpartum care appointments (with 
an OBGYN, not a PCP) increased postpartum care take-up by 24 percentage points; since our 
intervention incorporates defaults and other activating interventions, an MDE of 13 percentage 
points is reasonable.

Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.09.01 Page 12 of 169.   Monitoring and Quality Assurance
This is a minimal risk study in which the intervention involves default scheduling of 
appointments and patient messaging. Adverse events are not expected, and there is no 
physiologic plausibility for this intervention to cause any NIH-defined serious adverse events 
(e.g., death, prolonged hospitalization, significant disability).
No interim analyses are planned.
Adverse events will be defined and classified in accordance with NIH guidelines:
Definition of Adverse Events (AE): Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence 
in a human subject, including any abnormal sign, symptom, or disease, temporally 
associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether considered 
related to the subject’s participation in the research or not.
Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE): Any AE that (1) results in death, (2) is life-
threatening, (3) results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization, (4) results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, (5) results in a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect, and/or (6) may jeopardize the subject’s health and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other five outcomes listed 
here.
In the unlikely event an AE or SAE occurs, it will be brought to the PI's attention, and the PI 
will classify the AE/SAE by severity, expectedness, and relatedness, as listed above. All events 
that are both serious and unexpected will be reported to Mass General Brigham's IRB, the NIA 
PO, and to the NIA Roybal DSMB within 48 hours of the research team's knowledge of the 
SAE. The summary of all other SAEs will be reported to the NIA and to the DSMB quarterly 
unless otherwise specified by the DSMB. Any unanticipated problem, defined as an issue 
related to the research suggesting the research places participants or others at greater risk 
than expected, will be reported to the IRB, the NIA PO, and to the Roybal DSMB within 48 
hours of discovery. If the problem involves death then reporting will occur within 24 hours, and 
this report will include a plan to correct the problem and prevent its occurrence. Any breach of 
PHI will be reported to the PI, who will report to the IRB and NIA PO within 24 hours of 
discovery.
The Roybal DSMB oversight is provided by the Standing Roybal DSMB, which includes the 
members listed: Andrea B. Troxel, ScD (chair); Abby King, PhD; Jerry Gurwitz, MD; Hae-Ra 
Han, PhD, RN, FAAN; Hang Lee, PhD; Ezra Golberstein, PhD; David Kim,  MD PhD; 
Christopher Celano, MD.
DSMB members will have no direct involvement with the study or conflict of interest with the 
investigators or institutions conducting the study. Each member has signed a COI statement 
which includes current affiliations, if any, with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies 
(e.g., stockholder, consultant), and any other relationship that could be perceived as a conflict 
of interest related to the study and/or associated with commercial interests pertinent to study 
objectives.

Project Title: Bridging the Gap from Postpartum to Primary Care: A Behavioral 
Science Informed Intervention to Improve Chronic Disease Management 
among Postpartum Women
Version Date: 03/17/2023
Version Name/Number: v1.6
1.  Background and Significance
Burden of Chronic Disease and the Role of Primary Care
Chronic health conditions affect millions of people in the US each year. In 2018, 51.8% of adults 
had at least 1 chronic condition, and 27.2% had multiple conditions.1 The prevalence of chronic 
disease was higher in women compared to men, older adults (87.6% in adults ≥65 years old), 
and people with public insurance.1 Many chronic conditions, by their nature, develop over time 
and have risk factors that can be identified prior to the onset of disease. Strong evidence 
underpins prevention strategies for many conditions, which are advanced by the US 
Preventative Services Taskforce.2 While the long-term health of a patient is the responsibility of 
an entire health system, primary care providers (PCPs) provide an integral role in preventing, 
screening for, and managing disease across the lifespan. Studies have shown the health 
benefits of receiving regular care under a PCP.3–6
Despite the known benefits of having an identifiable usual source of care and the value of health 
care maintenance, the percent of the population with a PCP has been decreasing over time.7 
Consistently, adults who are younger (age 20-40 years) have the lowest rates of primary care 
use. In 2015, 44% and 36% of 20- and 30-year-olds had no identifiable source of primary care.7 
The proportion without primary care were also higher among racial/ethnic minority populations 
and among those who had less education, lower incomes, and no known comorbidities.7 The 
number of adults and the time elapsed without regular primary care follow-up can be considered 
missed opportunities to improve a patient’s current and long-term health. The disproportionate 
lack of primary care among certain subgroups of the population, often groups who already have 
worse health outcomes, only serves to widen the pre-existing disparities.
Pregnancy as a Window to Future Health
In the US, 98.2% of pregnant women receive some form of prenatal care, with the average 
patient having >10 visits during their pregnancy.8 During a pregnancy, women are screened for 
pre-existing and pregnancy-related conditions.9 In adults ages 18-39, the prevalence of obesity, 
hypertension, prediabetes/diabetes, and mental illness are estimated at 39%, 7.5%, 28%, 25%, 
respectively.10–13 Even for those who have no prior identified comorbidities, the most common 
Page 4 of 39

Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.09.01 Page 2 of 16pregnancy-related conditions—pregnancy-related hypertension and gestational diabetes (8% 
and 10% of pregnancies, respectively)—indicate a predisposition to or confer health risks that 
persist as women age. For example, over 25% of women with gestational diabetes will develop 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and women with pre-eclampsia have more than a two-fold risk of 
significant cardiovascular disease later in life.14,15 For these reasons, pregnancy is often 
considered a “window” into a woman’s future health and presents a unique opportunity to 
optimize a woman’s health status early in her life when she otherwise may not have been 
engaged in care.16 
Pregnancy as on Opportunity for Engagement with a Long-term Care Provider
Pregnancy is a period when women are highly engaged and active participants in their health 
care.17 It has been described as a “golden opportunity” to motivate women towards positive 
health behaviors, including prevention and management of chronic disease. However, women 
often fall off a “postpartum cliff” of health system engagement after the early postpartum 
period.18 A range of systemic, financial, and behavioral barriers often prevents patients from 
effectively transitioning to primary care. Postpartum women are often simply told to follow-up 
with their PCP without much information regarding the importance of this follow up care, without 
assistance in scheduling an appointment (or identifying a PCP if they don’t have one), and often 
without a direct transfer of relevant health information or accountability across providers. 
Postpartum women are left largely on their own to navigate this transition to primary care and, in 
particular, to navigate it at a time when they face the high cognitive and physical demands of 
caring for an infant. At this time of limited cognitive bandwidth, the importance of continuity of 
care for chronic conditions and active engagement in one’s longer-term health and wellbeing is 
unlikely to be salient and top-of-mind. These critical moments of unsupported health care 
transition can exacerbate pre-existing disparities in health and health care, with patients who 
are the least able to navigate the US health care system most likely to fall through the cracks.  
Momentum is building in US health and social safety net policy to facilitate healthy transitions 
from pregnancy to parenthood. For example, federal and state initiatives to expand pregnancy-
related Medicaid coverage from 60 days to one year postpartum have been proposed, and 
access to paid family leave is increasing. However, very little evidence exists on effective and 
cost-effective approaches to facilitating transitions to primary care and management of chronic 
diseases in the postpartum year.  
2. Specific Aims and Objectives 
The objective of the proposed study is to increase patient engagement in primary care after the 
immediate postpartum period for women with pregnancy-associated conditions that convey a 
long-term health risk. Specifically, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention bundle 
(automatic scheduling of PCP appointment after delivery, salient labeling, and appointment 
reminder nudges) to increase patient attendance at a primary care provider appointment (within 
4 months of delivery for women with or at risk for obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and/or a 
mental health condition. 
Specific Aims:
1) Test the efficacy of an intervention bundle (patient-tailored health information, automatic 
scheduling of PCP appointment after delivery, and appointment reminder nudges) to 
increase patient attendance at a primary care provider appointment within 4 months of

Version 2022.09.01 Page 3 of 16delivery for women with obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and/or a mental health 
condition
2) Test the efficacy of the intervention bundle to improve compliance with the condition-
specific, guideline-based health screenings
3) Test the efficacy of the intervention bundle to reduce unscheduled or urgent encounters 
(e.g., emergency department visits) within the health system
3. General Description of Study Design
We will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing this intervention bundle to the receipt of 
generic information on the importance of primary care follow-up after delivery.  
Women will be randomized with equal probability into either a treatment or control arm. The 
intervention combines several features designed to target reasons for low take-up of primary 
care among postpartum women (see Logic Model). We leverage the potential value of 
defaults/opt-out, salient labels, and reminders to encourage use of primary care within 4 months 
of delivery. Women in both the intervention and control arms will receive information via MGH’s 
patient portal toward the end of the pregnancy regarding the importance of transitions to primary 
care in the postpartum year. This information will be similar to, but reinforcing, the information 
they would receive from their obstetrician about following up with their primary care physician. In 
addition to this initial message, women in the treatment arm will receive the following 
intervention components, developed based on recent evidence regarding behavioral science 
approaches to activating health behaviors:19–21
➢Targeted messages about the importance and benefits of primary care. 
➢Default scheduling into a primary care appointment at approximately 3-4 months after 
delivery. The patient will be scheduled for a primary care visit with their assigned primary 
care provider in the Mass General Brigham system. They will be informed of the option to 
cancel the appointment, change the appointment day/time, or change the care provider 
either through the patient portal). 
➢Reminders about the appointment and importance of follow up primary care at 2-4 points 
during the postpartum period via the patient portal. 
➢Tailored language in the reminders based on recent evidence from behavioral science about 
the most effective approaches to increasing take-up. For example, messages will inform the 
patient that an appointment has been reserved for them at their doctor.

4. Subject Selection
Pregnant patients receiving prenatal care at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) will be 
targeted for recruitment. MGH conducts approximately 3500 deliveries per year, with roughly 
one-third of patients identifying as non-white and 35% of pregnancies covered by Medicaid.
Approximately 49% of the clinic population may ultimately be eligible to be approached.
The eligibility criteria include:
•Estimated date of delivery and the following 4-month postpartum outcome 
assessment window completed prior to study end date
•Currently pregnant or within 2 weeks of estimated date of delivery
•Have one or more of the following conditions: 
oChronic hypertension
oHypertensive disorders of pregnancy or risk factors for hypertensive disorders 
of pregnancy per the USPTF aspirin prescribing guidelines (e.g., history of 
pre-eclampsia, kidney disease, multiple gestation, autoimmune disease)22
oType 1 or 2 diabetes

Version 2022.09.01 Page 6 of 16oGestational diabetes
oObesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2)
oDepression or anxiety disorder 
•Have a primary care provider listed in the patient’s medical record 
•Receive obstetric care at an MGH-affiliated outpatient prenatal clinic
•Has access to and be enrolled in the electronic health record patient portal and 
consents to be contacted via these modalities
•Able to read/speak English or Spanish language
•Age ≥18 years old
•Not diagnosed with or undergoing evaluation for stillbirth/fetal demise
All women, regardless of race/ethnicity, who meet the eligibility criteria will be included. In 2019, 
3,789 women gave birth at the study institution, of whom 57% were white, 7% were black, 12% 
were Asian, 18% were Hispanic, and 6% declined to report their race/ethnicity. A similar 
distribution is expected for this study.
The study will distribute materials in English and Spanish languages. This encompasses >95% 
of patients who deliver at the study institution.
5. Subject Enrollment
This study will rely on recruiting for research through Patient Gateway and follow the IRB 
guidance and DHeC Research Checklist and training for this process.
In the month prior to the start of enrollment, all potentially eligible individuals (based on the 
criteria above) will be identified using RPDR and Epic Reporting search queries. This list (the 
“potentially eligible” list) will be provided to the DHeCare Research Team to build an RSH 
Record in Epic. This list will be updated monthly to identify newly eligible individuals (e.g., new 
diagnosis of gestational diabetes or new patient transferring into the practice) during the 
recruitment months and fed back to the DHeCare team to update “potentially eligible” list.
Once built and each month during recruitment phase, the study’s research coordinator (not 
study investigators) will send the IRB-approved Research Invitation Letter to patients who are 
eligible, not already enrolled, and have not declined to be sent research notifications through the 
portal. The Research Letter will employ an opt-out approach, asking individuals who do not wish 
to be approached in clinic or remotely to respond via PG messaging, email, or phone within 2 
weeks of receipt of the letter. Those who have “read” the letter and not opted out after 2 weeks 
will be moved from the “potentially eligible” list to the “waiting to be approached” list in the study 
workflow.
During recruitment months, the study coordinator will keep a log of patient’s upcoming 
appointments for those on the “waiting to be approached” list. They will then attempt to 
approach individuals for enrollment when they present for an in-person encounters (preferred). 
Patients will ideally be approached between 32-36 weeks of gestation, when feasible; however, 
priority will be given to patients at the latest gestation. For those Spanish-speaking patients, a 
hospital-based interpreter will be used when approaching/consenting patients.

Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.09.01 Page 7 of 16The study staff will introduce the study and review the purpose of the study, the nature of the 
subject’s participation, the possible risks and discomforts associated with participation, the 
potential benefits of participation, a statement of the voluntary nature of participation, and a 
description of the mechanisms used to ensure confidentiality. 
All patients will receive study-related messages through Patient Gateway. In addition, patients 
will be asked if they would be willing to receive no more than 5 SMS messages to their personal 
cell phone during the first 4 months of the postpartum period. The study staff will review the 
specific concerns and risks about receiving unencrypted text messaging communications, as 
outlined by the MGB IRB. 
A waiver of documentation of informed consent is requested, as the study presents no more 
than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is 
normally required outside of the research context. Verbal consent will be obtained for 1) overall 
study participation and 2) optional SMS message participation, separately. Verbal consent will 
be obtained from both in-person and phone recruitment efforts.
A Study Fact Sheet, which summarizes the study details, risks, and benefits, will be provided to 
all subjects who are approached, either in-person, by mail, or electronically. This Study Fact 
Sheet also includes information supplied by the MGB IRB specifically related to the concerns 
and risks of receiving unencrypted SMS/text messages.
For tracking verbal consent, the study staff will keep a detailed log in REDCap documenting:
1) name of study staff performing consent,
2) date of attempted approach,
3) the method of attempted approach (in-person or via phone),
4) use of Spanish interpreter (yes/no),
5) subject agreement to be approached (agree/disagree),
6) attestation to full review of the study procedures/risks/benefits with the subject, as would 
be done during the process of reviewing a written consent form, 
7) attestation to review of supplemental consent to receive unencrypted SMS messages 
with the subject,
8) subject overall study participation status (enrolled, declined, deferred – agrees to be 
recontacted, deferred – wishes not to be recontacted),
9) if enrolled, unencrypted SMS text messaging participation (consents, declines),
10) attestation to Study Fact Sheet provided,
11) method by which Study Fact Sheet was provided (in-person, mail, electronic),
12) date in which Study Fact Sheet was provided (in-person, mail, electronic).
6. STUDY PROCEDURES
The RA will keep a detailed log of all patients in the practice, if they are eligible, if they have 
been approached, and if they consented.
For those that agree to be enrolled, patients will be asked to complete a baseline survey to 
obtain voluntarily reported information on their demographics, socioeconomic status, health care 
visit history, and primary care provider. Patients will also be asked to consent to being contacted

Version 2022.09.01 Page 8 of 16by the research team via Patient Gateway messaging. A $20 gift card will be given at the time of 
enrollment for those that complete the questionnaire and receive the information sheet.
Randomization will occur via a prespecified random allocation sequence within strata. Within 
each stratum, the PIs will generate a random sequence of treatment-control allocation prior the 
enrollment of subjects. Then, as patients within strata are enrolled, they will be assigned to the 
treatment arm associated with that enrollment number. 
Control Group
Approximately 2 weeks before a patient’s estimated due date (EDD) or as soon as enrolled if 
this date has passed, the patient will be sent information via the Patient Gateway on the 
importance of postpartum care and follow-up with their PCP.
Intervention Group
1. Tailored Information:
Approximately 2-4 weeks prior to the EDD (or later for those who are enrolled beyond 38 
weeks gestation or postnatally), the patient will be sent an information via the Patient 
Gateway on the importance of postpartum care and follow-up with their PCP, which also 
includes the name and phone number of their primary care provider. 
2. Scheduled PCP Appointment:
Between 2-3 weeks after their delivery, the RA will call the patient’s PCP office and 
make an appointment for them between 3-4 months after delivery based on the 
scheduling preferences obtained in the initial survey.
3. Targeted Appointment Message with Salient Labeling:
After the PCP appointment has been made, the patient will be sent a Patient Gateway 
message saying that a PCP appointment has been reserved for them with the 
date/time/location information.
For those consenting to receive SMS messages, an unencrypted text message will also 
be sent simultaneously.
4. Nudge Reminders: 
Patient Gateway messages will be sent at approximately 4-8 weeks (goal: 4 weeks) and 
1-4 week (goal: 1 week) prior to their PCP appointment, reminding a patient of their 
upcoming appointment. 
For those consenting to receive SMS messages, an unencrypted text message will also 
be sent simultaneously.
5. Facilitated PCP Communication:
A study staff member will send the patient’s PCP an Epic Inbasket message that the 
patient 1) is recently postpartum, 2) has or developed health conditions that need long-
term management, and 3) has been scheduled (or attempted to be scheduled) for a 
follow-up visit.
All messages will be made available in English and Spanish.
The text for these Patient Gateway messages is included in the submission. At the end of each 
patient message, patients will be given the opportunity to stop receiving study-related messages 
by emailing or calling the study staff. “Opt out” requests will be logged and patients removed 
from future planned study-related contact.

Google Voice. We will follow standard recommendations from the MGB Research Information 
Security for using this system (included under Privacy and Confidentiality section).
Outcome Assessment
1. EHR Review
The study team will review the patient’s EHR record for the primary and secondary outcome 
assessments. Patients will be asked to consent to have records reviewed up to 2 years after the 
date of their delivery to allow for long-term effects of the intervention on primary care use and 
health status. 
2. Endline Survey
After 4 months from their established due date (EDD), a patient will be eligible to participate the 
endline survey. The goal timing for the survey completion is 4-6 months after the EDD, but 
patients will remain eligible for up to one year. 
The survey will be administered through REDCap. Study participants will be emailed a unique 
link to complete the survey. Consent to be contacted for this survey will be obtained at the time 
of the subject’s enrollment in the trial. The patient’s email address for contact is verified at the 
time of study enrollment. 
Subjects will be asked to complete a 15-20-minute survey on their care after their delivery. They 
will be reminded that all questions are optional and that responses will be linked to their study 
record; however, no responses will be entered into the electronic health record or become part 
of their permanent medical record. Participants who complete the survey will be offered a $20 
gift card for their participation, which they will be informed of prior to starting the survey. There is 
no penalty for not completing the survey.
If there is no response within approximately 1-2 weeks, the subject will be emailed the link again 
with a reminder to complete the survey. If there is no response within approximately 2-4 weeks 
from the initial email OR the patient does not have a working email address, the subject will be 
called and asked if they would like to complete the survey over the phone. For those that agree, 
the survey text and questions will be read verbatim by a research assistant not affiliated with the 
patient’s clinical care. Individuals who decline to participate in the survey over the phone or 
cannot be reached will be marked as non-respondents.
Patients that consented to receive SMS messages as a part of the study will be sent a text 
message reminder to complete the survey at the same time that emails are sent. No more than 
2 SMS message reminders will be sent to each subject.
Deidentified data from this project may be shared outside of MGB with the study funders (J-
PAL/NBER/NIA) for data sharing and reproducibility requirements and secondary statistical 
analysis. All data will be stripped of patient identifiers, per IRB guidance. No data will be shared 
without a formal Data Use Agreement with MGB.

Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.09.01 Page 10 of 166. Risks and Discomforts
There are minimal risks to participants. 
Patients will be reassured that nonparticipation will not affect clinical care. Patients will also be 
informed that the researchers with whom they will interact (e.g., during consent, face-to-face, 
during telephone interviews) are not health care providers. Participants will be consistently 
reminded that responses to any queries deemed sensitive or uncomfortable (e.g., country of 
origin/immigration status, income, previous history of abortion) should be considered optional, 
and they may decline to answer any question(s) and can refuse to continue the study at any 
point. Participants will be reassured that neither their opportunities for continued health care nor 
their relationships with health care providers will be jeopardized by study participation.
Health information collected as part of this study will be stored in REDCap. No identifiable data 
will be stored or downloaded on any personal or unauthorized computers. Study staff will 
access the data on institutionally purchased and managed computers that operate behind the 
health system’s security and firewall protections. Only the MGH study staff will have access to 
the identifiable data set. Once the study is completed, data will be deidentified such that it can 
be analyzed without risk of a breach of privacy or confidentiality. Any data that is shared outside 
of MGH will require a data use authorization.
Although we will make every effort to protect participant privacy and confidentiality, it is possible 
that participants' involvement in the study could become known to others. For those in the 
intervention group, we will be sending personalized messages via the patient portal; for those 
providing additional consent, we will be sending unencrypted SMS messages that will not 
contain any personal protected health information. There is the rare possibility that study 
participation or health information could become known to others despite the use of firewalls, 
password protection, and other security measures. Standard procedures, as outlined by the 
MGB Research Information Security Office, will be followed to reduce this risk.
Individuals in the intervention group will be scheduled for an appointment with a primary care 
doctor. There is the possibility that this visit may result in a charge/cost for the patient. Under 
the Affordable Care Act, commercial health plans are required to cover an annual Preventive 
Health Exam at no cost to the patient (no co-payment, co-insurance or deductible). MassHealth 
also covers these visits without cost-sharing. However, if this visit turns or scheduled as into a 
“sick” or “disease management” visit, the patient may be billed for some or all aspects of the 
services provided, depending on their insurer. We will provide directions for patients on how to 
to contact their insurers or PCP’s office prior to the visit to inquire about potential cost-sharing 
and/or deductibles. Patients will also be advised that some clinics may penalize individuals for 
not showing to a scheduled appointment (“no show” fee) and be given opportunities to request 
the appointment be canceled or rescheduled with each appointment reminder.
7. Benefits
Participants in the control group will receive information on the importance of postpartum care 
and transitioning to primary care after their delivery.

Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board
Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.09.01 Page 11 of 16Participants in the intervention group will receive a bundle of interventions designed to increase 
attendance at primary care visits and facilitate the transition of care after their delivery.
The goal and potential benefits to the subjects in this trial is to increase patient engagement and 
connection with their primary care provider, receive recommended health screenings and 
directed counseling, and reduce unscheduled or urgent visits in the postpartum period.
8. Statistical Analysis
Statistical Methods
Analyses will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle.
Standard independent, two-sided, two-group comparison testing will be used to compare 
baseline characteristics between the two groups (chi squared tests, t tests, Wilcoxon rank sum 
tests, when appropriate).
The primary outcome will be attendance rates at PCP visit within 4 months after estimated date 
of delivery (captured at time of enrollment), which will be compared between the groups using 
chi squared tests. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals will be reported. 
Secondary outcomes will include measures of long-term health and health care use after the 
postpartum period. 
Subgroup analyses will be performed by a variety of patient characteristics including gestational 
age at enrollment, prenatal risk factors, morbidity types, patient race-ethnicity, payer, and 
enrollment location. 
P-value of less than 0.05 will be considered to indicate statistical significance.
Power Calculation
Most study calculations were estimated from the MGH 2020 delivery population. The rates of 
PCP follow-up were estimated from a randomly selected cohort of 50 patients who met the 
inclusion criteria. We plan to recruit patients into the study for a period of 4 months and expect 
1200 unique patients to be at the targeted gestational age during this period. Among these, we 
expect 86% to already have an assigned PCP in the network, leaving roughly 1,032 patients. 
Among these, we estimate that 49% have at least one of the targeted health conditions, leaving 
a target study population of 506 over the 4-month period. Based on previous studies conducted 
at MGH, we expect an 70% willingness to participate in the research, leaving an expected 
recruited population of 354 individuals. Based on our record extraction, we estimate that 15% of 
the targeted study population has a primary care visit within 4 months of delivery. Assuming an 
alpha of 0.05 and a baseline mean of 15%, with this expected sample size and power of 80%, 
our study has a minimum detectable effect size of roughly 13 percentage points (from 15% to 
28%). A previous study found that default scheduling into postpartum care appointments (with 
an OBGYN, not a PCP) increased postpartum care take-up by 24 percentage points; since our 
intervention incorporates defaults and other activating interventions, an MDE of 13 percentage 
points is reasonable.

Intervention/Interaction Detailed Protocol
Version 2022.09.01 Page 12 of 169.   Monitoring and Quality Assurance
This is a minimal risk study in which the intervention involves default scheduling of 
appointments and patient messaging. Adverse events are not expected, and there is no 
physiologic plausibility for this intervention to cause any NIH-defined serious adverse events 
(e.g., death, prolonged hospitalization, significant disability).
No interim analyses are planned.
Adverse events will be defined and classified in accordance with NIH guidelines:
Definition of Adverse Events (AE): Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence 
in a human subject, including any abnormal sign, symptom, or disease, temporally 
associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether considered 
related to the subject’s participation in the research or not.
Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE): Any AE that (1) results in death, (2) is life-
threatening, (3) results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization, (4) results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, (5) results in a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect, and/or (6) may jeopardize the subject’s health and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other five outcomes listed 
here.
In the unlikely event an AE or SAE occurs, it will be brought to the PI's attention, and the PI 
will classify the AE/SAE by severity, expectedness, and relatedness, as listed above. All events 
that are both serious and unexpected will be reported to Mass General Brigham's IRB, the NIA 
PO, and to the NIA Roybal DSMB within 48 hours of the research team's knowledge of the 
SAE. The summary of all other SAEs will be reported to the NIA and to the DSMB quarterly 
unless otherwise specified by the DSMB. Any unanticipated problem, defined as an issue 
related to the research suggesting the research places participants or others at greater risk 
than expected, will be reported to the IRB, the NIA PO, and to the Roybal DSMB within 48 
hours of discovery. If the problem involves death then reporting will occur within 24 hours, and 
this report will include a plan to correct the problem and prevent its occurrence. Any breach of 
PHI will be reported to the PI, who will report to the IRB and NIA PO within 24 hours of 
discovery.
The Roybal DSMB oversight is provided by the Standing Roybal DSMB, which includes the 
members listed: Andrea B. Troxel, ScD (chair); Abby King, PhD; Jerry Gurwitz, MD; Hae-Ra 
Han, PhD, RN, FAAN; Hang Lee, PhD; Ezra Golberstein, PhD; David Kim,  MD PhD; 
Christopher Celano, MD.
DSMB members will have no direct involvement with the study or conflict of interest with the 
investigators or institutions conducting the study. Each member has signed a COI statement 
which includes current affiliations, if any, with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies 
(e.g., stockholder, consultant), and any other relationship that could be perceived as a conflict 
of interest related to the study and/or associated with commercial interests pertinent to study 
objectives.

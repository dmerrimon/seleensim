PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Clinical Protocol ESR -14-10531/WINSHIP3112 -15 
Study Title:  A randomized study of tremelimumab plus durvalumab combination with or without 
radiation in relapsed small cell lung cancer  
Protocol Number:  ESR- 14-10531 /Winship 3112-15  
Clinical Phase:  2 
Study Duration:  36 months  
Investigational Product(s) and Reference Therapy:  
• Durvalumab (MEDI4736) will be supplied in glass vials containing 500 mg of liquid solution at a 
concentration of 50 mg/mL for intravenous (IV) administration.  
• Tremelimumab is supplied as a sterile solution for IV infusion, filled in 20 mL clear glass vials with a 
rubber stopper and aluminum seal. Each vial contains 20 m g/mL (with a nominal fill of 20 mL, 
accounting to 400 mg/vial) of tremelimumab, in an isotonic solution at pH 5.5.  
Research Hypothesis  
1. Immune checkpoint therapy will be efficacious and will confer meaningful clinical benefit in relapsed SCLC  
2. Priming with XRT prior to immune checkpoint treatment will result in enhanced clinical efficacy of 
immune checkpoint modulators in relapsed SCLC  
Objectives:  
Primary Objectives:  
To compare the efficacy (PFS and ORR) of combined immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy with or 
without radiation as treatment for relapsed SCLC  
Secondary Objective(s) : 
Assess the impact of antigen priming using XRT on the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors  
Determine the overall survival (OS) associated with this treatment strategy in relapsed SCLC  
Exploratory Objective(s):  
Characterize tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and PD-L1/PD1 expression in paired tumor biopsies 
at baseline, end of cycle 2 and at the time of progression. 
Determine dynamic changes in cell free DNA( cfDNA)  and the immunophenotype of peripheral blood 
repertoire of circulating lymphocytes using multiparameter flow cytometry  
Determine changes in circulating cytokine mediators of inflammation and immunity using Luminex assay

Standard Treatment:  
Priming XRT (Arm II only) up to 30Gy in 1 week  
Study Assessmen ts and Criteria for Evaluation: 
Safety Assessments:  
Safety and toxicity will be assessed and graded using CTCAE v. 4.0 
Patient reported outcome assessed using FACT -L questionnaire  
Efficacy Assessments:  
Primary:  
i. Progression free survival (PFS)  
PFS will be measured from time of enrolment until objective disease progression or death  
 
ii. Objective response rate  
Objective response (ORR, DoR, DCR) will be assessed using cross sectional imaging and 
categorized according to RECIST 1.1 criteria 
 
Secondary:  
i. Immune related objective response rate  
ii. Overall su rvival  
Exploratory: 
Pharmacodynamic / Pharmacokinetic Assessments (if applicable):  
i. Immunophenotype of TILs and peripheral circulating lymphocyte 
ii. Changes in circulating (cfDNA) 
iii. PD-L1 expression in paired tumor biopsy following treatment using the Ventana assay  
iv. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) repertoire and PD-L1/PD1 expression in tumor 
biopsies collected at: 
a. Baseline  
b. End of cycle 2 
c. At progression. 
vii 
 
v. Dynamic changes in (cfDNA) and the immunophenotype of peripheral blood repertoire of 
circulating lymphocytes using multiparameter flow cytometry  
Changes in circulating cytokine mediators of inflammation, type I and type II immune response using 
Luminex assay  
Statistical Methods and Data Analysis:  
Data on patient demographics, tumor characteristics, response rate and pharmacodynamic (PD) 
biomarkers will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
Randomization by blocked randomization at the end  of screening for all eligible patients 
OS and PFS ti me will be analyzed using Kaplan Meier method 
Inferential statistics will be employed to correlate PD biomarkers and efficacy outcome. Two -sided 
paired t -test will be used to compare biomarkers expressions between pre and post treatment samples. 
ANOVA and Kruskal -Wallis tests will be used to compare the degree of biomarker changes between the 
treatment groups. The proportion of patients with objective response will be estimated with exact 95% 
confidence intervals. Changes in pharmacodynamic endpoints will b e correlated with response using 
Fisher exact test.  
All analysis will be performed using SAS software version 9.3.  
Sample Size Determination:  
For sample size determination, efficacy comparison was based on historical data with topotecan. 
Assuming a median PFS of 3 months if the intervention is no better than the historical PFS associated 
with topotecan based on the PFS from two recent randomized phase III studies of topotecan (Evans et al., 
2015),( von Pawel et al., 2014 ) and a promising median PFS of 7 months if the investigational treatment is 
superior (based on the duration of response recorded in a phase II study of combined PD-1 and CTLA -4 
blockade in relapsed SCLC), 10 patients treated in each arm of the study will provide 87% power to 
demonstrate the hypothesized efficacy improvement at  a 1 -sided 10% alpha level test.  
Similarly, with the same sample size of 10 patients in each arm, we will have 64% power at a 1-sided alpha of 10% to demonstrate a promising response rate of 30% for the investigational therapy versus the 
historical response rate of 10% with topotecan in the same patient population. Assuming an observed 
response rate of 30% (3 out of 10 patients) the 95% exact confidence interval of the response rate will be 
[6.7%, 65.2%] and 90% exact confidence internal of the response rate will be [8.7%, 60.7%].

the first infusion only and then for subsequent infusions as clinically indicated 
If the infusion takes longer than 60 minutes then blood pressure and pulse measurements should follow the principles as described above or more frequently if 
clinically indicated.  
e Baseline ECG on C1D1 and on treatment ECG on C3D1 (Week 9). ECGs should be taken within an hour prior to the start of the infusion and at least one time point 0 to 3 hours after the infusion.   
f See section 8.2.5 for list of labs. If screening laboratory assessments are performed within 3 days prior to Day 1 they do not need to be repeated at Day 1. Results for safety bloods must be available and reviewed before commencing an infusion. Gamma glutamyltransferase tested at Screening, Day 1 and as clinically indicated.    
g Free T3 and free T4 will only be measured if TSH is abnormal . They should also be measured if there is clinical suspicion of an adverse event related to the endocrine 
system.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1 Disease Backgrou nd 
SCLC is one of the most lethal cancers with more than 20,000 newly diagnosed patients in the 
US in 2014 (Siegel et al., 2014). More than 80% of these patients die from their disease within 
2 years of diagnosis and less than 5% of patients are alive at 5 years (Owonikoko et al., 2007). 
There has not been any meaningful improvement in the survival of SCLC patients in the past 3 decades (Behera et al., 2014). Although the majority of SCLC patients (70%) will respond to frontline chemotherapy, there is a near universal recurrence of disease, which is oftentimes 
resistant to further treatment leading to early death (Pillai and Owonikoko, 2014). The 
relapsed disease setting therefore represents the area of greatest unmet need for novel treatments in SCLC. Different strategies to improve outcomes following relapse have met with limited success (Owonikoko et al., 2012). Indeed, single agent topotecan remains the 
only approved treatment for relapsed SCLC more than 2 decades after its initial approval 
based on toxicity profile rather than superior efficacy compared to conventional multi -agent 
chemotherapy (Schiller et al., 2001; Schiller et al., 1996). While the use of targeted biologic agents has led to astounding success in the treatment of non- small cell lung canc er (Shaw et 
al., 2013a; Shaw et al., 2013b) novel approaches have not been successful to date in SCLC. 
Tumor- Directed Immunity and SCLC  
SCLC patients with paraneoplastic syndrome achieve prolonged and durable disease control in 
contrast to patients without  paraneoplastic syndrome in the setting of SCLC diagnosis 
(Maddison et al., 1999; Tani et al., 2008). Also, high levels of suppressor T -reg and low 
effector T cells were observed in the peripheral circulation of patients with extensive stage (SCLC -ED) and limited stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC -LD) who progress following 
frontline therapy. Similarly, a high ratio of effector cells to T -regs was associated with 
improved survival in SCLC -LD (Koyama et al., 2008). Recent data indicates potential benefit 
of immune checkpoint inhibitors in SCLC where phased, (but not concurrent) administration 
of ipilimumab, an anti -CTLA4 antibody, with chemotherapy demonstrated improved efficacy 
in SCLC -ED (Reck et al., 2013).  
Limited institutional experience and large rando mized studies also suggest survival benefit of 
XRT in SCLC- ED (Ben J. Slotman, 2014; Guy C. Jones, 2014). Moreover, XRT can induce 
PD-L1 expression on Tumor and stromal cells along with increase in myeloid-derived 
suppressor cells (MDSCs) in preclinical mo dels (Deng et al., 2014a; Deng et al., 2014b). 
Furthermore, the release of Tumor -associated antigens following cell death induced by XRT 
may be highly immunogenic (Deng et al., 2014a; Deng et al., 2014b), leading to potent

abscopal effect at distant Tumor sites (Blanquicett et al., 2005). The combination of an anti -
PD-L1 inhibitor and XRT was also synergistic in xenograft models of pancreatic, colon and 
breast cancer (Blanquicett et al., 2005; Deng et al., 2014a; Deng et al., 2014b).  
Immune responses directed against tumors are one of the body’s natural defense against the 
growth and proliferation of cancer cells. However, over time and under pressure from immune 
attack, cancers develop strategies to evade immune- mediated killing allowing them to develop 
unchecked. One such mechanism involves upregulation of surface proteins that deliver 
inhibitory signals to cytotoxic T cells. Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1) is one such 
protein, and is upregulated in a broad range of cancers with a high frequency, with up to 88% 
expression in some tumor types. In a number of these cancers, including lung (Mu et al, 
2011), renal (Thompson et al, 2005; Thompson et al, 2006; Krambeck et al, 2007), pancreatic (Nomi et al, 2007; Loos et al, 2008; Wang et al, 2010), ovarian cancer (Hamanishi et al, 2007), and hematologic malignancies (Andorsky et al, 2011; Brusa et al, 2013) tumor cell 
expression of PD-L1 is associated with reduced survival and an unfavorable prognosis. 
Programmed cell death ligand 1 is part of a comple x system of receptors and ligands that are 
involved in controlling T -cell activation. PD -L1 acts at multiple sites in the body to help 
regulate normal immune responses and is utilized by tumors to help evade detection and 
elimination by the host immune sys tem tumor response. In the lymph nodes, PD -L1 on 
antigen -presenting cells binds to PD -1 or CD80 on activated T cells and delivers an inhibitory 
signal to the T cell (Keir et al, 2008; Park et al, 2010). This results in reduced T -cell activation 
and fewer activated T cells in circulation. In the tumor microenvironment, PD -L1 expressed 
on tumor cells binds to PD -1 and CD80 on activated T cells reaching the tumor. This delivers 
an inhibitory signal to those T cells, preventing them from killing target cancer c ells and 
protecting the tumor from immune elimination (Zou and Chen, 2008). 
Immune responses directed against tumors are one of the body’s natural defenses against 
the growth and proliferation of cancer cells. T cells play a critical role in antitumor 
immu nity and  their infiltration and activity have been linked to improved prognosis 
in a number of cancers ( Pagès et al, 2010 ; Nakano et al, 2001; Suzuki et al, 2011; Burt et al, 
2011). Immune evasion, primarily through suppression of T -cell activity, is now recognized as 
one of the hallmarks of cancer. Such evasion can occur via a range of mechanisms including production of suppressive cytokines such as IL -10, secretion of chemokines and growth 
factors that recruit and sustain suppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) and inflammatory 
macrophages, and expression of inhibitory surface molecules such as B7- H1. Tumor types 
characterized as being responsive to immunotherapy -based approaches include melanoma 
(Weber et al, 2012), renal cell carcinoma (RCC; McDermott, 2009), bladder cancer ( Kresowi k 
and Griffith, 2009), and malignant mesothelioma ( Bograd et al, 2011). Inhibition of CTLA -4 
signaling is a validated approach to cancer therapy, as shown by the approval in 2011 of 
2

ipilimumab for the treatment of metastatic melanoma based on statistically significant and 
clinically meaningful improvement in OS ( Hodi et al, 2010; Robert et al, 2011).  
In general, tumor response rates to anti- CTLA -4 therapy are low (~10%). However, in patients 
who respond, the responses are generally durable, lasting several months even in patients with 
aggressive tumors such as refractory metastatic melanoma. Because these agents work 
through activation of the immune system and not by directly targeting the tumor, responses 
can occur late and some patients may have perceived progression of their disease in advance of developing disease stabilization or a tumor response. In some cases, early growth of pre -
existing lesions or the a ppearance of new lesions may have been due to immune -cell 
infiltration into the tumor and not due to proliferation and extension of neoplastic cells, per se (Wolchok et al, 2009). Overall, although the impact on conventional ly-defined PFS can be 
small, durable response or stable disease seen in a proportion of patients can lead to significant prolongation of OS. The melanoma data with ipilimumab clearly demonstrate that 
a small proportion of patients with an objective response had significant prolongation of OS, 
supporting the development of this class of agents in other tumors. Although Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies of tremelimumab in metastatic melanoma did not meet the primary endpoints of response rate and OS, respectively, the data suggest activity of tremelimumab in melanoma 
(Kirkwood et al, 2010; Ribas et al, 2013). In a large Phase  3 randomized study comparing 
tremelimumab with dacarbazine (DTIC)/temozolomide in patients with advanced melanoma, the reported median OS in the final analysis was 12.58 months for tremelimumab versus 10.71 months for DTIC/temozolomide (HR = 1.1416, p = 0.1272; Ribas et al, 2013).    
Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in relapsed SCLC 
There is limited experience with checkpoint inhibitors in relapsed SCLC compared to NSCLC where this class of agents is now an approved standard of care option. Preliminary results of early phase clinical trial s of anti PD -1 and anti PD -L1 inhibitors in SCLC showed strong 
promise. IN KEYNOTE -028 study, pembrolizumab was tested in relapsed SCLC patients who 
have failed standard therapy. Pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg) was given every 2 weeks for up to 2 year or until confirmed progression or unacceptable toxicity. A total of 157 patients with SCLC were screened of which 42 (29%) had PD -L1+ tumors (defined as >1% staining). 
Twenty patients were treated with pembrolizumab (55% men; median age, 59 y; 75% ECOG 
PS 1). All 20 treated patients received prior platinum and etoposide. Grade 3- 5 adverse events 
were Asthenia (5%), elevated bilirubin (5%) and colitis (5%).  Seven of 20 (35%) evaluable 
patients had a partial response; one (5%) patient had stable disease while the remai ning 
patients either had progressive disease (9; 45%) or had not yet had an assessment performed 
(3; 15%). The time to response was 8.6 weeks (7.7- 16.1 weeks) and responses were durable, 
with all responders on treatment for 16+ weeks (Ott et al., 2015).

CHECKMATE 032 was a phase I/II trial that studied nivolumab, anti PD -1 antibody as a 
single agent and in combination with ipilimumab, an antibody targeting CTLA4. The study 
enrolled 128 patients (regardless of PD -L1 expression) and assign them to nivolumab alone 
(3mg/kg Q3W); nivolumab (1mg/kg Q3W) plus ipilimumab (1mg/kg Q3W); nivolumab (1mg/kg Q3W) plus ipilimumab (3mg/kg Q3W) and nivolumab (3mg/kg Q3W) plus 
ipilimumab (1mg/kg Q3W). After four cycles of treatment, all patients continued with single 
agent n ivolumab (3mg/kg Q2W). Pooled data from 90 patients treated with single agent (40 
patients) or combination (50 patients) showed intriguing signal of efficacy especially for the combination. The median age was 63 and 65 in both groups respectively with appr oximately 
35% with platinum refractory disease. Treatment -related adverse events were uncommon 
(7.5% versus 11%) and treatment -related death in a patient treated with the combination. The 
response rate was 18% and 32% respectively and disease control rate of 38 and 54% in the single agent nivolumab and combination groups respectively.  The median duration of 
response was not yet reached (4.1; 11+) for the Nivolumab single agent arm and 6.9 months 
(1.5; 11.1+) for the combination arm. The median OS was 4.4 (2.9, 9.4) months versus 8.2 (3.7, NR) months in the single agent and the combination groups respectively (Antonia et al., 2015). 
1.1.1 Immunotherapies  
It is increasingly understood that cancers are recognized by the immune system, and, under 
some circumstances, the immune system may control or even eliminate tumors ( Dunn 
et al 2004).  Studies in mouse models of transplantable tumors have demonstrated that 
mani pulation of co -stimulatory or co -inhibitory signals can amplify T -cell responses against 
tumors.  This amplification may be accomplished by blocking co -inhibitory molecules, such 
as cytotoxic T -lymphocyte- associated antigen 4 (CTLA -4) or programmed cell de ath 1 
(PD-1), from binding with their ligands, B7 or B7- H1 (programmed cell death ligand 1 [PD -
L1]).   
1.1.2 Durvalumab  
The non- clinical and clinical experience is fully described in the current version of the 
durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure (IB Version 8.0).   
Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 kappa 
subclass that inhibits binding of PD -L1 and is being developed by AstraZeneca/MedImmune 
for use in the treatment of cancer.  (MedImmune is a wholly owned subsidiary of 
AstraZeneca; AstraZeneca/MedImmune will be referred to as AstraZeneca throughout this document.)  As durvalumab is an engineered mAb, it does not induce antibody -dependent 
cellular cytotoxicity or complement- dependent cytotoxicity.  The proposed mechanism of 
action for durvalumab is interference of the interaction of PD -L1.

PD-L1 is expressed in a broad range of cancers with a high frequency, up to 88% in some 
types of cancers.  In a number of these cancers, including lung, the expression of PD -L1 is 
associated with reduced survival and an unfavorable prognosis.  In lung cancer, only 12% of 
patients with tumors expressing PD -L1 survived for more than 3 years, compared with 20% of 
patients with tumors lacking PD -L1 (Mu et al 2011).  Based on these findings, an anti -PD-L1 
antibody could be used therapeutically to enhance anti -tumor immune responses in patients 
with cancer.  Results of several non -clinical studies using mouse tumor models support this 
hypothesis, where antibodies directed against PD -L1 or its receptor PD -1 showed anti -tumor 
activity ( Hirano  et al 2005, Iwai et al 2002).  
Durvalumab has been given to humans as part of ongoing studies as a single drug or in 
combination with other drug s As of the DCO dates (15Apr2015 to 12Jul2015, durvalumab IB 
version 8.0), a total of 1,883 subjects have been enrolled and treated in 30 ongoing durvalumab clinical studies, including 20 sponsored and 10 collaborative studies. Of the 1,883 
subjects, 1,279 received durvalumab monotherapy, 440 received durvalumab in combination 
with tremelimumab or other anticancer agents, 14 received other agents (1 gefitinib, 13 
MEDI6383), and 150 have been treated with blinded investigational product. No studies have been  completed or terminated prematurely due to toxicity.  
As of 09Feb2015, PK data were available for 378 subjects in  the dose -escalation and dose -
expansion phases of Study CD -ON-durvalumab-1108 following treatment with durvalumab  
0.1 to 10 mg/kg every 2 week s (Q2W) or 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W). The maximum 
observed concentration (C
max) increased in an approximately dose- proportional manner over 
the dose range of 0.1 to 15 mg/kg. The area under the concentration -time curve from 0 to 
14 days (AUC 0-14) increased in a greater than dose -proportional manner over the dose range of 
0.1 to 3 mg/kg and increased dose -proportionally at ≥ 3 mg/kg. These results suggest 
durvalumab exhibits nonlinear PK likely due to saturable target- mediated CL at doses < 3 
mg/kg and ap proaches linearity at doses ≥  3 mg/kg. Near complete target saturation (soluble 
programmed cell death ligand 1 [sPD -L1] and membrane bound) is expected with durvalumab 
≥ 3 mg/kg Q2W. Exposures after multiple doses showed accumulation consistent with PK parameters estimated from the first dose. In addition, PK simulations indicate that following 
durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W dosing, >  90% of subjects are expected to maintain PK exposure 
≥ 40 µg/mL throughout the dosing interval. 
As of 09Feb2015, a total of 388 subjects provided samples for ADA analysis. Only 8 of 
388 subjects (1 subject each in 0.1, 1, 3, and 15 mg/kg cohorts, and 4 subjects in 10 mg/kg cohort) were ADA positive with an impact on PK/pharmacodynamics in 1 subject in the 
3 mg/kg cohort.

known as CD152 (cluster of differentiation 152)  This is an immunomodulatory therapy (IMT) 
that is being developed by AstraZeneca for use in the treatment of cancer.   
Binding of CTLA -4 to its target ligands (B7 -1 and B7- 2) provides a negative regulatory 
signal, which limits T -cell activation.  Anti- CTLA -4 inhibitors antagonize the binding of 
CTLA -4 to B7 ligands and enhance human T -cell activation as demonstrated by increased 
cytokine (interleukin [IL] -2 and interferon [IFN] gamma) production in vitro in whole blood 
or peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures.  In addition, blockade of CTLA -4 
binding to B7 by anti -CTLA -4 antibodies results in markedly enhanced T -cell activation and 
anti-tumor activity in animal models, including killing of established murine solid tumors and 
induction of protective anti -tumor immunity.  (Refer to the tremelimumab IB, Edition 5.0, for 
more information.)  Therefore, it is expected that treatment with an anti- CTLA -4 antibody, 
such as tremelimumab, will le ad to increased activation of the human immune system, 
increasing anti -tumor activity in patients with solid tumors.    
An extensive program of non- clinical and clinical studies has been conducted for 
tremelimumab both as monotherapy and combination therapy  with conventional anticancer 
agents to support various cancer indications using different dose schedules.  As of the data 
cut-off date of 12 November 2014 (for all studies except D4190C00006, which has a cut -off 
date of 4  December  2014), 973 patients have  received tremelimumab monotherapy (not 
including 497 patients who have been treated in the blinded Phase 2b study, D4880C00003) 
and 208 patients have received tremelimumab in combination with other agents.  Details on the safety profile of tremelimumab mo notherapy are summarized in Section  1.4.2.2.  Refer to 
the current tremelimumab IB for a complete summary of non -clinical and clinical information;  
see Section  6.6 for guidance on management of tremelimumab- related toxicities.   
Tremelimumab exhibited a biphasic PK profile with a long terminal phase half -life of 22  days.  
Overall, a low incidence of ADAs (<6%) was observed for treatment with tremelimumab.   
1.1.4 Durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab  
Targeting both PD -1 and CTLA -4 pathways may have additive or synergistic activity because 
the mechanisms of action of CTLA -4 and PD -1 are non -redundant; therefore, AstraZeneca is 
also investigating the use of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy for the 
treatment of cancer.

Study D4190C00006 is a Phase Ib dose -escalation study to establish safety, PK/PDx, and 
preliminary anti- tumor activity of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy in 
patients with advanced NSCLC.  The dosing schedule utilized is durvalumab every 2 weeks 
(q2w) or every 4 weeks (q4w) up to Week 50 and 48 (12 months), combined with 
tremelimumab q4w up to Week 24 for 7 doses then ever y 12 weeks for 2 additional doses for 
up to 12 months.  The study is ongoing and continues to accrue.   
Study D4190C00006:  As of 20Feb2015, durvalumab PK (n = 55) and tremelimumab PK 
(n = 26) data were available from 10 cohorts (1a, 2a, 3a, 3b, 4, 4a, 5, 5a, 8, and 9) following 
durvalumab every 4 weeks (Q4W) or Q2W dosing in combination with tremelimumab Q4W 
regimens. An approximately dose -proportional increase in PK exposure (C max and area under 
the concentration- time curve from 0 to 28 days [AUC 0-28]) of both durvalumab and 
tremelimumab was observed over the dose range of 3 to 15 mg/kg durvalumab Q4W and 1 to 
10 mg/kg tremelimumab Q4W. Exposures following multiple doses demonstrated 
accumulation consistent with PK parameters estimated from the first dose. It is to be noted 
that steady state PK parameters are based on limited numbers of subjects. The observed PK 
exposures of durvalumab and tremelimumab following combination were consistent with respective monotherapy data, indicating no PK interaction betwee n these 2 agents.  
As of 20Feb2015, ADA data were available from 60 subjects for durvalumab and 53 subjects for tremelimumab in Study D4190C00006. Four of 60 subjects were ADA positive for anti-durvalumab antibodies post treatment. One of 53 subjects was ADA positive for 
anti-tremelimumab antibodies post treatment. There was no clear relationship between ADA 
and the dose of either durvalumab or tremelimumab, and no obvious association between ADA and safety or efficacy.  
Durvalumab has also been combined with other anticancer agents, including gefitinib, dabrafenib, and trametinib. To date, no PK interaction has been observed between durvalumab and these agents.  
1.2 Research hypothesis  
1. Immune checkpoint therapy will be eff icacious and will confer meaningful clinical benefit 
in relapsed SCLC  
2. Concomitant immune checkpoint treatment with XRT will enhance the clinical efficacy of 
immune checkpoint modulators in relapsed SCLC  
1.3 Rationale for conducting this study  
SCLC patients  with paraneoplastic syndrome achieve prolonged and durable disease control in 
contrast to patients without paraneoplastic syndrome in the setting of SCLC diagnosis. (10,

11) Also, high levels of suppressor T-reg and low effector T cells were observed in t he 
peripheral circulation of patients with extensive stage (SCLC -ED) and limited stage small cell 
lung cancer (SCLC-LD) who progress following frontline therapy. Similarly, a high ratio of 
effector cells to T -regs was associated with improved survival in S CLC -LD. (12) Recent data 
indicates potential benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors in SCLC where phased, (but not concurrent) administration of ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA4 antibody, with chemotherapy demonstrated improved efficacy in SCLC- ED.(13) Prelimina ry report of studies of PD-1 
pathway targeted therapy showed reliable signal of activity in relapsed SCLC. Moreover, the combination of a CTLA-4 and PD-1 pathway targeting agents showed greater benefit over single agent. Nonetheless, only a third of patients derived significant benefit from this combination therapy strategy. The incorporation of a complementary intervention likely to further enhance immune checkpoint therapy without increasing the risk of toxicity is likely to further extend the benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors to a greater proportion of SCLC patients. Emerging data indicates efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in SCLC including published data from the study of pembrolizumab and nivolumab in relapsed SCLC. However, the efficacy i mpact in unselected patients appears somewhat modest thereby calling for 
strategies to both identify patients likely to benefit and to further enhance the efficacy of the treatment.  
Limited institutional experience and large randomized studies also suggest survival benefit of XRT in SCLC-ED (Ben J. Slotman, 2014; Guy C. Jones, 2014). Moreover, XRT can induce PD-L1 expression on tumor and stromal cells along with increase in myeloid-derived 
suppressor cells (MDSCs) in preclinical models (Deng et al., 2014a; Deng et al., 2014b). Furthermore, the release of tumor -associated antigens following cell death induced by XRT 
may be highly immunogenic (Deng et al., 2014a; Deng et al., 2014b), leading to potent abscopal effect at distant tumor sites (Blanquicett et al.,  2005). The combination of an anti-
PD-L1 inhibitor and XRT was also synergistic in xenograft models of pancreatic, colon and 
breast cancer (Blanquicett et al., 2005; Deng et al., 2014a; Deng et al., 2014b).  
The biologic premise behind the strategy of combining immune modulating agent and XRT is 
the expectation that the tumor -antigen release achieved by localized radiation will activate 
tumor specific adaptive immune response, which can be further enhanced by systemic immune -stimulating agents. Thus, XRT is able to induce local tumor response at the site of 
XRT delivery but also at distant sites through the abscopal effect phenomenon, whereby localized radiation results in immune -mediated tumor regression in disease sites well outside 
of the radiation field ( Tang et al., 2014) . This study will also allow us to demonstrate the 
safety of the combination of irradiation along with combined immune checkpoint blockade. 
As an antibody that blocks the interaction between PD -L1 and its receptors, durvalumab may 
relieve PD -L1-dependent immunosuppressive effects and, therefore, enhance the cytotoxic 
activity of anti- tumor T -cells.  This hypothesis is supported by emerging clinical data from 
other mAbs targeting the PD -L1/PD -1 pathway, which provide early evide nce of clinical 
activity and a manageable safety profile ( Brahmer et  al 2012,).  Responses have been 
observed in patients with PD- L1-positive tumors and patients with PD- L1-negative tumors.  In

addition, durvalumab monotherapy has shown durable responses in NSCLC in Study 1108 
(see Section  1.4.1.1).  
The rationale for combining durvalumab and tremelimumab is that the mechanisms of 
CTLA -4 and PD -1 are non- redundant, suggesting that targeting both pathways may have 
additive or synergistic activity ().  In fact, combining immunotherapy agents has been shown 
to result in improved response rates (RRs) relative to monotherapy.  For example, the 
concurrent administration of nivolumab and ipilimumab to patients with advanced melanoma induced higher objective response rates (ORRs) than those obtained with single -agent therapy.  
Importantly, responses appeared to be deep and durable.  Similar results have been obser ved 
in an ongoing study of durvalumab + tremelimumab in NSCLC, with further updated details 
presented in this clinical study protocol.   The current  study will test whether combined immune checkpoint along with or without XRT 
will confer greater benefit ov er immune checkpoint therapy alone in relapsed SCLC. The 
study design also allows the assessment of the safety of the combination of irradiation along with combined immune checkpoint blockade. 
1.3.1 Durvalumab  + tremelimumab combination therapy dose rationale 
The durvalumab + tremelimumab doses and regimen selected for this study are based on the 
goal of selecting an optimal combination dose of durvalumab and tremelimumab that would 
yield sustained target suppression (sPD -L1), demonstrate promising efficacy, and have an 
acceptable safety profile.   
In order to reduce the dosing frequency of durvalumab to align with the q4w dosing of 
tremelimumab, while ensuring an acceptable PK/PDx, safety, and efficacy profile, cohorts 
were narrowed to 15 and 20 mg/kg durvalumab q4w.  PK simulations from the durvalumab 
monotherapy data indicated that a similar area under the plasma drug concentration- time 
curve at steady state (AUC
ss; 4 weeks) was expected following both 10 mg/kg q2w and 
20 mg/kg q4w durvalumab.  The observed durvalumab PK data from the D4190C00006 study 
were well in line with the predicted monotherapy PK data developed preclinically.  This 
demonstrates similar exposure of durvalumab 20 mg/kg q4w and 10 mg/kg q2w, with no 
alterations in PK when durvalumab and t remelimumab (doses ranging from 1 to 3 mg/kg) are 
dosed together.  While the median C max at steady state (C max,ss) is expected to be higher with 
20 mg/kg q4w (approximately 1.5 fold) and median trough concentration at steady state (C
trough,ss ) is expected to be higher with 10 mg/kg q2w (approximately 1.25 fold), this is not 
expected to impact the overall safety and efficacy profile, based on existing preclinical and 
clinical data.

Monotonic increases in PDx activity were observed with increasing doses of tr emelimumab 
relative to the activity observed in patients treated with durvalumab monotherapy.  There was 
evidence of augmented PDx activity relative to durvalumab monotherapy with combination 
doses containing 1 mg/kg tremelimumab, inclusive of the 15 and 20 mg/kg durvalumab plus 1 
mg/kg tremelimumab combinations.  
Patients treated with doses of tremelimumab above 1  mg/kg had a higher rate of adverse 
events (AEs), including discontinuations due to AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), and severe AEs.  
Between the 10  mg/kg durvalumab + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab and 10  mg/kg Durvalumab  + 
3 mg/kg tremelimumab cohorts treated at the q2w schedule, the number of patients reporting 
any AE, Grade 3 AEs, SAEs, and treatment -related AEs was higher in the 10 mg/kg 
durvalumab + 3 mg/kg tr emelimumab cohort than the 10 mg/kg durvalumab + 1 mg/kg 
tremelimumab cohort.  A similar pattern was noted in the q4w regimens, suggesting that, as 
the dose of tremelimumab increased above 1 mg/kg, a higher rate of treatment -related events 
may be anticipat ed.  Further, the SAEs frequently attributed to immunotherapy, pneumonitis 
and colitis, were more commonly seen in cohorts using either 3 or 10 mg/kg of tremelimumab compared to the 1- mg/kg dose cohorts.  Together, these data suggest that a combination usi ng 
a tremelimumab dose of 1 mg/kg appeared to minimize the rate of toxicity when combined 
with durvalumab.  As a result, all combination doses utilizing either the 3 or 10 mg/kg doses 
of tremelimumab were eliminated in the final dose selection.    
In contra st, cohorts assessing higher doses of durvalumab with a constant dose of 
tremelimumab did not show an increase in the rate of AEs.  The data suggested that increasing doses of durvalumab may not impact the safety of the combination as much as the 
tremelimu mab dose.  Further, safety data between the 10- mg/kg and 20 -mg/kg cohorts were 
similar, with no change in safety events with increasing dose of durvalumab.  
In Study D4190C00006, of all treatment cohorts, the cohort of 11 patients treated in the 
20 mg/kg durvalumab + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab group had the fewest AEs, Grade ≥3 AEs, 
SAEs, and treatment discontinuations due to AEs, but still showed strong evidence of clinical activity.  This cohort had a lower number of treatment -related Grade ≥3 AEs or 
treatment -related SAEs.  No dose- limiting toxicities were reported.   
Preliminary clinical activity of the durvalumab and tremelimumab combination did not appear 
to change with increasing doses of tremelimumab.  The 15- and 20 -mg/kg durvalumab q4w 
cohorts demonstrated objective responses at all doses of tremelimumab, and increasing doses of tremelimumab did not provide deeper or more rapid responses. 
Efficacy data suggested that the 20  mg/kg durvalumab + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab dose cohort 
may dem onstrate equivalent clinical activity to other dose combinations.  A total of 5 of

11 patients in the 20 mg/kg durvalumab + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab cohort were evaluable for 
efficacy with at least 8 weeks of follow -up.  Of these, there were 2 patients (40%) w ith partial 
response (PR), 1 patient (20%) with stable disease (SD), and 1 patient (20%) with progressive 
disease (PD).  (The fifth patient had only a single scan, which was conducted outside the 
window for these evaluations.) 
Additionally, of all cohorts, the 20 mg/kg durvalumab + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab dose cohort 
had the fewest AEs, Grade ≥3 AEs, SAEs, and treatment discontinuations due to AEs, but still 
showed some evidence of clinical activity.  All together, the data suggested that a 20 mg/kg durvalumab + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab dose combination should be selected for further 
development.   
1.3.2 Rationale for 4 cycles of combination therapy followed by durvalumab  
monotherapy 
Long -term follow up on melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab, an anti- CTLA -4 
target ing antibody (dosed every 3 weeks [q3w] for 4 doses and then discontinued), shows that 
patients responding to ipilimumab derive long -term benefit, with a 3 -year OS rate of 
approximately 22%.  Furthermore, the survival curve in this population reached a pla teau at 
3 years and was maintained through 10 years of follow up.  
Similar data have been presented for other anti -PD-1/PD- L1 targeting antibodies:  
Nivolumab (anti -PD-1) was dosed q2w for up to 96 weeks in a large Phase  I dose -escalation 
and expansion study, and showed responses were maintained for a median of 22.94 months 
for melanoma (doses 0.1 mg/kg to 10  mg/kg), 17 months for NSCLC (doses 1, 3, and 
10 mg/kg), and 12.9 months for renal cell carcinoma patients (doses 1 and 10 mg/kg) at the time of data a nalysis ( Hodi et  al 2014, Brahmer et  al 2014, Drake et  al 2013).  Furthermore, 
responses were maintained beyond treatment discontinuation in the majority of patients who stopped nivolumab treatment (either due to protocol specified end of treatment, complete response [CR], or toxicity) for up to 56 weeks at the time of data analysis.  
MPDL3280a (anti -PD-L1) and the combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab, in which 
patients were dosed for a finite time period and responses maintained beyond treatment discontinuation have been reported ( Herbst  et al 2013). 
Similar long term results may be expected with use of other immune -mediated cancer 
therapeutics including anti- CTLA -4 antibodies such as tremelimumab, anti PD -L1 antibodies 
such as durvalumab, or the combination of the two.

1.4 Benef it/risk and ethical assessment  
Patients with relapsed SCLC have limited therapeutic options. Topotecan is the only approved 
therapy in this setting and is associated with a meager response rate of ~10% in unselected 
patients. The combination of inhibitors targeting PD1 and CTLA4 signaling pathways have 
been established to be safe. Moreover, this combination appears quite promising in early phase testing with response rate of >30%. Therefore, the risk- benefit balance is positive 
overall for the proposed stud y.  
1.4.1 Potential benefits  
1.4.1.1 Durvalumab 
The majority of the safety and efficacy data currently available for durvalumab are based on 
the first time in -human, single -agent study (Study 1108) in patients with advanced solid 
tumors.  Data from Study 1108 were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology 
2014 Congress.  Overall, 456 of 694 subjects treated with durva lumab  10 mg/kg Q2W were 
evaluable for response (defined as having ≥ 24  weeks follow -up, measurable disease at 
baseline, and ≥ 1 follow- up scan, or discontinued due to disease progression or death without 
any follow -up scan). In PD -L1 unselected patients, t he objective response rate (ORR), based 
on investigator assessment per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, 
ranged from 0% in uveal melanoma (n = 23) to 20.0% in bladder cancer (n = 15), and disease control rate at 24  weeks (DCR -24w) ranged from 4.2% in triple -negative breast cancer 
(TNBC; n = 24) to 39.1% in advanced cutaneous melanoma (n = 23). PD -L1 status was 
known for 383 of the 456 response evaluable subjects. Across the PD -L1-positive tumors, 
ORR was highest for bladder cancer,  advanced cutaneous melanoma, hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC; n = 3 each, 33.3% each), NSCLC (n = 86, 26.7%), and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN; n = 22, 18.2%). In the PD -L1-positive subset, 
DCR -24w was highest in advanced cutaneous melanoma (n = 3, 66.7%), NSCLC (n = 86, 
36.0%), HCC and bladder cancer (n = 3 each, 33.3% each), and SCCHN (n = 22, 18.2%). (Antonia et al 2014b).    
1.4.1.2 Tremelimumab  
In a single -arm, Phase II study (Study  A3671008) of tremelimumab administered at 15 mg/kg 
every 90  days to patients with refractory melanoma, an RR of 7% and a median OS of 
10 months in the second- line setting (as compared to approximately 6  mont hs with best 
supportive care reported from a retrospective analysis; Korn et al 2008) were observed 
(Kirkwood et  al 2010 ).  In a randomized, open- label, first- line Phase III study of 
tremelimumab (administered at 15  mg/kg every 90  days) versus chemotherapy (dacarbazine or 
temozolomide) in advanced m elanoma (Study  A3671009), results of the final analysis showed

an RR of 11% and a median OS of 12.58 months in this first- line setting as compared to 
10.71 months with standard chemotherapy; however, these results were not statistically 
significant .  Addi tionally, a Phase II maintenance study (Study A3671015) in patients with 
Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC who had responded or remained stable failed to achieve statistical significance.  The primary endpoint of PFS at 3 months was 22.7% in the tremelimumab arm 
(15 mg/kg) compared with 11.9% in the best supportive care arm (Study A3671015).   
1.4.1.3 Durvalumab + tremelimumab  
The preclinical and clinical justification for this combination as noted in Section 1.1.4 also 
supports the synergy of this combination.  Available data, such as those presented by 
Wolchok et al, suggest that the combination of agents targeting PD -1/PD- L1 and CTLA -4 
may have profound and durable benefits in patients with melanoma.  Of the 102 subjects with 
advanced NSCLC treated with durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab in Study 
D4190C00006, 63 subjects with at least 16 weeks of follow -up were evaluable for response 
(defined as measurable disease at baseline and at least 1 follow -up scan ; this included 
discontinuations due to disease progression or death without follow -up scan). Of the 63 
evaluable subjects, 17 (27%) had a best overall response of PR, 14 (22%) had SD, 22 (35%) had PD, and 10 (16%) were not evaluable. The ORR (confirmed and unconfirmed CR or PR) 
was 27% and the DCR (CR, PR, or SD) was 49% as assessed by RECIST v1.1. 
Current experience with single -agent IMT studies suggests that clinical responses may be 
restricted to a subset of any given patient population and that it might be beneficial to enrich 
the patient population by selecting patients likely to respond to therapy.  To date, no assay has 
been established or validated, and no single approach has proven accurate, for patient 
enrichment for IMTs.  However, independent data from multiple sources using different assays and scoring methods suggests that PD -L1 expression on tumor cells and/or tumor 
infiltrating cells may be associated with greater clinical benefit.  
Data from ongoing studies with durvalumab and other agent s targeting the PD -1/PD- L1 
pathway suggest, as shown in a number of tumor types ( e.g., NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma, 
and melanoma), that monotherapy may be more efficacious (in terms of ORR) in patients who are PD -L1-positive.  
Given these findings, a numbe r of ongoing studies are assessing the activity of agents in 
patients with PD -L1–positive tumors.  There is also an unmet medical need in patients with 
PD-L1–negative tumors that needs to be addressed.  Data, as of 27 January  2015 from 
Study 006 show that with the addition of tremelimumab to durvalumab, the ORR can be 
increased to 25% in patients with PD -L1 negative NSCLC.  As patients with PD -L1 positive 
disease can also have an increase in ORR, from 25% with durvalumab monotherapy, to 36%

with the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab, the study will enroll all patients with 
NSCLC, with an emphasis on those determined to be PD-L1 negative.   
1.4.2 Potential risks  
1.4.2.1 Durvalumab 
Potential risks, based on the mechanism of action of durvalumab and related molecule s, 
include immune -mediated reactions, such as enterocolitis, dermatitis, hepatitis/hepatotoxicity, 
endocrinopathy, pneumonitis, and neuropathy or neurologic events.  Additional important 
potential risks include infusion- related reactions, hypersensitivity,  anaphylaxis or serious 
allergic reactions, serious infections, and immune complex disease.   
Study CD -ON-durvalumab-1108: The safety profile of durvalumab monotherapy in the 
694 subjects with advanced solid tumors treated at 10 mg/kg Q2W in Study 
CD-ON-durvalumab -1108 has been broadly consistent with that of the overall 1,279 subjects 
who have received durvalumab monotherapy (not including subjects treated with blinded investigational product) across the clinical development program. The majority of treatm ent-
related AEs were manageable with dose delays, symptomatic treatment, and in the case of events suspected to have an immune basis, the use of established treatment guidelines for 
immune -mediated toxicity. As of 07May2015, among the  694 subjects treated with 
durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W in Study CD -ON-durvalumab- 1108, a total of 378 subjects 
(54.5%) experienced a treatment -related AE, with the most frequent (occurring in ≥ 5% of 
subjects) being fatigue (17.7%), nausea (8.6%), diarrhea (7.3%), decreased appetit e (6.8%), 
pruritus (6.3%), rash (6.1%), and vomiting (5.0%). A majority of the treatment -related AEs 
were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity with ≥  Grade 3 events occurring in 65 subjects (9.4%). 
Treatment -related ≥  Grade 3 events reported in 3 or more subject s (≥ 0.4%) were fatigue 
(12 subjects, 1.7%); increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST; 7 subjects, 1.0%); increased 
gamma -glutamyltransferase (GGT; 6  subjects, 0.9%); increased alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT; 5 subjects, 0.7%); and colitis, vomiting, decre ased appetite, and hyponatremia 
(3 subjects, 0.4% each). Six  subjects had treatment -related Grade 4 AEs (upper 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage, increased AST, dyspnea, neutropenia, colitis, diarrhea, and 
pneumonitis) and 1 subject had a treatment -related Grade 5 event (pneumonia). Treatment -
related serious adverse events (SAEs) that occurred in ≥ 2 subjects were colitis and pneumonitis (3 subjects each). A majority of the treatment -related SAEs were ≥ Grade 3 in 
severity and resolved with or without sequelae. A Es that resulted in permanent discontinuation 
of durvalumab were considered as treatment related in 18  subjects (2.6%), with colitis being 
the most frequent treatment -related AE resulting in discontinuation (3 subjects). A majority of

Study D4191C00003/ATLANTIC: The safety profile of durvalumab monotherapy in 
Study CD -ON-durvalumab- 1108 is generally consistent with that of 
Study D4191C00003/ATLANTIC in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic non- small-
cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  treated with durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W. As of 05May2015, 264 of 
303 subjects (87.1%) reported any AE in Study D4191C00003/ATLANTIC. Overall, events 
reported in ≥ 10% of subjects were dyspnea (18.8%), fatigue (17.8%), decreased appetite 
(17.5%), cough (14.2%), pyrexia (12.2%), asthenia (11.9%), and nausea (11.2%). Nearly two -
thirds of the subjects experienced AEs that were Grade 1 or 2 in severity and manageable by 
general treatment guidelines as d escribed in the current durvalumab study protocols. Grade 3 
or higher AEs were reported in 107 of 303 subjects (35.3%). A total of 128 subjects (42.2%) reported AEs that were considered by the investigator as related to investigational product. 
Treatment -related AEs (all grades) reported in ≥ 2% of subjects were decreased appetite 
(6.6%); fatigue (5.9%); asthenia (5.0%); nausea (4.6%); pruritus (4.3%); diarrhea, 
hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and pyrexia (3.3% each); rash (2.6%); weight decreased 
(2.3%); and vomiting (2.0%). Treatment -related Grade 3 AEs reported in ≥  2 subjects were 
pneumonitis (3 subjects) and increased GGT (2 subjects). There was no treatment -related 
Grade 4 or 5 AEs. Ninety -four of 303 subjects (31.0%) reported any SAE. SAEs that occurred 
in ≥ 1.0% of subjects were dyspnea (6.6%); pleural effusion, general physical health deterioration (2.3% each); pneumonia (2.0%); hemoptysis, pulmonary embolism (1.3% each); 
and pneumonitis, respiratory failure, disease progression (1.0% each). Nine subjects had an SAE considered by the investigator as related to durvalumab. Each treatment -related SAE 
occurred in 1 subject each with the exception of pneumonitis, which occurred in 3 subjects. Fifteen of 303 subjects (5.0%) have died due to an AE (pneumonia [3 subjects]; general physical health deterioration, disease progression, hemoptysis, dyspnea [2 subjects each]; pulmonary sepsis, respiratory distress, cardiopulmonary arrest [verbatim term (VT)], hepatic 
failure, and sepsis [1 subject each]). None of these events was considered related to 
durvalumab. Twenty -three of 303 subjects (7.6%) permanently discontinued durvalumab  
treatment due to AEs. Events that le d to discontinuation of durvalumab in ≥ 2 subjects  were 
dyspnea, general physical health deterioration, and pneumonia. Treatment -related AEs that led 
to discontinuation were increased ALT and increased hepatic enzyme, which occurred in 1 subject each.

1.4.2.2 Tremelimumab  
Potential risks, based on the mechanism of action of tremelimumab and related molecules 
(ipilimumab) include potentially immune -mediated gastrointestinal (GI) events including 
enterocolitis, intestinal perforation, abdominal pain, dehydration, nausea and vomiting, and decreased appetite (anorexia); dermatitis including urticaria, skin exfoliation, and dry skin; 
endocrinopathies including hypophysitis, adrenal insufficiency, and hyperthyroidism and 
hypothyroidism; hepatitis including autoimmune hepatitis and  increased serum ALT and AST; 
pancreatitis including autoimmune pancreatitis and lipase and amylase elevation; respiratory tract events including pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease (ILD); nervous system events 
including encephalitis, peripheral motor and sensory neuropathies, and Guillain- Barré 
syndrome; cytopenias including thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia; infusion- related 
reactions; anaphylaxis; and serious allergic reactions.  The profile of AEs and the spectrum of 
event severity have remained stable across the tremelimumab clinical program and are 
consistent with the pharmacology of the target.  To date, no tumor type or stage appears to be 
associated with unique AEs (except for vitiligo that appears to be confined to patients with melan oma).  Overall, 944 of the 973 patients (97.0%) treated with tremelimumab 
monotherapy as of the data cutoff date of 12 November 2014 (for all studies except 
D4190C00006 that has a cutoff date of 04 December 2014 and not including 497 patients who 
have been  treated in the ongoing blinded Phase IIb Study D4880C00003) experienced at least 
1 AE.  The events resulted in discontinuation of tremelimumab in 10.0% of patients, were serious in 36.5%, were Grade ≥3 in severity in 49.8%, were fatal in 67.7%, and were 
considered to be treatment related in 79.1% of patients.  The frequency of any AEs and 
Grade ≥3 AEs was generally similar across the tremelimumab dose groups.  However, a 
higher percentage of patients in the 10 mg/kg every 28 days and 15 mg/kg every 90 days  
groups compared with the All Doses <10 mg/kg group experienced treatment -related AEs, 
SAEs, AEs resulting in discontinuation of investigational product (IP), and deaths.   
1.4.2.3 Durvalumab + tremelimumab  
No safety studies in animals have been performed combining tremelimumab with durvalumab .  
As both CTLA -4 and PD -L1 have mechanisms of actions that enhance activation of immune 
cells, their potential to induce cytokine release was tested in a whole -blood assay system.  
Durvalumab and tremelimumab, either alone or  in combination, did not induce cytokine 
release in blood from any donor. 
Study D4190C00006: The safety profile of durvalumab and tremelimumab combination 
therapy in the 102 subjects with advanced NSCLC in Study D4190C00006 is generally 
consistent with tha t observed across 177 subjects treated with Durvalumab and tremelimumab 
combination therapy (not including subjects treated with blinded investigational product). As 
of 15Apr2015, 95 of 102 subjects (93.1%) reported at least 1 AE. All subjects in the

treme limumab 3 and 10 mg/kg dose cohorts experienced AEs; subjects in the durvalumab 
20 mg/kg and tremelimumab 1 mg/kg Q4W cohort experienced the lowest AE rate (77.8%). 
Treatment -related AEs were reported in 74 of 102 subjects (72.6%), with events occurring in  
> 10% of subjects being diarrhea (27.5%), fatigue (22.5%), increased amylase and pruritus (14.7% each), rash (12.7%), colitis (11.8%), and increased lipase (10.8%). Treatment -related 
≥ Grade 3 AEs reported in ≥ 5% of subjects were colitis (8.8%), diarrhea (7.8%), and 
increased lipase (5.9%). Five subjects reported treatment -related Grade 4 events (sepsis, 
increased ALT, and increased AST in 1 subject; increased amylase in 2 subjects; myasthenia gravis in 1 subject; and pericardial effusion in 1 subject) and 2 subjects had treatment -related 
Grade 5 events (polymyositis and an uncoded event of neuromuscular disorder [VT]); the Grade 4 event of myasthenia gravis and Grade 5 polymyositis occurred in 1 subject. There were 2  subjects (both in the MEDI4736 20 mg/k g + tremelimumab 3 mg/kg Q4W cohort) with 
dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs): 1 subject with Grade 3 increased AST, and 1 subject with 
Grade 3 increased amylase and Grade 4 increased lipase. Fifty -six subjects (54.9%) reported 
SAEs, with events occurring in >  5% of subjects being colitis (9.8%) and diarrhea (7.8%). 
Thirty -six subjects (35.3%) experienced treatment -related SAEs. Twenty -seven subjects 
(26.5%) permanently discontinued treatment due to AEs. Treatment -related AEs resulting in 
discontinuation in ≥ 2 subjects were colitis (7 subjects), pneumonitis (5 subjects), diarrhea (3 
subjects), and increased AST (2 subjects). Additional safety results from this study are 
presented in Section  1.3.1 and the durvalumab IB.  
In the literature, using the combination of the same class of drugs ( e.g., anti -PD-1 and anti -
CTLA4 antibodies), specifically nivolumab + ipilimumab in a study involving patients with malig nant melanoma, the safety profile of this combination had shown occurrences of AEs 
assessed by the Investigator as treatment -related in 93% of treated patients, with the most 
frequent events being rash (55% of patients), pruritus (47% of patients), fatigue  (38% of 
patients), and diarrhea (34% of patients).  Grade 3 or 4 AEs, regardless of causality, were 
noted in 72% of patients, with Grade 3 or 4 events assessed by the Investigator as treatment -
related in 53%.  The most frequent of these Grade 3 or 4 event s assessed by the Investigator as 
treatment -related include increased lipase (in 13% of patients), AST (in 13%), and ALT levels 
(in 11%).  Frequent Grade 3 or 4 selected AEs assessed by the Investigator as treatment -
related in the combination therapy inclu ded hepatic events (in 15%  of patients), GI events (in 
9%), and renal events (in 6%).  Isolated cases of pneumonitis and uveitis were also observed.   
1.4.2.4 Fixed Dosing for durvalumab and tremelimumab  
A population PK model was developed for durvalumab using monotherapy data from a Phase 
1 study ( study 1108; N=292; doses= 0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W or 15 mg/kg Q3W; solid tumors ). 
Population PK analysis indicated only minor impact of body weight (WT) on PK of 
durvalumab (coefficient of ≤ 0.5). The impact of body WT-ba sed (10 mg/kg Q2W) and fixed 
17 
 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Investigational Drug Substance: Durvalumab and Tremelimumab  
Study Number ESR-14-10531 /WINSHIP3112- 15; Edition Number 3.1; Date 09/16/2016 
 
dosing (750 mg Q2W) of durvalumab was evaluated by comparing predicted steady state PK 
concentrations (5th, median and 95th percentiles) using the population PK model. A fixed dose 
of 750 mg was selected to approximate 10 mg/kg  (based on median body WT of ~75 kg). A 
total of 1000 patients were simulated using body WT distribution of 40 –120 kg. Simulation 
results demonstrate that body WT -based and fixed dosing regimens yield similar median 
steady state PK concentrations with slig htly less overall between -subject variability with fixed 
dosing regimen.   
 Similarly, a population PK model was developed for tremelimumab using data from Phase 1 
through Phase 3 ( N=654; doses= 0.01 to 15 mg/kg Q4W or Q90D; metastatic melanoma) 
[Wang et al. 2014]. Population PK model indicated minor impact of body WT on PK of 
tremelimumab (coefficient of ≤ 0.5). The WT-based (1 mg/kg Q4W) and fixed dosing (75 
mg/kg Q4W; based on median body WT of ~75 kg) regimens were compared using predicted 
PK concentrat ions ( 5
th, median and 95th percentiles ) using population PK model in a simulated 
population of 1000 patients with body weight distribution of 40 to 120 kg. Similar to durvalumab, simulations indicated that both body WT -based and fixed dosing regimens of 
tremelimumab yield similar median steady state PK concentrations with slightly less between -
subject variability with fixed dosing regimen .  
 Similar findings have been reported by others [Ng et al 2006, Wang et al. 2009, Zhang et al, 2012, Narwal  et al 2013]. Wang and colleagues investigated 12 monoclonal antibodies and 
found that fixed and body size -based dosing perform similarly, with fixed dosing being  better 
for 7 of 12 antibodies . In addition, they investigated 18 therapeutic proteins and peptides and showed that fixed dosing performed better for 12 of 18 in terms of reducing the between -
subject variability in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics parameters [ Zhang et al 2012].  
 
A fixed dosing approach is preferred by the prescribing community due to ease of use and 
reduced dosing errors. Given expectation of similar pharmacokinetic exposure and variability, we considered it feasible to switch to fixed dosing regimens. Based on average body WT of 75 kg, a fixed dose of 1500 mg Q4W durvalumab  (equivalent to 20 mg/kg Q4W) and 75 mg 
Q4W tremelimumab (equivalent to 1 mg/kg Q4W) is included in the current study.   Fixed dosing of durvalumab and tremelimumab is recommended  only for subje cts with > 30kg 
body weight due to endotoxin exposure.  Patients with a body weight less than or equal to 30 
kg should be dosed using a weight-based dosing schedule.

3. STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 Overview of study design  
This is a prospective, proof-of-concept, 2-cohort clinical trial in relapsed SCLC. Consenting 
patients who have failed frontline platinum-based chemotherapy, with good performance status (0 -2 on ECOG scale) and adequate end -organ function will be enrolled. Ten patients 
will be enrolled in Arm I and will be treated with Durvalumab and Tremelimumab combination every 4 weeks for 4 doses followed by single agent Durvalumab every 4 weeks  
for up to 1 year or until disease progression. Arm II patients will first undergo XRT (up to 30Gy in 3-5 fractions) to a known site of disease involvement prior to starting systemic treatment. This will be followed by systemic therapy similar to Arm I consisting of Durvalumab and Tremelimumab combination for 4 doses and then single agent Durvalumab for up to 1 year or until disease progression with tremelimumab and Durvalumab. Patients who continue to derive benefit from treatment with the Durvalumab/Tremelimumab combination may be a llowed to continue treatment with single agent durvalumab for up to 2 
years in the absence of intolerable toxicity or disease  progression.

Study Number ESR-14-10531 /WINSHIP3112- 15; Edition Number 3.1; Date 09/16/2016 
 
This design enables us to assess the clinical efficacy of combined immune checkpoint 
treatment (Arm I and II pooled); to establish the safety of sequential combination of immune 
checkpoint inhibitors and XRT (Arm II) and also to explore the priming effect of XRT on immune checkpoint therapy (Arm I vs II). 
All enrolled patients will have a baseline plasma sample for circulating tumor free DNA 
(ctfDNA) to measure disease burden and antigen release, as well as a tumor biopsy for assessment of PD -L1 expression and to characterize the phenotype of the tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TILs). A repeat ctfDNA sample will b e collected at the end of radiation 
treatment (Arm II only) . Repeat tumor biopsy will be obtained at the end of cycle 2 for all 
patients  in both arms of the study . These samples will be employed to characterize the same 
endpoints of tumor burden, PD- L1 exp ression and TILs with comparison of immune cell 
repertoire between responding and non responding patients.  
Treatment with durvalumab will continue for up to 1 year in the absence of toxicity or disease 
progression in all patients. Treatment may be extended for another year if continuing clinical 
benefit in the patient and there are no safety concerns. Restagi ng scans will be obtained after every 2 cycles of therapy (for the first 6 months) and 
every 3 cycles thereafter.

Investigational Drug Substance: Durvalumab and Tremelimumab  
Study Number ESR-14-10531 /WINSHIP3112- 15; Edition Number 3.1; Date 09/16/2016 
 
Week 17 for up to 8 months (9 doses) (see Figure 2).  Dosing outside the window should be 
discussed with the Study Physician.  Tremelimumab will be administered first.  Durvalumab 
infusion will  start approximately 1 hour after the end of tremelimumab infusion.  The duration 
will be approximately 1 hour for each infusion.  A 1- hour observation period is required after 
the first infusion of durvalumab and tremelimumab.  If no clinically significant infusion 
reactions are observed during or after the first cycle, subsequent infusion observation periods 
can be at the Investigator’s discretion (suggested 30 minutes after each durvalumab and 
tremelimumab infusion).   
5.2.2 Duration of treatment and criteria for retreatment  
For patients receiving  durvalumab + tremelimumab , retreatment is allowed (once only) for 
patients meeting the retreatment criteria below.  The same treatment guidelines followed 
during the init ial 12 -month treatment period will be followed during the retreatment period, 
including the same dose and frequency of treatments and the same schedule of assessments.   
Patients receiving  the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab may undergo 
retreatment in 2 clinical scenarios, described below:    
1. Patients who achieve and maintain disease control ( i.e., CR, PR, or SD) through to the 
end of the 12- month treatment period may restart treatment with the combination upon 
evidence of PD, with or without confirmation according to RECIST 1.1, during 
follow-up.  
2. Patients who complete the 4 dosing cycles of the combination of durvalumab and 
tremelimumab portion of the regimen (with clinical benefit per Investigator judgment), 
but subsequently have evidence of PD during the durvalumab monotherapy portion of 
the combination regimen, with or without confirmation according to RECIST 1.1, may 
restart treatment with the combination.   
3. For the  durvalumab + tremelimumab treatment group, before restarting their assigned 
treatment, the Investigator should ensure that the patient:   
a. Does not have any significant, unacceptable, or irreversible toxicities that indicate continuing treatment will not further benefit the patient  
b. Still fulfils the eligibility criteria for this stud y, including re -consenting to 
restart durvalumab and tremelimumab  
c. Has not have received an intervening systemic anticancer therapy after their assigned treatment discontinuation .

Study Number ESR-14-10531 /WINSHIP3112- 15; Edition Number 3.1; Date 09/16/2016 
 
d. Has had a baseline tumor assessment within 28 days of restarting their assigned 
treatment; all further scans should occur with the same frequency as during the 
initial 12 months of treatment (relative to the date of randomization) until study treatment is stopped (maximum of 12 months of further treatment).   
During the retreatment period, patients receiving durvalumab + tremelimumab  may resume 
durvalumab dosing at 1500 mg q4w with 75 mg  of tremelimumab q4w for 4 doses each.  
Patients will then continue with durvalumab monotherapy at 1500 mg q4w, beginning at 
Week 16, 4 weeks after the last dose of combination therapy (a total of 9 additional doses).   
Treatment through progression is at the Investigator’s discretion, and the Investigator should 
ensure that patients do not have any significant, unacceptable, or irreversible toxicities that 
indicate that continuing treatment will not further benefit the patient.  A patient with a 
confirmed progression receiving durvalumab  + tremelimumab cannot  continue therapy or 
obtain retreatment if dosing is ongoing in the combination portion of therapy (q4w dosing) 
and progression occurs in a target lesion that has previously shown a confirmed response. 
Patients will be required to provide written consent prior to restarting treatment or continuation of treatment in the presence of radiologic progression of disease,. 
Patients who AstraZeneca and/or the Sponsor- Investigator determine may not continue  
treatment will enter follow -up.   
5.2.3 Study drug preparation of durvalumab and tremelimumab  
Based on average body weight  of 75 kg, a fixed dose of 1500 mg Q4W durvalumab  
(equivalent to 20 mg/kg Q4W) and 75 mg Q4W tremelimumab (equivalent to 1 mg/kg Q4W) 
is included in the current study.  
Preparation of durvalumab doses for administration with an IV bag 
The dose of durvalumab for administration must be prepared by the Inve stigator’s or site’s 
designated IP manager using aseptic technique.  Total time from needle puncture of the 
durvalumab vial to the start of administration should not exceed:  
• 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) 
• 4 hours at room temperature 
If in-use stora ge time exceeds these limits, a new dose must be prepared from new vials. 
Infusion solutions must be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature prior to commencement 
of administration.

Study Number ESR-14-10531 /WINSHIP3112- 15; Edition Number 3.1; Date 09/16/2016 
 
No incompatibilities between durvalumab and polyvinylchloride or polyolefin IV bags have 
been observed. Dose of 1500mg durvalumab for patients >30 kg will be administered using an 
IV bag containing 0.9% (w/v) saline, with a final durvalumab concentration ranging from 1 to 20 mg/mL, and delivered through an IV administration set with a 0.2- or 0.22- μm in -line 
filter.   Remove 30.0 mL of IV solution from the IV bag prior to addition of 
durvalumab.  Next, 30.0 mL of durvalumab ( i.e., 1500 mg of durvalumab) is added to the IV 
bag such that final concentration is within 1 to 20 mg/mL (IV bag volumes 100 to 1000 mL).   Mix the bag by gently inverting to ensure homogeneity of the dose in the bag. 
Patient weight at baseline should be used for dosing calculations unless there is a 
≥10% change in weight.  Dosing day weight can be used for  dosing calculations instead of 
baseline weight per institutional standard.   
For patients <30kg, Calculate the dose volume of durvalumab and tremelimumab and number 
of vials needed for the subject to achieve the accurate dose.  
Durvalumab will be administe red at room temperature (approximately 25°C) by controlled 
infusion via an infusion pump into a peripheral or central vein. Following preparation of 
durvalumab, the entire contents of the IV bag should be administered as an IV infusion over 
approximately 60 minutes (±5 minutes), using a 0.2, or 0.22- μm in -line filter. Less than 55 
minutes is considered a deviation. The IV line will be flushed with a volume of IV solution (0.9% [w/v] saline  equal to the 
priming volume of the infusion set used after the contents of the IV bag are fully administered, or complete the infusion according to institutional policy to ensure the full dose is 
administered and document if the line was not flushed. 
Standard infusion time is 1 hour.  However, if there are interruptions during infusion, the total 
allowed time should not exceed 8 hours at room temperature.  The table below summarizes time allowances and temperatures.  
Durvalumab hold and infusion times  
Maximum time from needle puncture to start of 
administration  4 hours at room temperature, 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C 
Maximum time for IV bag infusion, including

In the event that either preparation time or infusion time exceeds the time limits outlined in 
the table, a new dose must be prepared from new vials.  Durvalumab does not contain 
preservatives, and any unused portion must be discarded. 
Preparation of tremelimumab doses for adminis tration with an IV bag  
The dose of tremelimumab for administration must be prepared by the Investigator’s or site’s 
designated IP manager using aseptic technique.  Total time from needle puncture of the 
tremelimumab vial to the start of administration shou ld not exceed:  
• 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) 
• 4 hours at room temperature 
It is recommended that the prepared final IV bag be stored in the dark at 2ºC -8°C (36°F -46°F) 
until needed. If storage time exceeds these limits, a new dose must be prepared from new 
vials. The refrigerated infusion solutions in the prepared final IV bag should be equilibrated at room temperature for about 2 hours prior to administration. Tremelimumab does not contain 
preservatives and any unused portion must be discarded. 
No incompatibilities between tremelimumab and polyvinylchloride or polyolefin IV bags have 
been observed. Doses of 75 mg tremelimumab for patients >30 kg will be administered using 
an IV bag containing 0.9% (w/v) saline, with a final tremelimumab concentratio n ranging 
from 0.1 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL, and delivered through an IV administration set with a 0.2 μm 
or 0.22 μm in- line filter. Remove 3.8 mL of IV solution from the IV bag prior to addition of 
tremelimumab.   Next, 3.8 mL of tremelimumab ( i.e., 75 mg of tremelimumab) is added to the 
IV bag such that final concentration is within 0.1 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL (IV bag volumes 50 to 
500 mL).  Mix the bag by gently inverting to ensure homogeneity of the dose in the bag. 
Patient weight at baseline should be used for dosing calculations unless there is a 
≥10% change in weight.  Dosing day weight can be used for dosing calculations instead of 
baseline weight per institutional standard.   
For patients <30 kg, Calculate the dose volume for tremelimumab and number of vials needed 
for subject to achieve the accurate dose.  
Tremelimumab will be administered at room temperature (approximately 25°C) by controlled 
infusion via an infusion pump into a peripheral  or central  vein. Following preparation of 
tremelimumab , the entire contents of the IV bag should be administered as an IV infusion over 
approximately 60 minutes (±5 minutes), using a 0.2, or 0.22- μm in -line filter. Less than 55 
minutes is considered a dev iation.

In the event that either preparation time or infusion time exceeds the time limits outlined in 
the table, a new dose must be prepared from new vials.  Tremelimumab does not contain 
preservatives, and any unused portion must be discarded. 
5.2.4 Monitoring of dose administration 
Patients will be monitored during and after the infusion with assessment of vital signs at the 
times specified in the Study Protocol.  
In the event of a ≤Grade 2 infusion- related reaction, the infusion rate of study drug ma y be 
decreased by 50% or interrupted until resolution of the event and re -initiated at 50% of the 
initial rate until completion of the infusion.   For patients with a ≤Grade 2 infusion- related 
reaction, subsequent infusions may be administered at 50% of the  initial rate.   Acetaminophen 
and/or an antihistamine ( e.g., diphenhydramine) or equivalent medications per institutional 
standard may be administered at the discretion of the investigator.  If the infusion- related 
reaction is ≥Grade 3 or higher in severity, study drug will be discontinued. 
As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible.   Appropriate 
drugs and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions must be immediately 
available, and study personnel must be trai ned to recognize and treat anaphylaxis.   The study 
site must have immediate access to emergency resuscitation teams and equipment in addition to the ability to admit patients to an intensive care unit if necessary  
5.2.5 Accountability and dispensation 
The study drug provided for this study will be used only as directed in the study protocol. The IDS personnel will account for all study drugs. Drug accountability should be performed until

the patient stops study treatment completely. Study site personnel will acco unt for all study 
drugs received at the site.  
5.2.6 Disposition of unused investigational study drug  
All unused study drugs will be destroyed on site according to standard practice employed by 
the IDS for appropriate destruction of study drugs. The site will acc ount for all investigational 
study drug dispensed and also for appropriate destruction.  Certificates of delivery and destruction must be signed. 
5.3 Radiation Treatment  
Patients in Arm II will receive palliative radiation (up to 30 Gy given as 5 fractions of 6 Gy 
administered daily for 1 week or 27 Gy given as 3 fractions of 9 Gy administered every other 
day for 1 week). Additional fractionation will be allowed based on site of lesion provided total 
radiation dose is completed within 1 week. The lesion selecte d for radiation will be safe for 
focal irradiation and medically appropriate for palliative doses of radiation. The target dose 
for a patient should conform to the normal tissue requirements in accord with standard 
radiation oncology practice. 
6. TREATMENT PL AN 
6.1 Subject enrollment and randomization  
Eligible patients who have satisfied all the required inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to Arm I or Arm II of the study. Patients in Arm I will receive systemic antibody 
therapy without preceding t reatment with XRT while patients in Arm II will first receive 
priming  radiation to a known site of disease involvement separate from the designated target 
lesions to be used for response assessment.  
Radiation therapy will be delivered using standard XRT technique as deemed appropriate for 
the patient status and location of tumor. Treatment will be delivered within  a week of 
randomization.  
 
6.1.1 Procedures for randomization   
Block randomization method will be used to assign patients randomly to the two groups. The 
block size of randomization is 2 to guarantee that each group will have equal number of 10 patients.

6.3 Dosage and Administration  
Durvalumab (1500 mg durvalumab via IV infusion) + tremelimumab (75 mg tremelimumab 
via IV infusion) combination therapy will be administered to patients in Arm I and Arm II 
once every 4 weeks for up to 4 doses/cycles. Each 4- week interval is considered a cycle. 
Patients in Arm I will only receive the combination o f Durvalumab and Tremelimumab while 
those randomized to Arm II will receive radiation treatment prior to starting treatment with 
Durvalumab/Tremelimumab. Following completion of 4 cycles of combination therapy, 
patients in both arms will continue 1500 mg durvalumab q4w starting on Week 16 for up to 8 
months (9 doses) for a total of 1 year.  Dosing outside the window should be discussed with 
the Study Physician.  Tremelimumab will be administered first.  Durvalumab infusion will 
start approximately 1 hour after the end of tremelimumab infusion.  The duration will be approximately 1 hour for each infusion.  A 1- hour observation period is required after the first 
infusion of durvalumab and tremelimumab.  If no clinically significant infusion reactions are obser ved during or after the first cycle, subsequent infusion observation periods can be at the 
Investigator’s discretion (suggested 30 minutes after each durvalumab and tremelimumab 
infusion).   
Refer to Section 5.1.2, 5.1.3, and 5.2.4 for the administration and monitoring of administration 
of durvalumab and tremelimumab. Refer to Section 5.3 for radiation treatment administration 
for patients in Arm II.

6.6 Dose Modification and Toxicity Management  
• Appropriate drugs and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions must be 
immediately available, and study personnel must be trained to recognize and treat 
anaphylaxis.  
• The study site must have immediate access to emerg ency resuscitation teams and 
equipment in addition to the ability to admit patients to an intensive care unit if necessary.  
6.6.1 Durvalumab and tremelimumab 
For adverse events (AEs) that are considered at least partly due to administration of 
durvalumab the following dose adjustment guidance may be applied:

Investigational Drug Substance: Durvalumab and Tremelimumab  
Study Number ESR-14-10531 /WINSHIP3112- 15; Edition Number 3.1; Date 09/16/2016 
 
• Treat each of the toxicities with maximum supportive care (including holding the 
agent suspected of causing the toxicity where required).  
• If the symptoms promptly resolve with supportive care, consideration should be given to continuing the same dose of durvalumab or tremelimumab  along with appropriate 
continuing supportive care.  If medically appropriate, dose modifications are permitted 
for durvalumab and tremelimumab ( see below).  
• All dose modifications should be documented with clear reasoning and documentation 
of the approach taken.  
 
In addition, there are certain circumstances in which durvalumab or tremelimumab should be 
permanently discontinued. 
 
Following the first dose of durvalumab or tremelimumab, subsequent administration of durvalumab or tremelimumab can be modified based on toxicities observed (see Table 1, 2, and 3 below).   
Based on the mechanism of action of durvalumab or tremelimumab leading to T- cell 
activation and proliferation, there is the possibility of observing immune related Adverse 
Events (irAEs) during the conduct of this study.  Potential irAEs include immune- mediated 
enterocolitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathies. Subjects should be monitored for 
signs and symptoms of irAEs.  In the absence of an alternate etiology (e.g., infection or PD) 
signs or symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathy should be considered to be immune- related.   
Dose m odification recommendations and toxicity management guidelines for immune-
mediated reactions, for infusion-related reactions, and for non- immune -mediated reactions are 
detailed in Tables 1, 2, and 3, respectively.   
In addition, management guidelines for adverse events of special interest (AESIs) are detailed in Section 10.1.3. All toxicities will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.0.

  Drug administration modifications of study drug/study regimen will 
be made to manage potential immune -related AEs based on severity 
of treatment -emergent toxicities graded per NCI CTCAE v4.03.  
In addition to the criteria for permanent discontinuation of study drug/regimen based on CTC grade/severity (table below) , permanently discontinue study drug/study regimen for  the following 
conditions:  
• Inability to reduce cor ticosteroid to a dose of ≤10 mg of 
prednisone per day (or equivalent) within 12 weeks  after 
last dose of study drug/regimen 
• Recurrence of a previously experienced Grade 3 treatment -
related AE following resumption of dosing.  It is recommended that managemen t of irAEs follow the guidelines 
presented in this table  
- Patients should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any 
alternative etiology (e.g., disease progression, concomitant medications, infections, etc.)  
- In the absence of a clear alternative etiology, all  events should 
be considered potentially immune related.  
- Symptomatic and topical therapy should be considered for low -
grade (Grade 1 or 2, unless otherwise specified) events  
- For persistent  (greater than 3 to 5 days) low -grade (Grade 2)  or 
severe (Grade ≥3) events  promptly start prednisone 1 -
2mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent  
- If symptoms recur or worsen during corticosteroid tapering 28 days of taper), increase the corticosteroid dose (prednisone dose  [e.g. up to 2 -4mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent])   until 
stabilization or improvement of symptoms, then resume corticosteroid tapering at a slower rate (> 28 days of taper)   
- More potent immunosuppressives such as TNF inhibitors (e.g. 
infliximab) – (also refer to the individual sections of the immune 
related adverse event for specific type of immunosuppressive) 
should be considered for events not responding to systemic steroids.   
- Discontinuation of study drug is not mandated for Grade 3 / 
Grade 4 inflammatory reactions attributed to local tumour 
response (e.g. in flammatory reaction at sites of metastatic 
disease, lymph nodes etc.). Continuation of study drug in this situation should be based upon a benefit/risk analysis for that patient  
 Grade 1  No dose modification 
Grade 2  Hold study drug/study regimen dose until Grade 2 
resolution to ≤ Grade 1  
• If toxicity worsens then treat as Grade 3 or Grade 4  
Study drug/study treatment can be resumed once 
event stabilizes to Grade ≤1 completion of 
steroid taper  
Patients with endocrinopathies who may require 
prolonged or continued steroid replacement can be retreated with study drug/study regimen on the following conditions: 1) the event stabilizes and is controlled , 2) the patient is 
clinically stable as per Inv estigator or treating 
physician’s clinical judgment , and 3) doses of 
prednisone are at less than or equal to 
10mg/day or equivalent.

Diarrhea/ Enterocolitis  Grade of Diarrhea (CTCAE version 4.03)  
General Guidance  - Monitor for symptoms that may be related to diarrhea/enterocolitis (abdominal pain, cramping, or changes in bowel habits such as increased 
frequency over baseline or blood in stool) or related to bowel perforation (such as sepsis, peritoneal signs and ileus)  
- Patients should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology (e.g., disease progression, other medications, infections including testing for 
clostridium difficile toxin, etc.)  
- Steroids should be considered  in the absence of clear alternative etiology, even for low grade events, in order to prevent potential progression to higher grade event  
- Use analgesics carefully; they can mask symptoms of perforation and 
peritonitis  
Grade 1 diarrhea  (stool frequency of <4 over baseline per day)  No dose modification For Grade 1 diarrhea :  
-      Close monitoring for worsening symptoms  
-      Consider symptomatic treatment including hydration, electrolyte replacement, 
dietary changes (e.g., American Dietetic Association colitis diet), and loperamide. Use of probiotics as per treating physician’s clinical judgment.  
Grade 2 diarrhea (stool frequency of 4-6 over baseline 
per day)  Hold study drug/study regimen 
until resolution to ≤ Grade 1  
• If  toxicity worsens then treat as Grade 3 or Grade 4  
• If toxicity improves to ≤ 
Grade 1,  then study 
drug/study regimen can be resumed after completion of 
steroid taper     For Grade 2 diarrhea:  
- Consider symptomatic treatment including hydration, electrolyte replacement, dietary changes (e.g., American Dietetic Association colitis diet), and loperamide and/or budesonide  
- Promptly start  prednisone 1 to 2  mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent  
- If event is not responsive within 3 -5 days or worsens despite prednisone at 1-
2 mg/kg/day  PO or IV equivalent, GI consult should be obtained for 
consideration of further workup such as imaging and/or colonoscopy to confirm colitis and rule out perforation,   and prompt treatment with IV methylprednisolone 2- 4mg/kg/day started.

mediated 
peripheral neuromotor syndromes, such 
as Guillain -Barre 
and Myasthenia 
Gravis  syndromes is important, since certain patients may unpredictably experience 
acute decompensations which can result in substantial morbidity or in the worst case, death. Special care should be taken for certain sentinel symptoms which may predict a more severe outcome, such as prominent 
dysphagia, rapidly progressive weakness, and signs of resp iratory 
insufficiency or autonomic instability  
- Patients should be evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology (e.g., 
disease progression, infections, metabolic syndromes and medications, etc.). It should be noted that the diagnosis of immune -mediated peripheral 
neuromotor syndromes can be particularly challenging in patients with 
underlying cancer, due to the multiple potential confounding effects of 
cancer (and its treatments) throughout the neuraxis. Given the importance of prompt and accurate diagnosi s, it is essential to have a low threshold to 
obtain a neurological consult  
- Neurophysiologic diagnostic testing (e.g., electromyogram and nerve conduction investigations, and  “repetitive stimulation” if myasthenia is 
suspected) are routinely indicated upo n suspicion of such conditions and 
may be best facilitated by means of a neurology consultation  
Important to consider that the use of steroids as the primary treatment of 
Guillain -Barre is not typically considered effective. Patients requiring 
treatment s hould be started  with IVIG and followed by plasmapheresis if 
not responsive to IVIG

MYASTHENIA GRAVIS  
o Steroids may be successfully used to treat Myasthenia Gravis. Important to consider that steroid therapy (especially with high 
doses) may result in transient worsening of myasthenia and should typically be administered in a monitored setting under supervision of a consulting neurologist.  
o Patients unable to tolerate steroids may be candidates f or treatment 
with plasmapheresis or IVIG. Such decisions are best made in consultation with a neurologist, taking into account the unique 
needs of each patient.  
o If Myasthenia Gravis -like neurotoxicity present, consider starting 
acetylcholine esterase (AChE ) inhibitor therapy in addition to 
steroids. Such therapy, if successful, can also serve to reinforce the 
diagnosis.

signs 
Findings from medical history (obtained at screening) and physical examination shall be given 
a baseline grade according to the procedure for AEs. Increases in severity of pre -existing 
conditions during the study will be considered AEs, with resolution occurring when the grade 
returns to the pre-study grade or below. 
Physical examinations will be performed on study days noted in the Schedule of Assessments. 
8.2.2 Physical examination 
Physical examinations will be performed according to the assessment schedule.  Full physical 
examinations will include assessments of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat and the

respiratory, cardiovascular, GI, urogenital, musculoskeletal, neurological, dermatological, 
hematologic/lymphatic, and endocrine systems.  Height will be measured at screening only.  
Targeted physical examinations are to be utilized by the Investigator on the basis of clinical 
observations and symptomatology.  Situations in which physical examination results should be reported as AEs are described in Section 10   
8.2.3 Electrocardiograms  
Resting 12- lead ECGs will be recorded at screening and as clinically indi cated throughout the 
study .  ECGs should be obtained after the patient has been in a supine position for 5 minutes 
and recorded while the patient remains in that position.  
At Screening, a single ECG will be obtained on which QTcF must be <470 ms.   
In case of  clinically significant ECG abnormalities, including a QTcF value >470  ms, 
2 additional 12- lead ECGs should be obtained over a brief period ( e.g., 30 minutes) to confirm 
the finding.   
Situations in which ECG results should be reported as AEs are described in Section 10.0.   
8.2.4 Vital signs  
Vital signs (blood pressure [BP], pulse, temperature, and respiration rate) will be evaluated 
according to the assessment schedules .   
On infusion days, patients receiving durvalumab + tremelimumab treatment will be monitored during and after infusion of IP as presented in the bulleted list below.   
• Supine BP will be measured using a semi -automatic BP recording device with an 
appropriate cuff size, after the patient has rested for at least 5 minutes.  BP and pulse 
will be collected from patients receiving durvalumab + tremelimumab treatment 
before, during, and after each infusion at the following times (based on a 60- minute 
infusion):   
• Prior to the beginning of the infusion (measured once from approximately 30 minutes 
before up to 0 minutes [ i.e., the beginning of the infusion]).   
• Approximately 30 minutes during the infusion ( halfway through infusion).   
• At the end of the infusion (approx imately  60 minutes ±5 minutes).   
• A 1-hour observation period is r equired  after the first infusion of durvalumab and 
tremelimumab . If no clinically significant infusion reactions are observed during or

after the first cycle, subsequent i nfusion observation periods can be at the 
Investigator’s discretion (suggested 30 minutes after each durvalumab and 
tremelimumab infusion).   
If the infusion takes longer than 60 minutes, then BP and pulse measurements should follow the principles as described above or be taken more frequently if clinically indicated.  The date 
and time of collection and measurement will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  Additional 
monitoring with assessment of vital signs is at the discretion of the Investigator per standard clinical pra ctice or as clinically indicated.   
Body weight is also recorded along with vital signs.   
Situations in which vital signs results should be reported as AEs are described in Section 10.3.  
A complete physical examination will be performed and will include an assessment of the 
following (as clinically indicated): general appearance, respiratory, cardiovascular, abdomen, skin, head and neck (including ears, eyes, nose and throat), lymph nodes, thyroid, musculo-
skeletal (including spine and extremities), genital/rectal, and neurological systems and at 
screening only, height.   
8.2.5 Clinical laboratory tests 
The following clinical laboratory tests will be performed (see the Schedule of Assessments) 
• Coagulation parameters: Activated partial thromboplastin time
 and International 
normalised ratio to be assessed at baseline and as clinically indicated  
• Pregnancy test (female subjects of childbearing potential only)  
o Urine human chorionic gonadotropin  (at screening only)  
o Serum beta -human chorionic gonadotropin  
• Thyroid S timulating Hormone

PD-L1 Testing  
To ensure comparability of data across all studies of durvalumab and/or tremelimumab and to 
gain real world experience on the performance of this assay, it i s strongly encouraged that all 
studies that include PD -L1 testing utilize the Ventana SP263 assay.  Testing should be 
restricted to the Ventana SP263 assay and should be performed in accordance with the 
package insert on the Ventana Benchmark platform (Ult ra or XT).   
The Ventana SP263 assay is fully analytically validated test characterized through to the 
completion of reader precision studies in the non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 
squamous cell carcinoma of the head & neck (SCCHN).  For these tumors, the Ventana SP263 
assay has a fully reproducible data package supporting cut -off and scoring algorithm.  
Following completion of ATLANTIC and HAWK clinical trials, the assay will be associated 
with clinical utility.  In other cancer types (bladder, pancreatic, gastric, hepatocellular, triple 
negative breast, ovarian, esophageal, nasopharyngeal, glioblastoma, soft tissue sarcoma,

cholangiocarcinoma, small cell lung, melanoma and cervical HPV+ cancers), the Ventana 
SP263 assay has only limited clinical performance data.   
Sample collection for PD -L1 testing  
• The preferred tumor sample for the determination of a patient’s PD -L1 status is the 
one taken following the completion of the most recent prior line of therapy.  Sampl es 
taken at this time reflect the current PD -L1 status of the tumor and considered 
clinically most relevant.   
• In AstraZeneca studies, the preferred sample for PD -L1 testing was less than or equal 
to 3 months old.  In cases where a sample a less than 3 months old was not available, patients were asked to undergo a new biopsy if considered clinically appropriate by 
their treating physician.   
• Samples should be collected via a core needle of 18 gauge or larger or be collected by 
an incisional or excisional tumor biopsy.  Where institutional practice uses a smaller 
gauge needle, samples should be evaluated for tumor cell quantity (i.e. >100 tumor 
cells) to allow for adequate PD -L1 immunohistochemistry analyses.   
• When the collection of a new sample is not clinically appropriate, archival samples may be utilized provided the specimen it is not older than 3 years of age.  When 
archival samples are used to assess PD -L1 status, the age of the sample / date of 
collection should be captured.   
• Samples submitted for PD -L1 testing should be formalin fixed and embedded in 
paraffin  (please submit to Winship Pathology Core Lab; 5
th Floor Winship Building 
C).  Samples from fine needle aspirate (FNA) or decalcified bone are not appropriate 
for PD -L1 analysis.   
Sample data collection for PD- L1 testing  
The following fields of data should be collected from the site/institution collectin g and if, 
indicated shipping of the samples:   
• Patient identifier (ecode or unique identifier)  
• Specimen identifier (written on the specimen)  
• Specimen collection date  
• Type of specimen submitted  
• Quantity of specimen  
• Date of sectioning 
• Archival orfresh tumor

Study Number ESR-14-10531 /WINSHIP3112- 15; Edition Number 3.1; Date 09/16/2016 
 
• Tumor type  
• Primary tumor location  
• Metastatic tumor location (if applicable)  
• Fixative  
The following fields of data should be collected from PD -L1 testing laboratory: 
• Are the negative and positive controls stained correctly  
• Is the H&E material acceptable  
• Is morphology acceptable  
• Total percent positivity  of PD -L1 in tumor cells  
• PD-L1 status (positive, negative or NA) in tumor cells  
• Total percent positivity of PD -L1 in infiltrating  immune cells  
The Ventana SP263 assay to measure PD -L1 in tumors  is experimental . As with all tests, there 
is a chance of false positive (the test shows high PD -L1 when it is not there) or false negative 
(the test does not show PD-L1 when it is there) results may occur.   
Sample processing and if indicated submission process for PD -L1 testing  
Preparing Stored samples for testing  
• Where samples already exist, they should be retrieved from the Bio -Bank storage 
location.  These blocks should undergo quality review, prior to evaluation or shipment.  
Where it is not possible or indicated to ship the block to a testing laboratory, unstained slides should be prepared from the paraffin- embedded tumor sample block (described 
below) prior to evaluation or shipment.   
Preparing newly acquired samples for PD -L1 testing 
• If patients are undergoing a b iopsy procedure that provides the option to submit newly 
acquired samples, this sample should be used to determine PD -L1 status.  Where 
clinically acceptable, a minimum of 2 core biopsies should be collected and processed to FFPE in a single block.  The provision of 2 cores is advised in order to provide sufficient tissue for PD -L1 assessment.  
• It is recommended that core needle tumor biopsies are collected using an 18 gauge or 
larger needle and the process should be image -guided.  Excisional or incisional 
samples are also adequate.  If this is not per the institutions normal practice and a smaller gauge needle is used then the number of cores collected should be increased to 
allow sufficient material for successful PD -L1 testing (>100 tumor cells) and

embedded in the same block.  If available, a single excisional biopsy of at least 4 mm 
in diameter may substitute for all core biopsies.  
Fixation of biopsy samples for PD- L1 testing  
• Previously frozen tissue is not acceptable for processing to FFPE for PD -L1 testing.  
To fix newly acquired tissue, place immediately (within 30 min of excision) into an 
adequate volume of 10% v/v neutral buffered formalin (NBF).  Samples should remain in fixative for 24 – 48 hours at room temperature.   
• It is vital that there is an adequate volume of fixative relevant to the tissue (at least a 
10 volume excess) and that large specimens (if any) are incised prior to fixation to promote efficient tissue preservation.   
Embedding in paraffin for PD- L1 testing  
• An overnight processing schedule into paraffin wax is recommended  
• Below is the suggested routine overnight processing schedule: 
Storage of tumor blocks for PD- L1 testing  
• FFPE blocks should be stored at ambient temperature and protected from light until shipment by courier at ambient temperature. FFPE blocks are stable under these conditions for an indefinite period. 
Quality control of samples to be used for PD- L1 testing  
• Tissue should be assessed by the site pathologist prior to PD-L1 testing.   
• Each sample should be reviewed for:  
• Adequate fixation  
• Good preservation of morphology 
• Presence of tumor tissue  
• Histopathology consistent with indication   
• Greater than 100 tumor cells are required to determine PD -L1 status – tumor 
cell content must be reviewed prior to testing in order f or PD -L1 obtain a valid 
result.   
If indicated, shipping samples to a PD-L1 testing laboratory

• When submitting sample to for PD -L1 testing the recommendation is to ship the block 
in order for sectioning to occur at the laboratory. Blocks should be shipped  - 
containing enough  material to  be provided to allow a minimum of 5, and preferably 
10, sections to be cut (each 4  micron thick) to be used for PD- L1 testing.    
Sectioning instructions 
• Where it is not possible or indicated to ship the block to laborat ory for PD -L1 testing, 
unstained slides should be prepared from the paraffin-embedded tumor sample block 
as described below:   
• A minimum of 5 -10 x 4 micron (μm) thick, unstained sections should be 
provided for PD-L1 testing 
• A new disposable microtome blade  must be used for each block to prevent 
contamination between Slides are stable under these conditions for 6 months. 
• patient samples  
• Apply one section per slide to positively- charged Superfrost glass slides  
• The sections should be dried overnight between room temperature and 37°C. 
Do not dry sections at temperatures above 37°C. 
Sections should be stored at ambient temperature and protected from light until use or 
shipment to testing lab by courier at ambient temperature.  It is recommended that slides are 
cut freshly prior to PD -L1 testing and they are used within 90 days of being cut to obtain PD -
L1 status

8.3.5 Archival tumor samples and fresh tumor biopsies  
8.3.5.1 Archival tumor samples  
 Archival samples will be collected from all patients where feasible. This sample may be 
substituted for baseline tumor biopsy in the event that the patient does not have easily 
biopsable tumor site.   
8.3.5.2 Fresh tumor biopsies  
Mandatory f resh tumor biopsies will be collected from all subjects at baseline and prior to the 
administration of cycle 3 therapy  (exception as in section 8.3.5.1 above) . Samples will be collected by 
image -guided core needle biopsy, minimum of three core needle biopsies required at each time point in 
addition to samples collected for pathologic confirmation. An optional biopsy at the time of 
progression will be collected when feasible. Samples will be stored in three separate aliquots in the Winship lung satellite tumor bank refrigerator. Two aliquots will be employed to elute TILs to be subjected to FACS analysis while the third aliquot will be employed for IHC to detect PD- L1 
expression and spatial distribution of TILs. Additional samples may be used for future genomic and metabolomic research  if available.  
8.3.6 Withdrawal of informed consent for donated biological samples 
If a subject withdraws consent to the use of donated samples, the samples will be disposed 
of/destroyed, and the action docum ented. As collection of the biological samples is an integral 
part of the study, then the subject is withdrawn from further study participation.

Study Number ESR-14-10531 /WINSHIP3112- 15; Edition Number 3.1; Date 09/16/2016 
 
Patient response to treatment and overall clinical efficacy will be a ssessed according to 
RECIST 1.1 criteria. This assessment will be used to determine ORR, DoR, DCR, and PFS. 
OS will also be evaluated.  
Cross sectional imaging (CT or MRI) will be the methods of assessment of tumor burden at baseline to include at the minimum, chest imaging to include the upper abdomen and any 
other areas of known disease involvement based on the signs and symptoms of indi vidual 
patients.  
The baseline assessment should be performed no more than 28 days before the start of 
treatment and as close as possible to the start of treatment. Efficacy for all patients will be 
assessed by objective tumor assessments Q8 weeks for the first 6 months (counting from the 
date of the first MEDI4736 or tremelimumab infusion) and then Q12 weeks thereafter until 
confirmed objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 (irrespective of the reason for stopping treatment or subsequent the rapy).  
If an unscheduled scan is performed in the absence of suspicion of progression within 2 weeks of a scheduled scan, the scan does not need to be repeated. The next scan should be obtained according to the original schedule of imaging.  
Disease progr ession requires confirmatory scan to be obtained at the next scheduled visit and 
no earlier than 4 weeks after the initial assessment of PD in the absence of clinically significant deterioration. Treatment will continue between the initial assessment of progression and confirmation for progression.  
Only patients determined not to have any significant, unacceptable, or irreversible toxicity, or 
continue to receive benefit from therapy can continue therapy through progression during the 
initial 12 months of therapy or restart a second 12 months of retreatment upon suspicion of PD. The patient must still meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria including reconsenting to continue or restart treatment.  
Patients with rapid tumor prog ression or with symptomatic progression that requires urgent 
medical intervention (e.g., central nervous system metastasis, respiratory failure due to tumor 
compression, or spinal cord compression) will not be eligible to continue to receive study drug. Patients with confirmed progression cannot continue therapy or obtain retreatment if the progression occurred during dosing and after confirmed response in the target lesions (i.e., the 
response and progression events both occurred while receiving active IP during the same 
treatment period in the target lesions).  
Progression would be considered confirmed if the following criteria are met: 
74 
 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Investigational Drug Substance: Durvalumab and Tremelimumab  
Study Number ESR-14-10531 /WINSHIP3112- 15; Edition Number 3.1; Date 09/16/2016 
 
• ≥20% increase in the sum diameters of target lesions compared with the nadir at 2 
consecutive visits with an absolute increase of 5 mm(1) 
• And/or significant progression (worsening) of non- target lesions or new lesions at the 
confirmatory PD time point compared with the first time point where progression of 
non-target lesions or new lesions was identified  
• And/or additional new  unequivocal lesions at the confirmatory PD time point 
compared with the first time point at which new lesions were identified.(1)  
The assessment of progression requires a ≥20% increase in the sum diameters of target lesions at the first progression time point relative to the nadir. The nadir is the smallest sum of diameters, and this may be at baseline or subsequent follow -up assessments. The confirmatory 
scan confirms the persistence of the ≥20% increase relative to the nadir. The minimum 
absolute increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions is at least 5 mm at both 
assessments. In the absence of clinically significant deterioration, treatment should continue until progression is confirmed. If progression is not confirmed, then the patient should continue on study treatment and on treatment assessments.  
Categorization of objective tumor response assessment will be based on the RECIST 1.1 criteria of response: CR, PR, SD, and PD. Target lesion progression will be calculated in comparison to when the tumor burden was at a minimum (i.e., smallest sum of diameters 
previously recorded on study). In the absence of progression, tumor response (CR or PR) and 
SD will be calculated in comparison to the baseline tumor measurements obtained before 
starting treatment.  
Objective tumor response (CR or PR) should be confirmed preferably at the next scheduled visit and not less than 4 weeks after the visit when the response was first observed. If the 
Investigator is in doubt as to whether progression has occurred, par ticularly with response to 
non-target lesion or the appearance of a new lesion, it is advisable to continue treatment until 
the next scheduled assessment or sooner if clinically indicated and reassess the patient’s 
status. If repeat scans confirm progressi on, then the date of the initial scan should be declared 
as the date of progression.  
To achieve “unequivocal progression” on the basis of non- target disease, there must be an 
overall level of substantial worsening in non- target disease such that, even in presence of SD 
or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest “increase” in the size of one or more non- target lesions 
is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. Following confirmed progression, patients should continue to be followed up for survival every 2 -3 months as 
75

outlined in the study plan. An exception are patients with confirmed PD who continue to 
receive IP at the discretion of the Investigator; these patients can receive treatment for a 
maximum of 12 months and will have scans for RECIST 1.1 assessments every 8 weeks (Q8W) (relative to the date of the first infusion) for 6 months and then every 3 months until disease progression.  
Patients who achieve and maintain disease control (i.e., CR, PR, or SD) through to the end of the initial 12 -month treatment period may restart treatment with the durvalumab + 
tremelimumab combination upon evidence of PD, with or without confirmation, during follow-up. To be eligible to restart treatment, the patient must not have received an 
intervening systemic anticancer therapy post discontinuation of initial treatment. Patients who restart treatment must have a baseline tumor assessment within 28 days of restarting  
treatment; all further scans should occur Q8W (relative to the date of restarting treatment) for the next 6 months and then Q12W until study treatment is stopped (maximum of 12 months of 
further treatment).  
Patients who are eligible for retreatment will receive durvalumab (1500 mg/kg) via IV 
infusion Q4W for 4 months (4 doses) and tremelimumab (75 mg) via IV infusion Q4W for 4 
months (up to 4 doses in total). After completion of the initial 4 doses of repeat combination 
therapy, single agent durvalumab will continue at 1500mg Q 4 weeks  to complete 12 months 
of therapy . The first durvalumab dose at 1500 mg  will be 4 weeks after the final dose of the 
combination of tremelimumab and durvalumab. It is important to follow the assessment 
schedule as closely as p ossible.  
Immune -related Response Criteria (irRC)  
The response to immunotherapy may differ from the typical responses observed with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy including the following (Wolchok et al 2009, Nishino et al 2013): 
• Response to immunotherapy may be de layed  
• Response to immunotherapy may occur after PD by conventional criteria 
• The appearance of new lesions may not represent PD with immunotherapy 
• SD while on immunotherapy may be durable and represent clinical benefit. 
 
Based on the above -described unique response to immunotherapy and based on guidelines 
from regulatory agencies, e.g., European Medicines Agency’s “Guideline on the evaluation of 
anti-cancer medicinal products in man” (EMA/CHMP/205/95/Rev.4) for immune modulating 
anti-cancer compounds, the study may wish to implement the following in addition to 
standard RECIST 1.1 criteria:

Clinical Study Protocol

Study Number ESR-14-10531 /WINSHIP3112- 15; Edition Number 3.1; Date 09/16/2016 
 
• RECIST will be modified so that PD must be confirmed at the next scheduled visit, 
preferably, and no earlier than 4 weeks after the initial assessment of PD in the 
absence  of clinically significant deterioration.  Treatment with durvalumab + 
tremelimumab  would continue between the initial assessment of progression and 
confirmation for progression.  
• In addition, subjects may continue to receive durvalumab + tremelimumab  beyond 
confirmed PD in the absence of clinically significant deterioration and if investigators 
consider that subjects continue to receive benefit from treatment.  
Modification of RECIST as described may discourage the early discontinuation of 
durvalumab + tremelimumab  and provide a more complete evaluation of its anti -tumor 
activity than would be seen with conventional response criteria.  Nonetheless, the efficacy analysis will be conducted by programmatically deriving each efficacy endpoint based on 
RECI ST 1.1 criteria.  
Of note, clinically significant deterioration is considered to be a rapid tumor progression that 
necessitates treatment with anti- cancer therapy other than durvalumab + tremelimumab  or 
with symptomatic progression that requires urgent medical intervention (e.g., central nervous 
system metastasis, respiratory failure due to tumor compression, spinal cord compression).>> 
9.1.1 Efficacy variable 
Progression free survival (PFS): Measured from C1D1 until objective disease progression or 
death.  
Objecti ve response rate (ORR): According to RECIST 1.1 criteria based on cross sectional 
imaging obtained Q8W (after every 2 cycles) for the first 6 months and Q12W thereafter. 
Disease control rate (DCR): Sum total of the proportion of patients with best response of 
complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD).  
Duration of response (DoR): Measured as interval of time from the first documentation of objective response (PR or CR) and subsequent progression of disease. 
Subjects who have disease control following completion of 12 months of treatment or subjects 
who are withdrawn from MEDI4736 treatment for reasons other than confirmed PD will continue to have objective tumor assessments (see Appendix B).   
Subjects who have disease control following completion of 12 months of treatment or subjects 
who are withdrawn from durvalumab + tremelimumab  treatment for reasons other than 
confirmed PD will continue to have objective tumor assessments (see Appendix 3).

pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can  therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
An AE includes but is not limited to any clinically significant worsening of a subject’s 
pre-existing condition. An abnormal laboratory finding (including ECG finding) that requires 
an action or intervention by the investigator, or a finding judged by the investigator to 
represent a change beyond the range of normal physiologic fluctuation, should be reported as an AE.  
Adverse events may be treatment emergent ( i.e., occurring after initial receipt of 
investigational product) or nontreatment emergent. A nontreatment -emergent AE is  any new 
sign or symptom, disease, or other untoward medical event that begins after written informed consent has been obtained but before the subject has received investigational product.  
Elective treatment or surgery or preplanned treatment or surgery ( that was scheduled prior to 
the subject being enrolled into the study) for a documented pre -existing condition, that did not 
worsen from baseline, is not considered an AE (serious or nonserious). An untoward medical 
event occurring during the prescheduled elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment 
should be recorded as an AE or SAE. 
The term AE is used to include both serious and non- serious AEs.  
10.1.2 Definition of serious adverse events  
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., screening, run-in, 
treatment, wash -out, follow -up), at any dose of the study drugs that fulfils one or more of the 
following criteria:

Results in death  
Is immediately life -threatening 
Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect in offspring of the subject 
Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above :  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding 
whether expedited reporting is appropriate in this situation. 
Examples of medically important events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, 
blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalizations; or development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
The causality of SAEs (their relationship to all study treatment/procedures) will be assessed by the i nvestigator(s) and communicated to AstraZeneca.  
10.1.3 Durvalumab + tremelimumab adverse events of special interest  
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is one of scientific and medical interest specific to 
understanding of the Investigational Product and may require close monitoring and rapid 
communication by the investigator to the sponsor. An AESI may be serious or non-serious. The rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to characterize and understand them in association with the use of this investigational product. 
AESIs for durvalumab and tremelimumab include but are not limited to events with a 
potential inflammatory or immune -mediated mechanism and which may require more 
frequent monitoring and/or interventions such as steroids, immunosuppressants and/or hormone replacement therapy. These AESIs are being closely monitored in clinical studies 
with durvalumab monotherapy and combination therapy. An immune -related adverse event 
(irAE) is defined as an adverse event th at is associated with drug exposure and is consistent 
with an immune -mediated mechanism of action and where there is no clear alternate 
aetiology. Serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate, should be used to support an irAE diagnosis. Appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, 
infectious, metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic causes of the irAE.

Study Number ESR-14-10531 /WINSHIP3112- 15; Edition Number 3.1; Date 09/16/2016 
 
If the Investigator has any questions in regards to an adverse event (AE) being an irAE, the 
Investigator should promptly contact the Sponsor-Investigator. 
AESIs observed with durvalumab and tremelimumab include: 
• Colitis  
• Pneumonitis 
• ALT/AST increases / hepatitis / hepatotoxicity  
• Neuropathy / neuromuscular toxicity (i.e. events of encephalitis, peripheral motor and sensory neuropathies, Guillain -Barré, and myasthenia gravis)  
• Endocrinopathy (i.e. events of hypophysitis, adrenal insufficiency, and hyper - and 
hypothyroidism) 
• Dermatitis  
• Nephritis  
• Pancreatitis  (or labs suggestive of pancreatitis - increased serum lipase , increas ed 
serum amylase)   
Further information on these risks (e.g. presenting symptoms) can be found in the current 
version of the durvalumab and tremelimumab Investigator Brochure. For durvalumab and 
tremelimumab, AESIs will comprise the following:    
AEs of sp ecial interest (AESIs) are events of scientific and medical interest specific to the 
further understanding of durvalumab and tremelimumab safety profile and require close 
monitoring and rapid communication by the Investigator to AstraZeneca.  Durvalumab and 
tremelimumab AESIs may be serious or non -serious.  The rapid reporting of these AESIs 
allows ongoing analysis of these events in order to characterize and understand them in 
association with the use of these IPs. 
Durvalumab, an anti -PD-L1 antibody, binds  with high affinity and specificity to PD -L1 and 
blocks its binding to PD -1 (CD279) and B7- 1 (CD80) molecules, thus promoting anti -tumor 
immunity and tumor cell killing.  Tremelimumab, a CTLA -4 antibody, blocks the inhibitory 
signal resulting from CTLA -4 binding to B7 ligands on antigen -presenting cells, thus 
maintaining T -cell homeostasis.  Potential risks based on these mechanisms of action include 
immune -mediated reactions such as enterocolitis, dermatitis, hepatotoxicity or hepatitis, 
endocrinopathy, neuropathy or neurologic events, pancreatitis, and pneumonitis. The class including anti -PD-L1 drugs and other immune checkpoint antibodies, such as 
anti-PD-1 or anti -CTLA -4, have a wide spectrum of immune -mediated reactions that have 
been considered inflamm atory in nature and can affect any organ of the body.   
For durvalumab and tremelimumab, AESIs will comprise the following:

Study Number ESR-14-10531 /WINSHIP3112- 15; Edition Number 3.1; Date 09/16/2016 
 
Pneumonitis  
AEs of pneumonitis are also of interest for AstraZeneca, as pneumonitis has been observed 
with use of anti -PD-1 mAbs (but not with anti -PD-L1 mAbs).  Initial work -up should include 
a high -resolution CT scan, ruling out infection, and pulse oximetry.  Pulmonary consultation 
is highly recommended. Guidelines for the management of patients with immune -related AEs 
(irAEs) including pneumonitis are provided in Table 1 .   
Infusion reactions  
AEs of infusion reactions (also termed infusion -related reactions) are of  special interest to 
AstraZeneca and are defined, for the purpose of this protocol, as all AEs occurring from the 
start of IP infusion up to 48 hours after the infusion start time.  For all infusion reactions ,  
SAEs should be reported to AstraZeneca Patient safety as described in Section 10.3.   
Hypersensitivity reactions  
Hypersensitivity reactions as well as infusion -related reactions have been reported with 
anti-PD-L1 and anti -PD-1 therapy ( Brahmer et  al 2012).  As with the administration of any 
foreign protein and/or other biologic agents, reactions following the infusion of mAbs can be 
caused by various mechanisms, including acute anaphylactic ( IgE-mediated) and 
anaphylactoid reactions against the mAbs and serum sickness.  Acute allergic reactions may 
occur, may be severe, and may result in death.  Acute allergic reactions may include 
hypotension, dyspnea, cyanosis, respiratory failure, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, hypotonia, arthralgia, bronchospasm, wheeze, cough, dizziness, fatigue, headache, hypertension, myalgia, vomiting, and unresponsiveness.  Guidelines for the management of patients with 
hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic reaction) and infusion- related reactions are provided 
in Table 1 .    
Hepatic function abnormalities (hepatotoxicity) 
Hepatic function abnormality is defined as any increase in ALT or AST to greater than 
3 × ULN and concurrent increase in total bilirubin to be gr eater than 2  × ULN.  Concurrent 
findings are those that derive from a single blood draw or from separate blood draws taken within 8  days of each other.  Follow -up investigations and inquiries will be initiated promptly 
by the investigational site to determine whether the findings are reproducible and/or whether there is objective evidence that clearly supports causation by a disease ( e.g., cholelithiasis and 
bile duct obstruction with distended gallbladder) or an agent other than the IP.  Guidelines for management of patients with hepatic function abnormality are provided in Table 1.

Gastrointestinal disorders  
Diarrhea/colitis is the most commonly observed treatment emergent SAE when tremelimumab 
is used as monotherapy.  In rare cases, colon perforation may occur that requires surgery (colectomy) or can lead to a fatal outcome if not properly managed.  Guidelines on management of d iarrhea and colitis in patients receiving tremelimumab are provided in Table 
1. 
Endocrine disorders  
Immune- mediated endocrinopathies include hypophysitis, adrenal insufficiency, and hyper - 
and hypothyroidism.  Guidelines for the management of patients with immune -mediated 
endocrine events are provided in Table 1.  
Pancreatic disorders  
Immune- mediated pancreatitis includes autoimmun e pancreatitis, and lipase and amylase 
elevation.  Guidelines for the management of patients with immune -mediated pancreatic 
disorders are provided in Table 1 . 
Neurotoxicity  
Immune- mediated nervous system events include encephalitis, peripheral motor and s ensory 
neuropathies, Guillain- Barré, and myasthenia gravis.  Guidelines for the management of 
patients with immune -mediated neurotoxic events are provided in Table 1 . 
Nephritis  
Consult with Nephrologist.  Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be related to changes in 
renal function (e.g. routine urinalysis,  elevated serum BUN and creatinine, decreased 
creatinine clearance, electrolyte imbalance, decrease in urine output, proteinuria, etc. )  
Patients should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology (e.g., disease 
progression, infections etc.) 
Steroids should be considered in the absence of clear alternative etiology even for low grade 
events (Grade 2) , in order to prevent potential progression to higher grade event.   Guidelines 
for the management of patients with immune -mediated neurotoxic events are provided in 
Table 1.  
10.1.4 Immune -related adverse events  
Based on the mechanism of action of durvalumab and tremelimumab leading to T -cell 
activation and proliferation, there is a possibility of observing irAEs during the conduct of this study.  Potential irAEs may be similar to those seen with the use of ipilimumab, BMS -936558

(anti-PD-1 mAb), and BMS -936559 (anti -PD-L1 mAb) and may include immune -mediated 
enterocolitis, dermatitis, hepatitis (hepatotoxicity), pneumonitis, and endocrinopathies ( Hodi 
et al 2010, Brahmer et  al 2012,).  These AEs are inflammatory in nature and can affect any 
organ.  With anti -PD-L1 and anti -CTLA -4 combination therapy, the occurrence of 
overlapping or increasing cumulative toxicities that include irAEs could potentially occur at 
higher frequencies than with either durvalumab or tremelimumab monotherapy.  Patients 
should be monitored for signs and symptoms of irAEs.  In the  absence of an alternate etiology 
(e.g., infection or PD), an immune -related etiology should be considered for signs or 
symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathy.  In addition to the dose modification guidelines provided in Table 1 , it is recommended that irAEs are 
managed according to the general treatment guidelines outlined for ipilimumab.  These 
guidelines recommend the following: 
• Patients should be evaluated to identify any alternative etiology.  
• In the absence of  a clear alternative etiology, all events of an 
inflammatory nature should be considered immune related. 
• Symptomatic and topical therapy should be considered for low -grade 
events.  
• Systemic corticosteroids should be considered for a persistent low -
grade event or for a severe event.  
• More potent immunosuppressives should be considered for events not responding to systemic steroids ( e.g., infliximab or 
mycophenolate).  
• If the Investigator has any questions  in regards to an AE being an 
irAE, the Investigator should immediately contact the Study Physician.

10.2 Assessment of safety parameters  
10.2.1 Assessment of severity  
Assessment of severity is one of the responsibilities of the investigator in the evaluation of 
AEs and SAEs. Severity will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03. 
The determination of severity for all other events not listed in the CTCAE should be made by the investigator based upon medical judgment and the severity categories of Grade 1 to 5 as 
defined below. 
Grade 1 (mild)  An event that is usually transient and may require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally 
interfere with usual activities of daily living.  
 Grade 2 (moderate)  An event that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm 
to the subject. 
 
Grade 3 (severe)  An event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention. The event interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects the 
clinical status of the subject.  
 
Grade 4 (life threatening) An event, and/or its immediate sequelae, that is associated with  
an imminent risk of death or with physical or mental disabilities that 
affect or limit the ability of the subject to perform activities of daily 
living (eating, ambulation, toileting, etc.). 
 Grade 5 (fatal)  Death (loss of life) as a result of an event.  
 
 
It is important to distinguish between serious criteria and severity of an AE. Severity is a 
measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Section 9.2.1. A Grade 3 
AE need not necessarily be considered an SAE. For example, a Grade 3 headache that persists 
for several hours may not meet the regulatory definition of an SAE and would be considered a 
nonserious event, whereas a Grade 2 seizure resulting in a hospital admission would be considered an SAE.

10.2.2 Assessment of relationship  
Attribution will be based on temporal relationship and whether or not the AE is anticipated for 
the procedure or investigational agent. 
10.3 Recording of adverse events and serious adverse events  
Adverse events will be recorded in the electronic data capture system (OncoreTM) using a 
recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the event. Adverse events will be 
assessed by the investigator for severity, relationship to the investigational product, possible 
etiologies, and whether the event meets criteria of an SAE and therefore requires immediate notification to AstraZeneca/MedImmune Patient Safety.  
The following variables will be collected for each AE:  
• AE (verbatim)  
• The date when the AE started and stopped 
• Changes in NCI CTCAE grade and the maximum CTC grade attained  
• Whether the AE is serious or not 
• Investigator causality rating against durvalumab or tremelimumab (yes or no) 
<<and/or radiation  (yes/no)>>  
• Action taken with regard to durvalumab + tremelimumab/comparator/combination 
agent  
• Outcome 
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs as applicable: 
• Date AE met criteria for serious AE  
• Date Investigator became aware of serious AE  
• AE is serious due to <<criteria>>  
• Date of hospitalization  
• Date of discharge  
• Probable cause of death  
• Date of death  
• Autopsy performed 
• Description of AE 
• Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s)  
Events, which are unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE 
during the study.

Study Number ESR-14-10531 /WINSHIP3112- 15; Edition Number 3.1; Date 09/16/2016 
 
10.3.1 Study recording period and follow -up for adverse events  and serious adverse 
events  
Adverse events and serious adverse events will be recorded from time of signature of 
informed consent, throughout the treatment period and including the follow -up period (90 
days after the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab ). 
During the course of the study all AEs and SAEs should be proactively followed up for each 
subject. Every effort should be made to obtain a resolution for all events, even if the events 
continue after discontinuation/study completion. 
If a subject discon tinues from treatment for reasons other than disease progression, and 
therefore continues to have tumor assessments, drug or procedure -related SAEs must be 
captured until the patient is considered to have confirmed PD and will have no further tumor 
assessm ents. 
The investigator is responsible for following all SAEs until resolution, until the subject  returns 
to baseline status, or until the condition has stabilized with the expectation that it will remain 
chronic, even if this extends beyond study participation. 
Follow- up of unresolved adverse events  
Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’s last visit in the study are followed up by the 
investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF.  
After 90 days, only subjects with ongoing investigational product -related SAEs will continue 
to be followed for safety. 
AstraZeneca/MedImmune retains the right to request additional information for any subject 
with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 
Post study events  
 
After the subject has been permanently withdrawn from the study, there is no obligation for 
the investigator to actively report information on new AE or SAEs occurring in former study subjects after the 90 -day safety follow -up period for  patients treated with durvalumab + 
tremelimumab.  However, if an investigator learns of any SAEs, including death, at any time after the subject has been permanently withdrawn from study, and he/she considers there is a reasonable possibility that the event is related to study treatment, the investigator should notify the study sponsor and AstraZeneca/MedImmune Drug Safety.

10.3.2 Reporting of serious adverse events  
All SAEs will be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational 
product, or to the study procedure(s) . The reporting period for SAEs is the period immediately 
following the time that written informed consent is obtained through 90 days after the last 
dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab or until the initiation of alternative anticancer therapy.  The investigator and/or Sponsor are responsible for informing the Ethics Committee and/or 
the Regulatory Authority of the SAE as per local requirements.  
The investigator and/or sponsor must inform the FDA, via a MedWatch/AdEERs form, of any 
serious or unexpected adverse events that occur in accordance with the reporting obligations of 21 CFR 312.32, and will concurrently forward all such reports to AstraZeneca.  A copy of 
the MedWatch/AdEERs report must be faxed to AstraZeneca at the time the event is reported 
to the FDA.  It is the responsibility of the sponsor to compile all necessary information and ensure that the FDA receives a report according to the FDA reporting requirement timelines  
and to ensure that these reports are also submitted to AstraZeneca at the same time.  
* A cover page should accompany the MedWatch/AdEERs  form indicating the following:  
• “Notification from an Investigator Sponsored Study” 
• The investigator IND number assigned by the FDA 
• The investigator’s name and address 
• The trial name/title and AstraZeneca ISS reference number ( ESR-14-10531) 
* Sponsor must also indicate, either in the SAE report or the cover page, the causality  of 
events in relation to all study medications  and if the SAE is related to disease progression , as 
determined by the principal investigator.  
* Send SAE report and accompanying cover page by way of email to AstraZeneca’s 
designated mailbox:    AEMailboxClinicalTrialTCS@astrazeneca.com  
 
If a non- serious AE becomes serious, this and other relevant follow -up information must also 
be provided to AstraZeneca and the FDA. 
Serious adverse events  that do not require expedited reporting to the FDA  still need to be 
reported to AstraZeneca preferably using the MedDRA coding language for serious adverse 
events.  This information should be reported on a monthly basis and under no circumstance less frequently than quarterly.

10.3.2.1 Reporting of deaths 
All deaths that occur during the study or within the protocol -defined 90 -day post -last dose of 
durvalumab + tremelimumab safety follow -up period must be reported as follows: 
• Death that is clearly the result of disease progression should be 
documented but should not be reported as an SAE. 
• Where death is not due (or not clearly due) to progression of the disease under study, the AE causing the death must be reported to AstraZeneca as a SAE within 24 hours  (see Section 10.3.2 for 
further details).  The report  should contain a comment regarding the 
co-involvement of progression of disease, if appropriate, and should 
assign main and contributory causes of death.   
• Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as a SAE.   
Deaths that occur following the protocol- defined 90 -day post -last-dose of MEDI4736 safety 
follow- up period will be documented <<as events for survival analysis>>, but will not be 
reported as an SAE.  
10.3.3 Other events requiring reporting  
10.3.3.1 Overdose  
An overdose is defined as a subject receiving a  dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab in excess 
of that specified in the Investigator’s Brochure, unless otherwise specified in this protocol. 
Any overdose of a study subject with durvalumab + tremelimumab, with or without associated 
AEs/SAEs, is required to be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to the sponsor 
and AstraZeneca/MedImmune Patient Safety or designee using the designated Safety e-mailbox (see Section  10.3.2 for contact information). If the overdose results in an AE, the AE 
must also  be recorded as an AE (see Section 10.3). Overdose does not automatically make an 
AE serious, but if the consequences of the overdose are serious, for example death or hospitalization, the event is serious and must be recorded and reported as an SAE (see S ection 
10.3 and Section  10.3.2). There is currently no specific treatment in the event of an overdose 
of durvalumab or tremelimumab.  
The investigator will use clinical judgment to treat any overdose.

10.3.3.2 Hepatic function abnormality 
Hepatic function abnormali ty (as defined in Section 10.1.3.) in a study subject, with or 
without associated clinical manifestations, is required to be reported as “hepatic function 
abnormal” within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to the sponsor and 
AstraZeneca/MedImmune Patient Safety using the designated Safety e- mailbox (see Section 
10.3.2 for contact information), unless a definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality 
(e.g., cholelithiasis or bile duct obstruction) that is unrelated to investigational product has 
been co nfirmed.  
• If the definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality has been established and is unrelated 
to investigational product, the decision to continue dosing of the study subject will be based on 
the clinical judgment of the investigator. 
• If no definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality is established, dosing of the study 
subject must be interrupted immediately. Follow -up investigations and inquiries must be 
initiated by the investigational site without delay.  
Each reported event of hepatic  function abnormality will be followed by the investigator and 
evaluated by the sponsor and AstraZeneca/MedImmune.  
10.3.3.3 Pregnancy  
10.3.3.4 Maternal exposure  
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study, the IPs should be discontinued 
immediately.   
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the IP under study may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  Congenital 
abnormalities or birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as 
SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.
  The outcome 
of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented even if the patient 
was discontinued from the study.   
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site personnel 
should inform the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day, i.e., immediately, but 
no later than 24 hours  of when he or she becomes aware of it.

Study Number ESR-14-10531 /WINSH IP3112- 15; Edition Number 3.1; Date 09/16/2016 
 
The designated AstraZeneca representative will work with the Investigator to ensure that all 
relevant information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 to 
5 calendar days for SAEs and within 30 days for all other pregnancies.   
The same timelines apply when outcome information is available.   
10.3.4 Paternal exposure  
Male patients should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 
180 days after the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or 90 days 
after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy , whichever is the longer time period.   
Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE.  However, the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, 
or congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose until 90 days after the last 
dose should, if possible, be followed up and do cumented.   
Where a report of pregnancy is received, prior to obtaining information about the pregnancy, the Investigator must obtain the consent of the patient’s partner.  Therefore, the local study 
team should adopt the generic ICF template in line with local procedures and submit it to the 
relevant Ethics Committees (ECs)/Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) prior to use.   
11. STATISTICAL METHODS AND SAMPLE SIZE 
DETERMINATION 
All patients meeting eligibility requirement will be randomly assigned to one of two  treatment 
groups. Block randomization method will be used to assign patients randomly to the two 
groups. The block size of randomization is 2 to guarantee each group will have equal number of 10 patients. The SAS version 9.3 is employed to generate the ra ndomization table for 
patient assignment.  
11.1 Description of analysis sets

11.1.2 Efficacy analysis set 
All patients who completed at least 2 cycles of therapy and underwent restaging scan will be 
included in the efficacy analysis. Patients who discontinued treatment due to toxicity may be 
replaced for the efficacy endpoint if treatment was stopped prior to the first restaging scan. 
11.1.3 Rand omization 
All patients meeting eligibility requirement will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment 
groups. Block randomization method will be used to assign patients randomly to the two groups. The block size of randomization is 2 to guarantee each group will have equal number of 10 patients. The SAS version 9.3 is employed to generate the randomization table for patient assignment.  
11.2 Methods of statistical analyses  
All data will be listed individually by subject. Continuous variables will be summarized  using 
descriptive statistics: mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range and minimum and maximum values. Categorical variables will be summarized using number of subjects and proportion expressed as percentage. Baseline value for any specified variable is the last valid 
measurement before the administration of the study drug. Unless otherwise indicated, statistical significance will be declared if the two -sided p value is ≤ 0.05. All statistical 
analyses will be performed using SAS® Version 9.3 or higher.  
Two-sided paired t-test will be used to compare biomarkers expressions between pre and post 
treatment samples. ANOVA and Kruskal -Wallis tests will be used to compare the degree of 
biomarker changes between the treatment groups. The proportion of patients with objective response will be estimated with exact 95% confidence intervals. Changes in pharmacodynamic endpoints will be correlated with response using Fisher exact test.  
Missing Data Handling  
Unresolved missing data may be imputed when the analysis integrity is affected. The conservative principle will be used for data imputation. For example, if an adverse event onset day is missing but the adverse event onset year and month can not exclude this adverse event as a TEAE, the adverse event will  be flagged as a TEAE.  
11.2.1 Safety Analyses 
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all adverse events and serious adverse events, the regular monitoring of hematology, blood chemistry and urine values, regular measurement of vital signs and the performance of physical examinations. These assessments should be performed within ±2 days of the scheduled day of assessment except for adverse events that will be evaluated continuously through the study. Safety and tolerability will be assessed acc ording to the NIH/NCI CTC

Clinical Study Protocol  
Investigational Drug Substance: Durvalumab and Tremelimumab  
Study Number ESR-14-10531 /WINSHIP3112- 15; Edition Number 3.1; Date 09/16/2016 
 
The occurrence of adverse events graded accor ding to NCI CTCAE v. 4.3 criteria will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics. As far as possible, each adverse event should be 
evaluated to determine:  
1. The type and severity using CTCAE v. 4.0 criteria  
2. Its relationship to the study drug(s) (suspected/not suspected) 
3. Its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam 
 
11.2.2 Efficacy Analyses 
The PFS will be measured from initiation of systemic therapy to first documented disease progression by RECIST criteria  
PFS based on irRC guidelines will also be assessed.  Primary response assessment will be based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. Immune- related response 
criteria will also be assessed.  
Data on patient demographics, tumor characteristics, response rate and pharmacod ynamic 
(PD) biomarkers will be summarized using descriptive statistics. OS and PFS time will be 
analyzed using Kaplan Meier method . The proportion of patients with objective response will 
be estimated with exact 95% confidence intervals.  
Comparisons will b e performed between all patients  (pooled across both arms) and historical 
control (topotecan) in terms of PFS and ORR. In addition, Arm 1 vs Arm II will be compared 
in terms of PFS  and ORR, and possibly OS etc. Exploratory comparison of each Arm  vs 
histor ical control will also be conducted. 
 
11.2.3 Exploratory Analyses 
Two-sided paired t- test will be used to compare biomarker differences between timed samples 
e.g. pre and post treatment samples. Pharmacodynamic biomarkers will also be correlated with 
efficacy. ANOVA and Kruskal- Wallis tests will be used to compare the degree of biomarker 
changes between the treatment groups and between various components of the FACT- L QoL 
questionnaire. Changes in pharmacodynamic endpoints will be correlated with efficacy (PFS, ORR, irRR) using Fisher exact test.

11.3 Determination of sample size  
For sample size determination, efficacy comparison was based on historical data with 
topotecan. Assuming a median PFS of 3 months if the intervention is no better than the 
historical PFS associated with topotecan based on the PFS from two recent randomized phase III studies of topotecan (Evans et al., 2015; von Pawel et al., 2014) , and a promising median 
PFS of 7 months if the investigational treatment is superior (based on the duration of response 
recorded in a phase II study of combined PD -1 and CTLA -4 blockade in relapsed SCLC), 10 
patients treated in each arm of the study will provide 87% power to demonstrate the 
hypothesized efficacy improvement at  a 1 -sided 10% alpha level test.  
Similarly, with the same sample size of 10 patients in each arm, we will have 64% power at a 1-sided alpha of 10% to demonstrate a  promising response rate of 30% for the investigational 
therapy versus the historical response rate of 10% with topotecan in the same patient 
population. Assuming an observed response rate of 30% (3 out of 10 patients) the 95% exact confidence interval of the response rate will be [6.7%, 65.2%] and 90% exact confidence 
internal of the response rate will be [8.7%, 60.7%].  
12. ETHICAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  
12.1 Ethical conduct of the study  
The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that h ave their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with ICH/Good Clinical Practice, and applicable 
regulatory requirements . Copies of the Declaration of Helsinki and amendments will be 
provided upon request or can be accessed via the website of the World Medical Association at http://www.wma.net/e/policy/17 -c_e.html.  
12.2 Ethics and regulatory review 
The Emory University Institutional Review Board (IRB) will have oversight responsibility 
and must approve the final study protocol, including the final version of the ICF and any other written information and/or materials to be provided to the patients. The protocol will be re-approved by the EC/IRB annually or at any other interval deemed appropriate by the IRB.  
AstraZeneca will provide Regulatory Authorities, ECs/IRBs, and Principal Investigators with safety updates or reports according to local requirements. Each Principal Investigator is responsible for providing the EC/IRB with reports of any serious and unexpected adverse drug reactions from any  other study conducted with the IP. AstraZeneca will provide this 
information to the Principal Investigator so that he/she can meet these reporting requirements.

Study Number ESR-14-10531 /WINSHIP3112- 15; Edition Number 3.1; Date 09/16/2016 
 
12.3 Informed consent  
The investigator must explain to each subject (or legally authorized representative) the nature 
of the study, its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, the potential risks and benefits involved and any discomfort it may entail. Each subject must be informed that participation in the study is voluntary and that he /she may withdraw from the study at any 
time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or 
relationship with the treating physician.  
This informed consent should be given by means of a standard written statement, wr itten in 
non-technical language. The subject should read and consider the statement before signing and 
should be given a copy of the signed document. If the subject cannot read or sign the 
documents, oral presentation may be made or signature given by the subject’s legally 
appointed representative, if witnessed by a person not involved in the study, mentioning that 
the patient could not read or sign the documents. No patient can enter the study before his/her informed consent has been obtained. The informed consent form is considered to be part of 
the protocol, and must be submitted by the investigator with it for IRB/IEC/REB approval. 
12.4 Changes to the protocol and informed consent form  
Any change or addition (excluding administrative) to this protocol requires a written protocol 
amendment that must be reviewed by AstraZeneca and the investigator before implementation. Amendments significantly affecting the safety of subjects, the scope of the investigation or the scientific quality of the study require additio nal approval by the FDA and  
IRB.  Examples of amendments requiring such approval are: 
1. Increases in drug dose or duration of exposure of subjects, 2. Significant changes in the study design (e.g. addition or deletion of a control group), 3. Increases in the number of invasive procedures 
4. Addition or deletions of a test procedure required for monitoring of safety. 
These requirements for approval should in no way prevent any immediate action from being taken by 
the investigator in the interests of preserv ing the safety of all patients included in the trial.  If an 
immediate change to the protocol is felt to be necessary by the investigator and is implemented for 
safety reasons Astra Zeneca must be notified and the IRB at the center must be informed immediately.

Study Number ESR-14-10531 /WINSHIP3112- 15; Edition Number 3.1; Date 09/16/2016 
 
Investigators must enter study data onto case report forms (CRFs) or other data collection 
system. The Investigator will permit study -related audits by Emory IRB, and regulatory 
inspection(s) (e.g., FDA, EMEA, TPP), providing direct access to the facilities where the 
study took place, to source documents, to CRFs, and to all other study documents. 
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available at some 
time during audits to review data and resolve any queries and to allow direct access to the subject’s records (e.g., medical records, office charts, hospital charts, and study related charts) for source data verification. The data collection must be completed prior to each visit and be made available to the Novartis representative so that the accuracy and completeness may be checked.  
13.1 Training of study site personnel  
The study PI (sponsor- investigator) will provide training as appropriate to the delegated 
responsibility to all staffs involved in the conduct of the study. Before the first patient is enrolled in the study, study staff and co-investigators will review and discuss the requirements of the clinical study protocol and related documents including getting trained in any study-specific procedures and electronic data capture systems to be utilized.  
The Sponsor- Investigator will ensure that appropriate training relevant to the study is given to 
all of these staff and any new information relevant to the performance of this study is forwarded  to the staff involved. The Principal Investigator will maintain a record of all 
individuals involved in the study (medical, nursing, and other staff). 
13.2 Monitoring of the study  
13.2.1 Source data  and documents  
In accord with section 1.51 of the ICH E6 document all  information in original records and 
certified copies of original records or clinical findings, observations, or other activities 
necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial is considered source data. Source 
data are contained in source documents, which can be original records or certified copies of 
hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects' diaries of evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi es or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate and 
complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject 
files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico- technical 
depart ments involved in the clinical trial.  
Case Report Forms (CRFs) - Source data may be collected in the source documents or entered 
directly onto the case report forms.

Study Number ESR-14-10531 /WINSHIP3112- 15; Edition Number 3.1; Date 09/16/2016 
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) of the Winship C ancer Institute will 
provide oversight for the conduct of this study.  The DSMC functions independently within 
Winship Cancer Institute to conduct internal monitoring functions to ensure that research 
being conducted by Winship Cancer Institute Investigators produces high- quality scientific 
data in a manner consistent with good clinical practice (GCP) and appropriate regulations that govern clinical research. Depending on the risk level of the protocol, the DSMC review may 
occur every 6 months or annually.  For studies deemed High Risk, initial study monitoring 
will occur within 6 months from the date of the first subject accrued, with 2 of the first 5 
subjects being reviewed.  For studies deemed Moderate Risk, initial study monitoring will occur within 1 ye ar from the date of the first subject accrued, with 2 of the first 5 subjects 
being reviewed.  Subsequent monitoring will occur in routine intervals per the Winship Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP).  
The DSMC will review pertinent aspects of the stud y to assess subject safety, compliance with 
the protocol, data collection, and risk- benefit ratio. Specifically, the Winship Cancer Institute 
Internal Monitors assigned to the DSMC may verify informed consent, eligibility, data entry, 
accuracy and availabi lity of source documents, AEs/SAEs, and essential regulatory 
documents.  Following the monitoring review, monitors will provide a preliminary report of monitoring findings to the PI and other pertinent individuals involved in the conduct of the 
study. The PI is required to address and respond to all the deficiencies noted in the preliminary 
report. Prior to the completion of the final summary report, monitors will discuss the preliminary report responses with the PI and other team members (when appropriate).  A final monitoring summary report will then be prepared by the monitor. Final DSMC review will 
include the final monitoring summary report with corresponding PI response, submitted 
CAPA (when applicable), PI Summary statement, and available aggregate toxicity and safety data.   
The DSMC will render a recommendation and rating based on the overall trial conduct. The PI is responsible for ensuring that instances of egregious data insufficiencies are reported to 
the IRB. Continuing Review submissions will include the DSMC recommenda tion letter.  
Should any revisions be made to the protocol -specific monitoring plan after initial DSMC 
approval, the PI will be responsible for notifying the DSMC of such changes.  The Committee 
reserves the right to conduct additional audits if necessary.   
13.2.3 Data Safety and Quality Assessment 
Data safety and quality assurance plan for this study will follow the established Data Safety and Monitoring Plan for all investigator -initiated clinical trials at the Winship  (please refer

Electronic case report forms and study calendar will be generated prior to study activation.  
14.1 Disclosure and confidentiality  
The investigator will keep all information provided by AstraZeneca in strict confidence and will request similar confidentiality from his/her staff and the IRB/IEC/REB. Study documents 
provided by AstraZeneca (investigators' brochures and other material) will be stored appropriately to ensure their confidentiality. The information provided to the investigator may not be disclosed to others without direct writ ten authorization from AstraZeneca, except to the 
extent necessary to obtain informed consent from patients who wish to participate in the trial. 
14.2 Study records requirements  
The Investigator must ensure that the records and documents pertaining to the conduct of the study and the distribution of the protocol therapy, that is copies of CRFs and source documents (original documents, data, and records [e.g., hospital records; clinical and office 
charts; laboratory notes; memoranda; subject’s diaries or evaluati on checklists; SAE reports, 
pharmacy dispensing records; recorded data from automated instruments; copies or 
transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate copies; microfiches; photographic negatives, microfilm, or magnetic media; x -rays; su bject files; and records kept at the 
pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments involved in the clinical 
study; documents regarding subject treatment and drug accountability; original signed informed consents, etc.]) be retained by the Investigator for as long as needed to comply with national and international regulations (generally 2 years after discontinuing clinical 
development or after the last marketing approval).

APPENDIX 3: Durvalumab DOSE CALCULATIONS  
For durvalumab dosing done depending on subject weight: 
1. Cohort dose: X mg/kg 2. Subject weight: Y kg 3. Dose for subject: XY mg = X (mg/kg) × Y (kg) 
4. Dose to be added into infusion bag:  Dose (mL) = XY mg / 50 (mg/mL)  
where 50 mg/mL is durvalumab nominal concentration. The corresponding volume of durvalumab should be rounded to the nearest tenth mL (0.1 
mL). Dose adjustments for each cycle are only needed for greater than 10% change in weight.  
5. The theoretical number of vials required for dose preparation is the next greatest whole 
number of vials from the following formula: 
Number of vials = Dose (mL) / 10.0 (mL/vial) 
Examp le:  
1. Cohort dose: 10 mg/kg 
2. Subject weight: 30 kg 
3. Dose for subject: 300 mg = 10 (mg/kg) × 30 (kg) 
4. Dose to be added into infusion bag:  Dose (mL) = 300 mg / 50 (mg/mL) = 6.0 mL 
5. The theoretical number of vials required for dose preparation:  
Number of vials = 6.0 (mL) / 10.0 (mL/vial) = 1 vials

mL). Dose adjustments for each cycle are only needed for greater than 10%  change in weight.  
5. The theoretical number of vials required for dose preparation is the next greatest whole 
number of vials from the following formula: 
Number of vials = Dose (mL) / 20.0 (mL/vial) 
Example:  
1. Cohort dose: 1 mg/kg 
2. Subject weight: 30 kg  
3. Dose for subject: 30 mg = 1 (mg/kg) × 30 (kg) 4. Dose to be added into infusion bag:  Dose (mL) = 30 mg / 20 (mg/mL) = 1.5 mL

APPENDIX 7: cfDNA Lab Blood Processing Protocol (version 122314  from 
Diehn’s Lab ) 
 Materials  (check to make sure you have all of it before you start)  
• Filtered P2000 pipette tips  
• P-2000 pipette 
• 2.0-mL Eppendorf tubes 
• Patient’s blood - usually 30 mL in 3 “purple top” tubes (EDTA) per time point. Blood 
should be kept on ice or in refrigerator after drawing and processed as soon as possible 
to minimize lysis of WBCs and release of cellular genomic DNA into plasma  
 
 Methods  
1. Spin samples in the clinical centrifuge using the settings: 3,500rpm, 10min, 4C 
2. While you wait, label tubes  
3. After spinning, carefully  remove lavender top tubes from centrifuge. Do not disturb 
the separated plasma and cell -free whole blood 
i. Tip: It helps to put all the tubes into one holder an d carefully carry the 
holder to the hood 
4. Using a filtered tip and p -2000 pipet aliquot ~1.8 mL clear plasma (not all the way to 
the top since tops of tubes tend to pop open upon freezing if filled all the way) into a 
2.0 mL Eppendorf tube. Repeat until you have aliquotted the plasma from all the purple-top tubes into 2.0 mL Eppendorf tubes. With the tubes that have only the buffy coat and RBC remaining, mix the buffy coat and cell -free whole blood using a pipette 
tip and aliquot ~1.8 mL into a 2.0 mL Eppendorf tube. Repeat so you have a second 2.0 mL Eppendorf tube containing the buffy coat and RBC mixed together. 
5. Put Eppendorf tubes into - 80C freezer.  
6. Record # of plasma tubes stored, date of blood draw, time of blood draw, and time 
of storage . 
7. Samples will be shipped to the lab of Max Diehn at Stanford University for cfDNA 
analysis using CAPP -Seq technology.

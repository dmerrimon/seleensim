Title  A Phase II study of Pembrol izumab as Post -remission Treatment of 
Patients > 60 with AML Who Are Not Transplantation Candidates  
Short Title  Pembrolizumab as Maintenance Therapy for AML in CR1  
Protocol Number   
Phase  Phase II  
Methodology  Open label  
Study Center(s)  Single -center  
Primary Objective  To evaluate the time to relapse (TTR) in patients > 60 years with AML  in 
complete remission undergoing post -remission therapy with 
pembrolizumab.  
Number of Subjects  40 subjects  
Diagnosis and Main Inclusion 
Criteria  Patients with AML in first complete remission/complete remission with 
incomplete count recovery who are not unable or unwilling to undergo 
allogeneic stem cell transplant or who allogeneic stem cell transplant is 
not indicated.  
Study Product, Dose, Route, 
Regimen  Pembrolizumab, intravenous, 200mg, every 3 weeks with dosing 
adjustments as needed for toxicity  
Duration of administration  Total duration of pembrolizumab is up to 2 years if patients tolerate the 
therapy and remain in complete remission  
Reference therapy  Patients who achieve a complete response to induction chemotherapy 
followed by chemotherapy consolidation therapy who do not undergo 
allogeneic transplant are observed. Despite the high relapse rates in this 
group, there is not therapy that has been proven to be effective to prevent 
relapse.  
Statistical Methodology  The relapse  function  will be estimated  by using  the Kaplan -Meier  method. 
A 26% two -year TTR under the standard induction therapy is associated 
with a median  of 12.3 months.  The null hypothesis  that the treatment  with 
pembrolizumab  offers  no increase  in TTR  will be tested  by determining  if 
12.3 months is within an 80% confidence interval around the median, a 
one-sided α=0.10 test.  
Estimated Enrollment Period  18-24 months  
Estimated duration of trial  4 years, but with planned analysis at 18 months after last patient enrolled  
Duration of Participation  2 years/patient  
Version 5, dated 06/03/2019  8  
1.0 TRIAL DESIGN 
Trial Design  
This is a phase II, single -center, single -arm trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
pembrolizumab in post -remission treatment of patients ≥ 60 years with AML who are not 
candidates  for HCT.  Patients  must  have  achieved  CR or CRi with induction  chemotherapy  and 
have an ECOG performance status of 0 -1. Patients can receive no consolidation or up to 4 
cycles of consolidation per treating physicians’ preference. Patients are eligible if their last 
dose of chemotherapy was received within 3 months of trial enrollment. Rema ining in CR or 
CRi is required  prior  to enrollment.  The enrollment  target  for this study  is 40 patients  evaluable 
for efficacy. Planned analysis will occur 18 months after the initiation of treatment of the last 
patient on the  trial.

3.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONALE 
Background  
3.1.1 Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic  Background  
 
The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decades [1]. Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies [2; 3; 4; 5; 6]. In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio 
of CD8+  effector  T-cells / FoxP3+  regulatory  T-cells (Treg)  seems  to correlate  with improved 
prognosis and long -term survival in many solid  tumors.  
 
The PD -1 receptor -ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress 
immune control. The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T- 
cells under  healthy  conditions,  is to down -modulate  unwanted  or excessive  immune  responses,  

Version 5, dated 06/03/2019  10  including autoimmune reactions. PD -1 (encoded by the gene Pdcd1) is an Ig superfamily 
member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 and has been shown to negatively regulate antigen 
receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2) [7; 8]. The structure 
of murine PD -1 has been resolved [9]. PD -1 and family members are type I transmembrane 
glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable -type (V -type) domain responsible for l igand binding 
and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling molecules. The 
cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor 
tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosi ne-based switch motif 
(ITSM). Following T -cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases SHP -1 and 
SHP-2 to the ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the dephosphorylation of 
effector molecules such as CD3ζ, PKCθ and ZAP70 which are  involved in the CD3 T -cell 
signaling cascade [7; 10; 11; 12]. The mechanism by which PD -1 down modulates T -cell 
responses is similar to, but distinct from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules regulate an 
overlapping set of signaling proteins [13;  14]. 
 
PD-1 was shown to be expressed on activated lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and 
CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, T regs and Natural Killer cells [15; 16]. Expression has also been 
shown during thymic development on CD4 -CD8 - (double negative) T -cells as well as subse ts 
of macrophages and dendritic cells [17]. The ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are 
constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non - 
hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors [18; 19; 20; 13]. Both ligands a re type I 
transmembrane  receptors  containing  both IgV- and IgC-like domains  in the extracellular  region 
and contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs. Binding of either  PD- 
1 ligand to PD -1 inhibits T -cell activation triggered through the T -cell receptor. PD -L1 is 
expressed at low levels on various non -hematopoietic tissues, most notably on vascular 
endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antige n-presenting cells 
found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments. PD -L2 is thought to control 
immune T -cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted 
T-cell function in peripheral tissues [13]. Although healt hy organs express little (if any) PD- 
L1, a variety of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T -cell inhibitor. 
PD-1 has been suggested to regulate tumor -specific T -cell expansion in subjects with 
melanoma (MEL) [21]. This suggests th at the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway plays a critical role in 
tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic 
intervention.  
 
Pembrolizumab  is a potent  and highly  selective  humanized  monoclonal  antibody  (mAb)  of the 
IgG4/kappa iso type designed to directly block the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands, 
PD-L1 and PD -L2. KeytrudaTM (Pembrolizumab) has recently been approved in the United 
Stated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease 
progression following ipilumumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF  inhibitor.  
 
3.1.2 Clinical Trial  Data  
 
Pembrolizumab is currently being investigated in a number of clinical trials in many solid 
tumors and hematologic malignancies. In the first open -label Phase I trial (PN001) of 
pembrolizumab in progressive or locally advanced metastatic carcinomas, enriched for 
melanoma and non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The overall response rate across all dose  
Version 5, dated 06/03/2019  11  levels (2mg/kg every 3 weeks, 10mg/kg every 3 weeks, and 10mg/kg every 2 weeks) ranged 
from  26% for the melanoma  patients  previously  exposed  to ipilumimab  [22] and 38.7%  for the 
melanoma patients not previously exposed to ipilumimab (Investigator’s Brochure). The 
median PFS and PFS at 24 weeks in the patients exposed to ipilumimab was 17.5 weeks and 
41.7% and 28.4 weeks and 52.2% in the patients not exposed to ipilumimab. These overall 
response rate data demonstrate that pembrolizumab is active in the treatment of advanced 
melanoma.  Similar  promising  response  rates  in NSCLC  were  seen,  with an objective  response 
rate of 21%, with a median progression free survival not yet reached with a minimum of 62 
weeks, with most responders remaining on  treatment.  
 
Pembrolizumab has been generally well-tolerated with manageable side effects in most 
patients. Safety data from PN001 is available on 479 patients, all of whom received the last 
dose of medication  by July 26, 2013.  In the dose-escalation  portion  of the study,  no DLTs  were 
reported  and the MTD  was not identified.  In the full patient  cohort,  nearly  all patients  (97.3%) 
experienced adverse events (AEs), of which 76.8% were considered drug related. Serious 
adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 30.1% of patients, but were considered potenti ally 
drug-related  in 6.7%  of patients.  Furthermore,  there  were  no patient  deaths  attributable  to study 
medication.  
 
Adverse events were similar between dose schedules and disease groups. In melanoma 
patients, the most common drug -related adverse events of any grade were fatigue (34%), 
pruritus (22%), rash (18%), diarrhea (15%), arthralgia (13%) and nausea (11%). Grade 3 -5 
drug-related AEs were reported in 11% of melanoma patients, with fatigue and diarrhea the 
most commonly reported, experienced in 1.7% and  0.7% of patients, respectively. Immune - 
related adverse events also routinely occurred in patients on pembrolizumab. In melanoma 
patients, the most commonly reported immune -related AEs include rash (3.2%), pruritis 
(2.9%), vitiligo (2.9%), hypothyroidism (2.7%), arthralgia (2.2%), diarrhea (2.2.%),  and 
pneumonitis (1.9%). NSCLC patients experienced similar drug -related adverse events: rash 
(21%),  pruritis  (18%),  fatigue  (16%),  diarrhea  (13%),  and arthralgia  (11%).  The only Grade  3- 
5 AE experienced in the NSCLC group was pulmonary edema occurring in 1 patient (2.6%). 
Immune -related AEs in NSCLC patients occurred in 3 of 38 patients (7.9%), and included 
hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, pruritis, and rash in one patient each, and diarrhea i n 2 
patients. Most patients enrolled on PN001 did not discontinue study medication to due AEs. 
9.4%  discontinued  due to an AE, but only 4.2%  of patients  discontinued  due to an AE that was 
considered related to study  treatment.  
 
Rationale  
 
3.2.1 Rationale for the Trial and Selected Subject  Population  
 
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignant hematopoietic disorder characterized by the 
unregulated growth of myeloid precursors (blasts) and associated marked reduction in normal 
hematopoiesis. It is the most common acute leukemia in adults, with an estimated 18,860  new 
cases of AML diagnosed per year in the United State and 10,460 deaths. [23] Disease related 
morbidity and mortality arise from cytopenias, leading to complications such as bleeding 
and/or infection, as well as end organ damage from the circulating blasts. If left untreated, 
AML can lead to death within weeks.  [24] 

Version 5, dated 06/03/2019  12  The standard treatment for newly diagnosed AML consists primarily of an anthracycline 
comb ined with a nucleoside analogue, cytarabine. The goal of remission induction 
chemotherapy is the rapid restoration of normal bone marrow function. [25] Once a complete 
remission is attained, relapse invariably occurs without additional consolidation therap y. 
Consolidation approaches are based on prognosis and age, but may include 1 -4 cycles of high 
dose cytarabine chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplant. While consolidation therapy 
reduces relapse, up to 50% of younger patients still relapse. [26]  
 
Although standard therapeutic approaches are tailored to younger patients, the median age of 
diagnosis  of acute  myelogenous  leukemia  (AML)  is 67 years.  [27] Unfortunately,  the outcomes 
for patients older than 60 years are quite poor. Population studies in AML report 5 -year 
survival rates of 3% to 8% compared to up to 50% for younger patients. [28] Intensive 
induction therapy, as described above, remains the standard of care for those elderly patients 
who are able to tolerate it, but rates of complete remiss ion (CR) range from 20% to 60% 
dependent on the number of adverse prognostic conditions present. [29] The 2 -year DFS of 
patients  >60 yrs of age with AML  who undergo  induction  therapy  has been  consistently  at 24- 
26% in two large  studies  conducted  in 2001  and 2010.  [30; 31] Unfortunately,  there  have been 
no important advances in induction therapy since  then.  
 
Although patients >60 years old can obtain a morphologic CR, defined as hematopoietic 
recovery  with <5% blasts  present,  relapse  still occurs  in up to 80% of these  patients.  [32] These 
high relapse  rates  demonstrates  that the majority  of patients  >60 years  old have  submicroscopic 
residual disease (MRD), leading to subsequent relapse. Reduced intensity conditioned (RIC) 
allogeneic  stem  cell transplant  (HCT)  offers  a survival  benefit  when  performed  after induction 
chemotherapy for a proportion of patients with high -risk AML. [33; 34; 35] Unfortunately, 
transplant -related mortality remains high in elderly patients and those with multiple 
como rbidities, limiting the availability of this consolidation approach for many patients over 
the age of 60. [35] In a prospective study aimed to offer RIC transplant to all eligible patients 
with high -risk AML over age 50, only 15% of patients in CR proceeded with allogeneic stem 
cell transplant. [36] New strategies to prevent relapse in older patients who are not eligible or 
willing to undergo an allogeneic transplant are desperately  needed.  
 
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has historically been sensiti ve to immunotherapy. The graft - 
versus -leukemia (GVL) effect of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) is a 
well-established,  successful  form  of immunotherapy.  AML  is the most  common  indication  for 
HCT  in North  America.  [37] Donor  lymphocyte  infusions  performed  for relapsed  AML,  which 
rely solely on the GVL effect, lead to complete remission (CR) rates of 15 -29%. [38; 39] The 
CRs attained through DLI are frequently durable.  [40] 
 
Despite the sensitivity of AML to immune attack, the microenviron ment in AML is 
immunosuppressive, facilitating immune tolerance of leukemia cells. In vitro studies have 
demonstrated  that factors  secreted  by primary  AML  cells,  particularly  arginase  II, can prevent 
T-cell activation and proliferation. [41; 42] Tregs are also critical mediators of 
immunosuppression  in AML.  [43] Increased  Tregs  are present  in patients  with AML  at various 
stages of diagnosis and treatment. Tregs are increased at diagnosis in patients with AML 
compared to healthy controls [44; 45; 46] and  higher frequencies at diagnosis are associated 
with a poor prognosis. [44; 45] Early recovery from both cytotoxic chemotherapy  and 
Version 5, dated 06/03/2019  13  maintenance therapy for AML also led to increased frequencies of functional 
immunosuppressive Tregs. [47; 48]  
 
PD-1 and its ligands have emerged as an important contributor to the immunosuppressive 
microenvironment in AML. Many preclinical studies have demonstrated upregulation of the 
PD-1 pathway and the negative impact that it has on disease control in AML. In m ice injected 
with a strain of AML, the percentage of CD8 T -cells expressing PD -1 dramatically increased 
in the liver, a major site of disease for AML dissemination. [49] Similarly, when AML cells 
are injected  into mice  and allowed  to grow  in the mouse,  PD-L1 expression  increases  compared 
to baseline. [50] Furthermore, PD -1 knock -out mice with AML have slower progression of 
AML  burden  than wild-type (WT)  mice  and significantly  longer  survival.  [49; 50] When  a PD- 
1 blocking antibody is administered  to WT mice with AML, those mice have a lower AML 
burden, more CD8+ cells infiltrating the liver, and longer survival.  [50] 
 
PD-1 and its ligands are also upregulated on immune cells and leukemic cells in humans with 
AML. One study of 124 patients with myeloid malignancies, including 69 with 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and 9 with AML sampled at various stages of treatment 
found that PD -L1 mRNA expression level was upregulated by >2 fold in 36% and 25% of 
CD34+ cells of those with MDS and AML respectively compared to CD34+ normal control 
cells. [51] Another cohort of 154 patients with AML demonstrated no significant increase in  
surface PD -L1 expression on AML blasts at initial diagnosis compared to myeloid precursors 
cells from healthy controls. However, stimulation with IFN - significantly increased PD -L1 
expression in AML blasts but not in myeloid precursors from normal contro ls. [52] 
Interestingly, PD -L1 expression increased more dramatically with IFN - stimulation from 
samples of myeloid precursors cells from patients in complete remission or at relapse than 
newly diagnosed patients. [52] These findings demonstrate that PD -L1 expression on AML 
blasts definitely occurs in a substantial portion of patients with AML. Understanding of the 
timing of expression requires more study larger cohorts where PD -1 and its ligands are 
measured longitudinally. However, existing data suggests the PD -1 pathway, like the Treg 
population in AML, [48] may be particularly increased upon recovery from cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. [52]  
 
PD-L1 expression on AML blasts pre -treatment does not appear to have prognostic 
significance in small cohorts of patients  with AML. In 72 patients with MDS and AML  tested 
prior to any treatment, PD -L1 expression in bone marrow samples was not associated with 
worse  survival.  [51] However,  in a smaller  cohort  of those  72 patients  treated  on a clinical  trial 
with hypomethylating  agents  and vorinostat,  development  of PD-L1 or PD-L2 upregulation  on 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells during therapy was associated with a significantly worse 
median survival, 6.6 months compared to 11.7 months in those with without overe xpression 
of PD -1 ligands. [51] Similarly, Norde et al. found that in patients who relapsed late after 
allogeneic transplant despite the presence of circulating alloreactive T -cells to hematopoietic 
cell-restricted  minor  histocompatibility  antigens,  PD-L1 was highly  expressed  on the leukemic 
cells at baseline or upon stimulating with IFN -. [53] Furthermore, stimulation of allogeneic 
CD3+ T -cells with those PD -L1-expressing AML cells led to significantly enhanced T -cell 
proliferation  and cytokine  production  when  performed  in presence  of PD-1 blockade  compared 
to isotype controls. [53] These findings suggest that the development of functionally  impaired  
Version 5, dated 06/03/2019  14  T-cells during therapy through manipulation of the PD -1 checkpoint leads to impaire d control 
of leukemia, and that PD -1 blockade may offer therapeutic  advantages.  
 
In summary,  patients  >60 years  old with AML  have  a dismal  prognosis.  Even  though  many  of 
these patients are able to obtain a CR, relapse occurs in the vast majority of patient s. RIC 
transplant may reduce relapse rates in this population, but is only feasible in a minority of 
patients. AML’s immunosuppressive microenvironment in general and PD -1/PD -L1 
upregulation in particular appears to increase the risk of relapse. Importantl y, PD -1 and its 
ligands are particularly increased after therapy compared to initial diagnosis. As such, PD -1 
inhibition with pembrolizumab offers to limit leukemic cell immune escape, thereby allowing 
the patient’s immune system to eradicate the submicros copic residual disease and reducing 
relapse  rates.  
 
3.2.2 Rationale for Dose  Selection/Regimen/Modification  
 
An open -label  Phase  I trial (Protocol  001) is being  conducted  to evaluate  the safety  and clinical 
activity of single agent pembrolizumab. The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated 
three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in 
subjects with advanced solid tumors. All three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose - 
limiting toxicities were observed.  This first in human study of pembrolizumab showed 
evidence  of target  engagement  and objective  evidence  of tumor  size reduction  at all dose levels 
(1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W). No MTD has been identified to date. 10.0 mg/kg 
Q2W,  the highest  dose tested in PN001,  was the dose and schedule  utilized  in Cohorts  A, B, C 
and D of this protocol to test for initial tumor activity. Recent data from other clinical studies 
within the pembrolizumab program has shown that a lower dose of pembrolizumab and a less 
frequent schedule may be sufficient for target engagement and clinical  activity.  
 
PK data analysis of pembrolizumab administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic 
clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half -life (refe r to Investigator  Brochure). 
Pharmacodynamic data (IL -2 release assay) suggested that peripheral target engagement is 
durable  (>21  days).  This early  PK and pharmacodynamic  data provides  scientific  rationale  for 
testing a Q3W dosing  schedule.  
 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using serum concentration time 
data from 476 patients. Within the resulting population PK model, clearance and volume 
parameters of pembrolizumab were found to be dependent on body weight. The relationship 
betwee n clearance and body weight, with an allometric exponent of 0.59, is within the range 
observed for other antibodies and would support both body weight normalized dosing or a 
fixed  dose across  all body  weights.  Pembrolizumab  has been  found  to have  a wide  therapeutic 
range based on the melanoma indication. The differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed  dose 
regimen  relative  to a 2 mg/kg  Q3W  body  weight  based  regimen  are anticipated  to remain  well 
within the established exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for  pembrolizumab in the melanoma 
indication. The exposure margins are based on the notion of similar efficacy and safety in 
melanoma  at 10 mg/kg  Q3W  vs. the proposed  dose regimen  of 2 mg/kg  Q3W  (i.e. 5-fold higher 
dose and exposure). The population PK evaluation revealed that there was no significant 
impact  of tumor  burden  on exposure.  In addition,  exposure  was similar  between  the NSCLC  
Version 5, dated 06/03/2019  15  and melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure between 
different indi cation settings.  
 
The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of Pembrolizumab in 
solid tumors was based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of Pembrolizumab when dosed at 
either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat  exposure -response 
relationships of Pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg 
Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution 
behavior of Pembrolizumab (as assesse d by the population PK model) and 4) the assumption 
that the dynamics  of Pembrolizumab  target  engagement  will not vary meaningfully  with tumor 
type.  
 
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based 
on simulations performed using the population PK model of Pembrolizumab showing that the 
fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent 
with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain indiv idual patient 
exposures  in the exposure  range  established  in melanoma  as associated  with maximal  efficacy 
response and 3) will maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure range established 
in melanoma that are well tolerated and  safe. 
 
A fixed do se regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians 
and to reduce potential for dosing errors. A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexity 
in the logistical chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage.  
 
3.2.3 Rationale for  Endpoints  
 
3.2.3.1  Efficacy  Endpoints  
 
3.2.3.1.1  Primary Endpoint: Time to relapse  (TTR)  
 
The primary  endpoint  for this study  is time to relapse  (TTR).  Patients  with AML  >60 years  old 
in CR have  a high relapse  rate, which  is the primary  cause  of death.  The goal of PD-1 inhibition 
in AML is to harness the patient’s immune system to eradicate submicroscopic disease and 
prevent relapse. As such, TTR was selected as the primary efficacy endpoint. TTR has been 
used as the endpoint in many similar clinical trials, and using th is endpoint allow for valid 
comparison to historical controls. TTR is defined as survival in the absence of relapse, as 
defined by the Cheson criteria (see Section  12.3).  
 
3.2.3.1.2  Second Efficacy Endpoints: Overall Survival  
 
Overall survival is limited in AML, and the goal of all new therapy options in AML is to 
enhance overall survival. However, overall survival may be altered by subsequent therapy 
choices  after relapse.  As such,  it will be measured  as a secondary  but not the primary  endpoint.  
 
3.2.3.2  Biomarker  Research  
 
Under  normal  physiologic  conditions,  check -point  inhibition  is a protective  mechanism  which 
prevents  expansion  of dangerous  T cells capable  of harming  normal  tissues.  Tumors,  including  
Version 5, dated 06/03/2019  16  PD-L1+ AML  blasts,  have  corrupted  this protective  pathway  by “bombarding”  PD-1+ T cells, 
including anti -leukemia T cells, with the ligand overexpressed on AML blasts, thus inducing 
functional T -cell paralysis. The so called “exhaustion” of anti -leukemic T cells is, in fact, 
tumor -driven, chronically silencing activated T cells which are unable to mediate anti - 
leukemia activity in the tumor  environment.  
One objective  of pembrolizumab  therapy  in AML  is to rescue  anti-leukemia  T cells from  blast - 
mediated chronic check -point inhibit ion by targeting PD -1 and allowing T cells to exercise 
anti-AML blast activity. Another objective is to decrease immune suppression mediated by 
regulatory  T cells (Treg)  which  are increased  in the frequency  and activity  in AML.  [44] Treg, 
especially  activated  Treg  present  in patients  with cancer,  express  PD-1 and it is likely  that they 
are targeted by pembrolizumab via up -regulated antibody -mediated cellular cytotoxicity 
(ADCC). It is possible that this mechanism is responsible for, or cont ributes to, recovery of 
anti-leukemia T cell activity by removing Treg. As ADCC is largely mediated by Ab -armed 
activated NK cells, their functional recovery from check -point inhibition is an important 
consequence  of pembrolizumab  therapy.  Exosomes  produce d by tumor  cells or leukemic  blasts 
are known to carry immunosuppressive cargo and to contribute to immune dysfunction of T 
cells and NK cells. We have recently observed that plasma -derived exosomes obtained from 
patients with AML carry PD -L1. We, therefore, expect that pembrolizumab would neutralize 
immunosuppressive  exosomes.  
In this study,  we will measure  recovery  in the frequency/absolute  numbers  of activated  immune 
cells and anti -leukemic functions of T cells after pembrolizumab therapy. We wil l measure 
anti-AML reactivity of T cells using autologous AML blast -derived antigens for ex vivo 
activation of T cells. We will monitor changes in the frequency and absolute numbers of Treg 
in the patients’ circulation. In addition, we will study levels an d cargo of exosomes in the 
plasma. The hypothesis is that these immune parameters will be altered following 
pembrolizumab  therapy  and that change  in the immune  cell numbers  and functions  will provide 
insights into cellular mechanisms responsible for potent ial clinical responses observed in the 
proposed  study.  
Blood/tissue  specimens  will be saved  at University  of Pittsburgh  Health  Sciences  Tissue  Bank 
in the Department of Health Sciences Core Research where specimens will be coded using an 
Honest Broker . Correlative studies will be conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Theresa 
Whiteside at the University of Pittsburgh. Blood/tissue specimens will be labeled with study 
number not patient identifiers. Information linking these study numbers with the sub ject’s 
identity will be kept separate from the research records. Any breech in confidentiality will be 
reported to the IRB.  
3.2.3.2.1  Quantitative study of T -cell subsets  
Assay Description:  30ml in non -citrate tubes (heparinized) and 10ml in citrate tube(s) of 
perip heral blood will be obtained at the following time points: at diagnosis, prior to 
pembrolizumab initiation, prior to Cycles 2, 4, 8, 17 (± 1 treatment cycle) , and at disease 
progression or the end of 2 years of treatment, whichever comes first. We will pe rform 
immunofluorescence staining and multiparameter flow cytometry to evaluate expression of 
PD-L1 and PD -1 on blasts and effector cells and changes in the patients’ lymphocyte subsets 
and the expression of their surface receptors at these specific time p oints. The conjugated 
monoclonal antibodies CD 45, 3, 4, 8, 25, 39, 69, 56, FOXP3 and NKp46 will be used in  
Version 5, dated 06/03/2019  17  combinations to evaluate Total CD8+ Tcells and activated T -cells, total and activated CD4+ 
Tcells, total and activated NK cells and Treg.  
Assay  Performance : The frequency  of the aforementioned  T-cell and NK cell subsets  in healthy 
donors is well documented. On the other hand, the frequency of these T and NK cells subset 
in AML patients is incompletely documented. PBMCs from 15 age -matc hed healthy donors 
will be studied as control group. A sample that is positive for above markers will be used as 
the positive control for the staining as well. Isotype controls for all Abs will be used. Flow 
cytometry is an established methodology with wel l-defined accuracy and  precision.  
Data interpretation and considerations : The proportions and absolute numbers of total and 
activated (CD69+/ CD25+) CD8+ T -cells, total and activated CD4+ Tcells, and CD3 -CD56+ 
NK cells in AML  patients  at diagnosis  and prior  to pembrolizumab  will be compared  to values 
obtained  with PBMC  of healthy  donors.  These  values  in AML  patients  are expected  to be lower 
than the established normal, suggesting the presence of T -cell suppression and/or apoptosis. 
Following pembrolizum ab therapy, these values are expected to increase. Tregs 
(CD4+CD39+FOXP3+ and CD4+FOXP3+CD25+PD -1+) are expected to be elevated in 
frequency and absolute numbers in AML patients prior to pembrolizumab therapy. We  expect 
Treg percentages/absolute numbers to  decrease after pembrolizumab therapy based on the 
hypothesis that this Ab targets PD -1+ Treg and eliminates them. Expression of PD -1 is 
expected to decrease after therapy. This would suggest that pembrolizumab restores anti - 
leukemia immune responses not only by removing the checkpoint blockade and allowing for 
immune cell activation but also by removing Treg -mediated  suppression.  
 
3.2.3.2.2  T-cell expression of IFN - γ and Granzyme B/Perforin in T -cells stimulated ex 
vivo with autologous AML blast -derived  antigens  
Assay Description : Cryopreserved PBMCs will be thawed and washed. Autologous AML 
blasts will be separated from PBMCs at diagnosis, cryopreserved and stored. Just prior to the 
assay, AML blasts will be repeatedly frozen/thawed to solu bilize the potentially relevant 
antigens. The protein content of the lysates will be determined. Lysates of autologous AML 
blasts will be used for in vitro stimulation of lymphocytes in PBMC. Antigen -presenting cells 
(APC) in PBMCs will be able to present antigens in the lysate to immune cells. Stimulation 
may be antigen -specific via the Tcell receptor (TCR) on cognate T cells or non -specific via 
TLRs or other receptors on immune cells responding to antigens in the lysate. IFN - γ 
expression by CD8+ T -cells and granzyme B (GrB) and perforin expression by CD8 T -cells 
and NK cells will be measured as previously described. [54] Briefly, lysates of autologous 
blasts will be added to PBMC at 3 different concentrations and incubated for 18 h. Cells 
harvested  from  these cultures  will be incubated  with mAbs  specific  for surface  markers  (CD3, 
CD4, CD8, CD56), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 
20 min at room temperature, washed once with PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumen 
(BSE) and 2 nM ethylene diamine triacetic acid, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% 
BSA  and 0.1%  saponin,  washed  and stained  with pre-titrated  anti-GrB-PE, anti-perforin -FITC, 
and IFN-γ-PE. Flow  cytometry  will be performed  immediately  on a Beckman  Coulter  equipped 
with Expo32 software. Percentages of IFN -γ-positive cells among CD8+ T cells and 
GrB/Perforin -positive CD8+ T cells and CD3 -CD56+NK cells will be  determined.  
Version 5, dated 06/03/2019  18  Assay Performance : This is a two -step assay selected for monitoring  of immune cell (T and 
NK cell) responses to a mix of blast -derived antigens. [54] This is an autologous system,  with 
PBMC serving as APC. The assay can be readily adapted to serial monitoring. PBMC and 
autologous lysates will be cryopreserved and thawed f or culture. Serially -collected  specimens 
of each patient (as described in Section 4.2.3.2.1) will be batched and tested in one assay to 
avoid inter -assay variability. Culture controls set in parallel with patients’ samples will be 
PBMCs of a normal donor ( cryopreserved in bulk to supply the same control for all patients’ 
cultures) stimulated with anti -CD3/CD28 Abs. Also, PBMCs of each evaluated AML patient 
will be stimulated with anti -CD3/CD28 Abs to serve as control for the ability to respond to 
TCR -mediat ed signals. 18h activation was previously shown to be a sufficient time period for 
induction of intra -cytoplasmic cytokines or GrB/perforin expression. [54] Multicolor flow 
cytometry assessments after cell permeabilization and staining with labeled antibod ies to T 
and NK cell surface markers and the relevant cytokines are routinely performed on an 
instrument which is calibrated daily. The SOP for the assay is on  file. 
Data  interpretation  and considerations : This assay  should  be able to inform  us about  the ability 
of AML  patients’  immune  cells to respond  by cytokine  or GrB/perforin  expression  to external 
stimulatory signals. [55] We expect from 10 to 15% of CD8+T cells of a normal donor to 
respond  to activation  with anti-CD3/CD28  Abs by up-regulating  expression  of these  mediators. 
We expect  to see a much  lower  frequency  of responsive  T-cells in AML  patients.  Only  a small 
percentage of immune cells in AML patients (2 -4%) are expected to respond to AML blast - 
derived lysates. Cells of normal donors (used as controls) are likely to respond but this will 
reflect alloantigen - rather than AML antigen -driven response. In patients receiving 
pembrolizumab, we expect to see recovery of T - cell responses to anti -CD3/CD28 Abs and  of 
T and NK cell  responses to antigens in AML blast -derived lysates by up -regulated expression 
of either IFN -g or GrB/perforin or  both.  
The proportions/ absolute numbers of CD8+ Tells and NK cells expressing IFN -γ as well as 
CD8+ T -cells and NK cells expressing GrB and Pe rforin will be evaluated at diagnosis and 
just prior to starting pembrolizumab therapy and will be compared to the  proportions/absolute 
numbers of positive cells at pre -determined intervals after pembrolizumab treatment. The 
numbers of CD8+ T cells and NK cells expressing IFN - γ, GrB and/or perforins are expected 
to increase  from  values  at diagnosis  and those  prior  to pembrolizumab  treatment.  This increase 
would suggest recovery of normal immune responses to general stimulatory signals and to 
AML  blast -derived signals,  providing  evidence  for the effect  of pembrolizumab  on AML  blast - 
reactive  T-cells and NK cells through  elimination  of the checkpoint  blockade  and/or  potentially 
also through ADCC directed at  Treg.  
 
3.2.3.2.3  : Effects of pembrolizumab on functions and levels of  exosomes  
 
Exosomes are small (30 -150mm) vesicles secreted by all cell types and present in all body 
fluids.  [56] While  exosome  secretion  occurs  under  physiologic  conditions,  tumor  cells are avid 
exosome producers. In AML, blast -derived exosomes carry an immunosuppressive cargo. 
Furthermore, plasma exosomes in patients with newly diagnosed with AML prior to any 
therapy had higher levels of exosomes (in µg protein/mL plasma) compared to normal donors 
[57].  Ex vivo, exosomes  decrease  NK-cell cytotoxicity  and down -regulate  NKG2D  expression 
in normal NK cells. More recently, we have shown elevated levels of exosomes in AML 
patients that are in complete remission and that these exosomes contain PD1 and PD -L1. [58] 
Version 5, dated 06/03/2019  19  
We hypothesize that the use of pembrolizumab will affect the immunosuppressive activity of 
exosomes.  
 
Assay Description : Exosomes will be isolated from the plasma of AML patients using 
differential centrifugation, ultrafiltration and size -exclusion chromato graphy on mini - 
Sepharose  2a columns.  Using  Western  blotting,  we will identify  the exosomal  cargo,  including 
PD1, PD -L1, TGF -β1 and CD39 and CD73. To study immune suppression mediated by 
exosomes, AutoMACs -isolated normal NK or T cells will be co -incubated  with exosomes 
isolated  at the time of enrollment  prior  to pembrolizumab  therapy.  The levels  of exosomes  and 
the effects  on the function  of the immune  cells will be monitored  serially  at diagnosis,  prior  to 
pembrolizumab initiation, at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post initiation of pembrolizumab  . 
 
Data interpretation and considerations : The hypothesis is that suppression of normal NK or T 
cells by AML exosomes and concomitant activation of Treg reverse with the use of 
pembrolizumab.  Silencing  of the nega tive signals  should  diminish  or ablate  exosome -mediated 
immune suppression and restore immune cell  functions.

persistent Grade 2 adverse reactions for which treatment with study drug has  been held, that do not recover to Grade 0 -1 within 12 weeks of the last dose.  
 
 
Dosing  interruptions  are permitted  in the case of medical  / surgical  events  or logistical  reasons 
not related to study therapy (e.g., elective surgery, unrelated medical events, patient vacation, 
and/or holidays). Subje cts should be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the 
scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the Investigator. The reason  for 
interruption should be documented in the patient's study  record.  
 
Subjects with a history of AML who undergo induction therapy may have intermittent 
thrombocytopenia or neutropenia. This may be due to relapse of AML but could also be due 
to viral infection, a medication effect, or an unexplained by transient etiology. 
Thrombocytopenia  and neutropenia  are not commonly  (>10%)  experienced  adverse  event  with 
pembrolizumab in other clinical studies in solid tumors (Investigator’s Brochure). As such, 
pembrolizumab treatment should not be withheld for a platelet count of >30,000/mcL or an 
absolute neutrophil count of >500/mcL unless the investigator feels that disease assessment is 
warranted. However, if platelet count is <30,000/mcL or ANC is <500/mcL, pembrolizumab 
therapy  should  be held and the etiology  of the thrombocytopenia  evaluated.  If platelets  increa se 
to >30,000/mcL and ANC to >500/mcL within 3 weeks, pembrolizumab may be restarted at 
the current dose. If a subject develops febrile or prolonged neutropenia which requires  growth  
Version 5, dated 06/03/2019  25  factor support at the discretion of the investigator, pembrol izumab should be permanently 
discontinued.  
 
The dose may be held based on assessment of the patient at the time of the scheduled dose. If 
the dose is held, the patient will be reassessed weekly (or more frequently if clinically 
indicated) and dosing will b e restarted at the discretion of the principal investigator.  
 
4.2.2 Timing of Dose  Administration  
 
Trial  treatment  should  be administered  on Day 1 of each cycle  after all procedures/assessments 
have been completed as detailed on the Trial Flow Chart (Section 5.0). Trial treatment may 
be administered within a window of +/ -3 days from the scheduled Day 1 of each  cycle.  
 
All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis.  
 
Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30-minute IV  infusion  every 3 weeks.  
Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as 
possible. However,  given  the variability  of infusion  pumps  from  site to site, a window  of -5 
minutes  and +10 minutes  is permitted  (i.e., infusion  time is 30 minutes:  -5 min/+10  min).  Vital  
signs  should be monitored within 60 minutes prior to infusion and  if reaction occurs every 
15-30 minutes until symptoms resolve . 
 
The Pharmacy  Manual  contains  specific  instructions  for the preparation  of the Pembrolizumab 
infusion fluid and administration of infusion  solution.  
 
4.2.3 Trial  Blinding/Masking  
 
This is an open -label trial; therefore, the investigators, research staff, and subject will know 
the treatment administered.  
 
Randomization or Treatment Allocation  
 
This is an open -label, single arm, phase II trial in which all enrolled subjects will receive the 
study drug.  
 
Stratification  
 
As a single arm study, there is no need for stratification of patients between arms.  
 
Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited)  
 
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial. If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications 
or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or 
vaccination may be required. Treating sub -investigators should discuss any questions 
regarding this with the Principal Investigator. The final decision on any supp ortive therapy or 
vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the subject's primary physician.  

Version 5, dated 06/03/2019  26  4.5.1 Acceptable Concomitant  Medications  
 
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a subject’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the community standards of 
medical care. All concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) 
including all prescription, over -the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications 
and fluids. If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, 
route, and date may also be included on the CRF.  
 
All concomitant medications received within 28 days before the first dose of trial treatment 
and 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment  should  be recorded.  Concomitant  medications 
administered up to 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment should be recorded for SAEs 
and ECIs as defined in Section  6.2.3.  
 
4.5.2 Prohibited Concomitant  Medications  
 
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapies during the Screening and 
Treatment Phase (including retreatment for post -complete response relapse) of this trial:  
 
• Anti-cancer systemic chemotherapy or biological  therapy  
• Immunotherapy not spe cified in this  protocol  
• Chemotherapy not specified in this  protocol  
• Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab  
• Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and while 
participating in the trial. Examples of live vaccines incl ude, but are not limited to, the 
following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and 
typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed 
virus  vaccines  and are allowed;  however  intranasal  influ enza vaccines  (e.g. Flu-Mist®) 
are live attenuated vaccines, and are not  allowed.  
 
• Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an 
event of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology. The use of physiologic 
doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the  Sponsor.  
Subjects who, in the assessment by the investigator, require the use of any of the 
aforementioned  treatments  for clinical  management  should  be removed  from  the trial. Subjects 
may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be medically  necessary.  
 
The Exclusion Criteria describes other medications which are prohibited in this trial. 
There are no prohibited therapies during the Post -Treatment Follow -up Pha se. 
Version 5, dated 06/03/2019  27  Rescue Medications & Supportive Care  
 
4.6.1 Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by the 
treating investigator. Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse 
events  with potential  immunologic  etiology  are outlined  below  and in greater  detail  in the ECI 
guidance  document.  Where  appropriate,  these  guidelines  include  the use of oral or intravenous 
treatment with corticosteroids as well as additional anti -inflammatory agents if symptoms do 
not improve with administration of corticosteroids. Note that several courses of steroid 
tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For 
each disorder, attempts sho uld be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or 
bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care. The treatment 
guidelines  are intended  to be applied  when  the investigator  determines  the events  to be related 
to Pembrolizumab.  
 
Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator is 
instructed to follow the ECI reporting guidance but does not need to follow the treatment 
guidance (as outlined in the ECI guidance document). Re fer to Section 4.2.1 for dose 
modification.  
 
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or 
skin photography as part of evaluation of the event. Suggested conditional procedures, as 
appropriate, can be found in the ECI guidance document.  
 
• Pneumonitis : 
o For Grade 2 events , treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms 
improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over 
no less than 4  weeks. 
o For Grade 3 -4 events , immediately treat wit h intravenous  steroids. 
Administer additional anti -inflammatory measures, as  needed. 
o Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of 
prolonged steroid  administration . 
 
 
• Diarrhea/Colitis : 
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such 
as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of 
bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).  
 
o All subjects who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advi sed to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids. If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid  and 
electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion. For Grade 2 or higher 
diarrhea,  consider  GI consultation  and endoscopy  to confirm  or rule out colitis. 
o For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis that persists greater than 3 days, administer oral 
corticosteroids.  

Version 5, dated 06/03/2019  28  o For Grade  3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis  that persists  > 1 week,  treat with intravenous 
steroids followed by high dose oral  steroids. 
o When  symp toms  improve  to Grade  1 or less, steroid  taper  should  be started  and 
continued over no less than 4  weeks. 
 
 
• Type 1 diabetes mellitus (if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA])  or 
≥ Grade 3 Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic 
acidosis (DKA)  
 
o For T1DM or Grade 3 -4 Hyperglycemia  
▪ Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes 
mellitus and for Grade 3 -4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic 
acidosis or  ketonuria.  
▪ Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine 
ketones, glycosylated hemoglobin, and  C-peptide.  
 
• Hypophysitis : 
 
o For Grade 2 events, treat with corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to 
Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 
4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid 
dose is  tapered. 
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed 
by oral corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroi d 
taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement 
of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is  tapered. 
 
 
• Hyperthyroidism or  Hypothyroidism : 
Thyroid  disorders  can occur  at any time during  treatment.  Monitor  patients  for changes 
in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as 
indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid 
disorders.  
 
o Grade 2 hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 3 -4 hypothyroidism):  
▪ In hyperthyroidism, non -selective beta -blockers (e.g. propranolol) are 
suggested as initial therapy.  
▪ In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with 
levothyroxine or liothyroinine, is indi cated per standard of  care.  
o Grade 3 -4 hyperthyroidism  
▪ Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by oral 
corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid 
taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid 
dose is  tapered.  
Version 5, dated 06/03/2019  29   
 
• Hepatic : 
o For Grade 2 events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until  returned 
to baseline values (consider  weekly). 
▪ Treat with IV or oral cortico steroids  
o For Grade  3-4 events,  treat with intravenous  corticosteroids  for 24 to 48 hours. 
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started 
and continued over no less than 4  weeks. 
 
• Renal Failure or  Nephritis : 
o For Grade 2 events, treat with  corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with systemic  corticosteroids.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4  weeks. 
 
• Management of Infusion Reactions : Signs and s ymptoms usually develop during or 
shortly after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of 
completion of  infusion.

Diet/Activity/Other Considerations  
 
4.7.1 Diet 
 
Subjects should maintain a normal diet unless modifications are required to manage an AE 
such as diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.  
 
4.7.2 Contraception  
 
Pembrolizumab may have adverse ef fects on a fetus in utero. Furthermore, it is not known if 
pembrolizumab  has transient  adverse  effects  on the composition  of sperm.  Non-pregnant,  non- 
breast -feeding women may be enrolled if they are willing to use 2 methods of birth control or 
are considered highly unlikely to conceive. Highly unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) 
surgically sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal (a woman who is ≥45 years of age and has not had 
menses for greater than 1 year will be considered postmenopausal), or 3) not h eterosexually 
active for the duration of the study. The two birth control methods can be either two barrier 
methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy. Subjects should 
start using  birth  control  from  study  Visit  1 throughout  the study  period  up to 120 days after the 
last dose of study  therapy.  
 
The following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception: diaphragm, condom 
(by the partner), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide. Appropriate hormonal 
contraceptives will include any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an 
estrogen and/or a progestational agent (including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or 
intramuscular agents).  
 
Subjects should be informed that taking the study me dication may involve unknown risks to 
the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study. In order to participate  in 
the study  they must  adhere  to the contraception  requirement  (described  above)  for the duration  

Version 5, dated 06/03/2019  31  of the study and during the follow -up period defined in section 6.2.2 Reporting of Pregnancy 
and Lactation to the Investigator and to Merck. If there is any question that a subject will not 
reliably  comply  with the requirements  for contraception,  that subject  should not be entered  into 
the study.  
 
4.7.3 Use in  Pregnancy  
 
If a subject inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with pembrolizumab, the 
subject will immediately be removed from the study. The site will contact the subject at least 
monthly and document  the subject’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or 
terminated. The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the Investigator and to Merck 
without delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, 
aborti on, congenital  anomaly,  or other  disabling  or life-threatening  complication  to the mother 
or newborn). The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow  the 
outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newbor n to the  Investigator. 
If a male subject impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be 
informed immediately and the pregnancy reported to the Investigator and to Merck and 
followed as described above  . 
 
4.7.4 Use in Nursing  Women  
 
It is unknown whether pembrolizumab is excreted in human milk. Since many drugs are 
excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the 
nursing infant, subjects who are breast -feeding are not eligible for enrollment.  
 
Subject Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria  
 
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be dropped from the trial at the 
discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur. In addition, a subject may be 
withdrawn by the treating sub -investigator or the Principal Investig ator if enrollment into the 
trial is inappropriate,  the trial plan is violated,  or for administrative  and/or  other  safety  reasons. 
Specific details regarding discontinuation or withdrawal are provided in Section 6.1.4 – Other 
Procedures.  
 
A subject must be  discontinued from the trial for any of the following reasons:  
 
• The subject or legal representative (such as a parent or legal guardian) withdraws 
consent.  
 
• Confirmed pathologic disease  progression  
• Unacceptable adverse experiences as described in Section  6.2.1.2  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of  treatment  
• Investigator’s decision to withdraw the  subject  
• The subject has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy  test 

Version 5, dated 06/03/2019  32  • Noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure  requirements  
• The subject is lost to  follow -up 
• Completed 24 months of treatment with pembrolizumab and required follow -up 
• Administrative  reasons  
The End of Treatment  and Follow -up visit procedures  are listed  in Section  5 (Trial  Flow  Chart) 
and Section 6.1.5 (Visit Requirements). After the end of treatment, each subject will be 
followed  for 30 days for adverse  event  monitoring  (serious  adverse  events  will be collected  for 
90 days after the end of treatment as described in Section 6.2.3.1). Subjects who discontinue 
for reasons  other  than progressive  disease  will have  post-treatment  follow -up for disease  status 
until disease progression, initiating a non -study cancer treatment, withdrawing consent or 
becoming lost to follow -up. After documente d disease progression each subject will be 
followed  by telephone  for overall  survival  until death,  withdrawal  of consent,  or the end of the 
study, whichever occurs first.  
 
Subject Replacement Strategy  
 
Participants  who are not evaluable  for efficacy  because  they have  not received  at least one dose 
of drug will not be included in analyses for either efficacy or toxicity and will be replaced. 
Any participant who receives at least one dose of pembrolizumab will be included in both 
efficacy and s afety analyses, and will not be  replaced.  
 
Clinical Criteria for Early Trial Termination  
 
Early trial termination will be the result of the criteria specified below:  
 
1. Quality or quantity of data recording is inaccurate or  incomplete  
 
2. Poor adherence to pro tocol and regulatory  requirements  
 
3. Incidence or severity of adverse drug reaction in this or other studies indicates a potential 
health hazard to  subjects  
 
4. Plans to modify or discontinue the development of the study  drug 
 
In the event of Merck decision to no longer supply study drug, ample notification will be 
provided so that appropriate adjustments to subject treatment can be made.

6.0 TRIAL PROCEDURES 
Trial Procedures  
The Trial Flow Chart - Section 5.0 summarizes the trial procedures to be performed at each 
visit. Individual trial procedures are describ ed in detail below. It may be necessary to perform 
these  procedures  at unscheduled  time points  if deemed  clinically  necessary  by the investigator.  
 
Furthermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by the Investigator for 
reasons related to subject safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be potentially 
sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local regulations may require that 
additional informed consent be obtained from the subject. In these cases, such 
evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations.  
 
6.1.1 Administrative  Procedures  
 
6.1.1.1  Informed  Consent  
 
Investigators  must  obtain  documented  consent  from  each potential  subject  prior  to participating 
in a clinical  trial. 
 
6.1.1.1.1  General Informed  Consent  
 
Consent must be documented by the subject’s dated signature on a consent form along with 
the dated signature of the person conducting the consent discussion.  
 
A copy  of the signed  and dated  consent  form  should  be given  to the subject  before participation 
in the  trial. 
 
The initial informed consent form, any subsequent revised written informed consent form  and 
any written information provided to the subject must receive the IRB/ERC’s 
approval/favorable opinion in advance of use. The subject should be informed in a timely 
manner  if new information  becomes  available  that may be relevant  to the subject’s  willingness 
to continue participation in the trial. The communication of this information will be provided 
and documented via a revised  consent form or addendum to the original consent form that 
captures the subject’s  dated.  
 
Specifics about a trial and the trial population will be added to the consent form template at 
the protocol level.  
 
The informed consent will adhere to local IRB/ERC requirements and applicable laws and 
regulations.  
Version 5, dated 06/03/2019 37   
6.1.1.2  Inclusion/Exclusion  Criteria  
 
All inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed by the investigator or qualified designee 
to ensure that the subject qualifies for the trial trial as defined in Sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.3.  
 
6.1.1.3  Medical  History  
 
A medical history will be obtained by the inv estigator or qualified designee. Medical history 
will include all active conditions. Any condition diagnosed within the prior 10 years that is 
considered  to be clinically  significant  by the Investigator  should  be recorded.  Details  regarding 
the disease for  which the subject has enrolled in this study will be recorded separately and  not 
listed as medical  history.  
 
6.1.1.4  Prior and Concomitant Medications  Review  
 
6.1.1.4.1  Prior  Medications  
 
The investigator or qualified designee will review prior medication use, including any 
protocol -specified washout requirement, and record prior medication taken by the subject 
within 28 days before starting the trial. Treatment for the disease for which the subject has 
enrolled in this study will be recorded separately and not listed as a prior medication.  
 
6.1.1.4.2  Concomitant  Medications  
 
The investigator or qualified designee will record medication, if any, taken by the subject 
during the trial. All medications related to reportable SAEs and ECIs should be recorded as 
defined in Secti on 6.2.  
 
6.1.1.5  Disease Details and  Treatments  
 
6.1.1.5.1  Disease  Details  
 
The investigator or qualified designee will obtain prior and current details regarding disease 
status.  
 
6.1.1.5.2  Prior Treatment  Details  
 
The investigator or qualified designee will review all prior cancer treatments including 
systemic treatments, radiation and surgeries.  
 
6.1.1.5.3  Subsequent Anti -Cancer Therapy  Status  
 
The investigator  or qualified  designee  will review  all new anti-neoplastic  therapy  initiated  after 
the last dose of trial treatment. If a subject initiates a new anti -cancer therapy within 30 days 
after the last dose of trial treatment, the 30 day Safety Follow -up visit must occur before the 
first dose of the new therapy. Once new anti -cancer therapy has been initiated the subject will 
move into survival  follow -up. 
Version 5, dated 06/03/2019 38   
6.1.1.6 Trial Compliance (Medication/Diet/Activity/Other)  
 
During treatment, subjects must not use a prohibited concomitant medication, as detailed in  
4.5.2. These include other anti -cancer systemic chemotherapy or b iologic therapy, other 
investigation agents, radiation therapy, live vaccines, or glucocorticoids except as required to 
modulate symptoms from an adverse event of suspected immunologic etiology, as  determined 
by the study sub -investigators or physiologic d oses of steroids that are approved by the 
Principal Investigator. Subjects requiring prohibited concomitant medications must withdraw 
from the study. No diet or activity modification is required when enrolling on this study. 
Patients must have a negative u rine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours of the first dose 
of pembrolizumab, and agree to appropriate contraception during the duration of the study  for 
120 days after the last dose of medication, as described in Section 4.7.2.  
 
6.1.2 Clinical  Procedures/Ass essments  
 
6.1.2.1  Adverse Event (AE)  Monitoring  
 
The investigator or qualified designee will assess each subject to evaluate for potential new  or 
worsening  AEs as specified  in the Trial  Flow  Chart  and more  frequently  if clinically  indicated. 
Adverse experiences will be graded and recorded throughout the study and during the follow - 
up period according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 (see Section 11.2). Toxicities will be 
characterized  in terms  regarding  seriousness,  causality,  toxicity  grading,  and action  taken with 
regard to trial  treatment.  
 
For subjects  receiving  treatment  with Pembrolizumab  all AEs of unknown  etiology  associated 
with Pembrolizumab exposure should be evaluated to determine if it is possibly an event of 
clinical interest (ECI) of a potentia lly immunologic etiology (termed immune -related adverse 
events, or irAEs); see the separate ECI guidance document regarding the identification, 
evaluation and management of potential  irAEs.  
 
Please refer to section 6.2 for detailed information regarding th e assessment and recording of 
AEs.  
 
6.1.2.2  Full Physical Exam  
 
The investigator or qualified designee will perform a complete physical exam during the 
screening period. Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as medical 
history. A full physica l exam should be performed during screening,  
 
6.1.2.3  Directed Physical Exam  
 
For cycles  that do not require  a full physical  exam  per the Trial  Flow  Chart,  the investigator  or 
qualified designee will perform a directed physical exam as clinically indicated prior to trial 
treatment  administration.  
Version 5, dated 06/03/2019 39   
6.1.2.4  Vital Signs  
 
The investigator or qualified designee will take vital signs at screening, within 60 minutes 
prior to infusion and  if reaction occurs every 15 -30 minutes until symptoms resolve  and at 
treatment discontinuation as specified in the Trial Flow Chart (Section  6.0). Vital  signs  
should  include  temperature,  pulse,  respiratory  rate, weight  and blood pressure. Height will be 
measured at screening  only.  
 
6.1.2.5  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance  Scale  
 
The investigator  or qualified  designee  will assess  ECOG  status  (see Section  11.1)  at screening, 
prior  to the administration  of each dose of trial treatment  and discontinuation  of trial treatment 
as speci fied in the Trial Flow Chart. After Cycle 8, assessment of ECOG status will be 
performed every other cycle in conjunction with the directed or full physical  exam.  
 
6.1.2.6  Assessment of  Disease  
 
The subject will have a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate with flow cytometric studies and 
cytogenetics  performed  and officially  reviewed  by a UPMC  hematopathologist  within  4 weeks 
prior to the first treatment as part of the screening period. Subsequent disease assessments are 
performed by bone marrow biopsy and aspirate w ith flow cytometric studies and  cytogenetics 
after 1 year (+/ - 4 weeks) and after 2 years (+/ - 4 weeks) or at disease relapse or treatment 
discontinuation.  
 
6.1.2.7  Tumor Tissue Collection and Correlative Studies Blood  Sampling  
 
As part of the functional correlati ve studies, it is recommended that patients enrolled on the 
study have cyropreserved autologous AML blasts within the UPMC Tissue Bank. Correlative 
studies blood sampling includes 30ml of peripheral blood in non -citrate tubes (heparinized) 
and 10ml in citr ate tube(s), collected prior to cycle 1, 2, 4, 8, 17, and 34. Correlative studies 
are described in full detail in Section 3.2.3.2.

Laboratory tests for screening or entry into the Second Course Phase should be performed 
within 10 days prior to the first dose of treatment. After Cycle 1, pre -dose laboratory 
procedures can be conducte d up to 72 hours prior to dosing. Results must be reviewed by the 
investigator or qualified designee and found to be acceptable prior to each dose of trial 
treatment.  
 
6.1.4 Other Procedures  
 
6.1.4.1  Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 
When a subject discontinues/withdraws prior to trial completion, all applicable activities 
scheduled for the final trial visit should be performed at the time of discontinuation. Any 
adverse  events  which  are present  at the time of discontinuation/withdrawal  should  be followed 
in accordance with the safety requirements outlined in Section 7.2 - Assessing and Recording 
Adverse Events. After discontinuing treatment following assessment of CR, these subjects 
should return to the site for a Safety Follow -up Visit (described in  Section 6.1.5.3.1) and then 
proceed to the Follow -Up Period of the study (described in Section  6.1.5.4).  
 
6.1.4.2  Blinding/Unblinding  
 
N/A 
 
6.1.5 Visit  Requirements  
 
Visit  requirements  are outlined  in Section  5.0 Trial  Flow  Chart.  Specific procedure -related 
details are provided above in Section 6.1 - Trial  Procedures.  
 
6.1.5.1  Screening  
 
6.1.5.1.1  Screening  Period  
 
Potential  subjects  who enter  the screening  period  must  undergo  a full medical  history,  complete 
physical exam, chest radiograph, laboratory assessment as detailed in Section 6.0, a bone 
marrow biopsy, and meet full inclusion/exclusion criteria. All screening assessments must be 
completed within 4 weeks of obtaining full informed consent for the study. A negative serum 
pregnancy test  must be documented within 72 hours of the first treatment. Full laboratory 
assessment must be completed no more than 10 days before the first  treatment.  
 
6.1.5.2  Treatment Period  
 
Subjects enrolled on the study should receive treatment as close as possible to the  data when 
enrollment occurred, and must start treatment within 10 days of official enrollment or full 
screening assessment must be repeated. Those who enter the treatment period are expected to 
receive  treatment  with pembrolizumab  every  3 weeks  + 3 days in the absence  of adverse  events 
requiring  treatment  delays.  Treatment  delays  and dose modifications  are discussed  in full detail 
in Section 4.2. Physical exam, laboratory assessment, efficacy assessments, and correlative 
blood sampling is required du ring treatment as detailed in Section  6.0. 
Version 5, dated 06/03/2019 42   
6.1.5.3  Post-Treatment  Visits  
 
6.1.5.3.1  Safety Follow -Up Visit  
 
The mandatory Safety Follow -Up Visit should be conducted approximately 30 days after the 
last dose of trial treatment or before the initiation of a new anti -cancer treatment, whichever 
comes  first, as described  in Section  6.0. All AEs that occur  prior  to the Safety  Follow -Up Visit 
should be recorded. Subjects with an AE of Grade > 1 will be fo llowed until the resolution  of 
the AE to Grade 0 -1 or until the beginning of a new anti -neoplastic therapy, whichever  occurs 
first. SAEs  that occur  within  90 days of the end of treatment  or before  initiation  of a new anti- 
cancer treatment should also be followed and  recorded.  
 
6.1.5.4 Follow -up Visits  
 
Subjects  who discontinue  trial treatment  for a reason  other  than disease  progression  will move 
into the Follow -Up Phase and should be assessed every 12 weeks (84 ± 7 days) by complete 
blood count to monitor  disease status. Every effort should be made to collect information 
regarding disease status until the start of new anti -neoplastic therapy, disease progression, 
death, or end of the study or up to 5 years from enrollment. Information regarding post -study 
anti-neoplastic treatment will be collected if new treatment is  initiated.  
 
6.1.5.4.1 Survival Follow -up 
 
Once a subject experiences confirmed disease progression or starts a new anti -cancer therapy, 
the subject moves into the survival follow -up phase and should be contacted by telephone 
every 12 weeks to assess for survival status until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of 
the study, whichever occurs first.  
 
Assessing and Recording Adverse Events  
 
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily 
have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol - 
specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol - 
specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in 
frequency  and/or  intensity)  of a preexisting  condition  that is temporally  associated  with the use 
of the investigational product, is also an adverse  event.  
 
Changes resulting from  normal growth and development that do not vary significantly in 
frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse events. Examples 
of this may include, but are not limited to, teething, typical crying in infants and children and 
onset of menses or menopause occurring at a physiologically appropriate time.  

Version 5, dated 06/03/2019 43   
Adverse  events  may occur  during  the course  of the use of the investigational  product  in clinical 
trials  or within  the follow -up period  specified  by the protocol,  or prescribed  in clinical  practice, 
from overdose (whether accidental or intentional), from abuse and from  withdrawal.  
 
Adverse events may also occur in screened subjects during any pre -allocation baseline period 
as a result of a protocol -specifi ed intervention, including washout or discontinuation of usual 
therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.  
 
All adverse events will be recorded from the time the consent form is signed through 30 days 
following cessation of treatment and at each exami nation on the Adverse Event case report 
forms/worksheets. The reporting timeframe for adverse events meeting any serious criteria is 
described in section 6.2.3.1.  
 
Adverse events will not be collected for subjects during the pre -screening period (for 
deter mination  of archival  tissue  status)  as long as that subject  has not undergone  any protocol - 
specified procedure or intervention. If the subject requires a blood draw, fresh tumor biopsy 
etc., the subject  is first required  to provide  consent  to the main  study  and AEs will be captured 
according to guidelines for standard AE  reporting.  
 
6.2.1 Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the 
Investigator and to  Merck  
 
For purposes of this trial, an overdose will be defined as any dose exceeding the prescribed 
dose for pembrolizumab  by 20% over the prescribed  dose.  No specific  information  is available 
on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. In the event of overdose, pembrolizumab 
should be discontinued and the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity. 
Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically  indicated.  
 
If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of the investigational 
product,  the adverse  event(s)  is reported  as a serious  adverse  event,  even  if no other  seriousness 
criteria are  met. 
 
If a dose of the investigational product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken 
without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is 
reported as a non -serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental 
or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”  
 
All reports  of overdose  with and without  an adverse  event  must  be reported  within  24 hours  to 
the Investigator and within 2 working days hours to Merck Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide 
Product Safety; FAX 215  993-1220)  
 
6.2.2 Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactation to the Investigator and to  Merck  
 
Although pregnancy and lactation are not considered adverse even ts, it is the responsibility of 
investigators  or their designees  to report  any pregnancy  or lactation  in a subject  (spontaneously 
reported  to them),  including  the pregnancy  of a male  subject's  female  partner  that occurs  during 
the trial or within  120 days of completing  the trial completing  the trial, or 30 days following  
Version 5, dated 06/03/2019 44   
cessation of treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier. All 
subjects and female partners of male subjects who become pregnant must be followed to the 
completion/termination of the pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, 
missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, 
miscarriage and stillbirth must be reported as serious events  (Important Medical Events). If 
the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported.  
 
Such  events  must  be reported  within  24 hours  to the Investigator  and within  2 working  days to 
Merck Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215  993-1220)  
 
6.2.3 Immediate Reporting of Adverse Events to the Investigator and to  Merck  
 
6.2.3.1  Serious Adverse  Events  
 
A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring at any dose or during any use of the 
investigational product that:  
 
• Results in  death;  
• Is life  threatening;  
• Results in persistent or significant  disability/incapacity;  
• Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization;  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth  defect;  
• Is a new cancer (that is n ot a condition of the  study);  
• Is associated with an overdose;  
• Is another important medical  event  
Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an adverse event unless it results in 
hospitalization or death.  
 
Any serious adverse event, or follow up to a serious adverse event, including death due to  any 
cause  other  than progression  of the cancer  under  study  that occurs  to any subject  from  the time 
the consent  is signed  through  90 days following  cessation  of treatment,  or the initiation  of new 
anti-cancer therapy, whichever is earlier, whether or not related to the investigational  product, 
must be reported within 24 hours to the Investigator and within 2 working days to Merck 
Global  Safety.  
 
Non-serious Events of Clinical Interest will be forwarded to Merck Global Safety and will be 
handled in the same manner as SAEs.  
 
Additionally, any serious adverse event, considered by an investigator who is a qualified 
physician to be related to the investigational product that is brought to the attent ion of the 
investigator at any time outside of the time period specified in the previous paragraph also 
must be reported immediately to the Investigator and to Merck.  
 
SAE reports and any other relevant safety information are to be forwarded to the Merck  
Global Safety facsimile number: +1-215-993-1220  
Version 5, dated 06/03/2019 45   
All subjects with serious adverse events must be followed up for outcome.  
 
6.2.3.2  Events of Clinical  Interest  
 
Selected non -serious and serious adverse events are also known as Events of Clinical Inter est 
(ECI) and must be recorded as such on the Adverse Event case report forms/worksheets and 
reported  within  24 hours  to the Investigator  and within  2 working  days to Merck  Global  Safety. 
(Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993 -1220)  
 
Events of clinical interest for this trial include:  
 
1. an overdose of the investigational product, as defined in Section 6.2.1 - Definition of an 
Overdose  for This Protocol  and Reporting  of Overdose  to the Investigator,  that is not associated 
with clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory  results.  
 
2. an elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit of 
normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X the upper 
limit  of normal  and, at the same time,  an alkaline  phosphatase  lab value  that is less than 2X the 
upper limit of normal, as determined by way of protocol -specified laboratory testing or 
unscheduled laboratory  testing.*  
 
*Note:  These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The 
purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require 
an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology. The trial site guidance for assess ment 
and follow up of these criteria can be found in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or 
equivalent).  
 
1. Additional adverse  events:  
 
A separate guidance document has been provided entitled “Event of Clinical Interest 
Guidance  Document”  (previously  entitle d, “Event  of Clinical  Interest  and Immune -Related 
Adverse Event Guidance  Document”).  
 
ECIs (both non -serious and serious adverse events) identified in this guidance document 
from the date of first dose through 90 days following cessation of treatment, or 30 days 
after the initiation of a new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, need to be reported 
within 24 hours to the Investigator and within 2 working days to Merck Global Safety. 
(Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993 -1220), rega rdless of attribution to study 
treatment, consistent with standard SAE reporting guidelines.  
 
Subjects should be assessed for possible ECIs prior to each dose. Lab results should be 
evaluated and subjects should be asked for signs and symptoms suggestive o f an immune - 
related event. Subjects who develop an ECI thought to be immune -related should have 
additional testing to rule out other etiologic causes. If lab results or symptoms indicate a 
possible  immune -related  ECI, then additional  testing  should  be performed  to rule out other 
etiologic causes. If no other cause is found, then it is assumed to be  immune -related.  
Version 5, dated 06/03/2019 46   
6.2.4 Evaluating Adverse  Events  
 
An investigator who is a qualified physician will evaluate all adverse events according to the 
NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Any adverse event 
which changes CTCAE grade over the course of a given episode will have each change of 
grade recorded on the adverse event case report forms/worksheets.  
 
All adverse events regard less of CTCAE grade must also be evaluated for seriousness.  
 
Version 5 , dated 06/03/2019 47   
 
Table 10: Evaluating Adverse Events  
 
An investigator who is a qualified physician, will evaluate all adverse events as to:  
 
V4.0  CTCAE  
Grading  Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mid symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.  
 Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental ADL.  
 Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation or hospitalization indicated; 
disabling; limiting self -care ADL.  
 Grade 4  Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
 Grade 5  Death related to AE  
Seriousness  A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring at any dose or during any use of investigational product that:  
†Results in death ; or 
†Is life threatening; or places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (Note: This does not include an 
adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.); or  
†Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions); or  
†Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization (hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay, even if the  
hospitalization is a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: Hospitalization [incl uding hospitalization for an elective procedure] for a preexisting 
condition which has not worsened does not constitute a serious adverse event.); or  
†Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in offspring of subject taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis);or  
Is a new cancer; (that is not a condition of the study) or 
Is an overdose (whether accidental or intentional). Any adverse event associated with an overdose is considered a serious adverse event. An overdose that is not 
associated with an adverse event is considered a non -serious event of clinical interest and must be reported within 24 hours.  
Other important medical events that may not result in death, not be life threatening, or not require hospitalization may be cons idered a serious adverse event when, 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical interventio n to prevent one of the outcomes  
listed previously (designated above by a †).  
Duration  Record the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less than 1 day, indicate the appropriate length of time and units  
Action taken  Did the adverse event cause the investigational product to be discontinued?  
Relationship to 
test drug  Did the investigational product cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that the investigational product cau sed the adverse event will be 
provided by an investigator who is a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on  the source document or worksheet that supports the causality 
noted on the AE form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed document must be re tained for the required regulatory time 
frame. The criteria below are  intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test dr ug and the 
adverse event based upon the available information.  
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the investigational product and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the 
components and their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely the investigational product caused the  adverse event (AE):  
Exposure  Is there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to the investigational product such as: reliable history, acceptable complianc e assessment 
(pill count, diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?  
Time Course  Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the investigational product?  
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug -induced effect (applies to trials with investigational medicinal product)?  
Likely Ca use 
 
 
 
 Is the AE not reasonably explained by another etiology such as underlying disease, other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or  environmental 
factors  
 
Version 5 , dated 06/03/2019 48   
 
 
Relationship  The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the test drug and the AE: (continued)  
to 
investigational 
product 
(continued)  Dechallenge  Was the investigational product discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency reduced?  
If yes, did the AE resolve or improve?  
If yes, this is a positive dechallenge. If no, this is a negative dechallenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or permanent disability; (2) the  AE resolved/improved despite continuation 
of the investigational product; or (3) the trial is a single -dose drug trial); or (4) investigational product(s) is/are only used one time.)  
 Rechallenge  Was the subject re -exposed to the investigational product in this study?  
If yes, did the AE recur or worsen?  
If yes, this is a positive rechallenge. If no, this is a negative rechallenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in death or permanent disabili ty, or (2) the trial is a single -dose drug trial); or  
(3) investigational product(s) is/are used only one time).  
NOTE: IF A RECHALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR AN ADVERSE EVENT WHICH WAS SERIOUS AND WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN 
CAUSED BY THE MERCK PRODUCT, OR IF REEXPOSURE TO THE INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT POSES ADDITIONAL 
POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THE SUBJECT, THEN THE RECHALLENGE MUST BE APPROVED IN ADVANCE BY THE  
U.S. CLINICAL MONITOR AS PER DOSE MODIFICATION GUIDELINES IN THE PROTOCOL.  
 Consistency 
with Trial 
Treatment  
Profile  Is the clinical/pathological presentation of the AE consistent with previous knowledge regarding the investigational product or drug class 
pharmacology or toxicology?  
The assessment of relationship will be reported on the case report forms /worksheets by an investigator who is a qualified physician according to his/her best clinical judgment, includi ng 
consideration of the above elements.  
Record one of the following  Use the following scale of criteria as guidance (not all crite ria must be present to be indicative of a investigational product relationship).  
Yes, there is a reasonable 
possibility of Merck product 
relationship.  There is evidence of exposure to the investigational product. The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to the administration of the 
investigational product is reasonable. The AE is more likely explained by the investigational product than by another cause.  
No, there is not a reasonable 
possibility Merck product 
relationship  Subject did not receive the investigational product OR temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of the investigational pr oduct 
is not reasonable OR there is another obvious cause of the AE. (Also entered for a subject with overdose without an associate d AE.)

6.2.5 Sponsor Responsibility for Reporting Adverse  Events  
 
All Adverse Events will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs and investigators in 
accordance with all applicable global laws and regulations.  
 
The principal  investigator  / sponsor  must  promptly  review  all information  relevant  to the safety  of 
the drug obtained or otherwise received from foreign or domestic sources, including information 
derived from any clinical or epidemiological investigations, ani mal or in vitro studies, reports in 
the scientific literature, and unpublished scientific papers, as well as reports from foreign 
regulatory authorities and reports of foreign commercial marketing experience for drugs that are 
not marketed in the United St ates. The study principal investigator / sponsor must notify all 
participating investigators of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as 
soon as  possible.  
 
In addition to completing appropriate patient demographic and suspect m edication information, 
the report should include as applicable the following information that is available at the time of 
report within the Event Description of the MedWatch 3500 form:  
 
• CTCAE term(s) and grade(s)  
• current status of study  drug 
• all interventions to address the AE (testing and result, treatment and  response)  
• hospitalization and/or discharge  dates  
• event relationship to study  drug 
Follow -up reports:  
Additional information may be added to a previously submitted report by adding to the original 
MedWatch 3500 report and submitting it as follow -up or creating supplemental summary 
information and submitting it as follow -up with the original MedWatch 3500 form.  
 
7.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN 
Analysis Samples  
For both the primary safety and efficacy endpoints, the analysis sample will be eligible patients 
who have taken at least one dose of pembrolizumab. Patients who are eligible but withdraw prior 
to taking the first dose will not be included in these analyses and will be replaced, so that,  barring 
early stopping, the analysis sample will be 40 patients who have taken at least one dose of drug.  
 
Statistical Analysis Plan Summary  
 
7.2.1 Primary Efficacy Objective: To evaluate the time to relapse (TTR) in patients > 60 years 
with AML in complete remission undergoing post -remission therapy with pembrolizumab. The 
time to relapse function will be estimated by the product -limit (Kaplan -Meier) method, with an 
appropriate  80% confidence interval. Death is considered a censoring event in determining  TTR.  

Version 5, dated 06/03/2019 50   
The median TTR will also be estimated, along with an appropriate confidence interval. 
Assuming an expo nential time to failure distribution, 26% two -year TTR under the standard 
induction therapy is associated with a median of 12.3 months. The null hypothesis that the 
treatment with pembrolizumab offers no increase in TTR will be tested by determining if 12. 3 
months is within an 80% confidence interval around the median, a one -sided α=0.10 test. The 
sensitivity of the treatment of death as a censoring event will be assessed by repeating the above 
analysis on relapse -free survival, where death and relapse are both considered events. Patients 
who drop out of the study will be treated as censored at the last observation time.  
 
Potential  prognostic  factors  for TTR  in this population  will also be explored.  These  include  the use 
of consolidation therapy (0 vs 1-4), cytogenetic risk category (high -risk, intermediate risk, or low 
risk), FLT3 status (FLT3 -ITD mutation present or absent), NPM1 status (NPM1 mutation  present 
or absent), age >70 years, minimal residual disease, and ECOG performance status. The surviva l 
distributions  for TTR  will be computed  using  the Kaplan -Meier  method  and the log-rank test used 
to test for statistical  differences  in  the  distributions  for  the  aforementioned  exposure  
groups. Multivariate analysis using Cox regression will then  be used to adjust for all significant 
covariates. Patients who drop out of the study will be treated as censored at the last observation 
time. Patients with missing covariate data will be excluded from this exploratory  analysis.  
 
7.2.2 Primary Safety Objective:  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in 
patients > 60 years with AML. The NCI CTCAE type and grade of adverse events and their 
association with treatment will be tabulated. Section 8.3 contains a stopping rule for excess 
toxicity.  
 
7.2.3 Secondary Efficacy Objective: To evaluate overall survival with post -remission 
pembrolizumab treatment in patients > 60 years with AML. The analysis plan is similar to that 
of TTR. Assuming an 8% five -year survival rate with induction therapy alone, median overall 
survival is 17.2  months.  
 
7.2.4 Secondary Biomarker  Objectives  
 
7.2.4.1  Second Biomarker  Objective  
 
To evaluate the effect of pembrolizumab on AML blast -reactive T -cells by quantification of 
activated T and NK cells, which are predicted to increase, and Tregs, which are predicted to 
decrease. The changes in these markers from baseline after treatment will be assessed by paired 
comparison t -test or Wilcoxon rank sum test, as appropriate. All point estimates will be 
accompanied by appropriate 95% confidence intervals. In all secondary biomarker analyses, 
observations with missing data will be excluded.  
 
7.2.4.2  Secondary Biomarker Objective  
 
To evaluate the effect of pembrolizumab on AML blast -reactive T -cells through functional 
analysis,  through  asses sment  of cytokine  and Granzyme  B/perforin  expression  in response  to blast 
antigens. The analysis plan is similar to 7.2.4.1.

Mean Number of  Participants   
7.2.4.3  Secondary Biomarker Objective : To evaluate the effect of pembrolizumab on the 
immunosuppressive activity of exosomes, measured by their effects on NK -cell activity and T -cell 
expansion. The analysis plan is similar to  7.2.4.1.  
 
Stopping Rule for Excess Toxicity  
 
The table displays the stopping rule for excessive toxicity. Excessive toxicity is defined as any 
drug-related toxicity that results in withholding or discontinuation of pembrolizumab. 
Additionally, any unexpected grade 3 -4 AEs will be defined as excessive toxicity.”  
 
 
 
The   trial is suspended for toxicity  if 
the number of toxicities  is 
greater  than or equal  to the 
number  in the second column.  For 
instance,  if  5  out  of  the  first  15 
patients  experience  severe  
toxicity,  the trial is  suspended.  
 
Justification of Design  0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8  
True Probability of Toxicity  
The plot presents the power of the hypothesis test of the 
primary efficacy endpoint against the median TTR after 
pembrolizumab treatment. It is seen that 80% power is 
achieved (at α=0.1 in a one -sided test) if the true median 
TTR is 19.5 months or greater.  The stopping rule is based 
on a beta -binomial probability model that stops the trial if 
PP(P(Toxicity)>0.2)>0.8, where PP is the posterior 
probability function for P(Toxicity). The posterior model 
includes a binomial data model and a Beta(2,8) prior for t he 
P(Toxicity). The plot displays the operating characteristics 
of the rule as a function of the true (unobserved) probability 
of toxicity. It is seen that, for instance, if the true  probability   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12 16 20 24 
 
TTR (months)  
of toxicity  is 0.4, the probability  the trial will stop early  is 0.5, and the expected  number  of patients 
accrued is  28.

Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for adverse event reporting. 
(http:// ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html)  
 
12.3 Response Criteria for Acute Leukemia  
 
Morphologic leukemia -free state  
Bone marrow < 5% blasts in an aspirate with spicules  
No blasts with Auer rods or persistence of extramedullary disease  
 
Complete remission  
Patient achieves a morphologic leukemia -free state and 
Absolute neutrophil count > 1000/mcL  
Platelets ≥100,000/mcL  
No residual evid ence of extramedullary disease 
Morphologic CR - patient independent of transfusions  
Cytogenetic CR - cytogenetics normal (in those with previously abnormal cytogenetics) 
Molecular CR - molecular studies negative  

Version 5, dated 06/03/2019 61   
Complete remission with incomplete count recovery  
Patient fulfill all of the criteria for CR except for residual neutropenia (< 1,000/mcL) or 
thrombocytopenia (< 100,000/mcL).  
 
Partial remission  
Decrease of at least 50% in the percentage of blasts to 5 to 25% in the bone marrow 
Patients failing to achieve a complete response are considered treatment failures  
 
Relapse  
Relapse following complete response is defined as reappearance of leukemic blasts in the 
peripheral blood or the finding of more than 5% blasts in the bone marrow, no t attributable to 
another cause (eg, bone marrow regeneration after consolidation therapy)

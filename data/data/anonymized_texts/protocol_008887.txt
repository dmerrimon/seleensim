Brief Summary of Research (250 -400 words):  
The purpose  of this study  is to develop  and pilot test a culturally - and linguistically -tailored  health 
education intervention to increase breast cancer screening amongst Chinese immigrant women. 
The overall  goal is to promote  Chinese  women  to adhere  to 1- and 2-year screening  mammogram 
guidelines  and complete  follow -ups in a timely  manner.  Healthy  People  2020  aims  to have  ~81% 
of screening eligible women undergo mammography; however, less than 61% of Chinese 
immigrant women across the U.S. meet screening guidelines. In New York City (NYC), 
immigration from China has increased ~50% in the past two de cades. This rapid immigration 
makes NYC an ideal testing ground for investigating strategies to improve Chinese immigrant 
women’s  adherence  to screening  mammography.  Research  with Chinese  immigrants  in NYC  has 
revealed that only 23 -30% of women from this c ommunity had ever had a mammogram in their 
lifetime. This is a population with great need for increased access to breast cancer education and 
screening.  
The Health Belief Model (HBM) provides a framework for addressing cultural health barriers 
related to p reventive health care and cancer screening by positing that making a decision to 
engage in a health behavior is determined by weighing perceived threats versus benefits. Health 
education programs addressing individual and community -level barriers developed  using HBM 
constructs,  specifically  the Witness  Project,  has successfully  increased  participants’  breast  cancer 
knowledge and mammography screening uptake. The evidence -based Witness Project  uses 
narrative communication (e.g., storytelling, personal testim onials) to educate, persuade, and 
engage target communities about cancer prevention and screening. The appeal and success of 
narrative communication stem from its familiarity as a basic mode of human interaction. Our 
work  in minority  and immigrant  communit ies has demonstrated  that narrative  communication  can 
increase  participation  in breast  cancer  screening.  However,  the efficacy  of these  interventions  has 
not been empirically tested among Chinese immigrants. By integrating individual and 
community -level approaches, group -based narrative educational programs could play a 
significant  role in promoting  adoption  and repeat  use of breast  cancer  screening  amongst Chinese 
women.  
1) Objectives  
 
We seek to identify  cultural  beliefs  and attitudes  Chinese  immigrant  women  have  toward  breast 
cancer screening; and to utilize these findings to adapt and subsequently pilot test a narrative - 
based breast health education pr ogram for increasing screening mammograms in Chinese 
immigrant  women.  We hypothesize  that our culturally - and linguistically -adapted  breast  health 
education  program  will improve  screening  mammography  rates  in Chinese  immigrant  women.

Aim 1. Culturally and linguistically adapt the Witness Project, a narrative -based breast 
cancer education program for Chinese immigrant women. We will conduct individual 
interviews with community members (n=30) and gatekeepers/stakeholders (n=30) and draw 
from  our preliminary  work  and literature  review  to identify  and test components  of the Witness 
Project that should be adapted for Chinese immigrant women. Preferred language, English 
language  proficiency,  cultural  beliefs,  access  to health  care,  preferred  format  (group -based  vs. 
individual education), knowledge of breast cancer screening guidelines, and HBM predictors 
of screening behaviors will be  assessed.  
 
To be submitted later:  
Aim 2. Pilot test feasibility and acceptability of the Witness Project for C hinese immigrant 
women. We will pilot test the adapted intervention using 12 programs (4 each in Cantonese, 
Mandarin, and English) to assess feasibility and acceptability and to determine effect sizes 
for a future large -scale trial. Receipt of screening ma mmography and intentions to undergo 
mammography, as well as other HBM constructs (i.e., perceived risk, barriers, fatalism, and 
breast cancer knowledge) will be compared in a pre -post test design stratified by language 
(N=96).  
 
2) Background  
 
Although there are multiple social/environmental determinants of cancer screening, screening 
involves  an individual  deciding  whether  or not to engage  in the screening  behavior.48,49  The HBM 
asserts that an individual’s attitudes and beliefs (e.g., perceived benefits, perceived barriers) will 
determine their behavioral intentions.50 Therefore, improving breast cancer screening rates in 
Chinese immigrant women requires a deep understanding of the factors that influence decisions 
about  breast  cancer  screening  uptake.  Health  decision -making  models  theorize  that decisions  about 
a behavior are a function of an individual’s perceptions of the expected utility (benefit -cost ratio) 
of the behavior and of other cognitive factors (e.g., self -efficacy, perceived risk).1-3 Expected 
utility and Social Cognitive Theory constructs, such as observational learning through modeling 
of screening mammogram exams have been shown to predict engagement in cancer s creening 
behaviors.4-7 Specifically,  several  of our own studies  in colorectal  cancer  screening  have  provided 
data on attitudes and barriers regarding colorectal cancer screening including fear, fatalism, less 
perceived disease risk, medical mistrust, lack of knowledge and insurance  access.8-14 
However, to our knowledge, few studies have focused on attitudes and beliefs regarding 
breast cancer screening exams among Chinese immigrant women. Chinese immigrant women in 
NYC  emigrated  primarily  from  Fujian  province,  a very low resource  region,  and are linguistically, 
socioeconomically, and culturally different from Chinese women who have settled elsewhere in 
the US.15-19 Studies conducted by Chen20 and Chen et al.21 found that only 54 -67% of Chinese 
immigran t women in NYC had ever had a clinical breast exam and only 23% had ever completed 
a mammogram. Their studies also reported that English -speaking ability and greater years spent 
in the US were positive significant predictors of having undergone a clinical  breast

examination.20,21  Culturally  specific  barriers  and facilitators  were  not examined,  which  could  have 
provided  more  information  on how to address  the breast  cancer  screening  needs  of this population. 
We found no existing intervention targeting mammography screening in NYC Chinese 
immigrants,  though  pilot studies  with Chinese  immigrants  elsewhere  in the US have  indicated  that 
improving access, knowledge, and attitudes toward breast cancer sc reenings through health 
education programs can improve breast cancer screening  intentions.22-26 
Our preliminary work with Chinese women in NYC show that only 30% have had a 
mammogram in the past year and only 64% have had a mammogram within the past 2 year s 
(manuscript  under  review).  Because  we were  unable  to assess  years  in the US or immigrant  status 
in our preliminary work, we expect these numbers to be much lower for NYC Chinese women 
who are immigrants. Nonetheless, our findings demonstrate the need for  education regarding 
breast cancer screening and adherence to screening mammogram guidelines within this 
population . 
We have  conducted  robust,  culturally -targeted  outreach  into several  minority  communities. 
The Witness Project (WP) is a community -based breast cancer education program designed to 
meet educational and cultural levels of underserved African American women. The WP model is 
a belief and theory -based intervention incorporating the HBM,  locus of control beliefs, social 
learning theory, transtheoretical model of change and the 4MAT System.27,28 The program begins 
with a narrative  presentation  by a breast  cancer  survivor  who briefly  shares  her personal  experience 
of breast  cancer,  from  diagnosis  to treatment  and survivorship.  Lay volunteers  present  educational 
information about breast cancer risks and protective factors, demonstrate how to perform a breast 
self-examination and a question and answer session concludes the program. Research by  Jandorf 
(PI) et al. successfully replicated WP in 22 states at 40 unique sites including NYC.29-30,27 - 
28,31Replication was achieved using an implementation guide, locally produced, award winning 
video, and training curriculum developed by Erwin and Jando rf (now on NCI Cancer Control 
Planet RTIP). In NYC, we conducted hundreds of programs at a variety of community sites and 
have educated over 3,000 participants.32-35 This research demonstrates our ability to reach 
culturally  targeted  members  in the communi ty and our experience  of over 15 years  in community - 
based  research.  
Development  of Esperanza  y Vida : A unique  aspect  of the Witness  Project  is the ability  to 
adapt the program to another culture as evidenced by Esperanza y Vida (EyV). In 2003, Jandorf 
(PI) and colleagues initiated EyV to expand this breast educational program among  Latina 
populations in a culturally and linguistically congruent, community -based approach.33,34 EyV 
development was conducted with members of the target group, including qualitative studies, to 
ensure the adaptation would be culturally appropriate and meaningful.34-36 The social network 
characteristics  and language  preferences  (Spanish)  assessed  and integrated  into the intervention  to 
include such factors of where to present the programs (e.g. both community and faith -based 
locations)  and the need  to educate  men about  issues  related  to women’s  health.34,37  This successful 
replication and adaptation demonstrates our ability to adapt education programs through 
vigorous qualitative methods and pilot testing, as well as to address linguistic needs of different 
cultural  groups.

Narrative  communication  methods  are a widely  recognized  tool for mitigating  barriers  and 
effectively increasing a variety of health behaviors including cancer screening.38,39 Transporting 
narratives, or immersion into a story, can successfully change beliefs and motivate action.40 
Narrative  communication is a comfortable way of presenting information because people 
communicate with each other and learn in everyday life primarily through stories.15 By creating a 
feeling of similarity to and identification with the communicator, narrative comm unication can 
increase  an individual’s  perceived  risk regarding  a particular  health  related  behavior.1 People  with 
personal experiences make credible, believable messengers. Additionally, narratives can be 
particularly  useful  for conveying  cancer  information  because  they reduce  counterarguments  which 
can help individuals overcome barriers to seeking treatment.40 Narratives also diminish negative 
feelings towards unknown, difficult, or frightening procedures (e.g., screening), provide role 
models fo r behavior change and create new attitudes that are based on cognition and emotion.40 
Four distinct capabilities of narrative health communication are: “overcoming resistance, 
facilitating information processing, providing surrogate social connections, and  representing 
emotional and existential issues.”41 Narrative means of communication have been shown to lead 
to significant emotional responses, which subsequently have a large impact on behavioral 
decisions.42,43 This feature is a major strength of the nar rative  approach.38 
There is substantial evidence that community -based group narrative education cancer 
screening  programs  can be effective  in fostering  positive  health  behavior  change.28,29,39,44  Narrative 
communication has been shown to reduce message cou nterarguments, increase positive affect, 
foster identification with the communicator and lead to better engagement with the message; 
thereby reducing perceived barriers, increasing message recall, and promoting discussion with 
family members.39,45 One stud y has found that participants exposed to narrative messages were 
two to four times more likely to engage in health promoting actions and information -seeking 
behavior  than those  unexposed.46 While  numerous  studies  have  illustrated  the success  of narrative 
communication over didactic communication in terms of various types of behavior change, 
narrative education formats have not been developed within the context of Chinese immigrants. 
However, one study with immigrant women in Canada suggests Chine se women might  be 
receptive to interventions involving narrative  stories.47 
Replicating  and expanding  the application  of this model  to Chinese  immigrant  women  will 
not only potentially improve the health outcomes of this population, but can also demonstrat e the 
effectiveness of the HBM in yet another minority population, increasing the robustness of this 
approach.

3) Setting of the Human  Research  
Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, all interviews will be conducted over the phone and audio 
recorded so that we can create transcripts of the information. Participant recruitment, as well as 
pilot testing of the educational intervention in Year 2 will be condu cted at community and faith - 
based partner sites, including, but not limited  to: 
 
Saint Margaret’s House: 49 Fulton Street, New York, NY 10038 
Henry Street Settlement: 334 Madison Street, New York, NY 10002  
Chinese American Planning Council: 4101 8th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11232  
 
 
4) Resources Available to Conduct the Human  Research  
Our team has successfully recruited Chinese -speaking participants into previous research (e.g., 
IRB-18-00111) and have demonstrated p rior recruitment rates of over 70% from immigrant and 
minority groups. The PI, Jandorf is a Professor and the Director of the Office of Community 
Engagement at the Tisch Cancer Institute at Mount Sinai. She is an expert in qualitative research 
and has over  20 years of experience conducting community -based research. Furthermore, we 
have strong collaborations with community site leaders who have helped recruit participants and 
hosted programs with us in the past (and have provided a Letter of Support for this  proposal).  
Thus, we are confident that we will be able to identify and consent 60 eligible subjects (30 
community members and 30 gatekeepers/stakeholders) for qualitative interview calls for Aim 1.

organizations serving the Chinese immigrant community) and have successfully recruited 
Chines e immigrant women into prior studies (manuscripts under review), and therefore 
anticipate successful recruitment for this proposed research.  
For Aim 1:  
As we have done before, we will distribute IRB -approved flyers through various venues 
(e.g., at communit y sites, community newsletters, community listservs) and will ask partner 
site staff to identify/reach out to individuals who might be interested and share our contact 
information with these individuals. All participants will receive $30 for their particip ation. 
HIPAA authorization and informed consent will be obtained prior to participation.  
Individuals who are interested in participating will work with our research staff to set up a 
time for a phone interview at the time most convenient for them. At this time, all aspects of 
the study will be explained and those interested in participating wi ll undergo the informed 
consent process. Signed consent will be captured electronically through the RedCap platform 
or via phone consent with a witness.

We will collect name and phone number and/or email of potential subjects in or der to contact 
them. After the subject is done with study and gift card has been sent, we will remove 
subject’s phone number and/or email collected. All data will be de -identified and participants 
will be assigned a numeric code linked with their data so t hey cannot be identified in study 
data analyses, publications, or presentations. Only the PI and approved study personnel will 
have access to the files. Any physical copies of identifying information will be kept in locked 
cabinets until the information ca n be transferred into electronic form, at which point any 
physical copies will be destroyed. All data will be saved on the department’s secure, 
encrypted server. This data will be stored for 7 years.

This study does not involve more than minimal risk to subjects.  
j) Withdrawal of  Subjects  
A subject may request to withdraw from the study at any time by notifying the PI (or if 
withdrawal occurs during the interview or educational pr ogram, the research assistant). The 
PI’s email and phone number will be provided to all participants prior to beginning the 
interviews or programs and will be listed on the consent forms.  
Procedures for Investigator to Withdraw Subjects:  
There are no antic ipated circumstances under which subjects will be withdrawn from the 
research without their consent.  
 
5) Risks to  Subjects  
Some participants may become stressed or anxious when thinking or discussing breast 
cancer, undergoing screening, and potential developm ent of breast cancer.  
 
To minimize  risk in our study,  research  personnel  will adhere  to a strict  protocol  developed  by 
the PI and Co -Is. Prior to starting the interview or program, research assistants will inform 
participants  of the potentially  sensitive  nature  of the topic  and remind  participants  of their right 
to withdraw from the study at any time or to decline to answer any questions that make them 
feel uncomfortable.  
6) Provisions for Research Related  Harm/Injury  
This study involves minimal risk to subjects.  
7) Potential Benefits to  Subjects  
Subjects might not derive any direct benefit from the research. However, possible benefits to 
subjects may be increased knowledge about breast cancer, breast health, and breast ca ncer 
screening.  
8) Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of  Subjects  
Collected information will be stored on the department’s secured intranet drive. Following 
participation and after gift cards have been mailed/emailed to the subject, we will not need to 
keep any contact information and will delete this information from files.  
Confidentiality of each subject's information will be protected with utmost care. All subjects 
will be assigned a numeric code for record -keeping purposes. A cross -referencing fil e 
containing identifying information and numeric codes will be password protected and stored 
on the Department’s secured intranet drive and will only be accessible to the PI and approved 
study personnel. In addition, all data will kept in a file on the enc rypted on the Department’s 
intranet  drive.  Any and all physical  documents  with subject  information  will be kept in a locked 
file cabinet  in the PI’s office  at the Icahn  School  of Medicine  at Mount  Sinai  until they are

9) Economic Impact on  Subjects  
There are no anticipated economic impact on the participants. We will provide subjects with a  
$30 gift card as a token of appreciation for their time.  
10) Payments to  Subjects  
Subjects will receive a $30 gift card as a token of appreciation for their time.  
11) Consent Process  
The standard “SOP HRP -090 Informed Consent Process for Research” will be utilized 
to obtain permission from subjects to participate in the research study.  
 
Eligible patients who are interested in the study will be provided with the informed co nsent 
form. Research assistants will go through the consent form with eligible patients and answer 
any questions. For Aim 1, informed consent will be conducted through the RedCap platform, 
modeled after the standard MSH informed consent form, or via phone consent with a witness, 
depending on patient preference.  
 
The consent form will explicitly state that the study involves research regarding Chinese 
immigrant  women’s  barriers  and facilitators  to breast  cancer  screening.  It will include  that risk 
to the pat ient is minimal. We will explain that data will be de -identified and kept encrypted 
and password protected. We will explain who and how to contact for answers to pertinent 
questions  about  the research  and research  subjects’  rights,  including  withdrawal  processes.  The 
consent will include a statement that participation is voluntary, refusal to participate will 
involve no penalty or decrease in benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled, and that 
the subject may discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to 
which the subject is otherwise  entitled.  
Children  
Children  will not be enrolled  in this study  because  children  are not routinely  screened  for breast 
cancer.  
Cognitively Impaired Adults – N/A 
English and Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese) speaking Chinese women will be 
allowed to participate in the study.  
 
12) Process to Document Consent in  Writing  
The standard PPHS consent template will be used, “SOP -091 Written Documentation of 
Consent.” For A im 1 participants, consent will be documented electronically via REDCap or 
over the phone with a witness, depending on participant preference.

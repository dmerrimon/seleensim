 Scientific Background  
More than half o f the 1.4 million long -term care nursing home  (NH)  residents  have a 
diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias  (ADRD), which we will refer to as 
dementia throughout this report . 1 Residents living with dementia experience devastating 
negative effects associated with these  progressive, irreversible conditions that result in loss of 
independence and subsequent long -term institutionalization . As the disease progresses, 
disruptions in the resident’s daily routine, difficulty communicating perso nal needs, and 
environmental overstimulation or sensory deprivation often trigger t he behavioral and 
psychological symptoms of dementia (e.g., agitation) . 2-4 If untreated, these  symptoms result in 
negative side effects such as self -inflicted pain, limited food/liquid intake, accidental falls, and 
injuries to self or others  (e.g., residents, NH staff) , increasing the risk of hospi talization and 
death. 4  
In the early 2010s, more than 30% of NH residents were taking antipsychotic 
medication. 5 To reduce this antipsychotic medication use in NH residents, the Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) championed a national initiat ive to enhance NH dementia 
care, starting in 2012. This comprehensive program, which had a goal of reducing national NH 
resident antipsychotic medication use, included NH staff and state surveyor training, 
established minimum standards for dementia care, a nd introduced a new quality measure (i.e., 
the percent of long -stay residents who received an antipsychotic medication) that all CMS 
certified NHs were mandated to report. 6 
Off-label antipsychotic  medications, while commonly used to address the behavioral 
and psychological symptoms of dementia , have been shown to be ineffective and cause harm 
to the person living with dementia, 7 including an elevated risk of death. 8 By 2019, 
approximately 23 % of  NH residents living with dementia  were administered off -label 
antipsychotics . 5,9 However, these off -label medications have significant negative impacts on the 
resident’s mortality and quality of life, primarily due to inducing withdrawal and lethargy. 10-12  
Given these poor outcomes, f amilies, ADRD and resident  advocates, and recent national 
initiatives have prioritized the reduction of antipsychotic  medication use and shifted attention 
to increased use of non -pharmacological interventions  in the NH conte xt. 6,13 -15 In particular, 
CMS  has recommended NHs reduc e antipsychotic  medication use to improve the quality of 
dementia  care . 6 Further, based on our preliminary data, family members and NH providers 
strongly support the use of non -pharmacological approaches for dementia care.  
Common features of such approaches include training staff to understand the disease 
process of dementia and equip them with strategies  to address  triggers for negativ e resident 
behaviors, such as disruptions in routine or communication difficulties. 15 Given the multi -
faceted nature of triggers, evidence suggests that non -pharmacological treatments must 
incorporate a wide range of NH staff, such as  professional healthc are providers  and direct care 
provider s. 13,16 First, professional healthcare providers  (e.g., include registered nurses, licensed 
practical nurses, social services, and rehabilitation practitioners/therapists ) collaborate to 
develop a comprehensive, multi -dimensional plan of care to address factors that precipitate 
Page 3 of 12 
 behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia  (e.g., triggers ). Second, NH direct care 
providers (e.g., certified nursing assistants [CNAs], dietary staff, social services, activities 
depart ment staff), ancillary support staff (e.g., housekeeping), as well as family , are trained by 
the professional healthcare providers with strategies to support the customized plan of care. 4,17 
Collaboration across these individuals ensures maximum support t o minimize episodes of 
extreme behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia , thereby promoting optimal 
function, enhancing quality of life for the resident, and improving safety of all individuals.  
Two leading approaches ( team - and problem -based ) to dementia care, prioritized by our 
community -partners , help staff implement non -pharmacological, resident -centered dementia 
care. Both approaches have randomized control trial ( RCT)-level evidence to support efficacy 
and integration into clinical practice. 4,11,18 -23 The NHs using the team -based  (TB) approach to 
integrated dementia care  provide core training to all professional healthcare providers , direct 
care providers , ancillary support staff, and administrators , using a common language across 
disciplines to support continuity and sustainability. Results of randomized trials have indicated 
that the  collaborative  TB approach decreases the use of medications as well as the frequency 
and severity of resident  agitation, pacing, and repetitive vocaliz ation, compared to the 
minimum mandated usual care. 19,24 -26 In contrast, the multidisciplinary approach for problem -
based (PB) dementia  care  draws on the expertise of the individual professional healthcare 
providers (e.g., speech language pathology, occup ational therapy, nursing ) to target issues that 
arise. For example, when residents have a change in status (e.g., weight loss, accidental fall 
event, change in self -care or mobility, emergence of behaviors during morning care routine), 
the nurses request a  screen to be conducted by  the relevant healthcare providers to determine 
the need for a resident  evaluation by the respective discipline(s), revision to care plan, and 
treatment to address the emergent issue (i.e., change in status).  These providers then train all 
other staff and family  in resident -specific strategies and adjust the care plan as need ed. In 
randomized trials, the PB approach has been found to d ecrease the frequency and severity of 
challenging behaviors (including aggression and calling out), as well as reduce the use of 
antipsychotic  medications, when compared to usual care. 25,27  
Despite evidence supporting TB and PB  approaches to dementia care, clear gaps in 
evidence limiting implementation exist. Guided by our community -partners , our team identified 
the following gaps in evidence and variability in practice patterns that require urg ent attention:   
First, although efficacy studies support both approaches, 4,11,18 -23 the underlying studies 
have only compared the two approaches to individual, discipline -specific interventions or usual 
care. 19,24,25,27 These two interventions have not been compared to each other; thus, it is not 
clear which approach is most effective g iven the varied resident  and NH contexts  across the US .  
Second, prior studies have been limited by small samples of residents  living  with 
dementia  (Ns=4 to 250) and use of researchers as opposed to NH personnel for intervention 
delivery.17-19 Although sup portive of feasibility and general efficacy, previous studies have not 
provided professional healthcare providers , other NH staff , or NH administrators with the 
evidence  to support widespread implementation, due to the above -noted problems.  
Page 4 of 12 
 Third, there i s currently no standardized way in which  professional healthcare providers  
and other NH staff communicate their efforts to ensure that residents living with dementia  
receive appropriate daily care. Although all NHs provide specialized services (e.g., occupational 
therapy, recreation therapy, nursing), few NHs support the coordination of care in a 
predetermined manner, resulting in  NH staff often receiving training or information to support 
their interactions with a resident only after an incident of extreme behavioral and psychological 
symptoms of dementia occurs.  
Although these care approaches are currently used in care delivery , there is significant 
variability in p ractical implementation. This variability is primarily due to wide differences in 
education and dementia -specific training across the numerous NH staff involved in dementia 
care. Efforts to minimize behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia through  non-
pharmacological approaches must better account for the diverse education and training needs 
of the collective NH staff who all contribute to the care for residents on a day -to-day basis.  
The COVID -19 pandemic altered NH care delivery  and further exace rbated existing 
factors that contribute to aggression, agitation, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of 
dementia  among residents . The pandemic  policies put in place to minimize viral spread further 
perpetuated the challenges associated with caring f or this vulnerable  population. 28-30 This new 
“normal” created a tension between life safety and an individual’s quality of life. For example, 
NHs had to restrict family visitation per CMS guidance, eliminate all resident group activities  
and congregate me als, and constrain resident access to limited areas of the NH campus  to 
mitigate spread. 31,32 These examples reflect disruptions in the  resident’s routine and changes in 
the environment, all of which contributed to potential exacerbation of behavioral and  
psychological symptoms  associated with dementia . As a result, these COVID -19 policies  
fostered social isolation and environmental under -stimulation among residents, 32 increasing 
the likelihood of a resident  living  with dementia experiencing behavioral and psychological 
symptoms and expanding the risk of adverse events (e.g., functional decline).  These infection 
control policies had a cascade of negative effects on mood, cognitive status, physical function, 
and quality of life among NH residen ts and staff; and were emotionally traumatic for families 
and others who c ould not  visit their family member living with dementia in person . 32-38 Yet, 
there is a need to evaluate the best approaches to provide dementia care, given heightened 
infection con trol policies.  
Despite national  initiatives (pre -COVID -19) to reduce off -label medication for these 
residents, 4,6,11,18 -23,39 there is growing concern that the use of off -label antipsychotics  may yet 
again be on the rise to manage behavioral and psycholog ical symptoms of dementia. Strategies 
that are used in NHs as part of a non -pharmacological  comprehensive, multi -dimensional plan 
(e.g., group activities, consistent routine) may be hindered due to COVID -19-related infection 
control policies and staffing s hortages. Thus, given the multiple challenges NHs face in trying to 
care for residents, manage behavioral and psychological symptoms among residents living with 
dementia, and control the spread of COVID -19, NHs may rely more heavily on pharmacological 
strategies .

Study Objectives  
The initial study protocol was designed and initiated prior to the emergence  of the 
COVID -19 pandemic.  However, with the emergence of the COVID -19 pandemic, our study was 
modified to also include looking at the impact of the pandemic. Thus, two questions were 
addressed  by this study:  (a) is there a statistically significant difference in resident outcomes  
among NH residents living with dementia based on the non-pharmaco logical approach to 
dementia care? And (b)  How did these non -pharmacological approaches compare after the 
emergence of COVID -19 when residents and staff faced social isolation, infection control 
policies, and staffing shortages?  These questions were addressed via three aims:  
Aim 1: Compare the effectiveness of two non -pharmacological approaches for dementia 
care ( TB and PB) in  reducing the use of antipsychotic medications and behavioral and 
psychological symptoms in NH residents  living with dementia.  
Aim 2: Determine the effectiveness of the two non -pharmacological approaches on NH 
residents living with dementia and staff safety and wellness.  
Aim 3: Identify benefits, limitations, barriers, and facilitators of each approach fro m the 
perspectives of the NH staff and NH residents’ families. This qualitative data will augment the 
resident -level quantitative data by more fully capturing the impact of the two approaches on 
resident outcomes; resident -staff, staff -family, and resident -family interactions; and staff job 
roles before and after the emergence of COVID -19, which will guide future implementation.  
 
Study Design  & Methods  
The study was initiated in January 2018. As of March 2020, 80 NHs had been recruited, 
randomized and staff training delivered. The COVID -19 pandemic emerged in early March 2020. 
Subsequent national lockdown of NHs and leadership requests to not communicate with the 
NHs as they navigate the early days of the pandemic resulted in a pause on all research rel ated 
communication between the study team and study sites.  
As the pandemic evolved, the study team developed a plan for moving forward, which 
included assessing the ability for NHs to re -engage in the study. Due to the negative impact of 
the pandemic, 27 o f the 80 NHs were unable to re -engage. The remaining 53 NHs were included 
in the revised study protocol. This change resulted in the original cluster randomized control 
trial becoming two sets of exploratory analyses differentiated by the emergence of the COVID -
19 pandemic.  
Exploratory quantitative analyses were conducted for 53 NHs ( TB n=17, PB n=36 NHs). 
Primary resident -level outcomes included antipsychotic medication use, behavioral symptoms, 
wandering, and rejection of care, which were extracted from the Minimum Data Set and 
Page 6 of 12 
 electronic medical records. Six -month outcomes were captured prior to the emergence of 
COVID -19, while 12 - and 18 -month outcomes were after the start of the pandemic.  
As a result of the COVID -19 pandemic and the significant i mpact it had on the study, the 
team bolstered the scope of the qualitative interviews from those that were originally planned.  
Qualitative data was collected via individual interviews with 327 NH staff ( TB n=168, PB n=159) 
and 30 family caregivers ( TB n= 1 3, PB n= 17) to explore their perspective of the two 
approaches as it relates to resident outcomes and training. Using mixed methods, quantitative 
and qualitative data were integrated to determine whether these sources confirm each other, 
provide emergent,  or conflicting information.  
 
 
Eligibility Criteria  
Facility -level inclusion criteria required eligible NHs to (a) not have an existing dementia 
program targeting reduction of off -label antipsychotic medication use, (b) serve an average of 
>60 long -term care residents living with dementia, (c) be a CMS certified NH (e.g., conduct 
regularly scheduled resident assessments), and (d) comply with CMS’s annual staff dementia 
care training requirement (i.e., 4 hours).  Exclusion criteria included (a) NH s located in states 
that require more than four hours of dementia -specific training annually were excluded, (b) 
NHs that had existing dementia care programs which required staff to engage in additional 
training beyond the CMS minimum training requirements and more than the four hours 
required by the state.  
 
Eligible NH residents included those that (a) have an existing diagnosis of ADRD or a 
Cognitive Function Scale  score indicating Mild, Moderate, or Severe Cognitive Impairment, (b) 
are 65 years of age or older, and (c) are long -stay residents (>100 days). Post -acute care 
patients admitted for a brief stay (<100 days) and respite stay patients were excluded.  
 
Eligible staff were employed by a participating NH and included all staff categories, (a) 
professional healthcare providers, including licensed staff with professional degrees, such as 
registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, rehabilitation practition ers (e.g., occupational [OT], 
physical [PT], speech therapists [SLP]), certified therapeutic recreation specialist, dieticians, (b) 
direct care providers such as certified nursing assistants [CNA], activities department staff, 
nutrition services personnel (e.g., dining services/aids); (c) ancillary support staff, including 
environmental services workers (e.g., maintenance, housekeeping, kitchen staff) and 
administrative staff (e.g., reception, billing department, medical records); and (d) 
administrators, in cluding executive directors, directors of nursing.  
 
Eligible family caregivers were the primary contact for a resident living with dementia in 
a participating NH (e.g., relative, spouse, partner, friend, per neighbor).  
 
Statistical Considerations  
Page 7 of 12 
 Descript ive analyses included calculating appropriate central tendencies (e.g., mean) for 
each outcome variable. We examined outcomes separately before and after the emergence of 
COVID -19. To assess validity of randomization, we compared resident characteristics a nd 
outcomes and NH characteristics by arm for the six -month baseline period prior to training 
(December 16, 2018 to June 15, 2019).  
 
We used the intention -to-treat analytic approach to conduct the exploratory 
quantitative analysis.  A difference -in-differe nces analytic model was used, rather than 
comparing outcomes across the arms during each six -month period after the training, to 
account for baseline differences in resident characteristics and outcomes. The estimating 
equation is as follows:  
𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 𝑖𝑗𝑡=𝛽𝑜+𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡𝛽1+(𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡𝑥𝑇𝐵𝑖)𝛽2+𝑋𝑖𝑗𝛿+𝑁𝐻𝑖+𝑢𝑖𝑗𝑡 
where 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑖𝑗𝑡 is a binary variable of having the outcome measure of interest for resident j 
residing in NH i at time t. Post  is an indicator for being in th e follow -up period after 
implementation of approaches, which would be 1 for t=1 and 0 for t=0. TB is an indicator for NH 
i, which would be 1 if assigned to team -based approach arm and 0 if assigned to problem -based 
approach arm. The comparative effectivene ss (treatment effect) of the team -based approach 
relative to the problem -based approach would be estimated with B2, which is the coefficient 
estimate of post t x TB i representing residents in team -based approach NHs during the 
respective follow -up period wh ile accounting secular time trends ( post t) and time invariant 
characteristics of NH using nursing home fixed effects (NH i). In addition, the model accounts for 
a set of individual resident characteristics including age, sex, race/ethnicity, Cognitive Funct ion 
Scale, number of valid assessments resident had for outcome during period ( Xij). Models were 
analyzed using complete case analysis.  Standard errors were clustered at the NH level. Linear 
probability models were implemented for ease of interpretation; regression coefficients and 
standard errors are presented in percentage point units. Robustness checks were conducted by 
implementing logistic regression difference -in-differences models with NH characteristics 
rather than NH -level fixed -effects to estimate the treatment effect. Marginal effects from the 
logistic models were computed to complement the linear probability regression models.40 
Finally, stratified analyses were conducted to examine whether treatment effects were 
different among residents with moderate to severe dementia vs. mild dementia.  All analyses 
were conducted using Stata 14.0 (Stata, College Station, TX).  
For resident -level primary and secondary outcomes, we conducted difference -in-
differences analyses using baseline data and the first six months of post -implementation data 
(six-month outcomes; September 15, 2019 to March 14, 2020) to compare outcomes across the 
two study arms, prior to the emergence of the pandemic. Next, we conducted analyses of 
resident outcomes after the emergence of pandemic spanning post -implementation months (a) 
7-12 (March 15, 2020 -September 14, 2020) and (b) 13 -18 (September 15, 2020 -March 14, 2021 ) 
(12-month and 18 -month outcomes analyses, respectively). Observations with missing resident 
covariates were excluded from the analyses.  
For staff and resident secondary safety outcomes, we calculated the monthly rate (per 
100 residents) of each outcome f or each NH that submitted data each month. We averaged the 
Page 8 of 12 
 monthly measures available for each NH and then examined descriptive statistics (e.g., mean) 
to compare the outcomes across two arms during the first five months of implementation.  
 
Qualitative Ana lysis  
The objectives of the staff analyses were to explore (a) perceived barriers and 
facilitators surrounding the intervention approach, (b) perspectives on the training modules 
(e.g., adequacy, acceptability, satisfaction, burden), (c) the quality of resident -staff interactions 
(i.e., how staff training contributed to patient outcomes) and (d) training program 
recommendations for modifications (i.e., sustainability, scalability). We used a three -phase 
team -based rapid qualitative analysis approach. 41,42 In phase one, interview transcripts were 
reviewed and summarized by domains (based on interview questions) and categories (emerging 
inductively) into a coding template. Phase two required reviewers to reduce, synthesize, and 
look for similarities and di fferences in the data through the use of matrices. In phase three, 
summary tabulation procedures occurred in which reviewers combined data (e.g., NH cases, 
care approaches), developing themes. 42 We explored patterns and variations in themes within 
and acr oss cases and care approaches. 43,44 
We identified themes, patterns, and relationships that emerged from family caregivers 
that contextualized quantitative and qualitative staff findings. 45 Given the paucity of knowledge 
regarding the experiences of famil y caregivers of NH residents living with dementia, we used 
qualitative analysis, specifically a grounded theory approach, to further analyze caregiver 
interviews. 46-48 We employed open, axial, and selective coding to understand the perceptions 
of family c aregivers and create a data -driven conceptual model of family caregiver experiences.

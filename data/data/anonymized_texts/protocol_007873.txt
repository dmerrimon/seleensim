Protocol Number  
SKM16-LYT-MEL Amendment 1 
Protocol Title Randomized, Double-blinded, Split -face Study comparing the 
Cosmetic Efficacy and Tolerability of Two Topical Products in 
Subjects with Moderate Facial Melasma
Study Duration 3 months (12 Weeks )
Study Population 20 health y subjects with Fitzpatrick Skin T ypes III-VI 
Objectives To evaluate and compare the ef ficacy and tolerability of two 
topical products in the improv ement of facial melasma  
Study Design Single site, investigator-initi ated, double-blinded, parallel arm, 
randomized treatment, split-face,  12-week study comparing the 
efficacy and tolerability of SkinMedica’s cosmetic topical brightener versus generic hydroqui none 4% topical prescription 
cream. A total of 20 healthy subjects will be enrolled into this 
study. Subjects will be screened and randomized at Baseline and 
will return for visits at Weeks 4, 8 and 12. The test products will 
be applied only to the affected areas  (dark patches) twice a day, 
morning and evening, every day for 12 weeks. Ancillary products will be provided fo
rbasic dail y skincare re gimen use. 
Study Products  SkinMedica Facial Cleanser 
 SkinMedica Rejuvenative Moisturizer 
 SkinMedica Essential Defense Mineral Shield Broad 
Spectrum SPF 35 Sunscreen 
 Test Product A (Lytera 2.0)  Test Product B 
(4% H ydroquinone Topical Cream ) 
Eligibility Criteria Subjects aged 18+  
with s ymmetrical moderate facial melasma. 
 
 
1.0  BACKGROUND 
 Melasma is a common disorder of hyperpigm entation which typically presents as brown 
or grayish brown macules on the face, in cluding the forehead, malar region, upper lip 
and chin. Melasma is commonly observed in wo men with Fitzpatrick skin types III to V 
(1), especially Asian and Hispanic women, although all skin types can be affected.   
 Contributing causes of melasma may include ultraviolet irradi ation, oral contraceptives, 
hormone replacement therapy, pregnancy, and thyroid dysfunction (2) however the exact etiology are not yet fully understood.

  Version Date: 26Oct16 Many patients find the uneven skin t one appearance caused by melasma to be 
cosmetically unacceptable.  Finding a succe ssful treatment remains challenging and 
frustrating. Therapies include broad-spectrum sunscreens, hy droquinone, tretinoin, kojic 
acid, alpha hydroxy acids, salicy lic acid, and chemical peels.  
 
The treatment of hyperpigmentation a ssociated with skin aging and melasma is 
challenging due to the prolonge d time to respond and its high relapse rate when therapy 
is discontinued.  Patients are also required to avoid sunlight to improve therapeutic 
results. Hydroquinone is cu rrently the gold standard for the topical treatment of 
hyperpigmentation and melasma.  
2.0  STUDY OBJECTIVE 
 The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of SkinMedica’s 
cosmetic topical brightener versus 4% hydroquinone in the improvement of the 
appearance of moderate facial melasma over the course of 12 weeks.

6.0 ASSESSMENTS  
 6.1 Clinical Grad
ing of Efficacy Parameters  
 
Clinical grading of the efficacy parameter will be performed at t he study visits indicated. 
Hyperpigmentation will be assessed on the left and the right side  of each subject’s 
face separately. 
 
Melasma Severity Rating Scale: 
At the screening/baseline visit and the end of treatment visit (week 12), the 
Invesgator will assess the subject’s facial  skin for the severity of symmetrical 
facial melasma using the following Mela sma Severity Rating Scale on the left and 
right facial sides. Subjects must present with a score of 2 for the left and the right 
facial sides to be enrolled into the study. 
Score H yperpi gmentation Status
0 Cleared: color of melasma lesions 
approximately equivalent to 
surrounding normal skin or with minimal residual h
yperpi gmentation
1 Mild: color slightly darker than the 
surroundin g normal skin
2 Moderate: color moderately darker 
than the surroundin g normal skin
3 Severe: color markedly darker than 
the surroundin g normal skin

Page 14 of 29 
  Version Date: 26Oct16 Overall Hyperpigmentation Scale: 
At all visits (baseline, weeks 4, 8 and 12) , the Investigator will globally assess the 
subject’s left and right facial sides fo r overall hyperpigm entation using the 
following ten point scale (0 – 9): 
None  
(Score of 0)  
Skin is normal in color with no evidence of hyperpigmentation  
Mild  
(Score of 1, 2 or 3) Several brown spots with increas ed pigmentation; they are 
small in size and slightly darker than surrounding skin 
Moderate  
(Score of 4, 5 or 6) Many brown spots with increas ed pigmentation; they are 
medium in size and much darker than surrounding skin 
Severe  
(Score of 7, 8 or 9) Many large brown spots with increased pigmentation; they 
are large in size and markedly darker than surrounding skin
 
 
Half-face Evaluation of Melasma Area Severity Index (MASI) Score 
At all visits, (baseline, weeks 4, 8 and 12), the Investigator will assign a grade for 
the left and right facial sides, for each of the below units, for the variable A 
(percentage of each area involved), D (dar kness of pigment) and P (pattern of 
involvement), as described in detail below.   
Calculations will be conducted by the s ponsor upon receipt of the completed 
CRFs. 
3 variables are assessed for each half- facial unit : 
- Total Area Involved ( A) 
- Darkness of pigment ( D)  
- Homogeneity ( H) 
 
Variable Definitions: 
A = A numerical value is assigned for th e corresponding percentage of the 
total area of the facial segment being assessed.   
This value represents ONLY the percent of the area invo lved, not the pattern or 
darkness of the pigment.  
0=  No involvement 
1= <10% involvement 
2= 10-29% involvement 
3= 30-49% involvement 
4= 50-69% involvement 
5= 70-89% involvement 
6= 90-100% involvement

Page 15 of 29 
  Version Date: 26Oct16 D = Darkness of the pigment compared to adjacent normal pigment.   
0= Normal skin color  
1= Slightly darker than normal color 
2 = Mild hyperpigmentation 
3= Modrate hyperpigmentation,clearl y and distinctly darker than normal 
pigment 
4 = Severe hyperpigmentation, virtually black pigment  
 
H = The homogeneity of the pigmentation will be assessed using the below 
scale:  
0= Normal skin color without evidence of hyperpigmentation 
1= Specks of involvement  
2 = Small patchy areas of in volvement < 1.5 cm diameter   
3 = Patches of involvement> 2 cm diameter   
4 = Uniform skin involvement  without any clear areas  
 
Calculation of the hal f-face MASI score:  
To calculate the half-face MASI score, t he sum of the severity grade for darkness 
(D) and homogeneity (H) is multiplied by t he numerical value of the areas (A) 
involved and by the percentages of the four facial areas (10-30%). 
 
Total Half-Face MASI score:  
Half Forehead 0.15(D+H)A + One Mala r Side 0.3 (D+H)A + Half Chin 
0.05(D+H)A 
 
 
Investigator’s Global Improvement Assessment- Overall 
Hyperpigmentation: 
 
The expert grader will also score an In vestigator’s Global Improvement 
Assessment for Overall Hyperpigmentation on the left and right facial sides at all 
follow-up visits (weeks 4, 8, and 12). 
0=No change or worsening 
1=Mild improvement (~25% overall improvement) 2=Moderate improvement (~50% overall improvement) 3=Marked improvement (~75%  overall improvement) 
4=Complete clearing/Dramatic improv ement (~95%+ overa ll improvement) 
 
6.2 Investigator’s Tolerability Assessment 
Tolerability of the test pr oducts will be assessed through the capture of adverse events 
reported throughout the study per iod. Any adverse event(s) ex perienced by the subject

  Version Date: 26Oct16 during the study period, whether  related to the treatment or  not, will be recorded in the 
“Case Report Form.” 
6.3 Subject MELASQOL Assessment  
Subjects will complete the MELASQOL assessement regarding their full face at the 
baseline visit and their left and right facial sides at week 12. The MELASQOL is a 
validated assessment to help measure the emotional and psychological impact of 
melasma (3).  This questionnaire is found in   
 6.4 Subject Self-Assessment Questionnaires  Subjects will complete a Sponsor-provided se
lf-assessment questionnaire at follow-up 
visits at weeks 4, 8, and 12. The assessment consists in a personal and subjective evaluation of their facial skin quality on the left and right side during and after the 
treatment by the subject. In  addition, the assessment serves to evaluate the self-
perceived cosmetic efficacy of the treat ment and the product attributes. This 
questionnaire is f ound in  
 6.5 Imaging Procedures Photograp
hs will be taken at all visits utilizing standardized conditions for all subjects.  
The skin must be cleansed prior to photography to remove any makeup, including foundation makeup, lipstick/ gloss and eye shadow. The settings for the exposure, 
lighting, flash, and focal length will be maintained constant over the course of the study.  
 Ensure that subjects jewelry is remov ed from ears/neck and hair is pushed back away 
from the face, ensuring that no stray hairs are in the facial area. Subjects will be photographed using an appropriate  clinical digital photography system 
 at highest resolution in a 
consistent position. Importantly, the phot ography should be taken to enable comparison 
of baseline photos with later photos taken at the end of the treatment period. For 
instance, if available, the overlay functi on must be used. As each photograph is being 
taken, it should be viewed to ensure that it is in focus and is similar to its baseline 
counterpart in all technical aspects, includi ng lighting, distance and angle. In addition, 
the face should be captured in neutral faci al expressions and neutral angles (e.g., 
avoiding hypo- or hyperex tension of the neck).  
 Photos using the  will be taken from three angles to enable the improvement to 
be clearly noticed: full frontal (0 °) and at profile from the left (45°) and from the right side 
(45°). Photos will be taken at controlled di stances under standard r oom lighting. Cross-
polarized, parallel- polarized and visible light images will be acquired along with both 
blue fluorescence and ultraviolet fluore scence images. During the photography, the 
subjects will be asked to keep their eyes closed. 
 
6.6 Mexameter Instrume ntation Procedures 
Two target hyperpigmented lesi ons will be selected from the left (1) and the right (2) 
malar facial areas and measured by the mexameter, and instrument that measures

target lesion locations as at the baseline visit within each subject. 
One target “normal” measur ement will also be taken from an unaffected skin area on 
the face representing normal skin. The values  from the target hyperpigmented lesions 
will be compared to the normal lesion value. 
 
7.0  STATISTICS

13.0 ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING 
 
13.1 Serious And/Or Adverse Event Reporting 
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence, that, at any dose: 
 results in death; 
 is life-threatening; 

Protocol: SKM16-LYT-MEL                           Sponsor: SkinMedica, Inc.  
 
Page 20 of 29 
  Version Date: 26Oct16  requires in-subject hospitalization or pr olongation of existing hospitalization; 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
 is an important medical event. 
 
Throughout the study, subjec ts will be monitored for signs and symptoms of 
adverse events.  An adverse event is any pathological or unintended change in 
the structure, function or chemistry of the body that  occurs during the study, 
irrespective of causality, including any ill ness, injury, toxicity, sensitivity, or 
sudden death.  The condition must eit her not be present pre-study or must 
worsen in either intensity or frequency during the study. 
 
An unanticipated adverse study drug event is any drug-related adverse event, 
which is not identified in nature, severity , or frequency in current literature on the 
test article.  
All adverse events, including serious and study drug related or unanticipated 
adverse drug events, must be recorded and assessed by th e Investigator.  In the 
event of an adverse event, serious adverse  event or unanticipated adverse drug 
event, the physician will prov ide optimal subject care. 
 
Subjects who have had a serious adverse event must be followed clinically until 
all parameters, including labor atory values, have either returned to normal or are 
otherwise explained.  
Any serious adverse event or unanticipat ed adverse drug event occurring in this 
study will be analyzed and identif ied by the investigator and reported to the IRB 
within 10 business days, as per IND regulations and FDA Guidance. The 
investigator will also determine the event re lated to the study drug and report that 
event to the manufacture of the device, if necessary. 
 
Serious adverse events will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours (or the 
next working day). The main Sponsor c ontact for serious adverse events is: 
 
 
 
 
 If death was the outcome of the event  on the initial SAE Report, a Follow-
up/Final Report, including autopsy report, when performed, must be completed.

Page 21 of 29 
  Version Date: 26Oct16 13.2 Pregnancy During The Study 
If a subject of childbearing potential becomes pregnant at any time while 
participating during the study, the pregnancy will be deemed an Adverse Event 
and the subject will stop all protocol related procedures. The investigator will 
follow-up with the subject until the pregnancy reaches term or until the pregnancy has been resolved. 
 
The Investigator will report the Adverse Event of pregnancy to the IRB within 24 
hours of awareness of the event and follow-up reports will be filed with the IRB 
as information with changes of t he pregnancy becomes available. 
 
13.3 Anticipated Reactions 
All test materials have the potential to cause some minor side-effects or other 
reactions. Possible reactions to the test  material(s) may include (but are not 
limited to) subjective sensations (such as itching, burning, stinging, tingling), scaling/dryness, and redness. Additionally, test materi al(s) applied to the eye 
areas have the potential to cause eye wa tering/tearing, redness of the eyes, 
corneal erosions, and foreign body sensation in the eyes.   Symptoms of mild to moderate irritation, including the examples discussed above, will not be treated as adverse reactions if they ar e mild in nature. These 
conditions may or may not resolve over ti me. Symptoms that are persistent and 
moderate to severe in natur e, or that involve elevat ion (e.g. edema, papules, 
vesicles, spreading) wil l be considered AEs.  
In rare cases, it is possible for a subject to develop allergic reactions to the test 
material(s). This risk is increased for i ndividuals with a history of allergies, and 
individuals with asthma and/or  a history of hives may al so be affected. Subjects 
will be instructed to notify the clinic imm ediately if they experience an allergic 
reaction including rash, hives, and itching.  The Investigator or designee will have the final authorization to determine if a reaction will be c onsidered an AE.  
 
13.4 Unknown/Unforeseeable Risks 
In addition to the risks listed above, t here may be some unknown or infrequent 
and unforeseeable risks associated with the use of the assigned study products. 
Subjects will be informed both verbally and in writing in a timely manner of any 
new information, findings or changes to the way the research will be performed that might influence their willingness to cont inue their participation in this study. 
 Pregnancy/Fetal Risks:  The effects of SkinMedica Facial Cleanser, Rejuvenative Moisturizer, Essential Defense Mineral Shield Broad Spectrum SPF 35, Test 
Product A (Lytera 2.0) and Test Produc t B (4% Hydroquinone) have not been 
studied in pregnancy and theref ore may be hazardous.

Protocol Number  
SKM16-LYT-MEL 
Protocol Title Randomized, Double-blinded, Split -face Study comparing the 
Cosmetic Efficacy and Tolerability of Two Topical Products in 
Subjects with Moderate Facial Melasma  
Study Duration 3 months (12 Weeks) 
Study Population 20 healthy subjects with Fitzpatrick Skin Types III-VI 
Objectives To evaluate and compare the ef ficacy and tolerability of two 
topical products in the impr ovement of facial melasma  
Study Design Single site, investigator-initi ated, double-blinded, parallel arm,

1.0  BACKGROUND 
 
Melasma is a common disorder of hyperpigm entation which typically presents as brown 
or grayish brown macules on the face, in cluding the forehead, malar region, upper lip 
and chin. Melasma is commonly observed in women with Fitzpatrick skin types III to V 
(1), especially Asian and Hispanic women, although all skin types can be affected.   
 Contributing causes of melasma may include ultraviolet irradi ation, oral contraceptives, 
hormone replacement therapy, pregnancy, and thyroid dysfunction (2) however the exact etiology are not yet fully understood.

  Version Date: 10Aug16 Many patients find the uneven skin t one appearance caused by melasma to be 
cosmetically unacceptable.  Finding a succe ssful treatment remains challenging and 
frustrating. Therapies include broad-spectrum sunscreens, hy droquinone, tretinoin, kojic 
acid, alpha hydroxy acids, salicy lic acid, and chemical peels.  
 
The treatment of hyperpigmentation a ssociated with skin aging and melasma is 
challenging due to the prolonge d time to respond and its high relapse rate when therapy 
is discontinued.  Patients are also required to avoid sunlight to improve therapeutic 
results. Hydroquinone is cu rrently the gold standard for the topical treatment of 
hyperpigmentation and melasma. 
 
2.0  STUDY OBJECTIVE 
 
The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of SkinMedica’s 
cosmetic topical brightener versus 4% hydroquinone in the improvement of the 
appearance of moderate facial melasma over the course of 12 weeks.

Page 14 of 31 
  Version Date: 10Aug16 At the screening/baseline visit and the end of treatment visit (week 12), the 
Invesgator will assess the subject’s facial  skin for the severity of symmetrical 
facial melasma using the following Mela sma Severity Rating Scale on the left and 
right facial sides. Subjects must present with a score of 2 for the left and the right 
facial sides to be enrolled into the study. 
   
Score Hyperpigmentation Status 
0 Cleared: color of melasma lesions 
approximately equivalent to 
surrounding normal skin or with minimal residual hyperpigmentation 
1 Mild: color slightly darker than the 
surrounding normal skin 
2 Moderate: color moderately darker 
than the surrounding normal skin 
3 Severe: color markedly darker than 
the surrounding normal skin 
 
 Overall Hyperpigmentation Scale: 
At all visits (baseline, weeks 4, 8 and 12) , the Investigator will globally assess the 
subject’s left and right facial sides fo r overall hyperpigm entation using the 
following ten point scale (0 – 9): 
None  
(Score of 0)  
Skin is normal in color with no evidence of hyperpigmentation  
Mild  
(Score of 1, 2 or 3) Several brown spots with increas ed pigmentation; they are 
small in size and slightly darker than surrounding skin 
Moderate  
(Score of 4, 5 or 6) Many brown spots with increas ed pigmentation; they are 
medium in size and much darker than surrounding skin

  Version Date: 10Aug16 At all visits, (baseline, weeks 4, 8 and 12), the Investigator will assign a grade for 
the left and right facial sides, for each of the below units, for the variable A 
(percentage of each area involved), D (dar kness of pigment) and P (pattern of 
involvement), as described in detail below.   
Calculations will be conducted by the s ponsor upon receipt of the completed 
CRFs. 
3 variables are assessed for each half- facial unit : 
- Total Area Involved ( A) 
- Darkness of pigment ( D)  
- Homogeneity ( H) 
 
Variable Definitions: 
A = A numerical value is assigned for th e corresponding percentage of the 
total area of the facial segment being assessed.   
This value represents ONLY the percent of the area invo lved, not the pattern or 
darkness of the pigment.  
0=  No involvement 
1= <10% involvement 
2= 10-29% involvement 
3= 30-49% involvement 
4= 50-69% involvement 
5= 70-89% involvement 
6= 90-100% involvement  
 
D = Darkness of the pigment compared to adjacent normal pigment.   
0= Normal skin color  
1= Slightly darker than normal color 
2 = Mild hyperpigmentation 
3= Modrate hyperpigmentation,clearl y and distinctly darker than normal 
pigment 
4 = Severe hyperpigmentation, virtually black pigment  
 
H = The homogeneity of the pigmentation will be assessed using the below 
scale:  
0= Normal skin color without evidence of hyperpigmentation 
1= Specks of involvement  
2 = Small patchy areas of in volvement < 1.5 cm diameter   
3 = Patches of involvement> 2 cm diameter   
4 = Uniform skin involvement  without any clear areas

  Version Date: 10Aug16 Calculation of the hal f-face MASI score:  
To calculate the half-face MASI score, t he sum of the severity grade for darkness 
(D) and homogeneity (H) is multiplied by t he numerical value of the areas (A) 
involved and by the percentages of the four facial areas (10-30%). 
 
Total Half-Face MASI score:  
Half Forehead 0.15(D+H)A + One Mala r Side 0.3 (D+H)A + Half Chin 
0.05(D+H)A 
 
 
Investigator’s Global Improvement Assessment- Overall 
Hyperpigmentation: 
 
The expert grader will also score an In vestigator’s Global Improvement 
Assessment for Overall Hyperpigmentation on the left and right facial sides at all 
follow-up visits (weeks 4, 8, and 12). 
0=No change or worsening 
1=Mild improvement (~25% overall improvement) 2=Moderate improvement (~50% overall improvement) 3=Marked improvement (~75%  overall improvement) 
4=Complete clearing/Dramatic improv ement (~95%+ overa ll improvement) 
 
6.2 Investigator’s Tolerability Assessment 
Tolerability of the test pr oducts will be assessed through the capture of adverse events 
reported throughout the study per iod. Any adverse event(s) ex perienced by the subject 
during the study period, whether  related to the treatment or  not, will be recorded in the 
“Case Report Form.” 
6.3 Subject MELASQOL Assessment  
Subjects will complete the MELASQOL asse ssement regarding the left and their right 
facial sides at the baseline visit and at w eek 12 only. The MELASQOL is a validated 
assessment to help measure t he emotional and psychological im pact of melasma (3).  
This questionnaire is found in .  
 
6.4 Subject Self-Assessment Questionnaires  
Subjects will complete a Sponsor-provided self-assessment questionnaire at follow-up 
visits at weeks 4, 8, and 12. The assessment consists in a personal and subjective evaluation of the facial skin quality during and after the tr eatment by the subject. In 
addition, the assessment serves to evaluate the self-perceiv ed cosmetic efficacy of the 
treatment and the product attributes. This  questionnaire is f ound in  
 6.5 Imaging Procedures 
Photographs will be taken at all visits utilizi
ng standardized conditions for all subjects.

Page 17 of 31 
  Version Date: 10Aug16 The skin must be cleansed prior to photography to remove any makeup, including 
foundation makeup, lipstick/ gloss and eye shadow. The settings for the exposure, 
lighting, flash, and focal length will be maintained constant over the course of the study.  
 Ensure that subjects jewelry is remov ed from ears/neck and hair is pushed back away 
from the face, ensuring that no stray hairs are in the facial area. Subjects will be photographed using an appropriate  clinical digital photography system 
 at highest resolution in a 
consistent position. Importantly, the phot ography should be taken to enable comparison 
of baseline photos with later photos taken at the end of the tr eatment period. For 
instance, if available, the overlay functi on must be used. As each photograph is being 
taken, it should be viewed to ensure that it is in focus and is similar to its baseline 
counterpart in all technical aspects, includi ng lighting, distance and angle. In addition, 
the face should be captured in neutral faci al expressions and neutral angles (e.g., 
avoiding hypo- or hyperex tension of the neck).  
 Photos using the  will be taken from three angles to enable the improvement to 
be clearly noticed: full frontal (0 °) and at profile from the left (45°) and from the right side 
(45°). Photos will be taken at controlled distances under standard room lighting. Cross-polarized, parallel- polarized and visible light images will be acquired along with both blue fluorescence and ultraviolet fluore scence images. During the photography, the 
subjects will be asked to keep their eyes closed. 
 
6.6 Mexameter Instrume ntation Procedures 
Two target hyperpigmented lesi ons will be selected from the left (1) and the right (2) 
malar facial areas and measured by the mexameter, and instrument that measures melanin content. Measurement s at subsequent visits must  be taken from the same 
target lesion locations as at the baseline visit within each subject. 
One target “normal” measur ement will also be taken from an unaffected skin area on 
the face representing normal skin. The val ues from the target hyperpigmented lesions 
will be compared to the normal lesion value. 
 
7.0  STATISTICS 
Statistical analyses will be c onducted by the sponsor on an in tent-to-treat basis (ex: all 
enrolled subjects, with at least one follow- up visit, will be included in the analysis).

13.0 ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING 
 
13.1 Serious And/Or Adverse Event Reporting 
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence, that, at any dose: 
 results in death; 
 is life-threatening; 
 requires in-subject hospitalization or pr olongation of existing hospitalization; 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
 is an important medical event. 
 
Throughout the study, subjec ts will be monitored for signs and symptoms of 
adverse events.  An adverse event is any pathological or unintended change in 
the structure, function or chemistry of the body that  occurs during the study, 
irrespective of causality, including any ill ness, injury, toxicity, sensitivity, or 
sudden death.  The condition must eit her not be present pre-study or must 
worsen in either intensity or frequency during the study. 
 
An unanticipated adverse study drug event is any drug-related adverse event, 
which is not identified in nature, severity , or frequency in current literature on the 
test article.  

Protocol: SKM16-LYT-MEL                           Sponsor: SkinMedica, Inc.  
 
Page 21 of 31 
  Version Date: 10Aug16 All adverse events, including serious and study drug related or unanticipated 
adverse drug events, must be recorded and assessed by th e Investigator.  In the 
event of an adverse event, serious adverse  event or unanticipated adverse drug 
event, the physician will prov ide optimal subject care. 
 
Subjects who have had a serious adverse event must be followed clinically until 
all parameters, including labor atory values, have either returned to normal or are 
otherwise explained. 
 
Any serious adverse event or unanticipat ed adverse drug event occurring in this 
study will be analyzed and identif ied by the investigator and reported to the IRB 
within 10 business days, as per IND regulations and FDA Guidance. The 
investigator will also determine the event re lated to the study drug and report that 
event to the manufacture of the device, if necessary. 
 
Serious adverse events will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours (or the 
next working day). The main Sponsor c ontact for serious adverse events is: 
 
If death was the outcome of the event  on the initial SAE Report, a Follow-
up/Final Report, including autopsy report, when performed, must be completed. 
 
13.2 Pregnancy During The Study 
If a subject of childbearing potential becomes pregnant at any time while 
participating during the study, the pregnancy will be deemed an Adverse Event 
and the subject will stop all protocol re lated procedures. The investigator will 
follow-up with the subject until the pregnancy reaches term or until the pregnancy 
has been resolved. 
 
The Investigator will report the Adverse Event of pregnancy to the IRB within 24 
hours of awareness of the event and follow-up reports will be filed with the IRB 
as information with changes of t he pregnancy becomes available. 
 
13.3 Anticipated Reactions 
All test materials have the potential to cause some minor side-effects or other 
reactions. Possible reactions to the test  material(s) may include (but are not 
limited to) subjective sensations (such as itching, burning, stinging, tingling), 

Protocol: SKM16-LYT-MEL                           Sponsor: SkinMedica, Inc.  
 
Page 22 of 31 
  Version Date: 10Aug16 scaling/dryness, and redness. Additionally, test materi al(s) applied to the eye 
areas have the potential to cause eye wa tering/tearing, redness of the eyes, 
corneal erosions, and foreign body sensation in the eyes.  
 Symptoms of mild to moderate irritation, including the examples discussed above, will not be treated as adverse reactions if they are mild in nature. These 
conditions may or may not resolve over ti me. Symptoms that are persistent and 
moderate to severe in natur e, or that involve elevat ion (e.g. edema, papules, 
vesicles, spreading) wil l be considered AEs.  
In rare cases, it is possible for a subject to develop allergic reactions to the test 
material(s). This risk is increased for individuals with a histor y of allergies, and 
individuals with asthma and/or  a history of hives may al so be affected. Subjects 
will be instructed to notify the clinic imm ediately if they experience an allergic 
reaction including rash, hives, and itching.  The Investigator or designee will have the final authorization to determine if a reaction will be c onsidered an AE.  
 
13.4 Unknown/Unforeseeable Risks 
In addition to the risks listed above, t here may be some unknown or infrequent 
and unforeseeable risks associated with the use of the assigned study products. 
Subjects will be informed both verbally and in writing in  a timely manner of any 
new information, findings or changes to the way the research will be performed that might influence their willingness to cont inue their participation in this study. 
 Pregnancy/Fetal Risks:  The effects of SkinMedica Facial Cleanser, Rejuvenative Moisturizer, Essential Defense Mineral Shield Broad Spectrum SPF 35, Test 
Product A (Lytera 2.0) and Test Produc t B (4% Hydroquinone) have not been 
studied in pregnancy and theref ore may be hazardous.   
 If a subject thinks that she may be pr egnant or have become pregnant during the 
study she is to inform the study doctor immediately. If a subject becomes pregnant or thinks they may be pregnant, t hey will be removed from the study 
and the study doctor will refer the subject to seek obstetric care and may request 
to track their pregnancy and will report  to the IRB. 
 
13.5 Unblinding 
In the event that a subject experiences  an Adverse Event or Serious Adverse 
Event, the Investigator and/or S ub-Investigator will become unblinded.

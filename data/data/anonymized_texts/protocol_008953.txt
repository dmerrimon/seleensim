EX-MKTG -109 MANGO Protocol v1. 3 05june2020 9 2 INTRODUCTION  
Multifocal contact lenses provide correction for vision at near as well as in the distance. This 
segment of the contact lens market has been slowly growing as more products become available.  
CooperVision is interested in comparing  the performance of  their newly developed daily 
disposable (DD) MyDay Multifocal ( Lens A ) contact lens to patients’ habitual multifocal lenses 
and to the competitor product DAILIES TOTAL1® Multifocal  (Lens B ). Of particular interest is the 
comparison of handling the lenses, which includes insertion and removal to and from  the eye. 
Ease of lens handling is critical in a presbyopic population who require specific prescription for 
seeing well up close.  
3 OBJECTIVES  
The objective of the study is  to compare the lens handling  and performance of Lens A  to 
habitually worn m ultifocal contact lenses  and to the competitor Lens  B. 
The primary outcome variable for this study is: 
• Subjective at -home ratings of  ‘Lens handling for insertion’ , using a 0-10 scale, 
collected on Day 13.   
4 HYPOTHESIS  
The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference between the at-home subjective ratings of 
‘Lens handling for insertion’, collected on Day 13 for Lens A  compared to Lens B.  
5 MATERIALS AND METHOD S 
5.1 STUDY DESIGN  
5.1.1 OVERALL DESIGN 
This is a prospective, randomized, participant -masked, crossover , bilateral dispensing study  
conducted at up to 5 clinical practice sites in the United States, listed on page 3. Each lens type 
will be worn for up to 3 weeks . The lens prescription of each lens type will be optimized after 3- 7 
days wearing experience, prior to starting  a 2-week  wear period.  
5.1.2 RANDOMIZATION  
Participants will be wearing their habitual lenses during the first  2-week  phase, followed by a 
randomized order of Lens A and Lens B lens wear.  
EX-MKTG -109 MANGO Protocol v1. 3 05june2020 10 A randomization schedule will be generated for each site using a web- based program  to 
determine the order of Lens A and Lens B lens wear : (www.randomization.com ). The final study 
randomization schedule will be generated by CORE ’s Database Administrator  and provided to 
the research assistants at each site .  
5.1.3 MASKING  
Participant s will wear their habitual lens with an optimized prescription during the first Phase, 
followed by a masked lens wear using Lens A  and Lens B. Lens packages/f oils will be over -
labeled with strongly adhesive stickers to mask t he participant to the lens brand. 
It is not possible for the study investigators to be masked because of the need to follow the 
specific lens fitting guide during the lens prescript ion optimization visit (Visits 0, 2-1, 3-1).  
5.2 INVESTIGATIONAL  SITES 
5.2.1 NUMBER OF SITES 
This study will be conducted at 5 optometry practice sites, listed on page 3 of this document .   
 
5.2.2 INVESTIGATOR RECRUIT MENT  
The principal investigator at each site will be required to fulfil the following criteria:  
• Is a l icensed Optometrist with at least two years of contact lens fitting experience.  
• Can demonstrate training in Good Clinical Practice (GCP) by the already trained 
principal investigator.  
• Accepts responsibility for the conduct of the study at their site. 
• Has in- office email and either  document scanning capabilities or fax.  
• Will scan and send all study visit documents to CORE, ideally the same day* as the 
visit or at most within 2 days of the study visit.  
• Is willing  to follow the study protocol and to co- operate with the study monitors  at 
CORE . 
* Study documents are required as soon as possible because this allows for prompt lens 
ordering and timely data review, query and entry.  
EX-MKTG -109 MANGO Protocol v1. 3 05june2020 11 5.3 STUDY POPULATION 
5.3.1 SAMPLE SIZE CALCULAT ION 
The sample size was calculated using lens handling  data from a previ ous study  comparing Lens 
A against lens B (CooperVision, data on file).  In that study a 0- 100 scale was used, not the 0- 10 
used in this study. As a way of compensating for fewer  step sizes in the 0- 10 scale, a target 
difference of 5 units on the 0- 100 scal e was chosen as  a meaningful clinical differences in 0- 100 
subjective responses.  
Using the 0 -100 scale data described above for ‘lens handling for insertion’, where the data 
showed a standard deviation of 12 .7 and when applying requirements of  80% power and alpha 
0.05 in a two- tailed t -test, a minimum sample size of 53 participants is recommended in order to 
detect a mean difference of 5 units . 
To account for dropout, up to 60  participants may  be randomized and dispensed  with study 
product in total, with the target of at least 53 completing the study.  
Note: this study will use a subjective rating scale of 0 -10, integer steps.  
 
Figure 1: Sample size calculation graph  
 
5.3.2 NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS  
Participants will be recruited using site records, databases and advertising materials (eg. 
posters, email scripts) approved by the ethics  review board. All initial individual -targeted 
recruitment activities, such as any direct mailing of recruitment scripts, will be conducted by 
pract ice staff that are not directly involved in conducting the research. This separation will 
reduce any undue influence of the optometrist -patient relationship. This process will also 

EX-MKTG -109 MANGO Protocol v1. 3 05june2020 12 eliminate opportunity for the investigator to access personal health information before any 
consent for disclosure is provided by the potential participant.  
It is anticipated that up to 80 potential participants may attend a Screening visit and up to 60 participants may be randomized and dispensed with study products, with a target of 53 completing the study.  
 
5.3.3 INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
A person is eligible for inclusion in the study if he/she:  
1. Is at least 42 years of age and has full legal capacity to volunteer ; 
2. Has read and signed an information consent letter ; 
3. Self reports having a full eye examination in the previous two years;  
4. Anticipates being able to wear the study lenses for at least 8 hours a day, 5 days a week; 
5. Is willing and able to follow instructions and maintain the appointment schedule; 
6. Habitual ly wears  multifocal soft contact lens es, for the past 3 months minimum;  
7. Has refractive astigmatism no higher than -0.75D C; 
8. Is presbyopic and requires a reading addition of at least +0.75D  and no more than 
+2.50D; 
9. Can be fit and achieve binocular distance vision  of at least 20/30 Snellen (or +0.20 
logMAR) which participants also deem to be ‘acceptable’, with the available study lens 
parameters  (sphere + 4 to -6; near addition or LO W, MED IUM, HIGH). 
A person will be excluded from the study if he/she:  
1. Is participating in any concurrent clinical or research study ; 
2. Habitually wears one of the study contact lenses; 
3. Has any known active* ocular disease and/or infection that contraindicates contact lens 
wear ; 
4. Has a  systemic condition  that in the opinion of the investigator may affect  a study 
outcome variable;  
5. Is using any systemic or topical medications that in the opinion of the investigator may 
affect contact lens wear or a study outcome variable; 
6. Has known sensitivity to the diagnostic sodium fluorescein used in the study;  
7. Self-reports  as pregnant, lactating or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrolment; 
8. Has undergone refractive error surgery  or intraocular surgery . 
EX-MKTG -109 MANGO Protocol v1. 3 05june2020 13 * For the purposes of this study, active ocular disease is defined as  infection  or inflammation which 
requires therapeutic treatment. Mild (i.e. not considered clinically relevant) lid abnormalities  (blepharit is, 
meibomian gland dysfunction, papillae), corneal and conjunctival staining and dry eye are not considered 
active ocular disease.  Neovascularization and corneal scars  are the result of previous hypoxia, infection or 
inflammation and are therefore not active.  
 
Age ≥42 years is an inclusion criteria because presbyopia is unlikely in persons aged < 42 years 
and, if presen t, may not be due solely to presbyopic changes representative of the wider 
population.   
Pregnant and lactating women are not being excluded from the study due to safety  concerns but 
due to fluctuations in refractive error, accommodation and/ or visual acuity that  occur secondary 
to systemic hormonal changes. It has further been shown that pregnancy could impact tear 
production, which could impact dry eye symptoms. Such fluctuations could affect data, thereby 
negatively affecting study data integrity.  
5.4 STUDY MATERIALS  
Habitual lenses:  The optimized prescription of the habitual lenses will be determined by the 
investigator and the clinical site will order a new lens supply to the participant (6- pack for 
frequent replacement MF lenses, 30- pack for daily disposable MF lenses. If the partic ipant 
wears the same prescription in both eyes, only one box will be ordered). If applicable, t he clinic 
site will also supply the participant with a new bottle of their habitual care regimen including a 
new lens case.   
Lens A  and Lens B: CooperVision will  provide each site with a small trial kit of Lens A  lenses. 
Sites will source their own trial kit of Lens B. The sites will use these trial kits  to fit Lens B and 
Lens A  lenses  to determine the optimal lens power. Once the final lens has been determined, 
the site will order a pack of 30 lenses for each eye with each lens type. Lens B will be ordered 
through the site’s normal commercial route. CORE will coordinate the Lens A  lens orders for 
each participant upon receipt of the lens order form, which is part of the study visit pack. If the 
optimization visit determines a different prescription is needed, a new lens supply  will be ordered 
as described previously . 
Reimbursement to practice sites for study product expenses will be provided by CooperVision at the end of the study, after CORE has reconciled the invoices and the product accountability and 
dispensing logs.  
EX-MKTG -109 MANGO Protocol v1. 3 05june2020 15 5.4.4 DISPOSING OF STUDY PRODUCTS  
At the end of the study, all sites will return all unused products  to CORE , unless  otherwise 
directed. Worn lenses will be disposed of by participants and at the sites according to local 
regulations.  
5.4.5 PRODUCT ACCOUNTABILI TY 
Accountability logs must  be kept by each site to include the number of contact lenses received 
and returned to CORE  (where relevant). All products dispensed to participants must be recorded 
in participant dispensing logs. 
5.5 SCHEDULED AND UNSCHEDULED VISITS  
This study has a minimum of 12 scheduled study visits, including the screening visit , though 
some visits may be scheduled concurrently on the same day . There is an option for repeated 
screening and lens fitting visits as needed.  
A scheduled follow -up visit may only take place when the participant  attends  wearing  the 
study lenses for at least two hours. If  this is not the case and the participant  is not experiencing 
any problems  with the lenses, the appointment will be rescheduled, ideally within the visit window.   
Visits that fall outside of the specified visit windows will be designated as protocol deviations and 
at the end of the study, the data collected during protocol deviations will be assessed for their suitability to be included in the analysis population.  
Table 3 summarizes the scheduled study visits and study codes.  
EX-MKTG -109 MANGO Protocol v1. 3 05june2020 17 Participants will  be assigned a unique alpha -numeric study ID after they sign the consent 
documentation i.e. before their eligibility for the s tudy has been confirmed.  Each site will use a 
different letter preceding the participant ID  number.  For example, participant 01 at  site W will be 
W-01, and participant 01 at site Z will be Z-01. Ineligible participants will be discontinued from 
the study.  
The investigator will determine participant eligibility using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
The study procedures are outlined below:  
1. The participant is expected to insert their habitual multifocal contact lenses  at least 2 
hours before attending the visit  and if available bring an additional (new) pair of lenses.  
(If participant habitually wears daily disposable MF lenses, ask if a 2 -week supply is 
available. All habitual lenses used during the study will be repl aced at no charge to the 
participant .) 
2. The participant will be required to read and sign an Informed Consent Form  prior to 
enrollment. When the participant has signed the consent form, the participant will be 
considered enrolled in the study  and will  be assigned a study ID . 
3. Participant demographics and medical history (age, sex, race, ethnicity, medical 
conditions, medications, allergies). 
4. Contact lens history (habitual lens information and wearing habits).

EX-MKTG -109 MANGO Protocol v1. 3 05june2020 29 opportunity to try a different type of soft contact lenses and/or different lens care products at no 
cost to them. The contact lens materials used in this study are commercially available as daily wear. This study will investigate participants’ wearing schedule intended for daily wear (NOT extended wear) , similar to the average wearing time of 10 -16 hours for daily wear lenses.  
This study is considered to be a non- significant risk study based on United State Food and Drug 
administration (FDA) and International Standards Organization (ISO) guidelines , because the 
study devices used as intended in this study (1) do  not represent a potential for serious risk to the 
health, safety or welfare of the  subject, and (2) are not implants, (3) are not used to support or 
sustain human life, (4) are not of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise prevents impairment of human health.   
The habitual lens and the two study contact lens  types will be worn as per their approved use; 
on a daily wear, daily disposable basis. When contact lenses are worn on a daily wear basis 
there is a small risk of an adverse event compared to not wearing contact lenses. When contact 
lenses are worn on an extended wear basis, there is a significantly increased risk of an adverse reaction compared with wearing contact lenses on a daily wear basis.  
Adverse events and/ or complications in daily wear of  soft contact lenses can occur  (eg: 
inflammation and infection).  Complications that may occur during the wearing of contact lenses 
include discomfort, dryness, aching or itching eyes, excessive tearing, discharge, hyperemia and variable or blurred vision.  More serious risks may include pain,  photophobia, iritis, corneal 
edema or eye infection. Although contact lens -related infections are very infrequent, the 
possibility does exist.  The incidence of infection due to day -wear soft lenses is 0.035%. Almost 
always an infection will occur only in one eye.  This risk is assumed by 35- million Americans who 
currently wear contact lenses and only current soft lens wearers will be recruited for this study.  
A dye (fluorescein) normally used for eye examinations is being used in this study. Although 
rare, it is possible to have an allergic reaction to the dye. Participants will be asked if they  have a 
known allergy or sensitivity to fluorescein.  
The assessments conducted in this study are r outine clinical procedures  and they includ e auto-
refraction, auto- keratometry, visual acuity, anterior ocular health assessment, and contact lens 
fitting will be used. In addition, high magnification imaging of the lens fit may be made  using 35 
mm or digital cameras . Patients will be monitored freq uently  until the end of the study to reduce 
the occurrence of adverse or potential adverse events. Patients will be given instructions from 
their investigator regarding early symptoms and signs of adverse events.  
EX-MKTG -109 MANGO Protocol v1. 3 05june2020 32 8.1 NORMAL OR ADAPTIVE SYMPTOMS  
Transient symptoms such as end- of-day dryness, lens awareness, itching or burning or other 
discomfort may occur with contact lens wear and may occasionally reduce wearing time. These 
are not reported as adverse events unless in the investigator’s opinion they are unexpected in nature, severe or have a high rate of occurrence.  
8.2 PROCEDURES FOR ADVERSE EVENTS  
Treatment of an adverse event will depend on its nature and severity. Based on the clinical judgment of the investigator the participant may be managed at the practice, or referred to another 
eye care practitioner for treatment. The investigator will attempt to determine whether the reaction is related to the test device or a result of other factors. An adverse event form will be completed for each adverse event. If both eyes are involved, a separate adverse event form will be completed 
for each eye . Whenever possible, the adverse event will be photo- documented.  
Expenses incurred for medical treatment as part of study participation will be paid by the sponsor (bills and prescription receipts kept). The participant must be followed until resolution or no further change is anticipated and/or referred for further care with the appropriate health care professional 
and/or recorded as being under appropriate health care as per investigator’s discretion. A written 
report will be completed indicating the subsequent treatment and resolution of the condition.  
8.3 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
All potential Serious and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects that are related or possibly related 
to participant’s participation will be reported to CORE’s lead study coordinator  (details below) and 
also to the sponsor (details below) within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event. The site’s Principal Investigator will also report the event to Sterling  IRB within 10 days of 
becoming aware of the Serious or Unanticipated event, using the Reportable Events Form. All 
fatal or life threatening events will be reported immediately to the IRB.  
Significant and Non -Significant Adverse Events will be reported to CORE’s lead study coordinator  
and the sponsor as soon as possible, but no later than 5 working days after the occurrence.  Each 
site’s Prin cipal Investigator will report the event to the IRB as per IRB  requirements  (by fax, 
mail/delivery, phone, or email).  
 CORE contact details for adverse events are:

Sponsor contact details for adverse events are:  
   
   
   
    
 
Details of all adverse events will be included in the study report.  
9 DISCONTINUATION FROM  THE STUDY  
Participants may be discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor in consideration of participant safety or protocol compliance, or at discretion of the participant.  Participants 
discontinued from a study will be reimbursed US$20 per hour for their active involvement in the 
study (including the initial screening visit  and all lens fitting visits ).  Upon discontinuing, a 
participant will be offered the option of their data being withdrawn from future statistical analysis. 
The following is a list of possible reasons for discontinuation from the study:  
• Screening failure: Participants will be discontinued if  they do not meet the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria outlined in section 5.2.3. 
• Unacceptable performance with products to be used in study: Participants may be 
discontinued if they are unable to achieve acceptable comfort and /or vision with the 
study products.  
• Positive slit lamp finding:  Participants may be permanently discontinued from the study depending on the severity of the condition and on the judgement of the investigator.   
• Adverse event: If a participant experiences an adverse event during the study they may 
be discontinued based on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  
• Symptoms : If the participant has persistent symptoms they may be discontinued based 
on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  

EX-MKTG -109 MANGO Protocol v1. 3 05june2020 34 • Disinterest, relocation or illness: The participant may choose to discontinue due to 
reasons within or beyond their control. 
• Violation of protocol or non- compliance:  The participant will be discontinued if they are 
unable or unwilling to follow the protocol specified visit schedules  and/or study 
procedures . 
• Instillation of topical ocular medication:  The participant will be discontinued if they elect to use a topical ocular medication during the study  unless  that topical ocular medication 
is prescribed for a limited duration (less than two weeks)  to treat a transient condition; in 
this case  the participant may remain an active participant (at the discretion of the 
investigator) after stopping topical ocular medication following resolution of the ocular 
condition).  
• Lost to follow -up:  The participant will be discontinued if they cannot be contacted and do  
not return for a final exit visit, and if the investigator has made a reasonable effort to contact the participant for a final study visit.  
• Premature termination of the study by the sponsor, CORE  or Sterling IRB . 
A discontinuation form, stating the reason for discontinuation will be completed, which requires 
the signatures of both the participant and the investigator  except where the participant is lost to 
follow -up in which case only the signature of the investigator is required .   
When a participant choses to discontinue from the study they will be given the opportunity to withdraw their data from the statistical analysis. This choice will be captured on the discontinuation form.  
All discontinuations including their reasons will be included in the final report.  
10 DEVICE MALFUNCTIONS  
A device malfunction means the failure of the device to meet its performance specification or otherwise perform as intended. Any defective lens that is  likely to cause or contribute to a  Serious 
Adverse Event should be reported to CORE  and the spons or within 24 hours  of the investigator 
becoming aware of the malfunction. The ORE would also be notified within 24 hours of any device malfunction that may contribute to a Serious Adverse Event . 
Other defective lenses should be reported to CORE as soon as possible (usually in weekly study 
updates).  
EX-MKTG -109 MANGO Protocol v1. 3 05june2020 35 This clinical study will also ascertain satisfaction or preference with subjective attributes such as 
comfort, vision, or lens handling. Responses to these subjective questionnaires will not be considered as complaints or device malfunctions. 
11 STUDY COMPLETION AND  REMUNERATION 
At the last scheduled protocol visit a study completion form  will be completed, which requires the 
signatures of both the participant and the investigator.  Participants will also be provided with a 
letter of appreciation.    
Once their involvement in the study is complete, participants will be informed about receiving 
feedback following study completion in the Let ter of Appreciation. 
Participant remuneration will be  approximately  US$165 for completing the study.  This is 
calculated at $20 per hour for the 1 hour of at home ratings questionnaires and 7.25 hours of  
predicted scheduled visits , though if additional fitting time is required, this may increase. 
12 S TATISTICAL ANALYSIS  AND DATA MAN AGEMENT  
12.1 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
All data will be analyzed by CORE  at the University of Waterloo.  Unmasked data analysis will 
be conducted using Statistica 10, Statsoft or other suitable software.  Descriptive statistics will 
be provided on demographic data (age, gender, refractive error distribution, etc.).  Table 7  lists 
the primary and other outcome variables and anticipated statistical procedures.  
 
Comparisons will be made between the study lenses for the variables measured at the 2-week  
visits. Additionally the subjective ratings completed on day  13 of each phase will be 
compared. A binomial test will be used to analyze the results for the count data  
 Where relevant, the number of “neither agree or 
disagree” responses will be evenly distributed to the two options on the basis they would be 
equally likely to choose either.  
 
 
 
Where appropri ate, data may be presented as both mean and as counts by ‘bucket’ groups.  

EX-MKTG -109 MANGO Protocol v1. 3 05june2020 37 12.3 COMMENTS ON SOURCE DOCUMENTS  
Data analysis will not be conducted on comments which have been recorded in the source 
documents. Only relevant and applicable comments will be included in the final report as deemed necessary by CORE’s L ead Co-ordinator .  
13 PROTOCOL & OTHER TRAINING  
All stu dy personnel will be required to complete training prior to their involvement in the study. 
Records of training will be kept at CORE . This will include training by CORE on the study 
protocol , study procedures, informed consent procedures, and on the random ization and 
participant masking procedures , as well as training for Good Clinical Practice.   
All site Principal Investigators and co-investigators will provide a scan of their curriculum vitae, 
license to practice optometry and evidence of professional indemnity insurance. They will also 
complete CORE’s Conflict Disclosure Form.  
14 STUDY MONITORING 
Each site will provide regular  status reports to CORE . Status r eports will include:  
• The number of participants screened, enrolled, and randomized (i.e. assigned a study ID 
number), discontinued and completed.  
• Details of all protocol deviations, adverse events, device malfunctions . 
• Reports of unintended events.  
CORE will collate the site updates and provide 2- weekly status reports to the study sponsor.  
Study monitori ng visits to the sites may be conducted by CORE, the sponsor, or sponsor’s 
designate,  throughout the study and will be scheduled in conjunction with the Princip al 
Investigator at each site. In addition study records may be inspected by the sponsor, the 
sponsor's designate, Sterling Institutional Review Board, and by regulatory authorities in Canada 
and the United States, namely Health Canada and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA); however, they will not be permitted to take away any records containing identifiable personal information.  
Study data review and data monitoring will be conducted by CORE personnel. To improve data 
integrity, data entry will be conducted by two people and the entries will be compared. Data 
queries will be re ported to the site within 5 working days of receipt of initial data. A response 
resolving the query will be expected from the site within 5 working days of receipt of the query.  
EX-MKTG -109 MANGO Protocol v1. 3 05june2020 38 All adverse events and protocol deviations will be reviewed by the site Principal  Investigator  and 
CORE’s Lead Co- ordinator . All serious adverse events and major protocol deviations will be 
reviewed by the site Princip al Investigator  and CORE’s  Director and/or Head of Clinical 
Research.

EX-MKTG -109 MANGO Protocol v1. 3 05june2020 39 15.4 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
Protocol deviations are unanticipated or unintentional changes to a study after it has received 
prior sponsor approval and ethics c learance . Protocol deviations can be major or minor.  
15.4.1  MAJOR PROTOCOL DEVIA TIONS  
Major protocol deviations may impact the research protocol, information consent document or other study materials, usually cannot be anticipated ahead of time and are often necessary to ensure the safety and welfare of the participants.  
The following are examples of protocol deviations that must be reported to the ORE : 
• Changes in procedures initiated to eliminate immediate risks/hazards to participants;  
• Enrollment of participants outside the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria whether agreed to or not by the sponsor;  
• Medication / device / intervention errors (i.e. incorrect drug or dosage of drug / incorrect contact lens(es) dispensed / incorrect care system dispensed); 
• Inadvertent deviation in specific research intervention procedures or timing of the 
research intervention which could impact upon the safety or efficacy of the study -related 
intervention or upon the experimental design;  
• Information consent documentation violations: no documentation of informed consent; 
incorrect version of, or incomplete, informed consent documentation used.  
15.4.2  MINOR PROTOCOL DEVIA TIONS  
Protocol deviations caused by or which originate with research participants are considered minor, and normal ly are not reported to the ORE unless these result in increased risk to the 
participant (s). The following are examples of protocol deviations that are considered minor and 
do not require reporting to the ORE:  
• Logistical or administrative aspects of the study (e.g., study participant missed 
appointment, change in appointment date) ; 
• Inadvertent deviation in specific research intervention procedures or timing of the 
research intervention which would not impact upon the safety or efficacy of the study -
related intervention or upon the experimental design (i.e., missing a measurement during a session that is not considered critical for the study).  
EX-MKTG -109 MANGO Protocol v1. 3 05june2020 40 15.4.3  REPORTING AND DOCUMENTING PROTCOL DEVIAT IONS  
Major protocol deviations must be reported to the Sterling Institutional  Review Board within 10 
days  of the deviation occurring (or its discovery)  using the Reportable Events Form . To facilitate 
timely reporting to the sponsor, all sites must notify CORE of a major protocol deviation as soon 
as possible.  
All protocol deviations (major and minor) occurring during the study will be documented and 
included in the final report . 
15.5 PREMATURE TERMINATIO N OF THE STUDY  
The sponsor, CORE  or Sterling Institutional Review Board may terminate the study at any time 
for any reason.  
15.6 STUDY PARTICIPANT RECORDS

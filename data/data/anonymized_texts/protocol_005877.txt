Exercise Training and Cognitive Function in Kidney Disease [9] 
Page 5 of 30 10-1-2018  1.0 Project Summary/Abstract   
Chronic kidney disease (CKD), affects over 45% of all individuals over 70 years of age. 
Patients with moderate CKD have more than a two- fold increased risk of cognitive 
impairment than those without CKD; furthermore, as many as 20- 70% of patients with 
CKD have established cognitive impairment and overt dementia. The burden of 
cognitive impairment and dementia leads to functional decline and accelerated loss of 
independence, contributing to the tremendous individual, societal, and economic burden 
of CKD (i.e., 20% of Medicare expenditures in adults > 65 years of age). There is no 
recommended treatment to prevent cognitive decline in CKD patients, and the few 
medications available for cognitive impairment have only short term modest effects. 
There is a critical need to evaluate therapies to forestall cognitive impairment, and maintain or improve cognitive functioning in older patients with CKD. To address this need, we will test the hypothesis that older patients with moderate/severe CKD and pre-
clinical cognitive impairment randomized to a 6- month home- based exercise program 
will improve cognitive function and MRI measured brain structure, compared to a usual 
care control group. We are focusing on patients with pre- clinical cognitive impairment in 
order to capture a therapeutic window in the disease proc ess, which will allow us to 
possibly prevent dementia before brain atrophy becomes irreversible. This is a pilot study for feasibility . Our central hypothesis is that the accelerated cognitive decline in 
CKD results from a vascular dysfunction- induced reduction in the integrity of the brain 
white matter and that exercise training provides a cerebro- protective effect by improving 
cerebral vascular health. We will combine an assessment of cognition with MR imaging techniques to fully evaluate brain structure,  blood flow, and behavior relationships at a 
level previously not conducted in this population. This study is designed to improve or 
forestall cognitive decline in CKD patients by establishing an intervention that is 
implemented individually in the communi ty, and will provide the first step in providing an 
effective treatment designed to delay physical and cognitive function -related loss of 
independence, and curb the escalating costs in the growing CKD population. This is a population with accelerated brain aging and a high prevalence of cognitive impairment, 
making the potential clinical impact tremendous.  
 
Anticipated risks associate with the study : We will monitor heart rate and blood pressure 
during all testing. There is a very small risk associated with the 6 minute walk exercise 
test and training.  The risk of serious adverse events (such as death or heart attack) 
with maximal exercise testing has been estimated to be 0.5 per 10,000 tests (Stuart, 
1980 Chest), the risk of death associated with a 6- minut e walk is currently not known, 
but is considered minimal risk.  The exercise test (6 minute walk) and training proposed 
in this study is considered no more than usual activity of daily living and is considered 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
Exercise Training and Cognitive Function in Kidney Disease [9] 
Page 6 of 30 10-1-2018  moderate intensity exercise.  There is a slight risk of abnormally high blood pressure, 
shortness of breath, muscle injury, and muscle soreness associated with exercise training in a sedentary (not used to exercise) population. There is a slight risk for pain and bruising with the venipuncture.   Ther e is a slight risk for loss of confidentiality 
(being identified) and there may be some discomfort felt by participants when answering questions about their medical history and during cognitive testing: The risks associated 
with the procedures of this study are minimal – no greater than those encountered 
during daily life. MRI scans: The MRI does not use x -ray radiation or radioactive 
material. The magnetism of the machine attracts certain metals, which could put 
participants at risk. Therefore, people with pacemakers, infusion pumps, metal 
prostheses, metallic -backed transdermal patches or metallic shrapnel will be excluded 
from the study.  A checklist will be completed that addresses issues of MRI safety. Some people may feel somewhat closed- in (claustrophobic) during the MRI procedure. 
The MRI scans can get quite noisy and this may cause some discomfort. We will provide padding, a blanket, and ear plugs to ensure comfort.  During the vascular 
testing; the blood pressure cuff could feel too tight and it may cause discomfort and 
there might be pressure on the neck from the ultrasound Doppler transducer, which 
could feel uncomfortable.  Participants’ can withdraw at any time and we will closely 
monitor them to ensure safety and comfort.  
Anticipated Benefits : This is a pilot study for feasibility  and no benefits  should be 
expected. Walking exercise training has been associated with significant improvement 
in fitness (aerobic capacity), blood pressure, and ability to perform activities (physical function). The effect of exercise training on cognition is promising, but currently 
unknown.  
Subject population: We anticipate randomizing 72 men and women with and without 
CKD between 60 and 80 years of age with no contraindications to moderate- intensity 
exercise that answ ered “yes” to the question “Do you feel like your memory or thinking 
skills have gotten worse recently?”.  (please see detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
section 4), In order to achieve this we anticipate sending 200 0 letters to potential 
participants at UIC.

Exercise Training and Cognitive Function in Kidney Disease [9] 
Page 7 of 30 10-1-2018  2.0 Background/Scientific Rationale  
Patients with CKD have more than a two- fold increased risk of cognitive impairment 
than those without CKD.1- 3 As many as 20- 50% of patients with moderate CKD have 
established cognitive impairment or overt demen tia.1-7 Cognitive impairment leads to 
decreased medical care compliance, functional decline and loss of independence.8 
There are no recommended treatments to prevent cognitive decline in CKD patients. 
There is therefore a need for therapies aimed to improv e cognitive outcomes in older 
patients with CKD. The accelerated cognitive decline in older CKD patients is due, in part, to the CKD disease process itself, which creates a toxic vascular milieu that consists of chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, urem ia, and systemic vascular 
endothelial dysfunction. This toxic internal vascular milieu leads to vascular dysfunction related impairment of the white matter that is superimposed on neurodegenerative damage.9 The white matter is important for coordinating interactions between different regions of the brain and is essential for normal functioning of the brain.10- 14 Impaired 
white matter integrity appears to be a primary contributor to cognitive decline in CKD and is strongly affected by the internal vascular m ilieu.10,11 We have previously 
demonstrated that exercise training improves the vascular milieu in patients with CKD by reducing systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, and improving vascular function.15,16 Regular exercise and higher fitness levels in non-CKD patients with and 
without cognitive impairment has been associated with improved cognitive function, white matter integrity, and hippocampal volume suggesting a possible cerebro-protective effect of exercise.17- 28 This is conjectured to be due to an improvement in 
vascular function related increases in cerebral blood flow.18 The effect of exercise training on cognitive function and white matter integrity in CKD patients is unknown.  
 
3.0 Objectives/Aims 
This is a pilot study for feasibility . The obj ective of this study is to test the hypothesis 
that older participants with moderate/severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 
preclinical cognitive impairment randomized to a 6- month home -based exercise 
program (n=12), will improve cognitive functioning and white matter integrity (WMI) , 
compared to participants in a usual care control group (n=12). Our central working 
hypothesis  is that the accelerated cognitive decline that occurs in CKD results, in part, 
from a vascular -dysfunction induced impairment of white matter integrity that is 
superimposed on a neurodegenerative process, and that exercise training may provide 
a cerebro- protective effect by improving systemic and cerebral vascular health.  
 Aim 1 : Determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a 6- month home- based 
exercise program to improve or maintain cognitive function in older participants with moderate/severe CKD and preclinical cognitive impairment, compared to usual care 
control group.  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
Exercise Training and Cognitive Function in Kidney Disease [9] 
Page 8 of 30 10-1-2018  Hypotheses : Participants in the exercise group compared to the usual care control 
group at 6- months will:   
H1a. Demonstrate a higher score on composite global cognitive functioning.    
H1b. Demonstrate higher scores on executive functioning, learning/memory, and 
attention/information processing.  
Aim 2 . Det ermine the cerebro- protective effect of a 6- month exercise program 
compared to usual care on white matter integrity as quantified by Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) -derived MRI measures of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional 
anisotrophy (FA). Intact white matter is important because it allows the brain to function 
properly and these are indices of white matter integrity.  
H2a. Participants in the exercise group will demonstrate an improvement in 
overall white matter integrity as measured by DTI, i.e., lower  MD and higher FA, 
compared to control.   
H2b. Change in cognitive function will be positively correlated with change in WMI.  
Aim 3  (secondary MRI outcomes): Determine the cerebro- protective effect of a 6 -month 
exercise program compared to control on hippocampal volume and cerebral blood flow.  
Hypothesis:   Participants in the exercise group will have a larger hippocampal volume 
and improved cerebral blood flow post 6- month intervention, compared to the control 
group.  
 
Study Duration: 12 months.  Study duration for enrolled participants is anticipated to be 
27 weeks.

Page 10 of 30 10-1-2018  1. Patients that have a diagnosis code or meet criteria for CKD based on ICD codes or 
creatinine levels (or estimated glomerular filtration rate) will be sent a letter or an email of 
invitation mentioning that they might be eligible for a research study and why, and a self -
addressed return envelope. Patients will also receive a letter of invitation that that states that 
they should return the envelop (or email) stating that they do not wish to be contacted by the 
research staff via telephone and a self -addressed return envelope.  We will call all patients 
that meet criteria for CKD that did not send back the letter stating that they did not wish to be 
contacted.  Phone calls will start 2 weeks after the mailing has been completed.  
2. We wi ll post media advertisements on sites such as Craig’s list, UIC list -serve, Redeye 
newspaper, and other relevant media using the advertisement called “media ad”.  
3. We will send letters advertising the study to persons over 60 years of age in Chicago and 
surrounding areas using the form titled study interest letter and study brochure.  
4. We will send a notice via the CCTS research match service using the form titled “research 
match”   
5. We will approach patients that have expressed an interest in the stud y to their provider at 
UIH clinics , this will include a brief medical records review for eligibility . 
 
Individuals who do not qualify for the study will be informed immediately after the telephone screening.  Following initial screening by phone interview a nd if no exclusion 
criteria are met and with the participant's consent, they will be scheduled for  an initial 
visit during which formal consent procedures will be executed.  After completion of the study, we will provide subjects with copies of their recor ds upon request.  Any abnormal 
results will be reported to study participants for appropriate medical follow -up as well as 
their provider upon consent.  
 Subjects that contact the study team will be given as much time as they feel necessary to decide if they would like to participate.  Subjects will be encouraged to ask any questions at any time throughout the course of the study.  Research personnel will be available to answer these questions.  Subjects will be informed that participating in this research i s voluntary. Subjects will be informed that they may withdraw from the 
research at any time without penalty.  The patient provider is not part of the study team.   
 Precautions to protect subject privacy will be taken throughout the course of the study.  All telephone conversations with potential subjects will be conducted in a private setting. 
Face to face conversations will be conducted within a private setting within the College of Nursing clinical health laboratory with private rooms.  Strict procedures  will be put in 
place to minimize the risk of breach of confidentiality.  All subjects will be assigned a study code.  The master list of the subject’s name and the linked code will be kept by the study manager in a locked file cabinet in a locked office.  All information provided by 
subjects will kept strictly confidential and will not be reported on an individual basis.  None of the information provided by subjects will become part of the medical record.  
Hard copy data will be stored in a locked office, and electronic data will be stored on a password- protected computer.  Hard copy and electronic data will be coded, with the 
master list kept separately in a secure file in the principal investigator’s office.  A HIPAA

information.  Subjects will be asked to sign the HIPAA consent form.  Subjects who refuse to agree to the HIPAA authorization will not be able to participate in this study.  
 
6.0 Study Design and Procedures  
This is a pilot study for feasibility . The study is designed as a randomized, controlled 
study.   
Screening procedures:  
1. Subjects will be recruited through fliers and a recruitment brochure in Chicago, 
surrounding communities, and at the outpatient clinics , and a via letters of 
invitation at UIC. The UI medical center electronic medical records database and 
the University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System Clinical Research Data Warehouse (CRDW) will be employed to identify potential patients for  the 
study, following HIPPA standards of authorization.  The EMR and The University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System Clinical Research Data Warehouse (CRDW) will be searched for diagnosis of CKD using creatinine and estimated glomerular filtra tion rate.  Name, address, email, phone numbers, and medical 
record number will be extracted into a file for research use.    
1. Patients that have a diagnosis code or meet criteria for CKD based on ICD codes or 
creatinine levels (or estimated glomerular f iltration rate) will be sent a letter or an email of 
invitation mentioning that they might be eligible for a research study and why, and a self -
addressed return envelope. Patients will also receive a letter of invitation that that states that 
they should r eturn the envelop (or email) stating that they do not wish to be contacted by the 
research staff via telephone and a self -addressed return envelope.  We will call all patients 
that meet criteria for CKD that did not send back the letter stating that they did not wish to be 
contacted.  Phone calls will start 2 weeks after the mailing has been completed.  
2. We will post media advertisements on sites such as Craig’s list, UIC list -serve, Redeye 
newspaper, and other relevant media using the advertisement called “media ad”.  
3. We will send letters advertising the study to persons over 60 years of age in Chicago and 
surrounding areas using the form titled study interest letter and study brochure.

5. We will approach patients that have expressed an interest in the study to their provider at 
UIH clinics , this will include a brief medical records review for eligibility . 
 
 2. Patients who are interested in participati ng in the study will have a phone 
interview to assess exclusion criteria.  The phone calls will be conducted in by 
the study mana ger in a private room located at the UIC College of Nursing, room 
229.  It is estimated that the telephone screen will take approximately 10 minutes.  This is the document titled “Telephone Screening -Eligibility  checklist ” 
and we will follow the telephone screening script titled “Phone Script”  
 3. a Following initial screening by phone interview the interested participants will 
be scheduled to come in to the College of Nursing 2nd floor Clinical Research 
Laboratory (845 S Damen Ave)  room 229. During this visit, the study will be 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
Exercise Training and Cognitive Function in Kidney Disease [9] 
Page 12 of 30 10-1-2018  thoroughly  explained and all questions will be answered.  Comprehension of all 
study procedures will be a scertained by non- leading open- ended questions.  If 
participants express an understanding of the study and study procedures and 
would like to participate in the study, written informed consent will be obtained.  No study procedures will take place prior to written informed consent.   
 3. b Following the informed consent process, medical history, the Charlson co-morbidity index questionnaire, blood pressure, heart rate, height, and weight, will be obtained by the PI and/or research assistant.  If there are no known contraindications to exercise the participant will continue study participation. These are the documents titled “medical history and “Charlson score tally”  We will complete the document titled “In- Person Screening Eligibility Checklist” and 
ask th e participant to fill out the form titled “demographics” and the form titled 
“Face sheet”.   
 3. c. Following these procedures participants will be asked to complete several questionnaires to assess their cognitive function. These questionnaires will be performed pre-  and post -intervention with alternative forms where available to 
avoid practice effects. In addition to an overall global composite of cognitive functioning, we will evaluate the following domains of functioning with the below noted tests. (tim e~1 hour): The forms are titled: Learning & Memory=California 
Verbal Learning Test -II (CVLT -II); Attention/Information Processing=Trail Making 
Test Part A (TMT -A) and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST); Executive 
Functioning, Phonemic and Semantic Fluency=Trail Making Test Part B and part M (TMT -B) and Digit Span subtest (DSp); Global Cognition=MOCA and WTAR 
(please see enclosed questionnaires). Quality of life will be assessed via the 
kidney disease quality of life questionnaire.  These questionnaires  will be 
administered at baseline and at 24 week follow up.  The study satisfaction 
questionnaire will be administered at 24 weeks only.
 
 Cognitive Outcomes  (Table 1) will be performed pre-  and post -intervention with 
alternative forms where available to avoid practice effects. In addition to an overall global composite of cognitive functioning, we will evaluate the following 
domains of functioning with the below noted tests. (time~1 hour)

3. d. Following these procedures a CCTS travel nurse will perform a standard 
venipuncture.  Ten milliliters  will be collected for determination of complete 
blood cell count and basic metabolic panel in order to characterize the sample. 
Coded  blood samples will be analyzed by Q uest diagnostics . An additional 10 
ml will be collected for analysis of vascular health biomarker in Dr. Bronas lab.    
 
3. e. Following blood draw  we will ask the participants to perform the short 
physical performance battery; participants attempt to stand for 10 seconds with 
their feet side by side, standing with the side of the heel of one foot touching the  
big toe of the other foot for about 10 seconds; and with the heel of one foot in front of and touching the toes of the other foot for about 10 seconds , they will 
then walk at a normal speed for a total of 4 meters (this test is repeated twice); the last part is called a chair rise where participants stand up from a chair 5 times  (see manual in the appendix).  Thereafter  a 6-minute walk  will be 
performed to determine total walking distance.  Participants will follow standard 
testing procedures for older patients. Participants will be asked to walk up and down a 100 foot long corridor as fast as they can without running. They will turn around a cone placed at each end of the walk. No encouragement will be given 
and participants will be allowed to stop and rest whenever they need. Heart rate (measured by a polar heart rate monitor) will be monitored at rest, during and 
following the walking test to ensure sa fety. Blood pressure will be assessed prior 
to and immediately following the 6- minute walk. The 6- minute walk is considered 
to be within usual activities of daily living and should not pose any risk to participants. The 6- minute walk test is an accepted method for determination of 
total walking distance in older adults with chronic illness  (see appendix for 
manual) . The document used are titled “6 minute walk test” and Short Physical 
Performance Battery”. These will be administered at baseline and at the 24 week follow up.    
 
The total time estimated for visit 1 is 2- 3 hours.  
 
Following completion of the initial visit we will ask the participants to wear a physical activity monitor, similar to a fancy pedometer, (actigraph GXT3 the size

Visit 2  (about 1 week following visit 1):  If able to undergo MRI scan:  The patient 
will return to UIC and the center for Magnetic Resonance Imaging Center UIC 
2242 W. Harrison St. Chicago IL 60612 .  During visit 2 we will ask participants 
to have their brain imaged by an MRI machine for assessment of their brain 
structure. The imaging will be performed on GE 3T MRI research dedicated scanner (MR 750) pre-  and post -intervention. Padding will ensure comfort and 
limit excessive motion during scanning. After a brief scout image for localization, we will acquire the following whole brain images using diffusion tensor imaging, DTI; T1 - and T2- weighted imaging; and arterial spin labeling (ASL). 
(time~1hour)  
 
Image acquisition will be performed on 
GE 3T MRI research dedicated scanner (MR 
750) pre-  and post -intervention. After a brief scout image for localization, we will acquire 
whole brain images using diffusion tensor imaging (DT I); and high- resolution 3D T1-
weighted imaging. We will determine and quantify white matter integrity (DTI -FA/MD); 
and hippocampal volume (T1). These are indices of alterations of brain inter -
connections, structure, and function, which are associated with cognitive functioning 
(details, table 2).

Page 15 of 30 10-1-2018  Image Analyses DTI: FSL with TBSS, we will quantify FA and MD from whole brain 
and tract specific white matter. T1/FSPGR: Usi ng FreeSurfer, we will extract 
hippocampal volumes (right and left) as well as sub- fields of the hippocampas adjusted 
for intracranial volume.T2- FLAIR: Using standard software, we will quantify white matter 
hyperintensity volumes across the entire brain white matter.  We will use a seed -based 
approach to measure resting state networks of interest. Functional connectivity 
networks : Functional brain networks will be generated using the resting -state fMRI 
toolbox, CONN ( http://www.nitrc.org/projects/conn ; (Whitfield -Gabrieli and Nieto-
Castanon, 2012)). In brief, raw EPI images are realigned, co- registered, normalized, 
and smoothed before analysis.   Any c onfound effects from motion artifact, white matter, 
and CS F are regressed out of the signal. Using the same label maps as the structural 
brain networks, functional brain networks will derived using pairwise BOLD signal correlations.  
 
The total estimated time during visit 2  is 1-2 hours. 
 
Visit 3. (about 1 week following visit 2): Du ring this visit we will assess  vascular 
health (arterial stiffness, endothelial function, and carotid artery compliance).  
 Participants will be asked to come back the college of nursing in the morning between 7- 11:00 am following an ov ernight fast with no caffeinated or sugary 
beverages in the morning of the test.  This is done to avoid any diurnal variability.   
Following a 15- minute supine rest will assess several vascular health indices 
listed below:   
Arterial Stiffness  will be measured using carotid- femoral pulse wave velocity 
following standard procedures:   
1. A blood pressure cuff is placed around the upper arm and is automatically inflated and deflated for determination of blood pressure and for pulse wave form analysis.  This is  similar to a usual blood pressure assessment during a clinical 
visit.  
2. A blood pressure cuff will be placed around the upper thigh of the subject and a hand- held tonometer (similar to the eraser end of a pencil) will be placed overt 
the carotid (neck) artery.  Once the tonometer detects a carotid pulse the blood pressure cuff is inflated (similar to a blood pressure obtained in a clinical visit, but on the upper thigh) and the pulse wave form is automatically collected.  This measure will be repeated 3 times and the average pulse wave velocity will be used. Total time=10 minutes  
 Endothelial function will be assess using brachial artery flow mediated vasodilation following standard guidelines:   
1. The participant’s brachial artery in the upper arm will be imaged using ultrasound. The ultrasound transducer will be placed on the participant’s upper arm and a baseline picture of the brachial artery will be obtained.  
2. A blood pressure cuff will be placed on the forearm of the participant.  The blood press ure cuff will be inflated to 20 mm Hg above the systolic pressure for 5 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________

Page 16 of 30 10-1-2018  minutes followed by a rapid deflation of the cuff.  The brachial artery will be 
imaged for 3- 5 minutes follow deflation of the cuff.  Total time=10 minutes  
 Carotid artery compliance w ill be assessed using ultrasound of the carotid artery.  
The carotid artery will be imaged using ultrasound.  The ultrasound transducer will be placed over the carotid artery and the carotid artery will be imaged for approximately 30 seconds.   
 Following the vascular assessment, the NIH Toolbox measures for Cognitive 
function will completed using the standard NIH Ipad (see administration manual) :

C.2.9 Auditory Verbal Learning Test (Rey) page 142  
  
Following  the NIH Toolbox measures for Cognitive function , the NIH toolbox 
motor measures  will completed using the standard NIH Ipad (see administration 
manual):  
Pegboard dexterity test  
Balance measures with the addition of iPod app for assessment of sway.  
Two-minute walk  (already assessed at visit 1, already IRB approved)  
Timed -up and go (TUG)  
Grip strength (using handheld dynamometer)  
4 meter walk (already IRB approved and assessed during visit 1)  
 
Upon completion of Visit 3 , the patient will be randomized to the 24- week walking 
program or usual care.  The randomization will be assignment by chanc e using a 
1:1 chance of being assigned to the exercise group over the usual care group. Participants cannot choose which exercise group they will be in.  The assignment is done by a randomized numbers table in computer program that acts like flipping a coi n to decide which group they will be placed in.   
 The total estimated time during visit 3  is 1-2 hours. 
 
The exercise training group will participate in an educational session on 
walking exercise for CKD during visit 2. Participants will receive a packet of 
information previously developed by the PI with exercise prescription and 
information, and a heart rate monitor that monitors the exercise. The documents 
handed out to the exercise group are titled “ Exercise Recommendations ” and 
“work effort scale”. We w ill work with the participant to 1) set up a schedule that 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
Exercise Training and Cognitive Function in Kidney Disease [9] 
Page 17 of 30 10-1-2018  fits with the participant’s schedule for home- based exercise; 2) identify time- slots 
for exercise; 3) work with the participants to assess their readiness to do 
exercise; 4) address perceived barri ers to exercise, and 5) build a relationship 
with the participants to provide support and address concerns. This will be done 
to empower participants to take individual control of the exercise program. 
Participants will be asked to exercise (a brisk walk) at home, 3 times per week, 
for 30-60 minutes for 24 weeks.  
 
Participants randomized to the exercise group will be contacted via phone 
biweekly or more frequently if they are slightly behind the exercise routine, and 
we will meet with them once per month  to provide encouragement and 
progression of exercise, and to download the heart rate monitor . Participants will 
have to option to upload their physical activity remotely  if they prefer, but they will 
still be asked to meet in person as scheduled.  This syste m will allow us to 
monitor and address any issues to achieve optimal compliance to the intervention. We have successfully conducted this type of partially supervised exercise program in CKD patients with excellent adherence and compliance rate 
(80-87%).  
 
The monthly meetings  (once per month)  will occur at months, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 
following randomization.  The PI and study staff will continue to work with the participants to assess their readiness to do exercise; 2) address perceived 
barriers to exercise, a nd 3) provide support and address concerns related to the 
exercise program. The meetings will last 30 minutes.  We will assess for any 
adverse events during the bi -weekly phone calls using the document title 
“Adverse Event Monitoring”. The total number of visits in the exercise group is 11.  
 
Usual medical care control group 
The usual care group will receive standard instructions on exercise for patients with kidney disease. These documents are titled “ Exercise Recommendations ” 
and “work effort scale”. This is similar to what is commonly done in clinical 
practice. The control group will not receive an exercise prescription or heart rate monitor. Participants will be contacted via phone biweekly to answer any 
questions and ensure continued study participation.   In order to minimize any 
feeling of disenfranchisement in the control group we will offer them the exercise 
training prescription following all post -test data collection procedures. The usual 
care group will NOT meet monthly.  We will assess for any adverse events during 
the bi -weekly phone calls using the document title “Adverse Event Monitoring”. 
The total number of visits for the usual care group is 5.

Ten participants with an eGFR of >60 ml/min will only undergo baseline testing and 
not partake in the intervention or follow up.  We will ask if the participants with an 
eGFR >60 ml/min prefer to only to the baseline versus intervention.  
 Follow -up testing will occur at 24 weeks  over 2 visits about 1 week apart .  During 
the follow up testing we will ask participants to perform one 6- minute walk test  
and the short physical performance battery , and the NIH toolbox measures  as 
described above,  as well as completing the questionnaires  and imaging 
procedures  described above.   
 
During the 24- week visit we will query patients using structured interviews and 
open- ended questions as to whether participants liked the independent home-
based walking program.  Study satisfaction will be assessed using a likert scale 
and open- ended question at the end of the 24 week fol low up test. .   
 
Physical activity and exercise monitoring and Assessment of Adherence to 
Exercise Rehabilitation Program (fidelity of treatment):  
1. Adherence to the exercise program in the intervention group will be tracked 
using a heart rate monitor.  T he heart rate monitor will track when exercise 
training has been performed (date), duration of the exercise, and the intensity of 
the exercise.  These data will be downloaded at each monthly visit to assess 
adherence to the program (this is coded data).  A dherence and volume of 
exercise will be calculated as number of exercise sessions performed divided by number of prescribed exercise session x 100.   
 
2.  We will also ask  all participants  regardless of group assignment  to wear the 
lightweight accelerometer worn on the hip (Actigraph GTX3, Actigraph) for 7 days 
at weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24  following randomization. Participants will be mailed 
the actigraph and reminded to wear it during the biweekly phone calls. They will be asked to return the actigraph after  1 week using a stamped self -addressed 
return envelope. This is done to assess daily physical activity and is not an intervention.
56 
 
 
The study manager will be trained and checked off by the PI  in the measurement 
of the 6-minute walk  and short physical performance battery .  Fidelity and 
competence will be c ontinuously monitored by the PI  and protocol fidelity will be 
ascertained during bi -weekly  phone calls and the once per month visits.

7.0 Expected Risks/Benefits 
Risk associated with the medical history assessment  
Discomfort  could be felt by participants when answering questions about their 
medical history.  
Risk associated with the physical function battery  
There is a slight risk of falling during the balance testing.  
Risk associated with the 6 m inute walk  
There is a slight risk of abnormally high blood pressure, shortness of breath, 
muscle injury, and muscle soreness.  The risk of serious adverse events with 
maximal exercise testing has been estimated to be 0.5 per 10,000 tests (Stuart, 1980 Ches t), the risk of death associated with a 6- minute walk is currently not 
known, but is considered minimal risk.  The exercise test (6 minute walk) proposed in this study is considered no more than usual activity of daily living and is considered moderate int ensity exercise.  There is a risk that underlying 
disease may be uncovered during study participation. This would most likely be undiagnosed cerebrovascular disease, previous stroke or mini -stroke.  These 
findings would be immediately related to the patient and the providers (upon patient approval).  These findings may require additional testing and procedures 
as deemed necessary by the patient's provider.   
Risk s associated with the walking exercise training  
There is a slight risk of injury associated with exercise training in a sedentary. 
population.  There is a slight risk of abnormally high blood pressure, shortness 
of breath, muscle injury, and muscle soreness associated with exercise training in a sedentary (not used to exercise) population.  The risk of serious adverse 
events with maximal exercise testing has been estimated to be 0.5 per 10,000 
tests (Stuart, 1980 Chest), the risk of death associated with walk ing exercise 
training  is currently not known, but is considered minimal risk.  The exercise 
training proposed in this study is considered no more than usual activity of daily 
living and is considered moderate intensity exercise.  There is a risk that 
underlying disease may be uncovered during study participation. This would most likely be undiagnos ed cerebrovascular disease, previous stroke or mini -
stroke.  These findings would be immediately related to the patient and the 
providers (upon patient approval).  These findings may require additional testing 
and procedures as deemed necessary by the pati ent's provider.

Exercise Training and Cognitive Function in Kidney Disease [9] 
Page 20 of 30 10-1-2018  Risks associated with the venipuncture (blood draw)  
The blood draw may cause pain and bruising. There is a slight risk for infection, 
lightheadedness and fainting.  
Risk associated with the cognitive function questionnaires .  
There is a sl ight risk that participants will feel uncomfortable with filling out the 
questionnaires.  Participants could find answering the questions boring and/or 
tiring. We will monitor the  progress and allow participants to take breaks as 
needed. If they become upset or uncomfortable, they  may skip a given question.  
Risks associated with the MRI:  
The MRI does not use x -ray radiation or radioactive material. The magnetism of 
the machine attracts certain metals, which could put participants at risk. 
Therefore, people w ith pacemakers, infusion pumps, metal prostheses, metallic -
backed transdermal patches or metallic shrapnel will be excluded from the 
study.  A checklist will be completed that addresses issues of MRI safety. Some 
people may feel somewhat closed- in (claustr ophobic) during the MRI procedure. 
The MRI scans can get quite noisy and this may cause some discomfort. We will provide padding, a blanket, and ear plugs to ensure comfort. This risk is 
minimized by careful screening by qualified research personnel prior to entry 
into the MRI room. Subjects with metal implantations will not be recruited. Participants’ can withdraw at any time and we will closely monitor them to 
ensure safety and comfort.  
Risks associated with ultrasound procedure:  
 
There could be pressure felt on the neck  from the hand- held tonometer, which 
might make participants  feel uncomfortable.  The inflation of the blood pressure 
cuffs might feel too tight and cause discomfort (similar to that of having a blood pressure measured in clinic).   
The blo od pressure cuff could feel too tight and it may cause discomfort and 
pain.  
There  might  be pressure on the  neck from the ultrasound Doppler transducer, 
which could feel uncomfortable  
If any of these occur the measurement  will stop immediately .  
 
8.0 Data Collection and Management Procedures  
 
Results from all measurements , and questionnaires will be recorded on coded 
source documents before being entered into the electronic database that is password protected and housed on a secure CON server that only the PIs  and 
statistician  have access to.  Source documents will be stored  in a locked file 
cabinet in a locked office that only the PIs have access to.  coded  exercise data 
from the heart rate monitor  and actigraph will be downloaded at each follow -up

entered into the main database as described above.   
 
 9.0 Data Analysis 
Dr. Alana Steffen of the College of Nursing statistician will conduct all analyses.  The apriori stated analysis is l isted below . 
This is a pilot study for feasibility . For these pilot data we will emphasize 
descriptive statistics such as means, standard deviations, effect sizes, medians, interquartile ranges, frequencies, and percentages to demonstrate the feasibility of recruitment, adherence, and retention, treatment effects over time, and proof 
of concept.  Our statistical approach for a full trial of these hypotheses will be Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) with an identity link function for a continuous outcom e or a logit link function for a binary outcome.  Conceptually, 
GLMM is a more advanced version of repeated measures ANOVA that can account for potential correlation among multiple measurements over time while having flexibility in fitting outcomes with di fferent distributions (such as normal, 
binomial or Poisson, etc.). One advantage of this approach over repeated measures ANOVA is that there is no assumption that participants are measured at every, or even the same, time points. Therefore, these models ar e very 
flexible at handling missing data. Participants who have a missing observation are not excluded, thus, this produces the intention to treat (ITT) full information maximum likelihood (FIML) model.  Conducting these models on pilot data help with sample size calculations for a future R01 submission.  
   
10.0 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
Data will be evaluated for protocol adherence during weekly meetings with the PIs and the study manager. Dr. Bronas will evaluate all data for quality during weekly study  meeting s. Biweekly vis its will be conducted by the PI  to ensure 
that data collection is carried out according to the protocol.  
  
 
11.0 Data and Safety Monitoring 
Serious adverse events will be monitored and tracked at each  follow -up period 
and biweekly phone calls .  Patients will be queried at  the biweekly phone calls 
and at  24 weeks if they have had any visits to the emergency department or 
hospitalizations (see attached checklist).  We will also ask if they have had any symptoms of cardiac -related problems such as chest, arm or jaw pain while 
exercising or not exercising. Data will be recorded on an excel spreadsheet and reviewed by the PI at weekly study meetings.  Any unanticipated adverse events or problems will be reported to the IRB within 7 days on notification.   Ulf G. 
Bronas, PhD, ATC, FSVM, FAHA will monitor safety data.  Subjects are free to withdraw from the study at any time.  If a subject withdraws from the study we 
will ask the subject (only once) if they are willing to come back for the follow -up 
tests.  If the subject does not want to complete the study, not further contact 
attempts will be conducted and the subject will be discontinued from the study (this will be reported at the annual continuing review).

Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) with an identity link function for a continuous outcome or a logit link function for a binary outcome.  Conceptually, GLMM is a more advanced version of repeated measures ANOVA that can 
account for potential correlation among multiple measurements over time while having flexibility in fitting outcomes with different distributions (such as normal, binomial or Poisson, etc.). One advantag e of this approach over repeated 
measures ANOVA is that there is no assumption that participants are measured at every, or even the same, time points. Therefore, these models are very flexible at handling missing data. Participants who have a missing obser vation are not 
excluded, thus, this produces the intention to treat (ITT) full information maximum likelihood (FIML) model.  Conducting these models on pilot data help with sample size calculations for a future R01 submission.  
   This is a pilot study investigating the feasibility  and proof -of-concept .  There is no 
power -calculation for this study:  This study may not be powered to find 
statistically significant differences between groups due to the smaller sample size.  Based on previous studies, we do expect to find at a minimum a trend for improvement cognitive function and brain structure.  We expect to be able to use 
these data for determination of the necessary sample size for detection of significant differences between groups  
 
13.0 Regulatory Require ments  
13.1 Informed Conse nt 
Each interested subject will be mailed a copy of the consent form 1 week prior to scheduling the initial consent visit.  This will be done to allow potential subjects sufficient time to consider participation. Informed consent w ill be obtain in the 
CON Health Research Laboratory 229 at the baseline visit. Informed  consent will 
be obtained using procedures and documents understandable to the subject.  Individuals who are unable to give informed consent will be excluded from partic ipation in this research.  All study personnel will have received the required 
UIC CITI and HIPAA training prior to i nitiation of the study.  The PI  (Ulf Bronas), 
and the study manager will obtain consent.  Subjects that contact the study team will be given as much time as they feel necessary to decide if they would like to participate.  Subjects will be encouraged to ask any questions at any time throughout the course of the study.  Research personnel will be available to answer these questions.  Subjects will be informed that participating in this research is voluntary. Subjects will be informed that they may withdraw from the research at any time without penalty.  Patient providers are not part of the study team.  Informed consent documents will be kept i n a locked file cabinet in a 
locked office separate from other study documents.  Only the PI (Ulf Bronas) will have access to these files.   
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
Exercise Training and Cognitive Function in Kidney Disease [9] 
Page 25 of 30 10-1-2018  We have requested approval for a waiver of consent for recruitment purposes 
only to identify potential subjects fro m the medical records.  We will only obtain 
patients name, address, medical record number, and whether they have the ICD code for diagnosis of CKD.  This is minimal risk. We are requesting an alteration 
of consent to conduct the telephone screening for all  potential subjects that have 
expressed an interest in the study and would like to be contacted by the stud team.  The telephone screen will be used to determine initial eligibility and to schedule the consent visit.  The telephone screen is minimal risk.  The only 
potential risk to participating in the telephone screen is loss of confidentiality.  The initial telephone screening and interview is a component of the study and involves an assessment to determine if individuals potentially interested in partic ipating meet the preliminary qualification criteria and attests to their interest 
in participating in the entire study.  Candidates who meet the screening criteria and agree to participate will be invited to schedule an initial visit during which formal wr itten consent processes will be executed.  The telephone screening 
obviates the need for unnecessary visits to UIC.  This represents an alteration in the consent process  
13.2 Subject Confidentiality  
Precautions to protect subject privacy will be taken thr oughout the course of the 
study.  All telephone conversations with potential subjects will be conducted in a 
private setting.  Face to face conversations will be conducted within a private 
setting within the College of Nursing clinical health laboratory wi th private rooms.  
Strict procedures will be put in place to minimize the risk of breach of 
confidentiality.  All subjects will be assigned a study code.  The master list of the subject’s name and the linked code will be kept by the study manager in a lock ed 
file cabinet in a locked office.  All information provided by subjects will kept 
strictly confidential and will not be reported on an individual basis.  None of the information provided by subjects will become part of the medical record.  Hard 
copy data  will be stored in a locked office, and electronic data will be stored on a 
password- protected computer.  Hard copy and electronic data will be coded, with 
the master list kept separately in a secure file in the principal investigator’s office.  
A HIPAA au thorization form will be developed for this study to use/disclose 
protected health information.  Subjects will be asked to sign the HIPAA consent form.  Subjects who refuse to agree to the HIPAA authorization will not be able to participate in this study. Study data will be coded in numerical order (e.g. 
CKD001, CKD002 etc.). The link to the code will be maintained by the project 
manager and will be kept in a locked file cabinet in a locked office separate from 
study data.  An electronic copy of the masterf ile will be kept in a folder, separate 
from the data and study forms, on a UIC secured drive. The project manager and 
PIs will have access to the code.   The link to identifiers will be destroyed after 6

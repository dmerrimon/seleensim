Rationale and Background: Palbociclib, the first oral cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor, is approved for
HR+/HER2–metastatic/advanced breast cancer (MBC) in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant. Improved median PFS was observed with Palbociclib plus Letrozoleas first-line therapy (PALOMA-2) and with Fulvestrant in patients who have failed prior endocrine therapy (PALOMA-3). Since its approval in February 2015, Palbociclib has been prescribed for more than 100,000patients. Recent real-world studies support the effectiveness of Palbociclib-based therapy in HR+/HER2– MBC patients. It is important to 
better understand a treatment’s benefits and risks in a real world setting as published real-world studies to date have limitations including small cohorts, short duration of PPD

record (EHR) data are collected as part of routine clinical practice and enable quick access to richer health information (as compared to claims database) in a timely manner (as compared to primary data collection) in a relatively large population. Utilizing Flatiron Health’s longitudinal, demographically and geographically diverse database derived from electronic health record (EHR)data from over 265 cancer clinics (~800 sites of care), the current study 
is designed to describe patient characteristics, treatment patterns and effectiveness of 
Palbociclib in combination with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) as initial endocrine based therapy in HR+/HER2- MBC. 
Research question and objectives: This study aims to describe patient characteristics, treatment patterns and effectiveness in 
HR+/HER2- MBC patients initiating Palbociclib + AI as initial endocrine based therapy during the period of February/3/2015 through August/31/2018 (or 3 months prior to study cut-off date) in the United States (US) real-world clinical practice setting.
Primary Objectives
•To describe demographic and clinical characteristics of metastatic/advanced (MBC) 
patients who were treated with Palbociclib + AI as initial endocrine based therapy.
•To describe treatment patterns of Palbociclib + AI as initial endocrine based therapy 
for MBC.
•To examine effectiveness of Palbociclib + AI as initial endocrine based therapy for 
MBC, including real world progression free survival (rwPFS), overall survival (OS), and real world tumor response (rwTR).
Secondary objectives
•To examine effectiveness of Palbociclib + AI as initial endocrine based therapy for 
MBC by subgroups such as age, ECOG performance, metastatic status, menopausal status, and prior therapy.
•To examine the time from Palbociclib + AI initiation to the next line of anti-cancer 
treatment and time to first use of chemotherapy.  
Study design: This is a retrospective cohort study utilizing data derived from the Flatiron 
Health Analytic Database to describe patient characteristics, treatment patterns and effectiveness of Palbociclib + AI as initial endocrine based therapy in HR+/HER2- MBC during the period of February/3/2015 through August/31/2018 (or 3 months prior to study cut-off date) in the US real-world clinical practice setting.

evaluated retrospectively from index date to November 30, 2018 (or study cut-off date), ordeath, whichever came first.
 
 
 
Population Setting: This study uses secondary de-identified Flatiron Healthcare Analytic 
data that involve patients who have been diagnosed with MBC in the United States.
Study Population: Female patients will be eligible for analysis if they were aged 18 or 
above at MBC diagnosis, HR+/HER2- as confirmed by a test before or up to 60 days after the date of MBC diagnosis, and were treated with Pablociclib + AI or Letrozole alone for MBC during the period from February 2015 through August 2018 (or 3 months prior to study cut-off date). Eligible patients will be identified from the Flatiron Health Analytic Database.
Variables: Variables will be obtained from both structured and unstructured data using 
Flatiron’s technology-enabled data processing. The following variables will be included for the analyses: demographics (eg, age, race, ethnicity, region), baseline clinical characteristics (eg, date of diagnosis of MBC, HR+/HER2- status, ECOG performance status, disease stage at initial diagnosis, site of metastasis, and number of disease sites), treatment patterns (eg, AItherapy partner, starting dose, dose adjustment, duration of treatment, discontinuation, and reasons for dose adjustment and discontinuation), and effectiveness (real-world progression-free survival, overall survival, real-world tumor response, time to next line of anti-cancer treatment, and time to chemotherapy).  
Data sourceFlatiron Health’s longitudinal, demographically and geographically diverse database derived 
from electronic health record (EHR) data from over 265 cancer clinics (~800 sites of care) including more than 2 million active US cancer patients.
Study Size: Based on an initial feasibility assessment using Flatiron Health Analytic 
Database between February 2015 – November 2018, there are 1,367 HR+/HER2- MBC patients who received Palbociclib + AI (including 1,221 Pablociclib + Letrozole, 70 Palbociclib + Anastrozole, and 76 Palbociclib + Exemestane) and 627 patients who received Letrozole monotherapy in the database. All patients satisfying inclusion and exclusion criteria will be included in the statistical analyses. 
Data Analysis: Descriptive analyses will be performed to describe baseline demographics
and clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and effectiveness outcomes for patients receiving Palbociclib + AI as initial endocrine based therapy for MBC. Kaplan-Meier curves and landmark analyses will be performed to estimate real-world progression-free survival, overall survival, real-world tumor response, and time to chemotherapy from Palbociclib + AICCI

7. RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and the second most common cancer 
overall. In 2016, there were approximately 3.5 million women living with a history of breast cancer (BC) in the US.
1It is estimated that 154,794 American women living with metastatic 
BC in the US in 2017 and that 3 in 4 initially diagnosed with early stage BC will progress to MBC.
2Hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed 
subtype (~70-80%), and it is potentially sensitive to endocrine therapy.3
Palbociclib, the first oral CDK4/6 inhibitor, is approved for HR+/HER2– advanced and metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or Fulvestrant.Palbociclib is approved in the US based on improved median PFS demonstrated in 3 pivotal clinical trials: PALOMA-1 and PALOMA 2 (initial endocrine based therapy) and PALOMA-3 (after progression following endocrine therapy). Approval was first granted based on findings from the phase II PALOMA-1 trial
4in February 2015. Palbociclib in 
combination with Fulvestrant was approve d one year later (February 2016) in pre- or 
post-menopausal women with disease progression following endocrine therapy based on results from the PALOMA-3 trial.
5,6  The phase III PALOMA-2 confirmed the findings in 
PALOMA-1, demonstrating a median progression-free survival (PFS) in the Palbociclib plus Letrozole arm of 24.8 months compared to 14.5 months in the placebo plus Letrozole arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.58; P = <0.001).
7  Subgroup analyses of PFS according to 
stratification factors and demographic or prognostic factors revealed consistent results in PALOMA-2
7[6] and PALOMA-3 trial.5,6  The primary toxicity of Palbociclib is neutropenia,
which can be managed with dose interruption/reduction, resulting in a favorable safety profile and delayed deterioration of global QoL.
8,9The safety results from all three trials 
were consistent, with no new safety signals identified in the phase III studies. Subsequently,Palbociclib has been granted regular approval in combination with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) for initial endocrine based treatment.
10
Since its approval in February 2015, Palbociclib has rapidly become the standard of care in the treatment of HR+/HER2- MBC in women, commercially available multi-nationally. Palbociclib has been prescribed for more than 100,000 patients. Long-term pooled safety analyses of three randomized phase II and III studies demonstrated no evidence of specific cumulative or delayed toxicities with Palbociclib plus endocrine therapy.
11  Recent 
real-world data have demonstrated that Palbociclib is effective in HR+/HER2– MBC patients CCI CCI

(~800sites of care) representing more than 2 million active U.S. cancer patients available for 
analysis.In the c urrent study , a novel non- interventional (NI) stud y approac h will be taken 
to utilize Flatiron Health database to understand patient characteristics, treatment patterns 
and effectiveness of Palbociclib + AI at init ial endocrine based therap y in M BC pa tients.

9.4. Data Source
Flatiron Health Database (https://flatiron.com/real-world-evidence/).
This retrospective observational study utilized Flatiron Health’s longitudinal, 
demographically and geographically diverse database derived from electronic health record (EHR) data from over 265 cancer clinics (~800 sites of care) including more than 2 million active US cancer patients available for analysis. Across the clinics in the Flatiron Health Network, data become available in near real time after each clinical encounter and contribute to Flatiron’s continuously aggregating centralized data set.  The patient-level data in the EHRs includes structured data (ie, data points that are organized in a predefined manner, such as dropdown fields that reside in an EHR to capture a patient’s gender or date of birth or laboratory data), unstructured data collected via expert human chart abstraction of physician’s notes and other free text fields couple with quality controlled natural language processing and business rules technology, and other unstructured documents (ie, information from a portable document format [PDF] laboratory reports or narratives from synoptic reports). Flatiron integrates the structured EHR data with quality controlled curated data from unstructured EHR data into a single data model, where all data are certified HIPAA-compliant with all de-identified patients being assigned a longitudinally stable identifier. Details of de-identification procedure and data management are outline in the Flatiron’s parent database protocol (NEIRB#15 159, “The Flatiron Health Analytic Database”). 
The data used in this analysis already exist within this 
model, stored in an electronic database.  
All data, code to create the MBC dataset, and other technical artifacts are version-controlled 
and managed within a Flatiron repository. These artifacts are stored and backed up on Flatiron’s servers for at least 7 years. All data within the dataset can be traced back to the original source data or documents within the EHR, and appropriate change management and provenance best practices are maintained by Flatiron in the event of a regulatory audit. 
Institutional Review Board approval of the study protocol was obtained prior to study 
conduct, and included a waiver of informed consent. Data provided to third parties were de-identified and provisions were in place to prevent re-identification in order to protect patients’ confidentiality.
The data cut-off for this study is November  30, 2018 (or latest Flatiron data cut-off date).

Based on a n initial feasibility  assessment using Flatiron Health Anal ytic Database between 
February  2015 –November 2018, there are 1,367 HR +/HER2- MBC patients who received 
Palbociclib + AI (including 1,221 Pabl ociclib + Letrozole , 70Palbociclib + Anastr ozole, and
76 Palbociclib + Exemestane) and 627 patients who received Letrozole monotherapy in 
the database. All eligible patients willbe included for descriptive anal yses. 
9.6.Data Management
Flatiron Health Dat abase ( https://flatiron.com/ real-world -evide nce/) collects data through a 
HIPAA -compliant process that results in de -identified patient data as described above. 
De-identified data are prepared b y Flatiron and transferred securel y to Pfizer in a standard 
flat file format. Once on Pfi zer servers, P fizer staff perform quality  assurance on the data, 
checking that the metadata align with the data dictionary  from Flatiron Health, tha t the 
number of records equals that expected from the vendor and that the data t ypes and 
controlled vocabula ries are corre ct in a semi -automated process. The data are then loaded 
into a secure Pfizer server. Pfizer servers are backed up nightly , and have failover and 
off-site redundancy .Access to data is limited only  to Pfizer colleagues and is monitored with 
all end use r activity  is logged. Pfizer maintains copies of all EHR or other real world data in 
accordance with the FDA's July  2018 I ndustry  Guida nce on Use of Electronic Health Record 
Data in Clinical Investigations 
(https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceR egulatoryInformation/Guidan
ces/UCM501068.pdf ), though Pfizer maintains its data in excess of the guidance – for a 
minimu m of 7 y ears.  
9.6.1. Case Report Forms (CRFs)/Data Collection Tools (DCTs)/Electronic Data Record
As described above, Flatiron Health Database collects data through a HIPAA -compliant 
process that results in de -identified patient data .
9.6.2. Record Retention
To enabl e evaluat ions and/or inspections/audits from regulatory  authorities or Pfizer , Flatiron 
Health has agreed to keep all study -related records, including electronic health records, data 
curated b y Flatiron from unstructured fields within those records, rationale for a curated data 
point, query  code and the dataset provided under this protocol from their larger MBC 
registry .  The records should be retained by  Flatiron according to lo cal regulations or as 
specified in the statement of work , whichever is longer. Flatiron must ensure that the records 
continue to be stored securely  for so long as they  are retained.
If Flatiron becomes unable for any  reason to continue to retain study  records for the required 
period, P fizer should be pros pectivel y notified.  The stu dy record s mu st be transferred to a 
designee acceptable to Pfizer .
Study  records must be kept for a minimum of 7 years after completion or discontinuation of 
the study , as expre ssly agreed to within the statement of work by Flatiron and Pfizer. Pfizer 
will retain all anal ysis datasets, code and other artefacts generated over the course of

9.7.Data Analysis
The primary  and secondary  objectives of the study are to describe patient characteristics, 
real-word treatment patterns and effectiveness of Palbociclib + AI as initial endocrine based 
thera pyfor metastatic breast cancer. 
Descriptive anal yses: For categorical variables ( eg,region, race, and stage at initial 
diagnosis), data will include the frequency  (number of cases) and percentag e (%) of total 
patient s observed in each category ; for cont inuous variables ( eg,age and time from initial 
breast cancer diagnosis to metastatic diagnosis), variables will be presented as the mean, 
standard deviation (SD), median, 25thand 75thpercen tiles and ranges (minimum a nd 
maximum) in some cases. The calcu lation of percentages will alway s include the missing 
category  in the case of missing values.  Continuous variables may  be categorized into 
intervals, with the distribution of patients (N, %) provided. 
Kaplan -Meier cur ves and landmark anal yses wi ll be per form ed to estimate real -world 
progression- free survival, overall survival , and t imeon treatment , time to next line of 
anti-cancer therap y, and time to first use of chemotherap y. Specificall y, landmark time 
points are 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months f or rwPFS and rwTR , 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 
3years for overall survival, and 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months for Time on Treatment 
with Palbociclib + AI and time to next ant -cancer thera py and to first use of chemotherapy . 
Ninety -five percent (95%) c onfidence interval s on the median rwPFS, overall survival, and 
treatment time will be reported.
The maximum real-world tumor response will be computed for each patient with at least one
on-Palbociclib + AI treatment tumor assessment.  If a patient has a m axim um tumor response 
of a CR or PR, then the patient will be considered to be a responder . Response rate will be 
computed using the number of patients with a CR or PRasthe numerator and the number of 
patients with at least 1 on -treatment tumor assessme nt as the denomi nator .
Subgroup anal yses will be conducted according to age, ECOG performance (0, 1, ≥2), de 
novo metastatic, visceral , non -visceral, bone only , disease sites (1, 2, ≥ 3), menopausal status, 
prior endocrine therapy , prior chemotherap y, prior surgery, prior rad iation therap yas 
appropriate based on availabilities of the data and sample sizes . 
The following sensitivity anal yses will be performed as appropriate : 
1.A subset of patients receiving Palbociclib+A Iin the first -line metastatic setting with 
at least three prescriptions for Palbociclib will be included .
2. Patients were followed for at le ast 6 months .

9.8. Quality Control
This is a retrospective study, so issues of quality control at study sites, eg, data clarification 
queries, do not apply. Analyses are programmed according the specifications in the protocol's SAP and all code and other technical artifacts are documented and stored following established programming practices on Pfizer servers and in Pfizer’s GlobalDocument Management System.  Quality control (QC) will follow the Flatiron’s standard procedure for quality control and assurance as described in Flatiron Health Analytic Database Parent Protocol.  QC for structured and unstructured data is conducted prior to delivery of each dataset.  For each data model, Flatiron generates and continually maintains a set of quality standards and versioned business rules. These QC standards cover themes such as demographics, biomarkers, treatment, therapy shares, treatment length/dosage, lines of therapy, real world recurrence, and real world progression free survival. They have a team of 900 expert nurse and physician abstractors that co-create and version rules, and also to create QC that includes both medical considerations (eg, what are expected based on the literature and clinical practice) and data considerations (eg, stability from prior months). Missingness of death data is a major confounding factor for many real-world oncology analyses. For survival data, Flatiron Health utilizes four resources, including the National Death Index, US Social Security Death Index, obituaries and commercial death data published from a vendor to identify when patients have died (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1475-6773.12872). In a study of advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients, sensitivity increased from 66% from Flatiron's HER-based registry alone to over 91% from the composite of the four sources.
QC will be performed for the results of the study, including reviewing and double checking 
for correct data, consistency, spelling, grammar and structure. It is also reviewed to ensure that it conforms to Flatiron's data dictionary, has internal consistency (eg, that date of diagnosis occurs after date of birth) and meets the study objectives. The final review of the findings and content will be conducted in a summary presentation.CCI

Page 259.9.Limitations of the Research M ethods
The prop osed s tudymay have the following limitations.
One of the main challenges of EHR data is the pot ential for mi ssing, inaccurate or incomplete 
data.  For example, EHR contains only  that a ph ysician prescribed a drug but not whether it 
was filled/refilled. Thequalityof information extracted from the EHR depends on the 
quality  of information en tered the EHR b y the clinician.  Feeds of EHR data may  be updated 
only every  3-6 months, with some vendors providing more rapid updates. Data qualit y, 
missingness and o therchallenges are mitigated with Flatiron's semi -automated enhanced 
curation and qualit y control, though th ese challenges are not full y obviated by these expert 
biocurators, rules and processes.
The patient populations in the Flatiron database may  not be reflective of the general 
population nationally .  Some skewing in the data is po ssible if differences exist between 
patients in this study  cohort and general patient population. Thus, the results of this study  
will be unprojected ( ie,analy seswill be ba sed on the sample collected and not projected to 
the national level).  
Due to the nature of the data employ ed in this study , it is not feasible to make an assessment 
of causalit y between medical events recorded and the medicinal products at an individual 
case level. As a result of the way  this study  is designed, no causal infer ence can be 
ascertained, as this is an observational study  using retrospective data. Secondary  data does 
not report the causality .
In addition , sample size may  limit s ubgroup analy ses and generalizability of the findings.

Page 2711.MANAGEMENT AND RE PORT ING OF  ADVERSE EVENTS/ADVERSE 
REACTIONS 
This study  uses existing health care databases, in which it is g enerall y not possible to link ( ie,
identify  a potential association between) a particular product and medical event for any  
individual.
In addition , this study  protocol requires human review of patient -level unstructured data; 
unstructured data refer to ve rbatim medical data, including tex t-based descriptions and visual 
depic tions of medical information, such as medical records, images of physician n otes, 
neurological scans, X- rays, or narrative fields in a database. The reviewers are obligated to 
report a dverse events (AE) with explicit a ttribution to any  Pfizer drug that appear in the 
reviewed information (defined per the patient populat ion and study  perio d specified in the 
protocol). Explicit attribution is not inferred b y a temporal relationship between drug 
administration and an AE, b ut must be based on a definite statement of causality  by a 
healthcare provider linking drug administra tion to the AE.
Therequirements for reporting safet y events on the non -interventional study  (NIS) adverse 
event monitor ing (AEM) Report Form to Pfizer Sa fety are as follows:
All serious and non- serious AEs with explicit attribution to any Pfizer drug that
appear in the reviewed information must be recorded on the chart abstraction form 
and reported, within 24 hours of awar eness, to Pfizer safet y using the NIS AEM 
Report F orm.
Scenarios involving drug exposure, including exposure during pregnancy , exposure 
during brea st feeding, medication error, overdose, misuse, extravasation, lack of 
efficacy and occupational exposure associated with the use of a Pfizer product must 
be report ed, within 24 hours of awareness, to Pfizer Safet y using NIS AEM Report 
Form.
Forthese safe ty events with an explicit attribution to or associated with use of, respectively , a 
Pfizer product, the data captured in the medical record will constitute all cli nical information 
known regarding these AEs. No follow -up on related AEs will be conducted.
All research staff members will complete the Pfizer requirements regarding training on the 
following : “Your R eporting Responsibilities : Monitoring the Safety, Performance and 
Quality of Pfizer Products ( Multiple Languages)” and an y relevant Your Reporting 
Resp onsibilities supplemental training. This training must be completed b y research staff 
members prior to t he start of data collection. All trainings include a “Confirmation of 
Training Certificate” (for signature b y the trainee) as a record of completi on of the training 
which must be kept in a retrievable format. Copies of all signed training certificates mu st be 
provided to Pfizer.

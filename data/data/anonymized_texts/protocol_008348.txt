TITLE:   
An Observational, Multicenter Study of the Prevalence of Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis (CTX) in Patient 
Populations Diagnosed with Early -Onset Idiopathic Bilateral Cataracts  
 
PROTOCOL NO.:  
018CTXX15001  
INVESTIGATOR STUDY SITE S: 
This multi -center study will involve approximately 50 study sites  in the United States .   
OBJECTIVES:  
Primary Objective:  
To calculate the prevalence of CTX  in a patient population diagnosed between the ages of 2 and  21 years old  
(inclusive)  with early -onset idiopathic bilateral cataracts  
Secondary Objective:  
To assess other manifestations of CTX within patients presenting with i diopathic bilateral cataracts  
METHODOLOGY:  
This is an observational, multicenter study to determine the prevalence of CTX  in patient populations 
diagnosed with early -onset idiopathic bilateral catarac ts.  Patients who are potentially eligible for study 
participation will be identified through a chart review of patients who were seen at each study site prior to that 
site’s initiation, or by entering care  at the site while the site is  participating  in the trial.  
NUMBER OF PATIENT S: 
Approximately 500 patients will be enrolled in this study.

 3 INTRODUCTION  
Genetic basis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis  
Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis  (CTX ) is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by 
mutations in the cytochrome P450 CYP27A1  gene that result in production of a defective sterol 
27-hydroxylase enzyme.  Physiologically, the CYP27 enzyme is present in mitochondria and 
involved in bile acid synthesis.  If normal, it functions by introducing a hydroxyl group in the 
C27 position, as the first step in shorten ing the steroid side chain of 7 -hydroxylated 
interm ediates or other substrates such as cholesterol.   In CTX patients, reduced bile acid 
synthesis causes decreased inhibition of cholesterol 7 -hydroxylase activity and increased 
formation of 7 -hydroxy -4-cholesten -3-one, which accumulates and leads to produc tion of 
cholestanol and abnormal 25 -hydroxylated bile alcohols.  
The upregulation of both cholesterol and cholestanol synthesis leads to an accumulation of 
cholesterol in cholestanol -containing xanthomas in a variety of body tissues over time.  This is 
the chief pathophysiologic mechanism responsible for many of the symptoms associated with 
CTX. [1] 
Verrips et al  [2] reported on genotypes and genotype/phenotype correlation in 58 CTX patients 
they studied and 67 patients reported in published literature (total of 125 patients from 
74 unrelated families).   Among these patients there were 37 different mutations in the  CYP27 A1 
gene: 16 were missense mutations; 3 were deletions; 1 was an insertion; 8 were splice site 
mutations; 6 were nonsense mutations; and 3 mutations were in the last nucleotides of exons.  
Fifteen of the 37 mutations (41%) were located in the region of exons 6-8 of the CYP27 A1 gene.  
Striking phenotypic heterogeneity was observed, even within families.   A genotype -phenotype 
correlation analysis was done for 79 homozygous patients from 45 families harboring 
23 different mutations, but no genotype -phenotyp e correlation could be established.  The authors 
concluded that a given mutation may result in the same or different CTX phenotypes, and that 
mutations at different sites of the CYP27 A1 gene may likewise result in the same or different 
phenotypes.  
Symptoms of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis  
CTX is typically a highly progressive disease, with case reports of symptom s that first appear  at 
any time from birth through adulthood  and then worsen  over time .  There are a wide variety of 
clinical symptoms and c onsiderable morbidity in CTX patients, with disabling effects in many 
body systems and a high burden of illness.  The most common manifestations reported are gait 
 Page  10 
Clinical Protocol Number 018CTXX15001   
 
 
RETROPHIN  FINAL : 13 DECEMBER 2016  
PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   
 disturbance, cataracts, decreased intelligence, dementia, impaired reflexes, pyramidal and 
cerebellar signs, dysarthria, epilepsy, neuropathy, ataxia, muscle atrophy, foot deformities, 
chronic diarrhea, and xanthomas, particularly of the Achilles tendon .  Psychiatric, nervous 
system, and musculoskeletal manifestations predominate .[3, 4]   The natural history of CTX has  
not been thoroughly  studied, but case reports for several hundred patients have been published.  
Based on these case reports and the published review articles about CTX, the symptoms that 
occur earliest in children with CTX are chronic diarrhea, developme ntal delay, behavioral 
disorders, seizures , and cataracts.   
Prevalence of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis  
Published articles generally state that the actual prevalence of CTX is unknown, with many 
patients thought to be unidentified ; but the prevalence is widely assumed to be rare.  Three 
publications have presented attempts to estimate the prevalence of CTX in specific ethnic 
groups.  
Berginer and Abeliovich  [5] noted that there had been 6 individuals from 3 Jewish families of 
Moroccan origin diagnosed with CTX over a 5 -year period in th e Beer -Sheba region of Israel.  
Because approximately 70,000 Jews of Moroccan origin lived in this region, the authors reported 
a CTX frequency of 6/70,000 for this community.  Whether this represents a good estimate of 
prevalence for this ethnic group gen erally or how it compares to prevalence in other ethnic 
groups is not known.  
Lorincz  et al [6] used a genetic analysis of a CTX patient with German -English ancestry with 
consanguineous parents (second cousins) and her family members to estimate the prevalence of 
CTX.  Molecular genetic analysis was performed using DNA extracted from peripheral blood 
leukocytes of the patient, her family members, and 115 white volunteer controls of European 
ancestry.  The CYP27 A1 exon from each sample was amplified by polymerase ch ain reaction.  
Sequencing of the amplified DNA resulted in the identification of a single homozygous 
substitution of thymidine for cytosine at complementary DNA position 1384 for the patient.  
Sequence analysis of DNA from both parents showed that they wer e both heterozygous, 
cytosine/ thymidine, at the same position.  Unexpectedly, one control patient  who was 
heterozygous for the same mutation at  position 1384 was identified .  Haplotype analysis of DNA 
from the heterozygous control patient  was not performe d, but there was no known familial 
relationship to the patient.  The observed frequency of the mutation calculated for the control 
group was 8.7 x 10-3.  The prevalence of CTX due to this one homozygous mutation was 
 Page  11 
Clinical Protocol Number 018CTXX15001   
 
 
RETROPHIN  FINAL : 13 DECEMBER 2016  
PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   
 estimated at 1.9 per 100,000.  The overa ll prevalence of CTX due to all known mutations was 
estimated to be “several -fold” higher, approximately 3 to 5 per 100,000.   
Pilo-de-la-Fuente e t al [7] reported on data for all patients diagnos ed with CTX between 1992 
and 2008 at any of the main reference centers for genetic diagnosis of CTX in Spain.   CTX 
diagnosis was based on clinical features and mutational analysis with one exception, a patient 
diagnosed in 1992 for whom DNA was not availab le.  Twenty -five CTX patients, from 
19 families were identified.  The authors estimated a minimum prevalence of 1/1,800,000 
individuals in Spain.    
Diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis  
Suspicion of CTX is typically based on clinical symptoms, most o ften including chronic diarrhea 
with infantile onset, bilateral cataracts in children , and the appearance of x anthomas on the 
Achilles tendons , extensor tendons of the elbows and hands  or patellar tendons, often by the third 
decade of life. [8]  Biochemi cal abnormalities that indicate likely CTX are elevated bile and 
plasma cholestanol levels, increased ratio of serum cholestanol/cholesterol, increased urinary 
excretion of bile alcohol glucuronides and diminished biliary concentrations of 
chenodeoxycholic  acid (CDCA). [9, 10]   In clinical practice, elevated plasma cholestanol and 
urine bile alcohol  are used as tests for probable CTX, with the diagnosis confirmed by a finding 
of mutation in the CY 27 A1 gene on chromosome 2q35 -qter.[8, 11]  
Treatment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis  
CDCA  has long been  considered to be  the standard of care for the condition.  CDCA treatment  is 
effective in preventing ad verse clinical manifestations of the disease from occurring or 
progressing if the treatment is administered early enough. [12]  Though the extent  of published 
evidence is limited, available  clinical studies and case reports suggest that the ability of CDCA 
treatment to reverse existing adverse clinical manifestations is mixed, with some manifestations 
being at least partially reversed and others stabilizing .  Initiation of CDCA treatment as early as 
possible  is universally recommended by expe rts, before irreve rsible damage has occurred. [13]  
There are also published reports of cholic  acid being used  instead of CDCA. [14, 15 , 27] 
Recently, cholic acid has been approved for the treatment of bile acid synthesis disorders, 
including CTX  [27]. 
Other treatments that have  been  reported to be combined with CDCA treatment in clinical 
practice are: Vitamin D, Vitamin E, anti-seizure medications, L-dopa -carbidopa, anti-psychotic 
medications , anxiolytics, anti -depressants and statins. [16-23]  In a small number of reported 
 Page  12 
Clinical Protocol Number 018CTXX15001   
 
 
RETROPHIN  FINAL : 13 DECEMBER 2016  
PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   
 cases, statins were given without CDCA. [22, 24]   Apheresis treatment has also reported in a 
small number of cases, in combination with CDCA or alone .[7, 25, 26]  
Because idiopathic bilateral cataracts  occur at an early age in many children with CTX, 
biomarker testing of these children  presents a n opportunity for diagnosing children with CTX .  
Since initiation of treatment as early as possible may prevent or reverse t he development of 
debilitating symptoms of CTX, the opportunity to use contact with health care providers in 
connection with pediatric cataract evaluation and treatment  is a promising avenue for disease 
detection and prevention .[12] 
3.1 Summary of Potential Risks  
This is a n observational study with no drugs or treatments that could have associated risks.   
Drawing blood for diagnostic testing by venipuncture is an invasive procedure that may 
occasionally be associated with adverse events such as pain, bleeding, syncope, ecchymosis  or 
infection .  
3.2 Summary of Potential Benefits  
Patient s in this study will not experience personal benefits from study participation in this non -
treatment, prevalence study.  However, patient s with CTX who are identified through 
participation in the study may seek medical care for CTX as a result of the diagnosis made 
during study participation.   Study participants who test positive for CTX will be informed of the 
diagn osis by the Investigator and advised to seek appropriate medical evaluation and care.

5.1 Endpoints  
5.1.1 Efficacy  Endpoints  
This study has no treatments and no efficacy endpoints.  
5.1.2 Safety Endpoints  
Only serious adverse events (SAEs) associated with study procedures ( i.e., a blood draw) will be 
recorded.  
5.1.3 Other Endpoints  
CTX  testing will be done using plasma cholestanol and urine bile alcohol levels (if urine sample 
is provided ) for all study participants.  Genetic testing for mutations associated with CTX will be 
done for all study participants with elevated plasma cholestan ol levels  or positive urine bile 
alcohol results  (if urine sample is provided ).  Genetic testing will be performed at a Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) certified laboratory. The results of test ing for 
plasma cholestanol  and urine bile alcohol  (if urine sample is provided ), and genetic testing (when 
indicated)  will be reported to the Investigator at each clinical site .  The results of plasma total 
cholesterol ( fasting or nonfasting , if > 190 mg/dL) may also be reported to the Investigator.  
Samples will be retained on ly for the duration of testing of plasma cholestanol , urine bile alcohol 
(if urine sample is provided), plasma total cholesterol (if applicable) and genetic testing ( when 
indicated).  Samples will not be used for future, presently unidentified research.   
5.2 Study Design  
This is an observational, multicenter study to determine the prevalence of CTX  in patient 
populations diagnosed or treated for early -onset idiopathic bilateral cataracts, identified through 
a chart review of patients who were seen at each study site prior to that site’s initiation or by 
entering care at the site while the site is participating in the trial .  
5.2.1 Site of Study Procedures  
Study pro cedures may be completed at investigational sites, either during a visit for the clinical 
study , or in conjunction with other scheduled visits  separate from the clinical study.  
Alternatively, study procedures may be completed dur ing a visit at an alternat e location (such as  
but not limited to a  home, daycare or workplace) provided by personnel from  a home  health care 
company licensed and authorized to perform these procedures.

Completion  
5.2.2.1  Completion of a Patient’s Participation in the Study  
Participation in the study is limited to one or more study visit(s) for collection of study data, 
including a blood draw and urine sample  (if provided) .  These procedures will typically be 
completed in a single visit, but additional visit s are permitted if a blood sample is not obtained or 
a replacement blood sample is required for any reason.  The blood draw and urine sample (if 
provided) may be collected in conjunction with other  scheduled treatments  separate from the 
clinical study.   The length of a patient ’s participation will be from the time the informed consent 
form is signed until results of the CTX testing have been obtained  and reported  to the patient .  
Study participation  for patients who have normal test results for plasma cholestanol and urine 
bile alcohol  (if urine sample is  provided ) will be complete after reporting of these test results to 
the patient .  Study participation for patients who require genetic testing will  be complete after 
reporting of these test results  to the patient .  The Investigator will contact the patient to share the 
results of the  plasma cholestanol, urine bile alcohol , plasma total cholesterol  (if applicable)  and 
genetic testing for example, via a follow -up phone call.  For those participants who require 
genetic testing , the Investigator will provide a referral  for appropriate follow -up care, if clinically 
indicated , to the patient or patient’s parent or guardian .  Genetic counseling will not be provided 
per the  study.   
5.2.2.2  Premature Patient  Discontinuation  from the Study  
Patient s are free to withdraw consent and/or discontinue participation in the study at any time, 
without prejudice to further treatment.  A patient ’s participation in the study may also be 
discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor.  
5.2.2.3  Overall Study Completion  
The study will be considered to be complete when CTX testing , including cholestanol , urine bile 
alcohol  (if urine sample is provided ) and genetic testing  (if indicated) , has been completed and 
recorded for all patient s, and patients have been informed of the testing results . 
5.3 Discussion of Study Design  
This is an observational, multicenter study to determine the prevalence of CTX  in patient 
populations diagnosed or treated for early -onset idiopathic bilateral cataracts .  The number of 
patient s to be enrolled in this study is considered appropriate for su ch a study.  Because this is an 
observational study, no power calculation has been performed.

 9 ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING  
9.1 Adverse Event  
For the purpose of this protocol, the following definitions and re porting requirements will apply:  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the performance of a 
study procedure in a clinical investigation patient . 
AEs may include:  
 Symptoms described by the patient  
 Clinically significant ch anges in the patient’s physical exam or other signs observed 
by the Investigator or medical staff  
Definition of a Pro cedure -related AE : 
A pro cedure -related AE is an AE occurring during a clinical study that is considered by the 
Investigator or the Medical Monitor (or designee) to be related to a research procedure  (i.e., 
related to the fact that a patient is undergo ing a procedure in the study).  For  example, a 
procedure -related AE may be an untoward event related to a medical procedure required by the 
protocol  (i.e.,a blood draw, in the case of this study) . 
Only serious pro cedure -related adverse events will be recorded.   
9.2 Serious Adverse Event   
A serious adverse event ( SAE ) is an AE that results in any of the following:  
 Death :  The patient died as the result of the event.  
 Is life-threatening :  An AE that places the patient, in the view of the Investigator  or 
Sponsor , at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred, i.e.,  does not include an 
AE that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 Require s in-patient  hospitalization or prolong ation of an existing hospitalization    
 Persistent or significant disability/incapaci ty:  An AE that results in a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect :  A congenital anomaly/birth defect that occurs in the 
offspring of a patient exposed to the study procedure . 
 Page  21 
Clinical Protocol Number 018CTXX15001   
 
 
RETROPHIN  FINAL : 13 DECEMBER 2016  
PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   
  Other Medically Important Serious M edical events :  An AE that may not result in death, 
be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the patient or patient  may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
9.3 Evaluation of A dverse Events/Serious Adverse Events 
SAEs will be assessed by the Investigator.   Only SAEs determined by the Investigator to be 
possibly related or related to study procedure s will be recorded .  Any study -procedure -related or 
possibly -related SAEs ongoing after the Screening/Baseline visit will be followed until 
resolution.    
9.3.1 Causality Assessment  
For each SAE the Investigator must determine whether, based on available evidence, there is a 
reasonable possibility that the study procedure  caused the event.  Causal relationship will be 
classified according to the following criteria:  
 Not Related :  There is no suspicion of a causal relationship between the procedure  
and the AE.  
 Unlikely Related :  There is no evidence for a causal relationship between the 
procedure and the AE; however, such a relationship cannot be ruled out.  
 Possibly Related :  There is some evidence supporting the possibility of a causal 
relationship between the procedure and the AE.  
 Related : There is strong evidence that there is a causal relationship between the 
procedure and the AE.  
 
A causality assessment must be provided for each SAE recorded even if there is only limited 
information at the time.  
Upon receipt of follow -up information, t he Investigator may change his/her assessment of 
causality  and amend the SAE report accordingly.

RETROPHIN  FINAL : 13 DECEMBER 2016  
PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   
 9.3.2 Severity   
Severity indicates the intensity of the event and should not be confused with seriousness (i.e., 
Section 9.2), which is an event outcome applied for  the purpose of event classification and 
regulatory reporting.  
Severity Grading  
The Investigator will assess the severity of all study -procedure -related SAEs as Mild, Moderate, 
or Severe, based on the following definitions .  
Definitions:  
 Mild :  A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention.  The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of 
daily living.  
 Moderate :  A type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific ther apeutic 
intervention.  The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort, but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research participant.  
 Severe :  A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, o r significantly 
affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
 
9.3.3 Outcome  
Outcome describes the status of the SAE. 
The Investigator will provide information regarding the patient outcome of each SAE  that is 
judged to be possibly related or related to a study  procedure . 
Definitions  for possible results of an SAE outcome:  
 Recovered/Resolved:   the event has improved or recuperated  
 Recovering/Resolving:   the event is improving  
 Not Recovered/Not Resolved :  the event has not improved or recuperated  
 Recovered/Resolved with sequelae :  the patient  recuperated but retained pathological 
conditions resulting from the prior disease or injury

RETROPHIN  FINAL : 13 DECEMBER 2016  
PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   
  Fatal :  termination of life as a result of an adverse event ; there should be only one AE 
marked with t his outcome  
 Unknown :  not known, not ob served, not recorded or refused  
 
9.3.4 Action Taken  Regarding the Investigational  Product  
Not applicable . 
9.4 Reporting Serious Study -Procedure -Related Adverse Events  
9.4.1 Initial Reporting  of Serious Study -Procedure -Related Adverse Events 
Study -procedure -related or possibly related SAEs should be recorded using appropriate medical 
terminology.  When recording, it is preferable to provide a diagnosis.  In the absence of a 
diagnosis, each sign and symptom should be captured as a  unique SAE.  Sufficient information 
should be sought to assist the Investigator both in determining the diagnosis and in ma king a 
causality assessment.   
The necessity and time requirements for reporting of study -procedure -related or possibly related 
SAEs  to the Sponsor or its designee and/or regulatory agencies are as follows:  
 All SAEs related or possibly related to study procedures must be reported to the 
Sponsor or designee  within 24 hours  of the Investigator’s first knowledge of the 
event .    
 A complet ed Clinical Study SAE Report Form containing a detailed written 
description of the event along with available supporting documents (e.g.,  discharge 
summary , autopsy report, diagnostic test results, etc. ) should be provided by fax or 
e-mail to the following address:

RETROPHIN  FINAL : 13 DECEMBER 2016  
PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL   
  Additional  information  that is not  available at the time the initial SAE Report Form 
was completed, must be promptly reviewed and provided to the Sponsor within 48 
hours of receipt.   Full supporting documentation should be solicited by the 
investigative site even if the SAE occurred at another institution.  Such 
documentation may include copies of relevant patient/hospital records, discharge 
summaries, laboratory/test results or autopsy reports.  
 If, at any time after the patient has completed participation in the study (as defined in 
Section  5.2.2.1 ), the Investigator or s tudy staff becomes aware of an SAE that they 
suspect is related to the study procedures  (see Section  9.3.1 ), then the event and any 
known details mu st be reported promptly to the Sponsor or its designee , follow ing the 
reporting instructions in Section 9.4.3 . 
 
9.4.2 Follow -Up of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs related or possibly related to study procedure s will be followed until resolution, the 
condition stabilizes, or the Investigator and Sponsor agree that follow up is no longer necessary.    
Rules for SAE follow up apply to all patients, to the extent al lowed by the patient’s consent.  The 
Investigator will ensure that follow up includes further investigations consistent with appropriate 
medical management to understand the nature and/or causality of the SAE.   The 
Sponsor/designee, or regulatory authorit ies may also request additional information regarding an 
SAE at any time.  
All follow -up information must be promptly reviewed by the Investigator and provided to the 
Sponsor within the specified timelines.  Additional  procedure -related SAEs may be identifie d 
during the review of follow -up information  and should be processed in accordance with 
requirements defined throughout Section 10.  
9.4.3 Reporting to Regulatory Authorities, Investigators and IRB/IECs  
The Sponsor will ensure that processe s are in place for provision of study -procedure -related or 
possibly related SAE reports to Investigators and institutional review boards ( IRBs )/institutional 
ethics committees ( IECs ) as required , within  the specified  timelines .   
The Sponsor or its designe e will submit  study procedure -related or possibly related SAE  reports 
to the Investigator  as required .  In the US , Investigators  will report study procedure -related or 
possibly related SAEs to their IRB in accordance with applicable standard operating proc edures

enrolled into the study have the correct PMM diagnosis prior 
to randomization. T he structure, function and operation of the 
PSOC  will be detailed in the REN001-201 PSOC Charter. 
An independently chaired Safety Review Committee (SRC) 
will review safety data at specified intervals for the duration of the study. 
The structure, function and operation of the SRC 
will be detailed in the REN001 -201 SRC Charter. 
An exploratory sub -study (REN001-201-DXA) to assess 
change in the bone mineral de nsity using Dual Energy X- ray 
Absorptiometry (DXA) scans after 24 weeks of treatment 
with REN001 is open to subjects at sites where regulatory and ethical approval is in place.

Page 9 of 93 product administration or may interfere with the 
interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, and in discussion with the Medical Monitor, 
would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this 
study. 
Study Visits: There will be a total of 8 visits for each subject. 
Each subject who provides informed consent will complete 
screening activities to confirm eligibility to enter the study. The Screening Visit (Visit 1) must be completed no more than 
8 weeks prior to the start of dosing and will take place at 
the Study Center. There must be a mini mum of 4 weeks 
between the Screening 12MWT and the Baseline 12MWT. If 
laboratory tests are outside of the normal range at initial 
screening, tests may be repeated once (this can be done as a 
home nurse visit). Where possible subjects should be pre -
screened  to assess the requirement for genotyping. The 
Screening Visit may be accomplished over more than 1 day. 
Subjects who are receiving prohibited medications must suspend the medications
 if this can safely and appropriately 
be done and have sufficient washout during the screening 
period (See  Table 1 ) prior to randomization. Re- screening of 
subjects is allowed only once and requires prior approval by 
the Sponsor , for instance, if the wash- out of prior medications 
or genotyping is longer than 6-8 weeks. Re- screened subjects 
will not be required to have either the eye exam or DXA scan 
(REN001 -201 DXA sub-study subjects) repeated within 6 
months of the original asses sments. Where a Study Center 
requires it, subjects may be asked to have a negative COVID-
19 test prior to undertaking scheduled visits at the Study Cent
er. 
The PSOC will assess if subjects have the correct diagnosis of 
PMM for the study prior to randomization. 
Subjects who successfully complete screening , and are 
approved by the PSOC , will undergo a Baseline Visit (Visit 
2) which may be completed over two days if required. Once 
the Baseline assessments have been completed subjects will 
be randomized 1:1 to receive oral REN001 , 100 mg or 
placebo once daily  with food for 24 weeks.  
In centers where the Regulatory Authority and the Ethics 
Committee /Institutional Review Board and Institution allows 
Visit 3 (Week 2), Visit 4 (Week 4) , Visit 6 (Week 18) and 
Visit 8 ( Follow Up) may be conducted either in the Study 
Center or at the subject’s home using a home nursing service.  
Visit 5 (Week 12) and Visit 7 (W eek 24) will be completed in 
the Study Center  and which may be completed over two days 
if required. A Follow Up Visit (Visit 8) will be performed, 
which can be carried out either in the Study Center or at the 
Reneo Pharma Ltd. Confidential Clinical Study Protocol 
REN001-201 Version 4.0 Global 24 June 2022 
Page 10 of 93 subject’s home. Visit 8 will be completed 21 -28 days after the 
last dos e of study medication. This visit will not be required if 
a subject chooses to enter the REN001 open label extension 
study (REN001 -202) at their Week 24 visit; applicable only 
for countries where the open label extension study is being 
conducted.  
A qualified nurse will carry out all the required study 
assessments for Home Visits. A dditional Home Visits instead 
of Study Center visits , or delays to Visits beyond the stated 
visit windows , may be allowed in some circumstances e.g. 
global pandemic , with the Sponsor ’s prior approval. 
A specialist concierge service will be available to subjects to 
arrange hotel accommodation and transport to and from Study 
Center visits and reimburse any subject study expenses.  
The planned maximum study duration for each subject in the 
study will be 36 weeks (assuming 8 weeks screening, 24 
weeks treatment and 4 weeks follow up) . 
Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic and exploratory 
assessments are detailed in the study  Schedule of Activities 
(Table 2).  
Statistical Methods: On the basis of preliminary results of an open-label pilot 
study (REN001 -101) involving 17 subjects with PMM who 
received REN001 100 mg/day for 12 weeks, a mean 
improvement of 94 meters was observed in the 12MWT. 
A sample size of 186 subjects (93 per treat ment group) 
provides 90% power, with a two -sided significance level of 
5%, of obtaining a statistically significant difference between 
two treatment groups in distance walked during the 12MW T. 
This assumes a treatment effect  (difference to placebo in 
mean change from baseline) size of 60 meters. The standard 
deviation for the changes from baseline observed in Study REN001
-101 was approximately 100 meters. A higher 
standard deviation, 125 meters, has been assumed for this 
study due to the longer assessment period (24 weeks instead of 12 weeks)
 and the increased number of centers 
participating in the study . Allowing for a reduction in power 
due to subject withdrawals a total of approximately 200 
subjects will be randomized.  
To control the Type 1 error rate a f ixed sequence testing 
procedure will be adopted. The order of testing will be:  
1. Change from Baseline at Week 24 in distance walked 
during the 12MWT  
2. Change from Baseline at Week 24 in the MFIS 
Physical subscale score   
Reneo Pharma Ltd. Confidential Clinical Study Protocol 
REN001-201 Version 4.0 Global 24 June 2022 
Page 11 of 93 3. PGIC score (muscle symptoms) at the end of 
treatment 
The primary population for efficacy will be the full analysis 
set (FAS), defined as all subjects randomized, who receive at least one dose of study treatment. Subjects in this population will be analyzed by assigned treatment.
 
The change from baseline in distance walked during the 
12MW T will be analyzed using a mixed effects model for 
repeated measures (MMRM).  The model will include fixed 
terms for treatment, visit and the treatment  by visit 
interaction. The model will also include the stratification 
mutation factor and c ontinuous baseline distance walked 
during the 12MWT as covariates. An unstructured covariance 
structure will be used  for the repeated visits within a subject. 
The treat ment comparison (REN001 100 mg vs placebo) for 
the change from baseline at Week 24 will be estimated. The 
estimate, standard error, 95% confidence intervals and 
associated p -values will be presented.   
Treatment comparisons will also be made at Week 12.  
The primary endpoint will also be analyzed for a per protocol 
population; defined as those subjects in the FAS population who have not violated inclusion or exclusion criteria and/or deviated from the protocol, in a way that could influence their efficacy ass
essment. 
The MFIS Physical subscale score changes from baseline will 
be analyzed using a MMRM. The model will include fixed 
terms for treatment, visit and the treatment  by visit 
interaction. The model will also include the stratification 
mutation factor, continuous baseline MFIS Physical subscale score and continuous baseline distance walked during the 12MW
T as covariates. An unstructured covariance structure 
will be used . The treatment comparison for the change from 
baseline at each visit will be estimated . The estimates, 
standard errors, 95% confidence intervals and associated p-
values will be presented for each visit . The primary 
comparison is at Week 24. 
The PGIC  (muscle symptom) data will be converted to a 
numerical scale from 3 (very much improved) to -3 (very 
much worse); hence a value of 0 would signify no change. 
This score will then be analyzed using analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA), using a fixed term for treatment and the mutation stratification factor and continuous baseline distance 
walked during
 the 12MWT as covariates. The treatment 
comparison (REN001  vs placebo) will be estimated, along 
with its standard error, 95% confidence interval and associated p
-value.

Page 12 of 93 Safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Population, 
defined as all subjects who  are randomized and receive at 
least one dose of study drug. Subjects will be analyzed by the treatment received.
 
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be 
summarized by treatment group and by System Organ Class 
(SOC) and Preferred Term, in accorda nce with the MedDRA 
coding dictionary. The number of subjects reporting each AE preferred term will be tabulated for all TEAEs and separately for those considered as 
at least possibly related to study 
treatment by the Investigator. Number of subjects reporting 
serious a dverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of special 
interest (AESI) will also be tabulated. 
Observed values and changes from baseline in clinical 
laboratory tests , vital signs, ECG data and eye examination 
data will be summarized using descriptive statistics by 
treatment group and visit.  
Plasma concentrations of REN001 will be summarized over 
time using descriptive statistics for Day 1, Week 12 and Week 24. These data will also be included in a population PK analysis.

1.1 Indication 
Primary mitochondrial myopathies are genetic di sorders associated with pathogenic variants 
in the mitochondrial or nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that primarily lead to a) 
oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) dysfunction or other disturbances of mitochondrial 
structure and function and b) predominantly, but not  exclusively, affect skeletal muscle, with 
motor function deficits affecting endurance not better explained by other systemic or 
neurological conditions ( Parikh et al 2014 ; Mancuso et al 2017 ). In patients with 
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations, inheritan ce and clinical presentation are further 
complicated by the presence of multiple mtDNA genomes in an individual cell leading to a 
mixture of mutated and wild-type genomes (heteroplasmy) in the same cell or tissue.  
Onset of PMM can occur at any age, although typically the more severe phenotypes present 
earlier in life, and milder phenotypes present  later in life. One of the challenges of 
mitochondrial diseases is the marked clinical variation seen in patients, which can delay diagnosis. Because mitochondria are the main source of energy production in mammalian cells, clinical features typically involve the tissues with the highest energy requirements. Furthermore, the presence of mtDNA in all human tissues means that dysfunction occurs in multiple organ systems. The most commonly affected organ systems are the nervous, muscular, cardiac and endocrine systems. I ndividuals with PMM often present with a 
constellation of clinical features that may be compatible with a discrete clinical syndrome. However, categorizing patients into syndromes is of limited value, as the majority of patients do not fit into discrete categories ( Gorman et al, 2016 ). PMMs are usually progressive 
conditions which produce significant disability and, in some instances, premature death. 
The molecular genetic investigation of suspected mitochondrial disease can be complex, and 
has to be guided by previous clinical, histoc hemical and biochemical findings. Definitive 
diagnostic confirmation now relies on genetic testing and the identification of a pathogenic 
mutation in a recognized mitochondrial gene.  
The management of patients with mitochondrial di seases is focused on strategies to reduce 
morbidity and mortality and early treatment of organ-specific complications. Several agents 
(mostly nutritional supplements) have been investigated in double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. These include carnitine, creatine, Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), cysteine, dichloroacetate, 
dimethylglycine, and the combination of creatine and lipoic acid. No agent or combination regimen has demonstrated efficacy in clinical disease endpoints ( Pfeffer & Chinnery, 2013 ). 
PMMs represent an area of significant unmet medical need; there is currently no available 
disease -modifying therapy for patients with PMM.  
1.2 Background  
Full details of the REN001 chemistry, non-clinical and clinical data can be found in the 
current Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.3 Study Rationale 
There is a strong rationale for the use of REN001, a selective PPAR δ agonist, in patients with 
PMM. The PPAR δ receptor is a nuclear receptor primarily found in skeletal muscle. Patients 
with PMM caused by genetic mutations in the mitochondrial genome have impaired oxidative 
phosphorylation. Selective PPAR agonists may amel iorate the cellular energy deficit in 
patients with these mutations by: 
x Increasing fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and OXPHOS activity resulting in enhanced 
mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generating capacity;  
Reneo Pharma Ltd. Confidential Clinical Study Protocol 
REN001-201 Version 4.0 Global 24 June 2022 
Page 23 of 93 x Increasing the proportion of wild-type mi tochondria. Although mitochondrial disease 
induced mitochondrial proliferation may favor mutated mitochondria, 
pharmacological upregulation of mitochondrial biosynthesis increases the number of both mutated and wild-type mitochondria, which allows wild-type mitochondria to compensate for mutant mitochondria; and, 
x Increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and thereby increasing residual OXPHOS activity, which would enhance the cellular ATP synthesis capacity. 
1.4 Risk-Benefit Assessment 
Benefits 
In the open-label Phase 1b study (REN001-101) in subjects with PMM, oral REN001 dosed at 100 mg per day was safe and well tolerated for 12 weeks (Part A) and up to an additional 24 weeks in the subjects who continued into an extension part of the study (Part B). Following 12 weeks of dosing, the majority of patients with PMM experienced improvement 
in the outcome measures of distance walked in the 12MWT and symptoms of fatigue and 
pain evaluated with questionnaires. 
Risks 
Elevated creatine phosphokinase  Subjects with PMM may be found to have as ymptomatic benign raised baseline creatine 
phosphokinase (CK) levels as part of the PMM disease, and even among healthy individuals 
CK levels transiently rise after exercise or heavy manual labor. In patients with PMM serum CK levels may increase to as much as 30 times the ULN within 24 hours of strenuous physical activity, then slowly decline over the next 7 days. The degree of CK elevation depends on the type and duration of exercise, with greater elevation in those who are untrained ( Moghadam-Kia, Oddis, & Aggarwal, 2016 ). It is possible that improvements in 
the cellular energy deficit with REN001 treatment may result in increased muscle use and 
transient benign muscle enzyme elevations. 
Serum CK data from subjects with PMM in  the Phase 1b study (REN001-101) demonstrated 
a pattern of transient, elevated CKs following exercise and the collection of muscle biopsies; 
none of these elevations were associated with my oglobinuria. The elevations seen were self-
limiting and resolved with no intervention despite continued treatment with REN001 and 
continuation of the subject’s normal activit ies of daily living including exercise . In all the 
clinical trials that have included REN001 to date,  elevations in CK tended to be modest and 
reversible and were usually determined by investigators as unlikely to be associated with 
REN001 treatment. In the current study CK level s will be assessed throughout the study with 
particular emphasis at Baseline and Week 2, ba sed on the expected (asymptomatic) increases 
in CK previously observed in subjects with PMM following exercise testing. 
Cataract formation 
A single-species finding of cataract was observed in a high dose 6-month rat chronic 
toxicology study. Importantly, no cataracts were observed in any other toxicology studies, including in a 3-month rat study and a 12-mont h primate study. It is anticipated that the 
changes observed in the 6-month rat study are rat strain specific. Nevertheless, following this 
observation, taking a conservative approach, opht halmology examinations were included in 
all REN001 trials. Slit lamp eye examinations will be conducted together with assessments of 
best corrected visual acuity at Screen ing and Weeks 12 and 24 in this study.  
Potential Drug-Drug Interactions 
Reneo Pharma Ltd. Confidential Clinical Study Protocol 
REN001-201 Version 4.0 Global 24 June 2022 
Page 24 of 93 REN001 is not a direct or time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4. However, REN001 has been 
shown to be a weak inducer of CYP3A4 in vitro. A potential for drug interactions between 
REN001 and drugs that are metabolized through the CYP3A4 is considered low but cannot 
be ruled out. Therefore, drugs that are metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and have a narrow therapeutic index should be administered with  caution in subjects participating in REN001 
studies. 
REN001 was identified as a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate in vitro . Strong P-gp inhibitors 
may have an impact on the absorption and metabolism of a P-gp substrate, however 
preliminary human metabolism for REN001 i ndicates numerous metabolic pathways are 
involved in the clearance of REN001. Therefore, it is unlikely that co-administration of a 
strong P-gp inhibitor with REN001 will result in higher systemic exposures of REN001. Co-administration of REN001 with a strong P-gp inducer may reduce REN001 plasma concentrations. 
Fertility and Contraception 
In accordance with the latest European regulatory discussions and guidelines ( Clinical Trials 
Facilitation Group, 2014 and 2020), WOCBP are eligible for the study provided they are 
using a highly effective form of contraception from Screening, while taking the study drug 
and for 30 days after stopping study drug (at least one menstrual cycle after drug exposure). Serum pregnancy testing will be completed at Screening and urine pregnancy tests will be 
carried out monthly thereafter and at Follow Up. 
Fertile men (i.e., unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy) must use a condom 
during intercourse with a WOCBP from Baseline  through to at least 14 weeks after stopping 
study drug (at least one sperm cycle after drug exposure) and should not father a child in this 
period. A condom is also required to be used by vasectomized men to prevent delivery of the 
drug via seminal fluid.  
As REN001 is a weak inducer of CYP3A4 in vitro , caution is advised when co-administering 
REN001 and oral contraceptive agents. Therefore, as a precautionary measure, women 
receiving highly effective hormonal contraception therapy will be advised to use an additional effective non-hormonal method of c ontraception during treatment with REN001 
and for 30 days after the final dose. Women using a highly effective non-hormonal 
contraception method (i.e., intrauterine device) wi ll not be required to use additional methods 
of contraception. 
Carcinogenicity Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been in itiated with REN001 in rats and mice. Animal 
carcinogenicity data in rodents suggest that some, but not all, PPAR agonists have 
carcinogenicity potential. The mechanism by  which these compounds produce tumors in 
rodents is not well understood and the possibility that the rodent carcinogenicity findings may be relevant to humans cannot be ruled out at this time. Subjects with a history of cancer, 
except in situ basal cell carcinoma in the skin, will  not be allowed to participate in the study.  
Bone  
a) Nonclinical finding of premature bone plate closure in rats.  
This finding has not been replicated in non-human primates. As a precaution, subjects under 
25 years of age in studies with REN001 over 12 weeks duration will have a wrist x-ray prior 
to enrolment to confirm skeletal maturity. 
b) Bone turnover 
Reneo Pharma Ltd. Confidential Clinical Study Protocol 
REN001-201 Version 4.0 Global 24 June 2022 
Page 25 of 93 Currently, it is not known if REN001 (a selective PPAR δ agonist ) will have any impact on 
bone mineral density. Nonetheless, given the study requirements for walk tests and taking a 
highly conservative approach, the Sponsor has excluded subjects with a history of fragility/stress fractures or an osteoporosis concomitant condition which has not been addressed, and will monitor markers of bone t urnover during the study. Any reports of bone 
fracture will be captured as adverse events of special interest. 
Safety Review Committee 
The ongoing safety of study subjects will be reviewed by the Medical Monitor and study site 
physicians as data are received. In addition, safe ty data will be reviewed by an independently 
chaired Safety Review Committee (SRC). See Section 3.11 . 
Conclusion 
In conclusion, the safety profile of REN001 suppo rts further development in clinical studies 
subject to appropriate subject se lection and safety monitoring.  
1.5 Dose Selection Rationale 
To date, a total of 162 subjects have been enrolled and 106 subjects received REN001 in four 
clinical trials (HPP593-101 (single dose, healthy volunteers); HPP593-102 (14 day, repeat dose study in obese moderately dyslipidemic subjects; HPP593-103, (28 day, healthy volunteer pharmacodynamic study in induced muscle atrophy); REN001-101, (up to 40 weeks, repeat dose in PMM subjects)). In the single dose study, doses ranged from 25 mg to 250 mg, doses in the 14-day study ranged from 50 mg to 200 mg QD or 100 mg BID, in the 28-day study the dose was 100 mg BID and in the 48-week study the dose was 100 mg QD. Overall, REN001 was considered safe and well tolerated in all four clinical studies. No treatment related SAEs were reported. No clinically significant abnormalities were observed in any safety parameters including vital signs, ECGs, and physical exams. 
In study REN001-101, in subjects with PMM, th e majority of subjects dosed for at least 12 
weeks showed improvements in distance walked at Week 12 compared to Baseline, and also 
reported a reduction in muscle related symptoms  and fatigue. Pharmacological activity of 
REN001 at 100 mg per day was also shown in Phase 1 studies in other indications (see 
current Investigator’s Brochure  for details).  
The safety and the pharmacodynamic effects observed in these studies support the 100 mg 
QD dose level in this Phase 2b study.

Page 27 of 93 3 OVERALL DESIGN AND PLAN OF THE STUDY 
3.1 Overview 
There will be a total of 8 visits for each subject. 
Each subject who provides informed consent will  complete screening activities to confirm 
eligibility to enter the study. The Screening Visit (Visit 1) must be completed no more than 8 
weeks prior to the start of dosing and will take place at the Study Center. There must be a minimum of 4 weeks between the Screening 12MWT and the Baseline 12MWT. If laboratory tests are outside of the normal range at initial screening, tests may be repeated once (this can be done as a home nurse visit). Where possible s ubjects should be pre-screened to assess the 
requirement for genotyping. The Screening Visit may be accomplished over more than 1 day. Subjects who are receiving prohibited medications must suspend the medications, if this can safely and appropriately be done and have su fficient washout during the screening period 
(See Table 1 ) prior to randomization. Re-screening of subjects is allowed only once and 
requires prior approval by the Sponsor, for instan ce, if the wash-out of prior medications or 
genotyping is longer than 6-8 weeks. Re-screened subjects will not be required to have either 
the eye exam or DXA scan (REN001-201 DXA sub-study subjects) repeated within 6 months of the original assessments. Where a Study Center requires it, subjects may be asked to have 
a negative COVID-19 test prior to undertaking scheduled visits at the Study Center. 
The PSOC will assess if subjects have the correct diagnosis of PMM for the study prior to randomization. 
Subjects who successfully complete screening and are approved by the PSOC will undergo a 
Baseline Visit (Visit 2) which may be completed  over two days if required. Once the Baseline 
assessments have been completed subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive oral REN001, 100 mg or placebo once daily for 24 weeks.  
In centers where the Regulatory Authority and the Ethics Committee/IRB and Institution 
allows Visit 3 (Week 2), Visit 4 (Week 4), Visit 6 (Week 18) a nd Visit 8 (Follow Up) may be 
conducted either in the Study Center or at the subject’s home using a home nursing service.  
Visit 5 (Week 12) and Visit 7 (Week 24) will be completed in the Study Center and which 
may be completed over two days if required. 
A Follow Up Visit (Visit 8) will be performed, which can be carried out either in the Study 
Center or at the subject’s home. Visit 8 will be completed 21 -28 days after the last dose of 
study medication. This visit will not be required if a subject chooses to enter the REN001 open label extension study (REN001-202) at their Week 24 visit; applicable only in countries where the open label extension study is being conducted. 
A qualified nurse will carry out all the required  study assessments for home visits. Additional 
home visits instead of Study Center visits, or de lays to visits beyond the stated visit windows, 
may be allowed in some circumstances e.g. global pandemic with the Sponsor ’s prior 
approval. A specialist concierge service will be availa ble to subjects to arrange hotel accommodation 
and transport to and from Study Center visi ts and reimburse any subject study expenses. 
The planned maximum study duration for each subject in the study will be 36 weeks 
(assuming 8 weeks screening, 24 weeks treatment and 4 weeks follow up). See Figure 1 .

3.3 Justification of the Study Design 
There are no specific regulatory guidelines for the design of studies in patients with PMM 
and no approved safe and effective treatments for the disease. This study is primarily 
designed to assess the safety and efficacy of REN001 in patients with PMM caused by mtDNA gene mutations. PMM pre sents with a wide range of phenotypic heterogeneity. To 
address heterogeneity the study will aim to recruit 1) subjects with  mt DNA defects (including the most common point mutation m.3243A>G) and 2) subjects with a primary phenotypic presentation of myopathy. In addi tion, the PSOC will review the screening 
criteria as described above. 
Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive REN001 or a matching placebo for 24 weeks.  
Placebo-controlled studies have been used in this indication previously. A placebo arm as

rsion 4.0G
lobal 24June 2022
Page 30 of 93 comparator has been included to establish the mag nitude of change in endpoin ts that may 
occur spontaneously du ring the treatment period . The use of a placebo is justified as no 
approved therapy is available and international ethical guidelines p ermit the use o f placebo 
controls in randomized trials when ther e are compelling methodolo gical reasons and 
withholdin g treatment does not pose a risk of serious harm to  participants ( Millum & Grad y, 
2013).  
The 24 we ek duration of the stu dy offers the opportu nity to evaluate the lon g-term effects of 
REN0 01 on p hysical endura nce and symptoms associated with PMM . It als o provides a 
longer exposure dura tion to evaluate the safety an d tolerability of the drug in the intended 
treatment population.  
The primary outcome measure of this study is the distance walked in  the 12MWT. Both the 
6-minute walk test (6MWT) and 12MWT have been used in clinical trials and in clinical 
practice. In orde r to demonstrate the effect of REN001 on increasing FAO and OXPHOS, a 
walk test of greater than  6 minutes is required. At th e onset of exercise, the body relies on 
readily available phosp ho-creatine (P-Cr) stored in the cytosol (see Figure 2). P-Cr is quickly 
depleted. For the next 2 -4 minutes of exercise, the body p rimarily  uses glycolytic metabolism 
of glucose derived from s keletal glycog en. The third source of energy is the oxidative 
phosp horylation of fatty acids and carbohydrates that occu rs in the mitochondria and is 
impaired in  patients with PMM.  This process occurs a fter ap proximately 4  minutes of 
exercise onset and co nstitutes the primary source of en ergy for sustained exercise.

Adapted from Human Physiology: An Integrated 
Approach, Sixth Edition (2013) Dee Unglaub 
Silverthorn  
Although, the 6MWT is a good measure to a ssess the submaximal level of functional 
capacity, the 6MWT duration is not sufficient to fully capture the potential benefits on 
physical endurance caused by improvements in mi tochondrial function. In contrast, the self-
paced 12MWT assesses the submaximal level of functional capacity during the period of 
exercise supported by mitochondrial function. A prior clinical trial conducted by the Sponsor 
(REN001-101), showed that subjects with PMM progressively slowed their walking speed 
over the course of the 12MWT, with the greatest decline occurring from minute 6 to minute 9, coinciding with the increased requirement for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation [data on file]. Most patients do not achieve max imal exercise capacity during the test; rather, 
they choose their own intensity of exercise and, if needed, are allowed to stop and rest during the test. This approximates to the activities of  daily living, which are typically performed at 
submaximal levels of exertion for periods of more than 6 minutes.

REN001-201 Version 4.0 Global 24 June 2022 
Page 31 of 93 One limitation of all walk tests is an associated ‘training’ effect whereby subjects may 
improve the distance walked on subsequent tests due to familiarity with the test ( Kierkegaard 
& Tollback, 2007 ). This effect can be seen regardless of the interval duration (weeks to 
months) between tests ( Wu et al, 2003; Prahm et al, 2014 ; Knak et al, 2017 ; Karaa et al, 
2018). Various methods have been used to overcome this effect, such as 1) conducting two 
walk tests on the same day and using the longest distance ( Kierkegaard & Tollback, 2007 ); 2) 
correcting the distance walked using average heart rate during the test ( Knak et al, 2017 );  or 
3) conducting a walk test at screening to act as a familiarization walk test ( Karaa et al, 2018 ). 
In this study the training effect will be minimized using a screening, familiarization 12MWT. To minimize variability attributed to the training effect the Screening and Baseline 12MWTs in this study have been set at a minimum of at least 4 weeks apart, subsequent 12MWTs in the study will be 12 weeks apart at Weeks 12 and 24. 
3.4 Termination or Suspension of Study 
The study will be completed as planned unless one or more of the following criteria occur 
that require temporary suspension or early termination of the study: 
x New information or other evaluation regarding the safety of REN001 that indicates a change in the known risk/benefit profile for the compound, such that the risk/benefit is no longer acceptable for subjects participating in the study. 
x Significant violation of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) that compromises the ability to achieve the primary study objectives or compromises subject safety. 
x Occurrence of local or global events (e.g., COVID-19 Pandemic) that would impact the safety monitoring of subjects in the study. 
A Safety Review Committee will  conduct periodic reviews of all safety data as described in  
Section 3.11 . 
3.5 Termination or Suspension of Investigational Sites 
A study site may be terminated prematurely or suspended if the site (including the 
Investigator) is found to be in significant violation of GCP, the protocol, or the contractual 
agreement, or is unable to ensure adequate performance of the study, or for reasons as otherwise permitted by the contractual agreement.  
3.6 Conditions for Individual Subject Discon tinuation of Study Drug or Withdrawal 
from the Study 
The primary reason for permanent discontinuation  of a subject from the study drug should be 
recorded in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). Individual subjects may  be 
discontinued from the study drug in the following circumstances: 
1. Concurrent enrolment in other clinical studies involving investigational products or 
enrolment in other types of clinical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study. 
2. Use of a prohibited concomitant medication. 
3. Major protocol deviation e.g., the discovery  after administration of the first dose of 
study medication that the subject failed to  meet protocol entry criteria or did not 
adhere to protocol require ments, and continued participation poses an unacceptable 
risk to the subject’s health  or undermines the ability to achieve the objectives of the 
study.

6.Clinically significant changes from baseline in ECG recordings considered treatment-related including an increase from baseline in heart rate corrected QT interval using
Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) to a value of t 500 millisecond (msec). Single ECGs
should be repeated at 5-minute intervals, 3 times, to confirm any increased QTcF
interval values. In the event of an increased QTcF interval of t500 msec, the subject
must be monitored until the value returns to below 500 msec.
7. Clinically significant muscle injury includi ng test abnormalities (e.g., CK) as defined
in Section 3.7.1 .
8.Clinically significant liver toxicity including test abnormalities (e.g., ALT/AST) asdefined in Section 3.7.2 .
9.Clinically significant kidney toxicity including test abnormalities (e.g., creatininelevels) as defined in Section 3.7.3 .
10.A TEAE that could result in a transient or permanent significant impairment. Subjects
should be followed with appropriate medica l management until there is a return to
normal or baseline values or a clinical diagnosis of an emergent illness is confirmed.
11. Voluntary withdrawal. The subject wishes to withdraw from the study. Subjects may
withdraw from the study at any time without penalty and for any reason without
prejudice to their future medical care. In all cases, the reason(s) for withdrawal,including the primary reason, must be recorded in the eCRF. Note: All attemptsshould be made to determine the underlying reason for the withdrawal and, where
possible, the primary underlying reason should be recorded (i.e., withdrawal due to an
AE should not be recorded in the “voluntary withdrawal” category).
If a subject discontinues study dru g the follo wing process (see Figure 3 ) should be followed 
by the Investigator in order to satisfy the regulatory desire to  continue to follow subjects 
where possible (ICH E9-R1) after discontinuation of a stu dy intervention. Hence, if the 
subject discontinues taking stud y drug they will be encour aged, where appropriate, to 
continue with reduced assessments at the Week 12 and Week 24 visits.

3.7 Strategy for Potential Withdrawal due to Laboratory Test Abnormalities 
3.7.1 Safety Monitoring for Serum Creatine Phosphokinase 
Patients with PMM often present with mild to  moderate baseline elevations in CK and can 
experience transient episodes of significantly elevated CK induced by vigorous exercise, and 
other environmental conditions. These elevations are not associated with symptoms or signs and the patients are typically well. CK elevations are generally of the skeletal muscle fraction. However, a small proportion of the total CK may be from the myocardial fraction reflecting a small amount of this fraction found in skeletal muscle rather than the presence of myocardial injury. Importantly, these elevations are entirely to be expected in this patient 
population with underlying muscle disease and are not synonymous with rhabdomyolysis. Similarly, elevations in serum aminotransferases and uric acid can accompany CK elevations and may not be indicative of liver disease.  
True rhabdomyolysis may also occur in these patients and must be managed appropriately. 
Rhabdomyolysis is characterized by severe ac ute muscle injury resulting in muscle pain, 
weakness, and/or swelling with release of myofiber contents into the bloodstream. Symptoms develop over hours to days following an inciting factor and may be associated with dark pigmentation of the urine ( Nance & Mammen, 2015). Acute kidney injury is a potential Subject discontinues IMP

3.7.2 Safety Monitoring For Liver toxicity: Management and Stopping Rules 
In this study, subjects with significant liver disease or impairment of AST or ALT >2.5 x 
ULN, or total bilirubin >1.6 x ULN or >U LN with other signs and symptoms of 
hepatotoxicity at Screening will be excluded. It  would be inappropriate to exclude all subjects 
with milder elevations in LFTs out of the normal range because patients with PMM can present with elevations in CK levels that are often accompanied by elevated LFTs (ALT and 
AST), which are not indicative of liver disease. Accordingly, these elevations appear to be transient and resolve spontaneously ( Tarnopolsky 2016 ). Although serum ALT and AST In the event that: 
x a subject with a normal CK at Baseline has a blood CK level >10 x ULN, or 
x a subject with a CK above ULN at Baseline has blood CK level ≥10 x their Baseline 
level, or 
x a subject has a CK level of >10,000 IU/L 
The subject should be contacted promptly and evaluated for the 
presence of muscle pain, stiffness,  cramping and myoglobinuria i.e., 
reddish-brown urine.

levels should be measured (e.g. via local 
physician) until signs of CK levels are 
trending downwards 
If symptoms worsen, or myoglobinuria 
develops  or CK levels do not recover after 
7-10 days. The Investigator, Sponsor and 
Medical Monitor should discuss whether 
the subject remains on IMP or a temporary 
or permanent discontinuation of IMP and 
further monitoring is needed

ALT levels can be increased immediatel y after muscular exertion as well ( Lippi 2008 ). 
In the event that a subject presents with raised LFTs during the study the following 
management guidelines and stopping rules should be followed: 
x For subjects who enroll with a baseline below the ULN and present with an increase in serum ALT or AST > 3xULN, repeat testing of ALT, AST, ALP and total bilirubin will be obtained as soon as possible, ideally within 48-72 hours, to confirm the abnormality and whether the abnormality is increasing or decreasing. 
x For subjects who enroll with a baseline above the ULN and present with an increase in serum ALT or AST > 3xULN and at least 2x their Baseline value, repeat testing of ALT, AST, ALP and total bilirubin will be obtained as soon as possible, ideally within 48-72 hours, to confirm the abnormality and whether the abnormality is increasing or decreasing. 
x If symptoms persist or repeat testing shows ALT > 3xULN for subjects with normal baseline measures or 2x their Baseline value for subjects with elevated values at Baseline, initiate close observation with repeat testing 2-3 times weekly, or as clinically mandated, to determine whether the abnormalities are improving or worsening (see below for further details).  
x If close monitoring is not possible, as a precautionary measure study drug should 
be withheld and continued participation in  the study should be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor (See also Section 6.9 ). 
Guidelines for Close Observation:  
x Repeated ALT, AST, ALP, and total bilirubin tests two or three times weekly. 
x Frequency of re-testing can decrease to once a week or less if abnormalities 
stabilize or the study drug has been discontinued and the subject is asymptomatic. 
x Obtain a more detailed history of sympto ms and prior or concurrent diseases. 
x Recheck history of concomitant drug  use (including non-prescription 
medications and herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and any special diets. 
x Rule out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease. 
x Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents. 
x Obtain additional tests to evaluate  liver function, as appropriate (e.g., 
International normalized ratio (INR) or Prothrombin time (PT), direct bilirubin). 
x Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consultations.

If subjects develop a creatinine elevation > 2xULN and more than 2x Baseline value: 
x Monitor creatinine 2 times per week, or as clinically indicated, until recovery. 
x For subjects with > 3xULN creatinine elevation the study drug should be 
withheld and the subject should continue to be followed closely. 
x In the event of either of the above continued participation in the study should be discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
Discontinuation:  
Discontinuation of study drug should be cons idered, in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor and Reneo CMO or designee where possible, if: 
x A > 3xULN creatinine elevation is sustained or deteriorating. 
x The subject is unwell and has hyperkalemia. 
3.8 Replacement of Subjects 
Subjects who withdraw due to reasons other than AEs or SAEs may be replaced to ensure that sufficient subjects are available to satisfy the statistical assumptions of the study.  
3.9 Temporary Discontinuations 
Subjects may be temporarily discontinued from study drug while AEs and/or laboratory test 
abnormalities are being investigated and/or at the request of the Medical Monitor. The Investigator should discuss with the Medical Monitor and Sponsor any subject for whom temporary or permanent discontinuation of study drug is being considered. 
If a subject misses several c onsecutive doses due to personal circumstances or due to an AE 
not related to study drug, they may be allowed to restart dosing after discussion between the 
Investigator, Medical Monitor and Sponsor (See Section 5.9 ).

5.1 Study Drug Identity 
Study drug and placebo are presented as Swedish orange, hard gelatin, size 0 capsules, 
manufactured by Xcelience LLC, a Lonza company.  
The dosage strength of REN001 capsules is 50 m g. Matched placebo capsules will also be 
supplied, containing approximately 30 mg microcrystalline cellulose.  Capsules are packaged in 200 mL high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles, with a 
heat induction seal and child-resistant lids, containing 100 capsules of either 50mg REN001, or placebo. Supplies will be identified by th e blinded batch number and expiry date.  
As each subject will take 2 capsules per day th e bottle will contain sufficient capsules for 50 
days of dosing.  
Sufficient bottles will be supplied to ensure subjects have at least enough capsules to 
maintain dosing between Study Center visits. 
5.2 Allocation to Treatment 
Upon Screening, each subject will receive a 6 di git study number allocated by the Integrated 
Web-based Response System (IWRS), which will be used throughout the study. The IWRS 
will use a computer-generated randomization schedule to assign subjects to a treatment 
sequence on a 1:1 basis. The randomization will be stratified by both mutational genotype (m.3243A>G or other mitochondrial DNA defects)  and the screening 12-minute walk 
distance (12MWD) ( ≤ 500 meters or > 500 meters).  
Screened subjects who drop out of the study before receiving study drug or require repeat 
safety lab tests will retain their study number.  A subject may be rescreened once only (with 
prior approval by the Sponsor); for instance, if  a washout of prior medications of longer than 
6-8 weeks is required. Rescreened subjects will be given a new study numbe
r and their
pre
vious study number will also be recorded.
5.3 Maintaining the Blind 
This study is a double-blind study i.e., the study will be Sponsor, subject- and investigator-blinded. All personnel involved in the conduct of the study will remain blinded to treatment until the conclusion of the study. To minimize  the potential for bias, treatment randomization 
information will be kept confidential by the IWRS vendor and will not be released to the 
Sponsor, Investigator, site personnel, or the study monitors until the conclusion of the study. 
REN001 and placebo will be provided as visual ly matched capsules. All study drug will be 
supplied in identical bottles thereby maintaining the double blind conditions for the subject 
and Investigator. 
5.4 Breaking the Blind 
Details of personnel who will be unblinded to subject data during the study will be recorded 
in a document maintained by the Sponsor. 
At the initiation of the study, the study site will be instructed on the method for breaking the 
blind. The study blind should not be broken except in a medical emergency, where knowledge of the study drug received would affect the treatment of the emergency or obtaining this information is a regulatory requirement. As a courtesy, and only if time permits, the Investigator may notify the Sponsor prior to unblinding. All Investigator 
unblinding events will be automatically reported by the IWRS to the Sponsor.

rsion 4.0G
lobal 24June 2022
Page 42 of 93 If the blind is broken, the date, time and reason must be recorded in the subject’s eCRF . 
Information concerning the treatment allocated should only be available to those who need to 
know for the appropriate action to be taken with the subject. 
5.5 Administration 
Subjects will receive either 100 mg REN001 as 2 x 50 mg or placebo as 2 x placebo capsules 
for oral administration once daily for 24 weeks. 
Medication should be taken with food, for consistency of exposure, at a convenient time to 
the subject (ideally in the morning). The exception to this will be when the subject is required 
to attend the Study Center for their Baseline, We ek 12 and Week 24 Visits, when they should 
take the study medication at the Study Center, when instructed to do so, by the site staff. On these visits, sites will ensure the subjects take the study medication with food. 
Subjects will be supplied with a dose recording  card and will be requested to record the date 
and time of dosing for study visit days (other than Baseline, Week 12 and Week 24).  
5.6 Release, Labelling and Storage 
Bottles will be labelled and released in accordance with the Clinical Trials Directive 
2001/20/EC ( European Commission, 2001 ), GMP Directive 2003/94/EC for Investigational 
Medicinal Products ( European Union, 2003 ) and US Code of Federal Regulations 
21CFR312.6 and 21CFR211.165 . 
All study drug supplies must be stored in ac cordance with the manufacturer’s instructions . 
Until dispensed to the subjects, the study med ication (REN001 and placebo capsules) should 
be stored at refrigerated temperature (2-8
oC), in a securely locked area, accessible to 
authorized personnel only. A daily temperature log of the study drug storage area must be recorded and checked every day. Temperature excursions must be reported to the Sponsor or delegate as soon as possible. 
Once the study medication has been dispensed to subjects, it should be stored refrigerated (2-
8
oC) at the subject ’s home. Study medication does not need to be kept refrigerated during 
transport to and from the subject ’s home and the Study Center. Subjects should only open and 
use one bottle of study medication at a time. Study medication should be kept away from 
children.  
5.7 Excessive Pharmacological Effects 
No specific antidotes for REN001 are availa ble and standard supportive measures should be 
used in the case of excessive pharmacological effects. 
5.8 Drug Accountability 
The Investigator is responsible for maintainin g accurate accountability records for study drug 
throughout the study.  
Each dispensing of study drug will be documented in the IWRS and the study supplies 
management system.  
The subject must bring all stud y medication (including empty bottles) to the Study Center at 
each visit, for compliance, reconciliation and quarantine of any expired study medication ahead of destruction. 
Any study medication remaining at the end of study will be returned to the Sponsor or their 
representative or destroyed locally on behalf of the Sponsor (with written permission of the Sponsor) and the destruction fully documented.

Page 43 of 93 5.9 Compliance 
At all study visits subject compliance with the study drug regimen will be monitored by 
capsule counts. Subjects failing to take 2 or m ore doses in a 1- or 2-week visit period or 4 or 
more doses in a 4-week visit period will be reminded of the importance of complying with 
the dosing requirements. If a subject consistently fails to take their study medication, the Investigator should alert the Sponsor, Medical Mo nitor and site monitor and a decision will 
be made as to whether the subject s hould be withdrawn for non-compliance. 
5.10 Contraceptive Requirements 
In countries where the regulatory authority allows this, WOCBP at risk for pregnancy and fertile men will be allowed to enter the study provided adequate contraceptive requirements are followed as outlined below. Contraceptive re quirements for the study have been defined 
using the recommendations of the Clinical Tr ials Facilitation Group, Rome September 2014 
meeting and subsequent update in September 2020 ( Clinical Trials Facilitation Group, 2014 
and 2020) and also the International Council on Harmonization (ICH) M3(R2) guidance (European Medicines Agency, 2009).  
Females 
Females of child-bearing potential must agree to use highly effective methods of contraception from Screening to 30 days after the last study dose. Highly effective methods are: 
x combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation administered by oral or intravaginal route. 
x oral, injectable or implantable progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation. 
x intrauterine device. 
x intrauterine hormone-releasing system. 
x bilateral tubal occlusion. 
x bilaterally orchiectomized or vasectomized pa rtner, provided that partner is the sole 
sexual partner of the subject, and in the ca se of a vasectomized partner has received 
medical assessment of the surgical success. 
x true sexual abstinence, where this is in line with the usual lifestyle of the subject. 
Periodic (calendar, ovulation, symptothermal or post-ovulation) abstinence and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
However, caution with co-administration of REN001 and hormonal contraceptives is advised 
due to the potential for drug-drug interaction, see Section 1.4 . In addition to highly effective 
hormonal contraception therapy, WOCBP at risk of pregnancy are advised to also use an 
additional effective non-hormonal method of contraception.  
Females are considered to be of non-child-bearing potential if they fulfill at least one of the following criteria: 
x Postmenopausal, defined as 45 years of age or older and amenorrhoeic for at least 1 year PLUS have a serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level within the laboratory’s reference range for postmenopausal women, at Screening Visit.  
x Have undergone a documented hysterec tomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy.

lobal 24June 2022
Page 44 of 93 Males are consid ered fertile after p uberty  unless permanently sterile by bilater al 
orchidectomy or vasectomy (following medical assessment of surgical suc cess). Fertile males 
with partners who are W OCBP must agree to use contraception (c ondom) from Baseline until 
14 weeks after the last d ose o f study m edication . A condom is also required to be used by 
vasectomized  men to prevent deliv ery of th e drug via seminal fluid. I n addition, they must be 
advised not to donate sperm during this period. 
5.11 Concomitant Medications 
Any medi cation the subject takes durin g the stud y, prescription and non-prescription, other 
than the study  drug is considered a conco mitant medication. All concomitant medications 
must be recorded in the eCRF. The following in formation must be recorded in  the eCRF for 
each co ncomitant medication: generic name, rout e of administration, dose, start date, stop 
date (and whether it is a prior medication) and indication.   
At Screening, subjects will be asked what me dications they  are currently  taking. At each 
subsequent study visit, subjects will be asked wh at medications they have taken since the last 
study visit. 
Any medi cations taken prior to  the start of dos ing will be docu mented as p rior medicatio ns. 
Medications taken after the first dose of study medication will be documented as concomitant 
medications. Medications that start befor e the firs t dose of study medic ation and continu e into 
the study are considered both prior and concomitant medications. 
Subjects may not use the medications and treatments listed in Table 1  within the indicated 
time interval prior to Day 1 an d these medications  must be withheld for the duration  of the 
study and where possible until completion of the Follow Up visit.

This is a multi-center study which will be conducted at a minimum of 35 study sites. 
A schedule of Activities is presented in Table 2. Details of study assessments are provided in 
Section 7 . 
Visits should occur within the scheduled timeslot for the visit: see  Table 2 , Schedule of 
Activities. Where possible, visits should occur on the target visit day in relation to the 
Baseline visit. All dates should be re corded as DD-MMM-YYYY (e.g., 01 JAN 2018), and 
times should be recorded using the 24-hour clock (e.g., 23:20 not 11:20 pm). 
Assessments should be comple ted in the order below: 
x PROs must be completed prior to exercise testing 
x The 12MWT must be done before the 30STS  
x 30STS must be done last (at least 1 hour after 12MWT) 
6.1 Screening: Visit 1 
All subjects will be given both a written and verbal description of the study. Subjects should 
be given adequate time to think about whether they want to participate and to ask questions. The Investigator (or an appropriate delegate at the site) will obtain written consent from each subject prior to commencing any study related activities or assessments. Following consent, the Screening Visit (Visit 1) must be completed no more than 8 weeks prior to the start of dosing and will take place at the Study Center. There must be a minimum of 4 weeks between the Screening 12MWT and the Baseline 12MWT. If laboratory tests are outside of the normal range at initial screening, tests may be repeated once (this can be done by a home nursing visit). Where possible subjects should be pr e-screened to assess the requirement for 
genotyping. The Screening Visit may be accomplished over more than 1 day. Subjects who are receiving prohibited medications must susp end the medications, if this can safely and 
appropriately be done and have sufficient wa shout during the screening period (see Table 1 ). 
Re-screening of subjects (once only and with prior Sponsor approval) is allowed, for instance 
if wash-out of prior medications or genotypin g is longer than 6-8 weeks. Re-screened 
subjects will not be required to have eith er the eye exam or DXA scan (REN001-201 DXA 
sub-study subjects) repeated within 6 months of the original assessments.
  Where a Study 
Center requires it, subjects may be asked to have a negative COVID-19 test prior to 
undertaking scheduled visits at the Study Center. 
At Screening, all subjects will be allocated a unique 6-digit study number, which will be used 
for the duration of the study. Site staff will need to provide subjects with meals and snacks at appropriate times during the 
visit to ensure subjects have enough energy prior to completing the exercise tests. 
The following procedures will be performed: 
x Subject demography (including ethnicity for calculation of eGFR) 
x Complete medical history (including prescription and non-prescription 
drugs/treatments, non-drug treatments, topical products, vitamins and dietary 
supplements taken in the last 4 weeks, alcohol, drugs of abuse and tobacco use) 
x Full physical examination (including height and weight) 
x 12-lead ECG
x Vital signs (including temperature)

If the subject is withdrawing from the study: after their Early Termination Visit they should 
be instructed to return for the Follow Up Visit 21-28 days after their last dose of study medication. If the Early Termination Visit is 21 or more days after the last dose, then the 
Follow Up Visit is not needed. 
6.9 Subject Continuation In Study Off IMP 
If a subject discontinues taking study drug, they  will be strongly encouraged to continue in 
the study for their Week 12 and Week 24 visits (see Figure 3 ). If they agree to remain in the 
study

7.1 Safety Parameters 
7.1.1 Adverse Events 
7.1.1.1  Definitions 
Pre-treatment Event (PTE) 
A PTE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation 
subject who has signed informed consent to participate in a study but prior to administration of any study medication; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with study participation. 
Adverse Event (AE) An AE is any untoward medical event that occurs in a subject who has received study 
medication and does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable a nd unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational product, whether or not related to the product. 
A treatment-emergent AE will be defined as an AE that begins or that worsens in 
severity after the first dose of study drug has been administered. 
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is any untoward and unintended response in a 
subject to an IMP which is related to any dose administered to that subject. An unexpected adverse reaction is an adverse reaction the nature and severity of 
which is not consistent with the inf ormation about the medicinal product in the 
Investigator's Brochure. 
All PTEs/AEs, including intercurrent illnesses, occurring during the study will be 
documented in the eCRF. 
Each event should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Accompanying signs 
(including abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as additional AEs. If a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded appropriately as a PTE(s) or as an AE(s). 
7.1.1.2  Laboratory values and ECG findings 
Changes in laboratory values or ECG para meters are only considered to be PTEs or 
AEs if they are judged to be clinically significant (i.e., if some action or intervention 
is required or if the Investigator judges the change to be beyond the range of normal 
physiologic fluctuation). A laboratory re-test and/or continued monitoring of an 
abnormal value are not considered an interv ention. In addition, repeated or additional 
noninvasive testing for verification, evaluation or monitoring of an abnormality is not 
considered an intervention. 
If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which 
there is an overall diagnosis (e.g., increase d creatinine in renal failure), the diagnosis 
only should be reported appropriately as a PTE or as an AE. 
7.1.1.3  Pre-existing conditions 
Pre-existing conditions (present at the time of signing of informed consent) are 
considered concurrent medical conditions and should NOT be recorded as PTEs. 
Baseline evaluations (e.g., laboratory tests, ECG, X-rays etc.) should NOT be 
Reneo Pharma Ltd. Confidential Clinical Study Protocol 
REN001-201 Ve
rsion 4.0 Globa l 24June 2022
Page 57 of 93 recorded as PTEs. However, if the subject experiences a worsening or complication of 
such a concurrent condition, the worsening or complication should be recorded 
appropriately as a PTE/AE. Investigators should ensure that the event term recorded captures the change in the condition (e.g. , “worsening of…”) .  
If a subject has a pre-existing episodic condition (e.g., asthma, epilepsy) any occurrence of an episode should only be captured as a PTE/AE if the episodes become more frequent, serious or severe in nature, that is, Investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condition from Baseline (e.g., “worsening of…”).  
If a subject has a degenerative concurrent  condition (e.g., cataracts, arthritis), 
worsening of the condition should only be captured as a PTE/AE if occurring to a greater extent to that which would be expected. Again, Investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change  in the condition from Baseline (e.g., 
“worsening of…”) . 
7.1.1.4  Worsening of PTEs or AEs 
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of a PTE after starting administration of the study medication, the worsening or complication should be recorded appropriately as an AE. Investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condition (e.g. , “worsening of…”).  
If the subject experiences a worsening or co mplication of an AE after any change in 
study medication, the worsening or complication should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condition (e.g. , “worsening of…”).  
7.1.1.5  Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Adverse events of special interest are those of scientific and medical concern specific 
to the Sponsor’s product for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by 
the Investigator to the Sponsor may be warranted. These events require further investigation in order to characterize and understand them. Based on this assessment, 
the Sponsor plans to include events of special interest as follows: 
x Changes in laboratory parameters of muscle injury associated with clinically 
significant adverse events  
x Changes observed after Baseline in fo rmation or exacerbation of cataracts or, 
visual acuity. A spherical equivalent change of >0.75 diopters will be 
considered to be a clinically significant change regardless of changes in lens clarity. 
x Occurrence of fractures after Baseline. 
While AESIs may not meet the definition of an SAE, they should be reported in the 
same manner as SAEs (See Section 7.1.1.9 ). This allows them to be tracked in more 
detail and followed up for additional information if required. When completing the SAE form there is an extra box to check to confirm that the event is an AESI. AESIs will not be reported to the Regulatory Authorities unless they are also SUSARs.  
7.1.1.6  Assessment of Adverse Event 
Each AE will be assessed by the Investigat or with regard to the following categories. 
Reneo Pharma Ltd. Confidential Clinical Study Protocol 
REN001-201 Ve
rsion 4.0 Globa l 24
June 2022
Page 58 of 93 7.1.1.6.1 Seriousness 
A serious AE (SAE) (or serious ADR or unexpected serious adverse reaction) is 
defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
x Results in death 
x Is life-threatening. (This means that the subject is at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.) 
x Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongs existing hospitalization 
x Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
x Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
x Is an important medical event(s) that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but that may jeopardize the subject or 
require intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in subject hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Note: Cases of potential drug-induced liver injury as assessed by laboratory test values (“Hy’s Law Cases”) are also reportable.  If a subject develops abnormal values 
in AST or ALT or both, concurrent with a bnormal elevations in total bilirubin and no 
other known cause of liver injury, that event would be classified as a Hy’s Law Case.  
In this clinical study, the term SAE will be understoo d to also include Hy’s Law 
Cases. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be ex ercised in deciding whether a case is 
serious and whether expedited reporting is appropriate. 
7.1.1.6.2 Severity 
The intensity of each PTE/AE must be assessed by the Investigator using one of the 
following categories, and recorded in the eCRF: 
x Mild: An AE that does not interfere with usual activities 
x Moderate: An AE that interferes with usual activities 
x Severe: An AE that prevents usual activities 
7.1.1.6.3 Causality 
The Investigator will assess the causality / relationship between the study drug and the 
AE and record that assessment in the eCRF . Causality will be shown as Related, 
Possibly Related, or Not related. 
7.1.1.7  Relationship to Study Procedures 
Relationship (causality) to study procedures  should be determined for all PTEs and 
AEs. 
The relationship should be assessed as Yes if the Investigator considers that there is 
reasonable possibility that an event is due to a study procedure. Otherwise, the relationship should be assessed as No.

Page 59 of 93 7.1.1.8  Collection and Reporting of AEs 
7.1.1.8.1 PTE and AE Collection Period 
Collection of PTEs will commence from the time the subject signs the informed 
consent to participate in the study and conti nue until the subject is first administered 
study medication (Day 1) or until screen failure.  
Collection of AEs will commence from the ti me that the subject is first administered 
study medication (Day 1). Routine collection of AEs will continue until the Follow 
Up visit 21 to 28 days after the last study dose. 7.1.1.8.2 PTE and AE Reporting 
At each study visit, the Investigator will assess whether any subjective AEs have 
occurred. A neutral question, such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit?” may be asked.  
Subjects may report AEs occurring at any other time during the study. Subjects 
experiencing a serious PTE must be moni tored until the symptoms subside and any 
clinically relevant changes in laboratory values have returned to baseline or there is a 
satisfactory explanation for the change. 
Non-serious PTEs, related or unrelated to the study procedure, do not need to be 
followed-up for the purposes of the protocol. 
All subjects experiencing AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the 
study medication or not, must be monit ored until the symptoms subside and any 
clinically relevant changes in laboratory values have returned to baseline or until there 
is a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed. All PTEs and AEs will be documented in the PTE/AE page of the eCRF, whether or not the Investigator concludes that the event is related to the study medication. The following information will be documented for each event: 
x Event term. 
x Start and stop date {and time}. 
x Severity. 
x Investigator ’s opinion of the causal relationship between the event and 
administration of study medication (not completed for PTEs). 
x If no, provide alternative etiology or explanation. 
x Investigator’ s opinion of the causal relationship to study procedure(s), 
including the details of the suspected procedure. 
x Action concerning study medication (not applicable for PTEs). 
x Outcome of event. 
x Seriousness. 
7.1.1.9  Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs that occur during the study from the signing of the informed consent and up to 30 days after receiving the last dose of study drug, whether considered to be associated with the study drug or not, must be reported within 24 hours by email or fax to the study pharmacovigilance (PV) team. The minimum information required for 
an initial report is: 
x Sender of report (name, address of Investigator) 
Reneo Pharma Ltd. Confidential Clinical Study Protocol

Page 60 of 93 x Subject identification (subject stud y number, initials, NOT subject name) 
x Protocol number 
x Description of SAE and reason why the event is categorized as serious 
x Causality assessment, if possible 
However, as far as possible all points on the SAE form should be covered in the initial 
report and the completed SAE form faxed or emailed to the pharmacovigilance team 
(details below). The original SAE form should be sent to the address below and the Medical Monitor and the Sponsor Chief Medical Officer informed by email. In addition, the event must be documented in the eCRF.

necessary, contact the Investigator, to obtain further information for assessment of the 
event. Bionical Emas the PV vendor will be  responsible for all information processing 
and reporting according to local legal requirements. Where necessary, Investigators will inform the authorities in their own countries. 
7.1.1.10  Reporting Pregnancies 
Although pregnancy should not be considered as an SAE per se , any pregnancies 
occurring in a study subject between Screening and the end of the contraception requirements (14 weeks after last dose for males, 30 days after last dose for WOCBP) must be reported and captured as if they were SAEs. 
If any subject is found to be pregnant during the study, she should be withdrawn and 
study drug should be immediately discontinued. In addition, any pregnancies in the partner of a male subject during the study or for 14 weeks after the last dose should also be recorded following authorization from the subject’s partner.  
All reported pregnancies will be followe d up to final outcome, using the paper 
Pregnancy Monitoring Report Form. The outcome, including any premature termination, must be reported to the Sponsor. An evaluation after the birth of the child will also be conducted. 
Reports should be sent within 24 hours to the contacts detailed above, using the 
Pregnancy Monitoring Report Form. If the female subject and/or female partner of a male subject agrees to the primary care physician being informed, the Investigator 
should notify the primary care physician that the subject/female partner of the subject

Page 61 of 93 was participating in a clinical study at the time she became pregnant and provide 
details of treatments the subject received. 
7.1.1.11  Follow-up of Adverse Events 
All AEs experienced by a subject, irrespective of the suspected causality, will be 
monitored until the event has resolved, any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline or stabilized at a level accep table to the Investigator, Medical Monitor 
and/or Sponsor Chief Medical Officer or desi gnee, or until there is a satisfactory 
explanation for the changes observed, or until the subject is lost to follow-up. 
7.1.1.12  Safety Reporting to Investigators, IRBs or IECs, and Regulatory 
Authorities 
The Sponsor will be responsible for reporting all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) and any other applicable SAEs to regulatory authorities, Investigators and IRBs or IECs, as applicable, in accordance with national or regional 
regulations in the countries where the study is conducted. Relative to the first 
awareness (Day Zero) of the event by/or further provision to the Sponsor or Sponsor’s 
designee, SUSARs will be submitted within 7 days for fatal and life-threatening events and 15 days for other serious events, unless otherwise required by national regulations. The Sponsor will also prepare an expedited report for Events Requiring 
Other Actions, where these might materially alter the current risk-benefit assessment of an IMP or that would be sufficient to consider changes in the investigational medicinal products administration or in the overall conduct of the trial. The investigational site also will forward a copy of all expedited reports to his or her IRB or IEC in accordance with national regulations. In addition, once a year throughout 
the clinical trial or upon request, a Devel opment Safety Update Report (DSUR) will 
be submitted to the concerned Competent Authorities (CAs) and IEC/IRBs taking into 
account all new available safety information received during the reporting period. 
7.1.2 Clinical Laboratory Safety Tests 
Laboratory assessments will be performed by a central laboratory. Details of the urine and blood sampling procedures and any subject restrictions (e.g. withholding supplements) and subsequent storage and shipment of samples can be found in the 
REN001-201 Laboratory Manual. Sites will be provided with lab kits from the central 
laboratory. Details of parameters to be tested are listed in  Table 3 .

7.1.4 Physical Examination 
All physical examinations will be carried  out by a suitably qualified doctor or 
equivalent. At Screening and Baseline the subject will have a full physical 
examination, to include an assessment of head, neck, heart, lungs, abdomen, skin 
(including hair and nails), peripheral cir culation, joints, general appearance, and a 
neurological examination. Any abnormalities should be recorded in the study eCRF. 
At Weeks 12 and Weeks 24 subjects will have a brief symptom-directed physical 
examination, which should include general appearance, heart, lungs, skin, and a 
neurological examination. Clinically si gnificant changes from the baseline 
examination should be assessed. Other systems examined should be determined by 
clinical findings and any adverse events reported. 
7.1.5 Height and Weight and Body Mass Index 
Subjects should have weight and height measured while wearing indoor clothing and 
with shoes off. The Body Mass Index (BMI) will be calculated in the eCRF 
(expressed to 1 decimal place) using metric units with the formula provided below: 
x BMI = weight (kg)/height (cm) 2 
Reneo Pharma Ltd. Confidential Clinical Study Protocol 
REN001-201 Ve
rsion 4.0 Globa l 24June 2022
Page 64 of 93 x Height will be collected in centimete rs (without decimal places) at Screening 
only, and weight will be collected in kilograms (to 1 decimal place). 
7.1.6 Vital Signs Measurements 
Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic mmHg) and pulse (beats per minute) will be 
measured. Subjects should be supine for at least 5 minutes before taking the measurement. All measurements will be taken with the subject in a supine position. Blood pressure will be measured using the subject ’s dominant arm, where possible 
this should be done throughout the study, and recorded to the nearest mmHg.  
Pulse should be measured in the brachial/radial artery for at least 30 seconds. 
7.1.7 Body Temperature 
Body temperature will be recorded using a digital thermometer. Any results <35
oC 
should be repeated to ensure correct placement of the thermometer. 
7.1.8 Electrocardiogram Recording 
Single ECG measurements using a 12-lead ECG machine will be taken after the 
subject has rested for at least 10 minutes in a supine position. To ensure safety of the 
subjects, a qualified individual at the site will evaluate all ECGs. 
If the QTcF is t450 msec at Screening or QTcF is t500 msec for any post-baseline 
ECG, the ECG intervals should be inspected carefully to ensure that the RR interval 
has been recorded correctly, and a single ECG will be repeated at 5-minute intervals 3 
times. If these values are consistently high ( t450 or 500 msec, respectively), or if the 
Investigator or Medical Monitor has any concern, as a precautionary measure, the 
subject will be screen failed or discont inue study treatment as appropriate (see Section 
3.6). 
If a machine read QTcF value is prolonged, as defined above, repeat measurements 
may not be necessary, provided a qualified physician’s interpretation determines that the QTcF values are acceptable for the individual. In some cases, it may be necessary to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out imprope r lead placement as contributing to the 
ECG abnormality. It is important that leads are placed in the same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings.  
ECGs may be sent to an ECG vendor for centra lized reading at a later date if deemed 
necessary. 
7.1.9 Eye Examination 
All eye examinations should be carried out by an appropriately qualified professional. 
Best efforts should be made to ensure th e same professional undertakes the slit lamp 
examinations for a particular subject. Ea ch lens should be classified and graded 
against the Lens Opacity Classification System III, ( Chylack et al, 1993 ).  
In addition, best corrected distance visual ac uity (including refraction) should also be 
assessed. A spherical equivalent change of >0.75 diopters will be considered to be a 
clinically significant change regardless of changes in lens clarity. 
It is important that qualified professionals administering the examination are fully 
trained to reduce variability across Study Centers. The data should be collected in the separate eye examination workbook.

the initial Screening visit and Baseline for the pre-treatment assessment and ± 14 days 
of the visit window given for the eye assessments performed at the Week 12 and 
Week 24 visits. Note for re-screened subjects their original eye examination can be used and the examination does not need to be repeated if its within 6 months of the original eye examination date. 
In addition, any subject who experiences any visual symptoms during the study 
should have an additional ophthalmic examination as appropriate. 
7.1.10 12-Minute Walk Test 
The 12MWT is a practical test that requires simple equipment to execute. This test 
measures the distance a subject can walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 12 
minutes. It is important that operators admini stering the test are fully trained to reduce 
variability across Study Centers. There mu st be a minimum of 4 weeks between the 
Screening and Baseline 12MWT to minimize any training effect. Subjects who walk further than 1000 m at Screening will be excluded from the study. Subjects who walk 
≤ 1000 m at Screening but subsequently walk greater than 1000 m at Baseline will be 
allowed to continue into the study but will be excluded from the per protocol analysis. 
Further details are given in the REN001-201 Exercise Manual. 
7.1.11 36 Item Health Survey V2.0
® (SF-36) 
The 36-Item Health Survey Version 2.0® asks questions which cover eight health 
concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health 
problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-
being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also 
includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health. A one-week recall period will be used. 
7.1.12 Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) 
The MFIS is a detailed tool, that is comple ted by the subject personally, rather than 
having an interview and thus, no training is  required to deliver it. Scoring is simple, 
the score reflects functional limitation due to fatigue expe rienced within the previous 
7 days rather than a measure of the current level of fatigue. It may be used in both the 
clinical and the research setting in people for whom fatigue is a predominant symptom.  
There are 21 items, each of which is scored 0 (Never) to 4 (Almost always), providing 
a continuous scale of 0 –84. It is composed of three subscales that describe the impact 
of fatigue on physical, cognitive and psychosocial functioning: 
Physical functioning (9 items) reflects motivation, effort, stamina, and coordination. 
The physical subscale can range from 0 to 36. It is calculated by adding items 
4+6+7+10+13+14+17+20+21. 
Cognitive functioning (10 items) concerns concentration, memory, thinking and 
organization of thoughts. The cognitive subscale can range from 0 to 40. It is calculated by adding item s 1+2+3+5+11+12+ 15+16+18+19. 
Psychosocial functioning (2 items) describes the impact of fatigue upon isolation, emotions, workload, and coping. The psychosocial subscale can range from 0 to 8. It 
is calculated by adding items 8+9. 
All items are scaled so that a higher score indicates a greater level of fatigue.

7.1.13 Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) 
The Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form) rapidly assesses the severity of pain and its 
impact on functioning. It is widely used in research and clinical settings. 
Four severity items will be investigated by the responses to the worst, least and 
average pain in last 24 hours and the pain right now (Questions 3, 4, 5 and 6). The higher score indicates worse pain. A pain severity score will be calculated as the mean of the non-missing 4 severity items. A higher  score indicates greater pain severity. 
In addition, the average pain interference score will be derived as the average of the responses to the 7 components to Question 9. A higher score indicates the more pain interferes with daily functioning.

7.1.18 Work Productivity and Activity Impai rment Questionnaire: Specific Health 
Problem (WPAI:SHP)
The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire is a well 
validated instrument to measure impairments in work and activities due to a specific 
disease. Outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers 
indicating greater impairment and less pr oductivity, i.e., worse outcomes. See 
calculation below:
Scores:
Percent work time missed due to PMM: 100 x Q2 / (Q2 + Q4)
Percent impairment while working due to PMM: 100 x Q5 / 10Percent overall work impairment due to PMM: 100 x Q2 / (Q2 + Q4) + [ (1-

7.1.19 PROMIS Short Form v1.0 –Fatigue 13a (FACIT-Fatigue)
The PROMIS® (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) Fatigue items assess a range of self-reported symptoms, from mild subjective feelings 
of tiredness to an overwhelming, debilitati ng, and sustained sense of exhaustion that 
likely decreases one’s ability to execu te daily activities and function normally in

specific. All assess fatigue over the past seve n days. The score is calculated by adding 
all the individual question scores (scores of 1 to 5) together to give a total score. 
Hence a range of scores between 13 and 65 are possible with a higher score indicating a greater level of fatigue. 
See Appendix 5. 
7.1.20 30 Second Sit-To-Stand Test 
The purpose of the 30 second sit-to-stand test is to assess leg strength and endurance. 
Subjects are required to sit and rise to full standing position as many times as they can in 30 seconds. A subject can only conduct the test if they are able to stand without 
using their arms to assist them out of the chair. A score of 0 and a reason for not completing the test must be noted in the eCRF in these circumstances. Details of any 
orthotics used should also be recorded in the eCRF. This test must be completed at 
least an hour after the 12MWT. 
Further details are given in the REN001-201 Exercise Manual. 
7.1.21 Pedometer Step Counts and eDiary  
At the completion of the Screening visit each subject will be given a pedometer 
(3DFitBud model A420S or equivalent). The site staff will set-up the pedometer with the eDiary (Medrio formerly HMD Clinical Ltd) and train the subject on how and when to use it. Subjects will collect their daily step counts (from waking until bedtime) and should enter the total step count  each day in the eDiary. Subjects will be 
asked to start using the pedometer for 14 days once they have returned home after their Screening visit. For the remainder of the study subjects will use the pedometer and collect the daily step counts for 7 consecutive days within a 2-week window before each study visit. Reminders will be  sent to subjects who forget to record the 
step count data. In addition, the eDiary w ill allow subjects to enter missed data up 
until midday the next day. If subjects are unable or non-compliant in using either the 
pedometer or eDiary for any reason, data will not be analyzed for that subject. 
7.1.22 PMM Phenotypic Description 
To enable comparative descriptions of the phenotypic state of each subjects’ disease, 
3 questions, taken from the Newcastle Mitochondrial Disease Adult Scale (NMDAS) will be completed by the physician. A physician will complete the questions at Baseline and Week 24 (or at the Early Termination Visit).  
The questions do not need to be read verbatim, but the subject should be questioned to 
determine the response which best descri bes the subject’s function. To ensure 
consistency in interpretation the same ph ysician (where possible) should assess 
subjects on both occasions. 
Rate function over the preceding 4-week period, accord ing to patient and/or 
caregiver  interview only. The clinician’s subjective judgement of functional ability 
should not be taken into account.

direct venipuncture or indwelling cannula.  
A 4.0 mL blood sample, to provide a pproximately 2 mL of plasma for 
pharmacokinetic analysis, will be collected  into an appropriately labelled tube. 
Sample handling instructions will be provided in the REN001-201 Laboratory 
Manual. The plasma samples will be stored at  the central lab prior to analysis. Plasma 
samples will be transferred from the centra l lab to the bioanaly tical laboratory on dry

8.1.1 Disposition of Subjects 
The number and percentage of subjects entering and completing the study will be 
presented overall and by treatment group. Reasons for withdrawal will also be summarized. 
8.1.2 Protocol Deviations 
Deviations from the protocol will be categorized as “minor” or “major” in cooperation 
with the Sponsor. Deviations will be assessed regularly and finalized prior to database 
lock.  
8.1.3 Analysis Populations  
Screened Set All subjects who sign the informed consent form. 
Randomized Set All subjects who are randomized. 
Full Analysis Set (FAS) All randomized subjects who receive at least one dose 
of study treatment. 
Modified Analysis Set All randomized subjects who receive at least one dose 
of study treatment  and at least one on-treatment 
measurement*. 
Safety Set All subjects who receive at least one dose of study 
treatment. 
Per protocol (PP) Set All subjects in the FAS who do not violate inclusion or 
exclusion criteria and/or deviate from the protocol, in a way that could influence their efficacy assessment. Subjects who walk more than 1000m in the Baseline 12MWT will also be excluded from the set. 
PK Set All subjects in the FAS who receive REN001 and have 
at least 1 evaluable post- dose PK measurement (even if 
this is ˂Level of Quantification (LOQ)).  
* For the primary endpoint this will be 12MWD
The F
AS will be used for reporting demogra phic and baseline characteristic data, and 
as the primary analysis population for efficacy. Subjects will be analyzed by planned 
treatment. The PP set will be used for sensitivity analyses of the primary and 
secondary endpoints.  
All safety analyses will be based upon the Safety Set. Subjects will be analyzed by the 
treatment received. 
After all the data have been ve rified/coded/entered into the database, a review will be 
performed. The purpose of this review will be to define the analysis populations. The 
review will also check the quality of the da ta, identify outliers, and make decisions on 
how to deal with any data issues (e.g., missing values, withdrawals, protocol

Page 72 of 93 deviations). After the pre-analysis review, resolution of all issues and documentation 
of all decisions, the database will be locked.  
8.2 General Considerations 
8.2.1 Statistical Hypotheses 
The null (H 0) and alternative (H 1) hypotheses for the primary endpoint, can be 
expressed as: 
H0: PREN = PPLA
H1: PREN ≠ PPLA
where PREN and PPLA are the Week 24 mean changes from baseline in 12MWD for 
REN001 and Placebo respectively. 
All statistical testing will be at the 5% level of significance (2-sided) and all point 
estimates for the comparison between treatment groups will be accompanied by 2-
sided 95% confidence intervals. 
8.2.2 Determination of Sample Size 
A sample size of 186 subjects (93 per treatment group) provides 90% power, with a 
two-sided significance level of 5%, of obtaining a statistically significant difference 
between two treatment groups for the distance walked during the 12MWT. This assumes a treatment effect (difference to pl acebo in mean change from baseline) size 
of 60 meters. The standard deviation for the changes from baseline observed in Study 
REN001-101 was approximately 100 mete rs. A higher standard deviation, 125 
meters, has been assumed for this study due to the longer assessment period (24 
weeks instead of 12 weeks) and the larger number of sites included in this study. Allowing for a reduction in power due to subject withdrawals a total of approximately 
200 subjects will be randomized. 
8.2.3 Control of the Type 1 Error Rate 
To preserve the Type 1 error a fixed sequence testing procedure will be adopted. The 
order of testing will be: 
1.Change from Baseline at Week 24 in distance walked during the 12MWT
2.Change from Baseline at Week 24 in the MFIS Physical subscale score
3.PGIC score (muscle symptoms) at the end of treatment
8.2.4 Data Summaries 
All endpoints will be summarized by trea tment group and visit. Continuous data will 
be summarized using descriptive statistics (e.g., mean and standard deviation) and categorical data will be summarized using frequency tables (counts and percentages). 
8.3 Demographics, Baseline Characterist ics and Concomitant Medications 
Demographics, baseline characteristics, me dical history and concomitant medication 
data will be summarized by treatm ent group and over all subjects.  
WHODrug and MedDRA coding dictionaries will be used for the concomitant medications and medical histories respectively.

Page 73 of 93 8.4 Treatment Compliance 
Treatment compliance will be assesse d through capsule counts and will be 
summarized by treatment group.  
8.5 Efficacy Analyses 
8.5.1 Primary Endpoint 
The changes from baseline in distance walk ed during the 12MWT for the FAS will be 
analyzed using a MMRM. The model will include fixed terms for treatment, visit and 
the treatment-by-visit interaction. The model will also include the stratification mutation factor and continuous baseline distance walked during the 12MWT as 
covariates. An unstructured covariance struct ure will be used for the repeated visits 
within a subject. The Kenward-Rogers approximation ( Kenward & Roger 1997 ) will 
be used to estimate the denominator degrees of freedom. The treatment comparison (REN001 100mg - placebo) for the change from baseline at both Weeks 12 and 24 
will be estimated. The esti mates, standard errors, 95% confidence intervals and 
associated p-values will be presented. The primary comparison is Week 24. 
Intercurrent Events 
The following potential intercurrent events are currently identified: 
x Discontinuation of study drug  
x Inability to perform the test or stopping the test prematurely due to reasons at least 
possibly related to PMM 
A treatment policy strategy will be used; hence the distance walked at the relevant 
visit will be included in the analysis, regardl ess of intercurrent events. If the subject is 
unable to perform the test a distance of 0 meters will be imputed for the visit. 
Using this treatment policy strategy, the es timand is defined as the difference in 
means between the treatments in the target patient population for the change from 
baseline at Week 24 in 12MWD, regardles s of whether or not the subject continues 
with treatment or is unable to walk for 12 minutes. 
Missing data 
All possible efforts will be made to ensure that subjects complete all the required 
assessments. Subjects who discontinue study drug will be encouraged, where appropriate, to continue with  reduced assessments at the Week 12 and Week 24 visits 
(see Section 3.6 ). However missing data may arise for the following reasons: 
x Withdrawal from the study 
x Unable to perform the test for reasons un related to their PMM (e.g., site unable to 
perform the test at the visit, or the subject suffers an accidental injury prior to the 
visit) 
x Unable to walk for 12 minutes for reasons unrelated to their PMM (e.g., 
unexpected fire alarm at the study center  means the test has to be aborted) 
For the primary analysis the data will be considered as MAR. Missing scores (as opposed to intercurrent events) will be imputed using the technique of multiple 
imputations. The multiple imputation step will be performed prior to any fixed imputations.  
Reneo Pharma Ltd. Confidential Clinical Study Protocol 
REN001-201 Ve
rsion 4.0 Globa l 24June 2022
Page 74 of 93 Each dataset with complete data for each subject will be analyzed using the MMRM 
model described above and the results obtained will be combined using Rubin’s 
imputation rules ( Rubin, 1987 ) to produce pooled estimates of the treatment 
difference, along with their standard erro rs, 95% confidence intervals, and associated 
p-values.
As rules for handling intercurrent events and missing data may potentially bias the 
outcome of the statistical analyses and the subsequent estimation of the magnitude of 
the treatment effect, sensitivity analyses  will be conducted to provide a balanced 
assessment of treatment efficacy. 
The following sensitivity analyses will be conducted: 
x a pattern-mixture multiple imputation approach where missing data from subjects 
who receive either treatment will be assumed to follow a similar trajectory to those in the placebo group. 
x a tipping point analysis ( O’Kelly & Ratitch, 2014 ) will be used, imputing different 
changes from baseline for the missing data. 
In addition, the primary analysis will be replicated using the PP set. 
A while on-treatment policy strategy will  also be employed in a supplementary 
analysis utilizing only the on-treatment measurements for each subject. All missing 
data will be taken as MAR and so a MMRM will be used, without multiple 
imputation.  As all subjects would be required to have at least one post-baseline on-
treatment measurement this analysis w ill use the modified analysis set. 
All model assumptions will be checked by evaluating model residuals. If the evaluation of residuals indicates a problem with the model assumptions, a transformation of the data or non-parametric analyses may be considered. 
8.5.2 Secondary Endpoints  
The MFIS Physical subscale score changes f rom baseline will be analyzed using a 
MMRM. The model will include fixed terms for  treatment, visit and the treatment-by-
visit interaction. The model will also in clude the stratification mutation factor, 
continuous baseline MFIS physical subsca le score and continuous baseline distance 
walked during the 12MWT as covariates. An unstructured covariance structure will be 
used. The treatment comparison for the change  from baseline at each visit will be 
estimated. The estimates, standard errors, 95% confidence intervals and associated p-
values will be presented for each visit. The primary comparison is Week 24. 
The MFIS assessment may also be impacted by intercurrent events.  Similar to the 
primary endpoint a treatment policy strate gy will be adopted. Pattern mixture and 
tipping point analyses will be included as sensitivity analyses and a while on 
treatment policy strategy will also be employed as a supplementary analysis. 
The PGIC (muscle symptoms) data will be converted to a numerical scale from 3 
(very much improved) to -3 (very much worse); hence a value of 0 would signify no change. This score will then be analyzed using ANCOVA, using a fixed term for treatment and the mutation stratification factor and continuous baseline distance 
walked during the 12MWT as covariates. The treatment comparison will be estimated, along with its standard error, 95% confidence interval and associated p-value.

The primary analyses for these endpoints will  also be replicated using the PP set. 
8.5.3 Exploratory Endpoints 
Exploratory endpoints will be summarized and analyzed, using the FAS, to estimate 
the treatment effect and corresponding 95%  confidence interval. Full details of 
analyses will be provided in the SAP. 
8.6 Safety Analyses  
No imputation will be used for handling missing data, with the exception of 
conservative approaches taken for missing adverse event information (e.g., intensity). Details of such conventions will be documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
Treatment-emergent adverse events will be  summarized by treatment group and by 
SOC and Preferred Term, in accordance with the MedDRA coding dictionary. The 
number of subjects reporting each AE preferred term will be tabulated for all TEAEs and separately for those considered as at least possibly related to study treatment by the Investigator. Number of subjects reporting SAEs and AESI will also be tabulated. 
Changes from baseline in laboratory para meters, vital signs and ECG data will be 
summarized by treatment group and by visit. Baseline will be taken as the last 
measurement prior to dosing. 
A categorical shift table of change from baseline will be summarized by treatment 
group and by visit for the eye examination parameters.  
The incidence of potentially clinically significant laboratory and ECG values (e.g., 
increase in QTcF ≥30 msec from baseline or an absolute QTcF value of ≥500 msec) 
will be flagged in listings a nd summarized by treatment group. 
8.7 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints 
Plasma concentrations of REN001 will be summarized over time using descriptive 
statistics for Day 1, Week 12 and Week 24.  
Individual subject concentration-time data on Day 1, Week 12 and Week 24 will be 
plotted over actual PK sampling times. Median profiles of the concentration-time 
data, using nominal PK sampling times, will also be presented for Day 1, Week 12 and Week 24. Both linear-linear and linear-log plots will be presented. 
The data will be used for a population PK analysis which will be reported as a 
standalone report to the Clinical Study Report.  
8.8 Interim Analyses 
No formal interim analyses are planned for the primary endpoint; however, an 
independently chaired Safety Review Comm ittee (SRC) will review safety data at 
specified intervals for the duration of the study. The structure, function and operation 
of the SRC will be detailed in the REN001-201 SRC charter.

9.1 Data Quality Assurance 
The Sponsor (or its delegate) will conduct a site visit/telephone call to verify the 
qualifications of each Investigator, inspect the site facilities, and inform the 
Investigator of responsibilities and the proc edures for ensuring adequate and correct 
documentation.  
The Investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study participant. All information recorded  in the eCRFs for this study must be 
consistent with the subject s’ source documentation ( e.g., medical records).  
9.2 Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRF) and Source Documentation 
All data obtained during this study should be entered in the eCRFs promptly. All 
source documents from which eCRF entrie s are derived should be placed in the 
subject ’s medical records. Measurements for which source documents are usually 
available include laboratory assessments, and ECG recordings.  
The original eCRFs for each subject will be checked against source documents at the 
study site by the site monitor.  
After review by the site monitor, completed eCRFs will be marked as complete and 
verified. Data Management will  review the eCRFs within the electronic data capture 
(EDC) system. Where data is discrepant, Data Management will raise queries for the site to resolve within the EDC.  
9.3 Access to Source Data 
During the course of the study, a monitor will make site visits to review protocol compliance, compare eCRFs and individual subject ’s medical records, assess drug 
accountability, and ensure that the study is being conducted according to pertinent 
regulatory requirements. eCRF entries will be verified with source documentation. The review of medical records will be performed in a manner to ensure that subject confidentiality is maintained.  
Checking of the eCRFs for completeness and clarity, and cross-checking with source 
documents in the presence of the Investigator, will be required to monitor the progress 
of the study. Moreover, regulatory authorities of certain countries, IECs, and/or the Sponsor’s Clinical Quality A ssurance consultant may wish to carry out such source 
data checks and/or on-site audit inspections . Direct access to source data will be 
required for these inspections and audits; they will be carried out giving due consideration to data protection and medical confidentiality. The Investigator assures Orphan-Reach Ltd and the Sponsor of the necessary support at all times.  
9.4 Data Processing 
The site will be supplied with the following data collection tool: a web browser address for EDC that has been fully validated and conforms to 21CFR11 requirements. The trained Investigator site staff will enter the data required by the protocol into the eCRFs from source docu ments (e.g., medical records and study-
specific data capture tools as needed) using the supplied data collection tool. All 
information in the eCRFs must be traceable to these source documents. Data recorded 
directly into the eCRFs will  be defined before study s tart and the eCRFs will be 
considered the source data. Site monit ors and data managers will review eCRFs

Page 77 of 93 entered by investigational staff for completeness and accuracy. Automatic quality 
programs check for data discrepancies in the eCRFs and the resulting queries will be 
notified to the investigational site using an electronic data query process within the 
EDC. Designated Investigator site staff are required to respond to queries and make 
any necessary changes to the data promptly. Details of the data correction process will be specified in the Data Management Plan. After database lock, the Investigator will receive a compact disc (or equivalent) of the subject s’ eCRFs (portable document 
format) for archiving at the investigational site.  
A validated, electronic database will be employed from the EDC system. An audit trail of all changes to this database, including the date, reason for the data change and who made the change, will be maintained within the same database. The audit trail will be part of the archived data at the end of the study.  
9.5 Archiving Study Records 
Adequate records as required by ICH GCP and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), will be maintained for the study. This will include subject medical records, Investigat or logs, eCRFs, laboratory reports, work 
sheets, signed Informed Consent Forms, drug dispensing records, adverse experience reports, information regarding subjects’ disc ontinuation and electronic data. Essential 
documents should be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an IC H region or at least 2 years have elapsed 
since the final discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. However, if required by the applicable re gulatory requirements or by an agreement 
with the Sponsor these documents should be retained for a longer period. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the Investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. 
9.6 Good Clinical Practice 
The procedures set out in this study protocol are designed to ensure that the Sponsor 
and Investigator abide by the principles of GCP guidelines of the ICH, and of the Declaration of Helsinki (2013). The study al so will be carried out in keeping with 
local legal requirements.  
9.7 Confidentiality 
All study findings and documents will be regarded as confidential. The Investigator and members of his/her research team must not disclose such information without prior written approval from the Sponsor.  
The anonymity of participating subjects must be maintained. Subjects will be 
identified in eCRFs and other documents submitted to Orphan-Reach Ltd by their 
subject number and/or birth year, not by name. Documents not to be submitted to Orphan-Reach Ltd that identify the subject (e.g., the signed informed consent) must be maintained in confidence by the Investigator.  
9.8 Informed Consent 
Before each subject is admitted to the study, a personally signed and dated informed consent will be obtained from the subject according to the regulatory and legal requirements of the participating country (i.e., the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH GCP, 
and other applicable local regulations). This consent form must also be signed by the 
person collecting the informed consent and the original will be retained in the site file 
Reneo Pharma Ltd. Confidential Clinical Study Protocol 
REN001-201 Ve
rsion 4.0 Globa l 24
June 2022
Page 78 of 93 and a copy retained in the subject medical records. The subject will also receive a 
copy of the signed consent. The Investigator will not undertake any investigation 
specifically required only for the clinical study until valid consent has been obtained. 
The terms of the consent and when it was obtained must also be documented in the eCRF. 
If a protocol amendment is required, the informed consent form may need to be 
revised to reflect the changes to the protocol. If the consent form is revised, it must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate IEC/IRB and signed by all subjects subsequently enrolled in the study as well as those currently enrolled in the study.  
9.9 Protocol Approval and Amendment 
Before the start of the study, the study protocol and/or other relevant documents will 
be approved by the IEC/IRB/ CA’s , in accordance with local legal requirements. The 
Sponsor must ensure that all ethical and legal requirements have been met before the 
first subject is enrolled in the study.  
This protocol is to be followed exactly. To alter the protocol, amendments must be 
written, receive approval from the appropri ate personnel, and receive IRB/IEC/CA 
approval prior to implementation (if appropriate). All amendments will be distributed 
to all protocol recipients, with appropriate instructions.  
9.10 Duration of the Study 
The planned duration of the study for each subject will be approximately 36 weeks 
(assuming up to 8 weeks screening, 24 we eks treatment and 3-4 weeks follow-up). 
The study will close when all subjects have completed the Week 24 (or Early 
Termination) visit and the s ubsequent Follow Up Visit (21-28 days after last study 
treatment).  
9.11 Liability and Insurance 
The conduct of this trial will be under reasona ble third-party liability insurance cover 
in accordance with all local legal requirements. The civil liability of the Investigator, the persons instructed by him and the hospital, practice or institute in which they are employed and the liability of the Sponsor with  respect to financial loss due to personal 
injury and other damage that may arise as a result of the carrying out of this study are governed by the applicable law.  
Subjects participating in this study will ha ve access to insurance against financial loss 
due to personal injury caused by the study drug being tested or by medical steps taken in the course of the study.  
9.12 Publication Policy 
By signing the study protocol, the Investigator agrees with the use of results of the 
study for the purposes of national and in ternational registration, publication and 
information for medical and pharmaceutical professionals. If necessary, the 
authorities will be notified of the Investigator's name, address, qualifications and extent of involvement.  
After study completion, data from the entire study will be considered for reporting at 
a scientific meeting and for publication in a scientific journal. The Sponsor will coordinate these activities and will work with the Investigator to determine how the 
manuscript is written and edited, the number and order of authors, the publication to 
which it will be submitted and other re lated issues. Authorship will be based on

Appendix 1: International Workshop 
Outcome measures and clinical trial readiness in prim ary mitochondrial 
myopathies in children and adul ts. Consensus recommendations. 16 –18 
November 2016, Rome, Italy 
(Mancuso, McFarland, Klopstock, & Hirano, 2017 ) 
Primary mitochondrial myopathies (PMM), as defined by this consortium of 
international experts in mitochondrial diseas e, are genetically defined disorders 
leading to defects of oxidative phosphorylation affecting predominantly, but not exclusively, skeletal muscle (see below for methodology). Thus, secondary involvement of mitochondria, frequently observed in multiple neuromuscular diseases (e.g., inclusion body myositis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Kennedy disease) is not considered PMM. 
PMM may present at any age, patients with severe generalized muscle involvement 
typically present early in life, although individuals with milder forms of the disease, or symptoms confined to specific muscles tend to have later presentations. The most common presentation of PMM is chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). Chronic PEO is characterized by a slowly progressive, usually bilateral limitation of eye movements (ophthalmoplegia) in all directions of gaze so that patients turn their heads to see a target at the periphery of the visual field; patients 
sometimes report diplopia, especially when onset of ophthalmoplegia is asymmetric. Intrinsic ocular muscles are not involved. PEO is usually accompanied by bilateral eyelid ptosis, which is often the presenting symptom, associated with a compensatory frontalis muscle hyperactivity and, in severe cases, tilting of the head backwards. PEO is often associated with other signs of skeletal muscle involvement, typically a slowly 
progressive axial and proximal limb weakness affecting predominantly the hip and 
shoulder girdle as well as neck flexor musc les often with variable muscle wasting. 
Muscle weakness may also cause dysphagia and dysarthria due to oropharyngeal 
weakness, as well as respiratory failure. Distal myopathic weakness may be present 
but is rarely seen early in the disease.  
From a genetic point of view, PEO may be  autosomal dominant or recessive, sporadic 
(usually due to single largescale deletions of mtDNA), or maternally inherited. 
Autosomal PEO can be associated with  multiple deletions and/or depletion of 
mtDNA, caused by nuclear gene defects and subsequent impairment of mtDNA maintenance. PEO is also the most frequent phenotype associated with a single sporadic largescale deletion of mtDNA.  The “common deletion” is 4.9 -kb and 
accounts for about one-third of all single large-scale deletions of mtDNA. 
Myopathy can be the only clinical feature of a mitochondrial disease but may also be 
part of a component of other mitochondrial syndromes. For example, Kearns-Sayre 
syndrome is defined by the early onset of PEO before age 20 years in association with pigmentary retinopathy, and at least one of  the following: cerebellar ataxia, cardiac 
conduction block, or cerebrospinal fluid protein levels >0.1 g/L. 
Other manifestations of PMM are exercise in tolerance often with myalgia, fatigue 
(defined as an overwhelming sense of tiredness, lack of energy, and feeling 
exhausted), muscle wasting, muscle cram ps, and recurrent rhabdomyolysis with 
myoglobinuria triggered by exercise as seen in cytochrome b deficiency or in the myopathic form of CoQ10 deficiency. Ex ercise-induced symptoms are common in

Page 91 of 93 Appendix 6: Amendment 3 
Amendment Rationale 
a)A global update to remove the requirement for at least 40% of subjects in study
REN001-201 to have the m.3243A>G genotype. Reneo’s Phase 1b study
(REN001-101) was used as the indicator of the proportion of subjec ts with
m.3243A>G point mutations in the g
eneral PMM population. However rece nt
information from ex
ternal and internal recruitment data, a nd discussion with
ex
perts indicates that the initial intent of recruiting ‘at least 40% of subjects  with
the m.3243A>
G’ genotype is neither viable nor desirable. Requiring 40% of
subjects to have m.3243
A>G mutation would result in a genotypic mix in the
REN001-201 stud
y that is not representative of the primary  mitochondrial
m
yopathy population. Furthermore, this amendment to remove the require ment
for
 ‘at least 40% of subjects with the m.3243A>G’ genotyp e is consistent with
advice r
eceived from the European Medicines Agency to include a bro ader
population than wa
s studied in REN001-101. Review of baseline characteri stics of
subjects rec
ruited into REN001-201 to date indicate that when grouped  into
m.3243 A>G, other sin
gle point mutations and single large deletions, these g roups
have compa
rable baseline characteristics . Thus, the intent of recruiting base d on
phenot
ype is effective. The Sponsor has therefore removed the requirement for  at
lea
st 40% of subjects in study REN001-201 to have the m.3243A>G genoty pe.
b)A g
lobal update to Section 7.1.9 eye examination has been mad e to delete
re
dundant text and clarify lens grading and visual acuity.
c)A global update to Section 8 Statistical Methods - The primary analy sis model has
been updated to 
a mixed effect model for repeated measures (MMRM) to al low
the e
stimation of different between subject variances for the two visits. The model
for
 the analysis of the secondary endpoint, MFIS physical subscale, has bee n
updated to remove the 
random subject effect as the different sources of variability
are accounted for within the covariance structure of the MMRM.
d)A global update to clarify that re-screened subjects are not required to repe at their
Scre
ening eye examinations or DXA scans repeat ed within 6 months of the
orig
inal assessments .
e)A g
lobal update to reflect that the REN001 open-label extension study is no w
available, fo
r subjects who complete REN001-201, in countries wher e the
ex
tension study is approv ed.
f)A g
lobal update to clarify that study centers can complete the Baseline, Week 12 ,
W
eek 24 and Early Termination visits over two days at the Investigator ’s
discretion due to the com
plexity of scheduling all the assessments on these visits.
g)A global update to clarify the postmenopausal definition for consistency with the
central lab to women o
f 45 years and older and amenorrhoeic for 1 year in
addition to an FSH level indicating postmenopaus al state.
h) B
elgium ethics committee requested that th e reason for ethnicity being coll ected
(r
egarding eGRF calculation) is mentioned in the protocol. This has been a dded to
Section 6.1
 in the Subject Demography bullet point.
i)Minor typographical errors and corrections have been updated throughout.

Page 3PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Background
Tanezumab is a monoclonal antibody  that binds to and inhibits the actions of nerve growth 
factor (NGF).  The Nerve Growth Factor Inhibitor ( NGFI) class may  offer an important 
breakthrough in the treatment of chronic pain and is under clinical investigation for the 
treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis or other chronic pain conditions. 
The completed Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies conducted to date have demonstrated that 
tanezumab is efficacious and generally  safe and well tolerated for the treatment of pain due 
to osteoarthritis and chronic low back pain.  In addition, completed Phase 1/2studies suggest 
tanezumab is also efficacious and generally  safe for the treatment of neuropathic, visceral, 
and cancer pain. 
In 2010, the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Division of 
Analgesia, Anesthetic, and Addiction Products (DAAAP) placed tanezumab (June/July  2010) 
and subs equentl y the entire NGFI class (December 2010) on partial clinical hold due to 
adverse events initially  described b y investigators as osteonecrosis that in some cases 
resulted in total joint replacement.  Pfizer voluntarily  imposed the partial clinical hold on 
study  conduct in all countries.
Extensive anal yses of the reports of osteonecrosis and other total joint replacements were 
conducted.1  On March 12, 2012, the FDA Arthritis Advisory  Committee reviewed these
results as well as those prepared b y the FDA.2,3  The committee endorsed continued clinical 
development of the NGFI class of compounds with additional measures to mi nimize the risk 
and further protect subject safet y.  On August 28, 2012, the FDA lifted the partial clinical 
hold on tanezumab allowing the resumption of clinical studies for chronic low back pain, 
osteoarthritis and all other chronic pain conditions. 
Measures to better characterize the joint safet y issue have been developed and agreed with 
FDA.  This study  is one component of the agreed risk characterization measures and is an 
attempt to address the potential concern that subjects treated with tanezumab h ave a different 
post-surgical outcome than those not treated with tanezumab.  The total joint replacement 
data from completed tanezumab studies does not suggest a different post -surgical outcome in 
tanezumab treated subjects however those data were gathere d retrospectively . The t ypes of 
endpoints to be assessed in this prospective study  and the duration of the study  have been 
agreed to with the FDA.
The FDA placed another partial clinical hold on the tanezumab clinical development program 
as well as all an ti-NGF antibody  studies in December 2012 due to concerns about adverse 
changes in the s ympathetic nervous s ystem of mature animals.  Onl y studies in patients with 
cancer pain were allowed to continue. 
In animal studies in rats and non -human primates, tane zumab treatment for up to 6 months, 
with doses producing greater s ystemic exposure than observed with clinical doses, was 
associated with lower s ympathetic ganglion volume and lower average size of 
Tanezumab

Final Protocol Amendment 1, 06 January 2016
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 4post-ganglionic sy mpathetic neurons when compared to contr ol animals.   All effects were 
completely  reversible following a dosing -free recovery  period.  In a separate cardiovascular 
function study  in non-human primates, functional changes in the cardiovascular s ystem 
controlled by  the sy mpathetic nervous s ystem we re not observed.  In March 2015, the FDA 
lifted the partial clinical hold on tanezumab allowing the resumption of clinical studies for 
osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain, and all other chronic pain conditions.
Although evidence of clinically important e ffects on the sy mpathetic nervous sy stem have 
not been identified in previously  completed tanezumab studies, per agreement with the FDA, 
this and other clinical studies of tanezumab will incorporate additional safety measures to 
monitor for and manage subj ects who may  develop evidence of clinicall y important 
sympathetic nervous s ystem dy sfunction.  
Study Objectives and Endpoints
Primary Objective :
To describe the post -operative outcome of subjects who underwent a total knee, hip, 
or shoulder replacement wh ile participating in tanezumab Study  A4091056, 
A4091057 or A4091058 (treatment period and safety follow -up period) .
Secondary Objective s:
To compare the post- operative outcome for tanezumab 2.5 mg and 5 mg versus 
non-steroid anti -inflammatory  drugs ( NSAID s)for subjects who underwent a total 
knee, hip, or shoulder replacement while participating in tanezumab Study  
A4091058.
To describe the post -operative outcome of subjects from tanezumab Study  A4091059, 
A4091061 or A4091063 who underwent a total knee, hip, or shoulder replacement
Endpoints :
The following endpoints are considered co -equal:
Surgeon’s Assessment of Procedural Difficult y: number and percentage of surgeries 
assessed as uneventful, minor complications or major complications .
Subject’s overall satisfaction with surgery  as assessed by the Self -Administered 
Patient Satisfaction (SAPS) Scale: number and percentage of subjects satisfied vs .
unsatisfied with their total joint replacement at Week 24 .
Number and percentage of subjects with a post -surgical complication(s) up to 
Week 24 (derived from reported adverse events; see also Section 9).
Number and percentage of subjects with additional or corrective procedures related to
their total joint replacement up to Week 24.

related to the replaced joint up to Week 24.
Change from Baseline to Week 24 in average pain in the replaced joint .
Change f rom Baseline to Week 24 in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities 
Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC )Pain, Stiffness and Phy sical Function subscales in 
the replaced joint (subjects undergoing total hip or knee replacement surgery onl y).
Change from Baseline to Week 24 in the Shoulder Pain and Disability  Index ( SPADI )
in the replaced shoulder (subjects undergoing total shoulder replacement surgery  
only).
Concomitant analgesic medication use.
Study Design
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, long -term observational s tudy of subjects from tanezumab 
Study  A4091056, A4091057 or A4091058 (regardless of treatment group) who undergo a 
total knee, hip or shoulder replacement during participation in the study (treatment period or 
safet y follow- up period) .  If while the subjec t is participating in this study  (A4091064), the 
subject undergoes an additional total joint replacement surgery  or the site becomes aware that 
an additional total joint replacement surgery  has been scheduled for the subject, the subject 
will be requested to provide information on the additional total joint replacement surgery  as 
well.  Finally , any subject with a qualifying total joint replacement after the last subject in the 
study  completes the treatment period in tanezumab studies A4091059, A4091061 or 
A4091063 may be followed in this study  (A4091064).
This study  is designed with a total duration of subject follow- up of 24 weeks after the total 
joint replacement surgery.  There will be two methods of data collection utilized in this 
study : interview b y site staff via the telephone and interactive web- response sy stem (IWRS) 
accessed b y desktop, laptop or tablet computer (or paper if the subject has no access to the 
internet via a desktop, laptop or tablet computer).  Following the surgery , the subject will be 
contacted monthl y via telephone b y stud y site personnel to ascertain whether the subject has 
experienced an y adverse events and to record an y concomitant analgesic medications the 
subject is taking as well as the reason for the medication use.  An asse ssment of the subject’s 
overall satisfaction with their total joint replacement (IWRS), average pain in the replaced 
joint (I WRS), the subject’s level of function and activity  in the replaced joint (I WRS) and 
physical rehabilitation activities (telephone interview) will be made at Weeks 4, 12 and 24.  
At Weeks 12 and 24, subjects will be queried during the telephone interview as to whether 
any additional or corrective procedures related to the total joint replacement are planned. 
All events of total knee, hip or shoulder replacement will be reviewed b y the Joint Safety 
Adjudication Committee (Adjudication Committee) established for the tanezumab clinical 
program.

Page 6Statist ical M ethods
This study  is designed to collect information sufficient to describe the p ost-operative 
outcome of subjects who underwent a total knee, hip, or shoulder replacement while 
participating in tanezumab Study  A4091056, A4091057 or A4091058.  In addition subject s 
with a qualify ing total joint replacement after the last subject in the study  completes the 
treatment period in studies A4091059, A4091061 or A4091063 may be included.  The 
number of subjects who will enroll in this study  is unknown but is estimated to be less than 
250subjects. Also unknown is the distribution of subjects ac ross treatment groups (i e,the 
treatment given in Study A4091056, A4091057, A4091058 , or other tanezumab study). 
Therefore, it is predicted that there will be insufficient statistical power to perform statistical 
inferential analy ses.  All anal yses will be descriptive in nature.
All subjects enrolled in the study  who have a total joint replacement will be included in the 
summary  tables. 
A summary  of data will be shown using subject s from study  A4091058.  The incidence of 
subjects with a total joint replac ement will be summarized for all subjects, and split by  Study  
A4091058 treatment group.  Comparisons of the total joint replacement rates will be made 
between tanezumab versus active comparator treatment groups, using risk differences and 
ratios with 95% c onfidence intervals. Summaries of the time to total joint replacement 
surgery  and time to first sy mptom (leading to total joint replacement surgery ) will be 
summarized using Kaplan -Meier survival estimates from the date of first subcutaneous dose 
in Study A4091058, and shown overall, and split by  Study  A4091058 treatment group where 
there are sufficient numbers of subjects .  A further summary  of the incidence of subject s with 
total joint replacements will be shown separately  for studies A4091056, A4091057,
A4091059, A4091061 and A4091063, as applicable .  Similar summaries by  study  will be 
shown for adjudication outcomes.   The summary  of time to total joint replacement surgery  
and time to first symptom (leading to total joint replacement surgery ) will also b e performed 
using data for s ubject s from Studies A4091056 and A4091057.
Unless otherwise stated, data from this study  will be presented at Baseline and Weeks 4, 12, 
and 24 using observed data (no imputation for missing data), and at Week 24 using L ast 
Obse rvation Carried Forward (LOCF) for missing data.  Data will be shown at the timepoints 
specified and also using change from (pre- surgery) Baseline when Baseline data are available 
and where relevant.  Data will be shown overall, and split by  treatment grou p.  Data on 
surgical difficult y and outcomes, and subject safety  data will be summarized by  study , with 
an additional combined summary  for the subject s from the osteoarthritis studies.
For the Surgeon’s Assessment of Procedural Difficulty , the number and p ercentage of 
subjects in each category (Uneventful, Minor complications, Major complications) will be 
presented.  Complications reported by  the surgeon will be listed.
For the s ubject’s overall satisfaction with s urgery  assessments (using the Self -Administ ered 
Patient Satisfaction scale, SAPS), the responses [score] for each category  will be stratified by  
surgery  type (hip, knee or shoulder) and summarized for each of the four items. Thetotal

Page 7score will be stratified b y surgery  type (hip, knee or shoulder ) and summarized. Reponses to 
the question “ How satisfied are you with the results of y our surgery ?” will also be stratified 
by surgery  type (hip, knee or shoulder) and summarized as satisfied (very satisfied and 
somewhat satisfied categories combined) an d dissatisfied (somewhat dissatisfied and very  
dissatisfied categories combined).
Similarly , the number and percentage of subjects who have required (i) additional or 
corrective procedures related to their total joint replacement and (ii) participating in physical 
rehabilitation activities related to their replaced joint will be presented. 
Average pain ( Numeric Rating Scale , NRS) in the replaced joint for all subjects, WOMAC 
Pain, Stiffness and Phy sical Function sub- scale scores for subjects who had total knee or hip 
replacement and SPADI Pain, Function and Total Score for subjects who had total shoulder 
replacement will be summarized (including change from Baseline summaries).
Standard safet y reporting tables will summarize and list adverse event and conco mitant 
analgesic medications data.
The number and percent of subjects with specified post- surgical complications will be 
presented. The list of post -surgical complications will be derived from reported adverse 
events and will consist of complications that are clinically  significant and attributable to the 
total arthroplasty  procedure e g,periprosthetic joint infection/wound infection, periprosthetic 
fracture, pulmonary embolism or sepsis/septicemia/shock.  Literature reported anal ysesof 
post-surgical complications will be used for guidance in developing the list of post -surgical 
complications. The list of post- surgical complications will be developed during Study
A4091064 and finalized prior to Study A4091058 database lock. 
Separate adverse event summaries by  parent study treatment group for adverse events of 
decreased s ympathetic function will be presented. 
For subjects from study  A4091058 and for subjects from an y of the osteoarth ritis studies, 
summaries of total joint replacement, adjudication event r ates and post -surgical outcomes 
will be shown for subgroups including age, gender, body -mass index (BMI), baseline 
Kellgren- Lawrence grade of the replaced joint (knees and hips onl y) and number of joints 
with osteoarthritis ( OA).
Data Monitoring Committee
An independent, external Data Monitoring Committee ( E-DMC )has been re-instituted for 
the tanezumab clinical program.   This committee will be composed of at least one 
rheumatologist, neurologist, statistician, and epidemiologist.   The E-DMC will review 
unblinded safet y data including (but not limited to) adverse events and serious adverse events 
on a regular basis throughout the trial.   The E-DMC will have written operating procedures 
and a Charter, including a specific description of the scope of their res ponsibilities.

1.1. Mechanism of Action/ Indication
Tanez umab (PF -04383119, formerl y RN624) is an anti -nerve growth factor monoclonal 
antibody  under development for the relief of signs and sy mptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) and 
management of chronic pain including c hronic l ow back pain (CLBP).
1.2.Background and Ration ale
1.2.1. Role of Nerve Growth Factor in the Modulation of Pain
During mammalian development, nerve growth factor (NGF) is required for the survival and 
growth of several populations of neurons.  In adults, the effect of NGF signaling shifts from 
the regulation of neuronal survival to the regulation of neuronal phenoty pe and function.  The 
role of NGF in the adult mammal appears to principally  be as a modulator of nociceptive 
neuronal activity .  Thus, NGF play s an important role in modulation of the pain response.4,5  
Many  studies employ ing a variet y of antibodies to NGF or tropomyosin receptor kinase 
A(trkA) -IgG fusion protein have demonstrated that blocking NGF bioactivity normalizes 
pain sensitivity , particularly  in states of allody nia and hy persensitivity , following a variet y of 
insults such as Freund’s adjuvant, carrageenan, or surgical incision.5,6
Both interleukin (IL) -1and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF -) have been shown to induce 
synthesis of NGF.  Inhibition of NGF in turn blocks the hy peralgesia experienced after 
administration of these cy tokines.7,8  Together these observations suggest that NGF may play  
a role in pain secondary  to inflammation or injury .
1.2.2. Description of Investigational Product
Tanezumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G Type2 (IgG 2) monoclonal antibody , derived 
from a murine precursor by  grafting the murine complementarity  determining regions onto a 
human antibody  framework, followed by  extensive site -directed mutagenesis using 
proprietary  technology  to improve binding a ffinity and specificit y.  A mutation was 
performed in the Fc portion of the antibody  to decrease its ability  to activate complement or 
to support antibody  dependent cell -mediated cy totoxicity .9,10
Tanezumab is highly  potent in sequestering NGF and preventing interaction with the trkA or 
p75 receptors.  Tanezumab and/or the murine precursor have been shown to be an effective 
analgesic in nonclinical animal models of pathological pain including arthritis, cancer pain, 
and post -surgical pain models.11
1.2.3. Overview of Clinical Studies
A total of 32 clinical studies involving over 11,000 subject s have been conducted with 
tanezumab as of September 2014 .  No additional clinical studies have been conducted since 
that time. Approximately 9810 healthy  volunteers or patients have been treated with 
tanezumab in non cancer pain clinical studies.  In patients treated with tanezumab 
monotherap yor tanezumab + NSAID in completed non cancer pain studies, treatment 
experience with tanezumab approximates 5900 patient -years of treatment exposure.

Page 17A total of 17 clinical studies overall (4 Phase 2 studies and 13 Phase 3 studies ) were initiated 
to provi de evidence of efficacy  and safety  of tanezumab with intravenous (IV)or 
subcutaneous ( SC)administration for the relief of the signs and sy mptoms of osteoarthritis 
alone or in combination with NSAI Ds.  Both IV and SC routes of administration with 
tanezuma b at fixed dose levels of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg every  8 weeks were evaluated in 
Phase 3 clinical studies of osteoarthritis subject s. 
The efficacy  and safet y of tanezumab IV in chronic low back pain has been evaluated in 
3Phase 2 studies (N=1564).  The first was a small Phase 2proof -of-concept study  
(A4091004; N=217) which evaluated the efficacy  and safet y of tanezumab 200 g/kg IV 
relative to placebo or naproxen 500 mg twice a day  (BID).  This study  was followed by  a 
Phase 2 dose -ranging study  (A4091012; N=1347) that evaluated the efficacy and safet y of 
fixed doses of tanezumab of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg IV relative to placebo or naproxen 
500mg BI D and a long term safet y extension study (A4091039; N=848) which evaluated the 
safet y and efficacy of tanezu mab 10 mg and 20 mg IV and SC administered every  8weeks 
for 56 weeks.11
In addition to the osteoarthritis studies, 11 Phase 1/2 studies were conducted to examine the 
efficacy  and safet y of tanezumab in neuropat hic, and visceral pain conditions and 2 Phase 2 
studies in metastatic bone pain have been co nducted . In these studies, tanezumab was 
administered b y IV or SC administration every  8weeks at fixed doses ranging 1 mg to 20 mg 
or equivalent bod y-weight adjus ted doses up to 100 mg. 
In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Division of Analgesia, Anesthetic, 
and Addiction Products (DAAAP) placed tanezumab (June/July  2010) and subsequently  the 
entire NGFI class (December 2010) on partial clinical hol d due to adverse events initially  
described b y investigators as osteonecrosis that in some cases resulted in total joint 
replacement.  Pfizer voluntarily  imposed the partial clinical hold on study  conduct in all 
countries.  The conduct of Phase 2/3 studies in osteoarthritis or other chronic pain conditions 
was impacted to vary ing extents by  the partial clinical hold placed on the tanezumab clinical 
development program in June/July  2010.
Extensive anal yses of the reports of osteonecrosis and other total join t replacements were 
conducted.1  On March 12, 2012, the FDA Arthritis Advisory  Committee reviewed these 
results as well as those prepared b y the FDA.2,3The committee endorsed continued clinical 
development of the NGFI class of compounds with additional measures to minimize the risk 
and further protect subject safet y. On August 28, 2012, the FDA lifted the partial clinical
hold on tanezumab allowing the resumption of clinical studies for osteoarthritis and all other 
chronic pain conditions. 
The FDA placed another partial clinical hold on the tanezumab clinical development program 
as well as all NGFI antibody  studies in Dec ember 2012 due to concerns about adverse 
changes in the s ympathetic nervous s ystem of mature animals.  Onl y studies in patients with 
cancer pain were allowed to continue.  During 2013- 2014, Pfizer conducted a comprehensive 
series of nonclinical studies to investigate the nonclinical effects on the s ympathetic nervous 
system which led to the partial clinical hold (described in Sections 5.3 of the tanezumab 
Investigator ’s Brochure).

Page 18In animal studies in rats and non -human primates (described in Section 5.3 o f the tanezumab 
Investigator ’s Brochure), tanezumab treatment for up to 6 months, with doses producing 
greater sy stemic exposure than observed with clinical doses, was associated with lower 
sympathetic ganglion volume and lower average size of post -ganglio nic sympathetic neurons 
when compared to control animals.  All effects were completel y reversible following a 
dosing -free recovery  period.   In a separate cardiovascular function study  in non -human 
primates (described in Section 5.1 of the tanezumab I nvestigator ’s Brochure), functional 
changes in the cardiovascular s ystem controlled by  the sy mpathetic nervous sy stem were not 
observed. In March 2015, the FDA lifted the partial clinical hold on tanezumab allowing the 
resumption of clinical studies for chronic low back pain, osteoarthritis and all other chronic 
pain conditions.
Although evidence of clinically  important effects on the sy mpathetic nervous sy stem have 
not been identified in previously  completed tanezumab studies, per agreement with the FDA, 
this a nd other clinical studies of tanezumab will incorporate additional safety measures to 
monitor for and manage subject s who may  develop evidence of clinicall y important 
sympathetic nervous s ystem dy sfunction.
1.2.3.1. Overview of Efficacy in Clinical Studies
In the t reatment of pain associated with OA, tanezumab monotherap y doses of 2.5 mg to 
10mg have been shown to provide efficacy  that is superior to placebo.  In addition, 
tanezumab monotherap y doses of 5 and 10 mg have demonstrated efficacy  above that of 
NSAIDs.  Relative to oxy codone, tanezumab monotherapy  doses of 5 mg or 10 mg were 
shown to have a favorable efficacy  profile.  Tanezumab 10 mg provided minimal additional 
benefit over tanezumab 5 mg in the treatment of OA.11
In the treatment of CLBP, tanezumab monotherapy  doses of 10 mg and 20 mg demonstrated 
efficacy  that was superior to that of placebo and naproxen.  Tanezumab 20 mg provided 
minimal additional benefit over tanezumab 10 mg in the treatment of CL BP.11
The available efficacy  data in other chronic pain conditions suggests that tanezumab may  
provide meaningful analgesia in subject s with neuropathic pain, visceral pain and subject s 
with pain associated with cancer w ho have metastatic bone pain .11
Study  A4091056 is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter, 
parallel -group, Phase 3 study  of the efficacy  and safet y of tanezumab when administered b y 
SC inject ion for 16 weeks compared to placebo in subject s with osteoarthritis of the knee or 
hip.  Approximately  690 subject s will be randomized to one of 3 treatment groups in a 
1:1:1 ratio.  Subject s will receive a total of two SC injections, separated b y 8weeks :

Based on data from all patient populations who have received tanezumab in completed 
clinical studies to date , the adverse dru g reactions listed in Table 2are considered to be 
expected in subject s who are treated with tanezumab.

1.Rapidly Progressive Osteoarthritis may occur in subjects with underlying osteoarthritis.   The frequency is 
estimated from adjudicated events of rapidly progressive osteoarthritis in historic clinical studies of 
tanezumab, which did not include specific risk minimization measures for this ad verse reaction.
2.Common ( 1% and <10%); Uncommon ( 0.1% and <1%).
The majority  of information regarding the safet y profile of tanezumab comes from studies 
conducted in subject s with osteoarthritis.  The safety  profile observed to date in chronic low 
back pain and other chronic pain subject populations does not differ markedly  from the 
results observed in the osteoarthritis studies.
A total of 7491 subject s were treated in 9 controlled Phase 3 osteoarthritis studies.  The 
majority  of these subject s were t reated in studies using I V administration of tanezumab; 
however, 985subject s with osteoarthritis were treated in 2 studies using SC administration.  
The adverse event profile of SC administration of tanezumab is comparable to the I V route. 
The incidence of adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious adverse 
events in subject s treate d with tanezumab monotherapy  (5-10 mg) was similar to subject s 
receiving active comparator treatment and increased over placebo -treated subject s.  In the 
tanezumab 2.5 mg monotherap y treatment group, the incidence of adverse events was similar 
to active comparator while the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events, and serious 
adverse events was similar to that of the placebo treatment group. Across the tanezumab 
monotherap y doses, the rates of adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events, and 
serious adverse events were similar with tanezumab 5 mg and 10 mg, and elevated in 
comparison to tanezumab 2.5 mg.  Tanezumab/NSAI D combination therapy  was as sociated 
with higher overall adverse event rates.  The relationship of incidence to the dose of 
tanezumab administered was similar to that observed with tanezumab monotherapy .

Page 21Among the most frequently  reported adverse events in the controlled Phase 3 oste oarthritis 
studies, the incidence of peripheral edema, upper respiratory  tract infection, fall ,arthralgia, 
back pain, joint swelling, pain in extremity , hypoesthesia, and paresthesia tended to be higher 
in patients receiving tanezumab monotherapy  than patients receiving either placebo or active 
comparator treatment.  The incidence of peripheral edema, arthralgia, joint swelling, pain in 
extremity , and paresthesia increased with increasing doses of tanezumab monotherapy .  The 
adverse events with increased incidence observed with active comparator over tanezumab 
monotherap y included the following: constipation, nausea, urinary tract infection, 
nasophary ngitis, osteoarthritis, and hy pertension.
The most common adverse events reported in the non- controlled, lon g-term Phase 3 
osteoarthritis studies were similar to those seen in the controlled Phase 3 osteoarthritis 
studies with the exception of the inclusion of musculoskeletal pain and exclusion of 
hypertension and nasophary ngititis and all gastrointestinal- related adverse events.  
Dose -related increases in the incidence of peripheral edema, joint swelling, osteoarthritis and 
paresthesia were observed.
Based on data from the Phase 3 osteoarthritis studies and results of an independent 
adjudication of investigator -reported adverse events of osteonecrosis and total joint 
replacements, the risk of rapidly  progressive osteoarthritis with tanezumab treatment is 
greater than with placebo or active comparator treatment.  
1.2.3.2.1. Sympathetic Nervous System
In completed Phase 3 osteoarthritis studies, the incidence and discontinuation rates due to 
adverse events consistent with decreased s ympathetic function associated with tanezumab 
monotherapy (combined doses of 2.5 to 10 mg) were less than or equal to rates with placebo 
or active comparator.  No evidence of dose related elevations in the frequency of adverse 
events suggestive of decreased s ympathetic nervous sy stem function were observed at 
tanezumab doses of 2.5 to 10 mg in subject s with osteoarthritis or chronic low back pain. 
Tanezumab 20 mg in chronic low back pain had marginally  higher event rates compared to 
placebo and active comparator treatment groups. 
Based on completed osteoarthritis studies where orthostatic blood pressure, heart rate deep 
breathing, or autonomic sym ptoms captured with the Neuropathy  Symptom Change (NSC) 
questionnaire were specifically  assessed, the data are not suggestive of an adverse effect of 
tanezumab on autonomic function. 
1.2.3.2.2. Joint Safety 
Following the imposition of the clinical hold, a comprehe nsive investigation and anal yses 
related to joint -safety  were conducted, based on tanezumab monotherapy  exposure in over 
6400 subject s and tanezumab/NSAID combination therap y in 3400 subject s.  There were 
over 5000 subject s who received tanezumab treatment alone or in combination with NSAI Ds 
for 6 months or longer.  These data were sufficient to define and characterize the adverse 
event of concern –rapidly  progressive osteoarthritis –and evaluate the risk of rapidl y 
progressive osteoarthritis in the conte xt of the overall benefit -risk profile of tanezumab 
compared to standard of care.  The results and conclusions regarding tanezumab and the 
other anti -NGF therapies are provided in detail elsewhere.1,2,3
Tanezumab
A4091064
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 06 January 2016
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 22After careful investigation no evidence was found to indicate that tanezumab is associated 
with an increased risk of osteonecrosis, a disease process quite distinct from osteoarthritis. A 
risk of rapidl y progressive osteoarthritis was identified.  The risk of rapidly progressive 
osteoarthritis with tanezumab monotherapy was well below that observed with 
tanezumab/NSAID combination therap y but greater than with placebo or active comparator 
treatment.  A majorit y of subject s identified with rapidly  progressive osteoarthritis had 
advanced osteoarthritis of the affected joint prior to treatment.  The event rate of all -cause 
joint replacements in subjects with osteoarthritis was comparable among placebo, active 
comparator, and tanezumab monotherapy  treatment groups.
Risk mitigation measures have been developed as an outgrowth of the joint- related safet y 
analyses to reduce the risk of rapidl y progressive osteoarthritis. Risk mitigation measures 
were developed using recommendations from discussions with European agencies [United 
Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory  Agency  (MHRA), Germany ’s 
Paul Ehrlich I nstitute (PEI) and Spain’s Agency  on Medicinal Products and Medical Devices 
(AEMPS)] as well as the FDA Arthritis Advisory Committee and interactions with FDA . 
These risk mitigation measures have been included in the tanezumab clinical development 
program.
1.2.4. Rationale for Study
Measures to better characterize the joint safet y issue have been developed and agreed with 
FDA.  This study  is one component of the agreed risk characterization measures and is an 
attempt to address the potential concern that subject s treated with tanezumab have a different 
post-surgical outcome than those not treated with tanezumab.  The total joint replacement 
data from completed tanezumab studies does not suggest a different post -surgical outcome in 
tanezumab treated subject s however those data were gathered retrospectively. The t ypes of 
endpoints to be assessed in this prospe ctive study  and the duration of the study  have been 
agreed to with the FDA.  Every  effort will be made to enroll all A4091056, A4091057 and 
A4091058 subject s who undergo a qualify ing total joint replacement into this study  however 
it is acknowledged that t o a certain extent the population enrolled in this study  will be 
'self-selected' and thus there may be subject s with a qualify ing total jo int replacement who 
choose not to enter the study .
1.2.5. Rationale for Selected Subject Reported Outcome Measures
Subject -based measures of health-related qualit y of life have increasingly  been used b y the 
orthopedic research community  as a means to define a successful intervention.12Subject
reported outcomes ty pically  assessed pos t-arthroplasty  include overall satisfaction with the 
joint replacement, pain and function. 
TheSelf-Administered Patient Satisfaction Scale (SAPS) will be utilized to assess subject
satisfaction in this study .  The SAPS is a multidimensional, disease spec ific measure that 
evaluates subject satisfac tion with the outcome of hip or knee arthroplast y and was designed 
to be used in conjunction with other clinical measures and functional health status 
instruments to evaluate the results of hip and knee arthropla sty.  The validity  and reliability  
of the scale has been demonstrated.13The scale consists of four items focusing on 
satisfaction with the extent of pain relief, improvement in ability  to perform home or y ard 
work, ability  to perform recreational activities and overall satisfaction with joint replacement.

Page 23Average pain in the joint to be replaced (pre -surgery ) and the replaced joint (post -surgery ) 
will be assessed with an 11- point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) rang ing from zero (no pain) 
to 10 (worst possible pain). The validity  and reliability  of the scale has been demonstrated.14
The functional measures chosen for this stud y were those which have been shown to be valid , 
reliable and sensitive and in addition were region- specific and eas y to administer.  Subject s 
undergoing total knee or hip replacement will be asked to complete the Western Ontario and 
McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis I ndex (WOMAC) with the knee or h ip that will be or 
was replaced serving as the “index joint”.  Subject s undergoing total shoulder replacement 
will be asked to complete the Shoulder Pain and Disability  Index (SPADI).
The WOMAC is a self -administered condition- specific instrument which assesses pain, 
disability  and joint stiffness in knee and hip osteoarthritis.  I t is a valid, reliable and 
responsive measure of outcome in subject s with arthritis and has been used extensively .12,15,16
The SPADI is a self -administered questionnaire that was developed to measure the pain and 
disability  associated with shoulder pathology  in people with shoulder pain of 
musculoskeletal, neuroge nic or undetermined origin.  The psy chometric properties of the 
SPADI  have been shown to be acceptable for research use and the SPADI has been 
recommended to assess outcomes in subject s undergoing shoulder arthroplasty .17,18The 
instrument consists of two dimensions (pain and function).  The pain dimension consists of 
five questions regarding the severit y of an individual’s pain.  Functional activities are 
assessed with eight questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty  an individual has 
with various activities of daily  living that require upper extremity  use.
For each of the selected subject reported outcome measures t here are data available in the 
literature .These data will be utilized to contextualize the results of this study.
1.2.5.1. Interactive Web Response System
To avoid a social desirability  bias in the subject reported outcomes, an Interactive Web 
Response Sy stem (IWRS) will be utilized in this study.   Contingency  plans w ill be in place to 
address s ystem and/ or connectivity  issues with the I WRS. 
However, eligibility  for this study  does not require access to the internet via a desktop, laptop 
or tablet computer so, for those subject s without access to the internet via a de sktop, laptop or 
tablet computer , paper versions of the assessments will be utilized .Though not optimal, the 
use of two methods to collect subject reported outcomes will maximize the ability  tocapture
information from allsubject s who undergo a total kn ee, hip, or shoulder replacement surgery  
while participating in tanezumab Study  A4091056, A4091057 or A4091058 .Additional 
considerations which mitigate the concerns about using two methods to collect subject
reported outcomes in the sa me study  include th at this study  has not been formally  powered 
and all anal yses will be descriptive rather than inferential.

Page 241.2.6. Summary of Benefit and Risks to Subjects Enrolled in Study A4091064
There is no treatment benefit to subjects participating in Study  A4091064 however subjects 
may derive benefit from the increased post -surgery medical oversight dictated by  this study .
In addition, information from this study  may  benefit future patients who receive tanezumab.  
A detailed discussion of the risks of tanezumab is provided in Section 7 of the Investigator’s 
Brochure.  Because no investigational product is administered in Study  A4091064, the 
anticipated investigational product- related risk to subjects participating in Study  A4091064 is 
considered low.  However, female subject s who are of childbearing potential and are sexuall y 
active and who withdraw from an y of the tanezumab studies less than 16 weeks after the last 
dose of subcutaneous investigational product need to use acceptable method sof 
contraception due to the potenti al risk of adverse effects on the fetus if they become 
pregnant.  Finally , although it is considered unlikely  given the number of subjects who have 
been treated with tanezumab to date, it cannot be excluded that some adverse effects of the 
treatment may  become evident after the last administration of the investigational product.
The increased post -surgery  medical oversight dictated by  this study  should facilitate 
recognition of such events if they  occur.
Complete information for tanezumab may be found in t he Single Reference Safety  Document 
(SRSD), which for this study  is the Investigator’s Brochure.

3.STUDY DESIGN
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, long -term observational study  of subjects from tanezumab 
Study  A4091056, A4091057 or A4091058 (regardless of treatment group) who undergo a 
total knee, hi p or shoulder replacement during participation in the study (treatment period or 
safet y follow- up period) .  If while the subject is participating in this study  (A4091064), the 
subject undergoes an additional total joint replacement surgery  or the site beco mes aware that 
an additional total joint replacement surgery  has been scheduled for the subject, the subject 
will be requested to provide information on the additional total joint replacement surgery  as 
well. Finally , any subject with a qualifying total j oint replacement after the last subject in the 
study  completes the treatment period in studies A4091059, A4091061 or A4091063 may be 
followed in this study  (A4091064). 
This study  is designed with a total duration of subject follow -up of 24 weeks after the total 
joint replacement surgery.  There will be two methods of data collection utilized in this 
study : interview b y site staff via the telephone and IWRSaccessed b y desktop, laptop or 
tablet computer (or paper if the subject has no access to the internet via a desktop, laptop or 
tablet computer ).  Following the surgery , the subject will be contacted monthly  via telephone 
by study  site personnel to ascertain whether the subject has experienced any  adverse events 
and to record an y concomitant analgesic medi cations the subject is taking as well as the 
reason for the medication use.  An assessment of the subject ’s overall satisfaction with their 
total joint replacement (IWRS ), average pain in the replaced joint (I WRS ), the subject ’s level 
of function and activ ity in the replaced joint (I WRS ) and phy sical rehabilitation activities 
(telephone interview ) will be made at Weeks 4, 12 and 24.  At Weeks 12 and 24, subject s 
will be queried during the telephone interview as to whether an y additional or corrective 
proced ures related to the total joint replacement are planned.

Page 26Any subject who expresses a desire to leave this study  before 24 weeks of follow -up have 
been completed should be asked to complete all assessments scheduled for Week 24.
All events of total knee, h ip or shoulder replacement will be reviewed b y the Joint Safety 
Adjudication Committee (Adjudication Committee) established for the tanezumab clinical 
program.  This Committee will adjudicate in an independent and blinded fashion if the event 
is primary  osteonecrosis, worsening OA (further sub -divided into rapidly  progressive OA 
[RPOA ]type1 or t ype2, normal progression of OA or not enough information to distinguish 
between RPOA and normal progression of OA), subchondral insufficiency  fracture, 
pathologic fracture, other (with diagnosis specified) or not enough information to specify  a 
diagnosis.  Prior to the Adjudication Committee’s review of a given event, Committee
members will be provided with blinded, available source documentatio n of progress report s 
from the i nvestigator, orthopedic consult reports, operative reports, the pathology  report from 
the central laboratory , radiology  reports, Dual Energ y X-ray Absorptiometry  (DXA ) reports, 
x-ray images and magnetic resonance images (MRI) for review.  Sites will be requested to 
submit required source documentation to the Endpoint Management Team as soon as 
possible and ideally  within 29 5days after the total joint replacement surgery  (ie, b y the 
time the Week 4 visit occurs). In addition, blinded summaries of the following data from the 
parent stud y (A4091056, A4091057, A4091058 or other studies) will be provided to the 
Committee members for review for each event undergoing adjudication : demographic and 
baseline characteristics, medical history  and concomitant medications, investigational 
product administration, non- drug treatments, subject disposition, efficacy  data, adverse event 
information, neurological safet y data and a serious adverse event narrative (if applicable).  
The Adjudication Committee, in c oordination with the Data Monitoring Committee
(E-D MC), is responsible for ongoing anal ysis of these outcomes and for informing the 
sponsor of recommendations made.

total joint replacement) will be allowed, but subject s undergoing solel y sub -total 
arthroplastic procedures (eg, hemi -arthroplasty ) will not be eligible.
4.Subject is willing and able to comply with scheduled visits and other study  
procedures. 
4.2.Life Style Guidelines 
All female subjects who are of childbearing pote ntial and are sexuall y active and at risk for 
pregnancy ,and who withdraw from Study A4091056, A4091057 A409105 8, or other 
tanezumab study less than 16 weeks after the last dose of subcutaneous investigational 
product must agree to use two (2) methods of h ighly  effective contraception consistently  and 
correctly until 112 days (16 weeks) after the last dose of subcutaneous investigational 
product .  The investigator or his/ or her designee, in consultation with the subject, will 
confirm the subject has select ed the most appropriate forms of contraception for the 
individual subject from the permitted list of contraception methods (see below) , and instruct
the subject in their consistent and correct use.  Subjects need to affirm that they  meet the 
criteria for c orrect use of at least two of the selected methods of contraception.  The 
investigator or his/her designee will discuss with the subject the need to use highly  effective 
contraception consistently and correctl y according to the schedule of activities and d ocument 
such conversation in the subject’s chart.   In addition, the Investigator or his/ or her designee
will instruct the subject to call immediately  if the selected birth control method sare
discontinued or if pregnancy  is known or suspected in the subje ct.
Highly  effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie, perfect use) and 
include:
1.Established use of oral, inserted, injected ,implan tedor transdermal hormonal 
methods of contraception isallowed provided the subject remains on the same 
treatment throughout the entire study  and has been using that hormonal contraceptive 
for an adequate period of time to ensure effectiveness.
2.Correctl y placed copper -containing intrauterine device (IUD). 
3.Male condom or female condom used WI TH a spermicide (ie, foam, gel, film, cream, 
or suppository ).For countries where spermicide is not available or condom plus 
spermicide is not accepted as highly  effective contraception, this option is not 
appropriate.

Page 296.STUDY PROCEDURES
Study  visit windows are +10 days for activities related to the total joint replacement surgery  
and5days for activities performed on Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24.  Site staff should 
make every  effort to contact the subject within the protocol defined visit window for 
Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 however, data obtained outside of the visit window while a 
protocol deviation, should still be recorded. In the event that the activities related to a visit 
are performed within the extremes of the visit wind ows, following study  visits and associated 
activities should be scheduled with reference to the total joint replacement surgery  date.  
Subject scheduling issues should be brought to the attention of the assigned study  monitor or 
study  clinician for resolut ion.
The i nvestigator must make sure that delegations of responsibility  to site staff for 
administering the I WRS or entering data into the IWRS are specificall y documented using 
the appropriate forms and are based on documented evidence of adequate traini ng in 
administration and use of th e IWRS.  The investigator (or other site staff specificall y 
delegated b y the investigator) is responsible for regular monitoring of the compliance of the 
subject s with the required data entry  by means of reports in the I WRS.  The I WRS will also 
be programmed to notify  designated site staff when data has not been recorded within the 
requested timeframe.   Regardless of how the i nvestigator delegates responsibility  for 
administering the I WRS or en tering data into the IWRS, the investigator remains responsible 
for providing adequate supervision and oversi ght of the i nvestigator’s colleagues, emplo yees 
and an y third parties as per FDA regulations and guidelines and Good Clinical Practice.
6.1.Baseline Visit
Baseline information for t his study  should be obtained as close as possible to, and prior to, 
the total joint replacement surgery .  The Baseline Visit may  coincide with the last visit in 
Study  A4091056, A4091057 or A4091058 (End of Study  or Earl y Termination Visit) or 
occur when th e site is notified of a planned total joint replacement surgery . If a total joint 
replacement occurs or is scheduled to occur after the last subject in the study  completes the 
treatment period in Study A4091059, A4091061 or A4091063 baseline activities c ould be 
conducted at either the end of study  visit or at the earl y termination visit in Study  A4091059, 
A4091061 or A4091063.  Baseline Visit activities must be conducted at the clinical site. 
Subject s should be queried about their access to the internet via a desktop, laptop or tablet 
computer so as to determine the appropriate format for the subject reported outcomes of pain 
in the joint to be (or post- surgery , that has been) replaced, functional status and, post- surgery , 
satisfaction with surgery . 
Subje cts with access to the internet via a desktop, laptop or tablet computer should be trained 
in the use of the ePRO s ystem ( IWRS)and in their responsibilities for data entry  in 
compliance with the protocol. IWRS technical support (Help Desk) will be availa ble to the 
subject for the duration of the study .Beginning with the Baseline Visit, subject s with access 
to the internet via a desktop, laptop or tablet computer should complete the aforementioned 
assessments via the IWRS.  In the event of internet conne ctivity  issues at the Baseline Visit, 
paper versions of the assessments should be completed.

6.9.Subject Withdrawal /Early Termination 
Subject s may  withdraw from the study  at any  time at their own request, or they  may  be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the i nvestigator or Sponsor for safety  or behavioral 
reasons, or the inability  of the subject to compl y with the protocol requi red schedule of stud y 
visits or procedures at a given study  site. 
If a subject cannot be contacted within the window for a scheduled visit, every  effort should 
be made to contact the subject outside of the visit window.  A subject thought lost to 
follow -up, must be contact ed through a minimum of 3 documented phone call attempts and, 
if phone calls are unsuccessful, a certified letter sent to the subject . All attempts to contact 
the subject and information received during the contact attempts must be docum ented in the 
subject ’s medical records. In any circumstance, every  effort should be made to document the 
subject ’s outcome, if possible .  The i nvestigator should inquire about the reason for 
withdrawal, request that the subject return for a final visit, i f applicable, and follow -up with 
the subject regarding an y unresolved adverse events (AEs).
If the subject is willing, the investigator should query  for any  new adverse events, query  
about concomitant analgesic medication use, physical rehabilitation activ ities or corrective 
procedures related to the joint replacement surgery and request that the subject complete the 
following assessments via the IWRSor via paper, as established at the Baseline Visit: 
Pain in Replaced Joint (11 -point NRS) .

withdrawal of consent.
7.ASSESSMENTS
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required procedures are completed as 
described. However it is anticipated that from time to time there may  be circumstances,
outsid e of the control of the i nvestigator, that may  make i t unfeasible to perform a procedure . 
In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary  to ensure the safe ty and well -
being of the subject . When a protocol require d procedure cannot be performed the
investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that
heor she has taken to ensure that normal processes ar e adhered to as soon as possible. The 
study  team will be informed of these incidents in a timely  fashion.
7.1.Surgeon’s Assessment of Procedural Difficulty
Following the total joint replacement surgery , the orthopedic surgeon performing the surgery  
will be asked to answer the following question:
“Taking into consideration the subject ’s medical history  and ph ysical condition prior to 
surgery  would y ou classify  the operative procedure as:
1.Uneventful; or 
2.Minor complications; or
3.Major complications.
If the category  of minor or major complications is chosen, the surgeon will be requested to 
specify  the complication(s).
7.2.Pathology Specimens
Surgeons will be requested to ship pathology  specimens from the total joint replacement 
surgery  to a central laboratory  for processing and/or anal ysis.  Detailed instructions for the 
shipping of pathology  specimens will be provided. Identification of specimens of adequate 
quality , preparation and histopathologic examination of the specimens will be performed in a 
standardized mann er by the central laboratory  under the direction of an expert orthopedic 
pathologist.

severe intensit y. 
A neurological adverse event which is non- neuropathic (eg, stroke, seizure) but which 
the investigator considers medically  important should also result in a neurological 
consultation.
In these cases, a neurologic evaluation should be obtained as soon as possible after these 
signs and sy mptoms are known.  The results of the neurological consultation will be recorded 
on the appropriate CRF and adverse event (if applicable) forms . Adverse events will be 
reported where applicable as described in Section 8.
Subject s reporting adverse events (any seriousness or severit y) with preferred terms of 
bradycardia, s yncope, orthostatic hy potension, anhidrosis or hy pohidrosis should be further 
evaluated for the presence of s ympathetic autonomic neuropathy by a car diologist or 
neurologist as soon as possible . 
The investigator should determine the appropriate ty pe of consultation (neurology  or 
cardiolog y) depending on the subject’s s ymptom presentation and the investigator’s 
assessment as to the specialist best abl e to evaluate the subject.  Pfizer will provide a 
guidance document which outlines appropriate recommendations regarding tests to consider 
for subject work -up.
7.3.2. Concomitant Analgesic Medication
At each post -surgery  telephone contact, subject s will be queried about concomitant analgesic 
medication usage including dose, dosing regimen and reason for use. This information 
should be recorded on the appropriate case report form (CRF).

rehabilitation activities related to the replaced joint.  Specificall y, subject s will be asked to 
respond yes or no to the following question:
Are you participating in physical rehabilitation activities related t o your replaced 
joint?
Subject s will be queried for details if the answer to the question is y es.This information 
should be recorded on the appropriate case report form (CRF).
7.3.4. Additional or Corrective Procedures
At the Week 12 and 24 post -surgery  telepho ne contacts, subject s will be queried for 
additional or corrective procedures related to the total joint replacement surgery .  
Specificall y, subject s will be asked to respond y es or no to the following question:
Have you been told by your orthopedic surgeo n that additional or corrective 
procedures (for example a revision or implant replacement) are necessary  for y our 
total joint replacement?
Subject s will be queried for details if the answer to the question is y es. If necessary , the 
orthopedic surgeon may  be contacted to confirm/expand upon the information regarding 
additional or corrective procedures. This information should be recorded on the appropriate 
case report form (CRF).
7.4.Web -based Assessments
7.4.1. Overall Satisfaction with Surgery
The Self -Administered Patient Satisfaction Scale (SAPS) evaluates subject satisfaction with 
the outcome of hip and knee arthroplasty  and was designed to be used in conjunction with 
other clinical measures and functional health status instruments to evaluate the results of hip 
and knee arthroplast y. 
The scale consists of four items focusing on satisfaction with the extent of pain relief, 
improvement in ability  to perform home or yard work, ability  to perform recreational 
activities and overall satisfaction with joint replacemen t. 
Specificall y, subject s will be asked to respond to the following questions:
How satisfied are you with the results of your surgery ?
How satisfied are you with the results of your surgery  for improving your pain?
How satisfied are you with the results of surgery  for improv ing y our ability to do 
home or yard work?

Page 38How satisfied are you with the results of surgery for improving y our abilit y to do 
recreational activities?
Items are scored on a 4 -point L ikert scale with response categories consisting of ‘ver y 
satisfied’ (100 points), ‘somewhat satisfied’ (75 points), ‘somewhat dissatisfied’ (50 points), 
and ‘very  dissatisfied’ (25 points). The scale score is the unweighted mean of the scores 
from the individual items, ranging from 25 to 100 per item with hig her scores indicating 
greater satisfaction.
Subject s will be requested to complete the SAPS at Weeks 4, 12, and 24 either via the IWRS
or by  paper if the subject does not have access to the internet via a desktop, laptop or tablet 
computer .  When completed on paper, the subject will be requested to return the assessment 
to the site as soon as possible, but no later than 5 days, after completion of the assessment .
7.4.2. Pain in Replaced Joint
Average pain in the joint to be replaced (pre -surgery ) and average pain in the replaced joint 
(post -surgery ) will be assessed with an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) ranging from 
zero (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain).
Question:
Select the number that best describes your average pain in the (joint to be replaced or 
replaced joint) the past 24 hours. 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

At Baseline and at Weeks 4, 12 and 24 following total joint replacement surgery , subject s 
will be asked to indicate their average pain in t he joint to be replaced (pre -surgery ) or the 
replaced joint (post -surgery )via the IWRS or by  paper if the subject does not have access to 
the internet via a desktop, laptop or tablet computer .  When completed on paper, the subject
will be requested to ret urn the assessment to the site as soon as possible, but no later than 
5days, after completion of the assessment.
7.4.3. Assessment of Functional Activity 
Subject s undergoing total knee or hip replacement will be asked to complete the Western 
Ontario and McMaste r Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) with the knee or hip that 
will be or was replaced serving as the “index joint”.  Subject s undergoing total shoulder 
replacement will be asked to complete the Shoulder Pain and Disability  Index (SPADI).

Page 397.4.3.1. WOMAC
Subject s who will be proceeding to total knee or hip arthroplasty  will be requested to 
complete all subscales of the WOMAC (ie,pain, phy sical function and s tiffness) at Baseline 
and Weeks 4, 12, and 24 following total joint replacement surgery  either via the IWRS or by 
paper if the subject does not have access to the internet via a desktop, laptop or tablet 
computer .  When completed on paper, the subject will be requested to return the assessment 
to the si te as soon as possible, but no later than 5 days, after completion of the assessment .
7.4.3.1.1. WOMAC Pain Subscale
The WOMAC Pain subscale is comprised of 5 questions regarding the amount of pain 
experienced due to OA in the index joint (selected study knee or hip) in the past 48 hours. 
For this study, the index joint (selected study knee or hip) is defined as the joint to be or 
that has been replaced.  This may or may not have been the index joint in Study 
A4091056, A4091057 or A4091058.   The WOMAC Pain subscale is calculated as the mean 
of the scores from the five individual questions, which may not be a whole (integer) number.  
The WOMAC Pain subscale NRS scores for each question, and the WOMAC Pain subscale 
score, range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating higher pain.
7.4.3.1.2. WOMAC Physical Function Subscale
The WOMAC Phy sical Function subscale is comprised of 17 questions regarding the degree 
of difficulty  experienced due to arthritis in the index joint (selected study  knee or hip) in the 
past 48 hours.  For th is study, the index joint (selected study knee or hip) is defined as 
the joint to be or that has been replaced.  This may or may not have been the index joint 
in Study A4091056, A4091057 or A4091058.  The WOMAC Phy sical Function subscale is 
calculated as t he mean of the scores from the seventeen individual questions, which may  not 
be a whole (integer) number.  The WOMAC Phy sical Function subscale NRS scores for each 
question, and the WOMAC Phy sical Function subscale score, range from 0 to 10 with higher 
scores indicating worse function.  This refers to the subject 's ability  to move around and 
perform usual activities of daily  living.
7.4.3.1.3. WOMAC Stiffness Subscale
The WOMAC Stiffness subscale is comprised of 2 questions regarding the amount of 
stiffness experience d in the index joint (selected study  knee or hip) in the past 48 hours.  For 
this study, the index joint (selected study knee or hip) is defined as the joint to be or 
that has been replaced.  This may or may not have been the index joint in Study 
A4091056, A4091057 or A4091058.  The WOMAC Stiffness subscale is calculated as the 
mean of the scores from the two individual questions, which may  not be a whole (integer) 
number.  The WOMAC Stiffness subscale NRS scores for each question, and the WOMAC 
Stiffness s ubscale score, range from 0 to 10 with higher scores indicating more stiffness.  
Stiffness is defined as a sensation of decreased ease with which the subject moves the index 
knee or hip.
A cop y of the WOMAC can be found in Appendix 1.

Page 407.4.3.2. The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI)
Subject s who will be proceeding to shoulder arthroplasty will be requested to complete both 
dimensions of the SPADI (ie,pain and function) at Baseline and at Weeks 4, 12, and 24 
follow ing total joint replacement surgery  either via the IWRS or by paper if the subject does 
not have access to the internet via a desktop, laptop or tablet computer .  When completed on 
paper, the subject will be requested to return the assessment to the site as soon as possible, 
but no later than 5 days, after completion of the assessment .
The SPADI  consists of two dimensions (pain and function).  The pain dimension consists of 
five questions regarding the severit y of an individual’s pain.  Functional activitie s are 
assessed with eight questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty  an individual has 
with various activities of daily  living that require upper extremity  use. The scores from both 
dimensions are averaged to derive a total score from 0 (best) to 100 (worst).
A cop y of the SPADI can be found in Appendix 2.
8.ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
8.1.Adverse Events (AEs)
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following 
sections. 
For all AEs , the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine 
the outcome of the AEand to assess whether it meets the criteria for classifi cation as a 
serious adverse event ( SAE ) requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated 
representative.  For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by  the investigator to 
determine the causality  of the AE.  The investigator is requ ired to assess causality .  
Follow -up by  the investigator may  be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or 
stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b ythe Sponsor, any  nonserious AE that is 
determined b y the Sponsor to be serious will be reported by the Sponsor as a n SAE .  To 
assist in the determination of case seriousness further information may  be requested from the 
investigator to provide clarity  and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study . 
8.2.Reporting Period
Subjects entering study  A4091064 may  have left Study A4091056, A4091057 or A4091058 
at variable intervals relative to the last dose of subcutaneous investigational product in Study  
A4091056, A4091057 or A4091058. 
There is no investigational product administered in study  A4091064.

Final Protocol Amendment 1, 06 January 2016
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 41Thereporting requirements for Study  A4091056, A4091057 and A4091058 are as follows:
For SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its des ignated representative begins 
from the time that the subject provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to 
the subject’s participation in the study , ie, prior to undergoing an y stud y-related 
procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through the end of the safet y 
Follow up period or through and including 112 calendar days after the subject’s last 
administration of the subcutaneous investigational medication if the subject refuses 
the protocol defined Follow up period.
Serious adverse events occurring to a subject after the active reporting period has 
ended should be reported to the Sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them; at 
a minimum, all serious adverse events that the investigator believes have at least a 
reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug are to be reported to the Sponsor.
AEs (serious and non -serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the 
subject has taken at least one dose of study  treatment through last subject visit. 
SAEs should be reported to t he respective parent study  A4091056 / A4091057 / A4091058 
using the Clinical Trial SAE Report Form (see Section 8.12.1 of the parent study  protocol).
An AE/SAE should be recorded on the A4091064 CRF from the time the subject has signed 
the informed consent document through last subject visit in study A4091064.
8.3.Definition of an Adverse Event
An AEis an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
product or medical device; the event need not necessarily  have a causal rela tionship with the 
treatment or usage.  Examples of AEs include but are not limited to: 
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in physical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progression/worsening of underl ying disea se
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , they  may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;

Page 42Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy ;
Exposure via breastfeeding ;
Medication error ;
Occupational e xposure.
8.4.Medication Errors
Medication errors may  result, in this study , from the administration or consumption of the 
wrong product , by the wrong subject, at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength.  
Such medication errors occurring to a stud y participant are to be captured on the medication 
error CRF which is a specific version of the AEpage, and on the SAE form when 
appropriate.  In the event of medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified 
immediately .
Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject.
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  an AE, as determined by  the 
investigator, the medication error iscaptured on the medication erro r version of the AE page 
and, if applicable, any associated AE(s) are capt ured on an AE CRF page.
8.5.Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an AEare as follows: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires addition al diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention ;
and/or
Tanezumab

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 43Test result leads to a change in study  dosing or discontinuation from the study , 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therap y;and/or
Test result is considered to be an AEby the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
reporting as an AE.
8.6.Serious Adverse Events
Anserious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence at an y dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires in subject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.
Medical and scientific judgment isexercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical eve nt.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospitalization.  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; 
or development of d rug dependency  or drug abuse.
8.6.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events 
There are no protoco l-specified SAEs in this study . All SAEs will be reported by  the 
investigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safet y 
databas e (see the Section onSerious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements ) 
8.6.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury 
Liver function tests ( LFTs) are not required as a routine safet y monitoring procedure in this 
study .  However, should an investigator deem it necessary  to run LFTs because of clinical 
sign/sy mptom presentation in a subject , such L FT results should be handled and followed up 
as described below.

Page 44Abnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin that meet the criteria outlined below in 
the absence of other causes of liver injury  are considered potential cases of drug- induced 
liver injury  (potential Hy’s Law cases ) and should alway s be considered important medical 
events. 
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug- induced liver injury  
depends on the subject’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions. Subjects who 
present wi th the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory values:
Subjects with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range 
who subsequently  present wi th AST or AL T 3times the upper limit of normal 
(xULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin 2 xULN with no evidence of hemoly sis 
and an alkaline phosphatase 2 xULN or not available .
For subjects with preexisting AL TORAST ORtotal bilirubin values abov e the 
upper limit of normal, the following threshold values should be used in the definition 
mentioned above:
For subjects with pre -existing AST or AL T baseline values above the normal 
range: AST or ALT  2times the baseline values and  3 xULN, or 8 xULN 
(whichever is smaller).
Concurrent with
For subjects with pre -existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: 
Total bilirubin level increased from baseline by an amount of at least 1x ULN
or3normal ULN (whichever is smaller).
The subject should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should 
include laboratory  tests, detailed history  and phy sical assessment.  In addition to rep eating 
AST and ALT, laboratory  tests should include albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct 
and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutamy l transferase, prothrombin time (PT)/ international 
normalized ratio ( INR), and alkaline phosphatase.  A detailed his tory, including relevant 
information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen , recreational drug and supplement 
consumption, family  history , occupational exposure, sexual history , travel history , history  of 
contact with a jaundiced person , surgery , blood transfusion, history  of liver or allergic 
disease, and work exposure, should be collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or 
C infection and liver imaging ( eg, biliary  tract) may  be warranted. All cases confirmed on 
repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria defined above , with no other cause for L FT 
abnormalities identified at the time should be considered potential Hy ’s Law cases 
irrespective of availability  of all the results of the investigations performed to determine 
etiology  of the abnormal LFTs.  Such potential Hy’s Law cases should be reported as SAEs.

Page 458.7.Hospitalization
Hospitalization is defined as an y initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospital or 
equivalent healthcare facility  or any  prolongation of an existing admission.  Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, or neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).  An emergency  room visit does not necessaril y constitute a hospitalization; 
however, the event leading to the emergency  room visit should be assessed for medical 
importance.
Hospitalization does not include the following:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospice facilities;
Respite care (eg,caregiver relief);
Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing homes;
Same day  surgeries (as out patient /same day /ambulatory  procedures).
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical 
AEis not in itself a nSAE .  Examples include: 
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AEor with a worsening of the preexisting condition ( eg, for 
work -up of persistent pre- treatment lab abnormality);
Social admission ( eg, subject has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission ( eg,for yearly physical exam ination );
Protocol -specified admission during a study  (eg,for a procedure required by  the study  
protocol);
Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE(eg,for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;
Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures .These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject .

A4091064
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 06 January 2016
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 46Diagnostic and therapeutic non -invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as AEs .  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acu te appendicitis 
that begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting 
appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the AE.
8.8.Severity Assessment
If required on the AEcase report forms (CRFs) , the investigator will use the adjectives 
MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the AE.  For 
purposes of consistency , these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function.
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE .  For example, a headache may  be severe (inter feres significantly with 
subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAE s, listed above.
8.9.Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
nonserious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, 
and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements if 
applicable.  An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of wheth er there 
exists a reasonable possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an 
AE; generally  the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be 
provided.  If the investigator does not know whether or not theinvestigational product caused 
the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting 
purposes, as defined b y the Sponsor (see the Section on Reporting Requirements ).  If t he 
investigator's causalit y assessment is "unknown but not related to investigational product", 
this should be clearl y documented on study records. 
In addition, if the investigator determines an SAE is associated with study  procedures, the 
investigator mu st record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable.
8.10. Exposure During Pregnancy (EDP)
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  occurs if:
1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having 
been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product; or the female be comes or is found to be pregnant after 
discontinuing and/or being exposed to the investigational product; 
Tanezumab
A4091064
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 06 January 2016
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 47An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact 
with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
2.A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to 
the investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is 
exposed during his partner’s pr egnancy . 
If a stud y subject or study subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study  subject’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this 
information to the Pfizer Drug Safet y Unit on a nSAE report form and an EDP supplemental 
form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred .  In addition, the investigator must submit 
information regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a 
subject reports that she is pregnant and ha s been exposed to a cy totoxic product by  inhalation 
or spillage) using the EDP supplemental form .  This must be done irrespective of whether an 
AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The information 
submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for information related 
to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDPreports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow t he pregnancy until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up 
to the initial E DP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity  of the 
neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for 
termination should be specified and, if clinicall y possible, the structural integrity  of the 
terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless preprocedure test 
findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscar riage and missed abortion.
Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard 
to causality , as SAEs.  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as 
SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly  related to 
exposure to theinvestigational product .
Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requested by  the investigator.  Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm i nfants to identify  developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the study  subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information 
Form to deliver to his partner.  The Investigator must document in the source documents that 
the subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his 
partner.

Page 488.10.1. Additional Post -Natal Follow- up
The Investigator will be asked to assist with collection of assessments of postnatal 
development as part of a sepa rate protocol.  Participation in that protocol is optional and will 
require that the subject review, agree and sign a separate informed consent document specific 
to that study , explaining the details of the post- partum follow -up for the subject and the 
newborn to participate in these assessments of postnatal development.
8.11. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the 
product, which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safet y unit within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness, using the SAE report form, regardless of whether there is an 
associated AE /SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , 
the information is not reported on a CRF; however, a copy  of the completed SAE report form 
is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.12. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See Also the Section on Subject
Withdrawal /Early Termination )
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and recorded on the appr opriate AECRF 
page. 
When a subject withdraws due to anSAE , the SAE must be reported in accordance with the 
reporting requirements defined below.
8.13. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  reported b y 
the study  subject .  In addition, each study  subject will be questioned about AEs.
8.14. Reporting Requirements
Each AEis to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAE s.  If a nSAE occurs, 
expedited reporting will follow loca l and international regulations, as appropriate.
8.14.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If anSAE occurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24 hours of investigator awareness of the 
event .
In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, notifi cation to Pfizer must be made 
immediately , irrespective of the extent of available AEinformation.  This time frame also 
applies to additional new information (follow- up) on previously  forwarded SAE reports as 
well as to the initial and follow- up reporting of EDP, exposure via breastfeeding cases and 
occuptational exposure cases.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 49In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a nSAE
immediately  (eg, if an outpatient study  subject initially  seeks treatment elsewhere), the
investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time 
of his/her first awareness of the AE .
For all SAE s, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to Pfizer in 
accordance with the time frames for reporting specified above.  In addition, an investigator 
may be requested by  Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow -up information in an 
expedited fashion.  This i nformation collected for SAE sismore detailed than that captured 
on the AE CRF .  In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of 
possible causality .  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant 
medications, vaccines and/orillnesses must be provided.  I n the case of a subject death, a 
summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its 
designated representative. 
8.14.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requireme nts
All AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF.  I t should be noted that the form for 
collection of SAE information is not the same as the AECRF.  Where the same data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For examp le, the same AE
term should be used on both forms.  AEs should be reported using concise medical 
terminology  on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information.
8.14.3. Sponsor ’sReporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
Adverse event reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be 
carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed methodolog y for the summary  and descriptive analyses of the data collected in this 
study  will be documented in a Statistical Analy sis Plan, which will be maintained by  the 
sponsor.  This document may  modify  the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any  major 
modifications of the planned anal yses will also be reflected in a protoco l amendment.
9.1.Sample Size Determination
This study  is designed to collect information sufficient to describe the post -operative 
outcome of subject s who underwent a total knee, hip, or shoulder replacement while 
participating in tanezumab Study  A4091056, A4091057 or A4091058 (treatment or safet y 
follow -up period) .  In addition subject s with a qualify ing total joint replacement after the last 
subject in the study  completes the treatment period in StudyA4091059, A4091061 or 
A4091063 may be included.   The numbe r of subject s who will enroll in this study  is 
unknown but is estimated to be less than 2 50subject s. Also unknown is the distribution of 
subject s across treatment groups (i e,the treatment given in Study  A4091056, A4090157, 
A4091058, or other tanezumab study).Therefore, it is predicted that there will be 
insufficient statistical power to perform statistical inferential analy ses.  All anal yses will be 
descriptive in nature.

Page 509.2.Analysis of Endpoints
All subject s enrolled in the study  who have a total joint r eplacement will be included in the 
summary  tables. 
A summary  of data will be shown using subject s from study  A4091058.  The incidence of 
subject s with a total joint replacement will be summarized for all subject s, and split by  Study  
A4091058 treatment gro up.  These summaries will be shown as percentages, and for 
exposure -adjusted rates (using Study  A4091058 treatment and follow- up period up to the 
time of surgery ).  Comparisons of the total joint replacement rates will be made between 
tanezumab versus acti ve comparator treatment groups, using risk differences and ratios with 
95% confidence intervals.   Summaries of the time to total joint replacement surgery  and time 
to first sy mptom (leading to total joint replacement surgery) will be summarized using 
Kapla n-Meier survival estimates from the date of first subcutaneous dose in Study  
A4091058, and shown overall, and split by  Study A4091058 treatment group where there are 
sufficient numbers of subjects .  A further summary  of the incidence of subjects with total
joint replacements will be shown separatel y for studies A4091056, A4091057, A4091059 , 
A4091061 and A409106 3, if applicable .  Similar summaries by  study  will be shown for 
adjudication outcomes.   The summary  of time to total joint replacement surgery  and ti me to 
first sy mptom (leading to total joint replacement surgery ) will also be performed using data 
for subjects from Studies A4091056 and A4091057.
Unless otherwise stated, data from this study  will be presented at Baseline and Weeks 4, 12, 
and 24 using ob served data (no imputation for missing data), and at Week 24 using L ast 
Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) for missing data.  Data will be shown at the timepoints 
specified and also using change from (pre- surgery) Baseline when Baseline data are available 
and where relevant.  Data will be shown overall, and split by  treatment group.   Data on 
surgical difficult y and outcomes, and subject safety  data will be summarized by  study , with 
an additional combined summary  for the subject s from the osteoarthritis stud ies.
For the Surgeon’s Assessment of Procedural Difficulty , the number and percentage of 
subject s in each category (Uneventful, Minor complications, Major complications) will be 
presented.  Complications reported by  the surgeon will be listed. 
For the subject’s overall satisfaction with surgery  assessments (using the Self -Administered 
Patient S atisfaction scale, SAPS), the responses [score] for each category  (Very  Satisfied 
[100], Somewhat Satisfied [75], Somewhat Dissatisfied [50], Very  Dissatisfied [25]) will be 
stratified by  surgery  type (hip, knee or shoulder) and summarized for each of the four items. 
The scale score is the unweighted mean of the scores from the individual items, ranging from 
25 to 100 per item with higher scores indicating greater sa tisfaction. This total score will be 
stratified by  surgery  type (hip, knee or shoulder) and summarized. Reponses to the question 
“How satisfied are you with the results of your surgery ?” will also be stratified by  surgery  
type (hip, knee or shoulder) and summarized as satisfied (very  satisfied and somewhat 
satisfied categories combined) and dissatisfied (somewhat dissatisfied and very  dissatisfied 
categories combined).

Page 51Similarly , the number and percentage of subject s who have required (i) additional or 
corrective procedures related to their total joint replacement and (ii) participating in phy sical 
rehabilitation activities related to their replaced joint will be presented.  For these 
assessments, change from Baseline summary  data are not relevant and will not be presented.
Average pain (NRS) in the replaced joint for all subject s, WOMAC Pain, Stiffness and 
Physical Function sub- scale scores for subject s who had total knee or h ip replacement and 
SPADI  Pain, Function and Total S core for subject s who had tota l shoulder replacement will 
be summarized (including change from Baseline summaries).
Adverse events and concomitant analgesic medications will be collected for each subject
during the study  according to the Schedule of Assessments. Standard safet y report ing tables 
will summarize and list these safety  data.
In addition, t he number and percent of subject s with specified post -surgical complications 
will be presented. The list of post -surgical complications will be derived from reported 
adverse events and will consist of complications that are clinically  significant and attributable 
to the total arthroplasty  procedure e g,periprosthetic joint infection/wound infection, 
periprosthetic fracture, pulmonary  embolism or sepsis/septicemia/shock.  Literature reported 
analyses of post -surgical complications19,20will be used for guidance in developing the list of 
post-surgical complications. The list of post- surgical complications will be developed during 
Study  A4091064 and finalized prior to Study  A4091058 database lock. 
Separate adverse event summaries by  parent study treatment group for adverse events of 
decreased s ympathetic function will be presented . 
For subjects from study  A4091058 and for subjects from an y of the osteoarthtitis studies, 
summaries of total joint replacement, adjudication event rates and post- surgical outcomes 
will be shown for subgroups including age, gender, body -mass index (BMI), baseline 
Kellgren- Lawrence grade of the replaced joint (knees and hips onl y) and number of joints 
with OA.
9.3.Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)
This study  will use an external data monitoring committee (EDMC ). 
An independent, E-DMChas been re-instituted for the tanezumab clinical program.   This 
committee will be composed of at least one rheumatologist, neurologist, statistician, and 
epidemiologist.   The E-DMC will review unblinded safet y data including (but not limited to) 
general adverse events and serious adverse events on a regular basis through out the 
tanezumab clinical program.  The E-DMCwill have written operating procedures and a 
Charter, including a specific description of the scope of their responsibilities.
Adverse events of s yncope, brad ycardia, orthostatic hy potension, anhidrosis or hy pohidrosis 
will be designated as adverse events of interest.  These adverse events along with other 
adverse events that are possibly  related to the s ympathetic nervous s ystem will be monitored 
bythe E-D MCduring review of unblinded safety  data.
Tanezumab

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 52The E-DMCwill be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the safet y of subject s in the 
program according to the c harter.  If the blinded Adjudication Committee (seeSection 9.4 )
identifies adjudicated events of rapidly  progressive osteoarthritis ty pe2, subchondral 
insufficiency  fracture (spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee [SPONK]), primary  
osteonecrosis or pathological fracture, occurring at a rate that cou ld trigger protocol -based 
stopping criteria, an urgent, ad hoc assessment of the events will be made by the E-DMC . 
Any recommendations made b y the E-DMC to alter the conduct of one or more of the studies
will be forwarded to Pfizer for final decision.   Pfizer will forward such decisions, which may  
include summaries of aggregate anal yses of endpoint events and of safet y data which are not 
endpoints, to regulatory  authorities, as appropriate.
Pfizer Standard Operating Procedures regarding periodic safety  reviews by the study  team 
and the Tanezumab Risk Management Committee will be followed.   This committee will be 
composed of members inside and outside the immediate study  team who will review blinded 
safet y data from individual studies as well as data pooled across the studies on an ongoing 
basis.   A safet y review plan will be in place governing the frequency  and ex tent of safet y 
review. 
9.4.External Adjudication Committee
A blinded Adjudication Committee consisting of external experts in orthopedic surgery, 
rheumatology , orthopedic pathology , or radiology with expertise in subject s with end stage 
osteoarthritis and ost eonecrosis will be convened.   The Adjudication Committee will have 
written operating procedures and a Charter, including a specific description of the scope of 
their responsibilities.   In general, the Adjudication Committee will be asked to review all 
possible or probable joint-related safet y events identified by  the Central Reader, total joint 
replacement sas well as investigator -reported adverse events of osteonecrosis, rapidly  
progressive osteoarthritis, or subchondral insufficiency  fracture (spontaneous osteonecrosis 
of the knee [SPONK]) or pathologic fracture.  Adverse events related to joint safet y that the 
investigator or sponsor considers medicall y important may also be reviewed by the 
Adjudication Committee.  These will include, but will not be limi ted to events identified for 
adjudication by  the Central Reader.
Prior to the Adjudication Committee’s review of a given event, the Committee will be 
provided with blinded, available source documentation of progress reports from the 
Investigator, orthopedi c consult reports, operative reports, radiology  reports, pathology  
reports, X -ray images, MRI  images, and pathology  specimens for review.  Copies of all 
relevant clinical information including the items listed above should be provided to Pfizer or 
its desi gnee for review by the external Adjudication Committee.  Copies of the information 
should include the study  number, site number and subject number, but it should not include 
the subject’s name or initials.
The E-DMC will be provided with a blinded summary  of the Adjudication Committee’s 
review of events after each review meeting.

Page 5310.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits during study  conduct to ensure that 
the protocol and Good Clinical Practices ( GCPs )are being followed.  The monitors may  
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs areaccurate.  The 
investigator and institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate 
regulatory  authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification. This 
verification may  also occur after study  completion.
During study  conduct and/or after study  completion, the study  site may  be subject to review 
by the i nstitutional review board (I RB)/ ethics committe e (EC), and/or to quality  assurance 
audits performed b y Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of Pfizer, and/or to 
inspection by appropriate regulatory  authorities.
The investigator(s) will notify  Pfizer or its agents immediately  of any  regulatory inspection 
notification in relation to the study . Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with Pfizer 
or its agents to prepare the study  site for the inspection and will allow Pfizer or its agent, 
whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection. The investigator will promptly  
provide copies of the inspection findings to Pfizer or its agent.  Before response submission 
to the regulatory  authorities, the investigator will provide Pfizer or its agents with an 
opportunity  to review and comment on r esponses to any  such findings.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPING
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject .  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory  
author ities, without written permission from Pfizer.
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring that they  are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed by  the investigator or by  an authorized staff member to attest that the 
data contained on the CRFs is true. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source 
documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry .

A4091064
Final Protocol Amendment 1, 06 January 2016
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 54In most cases, the source documents are the hospital's or the ph ysician's subject chart.  In 
these cases data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may  also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases, a document should be available at the investigat ivesite as well as at Pfizer and clearl y 
identify  those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the investigator
agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all participating subject s (sufficient 
information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed 
consent documents , copies of all CRFs, safety  reporting forms, source docume nts, and 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence ( eg,letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be 
retained b y the investigator according to the ICH guidelines, local re gulations, or as specified 
in the Clinical Study  Agreement (CSA) , whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period ( eg,retirement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer , such as another 
investigator, another institution, or to an independent third part y arranged by Pfizer. 
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 years afte r completion or 
discontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations.
The investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.
12.ETHICS
12.1. Institu tional Review Board /Ethics Committee 
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, 
eg, recruitment advertisements, if applic able, from the I RB/EC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file.  Copies of I RB/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to Pfizer. The investigator should also receive the approval from the national 
competent authorit y befo re implementing a substantial amendment.
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject s.  In 
that event, the investigator must n otify  the IRB/EC and Pfizer in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.

Page 5512.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirements, as well as 
the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical 
Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical 
Sciences 2002), Guidelines for GCP (ICH 1996), and the Declaration of Helsinki (World 
Medical Association 1996 and 2008). 
In addition, the study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the ICHguideline 
on GCP , and applicable local regulatory  requirements and laws.
12.3. Subject Information and Consent
All parties will ensure protection of subject personal data and will not include subjectnames 
or other identifiable data in any reports, publications, or other disclosures, except where
required b y laws.
When study  data are compiled for transfer to Pfizer and other authorized parties, s ubject
names, address es, and other identifiable data will be replaced b y a numerical code based on a 
numbering sy stem provided by  Pfizer in order to de -identify  study subject s.The study  site 
will maintain a confidential list of subjects who participated in the study , linking each 
subject’s numerical code to his or her actual identity . In case of data transfer, Pfizer will 
maintain high standards of confidentialit y and protection of subject s’personal data consistent 
with applicable privacy  laws .
The informed consent document must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory  
requirements, and legal requirements , including applicable privacy  laws .
The informed consent document( s) used during the informed consent process must be 
reviewed and approved by the sponsor, approved by  the IRB/EC before use , and av ailable for 
inspection.
The investigator mus t ensure that each study  subject , or his/her legal ly acceptable
representative, is fully  informed about the nature and objectives of the study  and possible 
risks associated with participation. 
Whenever consent is obtained from a subject’s legally  acceptable representative , the 
subject’s assent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently be obtained when the subject has 
the capacity to provide assent, as determined by  the I RB/EC.  If the investigator determines 
that a subject’s decisional capacit y is so limited he/she cannot reasonabl y be consulted, then, 
as permitted b y the IRB/EC and consistent with local regulatory  and legal requirements, the 
subject’s assent may  be waived with source documentation of the reason assent was not 
obtained.  If the stud y subject does not provide his or her own consent, the source documents 
must record wh y the subject did not provide consent (eg, minor, decisionally impaired adult), 
how the investigator determined that the person signing the consent was the subject’s legall y 
acceptable representative, the consent signer’s relationship to the study  subject (eg, parent, 
spouse) , and that the subject’s assent was obtained, or waived.  If assent is obtained verball y 
it must be documented i n the source documents.

consent from each subject or the subject 's legal ly acceptable representative before an y 
study -specific activity  is performed. The investigat or will retain the original of each subject 's 
signed consent document .
12.4. Subject Recruitment
Subject recruitment efforts are not required for this study  because this is an observational 
extension study . 
12.5. Reporting of Safety Issues and S erious B reaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable 
competent authorit y in any area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of any  new 
information thatmight influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational 
product, Pfizer should be informed immediately. 
In addition, the investigator will inform Pfizer immediately  of any  urgent safet y measures 
taken b y the investiga tor to protect the study  subject s against an y immed iate hazard, and of 
any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.
13.DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL
13.1. End of Trial in a Member State 
End of Trial in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is 
deemed that sufficient number of subjects have been recruited and completed the study  as 
stated in the regulatory  application (i e,clinical trial application (CTA)) and ethics application 
in the Member State.  Poor recruitment (recruiting less than t he anticipated number in the 
CTA) by  a Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a 
normal conclusion to the study  in that Member State.
13.2. End of Trial in A ll Other Participating Countries 
End of Trial in all other participatin g countries is defined as database lock.
14.SPONSOR DISCONTINUAT ION CRITERIA
Premature termination of this study  may  occur because of a regulatory  authority  decision, 
change in opinion of the IRB/EC, or investigational product safety  problems, or at the 
discr etion of Pfizer.  In addition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of
tanezumab at an y time.
If a stud y is prematurel y terminated or discontinued, P fizer will promptly  notify  the 
investigator .  After notification, the investigator must cont act all participating subject s and 
the hospital pharmacy  (if applicable) within 1week .  As directed b y Pfizer, all study  
materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.

Page 70Appendix 4. Lifestyle Guidelines for Subjects from Sites in Sweden and the United 
Kingdom
All female subjects who are of childbearing potential and are sexuall y active and at risk for 
pregnancy ,and who withdraw from Study A4091056, A4091057 A4091058 , or other 
tanezumab study less than 16 weeks after the last dose of subcutaneous investigational 
product must agree to use one (1) method of highly  effective contraception consistently  and 
correctly  until 112 days (16 weeks) after the last dose of subcutaneous investigational 
product .  The investigator or his/or her designee, in consultation with the subject, will 
confirm the subject has selected the most appropriate form of contraception for the individual 
subject from the permitted list of contraception methods (see below) , and instruct the subject
in itsconsistent and correct use.  Subjects need to affirm that they  meet the criteria for correct 
use of the selected method of contraception.  The investigator or his/her designee will discuss 
with the subject the need to use highly  effective contraception consistentl y and correctly 
according to the schedule of activities and document such conversation in the subject’s chart.  
In addition, the Investigator or his/ or her designee will instruct the subject to call 
immediately  if the selected birth control met hodsarediscontinued or if pregnancy  is known 
or suspected in the subject .
Highly  effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie, perfe ct use) and 
include the following:
1.Established use of hormonal methods of contraception is allowed provided the subject 
remains on the same treatment throughout the entire study  and has been using that 
hormonal contraceptive for an adequate period of time to ensure effectiveness.  
Acceptable methods include:
Combined (estrogen and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception 
associated with inhibition of ovulation:
Oral
Intravaginal
Transdermal
Progestogen-onl y hormonal contraception associated with inhib ition of 
ovulation1:
Oral
Injectable
Implantable

3.Bilateral tubal occlus ion.
4.Vasectomized partner provided that the part ner is the sole sexual partner of the trial 
participant and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the 
surgical success.
5. Sexual abstinence, defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the 
entire period of risk assoc iated with the study  treatments.  The reliability  of sexual 
abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the 
preferred and usual lifesty le of the subject.
There are no contraception requirements for sexually  active female subjects of childbearing 
potential who withdraw from Study  A4091056, A4091057 ,A4091058 or other tanezumab 
study  more than 16 weeks after the last dose of subcutaneous investigational product .
1.Progestogen-onl y oral hormonal contraception where inhibition of ovulation is not the 
primary  mode of action is not acceptable as a highly  effective method.

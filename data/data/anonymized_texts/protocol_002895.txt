Amendment 1 Final, October 7, 2019
Page 126. RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND
Tofacitinib (Xeljanz) w as approved bytheUS Food andDrug Administration (FDA) in
November 2012 a s the first ora l J AK inhibit o r forthetreatment ofadult patients with 
moderate lyto severel yactive rheumatoi darthritis (RA) who have had aninadequate
response orintolerance to methotrexate. This advanced therapy may beused asmonotherap y
orin combination with methotrexate (MTX) orother nonbiolo
gic disease -modify ing
antirheum atic dr ugs(NB-DMARDs). InFebruary 2016, a once -daily Xeljanz XR
formulation wasapproved, offerin ganoption tothe alread yapproved twice daily immediate
release formulation.
Themost commonly used advanced therapies forRA are theTumor -Necrosi sFacto r-alpha
inhibitors (TNFi), inparticular, adalimumab (Humira) andetanercept (Enbrel). Useof
conse cutive TNFis hasbeen further reinforced bypayerrestrictions
that often require fa ilure
of two or more TNFi’s for receiving alternative MOA product slike t ofacitinib(TOFA).
However, therehas been agrowing body of largely observational evidence on the detriments
ofsuch TNFi cycling vs. switching to alternative MOA in patients with RA inc luding:
Shorter treatment persistence /duration ;1-4
Higherlikelihood ofswitching tothird lineadvanc ed therap y;2,3,5
Higher costs ;1,2
Lower effectiveness using 6-factor algorithm ;2,3
Potent ially poorer disease activity scores;4,6,7however, further information on the
impact ofjoint erosion associated withTNFi cycling vs. switching is not currentl y
available.
Inaddition to stepedits andprior authorization, another barrier to receiving advanced therap y
forRAis the increased out-of-pocket (OOP) cost sharing forpatients. Ananalysisofclaim s
data forover 40,000 RA patients starting bDMARDs between 01/2004 and12/2013 found 
that theaverage cost per prescription remained relatively unchanged, atapproximately
$2300 per prescription, while OOP expenditures increased from $36 (2.5%) perprescr iption 
t
o $128 (7 %).8  Ananaly sisof insurance claims data forMedicare Advantage Part D 
patients with RA found bDMARD prescription abandonment (claim reversal without 
subsequent fill) range dfrom 1.3% for the lowest out-of- pock et(OOP ) cost group ($0-$250) 
to 32.7% for the 
highest OOP costgroup (>$550). Further, the odds of refilling bDMARD
therap ywere significantly lower foreach OOP costrange ($250.01- $400.00,
$400.01-$550.00, and >$550.00) relative to OOP costrange of ≤$250 .9An analysisof 
insurance claims for self-insured he alth plan members with RA starting etanercept or 
adalimumab demonstrated about 1 week of therapy lost per$5.50 increase in weekl yOOP
expenditures. Thosewith weekl ycost>$50 were 58% more likely todiscontinue than
patients with lower OOP costs (hazard ratio 1.58, P<0.001).10Additionally ,Doshi et 
al11

Xeljanz (tofacitinib)
A3921346 NON-INTERVENTIONAL STUDY PROTOCOL
Amendment 1 Final, October 7, 2019
Page 13found using the 5% sample Medicare d ata that patients with RA belongi ng to a non-low
income subsidy (LIS) group had a higher average OOP cost for Part D bDM ARDs of
$484 (29.9% cost sharing) versus $5 (0.3% cost sharing) in an LIS group w hich was
associated with a 42% lower odds of filling Part D biologic agents while  being more than 
twice as likely to receive Part B biologic agents and having a 31% lower od ds of using any
biologic agent vs. patients in the LIS group.
The current study is intended to evaluate the impact of restriction s on TOFA including OOP
cost sharing and TNFi cycling with adalimumab and etanercept vs. switch ing to Tofacitinib 
on treatment persistence, treatment patterns, healthcare resource use , and costs.
7. RESEARCH QUESTION AND OBJECTIVES
The primary and secondary objectives will be evaluated using insurance c laims for patients
with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) identified in the Truven Health MarketSca n database (see
Section 8.4 ).
7.1. Primary Objectives
To evaluate the impact of (1a) TOFA index prescription OOP costs and ( 1b) TNFi cycling
with etanercept (ETN) and adalimumab (ADA) vs. switching to TOFA on t reatment 
persistence duration (see Section 8.3 ).
7.2. Secondary Objectives
To compare patients with (1) high (>median) vs. low (≤median) TOFA in dex prescription
OOP costs, and, (2) TNFi cycling with ETN and ADA vs. switching to TOFA on:
•Differences in demographic and clinical characteristics;
•Treatment patterns including dosing, concomitant medication use, adhe rence, and
switching, and a 6-factor effectiveness proxy (ie, Curtis algorithm) bet ween
comparator cohorts;
•Post-index and change (Post-Pre) in All-cause and RA-related health car e utilization
associated costs.

Page 148. RESEARCH METHODS
8.1. Study DesignThis is a retrospective cohort study to evaluate patient characterist ics, treatment patterns
including a 6-factor effectiveness proxy measure, health care resource use and associated
costs among RA patients initiating treatment comparator groups of inter est between January
2014 and September 2016 across three US insurance claims databases. T his period was
selected since we typ ically have 5-year data license and wan ted at least 2 y ears potential 
pre-index history, 2 years to capture treatmtent initation and 1 year fo r follow-up.
Further, we wanted to minimize chann eling bias for TOFA in the first year of introduction
where ADA and ETN were well established for a decade and based on prior an alyses using
2012-2014 data indicating majority of TOFA use for 3
rdline plus vs. ADA/ETN were mostly
used for 2ndline treatment of RA (Chastek et al.2Poster presented at the ACR/ARHP Annual
Scientific Meeting, San Fran cisco, CA, USA, N ovember 6–11, 2015).

For this objective both descriptive and multivariable analysis wil l be conducted. For the
descriptive analysis, treatment persistence duration (days) with in dex medication at
12-months will be compared for those with low (≤ median) vs. high (> medi an) OOP costs 
and for those who switch from ADA to ETN vs. ADA to TOFA and ETN to ADA vs. ETN

Switching Cohorts
For this objective descriptive analysis will be conducted.  The goa l of this objective will be to
describe the respective cohorts and explore the presence of demographi c and clinical
characteristics differences between the cohorts that will inform mul tivariable analyses.
Known demographic characteristics (eg, age, gender, geographic locatio n) will be
summarized.  In addition, other patient characteristics (eg, pre-inde x RA medication use and
medical history, comoribidity status, cumulative/index OOP costs) wil l be evaluated. Index
medication prescriber, regimen, and OOP costs will also be described.

objective beingexamined. Descriptive techniques will be implemen tedfor each objective.
8.7.4. Multivariate Analysis
To control forpossible confounding of the relationship between the outcomes and
independent variable ofinterest, select objectives willbeconducted utilizi ngmultivariab le
methods asdescribed above.
Final outcomes formultivariate analysiswill beselected after review ofdescriptive results.
Possible outcomes of interest include: total all-cause health care cost, total RA-related healt h
care cost, cost of bDMARDs/tofaci tinib/administration/NB -DMARDS, medication
effecti veness (yes vs. no).
For ea chmodel, specific predictors to be included willbedetermined based upon clinical
rationale andstatistical significance. Variables listed in Section 8.3will be considered for
inclusion in t hemultivariable models. Additiona lvariables identified throughout thecourse
ofthe study will alsobe considered. Following standard procedure, regression diagn ostics
willbeperformed for each model to assess goodness offitandviolations of model
assumptions (e g,multicollinearity ,heteroskedasticity ).  When there areviolations of the
model, programmers willnote them and make appropriate corrections to the data
(ie,typicallythrough transformation of either theindependent or dependent variables) or in 
themethod of estimation.
Inparticular, generalized linear models will be fit,using appropriate distributions andlinks 
forthe nature of the data (eg, norm ally - distribut eddata with identity link, binary data and
logit link). Results will be dis
playedon the original scale (that is, the inverse link). If
sufficient sample siz e, tofacitinib IRandtofacitinib XR will be treated assepar ategroups.
That is,contrast statemen tswill be used to average the two groups when comparing to 
bDMARDs.  Poi ntestimates (thatis, mean differe nces, ratios, odds ratios), 95 percent
confidenc eintervals, andp-values will be presented forcontrast s;ANOVA table willbe 
presented to display the strength ofthe independent variables, including point estimates and
p-values.

A3921346 NON-INTERVENTIONAL STUDY PROTOCOL
Amendment 1 Final, October 7, 2019
Page 338.7.5. Cost Data
Because health care costs are often skewed, estimated cost measures wil l be modeled using a
gamma regression model. Coefficients from a generalized linear model (GL M) are estimated
cost ratios. Cost ratios, 95 percent confidence intervals, and p-val ues will be presented for
each covariate included in the final model.  For ease of interpretati on and comparison with 
the bivariate results, the average cost will be predicted for each c ohort and may also be 
predicted for pre-determined levels of other patient characteristics ( eg, combination vs. 
monotherapy, gender).
If a significant number of patients have zero values for costs, estimat ed cost measures will be
compared using a two-part model (ie, one equation estimating the proba bility of any cost and
a GLM with a gamma distribution and log link estimating the level of  cost). This method
avoids potential difficulties introduced by transformation and retran sformation of the
dependent variable.
If there is an excessive number of zero-dollar cost patients, then only logistic regression
prediciting the probability of nonzero costs will be run.
Odds ratios, 95 percent confidence intervals, and p-values will be pr esented for each
covariate included in the logistic model estimating the probability o f non-zero costs. Cost 
ratios, 95 percent confidence intervals, and p-values will be present ed for each covariate 
included in the GLM model estimating the level on costs.  Combined resu lts will displayed.
8.7.6. Dichotomous Data
The probability of being effectively treated, persistent, and anytime sw itching to advanced
therapy at one year will be modeled using logistic regression. Logistic regression models fit
a maximum-likelihood logi t model.  For ease of interpretation, the res ults of logistic
regression will be presented as odds ratios, 95 percent confidence in tervals, and p-values for
each covariate included in the final model.

This is a retrospective study, so issues of quality control at stu dy sites, eg, data queries, do
not apply. Analyses are programmed according the specifications in the  protocol, and if
applicable, the statistical analysis plan and documented in a program ming plan. Final
deliverables are reviewed and verified by a second, independent program mer who may also
perform double programming. All quality checks are documented in the programming plan.
8.9. Limitations of the Research Methods
Limitations that are general to claims database analyses and specific t o this study should be
noted. First, diagnosis of autoimmune conditions will be identified u sing ICD-9/10-CM
diagnosis codes, which are subject to potential miscoding. Second, clinical and laboratory
data are not available, thus we are relying on adjudicated claims data f or characterizing
medical history, treatment exposure and outcomes. Along these lines, we m ay be missing
information on services or resources for which claims were not submitted  such as medication
samples. We will use 2-year pre-index continuous enrollment to increas e the likelihood of
capturing patient baseline characteristics including prior advanced t herapy experience.
However, this may not be sufficient and may bias the sample to patien ts who stay in health 
plans and may be healthier.CCI
Xeljanz (tofacitinib)

Page 35Further, we require 1-year of post-index enrollment across groups to en sure similar follow
up, but this may not be representative of health plan enrollees and ma y bias toward longer
treatment duration or higher healthcare resource use and costs. This stu dy will include an
examination of medication effectiveness at 1 year among all biologic user s. Effectiveness
will be measured using a validated algorithm; however, the algorithm was not validated for
all medications being included. Specifically, tofacitinib was approve d for treatment of RA
after the algorithm was developed. Although this study will also evalua te outcomes  
using multivariable analysis to control for observable
differences between groups, there may be unobservable differences as c ommon with

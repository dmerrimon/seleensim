test and women of child -bearing potential, defined as all women 
less than 1 y ear postmenopausal or less than 6 weeks since 
sterilization at Baseline, unless they  are using effective methods of 
contraception during dosing of stud y treatment. Effective
contraception methods include:
• Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred 
and usual lifesty le of the subject). Periodic abstinence (eg, 
calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, postovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods o f 
contraception
• Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral 
oophorectom y with or without hy sterectomy ) or tubal

(PPS) and alternative imputation for missing values including a 
mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) and observed data only  
analyses.
Statistical testing strategy:  
The 4 hy potheses will be tested in the pre -specified hierarchical 
sequence according to their numbering (HAn, n=1,2,3,4). 
Consequently , confirmatory  testing of a given hypothesis requires 
rejection of all preceding null hy potheses. In this setting, each 
hypothesis will be assessed at a two- sided α = 0.05, while keeping 
the global t ype I error rate at 0.05.
Statistical method: 
Two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the differences in 
means, RTH258 – aflibercept, based on an anal ysis of variance 
(ANOVA) model with treatment, Baseline BCVA categories ( ≤ 
55, 56-70, ≥71 letters), and age categories (< 75, ≥ 75 y ears) as 
fixed effects will be presented for the primary  efficacy  anal ysis. 
The same ANOVA model will be fitted for the key secondary 
endpoint, average change in BCVA from Baseline over the period 
Week 36 through 48.
Within the specified hierarchical testing strategy , noninferiority  
will be established if the lower limit of the corresponding 95% CI 
is greater than -4 letters (corresponding to the noninf eriority  
margin of 4 letters). 
Sam ple size: 
A sample size of 297 subjects per treatment arm is sufficient to 
demonstrate noninferiority (margin = 4 letters) of RTH258 6 mg/3 
mg versus aflibercept 2 mg with respect to the BCVA change 
from Baseline to Week 48 at a two- sided alpha level of 0 .05 with 
a power of approximately 90% assuming equal efficacy  and a 
common standard deviation of 15 letters. A power of at least 90% 
can be expected for the first key  secondary  endpoint assuming that 
averaging over the 4 time points will not lead to an inc rease in the 
standard deviation.
To account for a drop -out rate of 10%, a total of 330 subjects will 
be randomized per treatment arm.

1.1 Amendments
Amendment 4
Purpose of amendment:
The primary  purpose of this amendment is to add back missing text in section 11.3. This text 
was available in the original protocol, however due to technical issues was accidentally  
removed and is being ad dedback now . In addition ,other minor clarifications have been 
added to sections 10.5, 10.6, 10.7.4, 12.3.
Amendment 3
Purpose of amendment:
The primary  purpose of this amendment is to allow ADA  analy sis of the samples collected 
from aflibercept treated patients (Section 10.7.5). Minor clarifications have also been made to 
Sections 9.4, 10.1, 10.9 and 12.3
Amendment 2
Note: This TDOC-0050793 was formerly TDOC-0016528, V ersion 2.0. The change in 
document numbers was due to a new document management system.
Purpose of the Amendment:
The primary  purpose of this amendment is to incorporate changes which resulted from 
interacti ons with Regulatory  Authorities. In addition, changes have been made to clarify  
some inclusion/exclusion criteria and study  procedures.
Rationale:
Revision 1 (Section 1. Sy nopsis, Section 2. Overview of Study  Plan, Section 10.2.1. 
Screening V isit (Day  -14 to Day  -2) and Section 10.2.2. V isit 1/Baseline (Day  0)): Require 
BCV A in the study  eye to be between 78 and 23 letters, inclusive, at Screening as well as 
Baseline.
Rationale: The purpose of this change is to further clarify  the intention of the protocol that 
the criterion must be met at both the Screening and Baseline V isit by  stating it explicitly .
Revision 2 (Section 1. Sy nopsis): The term central subfield in exclusion criteria number 4 
was changed to foveal center point.

Rationale: The current wording excludes subjects who are appropriate for anti- VEGF 
treatment. The change is intended to reduce unnecessary screen failures.
Revision 3 (Section 1. Sy nopsis, Section 2. Overview of Study  Plan, Section 10.2.2. Visit 
1/Baseline (Day  0), Section 10.2.3. Visit2/Week 4 (Day  28 ± 3 Day s) and V isit 3/W eek 8 
(Day  56 ± 3 Day s), Section 10.2.4. Visit 4 (V isit 3 + 1 day ) and Section 10.7.5. Anal ysis of 
Anti- Drug Antibodies (ADA), Sy stemic R TH258 and Accumulation (Cmax) of R TH258): 
Removal of V isit 4 (blood draw for a ccumulation (C max) of R TH258 1 day  after the third 
loading dose) from the protocol.
Rationale: This pharmacological assessment will be conducted in another study .
Revision 4 (Section 2. Overview of Stud y Plan and Section 10.2.3. V isit 2/W eek 4 (Day  28 ± 
3 Day s) and V isit 3/W eek 8 (Day  56 ± 3 Day s): Addition of blood draw for ADA  and 
Systemic R TH258 testing to V isit 2/W eek 4. 
Rationale: These tests were added to evaluate the earl y systemic immune response to the 
initial intravitreal dose of R TH258 and to de termine the sy stemic exposure of the drug. 
Revision 5 (Section 2. Overview of Stud y Plan and Section 10.7.16 Postinjection 
Assessment): Simplification of the postinjection assessment.
Rationale: This change is to make post injection fundoscopy  at the disc retion of the 
investigator , thereby  reducing the risk of postinje ction I OP rise due to pupil dilation .
Revision 6 (Section 10.8 .Concomitant Treatment and Section 10.9. Prohibited Treatment): 
Allowance of all treatments in the nonstudy  eye which are approv ed for exudative AMD in 
the respective country .
Rationale: This change has been made to ensure subjects have unrestricted access to 
standard of care treatment in the nonstudy  eye. 
Revision 7 (Section 13.5. Data Monitoring Committee): Addition of a Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC) .
Rationale: During the V oluntary  Harmonization Procedure (VHP) for the R TH258 -C002 
study , the VHP  committee requested that a DMC be established for the C002 study . This 
DMC will also be utilized to monitor the safety  data from stud y RTH258 -C001.

10.2.2. VISIT 1/BASELINE (DA Y 0)
Paragraphs r emoved/modified:
Subject eligibility  will be determined at Screening. However , if the BCV A is not able to be 
assessed at the Screening V isit, the Baseline V isit BCV A may be used to qualify  the subject. 
Baseline BCV A of the study  eye must be between 78 and 23 letters, inclusive, for the subject 
to qualify .
At the Baseline V isit, subjects will be randomized only  if the subject has successfull y met all 
of the eligibility  criteria.
At the Baseline V isit IRT will also randomly  assign approximately  72 subjects
(approximately  24 in each treatment arm; half from Japanese sites and half from non
Japanese sites) to have blood draws for accumulation (Cmax) of R TH258 at V isit 4 (W eek 8 
+ 1 day ).
12. Contact I RT to obtain a kit number . IRT will also randomly  select a subset of subjects to 
attend V isit 4 (V isit 3+1 day ). If the subject is selected for this visit the I RT system will notify  
the user during this transaction.
13. Have the unmasked Investigator perform an IVT injection according to the 
randomization/kit assignment. The injection procedure may be performed at a later time as 
long as it occurs within 7 day s of the scheduled visit .and within the visit window .
10.2.3. VISIT 2/WEEK 4 (DA Y 28 ± 3 DA YS) AND VISIT 3/WEEK 8 (DA Y 56±3 DA YS)
Added:
4. Obtain a blood sample for ADA  anal ysis (V isit 2 only ). Blood draws should take place 
prior to the IVT injection.
5. Obtain a blood sample for s ystemic R TH258 analy sis (V isit 2 only ). Blood draws sh ould 
take place prior to the IVT injection.

10.7.16. POSTINJECTION ASSESSMENT
First paragraph changed:
The study  eye will be assessed before, immediately  (0-5 minutes) after and 30 (± 15) minutes 
after each IVT/sham injection to ensure that the procedure and/or the stud y medication have 
not endangered the health of the ey e. The pos tinjection assessments include an evaluation of 
central retinal artery  perfusion via a gross assessment of vision (eg, count fingers ), the status 
of the central retinal artery, presence of retinal detachment, presence of new intraocular 
hemorrhage(s) and measurement of IOP  according to the schedule detailed in the MOP . 
Direct visualization to assess the central retinal artery , presence of retinal detachment, 
presence of new intraocular hemorrhage(s) might be appropriate at the discretion of the 
investigator and/or based on the results of gross assessment of vision and IOP  measurement.
10.8. Concomitant T reatment
Changed to:
The Investigator should instruct the subject to notify  the study  site about any  new 
medications he/she takes after enrolling into the st udy.
Should the nonstudy  eye require treatment during the study with an anti -VEGF , ranibizumab 
a drug which is approved for the treatment of exudative AMD in the respective country
should be applied at the discretion of the Investigator and following the p rocedures 
established at the respective site. The nonstudy  eye treatment may  occur at any  time once the 
Baseline stud y eye injection has been administered.

13.5. Data Monitoring Committee
Section added:
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established to monitor the safet y 
of the trial participants, to ensure that the trial is being conducted with the highest scientific 
and ethical standards, and make appropriate recommendations based on the data seen. 
The DMC charter will include the DMC membership and responsibilities, the timing of DMC 
meetings, the content of the anal ysis report for the DMC meetings, and the communications 
with the Sponsor . The DMC will only  make recommendations for changes in study  conduct.
Amendment 1
Purpose of Amendment:
The primary  purpose of this amendment is to implement required changes received from 
regulatory  authorities. In addition, the data collection and anal ysis plan has been changed to 
improve the reporting of the q12 (treatment every  12 weeks) potential of R TH258 and also 
clarifications and corrections were implemented based on feedback f rom key  opinion leaders 
and the CRC.
Rationale:
Revision 1 (Section 1. Synopsis and Section 1 1. Analysis Plan) : Methodology , endpoints and 
statistical methods were revised.
Rationale: These revisions were made to repeat the anal yses performed at W eek 48 at the 
end of the study , and to align with variables measured by  the CRC.
Revision 2 (Section 1. Synopsis) : The terms fovea and central fovea in the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria were changed to central subfield.
Rationale: The CRC will use the central subfield for assessing eligibility ; this modification 
was made to provide clarity  to Investigators.
Revision 3 (Section 1. Synopsis) : Use of pegaptanib (MACUGEN®) within 4 weeks prior to 
Baseline added as an excluded medication.
Rationale: This addition was made to avoid unnecessary  exclusion of subjects with prior 
exposure to pegaptanib, which is still used in some countries.

Revision 4 (Section 1. Synopsis) : Hypersensitivity to povidone iodine was removed as an 
exclusion.
Rationale: Other options are availa ble for preparation of the ey e for IVT  injection and 
therefore the original exclusion was unnecessarily  restrictive.
Revision 5 (Section 1. Synopsis) : Pregnant and nursing (lactating) women were added to the 
exclusion criterion.
Rationale: These exclusions were requested b y the Japanese Regulatory  Authority .
Revision 6 (Section 1. Synopsis and Section 1 1.3. Analysis Set) : Definition of full anal ysis set 
was revised to include all subjects who are randomized and receive at least one IVT  injection.
Rationale: This change was requested by  the United States Regulatory  Agency .
Revision 7 (Section 2. Overview of Study Plan) : Study  procedures were revised to state that 
all blood draws and collection of urine samples should occur prior to subjec ts receiving an 
IVT or sham injection or injection of fluorescein dy e.
Rationale: IVT injection or injection of fluorescein prior to collection of the laboratory 
samples could confound the results.
Revision 8 (Section 2. Overview of Study Plan and Section 10.2.5. V isit 5/W eek 12 through 
Visit 25/W eek 92) : Fluorescein angiograph y and color fundus photograph y were added to 
Visit 5/W eek 12.
Rationale: An earl y assessment (W eek 12) of fluorescein angiograph y will allow capture of 
RTH258 impact on lesion activit y compared to aflibercept. W eek 12 color fundus 
photograph y will allow early assessment of geographic atroph y and identify subjects who 
have lesions which may  have been masked by  an increased retinal thickness at Baseline.

Treatment, Section 10.2.5. V isit 5/W eek 12 thr ough V isit 25/W eek 92 and Section 10.7.13. 
Disease Activity Assessment) : Disease activity  assessment added to W eek 92. 
Rationale: This addition will have no imp act on the treatment regimen but will allow the 
proportion of subjects who can be treated q12 to be estimated at the end of the study  
(RTH258 3 and 6 mg arms only ).

Revision 10 (Section 2. Overview of Study Plan, Section 10.2.2. V isit 1/Baseline, Section 
10.2.3. V isit 2/W eek 4 and V isit 3/W eek 8 and Section 10.2.5. V isit 5/W eek 12 thr ough V isit 
25/W eek 92) : Period that the injection may  be performed after the scheduled visit was 
extended from 48 hours to 7 day s as long as the injection is performed within t he visit 
window.
Rational e:This revision was made to allow more flexibility  at the investigative sites while 
not compromising the study  data.
Revision 1 1(Section 10.2.1. Scr eening V isit): Allowance for screening procedures to be 
conducted over more than 1 day  was added.
Rationale: Due to the number and complexity  of screening procedures it was determined that 
it would be beneficial to investigative sites to allow screening to take place over multiple 
days and will not compromise validity  of screening data .
Revision 12 (Section 10.2.1. Scr eening V isit): Criteria for rescreening were added.
Rationale: These criteria were added to clarify  the circumstances under which subjects can 
be rescreened.
Revision 13 (Section 10.2.1. Scr eening V isit): The option for a legall y authorized 
representative to sign the informed consent form was removed.
Rationale: This was removed because it was decided that signing of the informed consent 
form by  a legall y authorized representative was not appropriate for this trial.
Revisio n 14 (Section 10.9. Pr ohibited T reatment) : The allowance for administration of low 
stable doses of corticosteroids to subjects during the course of the study  was added.
Rationale: This was added to clarify  and align with the inclusion criteria.
Revision 15 (Section 1 1.4.2. Baseline Characteristics) : The following baseline characteristics 
were deleted from the analy ses: cy st volume, hy perreflective material, presence of intraocular 
hemorrhage and central subfield volume.
Rationale: This modification was made to align with the variables captured by  the CRC.
Revision 16 (Section 12.3. Pr ocedur es for Recor ding and Reporting AEs and SAEs) : The 
language regarding adverse events of special interest relative to intraocular inflammation 
were revised.

10.2 SCREENING VISIT (DA Y -14 TO DA Y -2)
Added:
The completion of assessments for this visit may  occur on different day s. The screening 
period starts with the first screening procedure (oth er than signing of the ICF). 
One time rescreening of subjects will be allowed in the following circumstances: a) 
laboratory  test(s) need to be repeated, b) when a subject has a temporary  medical condition 
precluding participation. As long as testing can b e repeated within 14 day s of the first 
screening, the other screening assessments do not need to be repeated. If rescreening is to 
occur bey ond 14 day s from the original screening visit date, then all screening procedures 
must be repeated. Rescreening will not be permitted for the purpose of capturing new BCV A 
or imaging assessments that previously  failed to qualify  the subject. Medical judgment should 
be exercised to ensure that treatment is not withheld in order for a subject  to participate in 
the study .
10.7.13 DISEASE ACTIVITY  ASSESSMENT
Section r evised:
The masked Investigator will assess the study  eye of all subjects at Visit 6/W eek 16, V isit 
7/Week 20, V isit 10/W eek 32, V isit 13/W eek 44, V isit 16/W eek 56, V isit 19/W eek 68 and 
Visit 22/W eek 80. If the subject presents with new or worsening disease activity , as defined in 
Section 10.1, t The I RT system will make the necessary  changes to the dosing per the masked 
Investigator ’s assessment. assign the subject to q8 treatment for the remainder of the study .
The disease activity  assessment will also be performed at Visit 25/W eek 92, but will not be 
entered into IR T and will have no ef fect on the subject’ s treatment regimen. Details of the 
disease activity  assessments are further outlined in the MOP.
11.3 Analysis Sets
Definitions for full analysis set and per protocol analysis set r evised:
Full analysis set (F AS): includes all subjects who are randomized, andreceived at least one 
IVT injection and have a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline measurement of BCV A. 
Following the intent -to-treat (ITT) principle, subjects in the F AS will be analy zed according 
to the treatment group they  are assigned at randomization , regardless of whether dosing 
frequency   (q12 to q8) changed at subsequent visits . The F AS will be the primary  anal ysis set 
for efficacy analyses.

1. The informed consent form must be signed/dated prior to performing any study procedures, including screening procedures.
2. Verify that inclusion/exclusion criteria are met at Visit 1/Baseline prior to assignment of study treatment.
3. Questionnaires are to be administered at those sites where validated translations are available and where they are approved by the corresponding Independent 
Ethics Committee/Institutional Revie w Board (IEC/IRB). Questionnaires must be administered prior to any examination.
4. All clinically significant findings will be recorded as medical h istory or adverse events, as appropriate. 
5. Required for all female subjects of childbearing potential. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed unless local regulatio ns require a serum pregnancy test.
6. All blood draw s and urine collections should be performed prior to receiving the IVT or sham injection and prior to injection of fluorescein dye.
7. Visit 4/Visit 3+1 day only applies to the subset of subjects who w ere randomly selected to complete it and did so before Version 3.0 of t he protocol became 
effective.
8. Both eyes; all other assessments are study eye only.
9. Includes slit -lamp exam, IOP measurement, and fundus exam. Dilation for the fundus ex am is at the discretion of the Investigator.
10. Other FA assessments, done outside of the visit schedule, may be performed at Investigator’s discretion based on exam findings, observations, etc.
11. ICG imaging applies to subjects screened at sites in Japan only.
12. FAF will be performed at a subset of sites.
13. Subjects will be randomized to one o f the following treatments: RTH258 3 mg, RTH258 6 mg, or aflibercept 2 mg. Beginning at Week 16, when subjects do 
not receive an active injection, they will receive a sham injection. The injection may be performed at a later time, as long as it is within 7 days of the scheduled 
visit and within the visit window .
14. Whether the subject receives an active or sham injection, the study eye will be evaluated 0 -5 minutes and 30 (±15) minutes postinjection to ensure that the 
injection procedure and/or the investi gational product have not endangered the health of the eye. This includes an evaluation of central retinal artery perfusion via
gross assessment of vision and measurement of IOP. Direct visualization to asses s the central retinal artery, presence of retina l detachment and presence of new

5 INTRODUCTION
5.1 Study Rationale and Background
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe vision loss in people 
affecting 10% -13% of individuals over the age of 65 in North America, Europe, and Australia 
(Kawasaki 2010, Rein 2009, Smith 2001). Genetic, environmental and health factors play  an 
important role in the pathogenesis of the di sease. 
AMD is classified into 2 clinical subty pes: the non -neovascular (atrophic) or dry  form and 
the neovascular (exudative) or wet form (Ferris 1984, L im 2012, Miller 2013). Neovascular 
AMD is characterized b y the growth of abnormal new blood vessels (n eovascularization) 
under the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) or subretinal space from the subjacent choroid, 
termed choroidal neovascularization (CNV) (Ferris, 1984). These newly  formed vessels have 
an increased likelihood to leak blood and serum, damagin g the retina b y stimulating 
inflammation and scar tissue formation. This damage to the retina results in progressive, 
severe, and irreversible vision loss (Shah 2007, Shah 2009). W ithout treatment, most af fected 
eyes will have poor central vision (20/200) within 12 months (T AP 2003). Although the 
neovascular form of the disease is only  present in about 10% of all AMD cases, it accounted 
for approximately  90% of the severe vision loss from AMD prior to the introduction of anti-
vascular endothelial growth fac tor (VEGF) treatments (Ferris 1983, Sommer 1991, Wong 
2008).
VEGF has been shown to be elevated in patients with neovascular AMD and is thought to 
play a key  role in the neovascularization process (Spilsbury  2000). The use of intravitreal 
(IVT) pharmacotherap y targeting VEGF has significantly improved visual outcomes in 
patients with neovascular AMD (Bloch 2012, Campbell 2012). Anti- VEGF treatments, such 
as ranibizumab (LUCENTI S®) and aflibercept (EYL EA®), inhibit VEGF signaling 
pathway s and have been shown to halt the growth of neovascular lesions and resolve retinal 
edema.
Ranibizumab
In two Phase 3 studies of ranibizumab with monthly  dosing regimens, approximately  95% of 
ranibizumab treated subjects experienced stabilization of vision (defined as a loss of fewer 
than 15 earl y treatment diabetic retinopath y stud y [ETDRS] letters) or improvement in vision 
at 12 months compared with 62% and 64% in the control groups (Rosenfeld 2006, Brown 
2009). T went y-five to 40% of subjects in the ranibizumab groups gained ≥ 15 letters at 12 
months compared with 5 -6% in the 2 control groups. On average, ranibizumab treated

subjects gained 7 -11 letters of vision after 12 months, whereas control subjects lost an 
average of approximately 10 letters. This gain in visu al acuity  was essentially  maintained 
during the second year of both Phase 3 studies while vision, on average, continued to decline 
in the control group. The visual acuity benefits, which indicate a suspension of neovascular 
AMD rather than a slowdown of it s progression, were supported b y corresponding ef fects on 
lesion anatomy  and subject reported outcomes. The latter demonstrated statistically  and 
clinically  meaningful improvements in near activities, distance activities, and vision specific 
dependency  as measured by  the National Ey e Institute Visual Function Questionnaire -25 
(VFQ -25).
Afliber cept
In two parallel Phase 3 trials of aflibercept, treatment naïve subjects with neovascular AMD 
were randomized to 2 doses (0.5 and 2.0 mg) and 2 regimens (every  4 weeks and every  8 
weeks with 2.0 mg) or the control arm (ranibizumab 0.5 mg every  4 weeks). At 52 weeks, all 
aflibercept groups, independent of doses and regimens, were noninferior to the ranibizumab 
group with equal stabilization of vision in 95% of ey es (Heier 2012). In the 2 mg aflibercept 
every  4 weeks group, there was a mean best -corrected visual acuit y (BCV A) improvement of 
9.3 letters and in the 2 mg aflibercept every  8 weeks group there was an improvement of 8.4 
letters compared to the control group which had a mean improvement of 8.7 letters. In the 
second year of the stud y subjects were switched to a capped (treatment required at least every  
12 weeks) pro re nata (PRN) regimen. The proportion of subjects who maintained BCV A 
ranged between 91% and 92% for all groups. Mean BCV A improvements ranged from 7.9 
(ranibizumab), 7.6 (aflibercept 2 mg every  4 weeks and every  8 weeks) to 6.6 (aflibercept 0.5 
mg every  4 weeks). The retreatment frequency  was similar between the aflibercept and 
ranibizumab arms dur ing the capped PRN year, with a mean of 4.1 injections for the 
aflibercept 2 mg every 4 weeks arm, 4.2 injections for the aflibercept 2 mg every  8 weeks 
arm and 4.7 for the ranibizumab arm (Schmidt-Erfurth 2014).
RTH258
RTH258, formerly known as ESBA1008, is a humanized single -chain Fv (scFv) antibod y 
fragment inhibitor of VEGF with a molecular weight of ~26 kDa that is being developed for 
the treatment of CNV  associated with  neovascular AMD. It is an inhibitor of VEGF -A and 
works by  binding to the recepto r binding site of the VEGF -A molecule, thereb y preventing 
the interaction of VEGF -A with its receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 on the surface of 
endothelial cells. Increased levels of signaling through the VEGF pathway are associated 
with pathologic ocular angio genesis and retinal edema. Inhibition of the VEGF pathway has

been shown to inhibit the growth of neovascular lesions and resolve retinal edema in patients 
with neovascular AMD.
In an ascending single dose study , Alcon protocol C -10-083, several doses of RTH258 (0.5, 
3.0, 4.5 and 6 mg), were evaluated versus ranibizumab 0.5 mg with regard to the mean 
change from Baseline to Month 1 in central subfield thickness (CSFT) as measured b y 
spectral -domain optical coherence tomograph y (SD-OCT) (primary  efficacy  endpoint). 
Treatment with R TH258 provided similar reductions for all doses in CSFT  to ranibizumab. 
The primary  statistical analy sis compared R TH258 4.5 mg and 6.0 mg versus ranibizumab 
0.5 mg with both doses achieving noninferiority . Notable however was the median time to 
receiving standard of care which was longer for the R TH258 3.0 mg, 4.5 mg and 6.0 mg 
doses (75 day s in the 6.0 mg group compared with 45 day s in the ranibizumab group), 
suggesting a longer duration of treatment ef fect. R TH258 6 mg was the hi ghest dose tested in 
the study  and no unexpected safety issues were reported that would preclude further clinical 
development.
Subsequently  the safet y and ef ficacy  of the R TH258 6 mg dose were evaluated versus 
aflibercept 2 mg in a 56 week multiple dose st udy (Alcon protocol C -12-006) with a primary  
endpoint at 12 weeks. The efficacy data from this study showed that R TH258, when it was 
given every  8 weeks (q8), was as ef fective as the active control in terms of BCV A change 
from Baseline. There were numerica l advantages with R TH258 over aflibercept with regard 
to the change in CSFT  from Baseline. The majority  (72%) of the R TH258 treated subjects 
who completed an extension of the study , who received treatment every  12 weeks (q12), 
showed visual stability . Ther e were no adverse events in the R TH258 group that negativel y 
differentiated the drug from the control. The majority  of adverse events were mild or 
moderate in nature and either resolved spontaneously  or with treatment.
5.1.1 Dose Rationale
C-10- 083 and C -12-006 suggest that a 6 mg dose of R TH258 is ef fective and safe. The 
RTH258 3 mg dose is included in order to evaluate the dose- response relationship following 
multiple dosing with R TH258.
5.1.2 Treatment Regime n Rationale
While VEGF inhibitors have vastl y improved pat ient outcomes for neovascular AMD, there 
still remains a need for treatments and regimens which of fer a reduced frequency  of 
injections. Frequent treatment and monitoring schedules remain a significant burden to 
patients, caregivers and phy sicians. The proposed Phase 3 study  aims to address these.

In the current study , RTH258 patients will receive q12 maintenance dosing. Disease activity  
assessments will be conducted b y a masked investigator at W eeks 16, 20, 32 and 44, allowing 
four time points up to the pr imary  endpoint of the study  (Week 48) where R TH258 q12 
subjects can be reassigned to q8 treatment. It is expected that earl y determination at W eek 16 
and W eek 20 of subjects who are more suited to a q8 dosing regimen will minimize the 
percentage of q12 sub jects who will require reassignment at later time points. Anal yses from 
the PI ER (Regillo 2008) and EXCITE (Schmidt -Erfurth 201 1) studies have shown that visual 
and anatomic response during and for the 12 weeks after the loading phase are associated 
with v isual acuity  outcomes over the remainder of the first y ear of treatment. I n addition, 
recent anal yses from the EXCI TE (Chong 2013) study  have also shown that subjects who 
lose vision during the initial loading phase will have better visual outcomes with mo re 
frequent treatment versus q12 treatment. Finall y, analy ses from CA TT (Kim 2014, Ying 
2014) and EXCITE (Simader 2014) have also shown that new intraretinal fluid 
(IRF)/intraretinal cy sts (IRC), and to a lesser degree CSFT  increase, are associated with la ter 
visual acuity  decline.
5.2 Benefits and Potential Risk s
RTH258 is an inhibitor of VEGF with a mechanism of action similar to ranibizumab but with 
a smaller molecular size (26 kDa and 48 kDa respectivel y).
Nonclinical studies have demonstrated that R TH258 i s at least as potent as ranibizumab, with 
a similar vitreal half -life and a significantl y lower systemic exposure. The low systemic 
exposure should confer a good safet y profile even at a high dose. The higher dose, similar 
half-life, and potency  of R TH258 may  confer a longer treatment duration compared to 
currentl y available treatments. T wo clinical studies, C -10-083 and C -12-006, have 
demonstrated that R TH258 is as ef fective as ranibizumab and aflibercept in improving BCV A 
outcomes whilst having a reduced treatment frequency , thus providing a potential benefit to 
patients and their caregivers/phy sicians. The ocular and s ystemic safety  profile of single or 
repeated doses of R TH258 were also evaluated in the C-10- 083 and C -12-006 studies, 
respectivel y, and de monstrated similar safet y profiles to ranibizumab and aflibercept. Further 
details of the known and potential risks and benefits associated with R TH258 are presented in 
the Investigator ’s Brochure.
Summarized, the results from the Phase 2 studies demonstrate that R TH258 has similar 
efficac y to currentl y available treatment options with potentially  greater duration. These data 
support the further development of R TH258 with a treatment regimen including q12 
maintenance dosing.

Control Article : Aflibercept solution for IVT  injection, 2 mg in 50 µL
The R TH258 trial kits will consist of a carton that contains 1 single use, sterile glass vial 
containing R TH258.
The availability  of the control article, as well as regional regulatory  requirements, will 
determine aflibercept sourcing. Some sites will be supplied with aflibercept by  the Sponsor 
and others may  be requested to utilize vials from their own stock.
Sponsor supplied: The aflibercept trial kits consist of a masked, numbered carton containing 
one commercially  labeled vial of aflibercept.
Site supplied: Aflibercept will be obtained by  the site in its original package. I n these cases 
masked, numbered, empty kits will be supplied that contain instructions to adm inister an 
aflibercept injection. The lot number and expiry date of the aflibercept will be recorded.
Kit labels on all trial kits will include the kit number , protocol number , storage conditions, 
and a statement that the product is for investigational use only.
All trial kits should be stored at 2º to 8ºC (35.6º to 46.4ºF); do not freeze. T o ensure proper 
conditions are maintained, a daily  (7 day s/week) temperature log will be maintained 
documenting appropriate investigational product storage conditions .
9.2 Usage
RTH258 3 mg and R TH258 6 mg will be administered b y IVT injection. All doses will be 
delivered in 50 µL  (0.05 mL ). Both treatment groups will receive 3 loading doses of their 
respective treatment at V isit 1/Day  0, V isit 2/W eek 4 and V isit 3/W eek 8. After the loading 
doses subjects will receive q12 treatment unless there is disease activit y according to the 
guidance provided in Section 10.1. I f disease activity  is identified, the subject will be 
reassigned to receive injections q8 thereafter up to V isit 25/W eek 92.
Aflibercept will be administered as a 2 mg dose in a 50 µL  (0.05 mL) injection. Subjects 
randomized to receive aflibercept will receive 3 loading doses at V isit 1/Day  0, Visit 2/W eek 
4 and V isit 3/W eek 8 followed b y injections at q8 intervals up to Visit 25/W eek 92.
To maintain masking, beginning at V isit 6/W eek 16, if a subject does not receive an active 
injection, they  will receive a sham injection.

If at an y visit, including Baseline, a subject is accidentally  treated with investigational 
product (IP) from an arm other than the one to which they  were assigned, they  will be treated 
with the I P to which they were randomized to and according to the treatment schedule of that 
arm for the remainder of the study . Any instance of this must be repor ted to the Sponsor 
immediately .
9.3 Accountability Procedures
Each site must have designated unmasked site personnel who, upon receipt of the I P, will 
conduct an inventory . At the appropriate study  visits, designated unmasked study  staff will 
provide the IP  tothe unmasked injecting phy sician in accordance with the IR T procedures.
During the study , the Investigator must maintain records of IP dispensation and collection for 
each subject. This record must be made available to the unmasked study monitor for the 
purposes of verify ing the accounting of clinical supplies. Any discrepancies and/or 
deficiencies between the observed disposition and the written account must be recorded along 
with an explanation. At the conclusion of the study , the Investigator will be re sponsible for 
returning all used and unused study  supplies unless otherwise instructed by  the Sponsor .
9.4 Subject Confidentiality and Methods Used to Minimize Bias
The Investigator must ensure that the subject’ s anony mity is maintained throughout the 
course o f the stud y. In particular , the Investigator must keep an enrollment log with 
confidential identify ing information that corresponds to the subject number of each study  
participant. At the end of the clinical study, the Sponsor will collect a copy  of the en rollment 
log without an y identifying subject information. All documents submitted to the Sponsor will 
identify  the subject exclusively  by number and demographic information. No other 
personall y identify ing information should be transmitted to the Sponsor .
The intent of masking is to limit the occurrence of conscious and unconscious bias in the 
conduct and interpretation of the clinical study . Bias could arise from the influence that the 
knowledge of a specific treatment assignment may have on the recruitmen t and allocation of 
subjects, their subsequent care, the assessment of end points, the handling of withdrawals, 
and so on. The essential aim of masking, therefore, is to prevent identification of the 
treatments b y the Investigator , subject, and others associated with the conduct of the study  
until all such opportunities for bias have passed.
This study  will be double -masked, with subjects randomized to be treated with R TH258 3 
mg, R TH258 6 mg or aflibercept 2 mg. All members of the Clinical Study  Team will be 
masked to treatment assignments while the stud y is in progress. In addition, the biostatisti cian

who isdirectly  involved in the conduct of the study  (i.e. involved in patient level discussions 
or direct interaction with sites) will remain masked to tre atment assignments while the study  
is in progress. Sponsor personnel who have access to treatment codes (eg, SAS® 
Programming, personnel directly involved with bioanal ysis of serum samples, unmasked 
monitors performing IP accountability , and Clinical Suppl ies personnel) will not divulge the 
codes to subjects, Investigators, site staf f, Sponsor Clinical Trial Management (CTM), or 
Sponsor Clinical Site Management (CSM). If necessary , the Sponsor may  be required to 
unmask a subject if an adverse event (AE) mee ts criteria of a Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) in order to fulfill expedited regulatory  reporting requirements. In 
this event, the Sponsor Safet y Review T eam will not divulge the treatment code to any  other 
personnel involved in rep orting, obtaining, and/or reviewing the clinical evaluations. This 
level of masking will be maintained throughout the conduct of the stud y.
Each site must have both masked and unmasked physicians available. The phy sician who 
performs the injection will be unmasked to the treatments as will any  other site personnel 
who have been delegated responsibility  for working with the IP . The unmasked site personnel 
and unmasked injecting phy sician must not perform BCV A, complete ophthalmic 
examination, disease activit y assessments or administer the VFQ -25. Also, the unmasked site 
personnel and unmasked injecting ph ysician must not perform assessment of any  ocular or 
nonocular safety parameters, or assess causalit y AEs for subjects during the course of the 
study  except an event reported immediately  following IVT  injection. The unmasked 
physician/site personnel should, however , assess subject safet y immediately following 
injection (ie, they  will perform the postinjection assessment; the masked phy sician/site

perform IP  accountability .
Treatment will be assigned to subjects through the I RT system. Each subject number will be 
associated with treatment groups according to a random process. Su bjects will be assigned 
treatment in numerical order; the randomization schedule will be blocked to ensure a balance 
of treatment allocations across the study . The IR T system will be utilized to implement the 
outcome of the disease activity  assessments at the appropriate visits.
The randomization scheme will be generated and maintained by  the Sponsor . Once all study  
data have been verified, validated, and the database locked, individual subjects will be 
unmasked to their treatment. I n the event of a medical emergency during the study where the 
knowledge of subject treatment is required, an individual Principal I nvestigator will have the 
ability  to unmask the treatment assignment for a specific subject. The Investigator should 
notify  the Sponsor prior to unma sking a subject, if there is suf ficient time. Further , the

10 STUDY  PROCEDURES
10.1 Outline of Study
This is a prospective, randomized, double masked, multicenter, 3 arm study . Subjects with 
untreated active CNV  secondary  to AMD who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be 
included in the study . The study will be conducted at approximately 320 sites and will 
randomize approximately  990 subjects.
The Investigator or a designee is responsible for scheduling study  visits and ensuring subject 
compliance with the visit schedule. Subjects missing a scheduled visit should be contacted 
immediately  to reschedule the examination, preferably  within the specified study  visit period.
SD-OCT  imaging, fluorescein angiograph y (FA) and color fundus photography  will be 
performed at the Screening V isit and the images will be assessed by  CRC. I n Japan, ICG will 
also be performed and the images will be assessed by  the CRC. The CRC will review these 
images to confirm subject eligibility  based upon the lesion attributes specified in the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subjects who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria, and 
are confirmed as eligible by  the CRC will return to the site for the V isit 1/Baseline (Day  0).
At the V isit 1/Baseline, subjects will be randomized to 1 of 3 arms in a 1:1:1 ratio per the 
randomization schedule.
Arms 1 and 2 (R TH258):
Subjects randomized to R TH258 3 mg (Arm 1) and RTH258 6 mg (Arm 2) will be initial ly 
injected at 4 week intervals, at V isit 1/Day  0, Visit 2/W eek 4 and V isit 3/W eek 8.
Following these loading doses, each subject will be injected q12 up to W eek 92 unless there 
is disease activity  according to the guidance provided at Visit 6/W eek 16, V isit 7/W eek 20, 
Visit 10/W eek 32, V isit 13/W eek 44, V isit 16/W eek 56, V isit 19/W eek 68 or V isit 22/W eek 80. 
If disease activity  is identified, the subject will be reassigned to receive injections q8 
thereafter , up to Week 92. The IR T system will make the nec essary  changes to the dosing per 
the masked Investigator ’s assessment. The disease activity assessment will also be performed 
at Visit 25/W eek 92 but will not be entered into IR T and will have no ef fect on the subject’ s 
treatment regimen.

10.3 Unscheduled Visits
Ifa subject returns to the site prior to their next scheduled study  visit for assessment of an 
adverse event, the Unscheduled V isit pages of the electronic case report form (CRF) should 
be completed. Procedures conducted at the Unscheduled V isit are at the discretion of the 
Investigator apart from treatments of the stud y eye for AMD. If the subject is discontinuing at 
the Unscheduled V isit, the CRFs for the Exit Visit should be completed rather than the CRFs 
for an Unscheduled V isit. Routine treatments and r outine follow -up of the nonstudy  eye will 
not be considered an Unscheduled V isit. Any treatments of the nonstudy  eye will be captured 
on the Concomitant Medication Page.
10.4 Discontinued Subjects
Discontinued subjects are those who are lost to follow- up, withdraw or are withdrawn from 
the study  after the V isit 1/Baseline. Subjects may  discontinue from the study  at any  time for 
any reason. Discontinued subjects will not be replaced (ie, their subject numbers will not be 
re-assigned/re -used). The site must contac t IRT to register the subject’ s discontinuation from 
IP.
Should a subject exhibit any  clinically  relevant signs, s ymptoms, or other clinical 
observations that possibly  could be associated with suspected sensitivity  or intolerance to one 
of the study  treatm ents, the Investigator must document those observations on an AE Form 
(AEF). If a subject discontinues the study  with an ongoing AE, follow -up procedures, as 
appropriate and outlined in Section 12.6, should be performed.
Any subject who exits early  from th e study  must undergo all procedures outlined at V isit 
26/W eek 96 (Section 10.2.6). Additionally , the Exit Form must be completed and a reason for 
discontinuation must be identified.
If a subject exits early  from the study  between visits, the I nvestigator m ust attempt to contact 
the subject and request the subject to return for a final visit to complete the exit procedures. If 
the subject is unable or unwilling to return for the Exit Visit, the subject will be considered 
lost to follow -up and the ‘date of ex it’ will be the date that the subject was last seen at the site 
or contacted b y other communication.
Finally , to ensure the safety  of all subjects who exit early  from the study , Investigators should 
assess each subject and, if necessary , advise them of any therapies and/or medical procedures 
that might be needed to maintain their health.

in the randomization process.
10.7.12 Fundus Autofluorescence
FAF will be performed at a subset of sites in order to assess the occurrence of geographic 
atrophy . A standar dized procedure for the collection of F AF images is provided by  the CRC 
in a separate hand book. Certification of the equipment and examiners at each investigative 
site will occur prior to evaluation of study  subjects. F AF will not be used to determine 
eligibility , but will be included beginning at the Visit 1/Baseline.
10.7.13 Disease A ctivity Assessment
The masked Investigator will assess the study  eye of all subjects at Visit 6/W eek 16, V isit 
7/Week 20, V isit 10/W eek 32, V isit 13/W eek 44, V isit 16/W eek 56, V isit19/W eek 68 and 
Visit 22/W eek 80. The I RT system will make the necessary  changes to the dosing per the 
masked Investigator ’s assessment. The disease activity  assessment will also be performed at 
Visit 25/W eek 92, but will not be entered into IR T and will have no ef fect on the subject’ s 
treatment regimen. Details of the disease activity  assessments are further outlined in the 
MOP .
10.7.14 Intravitr ealAdministration ofInvestigational Product
The IVT injection procedure for both the test article and control article is the same as that 
described for aflibercept in the product information sheet. IVT  injection is contraindicated in 
subjects with active ocular or periocular infections and in subjects with active intraocular 
inflammation; therefore, the I nvestigator shoul d verify  that these conditions are not present in 
either ey e (study  and nonstudy  eyes) prior to every injection. Specific instructions for 
injection procedures are provided in the MOP.
10.7.15 Administration of Sham Injection
Beginning at V isit 6/W eek 16, at visit s when subjects do not receive an active injection, they  
will be administered a sham injection. For the sham injection the tip of an injection sy ringe 
(the hub without a needle) will be used. A standardized procedure for the sham is described in 
the MOP .
10.7.16 Postinjection Assessment
The study  eye will be assessed before, immediately  (0-5 minutes) after and 30 (± 15) minutes 
after each IVT/sham injection to ensure that the procedure and/or the stud y medication have

not endangered the health of the ey e. The posti njection assessments include a n evaluation of 
central retinal artery  perfusion via a gross assessment of vision ( e.g.count fingers) and 
measurement of IOP according to the schedule detailed in the MOP. Direct visualization to 
assess the central retinal art ery, presence of retinal detachment, presence of new intraocular 
hemorrhage(s) might be appropriate at the discretion of the investigator and/or based on the 
results of gross assessment of vision and IOP measurement. Assessments will continue until 
the cen tral r etinal artery is adequately perfused and the IOP  is within 10 mmHg of the 
pre-injection value and is stable in the opinion of the Investigator . Any  subject who 
develops significantly  raised IOP  (> 30 mmHg) or a non- adequatel y perfused central retinal
artery  at any  time during the study  should be monitored according to the Investigator ’s 
clinical judgment and may  undergo additional procedures and measurements of IOP  beyond 
those specified in the protocol. If, at the conclusion of the required evaluatio n period 
following an injection/sham, there are no safet y concerns, the subject will leave the site. If 
any concern or immediate toxicity  is noted, the subject will remain at the site and will be 
treated according to the designated evaluating ph ysician’ s clinical judgment. If any  issues 
regarding IOP  were noted during the postinjection assessment, then the subject should be 
scheduled for a follow -up visit (Unscheduled V isit) the day  following injection/sham, if 
required in the opinion of the I nvestigator . Clinically  relevant changes that are observed 
during the postinjection assessment should be reported as adverse events.
10.8 Concomitant Treatment
The Investigator should instruct the subject to notify  the study  site about any  new 
medications he/she takes after enrolling into the study . 
Should the nonstudy  eye require treatment during the study  with an anti -VEGF , a drug which 
is approved for the treatment of exudative AMD in the respective country  should be applied 
at the discretion of the Investigator and follo wing the procedures established at the respective 
site.The nonstudy  eye treatment may  occur at any  time once the Baseline study  eye injection 
has been administered.
10.9 Prohibited T reatment
Use of treatme nts, as display ed in Table 10 -1, are not allowed after the start of the study  i.e., 
Screening. In addition, there are certain washout periods to be respected as outlined in the 
exclusion criteria.

11.1 General Considerations
Continuous variables will be summarized for the measured values and change from Baseline 
values using the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, quartiles, 
minimum and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized with numbers and 
percent from each category . Treatment dif ferences will be presented together with 95% 
confidence intervals as appropriate. 
11.2 Subject Evaluability
Subject evaluability  based on pre -specified deviations and their impact on analy sis sets will 
be determined prior to breaking the masked treatment assignment code and locking the 
database for the primary  anal ysis at Week 48. Protocol deviations and their impact on 
analysis sets will be pre -specified in the deviations and evaluabilit y plan (DEP).
11.3 Analysis Sets
The fol lowing anal ysis sets are defined:
All-enr olled analysis set : includes all subjects who signed an ICF and are assigned subject 
numbers. This anal ysis set will be used to summarize subject disposition and pre -treatment 
adverse events.

Full analysis set (F AS): includes all subjects who are randomized and received at least one 
IVT injection. Following the intent -to-treat (ITT) principle, subjects in the FAS will be 
analyzed according to the treatment group they  are assigned at randomization. The F AS will 
be the primary  anal ysis set for ef ficacy  anal yses.
The per  protocol analysis set (P PS): defined for the primary  and key  secondary  efficacy  
analysis at Week 48 includes all subjects in the FAS with no protocol deviations that are 
expected to majorly  affect the assessment of ef ficacy  at Week 48 including: lack of 
compliance (including trea tment misallocation), missing data, concomitant medication and 
deviation from inclusion/exclusion criteria. Discontinuation from treatment due to lack of 
efficac y does not constitute a reason for exclusion from the PPS. Before the W eek 48 database 
lock the relevant protocol deviations will be specified in the DEP  document and identified at 
the subject level in the database.
11.4 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for all anal ysis sets. All 
summarie s will be presented by  treatment group and overall .
11.4.1 D emographic Characteristics
The demographic parameters are age category  (50 to 64, 65 to 74, 75 to 84, and ≥ 85), 
gender , ethnicit y and race. Age will also be summarized as a continuous variable.
11.4.2 Baseline C haracteristics
Baseline characteristics will include: primary diagnosis of neovascular AMD, time since 
diagnosis of neovascular AMD (day s), whether neovascular AMD is unilateral or bilateral, 
BCV A (both as a continuous variable and using categories (≤ 55, 56- 70, ≥ 71 letters), lesion 
type (predominantl y classic, minimally  classic, pure occult), foveal involvement (subfoveal, 
extrafoveal, undeterminable), CNV lesion size, presence of subretinal fluid, presence of 
intraretinal fluid/cy st, presence of sub RPE fluid, neurosensory  retinal thickness, CSFT  (both 
as a continuous variable and using categories (< 400 ≥ 400 µm).

change from Baseline to W eek 48 at a two -sided alpha level of 0.05 with a power of 
approximately  90% assuming equal ef ficacy  and a common standard deviation of 15 letters. 
A power of at least 90% can be expected for the first key  secondary  endpoint assuming that 
averaging over the 4 time points will not lead to an increase in th e standard deviation.
To account for a drop -out rate of 10%, a total of 330 subjects will be randomized per 
treatment arm.
12 ADVERSE EVENTS
12.1 General Information
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject who is administered a stud y 
treatment regardless of whether or not the event has a causal relationship with the treatment. 
An AE, therefore, can be any  unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the study  treatment,
whether or not related to the treatment. In clinical studies, any  AE can include an untoward 
medical occurrence occurring at an y time, including run -in or washout periods, even if no 
study  treatment has been administered. The determination of clinical rel evance is based upon 
the medical judgment of the I nvestigator .
12.2 Monitoring for Adverse Events
At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity  to spontaneousl y mention any 
problems, the Investigator should inquire about AEs by  asking the standard qu estions:
•   “Have you had an y health problems since your last study  visit?”
•   “Have there been an y changes in the medicines y ou take since y our last study  visit?”
AEs should be reported for an y clinicall y relevant change in concomitant medication(s) tha t 
is the result of an untoward (unfavorable and unintended) change in a subject's medical 
health.  
Changes in an y protocol -specific parameters and questionnaires (if applicable) evaluated 
during the stud y are to be reviewed b y the Investigator . Any untowa rd (unfavorable and 
unintended) change in a protocol -specific parameter or questionnaire response that is 
clinically  relevant is to be reported as an AE. These clinically relevant changes will be 
reported regardless of causality .

direct cause and ef fect relationship between the study  treatment and the 
AE has not been demonstrated but there is a reasonable possibility  that the 
AE was caused b y the study  treatment.
Not Rela ted An AE considered unrelated to the use of the study  treatment. AEs 
classified as not related may  either be definitely  unrelated or simpl y 
unlikely  to be related (ie, there are other more likely  causes for the AE).
An assessment of causality  will also be performed, when appropriate, b y a Sponsor physician 
utilizing the same definitions. For a SAE reported by  an Investigator as not related that is 
subsequently  upgraded to be related b y a Sponsor phy sician, the Investigator will receive a 
notification.
12.5 Unmask ing of the Study Treatment
In case of emergency , information on the identity  of the masked assigned IP is available to 
Investigators. If the treatment code needs to be broken in the interest of subject safet y, the 
Investigator is encouraged to contact an appropriate unmasked Sponsor representative prior 
to unmasking if there is suf ficient time. Dependent upon the individual circumstances (ie, 
medical emergency), the code may be broken b y contacting the IRT system prior to contact 
with the Sponsor . The Sponsor must be informed in all cases in which the code was broken 
and of the circumstances involved. 
Additionally , the Sponsor may  be required to unmask the subject if the AE meets criteria of a 
SUSAR in order to fulfill expedited regulatory  reporting requirements.
12.6 Follow -Up of Subjects with Adverse Events
The Investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the trial 
and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the trial. Any additional dat a from these follow -up procedures must be 
documented and available to the Sponsor .
12.7 Pregnancy in the Clinical Trial
Women of childbearing potential are not excluded from the study as long as adequate birth 
control methods are being utilized. W omen of childbearing potential are defined as all women 
physiologicall y capable of becoming pregnant. Adequate birth control methods are 
summarized in the protocol’ s exclusion criteria.

Prior to enrollment in the study , female subjects of childbearing potential must be advised of 
the importance of avoiding pregnancy  during the trial and the potential risks associated with 
an unintentional pregnancy . During the stud y, female subjects are to be instructed to contact 
the Investigator immediately  if they  suspect they  might b e pregnant. The Sponsor must be 
contacted immediatel y and a decision will be made regarding continuation of the pregnant 
woman in the study based upon the circumstances surrounding the pregnancy . Pregnancy  is 
not reportable as an AE, however , complications may be reportable and will be decided on a 
case b y case basis. A Sponsor prepared form will be utilized to capture all pregnancy -related 
information until birth of the child.
13 DATA HANDLING AND ADMINISTRA TIVE 
REQUIREMENTS
13.1 Completion of Sour ce Documents and Electr onic Case Report 
Forms
The nature and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that original data 
required to complete the CRFs exist and are accessible for verification by  the site monitor . If 
electronic records are maintained, the method of verification must be determined in advance 
of starting the stud y. At a minimum, source documents should include the following 
information for each subject:
Subject identification (name, sex, race/ethnicit y)
Documentation of subject eligibili ty
Date of informed consent
Dates of visits
Documentation that protocol specific procedures were performed
Results of study  parameters, as required b y the protocol
Study medication accountability  records
Documentation of AEs and other safet y parameters (if applicable)
Records regarding medical histories and the use of concomitant therapies prior to and during 
the study
Date of study completion and reason for earl y discontinuation, if applicable
It is required that the author of an entry  in the source docume nts be identifiable. Direct access 
to source documentation (medical records) must be allowed for the purpose of verify ing that 
the data recorded on the CRF are consistent with the original source data.

Electronic case report forms will be provided to the sites; only  designated individuals may  
complete the CRFs. The CRFs will be submitted at regular intervals based upon the study 
visit schedule. I t is expected that all data reported will have corresponding entries in the 
source documents and that the Princi pal Investigator will review the reported data and certify  
that the CRFs are accurate and complete. No subject identifiers should be recorded on the 
CRFs bey ond subject number and demographic information.
13.2 Data Review and Clarifications
The CRF data will be reviewed against the subject’ s source data b y the study monitors to 
ensure completeness and accuracy . After monitoring has occurred at the clinical sites and the 
CRFs have been submitted, additional data clarifications and/or additions may  be needed. 
Data clarifications and/or additions are documented and are part of each subject’ s CRFs.
13.3 Regulatory Documentation and Records Retention
The Investigator is required to maintain up- to-date, complete regulatory  documentation as 
indicated b y the Sponsor , and the Investigator ’s files will be reviewed as part of the ongoing 
study  monitoring. Financial information is not subject to regulatory  inspection and should be 
kept separately . 
Additionally , the Investigator must keep study records and source documents until the 
Sponsor provides written approval for their destruction. If the Investigator retires, relocates, 
or for an y other reason withdraw s from responsibility of keeping the study  records, the 
Sponsor must be notified and suitable arrangements made for retention of study  records and 
source documents needed to comply  with national and international regulations (generall y 2 
years after discontinuing clinical development or after the latest marketing approval).
13.4 Quality Assurance and Quality Contr ol
The Sponsor will be responsible for implementing and maintaining quality  assurance and 
quality  control s ystems to ensure the study  is conducted and data are generated, documented, 
and reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP  and applicable regulatory  requirements. 
The Sponsor will secure agreement from all involved parties to ensure direct access to all 
study  related sites, source data and documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and 
auditing b y the Sponsor , and inspection by  domestic and foreign regulatory  authorities. 
Quality  control will be applied to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are 
reliable and have been pro cessed correctly . Agreements made by  the Sponsor with the 
Investigator/Institution and any  other parties involved in the study  will be provided in writing 
as part of the protocol or as a separate agreement.

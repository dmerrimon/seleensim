PATH-MCI STUDY OPERATIONS MANUAL 
6/30/2020 
 
 6 BACKGROUND 
 
Problem Adaptation Therapy for elders with major or minor depression and mild 
cognitive impairment (PATH-MCI) is a non-pharmacological intervention that facilitates 
problem-solving and adaptive functioning. The goals of PATH-MCI are to reduce 
patients’ depression, disability, and stress through emotion regulation.  
 
PATH-MCI aims to reduce negative emotions and promote positive emotions 
associated with depression, including depressed mood, hopelessness, helplessness, 
guilt, anxiety, and anhedonia. The tools to achieve emotion regulation are: a) a hands-
on problem-solving approach, simplified from Problem Solving Therapy (PST); b) 
compensatory strategies and environmental adaptations to bypass mild cognitive 
deficits or functional and behavioral limitations, due to depression or physical disability; 
c) careful integration of significant other involvement; and d) engagement in pleasurable 
activities. Using these tools, PATH-MCI can create an environmentally friendly 
“ecosystem” that decreases everyday stressors, empowers patients, instills hope, and 
promotes emotion regulation.  
 
A simplified problem-solving approach from PST was chosen because: a) PST has 
been found effective in cognitively-intact depressed elders and in depressed elders with 
mild executive dysfunction; b) PST creates a forum within which patients and therapists 
can collaboratively set treatment goals, and it provides the structure and the process for 
patient problem-solving pertinent to decreasing depressive symptoms and functional 
limitations; and c) problem-solving strategies can be appropriately modified, and when 
this is done, they can help remedy behavioral limitations resulting from depression and 
mild cognitive impairment. Because solutions of problems may not necessarily reduce 
depression, the focus of PATH-MCI’s problem-solving approach is to reduce negative 
emotions and promote positive emotions that are associated with the specific problem. 
To achieve emotion regulation, the PATH- MCI therapist guides the patient to find the 
best possible solution but also helps the patient adapt, if the solution is not satisfactory.  
 
Consistent with the NIMH Objective 3 for a person-centered approach using RDoC, 
PATH-MCI uses a neurobiological model to streamline and structure its interventions for 
use in primary care practices.  
 
Elders with depression and MCI may benefit from PATH-MCI. Preliminary results have 
demonstrated that PATH-MCI reduces depression and disability in elders with major or 
minor depression and mild cognitive deficits. PATH-MCI is not designed for patients 
with dementia as these patients may require additional assistance.

 7 STUDY AIMS  
 
The goals of the study are: 
MONTHS 1-3: 
 
1. Finalize the PATH-MCI Manual and establish feasibility of therapist training. We 
will train 4 LMSW/LCSWs: 2 will be trained in the PATH-MCI therapy, 2 will be 
trained in Supportive Psychotherapy. We will determine the success rate of 
training and number of hours needed to achieve PATH-MCI certification.  
 
MONTHS 4-60 
 
2. Assess PATH-MCI’s reach, feasibility and acceptability: We will assess across 
conditions:  
a. Reach: Number of patients screened, and those who meet inclusion 
criteria;  
b. Feasibility: Number of patients who receive PATH-MCI or ST for mental 
health care and research procedures (timely referrals, assessments);  
c. Acceptability: Patient’s treatment satisfaction at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 52 
weeks.  
 
Benchmarks of the study progress: Feasibility: At least 75% of PATH-MCI 
participants will complete PATH-MCI. Acceptability: We will obtain treatment 
satisfaction score at the end of PATH-MCI treatment.  
 
3. Preliminary Effectiveness: Over the course of 52 weeks, PATH-MCI patients, 
compared to patients receiving Supportive Psychotherapy, will have better global 
cognition and greater (effect size) and clinically significant reductions in disability 
and depression. Furthermore, better episodic memory and executive function will 
mediate the effects on cognitive outcomes

 9 RECRUITMENT PROTOCOL  
1. Patients are assessed and recruited from New York City Locations and 
Westchester. 
 Patients in NYC will be seen at 425 E 61st St., Penthouse Floor.  
 Patients in Westchester will be seen at 21 Bloomingdale Rd, White Plains, 
Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry. 
 Patients at Montefiore will be seen at 1515 Blondell Ave, Bronx, NY.  
 Note: There is no compensation for transportation expenses for patients. 
Any special cases must be discussed with Dr. Kiosses and Laurie Evans. 
 Patients who are not able to meet in person may be assessed by phone or 
video. 
 
2. Study staff may recruit using flyers, posters and referrals. 
 Flyers 
NYC 
- Flyers for the study are placed in the waiting room of doctor’s 
offices at 425 E. 61st Street, as permitted by the doctor’s office. RAs 
must talk to the front desk before leaving flyers. Preferred floors are 
the 11th and 12th floors. 
- Flyers also can be placed in the elevators of the main hospital 
building on 72nd Street. Permission for this has been granted. 
WP 
- Flyers can be placed in the waiting room of the Institute of Geriatric 
Psychiatry. 
- Flyers also may be distributed at events, eg. Salute to Seniors, etc.  
 Posters 
- A poster version of the flyer can be placed in the lobby of the 425 E 
61st Street office. 
- RAs must communicate at all times with the building manager, Kim 
Canazi: Kim.Canzani@colliers.com.  Inform her that we will be 
placing a poster in the lobby. Confirm with her the schedule for this, 
and that the easel obtained is the correct one to use.  
- Order posters through Marcella Sanchez or Andrei Gangal. 
 Referrals 
- We obtain referrals from different doctors. I.e. Dr. Ravdin. 
- Make sure to follow up with the referral sources and to update 
referral sources about the patients they referred to us (meet criteria, 
did not meet, did not reach out to us, etc.). 
- We may also obtain referrals from sources, like the 4331 line at the 
Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry, and outside sources like JASA. 
-  
3. Phone screens 
 When calling a potential patient, RA makes sure to first explain the study 
(quick overview) and answer any questions. 
PATH-MCI STUDY OPERATIONS MANUAL 
6/30/20 
 10 Proceed with the phone screen, if a patient is interested in the study and 
agrees to the phone screen. Phone screens must be conducted with 
patients prior to scheduling a screening appointment 
 Phone screen form for PATH-MCI study can be found at 
I:\Cores\DMB\KIOSSES STUDIES\Phone Screens  
 RAs must conduct phone screens on days and times that therapists and 
psychologists at the Institute are available. In case of an emergency, ie. a 
patient endorses suicidal ideation, the RA must communicate this 
information immediately to the therapists and psychologists present. RA 
must follow the suicide risk protocol. (See comprehensive SRA protocol at 
end of this document.) 
 If the patient seems eligible from the phone screen (i.e. endorses some 
depression and low mood and some memory problems), schedule a 
screening session with the patient.

 11STUDY PROTOCOL 
1. RAs obtain potential patient information from various referral sources.  
2. RA contacts a potential patient to complete a phone screen about 
memory/neurological problems, mood/depressive symptoms, current involvement 
in treatment, and medical illnesses.  
3. If the individual is interested in participating in our study and does not appear to 
meet exclusion criteria, the RA will invite the individual to come to our offices in 
White Plains or NYC, or to schedule a video or phone appointment, depending 
on the circumstances.   
4. At the onset of the screening interview, the RA will conduct the informed consent 
process.  If the patient has capacity to consent, the RA will conduct the screening 
assessment.  
5. The RA will discuss the results of the assessment with Dr. Kiosses. 
6. If the patient is eligible, the RA will email the data manager with the individual’s 
information.  
7. The data manager will randomize the patient to either PATH-MCI or Supportive 
Therapy.  
8. The data manager will notify Dr. Kiosses and the supervising therapist (not 
administering the intervention) about the randomization.  
9. The supervising therapist will assign a therapist to the patient and inform the 
therapist to contact the patient to schedule first appointment (to take place 
following the baseline assessment). 
10. The RA will schedule the baseline assessment with the patient and study partner. 
The patient will receive $30, and the study partner will receive $20 for the 
baseline assessment.  
11. Team weekly meetings: 
 Review recruitment (specifically the numbers of positive screen patients)  
 Referrals 
 Tracking of all patients; we will discuss:   
- The status of assessments 
- The status of therapy sessions  
 The data manager will generate charts with recruitment progress. 
12. The RA will conduct assessments with patients and their study partners at the 
following time points: 6, 12, 24, 36, and 52 weeks after the baseline assessment. 
Patients will receive $30 (cash, check or gift card) for each set of assessments. 
Caregivers will be compensated $20 (cash, check, or gift card) for each set of 
assessments. 
 Note: Genetic testing does not have an additional compensation. 
13. If the caregiver does not come in person for assessments and they agree we can 
give their compensation to the patient, they must first sign the reimbursement 
form stating that it’s okay for the patient to receive the money on their behalf. 
(See form I:\Cores\DMB\KIOSSES STUDIES\PATH-MCI\Reimbursment 
Forms) 
PATH-MCI STUDY OPERATIONS MANUAL 
6/30/20 
 1214. If the caregiver reimbursement can’t be given to the subject, then we can do a 
payment requisition through WBG (during COVID-19), send a gift card, or send a 
money order.  If possible, for money orders, send the caregiver a reimbursement 
form and self-addressed stamped envelope, so they can sign and mail the form 
back to us. Once the form is received, send a money order for the amount of the 
reimbursement. 
15. All technology lent to patients will be returned to study staff. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PATH-MCI STUDY OPERATIONS MANUAL 
6/30/20 
 13Montefiore Medical Center Site  
1. Patients will be recruited from Montefiore.  When a patient is identified (by 
Montefiore) and agrees to be contacted by Cornell, a WCM RA will call the 
patient to schedule a screening appointment at the Blondell Site (1515 Blondell 
Ave, Bronx, NY). 
2. RAs will schedule Montefiore patients for Tuesdays, when there is space and Dr. 
Erica Weiss is there to supervise. There is room for one RA; if more than one RA 
needs to go, email Dr. Weiss to see if she can find more room.  Montefiore 
therapists will see study patients on Mondays and Fridays. Patients must sign 
both the Montefiore and WCM consent forms. 
3. If a Montefiore subject signs the Genetics consent form, we will pay for 
transportation to Cornell for the blood draws. Blood draws can only be done at 
Cornell (White Plains or NYC), not Montefiore. 
4. If RAs are there for the entire day, we will not pay for transportation, except for 
the cost of the parking garage. 
5. If the RA is going to both the Montefiore and White Plains offices in the same 
day, we will pay for the transportation between the two sites (mileage for those 
driving, Uber/Lyft for those without a car). 
6. RAs should bring data/work with them to Montefiore, regardless of how many 
patients they have scheduled, as there may be downtime if a patient screens out 
early. If only one patient is scheduled (am or pm), RAs should plan on being in 
White Plains the other half of the day. 
7. Scheduling Patients at Montefiore: To aid the front desk in managing the patients 
coming in, please email Dr. Weiss (and Dr. Ceide, so she can troubleshoot if Dr. 
Weiss is away) every Friday the schedule of patients you are seeing the following 
week. These can be individual emails (ie. the RA’s cases do not have be on the 
same email as the therapist’s cases).  Please use the following format:  
 
Schedule for [insert date]    Email Sample: 
9am- [patient name]     Schedule for 12/10/2019 
10 am- [patient name]    10am- Erica Weiss 
11am- [patient name]    2pm- Mirnova Ceide 
1pm [patient name] 
2pm [patient name] 
3pm [patient name] 
 
In addition to helping the staff know whom to expect, this will facilitate locating the RA 
when a patient calls to confirm their appointment or if they come on the wrong day.

location: I:\Cores\DMB\KIOSSES STUDIES\PATH-MCI\Blood Draws 
2. When Blood Draw is conducted by the Health Clinic/Lab in Westchester: 
 Make sure patient has been registered. All of our PATH-MCI patients 
should have an MRN provided by the registration done in On-Core, so 
their MRN number can be found on the On-Core spreadsheet. If they do 
not have an MRN assigned for some reason, first check with Laurie, but 
you can register the patient using the registration form found on the iDrive: 
I:\Cores\DMB\KIOSSES STUDIES\PATH-MCI\Blood Draws\WP 
Registration for Venipuncture 
 Fill out a requisition form, which is located in the RA office 106. A sample 
of how this needs to be filled out is included below. 
 Once the patient has been registered, call Mary Ann at the Clinical lab 
x2259, to schedule a blood draw. Try to schedule the blood draw a day or 
two before the actual date. Phlebotomy lab hours are 8:30AM-2:30PM. 
When you call Mary Ann, give her the following information: 
- Remind her of the study. Let her know that we only require the 
blood draw, not the processing. 
- Give the patient’s first and last name 
PATH-MCI STUDY OPERATIONS MANUAL 
6/30/20 
 17- Patient’s date of birth 
- Billing Code for Reqs: 12R 
- WBS (account # for petty cash, etc.) 
- MD name (Dr. Alexopoulos) 
- Diagnosis code 
- Time and date of blood draw 
 Once a date and time have been established, send Mary Ann the 
requisition form with the date. You can fax this form to her at x6912.  
 Call to confirm appointment. 
 The day of the appointment, walk the patient to the clinic, bring a sterile 
glove with you because you will be transporting the samples back with 
you. Obtain the sample from the phlebotomist, and immediately go to the 
lab to process the samples and store. Follow the specimen processing 
steps detailed above.

PATH-MCI Adverse Events – Safety Report Form 
1. The Safety Report form is in RedCap.  
2. RAs will keep this form with each research assessment they do and ask the 
patient at each visit whether they’ve experienced any new health or medical 
problems since their last visit (At Baseline, the time frame is since 
screening/consent.).   
3. If the patient says yes, then complete the form (date of onset, severity, medical 
care received, etc.).  The guidelines for assessing what constitutes an AE, the 
severity level, etc. can be found in the NIA guidelines (saved on the I drive: 
(I:\Cores\DMB\KIOSSES STUDIES\PATH-MCI\Adverse Events )   
4. Therapists do not need to ask about new health problems.  If the patient 
spontaneously says something in a session, the therapist should try to get as 
much of the above information as possible and let the RA know, so that the RA 
can complete this form. 
 
 
 
 
 
2 As of June 2020, the Westchester Division no longer has a clinical laboratory.  Only a certified RA may collect 
samples at the White Plains site.

SUICIDAL IDEATION/ BEHAVIOR PROTOCOL 
 
When a patient reports passive suicidal ideation on the MADRS Suicide Ideation item or 
the Scale for Suicide Ideation:  
 
1. Complete a Suicide Risk Assessment  
2. Reach out to the patient’s study therapist. If the therapist is not available, reach 
out to Dr. Kiosses or another attending psychologist at the Institute.  
3. The clinician will speak to the patient and assess the situation. 
 
When a patient reports active suicidal ideation or any kind of suicidal behavior (suicide 
attempt, self-injurious behaviors, interrupted or aborted attempts, preparatory acts) on 
the MADRS Suicide Ideation item or the Scale for Suicide Ideation: 
 
1. Complete a Suicide Risk Assessment. 
2. Reach out to the patient’s study therapist. RA or therapist also needs to reach 
out to Dr. Kiosses and inform him about the situation and ask him to assess the 
patient.  If Dr. Kiosses is not available, contact another attending psychologist at 
the Institute (Dr. Kiosses needs to be informed later on about the situation.)  
3. Preferably, the assessment by a clinician is done during the same phone call or 
when the patient is still in the office. 
 
*Please see comprehensive SRA protocol at the end of this document.

 20INTERVENTION 
 
PATH-MCI :  
PATH-MCI follows the process model of emotion regulation. According to this model, 
emotions such as those associated with depression, can be regulated with five broad 
strategies: situation selection (selecting the situations a person is exposed to), situation 
modification (changing potentially emotion-eliciting situations), attentional deployment 
(shifting one’s attention within a situation), cognitive change (changing how one thinks 
about a situation), and response modulation (utilizing direct efforts to alter one’s 
emotional responses). In conjunction with these strategies, PATH-MCI incorporates a 
simplified problem-solving approach, compensatory strategies, environmental 
adaptations and significant other involvement to achieve emotion regulation. At the end 
of treatment, PATH-MCI therapists provide to patients a personalized summary of 
treatment that highlights the problems that were addressed and the successful 
techniques that were used to solve them.  
 
Comparison Condition : Supportive Therapy:   
ST is a control intervention not aimed to improve emotion regulation. The ST therapist 
strives to create a positive alliance with the patient by emphasizing non-specific 
therapeutic interactions and techniques that convey to the patient, interest, concern and 
understanding. For the purposes of this study, an effort will be made to avoid all 
emotion regulation techniques that relate to PATH-MCI.  
 
FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS 
Follow-up assessments are conducted by the WCM RA at 6,12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks 
after the baseline and include measures of mood, cognition and suicidal ideation. 
Patients will receive $30 (cash, check or gift card) as compensation for assessment 
completion at each time point. Study partners will receive $20 (cash, check or gift card) 
as compensation for assessment completion at each time point. 
 
 
PROCEDURES FOR TREATMENT AFTER STUDY COMPLETION  
Patients whose follow-up assessments indicate a need for continued mental health 
services will be provided with mental health referrals.  
 
 
 
PATH-MCI STUDY OPERATIONS MANUAL 
6/30/20 
 21DATA MANAGEMENT 
Data will be collected by the study RA at baseline and at follow-up assessments. The 
RA also will be responsible for writing and presenting patient summaries to the PI. The 
social worker will complete updates on the progress of their therapy sessions. Brian 
Liles manages the PATH-MCI database and weekly reporting.  
Research records will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law. Patients will 
be assigned ID numbers by the PATH-MCI study team, and all identifying information 
will be removed from records that are submitted to Weill Cornell Medicine for data 
analysis. Paper research records will be kept in locked file cabinets. When necessary 
for purposes of auditing, the Cornell IRB, NIMH, and all Federal oversight agencies will 
be provided access to these files. Computers will be password-protected, and all staff 
participating in the study will be trained in protecting human subjects in research. Data 
will be published in aggregate form without unique identifiers. No analyses will be 
published in which it is possible to identify individuals based on data .  
 
SUSTAINABILITY 
Dr. Kiosses will train two LCSWs in PATH-MCI (or more if needed). Training will consist of a 
one-day workshop with didactics, role-play and review of previously audiotaped sessions. 
After the workshop, the therapist will administer 6 PATH-MCI sessions to 2 pilot patients 
during the first four months.  To be certified in PATH-MCI, therapists must achieve a score of 
greater than or equal to 4 (very good) out of 5 on the PATH-MCI Adherence Scale.

 22Conducting the Study Remotely 
Due to COVID-19, and other circumstances where a patient would not be able to be seen in 
person, the study may take place remotely.  E-consenting can take place via REDCap if the 
patient has access to Internet.  The consenting process would be the same as in-person 
consent, with a member of the study team speaking with the patient over the phone or 
videoconference to explain the consent in detail.  The consent form may also be mailed to the 
potential participant with a self-addressed stamped envelope to return to the study team.  
Research assessments and both interventions (PATH-MCI and ST-CI) can take place over the 
phone and/or videoconference.  Therapy visits will be conducted in a private room (home or 
office) and sessions will be recorded only if subjects have consented to that.   
Research assessments will also take place in a private room with no one else present; if 
patients do not have access to video, some assessments may not be able to be completed in 
full.  Please reference most recent Assessment Grid for list of assessments that can be done 
remotely and via which method (phone and/or video).  
 
If the study is being conducted remotely, the genetics blood draws cannot be done.

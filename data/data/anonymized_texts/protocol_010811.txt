• Stent Migration: defined as any post procedure movement of the stent  (either proximally towards the kidney or distally towards 
the bladder or complete distal migration) from its implant location; c onfirmed via imaging where necessary  
Note: External force or inadver tently  pulled stents are not considered s tent 
migration . 
Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment  This is a n open- label postmarket registry  
 
Follow-u p 
Schedule  Each subject will be followed for a period up to 15 months  after the

• Stent Removal : Typically,  within 2 weeks  to < 365 days  from 
Index Procedure (see individual stent Instructions/ Directions for 
use [ IFU/ DFU] for maximum indwell) 
• Post-Stent Removal : Typically, 3 – 12 weeks from Stent 
Removal  
Study Duration The study will take appro ximately 50  months from First S ubject  In 
until L ast Subject Last Vi sit (dependent on stent indwell time)  and 
study closeout.  
• Enrollment of up to 1,000 subjects will take approximately 30 
months 
• The registry will be considered complete after all active subjects have completed their final follow -up visit and a final study report 
is generated     
Participant Duration The study duration for each subject is expected to be approximately 
between 8 weeks and 1 5 months (dependent on the study stent indwell 
time)

DJUS PLUS Registry  
• The anatomical features of the involved renal collecting system 
are known by either prior or concurrent urography or axial  CT 
imaging  
• Subject is willing and able to  return for all follow -up visits  
Exclusion 
Criteria  Subject  undergoing placement of a BSC US or UDS is not pe rmitted to 
enroll if th ey mee t any of the following exclusion c riteria: 
• Subject meet s any of the contraindications as per individual stent 
IFU/DFU  
• Subject receiving different stent type in case of bilateral /multiple 
stenting  
• Subject with an indwelling ureteral stent(s) not planned to be removed prior to/or concurrently with the study stent implant  
Primary Statistical Hypothesis The study is being statistically powered for only Tria ™ implanted  
subjects for S tone Management.  
Tria™ stents have technical success during planned indwell in more than 85% in stone manage ment . 
The null and alternative hypotheses are:  
H0: p ≤ 0.85 H1: p > 0.85 where p = the proportion of stent ed ureter(s)with technical success   
Statistical Test 
Method  The hypotheses above will be evaluated based on the two -sided 95% 
exact Clopper -Pearson confidence interval for the proportion of stented 
ureters with technical success . Only stents placed at least 12 hours will 
be included in the analysis. If the lower bound of the confidence interval exceeds 85%, the alternative hypothesis will be demonstrated  
Sample Size Parameters  Assuming that the Tria™ stent technical success rate is 94% for S tone 
Management, a sample size of 127 subjects with Tria™  placed  at least 
12 hours for Stone M anagement is required to attain 90% power to 
demonstrate the primary hypothesis at the 2.5% significance level(one-sided). Approximately 142 Stone M anagement subjects  with Tria™ 
stent procedures where stents indwell at least 12 hours will be required  
to allow for 10% subject attrition

  4. Introduction  
4.1. Background 
Ureteral stents have been available for several decades and are commonly used to restore 
flow of urine from the kidney to the bladder in obstructed ureters, or as a prophylactic 
placement following procedural interventions in the ur eter to ensure that flow is not 
compromised during the acute post-procedural period.  Stents may also be used for long- term 
drainage in patients with strictures or tumors, or to aid in ureteral healing after an accidental ureteral perforation or a therapeu tic ureterotomy.  With such a wide variety of uses, ureteral 
stents may remain indwelling for periods as short as 48 hours or up to as long as 365 days (see individual stent Instructions/ Directions for Use (IFU/ DFU) for maximum indwell time) . 
One such use of ureteral stents is temporary stenting following ureteroscopic treatment of upper urinary tract stones.  These stones can range in size from a few millimeters to a few centimeters and are generally made up of mineral and acid salts, with 70 -80% of kidney 
stones being made of calcium oxalate.   The remaining make up of stones are split by those composed of struvite, uric acid and calcium phosphate. (Satyanand, Patel, Patel, Tarun, & Soniya, 2012) In a 2007-2010 survey showed kidney stone prevalence in the United States population estimated to be 10.6% for men and 7.1% for women with an overall unadjusted prevalence to be 8.8%.  (Ziemba & Matlaga, 2017) 
 
Treatment decisions for stones are determined at the individual case level and take into account stone size, stone location, and (if known) stone composition, as well as patient preference and physician expertise. Current treatment recommendations are generally endourologic procedures such as ureteroscopy (URS), shock wave lithotripsy (SWL), and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). (Türk, et al., 2016)  Ureteral stents are placed after ureteroscopy for stone removal to prevent pain (Torric elli, De, Hinck, Noble, & Monga, 
2014) and to aid in future removal of residual stone fragments. (Chen, Tsai, Yu, Wu, & Lin, 2013)  Thus, ureteral stents are a fundamental part of a urologic stone practice. Further, ureteral stents have been used for maintaining luminal patency in ureteral obstruction, including cases of malignant ureteral obstruction due to pelvic malignancy. If uri ne flow to 
the bladder is not possible, a ureteral stent is placed in the kidney to facilitate drainage following ureteral conduit construction and urinary diversion procedures ; rerouting of urine 
flow to an opening in the wall of the abdomen (stoma) . This  stenting provides greater 
assurance of sustained internal urinary diversion, in addition to lessening concerns regarding anastomotic leaks from the pouch.   
 
While usually used temporarily, occasionally patients may have long- term stent placement.  
Long-term indwell of a ureteral stent increases the risk of encrustation (accumulation of urine salts on the surface of the stent) and can lead to serious and difficult complications such as ureteral obstruction and renal impairment.  The most common contributors to encrustation include urinary tract infection, extended indwell times (for chronic strictures or forgotten stents), urinary composition (hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, homocystinuria, and hyperuricosuria), and history of urolithiasis.  Severely encrusted and retained stents are

  serious and complex cases for the Endourologist to treat.  Since encrustation most often 
occurs in the bladder and kidney, they often require a multimodal endoscopic approach to achieve stent -free status.  (Mohan-Pillai, Keeley, Maussa, Smith, & Tolley, 1999)
  
 
Beyond encrustation, another area of interest in ureteral stents is patient discomfort.  Ureteral stent pain is a known side- effect of indwelling stents.  There have been various studies to 
determine the best way to measure and decrease the pain associated with ureteral stents with no apparent resolution for the issue.  It is hypothesized that a stent composed of a soft flexible material may reduce stent related discomfort.   A randomized controlled study of 155 
subjects showed a significantly higher incidence of dysuria, renal, and suprapubic pain in those subjects who received a firm polyurethane stent versus a soft stent. (Koprowski, Kim, Modi, & Elsamra, 2016)   
 
Other published studies have explored the duration of time the stent is left in place, (Ozgur, Ekici, Yuceturk, & Bayrak, 2013) use of image guidance in stent placement,  (Grasso, et al., 
2013) length and other physical features of the inserted stent, (Calvert, et al., 2013) and efficacy of pre -stenting prior to ureteroscopy. (Torricelli, De, Hinck, Noble, & Monga, 2014) 
 
4.2. Study Rationale  
Under normal conditions, urine is carried from the kidneys to the bladder via the ureters. A ureter may become obstructed as a result of a number of conditions including kidney stones, tumors, blood clots, postsurgical swelling, or infection. When the urine flow is blocked, it backs up into the kidney, which can lead to kidney swelling or hydronephrosis, as well as severe pain in the abdomen, flank, or side; nausea; vomiting; and hematuria. The goal of treatment for ureteral obstruction is to  relieve or reduce the blockage and restore urinary 
drainage. Ureteral obstruction is commonly treated via placement of a ureteral stent; a thin, 
flexible tube that is threaded into the ureter and restores the flow of urine to the bladder.  The 
most common reason for urinary diversion is bladder cancer that requires the bladder to be removed, a procedure called a cystectomy. Urinary diversion creates a new way for  urine  to 
exit body when urine flow is blocked or when there is a need to bypass the urinary tract . 
 The patient is usually placed under anesthesia for stent insertion, ensuring that the patient remains relaxed and immobile during the procedure. A cystoscope is inserted into the urethra to the bladder, and the opening to the ureter is identified. In some instances, a guidewire is inserted into the ureter under the aid of a fluoroscope. The stent is loaded onto the guidewire and subsequently advanced over the guidewire by a stent positioner (pusher). Once the stent is in place, the guidewire, positioner, and cystoscope are removed. If retrograde stenting is 
not possible, patients may have the stent placed percutaneously into the kidney, and subsequently into the ureter.  Postoperative urine flow is monitored to ensure the stent has not been dislodged or obstructed. The stent may remain in place on a short-term (days to weeks) or long-term (weeks to months) basis and  is removed most often cystoscopically. A

  stent may also be removed with the attached retrieval line by a physician or nurse in an office 
setting  or by the patient at home. 
 Although ureteral stents have been used safely in patients for over 30 years, there are limited clinical studies focusing specifically on the safety and efficacy of Boston Scientific’s Ureteral Stents . Further, Boston Scientific (BSC)  is launching the Tria™ Ureteral Stent 
(available in Soft and Firm durometers) with proprietary Percushield™ surface technology aimed at reducing calcium and magnesium urine salt accumulations . The goal of this registry 
is to collect real -world clinical  data on BSCs Ureteral Stents  to address  changing European 
Regulatory requirements .  In contrast to the limited published data for safety and efficacy  of  
BSC Double- J Ureteral Stents, there are published clinical data sets on stent -related pain and 
Quality of Life (QoL), with many  of studies showing increased side effects and reduced QoL 
associated with  stent indwell (Scarneciu, Lupu, Pricop, & Scarneciu, 2015) (Lingeman, 
Preminger, Goldfischer, & Krambeck, 2009) . This study will use a simplified patient QoL 
questionnaire to measure BSC stent -related pain at various times during the study; 
medication s prescribed post-procedure will also be captured. These QoL data sets will be the 
first generated for the Tria ™ stent family.

  9. Subject Accountability  
9.1. Point of Enrollment  
Subjects will be c onsidered enrolled in the study after he/she signs and dates the informed 
consent (ICF).  No study specific (non-standard of care) procedure (s) or assessment (s) can 
take place until the informed consent is signed.    
 
9.2. Withdrawal 
All subjects enrolled in the clinical study (including those withdrawn from the clinical study) 
shall be accounted for and documented. If a subject withdraws from the study, the reason(s) shall be reported. If such withdrawal is due to problems related to device safety or performance, the investigator shall ask for the subject’s permission to follow his/her status/condition outside of the clinical study.   Reasons for withdrawal include but are not limited to physician discretion and subject choice to withd raw consent. While study withdrawal is discouraged, subjects may withdraw from 
the study at any time, with or without reason, and without prejudice to further treatment. All applicable electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) up to the point of subject withdra wal and  
an End of Study eCRF must be completed. Additional data may no longer be collected after the point at which a subject has been withdrawn from the study or withdraws his/her consent. Data collected up to the point of subject withdrawal may be used for study analysis, unless local regulations apply.  
9.2.1. Voluntary Withdrawal 
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time. At the time of withdrawal, the  
Investigator shall document the reason for the withdrawal. For subjects who withdraw from 
the study and decide to revoke their authorization to use and disclose their medical information, the information that has already been collected in the study record may continue to be used; however, no new information will be obtained or added.  
9.2.2.  Involuntary Withdrawal Subjects may be involuntarily withdrawn from the study if the Investigator determines it is in  
the subject’s best interest. If the subject is withdrawn at the investigator’s discretion, the  
reason for withdrawal must be documented in the subject’s medical records.  Subjects who 
did not receive the study stent ( implant failures ) will be followed through hospital discharge 
and will be considered withdrawn.

  9.3. Lost to Follow- up 
If a subject fails to return to the clinic and/or is unable to be reached for a follow -up visit the 
site will attempt to contact the subject and reschedule the missed visit and counsel the subject 
on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the subject wishes to and/or should continue in the study.  
Before the subject may be considered lost to follow-up, the investigator must make the 
following attempts to contact the subject:  
• Three documented telephone attempts 
• One certified letter  
If the subject can be reached and no longer wishes to participate in the study, the Investigator shall document the reason for the withdrawal and complete the End of Study eCRF. 
 
If the subject is not able to be reached after the required attempts to contact the subject have been  made and the subject has missed two consecutive follow-up visits, or the subject has 
missed the final post- stent removal visit, the subject may be considered lost to follow-up. The 
Investigator should document in the subject’s medical record the attempts to contact the subject an d the reason for withdrawal. 
 
9.4. Subject Status and Classification  
A subject will be considered enrolled after a signed informed consent is obtained. An 
implanted s ubject participation ends when he or she has completed  all phases of the study 
including the last visit as shown in the Data Collection Schedule or if the study stent is 
replaced either for planned stent replacement or due to re- intervention . Subjects who  are 
unable to have study stent implanted will be follo wed through discharge following index 
procedure and he or she will be  considered withdrawn from the study.  
 
9.5. End-of-Study Definition  
A clinical study at each participating site is considered completed when participants are no 
longer being examined or the last participant’s last study visit has occurred,  and study 
closeout activities are completed   
A subject  is considered to have completed the study after  he or she has completed  all phases 
of the study including the last visit shown in the Data Collection Schedule (see section 10) or if the study stent is replaced  either for planned stent replacement or due to  re-intervention .   
The end of the study is defined as completion of the final Clinical Study Report.

  10.2. Study Candidate Screening  
All interested subjects will undergo screening during which their eligibility for the study 
will be determined.  
Subjects who do not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria are considered screen failures.  
Infor mation on screen failures will be captured in the screening logs and should include 
reasons for screen failure. These screen failures will not count towards the enrollment ceiling.  
If the subject has completed the informed consent process and met all inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, the subject will progress to the index procedure and follow-up phases of the study, if stent(s) is implanted . 
10.2.1. Strategies for Recruitment and Retention  
Subjects will be recruited from clinician practice who are receiving device as standard of care. For the completion of post-stent removal follow-up visit, subjects will be compensated 
for participation in the study, in accordance with pertinent country laws and regulations and per the study site’s regulations.   
10.3. Informed Consent  
Written informed consent must be obtained from all potential study candidates before any study specific, non- standard of care screening tests or procedures are performed. Only 
current  Institutional Review Board ( IRB), Ethics Committee ( EC) or Rese arch Ethics Board 
(REB)   approved study specific ICF must be used. Study personnel should explain that even 
if a subject agrees to participate in the study and signs an ICF, certain screening procedures might demonstrate that the subject is not eligible to  continue participation.  Written informed 
consent must be recorded appropriately by means of the subject’s dated signature.   
10.4. Screening Assessments/Procedures  
The Screening/Enrollment and Baseline visit may occur on the same day or on different days.  The following must be completed prior to collecting baseline data described in section 10.5:  
• Informed Consent Process, including informed consent signature

Page 49 of 90 
 
  • Not Recovered/Not Resolved 
• Resolved  
• Resolved with sequelae 
• Unknown 
 
The outcome of “unknown” should only be used for subjects who are lost to follow-up. 
Whenever possible, sites should enter a reason for each ongoing/unresolved adverse event at time of study exit.  
10.12. Local Laboratory documentation 
The laboratory (blood and urine) analysis, collected in the study will be completed at the 
local centers per standard of care. Appropriate laboratory certifications and documentation records are required to be maintained at the site .   
10.13. Source Documents  
It is preferable that original source documents are maintained, when available. In lieu of original source documents, certified copies are required to be maintained.  A certified copy is a copy (irrespective of the type of media used) of the original record that has been verified (i.e., by a dated signature or by generation through a validated process) to have the same information, including data that describe the context, content, and structure, as the original.  
 
11. Statistical Considerations  
11.1. Endpoints 
11.1.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint  – Technical Success  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the technical success of Tria™ in stone management. For 
all stents except UDS, technical success is defined as stented kidney drains (to bladder) 
during the planned indwell time with no re -intervention due to obstruction of the stented 
ureter (s). For UDS, technical success is defined as drainage following stent placement during 
the planned indwell time with no re-intervention for obstruction.  Restenting with a new 
study stent may only occur during the initial stent placement procedure for such situations as 
stent misplacement, improper stent size choice, or other conditions, as necessary and will not be considered as a primary effectiveness endpoint failure or a secon dary endpoint failure for 
stricture resolution.  
11.1.1.1. Hypotheses 
The study will evaluate whether Tria™ stents have technical  success during planned indwell 
in more than 85% in stone management. The null and alternative hypotheses for this evaluation are  
Form/Template 92120219_Rev/Ver C 
          Confidential       Double- J Ureteral Stent Registry – U0652 
92475076 #, Rev/Ver D 
Page 50 of 90 
 
     H 0:  p ≤  85% 
   H 1: p > 85% 
where p is  the proportion of ste nted ureter (s) with technical success .  
11.1.1.2. Sample Size  
There are two published studies on the patency in the stone management for Double J 
stents.   The success rates were 98% with a 95% CI [94%, 99%] (Calvert, et al., 2013) and 
96% with a 95% CI [92%, 99%] (E l-Faqih SR, 1991).  As a result, an 94% patency rate is 
estimated as the performance for the Double J stents.  T he performance goal of 85% is 
chosen for the patency for TRIA in the stone management, with a non-inferiority margin of 9%. 
With a one-sided type I error of 0.025 and a type II error of 0.10 (90% power), a sample size of 127 subjects with Tria™ placed at least 12 hours for stone management are needed to demonstrate the proportion of stented ureters with technical success exceeds 85%. Assuming a 10% attrition rate, at least 142 stone management subjects with Tria™ stent procedures where stents indwell at least 12 hours are required. 
11.1.1.3. Statistical Methods  
The hypotheses above will be evaluated based on the two- sided 95% exact Clopper -Pearson 
confidence interval for the proportion of stented  ureters with technical success . Only stents 
placed at least  12 hours will be included in the analysis. If the lower bound of the confidence 
interval exceeds 85%, the alternative hypothesis will be demonstrated. Sensitivity analysis to missing data will be performed using tipping-point analysis.  
In addition, a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) model will be used to estimate the 
technical success rate to account for within -subject correlation due to bilateral stent 
placement  if applicable . 
Descriptive statistics including 95% confidence intervals will be utilized to summarize the technical success rates for the non- stone management subjects treated with Tria™ stents 
respectively.  
For non T ria™ ureteral stent s in the study, the technical success rates will be summarized by 
descriptive statistics including 95% confidence intervals by indication ( i.e. stone 
management, benign obstruction, malignant obstruction, ureteral dysfunction, bladder cancer , 
and other as  applicable) respectively  for each device type.  Only stents placed at least 12 
hours will be included in the analysis.   
11.1.2.  Primary Safety Endpoint - SADE  
The primary safety endpoint is serious adverse device effect related to the study stent( s) 
implanted.  
Form/Template 92120219_Rev/Ver C

92475076 #, Rev/Ver D 
Page 51 of 90 
 
  11.1.2.1. Hypotheses 
There is not a pre-specified pass/fail hypothesis for this endpoint.  
11.1.2.2. Statistical Methods  
Rates of serious adverse device effects will be summarized using descriptive statistics (event 
counts, proportion of subjects with a SADE) for each study stent type implanted respectively.  
In addition, all AEs will be summarized by relatedness to procedur e and/or device for each 
study stent type implanted respectively.  
 
11.2. General Statistical Methods  
11.2.1. Analysis Sets 
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) subject population includes all subjects who provide written 
informed consent to be enrolled into the study, and have the stent placement pr ocedure 
initiated.  The As Treated (AT) Population includes all subjects for whom the sten t placement is 
completed . 
The Per Protocol (PP) population includes all subjects in the AT Population who meet all 
eligibility criteria.  
The endpoint analyses will be performed for the ITT population. The AT and  PP populations 
will be evaluated as sensiti vity analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint and the safety 
outcomes will also be assessed using the AT population. 
11.2.2. Control of Systematic Error/Bias 
All subjects will be treated according to the directions in the Operating Manual and 
IFU/DFU.  
The primary efficacy endpoint analysis based on the exact Clopper-Pearson confidence interval  is specified to be conservative in order to avoid bias towards demonstrating the 
primary hypothesis (i.e., achieving the performance goal) of the study. Furthermore, the potential of bias from missing data for the primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed through tipping point analysis.  
11.2.3. Number of Subjects per Investigative Site  
The study will be conducted at up to 35 sites. Sites will be encouraged to enroll a minimum 
of 10 subjects .

To evaluate the change in quality of life as measured by Patient -Reported Outcomes 
Measurement  System (PROMIS®) at  Stent Removal Visit compared to Index Procedure. 
 
The endpoints are Pain Interference assessed by the PROMIS Short Form v1.0 - Pain  
Interference 6b  instrument, and Pain Intensity assessed by the PROMIS Scale v1.0 – Pain 
Intensity 3a scale.   
11.3.1.1.1  Statistical Methods  
Descriptive statistics including 95% confidence intervals will be used to summarize the  pain 
interference and pain intensity at Index Proced ure, and Stent Removal  Visit along with 
change from Index Procedure for each ureteral study stent type implanted respectively  
(excluding urinary diversion stents). 
11.3.1.2. Additional Endpoint 2 - Ureteral Stent Migration  
The endpoint is  ureteral stent migration defined as any post procedure movement of the stent 
(i.e., either proximally towards the kidney or distally towards the bladder or complete distal 
migration) from its implant location; c onfirmed via imaging where necessary .  Note: 
Movement of a stent by external force or by inadvertent pulling is not considered a stent migration.  
11.3.1.2.1  Statistical Methods  
Descriptive statistics including 95% confidence intervals will be used to summarize the  
ureteral stent migration rate  for each study stent type implanted respectively.  
11.3.2. Interim Analyses  
No formal interim analyses are planned for the purpose of stopping the study early for 
declaring effectiveness or for futility.

  11.3.3. Subgroup Analyses  
The study efficacy and safety endpoints will be summarize d by indication (i.e. stone 
management, benign obstruction,  malignant obstruction, ureteral dysfunction, bladder 
cancer , and othe r as applicable) for each study stent type respectively.  
11.3.4. Justification of Pooling 
Fisher’s Exact test or Chi -squared test wil l be applied to evaluate the homogeneity of the 
technical success rates by indication (i.e. stone management, benign obstruction, malignant obstruction, ureteral dysfunction, bladder cancer, and other as  applicable) across the study 
sites for each study st ent type implanted respectively.   
11.3.5. Multivariable Analyses 
There are no planned multivariable analyses.  
11.3.6. Changes to Planned Analyses 
Any changes to the planned statistical analyses made prior to performing the analyses will be documented in an amended Statistical Analysis Plan approved prior to performing the analyses . Changes from the planned statistical methods after performing the analyses will be 
documented in the clinical study report along with a reason for the deviation. 
12. Health Econ omics Outcomes  
No formal health economics analysis is currently planned to be completed as part of this trial study. An economics analysis may be executed after the completion of this trial study. The primary safety endpoints may be used to calculate the costs associated with treating reported adverse events.   
13. Data Management  
13.1. Data Collection, Processing, and Review 
Subject data will be recorded in a limited access secure electronic data capture (EDC) system.  
The clinical database will reside on a producti on server hosted by Medidata EDC System . All 
changes made to the clinical data will be captured in an electronic audit trail and available for 
review by the sponsor or its representative. The associated Rave software and database have been designed to meet regulatory compliance for deployment as part of a validated system compliant with laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of clinical studies pertaining to the use of electronic records and signatures. Database backups are performed regularly.

  The Investigator provides his/her electronic signature on the appropriate electronic case 
report forms (eCRFs) in compliance with local regulations. A written signature on printouts of the eCRFs must also be provided if required by local regulation. Change s to data 
previously submitted to the sponsor require a new electronic signature by the Investigator acknowledging and approving the changes. 
Visual and/or electronic data review will be performed to identify possible data 
discrepancies. Manual and/or automatic queries will be created in the Medidata EDC system and will be issued to the site for appropriate response. Site staff will be responsible for resolving all queries in the database.  
All access to the clinical database will be changed to “Read only” a fter all data is either 
“Hard Locked” or “Entry Locked”. Once acceptance of the final report or finalization of publications (as applicable) is received, final database storage and archiving activities can begin. Once all of the closeout activities are com pleted a request to IT is submitted to have 
the “Database Locked” or Decommissioned and all database access revoked.  
13.2. Questionnaires  
Paper questionnaires that are completed by the subject  are transcribed into the EDC database 
by the site staff. For follow -up visits completed remotely, the paper questionnaires will be 
answered by the subject and responses documented on the paper questionnaire by the delegated research team member.   
13.3. Data Rete ntion  
The Principal Investigator or his/her designee or Investigational site will maintain  all 
essential study documents and source documentation that support the data collected on the study subjects in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.   
The Principal Investigator or his/her designee will take measures to prevent accidental or 
premature destruction of these documents. If for any reason the Principal Investigator or his/her designee withdraws responsibility for maintaining these essential documents, custody must be transferred to an individual who will assume responsibility and BSC must receive written notification of this custodial change. Sites are required to inform Boston Scientific in writing where paper or electronic files are maintained in case files are stored off site and are not readily available.  
14. Deviations  
An Investigator must not make any changes or deviate from this protocol, except to protect the life and physical well -being of a subject in an emergency. An investigator shall notify the 
sponsor and the reviewing IRB/EC /REB , and the regulatory authority if applicable, of any 
deviation from the investigational plan to protect the life or physical well-being of a subject in an emergency, and those deviations which affect the scientific integrity of the clinical investigation. Such notice shall be given as soon as possible, but no later than 5 working days

The purposes of the personal data processing will be carefully defined within the informed consent form. Personal data will not be used for a purpose other than the one stated in the informed consent provided to the subjects. Personal data shall not be disclosed, made available, 
or otherwise used, processed, transferred, or stored for purposes other than those specified in the informed consent form, except: 
• with the consent of the data subject; or 
• processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation.  
 
15.5.1. Transparency  
BSC must only collect personal data by fair and lawful means. BSC must be transparent and open with individuals about how BSC collects and uses personal data, with whom BSC shares it, and where it may be processed.  
For this transparency principle, BSC must provide information to our health care providers and their study subjects about the purpose for collecting their personal data; who will have access to the data and to whom it may be shared, if it will be accessed or transferred to another country; and who to contact with questions or requests. 
15.5.2. Rights to Data Subjects  
In GDPR, a data subject is any living individual to whom the personal data relates. A data subject includes study subjects. Data subjects shall have the right to:  
• obtain from BSC confirmation of whether BSC has data relating to the individual; 
• have data relating to them communicated: 
o within a reasonable time (within 30 days from receipt of request, extendable i f 
complicated or unclear request);  
o at a charge, if any, that is not excessive; 
o in a reasonable manner; and  
o in a form that is readily intelligible to the individual; 
• be given reasons if a request made under subparagraphs (a) and (b) is denied, and to be 
able to challenge such denial;  
• challenge data relating to the individual and, if the challenge is successful, to have the 
data erased, rectified, completed, or amended.  During the period of such challenge, the 
individual can require that access to the data be restricted;  
• "opt out"/oppose that their personal data are used for marketing purposes; and, 
• when requested, BSC must also communicate any rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. 
These rights will also be listed in the subject informed consent form.

  15.6. Insuran ce  
Where required by local/country regulation, proof and type of insurance coverage, by BSC 
for subjects in the study will be obtained. 
16. Monitoring  
Monitoring will be performed during the study to assess continued compliance with the protocol and applicable regulations. The sponsor will put a plan in place to document the specific monitoring requirements. In addition, the clinical research monitor verifies that study 
records are adequately maintained, that data are reported in a satisfactory manner with respect to timeliness, adequacy, and accuracy, and that the Principal Investigator continues to 
have sufficient staff and facilities to cond uct the study safely and effectively. The Principal 
Investigator/institution guarantees direct access to original source documents by BSC personnel, their designees, and appropriate regulatory authorities. 
The study may also be subject to a quality assuran ce audit by BSC or its designees, as well as 
inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities. It is important that the Principal  Investigator 
and relevant study personnel are available during on- site or remote monitoring visits or 
audits and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. 
17. Potential Risks and Benefits 
17.1. Instru ctions/Directions for Use  
Please refer to the Instructions/ Directions for Use (IFU/DFU) for an overview of anticipated 
adverse (device) effects and risks associated to the commercial  device(s).   
17.2. Risks associated with Participation in the Clinical Study  
The BSC ureteral stents and urinary diversion stents are commercially available devices. 
None of the procedures associated with this study fall outside of standard of care procedure. Therefore, there are no foreseen additional risks associated with the device implant procedure, testing, or withdrawal from the study.  
17.3. Possible Interactions with Concomitant Medical Treatments , if applicable 
Please refer to the individual ureteral stent IFU/ DFU for the interactions with medications 
recommended per the post procedural medication regime.   
17.4. Risk Minimization Actions  
Additional risks may exist. Risks can be minimized through compliance with this protocol, IFU/DFU, performing procedures in the appropriate hospital environment, adherence to subject selection criteria, close monitoring of the subject's physiologic status during research 
Form/Template 92120219_Rev/Ver C

Page 61 of 90 
 
  procedures and/or follow-ups and by promptly supplying BSC with all pertinent information 
required by this protocol. 
17.5. Anticipated Benefits  
The benefits of having any ureteral stent include the facilitation of drainage from the kidney, or kidney  to the bladder.  Ureteral stents may also aid the ureter as it heals after procedural 
intervention.  The information gathered from this study may help physicians worldwide develop a better understanding of the safety and efficacy of ureteral stents, li terature reported 
stent related pain and QoL  associated with stent indwell time.  
 
18. Safety Reporting 
18.1. Reportable Events  by investigational site to Boston Scientific  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to assess and report to BSC any event which occu rs 
in any of following categories f rom the time of index procedure to end of the study: 
• Serious Adverse Device Effects  
• Serious Adverse Events related to the Index Procedure (inclusive of Study Stent Implant Procedure) and/or  Study Stent Removal Procedure  
• Serious Adverse Events resulting in death (regardless of relatedness to the study device and/or procedure, i.e., Index, Stent Implant, and/or Stent Removal)  
• Device Deficiencies  
• Adverse Device Effects   
• Adverse Events related  to the Index Procedure (inclusive of Study Stent Implant 
Procedure) and/or Study Stent Removal Procedure. 
Adverse events to be reported include both anticipated and expected post procedural events (such as pain, hematuria, urgency, frequency, urinary leakage and ureteral strictures , etc.) in 
addition to any other unanticipated or unexpected events. 
When possible, the medical diagnosis should be reported as the Event Term instead of 
individual symptoms. 
If it is unclear whether  an event fits one of the above categories, or if the event cannot be 
isolated from the device or procedure, it should be submitted as an adverse event and/or 
device deficiency.  
Any reportable event s, experienced by the study subject from the time of index procedure to 
end of the study, must be recorded on an eCRF.   
It is the responsibility of investigator or designee to update eCRFs with new findings/updates in relation to already reported events as soon as they become aware.

Page 62 of 90 
 
  Underlying diseases and chronic conditions are not reported as AEs unless there is an 
increase in severity o r frequency during the investigation. Death should not be recorded as an 
AE but should only be reflected as an outcome of one (1) specific SAE (see Table 18.2 for 
safety definitions). 
Refer to IFU/DFU  for the known risks associated with the commercial device(s).

  Table 18.2: Safety Definitions  
Term  Definition  
The following definitions will be used for defining hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization for SAE 
classification purposes:  
Hospitalizations  Pre-planned, protocol -specified admission related to the clinical study (e.g. 
procedure required by protocol)Note:   
Hospitalization include:  
 
• New, unplanned admission for evaluation or treatment of an event 
occurring following stent placement,  
• Admitted to hospital for greater than or equal to 24 hrs  
Hospitalization does not include:  
• emergency room visit that does not result in in- patient admission  
Note: although an emergency room visit does not itself meet the definition for hospitalization, it may meet other serious criteria 
(e.g. medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent 
impairment or damage)  
• elective and pre -planned treatment/surgery for a pre -existing 
condition that is documented in the subject’s record at the time of consent/enrollment  
• admission for social reasons and/or respite care in the absence of any deterioratio n in the subject’s general condition (e.g. subject is 
homeless, caregiver relief)  
Prolongation of  
hospitalization  In-patient admission to the hospital that is prolonged beyond the expected 
standard duration for the condition under treatment.  
Note: new adverse events occurring during the hospitalization are evaluated 
to determine if they prolonged hospitalization or meet another SAE criteria.  
 
18.3. Relationship to Device(s) , Index Procedure (including Study Stent Implant 
Procedure), and/or Study Stent Removal Procedure 
The Investigator must assess the relationship of the reportable AE to the device, and/or Index 
procedure (including Study Stent Implant Procedure), and /or the study stent removal 
procedure . See criteria in  Table 18.3 .

(including Study Stent Implant Procedure ), and Study Stent  Removal Procedure to 
Adverse Event  
Classification  Description  
Not Related  
Ref: MDCG 2020- 10/1 
 Relationship to the device , comparator or procedures can be excluded when:  
- the event has no temporal relationship with the use of the study device or the 
procedures  related to the use of the study device ; 
- the serious event does not follow a known response pattern to the medical device 
(if the r esponse pattern is previously known) and is biologically implausible;  
- the discontinuation of medical device application or the reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure - when clinically feasible – and reintroduction of its use (or 
increase of the level of activation/exposure), do not impact on the serious event;  
- the event involves a body- site, or an organ  that cannot  be affected by the device 
or procedure;  
- the serious event can be attributed to another cause (e.g. an underlying  
or concurrent illness/ clinical condition, an effect of another device, drug, treatment 
or other risk factors);  
- the event does not depend on a false result given by the study device used for 
diagnosis, when applicable;  
- In order to establish the non- relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be 
met at the same time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the serious 
event.  
Possibly Related  
Ref: MDCG 2020- 10/1 
 The relationship with the use of the study device or comparator, or the relationship 
with procedures  is weak but cannot be ruled out completely. Alternative causes are 
also possible (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical condition or/and an 
effect of another device, drug or treatment). Cases w here relatedness cannot be 
assessed or no information has been obtained should also be classified as possible.  
Probably Related  
Ref: MDCG 2020- 10/1 
 The relationship with the use of the study  device, or comparator, or the relationship 
with procedures  seems relevant and/or the event cannot  be reasonably explained by 
another cause .

(including Study Stent Implant Procedure ), and Study Stent  Removal Procedure to 
Adverse Event  
Classification  Description  
Causal Relationship  
Ref: MDCG 2020- 10/1 
 The serious event is associated with the study device, comparator  or with 
procedures beyond reasonable doubt when:  
- the event is a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to or 
of similar devices and procedures;  
- the event has a temporal relationship with  the study  device use/application or 
procedures;  
- the event involves a body- site or organ that  
-the study device or procedures are applied to;  
-the study device or procedures influence ; 
- the serious event follows a known response pattern to the medical device (if the 
response pattern is previously known);  
- the discontinuation of medical device application (or reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure)  and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of 
activation/exposure), impact on the serious event (when clinically feasible);  
- other possible causes (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical condition 
or/and an effect of another devi ce, drug or treatment) have been adequately ruled 
out; 
- harm to the subject is due to error in use;  
- the event depends on a false result given by the study  device used for diagnosis, 
when applicable;  
- In order to establish the relatedness, not all the c riteria listed above might be met 
at the same time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the serious event.  
 
18.4. Investigator Reporting Requirements  
The communication requirements for reporting to BSC are as shown in Table 18.4. These 
events should be reported via electronic data capture (EDC) system and may be reported via phone, or email if the EDC system is unavailable. The paper AE Notification Form or Device Deficiency  Notification Form should be used to report AEs and D evice Deficiencies  as 
applicable during this time  when the EDC system is unavailable .

18.5. Study  Device Deficiencies   
Device deficiencies , for BSC Ureteral Stents  and BSC Urinary Diversion Stents wil l be 
documented and reported to BSC. Device deficiencies  should also be documented in the 
subject’s source records. 
Stent migrations and stent dislodgements should be reported as potential device deficiencies.  Stent mi gration  is defined as any post procedure movement of the stent (either proximally 
towards the kidney or distally towards the bladder or complete distal migration) from its 
implant location; confirmed via imaging where necessary.  
Stent dislodgement  is defi ned as removal of the stent during the planned indwell time by 
external for ce or inadvertent pulling. 
Device deficiencies are not adverse events. However, an adverse event that results from a 
device deficiency , should be recorded as an adverse event on the appropriate eCRF. 
18.6. Reporting to Regulatory Authorities / IRBs / ECs / REBs/ Investigators 
BSC is responsible for reporting adverse event information to all participating Principal Investigators , IRBs /ECs/REBs  and regulatory author ities, as applicable.  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB/EC /REB , and regulatory 
authorities of SAEs as required by local/regional regulations. 
18.7. Subject Death Reporting   
A subject death that occurs during the study should be reported to Boston Scientific as soon as possible and, in any event, within three (3) calendar days of site notification. The site’s

Page 69 of 90 
 
  IRB/EC/REB must be notified of any deaths in accordance with that site’s IRB/EC/REB 
policies and procedures.  
Notification of death should include a narrative that provides detailed information describing 
the circumstances surrounding the death. The details listed below should be addressed in the death narrative, for BSC to understand the circumstance surrounding the death: 
• Date of death 
• Immediate cause of death  
• Whether the death was related to the study device or procedure 
• Any other circumstances surrounding the death  
• Investigator or sub-investigator signature and date  
Also submit the following documentation:  
• If the Subject  expired in the hospital:  
o A copy of the medical records for that admission (e.g., H & P, consults, test results, operative reports, and/or progress notes from the hospital chart)  
o Death certificate (if available)  
o Autopsy report (if applicable)  
• If the Su bject  expired  outside of the hospital (e.g., home):  
o A copy of the most recent clinic visit (if not already submitted to Boston Scientific)  
o Death certificate (if available)   
o Autopsy report (if applicable)  
The Independent Medical Reviewer will review information regarding subject deaths. 
19. Informed Consent  
Subject participation in this clinical study is voluntary.  Informed Consent is required from each subject or his/her legally authorized representative. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that Informed Consent is obtained prior to the use of any study devices, study-required procedures and/or testing, or data collection.  
The obtaining and documentation of Informed Consent must be in accordance with the 
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, ISO 14155, any applicable national regulations, and local Ethics Committee and/or Regulatory authority, as applicable. The ICF must be accepted  
by BSC or it s delegate (e.g. CRO ) and  approved by the site’s IRB/EC/REB , or central IRB, if 
applicable.

  Boston Scientific will provide a study- specific template of the ICF to investigators 
participating in this study. The ICF template may be modified to meet the requirements of the 
investigative site’s IRB/EC/REB .  Any modification requires acceptance from BSC prior to 
use of the form.  The ICF must be in a language understandable to the subject and if needed, BSC will assist the site in obtaining a written consent translation. Translated consent forms must also have IRB/EC /REB  approval prior to their use.  Privacy language shall be included 
in the body of the form or as a separate form as applicable.   
The process of obtaining Informed Consent shall at a minimum include the following steps, as well as any other steps required by applicable laws, rules, regulations and guidelines: 
• be conducted by the Principal Investigator or designee authorized to conduct the process,  
• include a description of all aspects of the clinical study that are relevant to the subject’s decision to participate throughout the clinical study,  
• avoid any coercion of or undue influence of subjects to participate, 
• not waive or appear to waive subject’s legal rights,  
• use native language that is non-technical and understandable to the subject or his/her legal representative,  
• provide ample time for the subject to consider participation and ask questions if necessary,  
• ensure important new information is provided to new and existing subjects throughout the clinical study.
  
The ICF shall always be signed and personally dated by the subje ct or legal representative 
competent to sign the ICF under the applicable laws, rules, regulations and guidelines and by the investigator and/or an authorized designee responsible for conducting the informed consent process. If a legal representative signs, the subject shall be asked to provide informed consent for continued participation as soon as his/her medical condition allows. The original signed ICF will be retained by the site and a copy of the signed and dated document and any other written informa tion must be given to the person signing the form.  
Failure to obtain subject consent will be reported by BSC to the applicable regulatory authority according to their requirements (e.g., FDA requirement is within 5 working days of learning of such an event). Any violations of the informed consent process must be reported as deviations to the sponsor and local regulatory authorities (e.g. IRB/EC /REB ), as 
appropriate. 
If new information becomes available that can significantly affect a subject's future healt h 
and medical care, that information shall be provided to the affected subject(s) in written form 
via a revised ICF or, in some situations, enrolled subjects may be requested to sign and date an addendum to the ICF.

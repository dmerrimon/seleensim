 To create a database of stool images scored by mothers that are 
suitable for Danone software development purposes 
 To create a database containing at least 200 pictures of diapers 
containing fecal (stool) material per each stool consistency score 
(type 1 to 7) of the BITSS (Brussels Infant and Toddler Stool Scale) 
and 200 images of empty (no stool) disposable diapers 
 
Exploratory

NOTE: If participants upload a low number of quality images due to 
infant/toddler constipation and infrequency of stooling, the mother 
may be asked if she would like to continue in the study for an 
additional >30 days or more. If she chooses to continue, she may do 
so as long as images continue to be provided at a reasonable 
frequency and/or until stool strata are satisfied (at the PI
discretion).

Study 
Implementation Prescreening : Administer the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
eQuestionnaire to mother which includes 
estimated stool frequency and consistency (e.g., liquid, soft/mushy, 
solid, firm, hard). After  information is 
shown to satisfy predetermined prescreen criteria (including 
distribution by groups), the mother will be provided access to the 
ClaimIt app along with the following information: 
 How to complete the electronic informed consent (eIC), 
screening and enrollment process 
 Overview of trial tasks and relevant notifications 
 ClaimIt navigation: How to interact with the ClaimIt app 
during the observation period  
 Additional study details & instructions on how to take high-
quality, standardized pictures with proper lighting 
 All relevant contact information that may be required during 
the study 
          
 
Screening: The mother will complete a detailed eQuestionnaire for 
confirmation of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The mother will also 
stool via ClaimIt, each with a corresponding score based on her 
judgment made in comparison with the BITSS scoring tool. Images 
must be uploaded within 10 days of receiving ClaimIt app access. 
 
An adaptive recruitment approach will be leveraged to ensure that 
200 pictures of each stool type are collected over the duration of 
the study.  
The mother and infant/toddler will be enrolled into the study if the 
test images are successfully uploaded, and they meet all the 
inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria for the study, 
based on the  judgment and appropriate fit into predetermined 
bowel function strata. 
Observation Period:  The mother will be asked to interact with the 
ClaimIt app daily for 30 days (or longer) as follows: 
 Two empty (no stool) disposable diaper images are to be 
uploaded: one at Baseline and one at End of Study 
o Images should be taken of the type of disposable 
diaper used most frequently for the infant/toddler 
Study Number: OBVIO-DAN-002 
Protocol   
V2 12OCT2018 
Page 11 of 44 
 
o Additional empty (no stool) disposable diaper images 
may only be submitted if the brand/type of diaper 
changes; if the diaper size changes, no additional 
pictures need to be uploaded 
 Stool images will be taken with a smartphone (or alternative 
suitable for capturing and transmitting high-quality 
electronic images) and uploaded daily:  
o Mothers will be given instructions on how to take 
high-quality, standardized pictures with proper 
lighting 
o Every bowel movement is to be imaged, potentially 
providing several images per day 
o Mothers who have not submitted at least one image 
in the previous 24-hour period will be sent 
notifications to encourage compliance  
o Only 1 representative image per bowel movement is 
to be transmitted 
 Along with each stool image uploaded, the mother will rate 
the stool characteristic type on the BITSS (type 1 to 7); scores 
will be based only on consistency and not color 
 
End of Observation Period:   
 The mother will be asked to complete an eQuestionnaire to 
assess and comment on the usability of the ClaimIt app and 
the scoring process (Appendix V) 
 Two mothers who were not enrolled in the study will be 
provided a collection of study stool images and asked to re-
score each image according to the BITSS 
Statistical 
Considerations 
 A sample size of 100 subjects is estimated with the following 
considerations: 
 Progression of potential subjects will be gated at the 
prescreening and screening steps to facilitate enrollment of 
an appropriately diversified set of infants/toddlers based on 
bowel patterns to reach 200 images per each stool 
consistency score (type 1 to 7) of the BITSS  
 The Sponsor and ObvioHealth will review the distribution of 
the scores and image quality and will determine when the 
prescreening requirements can be modified 
 A comparison will be made between the stool consistency 
scores from the mothers on-study to re-scores from mothers 
(not enrolled on-study) based only on the uploaded images 
Study Number: OBVIO-DAN-002

 Based on Sponsor review of the data, the following may be 
performed: 
o A post hoc analysis  
o Descriptive summary statistics for categorical and 
quantitative data  
 The expectation is that not all the mothers will be compliant 
with study tasks for all 30 days 
 A dropout rate of 15% is anticipated (if dropout rate exceeds 
15%, replacements will be made for all additional 
withdrawals)

5 Introduction  
 
Accurately classifying stool consistency for infants and toddlers who are not yet toilet trained 
remains challenging. A recent study showed that among parents of infants and toddlers, only 
fair agreement existed between the parental report of stool consistency and the Bristol Stool 
Form Scale (BSS),1 a gold standard in the classification of stool consistency in adults and older 
children who are toilet trained.2 While there are alternative assessment methods which are 
used in clinical practice, such as the modified BSS and the Amsterdam Infant Stool Scale, a 
universally-accepted tool does not exist.3 The Brussels Infant and Toddler Stool Scale (BITSS) 
was recently initiated based on the BSS to provide a classification tool to describe stool 
consistency for infants and toddlers.4  
This observational study is designed to collect a series of images that span the range of stool 
consistencies associated with the stools of infants and toddlers to create a significant and 
varied photographic image database.  For essentially healthy infants/toddlers (0-24 months) 
stool consistencies range from liquid (frequently associated with diarrhea) to hard formed 
(frequently associated with constipation) stools. This database will be used to assist in the 
further development of Danone software to facilitate evaluation of stool type remotely and 
permit evaluation beyond the interpretation of parents. The study is designed to collect at 
least 1600 images: at least 200 images per stool score (type 1 to 7) of the BITSS (at least 1400 
total) plus 200 images of empty (no stool) diapers, generating further data to assist in the 
assessment and classification of infant/toddler stools and gastrointestinal function.

7.3 Endpoints 
Primary Endpoint :  
Creation of a database containing at least 1600 images:  
 At least 200 images of disposable diapers containing stool per each score (type 1 
to 7) of the BITSS  
 At least 200 images of empty (no stool) disposable diapers  
Study Number: OBVIO-DAN-002 
Protocol   
V2 12OCT2018 
Page 16 of 44 
 
Exploratory Endpoints:  
 A comparison of the stool consistency scores from the mothers on-study to re-
scores from mothers (not enrolled on-study) based only on the uploaded images  
 An assessment of the usability of the stool scoring process  
 An assessment of the usability of the ClaimIt app  
7.4 Participants and Location 
7.4.1 Participants 
Study participants will include the mother and their infant/toddler. The 
prescreening recruitment process will be administered through an online 
eQuestionnaire to the mother evaluating the typical stool and consistency (e.g., 
liquid, soft/mushy, solid, hard).   
7.4.2 Location 
The trial will be conducted remotely in the United States. Communication 
between mothers and study personnel will be conducted via the internet 
(ClaimIt platform) and/or over the telephone or email messaging as 
appropriate. 
7.5 Study Duration 
It is expected that the enrollment period will be five (5) months in total. 
The expected study duration is 30 days per mother and infant/toddler. If a participant 
uploads a low number of quality images due to infant/toddler constipation and 
infrequency of stooling, a member of the study team may contact the mother to ask if 
she wants to continue with study for an additional 30 days or more. If she chooses to 
continue, they may do so as long as images continue to be provided at a reasonable 
frequency and/or until stool strata are satisfied (at the discretion).

8 Study Population 
 
It is expected that the infant and their mother will sustain these eligibility criteria for the 
duration of their enrollment.  
8.1 Subject Inclusion Criteria 
Subjects must meet the following: 
 Healthy infants/toddlers (0-24 months of age at time of enrollment)  
 Informed consent from mother  
 In-home access to reliable internet connections; a smartphone (or alternative 
suitable for capturing and transmitting high-quality electronic images) as per the 
PIdiscretion  
 The infant/toddler consumes age-appropriate, standard food (breastmilk; 
formula; commercial/homemade baby, table or finger food) 
 Based on the number of stool images already acquired per relevant strata at time 
of enrollment, the infant/toddler may or may not be required to regularly produce 
stools scored as a Score 1, 2, 6 or 7 (per Appendix II) 
Study Number: OBVIO-DAN-002 
Protocol   
V2 12OCT2018 
Page 18 of 44 
 
8.2 Subject Exclusion Criteria 
Mothers of Infants/Toddlers: 
 The use of cloth diapers (mothers must commit to using disposable diapers for the 
duration of the study) 
 Known to have a significant condition (including during pregnancy) that might 
interfere with the study compliance, as per PI's clinical judgment 
 Deemed likely to be non-compliant with the study protocol, as per PI's clinical 
judgment 
8.3 Subject Withdrawal Criteria 
Mothers and their infants/toddlers may be withdrawn from the study at any time and 
for any reasons including but not limited to the following: 
1) At their request or the request of their legally authorized representative. 
2) If, in the PI's opinion, continuation in the study would be detrimental to the 
-being. 
3) Poor compliance: if the mother and infant/toddler consistently do not adhere to 
the study procedures (per the discretion). 
4) Protocol deviation(s) which in the opinion of Sponsor warrant discontinuation 
from the study; e.g., violation of inclusion and/or exclusion criteria. 
Study Note: If the infant/toddler experiences an illness (other than 
diarrhea/constipation) lasting longer than 7 days, has surgery or is 
admitted to the hospital for more than 24 hours, they should be 
withdrawn from the study immediately.  
Due to the 15% dropout rate built into the estimated total sample size, subjects whose 
study participation is terminated prematurely for any of the above-listed criteria will 
not be replaced.  If the dropout rate exceeds 15%, replacements will be made for all 
additional withdrawals. The PI will make every effort to contact subjects lost to follow-
up during the study.  Attempts to contact the subject will be documented in the 
, dates and times of attempted telephone contact).

10 Execution of the Trial 
10.1 Screening and Enrollment 
Prescreening: 
The prescreening recruitment step will recruit healthy infants/toddlers (0-24 months 
of age at enrollment) residing in the United States through an online eQuestionnaire 
administered to the mother. Questions will include an estimation of the frequency of 
stools of varied consistency (e.g., liquid, soft/mushy, solid, firm, hard). After satisfying 
predetermined prescreen criteria (including distribution by groups), the mother will be 
provided access to the ClaimIt app along with the following information: 
 Overview of trial tasks and relevant notifications 
 Instruction on how to complete the electronic informed consent (eIC), screening 
and enrollment process 
 Instruction on how to interact with the ClaimIt app during the observation period 
 Additional study details & instructions  
The mother will be sent an electronic consent (eIC) for review and will have the 
opportunity to ask questions and receive answers either through online 
communication or in-person telephone conversation.  Mothers who choose to 
participate will voluntarily sign an eIC as instructed by the ClaimIt app. 
Screening and Enrollment 
After the eIC is voluntarily signed, a detailed eQuestionnaire for confirmation of 
inclusion and exclusion criteria will be administered to the mother. She will also be 
with a corresponding score, within 10 days of receiving ClaimIt app access. The mother 
and infant/toddler will be enrolled into the study if the mother successfully uploads 
the test images and scores and meets all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria 
for the study based on PI judgment. Depending on the distribution of stool images 
already acquired per score, the mothers and infant/toddlers may be further qualified 
based on the likelihood of filling gaps in the image collection. 
Study Number: OBVIO-DAN-002 
Protocol   
V2 12OCT2018 
Page 22 of 44 
 
This adaptive recruitment approach will be leveraged to ensure that 200 pictures of 
each type are collected over the duration of the study. The enrollment of potential 
subjects will be gated at either (or both) the prescreening and screening steps based 
on the   
The sponsor (Danone) and the CRO (ObvioHealth) will review images and the 
BITSS scores to assess the overall distribution of images per each score and will 
determine when the prescreening requirements can be modified. Total study 
enrollment may be expanded or modified until target values are attained.  
10.2 Data Collection 
The mother will be asked to interact with the ClaimIt app daily for 30 days (or more) as 
follows:  
 Stool images will be taken with a smartphone (or alternative suitable for 
capturing and transmitting high-quality, electronic images) and uploaded daily 
 Every bowel movement will be photographed, potentially providing several 
images per day 
o Only 1 representative image per bowel movement should be transmitted 
 If the mother has not uploaded an image in 24 hours, a notification and the 
Compliance eQuestionnaire requiring a response will be sent to her (Appendix IV) 
 The following steps should be taken to ensure the image quality: 
o The picture should be taken in a well-lit room and with sufficient lighting on 
the diaper itself; pictures should not be taken in rooms requiring flash 
o The diaper should be placed on a table or area apart from any other objects; 
primarily only the soiled portion of the diaper should be in the picture 
o The diaper must be fully opened, and the contents must be clearly visible in 
the photograph 
Study Number: OBVIO-DAN-002 
Protocol   
V2 12OCT2018 
Page 23 of 44 
 
o The camera should be zoomed-in as appropriate and focused on the stool 
itself 
 The image will include all the stool while excluding as much of the 
dry diaper as is reasonable  
o The pictures should be taken within 10 minutes after the child has soiled 
the diaper 
 Images in which the stool form is not recognizable (e.g., stools that 
have been distorted or significantly smushed) should not be 
uploaded 
 Along with each stool image uploaded, mothers will rate the stool consistency 
type compared to examples provided by the BITSS (Score 1 to 7) 
o Scoring will be based only on consistency, not color 
o Sample images of each score will be provided 
 A total of two empty (no stool) disposable diapers, spread open, are to be 
submitted: one at Baseline and one at the End of Study 
o Images should be taken of the type of diaper used most frequently for the 
infant/toddler  
o Additional empty (no stool) disposable diaper images may only be 
submitted if the brand/type of diaper is changed; if only the diaper size 
changes, no additional pictures need to be uploaded 
10.3 End of Study 
At the end of the study, the mother will be asked to complete an eQuestionnaire to 
assess and comment on the usability of the ClaimIt app and the scoring process 
(Appendix V). 
Study Number: OBVIO-DAN-002 
Protocol   
V2 12OCT2018 
Page 24 of 44 
 
Also, the Sponsor will identify two mothers who were not enrolled in the study. They 
will be provided a collection of uploaded study images and asked to re-score each 
image according to the BITSS.  
10.4 Application Description 
The ClaimIt app is a mobile application available to study participants during their 
period of enrollment so they can perform certain study-related tasks and receive and 
transmit communications from and to the CRO staff. 
10.5 Monitoring  
The study will be monitored on an ongoing basis beginning with enrollment of the first 
mother and infant/toddler and continuing through the study exit of the last enrolled 
pair. Regular monitoring will be done by the designated ObvioHealth personnel during 
the study. The monitoring activities will be detailed in a monitoring plan. The following 
measures are in place to ensure consistent and regular engagement by the mother: 
 Dedicated study personnel will maintain contact with the mother to answer 
questions about the study or the ClaimIt app, as necessary   
 In some circumstances, the PI or study team personnel may call the mother to 
determine the compliance with study protocol  
 Study team (Sponsor and CRO members) will review  the BITSS scores provided by 
the mothers to assess the distribution of strata and daily compliance which 
includes: 
o Adherence to study protocol; including sustained quality of images 
o Proper uploading of the images in a timely manner 
 If the mother has not uploaded an image in the previous >24 hours, a notification 
and the Compliance eQuestionnaire will be sent (Appendix IV) 
Since there are no physical sites involved in this protocol, monitoring will be 
implemented throughout the study via remote data reviews. The monitor will check 
Study Number: OBVIO-DAN-002 
Protocol   
V2 12OCT2018 
Page 25 of 44 
 
eCRF data for completeness and consistency. Protocol deviations will be reported in 
the monitoring report and a corrective action plan implemented, as necessary. The 
monitor will communicate any detected protocol deviations to the PI. These deviations 
will be recorded in a Protocol Deviation Log. 
Electronic CRFs (eCRFs) will be completed by the mother for their infant/toddler. Data 
from the completed eCRF will then be reviewed by the designated study team member 
and if any errors are identified, they may be corrected consistent with the Data 
Handling Conventions (DHC) or may be addressed through direct contact with the 
mother. 
10.6 Computerized Data Entry - Security and Privacy of User Data 
All data is hosted on Microsoft Azure service. All ObvioHealth employees and their 
affiliates are bound by strict confidentiality agreements.  Transport Layer Security (TLS) 
is used to secure all data in transit.     
10.7 Computerized Edit Checks 
The database will incorporate the needed programmed edit checks to help ensure 
quality data.  Messages to the mother may be generated automatically to alert her to 
any entry error.  
10.8 Audit Trail 
All entries and alterations made in the database will be captured by an audit trail in 
which the individuals accessing the database and providing entries and/or making 
alterations are identified via their user IDs and passwords. 
11 Statistics                 
11.1 Sample Size Calculations 
A sample size of 100 subjects is estimated to be sufficient to collect images of at least 
200 pictures of diapers containing fecal (stool) material per score (type 1 to 7) of the 
BITSS plus 200 images of empty (no stool) disposable diapers.

Confidentiality of all study participants will be maintained; codes for subject 
identification will be utilized.  Subjects will review and complete the HIPAA 
release of information form during the eIC process. 
12.2.2 Informed Consent 
Electronic Informed Consent (eIC) signed by the subject indicating their consent 
to her participation in the study is required.  This will 
be completed prior to conducting any study-related activities and will be done 
in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements. 
The eIC will inform the mother about all aspects of study participation. 
Dedicated study personnel will be available to the parent to answer questions 
about the study or the informed consent.  The IRB/EC will approve the eIC.  Any 
amendments to these documents must be approved by the IRB/EC. 
The mother must sign the eIC prior to the initiation of any study-related 
activities beyond prescreening.   
The decision to participate in the study is entirely voluntary.  The PI and/or 
his/her designee must emphasize to the mother that the consent to participate 
can be withdrawn at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the 
mother and infant/toddler are otherwise entitled.

Administrative Change 2 10 March 2015
Administrative Change 3 21 May 2015
The purpose of this amendment is to:  
● Throughout protocol:  Reduce sample size population from 334 t o 
approximately 200 enrolled subjects.
Rationale:   The sample size was evaluated to ensure a certain level of 
precision for the estimation of the correlation coefficient between Baseline 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) score and the occurrence of flare.  
Recently published data have shown overall a high rate of flare/relapse/treatment failure and that sub-clinical synovitis might be a 
predictor of flare upon biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug 
(bDMARD) withdrawal.  Based on the review of these data, a sample size of 150 in the dose tapering arm has been recalculated to meet the study 
objectives.
● Section 1.2, Synopsis, Section 3.3.1, Additional Considerations on Key Study 
Parameters, Section 5.1, Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description, 
Section 5.2.1, Inclusion Criteria, Inclusion Criterion 4, Section 5.2.2, 
Exclusion Criteria, Exclusion Criterion 1, Section 5.3.1.1, Study Procedures, 
allow for 3 variables of the Disease Activity Score DAS28 (c-re active protein 
(CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)) to satisfy inclu sion criteria 
purposes of patients in stable remission defined as DAS28 < 2.6 for 
≥ 6 months and exclusion criteria of patients with DAS28 (CRP or ESR) 
≥ 2.6 within 6 months prior to Screening.
Rationale:   To align with clinical practice and other clinical studies when the 
Patient Global Assessment (PGA) is not routinely documented and because the 
DAS28 with three variables is validated.

● Section 1.2, Synopsis, Section 5.1, Overall Study Design and Plan:  
Description:  Inclusion Criteria 3, 5, 6 and 7, change period of time for 
required stable medications (e.g., methotrexate (MTX) stable dose for ≥ 12 weeks; other DMARDS at stable dose for ≥ 12 weeks and 
steroids/NSAIDs stable for ≥ 4 weeks) up to Week 0 instead of u p to 
Screening.
Rationale:   As per previous studies and treatment effect of csDMARDs, a 
period of stable medication prior to inclusion (and not screening) is enough to 
ensure medication which could affect risk of flare is stable.
● Section 1.2, Synopsis, Section 3.3.1, Additional Considerations on Key Study 
Parameters, Section 5.2.3.1, Prior Therapy, Section 5.6.3, Suitability of 
Subject Population, Inclusion Criterion 3, allow for up to 20% of subjects to be 
included in the study if on stable other csDMARDs and/or on mon otherapy 
adalimumab (no csDMARDs) for at least 12 weeks prior to Week 0.  Once the limit of 20% of enrolled subjects on other csDMARDs or no csDMARDs is met, only subjects on concomitant methotrexate will be allowed into the trial.
Rationale:   To align with clinical routine practice as shown in several 
registries and other real world evidence in which around 30%– 34% of 
patients are not taking concomitant MTX with a bDMARD and still include the 
majority of patients treated with concomitant stable MTX.  The primary 
analysis of association between baseline MRI and flare remain unchanged.  Concomitant use of treatment will be examined in the sensitivity analysis to 
account for potential differential effect.
● Section 1.2, Synopsis, clarify language regarding MRI scans.
Rationale:   To clarify that if both hands/wrists are affected then the dominant 
hand and wrist should be scanned.
● Section 1.2, Synopsis and Section 5.2.3.2, Concomitant Therapy, Inclusion 
Criterion 3, add that intra-muscular methotrexate is allowed as  a concomitant 
therapy.
Rationale:   To align with current methotrexate therapies. 
● Section 1.2, Synopsis, increase potential number of sites and countries wh ere 
the study will be conducted.
Adalimumab
M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26

Rationale:   To accurately reflect the number of sites and countries that are 
planned to ensure timely enrollment of the study. 
● Section 1.2, Synopsis, Section 5.1, Overall Study Design and Plan:  
Description, Section 5.3.1 , Efficacy and Safety Measurements Assessed and 
Flow Chart, extend screening period to up to 28 days (instead of 21); screening 
may be exceptionally extended upon justification and further co nsultation with 
the Study Designated Physician.
Rationale:   To allow enough time for screening procedures and to align the 
Week 0 visit with the pre-scheduled adalimumab injection. 
● Section 1.2, Synopsis, Section 5.1, Overall Study Design and Plan:  
Description:, allow for an extension of the Lead-in Period to u p to 6 weeks 
(instead of 4 weeks) if required to provide enough time for Lea d-in procedures.
Rationale:   To align the Week 4 visit with the next pre-scheduled adalimumab 
injection and to provide adequate time for study procedures during the lead-in 
period (namely MRI) prior to Baseline Week 4 Visit.
● Section 1.2, Synopsis, Inclusion Criterion 7, include the use of tramadol or 
other equivalent opioids and/or non-opioid analgesics to be at a stable dose 
and/or therapeutic scheme for at least 4 weeks prior to the Wee k 0 visit.
Rationale:   To allow for other equivalent opioids to Tramadol available in 
some countries to be used. 
● Section 5.1, Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description, add further 
clarification on the importance of stopping commercial adalimumab when the 
subject enrolls in the study. 
Rationale:   To ensure subjects are not taking commercial adalimumab during 
the study. 
● Section 5.1, Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description, increase the dos ing 
window during the double-blind period to ± 3 days.Rationale:   To allow for flexibility of scheduling within a period which does 
not affect treatment efficacy and allows for adjustment of the visit scheduling 
accommodating weekends.

● Section 5.1, Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description, allow for a local 
MRI report to be viewed for safety reasons on findings not related to 
rheumatoid arthritis.
Rationale:   To ensure the safety of the subject. 
● Section 5.1, Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description, clarify that dur ing 
the Open-Label Rescue Arm csDMARDs including MTX (initiation an d/or 
dose or administration mode change) are included.  Excluded csD MARDs that 
are not allowed include azathioprine, cyclophosphamide and d-pe nicilamine.
Rationale:   To ensure the safety of the subject while on rescue therapy. 
● Section 5.1, Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description, Table 1 , Study 
Activities, table note "d.," add an option for a shortened Earl y Termination 
Visit for those subjects terminating the study in the Lead-in p eriod from 
Week 0 up to Week 4. 
Rationale:   To allow for a shortened version of the Early Termination Visit
(reasons for discontinuation, review of adverse events and Investigational 
Product and Diary return)  for those subjects on open-label adalimumab who 
have not yet been randomized since these subjects have not changed any of 
their previous treatment and will not be analyzed for the primary or secondary objectives. 
● Section 5.1, Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description, add that all subjects 
who discontinue the study will have a follow-up phone call appr oximately 
70 days after the last administration of study drug. 
Rationale:   To obtain information on any new or ongoing adverse events for 
all subjects.
● Revised timing of first dose of Open-Label Rescue arm at the F lare 
Unscheduled Visit in Section 5.1, Overall Study Design and Plan:  
Description.
Rationale:   To allow for an immediate start of the Open-Label Rescue Arm (at 
least 1 day after last dose).
● Add "A CXR may be required for evaluation of active TB" in Tab le 1, Study 
Activities, table note "g.," Section 5.1, Overall Study Design and Plan:  
Description.

Rationale:   To reinforce that a CXR may be required to evaluate active TB.
● Section 5.2.2, Exclusion Criteria, remove azathioprine from exclusion criter ia 
to allow for patients who have been previously, but are not cur rently, treated 
with azathioprine and who have no other severe diseases to be included.
Rationale:   Patients who are in clinical remission for at least 6 months and on 
treatment with adalimumab for at least 1 year are not expected to develop any 
prior azathioprine exposure related complications as per absence of evidence 
in a literature review.
● Section 5.2.3.1, Prior Therapy, Section 5.2.3.2, Concomitant Therapy, allow 
for a decrease in the dose of methotrexate or other csDMARDS during the 12 weeks prior to Week 0 and throughout the study. 
Rationale:   To allow for a dose decrease in the case of an event of 
intolerability (or other safety issues) related to methotrexate or other 
csDMARDs.
● Section 5.2.3.1, Prior Therapy, allow for an interruption of up to 
two non-consecutive doses of adalimumab within the past 12 month s but not 
during the 12 weeks prior to Week 0 if due to a non-RA related event 
(e.g., infection, surgery).
Rationale:   To align with clinical practice and product interruptions due to, 
for example, an infection as also described in prescribing information.
● Section 5.2.3.2, Concomitant Therapy, add that subjects should take a dietary 
supplement of oral folic acid 5 mg once weekly "or per local gu idelines per the 
investigator's discretion" if taking concomitant MTX.Rationale:   To allow for folic acid dosage to conform with current clinical 
practice per local guidelines.
● Correct timing of urine pregnancy test collection from the Bas eline visit to 
Week 0 in Table 1, Study Activities, table note "l.," Section 5.3.1, Efficacy and 
Safety Measurements Assessed and Flow Chart, and also in Section 5.3.1.1, 
Study Procedures.Rationale:   To correct an inadvertent error.  Urine pregnancy test is due at 
the Week 0 visit and not Baseline visit per Exclusion Criterion 21.

used to calculate the DAS 28 (ESR) on the day of the current visit. 
● Section 5.3.1.1, Study Procedures, add that the 3 variable DAS28 (ESR) score 
can be used to evaluate flare during the trial when the PGA score is not 
available upon discussion with the Study Designated Physician.
Rationale:   To allow for evaluation of the flare when the PGA score is not 
available through the electronic reported outcome devices. 
● Clarify in Section 5.3.1.1 , Study Procedures, that the Clinical Disease Activity 
Index (CDAI) and Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) will be 
calculated as part of the statistical analysis.  Calculation is  not required by the 
site.
Rationale: To clarify that calculation is not required by the site.

Name of Active Ingredient:   Adalimumab Date of Protocol Synopsis:   25 February 2016
Protocol Title:
A Phase 4 Trial Assessing the Im Pact of Residual Inflammation Detected via Imaging T Echniques Drug 
Levels and Patient Characteristics on the Outcome of Dose Taper Ing of Adalimumab in C linical 
Remission Rheumatoid Ar Thritis ( RA) Subjects ( PREDICTRA )
Objectives:
The primary objective is to investigate the association between residual disease activity at Baseline as 
detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the occurrence of flares in RA subjects randomized 
to an adalimumab dose tapering regimen controlled by adalimumab withdrawal.
The Secondary Objectives are:
!To assess the occurrence and severity of flares and the time to  flare in both taper and withdrawal 
arms.
!To investigate the association between Double-Blind Baseline (d bBaseline) subject 
demographic and disease characteristics and the occurrence of flares.
!To investigate the association between dbBaseline adalimumab trough concentrations and the 
occurrence of flares.
!To evaluate the effectiveness of rescue therapy with open-label  adalimumab 40 mg every other 
week (eow) over 16 weeks in subjects experiencing a flare. 
!To assess the change in rheumatoid arthritis MRI scoring system  (RAMRIS) scores from 
Baseline to Final visit in the taper, withdrawal and Open-Label  Rescue Arms.
!To investigate the MRI-flare associations in sub-groups of subj ects who meet additional clinical 
remission criteria at dbBaseline including simplified disease a ctivity index (SDAI) ≤ 3.3, 
clinical diseases activity index (CDAI) ≤ 2.8 and ACR/EULAR 2011 boolean-based remission, 
as well as to describe the course of disease and patient report ed outcome (PRO) measures in the 
taper, withdrawal and Open-Label Rescue Arms overall and per dbBaseline subgroup.
!To assess the rate of anti-adalimumab antibodies (AAA) positive  subjects in the taper and 
withdrawal arms.
The study also has the following exploratory objectives:
!In the subgroup of subjects with a Baseline Ultrasound (US) assessment: 
oTo investigate the association between Baseline ultrasound scor es and the occurrence of 
flares. 
oTo investigate the association between the Baseline ultrasound scores and Baseline MRI
RAMRIS scores.
oTo describe the change in the ultrasound scores from Baseline to the time of the occurrence 
of a flare in the taper and withdrawal arms.
!To investigate the association between biomarker values at dbBa seline (and their change over 
time) and the occurrence of flares.

Investigators :  Investigator information is on file at AbbVie.
Study Sites: Approximately 72 sites in North America, Europe and Australia
Study Population:
Subjects age ≥ 18 years diagnosed with RA, on a stable dose of adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously (sc) 
eow (for ≥ 12 months prior to Week 0 Visit) in combination with methotrexate (MTX) (at stable dose for 
≥ 12 weeks prior to Week 0 Visit) or if not on MTX, another all owed conventional synthetic 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) at stable dos e or no csDMARDs for ≥ 12 weeks 
prior to Week 0 Visit) and in documented clinical remission, de fined as DAS28 erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (ESR) < 2.6 or DAS28 c-reactive protein (CRP ) < 2.6, for ≥ 6 months prior to the 
Screening Visit and DAS28 (ESR) < 2.6 at the Screening Visit.  Patients who are not treated with 
concomitant stable dose of MTX are limited to a maximum of 20% of the study population.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 200  
Methodology:
This is a Phase 4, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, paral lel-group study in subjects with RA who 
are in stable clinical remission defined as DAS28 (ESR) or DAS28 (CRP) < 2.6 for at least 6 months 
prior to the Screening Visit.  Though the cut-off for clinical remission of DAS28 (CRP) may not be 
equivalent to the DAS (ESR), in clinical practice both are frequently used to define remission as < 2.6.  Both ESR or CRP and 4 or 3 (when Patient Global Assessment [PGA] is not available) variables DAS28 will be allowed for the purposes of identifying subjects for Sc reening; however, throughout the study 
clinical remission will be defined by the more stringent 4 variables DAS28 (ESR) < 2.6 criteria.  At Screening, only subjects with confirmed 4 variables DAS28 (ESR) < 2.6 will be considered for inclusion 
in the study.
The study activities will start with a Screening Period of up to 28 days to confirm inclusion/exclusion 
criteria including a DAS28 (ESR) assessment of < 2.6.
Subjects who have signed the Informed Consent and who fulfill a ll Screening criteria will enter the 
study.  The study starts with a 4-week Lead-In Open-Label (OL) Period during which stable DAS28 
(ESR) clinical remission in 2 assessments 4 weeks apart will be  confirmed.  Subjects will receive 
adalimumab 40 mg sc eow starting at the Week 0 Visit of the Lea d-In Period; this will be approximately 
2 weeks after their last commercial Humira
®.  If needed for study procedures completion or injection 
scheduling adjustment, the lead-in period can be extended for u p to 2 more weeks in which case the 
Week 4 Visit study procedures will occur up to 6 weeks after the Week 0 Visit.
At Week 4, the end of the Lead-In Period, subjects will have a dbBaseline visit.  Subjects must have a 
confirmed DAS28 (ESR) remission at two time points in order to be randomized:
1. DAS28 (ESR) < 2.6 at the Lead-In Period Week 0
2. DAS28 (ESR) < 2.6 at the dbBaseline visit Week 4
Subjects who meet the remission criteria will be randomized (5: 1) to one of two double-blind arms and 
followed for additional 36 weeks in the Double-Blind Period: 
1. A reduced frequency of adalimumab 40 mg sc every 3 weeks (q3w ks):  taper arm, or
2. Adalimumab placebo sc q3wks:  withdrawal arm.

11
Methodology (Continued):
All subjects who are taking concomitant MTX (any dose oral, sub cutaneous [sc] or intramuscular [im]) 
and/or other csDMARDs at a stable dose for at least 12 weeks prior to Week 0 Visit will maintain the 
regimen throughout the Lead-In and Double-Blind Periods of study.  Subjects who have not been taking any csDMARDs for at least 12 weeks prior to the Week 0 Visit, w ill also maintain this regimen 
throughout the Lead-In and Double-Blind Periods of study.
Any other allowed RA concomitant medications should also be kep t stable throughout the Lead-In and 
Double-Blind Periods of the study; these medications and MTX will be received by local prescriptions. 
During the Double-Blind Period, subjects will be evaluated ever y 6 weeks for efficacy, including 
detection of flares, PROs, safety and laboratory assessments at scheduled visits on:  Weeks 4, 10, 16, 22, 
28, 34 and 40 (Final visit).
Other unscheduled visits will occur in the suspected event of a flare.  During the interval between 
scheduled visits, subjects will be asked to contact their physi cians in case of feeling their disease is 
worsening:  an unscheduled visit will be performed within 2 weeks of contact with the site to assess if subjects are experiencing a flare.
Subjects with a confirmed flare (defined as an increase from dbBaseline in DAS28 [ESR] of > 0.6 AND 
a DAS28 [ESR] > 2.6, OR an increase in DAS28 (ESR) of ≥ 1.2 irrespective of the resulting DAS28 [ESR]) at any time point (at a scheduled or unscheduled visit) will undergo Flare Week 0 visit 
procedures and will be immediately switched to an Open-label re scue arm initiating adalimumab 40 mg 
eow rescue therapy.
In the Open-Label Rescue Arm, subjects will be further evaluate d at Flare Weeks 4, 10 and 16 for 
efficacy, PROs, safety and laboratory assessments.During this period, further treatment escalation/change will be  allowed based on the Investigator's 
medical judgment.  Any treatments escalation/change will be documented.  At Flare Week 0, all subjects 
will be requested to initiate weekly at home self-assessment of  their RA disease activity by using 
Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data (RAPID)-3 questionnaires until Week 16.

Methodology (Continued):
A high-field contrast MRI of the most affected hand (2ndto 5thMCP) and wrist will be performed on all 
subjects during the Lead-In Period (prior to the dbBaseline vis it) and at Final/Early Termination Visit.  If 
both sides are considered equally affected, the MRI of the dominant hand (2ndto 5thMCP) and wrist will 
be performed.  The acquired MRI images will be centrally read and Investigator s will be blinded to the results.  Subjects 
should be randomized only when the MRI has been confirmed to be received and complete by Central 
Imaging.
In sites that meet pre-specified ultrasound requirements and wh o wish to participate in the ultrasound 
portion of the study, subjects will undergo US assessment using Gray Scale Ultrasonography (GSUS) 
and Power Doppler Ultrasonography (PDUS) consisting of a system atic longitudinal and transverse 
multiplanar examination of 46 joints and 18 tendon/tendon compa rtment during Lead-In or at dbBaseline 
Visit prior to randomization and at the Flare Week 0 Visit (if applicable).  US will be performed and 
assessed by local Ultrasonographer independent of the clinical assessor who will be blinded to the US scores.
Pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity will be assessed based  on serum adalimumab trough 
concentrations and serum anti-adalimumab antibodies (AAA), resp ectively.  Blood samples for 
adalimumab concentrations and measurements of AAA will be taken  prior to dosing at dbBaseline 
(Week 4), at Weeks 10, 16, 28, 40 and at Early Termination, Flare Weeks 0, 4 and 16 (if applicable).A panel of inflammatory biomarkers:  matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3), Collagen neo-epitope 
(C1M), Type III collagen neo-epitope (C3M), Matrix metalloprote inase-mediated c-reactive protein 
(CRPM), Matrix metalloproteinase-degraded citrullinated vimentin (VICM), Serum amyloid-associated 
protein (SAA), Interleucin -6 (IL-6), Chemokine (C-X-C motif) li gand 10 CXCL10 and CXCL13 will be 
assessed at dbBaseline (Week 4), Weeks 10, 16, 28, 40 or at Early Termination, Flare Weeks 0, 4 and 
16 (if applicable) on blood samples taken prior to dosing.  At t he time of analysis, other potential 
biomarkers identified as adding value to predict flare in this patient population may be included.
Additional optional samples for future biomarker research will be collected.

Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
Safety:
Screening assessments will include medical history, vital signs, physical examination, and clinical and 
laboratory tests.  The following safety evaluations will be performed during the study:  concomitant medication review, adverse event (AE) monitoring, vital signs, physical examination (if required) and 
laboratory tests.
Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
Analysis for Primary Objective:
The association between the occurrence of flares and Baseline M RI RAMRIS scores will be examined 
using logistic regression, which is deemed as the main analysis to address the primary objective.  
Additional analyses will be performed to assess this associatio n using various statistical methods.  
Specifically, descriptive statistics of Baseline MRI RAMRIS sco res will be provided for the two groups 
of subjects who flare and who do not flare, and the between-gro up difference in the mean scores will be 
computed together with a 90% confidence interval (CI).  Linear regression will be used to model the relationship between the DAS28 (ESR) at flaring (or at end of s tudy for subjects who do not flare) and 
the Baseline MRI RAMRIS scores.  Receiver operating characteris tic (ROC) curve approach will also be 
utilized to investigate the potential flare prediction criteria  based on MRI RAMRIS scores.  All model 
based analyses may adjust for dbBaseline clinical patient characteristics including disease duration, 
previous and concomitant treatment, etc. when appropriate.
Similar analysis will be conducted for RAMRIS synovitis scores, BME scores and the composite of 
both.
Analysis for Secondary Objectives:
Within the analyses to address the secondary objectives the ass ociation between dbBaseline disease 
characteristics and the occurrence of flares will be examined using similar analyses as for the primary 
objective.  In addition, characterization of flares, response to rescue therapy in subjects experiencing a flare and the clinical and patient reported efficacy outcomes f or all trial subjects will be analyzed 
accordingly.
Pharmacokinetic:
Adalimumab trough serum concentrations will be summarized by treatment arm at each time point using 
descriptive statistics.  The association between dbBaseline ada limumab trough concentrations and the 
occurrence of flares will be assessed.  In addition, pharmacokinetic model-based analyses may be performed with the focus on apparent clearance (CL/F) and appar ent volume of distribution (V/F) of 
adalimumab.
Immunogenicity :
AAA will be evaluated for each subject and each study arm, and rates of AAA positive subjects will be 
calculated.  As appropriate, the effect of AAA on adalimumab pharmacokinetics, efficacy variable(s), 
and treatment emergent adverse events may be evaluated.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Safety:
Frequency tables and lists of subjects with treatment-emergent AEs by preferred term as in the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 17.0 dictionary, by system organ class and by causality to the study medication as assessed by the Investigator will be provided.  Laboratory test values will be 
summarized over time.
Determination of Sample Size:
The planned total number of subjects enrolled into the Lead-In P eriod is approximately 200.
To estimate the odds ratio for the occurrence of flare with baseline MRI score based on historical MRI 
data, an effective sample size of 150 subjects in the dose tape ring group will ensure a precision for the 
estimation with the width of 90% CI no more than 0.03 for an odds ratio 1.03, no more than 0.07 for an odds ratio 1.1, and no more than 0.14 for an odds ratio 1.2.  Such sample size will also ensure a precision for the estimation of a correlation coefficient ρ with the width of 90% CI of ρ no more than 0.26 for a mild correlation coefficient 0.28, no more than 0.18 for a moderate correlation coefficient 0.55, and no more than 0.13 for a higher correlation with ρ = 0.67.  Assumin g a 30% flare rate, this sample size will 
provide the precision that the 2-sided 90% CI of the flare rate  has a half width no more than 6%.
Under a 5:1 randomization ratio (dose tapering vs. withdrawal),  a total of 180 subjects will be 
randomized.  Accounting for a 10% discontinuation rate during t he Lead-In Period, approximately 
200 subjects will need to be enrolled into the Lead-In Period.

3.0 Introduction
3.1 Disease Overview
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder with an estimated prevalence of 
approximately 1% in the population.1  The economic burden of RA is significant, 
resulting from both direct and indirect costs for the patient, including lost work income.2,3  
Over the last 15 years, the effectiveness of TNFi (tumor necros is factor inhibitor) 
therapies in RA has been widely proven and the use of these age nts both in early and 
established RA and for short and long-term treatment periods up to 10 years has been shown to improve disease course and halt structural progression.
4-9
3.2 Adalimumab Overview
Adalimumab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin (IgG1) monoclonal antibody containing only human peptide sequences.  Adalimumab is produce d by recombinant 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology in a mammalian cell expression system.  It consists of 1,330 amino acids and has a molecular weight of appr oximately 
148 kilodaltons.  Adalimumab is composed of fully human heavy an d light chain variable 
regions, which confer specificity to human TNF, and human IgG1 heavy chain and kappa 
light chain sequences.  Adalimumab binds with high affinity and specificity to soluble 
TNF-α but not to lymphotoxin-α.
TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and 
immune responses.  Elevated levels of TNF play an important role in pathologic inflammation.  Adalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutral izes the biological 
function of TNF by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.  Adalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF.  After treatment with adalimumab, levels of acute phase  reactants of 
inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sediment ation rate [ESR]) and 
serum cytokines rapidly decrease.
Adalimumab

27
Adalimumab was first approved in the United States and European Union (EU) for the 
treatment of RA in 2002 and 2003, respectively.  Additional ind ications have been 
approved in the United States and EU including psoriasis, psori atic arthritis, ankylosing 
spondylitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and juvenile i diopathic arthritis.  Additional 
updates regarding approved indications can be found in the current edition of the Investigator Brochure.
3.3 Rationale for the Study
The treat to target recommendations advocate that the primary g oal of treating subjects 
with RA is to maximize long-term Health Related Quality of Life  (HRQoL) through 
control of symptoms, prevention of structural damage, normaliza tion of function and 
social participation.
1  Abrogation of inflammation is the most important way to achieve 
these goals.  The aimed targets have been defined as clinical remission or low disease 
activity (LDA), depending on disease duration and accumulated d amage.  The widespread 
use of (biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs) bDMARDs, mainly TNFi, helps patients to achieve these goals and thus have become an integral part of the standard of care of RA.
10,11
For patients treated with bDMARDs who achieve clinical remission, a question at the center of several recent clinical trials has been whether biologics need to be maintained at a stable dose or can be withdrawn or tapered.  Even with an inc reasing introduction of 
these treatment regimens in routine clinical practice, the evidence supporting their effectiveness is equivocal.  Furthermore, patient outcomes in early RA treated with initial combination of methotrexate (MTX) and aTNFi versus in established RA have been very different.
12,13
In early RA patients, controlled withdrawal studies have result ed in somehow different 
outcomes for different TNFi compounds:  whilst the OPTIMA14trial showed that the 
majority of early RA MTX-naïve patients in stable LDA were able  to maintain disease 
control for 52 weeks after discontinuing adalimumab, in the PRIZE study,15on the other

28
hand, withdrawing etanercept was associated with a higher numbe r of patients losing their 
status of clinical remission.
In established RA, withdrawing TNFi or other bDMARDs has been a ssociated with 
relapses or RA flares in a higher proportion of patients then i n early RA.13  Data from 
both open-label uncontrolled studies16-19and few controlled trials20-23has indicated that in 
patients treated with bDMARDs after incomplete response to csDM ARDs, 
discontinuation of  the biologic therapy without triggering los s of disease control can only 
be achieved in some of them.Research has also been conducted investigating the outcomes of TNFi dose tapering (dose 
reduction or increased interval of drug administration) treatment strategies in RA patients 
achieving the target of LDA or remission.  Studies have shown that a certain proportion of patients can maintain remission following a tapering strategy f or 48 weeks,
2054 weeks21
and up to 18 months.24  However, the data show also that a considerable proportion of 
these patients experienced an RA flare or loss disease control following dose reduction.
Thus, despite the existing evidence on dose reduction in RA, several questions that are critical if considering the implementation of this practice in clinical practice remain unanswered:
25  Who are the patients who can maintain clinical control upon t apering?  
Which patient and or disease characteristics are predictive for the risk of flare versus the maintenance of response following a tapering regimen?  Is it fe asible to devise a patient 
selection strategy or algorithm to inform dose tapering in dail y clinical care?  Is 
re-institution of normal dose/dosing regimen of TNFi in case of  flares effectively 
providing patients the same level of disease control they had b efore?
The overarching aim of the study we propose here is to attempt to provide answers to all 
these questions.  The objectives of the study aim to study the association of patient 
characteristics, with a particular focus on residual inflammation, with the development of flares following a prevailing dose tapering strategy.

3.3.1 Additional Considerations on Key Study Parameters
Rheumatoid Arthritis Flares
The occurrence of flares, their detection, as well as their characterization has been subject 
of numerous studies.  Several flare definitions have been proposed and have been submitted to validation analyses in the context of RA clinical trials.
22,24,26  An increase in 
DAS28(ESR) higher then 1,2 has been accepted as being clinical meaningfully 
representing a true worsening of the disease;27However, this definition of flare is often 
not capturing  patients with  meaningful disease activity.28  A European Expert Consensus 
panel defined, for patients previously in clinical remission, a flare when an increase in DAS28 (ESR) of > 0.6 AND a DAS28 (ESR) > 2.6 occurs.  Thus, in order to capture meaningful worsening of RA over time flare will be defined as an increase from 
dbBaseline in DAS28 (ESR) of > 0.6 AND a DAS28 (ESR) > 2.6 or an increase in DAS28 (ESR) of ≥ 1.2 irrespective of DAS28 (ESR).
Clinical Remission Defined by DAS28 < 2.6
DAS28 (CRP) has been validated in comparison with DAS28 (ESR) a nd data indicated 
that both measures are useful for assessing disease activity in  patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis.29  Accordingly, both scores can and have been included as an out come variable 
in clinical trials, and have been used in clinical practice to define disease activity 
e.g., clinical remission (< 2.6).  Despite the fact that both sc ores are reflecting accurately 
disease activity, the cut-off points for disease activity index es, including clinical 
remission, might be slightly different for DAS28 (CRP):  the pe rcentage of patients 
meeting the definition of remission (< 2.6) might be slightly h igher for DAS28-CRP than 
DAS28-ESR.30,31
In clinical practice it's relatively frequent to use the also validated 3 variables DAS2832or 
instead of the most widely used DAS28 4 variables due to difficulties on getting documented patient global assessment (PGA) in a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).  Moreover, a recent study has shown that despite the existence o f individual patient 
baseline differences prior to treatment with TNFi, after 12 wee ks of TNFi and particularly 
Adalimumab
M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26
30
for the lower range the 3 and 4 variables DAS28 (CRP).scores were similarly sensitive to 
change, highly correlated and the mean inter-score difference w as very small .33  
Accordingly, for the purpose of identifying subjects on stable clinical remission for ≥ 6 months for Screening, both DAS28 (ESR) and (CRP) 4 or 3 (when PGA is not available) variables documented as being lower than 2.6 for at least 6 months prior to 
screening will be accepted.  However, at Screening, only subjec ts with 4 variables DAS28 
(ESR) < 2.6 may be enrolled and throughout the study clinical remission is defined by the 4 variables DAS28 (ESR) < 2.6.  Flare will be assessed based on  DAS28 (ESR) 
evaluation at any time point throughout the study (with ESR mea sured in the same visit).
Concomitant Treatments for RA
The 2013 EULAR recommendations update propose that in RA patients who are in stable clinical remission particularly if also treated with concomitant  csDMARDs(s) tapering a 
bDMARD is an option; the updated 2015 ACR guidelines also consider tapering RA treatments as an option for such a patient population.  Both treatment recommendations acknowledge that more data on tapering is needed as part of a r esearch agenda.
It is the aim of this study to assess, in subjects treated in real life clinical practice conditions who have DAS28 < 2.6, if imaging-detected sub-clinic al inflammation (and 
disease, patient and treatment patterns as well as adalimumab dr ug level characteristics) 
brings an additional benefit in predicting and informing clinic ians about who has a higher 
risk of flare while treated with a reduced dose of adalimumab.
As this study goal is to include patients as treated in routine  clinical practice, the patient 
population must be in line with both treatment recommendations and clinical practice.  
Accumulated data from registries and other real world evidence,  such as CORRONA,
34
US healthcare insurance claims database, 35BSRBR,36RABBIT,37Nor-DMARD38and 
ARTIS39are showing that around 30% – 34% of patients being treated with bDMARDs 
including TNFi are on monotherapy even if at initiation of the bDMARD the vast majority of patients were on combination therapy.
40  As such this study will include 
mainly patients who are in stable remission for more than 6 mon ths as assessed by DAS28 
Adalimumab
M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26
31
< 2.6 and after at least 1 year of treatment with adalimumab with concomitant MTX for at 
least the last 12 weeks prior to inclusion; in order to be in l ine with the current clinical 
practice up to 20% of the study patient population may be compo sed of subjects who are 
not treated with concomitant stable MTX but instead are treated  with other than MTX 
allowed csDMARDs or not treated with a csDMARD as long as this treatment regimen is 
stable for at least 12 weeks prior to Week 0.
Assessment of Residual Disease Activity Using Imaging Techniques
The use of sensitive imaging techniques, i.e., musculoskeletal ultrasonography (US) and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows for the identification o f residual inflammation, 
which has been correlated with structural damage progression an d upcoming RA flares in 
patients in clinical remission.
US is an imaging technology increasingly used in rheumatologists' clinical practice.  
Among approximately 50% of subjects on TNFi with established cl inical remission, 
ultrasound assessments have been able to detect remaining signa ls of synovitis in Power 
Doppler ultrasonagraphy (PDUS).32  These PDUS signals have been shown to be 
associated with a risk for progression and/or relapse/flare in several clinical trials.32-46
Despite its high use and validity in local clinical settings, t he use of US has been limited 
in large clinical trial settings due to inter-operator and inte r-observer variability, and the 
significant dependence on the expertise on the ultrasound asses sor.46,47
MRI is a highly sensitive and standardized imaging technique suitable for clinical trials:  Using MRI in RA has been shown to identify erosions otherwise n ot observed with 
conventional x-ray.
48  Similarly like US, MRI assessments have shown signs of 
inflammation by synovitis and bone marrow edema (BME) in a high  proportion of 
patients considered in clinical remission.49  It was further demonstrated that MRI signals 
of inflammation as detected by the Rheumatoid arthritis MRI sco ring system (RAMRIS)50
validated scores are correlated with structural progression as measured by conventional 
x-ray and are suggested to indicate remaining disease activity.49,51,52
Adalimumab
M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26
32
Current European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations on the value 
of imaging for diagnosis and monitoring RA patients recognize t he value of MRI as well 
as US on the diagnosis and monitoring of RA (besides conventional x-ray).53  
Nevertheless, MRI is not used in daily clinical practice to mon itor RA and will not replace 
the clinical value for disease activity assessment and practica lity of US nor the value of 
conventional x-ray for assessment of disease damage and structural progression.  However, its high sensitivity and reproducibility as well as lo w inter-observer 
variability,
50make it ideal for imaging detection of inflammation in a clinic al trial 
setting.48  In addition, in RA patients who are in stable clinical remission and 
subsequently taper or withdraw a bDMARD, MRI may detect potenti al bone and cartilage 
deterioration. 
It is the primary objective of this study is to investigate the  association between residual 
disease activity at Baseline as detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the 
occurrence of flares in RA subjects submitted to an adalimumab dose tapering regimen 
controlled by adalimumab withdrawal.
Clinical Patient Characteristics
Several additional patient characteristics, some well proven as prognostic factors of more 
severe RA, have also been investigated in their potential assoc iation with the outcome of a 
tapering or withdrawal of TNFi treatment strategy; not limited but including the following 
parameters have, even if not consistently, been suggested to be  potentially associated with 
loss of disease control upon a tapering strategy:11-13,17,21,25,54
● Disease duration
● Rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or Anti-citrullinated peptide antib ody (ACPA) 
positivity 
● Erosive disease● Smoking
● Initial disease activity● Previous treatment with csDMARDs or bDMARDs
Adalimumab
M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26
33
● Concomitant use of corticosteroids
● Duration of treatment and remission with the bDMARD
● CRP● Health Assessment Questionnaire – Disability Index (HAQ-DI)
Patient clinical characteristics and their association with the occurrence of flares upon 
tapering of adalimumab controlled by its withdrawal will be ass essed.
Drug Monitoring
A drug-related hypothesis relates to individual differences in serum drug concentrations:  
patients with higher trough concentrations would be more likely  to remain in remission 
following a dose tapering regimen than patients with lower trou gh concentrations.55,56
This concept has not been validated.  On the contrary, it has b een shown that there is a 
high range of individual variability in both clinical response and adalimumab trough 
concentrations57thus precluding recommendations for concentration-guided therap y 
(therapeutic drug monitoring).
Adalimumab trough concentrations at baseline and at several time points and their 
potential predictive value for flares will be investigated duri ng this study.
Biomarkers
The potential predictive value of certain biomarkers for progre ssive destructive RA and 
their potential role in monitoring treatment response has been frequently investigated.58-60  
So far, a biomarker or set of biomarkers which would predict RA  clinical course or 
disease progression has not yet been identified.  Recent findin gs suggest it may be 
possible to find surrogate serum biomarkers of active synovitis that could be useful in the follow-up of patients with RA in remission in order to identify  risk of increase of disease 
activity.

34
Identification of biomarkers which may be of interest to unders tand the contributing 
factors for successful tapering are therefore part of the explo ratory assessments of the 
study.
3.4 Safety Information
Adalimumab therapy has a well-established and well described safety profile based on 
extensive post marketing experience and continued clinical trial patient exposure since the first approved indication in 2002 for rheumatoid arthritis.  A detailed discussion of the 
pre-clinical toxicology, metabolism, pharmacology and safety ex perience with 
adalimumab can be found in the current Investigator's Brochure.  AbbVie is committed to continue to collect safety information including those events t hat may occur in this trial in 
order to confirm this established safety profile and to identify any unknown potential adverse reactions, rare events and those events with a long lat ency.  AbbVie is 
participating in an United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-requested, TNF
inhibitor class wide exploration of the rare appearance of mali gnancy in subjects who are 
30 years of age or younger at the time of diagnosis.  The risk of malignancy in this age 
group has not been established and is difficult to study due to  its rarity. AbbVie 
appreciates your attention to the additional reporting requirem ents needed in this unlikely 
event, outlined in Section 6.1.5 under Adverse Event Reporting.
3.5 Differences Statement
This Phase 4 study is the first randomized, placebo-controlled,  double-blind study, to 
evaluate the association between residual inflammation detected  by MRI at Baseline and 
RA flares or maintenance of clinical remission outcome of a bDM ARD dose tapering.  
The dbBaseline demographics and clinical patient characteristics, adalimumab drug 
levels, US detected joint inflammation and RA biomarkers and their association with the 36-week outcomes of adalimumab tapering will also be assessed.  Open-label adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow) rescue treatment for subjects experiencing a flare will be investigated.

3.6 Benefits and Risks
This study is being conducted in subjects previously treated wi th adalimumab for at least 
12 months and who achieved stable clinical remission for at lea st 6 months.  Thus, 
subjects enrolled have already been exposed to adalimumab.
The safety profile of adalimumab in RA and other approved indic ations is well 
established.  Adverse events in the categories of autoimmunity,  demyelinating disorders, 
congestive heart failure, gastrointestinal disorders, hematolog ic events, hepatic events, 
hypersensitivity, immunosuppression, infections, malignancies, respiratory thoracic 
disorders, and vascular disorders have been observed with adalimumab therapy.The treatment interventions in this study, dose tapering and wi thdrawal, are treatment 
algorithms used in clinical practice:
11,24,26,65-68  In this study, subjects will be randomized 
(5:1) to a reduced dose of adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneous (sc) every 3 weeks (q3wks) 
(taper arm) or matching placebo (withdrawal arm).  Subjects wil l maintain a stable dose of 
MTX (any dose; oral, sc or im) and/or of any other additional c oncomitant RA medication 
as taken before enrollment into the study.
Subjects experiencing a flare at any time point will be switche d to an Open-Label Rescue 
Arm and immediately provided adalimumab 40 mg eow for at least 16 weeks. AbbVie expects the results from this study to provide treating health care professionals 
(HCPs) with additional evidence potentially useful in character izing the profiles of 
patients that might be considered for a tapering strategy and t o identify those that might be 
at risk of flaring if submitted to a dose or interval modification.
4.0 Study Objectives
The primary objective is to investigate the association between residual disease acti vity

5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a Phase 4, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, paral lel-group study.  The study 
duration will include a Screening period of up to 28 days, a 4- week Lead-In Period with 
open-label 40 mg adalimumab eow and a 36-week Double-Blind Peri od with 40 mg 
adalimumab/placebo q3wks; subjects who experience a flare at an y time will enter a 
Rescue Arm and will be followed for 16 weeks.
The study design schematic is presented in Figure 1 .

Screening Period (up to 28 days):
At the Screening Visit, prior to the Lead-In Period, subjects w ill receive a full explanation 
of the study design and study procedures, provide a written inf ormed consent, and 
undergo the Screening procedures outlined in Table 1 .  The Screening period may be 
exceptionally extended beyond 28 days upon justification and fu rther consultation with 
Study Designated Physician.  The target population for the stud y consists of RA subjects 
on adalimumab treatment for at least 12 months and in stable clinical remission, as 
defined by a 4 or 3 (whenever PGA is not available) variables DAS28 (CRP) or DAS28 (ESR) < 2.6 for at least 6 months prior to the Screening Visit,  in combination with MTX 
(at a stable dose for ≥ 12 weeks prior to Week 0 Visit) or if n ot on MTX, in other allowed 
csDMARDs at a stable dose or not treated with a csDMARD for ≥ 12 weeks prior to Week 0 Visit.  Subjects with a documented DAS28 (CRP) or (ESR) < 2.6 (or availability of the 4 or at least 3 components that allow for calculation of a DAS28 score) at least 6 months prior to Screening Visit may be screened.  However, for  enrollment and 
throughout the study clinical remission will be defined by 4 variables DAS28 (ESR) < 2.6 criteria.
All screened subjects satisfying all the inclusion (including a DAS28 [ESR] assessment of 
< 2.6 evaluated at Screening) and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study.  Confirmation of a DAS28 (ESR) < 2.6 assessed at the Scr eening and at the Week 0 
Visit is required prior to subject inclusion into the Lead-In P eriod.
Subjects that initially screen fail for the study may be permit ted to re-screen following 
re-consent.  All Screening procedures with the possible excepti ons noted below will be 
repeated.  The subject must meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria at the time of re-screening in order to qualify for the study.  There is no minimum period of time a subject must wait to re-screen for the study.  If the subject  had a complete initial 
Screening evaluation including the assessment of a purified protein derivative (PPD) test (or equivalent), or Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA; QuantiFERON-Tuberculosis [TB] Gold In-Tube test or T-SPOT TB test), chest x-ray and ECG, these tests will not be required to be repeated for re-screening provided the conditions noted in Section 5.3.1.1

are met and no more than 12 months have passed.  As appropriate, sites are encouraged to 
contact the AbbVie Study Designated Physician to confirm if subjects should or should not be re-screened.  If the re-screening visit is occurring within 4 weeks of last screening some other procedures may not be required upon discussion and a greement with Study 
Designated Physician.
Lead-In Period (4 Weeks):
Subjects who fulfill all Screening criteria will enter the stud y with a 4-week Lead-In OL 
Period:  subjects will receive adalimumab 40 mg sc eow starting  at Week 0 of the Lead-In 
Period.  Week 0 will occur 2 weeks after the subject's last dose of commercial Humira®
(± 2 days) to keep in line with eow dosing.  At the Week 0 visit  subjects will undergo the 
corresponding procedures as outlined in Table 1 including DAS28 (ESR) assessment to 
confirm remission using the ESR result from the same day of the  visit.  If the subject 
enrollment is confirmed at the Week 0 visit, the subject will stop commercial Humira®
and initiate adalimumab investigational product open-label sc.  The first sc injection will 
be administered at the site at the end of the visit; the second  injection will be given 
14 days thereafter (± 3 days) and every other week (± 3 days) until Week 4 dbBaseline 
Visit.  If needed the subject may be assisted by the study team  for the self-injection of the 
syringe.  Subjects must undergo a high-field contrast MRI scan of the most affected hand (2
ndto 5thMCP) and wrist during the Lead-In Period.  If both sides are co nsidered equally 
affected the MRI of the dominant hand (2ndto 5thMCP) and wrist will be performed.
MRI images will be read centrally.  Further details regarding MRI requirements, procedures and central reading will be provided in an MRI manua l.  The assessors will be 
blinded to the clinical assessments and the clinical Investigator will be blinded to the MRI assessments performed centrally.  A local report for safety rea sons on urgent and RA 
inflammation related findings other than RA may be viewed by th e investigator.  The 
dbBaseline Visit and randomization are not dependent on the results or report of the central reader.  Subjects should be randomized only when the MRI has been confirmed to be received and complete by Central Imaging.
Adalimumab
M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26
41
Sites will be asked at study-start if they want to participate and if they qualify for the 
optional US assessment, according to requirement described in Appendix N and in the US 
manual.  Sites that participate in US assessments will need to nominate a qualified 
Ultrasonographer to perform and locally assess the US during the Lead-In period or at the dbBaseline Visit; there will not be a central reading of the US images.  The Ultrasonographer will be blinded to the clinical assessments an d the clinical Investigator 
will be blinded to the ultrasound assessments. 
If needed for procedural compliance (e.g., to allow MRI and its certification, for injection 
scheduling adjustment), the lead-in period can be extended up t o 2 more weeks  in which 
case the DAS28 (ESR) assessment and all the dbBaseline Week 4 Visit study procedures will occur up to 6 weeks after the Week 0 Visit.  These cases o r other exceptions related 
with further extension of the Lead-in period should be discusse d with the Study 
Designated Physician.
Double-Blind Period:
A confirmed adequate MRI from the Lead-In Period is required be fore the dbBaseline 
visit.  At the end of the Lead -In Period, subjects will be assessed again for DAS28 (ESR) 
at the dbBaseline Week 4 visit.  At the Week 4 visit, if the subject does not meet the 
DAS28 (ESR) of < 2.6 or if the subject is unable to obtain conf irmed and certified MRI 
scan images, the subject would need to be discontinued from the  study at an Early 
Termination visit.
Subjects with a confirmed DAS28 (ESR) of < 2.6 at the dbBaseline visit, and as such 
fulfilling confirmed DAS28 (ESR) remission at 2 time points:  Da y 1 of Lead-In and 
4 weeks later (or, exceptionally later) at the dbBaseline visit,  will be randomized in a 
5:1 ratio to one of two double-blind arms and followed for an additional 36 weeks:
1. a reduced frequency of adalimumab 40 mg sc to every 3 weeks ( q3wks) (taper 
arm), or
2. adalimumab placebo sc q3wks:  withdrawal arm.
Adalimumab
M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26
42
The randomized Double-Blind period will begin at the dbBaseline  Visit (Week 4) and will 
continue with visits every 6 weeks until the Week 40 Visit.  Th e Week 40 visit will be 
considered the Final Visit.
At each scheduled visit during the double-blind period subjects  will undergo the 
corresponding procedures as outlined in Table 1 .  The initial assessments at each of these 
visits must include ESR assessment except if the blood puncture for this procedure is very 
painful (in which case subjects should first fulfill the patient questionnaires); if the calculated DAS score meets flare criteria described below, the visit then becomes a Flare Week 0 Visit; and the stipulated procedures are completed.
Visits, including the dbBaseline Visit should aim to be scheduled in line with the injection 
date (± 3 days); in this case, subjects should be reminded not to take their scheduled 
injection prior to coming for the visit.  The injections scheduled at the visits should occur at the site at the end of the visit.
During the interval between scheduled visits, subjects will be asked to contact their 
physicians in case they feel their disease is worsening:  an un scheduled visit will be 
performed within 2 weeks of contact with the site to assess if subjects are experiencing a flare.
For any subject missing 2 consecutive visits within the Double- Blind Period, the site must 
contact the AbbVie Study Designated Physician regarding the sub ject's continued 
participation in the study.No study drug will be administered or injected at the Final Visit.
Flare at Scheduled Visit:
If during a scheduled visit a flare (defined by DAS28 [ESR] > 2 .6 AND an increase from 
dbBaseline in DAS28 [ESR] > 0.6 or increase of DAS28 [ESR] ≥ 1.2 from dbBaseline 
DAS28 [ESR] score irrespective of DAS28 [ESR]) is confirmed, th e regular visit will 
then turn into a Flare Week 0 Visit.
Adalimumab
M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26
43
At the Flare Week 0 Visit, subjects will undergo further study procedures as described in 
Table 1 under Scheduled/Unscheduled Flare Week 0 Visit and will be switched to 
Open-Label Rescue Arm starting with the first OL injection of adalimumab 40 mg sc at 
the end of the visit.  Subjects will be given at-home Routine A ssessment of Patient Index 
Data (RAPID)-3 questionnaires (for self-assessment of disease a ctivity) for weekly 
completion to be returned at every visit until the Flare Week 16 Visit.
Unscheduled Visit:
Subjects should be instructed (at every office visit) to contac t the site if they feel their 
disease is worsening and will receive those instructions in the patient card.  If a subject 
contacts the site due to possible worsening of RA, an unscheduled visit to confirm his/her clinical status within 2 weeks of contact with the site.  Study  procedures outlined in 
Table 1 should be followed including an initial DAS28 (ESR) assessment.  If a flare is not 
confirmed, the Unscheduled Visit is concluded and the subject w ill continue the regular 
scheduling of the Double-Blind Period Visits.
If a flare is confirmed, the unscheduled visit will turn into the Flare Week 0 Visit.
Flare at Unscheduled Visit:
At the Flare Week 0 visit subjects will undergo further study procedures as described in 
Table 1 under Scheduled/Unscheduled Flare Week 0 Visit and will be swit ched to the 
Open Label Rescue Arm starting with the first adalimumab 40 mg sc OL injection at the end of the visit if last study drug injection has occurred more than 1 day ago.  If not, OL adalimumab 40 mg will be provided for at home sc injection starting the next day.  
Open-Label Rescue Arm
In the open-label Rescue Arm subjects will receive OL therapy w ith adalimumab 40 mg 
eow.  After the first OL injection, adalimumab 40 mg will be administered sc eow.  
Subjects will be given RAPID 3 questionnaires (for self-assessm ent of disease activity) 
for weekly completion to be returned at every visit until the F lare Week 16 Visit.

44
All subjects will have 16 weeks of follow-up in the Open-Label Rescue Arm.
The Flare Week 16 Visit will be the Final Visit.
During the Open-Label Rescue Arm, it is at the Investigator's d iscretion to initiate or 
change the subject's following RA concomitant medications:
● Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
● Analgesics
● Corticosteroids (a dose up to a maximum of 15 mg oral prednisolone or 
equivalent/day and/or up to 3 injections intra-articular (i.a.) within the 
follow-up period of 16 weeks)
● csDMARDs including MTX (initiation and/or dose or administration mode 
change) and excluding csDMARDs that are not allowed (e.g., azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, d-penicilamine)
Joints submitted to an i.a. injection of corticosteroids within  the last 4 weeks prior to a 
visit will be excluded from the tender and swollen joint evaluation.  Four weeks after an 
i.a. injection, joints must be again evaluated and included in the scores.
All concomitant medications should be documented in the electro nic Case Report Form 
(eCRF).  If additional RA medications are required, the Study Designated Physician must 
be contacted.
Subjects may discontinue adalimumab treatment at any time durin g study participation.  
Subjects that end study participation early will have an Early Termination Visit.

If subjects discontinue the study during the lead-in observatio nal period from Week 0 up
to Week 4, prior to randomization, a shortened Early Terminatio n visit is required for: 
returning study material and drug, assess any safety/adverse ev ents, collect reason for 
discontinuation.  A 70-day follow-up call/visit will be require d; the remainder of full 
Early Termination Visit study procedures can be completed per the investigator's 
discretion.
All subjects discontinuing the study will have a follow-up phone call approximately 
70 days after the last administration of study drug to obtain information on any new or ongoing adverse events.
5.2 Selection of Study Population
Accounting for a 10% discontinuation rate during the Lead-In Pe riod, approximately 
200 subjects will be enrolled into the Lead-In Period.  The stud y is designed to randomize 
approximately 180 subjects in the Double-Blind Period to meet p rimary objective 
evaluation without enrolling an undue number of subjects in ali gnment with ethical 
considerations.  Therefore, if the target number of subjects has been enrolled, there is a 
possibility that additional subjects in Screening will not be e nrolled.
A subject may be enrolled in this study provided that he/she ha s met all of the inclusion 
criteria specified in Section 5.2.1 , Inclusion Criteria, and none of the exclusion criteria 
specified in Section 5.2.1 , Exclusion Criteria, of this protocol.
5.2.1 Inclusion Criteria

The Investigator should contact the AbbVie study designated phy sician if there are any 
questions regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria and eligibility.
5.2.3 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Any medication or vaccine (including over-the-counter or prescription medicines, 
vitamins and/or herbal supplements) that the subject is receiving at the time of screening, and/or receives during the study, must be recorded along with t he reason for use, date(s) 
of administration including start and end dates, and dosage information including dose, route and frequency on the appropriate eCRF.
The AbbVie Study Designated Physician identified in Section 6.1.5 Adverse Event 
Reporting should be contacted if there are any questions regard ing concomitant or prior 
therapies.In addition for subjects age ≤ 30 with a reported malignancy adverse event, prior exposure 
to, or current use of, anti-neoplastics, or other drugs which h ave a risk of malignancy as 
stated in their label and other relevant dosing information to estimate total exposure will be collected in the source documents and appropriate eCRF pages.  At the time of the reported malignancy adverse event, sites will be asked if any o f the prior and concomitant 
medications contributed to the event.  Any medications used prior to the study will be captured on the appropriate eCRF.  Information on the reason for use, date(s) of administration including start and end dates, highest maintaine d dose, dosage information 
including dose, route and frequency, and reason for stopping the medication will be collected in the source documents and appropriate eCRF pages.
5.2.3.1 Prior Therapy
All prior drug therapies for RA including csDMARDs and bDMARDs s ince initial 
diagnosis, must be recorded on the source documents and on the appropriate eCRF along

at least 80% of subjects recruited; for those subjects on concomitant MTX, date of first use, dosage, maximum dosage and reason for use as well as RA disease activity score at time of first dose and all subsequent disease activity assessments (if available) should be documented and must be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  A decrease in the dose of MTX due to an event of tolerability (or other safety) related with MTX is allowed during the 12 weeks period prior to the Week 0 Visit and throughout th e study as long as well 
documented.
Subjects who are not taking MTX in a stable dose for ≥ 12 weeks prior to Week 0 can be 
enrolled (up to 20% of overall study population) as long as the ir allowed csDMARD 
treatment has been stable for at least 12 weeks prior to Week 0 or if not treated with a csDMARD this regimen is stable for at least 12 weeks prior to W eek 0 Visit.  In these 
cases, csDMARD date of first use, dosage, maximum dosage and re ason for use as well as 
RA disease activity score at time of first dose and all subsequ ent disease activity

assessments (if available) should be documented and must be recorded on the appropriate 
eCRF.  A decrease in the dose of csDMARD due to an event of tol erability or other safety 
related is allowed during the 12 weeks period prior to the Week 0 Visit and throughout the study as long as well documented.
When no csDMARDs has been used for at least 12 weeks prior to W eek 0 Visit, date and 
reasons for stopping previous csDMARDs must be recorded in the eCRF.  The allowed 
RA concomitant medications should be kept stable throughout the  Lead-In and 
Double-Blind Periods of the study.
5.2.3.2 Concomitant Therapy
Each vaccine and all medications except study drug, administere d to a subject during the 
study should be recorded in the eCRF as a concomitant medicatio n.  All concomitant 
medications will be provided by local prescription.
Methotrexate:
All subjects who were on MTX at inclusion must maintain a stable dose (any dose; oral, 
intra-muscular or sc) from the 12 weeks prior to Week 0 Visit and throughout the study in the randomized double-blind arms.  In the event of tolerability (or other safety) issues related with MTX, the doses can be decreased and/or resumed as needed during the study 
and these changes documented.
Other Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs), Corticost eroids or 
Other Medications for RA:
Allowed other concomitant csDMARDSs (chloroquine, hy droxychl oroquine, 
sulfasalazine, gold formulations [including auranofin, gold sod ium thiomalate, and 
aurothioglucose] and leflunomide) must be at a stable dose for at least 12 weeks prior to 
Week 0 Visit and at a stable dose throughout the study in the ra ndomized double-blind 
arms.  In the event of tolerability (or other safety) issues re lated with the csDMARDs, the 
doses can be decreased and/or resumed as needed during the stud y and these changes 
documented.

Concomitant use of oral corticosteroids (< 10 mg/day oral prednisone or equivalent) is 
allowed during the study and should be kept at a stable dose from 4 weeks prior to 
Week 0 Visit and throughout the study in the randomized double-b lind arms.
Concomitant use of oral NSAIDs, tramadol or other equivalent op ioids and non-opioid 
analgesics is allowed during the study and should be kept at a stable dose and/or 
therapeutic scheme from 4 weeks prior to Week 0 Visit and throughout the study in the randomized double-blind arms.  In the event of tolerability (or other safety) issues, the 
doses of NSAIDs may be skipped, decreased and/or resumed as man y times as needed 
during the study.  On the days that subjects are scheduled to be seen in clinic, no regularly scheduled NSAIDs should be used within 12 hours of the subject's  clinic visit.
Doses of all the RA treatment concomitant medications must remain stable throughout study participation (except as medically required due to an AE and in the rescue therapy arm; Section 5.3.4.1.2 ).
Folic acid supplementation during the study treatment period:  All subjects treated with 
concomitant MTX should take a dietary supplement of oral folic acid 5 mg once weekly 
or per local guidelines per the investigator's discretion throughout the treatment period.  Folate should not be administered on the day that MTX study med ication is taken, nor on 
the following day.
For subjects who require isoniazid (INH) for TB prophylaxis con sideration should be 
given to administer pyridoxine (Vitamin B
6) to prevent peripheral neuropathy.
MTX, folic acid and any other concomitant RA medications will b e received by local 
prescriptions.The AbbVie Study Designated Physician should be contacted if there are any questions 
regarding concomitant or prior therapy(ies).

Table 1. Study Activities (Continued)
a. Screening must include a documented DAS28 (ESR) assessment pr ior to the Lead-In Period.  An additional DAS28 (ESR) assessmen t must be completed at dbBaseline 
Week 4 in the Lead-In Period to confirm inclusion in the trial.
b. Before study drug administration, all inclusion and exclusion criteria should be re-confirmed based on assessments completed during the Screening period.
c. Height will be measured at Screening only.  Weight will be measured at Screening and Final/Early Termination Visit.
d. For those subjects who have entered the study at Week 0 but are early terminated before the Week 4 visit, a short Early Term ination visit is allowed.  This visit would include 
reason for discontinuation, review of adverse events, and investigational product/diary return.  This will be followed by a 70-day follow-up call/visit.  Additional assessments 
are allowed per the Investigator's discretion.
e. Subjects are given a questionnaire to take home and fill out every week after flaring to be returned to the site at each visit.
f. US Gray Scale and Power Doppler with a systematic longitudinal and transverse multiplanar examination of 46 joints and 18 te n don/tendon compartments.  US will be 
performed on all subjects at sites that participate in the US assessment.  Ultrasound can be performed in the Lead-In Period o r at the Double-Blind Baseline Visit prior to 
randomization. 
g. Not required if subject has documented assessment within 12 months of Screening and meets inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.  If there is no evidence or if there is 
doubt in the results, then they need to be assessed at Screening.  A CXR may be required for evaluation of active T B.
h. To be completed if ≥ 12 weeks after last MRI.  i. High-field adequate contrast MRI of the most affected or domi nant hand (2 – 5 metacarpophalangeal joints [MCP]) and wrist (if both sides are considered equally affected) 
must be confirmed at dbBaseline that it was received and marked  as complete by the Central Reader.
j. A repeat TB test must be performed one year after the date of  the previous test (± 2 months).  The repeat TB test can occur at any visit. 
k. All females of childbearing potential will have a serum pregn ancy test at Screening.
l. All females of childbearing potential will have a urine sampl e collected at the Week 0 visit prior to study enrollment and a t study discontinuation/completion.  The samples 
will be tested locally by designated study personnel.  Monthly pregnancy tests will be performed throughout the study if required by country regulatory authorities.  Any 
subject with a positive urine pregnancy test must have a negative serum test performed at the central laboratory prior to enro llment or continuation in the study.  Investigators 
may conduct more frequent urine pregnancy testing as necessary according to their judgment.
m. Subjects will sign a separate informed consent if they agree to participate in pharmacogenetic research.
n. PK and AAA samples are to be drawn prior to study drug inject ion.
o. Dipstick urinalysis will be completed by the central lab at all required visits.  A microscopic analysis will be performed i n the event the dipstick results show protein, ketones 
or blood greater than negative or glucose greater than normal.

5.3.1.1 Study Procedures
General Guidance for Visits
At any visit, the study procedures must always start with the E SR blood test (except for 
the Screening Visit when the Informed Consent must be obtained)  so that within the time 
frame of the visit the result will be used for the DAS28 (ESR) assessment.
Informed Consent
An Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved, 
study-specific informed consent will be reviewed, signed and da ted by the subject or their 
legally authorized representative before any study-related proc edures are undertaken, or 
before any medications are withheld from the subject in order t o participate in this study.  
Participation in further then pre-specified biomarker research analysis is optional, as 
indicated in the main consent.  A separate consent is required from each subject in order 
to participate in the optional pharmacogenetic analysis.  Details about how informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in Section  9.3.
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Subject will be eligible for study enrollment if he/she meets a ll inclusion criteria and none 
of the exclusion criteria at both the Screening and Week 0 of t he Lead-In Period.
At the dbBaseline Visit (Week 4), in order for the subject to be randomized, another 4 variables DAS28 (ESR) must be completed and fulfill the requirement of < 2.6.  The ESR from the dbBaseline Visit must be used for this assessment.  If the subject does not meet the DAS28 (ESR) requirement of < 2.6 at the dbBaseline (Week 4), the subject must be discontinued from the trial.  
Medical and Surgical History
A complete non-RA related and/or co-morbidities medical and sur gical history, as well as 
history of tobacco and alcohol use, will be obtained from each subject during the 
Screening Visit.  A list of each subject's specific RA related medical and surgical history, 
Adalimumab
M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26
66
including disease duration, prior treatments, disease activity at diagnosis (if available) and 
at initiation of adalimumab, time to and duration of remission after initiating adalimumab, time on adalimumab, should be recorded at Screening.  Additionally, if available from the last 12 months, detailed documentation referring to TB screening and/or liver transportation (LT) prophylaxis, chest x-ray, ECG and hepatitis  B screening will be 
recorded at Screening.  An updated medical history will be obta ined prior to study drug 
administration at Day 1 of Lead-In and updated as necessary thr oughout the study on the 
eCRF.
A detailed medical history with respect to TB exposure needs to be documented.  This 
information needs to include Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vac cination, cohabitation 
with individuals who have had TB, and/or who reside or work in TB endemic locations.
Physical Examination
A complete physical exam will be performed at the designated st udy visits in Table 1 .  
Physical examination findings that are related or part of each subject's medical history should be captured on the appropriate eCRF page.  The physical exam at the dbBaseline Visit will serve as the dbBaseline exam for the entire study.
A symptom-directed physical examination can be performed at any  other visits if, in the 
opinion of the Investigator, it is warranted by the subject's A E status or on review of 
symptoms.  Any clinically significant physical examination find ings after dosing should 
be recorded as adverse events.
Vital Signs/Weight/Height
Vital sign determinations of sitting blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and body 
temperature will be obtained at each visit.  Each subject's height will be measured at the Screening Visit only.  Each subject's weight will be measured a t the Screening and 
Final/Early Termination visits.  All measurements will be recor ded in metric units where 
applicable.

Tender Joint Count (TJC) and Swollen Joint Count (SJC) Assessme nt
Swollen Joint Count
An exam of 66 joints ( Appendix E ) will be performed at the Screening Visit and all 
subsequent study visits.  The joints to be examined for swellin g are the same as those 
examined for tenderness, except the hip joints are excluded.  Joint swelling will be 
classified as present ("1"), absent ("0"), replaced ("9"), or no assessment ("NA").  For DAS28 (ESR) calculation, the 28 joints assessment will be used (Appendix F ).
Tender Joint Count
An exam of 68 joints ( Appendix E ) will be performed at the Screening Visit and at all 
subsequent study visits by pressure and joint manipulation.  Jo int pain/tenderness will be 
classified as present ("1"), absent ("0"), replaced ("9"), or no assessment ("NA").  For DAS28 (ESR) calculation, the 28 joints assessment will be used (Appendix F ).
The TJC and SJC should be performed by the clinical assessor who will be blinded to the subject's MRI and US results.  It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to 
ensure all assessors are qualified to perform joint assessments .  If possible, each subject 
should have the same assessor throughout the study as much as possible.
Physician's and Subject's Global Assessment and Assessment of P ain Sleep 
Disturbance by Visual Analog Scale (VAS)
VAS will be used to assess the physician's and subjects global assessment of disease 
activity and the subject's assessment of pain.  Each VAS consists of a horizontal 100 mm 
line anchored at either end by opposite adjectives reflecting the spectrum/severity of the parameters assessed:

RAPID 3 at Office and In-Home Disease Assessment
Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data (RAPID-3)81a validated disease activity score 
assessing physical function, patient global assessment for pain and patient global health 
will be completed at each scheduled visit ( Appendix L ).
Additionally, at the Flare Week 0 visit, subjects will be given a RAPID-3 questionnaire assessment and asked to complete the answers weekly at home without calculating the scores (and return at each visit thereafter) until Flare Week 16.
Musculoskeletal Ultrasound (US) 
Investigators will, at study start indicate, state if they want  to participate in the optional 
US assessments or not.  If they decide to and the pre-requireme nts criteria are met (as per 
the Ultrasound manual), they should perform US for every subject they recruit at time 
points indicated by the protocol; exceptions are allowed upon d iscussion with Study 
Designated Physician.  For sites participating in the ultrasoun d assessments, all subjects 
from the site should undergo the US scans and assessments as pe r protocol;
For the sites participating in the optional US assessment, high -end ultrasound equipment 
is recommended.  The US must be performed by a Rheumatologist with Ultrasonography verifiable training and/or certification and at least 3 years of regular US experience; prior experience in multicenter ultrasound study(ies) is recommended, otherwise training will be provided.  The Ultrasonographer must be independent of the clinical Investigator and will be blinded for subject characteristics; he/she should be the same person throughout the study, and a back-up with same qualifications should be appo inted.  All personnel who 
perform study-related US examinations must have been previously  trained by the sponsor 
or sponsor representative as part of this study.  The assessments and scoring will be

locally performed and afterwards the report of US assessments from all subjects will be 
sent to the central Imaging vendor.  For the first subject enrolled and for the first subject with flare assessments further procedures for quality assessmen t are required (as per 
ultrasound manual).  US should be done after clinical examination and prior to injecting study medication.  It is recommended that subjects are in rest for around 2 hours and have 
not been drinking coffee or smoking (for the last 8 hours) or taking NSAIDs (for the last 12 hours) prior to the US assessment.
The optional US will be performed during the Lead-In Period or at the dbBaseline Visit 
prior to randomization and at Flare Week 0 Visit (when applicable and at or up to 7 days 
after the visit) to assess synovial hypertrophy, tenosynovitis and erosions through gray scale ultrasonography (GSUS) and synovitis/vascularization through Power Doppler Ultrasonography (PDUS).
The US assessment will consisted of a systematic longitudinal a nd transverse multiplanar 
examination of 46 joints and 18 tendon/tendon compartments:
● The following bilateral joints were investigated for the presence of 
intra-articular B-mode synovial hypertrophy (SH) and synovial P ower Doppler 
(PD) signal:  glenohumeral (i.e., posterior and axillary recesses and biceps 
sheath), elbow (i.e., anterior, posterior and lateral recesses), wrist 
(i.e., radiocarpal, midcarpal, and distal radioulnar joints; dorsal recesses), 
first through fifth metacarpophalangeal (MCP) (i.e., dorsal recesses), first through fifth proximal interphalangeal (PIP) of the hands (i.e., dorsal and 
palmar recesses), hip (i.e., anterior recess), knee (i.e., anterior and parapatellar 
recesses), ankle joints (i.e., anterior, lateral, and medial recesses of tibiotalar joint; and medial and lateral recesses of subtalar joint), and second through 
fifth metatarsopharlangeal joints (i.e., dorsal recess).
● The following bilateral tendon will be assessed for GS and Doppler 
tenosynovitis 2
nd, 4thand 6thextensor compartments at the wrist,
2nd–5thfinger flexor tendons, tibialis posterior and peroneal tendons.

The 46-joint assessment complemented with 18 tendon compartments assessment will 
provide more data than the reduced scoring and potentially incr ease sensitivity to change 
and correlate with risk of flare.82,83
Synovial hypertrophy (SH), synovial power Doppler (PD), GS and Doppler tenosynovitis 
will be defined and scored according to the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trails (OMERACT) as per more details provided in Appendix N .  Sites participating must 
have the qualified personnel as well as available US machines meeting the minimum requirements as described together with more detailed instructions including the scoring system in a separate US manual.
12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
If this is not available, a resting 12-lead ECG will be performe d at the designated study 
visits in Table 1 .  A qualified physician will interpret the clinical significance of any 
abnormal finding, sign, and date each ECG.  Any clinically sign ificant findings will be 
documented in the source documents and later transcribed on to the appropriate eCRF.  
Each signed original ECG will be monitored by the responsible C linical Research 
Associate (CRA) and kept with subject's source documents onsite .
For subjects with a normal ECG taken within 12 months of Screening, a repeat ECG at Screening will not be required, provided all protocol required documentation is available.  If there are other findings that are clinically significant, the Principal Investigator must contact the Study Designated Physician before enrolling the sub ject.  Subjects can have a 
repeat ECG at any time during the study as warranted based on the opinion of the Investigator.
Chest X-Ray (CXR)
All subjects will undergo a standard CXR (posterior-anterior [PA] and lateral views) at 
the Screening Visit to rule out the presence of TB or other clinically relevant findings.  The CXR will not be required if the subject had a previous norm al chest x-ray within 
Adalimumab
M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26

12 months of Screening, provided all protocol required documenta tion is available at the 
site (as outlined below).
Subjects can have a repeat CXR at any time during the study as w arranted based on the 
opinion of the Investigator.In the assessment of the chest x-ray, a radiologist must note t he presence or absence of 
(1) calcified granulomas, (2) pleural scarring/thickening, and (3) signs of active TB.  The 
Principal Investigator will indicate the clinical significance of any findings and will sign 
and date the report.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
An MRI of the most affected or of the dominant hand (2ndto 5thMCP) and wrist (if both 
sides are considered equally affected) will be performed to all  subjects during the Lead-In 
Period (prior to dbBaseline Visit) and the Final/Early Termination Visit (if last MRI 
≥ 12 weeks before).
In order to assess inflammatory as well as destructive changes in RA joints, High-field 
MRI with gadolinium will be performed.A central imaging laboratory designated by AbbVie will analyze the required digital 
images and the OMERACT RAMRIS scoring for synovitis, erosions, BME and 
tenosynovitis will be calculated.MRI assessors will be blinded for subject characteristics and the clinical assessors will be 
blinded for MRI scores in order to maintain the independence of the results and allow for an association analysis.
Procedures for MRI requirements, sequences and digital imaging processing to the vendor 
will be provided in a separate manual and in Appendix M .

TB Screening
A PPD skin test (alternatively, also known as tuberculin skin test) must be placed or a 
Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA; QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test or T-SPOT TB test) must be performed during the Screening Period f or all subjects 
including those with a prior history of Bacille Calmette-Guérin  (BCG) administration.
Subjects that have a negative PPD or IGRA test and are consider ed at risk for having 
latent TB (any immunosupressed patient with a strong suspicion of TB exposure and no prior vaccination with Bacille Calmette-Guérin) need to be eval uated by a TB expert 
before Week 0.
Subjects at risk for TB exposure are defined as:
● subjects that have household contact with a person with active  TB
● subjects living in areas with high incidence of TB
● subjects that frequently visits areas with high prevalence of active TB 
If a subject had a negative PPD or IGRA test within 12 months prior to Screening, and all 
protocol required documentation is available, this test does not need to be repeated, provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant a repeat test.  These cases must be discussed with the AbbVie Study Designated Physician.
For the PPD test:
The subject will be required to have the PPD test read by a lic ensed healthcare 
professional 48 to 72 hours (or according to manufacturer's gui de) after placement 
when the induration is maximal.  An induration (not erythema) of 5 mm or greater 
will be considered as PPD positive, irrespective of BCG status or local guidelines.  The induration must be recorded in mm not as positive or negative.  The absence of induration should be recorded as "0 mm," not "negative."
Adalimumab
M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26
78
Subjects who have had an ulcerating reaction to a PPD skin test  in the past should 
not be re-exposed and should not be tested at Screening but will be considered 
PPD positive.
If there are sites where the accepted testing materials are not available an 
alternative may be substituted, but the method must be submitted  and approved by 
AbbVie prior to use with study subjects.
In the assessment of the chest x-ray, a radiologist must note t he presence or absence of 
1) calcified granulomas, 2) pleural scarring/thickening, and 3) signs of active TB. The 
Principal Investigator will indicate the clinical significance of any findings and will sign 
and date the report.  If the CXR demonstrates changes suggestiv e of previous TB 
(e.g., calcified nodule, fibrotic scar, apical or basilar pleura l thickening) or other findings 
that are clinically significant, the Principal Investigator mus t contact the AbbVie Study 
Designated Physician before enrolling the subject.
If the PPD or the IGRA test is positive or the subject has a CXR or TB expert opinion 
indicative of latent TB, the subject will be required to initiate and have taken at least 2 weeks (or per local guidelines, whichever is longer) of an ongoing course of the United States Center for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention recommen ded prophylaxis or 
prophylaxis per local guidelines prior to starting study therap y.
Subjects with a prior history of latent TB that have a documented completion of the CDC recommended or local guideline recommended prophylaxis may be p ermitted to enroll.  If 
the subject has a prior history of latent TB but has not comple ted or received prophylaxis, 
prophylaxis must be initiated.  The prophylactic treatment must be maintained during the study until its recommended full course is completed.
If the subject has a prior history of active TB they must have documentation of 
completion of CDC recommended or local guideline recommended treatment and documentation of resolution of the infection.
Adalimumab
M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26
79
In the event both a PPD test and an IGRA test are performed, the result of the IGRA test 
will supersede the result of the PPD test.  If the IGRA test is indeterminate, the site should repeat the test with another blood sample or perform a PPD test .  If the second IGRA test 
is also indeterminate, the subject is considered to be positive  and should initiate TB 
prophylaxis.
Newly initiated prophylactic treatment should be captured on the concomitant 
medications page in the eCRF and in the source documents.  Prior therapy should be captured in medical history.
Annual TB Testing:
For subjects with a negative TB test at Screening (or within the last 12 months of 
Screening), either an annual PPD or IGRA test will be required for any subject 
participating in the trial 52 weeks after their last TB test (± 2 months).  If the annual TB screen is positive (PPD is positive or the IGRA test is positiv e), a CXR may be required 
for evaluation of active TB.  For any subject with a positive annual TB screen, the site should contact the AbbVie Study Designated Physician for furthe r discussion.  Subjects 
found to have latent TB, will be required to start a course of CDC recommended prophylaxis or prophylaxis per local guidelines as soon as poss ible.  Any positive TB 
screen after the subject has started the study, should be repor ted as an AE.
An annual TB screen with PPD or IGRA testing will not be requir ed for subjects who 
have been treated for latent or active TB or have had a positiv e TB test (PPD or IGRA) at 
any time (prior to the study, Screening, annual evaluation, or testing performed at any 
time point during the study).  For such subjects, annual evaluation by a physician for clinical signs/symptoms of active TB (including a directed TB h istory and physical exam 
including lungs, lymph nodes and skin) or newly identified TB r isk factors will be 
required 52 weeks after the previous TB test.  For any subject with clinical signs/symptoms of active TB or newly identified TB risk factors , a CXR may be required 
for evaluation of active TB, and it is recommended to contact the Study Designated Physician for further guidance.

Hepatitis B Testing
If a subject had a negative hepatitis B virus (HBV) result within 12 months prior to 
Screening and all protocol required documentation is available, these tests repetition are not required.  At screening subjects must be assessed for high risk of exposure to hepatitis B since their last test.  If high risk is suspected, a hepatitis B test should be performed.
If not or no proper documentation is available all the following procedures are requested:
● Subjects will be tested for the presence of HBV at Screening.  A positive result 
for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag) will be exclusionary.  Samples 
that are negative for HBs Ag will be tested for surface antibodies (HBs Ab) and core antibodies (HBc Ab).  If test results are positive for  HBc Ab or HBs 
Ab, HBV DNA PCR will be performed and any result that meets or exceeds detection sensitivity will be exclusionary.
Pregnancy Tests
A serum pregnancy test will be performed at the Screening Visit  on all female subjects of 
childbearing potential.  At the Week 0 Visit, subjects of childbearing potential will have a 
urine pregnancy test performed locally by designated study pers onnel.  Investigators may 
conduct more frequent urine pregnancy testing as necessary acco rding to their judgment.  
If any urine pregnancy test is positive, a serum pregnancy test  will be performed by the 
central laboratory.  A lactating or pregnant female will not be  eligible for participation or 
continuation in this study.
All women of childbearing potential will have a repeat urine pr egnancy test at the Final 
Study Visit performed locally by designated study personnel.

Laboratory Tests
Blood and urine samples will be obtained for clinical laborator y tests.  Samples will be 
obtained at the designated study visits in Table 1 .  Samples will be obtained for the 
laboratory tests listed in Table 2 .
When blood draws are performed as part of a clinic visit, the draws should be performed 
after completion of questionnaires and vital sign measurements,  and before study drug 
administration.  Urine samples will be obtained for macroscopic  urinalysis (dipstick done 
at the central laboratory which will include specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, ketones, 
blood and nitrites) and a microscopic urinalysis at Screening.  For all other visits that 
require a urinalysis, the central laboratory will perform a urine dipstick analysis and if the results are abnormal, the central laboratory will perform a mic roscopic urinalysis.
If needed, according to previous sections, blood samples for he patitis B will be obtained 
at Screening Visit only.  A subject will not be eligible for st udy participation if test results 
indicate chronic or current hepatitis B infection.
A certified central laboratory will be utilized to process and provide results for the clinical 
laboratory tests.  The central laboratory chosen for this study  will provide instructions 
regarding the collection, processing and shipment of appropriate samples.
The laboratory results will be provided by the central laborato ry to the investigative site 
where they will be reviewed, signed and dated by the Investigator and filed as source data.  
For any abnormal value outside of the reference range, the Inve stigator will indicate on 
the report if the result is clinically significant (CS) or not clinically significant (NCS).  All 
abnormal laboratory test results that are considered clinically  significant by the 
Investigator will be followed to a satisfactory resolution.

● Inclusion and exclusion criteria violation was noted after the subject started 
study drug, when continuation of the study drug would place the  subject at risk 
Adalimumab
M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26
94
as determined by the AbbVie Study Designated Physician (Section  5.2and 
Section 7.0).
● Introduction of prohibited medications or dosages when continu ation of the 
study drug would place the subject at risk as determined by the  AbbVie Study 
Designated Physician.
● Subject is non-compliant with TB prophylaxis.
● The subject becomes pregnant while on study medication.
● Subject has dysplasia of the gastrointestinal tract or a malig nancy, except for 
localized non-melanoma skin cancer. Discontinuation for carcinoma in-situ of 
the cervix is at the discretion of the Investigator.
● Subject is diagnosed with lupus-like syndrome, multiple sclerosis or 
demyelinating disease.
● Subject is significantly non-compliant with study procedures w hich would put 
the subject at risk for continued participation in the trial, a s determined by the 
Investigator, in consultation with the AbbVie Study Designated Physician.
If, during the course of study drug administration, the subject prematurely discontinues 
study drug use, the procedures outlined for the Termination Vis it must be completed 
within 2 weeks of the last dose of study drug, and preferably p rior to the initiation of 
another therapy.  If subjects discontinue the study during the lead-in observational period, 
prior to randomization, a short Early Termination visit is required for: returning study material and drug, assess any safety/adverse events, collect reason for discontinuation and a 70-day follow-up call/visit; the remainder of full Early Term ination Visit study 
procedures can be completed per the investigator's discretion.  However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the Investigator feels are necessary to treat the subject's con dition.  Following 
discontinuation of the study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the 
Investigator's best clinical judgment.
A final phone call will be made to all subjects approximately 70 days after the last dose of 
study drug to determine the status of any ongoing AEs/SAEs or t he occurrence of any new 
AEs/SAEs.
Adalimumab
M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26

All attempts must be made to determine the date of the last dos e of study drug and the 
primary reason for premature discontinuation.  The information will be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF page.
For subjects that are considered lost to follow-up, reasonable attempts must be made to 
obtain information on the final status of the subject.  At a minimum, two phone calls must 
be made and one certified letter must be sent.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
AbbVie may terminate this study prematurely, either in its enti rety or at any study site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination.  The Investigator may also terminate the study at his/her site for reasonable 
cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination.  Advance notice is not required by either party if the study is stopped due to safety 
concerns.  If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, A bbVie will immediately 
notify the Investigator by telephone and subsequently provide w ritten instructions for 
study termination.

5.5.2.2 Storage and Disposition of Study Drug
Adalimumab/placebo pre-filled syringes are to be stored protected from light at 2° to 
8°C/36° to 46°F.  Study medication drug must not be frozen at any time .  A storage 
temperature log is to be maintained to document proper storage conditions.  The refrigerator temperature must be recorded on a temperature log to record proper function.  Malfunctions or any temperature excursion must be reported to t he Sponsor immediately.  
Study medication should be quarantined and not dispensed until AbbVie GPRD or AbbVie Temperature Excursion Management System (ATEMS) deems the medication as acceptable.
All clinical supplies must be stored and locked in a secure pla ce until they are dispensed 
for subject use or are returned to AbbVie.Investigational products are for investigational use only and are to be used only within the 
context of this study.
5.5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
All subjects will be assigned a unique identification number by  the IRT at the Screening 
Visit.  Subjects who meet the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria in Section 5.2.1
and Section 5.2.1 will proceed to enter the study Lead-In Period and double-blind  
randomized period.  All subjects who enter the randomized period of the study will be 
centrally randomized at dbBaseline in a 5:1 ratio double-blind fashion using the IRT 
which will assign a randomization number and a treatment group according to the randomization scheme generated by AbbVie before the start of th e study.  The treatment 
group assignment will be maintained by the IRT and not provided to the site, as the subject will be referred to by the subject number assigned at S creening.  The sites will be 
provided with appropriate kit number(s) for drug-dispensing pur pose for each subject by 
the IRT.  Study drug will be dispensed at the study visits summ arized in Table 1 .

5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Subjects should take study medication as outlined in Section 5.5.1 Treatments 
Administered.
If a subject should forget to administer the injection of study medication on their regularly 
scheduled dosing date, they should take the forgotten injection  as soon as they remember 
the dose was missed up to the day of their next scheduled dose.  The subject should not administer two doses on the same day.
In the event the incorrect dose is taken or a dose is missed, the subject should be 
instructed to contact the site to determine how to proceed with dosing.  The subject must 
record all dosing information on the Subject-Dosing Diary Sheet .
Doses not administered (e.g., not taken before next dose is scheduled), should be recorded as not taken in the source.  The extra dose should be returned to the study site full.  The 
subject should resume their regular dosing schedule based on the first dosing date at dbBaseline.
5.5.5 Blinding
5.5.5.1 Blinding of Investigational Product
All AbbVie personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and m anagement of the trial 
(with the exception of AbbVie Drug Supply Management Team) the Investigator, study 
site personnel and the subject will remain blinded to each subject's treatment throughout 
the Double-Blind Period of the study.  The IRT will provide access to blinded subject treatment information in the case of medical emergency.
In the event of a medical emergency in which the Investigator b elieves that knowledge of 
study drug treatment is required, every effort must be made to contact the AbbVie Study 
Designated Physician (Section 7.0) prior to breaking the blind as long as it does not 
compromise subject safety.  The date and reason that the blind was broken must be 
conveyed to AbbVie and recorded on the appropriate eCRF.

M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26
99
5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
The Investigator or his/her designated representatives will dis pense study drug only for 
use by subjects enrolled in the study.
The subject or their qualified designee will administer all dos es of study drug.  
Appropriate site staff will supervise the subject's administrat ion of the study drug at 
required in-office study visits to ensure proper injection technique.  In order to document 
compliance with the treatment regimen, the subject will be given a dosing sheet (Appendix D ) to record all injection dates and times.  Compliance informat ion will be 
documented on the appropriate eCRF.  Subjects will be counseled on missed doses of medication.  If the subject does not return the dosing sheet, I P boxes and sharp containers 
(when applicable), the site should question the subject and obt ain as much information as 
possible as to the dosing of the study drug.
The information should be documented on the source documents as per "best recollection" 
and when possible, re-verified when the dosing sheet is returned before completing on the applicable eCRF page.
5.5.7 Drug Accountability
The Investigator or designee will verify that study drug supplies are received intact, at the 
appropriate temperature (temperature recording devices [temptales] are provided in the shipments), and in the correct amounts.  This will be accomplis hed by documenting the 
condition of the shipment, verifying the kit numbers in the pac kage against the Proof of 
Receipt (POR) or similar document included with each drug shipment, and documenting this verification by signing and dating the POR or similar docum ent.  The original POR 
Note or similar document will be kept in the site files as a record of what was received.
In addition, an accurate running inventory of study drug will b e kept by the site on a Site 
Drug Accountability log including date received, the lot number , kit number(s), date 
dispensed, subject number, and the identification with date of the person dispensing the 
drug.
Adalimumab
M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26
100
All empty IP boxes and used pre-filled syringes will be invento ried by the site.  Each 
subject will be given their own sharps disposal container to st ore used pre-filled syringes.  
Empty IP boxes and Sharps containers should be returned by the subject at each visit for 
accountability and compliance purposes and new containers issue d as necessary.  Empty 
Boxes and returned Sharps containers will be retained (unless prohibited by local law) 
until the CRA is on site to confirm the returned medication.  CRAs and site staff will complete study medication accountability via study medication l ogs, source documents, 
subject dosing sheets, empty IP boxes and by visually inspectin g the syringes in the 
Sharps container whenever possible.  Used Sharps containers should never be opened.  Once the CRA has verified drug accountability at the site, the site staff and CRA will document that the used pre-filled syringes have been destroyed,  using appropriate 
biohazard precautions, when appropriate.  A copy of the destruc tion methodology should 
be maintained at the site's facility.  After drug accountability has been completed at the site, unused medication will be destroyed on site according to local procedures or regulation or returned to a destruction facility by the CRA.
5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups
This Phase 4 study is designed to investigate the association b etween residual disease 
activity at baseline, and the occurrence of flares in RA patien ts on adalimumab who are in 
sustained clinical remission (DAS28 [ESR] < 2.6) and submitted to an adalimumab dose 
tapering regimen or withdrawal.  The randomization 5:1 including  a control arm of 
withdrawal of adalimumab is introduced as a study design element to ensure the objectivity of flares assessments in the primary study arm.  Fo r subjects who flare the 
Open-Label Rescue Arm will provide evidence on the effect of re -treatment with 
adalimumab eow.  The proposed sample size and 36-week duration of the Double-Blind 
Period is based on the estimated risk (of approximately 30%) an d time to the occurrence 
of flare in subjects with established RA in clinical remission upon tapering or 
withdrawing TNFi therapy.

5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard statistical, clinical and laboratory procedures will b e utilized in this study.  
Efficacy measurements in this study have been selected to asses s disease activity and the 
occurrence of flares in subjects with RA using clinical scores that are standard and 
generally accepted.  Imaging techniques with MRI and US identif ying subclinical 
inflammation (synovitis, etc.) have been correlated with risk of  disease progression and 
flaring in RA patients otherwise in clinical remission.  Thus, assessing their association with occurrence of flaring (versus non-flaring) in a dose taper ing or withdrawal treatment 
strategy is deemed appropriate.  The biomarker, PK analysis and  the investigation of their 
correlation with patient outcomes is exploratory but relevant to gather more potential individual predictors for the clinical outcomes of tapering or withdrawal of adalimumab.
5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population
Subjects age ≥ 18 years diagnosed with RA, on a stable dose of adalimumab 40 mg sc 
eow (for ≥ 12 months prior to Screening Visit) in combination w ith methotrexate (MTX; 
at stable dose for ≥ 12 weeks prior to the Screening Visit) or i f not on MTX in a stable 
other allowed csDMARD or no csDMARD regimen for ≥ 12 weeks prio r to Week 0 Visit) 
and in documented clinical remission (DAS28 [ESR] < 2.6 or DAS28 [CRP] 2.6) for 
≥ 6 months prior to the study are eligible for this study.  Patie nts who are not on stable 
concomitant MTX will be allowed as per current clinical practice, but limited to 20% of the study population.  This is the target population that in ro utine clinical practice is, in 
general, being considered for therapy tapering strategies.  The  recently updated EULAR 
recommendations for the management of patients with RA
11provide some orientation to 
this extent but do not contain specific guidance to characterize the patients that could actually be submitted to a tapering regimen and do highlight th is as an area of research 
interest.

M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26
102
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
The recommended dose of adalimumab for adults with RA is 40 mg administered eow.  
Adalimumab 40 mg eow has demonstrated to improve clinical, function and to halt radiographic progression of RA for up to 10 years of treatment.
10
Dose tapering strategies with adalimumab are starting with a prolongation of injection intervals to every 3 weeks.
11,24,26,65-68  Thus the selection of patients suitable for drug 
tapering should be based on the clinical course of this initial dose tapering regimen.
In previous studies, a dose tapering strategy with increasing t he interval of administration 
of adalimumab to every 3 weeks followed by withdrawal when poss ible has been tolerated 
by a significant proportion of patients.24,65-68  In this study, subjects who experience a flare 
at any time will initiate OL adalimumab 40 mg eow rescue therap y and will be allowed to 
add other treatments at the Investigator's discretion.

103
6.1 Medical Complaints
The Investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and lab oratory evidence of adverse 
events on a routine basis throughout the study.  The Investigat or will assess and record 
any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or 
sign/symptom, severity, time course (end date, ongoing, intermi ttent), relationship of the 
adverse event to study drug, and any action(s) taken.  For seri ous adverse events 
considered as having "no reasonable possibility" of being associated with study drug, the 
Investigator will provide an "Other" cause of the event.  For a dverse events to be 
considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity.  Adverse events, whether in response to a query, observed by site person nel, or reported 
spontaneously by the subject will be recorded.
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1.1 Definitions
6.1.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical pr oduct and which does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An  adverse event can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal l aboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medi cinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any 
worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be rep orted as a new adverse 
event.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are  considered to be adverse 
events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, n ecessitate therapeutic 
Adalimumab
M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26
104
medical intervention, (meets protocol specific criteria [see Section 6.1.7 regarding toxicity 
management]) and/or if the Investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study  will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a  pre-existing condition and 
the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned prior to study entry.  However, if the 
pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the stu dy (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse e vent.
6.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious 
adverse event.
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would have 
been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospitalization or 
Prolongation of 
HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any 
length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay.  This 
does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  
Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively  
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).
Adalimumab
M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26
105
Important Medical 
Event Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to 
Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any 
of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-threatening, hospitalization, prolongation of 
hospitalization, congenital anomaly, or persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective  
or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an 
important medical event.  Examples of such events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The Investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse 
event:
Mild The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by the subject.
Moderate The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the 
subject's usual activities.
Severe The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's 
usual activities and may be incapacitating or life-threatening.
6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The Investigator will use the following definitions to assess t he relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAn adverse event where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
Adalimumab
M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26
106
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAn adverse event where there is no evidence to suggest a causal  
relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonab le possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Eve nts assessed as having no 
reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  
In addition, when the Investigator has not reported a causality  or deemed it not assessabl e, 
AbbVie will consider the event associated.
If an Investigator's opinion of no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug is 
given, an Other cause of event must be provided by the Investigator for the serious adverse event.
6.1.4 Adverse Event Collection Period
All adverse events reported from the time of study drug adminis tration until 70 days 
following discontinuation of study drug administration have ela psed will be collected, 
whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject.  In addition, serious adverse 
events and protocol-related nonserious adverse events will be c ollected from the time the 
subject signed the study-specific informed consent.  Adverse ev ent information will be 
collected and recorded on the appropriate eCRFs.
Subjects may discontinue adalimumab treatment at any time durin g study participation.  
Subjects that end study participation early will have an Early Termination/Final Visit.  All 
subjects will have a follo w-up phone call approximately 70 days  after the last 
administration of study drug to obtain information on any new or ongoing adverse events.  
The end-of-study is defined as the date of the last subject's l ast visit or the actual date of 
follow-up contact, whichever is later.

6.1.6 Pregnancy
Pregnancy in a study subject or a partner of a study subject must be reported to AbbVie 
within 1 working day of the site becoming aware of the pregnanc y.  Subjects who become 
pregnant during the study must be discontinued (Section 5.4.1 ).  Pregnancies in study 
subjects and their partners will be collected from the date of t he first dose through 
150 days following the last dose of study drug.
Information regarding a pregnancy occurrence in a study subject  or a study subject's 
partner and the outcome of the pregnancy will be collected.  In the event of pregnancy

occurring in a subject's partner during the study, written info rmed consent from the 
partner must be obtained prior to the collection of any such information.
Pregnancy in a study subject is not considered an AE.  However,  the medical outcome of 
an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is considered a SAE 
and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event.
6.1.7 Toxicity Management
Subjects who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment  with adalimumab 
should be monitored closely.  Administration of study injection s should be interrupted if a 
subject develops an infection requiring IV anti-infective treat ment or if an infection meets 
the definition of "serious" (see Section 6.0for definitions). Study medication may be 
restarted once the physician determines that the infection has been successfully treated.  
Otherwise prohibited concomitant medications may be given if me dically necessary.  
Prior to use, every attempt should be made to contact the AbbVie  Study Physician for 
direction on re-introduction of adalimumab therapy after prohib ited medication 
administration.
If the subject must undergo elective surgery, the study injecti ons must be interrupted 
2 weeks prior to the surgery.  If the subject must undergo emerg ency surgery, the study 
injections must be interrupted at the time of the surgery.  The injectable study medication 
can recommence at least 2 weeks after surgery once the physician has examined the surgical site and determined that it has healed and there is no sign of infection.
6.2 Product Complaint
6.2.1 Definition
A Product Complaint is any Complaint (see Section 6.0for the definition) related to the 
biologic or drug component of the product or to the medical device component(s).
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/ broken product or 
packaging, product appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling

discrepancies/inadequacies in the labeling/instructions (example:  printing illegible), 
missing components/product, device not working properly, or packaging issues.
For medical devices, a product complaint also includes all deaths of a patient using the 
device, any illness, injury, or adverse event in the proximity of the device, an adverse 
event that could be a result of using the device, any event needing medical or surgical intervention including hospitalization while using the device and use errors.
Any information available to help in the determination of causa lity by the device to the 
events outlined directly above should be captured.
6.2.2 Reporting
Product Complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device must be reported 
to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the study site's knowledge of the event via the Product Complaint form.  Product Complaints occurring during the study will be followed-up to a 
satisfactory conclusion.  All follow-up information is to be re ported to the Sponsor (or an 
authorized representative) and documented in source as required  by the Sponsor.  Product 
Complaints associated with adverse events will be reported in t he study summary.  All 
other complaints will be monitored on an ongoing basis.
Product Complaints may require return of the product with the a lleged complaint 
condition (syringe).  In instances where a return is requested,  every effort should be made 
by the investigator to return the product within 30 days.  If r eturns cannot be

8.0 Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample 
Size
8.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
8.1.1 Analysis Population
The analysis population for both efficacy and safety assessment  is All Treated Subjects.  It 
includes all subjects who have received at least one dose of do uble-blind study 
medication.
Unless otherwise specified, efficacy and other assessment will be primarily analyzed for 
subjects who are randomized to the adalimumab 40 mg q3 weeks arm (taper arm) and have received at least one dose of study medication.  Descripti ve statistics will be 
provided for the subjects who are randomized to the placebo arm (withdrawal arm) and have received at least one dose of study medication.
In order to evaluate the impact of major protocol violations on the results of the trial, 
additional analysis of the primary efficacy assessment may be c onducted on the per 
protocol population, which consists of all treated subjects who complete the study or otherwise have had a flare and are not major protocol violators .
8.1.2 Planned Methods of Statistical Analysis
Complete and specific details of the final statistical analysis will be described and fully documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The SAP wil l be finalized prior to the 
database lock.  The analysis will be performed using SAS (SAS I nstitute Inc., Cary, NC, 
USA).
Unless otherwise stated, all statistical inference will be base d on a 2-sided alpha-level of 
0.1.  No multiplicity adjustment will be conducted.  Descriptiv e statistics include the 
number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum for 
continuous variables; and counts and percentages for discrete variables.

8.1.3 Analysis of Demographic Data and Double-Blind Baseline 
Disease Characteristics and Other Analyses
Demographic and double-blind Baseline characteristics for all r andomized subjects will 
be summarized by treatment arm and descriptive statistics will be provided.
Medical history will be presented by count and percentage of su bjects broken down by 
Body system and Diagnosis.  Prior and concomitant medication wi ll also be summarized.
Treatment duration regardless of whether rescue therapy is recei ved will be summarized 
for All Treated Subjects.
8.1.4 Efficacy Analysis
8.1.4.1 Analysis for Primary Objective
The primary objective is to investigate the association between Baseline hand and wrist 
synovitis and BME RAMRIS scores as well as a composite of both, and the occurrence of 
flares up to Week 40 in the tapering arm.  This association will be examined using logistic regression, which is deemed as the main analysis for the primar y assessment.  The 90% 
confidence interval of the odds ratio will be calculated.  The 95% confidence intervals of the odds ratio will also be provided as an addition.
Additional analyses will be performed to assess this association using various statistical 
methods.  Specifically, descriptive statistics of Baseline MRI composite scores 
(RAMRIS) scores will be provided for the two groups of subjects  who flare and who do 
not flare, and the between-group difference in the mean scores will be computed together with a 90% confidence interval.  Linear regression will be used to model the relationship 
between the DAS28 (ESR) at flaring (or at the end of the study for subjects who do not flare) and the Baseline MRI RAMRIS scores.  Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve approach will also be utilized to investigate the potenti al flare prediction criteria 
based on MRI RAMRIS scores.  All model based analyses may adjus t for dbBaseline 
clinical patient characteristics including age, disease duration, previous and concomitant 
Adalimumab
M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26
114
treatment (such as use of MTX, use of csDMARD as versus TNFi monotheraphy), etc., 
when appropriate.
Similar analysis will be conducted for RAMRIS synovitis scores,  BME scores and the 
composite of both.For subjects who prematurely discontinue in the double-blinded period (i.e., prematurely 
discontinue prior to the detection of flaring), their last DAS28 (ESR) score will be used to 
impute their flare status.  All subjects who are classified as receiving rescue therapy will 
be treated as flare subjects.
8.1.4.2 Analysis for Secondary Objectives
To characterize the development of flares, the proportion of subjects who flare in the taper 
arm and withdraw arm and overall, and the 90% confidence interval of this proportion will be calculated.  Time to flare in these two arms will be summarized using Kaplan-Meyer survival techniques.  The proportion of subjects w ithin each level of flare 
severity will also be computed for the taper arm and withdraw a rm and overall, 
accompanied by a 90% confidence interval.
To investigate the association between the occurrence of a flar e and the specified 
dbBaseline parameters similar analyses will be conducted as for  the primary assessment.
To evaluate the effectiveness of re-treatment with adalimumab 4 0 mg eow as a rescue 
therapy after flaring, the proportion of flared subjects who re gain clinical remission will 
be calculated with a 90% confidence interval, separately for su bjects from the tapering 
arm and from the withdrawal arms.  To assess the time to regain clinical remission, the 
proportion of flared subjects who regain clinical remission will  be summarized over time 
by the duration of rescue therapy, separated for subjects from the tapering arm and from 
the withdraw arm.
To describe the MRI change for subjects in the taper, withdraw and Open-Label Rescue 
Arms, the change from Baseline to end of study in MRI RAMRIS sc ores and its

individual component scores for synovitis and edema will be summarized separately for 
flared and non-flared subjects originated in the taper and withdraw arm respectively.
To describe the disease course of subjects in the taper, withdr aw and Open-Label Rescue 
Arms, different clinical and health reported outcome measures, which are listed in 
Section 5.3.5.2 will be summarized over time separately for flared and non-flar ed subjects 
originated in the taper and withdraw arm respectively.
8.1.4.3 Analysis for Exploratory Objectives
The ultrasonographic assessments will be performed at dbBaseline and at flare.  
Descriptive statistics of ultrasonography (US) synovial inflamm ation (Power Doppler 
[PD]) and synovial hypertrophy (Gray Scale [GS]) scores at dbBaseline will be summarized for the flared and non-flared subjects to assess the ir association with the 
occurrence of RA flares.  In addition, the scores at flare as well as change from dbBaseline will be summarized.  Additional analyses to assess the association between dbBaseline ultrasonographic scores and the occurrence of a flare will be performed if deemed necessary.
To assess the association between dbBaseline US synovial inflammation (PD) and 
synovial hypertrophy (GS) scores and Baseline MRI synovitis RAMRIS score, linear regression approach will be used to modeling the relationship between the dbBaseline PDUS and GSUS scores and Baseline MRI synovitis RAMRIS score.
Biomarker values including dbBaseline and their change from dbBaseline over time will 
be summarized for the flared subjects and the non-flared subjec ts.  Additional analyses to 
assess the association between biomarker and the occurrence of a flare will be performed if deemed necessary.
The occurrence and time to flare from dbBaseline in the concomitant MTX, other 
csDMARDs and no csDMARDs patients will be analyzed for potential differential effect.

8.1.5 Pharmacokinetic Analyses
Adalimumab serum concentrations will be summarized by treatment  group at each time 
point using descriptive statistics including number of subjects , number of non-missing 
observations (n nmiss), mean, median, standard deviation, coefficient of variation (CV), 
minimum, and maximum as appropriate.  Individual subject concen trations versus time 
plots and mean concentration versus time plots by treatment gro up will be provided.  Data 
listings will be generated for individual subjects.  For the calculation of summary statistics 
and plots, concentration values below limit of quantification ( LOQ) will be set to zero.
The association between dbBaseline adalimumab trough concentrations and the occurrence of flares will be assessed as appropriate.  In addition, pharmacokinetic model based analyses may be performed with the focus on apparent clea rance (CL/F) and 
apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of adalimumab.
AAA will be evaluated for each subject and each study arm, and rates of AAA positive 
subjects will be calculated.  As appropriate, the effect of AAA on adalimumab pharmacokinetics, efficacy variable(s), and treatment-emergent adverse events may be evaluated.
8.1.6 Safety Analysis
Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) will be summarized and reported.  
Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as AEs that begin either on or after the first dose of 
the study medication, through the end of the AE collection peri od as defined by the 
protocol.  The number and percent of subjects experiencing trea tment-emergent AEs will 
be tabulated by treatment and by body system and Medical Dictio nary for Drug 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA
®) preferred term.  In addition, summary of 
treatment-emergent AEs by severity and relationship to study drug will be presented.  AEs, which are serious, severe, or life-threatening, or lead to  premature study drug 
discontinuation will be listed and described in detail.
Adalimumab
M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26
117
Mean change in laboratories variable and vital signs variables at each visit will be 
summarized for all treated subjects.  The last evaluation prior  to the first dose of 
double-blinded study drug will be used as dbBaseline for all an alyses.  For selected 
parameters, a listing of all subjects with any laboratory determination meeting Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) of Grade 3 or higher will be provided.  Shift tables for changes 
from dbBaseline according to the normal range will also be provided for lab variables.
8.1.7 Interim Analysis for Double-Blind Baseline Characteristics
There are few data describing patient disease characteristics including markers of residual 
inflammation such as sensitive imaging assessments and potentia l biomarkers as well as 
drug levels in RA patients who are in sustained clinical remission on a stable treatment with a TNFi and MTX and/or with other csDMARDs(s) or in TNFi mo notherapy.  An 
interim analysis will be conducted to describe the dbBaseline c haracteristics of the RA 
population.  It will be performed after the dbBaseline assessme nts of the entire study 
population have been completed.  The study team will remain bli nded to individual data.  
The details of the interim analyses/evaluation will be describe d in interim analysis charter.
8.1.8 Compliance 
Treatment compliance will be calculated for each subject as the number of injections 
actually received divided by the number of injections should ha ve received during the 
subject's participation in the study (rounded to 0.1%).  Compli ance will be summarized 
for All Treated Subjects.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
The planned total number of subjects enrolled into the Lead-In Period is approximately 
200. 
A recently published study (DOSERA) showed that 56% (15/27 patients) of patients who 
were previously in low disease activity had treatment failure w ithin 48 weeks after 
reducing the dose of etanercept; the median time to failure was 36 weeks (95% CI:15.6-NE).
89  The STRASS study, also published in 2015, showed in a similar  RA 
Adalimumab
M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26
118
patient population, that progressive tapering of TNFi therapy ( adalimumab or etanercept) 
was associated with flare in 76.6% (49/64) of patients througho ut the study duration; 
importantly, 28.8% of patients flared after the first step of ta pering (adalimumab 40 mg  
q3 weeks or etanercept 50 mg q10 days) and the median time to flare was 9 months.90  In 
another tapering study (DRESS) a cumulative incidence of short- lived flares in a 
progressive tapering of TNFi of 55% at 9 months (and 73% at 18 months) was observed.  
Among these studies, the DRESS study had the higher sample size  with 121 patients in 
the taper arm but only 43% successfully tapered the TNFi.  None of these studies was 
designed or powered to evaluate predictors of flare neither fou nd definite predictors upon 
further statistical analysis.  A proof of concept study conducted in 44 RA patients in clinical remission receiving treatment with a bDMARD has shown that residual synovial inflammation determined by comprehensive ultrasound assessment predicted relapse 
within a short term after discontinuation of the treatment.
91
These data provided the rational for assuming a conservative flare rate of 30% and for our sample size calculation.
To estimate the odds ratio for the occurrence of flare with bas eline MRI score based on 
historical MRI data, an effective sample size of 150 subjects i n the dose tapering group 
will ensure a precision for the estimation with the width of 90% CI no more than 0.03 for 
an odds ratio 1.03, no more than 0.07 for an odds ratio 1.1, an d no more than 0.14 for an 
odds ratio 1.2.  Such sample size will also ensure a precision for the estimation of a correlation coefficient ρ with the width of 90% CI of ρ no more than 0.26 for a mild correlation coefficient 0.28, no more than 0.18 for a moderate correlation coefficient 0.55, and no more than 0.13 for a higher correlation with ρ = 0.67.  Assuming a 30% flare rate, this sample size will provide the precision that the 2-sided 90% CI of the flare rate has a half width no more than 6%.
Sensitivity precision levels under various assumptions are pres ented in Table 4 .

119
Under a 5:1 randomization ratio (dose tapering versus withdrawal), a total of 180 subjects 
will be randomized.  Accounting for a 10% discontinuation rate during the Lead-In 
Period, approximately 200 subjects will need to be enrolled int o the Lead-In Period.

Study Drug Dosing Schedule
Subject Number:  _____________________________________
You will require subcutaneous (SC) injections throughout the study.Call you doctor at any time if you feel that your disease is wor sening.
You will receive the following number of injections during the study:
● At the Lead-In Week 0 Visit (the first visit to receive study medication for this 
study) you will receive 1 injection at the clinic (self-administ er or receive help 
from site staff) and 1 injection to take 2 weeks after the Week 0 Visit.
● At Week 4 at the start of the Double-Blind Period, you will re ceive 2 syringes.  
At the Week 4 Visit, you will administer the injection at the c linic.  You will 
take the other 1 syringe home to be administered at Week 7.  During the 
remainder of the Double-Blind Period (Weeks 10, 16, 22, 28 and 34), you will 
receive 2 syringes at each visit to be taken (one to be administ ered at the visit 
and the other to be taken at home 3 weeks later) at Weeks 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34 and 37, respectively.
● If at any time you have a flare and it is confirmed, you will enter the Open 
Label Rescue Arm and start a Flare Week 0 Visit.  You must return all 
double-blind medication at the next visit. 
○ At the Flare Week 0 Visit, you will receive 2 syringes.  One i njection of 
open-label adalimumab will be administered at the clinic.  You will take 
the other 1 syringe home to be administered 2 weeks later at Fl are Week 2. 
○ At the Flare Week 4 and 10 Visits, you will receive 3 syringes at each visit 
(one to be administered at the visit and the other 2 to be take n separately at 
home every two weeks) to be taken at Flare Weeks 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 
respectively. 
○ If your time of injection falls on a clinic day, you must inje ct study drug 
after all study procedures are performed (not prior).

Throughout the study, you will receive active study medication (or placebo).  You or a 
trained designee will inject your study drug at the following timepoints: 
● every other week in the Lead-In Period
● every 3 weeks in the Double-Blind Period 
● every other week in the Open-Label Rescue Arm
If you meet the criteria for flare at any time during the Doubl e-Blind Period, you will 
receive rescue therapy (active study drug) for 16 weeks.  You w ill not administer study 
medication at your last visit.
Please return all used and unused syringes, the sharps container and empty boxes to the 
clinic on your next visit.  Used syringes should be placed in the special Sharps container provided.  All unused syringes should be returned in the original box.
If an injection is missed or something occurs where the full dose cannot be injected, 
contact your study center immediately for further instructions.   Please record any missed 
doses on your subject dosing sheet.
Remember to complete your dosing sheet after each injection and to call the doctor's 
office if you are having problems administering your study medi cation.
General Information

Injection Procedures (PFS)
1. Setting up for an injection
● Find a clean flat surface.
● Do not use if the seals on the carton are broken or missing.  Contact your study 
doctor's office if the seals are broken.
● Take one kit with the prefilled syringe(s) of adalimumab from the refrigerator.  
Do not use a prefilled syringe that has been frozen or if it ha s been left in direct 
sunlight.
● Return any unused syringe(s) to the refrigerator.
You will need the following items for each dose:
● study medication in pre-filled syringe(s)
● alcohol prep(s)
● cotton ball or gauze pad(s)

146
If you do not have all of the items you need to give yourself a n injection, call your study 
physician.  Use only the items provided in the box your adalimumab comes in.
● Make sure the liquid in the prefilled syringe is clear and colorless.  Do not use 
a prefilled syringe if the liquid is cloudy or discolored or ha s flakes or particles 
in it.
● Have a special sharps (puncture proof) container nearby for disposing of used 
needles and syringes.
For your protection, it is important that you follow these instr uctions.
2. Choosing and preparing an injection site
● Wash your hands well.

Adalimumab
M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26
147
● Choose a site on the front of your thighs or your stomach area  (abdomen).  If 
you choose your abdomen, you should avoid the area 2 inches aro und your 
belly button (navel).
● Choose a different site each time you give yourself an injecti on.  Each new 
injection should be given at least one inch from a site you used before.  Never 
inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or har d or where you 
have scars or stretch marks.
● If you have psoriasis, you should try not to inject directly i nto any raised, 
thick, red or scaly skin patches or lesions.
● You may find it helpful to keep notes on the location of your injection sites.
● Wipe the site where adalimumab is to be injected with an alcoh ol prep (swab), 
using a circular motion.  Do not touch this area again until yo u are ready to 
inject.
3. How to prepare your adalimumab dose for injection with a Pre- filled Syringe
● Hold the syringe upright with the needle facing down.  Check t o make sure 
that the amount of liquid in the syringe is the same or close t o the 0.8 mL line 
for the 40 mg pre-filled syringe.  The top of the liquid may be  curved.  If the 
syringe does not have the correct amount of liquid, do not use that syringe.  
Call your study doctor.
● Remove the needle cover taking care not to touch the needle wi th your fingers 
or allow it to touch any surface.
● Turn the syringe so the needle is facing up and slowly push th e plunger in to 
push the air in the syringe out through the needle.  If a small  drop of liquid 
comes out of the needle that is okay.
● Do not shake the syringe.

148
4. Injecting Adalimumab
● With your other hand, gently squeeze an area of the cleaned ar ea of skin and 
hold it firmly.
● You will inject into this raised area of skin.  Hold the syringe like a pencil at 
about a 45° angle (see picture) to the skin.
● With a quick, short, "dart-like" motion, push the needle into the skin.
● After the needle is in, let go of the skin.  Pull back slightly on the plunger.  If 
blood appears in the syringe it means that you have entered a b lood vessel.  Do 
not inject adalimumab.  Pull the needle out of the skin and repeat the steps to 
choose and clean a new injection site.  Do not use the same syri nge.  Dispose 
of it in your special sharps container.  If no blood appears, s lowly push the 
plunger all the way in until all of the adalimumab is injected.
● When the syringe is empty, remove the needle from the skin keeping it at the 
same angle it was when it was pushed into the skin.
● Press a cotton ball or gauze pad over the injection site and hold it for 
10 seconds.  Do not rub the injection site.  You may have slight bleeding.  This is normal.
● Dispose of the syringe right away into your special sharps container.

Appendix N. Ultrasound Assessments and Scoring – Sample
For the sites that will be part of the optional Ultrasound assessment, Grey 
Scale-Ultrasound (GSUS) as well as Power-Doppler Ultrasound (PD US) will be 
performed to all subjects included in the study at the defined time points of the protocol.
In light of the current evidence, 46-joint validated assessment  and 18 tendon/tendon 
compartment assessment will be performed with the inclusion of the following bilateral:
● Joints:  glenohumeral (i.e., posterior and axillary recesses a nd biceps sheath), 
elbow (i.e., anterior, posterior and lateral recesses), wrist ( i.e., radio-carpal, 
midcarpal, and distal radioulnar joints; dorsal recesses), first through fifth 
metacarpophalangeal (PIP) of the hands (i.e., dorsal and palmar recesses), hip (i.e., anterior recess), knee (i.e., anterior and parapatellar recesses) ankle joints 
(i.e., anterior, lateral, and medial recesses of tibiotalar joint; and medial and 
lateral recesses of subtalar joint), and second and fifth metatarsophalangeal joints (i.e., dorsal recess).  Joints will be investigated for the presence of 
intra-articular B-mode synovial hypertrophy (SH) and synovial P ower Doppler 
(PD) signal.  Ankle SH or synovial PD signal positive will be c onsidered if 
they were detected in either the tibiotalar or the subtalar joi nts
● Tendons:  2
nd, 4thand 6thextensor compartments at the wrist, 2nd–5thfinger 
flexor tendons, tibialis posterior and peroneal tendons.  Tendons will be 
assessed for GS and Doppler tenosynovitis.
Intra-articular synovial hypertrophy (SH) will be defined according to the Outcome 
Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials (OMERACT) as the prese nce of abnormal 
hypoechoic (relative to subdermal fat) intraarticular tissue th at is nondisplaceable and 
poorly compressible.
At each intra-articular synovial recess, B-mode SH will be scor ed semiquantitatively on a 
scale of 0 – 3 (0, absent; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, marked).Synovial PD signal will be also scored on a semiquantitative scale of 0 – 3 (0, no synovial 
PD signal; 1, mild [≤ 3 PD signals within the SH]; 2, moderate [> 3 PD signals in less

M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26
182
than half of the SH area]; 3, marked [PD signals in more than half of the SH area]).  Each 
joint was scored for B-mode SH and synovial PD signal on a scale from 0 to 3.  These scores will correspond to the maximum score for SH and PD signal, respectively, obtained from any one of the synovial sites evaluated at each joint.  GS and Doppler tenosynovitis will be defined and scored according to OMERACT.
83,84-86
Technical Requirements:
Different models of ultrasound machines are allowed as long as GS and PD are available.  
It's recommended to use high-end machines as per the training m anual which will be 
provided.
US Assessment Conditions:
The US assessments are to be performed during the Screening or Lead-In Period prior to 
dbBaseline Visit by an expert in musculoskeletal ultrasound wit h verifiable training 
and/or certification and at least 3 years of experience.  Ideally, the Ultrasonographer 
should have prior experience in multicenter study(ies) using ul trasound evaluation in RA 
patients; otherwise training will be provided.  All ultrasound assessors will be provided with more details in a US manual.  Ideally the same assessor at  each site should perform 
all US evaluations.  The US assessor will be blinded to clinical parameters and the clinical assessor will be blinded to US scoring.
B-mode and PD machine settings will be optimized before the stu dy and standardized for 
the whole study.  The US assessment should be performed in a da rkened room with 
temperature kept stable.  Patients should have been at least 2 hours resting, and should not 
have drank coffee, alcohol, smoked cigarettes or practiced sport within the prior 8 hours 
or taking NSAIDs within the prior 12 hours.
Further details will be provided in the US manual.

The 1987 Criteria for the Classification of RA87
Criterion Definition
1.  Morning stiffness Morning stiffness in and around the joints, lasting for at least 
1 hour before maximal improvement
2.  Arthritis of 3 or more joint areas At least 3 joint areas simultaneously have had soft tissues 
swelling or fluid (not bony overgrowth alone) observed by a 
physician.  The 14 possible joints areas are right or left PIP, 
MCP, wrist, elbow, knee, ankle, and MTP joints
3.  Arthritis of hand joints At least 1 area swollen (as defined  above) in a wrist, MCP or 
PIP joint.
4.  Symmetric arthritis Simultaneous involvement of the same joi nt areas (as defined 
in 2) on both sides of the body (bilateral involvement of PIPs, MCPs, or MTPs is acceptable without absolute symmetry)
5.  Rheumatoid nodules Subcutaneous nodules over bony prominences, or extensor 
surfaces, or in juxta-articular regions, observed by a physicia n
6.  Serum rheumatoid factor Demonstration of abnormal amounts of  serum rheumatoid 
factor by any method for which the result has been positive in < 5% of normal control subjects
7.  Radiographic changes Radiographic changes typical of RA on p osteranterior hand 
and wrist radiographs, which must include erosions or 
unequivocal bony decalcification localized in or most marked adjacent to the involved joints (osteoarthritis changes alone d o 
not qualify)
For classification purposes, a patient is said to have RA if he/she has satisfied at least 4 of 
these 7 criteria.  Criteria 1 through 4 must have been present for at least 6 weeks.  Patients with 2 clinical diagnoses are not excluded.  Designation as cla ssic, definite or probable 
RA is not to be made.

* The criteria are aimed at classification of newly presenting patients.  In addition, patients with erosive disease 
typical of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with a history compatible with prior fulfillment of the 2010 criteria should 
be classified as having RA.  Patients with longstanding disease, including those whose disease is inactive (with or without treatment) who, based on retrospectively available data, have previously fulfilled the 2010 criteria should be classified as having RA.
â€ Differential diagnoses vary among patients with different presentations, but may include conditions such as 
systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and gout.  I f it is unclear about the relevant differential 
diagnoses to consider, an expert rheumatologist should be consu lted.
â€¡ Although patients with a score of < 6/10 are not classifiabl e as having RA, their status can be reassessed and 
the criteria might be fulfilled cumulatively over time.
Â§ Joint involvement refers to any swollen or tender joint on examination, which may be confirmed by imaging 
evidence of synovitis.  Distal interphalangeal joints, first ca rpometacarpal joints, and first metatarsophalangeal 
joints are excluded from assessment.  Categories of joint distribution are classified according to the location and number of involved joints, with placement into the highest category possible based on the pattern of joint 
involvement.
Â¶ "Large joints" refers to shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles.
# "Small joints" refers to the metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints, second through 
fifth metatarsophalangeal joints, thumb interphalangeal joints, and wrists.
** In this category, at least 1 of the involved joints must be a small joint; the other joints can include any 
combination of large and additional small joints, as well as other joints not specifically listed elsewhere 
(e.g., temporomandibular, acromioclavicular, sternoclavicular, etc.).

and assay; low-positive refers to IU values that are higher tha n the ULN but ≤ 3 times the ULN for the 
laboratory and assay; high-positive refers to IU values that ar e > 3 times the ULN for the laboratory and assay. 
Where rheumatoid factor (RF) information is only available as positive or negative, a positive result should be 
scored as low-positive for RF.  ACPA = anti-citrullinated prote in antibody.
â€¡â€¡ Normal/abnormal is determined by local laboratory standards.  CRP = C-reactive protein; ESR = erythrocyte

Objectives:
The primary objective is to investigate the association between residual disease acti vity at Baseline as 
detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the occurrence of flares in RA subjects randomized 
to an adalimumab dose tapering regimen controlled by adalimumab withdrawal.
The Secondary Objectives are:
!To assess the occurrence and severity of flares and the time to  flare in both taper and withdrawal 
arms.
!To investigate the association between Double-Bind Baseline (db Baseline) subject demographic 
and disease characteristics and the occurrence of flares.
!To investigate the association between dbBaseline adalimumab trough concentrations and the 
occurrence of flares.
!To evaluate the effectiveness of rescue therapy with open-label  adalimumab 40 mg every other 
week (eow) over 16 weeks in subjects experiencing a flare. 
!To assess the change in rheumatoid arthritis MRI scoring system (RAMRIS) scores from Baseline to Final visit in the taper, withdrawal and Open-Label  Rescue Arms.
!To describe the course of disease using clinical and patient re ported outcomes (PROs) measures 
in the taper, withdrawal and Open-Label Rescue Arms.
!To assess the rate of anti-adalimumab antibodies (AAA) positive subjects in the taper and withdrawal arms.
The study also has the following exploratory objectives:
!In the subgroup of subjects with a dbBaseline Ultrasound (US) a ssessment: 
oTo investigate the association between dbBaseline ultrasound sc ores and the occurrence of 
flares. 
oTo investigate the association between the dbBaseline ultrasoun d scores and Baseline MRI 
RAMRIS scores.
oTo describe the change in the ultrasound scores from dbBaseline to the time of the occurrence of a flare in the taper and withdrawal arms.
!To investigate the association between biomarker values at dbBaseline (or their change over time) and the occurrence of flares.

Study Sites: Approximately 53 sites
Study Population:
Subjects age ≥ 18 years diagnosed with RA, on a stable dose of adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously (sc) 
eow (for ≥ 12 months prior to Screening Visit) in combination w ith methotrexate (MTX) (at stable dose 
for ≥ 12 weeks prior to the Screening Visit) and in documented clinical remission, defined as DAS28 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) < 2.6 or DAS28 c-reactive protein (CRP) < 2.6, for ≥ 6 months 
prior to the Screening Visit and DAS28 (ESR) < 2.6 at the Scree ning Visit.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 334
Adalimumab
M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26
188
Methodology:
This is a Phase 4, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, paral lel-group study in subjects with RA who 
are in stable clinical remission defined as DAS28 (ESR) or DAS2 8 (CRP) < 2.6 for at least 6 months 
prior to the Screening Visit.  Though the cut-off for clinical remission of DAS28 (CRP) may not be 
equivalent to the DAS (ESR), in clinical practice both are frequently used to define remission as < 2.6.  
Both will be allowed for the purposes of identifying subjects f or Screening; however, throughout the 
study clinical remission will be defined by the more stringent DAS28 (ESR) < 2.6 criteria.  At 
Screening, only subjects with confirmed DAS28 (ESR) < 2.6 will be considered for inclusion in the 
study.
The study activities will start with a Screening Period of up to 21 days to confirm inclusion/exclusion 
criteria including a DAS28 (ESR) assessment of < 2.6.
Subjects who have signed the Informed Consent and who fulfill a ll Screening criteria will enter the 
study.  Study starts with a 4-week Lead-In Open-Label (OL) Peri od during which stable DAS28 (ESR) 
clinical remission in 2 assessments 4 weeks apart will be confirmed.  Subjects will receive adalimumab 
40 mg sc eow starting at Week 0 Visit of the Lead-In Period; thi s will be approximately 2 weeks after 
their last commercial Humira®.
At Week 4, the end of the Lead-In Period, subjects will have a dbBaseline visit.  Subjects must have a 
confirmed DAS28 (ESR) remission at two time points in order to be randomized:
1. DAS28 (ESR) < 2.6 at the Lead-In Period Week 0
2. DAS28 (ESR) < 2.6 at the dbBaseline visit Week 4
Subjects who meet the remission criteria will be randomized (5: 1) to one of two double-blind arms and 
followed for additional 36 weeks in the Double-Blind Period: 
1. A reduced frequency of adalimumab 40 mg sc every 3 weeks (q3w ks):  taper arm, or
2. Adalimumab placebo sc q3wks:  withdrawal arm.
All subjects will maintain the required MTX (any dose; oral or sc) at a stable dose for at least 12 weeks 
prior to Screening and throughout the Lead-In and Double-Blind Periods of study. 
Any other allowed RA concomitant medications should also be kep t stable throughout the Lead-In and 
Double-Blind Periods of the study; these medications and MTX wi ll be received by local prescriptions. 
During the Double-Blind Period, subjects will be evaluated ever y 6 weeks for efficacy, including 
detection of flares, PROs, safety and laboratory assessments at scheduled visits on:  Weeks 4, 10, 16, 22, 
28, 34 and 40 (Final visit).
Other unscheduled visits will occur in the suspected event of a flare.  During the interval between 
scheduled visits, subjects will be asked to contact their physi cians in case of feeling their disease is 
worsening:  an unscheduled visit will be performed within 2 weeks of contact with the site to assess if 
subjects are experiencing a flare.

Methodology (Continued):
Subjects with a confirmed flare (defined as an increase from dbBaseline in DAS28 [ESR] of > 0.6 AND 
a DAS28 [ESR] > 2.6, OR an increase in DAS28 (ESR) of ≥ 1.2 irr espective of the resulting DAS28 
[ESR]) at any time point (at a scheduled or unscheduled visit) will undergo Flare Week 0 visit 
procedures and will be immediately switched to an Open-label re scue arm initiating adalimumab 40 mg 
eow rescue therapy.
In the Open-Label Rescue Arm, subjects will be further evaluate d at Flare Weeks 4, 10 and 16 for 
efficacy, PROs, safety and laboratory assessments.During this period, further treatment escalation/change will be  allowed based on the Investigator's 
medical judgment.  Any treatments escalation/change will be doc umented.  At Flare Week 0, all subjects 
will be requested to initiate weekly at home self-assessment of their RA disease activity by using 
Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data (RAPID)-3 questionnair e until Week 16.
See study schematic below:
A high-field contrast MRI of the most affected or of the dominant hand (2
ndto 5thMCP) and wrist (if 
both sides are considered equally affected), will be performed on all subjects during the Lead-In Period 
(prior to the dbBaseline visit) and at Final/Early Termination Visit.
The acquired MRI images will be centrally read and Investigator s will be blinded to the results.  Subjects 
should be randomized only when the MRI has been confirmed to be received and complete by Central 
Imaging.

Methodology (Continued):
In sites that meet pre-specified ultrasound requirements and wh o wish to participate in the ultrasound 
portion of the study, subjects will undergo US assessment using Gray Scale Ultrasonography (GSUS) 
and Power Doppler Ultrasonography (PDUS) consisting in a system atic longitudinal and transverse 
multiplanar examination of 46 joints and 18 tendon/tendon compa rtment during Lead-In or at dbBaseline 
Visit prior to randomization and at the Flare Week 0 Visit (if applicable).  US will be performed and

Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
Analysis for Primary Objective:
The association between the occurrence of flares and Baseline M RI RAMRIS scores will be examined 
using logistic regression, which is deemed as the main analysis to address the primary objective.  
Additional analyses will be performed to assess this association using various statistical methods.  Specifically, descriptive statistics of Baseline MRI RAMRIS scores will be provided for the two groups of subjects who flare and who do not flare, and the between-gro up difference in the mean scores will be 
computed together with a 90% confidence interval (CI).  Linear regression will be used to model the 
relationship between the DAS28 (ESR) at flaring (or at end of s tudy for subjects who do not flare) and 
the Baseline MRI RAMRIS scores.  Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve approach will also be utilized to investigate the potential flare prediction criteria  based on MRI RAMRIS scores.  All model 
based analyses may adjust for dbBaseline clinical patient characteristics including disease duration, 
previous treatment, etc. when appropriate.
Similar analysis will be conducted for RAMRIS synovitis scores, BME scores and the composite of 
both.
Analysis for Secondary Objectives:
Within the analyses to address the secondary objectives the association between dbBaseline disease 
characteristics and the occurrence of flares will be examined u sing similar analyses as for the primary 
objective.  In addition, characterization of flares, response to rescue therapy in subjects experiencing a flare and the clinical and patient reported efficacy outcomes f or all trial subjects will be analyzed 
accordingly.
Pharmacokinetic:
Adalimumab trough serum concentrations will be summarized by treatment arm at each time point using 
descriptive statistics.  The association between dbBaseline ada limumab trough concentrations and the 
occurrence of flares will be assessed.  In addition, pharmacoki netic model-based analyses may be 
performed with the focus on apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of 
adalimumab.
Immunogenicity :
AAA will be evaluated for each subject and each study arm, and rates of AAA positive subjects will be 
calculated.  As appropriate, the effect of AAA on adalimumab pharmacokinetics, efficacy variable(s), and treatment emergent adverse events may be evaluated.
Safety:
Frequency tables and lists of subjects with treatment-emergent AEs by preferred term as in the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 17.0 dictionary, by system organ class and by causality 
to the study medication as assessed by the Investigator will be  provided.  Laboratory test values will be 
summarized over time.

195
Determination of Sample Size:
The planned total number of subjects enrolled into the Lead-In Period is approximately 334.
To estimate the odds ratio for the occurrence of flare with bas eline MRI score based on historical MRI 
data, an effective sample size of 250 subjects in the dose tapering group will ensure a precision for the 
estimation with the width of 90% CI no more than 0.1 for an odds ratio 1.2, no more than 0.4 for an odds ratio 1.5, and no more than 1.0 for an odds ratio 1.8.  Such sa mple size will also ensure a precision for 
the estimation of a continuous correlation coefficient ρ with t he half width of 90% CI of ρ no more than 
0.1 for a mild correlation coefficient 0.2, no more than 0.09 fo r a moderate correlation coefficient 0.4, 
and no more than 0.07 for a higher correlation with ρ = 0.6.  A ssuming a 30% flare rate, this sample size 
will provide the precision that the 2-sided 90% CI of the flare  rate has a half width no more than 5%.
Under a 5:1 randomization ratio (dose tapering vs. withdrawal),  a total of 300 subjects will be 
randomized.  Accounting for a 10% discontinuation rate during t he Lead-In Period, approximately 
334 subjects will need to be enrolled into the Lead-In Period.

Study Sites: Approximately 72 sites in North America, Europe and Australia
Study Population:
Subjects age ≥ 18 years diagnosed with RA, on a stable dose of a dalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously (sc) 
eow (for ≥ 12 months prior to Week 0 Visit) in combination with methotrexate (MTX) (at stable dose for 
≥ 12 weeks prior to Week 0 Visit) or if not on MTX, another all owed conventional synthetic 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) at stable dos e or no csDMARDs for ≥ 12 weeks 
prior to Week 0 Visit) and in documented clinical remission, defined as DAS28 erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) < 2.6 or DAS28 c-reactive protein (CRP ) < 2.6, for ≥ 6 months prior to the 
Screening Visit and DAS28 (ESR) < 2.6 at the Screening Visit.  Patients who are not treated with 
concomitant stable dose of MTX are limited to a maximum of 20% of the study population.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 200  
Methodology:
This is a Phase 4, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, paral lel-group study in subjects with RA who 
are in stable clinical remission defined as DAS28 (ESR) or DAS28 (CRP) < 2.6 for at least 6 months 
prior to the Screening Visit.  Though the cut-off for clinical remission of DAS28 (CRP) may not be 
equivalent to the DAS (ESR), in clinical practice both are frequently used to define remission as < 2.6.  Both ESR or CRP and 4 or 3 (when Patient Global Assessment [PGA ] is not available) variables DAS28 
will be allowed for the purposes of identifying subjects for Sc reening; however, throughout the study 
clinical remission will be defined by the more stringent 4 varia bles DAS28 (ESR) < 2.6 criteria.  At 
Screening, only subjects with confirmed 4 variables DAS28 (ESR) <  2.6 will be considered for inclusion 
in the study.
The study activities will start with a Screening Period of up to 28 days to confirm inclusion/exclusion 
criteria including a DAS28 (ESR) assessment of < 2.6.
Subjects who have signed the Informed Consent and who fulfill all Screening criteria will enter the 
study.  The study starts with a 4-week Lead-In Open-Label (OL) Period during which stable DAS28 (ESR) clinical remission in 2 assessments 4 weeks apart will be confirmed.  Subjects will receive adalimumab 40 mg sc eow starting at the Week 0 Visit of the Lea d-In Period; this will be approximately 
2 weeks after their last commercial Humira
®.  If needed for study procedures completion or injection 
scheduling adjustment, the lead-in period can be extended for up  to 2 more weeks in which case the 
Week 4 Visit study procedures will occur up to 6 weeks after the Week 0 Visit.
At Week 4, the end of the Lead-In Period, subjects will have a dbBaseline visit.  Subjects must have a 
confirmed DAS28 (ESR) remission at two time points in order to be randomized:
1. DAS28 (ESR) < 2.6 at the Lead-In Period Week 0
2. DAS28 (ESR) < 2.6 at the dbBaseline visit Week 4
Subjects who meet the remission criteria will be randomized (5: 1) to one of two double-blind arms and 
followed for additional 36 weeks in the Double-Blind Period: 
1. A reduced frequency of adalimumab 40 mg sc every 3 weeks (q3w ks):  taper arm, or
2. Adalimumab placebo sc q3wks:  withdrawal arm.

Methodology (Continued):
All subjects who are taking concomitant MTX (any dose oral, subcutaneous [sc] or intramuscular [im]) 
and/or other csDMARDs at a stable dose for at least 12 weeks pr ior to Week 0 Visit will maintain the 
regimen throughout the Lead-In and Double-Blind Periods of stud y.  Subjects who have not been taking 
any csDMARDs for at least 12 weeks prior to the Week 0 Visit, will also maintain this regimen 
throughout the Lead-In and Double-Blind Periods of study.
Any other allowed RA concomitant medications should also be kept  stable throughout the Lead-In and 
Double-Blind Periods of the study; these medications and MTX wi ll be received by local prescriptions. 
During the Double-Blind Period, subjects will be evaluated ever y 6 weeks for efficacy, including 
detection of flares, PROs, safety and laboratory assessments at scheduled visits on:  Weeks 4, 10, 16, 22, 
28, 34 and 40 (Final visit).
Other unscheduled visits will occur in the suspected event of a flare.  During the interval between 
scheduled visits, subjects will be asked to contact their physi cians in case of feeling their disease is 
worsening:  an unscheduled visit will be performed within 2 weeks of contact with the site to assess if subjects are experiencing a flare.
Subjects with a confirmed flare (defined as an increase from dbBaseline in DAS28 [ESR] of > 0.6 AND 
a DAS28 [ESR] > 2.6, OR an increase in DAS28 (ESR) of ≥ 1.2 irr espective of the resulting DAS28 
[ESR]) at any time point (at a scheduled or unscheduled visit) will undergo Flare Week 0 visit 
procedures and will be immediately switched to an Open-label re scue arm initiating adalimumab 40 mg 
eow rescue therapy.
In the Open-Label Rescue Arm, subjects will be further evaluated at Flare Weeks 4, 10 and 16 for 
efficacy, PROs, safety and laboratory assessments.
During this period, further treatment escalation/change will be  allowed based on the Investigator's 
medical judgment.  Any treatments escalation/change will be documented.  At Flare Week 0, all subjects 
will be requested to initiate weekly at home self-assessment of their RA disease activity by using 
Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data (RAPID)-3 questionnaires until Week 16.

Methodology (Continued):
A high-field contrast MRI of the most affected hand (2ndto 5thMCP) and wrist will be performed on all 
subjects during the Lead-In Period (prior to the dbBaseline vis it) and at Final/Early Termination Visit.  If 
both sides are considered equally affected, the MRI of the dominant hand (2ndto 5thMCP) and w rist will 
be performed.  The acquired MRI images will be centrally read and Investigator s will be blinded to the results.  Subjects 
should be randomized only when the MRI has been confirmed to be received and complete by Central 
Imaging.
In sites that meet pre-specified ultrasound requirements and who wish to participate in the ultrasound 
portion of the study, subjects will undergo US assessment using Gray Scale Ultrasonography (GSUS) 
and Power Doppler Ultrasonography (PDUS) consisting of a system atic longitudinal and transverse 
multiplanar examination of 46 joints and 18 tendon/tendon compa rtment during Lead-In or at dbBaseline 
Visit prior to randomization and at the Flare Week 0 Visit (if applicable).  US will be performed and 
assessed by local Ultrasonographer independent of the clinical assessor who will be blinded to the US scores.
Pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity will be assessed based on serum adalimumab trough 
concentrations and serum anti-adalimumab antibodies (AAA), respectively.  Blood samples for 
adalimumab concentrations and measurements of AAA will be taken prior to dosing at dbBaseline 
(Week 4), at Weeks 10, 16, 28, 40 and at Early Termination, Flare Weeks 0, 4 and 16 (if applicable).
A panel of inflammatory biomarkers:  matrix metalloproteinase 3  (MMP3), Collagen neo-epitope 
(C1M), Type III collagen neo-epitope (C3M), Matrix metalloprote inase-mediated c-reactive protein 
(CRPM), Matrix metalloproteinase-degraded citrullinated vimentin (VICM), Serum amyloid-associated 
protein (SAA), Interleuci n-6 (IL-6), Chemokine (C-X-C motif) li gand 10 CXCL10 and CXCL13 will be 
assessed at dbBaseline (Week 4), Weeks 10, 16, 28, 40 or at Early Termination, Flare Weeks 0, 4 and 
16 (if applicable) on blood samples taken prior to dosing.  At t he time of analysis, other potential 
biomarkers identified as adding value to predict flare in this patient population may be included.
Additional optional samples for future biomarker research will be collected.

Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
Safety:
Screening assessments will include medical history, vital signs, physical examination, and clinical and 
laboratory tests.  The following safety evaluations will be per formed during the study:  concomitant 
medication review, adverse event (AE) monitoring, vital signs, physical examination (if required) and 
laboratory tests.
Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
Analysis for Primary Objective:
The association between the occurrence of flares and Baseline MRI RAMRIS scores will be examined 
using logistic regression, which is deemed as the main analysis to address the primary objective.  Additional analyses will be performed to assess this associatio n using various statistical methods.  
Specifically, descriptive statistics of Baseline MRI RAMRIS sco res will be provided for the two groups 
of subjects who flare and who do not flare, and the between-gro up difference in the mean scores will be 
computed together with a 90% confidence interval (CI).  Linear r egression will be used to model the 
relationship between the DAS28 (ESR) at flaring (or at end of s tudy for subjects who do not flare) and 
the Baseline MRI RAMRIS scores.  Receiver operating characteris tic (ROC) curve approach will also be 
utilized to investigate the potential flare prediction criteria  based on MRI RAMRIS scores.  All model 
based analyses may adjust for dbBaseline clinical patient characteristics including disease duration, 
previous and concomitant treatment, etc. when appropriate.
Similar analysis will be conducted for RAMRIS synovitis scores, BME scores and the composite of 
both.
Analysis for Secondary Objectives:
Within the analyses to address the secondary objectives the ass ociation between dbBaseline disease 
characteristics and the occurrence of flares will be examined using similar analyses as for the primary 
objective.  In addition, characterization of flares, response to rescue therapy in subjects experiencing a flare and the clinical and patient reported efficacy outcomes for all trial subjects will be analyzed 
accordingly.
Pharmacokinetic:
Adalimumab trough serum concentrations will be summarized by treatment arm at each time point using 
descriptive statistics.  The association between dbBaseline adalimumab trough concentrations and the occurrence of flares will be assessed.  In addition, pharmacoki netic model-based analyses may be 
performed with the focus on apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of
adalimumab.
Immunogenicity :
AAA will be evaluated for each subject and each study arm, and rates of AAA positive subjects will be 
calculated.  As appropriate, the effect of AAA on adalimumab pharmacokinetics, efficacy variable(s), 
and treatment emergent adverse events may be evaluated.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Safety:
Frequency tables and lists of subjects with treatment-emergent AEs by preferred term as in the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 17.0 dictionary, by system organ class and by causality 
to the study medication as assessed by the Investigator will be provided.  Laboratory test values will be 
summarized over time.
Determination of Sample Size:
The planned total number of subjects enrolled into the Lead-In Period is approximately 200.
To estimate the odds ratio for the occurrence of flare with baseline MRI score based on historical MRI 
data, an effective sample size of 150 subjects in the dose tapering group will ensure a precision for the estimation with the width of 90% CI no more than 0.03 for an odds ratio 1.03, no more than 0.07 for an odds ratio 1.1, and no more than 0.14 for an odds ratio 1.2.  S uch sample size will also ensure a precision 
for the estimation of a correlation coefficient ρ with the widt h of 90% CI of ρ no more than 0.26 for a 
mild correlation coefficient 0.28, no more than 0.18 for a moderate correlation coefficient 0.55, and no more than 0.13 for a higher correlation with ρ = 0.67.  Assuming a 30% flare rate, this sample size will 
provide the precision that the 2-sided 90% CI of the flare rate has a half width no more than 6%.
Under a 5:1 randomization ratio (dose tapering vs. withdrawal),  a total of 180 subjects will be 
randomized.  Accounting for a 10% discontinuation rate during the Lead-In Period, approximately 
200 subjects will need to be enrolled into the Lead-In Period.

Section 3.3.1  Additional Considerations on Key Study Parameter s
Subsection Clinical Remission Defined by DAS28 < 2.6
Last paragraph previously read:
In this study, clinical remission for subjects inclusion in the study is defined by the 
potentially more stringent DAS28 (ESR) < 2.6; flare will be ass essed based on 
DAS28(ESR) evaluation at any time point throughout the study (w ith ESR measured in 
the same visit).  However, due to the common use of both scores in clinical practice, for the purpose of identifying subjects for Screening, both DAS28 (ESR) and (CRP) documented as being lower than 2.6 for at least 6 months prior to screening will be accepted.  At Screening only, subjects with DAS28 (ESR) < 2.6 may be enrolled.
Has been changed to read:
In clinical practice it's relatively frequent to use the also validated 3 variables DAS28
32or 
instead of the most widely used DAS28 4 variables due to difficulties on getting 
documented patient global assessment (PGA) in a Visual Analogue  Scale (VAS).  
Moreover, a recent study has shown that despite the existence of individual patient baseline differences prior to treatment with TNFi, after 12 wee ks of TNFi and particularly 
for the lower range the 3 and 4 variables DAS28 (CRP).scores were similarly sensitive to change, highly correlated and the mean inter-score difference w as very small.
33  
Accordingly, for the purpose of identifying subjects on stable clinical remission for 
≥ 6 months for Screening, both DAS28 (ESR) and (CRP) 4 or 3 (when PGA is not available) variables documented as being lower than 2.6 for at least 6 months prior to screening will be accepted.  However, at Screening, only subjec ts with 4 variables DAS28 
(ESR) < 2.6 may be enrolled and throughout the study clinical r emission is defined by the 
4 variables DAS28 (ESR) < 2.6.  Flare will be assessed based on DAS28 (ESR) evaluation at any time point throughout the study (with ESR measured in the same visit).
Concomitant Treatments for RA
The 2013 EULAR recommendations update propose that in RA patients who are in stable 
clinical remission particularly if also treated with concomitan t csDMARDs(s) tapering a 
Adalimumab
M14-500 Protocol Amendment 1EudraCT 2014-001114-26
206
bDMARD is an option; the updated 2015 ACR guidelines also consider tapering RA 
treatments as an option for such a patient population.  Both treatment recommendations acknowledge that more data on tapering is needed as part of a research agenda.
It is the aim of this study to assess, in subjects treated in real life clinical practice 
conditions who have DAS28 < 2.6, if imaging-detected sub-clinic al inflammation (and 
disease, patient and treatment patterns as well as adalimumab drug level characteristics) brings an additional benefit in predicting and informing clinicians about who has a higher risk of flare while treated with a reduced dose of adalimumab.
As this study goal is to include patients as treated in routine  clinical practice, the patient 
population must be in line with both treatment recommendations and clinical practice.  
Accumulated data from registries and other real world evidence, such as CORRONA,
34
US healthcare insurance claims database, 35BSRBR,36RABBIT,37Nor-DMARD38and 
ARTIS39are showing that around 30% – 34% of patients being treated with bDMARDs 
including TNFi are on monotherapy even if at initiation of the bDMARD the vast 
majority of patients were on combination therapy.40  As such this study will include 
mainly patients who are in stable remission for more than 6 mon ths as assessed by DAS28 
< 2.6 and after at least 1 year of treatment with adalimumab with concomitant MTX for at 
least the last 12 weeks prior to inclusion; in order to be in line with the current clinical practice up to 20% of the study patient population may be compo sed of subjects who are 
not treated with concomitant stable MTX but instead are treated with other than MTX allowed csDMARDs or not treated with a csDMARD as long as this treatment regimen is 
stable for at least 12 weeks prior to Week 0.

2-sided 90% CI of the flare rate has a half width no more than 5 %.
Under a 5:1 randomization ratio (dose tapering versus withdrawal), a total of 300 subjects will be randomized.  Accounting for a 10% discontinuation rate during the Lead-In Period, approximately 334 subjects will need to be enrolled into  the Lead-In Period.
Has been changed to read:
The planned total number of subjects enrolled into the Lead-In Period is approximately 
200. 
A recently published study (DOSERA) showed that 56% (15/27 pati ents) of patients who 
were previously in low disease activity had treatment failure w ithin 48 weeks after 
reducing the dose of etanercept; the median time to failure was 36 weeks (95% 
CI:15.6-NE).
89  The STRASS study, also published in 2015, showed in a similar  RA 
patient population, that progressive tapering of TNFi therapy ( adalimumab or etanercept) 
was associated with flare in 76.6% (49/64) of patients througho ut the study duration; 
importantly, 28.8% of patients flared after the first step of t apering (adalimumab 40 mg  
q3 weeks or etanercept 50 mg q10 days) and the median time to flare was 9 months.90  In 
another tapering study (DRESS) a cumulative incidence of short- lived flares in a 
progressive tapering of TNFi of 55% at 9 months (and 73% at 18 months) was observed.  Among these studies, the DRESS study had the higher sample size  with 121 patients in 
the taper arm but only 43% successfully tapered the TNFi.  None of these studies was designed or powered to evaluate predictors of flare neither found definite predictors upon further statistical analysis.  A proof of concept study conduct ed in 44 RA patients in 
clinical remission receiving treatment with a bDMARD has shown that residual synovial

inflammation determined by comprehensive ultrasound assessment predicted relapse 
within a short term after discontinuation of the treatment.91
These data provided the rational for assuming a conservative flare rate of 30% and for our 
sample size calculation.
To estimate the odds ratio for the occurrence of flare with baseline MRI score based on 
historical MRI data, an effective sample size of 150 subjects i n the dose tapering group 
will ensure a precision for the estimation with the width of 90% CI no more than 0.03 for an odds ratio 1.03, no more than 0.07 for an odds ratio 1.1, and no more than 0.14 for an odds ratio 1.2.  Such sample size will also ensure a precision for the estimation of a correlation coefficient ρ with the width of 90% CI of ρ no more than 0.26 for a mild correlation coefficient 0.28, no more than 0.18 for a moderate correlation coefficient 0.55, and no more than 0.13 for a higher correlation with ρ = 0.67.  Assuming a 30% flare rate, this sample size will provide the precision that the 2-sided 90% CI of the flare rate has a half width no more than 6%.
Sensitivity precision levels under various assumptions are prese nted in Table 4 .
Under a 5:1 randomization ratio (dose tapering versus withdrawal), a total of 180 subjects 
will be randomized.  Accounting for a 10% discontinuation rate during the Lead-In Period, approximately 200 subjects will need to be enrolled into  the Lead-In Period.

10.3 Electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (ePROs)
An electronic patient-recorded outcomes (ePRO) device will be p rovided to subjects 
during screening and will be completed at all subject visits in the office.  An additional 
device will be given to subjects at their flare Week 0 visit (if applicable) and will be completed at home weekly.  Site personnel will provide training  on the proper use of the 
e-Diary.  These data will be uploaded to a server, the data on the server will be considered 
source, and maintained and managed by CRF Health.  Patient reported data are completed for each subject screened/enrolled in this study.  An ePRO tool  called Trialmax, provided 
by the technology vendor CRF Health of Plymouth Meeting, PA, US A, will be used to 
collect this data. The ePRO system is in compliance with Title 21 CFR Part 11.  
Internet access to the ePRO data will be provided by CRF Health for the duration of the trial.  This access will be available for the duration of the trial to the site investigator, as well as delegated personnel.  Such access will be removed from investigator sites 
following the receipt of the study archive.  Data from the ePRO tool will be archived on appropriate data media (CD-ROM, etc.) and provided to the inves tigator at that time as a 
durable record of the site's ePRO data.  It will be possible for the investigator to make paper print-outs from that media. 
The electronic device may be programmed to allow data entry for  only certain periods of 
time.  All data entered on the device will be immediately store d to the device itself and 
manually/automatically uploaded to a central server administrat ed by CRF Health.  The 
investigational site staff will be able to access all uploaded subject entered data via a 
password protected website, up until the generation, receipt an d confirmation of the study 
archive.

Protocol Title:   A Phase 1/2 Study Evaluating the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of ABT -199 in Subjects 
with Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
Objectives:
Phase 1 Portion (Dose Escalation, Safety Expansion and Venetoclax -Dexamethasone (VenDex) 
Com bination: 
The primary objectives are to assess the safety profile, characterize pharmacokinetics (PK), determine 
the dosing schedule, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) 
of venetoclax monotherapy when administered in subjects wi th relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma 
(MM).  This study will also assess the safety profile and PK of venetoclax in combination with 
dexamethasone in subjects with t(11;14) -positive MM.  The secondary objectives are to evaluate the 
preliminary efficac y data regarding the effect of venetoclax monotherapy or combined with 
dexamethasone on objective response rate (ORR), time to response (TTR), time to disease progression 
(TTP), and duration of response (DOR).  
Phase 2 Portion (VenDex Expansion): 
The pri mary objective of the Phase 2 portion is to further evaluate the ORR and very good partial 
response or better rate (VGPR+) in subjects with t(11;14) -positive multiple myeloma.  The secondary 
objectives are to monitor safety, progression free survival (PFS) , DOR, TTR, TTP, and overall survival 
(OS) and to evaluate Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) including Worst Pain (Brief Pain Inventory –
Short Form [BPI -SF]), Physical Functioning and Global Health Status/Quality of Life (GHS/QoL) 
(European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 
[EORTC QLQ -C30]), and Fatigue (Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
[PROMIS] Cancer Fatigue Short Form [SF]).  The tertiary objectives of the Phase 2 portion are to as sess 
other PRO endpoints (remaining subscales/items from BPI -SF, EORTC QLQ- C30, European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Multiple Myeloma 
Module [EORTC QLQ -MY20], and Euroqol EQ -5D-5L.
The exploratory objecti ves for both portions are to evaluate pharmacodynamic and predictive 
biomarkers for association with PK, safety, and efficacy.  In addition, minimal residual disease (MRD) 
will be assessed in the bone marrow  by next generation sequencing (NGS).
Investigat ors:  Multicenter
Study Sites:   Approximately 32 sites.
Study Population:   Relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma subjects.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 166 –186 (86 subjects in the Phase 1 portion and 
approximately 80 – 100 subjects in the Phase 2 portion)

Methodology:
This is a Phase 1/2, open -label, multicenter study evaluating the safety and PK profile of venetoclax 
under a once daily dosing schedule.  This study will consist of 2 distinct portions (Phase 1 and Phase 2).  
The Phase 1 portion includes dose escalation, safety expansion, venetoclax -dexamethasone (VenDex) 
combination.  The dose escalation cohort of the study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic 
profile of venetoclax in approximately 30 subjects, w ith the objective of defining dose limiting toxiciti es 
(DLTs) and the MTD.  The safety expansion cohort will evaluate venetoclax at the MTD defined in the 
dose escalation portion in approximately 36 additional subjects in order to further define the toxicity 
profile, test biomarker correlates, and better in form the RPTD determination for subjects with MM.  The 
VenDex combination cohort will evaluate the safety and efficacy of venetoclax at the RPTD in 
combination with dexamethasone in approximately 20 subjects with t(11;14) -positive MM.  The Phase 2 
portion is an expansion cohort of the VenDex combination and will further evaluate the efficacy of 
approximately 80 – 100 additional relapsed or refractory subjects w ith t(11;14) -positive MM.  
Investigators and/or qualified site staff will assess the ORR and VGPR+ rate per IMWG criteria.
Survival information (i.e., alive or deceased, and if deceased, the date and cause of death) and post 
treatment information will be collected approximately every 12 w eeks (or as needed to allow  for more 
frequent data collection) un til death, the subject is lost to follow -up, the subject withdraws consent, or 
the study is terminated by AbbVie, whichever occurs first.
Non-treatment emergent death (those occurring > 30 days after the final dose of study drug) information 
will also be c ollected.  Subject must request to be withdrawn specifically from survival follow -up.

Investigational Products: Venetoclax (ABT -199):  10 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg Tablets
Dexamethasone (For subjects enrolled to the VenDex combination 
and Phase 2 cohorts):  4 mg tablets
Non-Investigational Product: Dexamethasone (For subjects enrolled to the dose escalation and 
safety expansion cohorts)
Doses: All subjects will begin dosing with a lead -in period w ith step -wise 
dose escalation to the designated cohort dose during the dose 
escalation and safety expansion portions.
Subjects in the first cohort will begin the lead -in period w ith a starting 
dose of 5 0 mg and will step up in increments anticipated to be at least 
50mg to a designated cohort dose level of 300 mg.  Based on 
additional clinical data from the enrolled subjects, the starting dose for 
the lead -in period may be further reduced to less than 50 mg.
In the first dose -escalation cohort, the first dose for the second subject 
will not be administered until at least 1 week after the first dose of the 
first subject.  Staggered enrollment may continue for subsequent 
cohorts.
In subsequent cohorts, modi fications in the lead -in period may occur 
based on tolerability.  Increases or decreases in the lead -in period 
starting dose and/or changes in the dosing increments may be 
implemented.  For example, the starting dose of 50 mg in subsequent 
cohorts may be l owered; dose escalation may then occur in smaller 
increments.  The lead -in period may be eliminated if toxicities such as 
clinically significant metabolic abnormalities of tumor lysis syndrome 
(TLS) are not observed.
A lower starting dose and/or modificati ons to the lead -in regimen may 
be implemented for individual subject(s) at particularly high risk for 
TLS.
The venetoclax designated cohort dose w ill begin at 300 mg/day and 
escalate to the MTD w ith a minimum of 3 subjects at each dose level.  
Designated c ohort dose escalation or de -escalation decisions to the 
next designated cohort dose will be made after subjects have 
completed the lead -in period (if applicable) plus one cycle (21 days) 
at the designated cohort dose.  Escalation of designated cohort dose 
will occur in increments of 100 mg unless data indicate smaller 
increments are required.  De -escalation will occur in increments of 
50mg unless data indicate other increments are required.  Decisions 
will be informed by subject tolerability and safety dat a.
During dose escalation and safety expansion portions, upon 
assessment of progressive disease, investigators may add 
dexamethasone dosed orally starting at 40 mg using label guidelines.  
Dexamethasone will be dosed on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21 -day 
cycle.

Doses (Continued): During the VenDex combination and Phase 2 cohorts, a lead -in period 
with step wise dose escalation w ill not be implemented.  Subjects will 
take venetoclax RPTD of 800 mg daily (QD) in combination w ith 
dexamethasone.  Dexamethasone (40 mg) will be dosed orally (PO) 
on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21 -day cycle.  All subjects who are 
≥75years old may start dexamethasone at a 20 mg dose.
Mode of Adm inistration: Oral (PO)
Duration of Treatm ent:  Anticipated duration is 10 months.
Criteria for Evaluation:
Efficacy Assessment:   Phase 1 Portion subjects w ill be evaluated for preliminary efficacy using the 
International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma (IMWG, 2011); Phase 2 Portion subjects 
will be evaluated for efficacy using IMWG 2016 response criteria.  
PROs wil l be evaluated using BPI -SF, EORTC QLQ -C30, European Organization for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Multiple Myeloma Module (EORTC QLQ -MY20), 
PROMIS Cancer Fatigue SF, and EuroQoL EQ -5D-5L (EQ- 5D-5L).
Pharm acokinetic Assessm ent:  Intensive pharmacokinetic samples will be collected for venetoclax in 
the dose escalation cohort.  Sparse pharmacokinetic samples will be collected for venetoclax in the dose 
escalation, safety expansion, VenDex combination and Phase 2 cohorts.  Fo r the intensive 
pharmacokinetic days, values for the pharmacokinetic parameters of venetoclax, including the maximum 
observed plasma concentration (C max), the time to C max(peak time, T max) and the area under the plasma 
concentration -time curve (AUC) over a 24-hour dose interval (AUC 0-24) will be determined using 
noncompartmental methods.  Additional parameters may be calculated if useful in the interpretation of 
the data.
Biom arkers:   Biospecimens (blood, serum, plasma, bone marrow  aspirate and bone marro w core biopsy 
tissue) will be collected to investigate biomarkers.  Types of biomarkers analyzed may include:  BCL -2 
family member expression, chromosomal abnormalities (IgH translocations, amplifications, or 
deletions), and MRD.  Additional biomarkers ana lyzed may include nucleic acids, proteins, lipids or 
metabolites.  The samples may be analyzed as part of a multi -study assessment of factors involved in the 
response to therapy or the disease state.  Results may or may not be included in the clinical stud y report.
Safety Assessment:   Adverse event monitoring, vital signs, physical examination, 12 -lead ECG, 
multiple gated acquisition scan (MUGA)/2D echocardiogram, and laboratory assessments.  Guidelines 
for the management for TLS are provided.
Statistical Methods:  3+3 design (for dose escalation purposes)
Efficacy:   The follow ing efficacy endpoints will be assessed:  ORR, VGPR+, PFS, DOR, TTR, TTP, 
and OS.
Pharm acokinetic:   An analysis will be performed on PK variables for single and multiple doses to 
simultaneously explore for demographic variables that explain some of the variability in 
pharmacokinetics and to address questions of dose proportionality and linear kinetics.   Additional 
analyses, e.g., time to reach steady state, will be performed if useful and appropriate.
Safety:   A safety analysis will be performed for all subjects participating in the study unless otherwise 
indicated.  For the study as a whole, adverse events will be evaluated and summarized.  Laboratory test 
results and vital signs will be explored for trends and summarized as appropriate.

3.0 Introduction
3.1 Multiple My eloma (MM)
Multiple my eloma is an incurable malignancy  arising from post germinal center, 
terminally  differentiated plasma cells, characterized by  an excess of monoty pic plasma 
cells in the bone marrow, resulting in elevated levels of monoclonal immunoglobulins (Ig) 
in the serum and/or urine.1  Common cl inical sequelae include l ytic bone lesions, 
fractures, myelosuppression, and renal failure.  In the United States of America, the 
estimated annual diagnosed incidence is 16,000, with approximately  50,000 prevalent 
cases.  In Europe, the estimated annual diagnosed incidence is 21,611 with approximately  
54,536 prevalent cases.2  Multiple my eloma accounts for 10% of all hematologic 
malignancies and 1% of all malignancies.  Advances in high -dose chemotherap y and stem 
cell transplantation have improved overall survival and event -free disease periods in 
patients with MM, but relapses are inevitable.3,4  New therapeutic agents, such as 
bortezomib and thalidomide analogues (IMiD®), have shown promising clinical benefit in 
patients with relapsed or refractory disease.  Current treatments include combination 
chemothe rapy with regimens using melphalan (Alkeran®), bortezomib (Velcade®), 
thalidomide (Thalomid®), and lenalidomide (Revlimid®) with and without corticosteroids.  
Younger patients are consolidated with high
-dose therap y (ablative chemotherapy or 
radiation) wit h autologous stem cell transplantation.  I n addition, newer agents with 
encouraging single agent activity  are currentl y in clinical trials for the relapsed/refractory 
population.  Treatment of subjects with carlfilzomib, a new generation proteasome 
inhibit or, has resulted in a response rate of about 25% in subjects who received a prior 
IMiD®and Velcade®.5  Pomalidomide, a new generation immunomodulatory drug, in 
combination with dexamethasone resulted in a similar response rate in MM subjects 
refractory  to both an IMiD®and Velcade®.6  
Despite these therapeutic advances, MM 
remains essentiall y incurable and is associated with high morbidity and mortality.7

3.2 Bcl-2 Family  of Proteins in Multiple My eloma
There are two main pathway s of apoptosis or programmed cell death, namely  the 
extrinsic, or death recepto r-mediated pathway , and the intrinsic, or mitochondrial 
pathway .  The intrinsic pathway  is regulated b y a delicate balance between anti -apoptotic 
(Bcl-2, Bcl-x L, Bcl- w, Bfl -1/A1, and Mcl -1) and pro -apoptotic (Bax, Bak, Bid, Bcl -xS, 
Bad, Bik, Bim, and Hrk) members of the Bcl -2 family .  Anti -apoptotic Bcl -2 family  
members are localized in the mitochondrial outer membrane, nuclear membrane, or the 
endoplasmic reticulum, while most of the pro -apoptotic members are in the cy tosol or 
localized to the cy toskeleton .  Normally , Bax and Bak are sequestered by  the 
anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl -2, Bcl -xL, and/or Mcl -1 and prevented from translocating to 
mitochondria.  However, various damaging stimuli can result in their liberation and 
translocation to the mitochondrial o uter membrane, leading to an increase in 
mitochondrial permeability , the release of cy tochrome c, and activation of caspase 9 
through its binding to Apaf -1.  This in turn leads to activation of effector caspases like 
caspase 3 and cellular apoptosis.  Plas ma cells are ty picall y geared towards long -term 
survival and have low apoptotic rates, likely due to high levels of anti -apoptotic proteins 
such as Bcl -2.  Dy sregulation of apoptotic pathways in these cells, often via Bcl -2 
overexpression, is thought to pl ay a major role in the development and progression of 
multiple my eloma.  Antagonizing Bcl -2 function to induce apoptosis is thus a compelling 
therapeutic approach in multiple my eloma.

current version of the Investigator 's Brochure.
3.3 Pharmacology , Preclinical Data and Initial Clinical Data
ABT -199 (Venetoclax) Activity and Preclinical Pharmaco kinetic Profile
ABT -199 (Venetoclax) is a novel, orall y bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Bcl -2 
(Ki< 0.10 nM) with much lower affinity for Bcl -xL and Bcl -w (> 480- fold and 
>2,000- fold lower affinity , respectivel y).  In vitro, venetocalx has demons trated broad  
Venetoclax (ABT -199)

23
cell killing activity  against hematopoietic tumor cell lines including B -cell follicular 
lymphomas (FL), mantle cell ly mphomas (MCL), diffuse large B -cell l ymphomas 
(DLBCL), acute m yeloid leukemias (AML), and multiple my elomas (MM).  Venetocla x 
was especially  potent against FL  and DLBCL cell lines expressing high levels of Bcl -2 
due to the t(14;18) translocation.  The sensitivity  of MM cell lines correlated most closely  
with their Bcl -2/Mcl -1 mRNA expression ratio, with the most sensitive cell lines 
expressing high levels of Bcl -2 relative to Mcl -1, a known resistance factor for Bcl -2 
inhibitors.  Multiple my loma cell lines bearing the t(11;14) translocation were particularl y 
sensitive to venetoclax (6 of 8 cell lines with an LD 50< 100 nM, medi an LD 50= 10 nM).  
Similar trends were observed for MM primary  samples treated ex vivo with venetoclax, 
with four of five t(11;14) -positive samples being especially  sensitive (LD 50< 100 nM).8
The pharmacokinetic behavior of venetoclax was evaluated in multiple animal species.  In 
mouse, rat, monkey  and dog the pharmacod ynamic profile was characterized by low 
plasma clearance and low volumes of distribution.  Half -lives ranged from 2.2 hours in 
monkey  to 12 hours in dog.  Food had a marked effect on the oral bioavailability  in dogs.
Venetoclax has high protein binding to human, rat, dog, and monkey  plasma proteins 
(>99.9%).  In rats, venetoclax was widely distributed into liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, 
lungs, small intestine, and white fat, but was poorly distributed in testes, brain, muscle, 
and bone.  Metabolism was the major route of elimination with biliary  excretion of the 
parent drug play ing the secondary  role in rats.  Venetoclax showed moderate metabolic 
stability  in vitro hepatic sy stems across species tested, except for low to moderate stabilit y 
in dog hepatocy tes.
In vitro, venetoclax was metabol ized by  CYP3A4; it was not a potent inhibitor of 
CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 (I C50 > 30 µM); it did not induce 
CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 at concentrations up to 10 µM.  Venetoclax is a substrate for P -gp 
and BCRP.  Studies in Oatp1a/b cluster KO mice indicated that venetoclax may  be an 
OATP substrate.  Active uptake of venetoclax or M27 was not observed in cells 
overexpressing OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or OCT1.  Venetoclax is a P -gp, BCRP and 
OATP1B1 inhibitor in vitro.

Venetoclax Preclinical Toxicology
Venetoclax has been assessed in repeated- dose general toxicology  studies, and in genetic, 
developmental/reproductive, and safety  pharmacology  studies.
Repeated -dose oral toxicity  studies with venetoclax were conducted in mice and dogs.  
GLP-compliant definitive toxicity  studies consisted of IND -enabling studies in mice and 
dogs with 4 weeks of dosing followed b y a 4-week (dose -free) recovery period; a 2 -week 
toxicity  study  in dogs that focused on lymphocy te recovery  over an extended (18 -week) 
recovery  period; and chronic toxicity  studies in mice (6 months) and dogs (9 months).  No 
recovery  periods were included in the chronic toxicity studies.  The maximum venetoclax 
plasma exposures (mean AUC 0-24 h) achieved in the 4 -week studies were 92 µg•hr/mL (at 
600 mg/kg/day ) in mice and 572 µg•hr/mL (at 150 mg/kg/day ) in dogs.  In the chronic 
toxicity  studies, AUCs reached 34.1 µh•h/mL  (at 300 mg/kg/day ) in mice and 
139µh•h/mL  (at 20 mg/kg/day ) in dogs.
The primary  toxicities associated with venetoclax administration included effects on the 
hematologic s ystem (decreased l ymphocy tes and ery throcy tes) in mice and dogs; the male 
dog reproductive s ystem (testicular germ cell depletion); and embry ofetal toxici ty in mice.
In mice and dogs, venetoclax produced robust decreases in l ymphocy tes in the peripheral 
blood (of up to 75% in mice and up to 81% in dogs) and in lymphoid tissues.  I n dogs, the 
recovery  of lymphocy te counts (total ly mphocy tes, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and mature 
Bcells) was prolonged, requiring up to 18 weeks after completion of 2 weeks of dosing.  
B cells were the most sensitive ly mphocy te subt ype based on the magnitude of decrease 
and/or the length of time required for recovery .  Decreases of l ymphocy tes in ly mphoid 
tissues were reversible in mice and reversible to partially reversible in dogs.   
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
25
venetoclax -related decreases in ly mphocy tes in blood and ly mphoid tissues are considered 
pharmacologically -mediated and non -adverse.9
Venetoclax effects on red blood cell mass parameters principall y consisted dose- related 
decreases of hematocrit and hemoglobin in mice and dogs; these effects were adverse onl y 
at the highest dosages in the 4- week mouse and dog studies and were reversible.  Effects 
on the white and red cell counts are readil y monitored in clinical trial subjects.
No effects of venetoclax 
have been identified in female reproductive tissues in mice or 
dogs in general toxicology studies.  However, in dogs venetoclax produced adverse, 
non-reversible, non -dose related microscopic findings of testicular germ cell depletion at 
all dosages tested; however, there were no testicular effects in mice.  The testicular effecs 
may be related to venetoclax pharmacology , as one or more members of the Bcl -2 famil y 
of proteins play  a role in spermatogenesis.10-12  The translatability of the testicular 
findings in dogs to humans is unknown.  I n view of the potential treatment benefits of 
venetoclax, this finding is anticipated not to impact the treatment of subjects with relapsed 
or refractory  multiple m yeloma.
Venetoclax resulted in increased postimplantation loss and decreased fetal body  weights 
in the mouse embry ofetal development study  at the highest dosage administered 
(150 mg/kg/day ); the no -observed -adverse -effect -level (NOAEL) was defined at the 
mid-dose of 50 mg/kg/day.  Venetoclax was not teratogenic, and there were no other 
effects on development or fertility.
Venetoclax produced loss of hair pigmentation in dogs (reversibility  has not been 
assessed).  Evidence from Bcl -2 knockout mouse (Bcl -2 -
/-) studies indicates that hair 
hypopigmentation is consistent with the pharmacological effect of Bcl -2 functional loss, 
and occurs due to loss of hair follicle melanocy tes dependent on Bcl -2 for survival.13  A 
dedicated ph ysical exam of the skin and extensive ophthalmic exams determined that 
pigmentation of the skin and in the ey e (particularly , the iris and fundus ) of the dog 
appeared unaffected.

EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
26
Other effects of venetoclax included single cell necrosis in various epithelial tissues in 
dogs (i.e., gallbladder, stomach, exocrine pancreas, and epididymides) that was of 
minimal magnitude and produced no loss of mucosa l integrit y; and increased pigment in 
Kupffer cells or macrophages in the liver and gallbladder of dogs.  None of the effects 
were considered to be adverse, and all were reversible.
Dogs at the high dose of 150 mg/kg/day  in the 4 -week stud y had clinical si gns of swelling 
of the skin on the ears, head (cranial area), and forepaws and/or hindpaws.  Most but not 
all animals (8 of 10 dogs) were affected.  The clinical signs were mild to moderate in 
severit y, transient and sporadic in occurrence, and were absent during the recovery period.  
The swelling reactions were observed after the first dose in 3 dogs, and therefore not 
consistent with drug -induced immediate (IgE -mediated, Ty pe I) h ypersensitivity ; 
however, other immune -mediated mechanisms could be involved.  Although the basis for 
the swelling reactions was not established, there were no signs of anaph ylaxis.  Clinical 
signs of swelling were not observed at the lower dosages of venetoclax evaluated in 
chronic toxicity  studies in mice or dogs.  Any  occurrences of swelling reactions in 
subjects can be monitored and treated.
There was no evidence of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity  of venetoclax.
Venetoclax was tested in a battery  of safet y pharmacology  assay s, and produced no 
effects in the CNS/neurobehavi oral or respiratory  studies in mice at oral doses up to and 
including the highest dose of 600 mg/kg.  No effects on corrected QT interval (QTc) were 
observed up to a maximum plasma concentration of 46 µg/mL in dogs.  In conscious 
dogs, venetoclax did not p roduce an y cardiovascular effects up to and including the 
highest oral dose of 150 mg/kg (maximum observed plasma concentration, 
Cmax=16µg/mL ).  In the anesthetized dog at higher plasma concentrations, venetoclax 
produced mild reductions in my ocardial c ontractility  (–6% to – 13%) and cardiac output 
(–11% to – 19%) at plasma concentrations of ≥ 16 µg/mL  and ≥ 32 µg/mL, respectivel y.  
These concentrations are greater than the plasma concentration of venetoclax in oncology 
subjects (e.g., 2.18 µg/mL at the 4 00 mg dose).

27
On the basis of nonclinical safet y pharmacology and toxicology evaluations of 
venetoclax, and on the basis of nonclinical and human studies of related antiapoptotic 
Bcl-2 family  protein inhibitors, potential mechanism -based toxicities may  include 
lymphopenia and neutropenia,14signs of tumor ly sis, reduction in red cell mass, decreased 
sperma togenesis, skin swelling and hair h ypopigmentation.  The potential for 
development of hair color change in humans is unknown.  No adverse events of changes 
in hair color, skin pigmentation, or eye color have been reported in the venetoclax clinical 
studies to date.  Although no effects of venetoclax on female reproductive tissues have 
been observed in general repeat -dose toxicology  studies, embry ofetal toxicity  studies in 
animals have identified a fetal toxicity  risk.
Thrombocy topenia has not been observed in toxicology  studies in mice and dogs.  These 
findings are consistent with venetoclax as a Bcl -2 specific (Bcl -xL sparing) inhibitor.  
Consequently , thrombocy topenia is not expected to be a dose limiting toxicity  (DLT) 
clinically .
In vitro studies have sh own that venetoclax is metabolized primarily  by CYP3A4; thus, 
coadministration of venetoclax with drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (such as ketoconazole) is 
predicted to cause a significant increase in the exposure of venetoclax and will be 
undertaken with dose m odifications as outlined in Section 5.2.4.4 .
A detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicology, metabolism, and pharmacology  can 
be found in the Investigator's Brochure.15-17,29
Venetoclax Clinical Data
Venetoclax is being investigated in Phase 1 to Phase 3 clinical oncology studies 
conducted as monotherapy or in combination with a variet y of compounds for the 
treatment of hematologic malignancies including MM, chronic l ymphocy tic leukemia 
(CLL), small ly mphocy tic leukemia (SLL), NHL, acute m yeloid leukemia (AML), and 
myelodysplastic s yndrome (MDS).  Data are available from drug -drug interaction studies

of venetoclax and ketoconazole, rifampin, and warfarin digoxin, ritonavir, and 
azythrom ycin.
As of 28 November 2018, on the basis of open -label and unblinded data available in the 
clinical databases for company -sponsored studies with unblinded data in the venetoclax 
oncology  development program, a total of 2543 adult subjects (1313 CLL/SLL, 
361AML , 218 MM, 570 NHL, and 59 MDS, 20 ALL, 1 rhabdom yocarcoma, and 1 Evans 
tumor) in the pooled analysis dataset across all monotherap y and combination therap y 
oncology  studies in the venetoclax development program have been exposed to at least 
1 dose of venetoclax.  An additional 20 pediatric subjects (< 18 y ears of age; 5 ALL, 
10AML , 3 neuroblastoma, 2 other solid tumors) have been exposed to at least 1 dose of 
venetoclax. 
Overall for MM, when treated with venetoclax as a single agent or in combination with 
other therapies, most subjects experience at least 1 adverse event.  Overall 78% of 
subjects experience ≥ grade 3 adverse events, and the most common events were 
cytopenias.  Forty -four percent (44%) of subjects experienced SAEs.  Findings from the 
analysis based on the FAIRs were consistent with the findings from the analy sis based on 
the subject incidence rates.  All of the adverse events reported in the current MM studies 
are consistent with underly ing disease or concomitant medical conditions, as well as other 
combination agents used to treat MM patients.  Neutropenia and infections reported in 
subjects with MM treated with venetoclax are consistent with the expected safet y profile 
of venetoclax.
A detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicology ,metabolism, and pharmacology  of 
venetoclax can be found in the I nvestigator's Brochure.15-17,29  
The BELLIN I stud y, a global, Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind study  of 
bortezomib and dexamethasone in combination with either venetoclax or placebo in 
subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who are sensitive or naïve to 
proteasome inhibitors, was unblinded as per protocol for the final anal ysis of the primary  
efficacy  endpoint.  As of the data cutoff date of 26 November 2018, 194 patients were  
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
29
randomized to the venetoclax arm, and 97 to the placebo arm (2:1 randomization).  The 
BELLIN I stud y met its primary endpoint of progression -free survival (22.4 versus 
11.5 months, HR 0.63, 95% CI :  0.44 –0.90) and showed statistically  significant 
improvements in ORR (82% vs 68%) and VGPR or better (59% vs 36%) in the 
venetoclax arm compared to the control arm.  However, there were 51 deaths in the safety 
analysis set, 40 (20.7%) in the venetoclax arm and 11 (11.5%) in the placebo arm (the 
median OS ha s not been reached in either arm).  The imbalance was predominantly  seen 
in the treatment -emergent deaths, which are those occurring on therap y or within 30 days 
after the last dose of therapy.  Among the 14 treatment -emergent deaths reported, 
13(6.7%) were in the venetoclax arm and 1 (1.0%) in placebo arm.  Of the 13 treatment -
emergent deaths on the venetoclax arm, 8 were attributed by  investigator to an event of 
infection, more than half of them also in the setting of refractory or progressive disease.  
Although the majorit y of infection -related deaths occurred within 180 day s of starting 
study  treatment, some have occurred later, even after a y ear or more on treatment.  A 
higher rate of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was seen in the venetoclax arm compared to 
placebo, but an association of infection -related deaths with neutropenia has not been 
established at this point.  Among the 37 non -treatment emergent deaths (those occurring 
more than 30 day s after the last dose of stud y treatment), 27 (14.0%) were in the 
venetoclax arm (6 of them attributed to infection, 3.1%), and 10 (10.4%) in the placebo 
arm (2 of them attributed to infection, 2.1%).  After the data cutoff of 26 November 2018, 
additional deaths were reported in the BELLINI trial.  As of 01 March 2019, t here were 
65deaths in the safet y analy sis set, 48 (24.7%) in Venetoclax arm and 17 (17.5%) in the 
placebo arm.

(including clinical data with venetoclax in multiple myeloma ) can be found in the most 
current version of the Investigator 's Brochure.
Venetoclax and Dexamethasone Combination
Preclinical data support study ing venetoclax in relapsed or refractory  MM subjects, in 
particular, those with a Bcl -2 profile (high Bcl -2/low Mcl -1) which is more frequentl y  
Venetoclax (ABT -199)

observed in MM bearing the t(11;14) translocation.8  Noteworthy , recent published data 
also demonstrate that dexamethasone highl y sensitizes multiple myeloma cell lines and 
primary  samples to venetoclax by  increasing Bim and Bcl -2 expression.  Dexamethasone 
appears to shift Bim binding towards Bcl -2 instead of Mcl -1 result ing in increased 
sensitivity  to venetoclax, even in cell lines with prior resistance to Bcl -2 inhibition.18  The 
addition of dexamethasone to venetoclax could be clinically beneficial for subjects with 
multiple my eloma expressing higher levels of resistance factors such as Mcl -1.
All information related to the venetoclax clinical pharmacology  and clinical data 
(including clinical data with venetoclax in multiple myeloma) can be found in the most 
current version of the Investigator 's Brochure .
3.4 Benefits and Risks
Based on data available, there is observed anti -tumor activity  in hematological 
malignancies (suc h as CLL, NHL, AML and MM) subjects receiving venetoclax.  I n 
addition, the safet y profile is acceptable in treating advanced cancer patients.  Ongoing 
monitoring for safet y will continue as outlined in the Risk Assessment.  Therefore, the 
overall risk ben efit profile supports further investigation of venetoclax in cancer patients.
Based on supportive safety  and efficacy  data from ongoing Phase 1/2 studies when treated 
with venetoclax as a single agent or in combination with other therapies, subjects enroll ed 
in this study  are anticipated to benefit from the combined treatment with dexamethasone 
based on their pro- apoptotic effects in my eloma cells.
Since the antitumorigenic effects of venetoclax and dexamethasone on myeloma cells are 
via distinctive mechani sms of action, the combination of these 2 drugs is anticipated to 
result in an enhanced therapeutic effect that could potentially  benefit patients with MM.  
The goal of the Phase 2 portion of the study is to determine the efficacy and safet y profile 
of ven etoclax and dexamethasone combination therap y in patients with t(11;14) -positive 
MM.

Following the anal ysis of the BELLINI study  (see Section 3.3) guidance for dos e 
interruption/reduction following a Grade ≥ 3 or serious infection in subjects receiving 
venetoclax have been implemented (Section 6.1.8.3 and Section 6.1.8.4 )
The safet y profile of venetoclax as a monotherap y or in combination with dexamethasone 
in patients with R/R MM has been favorable and consistent with its mechanism of act ion 
and the background disease in this population.  Based on nonclinical toxicology and 
clinical studies with venetoclax, toxicities may  include ly mphopenia, neutropenia, 
thrombocy topenia, anemia, and gastrointestinal adverse events.  The safet y and effica cy 
data to date of venetoclax in combination with dexamethasone from the Phase 1 portion of 
the study  supports further evaluation of this combination in subjects with R/R MM.
For further details on venetoclax, please see findings from completed studies inc luding 
safet y data in the most current venetoclax I nvestigator Brochure29and the dexamethasone 
package insert.
Based on the BELLINI data referenced above, the FDA placed Study M13 -367 on partial 
clinical hold on 14 March 2019.  A total of 117 subjects have been enrolled (Phase 1:  86; 
Phase 2:  31) to Study  M13 -367.  No new subjects will be enrolled into the 
Study M13 -367.  Subjects who are currently  receiving venetoclax monotherap y or 
venetoclax and dexamethasone in combination will be allowed to continue study 
treatment per protocol if the investigator believes the subject is continuing to receive 
clinical benefit.  For subjects who choose to continue study treatment, study procedures 
have been modified as described in Table 6 and throughout protocol.  Additionally , 
pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations requirements applic able for subjects on study  
treatment have been implemented , as well as recommendations for subjects in follow up
(please refer to S ection 5.2.4.1 ).
Considering the co ronavirus (COVID -19) pandemic, the benefit and risk to subjects 
participating in this study has been re -evaluated.  Subjects receiving venetoclax may be at 
an increased risk for COVID
-19 infection or experience serious illness if infected.  
Management of t hese adverse events will be made on a case -by-case basis with  
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
32
consideration of benefit/risk.  However, based on the population and disease being studied 
and the anticipation that COVID -19 related risks are not expected to differ substantially  
between study subjects and the broader population of subjects receiving treatment for R/R 
multiple my eloma, no change to the benefit/risk balance for subjects in this study is 
expected.
3.5 Differences Statement
One Phase 1 clinical trial investigating the safet y, pharmaco kinetics, maximum tolerated 
dose, and recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) of venetoclax monotherap y in subjects 
with relapsed or refractory chronic l ymphocy tic leukemia and non -Hodgkin's l ymphoma 
is underway .  This is the first Phase 1 protocol of venetoclax m onotherap y in subjects 
with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.  In addition, one Phase 1 clinical trial 
investigating the safet y, pharmacokinetics, maximum tolerated dose, and RPTD of 
venetoclax in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone as sta ndard therap y in 
subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma is underway.
4.0 Study  Objectives
Phase 1 Portion (Dose Escalation, Safet y Expansion and Venetoclax- Dexamethasone 
Combination): 
The primary  objectives are to assess the safet y profile, cha racterize pharmacokinetics 
(PK), determine the dosing schedule, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) of venetoclax monotherapy  when administered in 
subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.  This study will also assess the 
safet y profile and PK of venetoclax in combination with dexamethasone in subjects with 
t(11;14) -positive multiple my eloma.  The secondary  objectives are to evaluate the 
preliminary  efficacy  data regarding the effect of venetoclax monothera py or combined 
with dexamethasone on overall response rate (ORR), time to response (TTR), time to 
disease progression (TTP), and duration of response (DOR).

EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
33
The Phase 2 Portion (Venetoclax -Dexamethasone Expansion):
The primary  objective of the Phase 2 po rtion is to further evaluate the ORR and very  good 
partial response or better rate (VGPR+) in subjects with t(11;14)- positive multiple 
myeloma, with the secondary  objectives to monitor safety and evaluate progression -free 
survival (PFS), DOR, TTR, TTP, and overall survival (OS) and to evaluate patient 
reported outcomes (PRO) including Worst Pain (Brief Pain Inventory  –Short Form 
[BPI -SF]), Phy sical Functioning and Global Health Status (GHS)/Quality  of L ife (QoL) 
(European Organization for Research and Trea tment of Cancer Quality  of Life 
Questionnaire Core [EORTC QL Q-C30]), and Fatigue (Patient Reported Outcomes 
Measurement Information Sy stem [PROMI S] Cancer Fatigue Short Form [SF]).  The 
tertiary  objectives of the Phase 2 portion are to assess other PRO end points (remaining 
subscales/items from BPI -SF, EORTC QLQ- C30, European Organization for Research 
and Treatment of Cancer Quality  of Life Questionnaire Multiple My eloma Module 
[EORTC QLQ -MY20], and Euroqol EQ- 5D-5L).
The exploratory  objectives for all study portions are to evaluate pharmacody namic and 
predictive biomarkers for association with PK, safety, and efficacy .  In addition, minimal 
residual disease (MRD) will be assessed in the bone marrow b y next generation 
sequencing (NGS).
5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a Phase 1/2, open
-label, multicenter stud y evaluating the safet y and PK of 
venetoclax when administered in male and female subjects with relapsed or refractory 
MM.  The study  is designed to enroll approxima tely 166 –186 subjects.  Subjects in this 
study  will be enrolled at approximately  32 research sites globall y.  This study is 
sponsored by AbbVie in collaboration with Roche/Genentech.
This study  will consist of 2 distinct portions (Phase 1 and Phase 2).  The Phase 1 portion 
includes dose escalation, safet y expansion, and VenDex combination cohorts.  The  
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
34
firstcohort of the stud y will evaluate the safet y and pharmacokinetics profile of 
venetoclax, to be administered in approximately 30 subjects following a dose escalation 
scheme, with the objective of defining the dose limiting toxicity  (DLT) and the MTD.
The second cohort of the study  is a safet y expansion cohort that will further evaluate 
venetoclax safet y at the MTD (or RPTD) and explore Bcl -2 famil y expr ession profile in 
approximately  36 subjects.  
The third cohort of the study  is a (VenDex) combination cohort that will evaluate 
venetoclax safet y and efficacy at the RPTD in combination with dexamethasone in 
approximately  20 subjects with t(11;14) -positiv e MM.
The Phase 2 portion of the study is an expansion of the combination cohort that will 
further evaluate ORR and VGPR+ of venetoclax and dexamethasone in approximately  
80–100relapsed or refractory subjects with t(11;14) -positive MM.  Disease assessmen t 
for each post -baseline IMWG assessment will be performed b y the investigator.
The overall study  design is shown in Figure 1.

dose level of 300 mg.  Subjects will continue to receive the same starting dose of 
Venetoclax once daily  for 1 week starting on Lead -in Day  1.  If, after approximately  
1week, subjects have absence or resolution of metabolic abnormalities comprising TL S 
and do not experience a DL T (refer to Section 6.1.8.1 ), the dose level will be subsequentl y
increased in increments anticipated to be at least 50 mg per week until the designated 
cohort dose level is achieved.  The decision to escalate will be made b y AbbVie following 
discussion between the investigator and the AbbVie TA MD.
In the first dose es calation cohort, the Lead- in Day  1 dose for the second subject will not 
be administered until at least 1 week following the Lead -in Day  1 dose of the first subject.  
Staggered enrollment may continue for subsequent cohorts if decided b y AbbVie, 
following d iscussion between the investigators and the AbbVie TA MD.
Each dose of venetoclax will be taken orall y with approximately  240 mL of water within 
30 minutes after the completion of a low -fat breakfast.
On day s that pre -dose PK sampling is required, venetocl ax dosing will occur in the clinic 
to facilitate PK sampling following the completion of a low -fat breakfast.  For subjects in 
the Dose Escalation cohorts, dosing will occur in the clinic to facilitate PK sampling 
following the completion of a standard low-fat breakfast on the intensive PK day , 
Cycle2 Day  1.
Dose Modification and Escalation Guidelines
In subsequent cohorts, modifications in the lead -in period may  occur based on tolerability .  
Increases or decreases in the lead -in period starting dose and/o r changes in the dosing 
increments may  be implemented.  For example, the starting dose of 50 mg in subsequent 
cohorts may  be lowered; dose escalation may  then occur in smaller increments.  The 
lead-in period may  be eliminated if clinically  significant metabolic abnormalities of TL S 
are not observed.  Decisions to modify  the lead -in period will be made b y AbbVie 
following discussion between the investigators and AbbVie TA MD.  Lead -in doses to the 
designated cohort doses for Cohorts 1 to 3 are depicted in Table 1.

* Starting dose and/or Step 2 may be removed in cohorts subsequent to Cohort 1 if no metabolic abnormalities of 
TLS are observed in the prior cohort.
** Higher starting dose would only occur if metabolic abnormalities of TLS are not observed at lower doses.
A lower starting dose and/or modifications to the lead -in regimen may  be implemented for 
individual subject(s) at particularl y high risk for TLS (refe r to Management of Tumor 
Lysis Sy ndrome, Section 6.1.8.4 ).  The decision to modify  the lead -in period dosing 
regimen for an individual subject will be made b y AbbVie following discussion between 
the investigator and AbbVie TA MD and communicated to the IRB/EC, as appropriate.
Designated cohort dose escalation or de -escalation decisions to the next designated cohort 
dose will be made after subjects hav e completed the lead -in period plus one cy cle 
(21days) at the designated cohort dose.  Escalation of designated cohort dose will occur 
in multiples of 100 mg but may  occur in other increments as determined by  available data.  
De-escalation will occur in i ncrements of 50 mg unless data indicate other increments are 
required.  Decisions will be informed b y subject tolerability and safet y data.  Escalation or 
de-escalation of the designated cohort dose will be determined b y AbbVie following 
discussion between the investigators and AbbVie TA MD.
A minimum of 3 subjects will be enrolled per cohort.  Additional subjects may be enrolled 
at a current dose level at the discretion of the AbbVie medical monitor.  Dose escalation 
decisions may  be made following the com pletion of the lead -in period (if applicable) plus 
one cy cle (21 day s) of dosing at the designated cohort dose for the subjects in the intended 
cohort (e.g., first three evaluable).  Available data from all subjects receiving stud y drug 
will be considered in dose escalation decisions.  Adverse events occurring after this 
defined period and PK assessment may also be considered in dose escalation decisions. 
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
38
If continuous dosing is not feasible, a lower dose or alternative dosing schedules may be 
employ ed.  Al ternative doses and schedules will be determined after discussions between 
the investigators and the AbbVie TA MD, based on factors such as pharmacokinetic data, 
recovery  periods for observed DLTs and toxicity  data.
Escalation of venetoclax to the next des ignated cohort dose level will proceed if all 
assigned subjects in the intended cohort (e.g., first three evaluable) complete the lead -in 
period plus one cy cle (21 day s) at the designated cohort dose without experiencing a DLT 
(refer to Section 6.1.8.1 ).  If one (1) subject within any  dose level experiences a DLT, up 
to 6 subjects will be enrolled at that dose level.  Additional subjects may be enrolled at the 
current dose level at the discretion of the AbbVie TA MD.  If < 33% of the subjects 
enrolled at a dose level experience a DLT, then escalation of the designated cohort dose 
may continue.  If ≥33% of the subjects enrolled at a dose level experien ce a DLT, dose 
escalation will stop and the previous lead -in period and designated cohort dosing regimen 
will be considered the MTD or dose de -escalation of the designated cohort dose, and/or a 
modified lead- in period may  be explored if MTD is not declared .
Dose escalation guidelines are summarized in Table 2.
Table 2. Dose Escalation Guidelines

Note: If a DLT of TLS occurs during the lead -in period, it will affect dosing decisions in the lead -in period.  
(Refer to Section 6.1.8.1 , Definition – Dose Limiting Toxicity).
If dose de -escalation or modification of the lead -in period occur and < 33% of subjects 
enrolled experience a DLT at the reduced designated cohort dose and/or the modified 
lead-in period regimen, this dosing regimen will be declare d the MTD.  If ≥ 33% of the 
subjects enrolled at the reduced designated cohort dose and/or the modified lead- in period

39
regimen still experience a DLT, dose de -escalation of the designated cohort dose and/or 
modified lead- in period regimen will continue to be explored.
The MTD will be defined as the highest designated cohort dose level (and corresponding 
lead-in period regimen, if applicable) at which < 33% of the subjects enrolled experience 
a DLT.
Transition from Dose Escalation to Safety Expansion Portion
Once the MTD is determined, enrollment into the dose escalation portion of the study will 
end.  The dose level for the safet y expansion portion will be communicated to all 
participating investigators prior to the start of enrollment.  Subjects from the do se 
escalation portion of the study  are not eligible for enrollment in the safet y expansion 
portion of the study .
Safety Expansion Cohort
Once the MTD is declared, a cohort of approximately  36 additional subjects with relapsed 
or refractory  MM will be enrol led at the MTD, or RPTD, in order to further define the 
toxicity  profile and better inform the RPTD determination for subjects with MM.  I t is 
expected, based on a prevalence rate of about 40%, that approximately  14 of 36 subjects 
will overexpress Bcl -2 and have low Bcl -xL.
To mitigate the risk for TLS observed, subjects will receive TLS proph ylaxis prior to and 
during treatment (refer to Management of Tumor Ly sis Sy ndrome, Section 6.1.8.4 ).  TL S 
prophy laxis and subject management guidelines may  be modified or removed based on 
results from the dose escalation portion.
The dosing schedule for the safet y expansion cohort, if a lead -in period is required , is 
depicted in Figure 3.  The dosing schedule for the safet y expansion portion, if a lead -in 
period is not required, is depicted in Figure 4.

If, during the safety expansion cohort of the study, toxicities are observed during the 
lead-in period (if applicable) plus one cy cle (21 day s) at the designated cohort dose at a 
frequency  higher than the definition of MTD (> 33%), a lower dose or alternative dosing 
schedules may  be examined.  The alternative dose and schedule will be determined by  
AbbVie after discussion between the inve stigators and the AbbVie TA MD.
During the dose escalation and safet y expansion cohorts, upon assessment of progressive 
disease and discussion with AbbVie TA MD, the investigator may  add dexamethasone 
treatment starting at 40 mg (PO) orall y on Days 1, 8, a nd 15 of each 21 -day cycle per the 
dexamethasone prescribing information.  All subjects who are ≥ 75 y ears old may  start 
dexamethasone at a 20 mg dose.

Intrasubject Dose Escalation
During the dose escalation cohort, in order to maximize the collection of i nformation at 
relevant doses and to minimize the exposure of individuals to suboptimal doses, subjects 
may progressivel y escalate their current dose to the highest cleared venetoclax dose level 
or an y dose below.  Individuals will need to complete at least 2 cycles at their designated 
cohort dose (or current dose) level prior to an y escalation as determined by investigator 
and the AbbVie TA MD.
TLS prophy laxis and management will be implemented at each dose escalation.  For 
subjects who dose escalate.  TL S proph ylaxis and management will be discussed between 
the AbbVie TA MD and investigator.  Refer to Section 6.1.8.4 Management of Tumor 
Lysis Sy ndrom e for additional information.
Venetoclax- Dexamethasone Combination Cohort
The combination cohort will explore the safety and efficacy  of venetoclax in combination 
with dexamethasone in approximately 20 subjects with t(11;14) -positive MM.  Subjects 
will rec eive venetoclax daily  (Day 1 –21) at the RPTD with dexamethasone (40 mg PO) 
on Day s 1, 8, and 15 of each 21 -day cycle, per the dexamethasone prescribing 
information.  All subjects who are ≥ 75 years old may  start dexamethasone at a 20 mg 
dose.
During the V enDex combination cohort, a lead -in period will not be employed.  The 
dosing schedule for the VenDex combination portion is depicted in Figure 5.

Phase 2 Portion:
The Phase 2 cohort will further explore the efficacy of venetoclax in combination with 
dexamethasone in approximately  80 –100 relapsed or refractory  subjects with t(11;14) -
positive MM.  Subjects will receive venetoclax daily (Day 1 –21) with dexamethasone 
orally  Day 1, 8, and 15 per the prescribing information.  
Subjects enrolled in the VenDex combination and Phase 2 cohorts may  discon tinue 
dexamethasone due to toxicity  or intolerability , and may  continue receiving venetoclax 
once dail y as monotherapy.  Subjects will continue study treatment until the end of the 
study  provided they  continue to tolerate venetoclax, have no evidence of di sease 
progression, and do not meet an y criteria for subject discontinuation (Section 5.4.1).
Option to Continue Venetoclax Treatment
All subjects will continue receiving stud y drug until the end of study provided they 
continue to tolerate venetoclax, have no evidence of disease progression and do not meet 
any of the criteria for subject discontinuation (Section 5.4.1).

5.2.3 Determination of the Number of Prior Lines of Therapy  and 
Refractoriness to Prior Therapies
A line of therap y consists of at least: 
●1 complete cy cle of a single agent; or
●A regimen consisting of combination of several drugs; or
●A planned sequential therap y of various regimens.20
A treatment is considered a new line of therap y if any of the following 3 conditions are 
met:
●Start of a new line of treatment after discontinuation of a previous line: If a 
treatment regimen is discontinued for an y reason and a different regimen is 
started, it should be considered a new line of therapy.  A regimen is considered 
to have been dis continued if all the drugs in that given regimen have been 
stopped.  A regime n is not considered to have been discontinued if only  some 
of the drugs of the regimen, but not all, have been discontinued.
●The unplanned addition or substitution of 1 or more drugs in an existing 
regimen:  Unplanned addition of a new drug or switching to a different drug 
(or combination of drugs) due to an y reason is considered a new line of 
therap y.
●Stem Cell Transplant (SCT):  I n patients undergoing > 1 SCT, except in the 
case of a planned tandem SCT with a predefined interval (such as 3 months), 
each S CT (autologous or allogeneic) should be considered a new line of 
therap y regardless of whether th e conditioning regimen used is the same or 
different.  Data on t ype of SCT should also be captured.

designee (refer to Section 7.0), the subject may  initiate or continue with 
protocol therap y without interruption dur ing the course of palliative 
radiation therap y if the Investigator believes that the risk of excessive bone 
marrow suppression or other toxicity  is acceptable, and it is in the best 
interest of the subject to do so.
○If the subject develops a definite incre ase in the size of existing bone 
lesions or soft tissue plasmacy tomas that meets the criteria for progressive 
disease, treatment must be discontinued for progressive disease regardless 
of whether radiation therapy is initiated.
○Kyphoplast y, vertebroplasty, or emergency  orthopedic surgery is

If the investigator determines that such a medication is medically necessary, the 
investigator will notify  the AbbVie TA MD and discuss the investigator's use of these 
medications and the investigator's plans to medically  monitor the potential study  subject 
under consideration.
5.2.4.4 Dose Modifications for Moderate and Strong CYP3A  
Inhibitors Used with Venetoclax
Use of venetoclax with moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided and the 
investigator should consider alte rnative medications.  If the administration of a moderate 
or strong CYP3A is necessary  based on the investigator's clinical judgment, then 
venetoclax dose should be reduced during the period it is co- administered with a moderate 
or strong CYP3A inhibitors.   Dose reductions for venetoclax dose levels used with 
moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors are provided on Table 4.  Subjects should be 
monitored more closely for signs of toxicities and the dose may need to be further 
reduced.  Guidelines in Table 18, Table 19and Table 20should also be followed for 
venetocla x-toxicity  related dose reductions when moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors 
are concomitantly  administered.  After discontinuation of CYP3A inhibitor, wait for 3 
days before venetoclax dose is increased back to previous dose level.

Patient -Reported Outcome (PRO) Assessments (Phase 2 Portion Only)
PRO assessments include BPI -SF, EORTC QLQ -C30, EORTC QL C MY20, PROMI S 
Cancer Fatigue SF, and EQ -5D-5L.  These assessments will be collected per Table 6and 
Table 7throughout the trial.  Subjects may  complete all baseline PRO assessments within 
72 hours prior to the first dose of venetoclax.  I t is required that PRO assessments be 
completed prior to an y other clinical assessments and prior to dosing for subsequent cycle 
visits.  With the implementation of Protocol Amendment 10 PRO Assessments will no 
longer be collected.
BPI-SF
The BPI -SF is a pain- specific measure developed to assess patient- reported severit y (or 
intensity ) of pain (4 items) and the impact of pain on daily functioning (7 items) in 
patients with cancer pain.32  The four pain severit y items assess pain at its "worst," "least," 
"average," and "now" (current pain).  For these items, patients are asked to rate their pain 
on an 11 -point num eric rating scale with anchors of 0 (no pain) and 10 (pain as bad as you 
can imagine).  The BPI "worst" pain severit y item has been shown to be reliable and valid 
for use as a single item.33  The BPI -SF also includes questions to measure the interference 
of pain in the patient's daily  life, including general activity , mood, ability  to walk, normal 
work bo th outside the home and housework, relations to other people, sleep, as well as 
enjoy ment of life.  For these items, patients are asked to describe the extent to which pain 
has interfered on an 11 -point numeric rating scale with anchors of 0 (does not inte rfere) to 
10 (completel y interferes).

EORTC QLQ -C30
HRQoL  and sy mptoms will be assessed with the EORTC -QLQ- C30 version 3.34  The 
QLQ- C30 is a 30- item subject self report questionnaire composed of both multi -item and 
single scales, including five functional scales (ph ysical, role, emotional, social, and 
cognitive), three s ymptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), a global health 
status/quality  of life scale, and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, 
constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties).  Subjects rate items on a four -point 
scale, with 1 as "not at all" and 4 as "ver y much."  The QLQ -C30 was developed and 
validated for use in a cancer patient population, and its reliability  and validity  is highl y 
consistent across different language cultural groups.
EORTC QLQ -MY20
The EORTC QLQ -MY20 was developed as an additional modu le for the QLQ -C30 and is 
composed of 20 multiple my eloma specific items.35  The QL Q
-MY20 includes scales for 
disease s ymptoms, side effects of treatment, future perspective, and bod y image.  Values 
for each scale range from 0 to 100.  Subjects rate items on a four -point scale, with 1 as 
"not at all" and 4 as "very much."  The QL Q-MY20 is a reliable and valid instrument for 
measuring quality  of life in my eloma patients.
PROMIS Cancer Fatigue SF
The PROMI S®is a s ystem of highl y reliable, precise measures of patient -reported health 
status for phy sical, mental, and social well -being .36  PROMI S instruments measure 
concepts such as pain, fatigue, ph ysical function, depression, anxiety and social function.  
Fatigue will be assessed using the PROMI
S Cancer Fatigue SF that has been developed 
for use in oncology  populations.37,38  PROMI S Cancer Fatigue SF is a seven item 
questionnaire th at assesses the impact and experience of fatigue over the past 7 days.  All 
questions employ  the following five response options:  1 = Not at all, 2 = A little bit, 
3 =Somewhat, 4 = Quite a bit, and 5 = Very  much.

EQ-5D-5L
The EQ -5D-5L is a generic preference instrument that has been validated in numerous 
populations.39  The EQ -5D-5L has five dimensions:   mobility , self care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort and anxiety /depression.  These dimensions are measured on a five level 
scale:  no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme 
problems.  The EQ -5D-5L also contains a visual analog scale (VAS) to assess the 
subject's overall health.

termination of subjects from the study .  The local reader will write on the ECG tracing 
global interpretation as either:
●normal ECG
●abnormal ECG -not clinically  significant
●abnormal ECG -clinically  significant
●unable to evaluate
The reader will then sign and date the ECG.  An y reports that are abnormal clinically 
significant will be faxed to the Oncology  Safet y Management Team via the contact 
information provided in Section 6.1.6 within 5 business day s.  The corrected QT interval 
measurement (Bazett QTcB) will be documented in the eCRF only if the local reader 
selects the "prolonged QT" box for an abnormal ECG.  Correction b y the Bazett formula 
(QTcB) is suggested for logistical reasons and for consistency  across sites; however, 
correction by  other methods may  be acceptable based on consultation with AbbVie TA 
MD.  A cop y of an y other ECGs will sent to AbbVie, if reque sted.  The original ECG 
tracing will be retained in the subject's records at the study site.
COVID- 19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
In the event the ECG cannot be performed at the study  site due to stud y modifications 
related to the CO VID-19 pandemic, the ECG may  be completed at other centers providing 
the modality /technique is equivalent.
Multiple Gated Acquisition Scan (MUGA)
A MUGA scan will be performed according to Table 5, as applicable.
If a MUGA scan cannot be performed, a 2D echocardiogram with doppler may  be 
performed.  Subjects may  have either a MUGA or echocardiogram performed; however, 
MUGA is the preferred method and it is preferred that the same method of assessment 
(MUGA or 2D echocardiogram) is used throughout the study  for a given subject.  A 
MUGA scan (or 2D echocardiogram) is not required for the Phase 2 portion.

applicable), skeletal survey , and bone marrow aspirate and biops y, will be utilized for 
disease assessment.  Subjects will be evaluated against the I nternational My eloma 
Working Group (IMWG)23-25,30criteria for disease response.
Disease assessments will be performed and s ubmitted to the central laboratory for 
reporting according to Table 5, Table 6, and Table 7as applicable.  Phase 2 subjects must
have all IMWG response assessments based on the central laboratory  results.
Response criteria definitions are outlined in Appendix E.
All response categories (i.e., sCR, CR, VGPR, PR, MR, and PD) require 2 consecutive 
assessments for confirmation made at an y time before declaring response/PD and the 
institution of any  new therapy  (no minimum interval between the 2 consecutive 
assessments is required, and the assessments can be done the same day).  However, 
to confirm response or PD, 2 discrete samples are required and testing cannot be 
based upon the splitting of a single sample.   
Only  one bone marrow assessment is 
required.  All response categories sCR, CR, VGPR, PR, MR, and SD also require no 
known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were 
performed.  Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements, 
unless plasmacy toma is presen t at baseline.  An y soft tissue plasmacy toma documented at 
baseline must undergo serial monitoring as per Table 5, Table 6, and Table 7.
The following laboratory tests are required for the assessment of disease response and 
may be performed up to 1 week prior to the scheduled assessment visit day.
Serum Protein Immunofixation, Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPEP)
Blood samples for serum protein immunofixation and SPEP testing will be collected for 
all subjects according to Table 14and Table 15as applicable.
Serum Quantitative Immunoglobuli ns (sQI)

Serum Free Light Chains (sFLC)
Blood samples for serum free light chain testing will be collected for all subjects 
according to Table 14and Table 15as applicable.
Subjects with measurable disease in either SPEP and/or U PEP will be assessed for 
response onl y based on these two tests and not by the FLC assay.  FLC response criteria 
are onl y applicable to subjects without measurable disease in the serum or urine and to 
fulfill the requirements of sCR.
Urine Protein Immunofi xation and Urine Protein Electrophoresis (UPEP), 24 -hr 
Urine
24-hr urine samples for urine protein immunofixation and UPEP testing will be collected 
for all subjects according to Table 14and Table 15as applicable.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
If travel restrictions or other changes in local regulations in light of the COVID -19 
pandemic prevent the subject from having blood drawn for laboratory  testing at the stud y 
site, if possible, arrange for subjects to have laboratory work done at a local lab, hospital, 
or other fac ility.  Local lab results should be obtained along with reference ranges and 
kept within the subjects' source documentation.  Local lab results should be reviewed b y 
the investigator as soon as possible .
Skeletal Survey
A skeletal survey  will be comprised of the following:
●Lateral radiograph of skull
●Antero -posterior and lateral views of the spine
●Antero -posterior views of pelvis, ribs, femora, tibiae, fibulae, humeri, ulnae 
and radii

In the event the skeletal survey  cannot be performed at the study  site due to study  
modifications related to the COVID -19 pandemic, the skeletal survey  may  be completed 
at other centers providing the modalit y/technique is equivalent.
Plasmacytoma Evaluation
Plasmacy toma evaluation via phy sical examination or radiography (if clinically  indicated) 
should be completed according to Table 5, Table 6, and Table 7as applicable:
Plasmacy toma evaluations may be performed within 72 hours before or after the visit day .  
The frequency  of plasmacy toma evaluation by  radiograph y may be altered per discussion 
between the investigator and AbbVie TA MD.

Bone Marrow Asp irate and Biopsy
Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy  should be completed according to Table 5, Table 6, 
Table 7, Table 9and Tab le10, as applicable.
Due to differences in bone marrow core biops y collection procedures between the sites in 
the US and France, the core biopsy collection will be considered an optional procedure for 
subjects enrolled in France during the dose esc alation portion.  During the safet y 
expansion and VenDex combination, the core biopsy  collection is required for all sites 
(US and France).  During the Phase 2 cohort, the core biopsy will be collected per 
Section 5.3.1.5 .
All aspirate collections are required.  Bone marrow aspirates and biopsies performed as 
standard of care throughout the study  should also be captured on an eCRF. 
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
91
A sufficient bone marrow aspirate or biopsy  must be collected for clinical assessment 
(pathology , plasma cell % and kappa (κ)/lambda (λ) for clonalit y) performed by a local 
laboratory  as well as for shipment of a portion to AbbVie (or designee) for the biomarker 
analyses (refer to Section 5.3.6).  Samples should be assessed for IMWG first and then 
split for biomarker analysis.
Assessment of bone marrow for percentage of plasma cells is required within 21 day s 
before first dose of stud y drug, for baseline assessment (screening visit) and while on 
study  to confirm CR (i.e., subjects who become immunofixation negative) or at time of 
suspected disease progression, if clinically  indicated.
Bone marrow plasma cell clonality  must also be evaluated at the time of CR (< 5% 
plasma cells) to assess for sCR, if applicable.  Flow cy tometry  is preferred over 
immunohistochemistry  (IHC) for assessment of clonality  by kappa (κ) and lambda (λ) 
staining.   Flow cy tometry  will be performed onl y to assess for sCR locally  per institution 
standard practice.  If local flow cytometry to assess clonality is not available at the time of 
CR, a core biops y and/or clot section should be evaluated b y IHC staining for kappa (κ) or 
lambda (λ) or light chain restriction.  To confirm a CR, a second confirmation bone 
marrow anal ysis for CR is not needed.
A bone marrow aspirate collection is mandatory  at screening and to confirm sCR/CR.  At 
screening, fresh samples should be obtained within 21 day s of first dose of study , and, 
when possible, should be obtained after all other eligibility  criteria have been met.  For 
Phase 2, a bone marrow aspirate is optional at time of study drug discontinuation or 
disease progression.
Bone marrow core biopsy  (fixed formalin paraffin embedded [FFPE] core) should be also 
collected, unless not recommended per institutional guidelines.  However, a bone marrow 
biopsy  is mandatory  in the circumstance that an aspirate sample is not available (e.g., due 
to a dry  tap).  Fresh biopsies are preferred but archived tissue is acceptable if 
representative of current disease and if collected within the previous 12 weeks without 
intervening treatment.  Core block or tissue slides are acceptable.  Bone marrow core

COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
If travel restr ictions or other changes in local regulations in light of the COVID -19 
pandemic prevent the subject from visiting the study  site for the collection and shipping of 
IMWG laboratory  assessments to the central laboratory, a local laboratory, hospital, or  
Venetoclax (ABT -199)

other facility  may  be used to manage subject disease assessment of IMWG (Serum M -
Protein, Urine M -Protein, Serum Free Light Chains, Serum quantitative 
immunoglobulins).  L ocal lab results should be obtained along with reference ranges and 
kept within the subje cts'source documentation.  Local lab results should be reviewed b y 
the investigator as soon as possible. For Phase 1 subjects local IMWG assessments are 
allowable per protocol prior to the COVID- 19 Pandemic.
TLS Prophylaxis
TLS prophy laxis will be initia ted in all subjects starting 72 hours prior to the first dose of 
venetoclax, prior to each dose escalation of venetoclax, and prior to the first dose of 
venetoclax with dexamethasone, per the guidelines in Section 6.1.8.4 .
Subject Diaries
Subject diaries will be provided at Lead -in Day  1 (if applicable), weekly  throughout 
Lead -in period (if applicable), C ycle 1 Day 1, and Day 1 of each cy cle thereafter.
Subjects will be instructed to record the date and time each dose of stud y drug is taken 
(indicating if an y doses of study drug are missed) and time of breakfast completion.  The 
date and time (to the nearest minute) of each study drug taken an d whether or not the dose 
was taken within 30 minutes after completing breakfast will be recorded on the eCRF on 
the scheduled PK day s and for 2 day s prior to every  scheduled PK day .
Subjects will also be instructed to record adverse events and concomitant medications in 
the subject diaries.
Subject diaries should be reviewed at each stud y visit.  Subject diaries will be collected 
from subjects weekly  throughout the Lead -in period (if applicable) and on Day  1 of every  
cycle.  The diaries are to be returned to the site, reviewed b y stud y staff at visits where 
study  drug is dispensed to the subject, and appropriately  filed with the subject's source 
documents for this study . 
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38

Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, subject visits may  be conducted via phone or video 
confer ence.  In these situations, subject diaries canbe couriered to subjects along with 
study  drug. AEs, Concomitant medications and dosing compliance listed in the diaries 
shall be verball y shared with site if a phone or video conference visit occurs Diaries
should be returned to the study  site when the subject is able to visit the site next , and 
appropriatel y filed with the subject's source documents for this study.
Clinical Disease Progression Assessment
Subjects will be assessed for clinical disease progre ssion according to Table 5, Table 6, 
Table 7as applicable.  Two consecutive laboratory assessments for confirmation of PD 
made at an y time before the start of new therap y are required per IMWG cr iteria.  The 
second assessment may  be taken immediatel y if PD is suspected.  If PD is suspected b y 
rising serum or urine M -protein (or FL C in subjects without measurable disease), 
2consecutive assessments from laboratory readings should be obtained.
If PD is suspected b y clinical symptoms, a plasmacytoma evaluation and/or skeletal 
survey  should be obtained, as clinically indicated, and compared with baseline 
assessments to determine whether a new bone lesion or plasmacytoma has developed or 
an existing les ion or plasmacy toma has worsened.  SPEP and UPEP are also required.
The following assessments are not sufficient to determine PD:
●Rising serum FLC if disease is measurable in the serum, urine, or both.
○Serum FLC can be used to determine PD according to the IMWG criteria only for 
subjects without measurable serum and urine M -protein.
●Clinical relapse based on indicators that are not part of the IMWG criteria for 
PD (e.g., decrease in hemoglobin, hypercalcemia, increase in serum creatinine, 
hyperviscosity ), and relapse from CR should not be considered PD.
●General worsening of the subject's condition.  If a subject's condition has 
deteriorated to a point that remaining on protocol therap y is not an option, 
every  effort should be made to document PD b y at least one of the following  
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38

assessments prior to the initiation of new therap y:  SPEP, UPEP, bone marrow 
biopsy , plasmacy toma evaluation, or skeletal survey .
Investigators are requested not to discontinue subjects from treatment for presumed lack 
of response aft er onl y 1 cycle of stud y treatment.
Dexamethasone Dosing for PD Subjects During Dose Escalation and Safety 
Expansion Portions
Subjects enrolled to dose escalation and safet y expansion cohorts of the study, upon 
assessment of progressive disease per IMWG cr iteria and discussion with AbbVie TA 
MD, the investigator may  add dexamethasone treatment starting at 40 mg orally  on 
Days1, 8, and 15 of each 21 -day cycle per the dexamethasone prescribing information.  
All subjects who are ≥75 years old may  start dexam ethasone at a 20 mg dose.
Progressive Disease Assessment
Phase 2 cohort subjects that discontinue the study  treatment for reasons other than PD, 
even after receiving new anti -multiple my eloma treatment, will be assessed for disease 
progression (IMWG assess ment) every  4 weeks (± 1 week) for 1 y ear following the last 
dose of study  treatment, and then every  12 weeks (± 1 week) thereafter until PD.  After 
PD, the subject will continue to be followed for Overall Survival.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Pro tocol Modifications
In the event the subject cannot visit the study  site for central laboratory  and/or research 
sample collection for reasons related to the COVID -19 pandemic, a local accredited 
laboratory  may  be used to manage subject disease assessment.  Local lab results s hould be 
obtained along with reference ranges and kept within the subjects' source documentation.  
Local lab results should be reviewed b y the investigator as soon as possible.  Additionally, 
the study  site should contact the subject b y phone or video conf erence to assess for post -
study  myeloma therap y as per Table 7.  This discussion shall be documented in the source 
notes. 
Venetoclax (ABT -199)

101
Overall Survival Assessments
For the Phase 2 portion, after stud y treatment and at the time of disease progression, 
subjects will be followed for overall survival.  Survival information (i.e., the date, cause 
of death and an y relevant clinical information leading to death) and post -study myeloma 
therap y (i.e., transplantation, regimens, dates of initiation and completion, etc) will be 
collected every  12 weeks (± 2 weeks) (or as needed to allow for more frequent data 
collection) until death, or for 24 months after the last subject's fir st dose whichever occurs 
first.  Survival information may be obtained via telephone calls and/or clinical visits 
starting at the time of disease progression or after Final Visit.  All Phase 2 subjects will be 
followed for survival information unless the su bject requests to be withdrawn specifically  
from this study  survival follow -up; this request must be documented in the subject's 
medical record and signed by  the Investigator.  In such instances, sites may enter 
confirmation of death using source documenta tion from publicly  available records such as 
death certificates or funeral notices.  
For subjects to be considered lost to follow -up, reasonable attempts must be made to 
obtain information on the final status of the subject.  At a minimum, 2 telephone calls 
must be made, and 1 certified letter must be sent and documented in the subject's source 
documentation.
Non- Treatment Emergent Death Collection
After the end of the AE reporting period (i.e., in this instance > 30 days after the final 
dose of study  drug ), all deaths, including any relevant clinical information leading to the 
death, regardless of cause, should be reported through use of the Non -Treatment 
Emergent Death eCRFs.
Assignment of Subject Numbers
Subjects will be assigned unique consecutive subje ct numbers at Screening via I RT, as 
described in Section 5.5.3 .  The results of all screening evaluations must be within 
clinically  acceptable limit s, upon review by the investigator, before a subject can be

screening results are unacceptable.
5.3.1.2 Confinement
Subjects will not be confined during this study  but, may be hospitalized for TL S 
prophy laxis treatment and observation.
5.3.1.3 Meals and Dietary  Requirements
Subjects will self -administer venetoclax orally  with approximately  240 mL of water 
within 30 minutes after the completion of a low -fat breakfast once daily .  Dos e Escalation 
portion subjects will consume a standard low-fat breakfast prior to study  drug 
administration on intensive PK sample collection day C ycle 2 Day  1; a sample of a 
standard low -fat meal description is provided in Appendix D.  All subjects may not 
consume the following:
●Grapefruit or grapefruit products, Seville oranges (including marmalade 
containing Seville oranges) or star fruit within the 3 -day period prior to the 
first study  drug administration and until the last day of treatment is completed 
due to possible CYP3A mediated metabolic interaction.
Meal information (e.g., whether or not the dose was taken within 30 minutes after 
completing breakfast or whether grapefruit products were consumed within the past 
3days) will be recorded.
5.3.1.4 Collection and Handling of Biomarker and Exploratory  
Research Samples
Blood, serum, plasma, bone marrow aspirate and bone marrow core biopsy tissue will be 
collected per Table 9and Table10.  Subjects wi ll also have the option to provide samples 
for exploratory  research.  Subjects may  still participate in the main study  even if they  
decide not to participate in the optional exploratory research.  Samples may be utilized to 
evaluate known and/or novel markers (nucleic acids, peptides/proteins and/or metabolites)

5.3.2.2 Handling/Processing of Samples
Blood Samples for Venetoclax PK Assay
Immediately  after collection, the blood samples for venetoclax will be inverted 8 to 
10times to ensure good mixing of the blood and anticoagulant, and will be placed in an 
ice bath.  The blood samples will be centrifuged using a refrigerated centrifuge (2° to 8°C) 
to separate the plasma at 1100 to 1600 × g for 15 minutes within 1 hour of blood 
collection.  The plasma s amples will be transferred using plastic pipettes into 
screw -capped pol yprop ylene tubes (cry ovials) labeled with the drug number name, assay  
type, type of sample (plasma), the protocol number, the subject number, the study cycle 
and day , and the planned ti me of sampling relative to dosing and then frozen at –20°C or 
colder.  The entire process should be completed within 2 hours of draw.  Samples should 
be maintained at –20°C or colder until shipped to the central laboratory .
5.3.2.3 Disposition of Samples
The froze n plasma samples for venetoclax assay s will be packed in dry  ice sufficient to 
last during transport and shipped from the study site to the central laboratory according to 
instructions included in the laboratory  manuals for this study .  An inventory  of the
samples included will accompan y the package.  The central laboratory will be responsible 
for shipping the plasma samples to AbbVie for testing.
5.3.2.4 Measurement Methods
Plasma concentrations of venetoclax will be determined under the supervision of the Drug 
Analysis Department at AbbVie.

5.3.3 Efficacy  Variables
In the Phase 1 portion, all efficacy  endpoints are secondary , and therefore exploratory  in 
nature.  In the Phase 2 portion, confirmatory  testing will be conducted for ORR and 
VGPR+, the primary  efficacy  endpo ints.  Secondary  efficacy  endpoints include PFS, 
DOR, TTR, TTP, OS, and the following PROs:  Worst Pain (BPI -SF), Phy sical 
Functioning and GHS/QoL  (EORTC QLQ -C30), and Fatigue (PROMI S Cancer Fatigue 
SF).  Tertiary  efficacy  endpoints include the PROs based on the remaining subscales of 
BPI-SF, EORTC QLQ -C30, EORTC QL Q-M20, and EQ -5D-5L.
5.3.3.1 IMWG Criteria for Tumor Response
Subjects with multiple myeloma with measurable disease at baseline will be evaluated 
using the 2011 IMWG criteria23-25(Phase 1 subjects) or 2016 standard IMWG criteria30
(Phase 2 subje cts) provided in Appendix E.
Eligibility:   Only  subjects with measurable disease at baseline can have objective 
response evaluated as an end point.  All baseline evaluations should be performed during 
the screening period and prior to the first dose of study drug.
IMWG Criteria
Subjects will be assessed for response using the IMWG response criteria.  All response 
categories require two consecutive assessments made at any time before the institution of 
any new therapy .  All response categories (i.e., stringent complete response, complete 
response, very  good partial response, partial response, minimal response, and stable 
disease) also require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if 
radiographic studies were performed.  Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy 
these response r equirements.  Response criteria for all categories and subcategories of 
response except CR are applicable only  to subjects who have 'measurable' disease defined 
by at least one of the following three measurements:
●Serum M -protein ≥ 1.0 g/dL  (≥ 10 g/L)
●Urine M-protein ≥ 200 mg/24 hr

other facility  may  be used to manage subject disease assessm ent of IMWG (Serum M-
Protein, Urine M -Protein, Serum Free Light Chains, Serum quantitative 
immunoglobulins).  L ocal lab results should be obtained along with reference ranges and 
kept within the subjects' source documentation.  Local lab results should be reviewed b y 
the investigator as soon as possible. For Phase 1 subjects local IMWG assessments are 
allowable per protocol prior to the COVID- 19 Pandemic.
5.3.3.2 Evaluation of Disease
IMWG response assessments wi ll be reviewed b y the Investigator per the 2011 I MWG 
criteria23-25(Phase 1 subjects) or 2016 standard IMWG criteria30(Phase 2 subjects) 
provided in ( Appendix E).  If the Investigator confirms the subject meets the criteria for 
progressive disease, the subject will be deemed as having met an event of disease 
progression.  For the purposes of this study , the date of progression will be the date on 
which the IMWG assessments were obtained.
Phase 1 po rtion:   All IMWG laboratory  assessments will be performed by  the central 
laboratory.  Investigators may  choose to submit additional samples to their local 
laboratory  for testing.  All local lab results must be entered into the eCRF.  
Phase 2 portion:   
AllIMWG response assessments are to be based on the central 
laboratory  results, with the exception of imaging and bone marrow assessments which are 
performed locall y.

COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
If travel restrictions or other changes in local regulations in light of the COVID -19 
pandemic prevent the subject from visiting the study  site for the collection and shipping of 
IMWG laboratory  assessments to the central laboratory, a local laboratory, hospital, or 
other facility  may  be used to manage subject disease assessment of IMWG (Serum M -
Protein, Urine M -Protein, Serum Free Light Chains, Serum quantitative 
immunoglobulins).  L ocal lab results should be obtained along with reference ranges and 
kept within the subjects' source documentation.  Local lab results should be reviewed b y 
the investigator as soon as possible. For Phase 1 subjects local IMWG assessments are 
allowable per protocol prior to the COVID- 19 Pandemic.
5.3.4 Safety  Variables
The following safet y evaluations will be performed during the stud y:  adverse event 
monitoring, vital signs, phy sical examination, 12 -lead ECG, MUGA/2D echocardiogram, 
(Phase 1 portion only ), and laboratory  assessments.
5.3.5 Pharmacokinetic Variables
Values for the PK parameters of venetoclax, including the maximum observed plasma 
concentration (C max), the time to C max(peak time, T max) and the area under the plasma 
concentration- time curve (AUC) over a 24 -hour dose interval (AUC 0-24) will be 
determined using noncompartmental methods for doses administered on the intensive PK 
day (i.e., C ycle 2 Day 1 in the dose escalation cohorts).  Additional parameters may be 
calculated if useful in the interpretation of the data.
5.3.6 Biomarker and Exploratory  Research Variables
Biospecimens (blood, serum, plasma , bone marrow aspirate and bone marrow core biops y 
tissue) will be collected to conduct biomarker and exploratory  anal yses.  The ty pes of 
biomarkers to be anal yzed may  include, but are not limited to, nucleic acids, proteins, 
lipids or metabolites.  The sa mples may  be anal yzed as part of a multi -study  assessment of 
factors influencing the subjects' response to the study  drug (or drugs of the same or  
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
114
similar class) or and progression of the subjects' disease related conditions.  The 
information learned from anal yzing these samples may  be used to investigate factors 
influencing response to treatment, scientific questions related to MM, and/or in the 
development of new therapies and diagnostic tests, or technologies.  The results from 
these anal yses may  not be included with the study report.
Biospecimens (serum, plasma, bone marrow aspirate and bone marrow core biopsy tissue) 
will be collected to support biomarker objectives of the study .  These include assessment 
of BCL -2 family  member expression at baseline as a predictive biomarker of response.  
BCL -2 family member mRNA expression will be determined b y qPCR analy sis in 
CD138- enriched samples from bone marrow aspirates.  BCL -2 family  member protein 
expression will be evaluated in bone marrow core biopsies by  IHC.  Additional biomarker 
objectives include the assessment of FISH markers that are known to be prognostic in 
MM.  These include, but not limited to, t(11;14), t(4;14), t(14;16), del 17p, and +5, +9, or 
+15.  The VenDex combination cohort and Phase 2 porti on will evaluate safety  and 
efficacy  of venetoclax at the RPTD in subjects with t(11;14) -positive MM.  Subjects MM 
tumor cells with the t(11;14) translocation were found to be associated with increased 
sensitivity  to venetoclax in preclinical studies of MM .8  t(11;14) -positive samples also 
demonstrated a high median BCL -2/MCL -1 mRNA ratio.8  MRD is an emerging 
component of response assessment in MM subjects.  Exploratory  anal ysis of MRD 
negativity  in the bone marrow at 10–4, 10–5and 10–6thresholds may  be performed.
Additional exploratory  evaluations may  include biomarkers related to pathway (s) targeted 
by the stud y drug, those believed to be related to the disease or to drug response 
evaluation or associ ation with genetic factors.  Plasma and serum samples may be 
analyzed for mutational status of circulating tumor DNA and measurement of relevant 
cytokine, chemokine, matrix metalloproteinases and markers of bone turnover 
(formation/resorption).  Blood may  also be anal yzed by  immune cell phenoty ping and 
quantification, and T -cell clonality  assed by  immune -sequencing.  The analy ses of tumor 
tissue/cells may  include but are not limited to I HC and qPCR -based assays for BCL -2 
family  members and other nucleic aci ds or proteins known to regulate the expression of  
Venetoclax (ABT -199)

115
these molecules.  Gene sequencing -and h ybridization -based techniques may also be used 
on any  of the above specimens for exploratory  biomarker research.
Blood samples may  also be sequenced and data analy zed for genetic factors contributing 
to the disease or to the subject's response to venetoclax, or other study treatment in terms 
of pharmacokinetics, efficacy, tolerability, and safety.  Such genetic factors may include 
genes for drug metabolizing enz ymes, drug transport proteins, genes within the target 
pathway , genes believed to be related to the disease or to drug response.  Some genes 
currentl y insufficiently characterized or unknown may be understood to be important at 
the time of anal ysis.  The results are exploratory  in nature, and may  not be included with 
the study  summary .
5.4 Removal of Subjects from Therapy  or Assessment
5.4.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subjects
Each subject has the right to withdraw from the study  at any  time.  In addition, the 
investigator will discontinue a subject from the study at an y time if the investigator 
considers it necessary  for any  reason, including:
●The investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject;
●The subject 's response to therap y is unsatisfactor y, as evidenced b y 
progression of disease while on study  drug;
○However, during dose escalation and safety expansion portion, the subject 
can be considered for venetoclax in combination with dexamenthasone 
upon failing venetoclax monotherap y;
●The subject's response to combination therap y is unsatisfactory, as evidenced 
by progression of disease while on combination therap y;
●The subject experiences toxicities related to study  drug asclinicall y significant 
abnormal laboratory  results or AEs, which rule out co ntinuation of the study 
drugs, as determined b y the investigator or the AbbVie Therapeutic Area 
Medical Director. 
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
116
●The subject requires more than 2 dose reductions of venetoclax , in the absence 
of objective response to study  treatment;
●The subject requires radiotherap y, cancer -related surgery  as a result of disease
progression, or alternate anti -neoplastic agents during the stud y period;
●The subject becomes pregnant or begins breast -feeding;
●Subject is s ignificant lynoncomplian twith the study  procedures, wh ich would 
put the subject at risk for continued participation in the trial.
All subjects will be included for anal ysis of safety data.  Subjects who withdraw from the 
study  will not be replaced unless they  are not evaluable.
During the Phase 1 portion, evaluable subjects are defined as those subjects who:
●Experience a DLT, or
●Complete approximately  80% or more of the treatment regimen during the 
DLT assessment period.
In the event that a subject withdraws or is discontinued from the stud y, the reason(s) for 
the discontinuation from the study  and primary  reason will be recorded.  Final visit 
procedures per Table 5and Table 7, as applicable, will be performed as soon as possible 
after discontinuation from the stud y.  Additional blood samples for drug measurement 
may be collected at the time of discontinuation from subjects who are discontinued due to 
adverse events; the clock time, time in relation to dose, and date the sample was taken will 
be recorded.
If a subje ct is discontinued from the study  with an ongoing adverse event or an unresolved 
laboratory  result that is significantly  outside of the reference range, the investigator will 
attempt to provide follow -up until a satisfactory  clinical resolution of the labo ratory  result 
or adverse event is achieved. 
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
117
At the end of the subject's participation in the study, the calendars/diaries are to be 
returned to the site and appropriatel y filed with the subject's source documents for this 
study .
A Safet y Follow -up Visit should be performed for all subjects approximately 30 days 
following discontinuation of study  drug and then as clinically  appropriate for safet y 
assessment.  The subject will be followed until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the 
adverse event is achiev ed.
A separate Safet y Follow -up Visit does not need to be performed for subjects who had a 
Final Visit conducted ≥ 30 day s after discontinuation of study  drug and did not require 
additional adverse event follow -up.  If the subject refuses or is unable to a ttend the Safet y 
Follow -up Visit, this should be noted in the subject's source documentation.
In the event that a positive result is obtained on a pregnancy test for a subject or a subject 
reports becoming pregnant during the stud y, the administration of s tudy drug must be 
discontinued immediately.  The investigator must report a pregnancy  within 1 working 
day of the site being aware to one of the AbbVie representatives listed in Section 6.1.6 or 
Section 7.0.
If a subject withdraws from study  follow up or withdraws permission for the collection of 
their personal data, the study  staff may  still use available public records to obtain 
information about survival status only , as appropriate per local regulations .
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modification
During the COVID- 19 pandemic, it has been necessary  to employ  mitigation strategies to 
enable the investigator to ensure subject safet y and continuity of care.  Additional 
guidance regarding the location of COVID- 19 pandemic -related acceptable protocol 
modifications can be found in Section 5.3.1.1 . 
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
118
The investigator should contact the AbbVie TA MD or designee before discontinuing a 
subject from the stud yforreason sother than those identified a bove to ensure all 
acceptable mitigation steps have been explored.
All efforts sh ould be made to obtain safet y and disease response information at the End of 
Treatment visit prior to the subject initiating another therap y.  If travel restrictions or other 
changes in local regulations in light of the COVID -19 pandemic prevent the subject from 
having blood drawn for laboratory testing at the study site at the End of Treatment and/or 
Safety  Follow -Up Visit, if possible, arrange for subjects to have laboratory  work done at a 
local lab, hospital, or other facility.  Local lab results should be obtained along with 
reference ranges and kept within the subjects 'source documentation.  L ocal lab results 
should be reviewed b y the investigator as soon as possible.   Before starting another MM 
therap y, the site shall make all effort to complete Final Visit and Safet y Follow Up Visit 
procedures to obtain safety and disease response information.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
AbbVie may  terminate this study  prematurel y,either in its entirety  or at an y site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination.  An investigator may  also terminate the study  at his/her site for reasonable 
cause, after providing written notic e to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination.  
Advance notice is not required by either part y if the study is stopped due to safet y 
concerns.  If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will immediately 
notify  the investigators by  telephone and subsequently  provide written instructions for 
study  termination.
If, in the judgment of the investigators and AbbVie, the continued exposure to the study  
drug represents a significant risk to subjects, the study will be stopped.  The following 
procedures for discontinuation will be followed:
●If the sponsor has decided to prematurel y discontinue the study, the sponsor 
will promptly  notify  the investigator s in writing as well as regulatory  
authorities of the decision and give detailed reasons for th e discontinuation.

●The investigator smust promptly  notify  the IEC/I RBsand give detailed reasons 
for the discontinuation.
●The investigator smust promptly  notify  the enrolled subjects of the premature 
discontinuation and administer appropriate treatments su ch as replacement of 
the treatment regimen, if applicable, b y other appropriate regimens.
5.5 Treatments
5.5.1 Treatments A dministered
Each dose of venetoclax will be taken with approximately  240 mL of water.  On day s that 
pre-dose PK sampling is required (refer to Table 8), dosing will occur in the morning at 
the clinic at approximately 0900 (± 1 hour) to facilitate PK sampling.  Dose Escalation 
cohort subjects will take venetoclax within 30 minutes after the completion of a standard
low-fat breakfast ( Appendix D) with approximately 240 mL of water on C ycle2 Day  1.  
On all other dosing day s, subjects will be instructed to take venetoclax orally  QD within 
30minutes after the completion of a low -fat breakfast.
In cases of vomiting, no replacement dose is to be given.  In cases where a dose is missed 
or forg otten, the subject should take the dose as soon as possible, ensuring the dose is 
taken within 8 hours of the missed dose with food.  Otherwise, the dose should not be 
taken.
During dose escalation and safet y expansion, upon assessment of progressive disea se and 
discussion with the AbbVie TA MD, the investigator may  add dexamethasone treatment 
starting at 40 mg PO on Day s 1, 8, 15 of each 21 -day cycle per the dexamethasone 
prescribing information.
During the VenDex combination and Phase 2 cohorts, subjects will receive venetoclax, 
daily  (Day  1 –21), at the RPTD with dexamethasone (40 mg PO) on Day s 1, 8, and 15 of 
each 21 -day cycle, per the dexamethasone prescribing information.  All subjects who are 
≥ 75 y ears old may  start dexamethasone at a 20 mg dose.  During the VenDex 
combination and Phase 2 cohorts, in cases where a dexamethasone dose is missed or  
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
120
forgotten, the subject should take the dose as soon as possible, ensuring the dose is taken 
within 48 hours of the missed dose.  Otherwise, the dose should not be taken.  Subjects 
will be instructed to take each dose of venetoclax orally QD with approximately 240 mL 
of water and within 30 minutes after the completion of breakfast or the subject's first meal 
of the day .  Tablets must be swallowed whole and mus t not be broken, chewed, or 
crushed.  On day s that pre -dose PK sampling is required, dosing will occur at the clinic to 
facilitate PK sampling.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
If a subject is unable to come to the study  site to pick up their study  drug (venetoclax and 
dexamethasone) due to COVID -19, a direct -to-patient (DTP) study  drug shipment can be 
made from the stud y site to the subject if allowed by local regulations.  AbbVie will 
submit any  required notifications to the reg ulatory  authority  as applicable .  Prior to DTP 
shipping, the study  site must confirm it is still safe for the subject to continue on treatment 
via onsite (preferred), phone or video conference visit, or local assessments as permitted 
through COVID- 19 Pande mic-Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications.  These 
assessments shall be documented in the source data accordingl y.
Study  drug may  be shipped from the stud y site directly to the stud y subject's home if all 
the following criteria are met:
●Direct -to-patien t (DTP) shipment of study  drug is allowed by  local regulations 
and the relevant ethics committee
●Study  drug can be administered by  the subject at home
●Subject agrees to have the study  drug shipped directly  to their home
●Assessment of the following procedur es prior to dispensing venetoclax to 
subjects:  AE/CM review, safet y labs reviewed [hematology, chemistry, 
Coagulation panel], urine pregnancy testing (women of childbearing potential), 
IMWG disease assessment (central lab collection preferred, local labor atory  
acceptable if not possible to collect centrally ), and continuation of TL S 
prophy laxis and infections (as applicable). 
Venetoclax (ABT -199)

121
●Instructions will be provided by AbbVie as to how a study site can initiate a 
DTP shipment using Marken, a global vendor selected b yAbbVie to provide 
this service when necessary .
○Marken is the preferred courier for DTP shipping; however, in extenuating 
circumstances, alternate local couriers may be allowed with prior approval 
from the AbbVie Clinical Contact (or designee) identified i n Section 7.0.  
If Marken is not utilized, the study  site is responsible for ensuring the 
courier will transport the study drug under appropriate temperature -
controlled conditions and require a signature for delivery .
●Shipments may  also include other study  supplies (e.g., drug dosing diaries).  
Subjects should provide dosing updates to site staff during remote phone or 
video conference visits and re turn diaries to the site at the time of the next 
onsite visit.
●Prior to arranging shipment, the study site should contact the subject to 
confirm the subject will be available to accept delivery  of the shipment.
●Shipments of study  drugs from the study  site to a subject's home will be 
appropriatel y temperature controlled (qualified shipper or temperature 
monitoring) within the labeled storage conditions.  Signature is required upon 
delivery ; due to COVID -19 related social distancing, this may  be provided by  
the courier after delivery .  Documentation of the shipment is to be retained by  
the clinical site.
●The site should contact the patient to confirm delivery  of the shipment and the 
date and time of the next dose, and document this in the source documents.
● Abb Vie will not receive subject identify ing information related to these 
shipments, as the site will work directl y with the courier.
The study  site is responsible for meeting IRB/IEC reporting requirements related to DTP 
shipments of study  drug, and for obta ining consent to provide delivery  information to the 
courier and documenting this consent in source documents.
The study  site must keep records of all shipments within the subject source 
documentation.

The venetoclax tablets will be packaged in high density  polyethylene (HDPE) plastic 
bottles to accommodate the study design.  Each bottle will be labeled per local regulatory  
requirements.
For t he VenDex combination and Phase 2 cohorts, AbbVie will provide dexamethasone.  
It will be packaged in blistercards or bottles to accommodate study design.  Each 
blistercard or bottle will be labeled per local regulatory requirements.
5.5.2.2 Storage and Dispositio n of Study Drug
The venetoclax and dexamethasone study  drug must be stored at 15° to 25°C (59° to 
77°F).  Dexamethasone should also be protected from moisture.  The investigational 
products ( Table 16) are for investigational use only and are to be used onl y within the 
context of this study .  The study  drug(s) supplied for this study  must be maintained under 
adequate securit y and stored under the conditio ns specified on the label until dispensed for 
subject use or returned to AbbVie.
5.5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
All subjects will be assigned a unique subject number on the first day of screening via 
IRT.  Since this is an open -label study , subjects will maintain the same subject number 
regardless of the number of re -screens and through the duration of the stud y.
5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Selection of the dose for this study  is discussed in Section 5.6.4.  The same dose will be 
administered to all subjects in each dose level within each portion.  Once the MTD is 
declared for dose escalation or safet y expansion portion, subjects who remain on study  
and continue to tolerate the drug may  escalate to the dose level determined to be the MTD 
or an y dose level below the MTD, provided they have completed at least 2 cycles at their 
originall y assigned dose level.  For Do se Escalation subjects, Cy cle 2 Day  1 dosing will 
occur in the morning at the clinic (refer to Section 5.5.1) when subjects will receive

venetoclax within 30 minutes after the completion of a standard low-fat breakfast 
(Appendix D).  On all other dosing days, subjects will be instruc ted to take venetoclax 
tablets orally  within 30 minutes after the completion of a low -fat breakfast once dail y 
(QD).  All doses of venetoclax will be taken with approximately  240 mL of water.
5.5.5 Blinding
This is an open -label study .
5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
The i nvestigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will 
administer/dispense study drug onl y to subjects enrolled in the study in accordance with 
the protocol.  The stud y drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the 
protoc ol.
To document compliance with the treatment regimen, subjects will be instructed to return 
all unused tablets and/or bottles, even if empt y and any other stud y related items as 
necessary , to the study  coordinator at scheduled study  visits.  Compliance wi ll be 
monitored and documented by  the study  coordinator on the appropriate form.  The 
investigator or designee will question the subject regarding adherence to the dosing 
regimen, record the number of tablets and/or bottles returned, the date returned, and
determine treatment compliance before dispensing new study  drug to the subject.  
Compliance below 80% will require counseling of the subject b y study site personnel.
5.5.7 Drug A ccountability
The investigator or his/her designated representatives will administe r study drug onl y to 
subjects enrolled in the study .  Documentation of the receipt of supplies will be supported 
by a signed and dated Proof of Receipt or similar document.  A current (running) and 
accurate inventory  of study  drug will be kept by  the site and will include lot number, 
Proof of Receipt number(s), bottle numbers, and the date on which stud y drug is provided 
to the subject.

An overall accountability of study drug will be performed and verified b y AbbVie or the 
designated monitor(s) throughout t he study and at the study site Closeout Visit.  Upon 
completion or termination of the study, all original containers (containing partially used or 
unused study  drug) will be returned to AbbVie according to instructions from AbbVie or 
the designated monitor(s).  If prearranged between AbbVie and the site, destruction of 
used and unused study drug bottles will be performed at the site.  Empty containers will 
be destro yed at the site.  Labels must remain attached to the containers.
5.5.8 Safety  Rev iew Committee
A Sa fety Review Committee (SRC) will periodically review safety data across all studies 
with venetoclax in MM that do not have a stud y-specific independent monitoring 
committee.  This review committee will be responsible for periodic, regular reviews to 
assess the safety  of the interventions during the trial.  A separate charter will be prepared 
outside of the protocol outlining the SRC member responsibilities, frequency of data 
reviews, and relevant data to be assessed.
5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study  Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study  Design and Choice of Control Groups
During the dose escalation portion of the study , dose cohorts (dose levels) will contain a 
minimum of 3 subjects each for evaluation and safety  assessments which will be crucial 
for determining d rug dose escalation as described in Section 5.1.  There are no control 
groups in this study .
5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard pharmacokinet ic, statistical, clinical, and laboratory procedures will be utilized 
in this study .
5.6.3 Suitability  of Subject Population
Subjects with relapsed or refractory MM will be selected to participate in this study .  
Subjects with MM must have relapsed following or be refractory  to standard treatments  
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
126
such as melphalan, bortezomib, and lenalidomide.  I n addition, the subject should be 
unable to tolerate other available therapies or no other therapies are available.  Preclinical 
findings support the possibility  of eff icacy  in this patient population.  Due to the expected 
mechanism -based l ymphopenia, subjects will be monitored to assess risk for infection.  
As a preventative measure, proph ylaxis for viral, fungal, bacterial or Pneumocy stis 
infections will be implemented when appropriate.
Subjects who harbor t(11;14) assessed b y the central laboratory will be eligible for the 
VenDex combination cohort and Phase 2 portion of this study .
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
The 800 mg QD RPTD of venetoclax in the VenDex combinat ion cohort was selected 
based on the results from a Phase 1b study  (Study M12 -901) of venetoclax plus 
bortezomib and dexamethasone in relapsed or refractory  MM subjects and the venetoclax 
monotherap y portions of this study  (Study  M13 -367).  An exposure -response anal ysis of 
the efficacy  (best response) and safet y (grade ≥ 3 anemia, thrombocy topenia, and 
neutropenia) from Study  M12 -901 indicated that a venetoclax dosage regimen of 600 mg 
QD or higher in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone would like ly result in a 
substantial VGPR or better response rate with these response rates increasing through 
1200 mg QD.  No relationship was observed between venetoclax exposure and anemia or 
thrombocy topenia, but the neutropenia (grade ≥ 3) rates began to increa se at doses above 
800 mg QD.  Similar exploratory exposure -response anal yses from the venetoclax 
monotherap y portions of this study  (Study  M13 -367) indicated a trend of increasing 
response rates through 1200 mg QD in the t(11;14) positive subjects.  Howeve r, with 
venetoclax monotherap y in MM, no relationship was observed between venetoclax 
exposure and anemia, thrombocy topenia, or neutropenia.  The 40 mg once weekl y 
dexamethasone dose in the VenDex combination cohort was selected as it is a commonly  
used de xamethasone dose in MM combination therap y, such as with daratumumab and 
lenalidomide or bortezomib.

127
Subsequent to completion of the VenDex combination cohort of the stud y, additional 
venetoclax exposure -response anal yses were conducted using both the mono therap y and 
dexamethasone combination therap y portions of this study .  These anal yses confirmed the 
benefit of the addition of dexamethasone to the venetoclax regimen, that response rates 
(ORR and VGPR+) were expected to increase with higher venetoclax dos es in 
combination with dexamethasone in t(11;14) positive patients, and that no relationship 
was evident between venetoclax exposure and anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia.  
Based on these efficacy  and safet y results, and considering treatment compli ance 
considerations, a venetoclax dose of 800 mg QD with 40 mg dexamethasone once weekl y 
was selected to be used in the Phase 2 portion of the study.
The maximum dose of venetoclax for this protocol will not exceed 1200 mg/day.
6.0 Complaints
A Complaint is an y written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies 
related to the ph ysical characteristics, identity , quality , purit y, potency, durability , 
reliability , safet y, effectiveness, or performance of a product/device after it is released for 
distribution.
Complaints associated with any  component of this investigational product must be 
reported to the Sponsor (Section 6.1.6).  For adverse events, please refer to Section 6.1
through 6.1.12.  For product complaints, please refer to Section 6.2.
6.1 Medical Complaints
The investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse 
events on a routine basis throughout the stud y.  The investigator will assess and record 
any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or 
sign/sy mptom, severity , time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the 
adverse event to study  drug, and any  action(s) taken.  For serious adverse events 
considered as having "no reasonable possibility " of b eing associated with study  drug, the 
investigator will provide an other cause of the event.  For adverse events to be considered  
Venetoclax (ABT -199)

intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severit y.  Adverse events, whether in 
response to a query , observed b y site personnel, or reported spontaneously  by the subject 
will be recorded.
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1.1 Definitions
6.1.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily  have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or l abeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse or drug withdrawal.  An y 
worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity  of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse 
event.  Laboratory  abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse 
events only  if they  result in discontinuation from the study , necessitate therapeutic 
medical intervention, meet protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.1.8 regarding toxicity  
management) and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur dur ing a stud y will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery /procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition 
and/or the surgery /procedure has been pre -planned prior to study  entry .  However, if the 
pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpe ctedl y during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective 
surgery /procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event. 
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
129
A treatment -emergent adverse event is defined as any adverse event with onset or 
worsening reported b y a subject from the time that the first dose of study drug is 
administered until 30 days have elapsed following discontinuation of study drug 
administration.
6.1.1.2 Serious A dverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as a 
serious adverse event within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse 
event:
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An even t that, in the opinion of the investigator, would 
have resulted in immediate fatality if medical 
intervention had not been taken.  This does not include 
an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in 
a more severe form.
Hospitalization or 
Prolongation of 
HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for 
any length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital 
stay.  This does not include an emergency  room visit or 
admission to an outpatient facility .
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or an y anomaly 
that results in fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study 
subject.  Disability  is not intended to include 
experiences of relativel y minor medical significance 
such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).

Important Medical Event 
Requiring Medical or 
Surgical Interve ntion to 
Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may  not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or 
hospitalization, but based on medical judgment may 
jeopardize the subject and may  require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent an y of the outcomes 
listed above (i.e., death of subject, life -threatening, 
hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, 
congenital anomal y, or persistent or significant 
disability /incapacity).  Additionally , any  elective or 
spontaneous aborti on or stillbirth is considered an 
important medical event.  Examples of such events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization , or the development of drug dependency  
or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
Hospitalization for a subject with high disease burden as indic ated b y elevated white 
blood cells, bulky  disease and/or h yperuricemia who require observation and management 
(e.g., for IV hydration) for the purpose of TL S prophy laxis will not be captured as a 
serious adverse event (SAE), unless there is an additional reason for hospitalization or an 
additional criterion for seriousness other than hospitalization.
Hospitalization of a subject within 30 day s following discontinuation of study  drug for 
subsequent line of therapy will not be recorded as serious adverse events.
Certain adverse events are anticipated to occur in the study population (MM) at some 
frequency  independent of the study  drug exposure.  Such events include known 
consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation (e.g., s ymptom s, 
disease progression) and events unlikely to be related to the underl ying disease or 
condition under investigation but common in the study  population independent of the 
study  drug (e.g., cardiovascular events in an elderly population). 
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
131
Cytopenias (anemia , neutropenia, or thrombocy topenia) are part of the natural history  of 
MM.  Persistent cy topenias at the same CTCAE grade as at baseline are not to be reported 
as adverse events, unless they fulfill a seriousness criteria, result in permanent 
discontinuati on of a study drug, or the investigator had an identifiable cause other than the 
underly ing disease.  However, all laboratory  data should be entered regardless of whether 
an adverse event is reported.
These events are listed in Appendix H(Adverse Events Commonly  Associated with MM 
Study  Population or Progression of MM).
These adverse events may occur alone or in various combinations and are considere d 
expected for reporting purposes for this protocol.
Although exempted from expedited reporting to Health Authorities and IRBs as 
individual cases, if an event commonly associated with MM or progression of MM meets 
seriousness criteria it must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site being made 
aware of the serious adverse event (Refer to Section 6.1.6).  For deaths related to disease 
progre ssion (coded to malignant neoplasm progression), the date and cause of death will 
be recorded on the appropriate case report form, but the event will not be expedited as an 
individual case safety  report to regulatory  authorities.
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
Theinvestigator will rate the severit y of each adverse event according to the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE 
Version 4.0).26  If a reported adverse event increases in severit y, the initial adverse event 
should be given an outcome date and a new adverse event reported on a different onset 
date than the end date of the previous adverse event to reflect the change in severit y.  For 
all reported serious adverse events that increase in severit y, the supplemental eCRFs also 
need to be updated to reflect the change in severity. 
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
132
For adverse events not captured by t he Common Terminology  Criteria, the following 
should be used:
Grade 1 The adverse event is transient and easil y tolerated by the subject (mild).
Grade 2 The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the 
subject's usual activities (moderat e).
Grade 3 The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's 
usual activities and may  be incapacitating (moderate to severe).
Grade 4 The adverse event is life -threatening requiring urgent intervention 
(severe).
Grade 5 The adverse event resulted in death of the subject (severe).
6.1.3 Adverse Events Expected Due to Study  Related Endpoints
6.1.3.1 Deaths
Deaths that occur during the protocol specified adverse event reporting period (see 
Section 6.1.5) that are more likely related to disease progression will therefore be an 
expected adverse event and will not be subject to expedited reporting.
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generall y, only  one such event should be reported.  
The term "sudden death" should only  be used for the occurrence of an abrupt and 
unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without pre -existing 
heart disease, within 1 hour of the onset of acute symptoms or, in the case of an 
unwitnessed death, within 24 hours after the patient was last seen alive and stable.  If the 
cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, 
"unexplained death" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the cause of 
death later becomes available (e.g., after au topsy), "unexplained death" should be replaced 
by the established cause of death.

133
6.1.3.2 Lack of Efficacy  or Worsening of Disease
Events that are clearl y consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the 
underly ing disease are also considered an expected outcome for this study  and will not be 
subject to expedited reporting.
6.1.4 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of stud y drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility , clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consider ation of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility , clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility  of being 
related to the stud y drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no 
reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug will be considered "not associated."  
In addition, when the investigator has n ot reported causality  or deemed it not assessable, 
AbbVie will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opinion of no reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug is 
given, an "Other" cause of event must be provided by the investigator for the serious 
adverse event.
6.1.5 Adverse Event Collection Period
All protocol -related serious adverse events must be collected from the signing of the stud y 
specific informed consent until study drug administration. 
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
134
Serious adverse events occurring after the study -specific informed consent is signed but 
prior to the initial dose of venetoclax will be collected only if they are considered b y the 
investigator to be causally related to the stud y-required procedures.
In addition, all serious and non -serious adver se events reported from the time of study 
drug administration until 30 days or 5 half lives, whichever is longer, following 
discontinuation of study  drug administration have elapsed will be collected, whether 
elicited or spontaneousl y reported b y the subje ct.
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 6.

AbbVie will be responsible for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction 
(SUSAR) reporting for the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) in accordance with 
global and local guidelines, and Appendix A of the Investigator Brochure will serve as the 
Reference Safet y Information (RSI ) for the AbbVie I MP.  The RSI  in effect at the start of 
a Drug Safety  Update Report (DSUR) reporting period serves as the RSI durin g the 
reporting period.  For follow -up reports, the RSI in place at the time of occurrence of the 
"suspected" Serious Adverse Reaction w ill be used to assess expectedness.
For comparator products being used as non- AbbVie IMPs, the SmPC will serve as the 
Reference Safet y Information (RSI ) for those non -AbbVie products.
The following definitions will be used for Serious Adverse Reactions (SAR) and 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR):
SAR Defined as all noxious and unintended responses to an IMP related to any dose 
administered that result in death, are life -threatening, require inpatient 
hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, result in persistent or 
significant disability or incapacity, or are a congenital anomaly or bir th defect.
SUSAR A suspected SAR:  refers to individual SAE case reports from clinical trials where a 
causal relationship betw een the SAE and the IMP w as suspected by either the 
sponsor or the investigator, is not listed is the applicable Reference Safety
Information, and meets one of the following serious criteria:  results in death, is 
life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of an existing 
hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a 
congenita l anomaly or birth defect.  All individually reported SARs are considered 
suspected.

COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
Supplemental study  case report forms should be completed in the event of COVID -19 
related missed/virtual visi ts, study  drug interruptions or discontinuations, or adverse 
events (including capture of specific signs/s ymptoms of infection and testing results).
COVID- 19 infections should be captured as adverse events.  If the event meets the criteria 
for a serious ad verse event (SAE), then follow the SAE reporting directions per the 
protocol and above.  The following COVID -19 related supplemental eCRFs should be 
completed (for both serious and non -serious events):
● COVID- 19 Supplemental Signs/Sy mptoms
● COVID- 19 Status F orm
Subjects with a confirmed (viral test positive) or suspected COVID -19 infection must 
interrupt all study  drugs until the COVI D-19 viral clearance criteria in Section 6.1.8.5 are 
met.  There are no time limits for study  drug interruption if no permanent study 
discontinuation criteria have been met.  The investigator should notify  the AbbVie TA 
MD or designee listed above when reintroducing any stud y drugs in subj ects with 
confirmed or suspected COVID -19 infection.
6.1.7 Pregnancy
Pregnancy  in a stud y subject must be reported to an AbbVie representative (Section 6.1.6
or Section 7.0) within 1 working day  of the site becoming aware of the pregnancy .  
Subjects who become pregnant during the stud y must be discontinued (Section 5.4.1).
All subjects should be informed that contraceptive measures should be taken throughout 
the study  and for 30 day s after discontinuing study drug.  Male subjects should be 
informed that con traceptive measures should be taken by  their female partner.  
Information regarding a pregnancy  occurrence in a study  subject and the outcome of the 
pregnancy  will be collected.  In the event of pregnancy  occurring in the partner of an 
enrolled subject, wr itten informed consent for release of medical information form the  
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
138
partner must be obtained prior to the collection of any pregnancy -specific information and 
the pregnancy  will be followed to outcome.
Pregnancy  in a stud y subject is not considered an adver se event.  The medical outcome for 
either mother or infant, meeting an y serious criteria including an elective or spontaneous 
abortion, is considered a serious adverse event and must be reported to AbbVie within 
24hours of the site becoming aware of the e vent.
Although no potential risks have been identified in nonclinical studies (please refer to 
Investigator Brochure Section 7.4) the effect of Bcl -2 inhibition on pregnancy  has not 
been full y characterized.  Venetoclax resulted in increased postimplantation loss and 
decreased fetal bod y weights were observed in the mouse embryofetal development study  
at the highest dosage administered.  Venetoclax is not advised in pregnancy or lactation.
6.1.8 Toxicity  Management
6.1.8.1 Definition –Dose Limiting Toxicit y (DLT)
Dose limiting toxicities (DL Ts) for dose -escalation purposes will be determined during 
the lead- in period (if applicable) plus the first cy cle (21 day s) of study  drug administration 
at the designated cohort dose.  Adverse events occurring following Cycle 1 will also be 
evaluated b y the investigator and the AbbVie TA MD and may be considered as dose 
limiting.  Any  of the following events that are considered to have a "reasonable 
possibility " of relationship to the administration of venetoclax, which cannot be attributed 
by the investigator to a clearl y identifiable cause such as disease progression, concurrent 
illness, or concomitant medication, will be considered a DLT:
●Grade 4 neutropenia lasting more than 7 day s
●Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutropenia with fever
●Grade 4 thrombocy topenia
●Grade 2 or higher bleeding associated with Grade ≥3 thrombocy topenia
●Unexpected Grade 2 or higher toxicity  which requires dose modification or 
delay  of ≥ 1week, will be considered a DLT (e.g., peripheral neuropath y) 
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
139
●Clinica l TLS will be considered a DLT.  Laboratory  TLS will be considered a 
DLT if the metabolic abnormalities are deemed clinically  significant by  the 
investigator.
●All other Grades 3, 4, or 5 adverse events will be considered a DLT with the 
exception of the fol lowing:
○Grade 3 thrombocy topenia that does not result in bleeding
○Grades 3, 4 l ymphopenia
○Grades 3, 4 leukopenia
○Grade 3 neutropenia
○Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea that is responsive to treatment
○Grade 3 or 4 hyperuricemia or hypocalcemia or Gra de 3 h yperkalemia, if 
transient (i.e., lasting < 48 hours) and without manifestations of clinical 
TLS (e.g., creatinine ≥ 1.5 × ULN, cardiac arrhy thmias, seizures, or sudden 
death)
If a DLT of TLS is observed during the lead -in period, it will be attributed to the lead- in 
period and a modification will be made to the lead -in period regimen for subsequent 
cohorts.  An y other DLT s observed during the lead -in and/or designated cohort dosing 
period will require a modification of the designated cohort dose (and /or lead -in period 
regimen, if appropriate) as directed per the Dose Escalation Guidelines (Section 5.1and 
Table 2).
Any DLT will require an interruption and possible discontinuation of venetoclax.  
Venetoclax may  be reintroduced, but only  at a reduced dose, if the toxicity  grade returns 
to ≤ Grade 1 or to baseline if Grade 2 at stud y entry.
Drug interruption for up to 72 hours following transient (i.e., lasting < 48 hours) chemical 
changes and laboratory  TLS may  be allowed and may  not be considered a DL T or require 
a dose reduction.  If the TL S has not resolved within 72 hours then a dose reduction 
should be considered.  The subject may  be allowed to re -escalate to the final dose based 
on a risk assessment (including tumor burden status). 
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
140
Any reduced dose level will be defined b y AbbVie after dis cussion between the 
investigator and the AbbVie TA MD.  The dose may  be increased thereafter as defined by  
AbbVie after discussion between the investigator and the AbbVie TA MD.  This dose is 
not to exceed the highest tolerated dose level.  All decisions r egarding continued dosing 
for individual subjects will be medically managed by the investigator, in conjunction with 
the AbbVie TA MD, as appropriate.  These decisions will be driven by the definition of 
DLTs as described above.
6.1.8.2 Management of Infection and Lymphopenia
There is a potential for clinically  significant infection and ly mphopenia (B and 
Tlymphocy te subt ypes) in this study .
It is recommended that subjects should receive anti -infective proph ylaxis 
(e.g., amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or levofloxacin or equivalent per institutional guidelines) 
at least during the first 90 days of study and upon disease progression for at least 30 days, 
unless contraindicated per investigator discretion.  Furthermore, it is recommended that 
subjects deemed at high risk of infection receive immunoglobulin replacement therap y 
(i.e., IVIG) per institutional guidelines or at the Investigator's discretion.
The use of antibiotics that are moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors (See Section 5.2.4.3
and Appendix C) should be avoided or used with caution and with appropriate venetoclax 
dose modificati on (See Table 4) as per protocol.
All subjects with MM receiving venetoclax should be closel y monitored for infections.  In 
the event of a Grade ≥ 3 infection or an y serious infection, treatment with venetoc lax 
should be interrupted.  Upon resolution, treatment can either be resumed at a reduced dose 
(see Table 18or Table 19) or discontinued at the discretion of the Investigator.  Please 
refer to Table 20for guidance on dose interruptions and/ or reductions related to 
venetoclax toxicities.  All anti -infective measures should be appropriatel y recorded on the 
eCRF.  Potential for drug -drug interactions should be considered.  Please refer to 
Appendix Cfor a description of excluded and cautionary medications.

6.1.8.3 Management of Neutropenia
There is a potential for clinically  significant neutropenia in this study .  If clinically  
indicated, standard management practices for neutropenia should be implemented at the 
investigator's discretion.
Anti-infective proph ylaxis and granulocy te-colon y stimulating factor (G- CSF) for 
management of neutropenia should be considered per institutional guidelines and 
appropriatel y recorded on the eCRF.  It is recommended that subjects should receive anti -
infective proph ylaxis (e.g., amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or levofloxacin or equivalent per 
institutional guidelines) when Grade 4 neutropenia develops (ANC < 500 cells/ uL) and 
continued until the neutropenia improves to Grade 3 or better (ANC >500 cells/uL ).
6.1.8.4 Management of Tumor Ly sis Sy ndrome
There is a potential for TLS in subjects affected by hematologic malignancies.  Depending 
on the specific tumor t ype, risk factors may include one or more of the following:  bulk y 
disease or high tumor burden, elevated pretreatment lactate deh ydrogenase (LDH) levels, 
elevated leukocyte count, renal insufficiency , and dehy dration.
Multiple my eloma patients with high tumor burden (e.g. , high bone marrow plasma cell 
infiltration, plasma cell leukemia or bulk y plasmacytoma), rapidl y increasing M -protein 
or light chains or high proliferative activity , plasmablastic morphology , or compromised 
renal function (CrCl < 50mL/minute) may  be at h igher risk of developing TLS.31  Also, 
subjects with t(11;14) and high bone marrow plasma cell infiltration or a significant 
number of circulating plasma cells appear to have an increased risk for TL S when treated 
with venetoclax.
Consider TL S prophy laxis with oral hy dration (at least 1 –2 liters, as tolerable, daily ) in 
all subjects at least 72 hours pri or to the first day of dosing with venetoclax.  Prophy laxis 
with uric acid reducing agents may  be required for subjects with high uric acid levels.  
Monitor for clinical and laboratory  evidence of TLS during treatment, and manage 
abnormalities in serum cre atinine, uric acid and electrol ytes promptly  according to  
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
142
institutional guidelines (Guidance also available in Appendix GRecommendations for 
Initial Management of Electrol yte Imbalances and Prevention of Tumor Lysis Sy ndrome 
(TLS) in Multiple M yeloma Subjects).  
For subjects with t(11;14) and > 50% bone marrow plasma cell infiltration or CrCl 
<50mL/min, oral h ydration as asforementioned is requir ed and chemistry  labs 
(phosphate, potassium, calcium, uric acid, creatinine, LDH, and AST at a minimum) 
should be done at approximately  6 hours after the first dose of venetoclax.  More intensive 
measures (e.g., intravenous hy dration, frequent monitoring o f labs, hospitalization, etc.) 
should be considered at the Investigator discretion or in accordance with institutional 
guidelines.  All TLS prophy laxis measures should be appropriatel y recorded in the eCRF.
In case of evidence of TLS, dosing with venetocla x should be interrupted.  Drug 
interruption for up to 72 hours following transient (i.e., lasting < 48 hours) chemical 
changes and laboratory  TLS will not require a dose reduction.
If the TLS has not resolved within 72 hours, then a dose reduction should b e considered.  
The subject may  be allowed to re -escalate to the final dose based on a risk assessment 
(including tumor burden status).  If active correction of electrol ytes was performed, the 
first dose of venetoclax should only  be given when electrol ytes have been stable without 
additional treatment for at least 24 hours.
If a subject meets criteria for clinically significant laboratory or clinical TLS, the subject 
must dose reduce (Refer to Table 19as applicable).  The subject may  be allowed to re -
escalate to the intended cohort dose based on a risk assessment (including tumor burden 
status) after discussion between the Investigator and the TA MD.
Additional TL S proph ylaxis and monitoring (more frequent lab collection, IV hy dration, 
dose ramp -up requirements, etc.) can be implemented as needed based upon review of 
safet y data (e.g., if a higher than expected rate of laboratory TLS is observed or cases of 
clinical TL S are identified).

6.1.8.5 Guidelines for Dose Modifications and Treatment
During the VenDex combination and Phase 2 cohorts, if the dose of dexamethasone is 
delay ed outside of the protocol allowed window or interrupted for an y reason
(i.e., – subject missed dose, do se held due to toxicity , etc.), the dose will be considered 
missed and the subject will continue on in the cy cle (i.e., –if Cycle 2 Day 1 dose of 
dexamethasone is held and not completed within 48 hours, Cy cle 2 Day  1 would be 
considered missed and subject would continue to be evaluated for dosing at Cy cle 2 
Day 8).  If a dose is held, all assessments listed for that day  would still be completed.
Interruption/Discontinuation of Study Drug Due to Confirmed or Suspected 
COVID -19 Infection
Subjects with a conf irmed ( SARS -Cov-2test positive) or suspected COVID -19 infection 
must interrupt all study  drugs until the following SARS -Cov-2viral clearance criteria are 
metand Covid- 19 related complications do not change the subject's risk/benefit ratio per 
Investigat or assessment.
Confirmed COVID -19 infection:
●Symptomatic subjects:  At least 2 negative viral tests in a row, ≥ 24 hours apart 
after at least 14 day s have passed since recovery , defined as resolution of fever 
without use of antipy retics and improvement in respiratory  symptoms (e.g., 
cough, shortness of breath)
●Asymptomatic subjects:  At least 2 negative viral tests in a row, ≥ 24 hours 
apart after at least 14 days have passed since prior positive result (note:  
subjects who develop s ymptoms will follow guid ance above for sy mptomatic 
subjects)
Suspected COVID -19 infection:
●Subjects with suspected COVID -19 infection should interrupt treatment with 
study  drugs while SARS -Cov-2 testing is pending.  Treatment may  be

EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
144
reinitiated upon confirmation of negative SARS -Cov-2 test result and 
notification to the AbbVie TA MD or designee.
The investigator should contact the AbbVie TA MD before reintroducing any  study  drugs 
in subjects with confirmed or suspected COVID -19 infection.
Interruptions in study  drug dosing due t o the above COVID -19 testing guidance for 
subjects must be discussed with the AbbVie TA MD, along with the possibility  of 
premature discontinuation from the study  drug dosing period.  There are no time limits for 
study  drug interruption if no permanent stu dy discontinuation criteria have been met.  
Follow protocol Section 5.3.1, Section 5.4.1, Section 5.4.2, Section 6.1.1, Section 6.1.5
and Appendix Cfor subjects who di scontinue study  drug.
Frequency  or timing of COVID -19 testing and intervals between testing for the above 
viral clearance criteria may  be adjusted to account for epidemiologic trends, updated 
information regarding infectivity , and local/institutional guide lines.
6.1.8.6 Dose Modifications or Delay s for Venetoclax Toxicities
Dose modifications and treatment guidelines for venetoclax monotherap y, Table 18, 
venetoclax with dexamethasone, Table 19, and venetoclax -related toxicities, Table 20are 
provided below.

guidelines, based on the Investigator's clinical judgment.  If the AE recurs upon increasing 
the dose of venetoclax, then the subject should re main at the reduced and tolerated dose 
level.  Guidelines in Table 4should also be followed for venetoclax -toxicity  related dose 
reductions when mode rate or strong CYP3A inhibitors are concomitantly administered.

Toxicities Recommended Action
Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutropenia 
with infection or fever; or Grade 
4 hematologic toxicities (except 
for lymphopenia)G-CSF or growth factors for neutropenia should be 
administered with venetoclax if clinically indicated.
For Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC < 500 cells/uL) w ithout 
infection, anti -infective prophylaxis 
(e.g., amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or levofloxacin or equivalent 
per institutional guidelines) is recommended until the 
neutropenia improves to Grade 3 or better (ANC 
>500cells/uL) 
First episode:  Interrupt venetoclax and once the toxicity has 
resolved to Grade 1 or baseline level, venetoclax may be 
resumed at the same dose.
For subsequent episodes:  Interrupt venetoclax.  Consider using 
G-CSF as clinically indicated.  Follow  dose reduction 
guidelines in Table 18and Table19, as applicable when 
resuming treatment with venetoclax after resolution.  A larger 
dose reduction may occur at the discre tion of the physician and 
according to the dose reduction guidelines in Table 18and 
Table 19, as applicable.
Grade ≥ 3 or Serious Infection Interrupt venetoclax and upon resolution, treatment can either 
be resumed at a reduced dose (See Table18or Table19, as 
applicable) or discontinued, at the discretion of the Investigator.  
Grade 3 or 4 non hematologic 
eventsFirst episode:  Interrupt venetoclax.  Once toxicity has resolved 
to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline, venetoclax may be resumed at the 
same dose.  No dose modification is required.
For subsequent episodes:  Interrupt venetoclax.  Follow  dose 
reduction guidelines in Table 18and Table 17, as applicable
when resuming treatment with venetoclax after resolution.  A 
larger dose reduction may occur at the discretion of the 
physician and according to the dose reduction guidelines in 
Table 18and Table19, as applicable .
Blood chemistry changes or 
symptoms suggestive of TLSWithhold the next day's dose.  If resolved within 24 –48hours 
of last dose, resume at the same dose.
For any blood chemistry changes requiring more than 48 hours 
to resolve, resume at a reduced dose (see Table 18and 
Table 19, as applicable).
For any events of clinic al TLS, resume at a reduced dose 
following resolution.

if symptoms persist.
Metabolic Hyperglycemia 
≥ Grade 3Treatment with insulin or oral hypoglycemic 
agents as needed.  If uncontrolled despite above 
measures, decrease dose by 1 dose level until 
levels are satisfactory.
6.1.11 Determination of the MTD
Escalation of venetoclax to the next designated cohort dose level will proceed if all 
assigned subjects at a dose level complete the lead -in period (if applic able) plus one cy cle 
(21 day s) at the designated cohort dose without experiencing a DLT (refer to 
Section 6.1.8.1 ).  If one (1) subject within an y dose level experiences a DLT, up to 
6subjects will be enrolled at that dose level.  Additional subjects may be enrolled at the  
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
149
current dose level at the discretion of the AbbVie TA MD.  If < 33% of the subjects 
enrolled at a dose level experience a DLT, t hen escalation of the designated cohort dose 
may continue.  If ≥33% of the subjects enrolled at a dose level experience a DLT, dose 
escalation will stop and the previous lead -in period and designated cohort dosing regimen 
will be considered the MTD.  Dose de-escalation of the designated cohort dose, and/or a 
modified lead- in period may  be explored if MTD is not declared.
If dose de -escalation or modification of the lead -in period occur and < 33% of subjects 
enrolled experience a DLT at the reduced designat ed cohort dose and/or the modified 
lead-in period regimen, this dosing regimen will be declared the MTD.  If ≥ 33% of the 
subjects enrolled at the reduced designated cohort dose and/or the modified lead- in period 
regimen still experience a DLT, dose de -escalation of the designated cohort dose and/or 
modified lead- in period regimen will continue to be explored.
The MTD will be defined as the highest designated cohort dose level (and corresponding 
lead-in period regimen, if applicable) at which < 33% of the s ubjects enrolled experience 
a DLT.
6.1.12 Determination of the RPTD
If an MTD is reached, the RPTD will not be a dose higher than the MTD and will be 
selected based on the t ypes of DLTs which occur and the MTD identified.  If an MTD is 
not reached, then the RPTD will be defined based on the safet y and PK data.
6.2 Product Complaint 
6.2.1 Definition
A Product Complaint is any  Complaint (see Section 6.0for the definition) related to the 
biologic or drug component of the product, if present (see below).
For a product this may  include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or 
packaging, product appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling  
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
150
discrepancies/ina dequacies in the labeling/instructions (example:  printing illegible), 
missing components/product, or packaging issues.
6.2.2 Reporting
Product Complaints concerning the investigational product and must be reported to the 
Sponsor within 1 business day of the stu dy site's knowledge of the event via the Product 
Complaint form.  Product Complaints occurring during the stud y will be followed- up to a 
satisfactory  conclusion.  All follow -up information is to be reported to the Sponsor (or an 
authorized representative) and documented in source as required b y the Sponsor.  Product 
Complaints associated with adverse events will be reported in the stud y summary.  All 
other complaints will be monitored on an ongoing basis.
Product Complaints may  require return of the product with the alleged complaint 
condition (sy ringe, pen, etc.).  In instances where a return is requested, every effort should 
be made b y the investigator to return the product within 30 days.  If returns cannot be 
accommodated within 30 day s, the site will ne ed to provide justification and an estimated 
date of return.
The description of the complaint is important for AbbVie in order to enable AbbVie to 
investigate and determine if an y corrective actions are required.
7.0 Protocol Deviations
AbbVie does not allow intentional/prospective deviations from the protocol except when 
necessary  to eliminate an immediate hazard to study  subjects .  The principal investigator 
is responsible for compl ying with all protocol requirements, written instructions, and 
applicable law s regarding protocol deviations.  If a protocol deviation occurs (or is 
identified, including those that may  be due to the COVID -19 pandemic) after a subject has 
been enrolled, the principal investigator is responsible for notify ing Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC)/Independent Review Board (I RB) regulatory  authorities (as applicable), 
and their assigned CRO clinical monitor or the following AbbVie clinical 
representative(s):

8.0 Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample 
Size
8.1 Statistical A nalysis Plans
8.1.1 Definition of A nalysis Population
All analy ses will be performed for all subjects who take at least one dose of study  drug.
8.1.2 Baseline Characteristics
All baseline summary statistics and analy ses will be based on characteristics prior to the 
initiation of study  drug.  Unless otherwise stated, baseline for a given variable will be 
defined as the la st value for that variable obtained prior to the first dose of study  drug.
Continuous baseline characteristics data (e.g., age, height, and weight) will be 
summarized with means, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and range.  
Frequencies and percentages will be computed for categorical data (e.g., sex, race, prior 
therapies, cy togenetics).
8.1.3 Pharmacokinetics
8.1.3.1 Tabulations and Summary  Statistics
Plasma concentrations and PK parameter values of venetoclax will be tabulated for each 
subject and each dose level, and summary  statistics will be computed for each sampling 
time and each parameter.
8.1.3.2 Model and Tests
Dose Proportionality
Pharmacokinetic parameters of venetoclax from the dose escalation subjects assessed on 
Cycle 2 Day  1 will be analy zed as follows.  An a nalysis will be performed for T max, dose 
normalized C max, dose -normalized AUC 24and β provided that they can be adequatel y 
determined from the data.  The model used for the statistical analyses will include dose  
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
153
level.  This may  be done by  classify ing subj ects by  dose level or, if appropriate, using 
dose level as a continuous variable.  Covariates such as age, bod y weight, body  surface 
area, gender, and perhaps others that might explain some of the variabilit y in the 
population will be included in the model initially .  However, a covariate may  be dropped 
from the model if the regression coefficient is not significant at alpha level 0.10.  The 
natural logarithmic transformation will be employed for C maxand the AUC's unless the 
data clearly indicate that othe r transformation or the untransformed variable provides 
more nearly  symmetric probability  distributions and/or more nearly  homogenous 
variances across dose levels.  Within the framework of the model, tests that have good 
power for a trend with dose will be performed on the effect of dose level.
Steady State Trough Hour 0 Concentrations
Exploratory  anal yses of trough (pre -dose) concentrations of venetoclax on Day  1 of 
Cycle2, 3, 5, 7 and 9 for Phase 1 and Phase 2 portion subjects combined may  be done to 
characterize the achievement of stead y-state pharmacokinetics.  Cy cle may  be included in 
the model as a categorical variable (to generate pairwise comparisons of various time 
points), or it may  be treated as a continuous variable in a regression anal ysis framework 
(where a slope of zero indicates stead y-state pharmacokinetics).  The term for dose will 
also be included in the model, and the potential interaction between cy cle and dose will be 
evaluated.
Additional analy ses will be performed if useful and app ropriate.
8.1.3.3 Missing Values and Model Violations
The possibility  of bias from missing data of subjects who prematurely  discontinue due to 
an adverse event will be addressed.  Normall y values of PK variables (C max, AUC, etc.) 
will be determined without replacing missing individual concentration values, simply  
using the available data, and if necessary doing the anal ysis with some missing values for 
a PK variable.  However, missing concentration values for isolated individual blood 
samples may  be replaced (imput ed) if such might affect study conclusions or 
meaningfully  affect point estimates.

study  drug to the date of the first documented PD or death due to an y cause, whichever 
occurs first.  All events of PD will be included, regardless of whether the event occurred 
while the subject was still taking study drug or had previously discontinued study drug.  
Events with an outcome of death will be included for subjects who had not experienced an 
event of PD.  If the subject does not have an event of PD and the subject has not died, the 
subject's data will be censored.  Detailed event and censoring information for PFS are 
provided in Table 25.

8.1.4.5 Overall Survival
For a given subject, OS is defined as the number of day s from the date of the first dose of 
study  drug to the date of the subject's death due to any  cause.  All events of death will be 
included, regardless of whether the event occurred while the subject was still taking study 
drug or after the subject discontinued study  drug.  If a subject has not dies, the data will be 
censo red at the date they  were last known to be alive.
8.1.4.6 Time to Response
For a given subject, TTR is defined as the number of day s from the date of the first dose 
of study  drug until the date of their first favorable response (i.e., PR, VGPR, CR, or sCR).  
If a subject does not experience a favorable response, they  will be censored at the date of 
last adequate assessment.
8.1.5 Statistical A nalysis of Efficacy
For the Phase 2 portion, confirmatory testing will be performed for ORR and VGPR+ 
rate, i.e.,:
1. H0a:  ORR ≤ 30% vs H 1a:  ORR > 30%
2. H0b:  VGPR+ ≤ 12% vs H 1b:  VGPR+ > 12% 
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
157
Because two tests are being performed, multiplicity control must be implemented.  The 
Hochberg procedure will be used, as follows:
●Calculate the p- value for each test, i.e., p ORRand p VGPR+
○If p ORRand p VGPR+ are both less than 0.025, reject both H 0aand H 0b, and 
declare efficacy .
○Else, if min(p ORR, pVGPR+ ) is less than 0.0125, reject either H 0aor H 0b(as 
appropriate), and declare efficacy , where min() denotes the minimum.
○Otherwise, do not decl are efficacy .
This procedure controls the family -wise error rate at 0.025 and is uniformly more 
powerful than the Bonferroni correction.
In addition, point estimates and 95% exact confidence intervals of ORR and VGPR+ rate 
will be determined for different dose groups and treatments (venetoclax and venetoclax in 
combination with dexamethasone).  The distribution of PFS, OS, TTR, TTP and DOR 
will be estimated for all subjects using Kaplan -Meier product -limit methodology .  If 
reached, median time to event and a corresponding 95% confidence interval will be 
estimated.
DOR will be anal yzed only  based on data from responders (PR or better).
For PROs, change in score from baseline will be evaluated for the following domains:  
Worst Pain (BPI -SF), Phy sical Function ing (EORTC QL Q-C30), Fatigue (PROMI S-
Fatigue), and Global Health Status/QoL  (EORTC QLQ -C30).
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize patient -reported outcomes based on the 
remaining subscales of BPI -SF, EORTC QLQ -C30, EORTC QL C-MY20, and 
EQ-5D-5L.
Additional analy sis may  be performed if deemed necessary  and helpful in understanding 
the drug effect.

8.1.5.1 Phase 2 Efficacy  Subgroup A nalysis
The Phase 2 portion of this study  may  explore potential differences in efficacy  for various 
subgroups.  Subjects may be compared b y:  age (< 65 y ears vs ≥ 65 y ears), ISS stage (I vs 
II/III), cy togenetic factors, the nature of subjects' previous therapies, and high versus low 
BCL -2:BCL -XL ratio.
In particular, the presentation of I MWG response rates (including ORR and VGP R+ rates) 
and time -to-event endpoints (PFS, OS, and DOR) may  be broken down by  subgroup 
membership.
8.1.6 Statistical A nalysis of Safety
The safet y of venetoclax monotherap y and venetoclax plus dexamethasone (combination 
and Phase 2) will be assessed by evaluati ng study  drug exposure, adverse events, serious 
adverse events, deaths, and changes in laboratory  values and vital sign parameters.
8.1.6.1 Duration of Study Drug Exposure
A summary  of the number of day s and/or cy cles subjects were exposed to study  drug will 
be provided.
8.1.6.2 Adverse Events
Analy ses of adverse events will include only  "treatment -emergent" events, i.e., those that 
have an onset on or after the day  of the first dose of the study  drug.  Anal yses will not 
include those that have an onset greater than 30 d ays after the last dose of the study  drug.
Treatment -emergent adverse events will be coded and summarized by  system organ class 
and preferred term according to the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA)27adverse event coding dictionary.  The percentage of subjects experiencing 
an adverse event will be provided b y relationship to study drug and b y NC I CTCAE

regardless of the number of day s after the last dose of study  drug.
8.1.6.5 Longitudinal A nalyses of Laboratory  and Vital Signs Data
Changes from baseline will be summarized for each scheduled post -baseline visit and for 
the Final Visit blood chemistry , hematology , urinaly sis, and vital sign parameters, where 
applicabl e.  If more than one measurement exists for a subject on a particular day , an 
arithmetic average will be calculated.  This average will be considered to be that subject's 
measurement for that day.  Post -baseline measurements more than 30 days after the las t 
dose of study  drug will not be included.  Subjects that do not have a baseline 
measurement or do not have an y post baseline measurements will not be included.
8.1.6.6 Analyses of Laboratory  Data Using NCI CTCA E
Where applicable, laboratory  values will be categor ized according to the NCI  CTCAE 
version 4.03)26grades, and shifts from baseline grade to maximum and final post -baseline 
grades will be assessed.  The baseline and final grades will be defined respectivel y as the 
grade of the last measurement collected prior to the first dose of stud y drug, and as the 
grade of the last post -baseline measurement collected no more than 30 days after the last 
dose of study  drug.  If multiple values are available for a post baseline measurement, then 
the value with the highest NCI  CTCAE grade will be used in the assessment of shift.  The 
percentage of subjects experiencing a s hift from baseline grades of 0 to 2 to maximum 
post-baseline grades of 3 to 4, and from baseline grades of 0 to 2 to final post -baseline 
grades of 3 to 4 will be summarized.

Detailed listings of data for subjects experiencing NCI  CTCAE grades 3 to 4 blood 
chemistry  and hematology  values will be provided.  All measurements collected, 
regardless of the number of day s after the last dose of study  drug, will be included in these 
listings.
8.1.6.7 Analyses of Vital Signs Using Criteria for Potentially  
Clinically  Significant Vital Sign Values
Detailed listings of data for subjects experiencing potentially  clinicall y significant vital 
sign values according to the AbbVie -defined criteria for vital sign values will be provided.  
All measurements collected, regardless of the number of day s after the last dose of study  
drug, will be included in these listings.
8.1.7 Biomarkers and Exploratory  Research Variables 
If biomarkers and/or exploratory  end point data are determined from the collected 
samples, an y statistical analyses of thes e data are outside the scope of this protocol and 
may be reported separately  from the final clinical study  report.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
The Phase 1 portion is a dose escalation study .  The number of subjects required will 
depend upon the toxicities observed as the trial progresses.  Once MTD is reached and 
RPTD is determined, approximately  36 additional subjects will be enrolled at the MTD 
(or RPTD) of venetoclax into the safet y expansion portion.
The safet y expansion portion will evaluate the MTD ( or RPTD) defined during the dose 
escalation portion of the study  to provide increased precision in the estimation of safet y 
parameters for different Bcl -2 family  expression profiles.  Each of these Bcl -2 expression 
family  profiles will include approximatel y 12 additional subjects, as the probablilty of 
observing at least one dose -limiting adverse event in 12 subjects is 99% if the true but 
unknown dose limiting adverse event rate is 33%. 
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
161
The VenDex combination portion will explore the safet y and efficacy of venetoclax in 
combination with dexamethasone in subjects with t(11;14) -positive MM.  Approximately  
18 additional subjects will be enrolled as the probability to observe at least one occurrence 
of an adverse event is ≥ 85%, if the true incidence of the res pective adverse event rate is 
≥10%.
The primary  objective of the Phase 2 portion of the study  is to test (a) H 0a:  ORR ≤ 30% 
against H 1a:  ORR > 30% and (b) H 0b:  VGPR+ rate ≤ 12% against H 1b:  VGPR+ rate 
>12%.  These h ypotheses will be tested using a fa mily-wise one -sided t ype-I error rate of 
0.025.  The Hochberg procedure will be used to control for multiplicity .  This part of the 
study  is powered for a true ORR of 50% and a true VGPR+ rate of 30%.  Under the 
considerations above, if at least 80 subject s are enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of the 
study , there will be over 95% power to reject H 0a, 96% power to reject H 0b, 92% power to 
reject both H 0aand H 0b, and 99% power to declare efficacy  (due to high ORR, high 
VGPR+ rate, or high values of both).
9.0 Ethics
9.1 Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requires that the clinical protocol, an y protocol 
amendments, the Investigator's Brochure, the informed consent and all other forms of 
subject inform ation related to the study  (e.g., advertisements used to recruit subjects) and 
any other necessary  documents be reviewed by an IEC/IRB.  The IEC/IRB will review the 
ethical, scientific and medical appropriateness of the study before it is conducted.  
IEC/I RB approval of the protocol, informed consent and subject information and/or 
advertising, as relevant, will be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a 
study  site.
Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/I RB approval and approval b y 
Regulatory  Authority  (ies), if required by  local regulations, prior to implementation of an y 
changes made to the study design.  The investigator will be required to submit, maintain  
Venetoclax (ABT -199)
M13 -367 Protocol Amendment 1 2
EudraCT 2012 -000589 -38
162
and archive study  essential documents according to I CH GCP and all other applicable 
regulatory  requirements.
Serious adverse events that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated b y local regulations, 
will be reported to both responsible Ethics Committees and Regulatory Agencies as 
required b y local regulations.  During the con duct of the study , the investigator should 
promptly  provide written reports (e.g., ICH Expedited Reports or any additional reports 
required b y local regulations) to the IEC/I RB of any  changes that affect the conduct of the 
study  and/or increase the risk to subjects.  Written documentation of the submission to the 
IEC/IRB should also be provided to AbbVie.
9.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, International Conference on 
Harmonization (I CH) GCP guidelines, applicable regulations and guidelines governing 
clinical study  conduct and ethical principles that have their origin in the Declara tion of 
Helsinki.  Responsibilities of the clinical investigator are specified in Appendix A.
In the event a significant disaster/crisis (e.g., epid emic/pandemic, natural disaster, 
conflict/combat) occurs leading to difficulties in performing protocol -specified 
procedures, AbbVie may engage with stud y site personnel in efforts to ensure the safet y 
of subjects, maintain protocol compliance, and minimiz e risks to the integrity of the stud y 
while try ing to best manage subject continuity  of care.  This may  include alternative 
methods for assessments (e.g., phone contacts or virtual site visits), alternative locations 
for data collection (e.g., use of a loc al lab instead of a central lab), and shipping 
investigational product and/or supplies direct to subjects to ensure continuity of treatment 
where allowed.  COVID -19 pandemic -related acceptable protocol modifications are 
detailed throughout the protocol.  I n all cases, these alternative measures must be allowed 
by local regulations and permitted by  IRB/IEC.

9.3 Subject Information and Consent
The Investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
subject and answer all questions r egarding this study .  Prior to an y stud y-related screening 
procedure being performed on the subject the informed consent statement will be 
reviewed, signed and dated by the subject, the person who administered the informed 
consent, and any other signatorie s according to local requirements.  A copy of the 
informed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the 
subject's medical record.  An entry  must also be made in the subject's dated source 
documents to confirm that inform ed consent was obtained prior to an y study -related 
procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
Information regarding incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for 
treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation 
in the study  can be found in the informed consent form.
Pharmacogenetic anal ysis will only  be performed if the subject has voluntarily  signed and 
dated a pharmacogenetic informed consent, approved by  an IRB/IEC, after the nature of
the testing has been explained and the subject has had an opportunity to ask questions.  
The pharmacogenetic informed consent must be signed before the pharmacogenetic 
testing is performed.  If the subject does not consent to the pharmacogenetic testing, it will 
not impact the subject 's participation in the study .
In the event a subject withdraws consent to participate from the stud y, stored biomarker 
and exploratory  research samples will continue to be used for research and anal ysis.  In 
the event that a subject would like to withdraw consent for research using these samples, 
the subject may  request that their samples be withdrawn.  Once AbbVie receives the 
request, remaining biomarker and exploroatory research samples will be destroyed.  If the 
subject ch anges his/her consent, and the samples have alread y been tested, those results 
will still remain as part of the overall research data.

a. All response categories require two consecutive assessments made at any time before the institution of any new 
therapy; all categories also require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies 
were performed.  Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements.
b. Confirmation with repeat bone marrow biopsy not needed.
c. Presence/absence of clonal cells is based upon the k/λ ratio.  An abnormal k/λ ratio by immunohistochemi stry 
and/or immunofluorescence requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis.  An abnormal ratio reflecting 
presence of an abnormal clone is k/λ of > 4:1 or < 1:2.
d. Measurable disease is defined as meeting at least one of the following four measure ments:  serum M -protein 
≥ 1g/dL ( ≥ 10 g/L) or urine M -protein ≥ 200 mg/24 hr or serum FLC assay with an involved FLC level 
≥10mg/dL ( ≥ 100 mg/L) provided serum FLC ration is abnormal or bone marrow plasma cells ≥ 30%.
e. Not recommended for use as an indicator of response; stability of disease is best described by providing the time to 
progression estimates.
* Serum and urine M -protein testing is required to fulfill requirements of VGPR and CR categories regardless of 
whether disease at baseline was meas urable on serum, urine, both, or neither.
** Clarification to IMWG criteria for coding CR and VGPR in patients in whom the only measurable disease is by 
serum FLC levels:  CR in such patients is defined as a normal FLC ratio of 0.26 –1.65 in addition to CR criteria 
listed above.  VGPR in such patients is defined as a > 90% decrease in the difference between involved and 
uninvolved free light chain FLC levels.

Notes:
* Clarification to IMWG criteria for coding CR and VGPR in sub jects whom the only measurable disease is by 
serum FLC levels.  In these subjects, CR is defined as a normal FLC ratio of 0.26 to 1.65 in addition to CR criteria 
listed above, and VGPR is defined as a ≥ 90% decrease in the difference between involved and u ninvolved FLC 
levels.
** Serum and urine M -protein testing is required to fulfill requirements of VGPR and CR categories regardless of 
whether disease at baseline was measurable in serum, urine, both, or neither.
a. All response categories require 2 consecutive assessments made at any time before the institution of any new 
therapy; all categories also require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions or extramedullary 
plasmacytomas if radiographic studies were performed.  Radiographic studi es are not required to satisfy these 
response requirements.
b. Confirmation with repeat bone marrow biopsy not needed.
c. Presence/absence of clonal cells on immunohistochemistry is based upon the k/λ ratio.  An abnormal k/λ ratio by 
immunohistochemistry requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis.  An abnormal ratio reflecting presence 
of an abnormal clone is k/λ of > 4:1 or < 1:2.
d. Measurable disease is defined as meeting at least one of the following 3 measurements:  serum M -protein ≥ 1g/dL 
(≥10g/L) or urine M -protein ≥ 200 mg/24 hours or serum FLC assay with an involved FLC level ≥ 10mg/dL 
(≥100 mg/L) provided serum FLC ration is abnormal.
e. Not recommended for use as an indicator of response; stability of disease is best described by pro viding the time to 
progression estimates.
f. Plasmacytoma measurements should be taken from the CT portion of the PET/CT, or MRI scans, or dedicated CT 
scans where applicable.  For patients with only skin involvement, skin lesions should be measured with a ruler.  
Measurement of tumor size will be determined by the SPD.

Appendix G. Recommendations for Initial Management of Electrolyte 
Imbalances and Prevention of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) in 
Multiple Myeloma Subjects
Section 1:  First Dose of Venetoclax or Dose Escalation
●Within the first 24 hours after either the first dose or dose escalation, if an y
laboratory  criteria below are met, the subject should be hospitalized for
monitoring and the Investigator notified.  No additional venetoclax doses 
should be administered until resolution.  A rapidly rising serum potassium is a 
medical emergency .
●Nephrolo gy (or acute dialy sis service or other) should be contacted/consulted 
on admission (per institutional standards to ensure emergency dial ysis is 
available) for an y subject who is high risk for T LS being hospitalized in 
response to laboratory  chang es or per Investigator discretion.
●IV fluids (e.g., D5 1/2 normal saline) initiated at a rate of at least 1 mL/kg/hr 
rounded to the nearest 10 mL  (target 150 to 200 mL/hr; not < 50mL/hr).  
Modification of fluid rate should also be considered for individuals with 
specific medical needs.
●Monitor for sy mptoms or signs of TLS (e.g., fever, chills, tachycardia, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, hypotension, muscle aches, weakness, 
paresthesias, mental status changes, confusion, seizures). If any clinical 
features are observed, recheck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and 
creatinine within 1 hour immediately .
●Vital signs should be taken at time of all blood draws or an y Intervention.
●The management recommendations below focus on the minimum initial 
respon ses required.  If a diagnosis of TLS is established, ongoing intensive 
monitoring and multi -disciplinary  management will be per institutional 
protocols.

Section 2:  Ongoing Dosing of Venetoclax
Management of electrol yte changes from last value a t intervals > 24 hours after either the 
first dose or dose escalation (e.g., 48 or 72 hours) is as below.
Note :  If the patient is hospitalized, no additional venetoclax doses should be administered 
until resolution.
●For potassium, admit patient for an y increase ≥ 1.0 mmol/L  (1.0 mEq/L), or 
any level > upper limit of normal.
○Refer to the management guidelines for electrol yte changes observed 
within the first 24 hours after either the first dose or dose escalation 
(seeprior table).
●If a smaller potassium increase is observed that does not meet the criteria for 
admission above, recheck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium and 
creatinine in 24 hours and confirm no evidence of tumor ly sis prior to further 
venetoclax dosing.
●For uric acid, calcium, phosphorus and creatinine, refer to the management 
guidelines for electrol yte changes observed within the first 24 hours after 
either the first dose or dose escalation (see prior table).

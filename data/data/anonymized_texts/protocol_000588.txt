1.0 OBJECTIVES  1.1 Describe  the purpose,  specific  aims,  or objectives.  
For phase  1, quantitative  part:  
Specific  aim 1:  Identify  the efficacy  of cold  versus  hot debriefing  in (Basic  Life Support)  BLS 
training for undergraduate nursing students'  BLS competence.  
 
Specific  aim 2: Assess  the impact  of hot and cold  debriefing  on senior  or third  year  nursing 
students' debriefing experience.  
 
For phase  2 qualitative  part:  
Specific  aim 3: Explore  the experiences  of undergraduate  nursing  students  who  used  the 
cold and hot debriefing style in BLS training.  
 
Specific  aim 4: To identify  the similarities  and differences  in reflective  thinking  between 
undergraduate nursing students who used hot and cold debriefing.  
1.2 Describe  the hypotheses  to be tested.  
Hypothesis  1a: In both  cold  and hot debriefing  groups,  there  is a significant difference  in 
the BLS competence of undergraduate nursing students between pre -intervention and 
post -intervention.  
Hypothesis  1b: Undergraduate  nursing  students  who  have  cold  debriefing  will 
show greater BLS competence than those who receive hot debriefing.  
 
Hypothesis  2: There  is a significant  difference  in debriefing  experience  scores  of 
undergraduate nursing students between hot and cold debriefing.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.0 BACKGROUND  2.1 Describe  the relevant  prior  experience  and gaps  in the current  knowledge.  
Cardiac arrest is  one of the leading  causes  of death globally; the number  of out -of-hospital 
cardiac arrests in  the U.S. exceeds  356,000 per  year. Nearly 90% of them  are fatal (Tsao et 
al., 2022). Over the years, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has been proven to be 
associated with patient survival (Oermann et al., 2020). The American Heart Association 
(AHA) and European Resuscitation Council recommend high -qualit y CPR following a 
cardiac  arrest  to improve  patient  outcomes  and survival  rates  (Cheng  et al., 2018;  Wolfe  et 
al., 2014). Basic Life Support (BLS) is an essential element in simulation for nursing 
students. The primary goal of BLS is to enable nurses to pr ovide resuscitation to  
individuals experiencing cardiac or pulmonary arrests (The Association for the 
Advancement of Sustainability, 2019). According to the literature, even if undergraduate  
nursing  students are  BLS certified, they frequently  lack the comp rehensive  knowledge and 
competence  of BLS (Oermann  et al., 2020).  This lack of knowledge  and competence  can be

 affected  by the type  and effectiveness  of the debriefing  provided  to the students  after  the 
BLS simulation session (Couper & Perkins, 2013).  
Debriefing is an essential component of simulation -based learning to achieve desired 
learning outcomes through student self -reflection and constructive discussion with 
instructors or peers. (Cheng et al., 2015; Kim & De Gagne, 2018; Sawyer et al., 2016; 
Sweberg et al., 2018). Yun and Kang (2022) conducted an integrative review where they 
highlighted various types of debriefing, and its effect on nursing education, except for the 
effectiveness of hot and cold debriefing.  Results of the review by Yun and Kang  (2022) 
could not conclude whether hot or cold debriefing is better than the other due to the 
scarcity of the paper investigating this concept. In the literature, "hot" debriefings occur 
within  minutes  to hours  of the simulation,  whereas  "cold"  debriefings  occur  within  days  to 
weeks (Couper & Perkins, 2013). Hot debriefing could identify and address several 
reported care errors, including delays in treatment defibrillation, airway insertion, drug 
administration, equipment issues, and suboptimal leadership ( Couper & Perkins, 2013).  
However,  without  the instant  availability  of a CPR code  summary,  hot debriefing  is unlikely 
to have a significant influence on CPR quality (Couper & Perkins, 2013). Furthermore, an 
inadequate emotional preparedness of learners to d ebrief might be a disadvantage with 
hot debriefing (Kessler et al., 2015). Nevertheless, cold debriefing provides some 
significant advantages to hot debriefing. Firstly, because meetings take place many days 
after the resuscitation attempt, performance dat a can be gathered, analyzed, and 
integrated into the debrief (Couper & Perkins, 2013; Kessler et al., 2015). Therefore, this 
gap enables learners to reflect on their performance during the resuscitation event.  
Another advantage of cold  debriefing is that t he debriefing data is available for all of the 
learners, and they can learn from each other’s experiences (Couper & Perkins, 2013; 
Kessler et al., 2015). In addition, the data of cold debriefing can be gathered by video 
recording, performance summary, and defibrillator downloads (Couper & Perkins, 2013; 
Kessler et al., 2015). Yet, cold debriefing has limitations that include the necessity to 
schedule  additional  time  and space  for debriefing,  the requirement  to assemble  students 
who  participated  in the simulation  to debrief,  and the risk of forgetting  simulation  events 
(Kessler et al., 2015).  
2.2 Describe  any relevant  preliminary  data.  
Not Applicable  
2.3 Provide the scientific or scholarly background for, rationale for, and 
significance  of the research  based  on the existing  literature  and how  it will add to 
existing  knowledge.  
Nurses  must  be knowledgeable  and skilled  in BLS to provide  positive  outcomes  in terms  of 
patient survival after cardiopulmonary arrest (Pareek et al., 2018). Not only is  the BLS 
training a vital subject for nurses but also it is required for practicing nurses. A study 
conducted by Pareek et al. (2018) aimed to identify the efficacy of BLS training for nurses 
on the mortality rate and discovered that the percentage of retu rn of spontaneous  
circulation  increased  from  19.7%  pre-intervention  to 30.1%  post -intervention  (P = 0.003).

 In order  to have  a well -structured  simulation  experience, debriefing  plays  an essential  role 
in the learning process. It improves the performance of individuals, teams, and systems 
(Abulebda et al., 2022). In simulation tra ining, debriefing is one of the essential tools 
recommended following  cardiopulmonary arrest  events (Abulebda et al.,  2022). Yet,  more 
than 70% of participants who witnessed CPR did not debrief post -CPR events (Khpal & 
Coxwell Matthewman, 2016). Additional ly, although AHA recommends debriefing for BLS, 
debriefing is still delivered in hot format or not delivered at all (Couper & Perkins, 2013). 
Thus,  this proposed  study  will shed  light  on the importance  of debriefing  by comparing  the 
efficacy of hot and col d debriefing on undergraduate nursing students' BLS competence 
and which debriefing method appears to be more advantageous from students' 
perspectives of their learning experience. Even though other studies investigated the 
significance of cold debriefing (Wolfe et al., 2020), none of the studies recruited nursing 
students . Moreover, novice learners lack context compared to proficient staff who have 
the context (Persky & Robinson, 2017). It is anticipated that results from this study will 
determine the effi cacy of hot and cold debriefing styles on novice learners, the  
significance of  debriefing  to the  simulation  experience,  and assist  in improving  the way we 
debrief in nursing education. Hence, conducting larger scale studies to further test the 
efficacy  of hot and cold  debriefing  will be recommended.  Moreover, the  study  will identify 
vital themes that will emerge from nurses in the qualitative part. Qualitative findings will 
enable us to explore the experiences and differences in the reflective thinking of 
undergraduate nursing students who used the cold versus hot debriefing style in BLS 
training. The outcomes of this study will advance nursing education in the way we teach 
undergraduate students about BLS. Thus, having competent nurses will positively impac t 
patient outcomes (Pareek et al., 2018).

6.0 PROCEDURES 
INVOLVED  6.1 Thoroughly  describe  the study  design.  
This study consists of two phases. Phase 1 will be a randomized controlled trial (RCT). 
Having  a controlled group  is the gold standard  to measure the  efficacy  of an intervention 
(Polit  & Beck,  2021).  RCTs  provide  the most  persuasive  evidence  on whether  one variable 
has a causal influence on another. RCTs' main strength is the certainty with which causal 
links may be  determined.  Kolb's learning  theory serves  as the  underpinning  for this study 
(Kolb & Kolb, 2009; Kolb, 1984).  
Manipulation:  The researcher  will do a cold  debriefing  (after  one-day post -simulation)  for 
undergraduate nursing students in the intervention group.  
Control: The control group will do a hot debriefing (immediately after the simulation). 
Randomizatio n: The researcher  will assign  the participants  to a control  or experimental 
based on number generator.  
Once participants complete Phase 1, we will record their progress on REDCap. If they 
chose to only participate in Phase 1, we will  mark their status as "completed" on REDCap. 
If they  expressed  interest  in Phase  2, we will randomly  select  16 participants  from  the pool 
based on a number generator and update their status on REDCap for Phase 2.  
Outcome: The study outcome is BLS competenc e level. The competence level will be 
measured  AHA  (2020)  BLS competency  Checklist.  First,  the control  and experiment  groups  
will complete  a pre-test on BLS competence.  Both  groups  will do a pre-test.  After  finishing

 the pre -test, we will do the randomization process. Then the intervention group will 
receive  (cold  debriefing);  the control  group  will have  the (hot  debriefing).  Both  groups  will 
do the post -test immediately after the debriefing session and another post -test after 24 
hours of the first post -test.  
 
For phase 2, we will do a qualitative descriptive design with focus group s interview. 
Themes  relating  to hot and cold  debriefing  will be generated  using  a focused  qualitative 
interview technique. Focused interviews are loosely structured interviews in which the 
interviewer guides the participant through a set of questions (Polit & Beck, 2021).  
Throughout  the guide,  participants  are encouraged  to share  their  own  experiences  and 
discuss all topics freely. Researchers can obtain all necessary information utilizing this 
technique, and participants will have the capability to pr ovide illustrations and 
explanations (Polit & Beck, 2021).  
 
 
6.2 Detail the procedures being performed, specifically the interaction or 
intervention with human subjects and/or their identifiable information. Please 
be clear and concise and provide information relevant to the current study. For 
example,  please  be sure  that  what  will be done  for this research  is explained  and 
differentiated from activities that have already taken place or will be submitted 
for future review. Please note that details about recruitment and consent are  
asked  in later  questions.  
Potential participants will access the REDCap  link to answer the eligibility questions (1) if 
they are above 18 years of age and (2) if they are senior or third year undergraduate 
nursing students. If they are eligible, they will enter their demographic on REDCap. After 
that, The PI will assign the p articipants to a hot or cold debriefing group based on a 
number generator.  Participants will do a baseline BLS competence where they will do a 
simulation experience related to the  competence of  BLS, which is  conducted as  part of  the 
study  design.  There  will be a scenario  about  a nurse  taking  care  of their  client  at a hospital, 
and when the nurse enters the client's room to check on their client, they find that their 
client is unresponsive. Nursing students are expected to start the process of Basic Life  
support.  Nursing  students  are expected  in the simulation  to check  the client's

responsiveness, activate the cardiopulmonary arrest code, begin cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation, and give 30 compressions and 2 breaths. They will attach an automated 
external  defibrillator  and follow  the instruction  of the machine.  The total  scenario  will last 
up to 5 minutes.  
Another interaction with participants will be the debriefing experiences, where students 
will do a group debriefing. Afterward, participants in the hot debrief group will do their 
post -test immediately after their debrief on the same d ay as the simulation, and another 
post -test after 24 hours of the first post -test. And then, the cold debrief participants will 
do the simulation, wait 24 hours, have the debrief, and will do an immediate post -test, 
and another post -test after 24 hours of the first post -test. The simulation will be 
conducted in order to complete the BLS assessment checklist at baseline, post -test, and 
second post -test. The same simulation and BLS Assessment checklist will be conducted at 
baseline, post -test, and second post -test. The BLS competence and DES will be 
administered  online  via REDCap.  During  the qualitative  phase,  participants  will engage  in a 
focus group which will be the final interaction. Random sampling will be used to select 
subsamples from both hot and cold groups for the focus group..  
6.3 Describe  procedures  being  performed  to monitor  subjects  for safety  or 
minimize risks.  
The study carries minimal risk. Potential participants will not be expected to expose 
more  than  what  they  might  face  in a simulation  experience  that they  are familiar  with. 
Participants will be informed that they can choose to participate or not and can 
withdraw at any time. They can also decline to answer any questions that make them 
uncomfortable. The PI will receive training from the Co -PI/Faculty Advisor to monitor 
participants for any  psychological  stress during study  phases. The  PI and  Co-PI/Faculty 
Advisor wil l meet weekly to discuss interactions with participants and ensure that the 
procedures for managing data protect confidentiality.  
6.5 Where  applicable,  list and describe  the data  collection  tools  such  as surveys, 
data collection forms, etc. All tools described should be uploaded in the RAP 
Smart Form on the Local Site Documents page unless they are standardized,

The baseline  BLS Competence level  will be  measured  via the  AHA (2020)  BLS competency  checklist. The 
BLS Competence assessment will be conducted by the primary investigator and/or Dr. Wagner (Co -PI). 
All of the tests  (Baseline,  post -test,  and second  post -test)  will be measured  by the same  tool of the AHA 
(2020) BLS competency check list. The simulation will be conducted in order to complete the BLS 
assessment checklist at baseline, post -test, and second post -test. The same simulation and BLS 
Assessment checklist will be conducted at baseline, post -test, and second post -test.

Phase  2 
The data collection will use a Semi -structured interview, the most common sort of interview 
used in this methodology, and it is the primary method of data collection (DeJonckheere & 
Vaughn, 2019). It will be included open -ended questions related to the participants' overall 
experi ence in terms of emotions, feelings, challenges, and learning. All the interviews will be 
conducted  in a private  place,  and the PI will do all the interviews  so the participants'  interactions 
and questions will be consistent.  
The general  initial  questions  will be the same  for the hot and cold  debriefing  group  are: 
(1) Tell me about  your  experience  with  simulation  and what  that’s  looked  like for you?  
(2) Tell me about  your  experience  in debriefing?

nursing skills.  
(8) How  did debriefing  impact  your  confidence  in performing  at the bedside?  
(9) Do you have  any advice  for educators  who  are designing  simulation  scenarios?  
(10) Is there  anything  else you would  like to share?   
6.6 Describe all  data  that  will be accessed  and collected  during  the study  and how  that  data  
 will be obtained  (how  it will be accessed).   
All data  that will be accessed  and collected  during  the study  is described  in Section  6.5 above.  
 
The PI will ask permission from the student affairs office of the undergraduate nursing student to send 
an email to potential participants. Potential participants will be contacted via the UC email, and we will 
post flyers  in the  simulation  lab at the  CON.  Potential  participants will  access the  REDCap  link or scan  the 
QR code to answer  the eligibility questions (1) if  they are above  18 years  of age and (2) if  they are  senior 
or third year undergraduate nursing students. The potential participant will also indicate in REDCap if 
they want to participate in phase 2 (focus group). In case there are over 16 participants who want to 
participate in ph ase 2, we will randomly choose 8 participants from the hot debriefing group and  
another 8 participants from the cold debriefing group. If they are eligible, they will enter their contact 
details,  such  as their  name,  email,  and phone  number(s)  on REDCap.  Alternatively,  they  may  also contact 
the PI  via email  or phone.  Once a potential participant's response is  received, the PI  will contact them to 
verify their eligibility and contact information.  
For phase  1: 
The quantitative data will be stored electronically in the University of Cincinnati's server using REDCap, 
which offers several features, including a user -friendly interface for validated data entry, audit trails to 
track data manipulation and user activit y, automated export procedures for seamless data downloads 
while maintaining confidentiality, and importing data from external sources. REDCap will be used to 
securely manage the electronic data collected during the study, and only authorized personnel wil l be 
given  access.  The university  backs  up REDCap  nightly.  To ensure  confidentiality,  study  ID numbers  will be 
generated for data analysis  to protect  the participants'  identity  in the  final data set. REDCap  will be used 
to efficiently export de -identified data to statistical software packages.  
For phase  2: 
Audio  recordings  will be captured  through  an audio  recording  device  - EVIDA  V618  portable  digital  voice  
recorder.  After  that,  audio  recordings  will be saved  to an encrypted  drive  that is password  protected  and

 backed up daily. All electronic devices will be secured and have anti-virus software. All the paper notes 
will be scanned  and saved  as digital  files.  After  scanning  the papers,  they  will be destroyed  by shredding 
immediately.  
Audio recordings will be transcribed by an independent transcriptionist who will de -identify the 
transcripts.  We will not collect  any private  identifiable  information  from participants  (other  than  audio 
transcripts).

 The cold  debriefing  group  will need  3 days  to complete  phase  1, while  hot debriefing  will need  only  2 
days to complete phase 1.  
Both the hot and cold debriefing groups have the same time for participation; however, the cold group 
will need to arrive 24 hours after the simulation experience. Participants in the cold group will require 
additional  time  for transportation  and scheduling  a different  day for the research  activity.  Therefore,  the 
PI will give an additional $25 Amazon giftcard to compensate.

WITHDRAWAL  OF 
SUBJECTS  14.1  Describe  the anticipated  circumstances  under  which  subjects  will be withdrawn  by the 
study  team  from  the research  without  their  consent.  
Because this study presents a minimal risk, it is not anticipated that any potential participants will be 
withdrawn from the study. In case they feel uncomfortable or distressed in the study, they can stop, 
take  a break,  and re-join.  Participants  have  the right  to withdraw  themselves  from  the study  at any time 
and will never be persuaded to participate in research activities that they refuse. If participants refuse 
any part of the study, that data will be considered missing.  
 
Study  participants  will be withdrawn  by the study  team  without  their  consent  if the study  team  cannot 
contact them to complete phase 1 of the study.  
Participating  to phase  2 is optional,  if a participant  completes  Phase 1  but cannot  be contacted  to 
complete Phase, their Phase 1 data will not be deleted.  
14.2  Describe  any procedures  for orderly  termination.  
The participants have the liberty to withdraw from the study at any  point, and the study team can also 
withdraw  them  if they  cannot  be contacted.  Participants  can inform  the PI of their  decision  to withdraw 
verbally,  via voicemail,  or email. If the study team  is unable to  contact  a participant, they  may  receive  a 
voicemai l stating that they have been withdrawn from the study due to non -contactability.  
14.3 Describe procedures that will be followed when subjects withdraw from the research, 
including  partial  withdrawal  from procedures  with  continued  data  collection,  withdrawal  of 
previously collected data upon request, etc.  
Potential  participants  have  the right  to withdraw  themselves  from  the study  at any time,  and will never 
be persuaded to participate in research activities that they refuse. If potential participants refuse any 
part of the study, further data collection will be stopped, and that data will be considered missing.  
Previously  collected  data  will be withdrawn  upon  request.

Their  academic  performance  will not be impacted  if they  choose  not to participate.  The primary  PI is not 
a faculty member at  UC-CON and has no direct relationship with participants. They will not be expected 
to expose more than what  they might face in a  simulation experience that you are familiar with. In case 
they feel uncomfortable or  distressed in the study,  they can  stop, take a break, and re -join. If they want 
to withdraw at any time, they can. In case of persistent stress or discomfort, the student s' wellbeing 
center is ready to help them.  
To maintain confidentiality, a study ID number will be used instead of actual names on all research 
forms. All data will be kept on password -protected secure REDCap and OneDrive at the University of 
Cincinnati.  The contact  details  of the participant  will be stored  within  REDCap  and Microsoft  Outlook  for 
UC. After verifying the accuracy of the transcripts, PI will proceed to destroy all digital recordings. After 
the analysis and distribution of data, the study will be finalized, and any identifiable information will be 
removed. The remaining data will be stored  on a secure, password -protected research OneDrive, which 
only the PI and faculty advisor can access. All research data will be de -identified. Investigators' 
usernames and passwords are required to access the data in REDCap.  
The audio recordings will be held at a private place in the UC College of Nursing or in a secure virtual 
room.  The audio  recordings of a  qualitative focus group will take place  in a secure v irtual room,  only if 
the participants  choose to  conduct the interview in  that setting. If the  participants prefer an  in-person 
focus group, then a secure virtual room may not be necessary. The audio recordings will be stored on 
password -protected  secure  REDCap  and UC OneDrive.  The transcribed  interviews  will be stored  by the 
PI (in a de-identified  form)  on his UC OneDrive  as per the as the UC data  retention  policy  allows.  Agents

17.0 DATA 
MANAGEMENT 
AND 
CONFIDENTIALITY  17.1  Describe  the data  analysis  plan,  including  any statistical  procedures  or power  analyses.  
For quantitative phase 1, Statistical power G*Power 3.1 was used to determine sample size based on a 
2-tailed, two -way repeated measure ANOVA for the design, a type I error of 0.05, a statistical power of 
80% (type II error), and a large effect size of eta square .25 -.99 (Faul et al., 2007). Based on the 
literature, a large effect size is appropriate for the use of simulation (Padi lha et al., 2019; Pauly -O'Neill, 
2009). Based on G*Power 3.1, the recommended sample size will be 26 participants in each group. Still, 
because  there  is a possibility  that participants  may  withdraw  from  the study,  the total  number  will be 30 
participants i n each group. There is a total of 183 eligible participants.  
Statistical  Plan 
The statistical analysis will be used by JMP Pro 16 software. The descriptive analysis for students' 
demographics will be computed to describe means, standard deviations, and fre quencies. For  
hypothesis 1a, the appropriate statistical analysis test will be the repeated measure ANOVA to find the 
difference between  the experimental and  control group  in pre and  post -intervention. For  hypothesis  1b, 
an independent t -test will be used to find the differences between the two groups in the BLS 
competence level. The p -value of <0.05 will be considered statistically significant, and the confidence 
interval will be set at 95%. If the p -value is less than 0.05, we will reject the null hypothe sis; If the p - 
value  is more  than  0.05,  we will fail to reject  the null hypothesis.  For hypothesis  2, an independent  t-test 
will be used to compare means between hot debriefing and cold debriefing groups. DES with P -values  
<0.05  will be considered  statisti cally  significant.  
 
For Qualitative phase 2 ,  thematic analysis will be used because it is applicable to the aim of our study 
(Doyle et al., 2020). All transcripts will be transcribed by a transcriptionist. All transcripts will be 
uploaded to MAXQDA 2020, a qualitative analysis software. Two research ers will examine each  
interview transcript thoroughly on their own to ensure that the data is complete. The researchers then 
read and reread each interview individually, looking for keywords or phrases that defined participants' 
experiences and views of de briefing methods. We will use line -by-line coding, writing 1 or 2 words that 
will indicate  what  was stated (Creswell  & Poth,  2018).  Data  will be  coded according  to their  meaning  and 
focuses on categorizing participant experiences and perceptions. Frequentl y recurring codes with the 
same content will be classified and compared consistently across transcripts. We will combine 
comparable and overlapping categories into a single category (theme) (Creswell & Poth, 2018).This  
classifying  procedure  will record  participants'  overall  views  of their  experiences.  
17.2  Describe  the steps  that  will be taken to  secure  the data.  
To ensure the security of data, any paper forms containing research data will be kept in a file cabinet 
that is locked  in a locked  office.  The data  will be entered  into either  a password -protected  computer,  a 
password -protected secure REDCap  database, or a password -protected secure OneDrive at the 
University of Cincinnati. After three years of the study's completion, all research data will be de - 
identified, and any contact information or links to study ID numbers will be destroyed by shreddi ng 
paper  documents  and deleting  electronic  files.  The identity  and information  about  the participants  will 
be kept confidential, except in cases where authorities need to be notified about abuse or immediate 
harm that may come to the participants or others . Agents of the University of Cincinnati may review 
study records for audit or quality assurance purposes. The research data may be published, but the  
participants  will not be identified  by their  names.

To capture qualitative data, audio recordings of participant interviews will be made and stored on the 
University of Cincinnati's secure online course management system. Additionally, a backup recording 
using  an encrypted  audio  recorder  will be saved  in the University's  HIPAA -secure  OneDrive  folder.  After 
de-identification, the transcriptions of the interviews will be uploaded to the  study's secure online  
OneDrive  folder.  
17.3  Describe  any procedures  that  will be used  for quality  control  of data  collection.  
For quantitative data, access to REDCap  will be restricted to the study team only. Any modifications 
made to the database, or the data stored in it will be documented in the comment section provided by 
the database. The REDCap database will automatically generate a code book that is specific to  the 
research study. The Principal Investigator and the study team will review the initial data sets to ensure 
that the data  collection  and analysis  are not affected  by any issues  with  the instruments  used.  The team 
will hold  weekly  meetings  to discuss  and monitor  the confidentiality  of participant  data.  The study  team 
will use REDCap to track data manipulation and user activity.

17.4  Describe  how  data  or specimens  will be handled  study  wide  as outlined  below.  
17.5  What  information  will be included  in the data  or associated  with  the specimens?  
For Phase  1: 
(A) Demographic  
(B) BLS Competence  Checklist  
(C) Debriefing  Tool 
(D) The Debriefing  Experience  Scale  
For Phase  2: 
The data  collection  will use a Semi -structured  interview,  the most  common  sort of interview  used  in this 
methodology, and it is  the primary method  of data collection  (DeJonckheere  & Vaughn, 2019). It will be 
included open -ended questions related to the participants' overall experience in terms of emotions, 
feelings, challenges, and learning. All the interviews will be conducted in a private place, and the PI will 
do all the intervi ews so the participants' interactions and questions will be consistent.  
The general  initial  questions  for the hot debriefing  group  are: 
(1) Tell me about  your  experience  with  simulation  and what  that’s  looked  like for you?  
(2) Tell me about  your  experience  in debriefing?  
(3) What  did you like in debriefing?  
(4) How  did debriefing  help  you to reflect  on your  simulation  experiences?  
(5) Did you face  any challenges  during  your  experience?  
(6) What  did you not like with  debriefing?  
(7) How  has debriefing  impacted  your  ability  to learn  concepts  or attain  competency  in you nursing 
skills.

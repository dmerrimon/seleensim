2 BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Metastatic Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma  (MTC):  
 
MTC is one of the best characterized solid tumors in regard to its pathologic, biochemical,  and 
molecular genetic properties. MTC derives from the neuroendocrine parafollicular or C cells  of 
the thyroid. Sporadic MTC accounts for about 75 -80% of all cases of the disease. The  remaining 
cases consist of inherited tumor syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN)  2A, 
MEN 2B, or familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). Because the C cells  are 
predominantly located in the upper portion of each thyr oid lobe, patients with sporadic  disease 
typically present with upper pole nodules. The ability of the tumor to secrete  measurable 
quantities of calcitonin, occasionally along with other hormonally active peptides (such  as 
adrenocorticotrophic hormone [ACT H] or calcitonin -gene related peptide [CGRP])  can 
contribute to the development of diarrhea, Cushing's syndrome, or facial flushing in  many 
patients with advanced disease. Sporadic disease typically presents in the fifth or sixth  decade.  
There may be a sli ght female preponderance. Sporadic patients typically present with  an

Version Date: 12/14/2017

asymptomatic mass in the thyroid. Patients with bulky disease with extremely high levels  of 
calcitonin may have severe secretory diarrhea as a principal symptom. Metastatic  cervical  
adenopathy appears in about 50% of patients at initial presentation. Symptoms of  upper 
aerodigestive tract compression or invasion are reported by up to 15% of patie nts with  sporadic 
disease.  
 
Chemotherapy and external -beam radiation therapy are ineffective against MTC,  rendering 
surgical resection the only definitive therapy (Moley JF et al, 1998; Evans DB et al 1999). 
Chemotherapeutics used in treatment of MTC include adriamycin, dacarbazine, streptozocin,  and 
5-fluorouracil (Schlumberger M et al, 1995). Single -agent response rates are poor,  with 
aggressive adriamycin regimens producing 20% to 30% objective respo nses. A study  of 
combination chemotherapy showed that a regimen of 5 -fluorouracil, streptozocin,  and 
dacarbazine produces objective responses in only 15%. Due to failure of chemotherapy  and 
radiation therapy to offer significant benefit for patients with M TC, innovative  therapeutic 
strategies for systemic treatment of MTC need to be  developed.  
 
2.2 Tumor markers and imaging studies in  MTC:  
 
Serum calcitonin is a reliable prognostic tumor marker in patients with metastatic MTC  (Brunt 
LM. et al., 1987) while reli ability of CEA maker in MTC is not well -established.  Serum 
calcitonin is widely used in the clinic to assess the response to therapy as well as to detect  the 
subclinical and/or recurrent disease. FDG -PET has been widely applied in oncology primarily  as 
a staging and restaging tool that can guide patient care. However, because it accurately  detects 
recurrent or residual disease, FDG -PET also has significant potential for assessing  therapy 
response. In this regard, it can improve patient management by identif ying responders  early, 
before tumor size is reduced; non -responders could discontinue futile therapy. For example,  PET 
imaging  is valuable  in assessing  tumor  response  to some  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors         
(Gleevec, SU11248) in the patients where conventional imaging studies may reveal  stable 
disease.  
 
Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI has recently been shown to be a valuable tool to assess  tumor 
permeability and vascularity (Stevenson et al., 2003; Morg an et al., , 2003;Galbraith et al.,, 
2003). Our group has extensive experience in using this imaging tool in the setting of  clinical 
trials.  
 
2.3 Genetics of MTC  
 
The RET protooncogene codes for a cell membrane -associated tyrosine kinase receptor for  a 
glial, c ell line -derived neurotrophic factor. Mutations in the RET proto -oncogene are found in  at 
least 95% of kindreds with MEN 2A and 88% of FMTC. Mutations associated with MEN  2A 
and FMTC have been primarily identified in several codons of the cysteine -rich extracellular  
domains of exons 10, 11, and 13, whereas MEN 2B and some FMTC mutations are found  within 
the intracellular exons 14 -16. About 6% of patients with clinically sporadic MTC carry  a 
germline mutation in RET, leading to identification of new kindreds  with multiple  previously 
undiagnosed affected  individuals.  
 
Somatic mutations in exons 11, 13, and 16 have also been found in at least 25% of  sporadic 
MTC tumors, particularly the codon 918 mutation that activates the tyrosine kinase function  of

8  
  
the receptor and is associated with poorer patient prognosis. The genetic basis of MTC in  the 
other 75% of patients is not well understood. It is possible that genetic defects other than  point 
mutations in RET gene (ie: duplication of chromosome 10) might be present. RET  point 
mutation results in constitutive activation of signaling, thus inhibition of RET signaling has  the 
potential of being a good therapeutic  target.  
 
2.4 Sorafenib (BAY  43-9006)  
 
Activation of the ras oncogene signaling pathway is considered to be an important  mechanism 
by which human cancer develops. Raf kinase is a protein involved in the Ras signal  transduction 
pathway. Ras regulates several pathways which synergistically induc e cellular  transformation, 
including the Raf/Mek/Erk cascade and the rac and rho pathways (Campbell et al., 1998,  Chong 
et al., 2003). In particular, Ras activates the Raf/Mek pathway by first localizing Raf to  the 
plasma membrane, where Raf initiates a mi togenic kinase cascade.  Activated  Raf 
phosphorylates and activates Mek which in turn phosphorylates and activates Erk. Activated  Erk 
then translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and modulates gene expression via  the 
phosphorylation of transcription factors. Thus activation of Raf kinase, via activation of Ras,  is 
thought to play an important role in  carcinogenesis.  
 
In particular, B -raf, a serine/threonine kinase, has been shown to be activated in a number  of 
human t umor types including melanoma, ovarian and papillary thyroid carcinomas (Davies et al., 
2002, Mercer and Pritchard, 2003, Pollock and Meltzer, 2002, Singer et al., 2003, Tannapfel  et 
al., 2003, Cohen et al., 2003). A survey of 43 cancer cell lines showed t hat all B -raf mutations 
resided in exons 11 or 15. Remarkably, 80% of these B -raf mutations represent a  single 
nucleotide change of T -A at nucleotide 1796 resulting in a valine to glutamic acid change  at 
residue 599 (V599E, exon 15) in the CR3 domain (ATP binding and substrate  recognition)  
which in turn confers constitutive kinase activity (Davies et al., 2002, Mercer and  Pritchard, 
2003).  
 
In Vitro  Activity  
 
The ability of sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) to inhibit a number of kinases was  evaluated

In vitro kinase assays demonstrated that sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) is a potent inhibitor  of 
wildtype and mutant (V599E) B -Raf and c -Raf Kinase isoforms in vitro  (Investigator’s 
Brochure, 2003). In addition, sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) did not inhibit human EGFR or Her2  
kinases at 10 
 M.   Nor were PKC -α, PKC -β, PKC -γ, and PKA (rat, rabbit and bovine  sources)  
kinase activity inhibited in vitro. sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) demonstrated an IC50 of 780  nM 
against p59 (bovine) Fyn kinase (Src family of protein tyrosine ki nases). In non -kinase  targets 
sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) had moderate potency against the adenosine A3, dopamine D1,  and 
muscarinic M3 receptors with IC50 of 1.6 
 M, 2.0 
 M, and 3.1 
 M, respectively.  sorafenib  
(BAY 43 -9006) did not inhibit MEK -1, ERK -1, EGFR , HER2/neu, c -met, PKA, PKB,  Cdk- 
1/cyclin B, pim -1, GSK 3 -b, CK -2, PKC -α (r), PKC -β (r), PKC -γ at concentrations as high as  10 
µM. In summary, sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) showed ≥100 -fold more selectivity for raf  kinase 
relative to other target  proteins.  
 
Sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) also inhibited in vitro several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)  that 
are involved in tumor progression; human VEGFR -2, murine VEGFR -2, murine  VEGFR -3, 
murine PDGFR -β, Flt -3, c-KIT, and p38α (MAPK family). In cellular assays, sorafe nib (BAY  
43-9006) was found to be a potent inhibitor of human and murine VEGFR -2, murine  VEGFR -3, 
and murine PDGFR -β receptor phosphorylation (Investigator’s Brochure,  2003).  
 
Finally, Santoro et al. has shown that sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) inhibits RET kina se activity  in 
vitro (IC50 dose 100 nM) (Carlomagno et al, 2006)

In Vivo  Activity  
 
Sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) has demonstrated in vivo anti-tumor efficacy as a single agent  against  
a broad range of human tumor xenografts as summarized in the following table. The  models 
evaluated include HCT -116 and DLD -1 colon tumor xenografts, MX -1 mammary  tumor 
xenograft, NCI -H460 and A549 NSCLC xenografts, MiaPaCa -2 pancreatic tumor  xenografts, 
and SK -OV-3 ovarian tumor xenografts. In this table, compound efficacy is expressed as  percent 
tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and is calculated as ((1 -(T/C)) *100, where T and C represent  the 
mean tumor size in the Treated and Control groups respectively at the first measurement after  the 
end of  treatment.

The majority of the initial anti -tumor efficacy evaluations in vivo were conducted in the  HCT116  
colon tumor model since the tumorigenicity of this cell line was previously shown to  be 
dependent on K -ras activation. Additional studies indicated that prolonged anti -tumor  efficacy 
could be attained by extending the duration of treatment and that, in th is tumor model,  sorafenib 
(BAY 43 -9006) was able to arrest tumor growth even if therapy was initiated against  a 
substantially greater tumor  burden.  
Sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) also showed significant oral activity against two additional  human  
tumor xenograft models that contain K -ras mutations: MiaPaCa -2 pancreatic carcinoma  and 
H460 non -small cell lung carcinoma. The anti -tumor efficacy of sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006)  was 
also evaluated against the human SKOV -3 ovarian tumor cell line that contain s a wild -type Ras

but over -expresses both the EGF and Her2 growth factor receptors. These receptors also  signal 
through the Ras/Raf/Mek  pathway.  
 
In human tumor xenografts, MDA -MB-231 (breast) and Colo -205 (colon), there was a  dramatic 
reduction of tumor neo -vascularization (Investigator’s Brochure, 2003). Recent data  also 
indicated that inhibition of c -raf may promote cell death in endothelial cell s as a  downstream  
event of VEGFR -2 stimulation (Alavi et al.,  2003).  
 
Taken together, data suggests that sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) may be of therapeutic value  not 
only in human tumors containing ras gene mutations, but also in tumors over -expressing  growth 
factor receptors in the Ras/Raf/Mek pathway, and by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis or  neo- 
vascularization through inhibition of VEGFR -2, VEGFR -3, and/or  PDGFR -β. 
 
The ability of sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) (or its tosylate salt, BAY 54 -9085) to be combined  with 
paclitaxel, irinotecan, gemcitabine, or cisplatin was evaluated in preclinical in vivo models.  In 
these studies, the focus was to evaluate if the co -administration of sorafenib (BAY  43-9006) 
would adversely affect the tolerance or anti -tumor efficacy of t he ‘standard of care’ agent.  The 
general health of mice was monitored and mortality was recorded daily. Tumor dimensions  and 
body weights were recorded twice a week starting with the first day of treatment.  Treatments 
producing greater than 20% lethality a nd/or 20% net body weight loss were considered  ‘toxic’. 
The results of these combinability analyses are summarized  below:

Sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) can be safely combined with a variety of standard cytotoxic  cancer  
chemotherapy agents, including paclitaxel, irinotecan, gemcitabine and cisplatin with  no 
significant increase in the toxicity associated with those agents and without diminishing  their 
anti-tumor efficacy in preclinical  models.  
 
2.5 Clinical  Experience  
 
Sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) has been evaluated in multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies in  a 
variety of tumor types. To date, over 500 patients have been treated with single agent  sorafenib 
(BAY 43 -9006). The Phase 1 single agent clinical plan has focused on ch aracterizing the  safety 
and pharmacokinetic profile sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) in several different dosing regimens.  All 
Phase 1 patients had a variety of advanced refractory solid tumors, and some of the  patients 
stayed on trial for more than one year. Four different regimens have been tested:  continuous 
treatment, 4 weeks on/ 1 week off, 3 weeks on /1 week off, and 1 week on/ 1 week off.  Patients  
 
11 
NCI Protocol #: NCI-7609 
Version Date: 12/14/2017  
12  
  
have received doses ranging from 50 mg once weekly to 1600 mg daily of sorafenib (BAY  43- 
9006) on intermittent and continuous schedules. The 800 mg bid continuous  administration 
cohort has exceeded the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in all tested schedules.  The 600 mg  bid 
cohort exceeded the MTD in all but the less dose intensive regimen of 1 week on / 1 week  off. 
The most frequent drug -related adverse events were hand -foot skin reaction, dermatitis,  rash, 
fatigue, anorexia and diarrhea. There was an increas e in the number of serious adverse  events, 
discontinuations due to adverse events, and a number of skin toxicities at the higher dose levels  ≥ 
600 mg bid. Therefore, 400 mg bid was selected as the recommended dose for Phase  2. 
In general, sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) at 400 mg PO BID dosing was well tolerated  chronically 
by most patients. The most common drug -related adverse events (>5%) seen at this  dose 
schedule were skin -related findings. The adverse events include hand -foot skin  reaction 
occurring in 11 pati ents (35.5%), pruritus in 9 patients (29%), dermatology/skin -other in  9 
patients (29.0%), alopecia in 8 patients (25.8%), and rash/desquamation in 7 patients  (22.6%). 
Other common adverse events include fatigue in 11 patients (35.5%), anorexia in 7  patient s 
(22.6%), diarrhea in 11 patients (35.5%), and pain -other in 5 patients (16.1%). Liver  function 
abnormalities did occur, with SGOT elevation occurring in 6 patients (19.4%), SGPT  elevation 
in 5 patients (16.1%), and alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin elev ation in 4 patients  each 
(12.9%).  Of note, unlike most cytotoxic agents, myelosuppression was rarely  observed.  
 
Currently, the Phase 2 program includes studies designed to explore anti -tumor efficacy  in 
certain tumor types and to gain additional experience with pharmacokinetics and safety.  Thus 
far, Phase 2 studies have enrolled over 300 patients with a variety of tumor types  including 
colorectal, renal cell, hepatocellular, pancreatic, and thyroid cance r and melanoma as well  as 
several less common  tumors.  
In general, available information from the ongoing Phase 2 studies reveals toxicities that  are 
similar to the Phase 1 data.  Again, the five most frequent drug -related toxicities  observed  
include hand -foot skin reaction, rash, anorexia, diarrhea, and fatigue. When all available  data 
from the various studies/schedules are combined, the incidence of greater than grade 3  treatment 
emergent skin toxicity (e.g. hand -foot syndrome and “dermatology/skin reactio n”) for an  initial 
dose of 400 mg bid and 600 mg bid, was 0% and 30%, respectively. Anti -tumor activity  was 
observed in both Phase 1 and 2 studies. In December 2005, Sorafenib Tosylate (BAY  43-9006; 
NEXAVAR®) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of pa tients with advanced renal  cell 
carcinoma.  
 
2.6 Rationale  
 
There is no standard systemic therapy for metastatic MTCs. Systemic chemotherapy  has 
extremely limited value and local external beam radiation therapy only may help with  palliation 
of symptoms. A media n disease -specific survival in this group of patients is only 3 to 5  years. 
Targeted therapy for such chemo -resistant tumors is desperately  needed.  
 
RET mutation is a hallmark of genetic defect in MTC. Mutations in the RET proto -oncogene  are 
found in at le ast 95% of kindreds with MEN 2A and 88% of FMTC and in about 25% of  patients 
with sporadic MTC. It is possible that other mechanisms of RET gene defects in MTC are  not 
discovered yet, but play a role in the pathogenesis of sporadic MTC. Sorafenib (BAY  43-9006) 
inhibits the RET/Ras/Raf/Mek pathway, and may indirectly inhibit the RET/Akt pathway.  In 
addition, it also inhibits tumor angiogenesis or neo -vascularization through inhibition  of 
VEGFR -2, VEGFR -3, and/or PDGFR -β.  Sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) is an or ally active  small

molecule that was generally well tolerated in phase I clinical trials. Thus, sorafenib (BAY  43- 
9006) targeting the RET signaling pathway represents an excellent oral agent for the  possible  
treatment of patients with metastatic medullary thyroid  carcinoma.

3.3.8 The effects of sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) on the developing human fetus at  the 
recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because  kinase 
inhibitors are known to be teratogenic, women of child -bearing potential and men  must 
agree to use adequ ate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth  control; 
abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for at least  30 
days after completion of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she  is 
pregnant while  participating in this study, she should inform her treating  physician 
immediately.  
 
3.3.9 Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent  document.  
 
3.4 Exclusion Criteria for Arm A and Arm  B:

anticoagulation (i.e. low dose warfarin) or venous or arterial access devices is  allowed 
provided that the PT, INR or PTT are normal.  
 
3.4.10  Pregnant women or women who are breast -feeding are excluded from this study  because 
sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) is an investigational agent and teratogenicity has not  been 
evaluated yet. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse e vents  in 
nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with sorafenib (BAY  43-9006), 
breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with sorafenib (BAY  43- 
9006).  
 
3.4.11  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti -retroviral therapy be cause of  possible 
pharmacokinetic interactions with sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006). Patients with  immune 
deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with  marrow -suppressive 
therapy.  
 
3.4.12  Patients taking the cytochrome P450 enzyme -inducing antie pileptic drugs  (phenytoin, 
carbamazepine, or Phenobarbital), rifampin or St. John’s Wort due to potential  drug 
interactions with  sorafenib.  
 
3.5 Inclusion of Women and  Minorities  
 
Entry to this study is open to both men and women, and to all racial and ethnic  subgroups. 
Patients will not be excluded from this study on the basis of a history of known HIV  positive 
status.  
 
 
4 TREATMENT  PLAN  
 
4.1 Sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006)  Administration  
 
Treat ment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Reported adverse events and  potential 
risks are described in Section 6 .  Appropriate dose modifications for sorafenib (BAY  43-9006) 
are described in Section 5 . No investigational or commercial agents or therapies other than  those 
described below may be administered with the intent to treat thyroid  cancer.  
Sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) will be administered at the dose of 400 mg orally twice a day on  a 
continuous basis. Sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) is supplied as 200 -mg tablets.  Patients are  to 
swallow the tablets whole with approximately 250 ml (8 oz.) of water, each morning and  evening 
(i.e., approximately 12 -hourly).  When given with a moderate fat meal,  bioavailability  was 
similar to that in the fasted state. With a high fat meal, sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006)  tosylate’s 
bioavailability was reduced by 29% compared to administration in the fasted state. Thus, it  is 
recommended that sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) be ta ken on an empty stomach (at least 1  hour 
before or 2 hours after  eating).  
16 NCI Protocol #: NCI-7609 
Version Date: 12/14/2017   
  
 
Patients will be given monthly calendars (patient diaries) to document the time when  the 
sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) pills are taken.  At monthly visits, patients will bring back this  record.  
 
Hypertension is a known and potentially serious adverse event associated with Sorafebnib  (BAY 
43-9006) treatment. Patients will have their blood pressure m onitored and recorded  weekly 
during the first cycle of therapy, either at the doctor’s office or using any calibrated  electronic 
device (such as those found at a local drug store or pharmacy). Patients will be provided with  a 
Blood Pressure Check Diary on which to record the measurements.  An increase in  blood 
pressure of > 20 mm Hg (systolic) and 10 mm Hg (diastolic) should be reported to the  treating 
physician immediately. See dose modification guidelines in section 5 in event of drug  related 
hypertension . 
 
Oral or intravenous (IV) bisphosphonates therapy will be allowed for patients with  bony 
metastasis at the investigator’s  discretion.  
 
Close monitoring is recommended for patients taking BAY 43 -9006 tosylate and  CYP3A4 
inducers. The CYP3A4 inducers such as antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin, carbamazepine,  or 
Phenobarbital), rifampin or St. John’s Wort are not permitted on the protocol due to  potential 
drug interactions with  sorafenib.  
 
4.2 Supportive Care  Guidelines  
 
Prophylactic use of anti -emetics, anti -diarrh eal treatment, or growth factors is not  recommended. 
However, anti -emetics, anti -diarrheal treatment or growth factors may be used for  acute 
treatment of toxicities and growth factors may be offered as per the ASCO  guidelines.  
 
For patients who develop han d-foot reaction, treatment with topical emollients (such  as 
Aquaphor ) for symptom relief is recommended. Topical and/or oral steroids or  anti-histamine 
agents may be used. High dose vitamin B6 (pyridoxine; up to 400 mg orally each day) may  also 
be used.  
 
4.3 Duration of Therapy  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment will continue until one  of 
the following criteria  applies:  
▪ Progressive Disease and no clinical benefit (Note: patients who have continued  clinical 
benefit such as symp tomatic or tumor marker improvement or decreased tumor  burden 
compared to baseline or limited progression in non -target lesion treated with radiation  or 
surgery will be able to continue  therapy)  
▪ Completion of 8 weeks of therapy after complete  remission  
▪ Off of study drug due to any reason for more than 21 consecutive  days 
▪ Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of  treatment  
▪ Unacceptable adverse  event(s)  
▪ Patient decides to withdraw from the  study  
▪ General or specific changes in the patient ’s condition render the patient unacceptable  for 
further treatment in the judgment of the  investigator.

5 DOSING DELAYS/DOSE  MODIFICATIONS  
 
▪ For delay of treatment due to toxicity for more than 21 days, patient will be  removed 
from the  study.  
 
Dose should be modified and/or delayed according to the following  guidelines:  
 
In the event of grade 3 or 4 drug -related non -hematologic toxicity , therapy will be held  till 
the toxicity has resolved to baseline or grade 1. For delay of treatment due to toxicity for  more 
than 21 consecutive days, patient will be removed from the study. Once toxicity is resolved  to 
baseline or  grade 1, sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) should be started at a reduced dose of 200  mg 
PO BID. If tolerated, the dose can be re -escalated to 600 mg/day given as 400 mg in the AM  and 
200 mg in the PM.  If 600 mg/day dose is tolerated, further re -escalation to the full dose of  400 
mg PO BID may be done after discussing with protocol  chair.  
 
In the event of grade 2 hand -foot skin reaction or recurrent grade 2 drug -related  non- 
hematologic toxicity, therapy may be held till the toxicity has resolved to baseline or grade  1. 
For delay of treatment due to toxicity for more than 21 consecutive day s, patient will be  removed 
from the study. Once toxicity is resolved to baseline or grade 1, sorafenib (BAY  43-9006) 
should be started at a reduced dose of 200 mg PO BID. If tolerated, the dose can be  re-escalated  
to 600 mg/day given as 400 mg in the AM and 200 mg in the PM. If 600 mg/day dose  is 
tolerated, further re -escalation to the full dose of 400 mg PO BID may be done after  discussing 
with protocol  chair.  
 
In the event of GI -Perforation, patient will be removed from the study and followed  until 
adverse event is  resolve.

6 PHAMACEUTICAL  INFORMATION 
6.1  Sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) (NSC  724772)  
Chemical Name : 4–{4-[3-(4-chloro -3-trifluoromethyl -phenyl) ureido] -phenoxy}  pyridine -2 
carboxylic acid  methylam ide-4-methylbenzensulfonate.  
 
Other names : BAY 54 -9085 is the tosylate salt of BAY 43 -9006; sorafenib;  Nexavar®. 
 
Molecular Formula : C12H16CIF 3N4O3  X C7H8O3S 
 
M.W .: BAY 43 -9006 tosylate: 637 Daltons; BAY 43 -9006 (free base): 465  Daltons  
 
Classification : Kinase inhibitor (Raf, VEGF -R, and  PDGF -R). 
 
Description : The ras/raf signaling pathway is an important mediator of responses to  growth 
signals and angiogenic factors. This pathway is often aberrantly activated in human tumors  due 
to presence of activated ras, mutant b -raf, or over expression of growth factor receptors.  BAY 
43-9006 is a potent inhibitor of c -raf, and wild -type and mutant b -raf in vitro.  Additionally, 
further characterization of BAY 43 -9006 tosylate revealed that this agent inhibits  several  
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that are involved in tumor progression (VEGF -R, PDGF -R, 
Flt3, and c -KIT) and p38α, a member of the MAPK  family.  
19 NCI Protocol #: NCI-7609 
Version Date: 12/14/2017   
  
How Supplied : Sorafenib tosylate is supplied by Bayer Healthcare AG and distributed by  PMB, 
CTEP , DCTD, NCI. The tablets are available as 200 mg immediate release tablets. The  inactive 
ingredients are microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium,  hydroxypropylmethyl 
cellulose, magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate, and a film - coat with 
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide and red iron  oxide.  
■ The commercially labeled 200 mg tablets are round, biconvex, red film -coated  tablets,  
debossed with the “Bayer cross” on one side and “200” on the other side and packaged in  HDPE 
bottles of 120  tablets.  
 
NOTE: Sorafenib tablets may be repackaged in HDPE pharmacy dispensing bottle other  than 
the original container with expiration date not t o exceed 30  days.  
Route of Administration : Orally.  
 
Method of Administration : Following oral administration, sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006)  tosylate’s 
mean relative bioavailability is 38 -49%. When given with a moderate fat meal,  bioavailability 
was similar to tha t in the fasted state. With a high fat meal, BAY 43 -9006 tosylate’s 
bioavailability was reduced by 29% compared to administration in the fasted state. Thus, it  is 
recommended that sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) be taken on an empty stomach (at least 1  hour 
before or 2 hours after eating) and with at least 250 mL of  water.  
 
Drug Product Storage : Store intact bottles at controlled room temperature, not to exceed  25ºC.  
 
If a storage temperature excursion is identified, promptly return sorafenib to controlled  room 
temperature (not to exceed 25°C) and quarantine the supplies. Provide a detailed report of  the 
excursion (including documentation of temperature monitoring and duration of the excursion)  to 
PMBAfterH ours@mail.nih.gov  for determination of  suitability.  
 
Drug Product Stability : Stability studies are ongoing for investigationally -labeled  supplies. 
Refer to package labeling for shelf life of commercially -labeled  supplies.  
 
Approximate Solubility : 0.19 mg/100 mL in 0.1 N HCl, 453 mg/100 mL in  Ethanol,  and 2971 
mg/100 mL in PEG  400. 
 
Potential  Drug  Interactions : Sorafenib  metabolizes primarily  by CYP3A4  during  phase  I 
metabolism  (oxidation)  and primarily  by UGT1A9  in phase  II (conjugation).  Co-administration of 
rifampin  resulted  in sorafenib AUC  reduction  of approximately  37%.  Therefore, use caution when  
co-administering with strong CYP3A4 inducers, such as St. John’s wort, phenytoin, carbamazepine,  
phenobarbital and dexamethasone as they can  reduce sorafenib exposure.  CYP3A4 inhibitors are  
not expected to cause clinically relevant changes to sorafenib  exposure.  
 
In vitro,  sorafenib  is a moderate  inhibitor  CYP2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 and a strong  inhibitor  of 
CYB2B6,  2C8, and 2C9. It also inhibits pathway  enzymes  UGT1A1  and UGT1A9  in phase  II 
conjugation. Clinical data suggests sorafenib does not increase exposure of other drugs  metabolized  
by CYP  pathways  and therefore  does not appear  to be clinically  relevant.  Use caution  when  co- 
administered with sensitive substrates of UGT1A1.  
 
While  sorafenib  solubility  is pH dependent,  co-administration with omeprazole  did not result  in 
clinically relevant change in sorafenib  exposure.  
20 NCI Protocol #: NCI-7609 
Version Date: 12/14/2017   
  
 
Sorafenib  may prolong  the QT/QTc  interval. Avoid concomitant drugs that may induce  the QTc 
prolongation.  
 
Patient Care Implications: Hand -foot skin rash can be treated with topical emollients,  high- 
potency topical steroids, or keratolytic cream (urea/salicyclic  acid).  
 
Females  of childbearing  potential  should  avoid  becoming  pregnant while  they or their male partners  
are taking  sorafenib and should  use effective  contraception  during  and for at least 30 days after  
completion of therapy.  
 
Availability : 
 
Sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) is an investigational agent supplied to investigators by the Division  of 
Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD),  NCI.  
 
Sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) is provided to the NCI under a Clinical Trials Agreement  (CTA) 
between Bayer Corp./Onyx an d the DCTD, NCI (see Section  10.4).  
 
Agent Ordering and Agent  Accountability  
NCI-supplied agents may be requested by the Principal Investigator (or their  authorized 
designee) at each participating institution. Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB)  policy  
requires that agent be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be treated.  PMB 
does not permit the transfer of agents between institutions (unless prior approval from PMB  is 
obtained). The CTEP -assigned protocol number must be used for  ordering all  CTEP -supplied 
investigational agents. The responsible investigator at each participating institution must  be 
registered with CTEP, DCTD through an annual submission of FDA Form 1572 (Statement  of 
Investigator), Curriculum Vitae, Supplemental Investigator Data Form (IDF), and  Financial 
Disclosure Form (FDF). If there are several participating investigators at one institution,  CTEP - 
supplied investigational agents for the study should be ordered under the name of one  lead 
investigator at that  institution.  
 
In general, sites may order initial agent supplies when a subject is being screened for  enrollment 
onto the  study.

6.2 Comprehensive  Adverse  Events  and Potential  Risks  list (CAEPR)  For Soraf enib (BAY  
43-9006, NSC  724772)  
 
The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list  of 
reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a  uniform 
presentation of events by body system. In add ition to the comprehensive list, a subset,  the 
Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column  and 
is identified with bold and italicized text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that  are 
protocol speci fic exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI (except as noted below). Refer to  the 
'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting  Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf  for 
further clarification. Frequency is provided based on 2571 patients. Below is the CAEPR  for 
Sorafenib (BAY  43-9006).  
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF they exceed the grade noted in  parentheses  
next to the AE in the SPEER. If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol  using 
multiple investigational agents and has an AE listed on different SPEERs, use the  lower 
of the grades to determine if expedited re porting is  required.

7 CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL  STUDIES:  
 
Several studies listed in this section are not necessarily research tests but they have been  outlined  
below as the information obtained from following tests may not be needed to determine  objective 
response (primary endpoint of the study) while they may be helpful in clinical care of the  patient.  
Informed consent must be obtained prior to obtaining research studies [any tissue  specimen, 
biopsies, research blood draws, and DCE -portion of  MRI].  
28 NCI Protocol #: NCI-7609 
Version Date: 12/14/2017   
  
7.1 Measure serum tumor markers (calcitonin and CEA) pre -, during -, and post - 
treatment to corr elate with disease  response.  
This will be done in all the patients participating on the study as it is considered standard of  care. 
This will be done pre -treatment, every 16 weeks during treatment and post -treatment [within  2-4 
weeks after last dose of sor afenib (BAY 43 -9006)]. All the centers participating in this  study 
perform calcitonin and CEA routinely as a part of standard clinical  care.  
 
In addition to drawing samples for serum calcitonin and CEA at the baseline, extra 10 -mL of 
blood (research blood draw) will be drawn in red top tube on ice at pre -study visit. Serum  will 
be separated, aliquoted in 0.5 mL/tube and stored for possible future re -measurement  of 
calcitonin and/or CEA. Such frozen samples will be utilized if clinical laboratory changes  the 
calcitonin and/or CEA assays while patient is on study, to avoid inter -assay variation. In  such 
cases, such baseline sample may be re -run concurrently with specimen drawn during  treatment.  
 
7.2 Perform a nuclear medicine functional imaging F -18 fluorodeoxyglu cose  positron 
emission tomography (PET) scan] pre -, and  during -treatment.  
PET scans are not required as a part of this research study. Per protocol, PET scans are not  used 
for response assessment. PET scans may be done in any patient on the study as  clinic ally 
indicated pre -treatment and every 16 weeks during treatment. This will be determined by  the 
treating  physician.  
 
7.3 Perform  a dynamic -contrast  enhanced  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (DCE -MRI)  pre- 
, and during -treatment  to correlate  change  in tumor  permeability  and vascularity 
with tumor  response.  
All the centers participating in this study perform MRI routinely as a part of standard  clinical 
care for the cancer patients. These centers also have capacity to perform DCE -MRI.  While 
DCE -portion of this test is considered research, MRI is considered a standard imaging  for 
patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma. All centers participating in the study will use  a 
standard uniform acquisition protocol for DCE -MRI scan (see Appendix C for the  details).  
Digital images will be transferred to Dr. Knopp’s OSU imaging laboratory for central  reading. 
DCE -MRI scans are performed as a part of laboratory correlative studies only and the results  will 
not be used to assess the  response.  
 
DCE -MRI scan will be preferred in at least 16 patients entered on the Arm A and at  least 
16 patients entered on Arm B of the study except under the following  circumstances:  
 
Patients who  have:  
• Cardiac  pacemaker  
• Other ferromagnetic metal implants not authorized for use in MRI such as some types  of 
cerebral aneurysm  clips 
• Claustrophobia not helped by  pre-medications  
• Obesity (exceeding the equipment  limits)  
• Following circumstances  exist:  
• In case, MRIs are not suitab le for evaluating response per RECIST  criteria  
• Investigator’s  disapproval  
• Funding for the research part of DCE -MRI is not sufficiently  available  
 
DCE -MRI may be performed for the remaining patients enrolled on Arms A and B of  the 
NCI Protocol #: NCI-7609 
Version Date: 12/14/2017   
  
study per investigator’s  discretion.  
 
Time points: Performed pre -therapy (within 4 wks prior to treatment), at 8 weeks on  therapy. 
DCE -MRI scans at the time points beyond 8 weeks (at every 8 week interval while on the  study 
and at off study visit time poin t) may be done per investigator’s  discretion.  
 
Note: MRI scans will be continued to be utilized to measure  response.  
 
7.4 Pharmacogenomic  studies:  
 
We will procure PBMCs from all the patients enrolled on the study. Pharmacogenomic  studies  
will be performed in all the patients if any clinical responses are observed on this trial. We  will 
examine for selected polymorphisms of genes influencing sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006)  metabolism 
and/or resistance genes that may predict response or toxicity. T hese changes will be  correlated  
with toxicity and clinical response to  therapy.  
 
Blood will be drawn for all the patients enrolled on the  study.  
 
Sample collection and shipping: 20 ml peripheral blood in heparinized tube (usually  solid 
green top tubes) wil l be collected, kept at the room temperature till shipped on the same day  of 
collection (see Appendix B for shipping instructions). Blood specimens will be collected  from 
all patients and PBMCs will be  isolated.  
 
Time Points: Performed pre -therapy (within 4 weeks prior to  registration).  
 
7.5 Assess  the degree  of Ras-MAPK  signaling  inhibition,  and vascular  endothelial  growth 
factor  (VEGF)  expression  in the tumor  and clinical  response.  (Maximum  of 24 
patients to  participate)  
 
Perform  MAP kinase and AKT phosphorylation assay by immunohistochemistry to evaluate  the 
degree of RET -Ras-MAPK signaling inhibition by sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) in tumor  biopsies. 
Given that sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) also inhibits VEGFR, we will evaluate VEGF expres sion in 
tumor biopsies to correlate with DCE -MRI parameters and with clinical response when  possible.  
 
These tests will be performed in any patients on Arm A or B of the study who  has 
biopsiable disease and is willing to undergo biopsies for research  purposes.  
 
Biopsies will not be performed under one of the following  circumstances:  
▪ Investigator’s  disapproval  
▪ Funding for the biopsies is not sufficiently  available  
▪ Patient refuses to undergo the  procedure.  
 
In such cases biopsies may be performed pre -treatment (within 4 weeks prior to  starting 
treatment) and at 8 wks on treatment. Post -treatment (within 4 wks after last dose  of 
treatment) biopsies in these patients may be performed per investigator’s discreti on. Please 
note that the CT or MRI, DCE -MRI, and PET scan that might need to be done at these  time 
points should be done prior to doing biopsy procedure. No specific time interval is  necessary 
between these imaging studies and  biopsy.

NCI Protocol #: NCI-7609 
Version Date: 12/14/2017

Sample collection and processing: Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies (using 18 -21 gauge 
needle) of the tumor (ie: either cervical lymph nodes or bulky bony or lung or liver  metastasis)  
will be performed under imaging guidance or blindly depending on the location and size of  the 
tumor.  
 
Fine needle aspirated material will be collected in the tubes containing RPMI media. No  direct 
smears slides will be made from FNA. Using Autocyte PREP s ystem standard protocol,  slides 
will be prepared using CytoRich® Red (Tripath Imaging) cytological preservative. The  actual  
slides used will be PLUS slides; as these are precoated that facilitates the cells staying on  the 
slides during processing. At least 8 unstained slides will be prepared using the standard  protocol. 
Two slides will be stained with PapStain for cytologic diagnosis so that we verify that tumor  was 
indeed present in the FNA  specimen.  
 
Principle of Autocyte PREP system : The AutoCyte PREP Sy stem converts a liquid suspension  of 
a cell sample into discretely stained, homogenous thin -layer of cells while maintaining  diagnostic  
cell clusters. The process includes cell preservation, randomization, enrichment of  diagnostic  
material,  autmated  pipe tting,  sedimentation,  and  discrete staining portions  of the  process.        
The AutoCyte PREP presents a wellpreserved population of stained cells present within   a   
13mm diameter circle. Using this system, we have been able to perform  immunohistoch emistry  
studies   on   specimens   prepared   from   FNA   material   in   our   ongoing   CTEP -  sponsore                        
d phase II trial (NCI  6609).  
 
All stained and unstained slides will be shipped to Dr. Shah at the OSU (see Appendix B  for 
shipping instructions) who then will transfer batched specimen to Dr. Ringel’s  laboratory.  
 
Methods: Studies on unstained slides will be processed at Dr. Ringel’s laboratory at the  OSU. 
Immunohistochemical staining Sections will be dewaxed, soaked in alcohol and  after 
microwave treatment in antigen unmasking solution for 10 min incubated in 3%  hydrogen 
peroxide for 15 min to inactivate endogenous peroxidase activity. Sections will be incu bated  at 
4C overnight with anti - phospho -Akt (dilution 1:100), with anti -Ret (C -19) (dilution  1:100), 
with anti -p44/42 MAP kinase (dilution 1:100), with anti VEGF (dilution 1:100).  Immunostaining 
will be performed by use of the Vectastain Universal Quick kit according to the  manufacture’s 
instruction. Peroxidase staining will be revealed with 3, 3 - diaminobenzidine. Negative  control 
will be applied by omission of antiserum. Results will be interpreted independently by  three 
blinded investigators and score d for the presence or absence of staining. Scoring will  be 
compared between the three investigators independently and agreement between two of the  three  
investigators will be required for a positive result to be  assessed.  
 
7.6 Assess  the presence  and type of RET  gene  defects  in the tumor  to correlate  with 
clinical  response.  
As the presence of RET gene mutations in patients with metastatic sporadic medullary  thyroid 
carcinoma is highly variable but on average about 25%, we plan to examine the presence  and 
type of such gene defects in our patient population while treating them with sorafenib (BAY  43- 
9006) that inhibits the downstream signaling pathway for  RET.  
 
As patients on Arm A are expected to have germ -line mutations in RET, collection  and 
studies on tumor tissue blocks may not be necessary in those patients. In this group  of 
patients, we will have RET germ -line mutation information available from the  genotyping

studies performed in the peripheral blood (see section  7.7). 
 
All patients on Arm B on the study will have this test performed except under the  following 
circumstances:  
▪ Tissue block is not sufficient for research  purposes.  
▪ Tissue block is not transferable for research  purposes.  
Sample collection and shipping: There is no new biopsy performed for this test. The  tissue 
block preserved routinely at clinical pathology laboratory of previously performed thyroid  cancer 
biopsy/surgery will be obtained and shipped to Dr. Shah a t the OSU (see Appendix B  for 
shipping  instructions).  
 
Time point: Anytime prior to registration on the  study.  
 
Methods: Ten micron/slice will be cut from the tumor paraffin tissue block and such  3-4 
unstained slides will be used for isolating tumor DNA. H&E slides will be prepared to  verify 
pathologic diagnosis.  Tumor DNA will be isolated in Dr. Ringel’s laboratory at the  OSU. 
DNA extraction: After microdissection of tumor on slides, DNA will be ext racted using  QI- 
Amp DNA mini kit (Qiagen SA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. All PCR  products 
will be electrophoresed on 3% agarose gel in TAE buffer and stained with ethidium  bromide.  
 
RET mutation studies will be performed in Dr. Thomas Pri or’s laboratory at the OSU  using 
standard protocol for RET  genotyping.  
 
7.7 Assess  the presence  and type of RET  gene  defects  in the peripheral  blood  to correlate 
with clinical  response.  
RET genotyping in peripheral blood is a clinical test that is standard of care in all patients  with 
medullary thyroid carcinoma. Each participating center will use their clinical laboratories  to 
perform such RET genotyping  tests.  
 
This test will be sent ou t to the clinical laboratory (5 mL blood in one purple top/EDTA tube)  in 
all the patients enrolled on the study during their pre -study visit unless the RET  mutation 
analysis report from previously performed analysis is  available.

9 MEASUREMENT OF  EFFECT  
 
For the purposes  of this study,  patients  should  be reevaluated  for response  every  16 weeks.  
Confirmatory scans should also be obtained 4 weeks following initial documentation  of 
objective  response.  
 
9.1 Definitions  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international  criteria  
proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee  (Therasse 
et al., 2000). Changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the  tumor 
lesions are used in the RECIST criteria. Note : Lesions are either measu rable or  non-measurable 
using the criteria provided below. The term 'evaluable' in reference to measurability will not  be 
used because it does not provide additional meaning or  accuracy.  
 
9.1.1 Measurable  disease  
 
Measurable lesions are defined as those that can  be accurately measured in at least  one 
dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm with conventional techniques (CT,  MRI, 
x-ray) or as >10 mm with spiral CT scan or MRI performed with following  technique:  
 
MRI images acquired in at least two ima ging planes (such as axial and coronal) that give  'in- 
plane' resolution of at least 2.5  mm. 
 
All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of  centimeters).  
 
Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated ar ea will not be  considered 
measurable unless the lesion in irradiated area shows  progression.  
 
9.1.2 Non-measurable  disease  
 
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <20 mm  with 
conventional techniques or <10 mm using spiral CT scan or MRI with ‘in -plane resolution of  2.5 
mm’), are considered non -measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease,  ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflamma tory breast  disease, 
abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), and cystic lesions are all  non-measurable.  
 
9.1.3 Target  lesions  
 
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 lesions in  total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded  and 
measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions  with 
the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by  imaging 
techniques or clinically). A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will  be 
calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as  reference 
by which to characterize the objective tumor  response.  
34 NCI Protocol #: NCI-7609 
Version Date: 12/14/2017   
  
 
9.1.4 Non-target  lesions  
 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should  also 
be recorded at baseline. Non -target lesions include measurable lesions that exceed the  maximum 
numbers per organ or total of all involved organs as well as non -measurable  lesions.  
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or absence  of each should  be 
noted throughout  follow -up. 
 
9.2 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable  Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible  to the beginning of treatment  and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the  treatment.  
 
Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area will not be  considered 
measurable unless the lesion in irradiated area shows  progression.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize  each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation  is 
preferred to evaluation by clinical examination when both me thods have been used to assess  the 
anti-tumor effect of a  treatment.  
 
Clinical lesions. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are  superficial  
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes). In the case of skin lesions, documentation  by 
color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is  recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray. Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are  clearly 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is  preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI. These techniques should be performed with cuts of 10 mm or  less 
in slice thickness contiguously. Spiral CT should be performed using a 5 mm  contiguous 
reconstruction algorithm.  This applies to tumors of the chest, abdomen, and  pelvis. 
 
Ultrasound (US). When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response evaluation,  US 
should not be used to measure tumor lesions. It is, however, a possible alternative to  clinical 
measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneo us lesions, and thyroid  nodules. 
US might also be useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions  usually 
assessed by clinical  examination.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy.  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor  evaluation 
has not yet been fully and widely validated. Their uses in this specific context  require 
sophisticated equipment and a high level of expertise that may only be available in some  centers. 
Therefore, the utilization of such techniques for objective tumor respon se should be restricted  to 
validation purposes in reference centers. However, such techniques may be useful to  confirm 
complete pathological response when biopsies are  obtained.  
 
Tumor markers.  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers  are 
NCI Protocol #: NCI-7609 
Version Date: 12/14/2017   
  
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered  in 
complete clinical  response.  
 
Cytology, Histology. These techniques can be us ed to differentiate between partial  responses  
(PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such  as 
germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can  remain).  
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic o rigin of any effusion that appears or  worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease  is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect  of 
the treatment) an d progressive  disease . 
 
9.3 Response Criteria for patients with measurable  disease:  
DCE -portions of MRI scans and PET scans will not be used to assess the response as they are  not 
part of RECIST criteria.  Please see section 9.4 for patients who have only assessable  disease.  
 
9.3.1 Evaluation of target  lesions  
 
Complete Response  (CR):  Disappearance of all target  lesions  
 
Partial Response  (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD)  of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum  LD 
 
Progressive Disease  (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target  lesions,  
taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since  the 
treatment started or the appearance of one or more  new lesions  
 
Stable Disease  (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor  sufficient  
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum  LD 
since the treatment  started  
 
9.3.2 Evaluation of non -target  lesions  
 
Complete Response  (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of  tumor  
marker  level 
 
Incomplete  Response/  
Stable Disease  (SD):  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s)  and/or  
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal  limits  
 
Progressive Disease  (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or  unequivocal  
progression of existing non -target  lesions  
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, in such  circumstances  
the opinion of the treating physician should prevail , and the progression status should  be 
confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or study  chair).  
Note: If tumor marker (calcitonin) is initially above the upper normal limit, they must  normalize 
for a patient to be considered in complete clinical  response.

Version Date: 12/14/2017

9.3.3 Evaluation of best overall  response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment  until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the  smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment  will 
depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteri a (see section  9.3.1 ). 
 
 
Target  Lesions  Non-Target  Lesions  New  Lesions  Overall  Response  
CR CR No CR 
CR Incomplete  response/SD  No PR 
PR Non-PD No PR 
SD Non-PD No SD 
PD Any Yes or  No PD 
Any PD Yes or  No PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
 
Note: 1) Patients with a global deterioration of health status  requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression  at 
that time should be classified as having 'symptomatic deterioration'. Every  effort  
should be made to document the objective progression, even after discontinuation 
of treatment.  
2) In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease  from 
normal tissue. When the evaluation of complete response depends on  this 
deter mination,  it is recommended  that the residual  lesion  be investigated  (fine 
needle aspirate/biopsy) before confirming the complete response  status.  
 
9.4 Confirmatory Measurement/Duration of  Response  
 
9.4.1 Confirmation  
 
To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed  by 
repeat assessments that should be performed 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first  met. 
In the case of SD, follow -up measurements must have met the SD criter ia at least once  after 
study entry at a minimum interval of 16 weeks (see section  9.3.3 ). 
 
9.4.2 Duration of overall response  
 
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for  CR 
or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease  is 
NCI Protocol #: NCI-7609 
Version Date: 12/14/2017  
37  
  
objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest  measurements  
recorded since the treatment started). The duration of overall CR is measured from the  time 
measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is  objectively 
documented.  
 
9.4.3 Duration of Stable  Disease  
 
Stable disease is mea sured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression  are 
met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment  started.  
 
9.5 Response  Review  
 
As the primary endpoint for this trial is response rate, it is stron gly recommended that  all 
responses be reviewed by an expert(s) independent of the study at the study’s  completion. 
Simultaneous review of the patients’ files and radiological images is the best  approach.  
 
Note: When a review of the radiological images is to take place, it is also recommended  that 
images be free of marks that might obscure the lesions or bias the evaluation of the  reviewer(s).  
 
 
10 REGULATORY AND REPORTING  REQUIREMENTS  
 
The reporting procedures to be  followed are presented in the “CTEP, NCI Guidelines:  Adverse 
Event Reporting Requirements” which can be downloaded from the CTEP web  site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf).  
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria  for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 will be utilized for adverse event  reporting.  
 
All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 3.0. A  copy 
of the CTCAE version 3.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web  site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/r eporting/ctc.html ). 
 
10.1 Expedited Adverse Event  Reporting  
(AE; formerly known as Adverse Drug  Reaction)  
▪ Expedited reports are submitted to CTEP via the secure  CTEP -AERS 
application accessed via the CTEP web  site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_  
events.htm).  
▪ In the rare occurrence  when  Internet  connectivity  is lost, an adverse  event  report 
may be submitted  using  CTEP's  Adverse  Event  Expedited  Report -Single  Agent 
or Multiple  Agent  paper  template  (available  at http://ctep.cancer.gov ) and faxed  
to 301 -230-0159. A 24 -hour notification is to be made to CTEP by  telephone  
at 301 -897-7497, only when Internet connectivity is disrupted. Once  Internet 
connectivity is restored, an AE report submitted on a paper template or a  24-

report is required as outlined in the  table.  
December 15,  2004  
Note: All deaths on study require both routine and expedited reporting regardless of  causality. 
Attribution to treatment or other cause must be  provided.  
• Expedited AE reporting timelines  defined:  
➢ “24 hours; 5 calendar days” – The investigator must initiall y report the AE  via 
CTEP -AERS within 24 hours of learning of the event followed by a  complete 
CTEP -AERS report within 5 calendar days of the initial 24 -hour report.  
➢ “10 calendar days” - A complete CTEP -AERS report on the AE must  be 
submitted within 10 calendar days of the investigator learning of the  event.  
• Any medical event equivalent to CTCAE grade 3, 4, or 5 that  precipitates 
hospitalization (or prolongation of existing hospitalization) must be  reported 
regardless of attribution and designation as expected or unexpected with  the 
exception of any events identified as protocol -specific expedited adverse  event 
reporting  exclusions.  
• Any event that results in persistent or significant  disabilities/incapacities, 
congenital  anomalies,  or birth defects  must be reported  via CTEP -AERS  if the 
event occurs following treatment with an agent under a CTEP  IND.  
• Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID provided  during 
trial registration on all  reports.  
NCI Protocol #: NCI-7609 
Version Date: 12/14/2017  
39  
  
10.1.2  Expedited Adverse Event Reporting  Exclusions  
 
None.  
 
10.1.3  Secondary  AML/MDS  
 
Investigators are required to report cases of secondary AML/MDS occurring on or  following 
treatment on NCI -sponsored chemotherapy protocols using the NCI/CTEP  Secondary  
AML/MDS Report Form. This form can be downloaded from the CTEP web  site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/index.html ). Second malignancies and  non-AML/MDS  
secondary malignancies ( e.g., endometr ial cancer in a breast cancer patient receiving  tamoxifen) 
should NOT be reported via CTEP -AERS but should be submitted as part of the study results  via 
routine CDUS  reporting.  
 
10.1.4  Data Safety Monitoring  Plan 
 
The data and safety monitoring plan will involve the continuous evaluation of safety, data  quality 
and data timeliness. Investigators will conduct continuous review of data and patient safety  at 
their regular Disease Group meetings (at least monthly) and t he discussion will be documented  in 
the minutes. The PI of the trial will review toxicities and responses of the trial where  applicable 
at these disease center meetings and determine if the risk/benefit ratio of the trial  changes.  
Frequency and severity of  adverse events will be reviewed by the PI and compared to what  is 
known about the agent/device from other sources; including published literature,  scientific 
meetings and discussions with the sponsors, to determine if the trial should be terminated  before  
completion. Serious adverse events and responses will also be reviewed by the OSUCCC  Data 
and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). The PI will also submit a progress report  biannually 
for this Phase II study that will be reviewed by the committee per the D SMC plan. All  reportable 
Serious Adverse Events (SAE) will also be reported to the IRB of record as per the policies  of 
the IRB.  
 
10.2 Data  Reporting  
 
The OSU clinical trials’ office will be responsible for the submission of the CDUS data to  CTEP. 
This study wi ll be monitored by the Clinical Data Update System (CDUS) version  3.0. 
Cumulative CDUS data will be submitted quarterly to CTEP by electronic means. Reports  are 
due January 31, April 30, July 31, and October  31. 
 
Instructions for submitting data using the CDUS can be found on the CTEP web  site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/cdus.html ). 
 
10.3 CTEP Multicenter  Guidelines  
 
If an institution wishes to collaborate with other participating institutions in performing a  CTEP 
sponsored research protocol, then the following guidelines must be  followed.  
 
Responsibility of the Protocol Chair : Dr. Bhavana Konda serves as a protocol ch air for  this 
multi-center  study.  
NCI Protocol #: NCI-7609 
Version Date: 12/14/2017  
40  
  
• The Protocol Chair will be the single liaison with the CTEP Protocol  and 
Information Office (PIO). The Protocol Chair is responsible for the  coordination, 
development,  submission,  and approval  of the protocol  as well as its subsequent 
amendments. The protocol must not be rewritten or modified by anyone other  than 
the Protocol  Chair.  There  will be only one version  of the protocol,  and each 
participating institution will use that document. The Protocol Chair is  responsible 
for assuring  that all participating  institutions  are using  the correct  version  of the 
protocol.  
• The Protocol Chair is responsible for the overall conduct of the study at  all 
participating institutions and for monitoring its progress. All  reporting 
requirements to CTEP are the responsibility of the Protocol  Chair.  
• The Protocol Chair is responsible for the timely review of Adverse Events (AE)  to 
assure safety of the  patients.  
• The Protocol Chair will be responsible for the review of and timel y submission  of 
data for study  analysis.  
 
Responsibilities of the Coordinating Center : The Ohio State University serves as a  coordinating 
center for this multi -institutional  study.  
• Each  participating  institution  will have an appropriate  assurance  on file with the 
Office for Human Research Protection (OHRP), NIH. The Coordinating Center  is 
responsible for assuring that each participating institution has an OHRP  assurance 
and must maintain copies of IRB approvals from each participating  site. 
• Prior  to the activation  of the protocol  at each participating  institution,  an OHRP 
form 310 (documentation of IRB approval) must be submitted to the CTEP  PIO.  
• The Coordinating Center is responsible for central patient registration.  The 
Coordinating Center is responsibl e for assuring that IRB approval has  been 
obtained  at each participating  site prior to the first patient  registration  from that site. 
• The Coordinating  Center  is responsible  for the preparation  of all submitted  data for 
review by the Protocol  Chair.  
• The Coordinating Center will maintain documentation of AE reports.  The 
participating institutions must report directly to CTEP with a copy to  the 
Coordinating Center. The Coordinating Center will submit AE reports to  the 
Protocol Chair for timely  review.  
• Audits may be accomplished in one of two ways: (1) source documents  and 
research  records  for selected  patients  are brought  from participating  sites to the 
Coordinating Center for audit, or (2) selected patient records may be audited  on- 
site at participating sites. If the NCI chooses to have an audit at the  Coordinating 
Center, then the Coordinating Center is responsible for having all  source 
documents, research records, all IRB approval documents, NCI  Drug 
Accountability  Record  forms,  patient  registration  lists, response  assessments  scans,

11 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Study  design/Endpoints:  
 
Arm A and Arm  B 
 
The primary endpoint of this phase II study is to assess objective response rate  of 
sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) in metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma in setting  of 
inherited tumor syndromes as well as in setting of sporadic medullary  thyroid 
cancer.  
 
For t his Phase II study, we have chosen the minimax two -stage design of  Simon 
resulting  in a trial with two stages  with decisions  to continue  after 16 and 25 
response -evaluable patients are accrued to each cohort (Arms A and B) (Simon  et 
al., 1989).  
 
This design  minimizes  the expected  sample  size given  specified  alpha  and beta 
error rates. For example, we will define the true minimum response rate, p0 . This 
is a response probability, at which or below, we consider the agent to be  clinically 
unimportant, in effective, or uninteresting. Associated with this probability is  the 
alpha error rate, the probability of failing to reject an agent with a response rate  < 
p0. On the other hand, we will designate 'upper' target response rate, p1, with its 
associated error  rate, beta. The beta error is the probability of falsely rejecting  an 
agent with a response rate of > p1. Using exact binomial probabilities, the  Simon 
design generates two study sample sizes. At the first stage, if r1 or fewer  responses 
are observed  in n1 patients,  the study  is terminated.  If the number  of observed 
responses is greater than r1, the study is continued to the maximum sample size,  n. 
If in n patients, r or fewer responses are observed, the agent is  considered 
ineffective and no further study  is warranted. For the given p0, one can  calculate 
the expected sample size, EN (p0), and the probability of early termination,  PET 
(p0). 
NCI Protocol #: NCI-7609 
Version Date: 12/14/2017  
45  
  
 
We will consider sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) to be ineffective or uninteresting if  the 
true response [PR+CR using unidimensional RECIST/WHO response  criteria] 
probability is less than 10% (p0). We will also assume that the regimen is  worthy 
of further  study  if the true response  probability  or target  response  rate is 30% or 
greater (p1). These figures result in a two -stage design of 16 and 25 patients,  with 
an alpha  of 0.10 and beta of 0.10.  If one or no responses  are seen in the first 16 
response -evaluable patients, the study is terminated early and this regimen  is 
deemed ineffective for this patient population. If two or more patients respond  in 
the first 16, an additional  9 patients  are treated  for a total of 25. If 5 or more  patients 
respond of the 25, we will recommend that the regimen be studied further. If 25 
patients  are treated,  we will be able to estimate  the frequency  of response  with a 
95% confidence interval of not greater than  19.6%.  
 
Similarly,  the 25 patients  in each of Arms  A and B will allow  us to estimate  the 
probability of a specific toxicity to within 19.6% in each cohort. Any  toxicity 
occurring  with at least a 10% probability  has a 92.8%  chance  of being  seen at least 
once in 25 toxicity -evaluable  patients.  
 
11.2 Sample Size/Accrual  Rate:  
 
For this study  of 16 or 25 patients  in Arm A and 16 or 25 patients  in Arm B, we 
estimate  that we will accrue  3-4 patients  per month,  and meet  our total accrual  goal 
of 50 response -evaluable patients in 12 -16 months or  less. 
 
11.3 Analysis of secondary  endpoints:  
 
▪ To assess toxicity of sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) in patients with  metastatic 
medullary thyroid  carcinoma.  
▪ Measure  serum  tumor  markers  calcitonin  and carcinoma  embryonic  antigen  
(CEA) pre -, during -, and post -treatment to correlate with disease  response.  
▪ Correlate nuclear medicine functional imaging [F -18 fluorodeoxyglucose 
positron emission tomography (PET) scan] data obtained at pre -, during - and 
post-treatment with tumor  response.  
▪ Correlate  dynamic -contrast  enhanced  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (DCE -MRI)  
data obtained at pre -, during - and post -treatment with changes in  tumor 
permeability and vascularity with tumor  response.  
▪ Perform pharmacogenomic studies on procured PBMCs if clinical  responses 
are observed.  
▪ To correlate between the degree of Ras -MAPK sign aling inhibition  and 
vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF)  expression  in the tumor  and clinical 
response.  
▪ To correlate between the presence and type of RET gene defects in tumor  and 
clinical  response.  
NCI Protocol #: NCI-7609 
Version Date: 12/14/2017  
46  
  
With little preliminary data on the biological variability of tumor markers,  VEGF 
expression, ERK phosphorylation, RAS -MAPK signaling pathway  inhibition, 
DCE -MRI parameters, or their assay variation in our laboratories, it is difficult  to 
provide the usual  sample size estimates given specified levels of significance  and 
power. Our normal procedure is to use preliminary data of variation coupled  with 
clinically based definitions of reasonable differences to be evaluated to arrive  at 
objective sample size est imates. The 16 -patient estimate for estimating  a 
confidence interval for the objective response rate may be insufficient  for 
comparisons of biological  correlates.  
To address this concern, we will perform an initial analysis of data for  secondary 
endpoints  from the first eight patients.  This analysis  will be done solely  to estimate 
variance  and to compute  formal  sample  size estimates  based  on these  findings. 
While we assume that the 16 patients will provide a sample size sufficient to  give 
general indications of the effect of sorafenib (BAY 43 -9006) in cohorts for  Arms 
A and B, our interim  assessment  will allow  us to refine  the overall  sample  size 
estimate. Depending on biological and experimental variation, we will adjust  our 
definition  of a clinically  important  difference  using  specified  levels  of significance 
and power.  
 
11.4 Reporting and  Exclusions  
 
11.4.1  Evaluation of toxicity: All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of  their 
first treatment with sorafenib (BAY  43-9006).  
 
11.4.2  Evalua tion of response:  
▪ All patients included in the study must be assessed for response to treatment, even if  there 
are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible. Each patient will  be 
assigned one of the following categories: 1) complete res ponse, 2) partial response,  3) 
stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6)  early 
death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not  assessable, 
insufficient  data).  
▪ All of the patients who me t the eligibility criteria should be included in the main  analysis 
of the response rate.  Patients in response categories 4 -9 should be considered as  failing 
to respond to treatment (disease progression). Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule  or 
drug administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response  rate. 
Precise definitions for categories 4 -9 will be protocol  specific.  
▪ All conclusions should be based on all eligible  patients.  
▪ Sub-analyses may then be performed on the basis of a subset of patients, excluding  those 
for whom major protocol deviations have been identified (e.g., early death due to  other 
reasons, early discontinuation of treatment, major protocol violations, etc.).  However, 
these subanalyses may not serve a s the basis for drawing conclusions  concerning 
treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis should  be 
clearly  reported.  
▪ The 95% confidence intervals should be  provided.

Dynamic contrast enhanced MR I (DCE -MRI) will provide data revealing the changes in  the 
vascular perfusion and permeability characteristics of tumors. Successful biologic inhibition  will 
reduce  both vascular  perfusion  and permeability  causing  a decrease  in the peak and rate of contrast 
enhancement. Dynamic MRI therefore offers a more direct biologic 'in vivo' assessment  of 
therapeutic  efficacy.

 NCI Protocol #:  NCI-7609 
Version Date:  12/14/2017  
Imaging relevant components of the overall  protocol:  
 
Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE -MRI) will provide data revealing the changes in  the 
vascular perfusion and permeability characteristics of tumors. DCE -MRI therefore offers a  more  
direct 'in vivo' assessment of  efficacy.  
Imaging time is estimated at 45-60 minutes per  scan.  
Standard  morphologic  MRI sequences  (scanning  has to cover  all tumor  areas  in at least two planes  
(such as axial and coronal)) will be used for tumor size determin ation for all patients  undergoing 
DCE -MRI. These standard sequences (see 1 and 2 below) are performed without  contrast; 
sequences  used should  be the same  at all time points  for a given  patient.  These  standard  sequences 
are performed  at any time point requiring  tumor  size measurement.  At those  time points  where 
DCE -MRI is to be performed,  the DCE -MRI protocol  is performed  after the standard  pre-contrast 
sequences. The standard imaging follows your institutional protocol and should  include:  
1. T2 weighted ( Fast or turbo spin echo)  breath -hold 
2. T1 weighted Fast Multi -planar Gradient Recalled Echo  breath -hold 
Both sequences will be performed in the plane suitable to the studied body part. Axial will be  the 
standard  plane  with better  than 2.5 mm in plane  resolution  and 8 mm slice thickness.  Further  planes 
may be implemented as appropriate. The same plane and slice thickness must be used for  tumor 
measurements.  
Uni- and bi-dimensional  measurements  of disease  will be recorded  of all tumors  that can be 
measured and documented. These measurements and the clinical decision -making  accompanying 
the measurements will be made at the  site. 
At timepoints where DCE -MRI is being performed, prior to imaging, an IV cannula with a  long 
line is inserted into an arm v ein (the ante cubital fossa where possible) for contrast  injection.  
After completion of the standard sequences, the supervising radiologist will then plan a oblique  - 
coronal slice for the dynamic study which will include the target lesion and major artery  such as 
the aorta  or iliac artery.  This will remain  the studied  lesion  throughout  the trial. T1- and T2- 
weighted images should be used to select the target lesion and the position for the dynamic  image 
set. For consistency  the slice should  traverse  the mid-line of the tumor.  Where  possible  highly 
necrotic tumor lesions should NOT be selected for the  DCE -MRI.  
A T1-weighted  dynamic  contrast  enhanced  sequence  (3D spoiled  gradient  echo)  will then be 
performed.  
Three  additional  measurement  series  (5 repetit ions each)  similar  to the DCE  sequence  will be 
performed with three different low flip angles for normalization of MRI signal  data.  
A low molecular  weight  Gd-chelate  MRI contrast  agent  licensed  for i.v. use in humans  0.1 
mmol/kg body weight will be injected, preferably by power injector. Injection will  commence 
after  5th (fifth)  measurement  in order  to allow  a steady  state to develop  and to provide  baseline 
signal intensities. Power injector rate should be 0.6 ml/sec. Con trast injection is followed by a  20 
ml saline flush, also injected at the same speed. Contrast agent and injection technique should  be 
the same at each visit for a given  patient.  
57 NCI Protocol #: NCI-7609 
Version Date: 12/14/2017   
  
Because  the individual  measurements  are rapid,  breath -hold is not required.  As the plane  of 
imaging is in a coronal /oblique orientation, quiet breathing has to be  encouraged.  
From  this dynamic  imaging  sequence,  data will be obtained  showing  an increase  in signal  intensity  
in the various areas over time. The area of maximum enhancement of the tumor will be used  for 
the tumor  region  of interest  (ROI).  Regions  of interest  will also be taken  from a major  arterial  
vessel such as the  aorta.  
The signal  intensity  versus  time data for the tumor,  and the major  artery  (aorta,  carotid  or iliac 
artery)  will be graphed.  From  these  enhancement  curves,  several  parameters  will be calculated  
including the AUC under the contrast enhancement curve, peak enhancement, Ki and Ktrans  
(transfer coefficient, a parameter similar to Ki) as well as A [Amplitude] and kep [exchange  rate 
constant].  Where  necessary  for calculation,  the low flip angle  sequences  will be used to normalize  
data. Data will be presented as % of baseline value of a given  parameter.  
Studies  will be stored  in the PACS  system,  on MR manufacturer -specific  storage  media  as an exact  
copy for trial purposes and will be forward per FTP to the imaging  corelab.  
Clinical  decision -making will be made on the basis of on -site reading of tumor dimensions  from 
the standard  MR images.  DCE -MRI is done as laboratory  correlative  study  and will not be used to 
assess objective response per RECIST. An independent central analysis of combined  multi-site 
DCE -MRI data will be performed, but not used for clinical  care.  
 
The Imaging  Procedure:  
 
The following information details the imaging procedure. Please note that  this does not  detail 
information you will need to enter into the Case Report Form. The imaging procedure need to  be 
adhered  to, but was designed  to be comparable  with your local procedures.  The most unique  feature 
of this imaging  series  is the dynamic  imaging sequence  used to monitor  the contrast  agent  passage.  
 
Upon  registration  of the patient  for the exam  please  verify  that the patient  has signed  the informed 
consent  form.  
 
Please assign or get a unique trial patient identifier which will be used for identification  purposes 
in the anonymized image  assessment.  
 
Please  make  sure that the patient  understands  the imaging  procedure  and that her or his cooperation  
is essential for best quality. Please explain that multiple imaging sequences will be acquired  and 
that you will be giving instructions and comments via the  intercom.  
 
Prior to imaging an i.v. cannula with a long line is inserted into a vein in the arm (the ante  cubital 
fossa  where  possible)  for contrast  injection.  In the undesirable  event  that a different  route  of access 
has to be chosen, please document it  appropriatel y. 
 
The imaging procedure consists of the following  steps:  
i. Localizer  series  
ii. Pre-contrast  T2w 
NCI Protocol #: NCI-7609 
Version Date: 12/14/2017  
58  
  
iii. Pre-contrast  T1w 
iv. Pre-contrast low flip angle series (same parameters as the dynamic sequence, flip  angles  
set to 4°, 8° and  12°) 
v. Dynamic Series with injection of the contrast  agent  
vi. Post-contrast imaging as  necessary  
vii. Image archiving, clinical plus trial copy  
viii. Image anonymization and data transfer to the Imaging Core  Lab 
 
The overall imaging time is estimated at 45 minutes per procedure. Standard sequence  scanning 
should cover the whole liver including all tumor  areas.  
 
For the pre -contrast T1w scan, a T 1-weighted Fast Multi -planar Gradient Recalled Echo  or 
balanced -field echo (FIESTA, TRUEFISP) breath -hold sequence will be  used.  
 
For the T2 weighted  image  set, a Fast or Turbo  Spin Echo  breath -hold sequence  will be used.  Axial 
imaging  will be the standard  plane  with 8 mm slice thickness.  Further  planes  may be implemented 
as appropriate.  The same  plane  and slice thickness  must be used for tumor  measurements  in the 
follow up  procedures.  
 
The supervising radiologist will then plan the plane and location of the dynamic study which  will 
remain the evaluation (target) lesion throughout the trial for the specific patient. T1 and T2 
weighted images should be used to select the target lesion volu me. For consistency, the mid  slice 
should  traverse  the mid-line of the tumor.  Where  possible  highly  necrotic  tumors  or tumor  regions 
should not be selected.  
 
A pre-contrast  set of multi low flip angle  (12, 8 and 4 degrees)  3D SPGR  sequences  in the selected  
plane  and location  will be performed  to aid normalization  of MRI signal  data (T1 estimation ) 
immediately prior to the dynamic  series.  
 
A T1-weighted  dynamic  contrast  enhanced  sequence  (3D SPGR)  is then performed  with the 
following scan parameters (see also: Detailed parameter for the dynamic imaging  sequence) : 
 
14 slices  through  the representative  tumor  lesion,  7 mm each with no gap; sequential  imaging  
measurements will be repeated approximately every 10 seconds for about 8 minutes (at least  50 
measurements after contrast  injection).  
 
A commercially  available  MR-contrast  agent  for human  use should  be used at a dosage  of 0.1 
mmol/kg body  weight.  
 
The pre ferable method of contrast agent injection is a power injector. Injection is started after  the 
first 5 measurements  (data  sets) in the continuous  dynamic  series  to allow  a steady  state to develop 
and provide  baseline  signal  intensities.  Power  injector  rate should  be 0.6 ml/sec.  Contrast  injection 
need to be followed by a 20 ml saline flush injected at the same rate. If hand injection is done,  it 
should be performed as a rapid bolus through a long line of tubing which has been filled with  the 
MR contrast age nt. Contrast agent and injection technique should be the same at each visit for  a 
given  patient.  
NCI Protocol #: NCI-7609 
Version Date: 12/14/2017  
59  
  
 
As the individual  measurements  are rapid,  breath  hold is not required.  The patient  is to be 
instructed  to use shallow  breathing.  As the plane  of imaging  should  be in a coronal  /oblique - 
coronal orientation, quiet breathing does not move the volume of interest out of the imaging  slab. 
 
From this acquisition series, data will be obtained showing an increase in signal intens ity due  to 
the contrast agent passage of the various areas over time. The area of maximum enhancement  of 
the tumor  will be used for the tumor  region  of interest  (ROI).  Regions  of interest  will also be taken  
from a major arterial vessel to assess the vascular enhancement and kinetics. From  the 
enhancement  curves,  several  parameters  will be calculated.  For some  quantifications,  the T1 
estimation sequence (three low flip angles), will be used to normalize  data.  
 
A post -contrast T1w  scan can be acquired similar to the pre -contrast T 1-weighted  scan.  
 
After completion of the imaging, data storage and data preparation for the off -site, core  lab 
assessment needs to be  performed.  
 
Images should  be: 
A, stored in the same procedure as standard clinical patients at the local site for local patient  care 
and assessment  
B, an additional data -backup of the complete imaging set should be done onto CD (preferable)  or 
magneto -optical  disk. 
C, the complete  data set should  be anonymized  and transferred  via secure  FTP to the imaging  core 
lab as outlined in the data transfer  section . 
 
Clinical decision -making will be made on the basis of on -site reading of tumor dimensions  from 
the standard MR  images.  
 
An independe nt central  analysis  of combined  multi-site DCE -MRI data will be performed,  but 
these evaluations will not be used for clinical decision  making.  
 
Relative exclusion Criteria to MRI  imaging  
Patients who  have:  
1. Cardiac  pacemaker  
2. Ferromagnetic metal implants not authorized for use in MRI such as some types  of 
cerebral aneurysm  clips 
3. Claustrophobia not helped by  pre-medications  
4. Obesity (exceeding the equipment  limits)  
5. In case, MRIs are not suitable for evaluating response per RECIST  criteria  
 
 
In these  patients  who have a contraindication  to MRI imaging,  other  radiologic  imaging  (i.e. CXR 
and CT scans) must be used to assess response as outlined in the clinical trial  protocol.

 NCI Protocol #:  NCI-7609 
Version Date:  12/14/2017  
Data  Transfer:  
Overview:  
Imaging data will be stored using the local onsite storage procedure (PACS) and on an  additional 
copy of manufacturer  -specific  storage  media.  Electronic  storage  of data to a common  media  such 
as CD or optical disc in DICOM format is the preferred method of secondary  storage.  
 
The study data will be transferred to an imaging core lab for off -site analysis. The data  transfer 
should  be perfo rmed  preferably  via secure  FTP to facilitate  rapid  review  of the imaging  studies;  if 
these  direct  data transfers  can not be achieved,  then an express  shipment  of data in a digital  format 
such as CD will be  arranged.  
 
The imaging  data will be anonymized  at the central  image  analysis  laboratory  and a secure  master  
file will be generated  for cross -referencing.  The imaging  corelab  will review  the imaging  study  for 
technical and quality control and provide feedback in case of identifiable problems. The  imaging  
corelab will also perform image analysis of the DCE -MRI by placing ROIs and generating  signal  
intensity  data, which  will then be quantified  using  different  quantitative  methods  as outlined 
above. Volumetric data will be quantified whenever possible to all ow comparison  between 
dynamic  MRI parameters  and tumor  size changes.  The local imaging  site will have access  via 
secure web -link to the placed ROIs and source signal intensity plots for review and comment  of 
its own performed  cases.  
 
Details:  
All data will be handled  in DICOM  format  and all data management  will adhere  to GCP  and other 
established guidelines. The following information details the data transfer procedure. Please  note 
that this does not detail information you will need to enter into the Case R eport  Form.  
 
As mentioned in the imaging section, the local site needs to generate safe and secure backups  for 
their local needs including patient care and should generate a CD backup (preferable) or  Optical 
Disk as a second source of data for this trial. These backup data will be collected per  request.  
 
Initiation of data  transfer:  
This procedure is being used until all firewall issues within the local institution are resolved.  The 
recommended  software  is WS-FTP and a copy was provided  during  the initial  site visit. Copies 
can be requested form the Imaging Core Lab and copies as well as updates will be placed  within 
the software subdirectory of the FTP  account.  
Any FTP software can be used to initiate access to the FTP Server of the Imaging Core  Lab.

Once  you have access  to be main directory,  change  to the data directory,  create  a new directory 
with the anoymized  identifier.  You can also use the unique  DICOM  identifier  generate  by your 
PACS system if you so choose. Then just upload or copy your imaging  files. 
 
Once the upload is completed, please send an e -mail to McKenney. -1@medctr.osu.edu  to inform 
the imaging  core lab, that the study  has been completely  uploaded  from your site, report  the patient 
weight and the place of injection  site 
 
The imaging core lab will review the received data and will generate a confirmation e -mail that 
the data have been received and appear readable. Once the case is analyzed, a detailed report  and 
access information will be send to you local imaging  investigator.

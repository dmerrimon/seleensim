Protocol Title: Protocol 331-201-00191: A Phase 3, Multicenter, Open-label 
Trial to Evaluate the Long-term Safety and Tolerability of 
Brexpiprazole (OPC-34712) in the Treatment of Children and 
Adolescents with Irritability Associated with Autism Spectrum 
Disorder
Clinical Phase/Trial 
Type:3/Safety extension
Treatment Indication: Irritability associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
Objective(s): Primary: To assess the long-term safety and tolerability of 
brexpiprazole monotherapy in children and adolescents with 
irritability associated with ASD.
Secondary: To assess the long-term efficacy of brexpiprazole 
monotherapy in children and adolescents with irritability 
associated with ASD.
Trial Design: This is a phase 3, multicenter, open-label trial designed to 
assess the long-term safety and tolerability of oral 
brexpiprazole as treatment in children and adolescents with 
irritability in ASD. The trial is planned to be conducted on an 
outpatient basis. Enrollment into the trial will be drawn from 
eligible subjects who completed the treatment period in the 
double-blind, phase 3 efficacy trial (331-201-00148 [8 weeks 
of treatment]) and, in the investigator’s judgment, could 
potentially benefit from continued investigational treatment 
with oral brexpiprazole. 
The trial will be conducted as follows:
Screening/Baseline: Subjects who completed the treatment 
period of the double-blind trial and were deemed compliant 
with the protocol will be screened for eligibility at the last visit 
of the double-blind trial (Week 8). A separate fully executed 
informed consent/assent will be obtained for 
Trial 331-201-00191 before any procedures specific to the 
open-label trial are performed. The assessments from the last 
visit of the double-blind trial will serve as the baseline 
measures for Trial 331-201-00191 for any assessment that is Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

updated, if necessary.
Open-label Treatment Phase: Eligible subjects from 
Trial 331-201-00148 will receive 26 weeks of daily treatment 
with open-label brexpiprazole. Visits will occur at the end of 
Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 14, 18, 22, and 26. Visits at Week 2, 
Week 14, and Week 26 will occur at the clinic. All other visits 
may be conducted either virtually or in clinic. Where the 
investigator and caregiver make the decision to conduct a visit 
virtually, the visit will be conducted by means of 
telecommunications technology. The caregiver and the subject 
will remain in their own home and complete trial assessments 
and questionnaires via an online technology. The caregiver and 
subject will interact with trial personnel using online 
communication tools which incorporate telemedicine. During 
virtual interactions (and at any other time), the trial personnel 
will be able to assess the subject and determine if an additional 
in-office visit for a physical evaluation is required at the 
discretion of the investigator.
Subjects from Trial 331-201-00148 will follow the 
titration/dosing schedule in the table below. Dose titrations 
will be performed in conjunction with a trial visit and 
therefore, trial visit windows are allowed for the titration 
schedule. As in the parent trial, the titration/dosing schedule 
will be based on body weight. Body weight at the Week 8 
double-blind visit/baseline visit for Trial 331-201-00191 will 
be used to determine the starting dose. The body weight of the 
subject at this time will determine dose requirements 
throughout the trial. Those subjects with body weight < 50 kg 
will receive a target dose range of 1 to 1.5 mg, and those 
subjects with body weight ≥ 50 kg will receive a target dose 
range of 1.5 to 3 mg.

Protocol 331-201-00191
Confidential - Proprietary Information 7 Version 6.0, 07 Jul 2022Statistical Methods: The sample size is not based on statistical considerations, but 
rather on the number of subjects rolling over from the parent trial (Trial 331-201-00148). The trial population will be derived from eligible subjects who completed the parent trial. The sample size of this open-label trial will be limited by the number of subjects enrolled into the parent trial.  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for all efficacy and 
safety variables. No inferential statistical analyses are planned for this open-label trial.  
Trial Duration: The duration of this trial from first subject enrolled to last 
subject completed is estimated to be approximately 36 months. Individual participation for rollover subjects who complete the trial without early withdrawal will be approximately 29 weeks, consisting of a 26-week open-label treatment period, and a 21 (± 2)-day follow-up. &OLQLFDO6WXG\5HSRUW 3URWRFRODQG3URWRFRO $PHQGPHQWV

Protocol 331-201-00191
Confidential - Proprietary Information 18 Version 6.0, 07 Jul 20221 Introduction
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition  (DSM-5) criteria as 
deficits in reciprocal social communication and social interaction (verbal and 
nonverbal).1 The severity of ASD is defined by the degree of restricted, repetitive 
patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. Symptoms are present from early childhood 
and contribute to difficulties in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships.
In addition to the core symptoms that characterize the disorder, children and adolescents 
with ASD often suffer from problem behaviors such as symptoms of irritability and 
aggression, which may manifest as tantrums, self-injury, and aggressive behaviors toward 
others.2 Approximately 20% of people with ASD exhibit irritability and aggression3 with 
> 50% exhibiting significant emotion dysregulation.4 Irritability and aggression often 
negatively affect the lives of people with ASD and their families. 
The prevalence of ASD in the pediatric population in the United States (US) has 
increased over the past decade from estimates of 1 in 150 (0.67%) in 2000 to 1 in 
68 (1.46%) in 2012, with increases occurring in all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic 
groups (Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, 11 sites).5 In 2011, 
the total costs per year for children with ASD in the US were estimated at between 
$11.5 billion and $60.9 billion which could be attributed to medical care, special 
education, and lost parental productivity.6 
At present, the atypical antipsychotics risperidone and aripiprazole are the only 
medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment 
of irritability associated with ASD.7 
With regard to the safety profile of atypical antipsychotics, available data across 
indications suggest that children and adolescents are at higher risk than adults for 
experiencing sedation, acute extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), withdrawal dyskinesia, 
and significant weight gain during treatment.8,9 For patients with ASD, the common side 
effects of these medications10 are likely to further isolate children and adolescents from 
social interaction. Thus, there is a need to identify additional efficacious agents for 
children with psychiatric disorders, especially considering the safety and tolerability 
issues that may be associated with the use of selected antipsychotics in children and 
adolescents.11 Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 331-201-00191
Confidential - Proprietary Information 19 Version 6.0, 07 Jul 2022Brexpiprazole (also referred to as OPC-34712 and Lu AF41156) is an atypical 
antipsychotic synthesized by Otsuka that is being codeveloped by Otsuka and Lundbeck. 
Brexpiprazole (OPC-34712) is currently approved in the US as monotherapy for the 
treatment of schizophrenia and for use as an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the 
treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. While the precise mechanism of 
action of brexpiprazole in treating psychiatric conditions is unknown, the pharmacology 
of brexpiprazole is believed to be mediated by a combination of high binding affinity and 
functional activities at multiple monoaminergic receptors. 
1.1 Nonclinical Data
A complete description of the available data from nonclinical studies, including 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicology studies in different animal species, can be found 
in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).12 
1.2 Clinical Data
Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data, as well as data from 
schizophrenia and MDD are summarized below. A complete description of the available 
data from clinical trials can be found in the IB.12 
1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics
The PK of single and multiple doses of brexpiprazole was studied in healthy subjects and 
in subjects with MDD, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and 
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Based on preclinical data and human clinical 
trials, brexpiprazole (OPC-34712) and one metabolite, DM-3411, were identified as the 
major analytes that are present in human plasma. In vitro, the activity of DM-3411 is 
17 times lower than that of brexpiprazole and thus is considered as an inactive 
metabolite. Both brexpiprazole and DM-3411 PK were linear following single oral doses 
of brexpiprazole 0.2 to 8 mg to healthy subjects. The terminal phase elimination half-life 
of brexpiprazole and DM-3411 was 48.3 to 80.8 hours and 48.6 to 77.5 hours, 
respectively. The median time to maximum (peak) plasma concentration (t max) occurred 
at approximately 2 to 6 hours postdose for brexpiprazole and at approximately 10 to 
24 hours postdose for DM-3411. In healthy subjects, administration of single-dose 
brexpiprazole with a high-fat meal did not affect its rate and extent of absorption.
Steady state PK also appeared to be linear following multiple daily doses of 
brexpiprazole in the range of 0.5 to 2 mg to healthy subjects. The accumulation factor

Protocol 331-201-00191
Confidential - Proprietary Information 20 Version 6.0, 07 Jul 2022curve calculated to the last observable concentration at time t was approximately 4 times. 
After multiple dose administration of brexpiprazole (1 to 12 mg/day) to subjects with 
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, brexpiprazole and DM-3411 mean terminal 
elimination half-life at steady state was 95.4 and 89.3 hours, respectively; median t max 
was 3.0 and 8.0 hours, respectively.
In drug interaction trials in healthy subjects, brexpiprazole was shown to be metabolized 
by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and CYP2D6 isozymes and was not an inhibitor of 
CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, or P-glycoprotein. Co-administration of potent CYP3A4 
or CYP2D6 inhibitors with brexpiprazole resulted in about a 2-fold higher exposure and 
about a 1.5-fold increase in the terminal elimination half-life of brexpiprazole.
In a single-dose trial in healthy subjects, approximately 46.0% and 24.6% of 
administered radioactivity following an oral dose of 14C-brexpiprazole was excreted in 
feces and urine, respectively. In this same trial, brexpiprazole did not preferentially bind 
to red blood cells. Brexpiprazole showed high protein binding in human serum (  99.8%) 
in vitro.
In Trial 331-201-00103, a phase 1 pediatric trial to assess PK and safety of oral 
brexpiprazole in children age 6 to < 13 years old with central nervous system (CNS) 
disorders, mean apparent clearance of drug from plasma after extravascular 
administration (CL/F) of brexpiprazole of 1.5 or 3 mg in children 10 to < 13 years old 
was comparable with that observed in adults following a single dose of brexpiprazole 
2 mg. Dose proportionality was observed within treatment cohorts (ie, within the same 
age range) and children in the younger age group (6 to < 10 years old) appeared to have 
slightly higher brexpiprazole and DM-3411 exposure and lower brexpiprazole CL/F as 
compared with children in the older group (10 to < 13 years old).
Trial 331-10-233 was a phase 1, multicenter, open-label dose escalation trial to assess the 
safety, tolerability, and PK of oral brexpiprazole in adolescents with schizophrenia or 
other related psychiatric disorders. In Trial 331-10-233, overall systemic exposure was 
measured by dose-normalized maximum concentration at steady state ( Cmax,ss ) and area 
under the plasma concentration-time curve to the last observable concentration (AUCτ), 
and was slightly higher (geometric mean ratio [GMR] adult/adolescent: 0.765 and 0.904, 
respectively), and CL/F was slightly lower (GMR adult/adolescent: 1.11) in adolescents 
compared to adults in the more important PK evaluable population. For the less important 
PK population, slightly lower dose-normalized AUCs from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC 0-24h) 
(GMR adult/adolescent: 1.05), and slightly higher dose-normalized maximized Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

compared to adults. The difference in the results for the 2 populations may be due to 
potential noncompliance, especially in the lower dose groups (0.5 and 1.0 mg), when 
dosing was not under medical supervision.
1.2.2 Schizophrenia
The efficacy of brexpiprazole as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with 
schizophrenia has been studied in 2 completed placebo-controlled trials 
(Trials 331-10-230 and 331-10-231), a long-term maintenance trial (Trial 331-10-232), 
and a long-term safety trial (Trial 331-10-237), and was approved for the treatment of 
schizophrenia in adults (ages 18 to 65 years) by the US FDA on 10 Jul 2015. 
Brexpiprazole is currently being studied for the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents 
13 to 17 years old in the double-blind Trial 331-10-234 and open-label Trial 331-10-236.
1.2.3 Major Depressive Disorder
The efficacy of brexpiprazole as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of MDD has been 
studied in 3 completed placebo-controlled trials (Trials 331-10-227, 331-10-228, and 
331-13-214) and a long-term, open-label safety trial (Trial 331-10-238). A double-blind, 
placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of brexpiprazole 
(Trial 331-201-00079) is currently ongoing. Brexpiprazole was approved in the US on 
10 Jul 2015 in adult patients for use as an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the 
treatment of MDD.
1.2.4 Autism Spectrum Disorder
There is 1 planned double-blind trial (Trial 331-201-00148) in pediatric subjects with 
ASD. 
1.3 Known and Potential Risks and Benefits
As of 17 Apr 2021, the brexpiprazole clinical development program consisted of a total 
of 97 clinical trials conducted in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia 
(77 completed and 20 ongoing). This total includes 77 trials conducted under US 
Investigational New Drug applications (INDs) (65 completed and 12 ongoing) for 
schizophrenia, adjunctive treatment of MDD, adjunctive treatment of ADHD, agitation 
associated with dementia of the Alzheimer’s type (AAD), post-traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD), or bipolar disorder; and 20 non-US IND trials (12 completed and 8 ongoing in 
China, Japan, and Canada) conducted in healthy subjects, subjects with schizophrenia, 
subjects with MDD, and subjects with AAD.Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

22
Protocol 331-201-00191
Confidential - Proprietary Information 22 Version 6.0, 07 Jul 2022Safety data are available from the 76 completed clinical trials. The total number of 
subjects exposed to either single or multiple doses of brexpiprazole is composed of 
9831 subjects in trials conducted under US IND applications and 876 subjects 
(collectively) in non-US IND trials conducted in Japan, China, and South Korea.
Combined data from the completed phase 1 clinical trials indicate that the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) for healthy adult subjects was determined to be 6 mg after single-
dose administration and 2 mg after once-daily, multiple-dose (14 days) administration. 
The MTD of brexpiprazole in subjects with schizophrenia, MDD, AAD, ADHD, or 
bipolar disorder has not been established. Data from completed phase 1 clinical trials 
indicate that brexpiprazole is tolerated at multiple oral doses up to 12 mg/day in subjects 
with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder; up to 4 mg/day when coadministered with 
marketed antidepressant therapy in subjects with MDD; up to 3 mg/day in elderly 
subjects (70 - 85 years of age) with MDD; and up to 4 mg/day when coadministered with 
marketed stimulant therapy in subjects with ADHD. 
Overall, 69.6% of subjects who received brexpiprazole either alone or coadministered 
with another marketed medication reported at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event 
(TEAE, with ≥ 2% incidence in total brexpiprazole and more than placebo). The most 
frequently reported TEAEs (incidence ≥ 5% of the total brexpiprazole group and more 
than total placebo) in all subjects who received brexpiprazole were increased weight 
(11.7%), headache (8.9%), insomnia (7.5%), akathisia (7.3%), somnolence (6.0%), and 
dizziness (5.2%). In the total placebo group, headache (8.4%) was the most frequently 
reported TEAE (incidence ≥ 5% of subjects). The majority of TEAEs reported in 61 
pooled completed brexpiprazole clinical trials under US INDs were mild or moderate in 
severity.
A total of 33 deaths have been reported in the brexpiprazole interventional clinical trials 
as of the cutoff date of 17 Apr 2021: 30 deaths in the US IND trials and 3 deaths in the 
non-US IND trials. Nine deaths occurred in schizophrenia trials, 12 deaths in MDD trials, 
9 deaths in the AAD trials, and 3 deaths in PTSD trials. One death, a completed suicide, 
was considered by the investigator to be related to investigational medicinal product 
(IMP).
Serious TEAEs have been reported for 415 subjects who received brexpiprazole (either 
alone or coadministered with another medication) in the 61 completed trials conducted 
under the US INDs, and in 58 subjects in the 12 completed non-US IND trials. Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 331-201-00191
Confidential - Proprietary Information 23 Version 6.0, 07 Jul 2022Overall, 9.3% of subjects who received brexpiprazole (either alone or coadministered 
with another medication) and 4.5% of subjects who received placebo (either alone or 
coadministered with another medication) discontinued from IMP due to TEAEs in 61 
pooled completed brexpiprazole trials conducted under the US INDs as of the cutoff date 
of 17 Apr 2021. Overall, 10.6% of subjects who received brexpiprazole discontinued 
from IMP due to TEAEs in completed non-US IND trials.    
In the phase 1, pediatric Trial 331-201-00103, brexpiprazole was safe and well tolerated 
at single oral doses of 0.75 to 1.5 mg in subjects 6 to < 10 years old and 1.5 to 3 mg in 
subjects 10 to < 13 years old with CNS disorders including, but not limited to, ADHD, 
autism-spectrum disorders, bipolar I disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant 
disorder, or any psychotic disorder. The most frequently reported TEAE (> 1 subject) 
was nausea. Additionally, in Trial 331-10-233, multiple oral doses of 0.5 to 4 mg/day 
brexpiprazole in subjects 13 to 17 years old with schizophrenia or other related 
psychiatric disorders were safe and well tolerated. The observed IMP-related TEAEs 
were similar in both trials.
The recommended dose ranges are as follows: 2 to 4 mg/day for the treatment of 
schizophrenia in adults and 2 to 3 mg/day in adult subjects with MDD. The following 
dose ranges of brexpiprazole were selected for evaluation in additional clinical trials (by 
indication): 0.5 to 3 mg/day in adult subjects with AAD, 1 to 3 mg/day in adult subjects 
with PTSD, and 2 to 4 mg/day in adult subjects with bipolar disorder.

safety data.12 
2 Trial Rationale and Objectives
2.1 Trial Rationale
Trial 331-201-00191 is being conducted to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability 
of brexpiprazole in children and adolescent subjects with irritability in ASD 
(ages 5 - 17 years) who have completed the corresponding double-blind, phase 3 efficacy 
trial, Trial 331-201-00148. 
2.2 Dosing Rationale
Two clinical trials have been conducted to investigate the PK, safety, and tolerability of 
brexpiprazole in children and adolescent patients with schizophrenia or other CNS 
disorders: in Trial 331-10-233, subjects 13 to 17 years old received multiple daily doses Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 331-201-00191
Confidential - Proprietary Information 24 Version 6.0, 07 Jul 2022of brexpiprazole 0.5 to 4 mg; and in Trial 331-201-00103, subjects 6 to 13 years old 
received single doses of brexpiprazole 0.75, 1.5, or 3 mg.
In order to guide dose selection of brexpiprazole in adolescents 5 to 17 years of age with 
irritability associated with ASD, a population PK model was developed using PK data from the 2 PK trials in children and adolescents (Trial 331-10-233 and Trial 331-201-00103) and 3 PK trials in healthy adults or adults with schizophrenia (Trials , 
 and ) in healthy or schizophrenic subjects. In this model, 
clearance and volume of distribution were allometrically scaled by body weight (raised to the power of 0.75 for clearance, and 1 for volume of distribution); poor and ultra-rapid CYP2D6 metabolizers were excluded in the analysis data; when needed for simulation, the effect of CYP2D6 metabolic status on clearance can be imputed using the value reported in the adult population PK model previously submitted. The allometrically scaled PK model adequately described the PK data in adults, children, and adolescents. Pharmacokinetic simulations were performed using this model to predict systemic exposure of brexpiprazole in adults and adolescents given different doses of 
brexpiprazole. Target exposure used for the simulations of ASD in subjects 5 to 17 years 
of age was similar to that of the adult subjects with MDD (0.5 - 3 mg/day).
Brexpiprazole systemic exposure, represented AUC τ were simulated and the 5th, median, 
and 95th percentiles were compared between children or adolescents 5 to 17 years of age 
and adult subjects with MDD. Based on the simulation result and clinical considerations, a weight cutoff at 50 kg was suggested to make sure subjects receive appropriate dose; and the following was observed:
•AUCτ following 0.25 mg in children and adolescents <50 kg and AUC τ following 
0.5 mg in children and adolescents ≥ 50 kg are comparable with that following 
0.5 mg in adult subjects.
•AUCτ following 1.5 mg in children and adolescents <50 kg and AUC τ following 
3 mg in children and adolescents ≥ 50 kg are comparable with that following 3 mg in 
adult subjects.
Based on PK simulation, starting and maximum doses were determined. Pharmacokinetic 
profiles following the proposed titration/dosing schedule was also simulated and 
compared with the titration schedule in ongoing trials in adult subjects with bipolar I disorder. The dosing schedules for this trial, based on simulation results and clinical considerations are shown in Table 3.2-1 . &OLQLFDO6WXG\5HSRUW 3URWRFRODQG3URWRFRO $PHQGPHQWV

Confidential - Proprietary Information 25 Version 6.0, 07 Jul 20222.3 Trial Objectives
The primary objective is to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of brexpiprazole 
monotherapy in children and adolescents with irritability in ASD.
The secondary objective is to assess the long-term efficacy of brexpiprazole monotherapy 
in children and adolescents with irritability in ASD.
3 Trial Design
This is a multicenter, open-label trial designed to assess the long-term safety and 
tolerability of oral brexpiprazole as treatment in children and adolescents with irritability 
in ASD. The trial is planned to be conducted on an outpatient basis. Enrollment into the 
trial will be drawn from eligible subjects who completed the treatment period in the 
double-blind, phase 3 efficacy trial, Trial 331-201-00148 (8 weeks of treatment) and, in 
the investigator’s judgment, could potentially benefit from continued investigational 
treatment with oral brexpiprazole. 
The trial will be conducted as follows:
Screening/Baseline: Subjects who completed the treatment period of the double-blind 
trial and were deemed compliant with the protocol will be screened for eligibility at the 
last visit of the double-blind trial (Week 8). A separate fully executed informed 
consent/assent will be obtained for Trial 331-201-00191 before any procedures specific 
to the open-label trial are performed. The assessments from the last visit of the double-
blind trial will serve as the baseline measures for Trial 331-201-00191 for any assessment 
that is not unique to the open-label trial. Medical history will be updated, if necessary.
Open-label Treatment Phase: Eligible subjects from Trial 331-201-00148 will receive 
26 weeks of daily treatment with open-label brexpiprazole in Trial 331-201-00191, as 
described in Section 3.7. Visits will occur at the end of Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 14, 18, 22, 
and 26. 
The baseline, Week 2, Week 14, and Week 26 visits will occur in the clinic. All other 
visits may be conducted either virtually or in clinic. Where the investigator and caregiver 
make the decision to conduct a visit virtually, the visit will be conducted by means of 
telecommunications technology. The caregiver and the subject will remain in their own 
home and complete trial assessments and questionnaires via an online technology. The 
caregiver and subject will interact with trial personnel using online communication tools 
which incorporate telemedicine. During virtual interactions (and at any other time), the Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Confidential - Proprietary Information 26 Version 6.0, 07 Jul 2022trial personnel will be able to assess the subject and determine if an additional in-office 
visit for a physical evaluation is required at the discretion of the investigator.
Follow-up: Subjects will have a follow-up contact 21 (± 2) days after the last dose of 
open-label brexpiprazole.

Brexpiprazole will be supplied by the sponsor or designated agent in child-resistant 
blister cards, each containing sufficient tablets for 7 (+ 2) days. All doses of open-label 
brexpiprazole are to be taken orally once daily and can be administered without regard to 
meals. Every effort should be made to administer the open-label brexpiprazole at the 
same time every day, preferably in the morning. 
The first dose of open-label brexpiprazole will be taken the following day after the last 
dose of double-blind IMP is taken in the parent trial so that treatment continues without 
interruption. Whenever possible, it is anticipated that the last dose of IMP in the double-
blind, phase 3 efficacy trial will be taken on the day of the baseline visit for the open-
label trial. Subjects should not be dosed using double-blind and open-label IMP on the 
same day.  
Titration/Dosing Instructions:
Subjects will follow the titration/dosing schedule in Table 3.2-1. As in the parent trial, the 
tit
ration/dosing schedule will be based on body weight. Body weight at the Week 8 
double-blind visit/baseline visit for Trial 331-201-00191 will be used to determine the 
starting dose. The body weight of the subject at this time will determine titration/dose 
requirements throughout the trial. Those subjects with body weight < 50 kg will receive a 
target dose range of 1 to 1.5 mg, and those subjects with body weight ≥ 50 kg will receive 
a target dose range of 1.5 to 3 mg.

Protocol 331-201-00191
Confidential - Proprietary Information 29 Version 6.0, 07 Jul 2022Subjects with body weight < 50 kg will receive brexpiprazole at a dose of 0.25 mg for 
Days 1 to 3, 0.5 mg for Days 4 to 7, and 1.0 mg for Days 8 to 14. Day 15 is the earliest 
opportunity that the investigator can increase to the maximum dose of 1.5 mg within the 
target dose range. The decision to increase the dose to 1.5 mg and when to increase the 
dose will be based on investigator judgment in order to reach a desired therapeutic effect. 
Subjects with body weight ≥ 50 kg will receive brexpiprazole at a dose of 0.5 mg for 
Days 1 to 3, 1.5 mg for Days 4 to 7, and 2 mg for Days 8 to 14. Day 15 is the earliest 
opportunity that the investigator can increase to the maximum dose of 3 mg within the 
target dose range. The decision to increase the dose to 3 mg and when to increase the 
dose will be based on investigator judgment in order to reach a desired therapeutic effect. 
For all subjects, doses can be down-titrated due to tolerability based on investigator 
judgment. Subjects < 50 kg should receive a dose of 1.5 mg before decreasing the dose to 
1 mg. Subjects ≥ 50 kg should receive a dose of 2 mg before decreasing the dose to 
1.5 mg and 3 mg before decreasing to 2 mg. 
If a subject with body weight < 50 kg is unable to tolerate the 1 mg dose, the subject will 
be discontinued. If a subject with body weight ≥ 50 kg is unable to tolerate the 1.5 mg, 
the subject will be discontinued.
Dose titrations will be performed in conjunction with a trial visit and therefore, trial visit 
windows are allowed for the titration schedule. 
To accommodate maximum flexibility in dosing for the subjects with irritability 
associated with ASD, more than 1 dose decrease or increase will be allowed during the 
open-label period. Any increase or decrease, however, should happen in a stepwise 
fashion based on investigator discretion to change dose based on therapeutic effect or 
tolerability according to Table 3.2-1.  
Depending on the visit, IMP will be dispensed either at a clinic visit or delivery will be 
made to a subject’s home. The IMP for dose increases or decreases occurring between 
scheduled visits will be dispensed as an unscheduled visit and accommodations arranged 
to have IMP received by the subject/caregiver, either by home delivery or pickup at the 
site. Instructions will be supplied to the subject/caregiver by trial/team support staff 
regarding any dosing changes.  Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Confidential - Proprietary Information 30 Version 6.0, 07 Jul 20223.3 Trial Population
3.3.1 Description of Population
The trial population will include children and adolescent rollover subjects from the 
double-blind, phase 3 efficacy trial of brexpiprazole monotherapy: Trial 331-201-00148 
(irritability in ASD). 
Subjects with a DSM-5 diagnosis of ASD who have completed Trial 331-201-00148 may 
be enrolled into this open-label trial. All subjects are required to meet enrollment criteria 
for Trial 331-201-00191 prior to entering the trial.
3.3.2 Subject Selection and Numbering
Subjects will retain their subject identification (ID) numbers from the parent trial and are 
required to sign a new informed consent form (ICF) and assent form for this trial, as 
applicable.
3.4 Eligibility Criteria
3.4.1 Informed Consent/Assent
Informed consent/assent will be freely obtained from all subjects (or their guardian or 
legally acceptable representative, as applicable for local laws). Consent and assent will be 
documented on an electronic or written ICF and informed assent form (IAF). The 
ICF/IAF will be approved by the same institutional review board/independent ethics 
committee (IRB/IEC) that approves this protocol. Subjects who are too young to sign an 
ICF/IAF either via wet signature or electronic signature (e-signature) will provide 
informed assent per local law, and the subject must be able to understand that he or she 
can withdraw from the trial at any time and for any reason.
Each ICF/IAF will comply with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guideline13 and local regulatory requirements. The 
investigator will ensure that the sponsor reviews and authorizes any site-specific ICF/IAF 
used in the trial before submission to the IRB/IEC. 
Investigators may discuss trial availability and the possibility for entry with a potential 
subject without first obtaining consent/assent. However, informed consent/assent must be 
obtained and documented prior to initiation of any procedures that are performed solely 
for the purpose of determining eligibility for research, including withdrawal from current 
medication(s). Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

31
Protocol 331-201-00191
Confidential - Proprietary Information 31 Version 6.0, 07 Jul 2022Potential subjects are free to refuse entry into the trial, or withdraw from the trial at any 
time, without justification, and there will be no consequences to their further care.
Once appropriate essential information has been provided and fully explained in 
layman’s language to the subject and/or his/her parent/legal guardian or legally 
acceptable representative, as applicable by the investigator (or a qualified designee), and 
it has been documented that the subject and his/her parent/legal guardian or legally 
acceptable representative has had the opportunity to ask questions, the IRB/IEC-approved 
written ICF/IAF will be signed and dated by the subject, the subject’s legally acceptable 
representative (eg, guardian), and the person obtaining consent/assent (investigator or 
designee), as well as by any other parties required by the IRB/IEC. The subject will 
receive a copy of the signed ICF/IAF; the original shall be kept on file by the 
investigator.
At sites where the electronic ICF/IAF application is used, prospective trial participants 
will be provided with controlled access to the application by trial site staff. When the trial 
site staff and the participant agree that the participant has enough information to make an 
informed decision to participate, the participant will electronically sign the ICF/IAF in 
the electronic ICF application and an electronic date and timestamp will be applied to the 
signature. The subject will be given a printed, signed copy of the ICF/IAF. Any other 
parties required by the IRB/IEC (trial site staff, witnesses, or legally authorized 
representative) are also required to sign electronically and these signatures will be stored 
with the electronic ICF/IAF in accordance with the ICH GCP Guideline and local 
regulatory requirements/guidelines. These signatures cannot be altered, removed, or 
copied. At sites where the electronic ICF/IAF application is not used, paper consent and 
assent forms will be signed after trial site staff and the participant agree that the 
participant has enough information to make an informed decision to participate. Any 
other parties required to provide signatures will also sign the paper forms, and the forms 
will be stored in accordance with the ICH GCP Guideline and local regulatory 
requirements/guidelines.
Subjects or their parent/legal guardian or legally acceptable representative, as applicable 
for local laws, may be asked to sign additional ICFs/IAFs if the protocol is amended and 
the changes to the protocol result in additional information that needs to be provided to 
the subjects, so that they can make a knowledgeable and voluntary decision on trial 
participation. Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 331-201-00191
Confidential - Proprietary Information 32 Version 6.0, 07 Jul 2022If a subject is legally emancipated, informed consent must be sought directly from the 
subject. Subjects who turn age 18 (or the age of adulthood as specified by local laws or 
regulations) during the trial must sign a new ICF at that time.
In addition to the English version of the ICF/IAF, the documents may also be translated 
into local languages for use in this trial. Translation with back-translation for 
confirmation will be utilized to ensure accuracy.
3.4.2 Inclusion Criteria
Subjects are required to meet the inclusion criteria presented in Table 3.4.2-1.
Table 3.4.2-1 Inclusion Criteria
1. Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, could potentially benefit from administration of 
oral brexpiprazole for the treatment of irritability associated with ASD and who completed 
Trial 331-201-00148.
2. Male and female subjects 5 to 17 years of age, inclusive, at the time of informed consent/assent. 
Subjects who turned 18 years old during Trial 331-201-00148 are permitted in this trial.
3. Written informed consent/assent obtained from a legally acceptable representative (eg, guardian) or 
subject prior to the initiation of any protocol-required procedures. In addition, the subject must 
provide informed assent at screening and must be able to understand that he or she can withdraw 
from the trial at any time. All informed consent/assent procedures must be in accordance with the 
trial site’s IRB/IEC and local regulatory requirements.
4. Ability, in the opinion of the principal investigator, of the subject or the subject’s legally acceptable 
representative (eg, guardian) or caregiver(s) to understand the nature of the trial and follow 
protocol requirements, including the prescribed dosage regimens, tablet ingestion, and 
discontinuation of prohibited concomitant medications, to read and understand the written word in 
order to complete subject-reported outcomes measures, and to be reliably rated on assessment 
scales.
3.4.3 Exclusion Criteria
Subjects will be excluded if they meet any of the exclusion criteria in Table 3.4.3-1.
Table 3.4.3-1 Exclusion Criteria
1. Subjects with a substantial protocol violation during the course of their participation in the double-
blind phase 3 Trial 331-201-00148. Lesser violations such as occasional visits outside of the 
acceptable window or a missing blood draw will not exclude a subject from participation in 
Trial 331-201-00191; however, continual lack of compliance with the visit schedule, trial 
assessments, or treatment regimen in the prior double-blind trial would be considered a substantial 
violation that would result in exclusion from Trial 331-201-00191. The medical monitor should be 
contacted if the investigator is unsure of a subject’s eligibility.
2. Sexually active males or FOCBP who do not agree to practice 2 different methods of birth control 
or remain abstinent during the trial and for 30 days after the last dose of IMP. If employing birth 
control, 2 of the following precautions must be used: vaginal diaphragm, intrauterine device, birth 
control pill, birth control implant, birth control depot injection, condom with spermicide, or sponge 
with spermicide. Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

3.7.1.1 Screening and Baseline
Rollover subjects who do not qualify for the open-label trial at the screening/baseline 
visit may not be rescreened at a later date. If results of clinical laboratory tests from the 
last visit of the prior double-blind trial are not available to assess eligibility, the 
assessment for the affected criteria should be based on the last available measurement 
during the double-blind trial. Results from the last visit of the double-blind trial should be 
reviewed when they become available and action should be taken if there are any 
clinically significant and/or exclusionary values. 
Screening for rollover subjects occurs simultaneously with baseline at the 
end-of-treatment (Week 8) of Trial 331-201-00148 (Table 3.7-1). Subjects and their 
parent/legal guardian must sign the ICF/IAF for the open-label trial before any 
procedures specific to Trial 331-201-00191 can be performed. Subjects will retain the 
same subject ID number assigned in the parent trial. 
Screening/baseline values will be derived from the last visit of the double-blind phase 3 
trial for the following assessments (as appropriate): CGI-S, SAS, AIMS, BARS, C-SSRS, 
PARS, PedsQL, ABC, physical examination, body weight, height, waist circumference, 
vital signs, ECG, clinical laboratory tests (including prolactin), urine drug screen, and 
urine pregnancy test. The only additional procedures to be performed for rollover 
subjects at screening/baseline of the open-label trial are as follows:
•An assessment of all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be made to determine 
the subject’s eligibility for the trial.
•Medical history from the parent trial will be retained, but will be updated if 
necessary.
•Concomitant medications will be reviewed to assure that the subject is not 
receiving any prohibited medications.
•AE recording will begin with the signing of the ICF/IAF for Trial 331-201-00191.
•If the subject remains eligible for the trial after completion of the baseline 
evaluations, trial personnel will use eSource to obtain an IMP assignment. 
•The IMP will be dispensed to the subject and the subject will be advised to begin 
dosing from this card the next day.
All subjects will be assessed at various scheduled clinic visits as described below. Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

 Confidential - Proprietary Information 39 Version 6.0, 07 Jul 20223.7.1.2 Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 14, 18, and 22
Evaluations will be performed at Weeks (± 2 days) 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 14, 18, and 22 visits.
The baseline, Week 2, and Week 14 visits will occur in the clinic. All other visits may be 
conducted either virtually or in clinic. Where the investigator and caregiver make the 
decision to conduct a visit virtually, the visit will be conducted by means of 
telecommunications technology. For these virtual visits, the caregiver and subject will 
remain in their own home and complete trial assessments and questionnaires via an 
online technology. The caregiver and subject will interact with trial personnel using 
online communication tools which incorporate telemedicine. During virtual interactions 
(and at any other time), the trial personnel will be able to assess the subject and determine 
if an additional in-office visit for a physical evaluation is required at the discretion of the 
investigator. The telecommunication equipment is supplied to all caregivers and subject 
pairs. The equipment will be returned at the end of trial participation. 
Visits are to occur within ± 2 days of the target visit date. All required evaluations will be 
performed as described in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 3.7-1). The following 
should also be noted: 
•Subjects will have their IMP dispensed at a clinic visit or delivered to the home 
for a virtual visit. Pickup of IMP at the trial site by the caregiver can also be 
accommodated.
•IMP accountability will be performed
3.7.1.3 End of Treatment (Week 26 or Early Termination) 
The treatment period for the entire trial will conclude at the Week 26 visit. This in clinic 
visit is to occur within ± 2 days of the target visit date. If a subject discontinues early 
before Week 26, procedures noted for Week 26 must be completed at the early 
termination (ET) visit. All required evaluations will be performed as described in the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table 3.7-1). The following should also be noted: 
•Trial personnel will register completion or discontinuation from the trial in 
eSource.
•IMP accountability will be performed.Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

All subjects will be followed up either by telephone or other acceptable means of contact 
21 (± 2) days after the last dose of IMP to assess any new or ongoing AEs and to record any concomitant medications. Depending upon the type of follow-up required, other evaluations or tests may be conducted or performed.
3.7.2 Efficacy Assessments
It is required that a qualified and experienced clinician administer the efficacy 
assessments. Raters will be trained on the administration of these scales. The number of raters within each trial site should be kept to a minimum. All efforts will be made to ensure that the same clinician administers the scales for a given subject. Notations in the subject’s trial records should substantiate the ratings. Training, certification (if applicable), and materials for rating will be provided.  
3.7.2.1 Aberrant Behavior Checklist 
The ABC-I is 1 of 5 subscales of the ABC, a standardized parent-reported rating scale 
originally designed to assess treatment effects on problem behavior in people with intellectual disabilities. The ABC measures emotional and behavioral symptoms of ASD, including aggression toward others, deliberate self-injuriousness, temper tantrums, and quickly changing moods. Since its use in the seminal studies with risperidone, the ABC has been accepted as a standard in medication trials for ASD. The irritability subscale is 
the main subscale of interest in this trial.
14,15
3.7.2.2 Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness Scale 
The severity of illness for subjects with ASD will be rated using the CGI-S with a focus 
on symptoms of irritability.16 To perform this assessment, the rater or investigator will 
answer the following question: “Considering your total clinical experience with this 
particular population, how ill is the patient at this time with regard to symptoms of 
irritability?” Response choices include: 0 = not assessed; 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; and 7 = among the most extremely ill patients.  &OLQLFDO6WXG\5HSRUW 3URWRFRODQG3URWRFRO $PHQGPHQWV

Clinical Laboratory Assessments
Table 3.7.3.2-1 presents the protocol -required clinical laboratory test for all subjects in 
this trial. A central laboratory designated by the sponsor will be used for all laboratory 
testing required during the trial. The central laboratory should be used for all laboratory 
testing whenever possible (including unscheduled and follow-up laboratory tests, if 
needed). In cases where an immediate result is required for a particular laboratory test, 
the sample should be divided and sent to both a local laboratory and the designated 
central laboratory. Urine will be collected, and blood will be drawn from each subject at 
screening and then at the scheduled visits designated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 3.7-1). The results of these t ests must be reviewed by t he investigator prior to 
initiation of IMP. 
Urine drug screens and blood alcohol tests will be conducted at the discretion of the 
investigator.
Subjects should be fasting for a minimum of 8 hours prior to blood draws, if at all 
possible. If fasting blood samples are not feasible, nonfasting blood samples may be 
obtained. If a subject is not fasting at a visit, the blood draw should still be performed, 
and the status documented as nonfasting on the laboratory requisition sheet. Reports from 
the central laboratory will be retained electronically within the lab vendor's online portal 
and assessed by the investigator or qualified designee for clinical significance within

(FOCBP) prior to trial intervention; results must be available prior to the administration 
of the IMP. A confirmatory serum pregnancy test will be done for subjects with a positive 
urine test. Subjects with a positive pregnancy test result at screening will be excluded 
from the trial. The frequency of pregnancy tests may be modified based on local 
regulatory requirements and pregnancy tests can be performed at any point during trial if 
pregnancy is suspected.
Any value outside the normal range will be flagged for the attention of the investigator, 
who must indicate whether or not a flagged value is of clinical significance. If 1 or more 
values are questionable, the test(s) may be repeated. If the result of any test (or repeat 
test, if done) is indicated as clinically significant in the samples taken during the 
screening period, the subject will NOT be enrolled into the trial without the permission of 
the medical monitor. In addition, follow-up unscheduled laboratory tests should be 
performed on clinically significant abnormalities. Unscheduled laboratory tests may be 
repeated at any time at the discretion of the investigator for appropriate medical care.
In addition, subjects should be excluded if they have any other abnormal laboratory test 
result at screening that, in the investigator’s judgment, is medically significant in that it 
would impact the safety of the subject or the interpretation of the trial results. However, 
any abnormal screening laboratory result(s) considered to be clinically significant should 
be repeated as soon as possible to confirm the finding(s) before excluding the subject 
from the trial. Appendix 2 is incl uded to assist investigators in their assessments of 
results that may be potentially medically significant, depending on the subject’s medical 
history and clinical presentation.
3.7.3.3 Physical Examination and Vital Signs
3.7.3.3.1 Physical Examination
The physical examination will consist of measurement of height and a review of the 
following body systems: head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat; thorax; abdomen; urogenital; 
extremities; neurological; and skin and mucosae. A complete physical examination is an 
integral part of trial safety assessments and includes a urogenital assessment. A 
urogenital assessment should be performed on all trial subjects according to local medical 
standards as applied to other body systems. For the purposes of this trial, at a minimum, 
the urogenital examination should be performed within the year prior to the date of the 
ICF being signed or during the screening period for Trial 331-201-00148. The urogenital 
examination may be performed by the subject’s primary care provider or pediatrician as 
long as the source records are obtained, and the findings documented. At baseline and Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

body system must be asked of the subject at all protocol-required physical exams, with 
answers documented accordingly in the source. The extent and scope of any part of the 
physical examination is to be left to the discretion of the investigator as deemed 
appropriate for each subject. 
Height will be measured with a stadiometer, measuring stick or tape at specified visits. 
The principal investigator or his/her appointed designee is primarily responsible to 
perform the physical examination. If the appointed designee is to perform the physical 
examination, he/she must be permitted by local regulations and his/her name must be 
included on the Delegation of Authority Log. Whenever possible, the same individual 
should perform all physical examinations. Any condition present at the post-treatment 
physical examination that was not present at the baseline examination should be 
documented as an AE and followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
The following procedures will aid in the standardization of waist circumference 
measurements:
•The subject should be minimally clothed (ie, lightweight clothing; no heavy 
overgarments).
•Waist circumference should be recorded before a subject’s meal and at approximately 
the same time at each visit.
•Measurement will be accomplished by locating the upper hip bone and the top of the 
right iliac crest and placing a weighted measuring tape in a horizontal plane around 
the abdomen at the level of the crest. Before reading the tape measure, the assessor 
should assure that the tape is snug, but does not compress the skin, and is parallel to 
the floor. The measurement is to be made at the end of a normal exhalation.18 
3.7.3.3.2 Vital Signs
Vital sign measurements will include body weight (measured at baseline, Week 14, and 
Week 26), body temperature, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure 
(DBP), and heart rate. The following guidelines will aid in the standardization of body 
weight measurements:
•The same scale should be used to weigh a given subject each time, if possible.
•Scales should be calibrated and reliable; scales should be at zero just prior to each 
subject’s weigh-in session.Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

or heavy overgarments).
•Weight should be recorded before a subject’s meal and at approximately the same 
time at each visit.
Blood pressure and heart rate measurements will be made in the supine and standing 
positions after the subject has been in each position for at least 3 minutes. The supine 
measurements will be performed first, followed by standing. At the in-clinic visits, 
equipment at the site will be used for the measurements. For the virtual visits, equipment 
will be provided to the caregiver with instructions for home use. The results of these tests 
must be reviewed by the investigator in order to determine if any results are considered to 
be clinically significant.
Subjects should be excluded if they have any vital sign measurement at screening that, in 
the investigator’s judgment, is medically significant in that it would impact the safety of 
the subject or the interpretation of the trial results. However, any abnormal screening 
vital sign result(s) considered to be clinically significant may be repeated once to confirm 
the finding(s) before excluding the subject from the trial. Appendix 1 is incl uded to assist 
investigators in their assessments of results that may be potentially medically significant, 
depending on the subject’s medical history and clinical presentation.
3.7.3.4 Electrocardiogram Assessments
All ECG recordings will be obtained after the subject has been supine and at rest for at 
least 5 minutes. Additional ECGs may be obtained at the investigator’s discretion and 
should always be obtained in the event of an ET. A central ECG service will be utilized 
for reading all ECGs in order to standardize interpretations for the safety analysis. In 
addition, ECG results will be evaluated at the investigational site to monitor safety during 
the trial. The principal investigator or qualified designee will review, sign, and date each 
ECG reading, noting whether or not any abnormal results are of clinical significance. The 
ECG will be repeated if any results are considered to be clinically significant.
If, according to the investigator's judgment, any abnormal ECG finding is deemed 
medically significant (impacting the safety of the subject and/or the interpretation of the 
trial results) or meets an exclusion criterion, the subject should be excluded from the trial. 
Abnormal results for ECGs should be repeated once at screening with 3 consecutive ECG 
recordings to ensure reproducibility of the abnormality before excluding a subject based 
on the criteria noted above. Each ECG recording should be taken approximately Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

3.7.3.5 Other Safety Assessments
It is required that a trained and experienced clinician administer the safety assessments, 
including the EPS scales (SAS, AIMS, and BARS), and C-SSRS. The number of raters 
within each trial site should be kept to a minimum. All efforts will be made to ensure that 
the same clinician administers the scales for a given subject. Training and materials for 
rating will be provided by Otsuka or designee.
3.7.3.5.1 Simpson Angus Scale 
The SAS19 consists of a list of 10 symptoms of Parkinsonism (gait, arm dropping, 
shoulder shaking, elbow rigidity, wrist rigidity, head rotation, glabella tap, tremor, 
salivation, and akathisia). Each item will be rated on a 5-point scale, with a score of zero 
representing absence of symptoms, and a score of 4 representing a severe condition. The 
SAS Total Score is the sum of the scores for all 10 items. Anticholinergics, propranolol, 
benzodiazepines, and non-benzodiazepine sleep aids are not permitted within 8 hours of 
scale administration (see Section 4). Investigators are encouraged to delay scale 
administration until 8 hours have elapsed, if at all possible. However, if delaying 
administration of the scale is not feasible, the SAS should still be administered and the 
use of the medication documented, including a notation of the drug name, dose, and time 
of administration on the eSource.
3.7.3.5.2 Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale 
The AIMS16 assessment consists of 10 items describing symptoms of dyskinesia. Facial 
and oral movements (items 1 through 4), extremity movements (items 5 and 6), and trunk 
movements (item 7) will be observed unobtrusively while the subject is at rest (eg, in the 
waiting room), and the investigator will also make global judgments on the subject’s 
dyskinesias (items 8 through 10). Each item will be rated on a 5-point scale, with a score 
of zero representing absence of symptoms (for item 10, no awareness), and a score of 4 
indicating a severe condition (for item 10, awareness, severe distress). For this scale, the Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

trunk movements).
3.7.3.5.3 Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale 
The BARS20 consists of 4 items related to akathisia: objective observation of akathisia by 
the investigator, subjective feelings of restlessness by the subject, subjective distress due 
to akathisia, and global clinical assessment of akathisia. The first 3 items will be rated on 
a 4-point scale, with a score of zero representing absence of symptoms and a score of 3 
representing a severe condition. The global clinical evaluation will be made on a 6-point 
scale, with zero representing absence of symptoms and a score of 5 representing severe 
akathisia. To complete this scale, subjects will be observed while they are seated and then 
standing for a minimum of 2 minutes in each position. Symptoms observed in other 
situations (eg, while engaged in neutral conversation or engaged in activity on the ward) 
may also be rated. Subjective phenomena are to be elicited by direct questioning. 
Anticholinergics, propranolol, benzodiazepines, and non-benzodiazepine sleep aids are 
not permitted within 8 hours of scale administration (see Section 4). Investigat ors are 
encouraged to delay scale administration until 8 hours have elapsed, if at all possible. 
However, if delaying administration of the scale is not feasible, the BARS should still be 
administered and the use of the medication documented, including a notation of the drug 
name, dose, and time of administration on the eSource. The BARS Global Score is

for non-enrollment of subjects or noncompliance with GCP or with the protocol. The 
investigator will notify the sponsor promptly if the trial is terminated by the investigator 
or the IRB/IEC at the site.
3.8.3 Individual Subject Discontinuation
3.8.3.1 Treatment Interruption
All attempts should be made to avoid treatment interruption during the trial. For subjects 
who have an interruption of treatment, the investigator or designee will contact the 
medical monitor as soon as possible. The investigator and medical monitor will come as 
quickly as possible to a joint decision regarding the subject’s continuation in the trial. 
This decision will be documented by the investigator and the medical monitor. The 
treatment interruption will be recorded in the eSource and also recorded as a protocol 
deviation (Section 3.13).
3.8.3.2 Treatment Discontinuation
After starting open-label IMP, a subject may stop treatment permanently for a variety of 
reasons. Treatment discontinuations may be initiated by a subject who is not satisfied 
with treatment or may become medically necessary due to AEs, required treatment with a 
disallowed medication or therapy, or other issues, as determined by the investigator. 
However, each investigator must comprehensively review the circumstances and offer the 
subject options for continued treatment to the degree possible as described in 
Section 3.8.3.3.
If a subject discontinues from the trial prematurely, the reason must be fully evaluated 
and recorded appropriately in source documents and in eSource. If the subject is being 
withdrawn because of an AE, that AE should be indicated as the reason for withdrawal. 
All subjects have the right to withdraw at any point during treatment without prejudice. 
The investigator can discontinue a subject’s participation in the trial at any time if 
medically necessary.  
3.8.3.3 Documenting Reasons for Treatment Discontinuation
A subject may discontinue IMP for a number of reasons including those listed below:
•Reasons related to AE:
•Subject decides to discontinue because of annoyance or discomfort due to a 
non-serious AE which is not otherwise determined to be an undue hazardClinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

51
Protocol 331-201-00191
 Confidential - Proprietary Information 51 Version 6.0, 07 Jul 2022•Continuing IMP places the subject at undue risk as determined by the investigator 
(eg, a safety concern that is possibly, probably, or likely related to IMP)
•Serious adverse event (SAE) 
•Clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, and the risk 
of increased suicidality
•Death
•Reasons unrelated to medical condition (provide detail and review AE history with 
subject)
•Withdrawal of informed consent/assent (complete written withdrawal of ICF/IAF)
•Lost to follow-up
•Pregnancy (see Section 5.5)
•Termination of all or part of the trial by the sponsor
If the subject discontinues IMP due to an AE, the investigator, or other trial personnel, 
will make every effort to follow the event until it has resolved or stabilized. Follow-up 
procedures in Section 5.7 should be followed.
3.8.3.4 Withdrawal of Consent
All subjects have the right to withdraw their consent/assent from further participation in 
the trial at any time without prejudice. Subjects cannot withdraw consent/assent for use of 
data already collected as part of the trial, but only for future participation. The 
investigator can also discontinue a subject’s participation in the trial at any time if 
medically necessary. Unless the subject (or their legal guardian) provides their written 
withdrawal of consent/assent or there is other written documentation by the investigator 
confirming the subject’s verbal intent to completely withdraw from the trial, subjects 
should be followed for all protocol-specified evaluations and assessments, if possible.
Complete withdrawal of consent/assent requires a subject’s refusal of ALL of the 
following methods of follow up (these methods of follow up will also be noted in the trial 
ICF):
•Participation in all follow-up procedures specified in the protocol (whether in-clinic, 
by telephone, or by an in-home visit).
•Participation in a subset of protocol specified follow-up procedures (by a frequency 
schedule and method, as agreed by subject and staff).
•Contact of the subject by trial personnel, even if only by telephone, to assess current 
medical condition, and obtain necessary medical or laboratory reports relevant to the 
trial’s objectives.Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 331-201-00191
 Confidential - Proprietary Information 52 Version 6.0, 07 Jul 2022•Contact of alternative person(s) who have been designated in source records as being 
available to discuss the subject’s medical condition, even if only by telephone, mail, 
or e-mail (eg, family, spouse, partner, legal representative, friend, neighbor, or 
physician).
•Access to medical information from alternative sources (eg, hospital/clinic medical 
records, referring doctor’s notes, public records, dialysis, transplantation or vital 
registries, social media sources). 
Withdrawal of consent/assent is a critical trial event and therefore should be approached 
with the same degree of importance and care as is used in initially obtaining informed 
consent/assent. The reasons for a subject’s intended withdrawal need to be completely 
understood, documented, and managed to protect the rights of the subject and the 
integrity of the trial. A subject (or their legal guardian) may initially express their desire 
to discontinue IMP administration, which is not equivalent to a complete withdrawal of 
consent/assent for further participation (see Section 3.8.3.2). A subject ma y, however, 
indicate that further trial participation is creating a burden on their work or social 
schedule. Therefore, the investigator should follow the procedures outlined in 
Section 3.8.3.3 to dete rmine if the subject can continue participation in the trial if 
modifications to his/her treatment and/or schedule of assessments can be accommodated. 
Only subjects (or their legal guardians) who withdraw their permission for all of the 
above degrees of follow-up are considered to have completely withdrawn their 
consent/assent to participate in the trial.
3.8.3.5 Procedures to Encourage Continued Trial Participation
In all cases of impending IMP discontinuation or consent/assent withdrawal, investigators 
will be given instructions to meet and discuss with the subject their options of continuing 
in the trial, preferably on therapy. The investigator should ensure understanding and 
documentation of the reasons for the subject’s desire to withdraw consent/assent.  
3.9 Screen Failures
A screen failure subject is one from whom informed consent/assent is obtained and is 
documented in writing (ie, subject signs an ICF), but who is not started on open-label 
treatment. Rollover subjects who do not qualify for Trial 331-201-00191 at the last visit 
of Trial 331-201-00148 may not be rescreened.Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 331-201-00191
 Confidential - Proprietary Information 53 Version 6.0, 07 Jul 20223.10 Definition of Completed Subjects
The treatment period is defined as the time period during which subjects are evaluated for 
primary and/or secondary objectives of the trial irrespective of whether or not the subject 
actually consumed all doses of the IMP. Subjects who are evaluated at the last scheduled 
visit during the treatment period will be defined as trial completers. For purposes of this 
trial, subjects who complete the Week 26 visit will be defined as trial completers.
3.11 Definition of Subjects Lost to Follow-up
Subjects who cannot be contacted on or before the Week 26 visit during the treatment 
period, who do not have a known reason for discontinuation (eg, withdrew consent/assent 
or AE), and for whom a survival status at the end of the trial cannot be determined will be 
classified as “lost to follow-up” as the reason for discontinuation. Survival status can be 
determined from a variety of sources, either by obtaining acceptable documentation for 
death (ie, death certificate, medical records, public records, statement by a family 
member or primary care physician) or acceptable documentation for life (ie, direct 
contact with the subject, medical records, successful telephone contact with the subject, 
statement by a family member or primary care physician, or public records).
The site will make 3 documented attempts to contact the subject by telephone and in the 
event the site is unable to reach the subject by telephone, the site will attempt to contact 
the subject via certified mail or an alternative similar method, where appropriate, before 
assigning a “lost to follow-up” status.
3.12 Subject Compliance 
Responsible trial personnel will dispense the IMP (open-label brexpiprazole) to subjects. 
Accountability and compliance verification should be documented in the subject’s trial 
records. Subjects must be counseled on the importance of taking the IMP as directed at 
all trial visits. If poor compliance continues (eg, multiple missed doses resulting in less 
than 80% overall compliance), discontinuation of the subject from the trial should be 
considered.
3.13 Protocol Deviations
This trial is intended to be conducted as described in this protocol. In the event of a 
significant deviation from the protocol due to an emergency, accident, or mistake (eg, 
violation of informed consent/assent process, IMP dispensing or subject dosing error, 
treatment assignment error, subject enrolled in violation of eligibility criteria or 
concomitant medication criteria), the investigator or designee will contact the sponsor at Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

administration of a benzodiazepine, regardless of indication. For the non-benzodiazepine sleep aids, 
sites should only utilize one of the listed medications that are approved for this indication in their 
respective countries and the country-specific prescribing information is to be used to determine the 
maximum allowable daily dose for the treatment of insomnia (exceptions: clonidine, which is 
commonly prescribed off label as a sleep aid, and melatonin, which is available over the counter 
[OTC]). Non-benzodiazepine sleep aids must not be administered within 8 hours prior to scheduled Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

propranolol. Trial sites should only utilize medications that are approved for these 
indications in their respective countries.
The subject’s best medical interests should guide the investigator in the management of 
conditions that are pre-existing or that develop during the trial (intercurrent illness or 
AEs). The investigator should examine the acceptability of all concomitant medications 
not explicitly prohibited. In order to ensure that appropriate concomitant therapy is Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

self-administered non-prescription drugs or prescription therapy prescribed by another 
physician) without prior consultation with the investigator. All trial personnel should be 
familiar with the content of the IB for brexpiprazole in order to manage the subject’s 
condition adequately and select appropriate concomitant medications, if needed.
4.2.1 Non-therapy Precautions and Restrictions
4.2.1.1 Precautions
Subjects should not undergo any elective medical procedure without prior consultation 
with the investigator. An elective procedure (minor surgery, dental surgery, orthopedic 
surgery, etc) that might require hospitalization or general anesthesia should be deferred 
until after the trial whenever clinically appropriate.
4.2.1.2 Restrictions
With the exception of group therapy and outpatient group therapy, new-onset 
psychotherapy is prohibited during the trial. In other words, except for inpatient and 
outpatient group therapies, subjects may continue to receive psychotherapy (eg, 
individual, group, or family therapy) if this has been ongoing throughout the double-blind 
trial period directly preceding trial entry, and if psychotherapy participation and 
frequency are maintained during the course of the trial, unless permission is obtained 
from the medical monitor.
Consumption of grapefruit, grapefruit products, Seville oranges, or Seville orange 
products within 72 hours prior to dosing and during the trial is prohibited. Subjects will 
be instructed to refrain from drinking alcoholic beverages or using illicit drugs during 
participation in the trial. The investigator may request a blood or urine drug screen at any 
time during the trial if there is a suspicion of illicit drug use.
5 Reporting of Adverse Events
5.1 Definitions
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial subject 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. Adverse events would not include information recorded 
as medical history at screening for pre-planned procedures for which the underlying 
condition was known and no worsening occurred. An adverse reaction is any untoward 
and unintended response to an IMP related to any dose administered.Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments
Until the information herein is released by Otsuka to the public domain, the contents of this document are Otsuka
confidential information and should not be duplicated or re-distributed without prior written consent of Otsuka.
58
Protocol 331-201-00191
 Confidential - Proprietary Information 58 Version 6.0, 07 Jul 2022A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
IMP caused the AE. For the purpose of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” 
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IMP and the AE. 
Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality.
An SAE includes any event that results in any of the following outcomes:
•Death
•Life-threatening; ie, the subject was, in the opinion of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred. It does not include an event 
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.
•Persistent or significant incapacity/disability or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions.
•Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongs hospitalization.
Hospitalization itself should not be reported as an SAE; whenever possible the 
reason for the hospitalization should be reported.
Hospitalizations or prolonged hospitalizations for social admissions (ie, those 
required for reasons of convenience or other non-medical need) are not 
considered SAEs.
•Congenital anomaly/birth defect.
•Other medically significant events that, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above; eg, allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
Nonserious adverse events are all AEs that do not meet the criteria for a "serious" AE.
Immediately Reportable Event (IRE):  
•Any SAE.
•Any AE related to occupational exposure.
•Potential serious hepatotoxicity case (see Section 5.4). 
•Pregnancies are also defined as IREs. Although normal pregnancy is not an AE, it 
will mandate IMP discontinuation and must be reported on an IRE form to the 
sponsor. Pregnancy will only be documented on the AE page of the eSource if 
there is an abnormality or complication.
Clinical Laboratory Test Value Changes: It is the investigator’s responsibility to review 
the results of all laboratory tests as they become available. This review will be Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 331-201-00191
 Confidential - Proprietary Information 59 Version 6.0, 07 Jul 2022documented by the investigator’s dated signature on the laboratory report. For each 
abnormal laboratory test result, the investigator needs to ascertain if this is an abnormal 
(ie, clinically significant) change from baseline for that individual subject. This 
determination, however, does not necessarily need to be made the first time an abnormal 
value is observed. The investigator may repeat the laboratory test or request additional 
tests to verify the results of the original laboratory tests. If this laboratory value is 
considered medically relevant by the investigator (subject is symptomatic, requiring 
corrective treatment or further evaluation), or if the laboratory value leads to 
discontinuation, and/or fulfills a seriousness criterion, this is considered an AE. 
Severity: Adverse events will be graded on a 3-point scale and reported as indicated in 
the eSource. The intensity of an adverse experience is defined as follows:
1 = Mild: Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity.
2 = Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity.
3 = Severe: Inability to work or perform normal daily activity.
IMP Causality: Assessment of causal relationship of an AE to the use of the IMP is 
defined as follows:
Related: There is a reasonable possibility of a temporal and causal 
relationship between the IMP and the AE.
Not Related: There is no temporal or causal relationship between the IMP and 
the AE.
5.2 Eliciting and Reporting Adverse Events
The investigator will periodically assess subjects for the occurrence of AEs. To avoid 
bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked the non-leading question: “How have you 
felt since your last visit?” All AEs (serious and nonserious) reported by the subject must 
be recorded on the source documents and eSource provided by the sponsor. Serious AE 
collection is to begin after a subject has signed the ICF.  
Use medical terminology in AE reporting. Adverse events should be reported as a single 
unifying diagnosis whenever possible or, in the absence of a unifying diagnosis, as 
individual signs or symptoms. Exacerbation or disease progression should be reported as 
an AE only if there are unusual or severe clinical features that were not present, or 
experienced earlier, or not expected based on the course of the condition. A reported AE Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

 Confidential - Proprietary Information 60 Version 6.0, 07 Jul 2022that undergoes a change in severity, seriousness, or toxicity should be reported as a new 
AE on the eSource.
Note: Normal pregnancy is not an AE and should not be recorded on the eSource; 
guidelines outlined in Section 5.5 should be followed for pre gnancy reporting.
In addition, the sponsor must be notified immediately by telephone, fax, or e-mail of any 
IREs according to the procedure outlined below, in Section 5.3. Special  attention should 
be paid to recording hospitalization and concomitant medications.
5.3 Immediately Reportable Events 
The investigator must immediately report after either the investigator or site personnel 
become aware of any SAE, potential serious hepatotoxicity, or confirmed pregnancy, by 
telephone, fax, or e-mail to the sponsor using the contact information on the cover page 
of this protocol. An IRE form must be completed and sent by e-mail, fax, or overnight 
courier to the sponsor. (Please note that the IRE form is NOT the AE page of the 
eSource.) 
Subjects experiencing SAEs should be followed clinically until their health has returned 
to baseline status, or until all parameters have returned to normal or have otherwise been 
explained. It is expected that the investigator will provide or arrange appropriate 
supportive care for the subject and will provide prompt updates on the subject’s status to 
the sponsor.
5.4 Potential Serious Hepatotoxicity
For a subject who experiences an elevation in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) that is  2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), a total 
bilirubin level should also be evaluated. If the total bilirubin is  1.6 times the ULN, 
complete an IRE form with all values listed and also report as an AE in the eSource.
5.5 Pregnancy
Females of child-bearing potential (FOCBP) are defined as female subjects for whom 
menstruation has started and who are not documented as sterile (ie, have had a bilateral 
oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy or who have been postmenopausal for at least 
12 months).
For FOCBP and for men who are sexually active, there must be a documented agreement 
that the subject and/or their partner will take effective measures (ie, double-barrier 
method) to prevent pregnancy during the course of the trial and for 30 days after the last Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

vaginal diaphragm, intrauterine device, birth control pill, birth control implant, birth 
control depot injection, condom with spermicide, or sponge with spermicide. The 
contraceptive methods will be documented at each trial visit.
Before enrolling FOCBP in this clinical trial, investigators must review the below 
guidelines about trial participation with all FOCBP. The topics should generally include:
•General information
•Informed consent/assent form
•Pregnancy prevention information
•Drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives
•Contraceptives in current use
•Guidelines for the follow-up of a reported pregnancy
Before trial enrollment, FOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding 
pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional 
pregnancy. The subject and the subject’s legally acceptable representative (eg, guardian) 
must sign an ICF/IAF stating that the above-mentioned risk factors and the consequences 
were discussed with them. 
A urine pregnancy test for human chorionic gonadotropin will be performed at screening 
on all FOCBP and female subjects ≥ 12 years of age and all female subjects < 12 years of 
age, if menstruation has started. If a urine test is performed and is positive, the 
investigator will follow up with a confirmatory serum test.
During the trial, all FOCBP should be instructed to contact the investigator immediately 
if they suspect they might be pregnant (eg, missed or late menstrual cycle).
If a subject is suspected to be pregnant before she receives IMP, the IMP administration 
must be withheld until the results of serum pregnancy tests are available. If the pregnancy 
is confirmed, the subject must not receive the IMP and must not be enrolled in the trial. If 
pregnancy is suspected while the subject is taking IMP, the IMP must be withheld 
immediately (if reasonable, taking into consideration any potential withdrawal risks) until 
the result of the pregnancy test is known. If pregnancy is confirmed, the IMP will be 
permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary for 
subject safety) and the subject will be withdrawn from the trial. Exceptions to trial 
discontinuation may be considered for life-threatening conditions only after consultations Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

protocol for contact information).
The investigator must immediately notify the sponsor of any pregnancy associated with 
IMP exposure during the trial and for 30 days after the last dose of IMP, and record the 
event on the IRE form and forward it to the sponsor. The sponsor will forward Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form(s) for monitoring the outcome of the pregnancy. 
Protocol-required procedures for trial discontinuation and follow-up must be performed 
on the subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy (eg, x-ray studies). Other appropriate 
pregnancy follow-up procedures should be considered, if indicated. In addition, the 
investigator must report to the sponsor, on appropriate Pregnancy Surveillance Form(s), 
follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and 
neonatal outcome. Infants will be followed for a minimum of 6 months from the date of 
birth.  
5.6 Procedure for Breaking the Blind 
Not applicable; this is an open-label trial.
5.7 Follow-up of Adverse Events 
For this trial, information on AEs will be followed for up to 21 (± 2) days after the last 
dose of IMP has been administered.
5.7.1 Follow-up of Nonserious Adverse Events
Nonserious AEs that are identified at any time during the trial must be recorded on the 
AE page in the eSource with the current status noted. If a subject has an AE or has not 
recovered from an AE at the last scheduled contact, follow-up contacts will be scheduled 
at least every 4 weeks until resolution of the AE is confirmed, or the condition is 
considered clinically stable. All nonserious events that are ongoing at the last scheduled 
contact will be recorded as ongoing in the eSource. For any AE having been identified 
throughout the trial, during analysis, additional relevant medical history information may 
be requested to further ascertain causality (including, but not limited to, information such 
as risk-related behavior, family history and occupation).
5.7.2 Follow-up of Serious Adverse Events
This trial requires that subjects be actively monitored for SAEs up to 21 (± 2) days after 
the last dose of IMP is administered.Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 331-201-00191
 Confidential - Proprietary Information 63 Version 6.0, 07 Jul 2022Serious AEs that are identified or ongoing at the last scheduled contact must be 
recorded on the AE page in the eSource and reported to the sponsor according to the 
reporting procedures outlined in Section 5.3. This may i nclude unresolved previously 
reported SAEs, or new SAEs. The investigator will follow SAEs until the events are 
resolved, stabilized, or the subject is lost to follow-up. Resolution means that the subject 
has returned to the baseline state of health and stabilized means that the investigator does 
not expect any further improvement or worsening of the subject’s condition. The 
investigator will continue to report any significant follow-up information to the sponsor 
up to the point the event has been resolved.
5.7.3 Follow-up and Reporting of Serious Adverse Events Occurring 
after Last Scheduled Contact
Any new SAEs reported by the subject to the investigator that occur after the last 
scheduled contact, and are determined by the investigator to be reasonably associated 
with the use of the IMP, should be reported to the sponsor. This may include SAEs that 
are captured on follow-up telephone contact or at any other time point after the defined 
trial period (ie, up to last scheduled contact). The investigator should follow SAEs 
identified after the last scheduled contact until the events are resolved, stabilized, or the 
subject is lost to follow-up. The investigator should continue to report any significant 
follow-up information to the sponsor up to the point the event has been resolved or 
stabilized.

9 Records Management
9.1 Source Documents
Source documents are defined as the results of original observations and activities of a 
clinical investigation. Source documents will include but are not limited to progress 
notes, electronic data, screening logs, and recorded data from automated instruments. All 
source documents pertaining to this trial will be maintained by the investigators and made 
available for direct inspection by authorized persons.
Investigator(s)/institution(s) will permit trial-related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, 
and regulatory inspection(s) by providing direct access to source data/documents by 
authorized persons as defined in the ICF. In all cases, subject confidentiality must be 
maintained in accordance with local regulatory requirements.
9.2 Data Collection
Source document and source data will be captured electronically in this trial, and will 
meet the same fundamental elements of data quality (eg, attributable, legible, 
contemporaneous, original, and accurate) as paper records. These data will be collected 
into a system that is fully validated. Changes to the data will be captured by an automatic 
audit trail.
The trial site will be given a tablet to directly record subject data and clinical 
observations on electronic forms. Designated trial site staff will not be given access to the 
system until they have been appropriately trained. Information to be originally captured 
and reviewed electronically shall include details of the subject visit and the 
protocol-required assessments performed as a part of these visits, medical history, AEs, 
and concomitant medications. Because this trial is using an electronic source record as 
the original point of data capture, there is no additional data entry step for the site for data 
collected directly into the application - rather, the electronic source record directly 
populates the trial database.Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments
Until the information herein is released by Otsuka to the public domain, the contents of this document are Otsuka

70
Protocol 331-201-00191
 Confidential - Proprietary Information 70 Version 6.0, 07 Jul 2022Some data may be captured via paper and then entered into the eSource system. These 
and any other data treated in this manner will be source data verified by the trial clinical 
research associate, and the location of the source data (ie, eSource, paper, or a local 
electronic system) will be documented before the trial start. Any changes to information 
in paper source documents will be initialed and dated on the day the change is made by a 
trial site staff member authorized to make the change. Changes will be made by striking a 
single line through erroneous data (so as not to obliterate the original data), and clearly 
entering the correct data (eg, wrong data right data). If the reason for the change is not 
apparent, a brief explanation for the change will be written in the source documentation 
by the clinician.
Another exception will be safety laboratory data, where the official source documentation 
will be considered the report issued by the analyzing laboratory.
Remote monitoring of the original electronic source record will take place, however on 
on-site monitoring inspections will continue to take place in order to review data entry 
source documentation directly captured on paper and transcribed into the system, to 
ensure protocol adherence, to assess site operational capabilities and to perform other 
monitoring activities that cannot be performed remotely.  
At the end of the trial, the investigator must certify that the data entered into the eSource 
application are complete and accurate. After database lock, the investigator will receive 
an electronic copy of the subject data. 
9.3 File Management at the Trial Site
The investigator will ensure that the trial site file is maintained in accordance with 
Section 8 of the ICH GCP Guideline E6 and as required by applicable local regulations. 
The investigator/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature 
destruction of these documents.
9.4 Records Retention at the Trial Site
Regulatory requirements for the archival of records for this trial necessitate that 
participating investigators maintain detailed clinical data for the longest of the following 
3 periods:
•A period of at least 2 years after the date on which approval to market the drug is 
obtained (or if IMP development is discontinued, the date regulatory authorities were 
notified of discontinuation); OR
•A period of at least 3 years after the sponsor notifies the investigator that the final 
report has been filed with regulatory authorities.Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

The investigator must not dispose of any records relevant to this trial without either 
(1) written permission from the sponsor or (2) provision of an opportunity for sponsor to 
collect such records. The investigator will be responsible to maintain adequate and 
accurate electronic or hard copy source documents of all observations and data generated 
during this trial including any data clarification forms received from the sponsor. Such 
documentation is subject to inspection by the sponsor and relevant regulatory authorities. 
If the investigator withdraws from the trial (eg, due to relocation or retirement), all trial-
related records should be transferred to a mutually agreed-upon designee within a 
sponsor-specified timeframe. Notice of such transfer will be given to the sponsor in 
writing.
10 Quality Control and Quality Assurance 
10.1 Monitoring
The sponsor has ethical, legal, and scientific obligations to follow this trial in accordance 
with established research principles, the ICH E6 GCP: Consolidated Guidance, and 
applicable regulatory requirements and local laws. As part of a concerted effort to fulfill 
these obligations (maintain current personal knowledge of the progress of the trial), the 
sponsor's monitors will visit the site during the trial, as well as communicate frequently 
via telephone, e-mail, and written communications. In addition, all investigators and 
clinical site personnel will undergo initial and ongoing training for this particular trial, 
and this training will be clearly documented.
10.2 Auditing
The sponsor's Quality Assurance Unit (or representative) may conduct trial site audits. 
Audits will include, but are not limited to, IMP supply, presence of required documents, 
the informed consent/assent process, and comparison of eSource with source documents. 
The investigator agrees to participate with audits.
Regulatory authorities may inspect the investigator site during or after the trial. The 
investigator will cooperate with such inspections and will contact the sponsor 
immediately if such an inspection occurs.Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 331-201-00191
 Confidential - Proprietary Information 72 Version 6.0, 07 Jul 202211 Ethics and Responsibility
This trial must be conducted in compliance with the protocol, FDA regulations, ICH GCP 
Guideline (E6), international ethical principles derived from the Declaration of Helsinki 
and Council for International Organizations of Medical Science (CIOMS) guidelines, and 
applicable local laws and regulations. Each trial site will seek approval/favorable opinion 
by an IRB or IEC according to regional requirements, and the investigator will provide 
that documentation to the sponsor. The IRB/IEC will evaluate the ethical, scientific and 
medical appropriateness of the trial. Further, in preparing and handling eSource, the 
investigator, sub-investigator and their staff will take measures to ensure adequate care in 
protecting subject privacy. To this end, a subject number and subject ID code will be 
used to identify each subject.
Financial aspects, subject insurance and the publication policy for the trial will be 
documented in the agreement between the sponsor and the investigator.
12 Confidentiality
All information generated in this trial will be considered confidential and will not be 
disclosed to anyone not directly concerned with the trial without the sponsor’s prior 
written permission. Subject confidentiality requirements of the region(s) where the trial is 
conducted will be met. However, authorized regulatory officials and sponsor personnel 
(or their representatives) may be allowed full access to inspect and copy the records, 
consistent with local requirements. All IMPs, subject bodily fluids, and/or other materials 
collected shall be used solely in accordance with this protocol, unless otherwise agreed to 
in writing by the sponsor.
Subjects will be identified only by unique subject numbers in eSource. If further subject 
ID is required, subjects’ full names may be made known to a regulatory agency or other 
authorized officials if necessary, subject to local regulations.
13 Amendment Policy
The investigator will not make any changes to this protocol without the sponsor’s prior 
written consent/assent and subsequent approval/favorable opinion by the IRB/IEC. Any 
permanent change to the protocol, whether an overall change or a change for specific trial 
site(s), must be handled as a protocol amendment. Any amendment will be written by the Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

 Confidential - Proprietary Information 73 Version 6.0, 07 Jul 2022sponsor. Each amendment will be submitted to the IRB/IEC, as required by local 
regulations. Except for “administrative” or “non-substantial” amendments, investigators 
will wait for IRB/IEC approval/favorable opinion of the amended protocol before 
implementing the change(s). Administrative amendments are defined as having no effect 
on the safety of subjects, conduct or management of the trial, trial design, or the quality 
or safety of IMP(s) used in the trial. A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent 
immediate hazard to subjects should be implemented immediately after agreement by the 
sponsor and investigator, followed by IRB/IEC notification within local applicable 
timelines. The sponsor will submit protocol amendments to the applicable regulatory 
agencies within local applicable timelines.
When the IRB/IEC, investigators, and/or the sponsor conclude that the protocol 
amendment substantially alters the trial design and/or increases the potential risk to the 
subject, the currently approved written ICF will require similar modification. In such 
cases, after approval/favorable opinion of the new ICF by the IRB/IEC, repeat written 
informed consent/assent will be obtained from subjects enrolled in the trial before 
expecting continued participation and before the amendment-specified changes in the 
trial are implemented.

aThe criterion value and change relative to baseline represented in this table are intended to identify 
on-treatment values outside of normal changes and that could potentially be clinically relevant.  In 
order to be identified as potentially clinically relevant, the on-treatment value must meet the 
“Criterion Value” and also represent a change from the subject’s baseline value of at least the 
magnitude shown in the “Change Relative to Baseline” column. When evaluating these values the 
emotional state of the subject must be taken into consideration (eg, crying, screaming) and 
documented as applicable.

I, the undersigned principal investigator, have read and understand the protocol (including the 
Investigator's Brochure) and agree that it contains all the ethical, legal and scientific information 
necessary to conduct this trial in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practices and as 
described herein and in the sponsor's (or designee's) Clinical Trial Agreement.
I will provide copies of the protocol to all physicians, nurses, and other professional personnel to 
whom I delegate trial responsibilities. I will discuss the protocol with them to ensure that they are 
sufficiently informed regarding the investigational new drug, brexpiprazole (OPC-34712), the 
concurrent medications, the efficacy and safety parameters and the conduct of the trial in general. 
I am aware that this protocol must be approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or receive 
a favorable opinion by the Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) responsible for such matters in 
the clinical trial facility where brexpiprazole will be tested prior to commencement of this trial. I 
agree to adhere strictly to the attached protocol (unless amended in the manner set forth in the 
sponsor's Clinical Trial Agreement, at which time I agree to adhere strictly to the protocol as 
amended).
I understand that this IRB- or IEC-approved protocol will be submitted to the appropriate 
regulatory authority/ies by the sponsor. I agree that clinical data entered on case report forms by 
me and my staff will be utilized by the sponsor in various ways, such as for submission to 
governmental regulatory authorities and/or in combination with clinical data gathered from other 
research sites, whenever applicable. I agree to allow sponsor and designee monitors and 
auditors full access to all medical records at the research facility for subjects screened or enrolled 
in the trial.
I agree to await IRB/IEC approval before implementation of any substantial amendments to this 
protocol. If, however, there is an immediate hazard to subjects, I will implement the amendment 
immediately, and provide the information to the IRB/IEC within the required local applicable 
timelines. Administrative changes to the protocol will be transmitted to the IRB/IEC for 
informational purposes only, if required by local regulations.
I agree to provide all subjects with informed consent/assent forms, as required by the applicable 
regulations and by ICH guidelines. I agree to report to the sponsor any adverse experiences in 
accordance with the terms of the sponsor's Clinical Trial Agreement and the relevant regional 
regulation(s) and guideline(s). I further agree to provide all required information regarding 
financial certification or disclosure to the sponsor for all investigators and sub-investigators in 
accordance with the terms of the relevant regional regulation(s). I understand that participation in 
the protocol involves a commitment to publish the data from this trial in a cooperative publication 
before publication of efficacy and safety results on an individual basis may occur, and I consent to 
be acknowledged in any such cooperative publications that result.

Note: If efficacy or safety assessments cannot be obtained at consecutive virtual visits, the investigator should discuss possible discontinuation of the su bject 
with the medical monitor.
In order to eligible for this trial, the screening and baseline visitsmust be in office. All other visits of the open -label treatment period after the baseline visit
can be virtual or performed per the protocol.
aDelayed rollover subjects must agree to discontinue all prohibited medications during the screening period as summarized in Table 6-1.
bThe investigator should verifiy the stability of comorbid conditions and that there is no potential ne w diagnosi s since the screening v ist in 
Trial 331-201-00148.
cThe screening period may be extended in order to repeat clinical laboratory tests and ECGs; if an extension is required, the site should contact the medical 
monitor.
dBaseline clinical laboratory  tests (h ematology, serum chemistry, and urinaly sis) and ECGs are not collected if screening clinical laboratory  tests/ECGs were obtained 
within 28 days prior to the baseline visit and within normal ranges.Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 331 -201-00191
15
Confidential -Proprietary Information Version 1.0, 06Jul20202 General Considerations
2.1 Telemedicine Virtual Visit s
Telemedicine virtual visits will be completed using the existing trial equipment and 
systems for virtual visits .
2.2 Reconsent
If there is a n immediate need to reconsent subjects during the period of COVID
-19 
restrictions, a paper reconsent proc ess will be followed and sites are encouraged to 
contact the clinical research organization ( CRO )andsponsor with questions .
2.3 Protocol Deviations
Protocol deviations that occur as a direct result of the COVID -19 pandemic must be 
recorded in eSource separat ely from other protocol deviations as soon as they  are 
identified and will be recorded as “Major” in eSource for data capture purposes . 
Examples of the ty pes of COVID
-19 related deviations to be reported may include: 
missed visits, missed assessments, asse ssments performed remotel y (completed outside 
of protocol procedure), missed 
investigational medicinal product ( IMP)dose, IMP 
dispensed/returned via courier, IMP not returned to site/site unable to verify medication 
compliance, out of window visits , chang es in rater, and prohibited concomitant 
medication. A “direct result” isdefined as being due to actual illness, or as a result of 
quarantine, social distancing, or site closures. All other deviations will follow the normal 
deviation process described in t he protocol and should not be entered proactively  by sites.
2.4 Guidance to Record A dverse Events and Discontinuations Due to 
COVID -19
If a subject tests positive OR is presumed positive with COVI D-19, the subject may  
continue in the trial with virtual visits only at the discretion of the investigator as long as 
they remain as ymptomatic for COVID -19, but an adverse event ( AE)of “Coronavirus 
Infection” OR “Corona virus Positive Test Result” must be recorded on the AE page of 
the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). All subjects who have mild sy mptoms of 
COVID -19 must be reviewed with the medical monitor and approval must be received 
for the subject to continue in the trial .A positive test result or a presumed positive subject 
is not automatically  a serious advers e event (SAE ), unle ss an SAE criterion is met 
(eg,hospitalization). If the event meets the criterion for an SAE, then the subject will be 
discontinued from the trial

Protocol 331-201-00191
16
Confidential - Proprietary Information Version 1.0, 06 Jul 2020If a subject discontinues due to COVID-19 either because the subject tests positive OR is
presumed positive with COVID-19, then the primary reason for discontinuation should be 
reported as “Adverse Event” and indicate the AE number in the “Specify the reason for discontinuation” space that corresponds with the AE of “Coronavirus Infection” OR
“Coronavirus Positive Test Result.” Be sure to remember to enter an AE in the AE form 
for the “Coronavirus Infection” OR “Coronavirus Positive Test Result.”
If a subject discontinues due to COVID-19 other than the subject testing positive OR 
being presumed positive with COVID-19, then the primary reason for discontinuation 
should be reported as “Other.” Be sure to specify the reason as “COVID-19” followed by
the reason ensuring that the prefix of the description includes “COVID-19.” Do note that the reason “Other” should be selected even if the subject decides to withdraw consent or if the investigator decides to withdraw the subject due to COVID-19 concerns.
In case of a caregiver that is COVID-19 positive and another caregiver is available to 
continue the trial, the situation should be discussed with the medical monitor to determine continuation in the trial on a case-by-case basis. If there is no other caregiver, the subjectneeds to be early terminated from the trial.
2.5 Statistical Analyses
Any impact of COVID-19 on the planned statistical analyses for the trial will be 
described in the final statistical analysis plan.
2.6 Clinical Outcomes
The administration of scales at virtual visits should be performed as described in the 
protocol, 
To decrease variability, sites should attempt to standardize the method of administration 
for a scale for an individual subject and across all subjects in the trial. Assessments 
should be administered by the same qualified/trained rater who rated the subject 
previously; if this is not possible due to staff availability and/or technological limitations, 
discuss relevant information with previous raters to obtain clinical context (note that per 
protocol raters must be trained/qualified to conduct assessments in all cases). Raters 
should conduct all assessments for that visit during the same remote session, where 
possible.
Please refer to Study Operations Manual for modification of administration methods for 
virtual visits.&OLQLFDO6WXG\5HSRUW 3URWRFRODQG3URWRFRO $PHQGPHQWV

will be asked to use an y weight collection device they currently  own
regardles sof calibration or validation, for weight measurements . (If there is no home 
weight collection device, the site will provide or reimburse for equipment. );
Weight and waist circumference measurement does not need to be videotaped. The 
caregiver will be instructed to provide the weight and waist circumference
measurement result to site staff on the visit day .Subjects will be instructed to be as 
consistent as possible regarding the time of day  the measurement saretaken, and to 
notify  the site staff of the measurement results via telephone, or other means, on the 
appropriate visits.
Site staff will be instructed to record the weight and waist circumference 
measurement sin eSource, and if there are believed to be any  errors, inconsistencies, 
or safet y concerns with the reported home measurement, the medical monitor should 
be notified.
4.1.2 Pregnancy
Pregnancy  tests will be performed as described in the protocol a t the virtual visits defined 
in this COVI D-19 Addendum Schedule sof Assessments ( Table 1.2-1 and Table 1.2-2) 
with the following changes: 
For planned visits that require a pregnancy  test for females of childbearing potential
(FOCBP) , the site will provide the necessary  tests and instructions so the test may  be 
performed at home;
Appli cable subjects will perform a pregnancy  test prior to dosing with IMP, ensuring 
a date and time -stamped picture or video of the result is taken
. The caregiver is to 
provide/show the result during the virtual visit .
If negative, site to inform thesubject to proceed with dosing .
If positive, the site must instruct the subject to immediately  stop taking IMP, and

aUse of intramuscular benzodiazepines and continual use of oral benzodiazepines are prohibited 
throughout the trial. However, limited use of specific oral benzodiazepines is permitted during 
screening to treat agitation or insomnia as shown in Table 4.1-2of the protocol .
bBenzodiazepines mu st not be administered w ithin 8 hours prior to scheduled efficacy assessments, and
EPS scales. Investigators are encouraged to delay scale administration until 8 hours have elapsed, if at 
all possible. How ever, if delaying administration of efficacy and EPS scales is not feasible, the scales 
should still be administered and the use of benzodiazepine documented, including a notation of the 
drug name, dose, and time of administration in eSource.Clinical Study Report 331-201-00191 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

ABSTRACT 
Context:  
Unintended adolescent pregnanc y is a major public health proble m in the United States that 
results in negative, multi-gener ational effects on the social, educational and health outcomes 
of young mothers and their children. Adolescent pregnancies cos t an estimated $9.4 billion 
each year.1,2 Although rates of adolescent pr egnancy declined 25% between 200 7 and 2011,3 
they remain among the highe st in the developed world.4 Importantly, the decline has largely 
been due to increased contraceptive use;5,6 still, half of adolescent  pregnancies are due to 
lack of contraceptive use, with another large portion due to incorre ct or inconsistent use.5-9 
Efforts to further increase adolescent contraceptive use remain  desperately needed. This data 
will help to elucidat e factors that affect  decision-making as w ell as barriers and facilitators 
to conception initiation in the E D setting, allowing us a criti cal understanding that will lead 
to developing patient-centered a pproaches for increasing contra ception initiation among 
these patients. 
Objectives:  
Primary Objective: Assess intenti on to initiate contraception ( “high”=very/somewhat likely 
vs. “low”=unsure/not likely/d efinitely not on Lik ert scale surv ey) among females aged 16 to 
18 years who receive ED-based c ontraceptive counseling. 
Secondary Objectives: 
1. Among the same population, assess com pletion of a referral for any contraceptive 
care, defined as attendance at a  referral site  within 4 weeks a fter the index ED visit. 
2. Assess the proportion who ultimatel y initiate contraception thr ough electronic 
medical record documentation (i.e ., visit note, procedure note,  medication review) 
and participant report  (follow-up calls). 
3. Use qualitative interview methodo logy to explore attitudes, bar riers, and facilitators 
that affect decisions to 1) expres s intention to initiate contr aception, 2) complete a 
referral for contrace ptive care, and 3) ulti mately initiate con traception among this 
unique group of high-risk adolescents.  
Study Design: Prospective Cohort 
Setting/Participants: 
This study will be conducted in the emergency department at the  Children’s Hospital of 
Philadelphia, PA and in the emerg ency department at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas 
City, MO. This will be a multi-site study. 
Advanced Practice Providers (A PPs) will be consented and traine d to administer 
contraceptive counseling to pati ents and answer a post-counseli ng questionnaire. We 
anticipate consenting and trai ning a maximum of 12 APPs per sit e. 
We anticipate enrolling 300 patie nts to obtain 270 evaluable su bjects. We anticipate 
conducting in-depth in person or  over-the-phone interviews with  50 enrolled subjects per 
    
   
   vi
site. Patients will be eligible f or enrollment if they are fema les aged 16-18 presenting with 
high risk of pregnancy. High risk of  pregnancy is defined as ad olescent females who report 
recent (within the last 6 months) or likely future sexual activ ity; do not desire pregnancy 
within the next year; are not us ing hormonal contraception or a n intrauterine device; and are 
not currently pregnant. 
Study Interventions and Measures:  
The study intervention is the imp lementation of Emergency Depar tment-based contraceptive 
counseling. An APP will provide thi s confidential , comprehensiv e, 10-15-minute 
counseling. The counseling will a ssess patients’ preferences re garding different methods, 
knowledge about methods, personal motivations, and environmenta l factors that may 
influence contraceptive use , such as partner preference.  
A subgroup of 50 enrolled participan ts will be interviewed in-p erson or over the phone, if 
necessary. All interviews will be conducted by trained members of our resear ch staff and 
will be audiotaped and professiona lly transcribed. These interv iews will be used as a 
thematic assessment of adolescen ts’ attitudes an d beliefs about  contraception.

 BACKGROUND INFORMAT ION AND RATIONALE 
1.1 Introduction 
Unintended adolescent pregnancy rates remain unacceptably high in the United States, and 
result in poor health outcomes for the young mothers and their babies, as well as significant 
social and financial costs to com munities and society as a whol e. While many factors 
contribute to the high rate of uni ntended pregnancies in this a ge group, an important issue 
that is potentially amenable to i ntervention is non-use of cont raception. Therefore, research 
focused on increasing initiation o f contraception among adolesc ents, particula rly those at 
high risk of pregnancy, is crucial . One approach that has been understudied is reaching these 
adolescents in non-traditional s ites of clinical  care – care se ttings that do not currently 
routinely provide contra ception services. The Emergency Departm ent (ED) is a setting that 
is well-positioned to provide the se services, as almost 19 mill ion adolescents seek care in 
EDs each year, and many adolescents are amenable to receiving r eproductive health care 
services in this setting. For th e highest-risk patients, the ED  is often their only or primary 
contact with the health care sy stem, and so in this setting we have a vital window of 
opportunity to improve contraception access for adolescents who  are unlikely to be reached 
through other clinical settings . We seek to capitalize on our p rior work and our ED programs 
focused on sexual health educati on in order to better understan d the decision-making around 
contraception initiation of adol escents at high risk for pregna ncy.  Our long-term goal is to 
reduce unintended pregnancy by imp roving access to contraceptio n among adolescents 
seeking care in the ED setting. B y elucidating factors that aff ect decision-making as well as 
barriers and facilita tors to conception initiation in the ED se tting, we will gain a critical 
understanding that will lead t o developing patient-centered app roaches for increasing 
contraception initiati on among these patients.  
1.2 Name and Description of Invest igational Product or Interven tion 
An Emergency Department-Based S tudy to Reduce Adolescent Pregna ncy is a multi-site, 
mixed methodology study to assess att itudes, barriers and facil itators to initiating 
contraception in the ED among t his high-risk group of patients.  We will adapt contraceptive 
counseling approaches used in outpa tient clinical settings to d eliver counseling during the 
ED visit, and our methods will a llow us to explore factors asso ciated with initiation of 
contraception during and after the  ED visit as well as issues a ffecting follow-up after ED 
care. Ultimately, we will devel op a toolkit supporting contrace ptive counseling and delivery 
in the ED, and design processes to support increased use of con traception among 
adolescents.  
1.3 Relevant Literature and Data 
Unintended adolescent pregnanc y is a major public health proble m in the United States that 
results in negative, multi-gener ational effects on the social, educational and health outcomes 
of young mothers and their children. Adolescent pregnancies cos t an estimated $9.4 billion 
each year.1,2 Although rates of adolescent pr egnancy declined 25% between 20 07 and 2011,3 
they remain among the highe st in the developed world.4 Importantly, the decline has largely 
been due to increased contraceptive use;5,6 still, half of adolescent pregnancies are due to 
   
   2
lack of contraceptive use, with another large portion due to in correct or inconsistent use.5-9 
Efforts to further increase adolescent contraceptive use remain  desperately needed. 
One approach to increase cont raceptive use among the highest-ri sk adolescents is to utilize 
non-traditional settings, such as the Emergency Department (ED) . Adolescents account for 
almost 19 million ED visits annua lly, and adolescents in the ED  frequently report recent 
unprotected intercourse, placing them at risk for unintended pr egnancy.10-14 Furthermore, 
there is growing support for provi ding sexual and reproductive health services in the ED,15-19 
with several research teams , including our own, having explored  various approaches for 
providing these services.20-35  In the ED, we have a vital wi ndow of opportunity to improve 
contraception access for adolescents who are unlikely to be rea ched through other clinical 
settings.  
Several studies have investigated feasibility and acceptability  of providing ED-based sexual 
health services. These have bee n primarily single-center studie s investigating adolescent 
preferences for theoretic al, not actual, services.21-23, 26, 28, 30 Studies of direct service 
provision have been limited by sma ll sample sizes, or used rese arch processes or research 
staff, rather than those that can be sustained long-term. Furth ermore, the majority of studies 
have focused on screening for se xually transmitted infections ( STIs),36,29,33,34,36,37  rather than 
pregnancy prevention, with the l atter focused on e mergency cont raception.22,34,38 An 
important gap remains in unders tanding  how to optimally delive r contraceptive counseling 
services in the ED tha t maximize contracep tive uptake. Importan t questions remain 
unanswered, such as which contraceptive services (counseling, p rescribing, or placement of 
medium and long-acting reversib le contraceptives), should be of fered in the ED, and which 
should be provided through referra l to sites with contraceptive  specialists. Recognizing that 
a “one size fits all” model is unl ikely to be successful, we mu st identify patient-centered 
factors that impact preferences  to understand what drives decis ion-making around 
contraceptive initiation for adol escents in the ED. Understandi ng adolescent decision-
making will allow us t o utilize the most e ffective processes fo r the ED setting, and to make 
optimal use of resources, while  maximizing the  likelihood of ad olescent contraceptive 
initiation. The goal of this applic ation is to examine whether adolescents who receive 
structured contraceptive counsel ing in the ED have a stronger p reference for initiating a 
method in the ED or prefer to be  referred. We will use a theore tical framework to explore 
domains that likely predict thes e preferences. In addition, we will assess rates of 
contraception initiati on after the ED visit.  
This proposal addresses a major  gap in health care access for t his vulnerable population and 
is consistent with Healthy Pe ople 2020 objectives: “Reducing pr egnancies among adolescent 
females (FP-8)” and “Increasi ng the proportion of sexually acti ve persons aged 15 to 19 
years who use hormonal or intra uterine contraception to prevent  pregnancy (FP-11).”39 In 
addition, the proposal directly a ddresses one of the high-prior ity research areas of the 
Population Dynamics Branch of N ICHD: “Behavioral research on th e use and non-use of 
contraception.”40 
1.4 Compliance Statement 
This study will be conducted in full accordance all applicable Children’s Hospital of 
Philadelphia and Children’s Merc y Hospital Research Policies an d Procedures and all 
   
   3
applicable Federal and state law s and regulations including 45 CFR 46. All episodes of 
noncompliance will be documented. 
The investigators will perform  the study in accordance with thi s protocol, will obtain 
consent, and will report unantic ipated problems involving risks  to subjects or others in 
accordance with The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia IRB Pol icies and Procedures and 
all federal requirements. Co llection, recording, and reporting of data will be accurate and 
will ensure the privacy, health, and welfare of research subjec ts during and after the study.  
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
The purpose of this study is to e lucidate factors that impact p references around same-day 
contraception initiation as well as follow-through after referr als for contraception care 
among adolescents in the ED. The central hypothesis of this res earch plan is that our work 
will illuminate specific and unique factors that influence adol escent decisions regarding 
contraceptive initiation after a  counseling session that will s ubsequently inform future 
models for patient-centered s ervice provision. We will utilize survey methods (Aims 1, 2 
and 3) and in-depth interviews  (Aim 4) to achieve our goal. 
2.1 Primary Obj ective (or Aim) 
The primary object of this st udy is to assess intention to init iate contraception among 
adolescent women ages 16 to 18 year s who have received ED-based  contraceptive 
counseling. 
2.2 Secondary Objectives (or Aim) 
The secondary objectives are to: 
 Assess completion of a referral for any contraceptive care 
 Assess proportion who ultimate ly initiate contraception 
 Explore attitudes, barriers, and f acilitators th at affect adole scent women’s decision to 1) 
express intention to initiate c ontraception, 2) c omplete a refe rral for contraceptive 
services, and 3) actually initiate contraception. 
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
3.1 General Schema of Study Design 
This is a prospective cohort s tudy of female pa tients ages 16-1 8 years old presenting to the 
Emergency Department at the Chil dren’s Hospital of Philadelphia  and Children’s Mercy 
Hospital. Prior to screening a nd enrolling any patients, a maxi mum of 12 Advanced Practice 
Providers per site will be appro ached, consented, and trained i n contraceptive counseling. 
During enrollment in the ED and a fter patients are screened to determine eligibility, a 
trained APP will conduct confidential contraceptive counseling during the ED visit. 
Following this counseling, both the patient and APP will comple te a questionnaire to 
provide feedback on the counseli ng session. At 8 weeks post-ED visit, the study team will 
conduct an EMR review or follo w-up phone calls to assess patien t initiation of a 
contraceptive method and comple tion of follow-up visits. A tota l of 300 patients across both 
   
   4
sites will be enrolled in the study. Of these 300 patients, 50 patients per site will be invited 
to complete an in-de pth interview assessi ng factors that influe nced patient follow-up and/or 
initiation of contraception post-contraceptive counseling. 
The proposed study will elucidat e factors that  affect adolescen ts’ decisions to initiate 
contraception in the ED, and to f ollow-through w ith referrals f or contraception services, 
after receiving standardized cont raception counseling. This pro ject is the next step in our 
ongoing line of research to impr ove sexual and reproductive hea lth services in the ED. We 
will build upon existing ED program s focused on sexual health e ducation and evaluate, in-
depth, factors contributing to indi vidual decision-making. This  project will move us towards 
our long-term goal: reducing uni ntended pregnancy by improving access to contraception 
among high-risk teens. 
3.1.1 Advanced Practice Nurse Screening, Consent, and Training 
APPs working in the Emergency Dep artment for at least 6 months will be approached to 
determine interest in partici pation in this study. Those who ar e interested will provide 
written consent and subsequentl y be trained to us e patient-cent ered, semi-structured clinical 
interview techniques, consist ing of two 4-hour training session s.  
3.1.2 Screening Phase 
Potentially-eligible patients w ill be identified by APP subject s during the course of normal 
clinical care, if the APP subj ect is part of the patient’s care  team. If a patient is eligible 
based on information from clinical  care, the APP subject will c ontact a research assistant. 
Research assistants will verif y with the clinical team that pat ients meet all eligibility criteria 
and whether the patient has the capacity to consent for themsel ves. If a patient meets all 
inclusion / exclusion criteria, w ritten consent / HIPAA authori zation will be obtained. 
Subjects who are 18 years old will provide  written consent and  HIPAA authorization for 
their own participation. Subj ects who are 16 or 17 years old wh o are seen in the ED without 
a parent/legal guardian will provide written consent and HIPAA authorization for their own 
participation. Subjects who are  16 or 17 years old who are seen  in the ED with a parent/legal 
guardian may elect to have their  parent/legal guardian involved  in the consent process if 
desired. In this scenario, subj ects will provide assent and per mission and HIPAA 
authorization will be ob tained from the parent/legal guardian t hat is present. 
3.1.3 Phase 1: Contraceptive Counseling 
Prior to counseling, patients wi ll complete a brief questionnai re to ascertain demographic 
information, sexual history, and contraception use and history.  Afterwards, a trained APP 
will provide a confid ential, comprehensive  counseling session l asting 10-15 minutes. This 
counseling session will include a s emi-structure d interview reg arding contracep tive choice, a 
review of contraceptive options , an assessment of patient prefe rence and understanding of 
contraceptive use, and a short c lient satisfac tion survey. 
3.1.4 Phase 2: Feedback and Follow-Up 
After counseling, patients will complete a questionnaire about their preferred form of 
contraception and intention to i nitiate a contraceptive method.  They will also complete an 
adapted Contraceptive Knowledge Assessment and a short question naire about their 
   
   5
experience receiving counseling. The APP who provided counselin g will also complete a 
brief follow-up questionnaire r egarding the counseling session.  Those patients who are 
interested will receive short-ac ting, reversible contraception or a contraceptive prescription 
before the completion of the ED  visit. As part o f counseling, a ll participants will be referred 
to an adolescent gynecologist, a hos pital-affiliat ed adolescent  clinic or to a local Title X 
funded clinic (based on patient pr eference and access) for addi tional counseling and to 
initiate or follow-up on initiati on, as applicable . All partici pants will have a “warm transfer” 
for follow-up.  
At 8 weeks post-ED visit, particip ants’ EMR will be reviewed to  assess referral completion 
and contraception initiation. If no follow-up visit is noted in  the EMR, a follow-up phone 
call will be made. 
3.1.5 Phase 3: Subgroup Interview  
A subgroup of 50 participants per site will be invited to compl ete an in-depth interview in-
person or, if necessary, over the phone; this interview, inform ed by the Ecologically-
expanded Theory of Planned Behavior (eTPB) will help assess the  factors that supported the 
decision to start new contracepti on and/or follo w-through to in itiate or change 
contraception. All interviews will be audiotaped and profession ally transcribed. 
3.2 Study Duration, Enrollm ent and Number of Sites 
3.2.1 Duration of Study Participation  
The total duration of  study participation pe r subject will be u p to 12 weeks. Emergency 
Department- specific procedures  will total 30 min utes, includin g screening, contraceptive 
counseling, and counseling feedb ack, with 10-15 minutes of this  time devoted to the 
contraceptive counseling. Parti cipants’ EMR will be reviewed 8 weeks after the ED visit, 
and a subset of participants will be interviewed in-person or o ver the phone within 4 weeks 
following the EMR review. 
3.3 Total Number of Study Sit es/Total Number of Subjects Projec ted 
The study will be conducted at 2 investigative sites in the Uni ted States, the Children’s 
Hospital of Philadelphia and Ch ildren’s Mercy Hospital in Kansa s City, MO. It is expected 
that a maximum of 12 APPs per si te will be consented and traine d to administer the 
contraceptive counseling. 
Recruitment will stop when approximately 270 evaluable subjects  are enrolled. It is 
expected that approximately 300 s ubjects will be enrolled to pr oduce 270 evaluable subjects, 
with half at each site.

delay limiting particip ation; present after sexual assault; or are pregnant, as per a pregnancy 
test conducted as part of standa rd clinical care. Through stand ard clinical care, APP subjects 
will also be able to determine those patients who are at high r isk for pregnancy, defined as 
those who: report recent (within last 6 months) or likely futur e sexual activity, defined as 
sexual activity in the next 3 mont hs; do not desire pregnancy w ithin the next year; are not 
using hormonal contraception or a n intrauterine device; and are  not currently 
pregnant.38After identifying a potentiall y eligible subject based on these  criteria, APP 
subjects will contact Emergency D epartment Research Assistants (RA). Research assistants 
will verify with the clinical team that patients meet all eligi bility criteria and whether the 
patient has the capacity to consen t for themselves. Both study sites are staffed with RAs 16 
   
   7
hours/day who are trained to monito r the ED electronic track bo ard for potential research 
subjects for ED-based studies. I f a patient meets all inclusion  / exclusion criteria, written 
consent / HIPAA authorization w ill be obtained. Subjects who ar e 18 years old will provide 
written consent and HIPAA authoriz ation for their own participa tion. Subjects who are 16 or 
17 years old who are seen in the E D without a pare nt/legal guar dian will provide written 
consent and HIPAA authorizati on for their own pa rticipation. Su bjects who are 16 or 17 
years old who are seen in the ED  with a parent/l egal guardian m ay elect to have their 
parent/legal guardian involved in the consent process if desire d. In this scenario, subjects 
will provide assent and permissi on and HIPAA aut horization will  be obtained from the 
parent/legal guardian that is pr esent. The consent for the stud y will encompass the 
contraceptive counseling with a n option for compl etion of the s ubgroup interview.  
4.2 APP Training 
Experts in gynecological health  and adolescent health will trai n the APPs to employ a 
patient-centered approach that in cludes a semi-structured clini cal interview to determine 
factors that influence contraceptive choice,42,43 followed by a review  of contraceptive 
options and their risks, benefits and side effects. APPs will b e trained in approaches rooted 
in motivational inte rviewing (MI) to suppor t adolescent autonom y. Use of communication 
strategies based on open-ended ques tions and reflec tive listeni ng greatly enhances the focus 
on patient preference and autonom y, assisting young women with selecting the method that 
works best for her.44 The training will consist two  4-hour training sessions, the fi rst via 
webinar, and the second via an i n-person interactive session to  learn about contraceptive 
methods and interviewing techni ques, and to address common ques tions. As part of training, 
APPs will perform counseling wit h mock patients, and be observe d by experts in 
gynecological health and adoles cent health, who will also provi de timely feedback after the 
first counseling session performed by each APP. These experts w ill use a standardized 
contraceptive counseling assessme nt form (based on the methods utilized in the CHOICE 
project45 to rate the APP’s performance  during each session and provide feedback, and 
subjects will complete a close d-ended survey assessing fidelity  to counseling topics and 
principles using a Likert sale ( 1 [strongly disagree] to 5 [str ongly agree].5 Details around the 
surveys are in the Appendix. 
4.3 Contraceptive Counseling 
After screening and consent proce dures are complete, adolescent s will complete a brief 
questionnaire to ascertain demogr aphic information, sexual hist ory, and contraception use 
and history (based on the NSFG).41 Next, a trained APP (worki ng a regularly-scheduled ED 
shift) will provide c onfidential, comprehensive contraceptive c ounseling. The counseling 
session will assess pa tients’ preferences r egarding different m ethods, knowledge about 
methods, personal motivations, a nd environmental factors that m ay influence contraceptive 
use, such as partner preference.  
Counseling will last 10-15 minutes, a duration that is easily i ntegrated into most ED visits, 
as the average length of sta y is 249 minutes (CHOP) and 159 min utes (CMH). 
   
   8
4.4 Feedback & Follow-Up 
After counseling, adolescents wi ll complete a que stionnaire ass essing preferred form of 
contraception and will be asked their intention to initiate a n ew contraceptive method during 
the ED visit or within the next  2 months, using a 5-point Liker t-type scale (“very likely” to 
“definitely not”). Par ticipants will be grouped as “high-intent ion” to initiate contraception 
(very or somewhat likely) or “lo w intention” (unsure, not likel y or definitely not) for Aims 1 
and 4. Participants will be ask ed reasons for contraception int ention and complete an 
adapted Contraceptive K nowledge Assessment (CKA).46 Study participants will also 
complete a short questionnaire about their experience receiving  counseling loosely based on 
the Oregon sexual and reproducti ve health client satisfaction s urvey47 to assess acceptability 
of the counseling. These surveys w ill be reviewed as the study progresses in order to make 
necessary adjustments. Participants will receive a $20 gift car d for participation. As part of 
standard clinical care, those w ho are interested in starting a short acting reversible 
contraception during the vis it (e.g., oral pi lls, patch, vagina l ring, or hormonal shot) will 
receive medication and/or a pres cription before c ompletion of t he ED visit. APPs will also 
complete a brief  questionnaire. 
As part of counseling, all partic ipants will be referred to an adolescent gynecologist, a 
hospital-affiliated adolescent clinic or to a local Title X fun ded clinic (based on patient 
preference and access) for additi onal counseling and to initiat e or follow-up on initiation, as 
applicable. All participants will have a “warm transfer” for fo llow-up. The APP will share 
clinic information and contact th e receiving site via an electr onic medical record (EMR) 
message or phone call. Study staff will assist as needed with m aking appointments, and will 
call/text appointment reminders  3 days prior, 1 day prior, and on the day of the appointment. 
We seek to limit logistical barr iers to follow-up care as much as possible.  
4.5 Subgroup Interview 
We will include a subgroup of the 50 enrolled participants per site, as follows: 6-12 
participants in each of four gr oups per site: 1) high intention  / completed follow-up and 
initiated contraception; 2) hi gh intention and completed follow -up but did not initiate 
contraception; 3) high intenti on but no follow-up or initiation ; 4) low intenti on. Participants 
will be interviewed until thematic  saturation is reached (i.e. no new themes emerge); we 
anticipate no more than 50 interviews per site, based on prior experience and literature 
review of qualitative methods studies.48,49 Participants will rece ive a $20 gift card for 
completing the interview. Whene ver possible, the in-depth inter views will take place in-
person, at a mutually convenien t time and in a l ocation easily accessible for the participant. 
If an in-person interview is not feasible, the interview will b e completed by phone. All 
interviews will be conducted by tra ined members of our research  staff and will be 
audiotaped and professionally tra nscribed, and all interviews w ill be informed by the 
Ecologically-Expanded Theory of P lanned Behavior (eTPB) as desc ribed below.  
4.5.1 Theoretical Model to Guide Interviews  
The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)  has been used extensi vely in behavioral 
interventions with adoles cents and sexual health.50-54 However, there is growing support for 
a broader, ecological perspect ive to amplify and extend efficac y of sexual risk reduction 
   
   9
interventions.55,56 Thus, we will use an over-arching Ecologically-expanded Theory of 
Planned Behavior  (eTPB ) to inform our interview guide.( see below) The guide will incl ude 
questions around each of the constructs of the eTPB in order to  help us identify factors that 
supported the decision to start any new contraception in the ED  and/or follow-through to 
initiate or change contracepti on. In addition, although self-ef ficacy is not a specific domain 
in the eTPB, we will assess this construct through questions in  the Perceived Behavioral 
Control (PBC) domain, as well as additional questions drawn the  Contraceptive Self-
Efficacy Scale.57 Sample questions are included in the Appendix.  
 
  
4.6 Subject Completion/Withdrawal 
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time without prejud ice to their care.

5 STUDY EVALUATIONS AND MEASUREMENTS 
5.1 Screening and Monitoring Evaluations and Measurements 
5.1.1 Electronic Medical Record Review 
 Date of birth 
 Sex 
5.1.2 Confidential Screening Interv iewing to Assess Eligibility 
 Level of risk for pregnancy, defi ned as those who: report recen tly (within the last 6 
months) or likely future sexua l activity (within the next 3 mon ths); do not desire 
pregnancy within the next year ; are not using hormonal contrace ption or an 
intrauterine device; and ar e not currently pregnant. 
 Currently pregnant 
 Illness limiting ability to be screened 
 Developmental delay limiti ng patient’s participation 
 Presenting after sexual assault  
5.1.3 Contraceptive Counseling  
Adolescents enrolled in the st udy will complete  a questionnaire  prior to their contraceptive 
counseling, to determine particip ant characteristics, and contr aception use and history. After 
the counseling session, participants will complete an additiona l questionnaire meant to 
assess their preferre d form of contracepti on and their intent t o initiate contraception, as well 
as an assessment of th e APP’s fidelity to the  counseling sessio n principles. Participants will 
be asked reasons for contracep tion intention and complete an ad apted Contraceptive 
Knowledge Assessment (CKA).46 Study participants wil l also complete a short questionnaire 
about their experience receiving counseling to assess acceptabi lity of the counseling. The 
APP’s who lead the sessions will also complete a standardized s urvey. 
5.1.4 Post-Counseling Electronic Medic al Record Review (at 8 weeks po st-ED visit) 
 Referral completion 
 Contraception initiation 
5.1.5 Semi-Structured Interviews 
A subset of participants enrolled in Aim 1 will be grouped into  four groups of 6-12 
participants and take part in sem i-structured, in-person interv iews conducted by trained 
interviewers, utilizi ng the Ecologically-e xpanded Theory of Pla nned Behavior (eTPB) 
described in the Research Strat egy. All interviews will be reco rded, and data obtained during 
the interviews will be  professionally trans cribed and coded for  analysis by Dr. Mollen and 
the study team. 
5.2 Safety Evaluation 
Subject safety will be monitored by tracking of adverse events by research staff. 
   
   11
6  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
6.1 Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint will be the  reported inte ntion to initiate  contraception at ED or follow-
up visit from survey responses.  
Secondary endpoints will i nclude the following: 
 The completion of a referral for any contraceptive care as asse ssed through EMR 
review or follow-up phone calls 
 The initiation of contracepti on as assessed through EMR review or follow-up phone 
calls  
 Saturation of themes f rom qualitative interviews that have been  coded and analyzed  
 
6.2 Statistical Methods 
6.2.1 Baseline Data  
Baseline and demographic charact eristics will be summarized by standard descriptive 
summaries (e.g. means and standard  deviations for continuous va riables such as age and 
percentages for ca tegorical variables such as gender). 
6.2.2 Efficacy Analysis 
Proportion who indicate high inten tion to initiate contraceptio n at ED or follow-up visit will 
be calculated along with 2-sided 95 % CIs. Participant character istics, factors contributing to 
initiation (from survey respons es), and contraceptive knowledge  scores will be compared 
between “high” and “low” inten tion groups using chi-square or F isher’s exact tests for 
categorical variables and t-tes t or Wilcoxon rank -sum test for continuous variables. We will 
use bivariate analyses to evalua te for potential confounders to  determine which are retained 
for final models. Using univariat e logistic regression models, we will assess relationships of 
participants’ characteristics , factors contribu ting to intentio n and contraceptive knowledge 
with the main outcome (intenti on to initiate contraception, yes /no). Multivariate logistic 
regression models will be cons tructed to identify independent p redictors of the binary 
outcome. Clinically important vari ables will be considered in t he multivariate models 
regardless of achieving statist ical significance in the univari ate models. Variables significant 
in the univariate models (P-valu e ≤ .20) and study site (CHOP v ersus CMH) will be adjusted 
for covariates in multivariate m odels. If some variables in the  multivariable models may 
result in multi-colinearity, we w ill use path analysis to ident ify correlations between the 
predictor variables and outcome  and to determine direct and ind irect relationships of the 
variables. The path analysis pe rmits the partitioning of the co rrelation between the variables 
into direct (i.e., direct effect  of a predictor on the outcome)  and indirect (i.e., indirect effect 
of a predictor on the ou tcome through another predictor variabl e) effects and measures the 
relative importance of the causa l factors. Potential interactio n effects will be examined and 
included in logistic regression m odels if significant. The effe cts of the factors on the 
outcome may differ by study site. W e will assess the difference s in the effects of the factors 
   
   12
on the outcome between the two stu dy sites by incl uding interac tion effects of study site 
with the factors in these models. 
For data analysis, every attempt will be made to ensure that th e extent of missing data is 
kept at a minimum during the study. Initially we will assess th e extent and pattern of missing 
data using frequencies and cross- tabulations. If data are missi ng for only a few cases (5% or 
less), then data analysis w ill be conducted only on study parti cipants with complete data.  
However, when such a strategy woul d result in loss of data from  a substantial proportion of 
participants or would lead to bias ed or inaccurate results, the n sensitivity analysis or some 
form of imputation will be performed.  The form of imputation u sed will depend on the 
nature of the data that are mis sing. If data are missing for pr imary endpoint (intention to 
initiate contraception, yes/no), f requencies for missing data b y site, patient characteristics, 
factors contributing to initi ation, and contraceptive knowledge  scores will be examined. If 
there are significant associat ions of missing-ness with any of these characteristics, we would 
consider imputation methods suc h as regression technique, hot-d eck, or best/worst case (for 
binary outcomes) and choose th e one which would be most appropr iate for the type of 
missing data pattern (i.e. missing a t random). If th ere is part ial follow-up, that partial data 
might inform selection of imp utation method. The imputation wil l be employed if there is a 
clear evidence of bias due to mi ssing data. Sensitivity analyse s will be performed to assess 
how sensitive results are to reasonable changes in the assumpti ons that are made for missing 
data. 
Transcripts of interviews will  be imported into NVIVO11 (QSR In ternational, Melbourne, 
Australia) to facilitate codi ng and analysis, and will be syste matically coded as available by 
the study team. Data analysis wil l use a modified grounded theo ry approach.  These methods 
consist of systematic inductive  guidelines for collecting and a nalyzing information to build a 
theoretical framework for understa nding the interview data. An initial coding tree will be 
developed a priori, based on inter view content and the eTPB con structs. Dr. Mollen will 
train 2 team members per site to c ode the data. For training, e ach coder will apply codes 
independently to 2 transcripts. Dr.  Mollen will code the same 2  transcripts, serving as the 
criterion (or reference) coder to ensure that a high degree of reliability is established. Inter-
rater reliability of coding w ill be assessed using NVIVO softwa re. Discrepancies will be 
resolved via consensus, with Dr . Mollen serving as  the final ar bitrator, and the coding tree 
will be adjusted as needed. Trans cripts will be re-coded if sig nificant changes to the coding 
tree are made; this iterative process will continue until the t ree is finalize d. The coding tree 
will be developed into a codebook, w ith definitions , rules, and  examples for each code. Each 
subsequent transcript will be  double-coded, and the team will m eet weekly to discuss any 
discrepancies that arise.  
We will use a modified ground theory approach to identify emerg ent themes within and 
across the interviews. After c oding, relevant portion of coded text will be re-read to identify 
themes related to each of the eT PB domains, refl ecting factors influencing contraceptive 
initiation, as well as to identif y additional themes that are o utside of the model. This 
approach recognizes that additiona l domains may emerge from ana lysis besides those 
already delineated. Moreover, we acknowledge that additional su bthemes within each 
domain may emerge. We will explore whether themes differ among young women by 
various characteristics (e.g., hi gh/low intention, demographics , completion of follow-up).  
   
   13
6.2.3 Safety Analysis 
All subjects entered into the study at Visit 1 will be included  in the safety analysis. 
Frequencies of AEs will be summarized, and SAEs (if any) will b e described in detail. 
6.3 Sample Size and Power 
As this is an exploratory study, we based our sample size on se veral potential prevalence estimates of 
“high intention” to obtain contraception as the primary outcome  for Aim 1. We assumed a 
prevalence of 50% high intention and repeated the calculation i f the prevalence was only 20%, and 
calculated the 95% CI around the point estimate. We anticipate similar levels of precision for our 
other outcomes.  
Attrition 
(%) Sample size  Prevalence 
(%) 95% CI  
0 300 50 44.3 - 55.7 
0 300 20 15.5 - 24.5 
10 270 50 44.0 - 56.0 
10 270 20 15.2 - 24.8 
20 240 50 43.7 - 56.3 
20 240 20 14.9 - 25.1 
30 210 50 43.2 - 56.8 
30 210 20 14.6 - 25.4 
 
Both study sites care fo r a large number of a dolescent females in the study age range (>4600 
CHOP and > 2200 CMH, annually), and each of the trained APPs wo rks 13 to 15 8-hour 
shifts per month. Thus, we anticipate reaching our sample size within 6 months 
(conservatively estimating eac h APP will enroll one participant  every 4 shifts, accounting 
for exclusion criteria and refusals).

7 SAFETY MANAGEMENT 
7.1 Clinical Adverse Events 
Clinical adverse events (AEs ) will be monitored throughout the study.  
7.2 Adverse Event Reporting 
Since the study procedures are no t greater than minimal risk, S AEs are not expected. If any 
unanticipated problems related t o the research involving risks to subjects or others happen 
during the course of this study (in cluding SAEs) they will be r eported to the IRB in 
accordance with CHOP IRB SOP 408: U nanticipated Problems Involv ing Risks to Subjects. 
AEs that are not serious but tha t are notable and could involve  risks to subjects will be 
summarized in narrative or other format and submitted to the IR B at the time of continuing 
review.  
8  STUDY ADMINISTRATION 
8.1 Data Collection and Management 
Data will be collected on a study t ablet, where it will be imme diately entered into a 
password- and firewall-protecte d online database, the Research Electronic Data Capture 
(REDCap, © Vanderbilt University), by a pa rticipants using a study tablet , and by a study 
team member. Each patient will  be assigned a unique study ID. P atient identifiers (date of 
birth and date of visit) will be c oded for crea tion of the anal ytic dataset. There will be a 
password protected ele ctronic master lis t linking the unique st udy IDs to individuals which 
will be kept in REDCap, in a secu re and separate folder from al l other study data. An 
electronic copy of the password- protected master list will be c opied to the o ffice computer 
of the site study investigator  for a length of time post-study as specified by their institution. 
At CHOP, the electronic copy of t he site’s password-protected m aster list will be maintained 
on the lead study investigator’s c omputer for a minimum of 6 ye ars after study closure 
completed in accordance with CHOP policy A-3-9. 
8.2 Confidentiality 
All data and records generated during this study will be kept c onfidential in accordance with 
Institutional policies and HI PAA on subject privacy. The invest igator will not use such data 
and records for any purpose othe r than conducting the study. 
No identifiable data will be use d for future study without firs t obtaining IRB approval or a 
determination of exemp tion. The investigator  will obtain a data  use agreement between 
provider (the PI) and any recipien t researchers (including othe rs at CHOP) before sharing a 
limited dataset (date s and zip codes).  
8.3 Regulatory and Et hical Considerations 
8.3.1 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
Data and safety will be monitore d on multiple le vels. Dr. Molle n (PI), the lead Research 
Coordinator and research staff will meet at least weekly to rev iew study progress, safety 
   
   15
issues, recruitment progress , and data quality. The entire rese arch team at both sites will 
meet monthly (via phone) to revie w study progress. The Research  Coordinator will produce 
quarterly reports describing rec ruitment milestones, adverse ev ents, and data quality. We 
will report any adverse events as directed by the institutional  IRB and adverse event (AE) 
reporting policies. Events will be reported promptly to the PI and the lead Research 
Coordinator who will make provisions to respond appropriately, ensuring referral to 
medical/professional resources, as needed. 
8.3.1.1  Breach of Confidentiality:  
The lead Research Coordinator, along with the PI will ensure th at all members of the study 
team have completed all mandatory confidentiality statements an d research ethics trainings, 
and that data have been handl ed and stored properly. Annually, research staff will be 
required to sign a statement ac knowledging their receipt and un derstanding of the 
confidentiality requi rements and pledging t o maintain confident iality of the data to which 
they have access. If a breach of c onfidentiality i s identified,  the PI will immediately notify 
the IRB by submitting a reportable event. The PI will, as neces sary, review and identify how 
the breach occurred a nd determine steps t o prevent future probl ems with ensuring 
participant c onfidentiality.  
8.3.1.2  Continuous Quality Assurance and Quality Control Procedures (QA/QC):  
QA/QC will be implemented to ensur e compliance with study requi rements in areas 
including recruitment and data c ollection. Qual ity control acti vities will be performed 
regularly on all Case Report Form s (CRF), electronic data, and participant files to ensure 
that all data collected is complete and accurate. These will in clude the reconciliation of data 
forms, verification of codes a nd labels, and careful review of each individual data field for 
omission and errors. This will be the responsibility of the lea d Research Coordinator and PI 
to periodically perform secondary r eview of these data as an ad ditional QA procedure. 
When necessary, Good Clinical Pra ctice (GCP) documentation proc edures will be followed 
to amend the data. Any queries g enerated will be logged, with n otification to all applicable 
parties of the issue and resolu tion. Problems with data capture  stemming from user or design 
errors will be addressed, as appropriate, with supplemental tra ining for staff, additional 
instruction for partic ipants, and/or the imp rovement of problem atic entries or procedures. In 
addition, internal reporting will be  maintained to manage visit  completion metrics. This 
reporting system will be utilize d by staff members for real-tim e scheduling of events, 
checking participant status, dete rmining event completion rates , tracking participants, and 
collating logistical information c rucial for participant retent ion. 
8.3.1.3  Unexpected Adverse Events:  
These are defined as any advers e event occurring in one or more  subjects in a research 
protocol, the nature, severity, o r frequency of which is not co nsistent with either: (1) the 
known or foreseeable risk of advers e event associated with the procedures involved in the 
research that are described in ( a) the protocol–related documen ts, such as the IRB-approved 
research protocol, any applicable  investigator brochure, and th e current IRB-approved 
informed consent document, and (b)  other relevant sources of in formation, such as product 
labeling and package inserts; or ( 2) the expected natural progr ession of any underlying 
   
   16
disease, disorder, or condition of the subject(s) experiencing the adverse event and the 
subject’s predisposing risk fact or profile for the adverse even t. 
8.3.1.4  Expected Adverse Event:  
This is defined as any event not meeting the definition of unex pected adverse event. 
8.3.1.5  Adverse Event Related to Participation:  
This is defined as an event tha t is at least partially caused b y participation in the research 
study. Relatedness is assessed usi ng the following terms: defin itely related, probably related, 
possibly related, unlikely to be  related, or unrelated. In gene ral, events that are determined to 
be at least partially caused by t he procedures involved in the research would be considered 
related to participation in the r esearch. Events determined to be solely caused by an 
underlying disease, disorder, or  condition of the subject, or o ther circumstances would be 
considered unrelated to par ticipation in t he research. 
8.3.1.6  Unanticipated Problem:  
This is defined as an incident , experience, or outcome that mee ts all of the following criteria: 
(1) unexpected (in terms of na ture, severity, or frequency) giv en: (a) the research procedures 
that are described in the proto col-related documents, such as t he IRB approved research 
protocol and informed consent doc ument; and (b) the characteris tics of the subject 
population being studied; (2) at l east possibly related to a su bject’s particip ation in the 
research; and (3) suggests that t he research places subjects or  others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological , economic, or social harm) t han was previously known or 
recognized.  
8.3.1.7  Unanticipated Problem Involving Risks to Subjects or Others:  
This is defined as an event tha t is unexpected, related to the research, and suggests that 
subjects are at greater risk t han was previous ly known or recog nized. 
8.3.1.8  Data Safety Monitoring Board 
We will convene a Data Safety Monitoring Board comprised of exp erts in adolescent 
reproductive health that are not  connected to this project or o ur Institutions. The Board will 
meet quarterly to monitor partic ipant safety and assess study p rogress, and will be available 
to meet on an ad hoc basis if an imm ediate safety concern arise s.  
8.3.2 Risk Assessment 
Risks to participants are antic ipated to be minimal. ED patient s with severe illness or who 
experienced sexual assault will  be excluded from this study to minimize the physical and 
emotional harm to study partic ipants. Counseling sessions will be administered by trained 
APPs in a confidential setting to a void emotional  discomfort to  participants when discussing 
sensitive matters. There is mi nor risk of variance of counselin g content, but this will be 
avoided by extensive training tha t will be provided to the APPs  by an adolescent family 
planning expert at each site. Counseling sessions will be conti nuously reviewed for quality. 
Additionally, there is minor risk o f unauthorized disclosure of  confidential information, 
which will be made known to participants and will be minimized by the research team’s 
efforts to ensure confidentialit y. Every effort will be made to  keep data coded. All 
   
   17
recruitment materials (e.g., si gned consent forms) and informat ion linking unique 
identification numbers to particip ant names will be stored in p assword-protected electronic 
files within REDCap. Only Dr. M ollen and designated study staff  will have access to these 
files. Risks are greatly redu ced by using secure files, storing  data on secure computers, and 
coding of data. Patients may c hoose not to participate.  
 8.3.2.1  Recruitment and Informed Consent 
A maximum of 12 APPs will be recruited from each ED at the two study sites. Advanced 
Practice Providers (APPs) worki ng in the Emergency Department f or at least 6 months will 
be approached to determine inte rest in participation in this st udy. Those who are interested 
will provide written consen t for study procedures. 
A total of 300 participants will be  recruited from the ED at th e two study sites, Children’s 
Hospital of Philadelphia and Ch ildren’s Mercy Hospital in Kansa s City. Potentially-eligible 
patients will be identified by A PP subjects during the course o f normal clinical care, if the 
APP subject is part of the patien t’s care team. If a patient is  eligible based on information 
from clinical care, the APP subject will contact a research ass istant. Research assistants will 
verify with the clinical team th at patients meet all eligibilit y criteria and whether the patient 
has the capacity to consent for themselves. If a patient meets all inclusion / exclusion 
criteria, consent / HIPAA aut horization will be obtained. Subje cts who are 18 years old will 
provide written consent and HIPAA authorization f or their own p articipation. Subjects who 
are 16 or 17 years old who are see n in the ED without a parent/ legal guardian will provide 
written consent and HIPAA authoriz ation for their own participa tion. Subjects who are 16 or 
17 years old who are seen in the E D with a paren t/legal guardia n may elect to have their 
parent/legal guardian involved in the consent process if desire d. In this scenario, subjects 
will provide assent and permissi on and HIPAA aut horization will  be obtained from the 
parent/legal guardian that is pr esent. The consent for the stud y will encompass the 
contraceptive counseling with a n option for compl etion of the s ubgroup interview. All 
participants will be given the  opportunity to ask questions and  decline participation. 
Completed consent documentation will be signed and dated by the  designated study staff, 
and a copy will be provided to the participant. As required in 45 CFR 46.116, when a minor 
participant reaches the age of  18, and is still undergoing rese arch procedures, fully informed 
re-consent will be conducted. Origi nal consent forms will be st ored electronically, in the 
REDCap Database, only accessible by Dr. Mollen and designated s tudy staff.  Participants 
will be reminded at all study appoi ntments that p articipation i s completely voluntary. 
8.3.2.2  Protections against Risk 
Participants will be informed tha t their participation in all a spects of the proposed study is 
entirely voluntary, and that they are free to withdraw at any t ime. Strict meas ures will be 
taken to ensure participant pr ivacy and confidentiality. All da ta will be coded and then 
stored in the secure REDCap data base, and all participants will  be assigned a unique 
identification number. The maste r list linking ide ntification n umbers to identifying 
information will be stored separ ately from the study database. All personally identifiable 
information will be kept strictl y confidential and stored in an  encrypted document, on a 
dedicated research server only a ccessible by Dr. Mollen and the  designated study staff. 
Original, signed and dated consen t forms will be in password pr otected folders within 
   
   18
REDCap only accessible by Dr. M ollen and the designated study s taff. Contact information 
for Dr. Mollen and the study team  will be included on consent f orms to allow participants to 
ask questions or raise concer ns about the study. Should any spe cific concerns arise, the 
study team would intervene to add ress problems including, if ne eded, a change or 
discontinuation of study procedur es. The mentor team and site I RB’s will be informed of 
any concerns, and the IRB and NIH will be informed of any adver se events. 
 8.3.3 Potential Benefits of Trial Participation 
In the long term, the findings of  this study could contribute t o a reduction in unintended 
pregnancies among adolescents. It  is also possible that the inf ormation obtained through this 
study will be used to create new  guidelines for adolescent-cent ered contraceptive services, 
which could directly benefit th e study population in the future . The minimal risks of 
participation are reasonable in  relation to these generalizable  benefits.  
8.3.4 Risk-Benefit Assessment 
As there is no more than minim al risk to study participation, a nd potential for minimal direct 
benefits and significant indirect  benefits, we feel that the be nefit outweighs the risk of 
participation.  
8.4 Recruitment Strategy 
APPs who have at least six months of experience will be recruit ed from each hospital’s 
Emergency Department. Study team members will consent APPs if t hey are willing and 
interested in study procedures. 
Potentially-eligible patients w ill be identified by APP subject s during the course of normal 
clinical care in the Emergency Department, if the APP subject i s part of the patient’s care 
team. Females ages 16-18 years ol d (inclusive) who present at t he Emergency Department 
with any chief complaint, will be  eligible. Adolescents will be  excluded if they are too ill to 
be screened; have developmental  delay limiting participation; p resent after sexual assault; or 
are pregnant, as per a pregnanc y test conducted as part of stan dard clinical care. Through 
standard clinical care, APP subj ects will also be able to deter mine those patients who are at 
high risk for pregnancy, defined as those who: report recent (w ithin last 6 months) or likely 
future sexual activity (withi n the next 3 months); do not desir e pregnancy within the next 
year; are not using hormonal cont raception or an intrauterine d evice; and are not currently 
pregnant.
38After identifying a potentiall y eligible subject based on these  criteria, APP 
subjects will contact Emergency D epartment Research Assistants (RA). Research assistants 
will verify with the clinical team that patients meet all eligi bility criteria and whether the 
patient has the capacity to provi de consent. Both study sites a re staffed with RAs 16 
hours/day who are trained to monito r the ED electronic track bo ard for potential research 
subjects for ED-based studies. The RA will confirm eligibility with the clinical care team. If 
a patient meets all inclusion / exclusion c riteria, written con sent / HIPAA authorization will 
be obtained. Subjects who are 18 ye ars old will provide written  consent and HIPAA 
authorization for the ir own participati on. Subjects who are 16 or 17 years old who are seen 
in the ED without a parent/legal  guardian will provide written consent and HIPAA 
authorization for the ir own participati on. Subjects who are 16 or 17 years old who are seen 
   
   19
in the ED with a parent/legal gua rdian may elect to have their parent/legal guardian involved 
in the consent process if desire d. In this scenario, subjects w ill provide assent and 
permission and HIPAA authorizati on will be obtained from the pa rent/legal guardian that is 
present.  
8.5 Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization 
If eligible, a study team member  will obtain APPs informed cons ent for study procedures. 
If eligible, a study team member  will obtain patient’s informed  consent for the study 
procedures. HIPAA Authoriza tion will be obtained as part of the  consent procedures. Study 
team members will verify with the  clinical care team that the p atient has the capacity to 
consent. Subjects who are 18 years old will provide written con sent and HIPAA 
authorization for the ir own participati on. Subjects who are 16 or 17 years old who are seen 
in the ED without a parent/legal  guardian will provide written consent and HIPAA 
authorization for the ir own participati on. Subjects who are 16 or 17 years old who are seen 
in the ED with a parent/legal gua rdian may elect to have their parent/legal guardian involved 
in the consent process if desire d. In this scenario, subjects w ill provide assent and 
permission and HIPAA authorizati on will be obtained from the pa rent/legal guardian that is 
present. Payment to Subjects/Families 
8.5.1 Reimbursement for trave l, parking and meals 
APPs will receive no reimbursement s. Training will be provided free of cost. 
For those participants attendi ng in-person follow-up interviews , reimbursement for SEPTA 
tokens or CHOP parking vouchers will be provided (as appropriat e).  
8.5.2 Payments to subject for time, eff ort and inconvenience (i.e. co mpensation) 
APPs will receive no payment for participation. 
Patients will receive remuneration for each completed study ass essment according to the 
following schedule: 
 Contraceptive counseling and fee dback questionnaire: $20 to par ticipant 
 Post-counseling intervi ew: $20 to participant

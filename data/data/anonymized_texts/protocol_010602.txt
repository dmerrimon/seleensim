Confidential and Proprietary 4 09 Sep 2016 1. SYNOPSIS
Name of Sponsor: Sunovio n Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
Name of Investigational Product:  Dasotraline (SEP -225289) 
Title of Study: A Randomized, Multicenter, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Parallel-group Efficacy 
and Safety Study of Dasotraline in Children Aged 6 to  12 Years with Attention -Deficit Hyperactivity 
Disorder (ADHD) in a Laboratory Classroom Setting  
Proposed Indication : Attention -Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)  
Study Centers: 3 - 6 cente rs in North America  
Planned Study Period : 9 months  
Study Objectives: 
Primary: To evaluate the efficacy of dasotraline compared to placebo on attention -deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in children (6 – 12 years of age) in a laboratory classroom 
setting.  
Secondary: 
•To evaluate the efficacy of dasotraline compared to placebo on ADHD symptoms throughout
the day (12 to 24 hours postdose) in children in a laboratory classroom setting.
•To evaluate the safety and tolerability of dasotraline using physical examinations, 12- lead
electrocardiograms (ECG), vital signs, adverse event (AE) reports, clinical laboratory results,
and Columbia – Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS) Children’s Assessment.
Study Design: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, efficacy and 
safety study in children with ADHD in a laboratory classroom setting . The study will be comprised of 
3 periods: S creening (up to 35 days) including a 3 - 5 day ADHD medication washout prior to Day  -1; 
Double- blind randomized treatment  with either dasotraline (4  mg/day) or placebo for14 days; and End 
of Study (EOS)  Visit (7 days after last dose ). Prior to the start of treatment ( Day 1) and following the 
conclusion of the double-blind period ( Day 15), subjects will undergo a full-day laboratory classroom 
evaluation during which approximately 12 to  18 subjects will be assessed. Each laboratory classroom 
day will include seven 30- minute simulated classroom sessions where trained observers will assess 
subjects using the Swanson, Kotkin, A gler, M-Flynn, and Pelham (SKAMP) Scale. In addition during 
each classroom session , a 10 -minute math test (Permanent Product Measure of Performance [PERMP]) 
will be administered to evaluate sustained attention and effort . Seven (±  2) days after the last dose of 
study drug, subjects will return to the clinic  and complete safety assessments.  
The p rimary efficacy endpoint will be baseline to endpoint change  in the SKAMP -Combined score. 
The SKAMP  is a validated 13 -item rating  scale that assesses manifestations of ADHD in a classroom 
setting through a combined score and 2 subscale scores; deportment items (interacting with other children, interacting with adults, remaining quiet, staying seated, complying with the teacher’s 
directions, and following the classroom rules) and attention items (getting started, sticking with tasks, 
attending to an activity, making activity transitions, completing assigned tasks, performing work 
accurately, and being neat and careful while writing or  drawing ). The PERMP is a 5 -page math test 
consisting of 80 problems per page (total of 400 problems); both attempted problems and correct problems will be assessed. Subjects are to complete as many problems as possible in 10  minutes. The 
appropriate math level for each subject is determined based on results of the math  pretest administered 
at screening.  
Safety  and tolerability  will be  monitored  throu ghout the study by physical and neurological 
Protocol SEP360-305, Version 3.00 Dasotraline  
Confidential and Proprietary 5 09 Sep 2016 examination s, 12-lead ECG,  vital signs,  AEs, clinical  laboratories  (hematology,  chemistry, and 
urina lysis), and C-SSRS. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety and clinical 
outcome data including data on AEs and serious AEs at regular intervals. 
Screening: The screening period will be completed within a maximum of 35 days prior to the first dose 
of study drug and will begin with  acquisition of informed assent by the subject and informed consent 
from at least one of the subject’s parents/legal guardians.   
Subjects will be confirmed to have been treated with a methylphenidate formulation for at least 6  weeks 
prior to Day  -7. Subjects will be evaluated by the investigator and confirmed to demonstrate adequate 
clinical response to prior treatment with methylphenidate  based on clinical assess ment and informant 
interview, as well as, review of available medical records. On Day  -7 the ADHD Rating Scale 
Version  IV - Home Version (modified for investigator administration) ( ADHD- RS-IV HV)  will be 
completed and subjects will attend a half -day practice laboratory classroom session intended to familiar ize 
them with classroom schedules and procedures  related to SKAMP evaluation s, PERMP tests, and other 
planned activities. All subjects will discontinue prior methylphenidate treatment for 3  - 5 days prior to 
Day -1 in order to ensure that there is at least a 72 -hour washout from methylphenidate prior to the 
assessment of ADHD symptoms on Day -1. The day before randomization, the subject’s parent/legal 
guardian will be contacted by study site staff in order to confirm clinical worsening of the subject’s 
ADHD symptoms since discontinuation of methylphenidate. Clinical worsening is defined as an 
ADHD -RS-IV HV total score ≥ 26 and demonstrat ion of  at least a 30% worsening in ADHD -RS-IV 
HV total score  since the last assessment (see Section  24, Appendix V ) and following the minimum 
72-hour washout from prior methylphenidate treatment. Subjects who do not demonstrate clinical worsening following washout of methylphenidate will be considered screen failures and not be 
randomized. 
Subjects may be rescreened a maximum of 2 times for out of range clinical laboratory results, 
insufficient medication washout periods, etc. 
Double -blind Period: On Day 1 subjects will return to the clinic in the morning, and those meeting all 
inclusion and no exclusion  criteria  will be randomized  (1:1) to receive 4 mg/day dasotraline or placebo, 
and will attend classroom sessions in which they will be evaluated for ADHD symptoms using the 
SKAMP assessment. During this baseline classroom assessment ( Day 1), subjects will be evaluated at 
regular intervals: approximately 8 AM , 10 AM , 12 PM , 2 PM , 4 PM , 6 PM , and 8  PM. Subjects will 
begin taking study drug on th e evening  of Day 1 (with or without food) and take one dose each evening 
before bedtime for a total of 14  days. Study drug should be taken at approximately the same time each 
evening. The first dose of study drug may be administered in the clinic before the subject leaves or  at 
home. On the night ( Day 14) before the second classroom day, study drug must be taken at 8 PM plus or 
minus 30 minutes. During the double -blind period, the clinical site will attempt to contact the subject’s 
parent/legal guardian daily with a reminder to administer study drug . A dosing diary will be provided to the 
parent/legal guardian  to record the date and time of each administration of study drug . On Day  15 subjects 
will return to the clinic in the morning and classroom sessions will be started at approximately 8 AM , 
10 AM , 12 PM , 2 PM , 4 PM , 6 PM , and 8 PM  to coincide with 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24 hour s 
following the Day  14 dose.  
End of Study : Seven  (±2)  days after the last dose of study drug, all subjects will return to the clinic 
and compl ete assessments. After the EOS  visit, all subjects will be referred for continuation of their 
care as determined by the investigator. Additionally, for subjects who complete the study or 
discontinue for tolerability or lack of efficacy reasons, the sponsor will provide support for approved ADHD medication  costs for up to 3 months after participation in the study, if deemed medically 
appropriate by the subject’s healthcare provider.
 
Number of Subjects (planned): This study is projected to randomize approximately 130 total subjects  
(55 for the placebo and 4 mg/day dasotraline group s and approximately 20 randomized to the 6 mg/day 
group under previous versions of the protocol).

discussed with the medical monitor); sleep aids (with the exception of melatonin); diphenhydramine 
except topical formulations; herbal and/or complementary treatments, eg, St. John’s Wort ; or CYP2B6 
substrates or inhibitors or inducers of CYP2B6. Subjects who require persistent asthma treatment 
during the study should be discussed with the medical monitor as they may be required to be 
discontinued from the study. 
Subject  is currently undergoing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for the treatment of ADHD, has 
initiated behavioral therapy (including school based interventions) less than 1  month prior to screening, 
or is receiving behavioral therapy and in the opinion of the investigator will not be able to follow a 
stable routine for the duration of the study. Note: Unavoidable changes in school- based interventions 
that occur during study participation will not be exclusionary, but should be documented by the investigator, to the extent possible . Subjects should not be enrolled who, in the judgment of the 
investigator, are expected to start substantially different or more intensive course of behavioral therapy 
over the duration of their participation in the study. 
See Section  10.3 for further information  on concomitant medications and Section  10.4 for other 
restrictions .

Statistical Methods:  
Hypothes is: 
Let μ 4mg/day  and μ PBO represent the changes from baseline at Day 15 in mean SKAMP-Combined score 
for dasotraline 4  mg/day and placebo arms, respectively. The following hypothesi s will be tested to 
compare the mean change values between the dasotraline 4 mg/day group and the  placebo group at  
Day 15: 
Dasotraline 4  mg/day versus placebo:  
 H 01: μ4mg/day  = μ PBO versus H 11: μ4mg/day  ≠ μ PBO 
Efficacy Analysis: 
An analysis of covariance (AN COVA) will be applied to evaluate the treatment effect for the primary 
efficacy endpoint between the dasotraline 4  mg/day and placebo groups for the intent- to-treat (ITT) 
population. The model will include treatment , mean SKAMP -Combined score at baseline, and site as 
fixed effects.  The primary efficacy analysis will be repeated for the per pro tocol ( PP) population. To 
explore the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis of change from baseline at Day 15 in ADHD 
symptoms in mean SKAMP- Combined score, 2 sensitivity analyses will be performed, a placebo -based 
multiple imputation pattern -mixture model (PMM) and a tipping point analysis using the PMM. 
A similar ANCOVA model, as described above, will be used for the secondary efficacy endpoints for 
the ITT population. 
Data collected for the 6 mg/day dasotraline arm will be used for exploratory anal yses.  
Multiplicity Considerations:  There will be no adjustment for multiplicity for the primary efficacy 
analysis, secondary efficacy analyses, or safety analyses.  
Safety Analysis:  
All safety analyses will be performed on the safety population , which includes subjects that had been 
treated with dasotraline 6 mg/day. Overall  AEs (or SAEs)  and AEs (or SAEs)  leading  to discontinuat ion 
will be  summar ized by system  organ  class  and preferred  term by presenting  the number and percentage  
Protocol SEP360-305, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Proprietary 9  09 Sep 2016 of subjects  with each AE. Descriptive  statistics  also will be provided by visit for observed  values  and 
changes from baseline of the following  safety  variables:  laboratory tests, vital signs,  and ECG  
parameters. Frequency  and severity  of suicidality  using the C-SS RS will be summarized  by visit.  
Sample Size: A post -baseline least square mean of 18.66 in mean SKAMP -Combined score obtained 
from an average of 7  assessments collected across the 12 -hour classroom day was observed for the 
placebo group in a similarly designed study (Wigal -2013).  It is assumed that the dasotraline group will 
have approximately 20% improvement in mean SKAMP-Combined score for dasotraline 4 mg /day 
versus placebo.  The treatment mean difference in change from baseline is therefore assumed to be 
4.0 units (effect size of 0.8) versus placebo on mean SKAMP -Combined score with a common standard 
deviation of 5 units for dasotraline 4 mg /day.  The two-sample t -test with equal variance procedure 
using nQuery Version 7.0 was utilized for the sample size/power calculation . A total of 100 subjects 
(50 each for the dasotraline 4  mg/day and placebo group s) will provide at least 9 5% power to detect a 
statistically significant treatment difference for th e dasotraline dose group versus placebo in the 
primary endpoint at a 5%  significance level (2 -sided).  
The study will target approximately 110 subjects randomized to either placebo or dasotraline 4 mg/day 
in an attempt to have 100 subjects complete the trial . In addition, approximately another 20 subjects 
were  randomiz ed to dasotraline 6 mg/da y under previous versions of the protocol . The total number of 
subjects randomized in this study will be approximately 130.

4.1. Background  
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized 
by persistent inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that is more severe or frequent when 
compared to individuals of the same developmental stage. There are a number of characteristics 
related to cognition that distinguish people with ADHD from people without ADHD including 
deficits in response inhibition ( Aron -2005, Got o-2010, Luna -2004) and reward sensitivity 
(Passarotti -2011), as well as working memory, attention, planning, and behavioral inhibition 
(Hervey -2004, Boonstra-2005, Willcutt-2005). ADHD is prevalent in approximately 8% to  10% 
of school-aged children and approximately 2% to 5% of adults ( Ferri -2014 ). Symptoms 
experienced in childhood often persist into adolescence and adulthood, al though the 
hyperactivity component tends to diminish over time (Ferri-2014). 
The etiology of ADHD is not fully understood, but it is believed that both genetic and non-
genetic factors are implicated in the disease. Several factors related to disturbances of neonatal 
development including premature birth, low birth weight and perinatal complications have been 
shown to increase the risk of developing ADHD in childhood ( Perricone -2013, Botting -1997, 
Amor -2005).The neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine are propos ed to have a critical 
role in the development of ADHD and thus receptors associated with these are key drug targets (Rader -2009 ).  
Current ADHD pharmacotherapies have effects on central catecholamine neurotransmission. In 
nonclinical microdialysis studies, ADHD drugs like amphetamine, methylphenidate, and 
atomoxetine increase dopamine and norepinephrine – either by reuptake inhibition or stimulation of release – especially in the prefrontal cortex. At clinically -efficacious doses, 50% dopamine 
transporter (DAT) occupancies are reported with methylphenidate in adults with ADHD (Volkow-1998).  
Adrenergic signaling in the prefrontal cortex is thought to control attentional processes and thus 
contribute to working memory and executive functions ( Arnsten -2011, Gamo -2011). Consistent 
with this neuronal circuitry, norepinephrine transporter (NET) inhibition (eg, atomoxetine) alone 
is sufficient for clinical efficacy in ADHD. The stimulants amphetamine and methylphenidate 
both increase norepinephrine concentrations centrally, and methylphenidate achieves 50% NET occupancy in human subjects at doses clinically efficacious in ADHD ( Hannestad -2010).  
Dasotraline (also known as SEP-225289) is a new chemical entity that is thought to produce its 
therapeutic effects in ADHD by inhibition of the presynaptic DAT and NET, as determined by 
receptor occupancy and microdialysis studies. Pharmacologi cally, dasotraline is consistent with 
dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (DNRI) effects. Dasotraline is a diastereomer of 
the major metabolite of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline, but is not a 
metabolite of sertraline, nor is it converted to the desmethylated metabolite of sertraline in vivo. Unlike amphetamines, dasotraline does not increase the release of these monoamines into the 
extraneuronal space. Dasotr aline's pharmacokinetic profile  allows plasma concentrations to 
remain in a therapeutic range over the 24 -hour dosing interval at steady state. 
Protocol SEP360-305, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  24 09 Sep 2016 As there is a considerable unmet medical need for ADHD medications in children and 
adolescents that optimize onset and duration of action, Sunovion believes dasotraline, a novel 
inhibitor of NET and DAT, may be a useful addition to the current treatment armamentarium. 
Based on the available data dasotraline may provide steady, full -day coverage of DAT and NET 
inhibition. Dasotraline is being evaluated as a once daily treatment for children, adolescents and 
adults with ADHD with possible therapeutic coverage across the 24-hour dosing interval. 
4.2. Study Conduct Rationale  
Dasotraline has been evaluated for the treatment of ADHD in 2 completed studies to date. An 
additional study was completed that evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and 
pharmacodynamic properties of dasotraline in pediatric (6 – 12 years) and adolescent 
(13 - 17 years)  subjects  with ADHD. I n this multicenter, open- label study 105 subjects were 
assigned to single oral doses of dasotraline 1  - 16 mg in a dose- escalating manner. Dasotraline 
was characterized by slow absorption (median t max was 9.6 to 12 hour s) and elimination (median 
t½ was 56 to 84 hour s) in both pediatric and adolescent  subj ects. The change in C max with dose 
was slightly greater than dose proportional. Increase in overall exposure (AUC) with dose was greater than dose proportional. Apparent oral clearance was highest in the lowest dose group 
relative to the higher dose groups. No deaths, serious adverse events (SAE), or discontinuations because of an adverse event (AE) were reported in this study. The most frequently reported AE 
by investigators w ere tachycardia (25 subjects; 23.8%) and electrocardiogram QT prolonged 
(5 subjects; 4.8%), nearly all of which were considered related to study drug and mild in 
severity.  Tachycardia AEs were reported in both age groups and in every dose cohort. Most 
events of tachycardia were reported on the day of study drug administration.  No subjects 
experienced QT prolongations > 500 msec. Based on the centrally read electrocardiogram 
(ECGs ) in the study, no clinically significant trends were identified within the ECG results.  
Blood pressure increased, blood pressure systolic increased, blood pressure orthostatic abnormal, and orthostatic hypotension AEs were reported in 1 subject each . Overall, after dosing, 
90 subjects (85.7%) met predefined criteria for orthostatic tachycardia and 40 (38.1%) met 
predefined criteria for orthostatic hypotension.  
A completed study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 2 doses of dasotraline (4 mg /day and 
8 mg /day) in adult subjects with ADHD. In this 4-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 
dasotraline (8  mg/day) was found to be safe and effective for t he treatment of adult subjects with 
ADHD.  
In addition, evaluation of the efficacy and safety of dasotraline (2  mg/day and 4 mg /day)  in 
pediatric subjects  with ADHD is currently ongoing in a randomized, double-blind, placebo -
controlled, multicenter study with a 6 -week treatment period . During this study approximately 
330 subjects  will be randomized to 2 mg /day dasotraline, 4 mg /day dasotraline, or placebo. 
Subjects who complete the 6- week treatment period are eligible to continue treatment in a 
6-month open-label study of dasotraline at doses of 2 mg /day, 4 mg /day, and 6 mg /day.  
Several studies to assess the efficacy and safety of dasotraline in adults with ADHD are ongoing,  
This will be the second study to assess the efficacy and safety of dasotraline in pediatric subjects  
with ADHD. This study will utilize a simulated classroom setting to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of dasotraline in pediatric subjects with ADHD. In t his setting subjects encounter activities 
Protocol SEP360-305, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  25 09 Sep 2016 and interaction normally found in a typical school day. The laboratory school protocol 
(Wigal -2006) is a particularly useful method for evaluation of efficacy in subjects with ADHD 
because it represents a controlled study setting for evaluation and comparison of study 
treatments.  
Further information on nonclinical and other clinical studies is provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
4.3. Risk -Benefit Assessment  
Two studies were recently completed to support dasotraline as a safe and efficacious treatment 
for adults with ADHD with minimal abuse potential.  
The first study was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, outpatient study at 30 sites evaluated the efficacy and safety of dasotraline in adults with ADHD using 2 doses (4 mg /day or 
8 mg /day) versus placebo over a 4- week treatmen t period. In this study, clinically meaningful 
treatment effects were observed for both dasotraline 4  mg/day and 8 mg /day compared to 
placebo. For the primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline in ADHD Rating Scale Version IV  (ADHD RS -IV) with adult p rompts total score at week  4, statistical significance was 
achieved for dasotraline 8  mg/day compared to placebo (adjusted p = 0.019) with a strong trend 
for dasotraline 4 mg /day (adjusted p = 0.076). Efficacy with both doses was observed for the 
secondary  endpoint Clinical Global Impression –Severity of Illness  (CGI-S; 4 mg  group 
p = 0.021; 8 mg  group p = 0.013). A dose response relationship was observed supporting 
pharmacological activity in ADHD. Decreases in 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol ( DHPG) 
concentration s indicated the presence of central NET inhibition. Adverse events (AEs) were 
consistent with dasotraline pharmacology, ie, insomnia, decreased appetite, dry mouth, and headache. Worsening of insomnia associated with das otraline was characterized by AEs, and 
shifts in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) total score, particular ly with dasotraline 8  mg/day. AEs, 
particularly insomnia, were the most frequent reason for discontinuation of dasotraline 8 mg /day. 
Decreases in mean body weight were generally greater for  dasotraline 8  mg/day than 4 mg /day. 
Increases in mean supine and standing heart rate observed during treatment and follow-up were 
generally higher on dasotraline 8 mg /day than 4 mg /day.  
No signs or symptoms of withdrawal upon discontinuation of dasotraline were observed for 
either dose. In addition, there was no evidence of drug liking or deterioration of psychiatric 
symptoms associated with either dose of dasotraline. No misuse or diversion of dasotraline was 
detected through the abuse potential monitoring plan  
A second study evaluated dasotraline’s abuse liability and was conducted in recreational 
stimulant users; results indicated that dasotraline has low abuse liability  (Koblan-2016) . All 
doses of dasotraline (8, 16, 36 mg) demonstrated significantly lo wer drug liking scores than 
methylphenidate (40, 80 mg) and were no greater than placebo.  
Four previous clinical studies in healthy adult subjects using single doses ranging from 0.2 mg  to

subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) using doses of 0.5 mg /day and 2 mg /day for up

7.1. Overall Study Design  
This i s a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel -group, efficacy and safety  study, 
in pediatric subjects  with ADHD in a laboratory classroom setting . The study will target 
100 subjects ( 50 per treatment group ) to complete the study. The study will be comprised of 
3 periods: Period 1: screening (up to 35 days) including a 3 - 5 day ADHD medication washout 
prior to Day  -1; Period  2: double-blind randomized treatment with either dasotraline (4  mg/day) 
or placebo for 14 days; and Period 3: End of Study (EOS) visit (7  days after last dose ). Prior to 
the start of treatment (Day 1) and following  the conclusion of the 14- day double-blind period 
(Day 15), subjects will undergo a full-day laboratory classroom evaluation during which 
approximately  12 to  18 subjects will be assessed. Each laboratory classroom day will include 
seven 30-minute simulated classroom sessions where trained observers will assess subjects using the SKAMP Scale. In addition during each classroom session, a 10 -minute math test (Permanent 
Product Measure of Performance [PERMP])  will be administered to evaluate sustained attention 
and effort . The appropriate math level  for each subject is determined based on results of the math  
pretest administered at screening.  
The p rimary effi cacy endpoint will be baseline to endpoint change in the SKAMP -Combined 
score.  
Safety  and tolerability  will be  monitored throughout the study by phy sical and neurological 
examin ation s, 12- lead ECG,  vital signs,  AEs, clinical  laboratories  (hematology, chem istry, and 
urinalysi s), and C- SSRS. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety and 
clinical outcome data including data on AEs and serious AEs at regular intervals. Screening: The screening period will be completed within a maximum of 35 days prior to the 
first dose of study drug and will begin with  acquisition of informed assent by the subject and 
informed consent from at least one of the subject’s parent s/legal guardian s. 
Subjects will be confirmed to have been treated with a methylphen idate for at least 6  weeks prior 
to Day  -7. Subjects will be evaluated by the investigator and confirmed to demonstrate adequate 
clinical response to prior treatment with methylphenidate  based on clinical assessment and 
informant interview, as well as, rev iew of available medical records . On Day -7 the ADHD 
Rating Scale Version  IV - Home Version (modified for investigator administration) 
(ADHD- RS-IV HV) will be completed and subjects will attend a half -day practice laboratory 
classroom session intended to f amiliar ize them  with classroom schedules and procedures related 
to SKAMP evaluations, PERMP tests, and other planned activities. All subjects will discontinue 
prior methylphenidate treatment for 3  - 5 day s prior to Day -1 in order to ensure that there is at 
least a 72 -hour washout from methylphenidate prior to the assessment of ADHD symptoms on 
Day -1. The day before randomization, the subject’s parent /legal guardian  will be contacted by 
study site staff in order to confir m clinical worsening of the subject’s ADHD symptoms since 
discontinuation of methylphenidate. Clinical worsening is defined as an ADHD- RS-IV HV total 
score ≥  26 and demonstrat ion of at least a 30% worsening in ADHD- RS-IV HV total score  (see 
Section  24, Appendix V ) sin

Protocol SEP360-305, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  31 09 Sep 2016 from prior methylphenidate treatment.  Subjects who do not demonstrate clinical worsening 
following washout of methylphenidate will be considered screen failures and not randomized. 
Double -blind Period: On Day  1 subjects will return to the clinic in the morning and those who 
meet all inclusion and no ex clusion criteria  will be randomized  (1:1) to receive 4 mg/day 
dasotraline or placebo and will attend classroom sessions in which they will be evaluated for 
ADHD symptoms using the SKAMP assessment. During this baseline classroom assessment 
(Day 1), subjects will be evaluated at regular intervals: approximately 8  AM, 10 AM , 12 PM , 
2 PM , 4 PM , 6 PM,  and 8 PM . Subjects will begin taking study drug on th e evening  of Day 1 (with 
or without food) and take one dose each evening before bedtime for a total of 14 days. Study drug 
should be taken at approximately the same time each evening. The first dose of study drug may 
be administered in the clinic before the subject leaves or at home. On the night ( Day 14) before the 
second classroom day, study drug must be taken at 8 PM plus or minus 30 minutes. During the 
double -blind period, the clinical site will attempt to contact the subject’s parent/legal guardian daily 
with a reminder to administer study drug. A dosing diary will be provided to the parent/legal guardian  
to record the date and time of each administration of study drug . On Day  15 subjects will return to the 
clinic in the morning and classroom sessions will be started at approximately 8  AM, 10 AM , 
12 PM , 2 PM , 4 PM , 6 PM and 8 PM  to coincide with 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24 hour s 
following the Day  14 dose. 
End of Study : Seven (± 2) day s after the last dose of study drug, all subjects will return to the 
clinic and complete assessments. After the EOS  visit, all subjects will be referred for 
continuation of their care as determined by the investigator. Additionally, for subjects who complete the study  or discontinue for tolerability or lack of efficacy reasons , the sponsor will 
provide support for approved ADHD medication costs for up to 3 months after participation in 
the study, if deemed medically appropriate by the subject’s healthcare provider . 
A study schematic is presented in Figure  1. Details of the study assessments and other 
procedures to be pe rformed at each visit are presented in  Table 2, Schedule of Assessments, and 
Section  11, Study Assessments. If necessary, subjects may return to the clinic at any time for an 
unscheduled visit. Th e timing of events during a sample laboratory classroom day is  provided in

7.2. Treatment Assignment and Blinding  
7.2.1. Treatment Assignment  
After successfully meeting study entry criteria, subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1  ratio 
to 1 of the following treatments:  
• 4 mg /day d asotraline (N  = 55 subjects)  
• Placebo (N  = 55 subjects)  
An Interactive Response Syst em (IXRS) will be used to manage randomization on Day  1 and, if 
necessary, for emergency unblinding (see Section  7.2.3) of treatment assignment during the 
study. The IXRS is an integrated web based subject and drug management system. 
Study medication will be assigned by an IXRS based on the randomization schedule. The IXRS 
will generate instructions on which medication  number to assign to a subjec t. 
7.2.2. Blinding  
This is a double-blind study. All study drug capsules (both dasotraline strengths and placebo) are 
identical in color, shape, size, and packaging in order to maintain the blind. 
Subjects, Sponsor personnel, Investigator staff, persons performin g the assessments, clinical 
operations personnel, data analysts, and personnel at central laboratories will remain blind to the 
identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until database lock and unblinding, 
using the following methods; (1) ra ndomization data are kept strictly confidential until the time 
of unblinding, and will not be accessible by anyone else involved in the s tudy with the exception 

Protocol SEP360-305, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  33 09 Sep 2016 of Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) members involved in regular review of safety 
data, and Clinical Trial Materials Management personnel , (2) the identity of the treatments will 
be concealed by the use of study drugs that are all identical in packaging, labeling, schedule of 
administration, and appearance. 
7.2.3. Emergency Unblinding Procedures  
The IXRS will be used, if necessary, for emergency unblinding of treatment assignment during 
the study. The blinded dose information is to be broken only in an emergency when knowledge 
of such treatment may have an impact on further treatment decisions or aid in the emergency treatment of the subject. Any subject for whom the blind is broken is to be discontinued from 
receiving any additional study drug and should undergo early termination procedures as 
described in Section  14. 
7.3. Rationale  
7.3.1. Rationale for the Study Design 
The current study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, laboratory 
classroom study in pediatric subjects with ADHD. This study was designed to evaluate the 
efficacy and duration of effect of dasotraline (4 mg /day) compared with placebo over an entire 
day in a simulated  classroom setting. The laboratory school protocol is a particularly useful 
method for evaluation of efficacy in subjects with ADHD because it represents a controlled study 
setting for evaluation and comparison of study treatments and is designed to mimic a typical school day. 
7.3.2. Rationale for the Dosages 
The dosage of 4 mg /day of dasotraline w as selected to evaluate dasotraline safety , tolerability,  
and efficacy within the dose range being evaluated in the ongoing studies in pediatric subjects 
with ADHD.  
A dasotraline 4 mg /day dose is  expected to produce plasma concentrations in pediatric subjects 
similar to those demonstrated to be effective in adults  with ADHD. 
7.3.3. Rationale for the Study Population 
The subject population includes males and females ranging from 6 to  12 years of age, and in 
concert with standard practice guidelines, will be required to have a diagnosis of ADHD 
established by a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation that reviewed Diagnostic and Stati stical 
Manual for Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM- 5) criteria for ADHD (inattentive, 
hyperactive, or combined presentation); diagnosis will be confirmed using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School- Age Children Present and L ifetime Version 
(K-SADS -PL). 
7.3.4. Rationale for the Endpoints 
The primary efficacy measure (mean SKAMP -Combined Score) is a widely accepted efficacy 
endpoint intended to assess functional impairment related to ADHD and has been used in many laboratory classroom studies in children ( Childress-2015, Wigal -2014).   
Protocol SEP360-305, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  34 09 Sep 2016 7.4. Prevention of Missing Data  
In an effort to minimize the number of subjects who are terminated from the study prior to study 
completion, the following study design and conduct elements are implemented; (i) use of clinical 
sites with a good track record of having performed this type of study, (ii) training provided to the 
clinical sites on the importance of the informed consent/assent process  and ensuring subjects and 
their parent/guardian understand the commitment they are making, including the intent to 
complete the trial, and (iii)  monitoring data collection for adherence during the study.

(68°F - 77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C - 30°C (59°F - 86°F). The subject’s parent(s)/legal 
guardian(s) will be instructed to store the study medication at room temperature.  
In addition, the subject’s parent(s)/legal guardian(s) will be instructed to store the study 
medication in a location where it cannot be inadvertently accessed and consumed by the subject and to remove all other ADHD treatments from the subject’s access.  
9.4. Dispensing of Study Drug  
An Interactive Response System (IXRS) will be used to manage subject screening and 
enrollment. The IXRS is an integrated web- based subject and drug management system.  Specific 
User Manuals will be supplied. 
Study medication blister cards will be assigned by the IXRS based on the treatment schedule. 
The IXRS will generate instructions on which medication number to assign to a subject. 
Appropriate guidelines should be followed in proper dispensation to the study participant. Each 
subject will be dispensed two 1 -week blister cards on Day  1. Proper accountability records must 
be maintained and up to date capturing all drug dispensing activities. 
Under supervision from the subject’s parent/legal guardian, subjects will self- administer the 
study drug on an outpatient basis (see Section  10.1 ). The daily dosage (one capsule) will be 
clearly labeled on the study drug blister card.   
9.5. Study Drug Accountability  
The Investigator or designee is responsible for storing the drug in a secure location and for 
maintaining adequate records of drug disposition that includes the dates, quantity, and use by 
subjects. If the study is stopped for any reason or completed, all unused supplies of drug will be returned to the Sponsor, unless other instructions are provided in writing by Sponsor/ clinical 
research organization ( CRO ). 
Upon receipt of clinical trial material (CTM) the Principal Investigator, or designee, will 
inventory the supplies and verify receipt of supplies. The site will send an Acknowledgement of 
Receipt to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, or designee, confirming date of receipt, inventory, and 
condition of CTM received. 
The Clinical Inventory Manag ement System (CIMS) will be used for accountability of the 
supplies at the clinical site. The Investigator, or designee, will maintain the inventory for 
accountability within CIMS, including CTM disposition, return and availability of CTM received. The Inv estigator, or designee, agrees to collect and document all used and unused study 
medication from study subjects/parent s/legal guardian s at appropriate study visits. 
Study drug will not be dispensed to any person who is not a study subject under this protocol. 
On Day 1 a dosing diary will be provided to the parent/legal guardian to record the date and time 
of each administration of study drug. On Day 15 the parent/legal guardian will bring the dosing 
diary  to the visit.  Only the date and time of the Day 14 dose will be entered into the database.

Confidential and Propr ietary  42 09 Sep 2016 10. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
10.1. Study Medication  
As described i n Section  7.2.1, subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatments (4  mg/day 
dasotraline or placebo). 
Under supervision from the subject’s parent/lega l guardian, subjects will self -administer the 
study drug on an outpatient basis for 14  days beginning the evening of Day  1. Study drug should 
be taken at approximately the same time each evening. The first dose of study drug may be 
administered in the clinic before the subject leaves or at home. On Day 14, the night before the 
second classroom day, study drug must be taken at 8  PM plus or minus 30 minutes. All study 
medication doses will consist of  1 capsule per day taken by mouth. 
Subjects may take study drug with or without food. 
Study drug capsules should not be opened or tampered with in any way; the active ingredient is 
an ocular irritant.  
10.2. Treatment Compliance  
During the double-blind period, the clinical site will attempt to contact the subje ct’s parent/legal 
guardian dai ly with a reminder to administer study drug.  
The Investigator will record the dose of the study drug and the dates of the initial and final administration  for each  dose.  
Compliance with study drug will be monitored closely and determined at each visit. Subjects and their parent(s)/legal guardian(s) will be instructed to bring all unused study drug with them to the Day 15 visit . Compliance will be assessed by counting capsu les and dividing the actual number 
of doses taken (per capsule count) by the number of doses the subject should have taken within a visit period and multiplying by 100. Subjects who miss more than 25% of scheduled doses or take more than 125% of the scheduled doses will be considered noncompliant. Evidence of 
noncompliance must be immediately reported to the Medical Monitor. Potential noncompliance 
will be discussed with subjects and their parent(s)/legal guardian(s), and at the investigator’s discretion may result in termination of the subject from the study. All subjects and their 
parent(s)/legal guardian(s) will be reminded of the importance of strict compliance with taking 
study drug for the effectiveness of treatment and for the successful outcome of the study.  
10.3. Concomitant Medications and Therapies  
The following information on all medication  administered between  signed consent/assent  and the 
EOS v isit or at  discontinuation will be recorded  on the CRF:  Medication  name, dose, frequency, 
route, start date, stop date, and indication. 
All medications will be coded using World Health Organization drug dictionary ( WHO- DD). 
Information on the format and version of the coding dictionary will be provided in the Data 
Management Plan (DMP).  
Collection of prior medications is described in Section  11.1.

Confidential and Propr ietary  44 09 Sep 2016 10.4. Restrictions 
Subject is currently undergoing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for the treatment of ADHD,  
has initiated behavioral therapy (including school based interventions) less than 1 month prior to 
screening, or  is receiving behavioral therapy and in the opinion of the investigator will not be 
able to follow a stable routine for the duration of the study. Note: Unavoidable changes in 
school-based interventions that occur during study participation will not be exclusionary, but 
should be documented by the investigator, to the extent possible. Subjects should not be enrolled 
who, in the judgment of the investigator, are expected to start substantially different or more intensive course of behavioral therapy over the duration of their participation in the study. 
10.5. Contraception Requirements  
Female Subjects  
A female subject is eligible to enter and participate in the study i f she is of:  
a. Non-childbearing potential (ie, physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant, 
including any female who is premenarchal, surgically sterile, etc).  
b. Child -bearing potential (all females ≥ 8 years of age), has a negative pregnancy test at 
screening and agrees to satisfy one of the following requirements: 
− Practice true abstinence (consistent with lifestyle) from signing informed 
consent/assent to at least 14  days after the last dose of study drug; or,  
− Use of medically effective method of birth co ntrol from signing informed 
consent/assent to at least 14  days after the last dose of study drug, which 
include: prescription hormonal contraceptives (oral, patch, vaginal ring, implant, or injection), diaphragm with spermicide, intrauterine device 
(IUD), condom with spermicide, surgical sterilization.  
Male Subjects  
Male subject must be willing to remain sexually abstinent (consistent with lifestyle) or with female partner(s) of childbearing potential must ensure that their partner(s) uses the methods of birth control as outlined for female subjects above. 
10.6. Guidance for Overdose  
There is no overdose experience with dasotraline in humans. Signs and symptoms of overdose in nonclinical studies were consistent with exaggerated pharmacology and included hyperactivity, stereotypy, aggressiveness, and reduced food intake and body weight loss. 
Activated charcoal may be of value if administered very soon after a dasotraline overdose (ie, 
during the absorption process). 
10.7. Cautions 
Dasotraline is an ocular irritant. Therefore appropriate precautions should be taken to avoid ocular exposure to the contents of the dasotraline capsules.

A study schematic is presented in Figure  1. A summary of assessments to be conducted at each 
visit is  presented in  Table 2. 
Traini ng, as appropriate, will be provided for study site staff administering each of the 
effectiveness and safety assessments.  
11.1. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics include date of birth, sex, ethnicity, race, and medical 
history. For medical and psychiatric histories, only relevant/significant history and recurrence of 
any condition will be collected.  All medications taken during the 30 day s before signed 
consent/assent will be recorded ; data collected will be the same as for concomitant medications 
(see Section  10.3). Weight, height, and BMI collection are described in Section  11.4.5. Physical 
and neurological examinations are described in Section  11.4.4. 
11.2. Eligibility Assessments  
Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School -Age Children Present and 
Lifetime version  (K-SADS -PL) 
The K-SADS -PL will be used at screening to confirm the diagnosis of ADHD.  
The K -SADS -PL is a semi -structured diagnostic interview designed to assess current and past 
episodes of psychopathology in children and adolescents according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders Fourth Edition; Text Revision ( DSM -IV-TR) criteria. The 
K-SADS -PL covers a broad spectrum of most child psychiatric diagnoses, with the exception of 
pervasive development disorders and personality disorders. The K- SADS -PL includes questions 
about school performance and other issues relevant to childr en and adolescents. There is a base 
instrument (82 items) and 5  required diagnostic supplements which are completed depending on 
the results of the base screening: (1)  Affective Disorders; (2) Psychotic Disorders; (3) Anxiety 
Disorders; (4) Behavioral Diso rders; (5) Substance Abuse and Other Disorders.  
The K -SADS -PL takes about 45- 90 minutes to administer.  
ADHD Rating Scale Version IV - Home Version (modified for investigator administration) 
(ADHD- RS-IV HV)  
The ADHD -RS-IV HV will be used to assess clinical worsening on Day  -1. 
The ADHD -RS-IV HV was developed to measure the behaviors of children with ADHD. The 
ADHD- RS-IV HV is a validated scale that consists of 18  items designed to reflect current 
symptomatology of ADHD based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders  
Fourth Edition; Text Revision  (DSM -IV-TR) criteria and is also consistent with DSM -5 criteria. 
Each item is scored from a range of zero (reflecting no symptoms) to 3  (reflecting severe 
symptoms) with total scores ranging from zero to  54. The 18 items may be grouped into 
2 subscales: hyperactivity/impulsivity (even number items  2 through 18) and inattentiveness 
(odd number items 1 through 17). The ADHD- RS-IV HV will be administered to the caregiver 
Protocol SEP360-305, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  47 09 Sep 2016 by a qualified rater at the site. The same study site rater should perform all ADHD -RS-IV HV 
assessments for a given subject whenever possible.  
11.3. Efficacy Assessments  
Swanson, Kotkin, A gler, M-Flynn, and Pelham (SKAMP) Scale  
The SKAMP is a validated 13 -item rating scale that assesses manifestations of ADHD in a 
classroom setting through a combined score and 2 subscale scores; deportment items (interacting 
with other children, interacting with adults, remaining quiet, staying seated, complying with the 
teacher ’s directions, and following the classroom rules) and attention items (getting started, 
sticking with tasks, attending to an activity, making activity transitions, completing assigned 
tasks, performing work accurately, and being neat and careful while writ ing or drawing).  
Permanent Product Measure of Performance ( PERMP ) 
The PERMP is a 5 -page math test consisting of 80 problems per page (total of 400 problems). 
Both attempted problems and correct problems will be assessed. Subjects are to complete as 
many problems as possible in 10 minutes.  
The appropriate math level for each subject is determined based on results of a math pretest 
administered at screening.  
11.4. Safety Assessments  
The Investigator or appropriate designee will review results of safety assessment s on a regular 
basis and the Sponsor must be kept fully informed of any clinically significant findings either at Screening or sub sequently during study conduct. 
11.4.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be collected for each subject. Subjects should be queried in a non- leading 
manner, without specific prompting (eg, “Has there been any change in your health status since your last visit?”). See Section  12, Safety Reporting. 
AEs and SAEs will be monitored throughout the study at all visits starting after the first dose of study drug. 
Untoward medical occurrences that occur prior to the first dose of study drug will be col lected as 
pre-treatment events.  
11.4.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
The clinical laboratory tests required by protocol are listed in Section  22, Appendix III . 
Blood and urine samples will be collected for clinical laboratory tests. All clinical laboratory 
tests will be performed  centrally . For detailed instructions regarding clinical laboratory 
procedures, sampling, and shipping guidelines refer to the Central Laboratory Instructions 
Manual . Samples will be processed at a central laboratory to ensure consistency . All clinical 
laboratories will be College of American Pathologists (CAP) and Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Amendments (CLIA) (or equivalent) certified.  
Protocol SEP360-305, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  48 09 Sep 2016 Any POC  (point of care) kits that are performed on site by study personnel rather than in a lab- 
must be CLIA waived and the study center  must possess a CLIA certificate of Waiver.  
11.4.3. Vital Signs  
Respirat ory rate and oral body temperature will be measured following 5  minutes of supine rest. 
An appropriately sized blood pressure cuff should be used based on the subject’s size. Blood 
pressure and pulse rate should first be taken with the subject in the supine position after resting 
for ≥ 5 minutes. Blood pressure and pulse rate will be taken again after the subject has been 
standing for ≥ 5 minutes. The same arm should be used during each assessment of blood pressure and pulse rate throughout the study. If a subject develops symptoms consistent with orthostatic 
hypotension (light-headedness, dizziness, or changes in sensorium upon standing) at any point, 
his or her supine and standing blood pressure and pulse rate should be collected at that time in the manner described above. Vital signs will be obtained prior to clinical laboratory collection 
and performance of an ECG. 
11.4.4. Physical and Neurological Examinations 
Clinically significant physical examination findings, as judged by the investigator, at screening 
will be recorded as medical history and after screening will be recorded as AEs  or pre -treatment 
events  depending on the timing in relationship to the first dose of study drug. 
Neurological examination parameters will be assessed by the investigator as normal or abnormal. 
11.4.5. Weight and Body Mass Index 
Body weight while wearing street clothes and with out shoes will be recorded in kilograms (kg). 
Height without shoes will be recorded in centimeters (cm). Body mass index will be determined from the tables provided ( Section  21, Appendix II) at screening and thereafter calculated by the 
electronic data capture ( EDC ) system  using height measured at screening and weight from the 
appropriate visit. 
11.4.6. ECGs  
Centrally -read ECG: All ECGs will be obtained in the supine position, after the subject has 
been resting supine for at least 5 minutes. ECGs will be 12 -lead with a 10 -second rhythm strip. 
ECGs should be obtained prior to drawing blood samples. All attempts should be made to use the 
same ECG recorder for all visits within individual subjects. ECGs will be centrally read at a core lab according to established quality assurance procedures for inter/intra reader variability. Refer 
to Section  20, Appendix I  for additional information. 
Standard 12 lead ECG will record heart rate (HR), PR interval, RR interval, QT interval, QTc 
with Bazett correction  (QTcB ) and QTc with Fridericia corr ection (QTcF ) intervals, and QRS 
duration. 
11.4.7. Safety Scales  
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS) Children’s Assessment  
The C-SSRS ( Posner-2007) is a tool designed to systematically assess and track suicidal AEs 
(suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation) throughout the study. The strength of this suicide 
Protocol SEP360-305, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  49 09 Sep 2016 classification system is in its ability to comprehensively identify suicidal events while limiting 
the over identification of suicidal behavior. The scale takes approximately 5 minutes to 
administer. The C- SSRS will be administered by a trained rater at the site.  
This study will utilize 2  versions of the C- SSRS. At the screening visit, the lifetime/recent 
version will be completed; for all subsequent visits the “Since Last Visit” version of the C-SSRS 
will be administered.  
Subjects who have significant findings for suicidal ideation upon completion of the C- SSRS at 
any time during the study must be referred to the investigator for follow-up evaluation.

Protocol SEP360-305, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  52 09 Sep 2016 12. SAFETY R EPORTING  
12.1. Definitions 
12.1.1. Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug r elated . 
Untoward medical occurrences that occur between the time of informed consent/assent and first 
study drug administration are pre -treatment events. Those that occur after first administration of 
study drug are considered AEs. 
An AE can , therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease occurring after the administration of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) produc t. AEs may 
include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre-existing conditions. A Es will be 
collected from after first administration of study drug to the last study visit. 
Lack of efficacy may be an expected potential outcome and should not be reported as an AE 
unless the event is unusual in some way. 
New signs and symptoms of underlying disease, or signs and symptoms of emerging diseas e 
must be recorded as AEs.  
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE 
and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
12.1.2. Serious  Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that meets one or more of the following criteria:  
• Results in death. 
• Is life-threatening.  
• Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly  or birth defect. 
• Is an important medical event tha t may jeopardize the subject  or may require a 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood d yscrasias or convulsions  that do 
not result in inpatient hospitalization . 
The term "severe" is often used to describe the severity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, 
or severe myocardial infarction)  (see Section  12.3); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
Protocol SEP360-305, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  53 09 Sep 2016 "serious," which is based on subject /event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject 's life or functioning as defined by the criteria above. 
During the study, if a subject  has a hospitalization or procedure (eg, elective surgery) that was 
scheduled before the study entry, ie, before informed consent for an event/condition that 
occurred before the study, the hospitalization is considered a therapeutic intervention and not the 
result of a SAE. However, if the event/condition worsens during the study, it should be reported as an AE (or SAE, if the event/condition results in a serious outcome such as prolongation of hospitalization).  
Life-threatening means that the subject was, in the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it occurred. This definition does not include an event that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death.  
SAE criteria information will be captured on the CRF. 
12.2. Objective Findings 
Clinically significant abnormal o bjective findings (eg, clinical laboratory value, ECG value, and 
physical examination observation) will also be recorded as  AEs. 
When a clear diagnosis is available that explains the objective findings, this diagnosis will be recorded as the AE, and not the abnormal objective finding (eg, viral hepatitis will be recorded as the AE, not transaminase elevation). If a definite diagnosis is not available, then record the sign 
(eg, clinically significant elevation of transaminase levels) or symptom (eg, abdomina l pain) as 
the AE.  
Clinical laboratory test results will be reviewed by the Investigator. The Investigator must 
determine the clinical significance of all out of range values. Clinical laboratory test with 
possibly drug- related or clinically relevant abnormal values of uncertain causality may be 
repeated. Any abnormal values that persist should be followed at the discretion of the 
Investigator. Laboratory reports will be initialed and dated on all pages by the Investigator. 
Clinical Laboratory Tests Outside  the Normal Range: Any value outside the normal range will be 
flagged for the attention of the Investigator or appropriate designee at the study center. The 
Investigator or appropriate designee will indicate whether or not the value is of clinical 
signific ance. If the result of any test (or repeat test, if done)  from the samples taken during 
Screening  is indicated as clinically significant and is not covered by the inclusion or exclusion 
criteria in Section  8, the subject will not be allowed into the study. Additional testing during the 
study may be done if medically indicated. If a clinically significant abnormality is found in the samples taken after dosing, during the study, and/or at the EOS  visit, this should be recorded as 
an AE and the subject will be followed until the test(s) has (have) normalised or stabilised. 
All on -site ECG tracings and ECG over -read reports will be reviewed by the Investigator. The 
Investigator must determine the clinical significance of all abnormal EC Gs. ECG with possibly 
drug- related or clinically relevant abnormal findings of uncertain causality  may be repeated . Any 
abnormal ECGs that persist should be followed at the discretion of the Investigator. ECG tracings will be initialed and dated on all pages  by the Investigator. 
Protocol SEP360-305, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  54 09 Sep 2016 12.3. Collection and Recording of Adverse Events  
All pre -treatment events and AEs must be recorded in the subject’s study records/source 
documents in accordance with the Investigat or’s normal clinical practice. All pre -treatment 
events and AEs/all AEs must be recorded on the CRF. 
All AEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization of the condition, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. 
Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity , frequency , seriousness,  action taken with the 
study treatment, outcome, and causal relationship to the s tudy treatment. Definitions for severity , 
frequency , action taken with the study treatment, outcome, and causal relationship to the s tudy 
treatment  are presented below.  
The severity  of AE:  
• Mild  - Ordinarily transient symptoms that do not influence performance of subject’s 
daily activities. Other t reatment is not ordinarily indicated. 
• Moderate - Marked symptoms sufficient to make the subject uncomfortable. 
Moderate influence on performance of subject’s daily activities. Other treatment may 
be necessary.  
• Severe - Symptoms cause considerable discomfort. Substantial influence on subject’s daily ac tivities. May be unable to continue the s tudy, and other treatment may be 
necessary.  
The frequency  of AE : 
• Once – an isolated episode.  
• Intermittent  – occurs on two or more separate occasions.  
• Continuous  – does not abate from date of onset to date of resolution. 
The action taken  with the s tudy treatment: 
• Drug Interrupted  – Study drug stopped temporarily. 
• Drug Withdrawn  – Study drug stopped permanently. 
• Dose Not Changed  
• Not Applicable.  
• Unknown  
The outcome of the AE: 
• Recovered/Resolved  
• Recovering/Resolving 
• Not Recovered/Not Resolved  
• Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae  
• Fatal 
Protocol SEP360-305, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  55 09 Sep 2016 • Unknown  
The causal relationship of the AE to the s tudy treatment:  
• Not related  
o Not related  - Improbable temporal relationship and is plausibly related to 
other drugs or underlying disease.  
o Unlikely - occurred within a reasonable time frame after 
administration/discontinuation of the study drug, but there is a likely 
association of an intercurrent/underlying medical condition or other drugs.  
• Related  
o Possible  - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration, but 
could be related to concurrent drugs or underlying disease. 
o Probable  - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration, is 
unlikely to be attributable to concurrent drugs or underlying disease, and there 
is a plausible mechanism to implicate the study drug. 
o Definite  - occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administration and 
cannot be explained by concurrent drugs or underlying disease. The adverse event should respond to dechallenge/rechallenge, however, this is not 
mandatory before assigning a definite causality.  
The Medical Monitor is the initial contact person for protocol related questions or discussion of 
AEs. The contact information for the Medical Monitor as well as other emergency contact 
information can be found in Table 1 of this protocol. 
12.4. Immediately Reportable Events  
The following medical events must be immediately reported to  the Sponsor: 
• SAE  
• Pregnancy  
Emergency contact information can be found in Table 1. 
12.4.1. Serious Adverse Event  
If the Investigator or study center  staff becomes aware of a SAE that occurs in a study subject 
after first administration of study drug through 30 day s following the last dose of the s tudy 
medication, this must be reported immediately to  the Sponsor whether considered related or 
unrelated to the study drug. SAEs must be recorded on the CRF and the data recorded should 
agree with that on the SAE form. 
Following the end of subject participation in the s tudy, the Investigator or an authorized delegate 
should report SAEs “spontaneously” to PPD -PVG if considered at least possibly related to the 
study drug.  
SAEs will be followed until resolution, loss to follow-up, stabilization of condition, or the event 
is otherwise explained.  
Protocol SEP360-305, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  56 09 Sep 2016 In addition to the initial notification, an initial SAE form as applicable must be completed and 
signed and sent via fax or email  (see Table 1) to PPD -PVG within 1 business day of the 
Investigator or s tudy center staff becoming aware of the event.  The SAE form must be signed by 
the Investigator or appropriate designee. PPD -PVG provides the SAE form used to report SAEs. 
The Sponsor or designee will promptly notify all study centers and Investigators of a SAE that is 
determined to be expedited to the Regulatory Authorities in accordance with  applicable law (s) 
and regulation(s ). These SAEs must be promptly reported to the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) by the Principal Investigator  or the appropriate person at the study center  if required per 
IRB guidelines. 
12.4.2. Pregnancy  
Pregnancies  that occur from the time of informed consent /assent  through 30  days following the 
last dose of the s tudy medication will be collected and reported on the Pregnancy Event Form. 
If a subject  becomes pregnant during the course of the study, she /parent/legal guardian  will be 
instructed to commence discontinuation of the study medication. Further, t he subject / 
parent/legal guardian  (or female partner of male subject) will be instructed to return 
promptly/within 48 hours of the first notification of pregnancy to the study center  and undergo a 
serum  pregnancy test, as confirmation of pregnancy. If positive, the female pregnant subject will 
no longer receive any additional study medication. All pregnancies, whether or not the subject 
received any additional s tudy medication, will be followed until resolution (ie, termination 
[voluntary or spontaneous] or birth). 
To report a pregnancy, the Pregnancy Event Form must be completed and sent via fax to PPD -
PVG within 1 business day of the Investigator or study center staff becoming aware of the 
pregnancy. The Sponsor provides the Pregnancy Event Form. If the subject received blinded study medication, unblinding of the s tudy medication will be 
offered to the subject when knowledge of such treatment may have an impact on further 
treatment decisions. Otherwis e, information regarding to what treatment the subject was assigned 
may be provided when the s tudy has ended . 
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the study drug may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication  or other AEs were detected . 
12.5. Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor safety throughout the study. The 
DSMB will be independent of the Sponsor, CRO, and the investigators and will be empowered 
to recommend stopping the study due to safety concerns. The membership of the DSMB and its mandate will be described in a separate DSMB charter.

Confidential and Propr ietary  57 09 Sep 2016 13. TERMINATION OF SUBJECT FROM 
STUDY/ DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY DRUG  
13.1. Criteria for Subject Termination  
Subject s may terminate the study participation  at any time for any reason.  
The possible reasons for the termination of study participation  are as follows : 
• Adverse event.  
• Lack of efficacy (specify).  
• Lost to follow- up (specify).  
• Pregnancy.  
• Withdrawal by subje ct (specify).  
• Non-compliance with study drug (specify) . 
• Protocol deviation (specify) . 
• Death . 
• Other (specify).  
If at any time during the course of the study, in the opinion of the Investigator, the subject may 
no longer safely participate due to a change in medical status (eg, experiences an AE, becomes 
pregnant), the subject must be discontinued from the study treatment . 
The reason for discontinuation an d information will be recorded on the appropriate CRF. In case 
of death, the date of death should be captured on the CRF. 
Subjects who prematurely terminate the s tudy participation may  be replaced.  
Subjects who discontinue study drug prior to completion wi ll be asked to return to the clinic  and 
complete the EOS visit 7 (±  2) day s later (Section  11.5.3).  
Protocol SEP360-305, Version 3.00  Dasotraline  
Confidential and Propr ietary  58 09 Sep 2016 14. STUDY TERMINATION  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study at this study center or at multiple centers 
for safety or administrative reasons at any time  while safeguarding that early termination does 
not compromise subjects’ safety or well- being . In particular, a study center that does not recruit 
at an acceptable rate may be closed . Should the study be terminated and/or the study center 
closed for whatever reason, all documentation and s tudy medication s pertaining to the s tudy 
must be returned to the Sponsor or its representative. 
If, in the opinion of the Investigator, clinical observations suggest it may be unsafe to continue, 
the Investigator may terminate part or the entire study after consultation with the Sponsor. 
In the event of s tudy or site termination, subjects will be required to return to the clinic and 
complete the EOS visit 7 (±  2) days after their last dose of study drug and provide d with access 
to standard care.

Confidential and Propr ietary  59 09 Sep 2016 15. STATISTICS  
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will provide details on the statistical methods planned for 
this study and will be finalized before the study   database lock (DBL).  
15.1. Sample Size  
A post-baseline least square mean of 18.66 in mean SKAMP-Combined score obtained from an 
average of 7 assessments collected across the 12 -hour classroom day was observed f or the 
placebo group in a similarly designed study (Wigal -2013).  It is assumed that the dasotraline 
group will have approximately 20% improvement in mean SKAMP-Combined score for dasotraline 4  mg/day versus placebo. The treatment mean difference in change from baseline is 
therefore assumed to be 4.0 units (effect size of 0.8) versus placebo on mean SKAMP -Combined 
score with a common standard deviation of 5 units for dasotraline 4 mg /day. The two-sample 
t-test with equal variance  procedure using nQuery Version 7.0 was utilized for the sample 
size/power calculation . A total of 100 subjects (50 e ach for dasotraline 4  mg/day and placebo 
groups ) will provide at least 95% power to detect a statistically significant treatment difference 
for th e dasotraline 4 mg/day dose group versus placebo in the primary endpoint at a 
5% significance level (2 -sided). 
The study will target approximately 110 subjects randomized to either placebo or dasotraline 
4 mg/day in an attempt to have 100 subjects complete the trial.  In addition, approximately 
another 20 subjects were randomized to dasotraline 6 mg/day under previous versions of the 
protocol. The total number of subjects randomized in this study will be approximately 130. 
15.2. Analysis Populations  
The analysis populations are defined below. Subjects will be analyzed based on the treatment to 
which they are randomly assigned.  
ITT (Intent -to-Treat) population: The ITT population is defined as all subjects who are 
randomized. The ITT population will be used for the efficacy analyses. 
Safety population: The safety population includes all subjects who are randomized and receive at 
least 1 dose of study medication. All safety analyses will be performed using the safety 
population. 
Per Protocol (PP) population: The PP population will consist of all subjects from the ITT 
population without any important protocol deviation (s ee Section  15.3.3). This supplemental 
efficacy population will be used to assess robustness of the primary analysis results. 
15.3. Data Analysis 
15.3.1. Subject Di sposition 
Subject disposition will be summarized for all randomized subjects. Subjects who complete the study and discontinue from the study will be summarized. The reason for discontinuation from the study will also be presented.

Confidential and Propr ietary  60 09 Sep 2016 15.3.2. Drug Exposure and Complia nce 
A descriptive summary will be performed for exposure to study medication. Treatment 
compliance will be determined and summarized descriptively using the safety population. 
15.3.3. Important Protocol Deviations 
Protocol deviations (PDs) will be collected during monitoring visits. Protocol deviations will be 
placed, but not limited to, into the following categories: concomitant medications, dosing, enrollment inclusion/exclusion criteria, laboratory, non-compliance, and other. Each instance of 
a protocol deviation will be reviewed and determined to be important or minor before the study 
DBL.  
A summary of protocol deviations will be provided as number (%) of subjects with at least 
1 protocol deviation and number (%) of subjects in each category in all randomized subjects.  
The definition of important protocol deviations will be detailed in the study SAP and the subjects 
with important protocol deviations will be pre-identified (prior to unblinding of the study). 
15.3.4. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics (sex, race, ethnicity, age [years], baseline weight  [kg], height [cm], and BMI 
[kg/m
2]) will be summarized for the safety and ITT populations. Sex, race, age group, and 
ethnicity will be summarized using summary statistics (n and percentage) for categoric al 
variables. Age, baseline height, baseline weight, and baseline BMI will be summarized using 
summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) for continuous variables. 
15.3.4.1. Medical History  
Medical history will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). The count and percentage of subjects under each history term, coded by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) will be summarized using the safety population. 
15.3.4.2. Psychiatric History  
Psychiatric h istory will be summarized by DSM -5. The count and percentage of subjects under 
each DSM -5 code will be summarized using the safety population. 
15.3.5. Efficacy Analyses 
15.3.5.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis 
The primary endpoint of change from baseline at Day  15 in ADHD symptoms as measured by 
mean SKAMP -Combined score obtained from an average of the 7 assessments collected across 
the 12-hour classroom day (12 to 24 hours postdose) will be evaluated. 
An analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA) model will be applied to evaluate the treatment effect for 
the primary efficacy endpoint between the dasotraline 4  mg/day and placebo groups for the ITT 
population. The model will include treatment, mean SKAMP -Combined score at baseline, and 
site as fixe d effects.

• that occurred on or after the first dose of s tudy medication,  
• with a missing start date and a stop date on or after the first dose of s tudy medication, 
or 
• with both a missing start and stop date.  
AEs will be summarized by treatment and by MedDRA system org an class  (SOC) and Preferred

the AE with the highest known severity within each body system and within each 
preferred term will be include d in the summaries by severity.  
• For summaries by relationship to the study medication, AEs will be grouped as 
“related” or “not related.” AEs assessed as “possible,” “probable,” or “definite,” will be grouped as “related.” If a subject reports more than one AE within the same 
treatment regimen, SOC and PT, and any are related, it will be summarized as related. AEs whose relationship to treat ment is assessed as “not related” or “unlikely” will be 
grouped as “not related.”

result during the course of the study period (Abnormal > Normal) will be presented by treatment.  
15.3.6.6. Concomitant Medications  
All medications will be coded using World Health Organization drug dictionary ( WHO- DD). 
The prior medications will include medications started prior to the first dose date of study drug. 
The concomitant medications will include medications started on or after the  first dose date of 
study drug. 
Frequency counts and percentages of previous and concomitant medications will be presented by

SCORE NECESSARY FOLLOWING WASHOUT FROM PRIOR
METHYLPHENIDATE TREA TMENT
On Day  -1 a subject must demonstrate evidence of worsening of ADHD symptoms following a 
minimum 72 -hour washout from prior methylphenidate treatment. Worsening in ADHD 
symptoms is defined as meeting both of the following criteria:  
•ADHD- RS-IV HV total score ≥ 26
•At least a 30% worsening in ADHD -RS-IV HV total score  since the last assessment .
Table 8 provides a list of screening ADHD -RS-IV HV total scores and associated scores that 
indicate a 30 % worsening following the minimum 72 -hour washout from prior methylphenidate 
treatment.

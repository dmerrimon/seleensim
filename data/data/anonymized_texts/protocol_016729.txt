Assessments  Safety:  AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, ECGs, vital signs, pulse oximetry, 
ophthalmologic examinations, and physical examinations  
Efficacy and PD: spirometry, SwCl, CFQ -R, weight, height, multiple breath 
washout, and documentation of other events related to  outcome (e.g.,  PEx, 
CF-related hospitalizations)  
Other Assessments:  
FE-1 and IRT will be measured to assess exocrine pancreatic function.  
Blood samples for blood biomarker analysis will be collected at select study visits 
for potential exploratory evaluation of correlations between blood biomarkers 
with PD, treatment benefit, and AEs.  
  
Statistical Analyses  The primary objective of the study is the evaluation of the long -term safety and 
tolerability of VX-445/TEZ/IVA. The safety endpoints of long -term treatment 
include AEs, clinical laboratory values, ECGs, vital signs, pulse oximetry, and 
ophthalmologic examinations from the first dose of study drug in this study, for 
subjects who receive at least 1  dose of study drug in this long -term safety stud y. 
The safety analysis will be descriptive.  
The secondary objective of the study is the evaluation of long -term efficacy and 
PD of VX -445/TEZ/IVA, as assessed by spirometry, SwCl, CFQ -R, PEx and 
CF-related hospitalizations, BMI, height, weight (and related  z-scores), and 
LCI 2.5. Methods of efficacy analyses will be similar to those used in the parent 
study unless otherwise specified.  
  
Interim Analyses  Interim analyses may take place at any time at the discretion of the sponsor.  
  
IDMC Reviews  An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will conduct regular safety 
reviews of study data as outlined in the IDMC charter.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  3 SCHEDULE OF ASSESSME NTS 
Table 3-1 and Table  3-2 provide the schedules of assessments. All visits are to be scheduled 
relative to the Day  1 Visit in each Part.  
The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnai re-Revised (CFQ -R) must be completed before any other 
assessment (except informed consent form [I CF] signing) at relevant clinic visits. Multiple 
breath washout (MBW) assessments should be performed before spirometry, and ECG should be 
performed before any  assessments that may affect heart rate (such as blood draws). Remaining 
assessments may be performed in any order when more than 1  assessment is required at a 
particular time point. All assessments will be performed before study drug dosing 
(Section  9.6.1 ), unless noted otherwise.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Background  
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive chronic disease with serious morbidities and 
frequent premature mortality. CF affects more than 70,000  individuals worldwide1 
(approximately 30,000 in the US2 and 45,000  in the EU3). Based on its prevalence, CF qualifies 
as an orphan disease.4, 5 
CF is caused by decreased quantity and/or function of the CFTR protein due to mutations in the 
CFTR  gene.6 CFTR is an ion channel that regulates the flow of chloride and other ions across 
epithelia in various tissues, including the lungs, pancreas and other gastrointestinal organs, and 
sweat glands.7 Decreased CFTR quantity or function results in the failure to regulate chloride 
transport in these tissues leading to the multisystem pa thology associated with CF.8 In the lungs, 
obstruction of airways with thick mucus, establishment of  a chronic bacterial infection in the 
airways, and damaging inflammatory responses are all thought to play a role in causing 
irreversible structural changes in the lungs, leading to respiratory failure. Progressive loss of lung 
function is the leading caus e of mortality.9  
The most common disease -causing CFTR  mutation is F508del , which accounts for 
approximately 70% of the identified alleles in people with CF.10 Approximately 40% to 45% of 
people with CF are homozygous for F508del (F/F), and approximately 85% have at least 
1 F508del allele.2, 3 
Based on the understanding of the  molecular defects caused by CFTR  mutations, 
2 complementary approaches have been developed to address the decreased quantity and/or 
function of CFTR in order to enhance chloride transport in patients with CF. Correctors facilitate 
the cellular processing and trafficking to increase the quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. 
Potentiators increase the channel open probability (channel gating activity) of the CFTR  protein 
delivered to the cell surface to enhance ion transport . With differing mechanisms of acti on, a 
combination of correctors and potentiators increases F508del CFTR -mediated chloride transport 
more than either type of modulator alone.  
The therapeutic activity of CFTR modulators has been established with products developed by 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated and approved for the treatment of CF: ivacaftor (IVA) 
monotherapy (Kalydeco ), lumacaftor (LUM)/IVA (Orkambi ), and tezacaftor (TEZ)/IVA 
(Symdeko , Symkevi). 
VX-445 is a next -generation CFTR corrector. In vitro, the triple combination (TC) of VX -445, 
TEZ, and IVA (VX -445/TEZ/IVA) increased CFTR chloride transport more than any of the dual 
combinations (VX -445/TEZ, VX -445/IVA, and TEZ/IVA) or individual components (VX -445, 
TEZ, and IVA) when added to human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells der ived from 2  groups of 
CF patients: those  heterozygous for F508del with a second CFTR  allele carrying a minimal 
function (MF) mutation that is not responsive to TEZ, IVA, and TEZ/IVA (F/MF genotypes); 
and those homozygous for F508del (F/F genotypes).  
Additi onal information about VX -445/TEZ/IVA can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.

9.1.1  Treatment Period  
Treatment Period assessments are listed in Table 3-1 and Table  3-2. 
Part A:  
Subjects will receive the first dose of study drug on Part A Day  1 after obtaining informed 
consent (and assent, when applicable) and confirming eligibility. Subjects who enroll in this 
study on a study drug interruption will NOT receive the first dose of stud y drug until they meet 
the resumption criteria in Section 9.8; before receiving study drug, subjects will repeat all Part A 
Day 1 assessments.  
Study drug administration details are provided in Section  9.6.  
Subjects whose Part A Day 1 Visit is NOT within 1 day of the last scheduled visit o f the parent 
study will repeat all Part A Day 1 assessments.  
Subjects whose Part A Day 1 Visit is within 1 day of the last scheduled visit of the parent study 
will NOT have to repeat any Part A Day 1 assessments that were specified to be performed at the 
last scheduled visit in the parent study.  
Part B:  
For subjects who elect to enroll in Part B, the Part A Week 96 Visit will be the start of treatment 
in Part B (i.e., Part B Day 1).  
Subjects whose Part B Day 1 Visit is on the same day or within 1 calenda r day of the Part A 
Week 96 Visit do NOT have to repeat any Part B Day 1 assessments that were specified to be 
performed at the Part A Week 96 Visit. Subjects whose Part B Day 1  Visit  is more than 
1 calendar day after  the Part A Week 96 Visit must complete  all assessments specified for the 
Part A Week 96 AND Part B Day  1 Visits.  
Protocol VX19 -445-107, Versio n 2.0 Page 25 of 59 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  9.1.2  Safety Follow -up 
In Parts A and B, the Safety Follow -up Visit is scheduled to occur 28 (±  7) days after the last 
dose of study drug. The Safety Follow -up Visit assessments are liste d in Table 3-1 and 
Table  3-2.  
The Safety Follow -up Visit is required for all subjects. However, subjec ts will complete the 
respective Part A or Part B Week 96 Visit and will not have a Safety Follow -up Visit if the 
subject transitions within 28 days of the last dose of study drug to one of the following:  
• A commercially available Vertex CFTR modulator regi men,  
• Managed -access -program -supplied Vertex CFTR modulator regimen,  
• Or, to another Part of the current study or another qualified Vertex study.  
If the transition occurs before the Week 96 Visit, then subjects will complete the Early 
Termination of Treatmen t (ETT) Visit. In these cases, the Week 96 Visit or the ETT Visit, 
whichever is applicable, will replace the Safety Follow -up Visit.  
For subjects who complete an ETT Visit 3  weeks or later following the last dose of study drug, 
the ETT Visit will replace the Safety Follow -up Visit (Section  9.1.3 ). 
9.1.3  Early Termination of Treatment  
If a subject prematurely discontinues study drug treatment, an ETT Visit  should be scheduled as 
soon as possible after the decision to discontinue treatment.  
If the ETT Visit occurs 3  weeks or later following the last dose of study drug, then the ETT Visit 
will replace the Safety Follow -up Visit, and a separate Safety Follow -up Visit will not be 
required.  
If a subject withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent or assent, no further 
assessments will be performed. Vertex may retain and continue to use any data and samples 
collected before such withdrawal of consent or as sent. 
9.1.4  Lost to Follow -up 
A subject will be considered lost to follow -up if both of the following occur:  
• The subject misses 2  consecutive study visits (telephone contact and/or clinic visit) and is 
subsequently unable to be contacted by telephone (3 documented attempts by telephone 
within 2  weeks following the second missed visit)  
• The subject does not respond within 2  weeks to a registered letter sent  after the 3  attempted 
telephone contacts.  
9.1.5  Completion of Study Participation  
Completion of study pa rticipation for each individual subject is defined as: the Safety Follow -up 
Visit; or, in situations in which the ETT Visit or the Part A or B Week 96 Visit replaces the 
Safety Follow -up Visit (Section  9.1.2 ), the ETT  Visit or Part A or B Week 96 Visit.  
If subjects withdraw consent or assent, completion of study participation is defined  as date of 
withdrawal of consent or assent, whichever is earlier  (Section  9.9). 
Protocol VX19 -445-107, Versio n 2.0 Page 26 of 59 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  If subjects are lost to follow -up (Section  9.1.4 ), the date of completion of study participation will 
be defined as the date of last contact.  
The end of study is defined in Section 13.2.8 . 
9.1.6  Independent Data Monitoring  Committee  
This study will be monitored by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), which will 
conduct periodic reviews of safety data from the study (Section 12.3.6.2 ). Procedural details of 
the IDMC structure and function, frequency of meetings, and data planned for review will be 
included in the IDMC charter. The IDMC charter will be finalized before the first subject is 
enrolled.  
9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to  Treatment Groups  
This is an open -label study. Randomization is not required because all subjects will be treated 
identically in a single cohort. An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used to 
dispense dosage based on subject weight and age.  
9.3 Rationale for Study Elements  
9.3.1  Study Design  
This Phase  3 study will enroll subjects who completed the last treatment period visit in the parent 
study of VX-445/TEZ/IVA and meet eligibility criteria. Results from this study will provide 
information on the long -term safety and efficacy of TC treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA in 
subjects with CF who are 6  years of age and older and homozygous or heterozygous for the 
F508del mutation.  
9.3.2  Study Drug Dose and Duration  
To evaluate long -term safety, tolerability, and efficac y, the study drug doses evaluated are the 
same as the doses evaluated in the parent study. Subjects will receive a study drug dose 
appropriate for their weight, as described in Section 9.1. 
The overall treatment duration of 96  weeks in each Part was used in open -label extension studies 
for previously approved CFTR modulators, and is considered sufficient for the evaluation of 
long-term safety and efficacy.  
9.3.3  Rationale for Study Assessments  
The safety, efficacy, and PD assessments are standard parameters for clinical studies in drug 
development and are generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant to the study of 
subject s with CF. Baseline and follow -up ophthalmologic examinations are recommended for 
monitoring of pediatric patients treated with regimens containing IVA, and have been included in 
the standard safety assessments.  
Obstruction of airways with thick mucus, chr onic bacterial infection of the airways, and the 
inflammatory response all play a role in causing lung damage in CF. Therefore, assessment of 
inflammatory mediators such as IRT and other biomarkers is included.  
LCI is a measure of ventilation inhomogeneity  that is based on tidal breathing techniques that 
have been evaluated in patients as young as infants.11, 12 Studies have shown that LCI correlates 
with FEV 1 in its ability to measure airway disease and can detect lung disease at an earlier stage 
Protocol VX19 -445-107, Versio n 2.0 Page 27 of 59 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  than spirometry.13, 14 Furthermore, data from Studies  VX10 -770-106 and VX14 -809-109 in CF 
patients with an FEV 1 >90% showed LCI to be a more  sensitive outcome measure than FEV 1.  
9.4 Study Restrictions  
9.4.1  Prohibited Medications  
Table  9-2 lists prohibited medications. A non -exhaustive list of study prohibitions and cautions 
for medication will be provided in the Study Reference Manual. Guidance for concomitant 
medications is p rovided in Section 9.5.

moderate and strong inducers of CYP3A and 
moderate and strong inhibitors of CYP3A, 
which have the potential to alter the exposure 
of VX -445, TEZ, or IVA, will be prohibited.  Moderate and strong

IVA: ivacaftor; TEZ:  tezacaftor  
a Ciprofloxacin is not a moderate CYP3A inhibitor on the basis of results of a drug -drug interaction study 
conducted with IVA, a sensitive CYP3A substrate (Kalydeco [ivacaftor] US Package Insert).  
9.5 Prior and Concomitant Medicatio ns 
Information regarding prior and concomitant medications, including CF medications, other 
medications, and herbal and naturopathic remedies,  will be collected in each subject’s source 
documentation for medications taken within the 56  days before the firs t dose of study drug in this 
study through completion of study participation, as defined in Section  9.1.5 . 
• Subjects should remain on a stable treat ment regimen for their CF through completion of 
study participation . Stable treatment regimen is defined as the current treatment regimen for 
CF that subjects have been following for at least 28  days before Part A Day 1. Subjects 
should not initiate long -term treatment with new medication from 28  days before the Part A 
Day 1 Visit through completion of study participation. Guidelines for stable treatment 
regimens for CF are as follows:  
Protocol VX19 -445-107, Versio n 2.0 Page 28 of 59 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  o Subjects who are taking inhaled tobramycin or other chronically inhaled antibiotics 
should remain on that regimen throughout the study.  
o Subjects who cycle onto and off of an inhaled antibiotic should continue on their prior 
schedule.  
o Subjects who alternate between 2 different inhaled antibiotics should remain on the 
same cycling schedule during the study.  
• Subjects may receive doses of prednisone or prednisolone of up to 10  mg/day chronically, or 
up to 60  mg daily for up to 5  days.  
• VX-445 may inhibit OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, which may increase the exposure of 
medicinal products  that are substrates for these transporters. Substrates such as statins, 
glyburide, nateglinide, and repaglinide should be used with caution.  
• IVA is a weak inhibitor of P -glycoprotein (P -gp). Administration of IVA may increase 
systemic exposure of medicin al products that are sensitive substrates of P -gp, which may 
increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. Digoxin or other substrates 
of P-gp with a narrow therapeutic index, such as cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus, and 
tacrolimu s, should be used with caution and appropriate monitoring.  
• IVA may inhibit CYP2C9; therefore, during coadministration with warfarin, additional 
monitoring of the international normalized ratio is recommended. Other medicinal products 
that are CYP2C9 subst rates for which exposure may be increased include glimepiride and 
glipizide; these should be used with caution.  
• Information about bronchodilator use during the study will be collected and documented. 
Subjects who are using a bronchodilator should have thei r spirometry assessments performed 
according to the guidelines provided in Section  11.3.1 . 
9.6 Administration  
9.6.1  Dosing  
Study drug will be administered orally. Additional  information is provided in the Pharmacy 
Manual.  
Study drug should be administered with a fat -containing meal or snack, such as a standard “CF” 
meal or snack or a standard meal . 
1. It is recommended that the dose be taken within 30  minutes of the start of the  meal or snack.  
2. Study drug will be administered as 2 fixed -dose combination  VX-445/TEZ/IVA tablets in the 
morning and as 1 IVA tablet in the evening. For each subject, doses of study drug should be 
taken at approximately the same time (±  2 hours) each day.  
3. On days of scheduled visits, the morning dose of VX -445/TEZ/IVA will be administered at 
the site after predose assessments have been completed. A meal or snack will be provided by 
the site for the morning dose of VX -445/TEZ/IVA.  
Protocol VX19 -445-107, Versio n 2.0 Page 29 of 59 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  4. If a subject ’s scheduled c linic visit is to occur in the afternoon, the following guidelines 
should be used:  
• If the dose in the clinic will be within 6  hours of the subject ’s scheduled morning dose, 
the subject should withhold their morning dose of VX -445/TEZ/IVA and the morning 
dose of VX -445/TEZ/IVA will be administered in the clinic.  
• If the dose in the clinic will be more than 6  hours after the subject’s scheduled morning 
dose of VX -445/TEZ/IVA , the subject should take the morning dose  of 
VX-445/TEZ/IVA  at home.  
5. Subjects will be instructed to bring all used and unused materials associated with the study 
drug to the site; study drug will be dispensed at each visit, as appropriate.  
9.6.2  Missed Doses  
If 6 hours or less have passed since the missed morning or evening dose, the subject shou ld take 
the missed dose as soon as possible and continue on the original schedule.  
Morning dose: If more than 6  hours have passed since the missed morning  dose, the subject 
should take the missed dose as soon as possible and should not take the evening do se. 
Evening dose:  If more than 6  hours have passed since the missed evening  dose, the subject 
should not take the missed dose. The next scheduled morning dose should be taken at the usual 
time.  
Morning and evening doses should not be taken at the same time . 
9.7 Dose Modification for Toxicity  
Modifications of the study drug dose are prohibited . Should any unacceptable toxicity arise, 
individual subjects will be withdrawn from the study and dosing will cease.  
9.8 Study Drug Interruption and Stopping Rules  
In subjects  who have interrupted study drug for >72 hours for any reason, the investigator should 
resume study drug only after a thorough investigation of the cause for interruption. The 
investigator will evaluate the subject’s clinical stability and should consider resumption of study 
drug only after the subject is clinically stable  and there is no comorbidity or condition that, in the 
opinion of the investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk in 
administering study drug to the su bject.  
The medical monitor should be notified of an interruption of study drug that lasts >72 hours for 
any reason and of the resumption of study drug after such interruption. In subjects for whom 
study drug was previously interrupted, the medical monitor should be notified of any plan to 
discontinue study drug, before the discontinuation has occurred, if possible.  
9.8.1  Liver Function Tests  
The central laboratory will notify the medical monitor of alanine transaminase (ALT) or 
aspartate transaminase (AST) >3  × upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin >2  × ULN 
that are derived from centrally submitted samples.  
Subjects with new treatment -emergent ALT or AST elevations of >3  × ULN, with or without 
total bilirubin >2  × ULN, must be followed closely, including  confirmatory testing performed by 
Protocol VX19 -445-107, Versio n 2.0 Page 30 of 59 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  the central laboratory within 48  to 72  hours of the initial finding and subsequent close 
monitoring of ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels, as clinically indicated.  
If a subject cannot return to the site for confirmatory testing, a local laboratory may be used. 
Local laboratory results must be reported immediately to the medical monitor, and the subject 
must have the tests repeated and sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible (ideally within 
48 to 72  hours).  
Study drug administration must be interrupted  immediately (prior to confirmatory testing) if 
any of the following criteria are met:  
• ALT or AST >8  × ULN  
• ALT or AST >5  × ULN for more than 2  weeks  
• ALT or AST >3  × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2  × ULN and/or clinical jaundice  
A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject should be 
followed closely for clinical progression.  
Study drug administration must be discontinued  if the following criteria are met:  
• Subsequent ALT  or AST values confirm the initial elevation that satisfied the interruption 
rule (above), and no convincing alternative etiology (e.g.,  acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, 
alcohol ingestion) is identified, regardless of whether transaminase levels have im proved  
All subjects in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated transaminases (and bilirubin, as 
applicable) should have these levels monitored closely until levels normalize or return to 
baseline.  
If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase ele vation with or without increased bilirubin or 
clinical jaundice has been identified , study drug administration may be resumed once 
transaminase levels return to baseline or are ≤2  × ULN, whichever is higher. Regardless of the 
duration of interruption, the medical monitor should be notified before resumption of study drug. 
Upon resumption of study drug, transaminases and bilirubin should be assessed weekly for 
4 weeks. If a protocol -defined transaminase elevation interruption threshold recurs within 
4 weeks of rechallenge with the study drug (with confirmation of the initial elevation by repeat 
testing within 48  to 72  hours), then the study drug must be permanently discontinued, regardless 
of the presumed etiology.  
9.8.2  Rash  
Individuals who develop a generalized r ash will be monitored closely. Study drug dosing should 
be interrupted if a subject develops a generalized rash of Grade 3 or higher (Section  13.1.1.4 ), or 
a rash that is considered a serious adverse event (SAE). The investigator will notify the medical 
monitor of any rash that results in interruption of study drug, is Grade  3 or higher, or is an SAE. 
Investigators should consider additional evaluatio n including laboratory testing (e.g., complete 
blood count with differential, liver function tests), photographs of the rash, and dermatology 
consultation. The investigator may consider resumption of study drug if considered clinically 
appropriate.  
Protocol VX19 -445-107, Versio n 2.0 Page 31 of 59 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  9.9 Removal  of Subjects  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request. Subjects may be 
withdrawn from study drug treatment at any time at the discretion of the investigator or Vertex 
for safety, behavior, noncompliance with study procedures, or administrative reasons.  
In addition, a subject must be discontinued from study drug treatment if the subject meets any of 
the following criteria:  
• Meets any of the stopping (discontinuation) criteria (Section  9.8) 
• Becomes pregnant (Section  11.5.6.2 ) 
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, reasonable  effort will be made to contact the 
subject. In any circumstance, reasonable effort will be made to document subject outcome. The 
investigator will inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all 
unused investigational product( s), request that the subject return for an ETT Visit and Safety 
Follow -up Visit, if applicable (see Section  9.1.2 ), and follow  up with the subject regarding any 
unresolved AEs.  
If the subject withdraws consent or assent for the study, no further assessments will be 
performed. Vertex may retain and continue using the study data and samples after the study is 
over, and may use the samples and information in the develo pment of the study compounds, and 
for other drugs and diagnostics, in publications and presentations, and for education purposes. If 
the subject withdraws from the study, the study data and samples collected will remain part of 
the study. A subject will no t be able to request the withdrawal of his or her information from the 
study data. A subject may request destruction of the samples collected from him or her during 
the study as long as those samples can be identified as his or her samples.  
9.10 Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn during the study drug Treatment Period will not be 
replaced.

10.4 Drug Accountability  
The pharmacist or designated study site staff will maintain information about the dates and 
amounts of (1) study drug received; (2) study drug dispensed to the subjects; and (3) study drug 
returned by the sub jects. Subjects will be instructed to return all used and unused materials 
associated with the study drug to the site. These materials will be retained at the site according to 
instructions provided by Vertex or its designee. The study monitor will review study drug 
records and inventory throughout the study. If a site uses a site -specific drug accountability 
system and/or process, including processes associated with the destruction of returned materials, 
the process must be documented and approved by Verte x. The study monitor must review the 
drug accountability documentation on a regular basis. The study monitor will promptly 
communicate to Vertex any discrepancies he or she is unable to resolve with the site.  
10.5 Disposal, Return, or Retention of Unused Drug  
The study site staff or pharmacy personnel will retain all materials returned by the subjects until 
the study monitor has performed drug accountability. The investigator will ensure that the 
materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environment al regulations, institutional 
policy, and any special instructions provided by Vertex. Destruction will be adequately 
documented.  
10.6 Compliance  
To ensure treatment compliance, the investigator or designee will supervise all study drug dosing 
that occurs at t he site. At each visit, site personnel will review that the subject is compliant with 
study drug dosing and remind the subject of study drug dosing requirements. Compliance will 
also be assessed by ongoing study drug count.  
If a subject demonstrates contin ued noncompliance of study drug dosing despite educational 
efforts, the investigator should consider discontinuing the subject from the study.   
10.7 Blinding and Unblinding  
This will be an open -label study; however, subjects and their legally appointed and aut horized 
representative (e.g., parent or legal guardian) should not be informed of their study -related 
spirometry and LCI, SwCl, FE -1, and IRT results until the study has been completed, regardless 
if the subject permanently discontinues treatment. In addit ion, the Vertex study team will not

the parent study.  
11 ASSESSMENTS  
The schedule of assessments is shown in Table 3-1 and Table  3-2. 
11.1 Subject and Disease Characteristics  
Subject and disease characteristics include the follo wing: demographics, medical history, height, 
and weight . Select demographic and medical history will  be derived from the parent study.  
11.2 Pharmacokinetics  
Not applicable.  
11.3 Efficacy and Pharmacodynamics  
11.3.1  Spirometry  
Spirometry will be performed according to the American Thoracic Society Guidelines15 and 
according to the additional guidelines that follow.  
Pre-bronchodilator spirometry is defined as spirometry testing performed for subjects wh o have  
• withheld their short -acting bronchodilators (e.g.,  albuterol) or anticholinergic 
(e.g.,  ipratropium bromide [Atrovent®]) for more than 4  hours before the spirometry 
assessment;  
• withheld their long -acting bronchodilator (e.g.,  salmeterol) for more th an 12  hours before the 
spirometry assessment; and  
• withheld their once -daily, long -acting bronchodilator (e.g.,  tiotropium bromide [Spiriva®]) 
for more than 24  hours before the spirometry assessment.  
At all visits, all spirometry assessments should be perfo rmed pre -bronchodilator. During the 
Treatment Period s, spirometry assessments must be performed before study drug dosing 
(Section  9.6.1 ) at approximately the same time at each visit. In the event that a subject forgets to 
withhold bronchodilator(s), spirometry should be performed according to the following:  
• If a subject’s Part A Day  1 spirometry assessment is pre -bronchodilator, but, on a subsequent 
visit, the subje ct forgets to withhold bronchodilator use, a post -bronchodilator spirometry 
assessment will be obtained for that visit only, and the visit will not be rescheduled.  
• If, on Part A Day  1, the subject forgets to withhold his or her dose of bronchodilator, 
spirometry should be performed post -bronchodilator, and all subsequent spirometric 
measurements (according to the schedule of assessments) should be performed 
post-bronchodilator.  
• Each spirometry assessment will be recorded in the source documents as pre - or 
post-bronchodilator.  
All sites will be provided with spirometers to be used for all study assessments. Spirometry data 
will be transmitted to a centralized spirometry service for quality review.  
See Section  10.7 for information about access to spirometry results.  
Protocol VX19 -445-107, Versio n 2.0 Page 34 of 59 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  The measured spirometric values listed below will be converted to percent predicted values using 
the standard equations of Global Lung Function In itiative (GLI).16  
• FEV 1 (L) 
• Forced  vital capacity (FVC) (L)  
• FEV 1/FVC (ratio)  
• Forced expiratory flow, midexpiratory phase (FEF 25%-75%) (L/s)  
11.3.2  Sweat Chloride  
The SwCl test is a standard diagnostic tool for CF, serving as a biomarker of CFTR activity. 
Sweat samples will be sent to a central la boratory for testing and interpretation of results. 
Individual SwCl test results will not be disclosed to the study sites. Specific instructions for 
collection, handling, processing, and shipping of SwCl samples to the central laboratory will be 
provided s eparately. The SwCl test must be conducted predose relative to the morning dose of 
study drug during the Treatment Period s. At each time point, 2 samples will be collected, 
1 sample from each arm (left and right).  
See Section  10.7 for information about access to SwCl results.  
11.3.3  Multiple Breath Washout  
The N 2-MBW testing will be performed in multiple replicates for each visit and the final LCI 
value will be calculated from t he technically acceptable washout replicates by a central reader. 
The final LCI value at each visit will be the value provided by the LCI vendor based on the 
replicates.  
At all visits, MBW tests should be performed “pre -bronchodilator” as described in 
Section 11.3.1 . The MBW test should be performed before the spirometry assessment. See 
Section  10.7 for information about access to LCI results . 
Detailed MBW procedures will be supplied separately in a Study Reference Manual.  
11.3.4  Height  and Weight  
Height and weight will be measured with shoes off and before the dose of the study drug at each 
clinic visit during the Treatment Period s. 
11.3.5  Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire -Revised  
The questionnaires provide information about demographics; general quality of life, school, 
work, or daily activities; and symptom difficulties (pertaining to CF).  
Subjec ts/caregivers will be asked to complete the CFQ -R in their native language, if validated 
translations are available.17, 18 If there is no validated translation available in the subject’s native 
language, the subject will not complete the questionnaire. Copies of the CFQ -R used will be 
provided in the Study Re ference Manual. Validated translations of the CFQ -R, if available, will 
be provided for participating centers with non -English -speaking populations.19, 20 
The CFQ -R will be completed before any o ther assessments are performed at that visit.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  11.3.6  Other Events Related to Outcome  
11.3.6.1  Antibiotic Therapy for Sinopulmonary Sign/Symptoms  
New or changed antibiotic therapy (intravenous [IV], inhaled, or oral) for the following 
sinopulmonary signs/symptoms will be determined and documented at visits as indicated in 
Table 3-1 and Table  3-2: 
• Change in sputum  
• New or increased hemoptysis  
• Increased cough  
• Increased dyspnea  
• Malaise, f atigue, or lethargy

For this study, PEx is defined as a new or change in antibiotic therapy (IV, inhaled, or oral) 
for any 4  or more of the above signs/symptoms.  This definition is based on the definition of a 
PEx used in previous cli nical studies, including IVA clinical studies.21, 22  
It is recommended that the study drug not be interrupted during a PEx  unless, in the opinion of 
the investigator, it would be in the best interest of the subject.  
11.3.6.2  Hospitalization for CF  
Subjects will be queried about planned and unplanned hospitalizations lasting ≥24  hours that 
occurred during the study. The dates of hospit alizations and the reasons for hospitalizations will 
be documented.  
For any hospitalization (planned and unplanned), the procedures for safety reporting should also 
be followed.  
11.4 Other Assessments  
These data will be used for internal exploratory purposes an d may or may not be included in the 
clinical study report (CSR). Detailed procedures for the collection of blood samples will be 
provided in a separate document.  
11.4.1  FE-1 and IRT  
Assessments of FE -1 and IRT will be conducted to assess exocrine pancreatic funct ion. 
Protocol VX19 -445-107, Versio n 2.0 Page 36 of 59 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  Fecal samples for assessment of FE -1 will be collected at the study center during the study visit; 
alternatively samples may be collected by the subject’s caregiver up to 24  hours before the study 
visit (e.g., at home) and brought to the study visit. The sample may be collected pre - or postdose.  
See Section  10.7 for information about access to FE -1 and IRT results.  
11.4.2  Blood Biomarkers  
Blood samples for blood biomarker a nalysis will be collected and banked for potential 
exploratory evaluation of correlations between blood biomarkers (e.g.,  proteins, peptides, lipids, 
vitamins, endogenous metabolites, and RNA) with PD, treatment benefit, and AEs.  
Specific instructions for  the collection, processing, storage, and shipment of blood biomarker 
samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
11.5 Safety  
Safety evaluations will include reporting of AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, PEs, clinical 
evaluation of vital signs, puls e oximetry, standard 12 -lead ECGs, and ophthalmologic 
examinations.  
11.5.1  Adverse Events  
All AEs will be assessed, documented, and reported in accordance with ICH  GCP Guidelines. 
Section  13.1 outlines the definitions, collection periods, criteria, and procedures for 
documenting, grading, and reporting AEs. Electronic AE case report form (CRF) completion 
guidelines for investigators as well as training will be provided.  
11.5.2  Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
Blood and urine samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory with the exception of urine 
pregnancy tests, which will be analyzed locally. All blood samples will be collected while 
subjects are in a seated or supine position. Specific instructions for the collection, processing, 
and shipment of samples will be provided in a separate Laboratory Manual. Laboratory test 
results that are abnormal and considered clinically significant must be reported as AEs (see

b If blood urea nitrogen cannot be collected, urea may be substituted.  
Pregnancy (β -human chorionic gonadotropin) Tests for all Female Subjects : All female subjects 
must have a pregnancy test every 4  weeks. Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at the study 
site and analyzed at the central laboratory. Urine pregnancy tests will be perf ormed and analyzed 
at the site or, at assessment time points when telephone contact takes the place of a clinic visit, at 
home by using a home kit provided by the study site . Results of a home urine pregnancy test will 
be reported to the site by telephon e. Additional pregnancy tests may be required according to 
local regulations and/or requirements.  
Additional Evaluations : Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other 
times if judged by the investigator to be clinically appropriate .  
For the purposes of study conduct and unless noted otherwise, only laboratory tests done in the 
central laboratory may be used. Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local 
investigator for management of urgent medical issues. If a loca l laboratory test value is found to 
be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by the central laboratory as soon as 
possible after the investigator becomes aware of the abnormal result. If it is not possible to send a 
timely specimen to th e central laboratory (e.g.,  the subject was hospitalized elsewhere), the 
investigator may base the assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value.  
Protocol VX19 -445-107, Versio n 2.0 Page 38 of 59 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  11.5.3  Physical Examinations and Vital Signs  
A PE of all body systems and vital signs assessment will be performe d at select study visits. At 
other visits, symptom -directed PEs and symptom -directed vital signs assessments can be 
performed at the discretion of the investigator or healthcare provider . 
A PE includes a review of the following systems: head, neck, and thy roid; eyes, ears, nose, and 
throat; respiratory; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and 
neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically 
indicated. Any clinically significant abnormal find ings in PEs will be reported as AEs.  
Weight, height, and BMI (derived) will also be assessed ( Section  11.3.4 ). 
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature, pulse rate, and 
respiration rate. These will be assessed following at least a 5 -minute rest in the seated or supine 
position.  
Arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry will be assessed following at least a 5 -minute  rest 
and before study drug dosing. At visits when study drug is taken at the site, pulse oximetry will 
be collected before study drug dosing.  
11.5.4  Electrocardiograms  
Standard 12 -lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout. Additional standard 
12-lead ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated. The performance of all 
ECGs will adhere to the following guidelines:  
• The ECG will be done before any other procedures that may affect heart rate, such as blood 
draws.  
• The subject will b e instructed to rest for at least 5  minutes before having an ECG.  
A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by the investigator and maintained 
with source documentation. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study 
through completion of study participation  will be recorded as AEs.   
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make comparisons to 
baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >60  msec from the baseline or an abso lute 
QTcF value is ≥500  msec for any scheduled ECG, 2  additional ECGs will be performed 
approximately 2  to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either of the QTcF 
values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value (>60  msec from baseline or 
≥500  msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from 2  successive 
ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement. A subject with a 
QTcF value above the threshold value will discontin ue dosing.  
11.5.5  Ophthalmologic  Examination  
Ophthalmologic examinations  do not need to be completed if there is documentation of bilateral 
lens removal for the subject.  
Protocol VX19 -445-107, Versio n 2.0 Page 39 of 59 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  All examinations will be conducted by a licensed ophthalmologist or optometrist and will 
include:  
• measurement of best -corrected distance visual acuity of each eye; and  
• pharmacologically dilated examination of the lens with a slit lamp.  
Ophthalmologic examinations are required at select study visits in the Treatment Period s (Table 
3-1 and Table  3-2). These examinations should be completed within 4  weeks of the relevant 
study visit. An ophthalmologic examination is also required at the ETT Visit for subjects whose 
cumulative VX-445/TEZ/IVA exposure (in the parent study and current study) is at least 
12 weeks since  the last study ophthalmologic examination.  
Any clinically significant abnormal findings will be reported as AEs.  
11.5.6  Contraception and Pregnancy  
The effects of VX -445 monotherapy or in TC with TEZ and IVA on conception, pregnancy, and 
lactation  in humans are not known. VX -445, TEZ, and IVA did not show genotoxic potential in a 
standard battery of in vitro (Ames test, chromosomal aberration, or micronucleus in cultured 
mammalian cells) and in vivo (rodent micronucleus) studies. Reproductive toxic ology studies of 
VX-445, TEZ, and IVA have not shown teratogenicity in rats and rabbits.  
11.5.6.1  Contraception  
Contraception requirement for a couple is waived for the following:  
• True abstinence for the subject, when this is in line with the preferred and usual li festyle of 
the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. True abstinence must 
be practiced from the date of informed consent through 90  days af ter the last dose of study 
drug.  
• If the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy). If a male subject is assumed to have 
complete bilateral absence of the vas deferens, infertility must be documented before the first 
dose of study drug (e.g., examinat ion of a semen specimen or by demonstration of the 
absence of the vas deferens by ultrasound).  
• If the female is of non -childbearing potential. To be considered of non -childbearing potential, 
the female must meet at least 1 of the following criteria:  
o Postme nopausal: Amenorrheic for at least 12  consecutive months and a serum 
follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level within the laboratory’s reference range for 
postmenopausal females  
o Documented hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy/salpingo -oophorectomy  
Note: A ll other females (including females with tubal ligations) will be considered to be 
of childbearing potential.  
• Same -sex relationships  
For subjects for whom the contraception requirement is not waived, study participation 
requires a commitment from the subje ct that at least 1 acceptable method  of contraception is 
used as a couple.  Methods of contraception must be in successful use from signing of consent (or 
Protocol VX19 -445-107, Versio n 2.0 Page 40 of 59 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  assent, when applicable), approximately 28  days before the first dose of study drug (unless 
otherwise noted), and until 90  days following the last dose of study drug. Additional 
contraception requirements may need to be followed according to local regulations and/or 
requirements. Acceptable methods of contraception are listed in Table  11-2.

Additional notes:  
• If over the course of the study the subject meets the criteria for waiving the contraception 
requirements, the subject does not need to follow the contraceptive m ethods listed in 
Table  11-2. 
• If over the course of the study the subject’s status changes and the subject does not meet the 
criteria for waiving the co ntraception requirements, the subject must begin following the 
contraceptive methods listed in Table  11-2.  
• Male subjects must not donate sperm during the period starting from the first dose of study 
drug until 90 days after the last dose of study drug.  
• Female subjects should not nurse a child during the period starting from the first dose of 
study drug until 90  days after the last dose of study drug.  
• For male subjects with a female partner of childbearing potential, the couple should not plan 
to become pregnant during the study or within 90  days after the last dose of study drug, with 
the exception of couples who plan to become pregnant by artificial ins emination using sperm 
banked by the male subject before the first dose of study drug or sperm from another source . 
11.5.6.2  Pregnancy  
Subjects will be counseled to inform the investigator of any pregnancy that occurs during study 
treatment and for 90  days after the  last dose of study drug.  
Protocol VX19 -445-107, Versio n 2.0 Page 41 of 59 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  If a subject, or the female partner of a male subject, becomes pregnant during study participation, 
study drug will be permanently discontinued immediately. The investigator will 1) notify the 
medical monitor and Vertex Global Pat ient Safety (GPS) within 24  hours of the site’s knowledge 
of the subject’s (or partner’s) pregnancy, and 2) send the Pregnancy Information Collection Form 
to Vertex GPS. Male subjects with female partners who become pregnant during the study must 
use a mal e condom to avoid exposure of a potential embryo or fetus to study drug via the seminal 
fluid.  
Provided informed consent is obtained, the subject or partner will be followed until the end of 
the pregnancy and the infant will be followed for 1  year after t he birth. A separate ICF will be 
provided to explain these follow -up activities. Pregnancy itself does not constitute an AE.  
12 STATISTICAL AND ANAL YTICAL PLANS  
This section presents a summary of the planned analyses for this protocol. Statistical analysis 
details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be finalized before the 
clinical data lock for the study.  
12.1 Sample Size  
The primary and secondary objectives of the study are the evaluation of the long -term safety, 
tolerability, an d efficacy of VX -445/TEZ/IVA. This is an open -label study that will enroll 
subjects who complete study treatment in the parent study and meet eligibility criteria. 
Approximately 56 subjects are expected to enroll in this open -label study.  
12.2 Analysis Sets  
The following analysis sets will be defined for Part A and Part B separately:  
The Open -label All Subjects Set  for Part A or B is defined as all subjects who were enrolled 
(defined as subject having data in the corresponding clinical database) in the corresponding Part. 
This analysis set will be used for individual subject data listings and disposition summary tab les 
unless otherwise specified.  
The Open -label Full Analysis Set (OL -FAS)  for Part A or B is defined as all enrolled subjects 
who have received at least 1  dose of study drug in the corresponding Part. The OL -FAS will be 
used to summarize subject demographi cs and baseline characteristics and for all efficacy 
analyses unless otherwise specified.  
The Open -label  Safety Set (OL -SS) for Part A or B is defined as all subjects who have received 
at least 1  dose of study drug in the corresponding Part. The OL -SS will  be used for all safety 
analyses unless otherwise specified.  
12.3 Statistical Analysis  
12.3.1  General Considerations  
Continuous variables  will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: 
the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimum value  (min), and maximum value 
(max). The precision of the measurement for each continuous variable will be specified in the 
SAP. Unless otherwise specified, min and max values will be reported with the same precision as 
the units of the raw data. The mean, med ian, and SD will be reported to 1  additional decimal 
Protocol VX19 -445-107, Versio n 2.0 Page 42 of 59 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  place. Any values that require a transformation to standard units (metric or SI) will be converted 
with the appropriate precision.  
Categorical variables  will be summarized using counts and percentages. P ercentages will be 
presented to 1  decimal place.  
The baseline value , unless otherwise specified, will be the most recent non -missing 
measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study drug in the 
parent study. For assessments c ollected in replicates, the baseline will be defined as the average 
of non -missing values.  
Change (absolute change)  from baseline will be calculated as post -baseline value  – baseline 
value.  
The Efficacy Analysis Period  for each Part will include the time f rom the first dose of study 
drug to the last scheduled efficacy visit in the corresponding Part, unless otherwise specified.  
The Treatment -emergent (TE) Period  for each Part will include the time from the first dose of 
study drug to 28  days after the last dose of the study drug or to the date of completion of study 
participation in the corresponding Part (as defined in Section  9.1.5 ), whichever occurs first.  
Part A and Part B data will be analyzed separately, using the respective analysis set, efficacy 
analysis period, and TE period for each Part. For analysis of the number of PEx, events in the 
parent study and this study (Parts A and B, as appl icable) may also be combined.  
12.3.2  Background Characteristics  
12.3.2.1  Subject Disposition  
Subject disposition will be summarized separately for each Part for the Open -label All Subjects 
Set. The number and percentage of subjects in the following categories will be summ arized as 
appropriate:  
• Open -label All Subjects Set  
• Dosed (OL -SS) 
• Enrolled and dosed (OL -FAS)  
• Completed treatment  
• Prematurely discontinued treatment and the reasons for discontinuation  
• Completed study  
• Prematurely discontinued the study and the reasons for discontinuation  
12.3.2.2  Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized separately for each Part by 
descriptive summary statistics. Baseline characteristics will be the same as the parent study 
baseline charac teristics.  
The following demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized for the OL -FAS 
and will include (but are not limited to) sex, race, ethnicity, baseline age, baseline weight, 
baseline height, baseline BMI, baseline ppFEV 1, baseline SwC l, and baseline CFQ -R RD score.  
Protocol VX19 -445-107, Versio n 2.0 Page 43 of 59 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  Medical history will be summarized by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred 
Term (PT) for the OL -FAS.  
12.3.2.3  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications will be coded using WHODrug and categorized as follows:  
• Prior medica tion:  any medication that was administered within the 56  days before the first 
dose of study drug in each Part  
• Concomitant medication:  medication continued or newly received during the TE Period in 
each Part  
• Post-treatment medication:  medication continued or newly received after the TE  Period in 
each Part  
A given medication may be classified as a prior medication, a concomitant medication, or a 
post-treatment medication; both prior and concomitant; both concomitant and post -treatment; or 
prior, concomitant, and post -treatment. If a medication has a missing or partially missing 
start/end date or time and if it cannot be determined whether it was taken before initial dosing, 
concomitantly during the TE Period, or beyond the TE Period, it will be considered in all 
3 categories of prior, concomitant, and post -treatment medication.  
Prior medications and concomitant medications will be summarized descriptively by Preferred 
Name based on the OL -FAS, separately for each Part. Post -treatment medi cations will be 
provided separately in an individual subject data listing.  
12.3.2.4  Study Drug Exposure and Compliance  
Study drug exposure will be summarized separately for each Part based on the OL -SS, defined as 
the last day of study drug in each Part  minus the f irst day  of study drug in each Part plus  1, 
regardless of study drug interruption.  
Study drug compliance will be summarized based on the OL -FAS, and will be calculated as: 
100  [1 – (total number of days of study drug interruption in each Part) / (duratio n of study drug 
exposure in days in each Part)]. A study drug interruption on a given day is defined as an 
interruption of any study drug on that day.  
In addition, percentage of tablets taken will also be summarized based on the OL -FAS, and will 
be calcula ted as: 100  [(total number of tablets dispensed in each part) – (total number of tablets 
returned in each Part)] / (total number of tablets planned to be taken per day  duration of study 
drug exposure in days for each Part).  
12.3.2.5  Important Protocol Deviation s 
An important protocol deviation (IPD) is a deviation that may significantly affect the 
completeness, accuracy, or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a subject’s 
rights, safety, or wellbeing. The rules for identifying an IPD wi ll be described in the SAP.  
All IPDs will be provided in an individual subject  data listing, and summarized, as appropriate.  
12.3.3  Efficacy and Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
The secondary objective of the study is the evaluation of the long -term efficacy and PD of

13 PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL,  REGULATO RY, AND ADMINISTRATI VE 
CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity 
Grading, and Reporting  
13.1.1  Adverse Events  
13.1.1.1  Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly 
occurring event or worsening of a pre -existing condition (e.g.,  increas e in its severity or 
frequency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section  13.1.2.1 .  
13.1.1.2  Clinically Si gnificant Assessments  
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and 
those deemed to have clinically significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an 
AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the  study assessment will be provided, rather than the 
abnormal test result alone (e.g.,  urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, 
the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g.,  bacteria in urine or decreased 
hemog lobin).  
Protocol VX19 -445-107, Versio n 2.0 Page 48 of 59 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1  or more of 
the following:  
• Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment  
• Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  
• A ch ange in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study  
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whethe r the 
study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by the investigator.  
A laboratory value that is Grade 4 will not automatically be an SAE. A Grade 4  laboratory value 
will be an SAE if the subject’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE.  
13.1.1.3  Documentation of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be collected from the time the ICF is signed until the completion of study 
participation (Section 9.1.5 ). 
All subjects’ parents or legal guardians will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the 
occurrence of AEs at each study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptom s 
will be identified as 1  overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded 
in the CRF and source document. The following  data will be documented for each AE:  
• Description of the event  
• Classification of “serious” or “nonserious”  
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable)  
• Severity  
• Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
• Action taken  
• Outcome  
• Concomitant medication or other treatment given  
13.1.1.4  Adverse Event Severity  
The investigator will determine and record the severi ty of all serious and nonserious AEs. The 
guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version  5.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed 
February  2019 ). AEs of CTCAE Grades  4 and 5 will be documented as “life -threatening.” When 
considering the severity of an AE in  a pediatric subject, the investigator will consider that 
reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those in the 
CTCAE. The severity of an AE described by a term that does not appear in the CTCAE will be 
determined accor ding to the definitions in Table  13-1. 
Protocol VX19 -445-107, Versio n 2.0 Page 49 of 59 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  Table  13-1 Grading of AE Severity  
Classification  Definition  
Mild (Grade  1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities  
Moderate (Grade  2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities  
Severe (Grade  3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities  
Life-threatening 
(Grade  4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death  
AE: adverse event  
13.1.1.5  Adverse Event  Causality  
Every effort will be made by the investigator to assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the 
study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories in Table  13-2. 
Table  13-2 Classifications for AE Causality  
Classification  Definition  
Related  There is an association between the event and the administration of investigational 
study drug, a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the investigational 
study drug and causes other than the investigational study drug have been ruled out, 
and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug.  
Possibly related  Ther e is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, 
such as characteristics  of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the subject’s medical record).  
AE: adverse event  
13.1.1.6  Study Drug Action Taken  
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to th e AE. The action taken 
will be classified according to the categories in Table  13-3.  
Table  13-3 Classif ications for Study Drug Action Taken With Regard to an AE  
Classificationa Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be u sed in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
AE: adverse event  
a Refer to Sections 9.7 and 9.8 for directions regarding what drug actions are permitted per protocol.  
Protocol VX19 -445-107, Versio n 2.0 Page 50 of 59 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  13.1.1.7  Adverse Event Outcome  
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories in Table  13-4. 
Table  13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE  
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms  
Recovered/resolved with 
sequelae  Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not recovered/not 
resolved (continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing  
Fatal  Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when de ath is at least possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g.,  a subject lost to follow -up) 
AE: adverse event  
13.1.1.8  Treatment Given  
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will 
describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given 
in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, surgery, or physical 
therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE.  
13.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
13.1.2.1  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  
• Fatal (death, regardless of ca use, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after 
participation and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study 
drug)  
• Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption 
of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• Congenital anomaly or bi rth defect  
• Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent  1 of the outcomes listed 
above (e.g.,  an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treat ment in an emergency room or 
at home)  
If a subject has a hospitalization or procedure (e.g.,  surgery) for an event or condition that 
occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospitalization or procedure was planned 
before the subject signed the  ICF, the hospitalization or procedure will not be considered to 
Protocol VX19 -445-107, Versio n 2.0 Page 51 of 59 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  indicate an SAE, unless an AE caused the hospitalization or procedure to be rescheduled sooner 
or to be prolonged relative to what was planned. In addition, hospitalizations clearly not 
assoc iated with an AE (e.g.,  social hospitalization for purposes of respite care) will not be 
considered to indicate an SAE.  
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be 
of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as 
“serious”, which is  based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not 
severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations.   
13.1.2.2  Reporting and Documentation of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through the 
Safety Follow -up Visit, regardless of causality, will be reported by the investigator to Vertex 
GPS within 2 4 hours of identification . In addition, all SAEs that occur after the Safety 
Follow -up Visit and are considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS 
within 24  hours of identification .  
For SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent  and assent (where applicable) through the 
Safety Follow -up Visit, the SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well as to 
report follow -up information on previously reported events. Investigators are asked to report 
follow -up information as so on as it becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health 
authorities.  
Please send completed SAE Forms to Vertex GPS via:  
Email: globalpatientsafety@vrtx.com  (preferred choice)  
Fax: +1 -617-341-6159   
For technical issues related to submitting the form, contact telephone: +1 -617-341-6677  
SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow -up Visit and are considered related to study drug(s)  will 
be recorded on the Vertex Clinical Trial Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred 
to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the 
event. SAEs will be assessed by the investigator for relat ionship to the investigational study 
drug(s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be assessed 
only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity 
assessment will not b e required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved 
at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of 
regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to reso lution and 
report the outcome to Vertex using the SAE Form.  
13.1.2.3  Expedited Reporting and Investigator Safety Letters  
Vertex, as study sponsor, is responsible for reporting suspected, unexpected, serious adverse 
reactions (SUSARs) involving the study drug(s) to all regulatory authorities, IECs, and

committee, and/or the publication committee will work together to develop a publication plan.  
Authorship : Authorship of publications will be determined based on the Recommendations for 
Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in  Medical Journals, which 
states that authorship should be based on the following 4 criteria24: 
1. Substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and 
interpretation of data;  
2. Drafting of the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content;  
3. Final approval of the version to be published; and  
4. Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related 
to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and 
resolved.  
All authors must meet conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4. All persons designated as authors should qualify 
for authorship, and all those who qualify should be listed. Contributions such as medical writing, 
enrollment of subjects, acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the 
research group, alone, do not justify authorship.  
Contributors : Contributors who meet fewer than all 4 of International Committee of Medical 
Journal Editors criteria for authorship will not be listed as authors, but their contribution will be 
acknowledged and specified either as a group (e.g., “study investigators”) or individually (e.g., 
“served as scientific advisor”).  
Publication Review : As required by a separate clinical study agreement, Vertex must have the 
oppo rtunity to review all publications, including any manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide 
presentations, and book chapters regarding this study before submission to congresses or journals 
for consideration.  
13.7.2  Clinical Study Report  
A CSR, written in accordance with the ICH E3 Guideline, will be submitted in accordance with 
local regulations.

Abstract
Objectives:
Primary
To determine the response rate (RR) for patients with Kirsten r at sarcoma (KRAS) 
wild-type locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the small bowel or ampulla 
of Vater treated with panitumumab.
Secondary 
1)  To determine the overall progression-free survival (PFS) fo r panitumumab.
2)  To determine overall PFS for panitumumab in the subset of p atients with metastatic 
disease only.3)  To determine the overall survival (OS) panitumumab.4)  To determine the OS for panitumumab in the subset of patien ts with metastatic 
disease only.5)  To determine the toxicity of panitumumab.
Rationale: (Be as concise as possible)
Adenocarcinoma of the small bowel is a rare cancer that has man y molecular, genetic, 
and epidemiological similarities with adenocarcinoma of the lar ge bowel.  In particular 
both cancers demonstrate an identical frequency and pattern of mutations in the KRAS 
oncogene.  The use of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (an ti-EGFR) antibodies, 
such as panitumumab, has demonstrated clear anti-cancer activit y in the treatment of

adenocarcinoma of the colorectum.  Recently, the benefit with a nti-EGFR therapy in the 
treatment of colorectal adenocarcinoma has been shown to be lim ited to the subset of 
patients who have a wild-type KRAS gene.  Given the similaritie s between 
adenocarcinoma of the small and large bowel, we feel that the l ack of activity of 
panitumumab in mutant KRAS colorectal cancer patients, supports  the selection of only 
small bowel adenocarcinoma patients with a wild-type KRAS oncog ene for treatment 
with CAPOX and panitumumab.  Thus, the selection of only wild-t ype KRAS patients will 
serve as a molecular enrichment of patients who have the greate st chance of benefit 
from the addition of panitumumab to CAPOX chemotherapy.
Based upon retrospective studies and two prospective studies th at have been conducted 
in this tumor type, the general combination of a fluorinated py rimidine and a platinum 
compound such as CAPOX or FOLFOX represents the current standar d of care 
approach for adenocarcinoma of the small bowel and ampulla of V ater.    
 
We have recently completed a phase II study of capecitabine com bined with oxaliplatin, 
CAPOX, in the treatment of SBA and AAC. This single institution  study conducted at 
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center enrolled 31 patients with metastati c or unresectable 
disease.  The overall response rate was 52%.  The combination of CAPOX chemotherapy with the anti-EGFR antibo dy cetuximab has 
been explored in two phase II studies.  Panitumumab is an anti- EGFR monoclonal 
antibody of the IgG2 isotype that was approved by the US Food a nd Drug Administration 
(FDA) in September of 2006 for the treatment of EGFR-expressing  colorectal cancers 
with disease progression on or following fluoropyrimidine-, oxa liplatin-, and irinotecan-
containing chemotherapy regimens.   
 Thus, given these known facts, we hypothesize that the addition  of panitumumab to 
CAPOX chemotherapy in KRAS wild-type patients will result in im proved anti-cancer 
activity and improved outcomes for patients with unresectable o r metastatic  
adenocarcinoma of the small bowel and ampulla of Vater.  We now  propose a study to 
test this hypothesis by evaluating the addition of panitumumab to the standard of care 
chemotherapy treatment, CAPOX, for locally advanced or metastat ic Small bowel 
adenocarcinoma (SBA) and ampullary adenocarcinoma (AAC).

Updated Background Data on Anti-EGFR Therapy Combined with Oxal iplatin and Rationale 
for Study Design Change as of October 1, 2012. 
 
Since the initiation of this study further results regarding th e combination of oxaliplatin and 
capecitabine therapy and anti-EGFR therapy have been presented and published in both 
metastatic colorectal cancer and metastatic esophagogastric can cer.  The overall 
summation of this data is that anti-EGFR therapy when combined with capecitabine and 
oxaliplatin has not provided any added benefit.  Anti-EGFR in c ombination with other 
chemotherapy and as a single-agent has shown marked activity in  colorectal cancer and 
thus it appears that an antagonistic interaction between oxalip latin and capecitabine and 
anti-EGFR therapy may be occurring.  We are thus providing an a mendment to alter this 
study in the interest of both the outcome for patients and pati ent safety.  As a single agent 
panitumumab continues to represent a scientifically sound and i nteresting anti-cancer agent 
to explore in small bowel adenocarcinoma and ampullary adenocar cinoma, and thus this 
study will no longer explore combination therapy but will explo re panitumumab as a single-
agent in refractory disease. 
Eligibility: (List All Criteria)
Inclusion:
1) Patients must have histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of  the small bowel or ampulla of Vater 
that is either unresectable or metastatic.
2) Adequate tumor tissue available for KRAS mutational analysis or known KRAS wild-type status.
3) Prior progression on or intolerance to treatment with a fluor opyrimidine and oxaliplatin. Recurrence 
of disease within 6 months from the completion of adjuvant ther apy with both a fluoropyrimidine and 
oxaliplatin is considered progression.
4) Patients must have measurable disease as per the revised Resp onse Evaluation Criteria In Solid 
Tumors (RECIST) criteria (Version 1.1).
5) If radiation was previously received, the measurable disease must be outside the previous radiation 
field, unless this area has demonstrated evidence of radiograph ic growth.
6) A minimum of 2 weeks must have elapsed from completion of any  prior chemotherapy or 
radiotherapy or surgery and the start date of study therapy.
7) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 - 2.
8) Adequate organ function including: a) Absolute neutrophil cou nt (ANC) =/>1,000/ul; b) Platelets 
=/>75,000/ul; c) Total bilirubin =/< 1.5 x ULN; in patients wit h known Gilbert’s syndrome direct bilirubin 
=/<1.5 x ULN will be used as organ function criteria, instead o f total bilirubin; d) AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) 
< 3 x ULN; e) Creatinine <2 x ULN.
9) Negative urine or serum pregnancy test in women with childbea ring potential (defined as not 
post-menopausal for 12 months or no previous surgical steriliza tion), within one week prior to initiation of 
treatment.
10) The effects of panitumumab on the developing fetus are unkno wn. For this reason, women of 
childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contr aception (hormonal or barrier method of

birth control) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for six months following the 
completion of therapy. Should a woman become pregnant while par ticipating in this study, she should 
inform her treating physician immediately.
11) Patients must sign an Informed Consent and Authorization ind icating that they are aware of the 
investigational nature of this study and the known risks involv ed.
12) Magnesium level =/> lower limit of normal.
Exclusion:
1) Prior anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody therapy (eg. panitumumab or cetuximab) or 
prior small molecule anti-epidermal growth factor receptor ther apy (eg. erlotinib) for adenocarcinoma of 
the small bowel or ampulla of Vater.
2) Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agent s nor have received any 
investigational drug 30 days prior to enrollment.
3) Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, 
symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,  cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric 
illness/social situations that would limit adherence with study  requirements.
4) Interstitial pneumonia or extensive and symptomatic interstit ial fibrosis of the lung.
5) Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse ev ents in nursing infants secondary to 
treatment of the mother with panitumumab, breast feeding must b e discontinued.
6) Age <18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are cu rrently available on the use of 
panitumumab in patients <18 years of age, children are excluded  from this study.
Is there an age limit?  Yes
Why?  Provide scientific justification:
18 years or older.  Because no dosing or adverse event data are  currently available on the use of 
CAPOX and panitumumab in the pediatric age group.
Disease Group:
Gastrointestinal
Treatment Agents/Devices/Interventions:Capecitabine, Oxaliplatin, Panitumumab
Proposed Treatment/Study Plan:
This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm phase II study.   Patients who enroll will 
have tumors tested for the presence of activating mutations in codons 12 or 13 , or at 
codon 61 (if tested) of the KRAS oncogene.  Only patients who h ave wild-type KRAS 
gene sequences at these codons will be eligible to undergo stud y treatment with 
panitumumab.
Panitumumab will be administered at 9 mg/kg given over approxim ately a 60-minute 
2009-0458

Abstract - Page 5
infusion through a peripheral or central catheter on Day 1 of a  two-week cycle.  For 
doses >1000 mg the infusion time should be increased to 90 minu tes. The panitumumab 
being administered in this study is not a commercially marketed  product. Although it is 
expected to be very similar in safety and activity to the comme rcially marketed drug, it is 
possible that some differences may exist. Because this is not a  commercially marketed 
drug, panitumumab can only be administered to patients enrolled  in this clinical trial and 
may only be administered under the direction of physicians who are investigators in this 
clinical trial.
Study Calendar 
1 Informed consent must be obtained before any evaluations on th is study to occur.
2.    Only patients who have wild-type KRAS gene sequences at c odons 12 or 13, or at codon 61 if it is 
tested, will be eligible.  Testing may be performed at MD Ander son Cancer Center or an outside 
CLIA-certified laboratory.  For testing at MD Anderson Cancer C enter five unstained slides or a paraffin 
embedded tumor block are required.    Tissue may be requested u p to 6 weeks prior to first day of study 
treatment.  In consenting patients, additional archival tissue may be collected at the same time for use in 
future research.  Diagnostic imaging studies must be completed within 28 days prior to first day of study 
treatment. Hematologic, biochemistry, and serum pregnancy (if a pplicable) testing must be performed within 
7 days prior to first dose of study drug.  All other baseline e valuations must be completed within 10 days 
prior to first dose of study drug.

3 For Cycle 1, baseline evaluations will suffice if performed wi thin 7 days prior to first dose of study drug. 
4 Within 72 hours prior to start of the cycle (except for Cycle 1 as noted above).  
5 Patient will be instructed to report any adverse events to the  research nurse at least once weekly (+/- 1 
day).  
6 Imaging should be obtained every 4 cycles (+/- 1week allowanc e is made for scheduling).  . After a 
tumor evaluation is performed which demonstrates a tumor respon se (partial or complete), confirmation of 
the response may be obtained by a second evaluation to be perfo rmed 3 cycles later.  
7 For patients taken off study treatment for reasons other than progression, perform every 12 weeks (+/- 2 
week allowance is made for scheduling) after the End of Treatme nt Evaluation visit until documentation of 
progression if no other anti-cancer treatment is given.
8 CT scans or other imaging modality. MRI may be used in cases w here it is felt to be unsafe to perform 
CT secondary to patient's history of dye allergy, or if the tum or is not adequately seen on CT for the 
purposes of this study.
9 Treatment-related adverse events occurring during study treatm ent or within 30 days after the last 
administration of study drug(s) will be followed until resoluti on or stabilization.  If the patient is unable or 
unwilling to return to M. D. Anderson for this assessment, the patient will be contacted by phone for this 
assessment.  
10 Every 3 months (+/- 2 weeks) from Post-Treatment Evaluation.11 Hematology: hemoglobin, platelets, and absolute neutrophil co unt.  Chemistry:  creatinine, total bilirubin, 
AST, ALT, Magnesium, Potassium, Calcium.  In patients with know n Gilbert’s syndrome direct bilirubin will 
also be performed

Abstract - Page 7
The primary endpoint of this phase II, single arm study is resp onse rate (RR) for patients 
treated with single-agent Panitumumab. Patients will be evaluat ed for up to 8 cycles 
from their first dose, and a patient will be considered as a no n-responder if no PR or CR 
has been documented after 8 cycles of treatment. Patients who w ithdraw early will be 
included in the ITT analysis. Based on our current data with a null hypothesis of </=1% 
RR to an inactive drug for refractory patients, a sample size o f 17 patients with 
Panitumumab would be required to demonstrate a response rate of  17% using a 
binomial one-sample test with a two-sided alpha of 0.05 and pow er of 90%. 
 
The primary adverse event to be monitored will be the toxicity rate.  Toxicities to be 
included in toxicity monitoring include definite or probably tr eatment-related grade 3 or 4 
non-hematological toxicities, excluding grade 3 rash and grade 3 hypomagnesemia, 
which are both expected and manageable toxicities. Only toxicit ies during the first 4 
cycles of therapy will be used in toxicity monitoring. Accrual is estimated at 1 to 2 
patients per month.   
 
Sample Size and Endpoint Monitoring 
 Response and toxicity will be monitored simultaneously using th e Bayesian approach of 
Thall, Simon, Estey (1995, 1996) and the extension by Thall and  Sung (1998). Data from 
a previous study of single agent Panitumumabe in Kras wildtype colorectal cancer 
demonstrated a response rate for Panitumumab is approximately 1 7%. The toxicity rate 
of Panitumumab will estimate it will be approximately 25%.  For  the prior distribution of 
standard Panitumumab, we assumed a simple Dirichlet distributio n and independence 
between OR and toxicity in 124 patients.  The parameters for th is prior distribution are as 
follows:   
 
Dirichlet parameters for the joint prior distribution of object ive response and 
toxicity rate assuming information on 124 patients and independ ence among 
response and toxicity for Panitumumab. 
      N o  R e s ponse   Response 
  No Toxicity             77       16 
  Toxicity             26         5  
A flat Dirichlet prior distribution for experimental Panitumumab  was chosen reflective of 
information from the equivalent of 4 patients with the same mar ginal distributions as for 
Panitumumab (e.g., RR rate of 17% and toxicity rate of 25%). 
 
This regimen of Panitumumab will be considered worthy of furthe r investigation if it elicits 
an increase in RR to 25% with acceptable toxicity.  A 25% toxic ity rate is considered 
unacceptable.  Thus, interim monitoring rules, assuming the pri or distributions above, 
were constructed that meet the following two conditions, 
1) Pr(ØS, Toxicity <ØE, Toxicity | data) > 0.95 and, 
2) Pr(ØS, Response <ØE, Response | data) < 0.05 
Where  Ø E, Toxicity and ØE, Response are the true toxicity and response rates for Panitumumab, 
respectively.  The first rule provides for stopping the study i f excessive toxicity is highly 
probable (i.e., probability >95%) for Panitumumab.  The second condition will stop the 
study early if the data suggest that it is unlikely (i.e., prob ability < 5%) that response rate

Abstract - Page 8
of the drug is 17%. Assuming the minimum number of patients is 1, the maximum 
number of patients is 17 and the cohort size is 1.
The monitoring rule for the toxicity rate, based on these assum ptions and monitoring 
conditions above is found in the following table.  For example,  accrual will cease if 4 or 
more patients experience toxicities among the first 5 patients treated or if 6 or more 
patients experience toxicities among the first 10 patients.
 
Stop accrual if the number of toxicities is equal to or greater  than indicated 
(i.e., # toxicities) among the number of patients evaluated (i. e., # patients) 
# Toxicities 3-4 4-6 5-9 6-11 17-14 8-16 
# Patients 3-4 5-6 7-9 10-11 12-14 15-16 
 
Monitoring the response rate, based on the above assumptions an d monitoring will begin 
after 1 patient is treated (on an intent-to-treat basis). Follo wing this rule, the trial will be 
terminated if [# Response]/[# patients evaluated] =< 0/8.  For example, accrual will 
cease if 0 or fewer patients experience a response in the first  8 patients treated.
Multc Lean Desktop (version 2.0.0) was used to generate the tox icity and futility stopping 
boundaries and the OC table. In order to utilize the software f or the design, a beta (21, 
103) prior was assumed for the historical control response rate  and a beta (31, 93) prior 
was assumed for the historical control toxicity rate. 
The probability of stopping the study early if the true respons e rate of the Panitumumab 
was not better than 17% was 35%.  Probabilities of stopping ear ly for high true toxicity 
rates (i.e., 37%) were 57% when the true RR rate was 17% and 48 % when true RR was 
25%.

A flat Dirichlet prior distribution for experimental Panitumuma b was chosen reflective of information from 
the equivalent of 4 patients with the same marginal distributio ns as for Panitumumab (e.g., RR rate of 
17% and toxicity rate of 25%).
This regimen of Panitumumab will be considered worthy of furthe r investigation if it elicits an increase in 
RR to 25% with acceptable toxicity.  A 25% toxicity rate is con sidered unacceptable.  Thus, interim 
monitoring rules, assuming the prior distributions above, were constructed that meet the following two 
conditions,
1) Pr(ØS, Toxicity < ØE, Toxicity | data) > 0.95 and,
2) Pr(ØS, Response <ØE, Response | data) < 0.05
Where ØE, Toxicity and ØE, Response are the true toxicity and r esponse rates for Panitumumab, 
respectively.  The first rule provides for stopping the study i f excessive toxicity is highly probable (i.e., 
probability >95%) for Panitumumab.  The second condition will s top the study early if the data suggest 
that it is unlikely (i.e., probability < 5%) that response rate  of the drug is 17%. Assuming the minimum 
number of patients is 1, the maximum number of patients is 17 a nd the cohort size is 1.
The monitoring rule for the toxicity rate, based on these assum ptions and monitoring conditions above is 
found in the following table.  For example, accrual will cease if 4 or more patients experience toxicities 
among the first 5 patients treated or if 6 or more patients exp erience toxicities among the first 10 patients.
      Stop accrual if the number of toxicities is equal to or g reater than indicated
      (i.e., # toxicities) among the number of patients evaluat ed (i.e., # patients)
      # Toxicities        3-4      4-6      5-9     6-11    17- 14      8-16

Monitoring the response rate, based on the above assumptions an d monitoring will begin after 1 patient is 
treated (on an intent-to-treat basis). Following this rule, the  trial will be terminated if [# Response]/[# 
patients evaluated] =< 0/8.  For example, accrual will cease if  0 or fewer patients experience a response 
in the first 8 patients treated.

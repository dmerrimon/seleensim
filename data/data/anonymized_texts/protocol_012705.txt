BACKGROUND  
Study Disease  
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), a subtype of non- Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL)  that 
represents a distinct disease entity.  The term MCL was proposed in 1992 to unify 
previously defined subtypes of NHL, such as diffuse poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma, intermediate differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma, centrocytic lymphoma, and diffuse small cleaved cell lymphoma, into a single disease entity (1).  According to the International Lymphoma Study Group (ILSG), MCL represents 6% of all NHLs (2).  MCL is derived from a subset of naive pre- germinal center cells, and may present with 
two cytological variants: typical (lymphocytic) or blastic (3-4).  In addition, there are three possible patterns of involvement:  mantle -zone, nodular or diffuse (4).  It has been 
suggested that the treatment response and survival of the diffuse and nodular patterns are worse than those involving the mantle cell zone.  Majlis et al reported 3 -year 
survival rates for mantle -zone, nodular, and diffuse type of 100%, 50%, and 55% 
respective ly (5).  The monoclonal B-cells express CD19, CD20, CD22, HLA-DR, CD5, 
surface IgM and, in most cases, surface IgD.  They are negative for CD23 and CD10 (CALLA) antigens (6). 
The characteristic cytogenetic abnormality in MCL is the t(11;14) (q13;q32) translocation.  Band 11q23 includes the BCL-1 locus, which is the site of the PRAD1 (CCND1) gene encoding for cyclin D1.  This rearrangement results in translocation of the BCL -1 locus to the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene enhancer region located at 
14q32, causing cyclin D1 over-expression.  Cyclin D1 interacts with cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 to facilitate the progression of cell through G1 into S phase of proliferation (7). 
MCL is one of the worst types of NHL since it incorporates some of the undesirable 
features of both low -grade and high-grade lymphomas, namely incurability and rapid 
course respectively (7).  Most of the patients present with advanced stage, high international prognostic index (IPI), and extranodal involvement.  The incidence of Stage III and IV varies between 75 to 90% of the patients (2, 4, 6-8).  In addition, there is a high incidence of extranodal involvement, the most common sites being bone marrow (61 -79%), spleen (31- 60%), liver (13-30%), peripheral blood (12-30%), and 
gastrointestinal tract (18 -20%) (6-9) .  Central nervous system (CNS) involvement 
occurs in about 4% of the patients and is associated with poor prognosis (10). 
The long-term survival for patients with MCL is generally poor, with only about 27% 
of the patients surviving 5 years after diagnosis and 11% of the patients being disease-free after 5 years.  In addition, the ILSG found no 5-year survivors with IPI index 4/5, placing MCL among the lymphomas with worse overall prognosis (2) .  Despite 
response rates of 50% to 70% to different regimens, all patients eventually develop disease progression after chemotherapy, with the mean survival around 3 years (11). 
Study Agent  
CONFIDENTIAL  Version #: 1 
eProst# 20150402  Version Date: 15/ APR /2015 
Page 13 of 50 Patients in Group A will receive daily oral thalidomide (THALOMID®) as per standard 
of care and THALOMID® REMS ™ guidelines (formerly known as S.T.E.P.S.).   
Rationale 
Several studies using combination chemotherapy with or without anthracyclines (CHOP or COP) showed responses between 56% and 90%, with CR rates ranging from 9% to 58%.  However, relapse -free survival was relatively short with average of 15 to 20 
months.  Median survival in most studies ranged from 28 to 52 months (12).  Therapy with fludarabine alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents has been tested in small trials.  In a recent study, Cohen et al obtained response rates of 66% (30% CR) i n a study involving 30 patients treated with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. 
The overall survival for patients receiving this combination as first line therapy has not been reached at 43 months, although failure - free survival was 28 months (13).  In another 
study involving 29 patients, Zinzani et al achieved a 63% overall response (28% CR) using fludarabine alone or in combination with idarubicin (14).  Rituximab has also been tested in MCL.  Igarashi et al treated 21 patients with refractory or relapse d MCL, 
achieving a 31% response rate (no CR observed) (15).  Howard et al obtained a 96% response rate (48%n CR) in 25 patients with MCL, using a combination of CHOP and rituximab.  25 patients were evaluated for molecular remission, which was seen in 9 of  
them.  However, the achievement of CR or molecular remission did not translate into a prolonged progression- free survival, which was 16.6 months (16).  Khouri et al , treated 
patients with Hyper -CVAD, an aggressive regimen alternating cycles of 
cyclophosph amide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and dexamethasone and high- dose 
methotrexate and cytarabine.  This regimen induced a 93% response rate with 82 % CR.  
This therapy was followed by stem cell transplantation and 93% of previously untreated patients were alive at 3 years post -transplant, 73% of them disease -free (19).  
Although encouraging results have been reported for stem cell transplant (SCT), its role in the treatment of patients with MCL remains unknown.  Overall 3- year survival for 
MCL patients previously treated ranges between 24% to 59%, with one study, performe d 
by Milpied et al, reporting 80% overall survival at 4 years (20- 22).  Event -free survival 
(EFS) or progression -free survival (PFS) at three years however, ranges between 17% to 
48% (19, 22).  Stewart et al, reported a 23% overall survival for SCT in MCL  patients in 
first remission.  EFS/PFS however, was only 8% (23).  There have been few small studies on the use of allogeneic SCT in MCL.  The reported overall survival is 55% to 62% at 2 years (24 -25).  
Due to unsatisfactory results obtained with both conventional chemotherapy and SCT, it has become clear that new high -dose intense chemotherapeutic regimens are needed to 
improve the survival rates for patients with MCL.  Similar intensity protocols have b een 
used for treatment of Burkitt’s lymphoma.  M agrath treated patients with Burkitt’s 
lymphoma using the CODOX -M protocol, which consisted of cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, prednisone, vincristine, high- dose methotrexate and intrathecal 
methotrexate, alternating with IVAC (ifosfamide, etoposide, high -dose cytarabine and 
intrathecal methotrexate).  This regimen resulted in excellent disease control and was 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version #: 1 
eProst# 20150402  Version Date: 15/ APR /2015 
Page 14 of 50 relatively well tolerated in both children and adults (17).  Mead et al used this same 
regimen in 52 patients with Burkitt’s lymphoma.  All patients developed grade ¾ neutropenia and 64% of the patients developed grade ¾ thrombocytopenia.  The only other s ignificant side effect was mucositis, observed in about 40% of the cases (18).  We 
have therefore developed a similar intense protocol combining most of the agents that demonstrated activity in MCL in an attempt to provide a better disease control with improved response rates and overall survival.Since a recent study has demonstrated a 
beneficial effect of thalidomide in patients with mantle cell lymphoma, patients were  
offered the option to receive maintenance thalidomide after the completion of the induction therapy as a consolidation to the aggressive chemotherapy (25a).

Thalidomide (THALOMID®) will be administered as per standard of care guidelines , 
in compliance with THALOMID® REMS ™ program requirements.  
For additional information on thalidomide (THALOMID®) including mechanism of 
action, drug metabolism, pharmacokinetics & toxicology, known side effects, 
composition, and storage recommendations, see [Section 9.1]. 
 Treatment Dispensation, Compliance and Accountability  of thalidomide 
(THALOMID®)  for Group A  
Thalidomide will be administered in the outpatient setting as per standard of care 
guidelines, in compliance with THALOMID® REMS™ program requirements.   
 Supportive Care Guidelines  
Appropriate supportive care as per institutional guidelines should be given, as 
necessary .  
 Drug Interactions and Precautions   
The use of opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, anti-anxiety agents, or other CNS depressants concomitantly with THALOMID ® may cause an additive sedative effect 
and should be avoided. 
Drugs which cause bradycardia or peripheral neuropathy may cause additive effects and 
should be used with caution. 
Hormonal contraceptives increase the risk of thromboembolism.  
Concomitant use of HIV -protease inhibitors, griseofulvin, modafinil, penicillins, 
rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, or certain herbal supplements such as St. 
John's Wort with hormonal contraceptive agents may reduce the effectiveness of the contraception up to one month after discontinuation of these concomitant therapies.

 THALOMID® , thalidomide  
 Mechanism of Action  
The mechanism of action of THALOMID is not fully understood. THALOMID 
possesses immunomodulatory, antiinflammatory and antiangiogenic properties. 
Available data from in vitro studies and clinical trials suggest that the 
immunologic effects of this compound can vary substantially under different conditions, but may be related to suppression of excessive tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α) production and down- modulation of selected cell surface 
adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte migration. For example, administration of thalidomide has  been reported to decrease circulating levels of 
TNF -α in patients with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL); however, it has also 
been shown to increase plasma TNF -α levels in HIV -seropositive patients. Other 
anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of thalidomide may 
include suppression of macrophage involvement in prostaglandin synthesis, and modulation of interleukin-10 and interleukin-12 production by per ipheral blood 
mononuclear cells. Thalidomide treatment of multiple myeloma patients is accompanied by an increase in the number of circulating natura l killer cells, and 
an increase in plasma levels of interleukin -2 and interferon -gamma (T cell -
derived cytokines associated with cytotoxic activity). Thalidomide was found to inhibit angiogenesis in a human umbilical artery explant model in vitro. The 
cellular processes of angiogenesis inhibited by thalidomide may include the 
proliferation of endothelial cells.  
 Drug Metabolism, Pharmacokinetics and Toxicology 
In a C-radiolabel ADME study in humans, unchanged drug is the predominant 
circulating component. Thalidomide is not a substrate of the cytochrome P450 system. At therapeutic concentrations, thalidomide is not an inhibitor or inducer of human cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro. Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with substrates, inhibitors or inducers of CYP450 are not 
anticipated.

 Nonclinical Toxicology : Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in 
male and female rats and mice. No compound- related tumorigenic effects were 
observed at the highest dose levels of 3,000 mg/kg/day to male and female mice 
(38-fold greater than the highest recommended daily human dose of 400 mg 
based upon body surface area [BSA]), 3,000 mg/kg/day to female rats (75-fold the maximum human dose based upon BSA), and 300 mg/kg/day to male rats (7.5-fold the maximum human dose based upon BSA).  
Thalidomide was neither mutagenic nor genotoxic in the following assays: the 
Ames bacteri
al (S. typhimurium and E. coli) reverse mutation assay, a Chinese 
hamster ovary cell (AS52/XPRT) forward mutation assay, and an in vivo mouse 
micronucleus test.  
Fertility studies were conducted in male and female rabbits; no compound -
related effects in mating and fertility indices were observed at any oral thalidomide dose level including the highest of 100 mg/kg/day to female rabbits and 500 mg/kg/day to male rabbits (approximately 5- and 25- 18 fold the 
maximum human dose, respectively, based upon BSA). Testicular pathological 
and histopathological effects (classified as slight) were seen in male rabbits at 
dose levels ≥30 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.5- fold the maximum human dose 
based upon BSA).  
 
 Management of Agent -Specific Adverse Events  
Most patients taking thalidomide can be expected to experience adverse reactions.  
Teratogenicity:  
The most serious toxicity associated with thalidomide is its documented human teratogenicity. The risk of severe birth defects, primarily phocomelia or death to the fetus, is extremely high during the critical period of pregnancy. The critical period is es timated, depending on the source of information, to range from 35 to 
50 days after the last menstrual period. The risk of other potentially severe birth defects outside this critical period is unknown, but may be significant. Based on present knowledge, thalidomide must not be used at any time during pregnancy. Because thalidomide is present in the semen of patients receiving the drug, males receiving thalidomide must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any 
sexual contact with females of reproductive potential, even if he has undergone a 
successful vasectomy.  
Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism: 
An increased risk of venous thromboembolism (such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism), ischemic heart disease (including myocardial 
CONFIDENTIAL   Version #: 1 
eProst# 20150402   Version Date: 15/ APR /2015  
Page 20 of 50 
 infarction), and stroke have been reported in patients with multiple myeloma 
treated with thalidomide [see Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism].  
Peripheral Neuropathy: 
Peripheral neuropathy is a very common, potentially severe, adverse reaction of treatment with thalidomide that may result in irreversible damage. Peripheral neuropathy generally occurs following chronic use over a period of months. 
However, reports follow ing relatively short- term use also exist. Incidence of 
neuropathy events leading to discontinuation, dose reduction or interruption 
increases with cumulative dose and duration of therapy. Symptoms may occur sometime after thalidomide treatment has been sto pped and may resolve slowly 
or not at all.  
Somnolence, dizziness, and rash are the most commonly observed adverse 
reactions associated with the use of thalidomide. Adverse event profiles from clinical trials are summarized in the sections that follow.  
Adverse Reactions in Multiple Myeloma Controlled Clinical Trials  
The safety analyses were conducted in two controlled clinical studies (Study 1 
and Study 2). The safety analysis in Study 1 was conducted on 204 patients who 
received treatment. Table 1 lists the most common adverse drug reactions (≥ 10%). The most frequently reported adverse reactions were fatigue, hypocalcemia, edema, constipation, sensory neuropathy, dyspnea, muscle weakness, leukopenia, neutropenia, rash/desquamation, confusion, anorexia, nausea, anxiety/agitation , tremor, fever, weight loss, thrombosi s/embolism, 
neuropathy-motor, weight gain, dizziness, and dry skin.  
Twenty -three percent of patients (47/204) discontinued due to adverse reactions; 
30% (31/102) from the THALOMID/dexamethasone arm and 16% (16/102) 
from the dexamethasone alone arm.

The safety analysis in Study 2 was conducted on 466 patients who received 
treatment. Table 2 lists the most common adverse drug reactions (≥ 10%) that were observed. Table 3 lists the most common Grade 3/4 adverse drug reactions (occurring at > 2%) that we re observed. The adverse reactions most often 
reported by patients treated with THALOMID/dexamethasone were constipation, peripheral edema, tremor, asthenia, dizziness and fatigue. Adverse reactions with a frequency at least 2 -fold higher in the THALOMID/dexamethasone group than 
in the placebo/dexamethasone group include constipation, tremor, deep vein thrombosis and peripheral sensory neuropathy. Twenty- six percent of patients 
(121/466) discontinued due to adverse events; 37% (86/234) from the THALOMID/dex amethasone arm and 15% (35/232) from the 
placebo/dexamethasone arm.

All grade 3/4 and serious adverse reactions reported >2 patients in THALOMID/dexamethasone arm and with a percentage higher in the THALOMID/dexamethasone arm compared to the placebo/dexamethasone arm have been considered for possible inclusion. In any cases medical judgment has been applied for conside ration of causality assessment.  
Adverse Reactions in Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) Clinical Trials  
Table 4 lists treatment- emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in 
THALOMID- treated patients in clinical trials in ENL. The most common 
adverse reactions (≥10%) reported in patients with ENL were somnolence, rash, headache. Doses ranged from 50 to 300 mg/day. All adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity, and none resulted in discontinuation.

Page 26 of 50 Other Adverse Events Observed in ENL Patients  
THALOMID in doses up to 400 mg/day has been administered investigationally 
in the United States over a 19-year period in 1465 patients with ENL. The 
published literature describes the treatment of an additional 1678 patients. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of the individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using a modified COSTART dictionary/terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. All reported events are included 
except those already listed in the previous table. Due to the fact that these data 
were collected from uncontrolled studies, the incidence rate cannot be determined. No causal relationship between THALOMID and these events can be conclusively determined at this time. These are reports of all adverse events noted by investigators in patients to whom they had administered thalidomide.

Drug Substance : 
Proper name: thalidomide  
Chemical name: α -(N-phthalimido) glutarimide  
Molecular formula and molecular mass: C 13H10N2O4, 258.2 g 
CONFIDENTIAL   Version #: 1 
eProst# 20150402   Version Date: 15/ APR /2015  
Page 30 of 50 
 Structural formula:  
   
Physicochemical properties: Thalidomide is an off-white to white, odorless, 
crystalline powder that is soluble at 2 5̊C in dimethyl sulfoxide and sparingly 
soluble in water and ethanol. The glutarimide moiety contains a single asymmetric center and, therefore, may exist in either of two  optically active 
forms designated S -(-) or R -(+). Thalidomide used in THALOMID® contains an 
equal mixture of the S-(-) and R- (+) forms and, therefore, has a net optical 
rotation of zero.  
 Storage Recommendations  
Store at 15 -30º C. Keep out of the reach of children.  
 Dispensation and Accountability 
THALOMID® is only available through a controlled distribution program called THALOMID® REMS ™.  Under this program, only enrolled prescribers and  
program- certified  pharmacists are able to prescribe and dispense the product.  In 
addition, THALOMID® can only be dispensed to patients who are registered and meet all the conditions of the REMS™ program.   
For more information, call the manufacturer (Celgene Customer Care Center) 
toll-free number at 1 -888-423-5436 or log on to the 
www.CelgeneRiskManagement.com  website. 
 SPECIAL HANDLING INSTRUCTIONS  
Currently, no published data are available regarding the cutaneous absorption of 
thalidomide.  
Most health care institutions recommend that latex gloves be worn while handling chemotherapeutic agents. Health care providers may consider wearing 
gloves when directly handling THALOMID® (thalidomide capsules), along with 
standard hand washing. Females who could become pregnant, or who plan to become pregnant can handle THALOMID® capsules if they are using latex gloves.  
Repackaging of THALOMID® must only be done on exceptional circumstances. 
This should only be done by pharmacists.

Key: CR=Complete Response; CR(u)=Complete Response/unconfirmed; PR=Partial Response  
 Response Criteria  
 CR requires the following : 
1. Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of 
disease and disappearance of all disease- related symptoms if present before 
therapy, and normalization of those biochemical abnormalities (e.g. LDH) 
definitely assignable to NHL.  
2. All lymph nodes and nodal masses must have regressed to normal size.  
Previously involved nodes that were between 1.1 to 1.5 cm in their greatest 
transverse diameter before treatment , must have decreased to ≤ 1 cm in their 
greatest transverse diameter after treatment, or by more than 75% in the sum of 
the products of the greatest diameters (SPD).  
3. The spleen, if considered to be enlarged before therapy on the basis o f a CT 
scan, must have regressed in size and must not be palpable on physical exam.  However, no normal size can be specified because of the difficulties in accurately evaluating splenic and hepatic sizes.   
4. If the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma before treatment, the infiltrate 
must be cleared on repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on the same site. 
 CR/unconfirmed (CR (u)) requires the following : 
1. Residual lymph node mass greater than 1.5 cm in greatest transverse diameter that has regressed by more than 75% in the SPD.  Individual nodes that were previously confluent must have regressed by more than 75% in their SPD compared with the size of the  original mass.  
2. Indeterminate bone marrow (increased number or size of aggregates without cytologic or architectural atypia).   
 PR requires the following : 
1. > 50% decrease in SPD of the six largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version #: 1 
eProst# 20150402  Version Date: 15/ APR /2015 
Page 35 of 50 2. No increase in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen.
3. Splenic or hepatic nodules must regress by at least 50% in the SPD.
4. With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other
organs is considered assessable and not measurable disease.
5. Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for the determination of a PR because it
is assessable and not measurable disease.
6. No new sites of disease.
 Stable disease (SD)  is defined as less than a PR but not progressive disease.
 Relapsed disease ( PD requires the following :
1. Appearance of any new lesion or increase by ≥ 50% in the size of previously
involved sites.
2. ≥ 50% increase in greatest diameter of any previously identified node greater
than 1 cm in its short axis or in the SPD of more than one node.
 Progressive disease (PR or nonresponders) require the following: 
1. ≥50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously identified abnormalnode for PRs or nonresponders.
2. Appearance of any new lesion during the end of therapy.
 (Duration of Overall Response) 
(The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or 
progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented. ) 
 (Duration of Stable Disease ) 
(Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started. ) 
 Progression -Free Survival (PFS)  
Patients will be followed at a minimum of annual intervals  (every 12 months, ±30 days) 
or as clinically indicated and at the discretion of the Investigator to  document the 
progression- free interval.

  ADVERSE EVENTS  
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for   Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 will be utilized for adverse event reporting. 
 Purpose  
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies, as well as those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents.  Adverse events are  reported in a 
routine manner at scheduled times during a trial.  Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner for timelier monitoring of patient safety and 
care.  
  Adverse Event  
Adverse Event (AE): Can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, medical treatment, or procedure without judgment about causality.  An adverse event can arise from any use and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose 
including an overdose. This includes any newly occurring event or a previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since initiation of a drug, medical 
treatment,  or procedure.  
Abnormal Findings 
In any clinical assessment, a value outside the normal or reference range (such as a clinical laboratory, vital sign, or ECG) will not be reported or assessed as an AE unless 
that value is considered to be of clinical significance by the investigator.  A v alue of 
clinical significance is one that leads to discontinuation or delay in protocol treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention*, or is considered to be a clinically significant new finding or change from baseline by the investigator.  
*Transfusion support administered to offset clinical symptoms of anemia or 
thrombocytopenia will not be considered therapeutic intervention.  
Signs and Symptoms 
Signs/symptoms resulting from an underlying clinical diagnosis should be documented as one comprehensive AE.   If no underlying clinical diagnosis can be identified, each 
sign/symptom should be reported as a separate independent event.  (A new or worsening event resulting from an underlying clinical diagnosis or a reaction to concurrent medications should be documented as a separate independent AE unless it 
is within the normal range of fluctuation for that patient.)   
CONFIDENTIAL   Version #: 1 
eProst# 20150402   Version Date: 15/ APR /2015  
Page 37 of 50 
 Grade Changes/Fluctuations 
AEs will be reported at the maximum grade/severity experienced for the duration of 
the event.   Should one particular event warrant further investigation, additional details 
may be collected at the discretion of the Principal Investigator.    
Progression of Disease  
Progression of disease, if documented in accordance to standard of care, should not be reported as an AE. 
Tests and Procedures  
Tests and procedures should not be reported as AEs.  The underlying clinical diagnosis (or sign/symptom in the event an underlying clinical diagnosis is not known) requiring testing or a procedure, should be reported as an adverse event if it meets criteri a for 
reporting.
 
 Serious Adverse Events (see also Appendix A)  
Serious AE (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that occurs at any dose:  
1. Results in death.  
2. Is life -threatening .  
The term "life -threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in which 
the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe).  
3. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of present hospitalization.  Elective hospitalization to simplify protocol treatment/evaluations or to treat a 
baseline condition that did not worsen from baseline will not be considered an SAE.    
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity .  
Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect .  
6. Is a medically important event.  
A medically important event may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention 
to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above, or involves 
suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent.   Examples 
of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result 
in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse; any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  
CONFIDENTIAL   Version #: 1 
eProst# 20150402   Version Date: 15/ APR /2015  
Page 38 of 50 
 Clarification should be made between the terms serious and severe because they ARE 
NOT synonymous.  The term severe  is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of 
a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, 
however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe headache).  
This is NOT the same as serious, which is based on patient/event outcome or action 
criteria described above and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a 
patient’s life or functioning.  A severe AE does not necessarily need to be considered serious.  For example, persistent nausea of several hours duration may be considered severe nausea but not an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke resulting in only a minor 
degree of disability may be considered mild but would be defined as an SAE based on 
the above noted criteria.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
 
 Adverse Event Collection Period  
In this protocol, adverse events include only treatment- emergent adverse events.  A 
treatment- emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as any event that begins or 
worsens after the start of protocol treatment.  All baseline-emergent adverse events, any event that begins or worsens after completion of the informed consent but prior to the 
start of protocol treatment, should be reported as a Baseline/Comorbid Condition.  
 All adverse events that occur within ≤ 30 days of the last dose of study therapy will be 
reported and followed until resolution.  Resolution is defined as a return to baseline status or the stabilization of an event with the expectation that it will remain chronic.  (Exception: If a patient begins an alternative therapy that co nfounds accurate 
assessment of AEs within ≤ 30 days of the last dose of study therapy, all adverse event collection will stop and any ongoing events will be left open.) 
 Targeted Adverse Event Collection  
The targeted collection of the following safety data is specified for this protocol:  
• Serious adverse events (unexpected or expected); see also Appendix A  
• Potentially serious adverse events, such as suicidality (suicidal ideation or 
thoughts) or suspected pregnancy in Group A patients  • Adverse events that cause discontinuation of treatment/intervention (e.g. Section 
10.1) 
• Unexpected adverse events with reasonable causality (possible, probable or 
definite) to the treatment/intervention  
 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
The information to be reported in AEs will be assessed by and assigned severity using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 3.0.   The NCI CTCAE provides descriptive terminology and a grading scale for each adverse event listed.  A copy of the NCI CTCAE v3.0 can be 
CONFIDENTIAL   Version #: 1 
eProst# 20150402   Version Date: 15/ APR /2015  
Page 39 of 50 
 downloaded from the CTEP home page 
(http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html ).    
Information to be reported in the description of each adverse event may be included, but is not limited to:
 
1. Clinical Diagnosis of the event as determined by NCI CTCAE, Version 3.0 
descriptive terminology.  If no clinical  diagnosis can be identified, each 
sign/symptom should be reported as a separate independent event. 
2. Date of onset of the AE (start date).  
3. Date of resolution of the AE (end date).  
4. Severity of the event determined by NCI CTCAE, Version 3.0 grading scale.     
5. Relationship of the AE to study therapy.  Categorized as follows:  
Definite  The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational agent(s)  
Probable  The adverse event is likely related to the investigational agent(s)  
Possible  The adverse event may be related to the investigational agent(s)  
Unlikely  The adverse event is doubtfully related to the investigational agent(s)  
Unrelated  The adverse event is clearly not related to the investigational agent(s)  
6. Whether or not the AE is Serious or Not Serious as defined in Section 14.3 Serious Adverse Events.  
7. Whether the AE is Suspected and/ or Unexpected. 
Suspected  Any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused 
the AE. For the purposes of expedited safety reporting, ‘reasonable 
possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. 
Unexpected  Any AE for which the nature or severity of the event is not consistent 
with the applicable product information, e.g., the Investigator’s Brochure or Package Insert. 
8. Action taken as a result of the AE.  
9. Outcome. 
 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
All applicable AEs, regardless if serious or not, will be described in the source 
documents, reported on the applicable AE log, and entered into Velos .  However, 
certain adverse events must also be reported in an expedited manner for more timely 
monitoring of patient safety and care.  Appendix A provides information about these expedited reporting requirements .

 INVESTIGATOR RESPONSIBILITIES  
 Investigator Responsibility/Performance  
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in accordance with all regulations governing the protection of human subjects. The investigator will ensure 
that all work and services described in or associated with this protocol will be 
conducted in accordance with the investigational plan, applicable regulations, and the highest standards of medical and clinical research practice.  
 Confidentiality  
The investigator must ensure that each subject’s anonymity will be maintained and each subject’s identity will be protected from unauthorized parties.  A number will be assigned to each subject upon study entry and the number and the subject’s initials wil l 
be used to identify the subject for the duration of the study.  The investigator will 
maintain all documents related to this study in strict confidence.  
 Informed Consent and Permission to Use Protected Health Information  
CONFIDENTIAL   Version #: 1 
eProst# 20150402   Version Date: 15/ APR /2015  
Page 41 of 50 
 It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain written informed consent from each 
subject participating in this study after adequate explanation, in lay language, of the methods, objectives, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study.  The investigator must also explain that the subject is completely free to refuse to enter the 
study or to discontinue participation at any time (for any reason) and receive alternative 
conventional therapy as indicated.  Prior to study participation, each subject will sign an IRB approved informed consent form and receive a copy of same (and information leaflet, if appropriate).  For subjects not qualified or able to give legal consent, consent must be obtained from a parent, legal guardian, or custodian. The investigator or 
designee must explain to the subject before enrollment into the study that for 
evaluation of study results, the subject’s protected health information obtained during 
the study may be shared with the study sponsor, regulatory agencies, and the IRB.  It is 
the investigator’s (or designee’s) responsibility to obtain permission to use protected health information per HIPAA from each subject, or if appropriate, the subjects’ parent or legal guardian. 
 Source Documentation and Investigator Files  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to fully document the 
conduct of the study and to ensure that study data can be subsequently verified.  These 
documents should be classified into two separate categories:  (1) investigator study file 
and (2) subject clinical source documents that corroborate data collected on CRFs within Velos .  Subject clinical source documents may include hospital/clinic patient 
records; physician's and nurse's notes; appointment book; original laboratory, ECG, EEG, radiology, pathology, and special assessment reports; pharmacy dispensing 
records; subject diaries; signed informed consent forms; and consultant letters.  When 
the CRF or any form is used as the source document, this must be clearly stated in the investigator study file. Minimally, the following be documented in source documents: 
• Medical history/physical condition and diagnosis of the subject before involvement 
in the study sufficient to verify protocol entry criteria  
• Study number, assigned subject number, and verification that written informed consent
 was obtained (each recorded in dated and signed notes on the day of entry 
into the study) 
• Progress notes for each subject visit  
• Documentation of treatment 
• Laboratory test results  
• Adverse events (action taken and resolution) 
• Condition and response of subject upon completion of or early termination from the study  
 Recording and Processing of Data  
If using hard copies of CRF’s, study center personnel will complete individual CRF’s 
in black ink.  All corrections to entered data will be made by drawing a single line 
CONFIDENTIAL   Version #: 1 
eProst# 20150402   Version Date: 15/ APR /2015  
Page 42 of 50 
 through the information to be corrected without obscuring it.  All corrections will be 
initialed, dated and explained, if necessary.  The use of “white -out” or obscuring 
correction tape will be prohibited.  A CRF is required for every patient who received any amount of study treatment.  The investigator will ensure that the CRF’s are 
accurate, complete, legible and timely. Separate source records are required to support 
all CRF entries except those for which use of the CRF as source document is clearly allowed per note in the investigator study file. 
Data must be submitted according to the protocol requirements for ALL patients 
registered.  Patients for whom documentation is inadequate to determine eligibility will 
generally be deemed ineligible.  
Data will be recorded in CRFs within Velos .  Monthly drug dispensing and annual 
reviews will be documented on electronic CRFs.     CRFs will be captured within Velos .   
Basic forms should include: 
• On-Study information, including patient eligibility data; 
• Tumor/disease assessment forms or other forms for response assessment.  
• Specialty forms for pathology, radiation or surgery when required; 
• Off-Study summary sheet, including a final assessment by the treating 
physician; 
• Follow-up forms when required 
Data must be submitted according to the protocol requirements for ALL patients 
registered.  Patients for whom documentation is inadequate to determine eligibility will 
generally be deemed ineligible.  
A list of forms to be submitted, as well as expectation dates may be found in Appendix 
B. 
 Non-Protocol Research  
No investigative procedures other than those described in this protocol will be 
undertaken on the enrolled subjects without the agreement of the IRB.  
 Ethics  
The investigator agrees to conduct the study in compliance with the protocol, current good clinical practices, and all applicable (local, FDA) regulatory guidelines and 
standard of ethics.

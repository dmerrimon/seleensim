1.  To determine the risk of disease progression, overall and even t free survival, and non-relapse 
mortality . 
2.  To determine the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD following the infusion of allogeneic 
CD8+ memory T-cells. 
2. BACKGROUND  
2.1 Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation  
Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is proven effective therapy for patients with a 
variety of hematolymphoid malignancies .  Following allogeneic HCT, a significant percentage of 
patients who were otherwise considered to hav e incurable cancers using best of care 
non-transplantation therapies have long -term disease free control and appear cured .  These patients 
are characterized by developing donor type hematopoiesis and have complete resolution of all 
disease -related signs, symptoms and markers .  Generally, patients who undergo allogen eic HCT 
are doing so as a “last  ditch” effort for long -term disease  control and possibly cure after exhausting 
all chemotherapy, and radiation therapy based treatment strategies .  Often many of the patients 
who undergo allogeneic HCT for treatment of their lymphoma have had disease relapse even after 
high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue (autologous HCT).  
2.2 Relapse of Disease following Allogeneic HCT  
The main cause for treatmen t failure following allogeneic HCT is disease relapse .  Depending, in 
part, on the disease, disease status at the time of transplantation, and the intensity of the 
transplantation regimen, disease relapse occurs in roughly 2 5 to 80% of patients .  For examp le, 
following a full dose transplant in younger patients with acute leukemia in 1st or 2nd complete 
remission (CR) and using a graft from an HLA -matched  sibling, the 2 -year risk of disease relapse 
was < 30% [1-8].  In contrast, the 2 -year risk of disease relapse for younger patients with 
refractory acute leukemia who received a full dose transplant was > 70% [9-11].  Older ( > 55 years 
of age) patients or younger patients with medical co -morbidities that preclude full dose 
conditioning undergo reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic HCT .  The 2 -year risk of 
disease relapse in patients with acute leukemia in CR who received RIC allogeneic HCT was 
> 50% [12, 13] .  Similarly, disease relapse remains the major cause of treatment failure for patien ts 
with T-cell, large B -cell and Hodgkin lymphomas  and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and 
occurs in > 40% who undergo RIC allogeneic HCT with chemotherapy, sub -lethal total body 
irradiation (TBI), or total lymphoid irradiation combined with anti -thymocyte globulin (TLI/ATG) 
[13-18].   
2.3 Treatment for Disease Relapse Following Allogeneic HCT  
Disease relapse following allogeneic HCT remains an ominous clinical event, which usually 
results in progressive disease and death .  Treatment strategies of patients with relapse following 
IRB-33058  Page 7 of 43 23 August 2019   allogeneic HCT can often be further complicated by t he overall general poor clinical status of the 
patient .  Strategies for the treatment of disease relapse in these patients include the cessation of 
post-transplant ation immune suppression medication, salvage chemotherapy with or without 
irradiation, a seco nd allogeneic HCT, or the infusion of donor leukocytes  (DLI) .  Despite these 
interventions few patients beyond those with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) can be 
returned to durable remissions and  the overall survival (OS) at 2  years following disease re lapse 
was < 20% [19, 20] .  Given that disease relapse is relatively common after transplant, and that few 
if any patients can be returned to durable remission once relapse has occurred, a desired goal 
would be to improve the transplant strategy and avoid the serious problem of post -transplant 
disease relapse.  
2.4 Graft Versus Tumor Reactions  
A major mechanism of cancer eradication following allogeneic HCT is the immunological -based 
recognition of residual host tumor cells by donor -derived immune cells contained in the donor 
graft .  This phenomenon, termed graft -versus -tumor (GVT) reactions, is supported by various lines 
of evidence .  The initial observations in support of GVT reactions stemmed from studies that used 
T-cell depleted (TCD) donor grafts whereby graft -versus -host disease (GVHD) was eliminated; 
however, without donor T -cells in the donor inoculum patients suffered a high incidence of disease 
recurrence [21].  The importance of GVT reactions was further demonstrated by improved disease 
control and fewer relapses following HLA identical sibling (allogeneic) transplantation compared 
to syngeneic (identical twin) transplantation for patients with hematologic malign ancies [22].  The 
three year probability for relapse of leukemia was substantially higher following syngeneic 
compared to allogeneic HCT in acute myelog enous leukemia (AML) (52%  vs 16%) and CML 
(40%  vs 7%) following treatment using full dose transplant conditioning regimens  [22].  The 
increased risk of relapse in syngeneic transplants counterbalanced the beneficial effect of the lack 
of GVHD .  Perhaps the most compelling evidence comes from the observation that the infusion of 
donor leukocytes obtained from the original donor in patients who have disease  relapse following 
allogeneic HCT resulted in a GVT effect  (23).   
2.5 Reduced Intensity Transplant Conditioning  
Following the recognition that a main mechanism of disease control after allogeneic HCT is by 
donor derived immune mediated GVT reactions, multiple groups , includ ing our own at Stanford,  
developed reduced intensity transplant conditioning (RIC) regimens that shift ed the burden of 
disease control from high doses of chemoradiotherapy to the donor immune system (24-28).  The 
low intensity transplant conditioning has allowed older patients and those with medical 
co-morbidities to proceed with transplant whereas, before these patients were excluded from 
allogeneic transplantation as the full dose conditioning regimens  were associated with prohibitive 
toxicities .  As a consequence of the low dose conditioning , host hematopoietic and immune cells 
persist and result in a  state of mixed hematopoietic and lymphoid chimerism (MC) that may 
convert to full donor chimerism (FDC ) over a variable time course  (13, 28 -30).  Importantly, the 
achievement of early (before Day 60) FDC appears to be a necessary precondition for disease 
control (13, 28 -30).  We and others have reported that irrespective of the specific type of RIC 
regimen used, the r elapse risk is significantly higher in patients with persistent MC compared to 
those with FDC, and likely reflects tolerance of donor cells to recipient tissues  (13, 28 -30).  In a 
report detailing the outcome s of 111 allogeneic HCT r ecipients from HLA -matched and single 
antigen mismatch donors following TLI-ATG conditioning for leukemia and lymphoma there was 
a very low incidence of severe ( Grade  2 to4) acute GVHD ( < 5%), and a low incidence of 
IRB-33058  Page 8 of 43 23 August 2019   non-relapse related mortality at 1 year (< 5%) (13).  Whereas almost all patients who failed to 
achieve FDC  experienced disease relapse , the actuarial event free survival was more than 5 5% in 
the patients who achieved > 95% donor type chimerism , with observations extending up to 6 years  
(13).  
2.6 Strategies to Convert MC to FDC  
Attaining FDC relatively early post-transplant  is desirable because of its significant association 
with a reduced risk of disease relapse  (13, 28 -36).  A commonly used strategy to convert MC to 
FDC has involved the use of  low dose, or escalating doses, of donor lymphocyte infusions  (DLI) at 
designated early time points post-transplant  [31-36].  These studies confirmed that prophylactic 
DLI (i.e.  before disease progression) induced conversion to FDC and was associated with  a 
reduced risk of disease relapse , yet overall survival was not improved in these trials due to the 
increased risk of significant acute GVHD  (31-36). 
In summary, disease relapse is the main cause of treatment failure following allogeneic HCT and is 
an omi nous event as most patients cannot be returned to durable remission .  A significant 
percentage of patients who receive reduced intensity conditioning remain as MC for months and 
there is a significant association of MC with increased risk of disease relaps e.  Conversion of MC 
to FDC following low dose or escalating doses of DLI was associated with a reduced risk of 
disease relapse yet OS was not improved due to the limiting toxicity of severe acute GVHD .  A 
pre-emptive strategy that would promote conversion  of MC to FDC and retain immune mediated 
GVT reactions yet without promoting GVHD has the potential to benefit patients and may improve 
the cure rate in patients following allogeneic HCT . 
2.7 Preclinical Strategies to Overcome GVHD with DLI in a Murine Mod el Memory  T-cells 
Induce Significantly Less GVHD than Naïve T -cells 
Recent murine studies showed that in many strain combinations memory T -cells, including 
memory CD4+, and memory CD8+ T-cells induce significantly less GVHD than naive T -cells 
(CD62LhiCD44lo) or combinations of naive and memory T-cells [37-43]. 
Accordingly, our group at Stanford compared freshly isolated naive CD4+, CD8+, or total T -cells, 
and/or memory CD4+CD44hi, CD8+CD44hi, and total memory T CD44hi cells from unprimed 
donors for their capacity to induce GVHD, and mediate antitumor activity against a naturally 
occurring B -cell lymphoma (BCL1) in an MHC -mismatched model where CD4 is predominant yet 
CD8 also can ind uce lethal GVHD (44).  Only the CD8+CD44hi memory T -cell subset containing 
both central and effector memory cells was capable of eradicating the lymphoma cells without 
inducing GVHD .  In contrast, CD4+ and CD8+ naïve T -cells, memory CD44hi CD4+ T -cells, 
naive total T -cells, and memory CD44hi total T -cells either induced lethal GVHD or lacked potent 
antitumor activity .  The tumor -bearing recipients of CD8+CD44hi T-cells had a clear survival 
advantage over those given CD8+ naive T -cells because of the lethal GVHD induced by the latter .  
The CD8+CD44hi T-cells were also used in a model of treatment of progressive lymphoma growth 
after BMT, and were able to promote complete chimerism and eradicate the tumor without GVHD.  
In other preclinical murine models  of bone marrow transplantation using various MCH -matched 
strain combinations conducted by our group, the only cell subset that we could identify that 
provided GVT reactions against FBL3 leukemia tumor cells without inducing lethal GVHD was 
CD44hiCD8+ memo ry T-cells [45]. 
IRB-33058  Page 9 of 43 23 August 2019   Taken together, our studies and those by others suggest that CD8+ memory T -cells will have 
retained promote donor cell engraftment and retain GVT reactions yet have markedly reduced 
GVHD capacity .  These studies support the hypothesis that  a clinical trial of infusing CD8+ 
memory T -cells may be superior to DLI for the conversion of MC to FDC following allogeneic 
HCT.  
2.8 Purification of human CD8+ memory T -cells for use as DLI therapy

pre-selection, post -CD45RA depletion, and CD8 enrichment steps and stained for 
expression of CD4, CD8, CD45RA, and CD45RO after gating on CD3+ cells.   
Since we were successful in treating progressive tumor growth after BMT without inducing 
GVHD in mice with enriched donor CD8+ memory T -cells, we attempted to purify a similar subset 
of freshly iso lated T -cells from normal humans for use in the currently planned study .  
Accordingly,  we used immunomagnetic bead separation on Miltenyi columns to enrich 
CD8+CD45RO+CD45RA- T-cells from PBMCs  (46).  First, cells were incubated with Miltenyi  
Unfractionated  CD45RA Depleted  1A 
CD45RA depleted  CD8 selected  
CD8  
IRB-33058  Page 10 of 43 23 August 2019   GMP grade anti -CD45RA mAb conjugated beads for negative selection .  Thereafter, the 
CD45RA - cells were incubated with Miltenyi GMP grade anti -CD8 mAb conjugated beads to 
positively select the CD8+ cells .  The resultant CD8+CD45RA- T-cells had over 95% pur ity as 
shown in the FACS pattern in Figure  1A that is representative of 6 independent separations .  
Almost all the CD45RA-CD8+ cells were CD45RO+CD8+.  Yields of the cells were also 
determined using apheresis products from normal HCT donors and the mean po st-enrichmen t cell 
count obtained from a single apheresis product  was 5  x 108 with a range of 3  to 8 x 108 
CD45RA-CD8+ cells.  Therefore, following 2 high volume aphereses per donor, the highest 
feasible dose of memory CD8+ T-cells available for infusion will be 10  x 108 cells.  Assuming 
most patients weigh less than 100  kg, attainable numbers of memory CD8+ T-cells for a phase  1 
dose escalation trial are 1  x 106/kg;  5 x 106/kg;  and 10  x 106/kg.  IND 014844 has been submitted 
to the FDA describing the use of manipulated donor lymphocyte infusion  (DLI) cells in clinical 
trials.  
 
In further studies the enriched CD45RA-CD8+ human memory T -cells were tested for immune 
reactivity in vitro  by stimulation with irradiated allogeneic PBMCs from normal donors.  The 
cultures were monitored for 3H -thymidine incorporation at 7  days and for IFN -γ and IL -2 
concentrations in the supernatants .  The respo nder T -cells increased the mean 3H -thymidine 
incorporation in cultures with allogeneic stimulator cells as compared to control cultures without 
allogeneic stimulators (data not shown) .  In addition, the memory CD8+ T-cell supernatants had a 
marked increase  in the concentration of IFN -γ after culture with allogeneic stimulator cells, and 
had a minimal increase in the concentration of IL -2 (Figure 1B) .  The results of the human mixed

(n = 4).  Results are shown with +/ - standard deviation  (SD) 1B 
IRB-33058  Page 11 of 43 23 August 2019   leukocyte response (MLR) experiments were consistent with the responses obse rved with CD8+ 
memory T -cells from mice .  The murine responder cells also showed a marked increase in 
3H-thymidine incorporation after stimulation with allogeneic cells, and the production of IFN -γ 
was considerably greater than that of IL -2 [46]. 
In summary, the se studies  demonstrated that an enriched population of CD8+ memory T -cells can 
be obtained from healthy human donors that in MLR experiments were consistent with the 
responses observed with CD8+ memory T -cells from mice and provided evidence for clinical 
safety (limited GVHD) and efficacy (retained GVT reactions) .   
2.9 Phase  1 Clinical Trial of CD8+ Memory T-cell Infusion for Disease Relapse after 
Allogeneic HCT  
We conducted a single institution open -labeled single treatment study evaluating the safety and  
potential efficacy of allogeneic CD8+ memory T -cell infusion derived from HLA -matched  sibling 
donors .  The phase I study followed  a standard 3+3 dose escalation format using a low CD8+ 
memory T-cell dose of 1 x 106 cells/kg , an intermediate dose o f 5 x 106 cells/kg and a final dose of 
10 x 106 cells/kg .  The objectives of the protocol were :   
1. To determine the feasibility of purifying allogeneic CD8+ memory T -cells suitable for 
clinical application and to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 
these cells in patients with recurrent or refractory hematolymphoid malignancies following 
allogeneic HCT .   
2. To determine disease response, time to dise ase progression, event -free survival, and overall 
survival following treatment with allogeneic CD8+ memory T -cells.   
3. To assess donor specific chimerism before and at designated time points after treatment 
with allogeneic CD8+ memory T -cells.  
To date, 8  patients with disease relapse after allogeneic HCT have been enrolled on the study and  
were  followed for safety and potential efficacy .  The Table below summarizes the patients .

chemotherapy her post-transplant  disease relapse .  Therefore , CD8 memory T-cells were infused at 
a time of the patient had active disease .  Post CD8+ memory T-cell infusion , the patient developed 
stable disease and was transfus ion independent for 455  days.  Fifteen months after the cell infusion 
the patient presented with leukemic cutis and declined therapy and she succumbed from 
progressive disease on Day 517 after the cell infusion.  
Patient 1.3 :  A 40 -year-old female with extr a medullary leukemia relapse 3165  days after initial 
allotransplant .  She r eceived involved field radiation therapy to the extra -medullary site of disease  
and 4  cycles of Aza cytadine  and was returned to remission .  On evaluation on 727  days after the 
CD8 memory T-cell infusion , she was alive yet had disease relapse 650  days after the cell infusion . 
Cohort 2 :  A cell dose of 5  x 106 CD8+ memory T-cells/kg 
Patient 2.1 :  A 37-year-old with AML who had disease relapse 169  days after allogeneic 
transplant from a matched sibling donor .  The patient r eceived 7+3 re -induction with cytarabine 
and Daunorubicin and  failed  to achieve a remission .  Thereafter the patient r eceived 2  cycles of 
G-CLAC (G-CSF, clofarabine and c ytarabine)  and achieved  a marrow remission with incomplete 
blood count recovery .  Following the CD8+ memory T-cell infusion the patient continued in 
remission  with normal blood counts for 9  months and thereafter had chemorefractory resistant 
recurrence and expired fr om AML 418  days after the cell infusion.  
Patient 2.2 :  A 60-year-old who underwent allogeneic HCT from a matched sibling donor for blast 
crises CML and developed a return of chronic phase CML 1829  days after transplant .  The patient 
was returned to a complete remission with d asatinib and at last follow up continues in complete 
remission, 435  days after the CD8+ memory T-cell infusion.  
Patient 2.3 :  A 53-year-old with multiply recurrent high risk CLL who had disease progres sion 
545 days post allotransplant that progressed on salvage benda mustine -rituximab , and was treated 
to a stable disease  using 3 cycles of FCR  (fludarabine , cyclophosphamide,  and rituximab ).  Shortly 
(32 days) after receiving the CD8+ memory T-cell infusion the patient had progressive disease and 
was transitioned to best supportive care and died 89  days after the cell infusion.  
Cohort3 :  A cell dose of 10  x 106 CD8+ memory T-cells/kg  
Patient 3.1 :  A 61 -year-old woman with refractory AML at start of  allotransplant  conditioning 
despite several attempts to achieve remission using 3 different induction regimens .  The patient 
had progressive AML 65 days post allotransplant and received salvage FLAG ( fludarabine , 
high-dose cytarabine , G-CSF) chemotherapy and continued with refractory disease .  For her 
IRB-33058  Page 13 of 43 23 August 2019   refractory disease t he patient was i nfused with 7.8 x 106 CD8 memory T-cells/kg, instead of the 
desired cell dose of 10  x 106cells/kg .  The patient continued with progressive disease and was 
transitioned to b est supportive care and died 42  days after the cell infusion.  
Patient 3.2 :  A 67 -year-old man with overl ap Myeloproliferative Disease and Myelodysplastic 
syndrome who on azacitidine progressed to AML .  He failed to receive remission despite 2 course s 
of induction cytarabine and daunorubicin and underwent allogeneic HCT using his HLA -matched  
sibling donor .  He had progressive AML 236  days after transplantation and received several cycles 
of re-induction chemotherapy  using vorinostat with temozolomide yet his  disease failed to 
respond .  He received a CD8 memory T-cell donor lymphocyte infusion for his refractory disease; 
the dose of cells was 8  x 106 CD8  memory T-cells/kg, instead of the desired 10  x 106 CD8 memory 
T-cells/kg.  At last follow -up 185  days after the cell infusion , the patient continues with a stable 
low level of AML and has not received additional chemotherapy .   
Two adverse events, considered unrelated to the infused cell product were noted . 
Patient 3.1  had neutropenia prior to the cell in fusion and continued with neutropenia after the cell 
infusion .  The neutropenia was related to active AML .  Eighteen  days after the CD8 memory 
T-cell infusion , the patient developed a fever that was  treated to resolution with short course broad 
spectrum in travenous antibiotics and anti -fungal therapy .  All cultures were negative .  The reported 
adverse event was most likely UNRELATED to the investigational product .  The serious adverse 
event ( SAE ) was reported to MedWatch on 6 November  2013 .   
Patient 3.2  had neutropenia prior to the cell infusion and continued with neutropenia after the cell 
infusion .  The neutropenia was related to active AML .  The patient  developed fevers 33  days after 
the cell infusion .  Imaging studies at the time revealed probable ne w onset pneumonia .  The 
pneumonia was treated to resolution with broad spectrum antibiotics .  A bronchoscopy revealed 
light growth of MSSA .  The patient  completed a full course of rocephin, azithromycin, and 
fluconazole .  The PCP stain was negative .  The p atient continues with active AML .  The adverse 
event was most likely UNRELATED to the investigational product.  
2.10 Lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide  to promote CD8+ memory T -cell expansion 
and persistence  
Lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide administered several days prior to DLI has been shown 
to promote in vivo expansion and persistence of the infused donor lymphocytes  by providing 
lymphoid space, eliminating anti -donor immune reactivity, and reducing co mpetition for growth 
factors that promote expansion of the infused T -cells [47-49]. Lymphodepletion with 
cyclophospham ide is thus routinely utilized prior to the infusion of various autologous or 
allogeneic  cellular therapies where it has been shown to aug ment the antitumor activity of 
unmanipulated DLI  [50, 51] , chimeric antigen receptor -modified T cells  [52, 53], and adoptively 
transfer red tumor -specific T cells [54, 55] . We therefore propose administer ing a single dose of 
cyclophosphamide 1.5 g/m2 intrav enously  3-5 days prior to the CD8+ memory T -cell infusion in 
order to promote further expansion and persistence of the cells,  augment GVT activity , and reduce 
relapse rates.  
 
IRB-33058  Page 14 of 43 23 August 2019   The Cell Processing and Quality Assurance  data are highlighted below .  
Cell Processing Summary  
 
CD8+ memory T -cell Quality Assurance Assessment  
 
 

IRB-33058  Page 15 of 43 23 August 2019   From the clinical trial the following observations are made  
1. The CD8 memory T-cell infusion was not associated with any infusion  related  toxicities , or 
related adverse events such as the development of GVHD , or other.  
2. The CD8 memory T-cell infusion appeared to have some efficacy  albeit  patients who have 
relapse of disease after allogeneic transplant h ave a  poor overall survival  at < 20% at 
2 years [19, 20] .  Among the 8 patients treate d, one  patient continues in CR more than 
2 years after the CD8 memory T-cell infusion, one patient with  untreated relapse  continued 
with disease that did not progress and transfusion independence  for > 1 year, and 
2 additional patients remain alive but wit h disease relapse with observations extending to 
beyond a year.  
3. Although no toxicities were observed at any dose, t he maximum cell dose of 
10 x 106 CD8+ memory T-cells/kg is not a feasible  dose for use in a clinical trial  due to our 
inability to obtain this high number of CD8 memory T-cells.  Rather , a dose of 
5 x 106 cells/kg is readily obtainable from all donors.  
2.11 Study  Rationale  
The administration of CD8+ memory T-cells at doses of ≤ 10 x 106 cells/kg did not result in 
GVHD, or other related adverse events .  The persistence of mixed hematopoietic cell chimerism is 
associated with a significantly high risk of disease relapse after allogeneic HCT [13, 28 -36].  Once 
the patient’s disease has rela psed after allogeneic HCT, the likelihood for long -term survival is 
poor.  Therefore, a strategy that can help promote conversion of mixed to complete hematopoietic 
cell chimerism prior to disease relapse, and does not promote significant GVHD has the pote ntial 
to help improve the outcomes of allotransplant recipients by reducing the risk of disease relapse .  
The goal of the current proposed trial will be to determine if CD8+ memory T-cells administered 
prophylactically and prior to disease  relapse can conv ert patients with mixed chimerism at 
30 to 75 days after transplant to complete chimerism .  We hypothesize  that patients who convert 
from mixed to complete chimerism will have a reduced rate of relapse similar to patients who are 
complete chimeras .  This s tudy will follow a single arm Simon  2-stage trial principle .  In 
Simon  stage  1, we will enroll 8 patients , and if 3  or fewer  patients respond, defined as the 
conversion from mixed to complete chimerism within 90  days of the CD8+ memory T-cell 
infusion, we will stop for futility .  If 4 or more  respond in Simon  stage  1, then in stage  2 we will 
continue to enroll a full sample of 20 patients and declare success if a total of 11 or more  patients 
respond .  The time frame for the CD8+ memory T-cell infusion will be between 30 to 75 days after 
transplant, and all patients will continue with the planned immune suppression drug taper to 
discontinuation at 6  months after transplant providing no  GVHD is observed .  The primary 
endpoints will be safety and determination of the rate of conversion from mixed to complete donor 
chimerism .  If > 2 patients among the first 6 enrolled experience any new Grade  3 to 4 toxicities or 
> 2 patients develop Grade  3 to 4 GVHD during the 60 days following the CD8+ memory T-cell 
infusion, we will de -escalate the dose  to 1 x 106 CD8+ memory T-cells/kg.  Based on our 
preclinical data that CD8+ memory T-cells do not aggravate GVHD, and the data from the clinical 
phase 1 trial we do not expect toxicities at a dose of 5  x 106/kg.  Secondary endpoints will include 
the risk of acute and chronic GVHD, freedom from disease progression, event -free and overall 
survival, and the relapse rate .  The goal is to improve the rate of attaining complete chimerism 
without increasing the  risk of G VHD .  If following the Simon 2 -stage trial the results are 
IRB-33058  Page 16 of 43 23 August 2019   lncouraging, we will expand our experience to a broader trial to determine if the infusion of CD8+ 
memory T-cells is associated with significantly lower rates of disease relapse.  
Study Design  
This is a single institution open -labeled single treatment study evaluating the safety and efficacy of 
allogeneic CD8+ memory T -cell infusion derived from HLA -matched  sibling donors .  Enrollment 
of 18 patients is expected to be completed in less than  3 years .  The study will involve a single 
non-randomized intervention arm of administering 5  x 106 cells/kg CD8+ memory T -cells 
30 to 75 days after allogeneic HCT using TLI ATG conditioning .  The total duration of patient 
study participation is 6 months .  Patients will be followed indefinitely for all out comes including 
survival, event -free survival and late complications such as but not limited to late chronic GVHD 
and infections.

Donors must be the HLA -matched sibling  who served as the donor  for the allogeneic trans plant .  
Within 7  days of cell collection, donors will be screened to confirm eligibility .  Screening will 
consist of the following evaluations and procedures .   
- A transplant physician together with the study coordinator will review the prior  medical 
record that was performed for the initial transplant . 
- Under the direction of the study coordinator, d onors will fill out  a standard Stanford  BMT 
self-assessment  form that highlights all new medications prescribed from the time of initial 
donation, as well as any new medical diagnosis or surgeries . 
- Any newly prescribed medication , new medical diagnosis , or surgery since the time of the 
initial collection for transp lant will initiate a formal medical re-evaluation.  
- If no new medications or new diagnosis have occurred, and no surgery, then just as what is 
done for the NMDP and collection of a DLI, the prior medical evaluation will suffice 
providing it is ≤ 120 days from date of initial medical evaluation to the date of starting the 
CD8+ memory T-cell collection.  
Documentation of  vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, weight ). 
Donors will be evaluated with the following laboratory tests  within 14  days of starting apheresis 
for the collection of CD8+ memory T-cells:   
• CBC with complete blood count.  
• Clinical chemistry assessments including sodium, potassium, chloride, creatinine, random 
glucose, total calcium, total protein, albumin, total bil irubin, alka line phosphatase, SGOT, 
SGPT .   
• A coagulation profile including PT and PTT  
• Female donors of child -bearing potential will undergo serum HCG testing which must be 
negative to proceed.  
IRB-33058  Page 19 of 43 23 August 2019   Donors will be screened within 7  days of the CD8  memory  T-cell collection to confirm eligibility 
by undergoing repeat testing for : 
• Hepatitis  A, B and C, HIV -1 and -2, HTLV, VZV, EBV, HSV, West  Nile virus, Syphilis 
Treponema, T  cruzi (Chagas), CMV , and the MPX  NAT  IDT (HIV/HCV/HBV) will be 
tested as per national standa rd of care guidelines for transplant  donors.  Donors who are 
HIV-positive will be excluded.  Donors who are positive by serology for Hepatitis  B or C 
are eligible as long as PCR for RNA/DNA is negative.  
• ABO/Rh will be performed.  
Once donors have been appro priately screened, they will proceed to cell harvest .   
3.6 Informed Consent Process  
A conference will be held with the patient and family to discuss this study and alternative 
treatments available for treatment of the underlying disease .  The attending physician will conduct 
the conference .  All potential risks associated with the use of TLI, ATG, immunosuppressive drugs 
and allogeneic hematopoietic cell infusions including and CD8+ memory T-cell cells will be 
discussed as objectively as possible .  It will be explained that patients offered this protocol have an 
underlying malignancy that render them either at  high risk of relapse or that will result in life 
expectancies of several months to no more than one to two years with conventional treatments .  
These patients would be unlikely to benefit from, or tolerate an autologous transplant, and are at 
high risk of early transplant mortality from conventional allogeneic transplant .  Informed consent 
from the patient will be obtained using a form approved by th e Administrative Panel on Human 
Subjects in Medical Research of the Stanford University Medical Center .  The participant will 
receive a copy of the signed and dated consent document .  The original signed copy of the research 
consent document must be retain ed in the subject’s  research  file.   
3.7 Study Timeline  
It is exp ected the study will accrue 7  patients per year and therefore the target goal of 20 patients 
will be completed within 2.5 years of the study opening.  
Patients will be followed for 6 months after the mobilized  PBSC infusion on Day  0.  Patients’ 
End-of-Study Visit will be scheduled for approximately Day  180 post -PBSC infus ion, +/ - 3 weeks.  
Therefore , it is expected the study will be complete within 36 months of opening .  All p atients will 
be followed for outcomes  beyond the  6 months study observation period for determination of 
secondary outcome measures and as per institutional standards for transplant patients .

4.2 Apheresis  
HLA -matched donors will undergo unmobilized apheresis  for collection of CD8+ memory T-cells.  
Sufficient numbers of cells will be obtained following 1  to 2 apheresis procedures on consecutive 
days such that the targe t cell dose at the end of the selection will be achieved .  Plasmapheresis, 
including volumes and frequency of collections, will b e in accordance with 21 CFR §640.65.   
4.3 Cyclophosphamide lymphodepletion  
Patients will receive  a single dose of cyclophosphamide 1.5 g/m2 intravenously over 2 hours as 
lymphodepletion  3-5 days prior to the CD8+ memory T -cell infusion  in order  to promote further 
expansion and persistence of the infused T cells (see section 2.10).  
4.4 Administration of Study Drug  
Selected CD8+ memory T -cells meeting the release criteria (described below) will be infused no 
more than 48 hours after the harvest .  CD8+ memory T -cells will be taken to the recipient and 
infused fresh without cryopreservation .  The cells will be infused through a central venous  catheter 
or peripheral IV of at least 1 9 gauge .  CD8+ memory T -cell infusion will take place over 10  to 20 
minutes, just like unmodified DLI.   
IRB-33058  Page 21 of 43 23 August 2019   IN Patients will be monitored for vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate) every  
30 minutes following infusion and for at least two hours afterwards with evaluation every 
30 minutes .  WHO toxicity will be performed as described .  Recipients will be monitored for 
infusion  related  toxicities  and treated as needed .  Premedication  is not required and , if possible, 
should be avoided .  If clinically indicated, Benadryl and Tylenol can be given as needed .  Benadryl 
and will be utilized should a reaction occur and epinephrine and solumedrol will be available at the 
bedside.  
4.5 Criteria for Removal from S tudy  and not proceed ing with the Planned CD8+ memory 
T-cell Infusion  
All adverse events will be reviewed by Stanford Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee  (DSMC) and patients will be removed from the study for the following reasons:  
• Excess toxicities are observed  such as acute GVHD  beyond Grade  2 skin or upper GI tract 
only GVHD , uncontrolled infection or organ performance status not meeting criteria for 
cell infusion.  
• Any other c concurrent  illness that prevents further administration of CD8  + memory T-cell 
Infusion  
• Non-compliance with the protocol (defined as inability to receive all scheduled treatments, 
follow -up appointments, and tests)  
• Patient request to withdraw f rom the study  
The number of patients who do not receive the planned CD8 memory T-cell infusion will be 
followed .  If for any reason more than 1 of the first 3 patients , or more than 2 of the first 6  patients , 
or more than 3 of the first 10 patients do not receive the planned infusion, the trial will temporarily 
close pending  a DSM C audit to determine the cause .  A patient enrolled on the trial but who does 
not proceed with the planned infusion will be replaced with another enrolled patient as the goal is 
to evaluate 20 patients who receive the CD8+ memory T-cell product.  
4.6 Alternatives  
Alternative therapies will be discussed with each patient and would potentially include allogeneic 
transplantation using TLI and ATG conditioning without a planned CD8+ memory T-cell infusion 
or allogeneic transplantation using other transplant conditioning or other investigational therapies, 
or best of care non -transplantation therapy . 
4.7 Compensation  
There will be no compensation for participation on study.  
5. INVESTIGATIONAL AGENT  INFORMATION  
5.1  Investigational Agent   
CD8+ Memory T -Cell Selection  
The patient’s original HLA -matched  donor will undergo apheresis with collection of blood 
mononuclear cells as for standard DLI .  No mobilization agents will be administered .  Donor 
CD8+/CD45RA - T-cells will be isolated by tandem immunomagnetic selection using the 
CliniMACS Cell Selection System (Miltenyi Biotec) .  Depletion of CD45RA expressing cells uses 
CliniMACS CD45RA Reagent (BB -MF-11872) .  The CD45RA depleted fraction is enrich ed for 
IRB-33058  Page 22 of 43 23 August 2019   CD8 expressing cells by positive cell selection with CliniMACS CD8 Reagent (BB -MF-11704) .  
In our phase  1 study, we evaluated the CD45RA-CD8+ cell yield from 8 normal donors that 
underwent either 1 or 2  apheres es.  The mean starting TNC count was 6.8 x 1010, the mean 
post-CD45RA depletion cell count was 4.5 x 1010, and the mean post -CD8 enrichmen t cell count 
was 6 .6 x 108 with a range of  1.5 to 18.0 x CD45RA-CD8+ cells.  The lower end range cell yields 
were in donors who underwent 1 ap heresis and the higher end range cell yields were following 
2 consecutive days of apheresis .  In combination, w e completed 4  validation runs, combined with 
8 donor runs for the phase  1 protocol, our efficiency of percent CD8+ memory T-cell recovery has 
dramatically increased from < 20% to > 50%.  Therefore, following 1 or 2 consecutive days of  
aphereses per donor, we have data to validate that we will achieve the targe t cell dose of 5  x 106 
CD8+ memory T-cells/kg for all patients, a ssuming most patients weigh less than 1 20 kg.  If the 
number of CD8+ memory T-cells be below the desired threshold of 5  x 106/kg, the infusion will 
proceed as planned  as the  aggregate data support the importance of conversion from mixed to 
complete chimerism to de crease the risk of post -transplant disease relapse  (13, 28 -36).  Therefore 
we believe it is in the  patient’s best interest to receive  the additional cell infusion as this has the 
potential to help achieve complete chimerism .  It is expected that a cell yield of less than the 
desired cell dose will be obtained less  than 10% of the time.  
Stability  
Prior to initiating the phase  1 study we completed four validation runs and found  > 90% viability 
based on the immediate post selection viability .  We also have stability data on the 4  validation 
runs that extend to 48 hours of storage and found minimal loss in cell viability and all validation 
products continued with > 90% viability .  The phase  1 study added stability data from an  
additional 8 donors that extend ed to 48 hours of storage and confirmed > 94% viability in all cases .   
Reagents for cells for immediate release and conditions for storage  
For post selection products infused the same day the Miltenyi Biotech Selection Buffers that 
contain PBS with 1mmola r EDTA a nd 0.5%  HSA will be used .  The CD8 and CD45 reagent 
systems are pharmaceutical grade and both have Master Files which are BB -MF-11704 and 
BB-MF-11872, respectively .  For post selection products that will be stored for 24  or 48 hours 
prior to infusion , the product will be diluted  for storage with 1 volume of Normosol -R with 
2% HSA .  For patient comfort the volume will be reduced to < or equal to 200 mL and the 
CD8+memory T-cell concentration will range between 1  x 106 to 1 x 108 cells/mL.  The overnight  
storage temperature will be 4  degrees Celsius.  
Release Requirements of the Product  
Release of the selected cell products for fresh infusion includes:  
• negative Gram staining (no organisms detected)  
• endotoxin levels ≤  0.5 EU/ milliliter of infused product volume  
• > 90% cell viability  
• ≥ 80% of the CD3+ cells express the CD8 memory T-cell phenotype, here defined as 
CD8+/CD45RA -/CD45RO+  
• ≤ 5% of cells with the CD3+/CD45RA+/CD45RO - phenotype  
• sufficien t cells with the CD8 memory T-cell phenotype to meet th e desired dose, or at least 
the minimum dose of > 2 x 106 CD8+ memory T-cells/kg 
IRB-33058  Page 23 of 43 23 August 2019   Release Criteria for products stored 24 or 48 hours :  due to the logistics of donor cell collection, 
cell processing and patient schedule, it is possible that some products may be stored for 24 or 48 
hours before their infusion .  Cell viability >90% is required for infusion of products not being 
stored .  Release criteria for products stored 24 or 48 hours require >80% viability as assessed by 
trypan blue or 7-AAD dye exclusio n. 
In addition, post -selection sterility cultures in accordance with s terility testing guidelines 
(21CFR §610.12) will be conducted to confirm the sterility of the selected cells .  Any positive 
growth results obtained will be documented in the processing re cord of the selection and 
immediately communicated to the patient’s attending physician in accordance with the plan of 
action for the infusion of cellular products with microbial contamination .  Ancillary studies may 
include phenotypic analysis of the sele cted cells and cytokine secretion profiles from MLR assays 
may be used to further our understanding of the CD8+ memory T -cell population characteristics 
but do not constitute release criteria at this time.  
If the cell product does not meet release criteria  after manipulation , the produ ct will not be infused .  
In the  case(s) where the manipulated cell product does not meet release criteria , the donor may 
undergo subsequent apheresis procedure(s) to collect a new product in an attempt to achieve a 
releasable fresh product for infusion .  If at any dose level the minimum cell dose is not achieved 
the patient and donor may be taken  off study .  A patient removed from the study due to a failure to 
achieve the minimum CD8+ memory T -cell dose will be replaced with an other patient.  
5.2 Availability  
CD8+ memory T-cell products will be prepared in the Stanford Blood and Marrow Transplantation 
Cellular Therapy Facility  under the direction of labo ratory director, Kevin  Sheehan,  PhD.  
Dr Sheehan oversaw the manufacturing of the CD8+ memory T-cells for the phase 1  trial. 
5.3 Agent Accountability  
CD8+ memory T-cells meeting the release criteria will be administered according to the 
instructions specified in the approved study protocol .  Infusions will be prepared and administered 
by a trained person designated by the investigator in response to orders written by the investigator.  
6. DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
The primary endpoints will be safety and determination of the rate of conversion from mixed to 
complete donor chimerism .  In the first 6  enrolled patients  (i.e., infused with CD8+ memory 
T-cells), if > 2 patients experience any new Grade  3 to 4 toxicities, or > 2 develop Grade  3 to 4 
GVHD during the 60  days following the CD8+ memory T-cell infusion, we will de -escalate the 
dose to 1 x 106 CD8+ memory T-cells/kg.   In the first 12  enrolled patients, if >  3 patients develop 
Grade  3 to 4 GVHD during the 60  days following the CD8+ memory T -cell infusion , or after the 
first  12 enrolled patients if > 4 patients develop Grade  3 to 4 GVHD during the 60  days following 
the CD8+ memory T -cell infusion , the dose will be de -escalated as per above.   
7. ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING PROCEDURES  
7.1 Adverse Events  
Hem atopoietic cell transplantation  (HCT) is an aggressive therapy for the treatment of a number of 
life-threatening disorders, including cancer.  In this setting, a very large number of Grade  1 and 2 
adverse events  (AEs) are expected to occur, regardless of whether or not a patient is parti cipating 
in a research study.  In order to minimize the “background  noise” and to focus on 
IRB-33058  Page 24 of 43 23 August 2019   clinically  significant, impactful adverse events useful in the assessment of treatment effect, the 
following AE reporting schema is proposed.  This schema is intende d to capture all AEs that are 
clinically  significant and/or impactful, but minimize “not  informative” AE  collection.  
• Grade  3 and higher AEs will be collected and documented with causality attribution 
(see Section  7.2 Adverse  Event  Attribution ) on an adver se event log (AE  log).   
• In addition, all AEs meeting the criteria of “serious” as defined at 21CFR§312.32(a), 
including  any that are otherwise Grade  1 or 2,  will be collected ;  identified as serious;  and 
documented on an AE  log, including causality attri bution .   
o An adverse event is considered serious if it fulfills one of the following criteria per 
21CFR§312.32(a):  
▪ Results in death  
▪ Life-threatening (patient at risk of death at the time of the event)  
▪ Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
▪ Results in persistent or significant disability  
▪ Other medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death 
or hospitalization by may jeopardize the patient or require intervention to prevent 
one of the out comes listed above  
• Laboratory values without a clinical consequence or outcome will not be tracked as 
adverse  events, unless deemed serious.  
• Grade  1 and 2 AEs not meeting these criteria will not be collected , except as follows.  
Grade  1 and 2 AEs result ing in subject dose modification (including dose termination)  or 
withdrawal from the study  will be collected . 
All Serious Adverse Events  (SAEs) will be tracked until resolution or at least  60 days after the last 
dose of the study treatment.   
Vital  signs for a ll subjects  enrolled on the trial will be monitored for infusion -related toxicities 
(AEs) during the CD8 memory T -cell infusion, and every 30  minutes for 2  hours after wards.  
Observed events will be recorded on the AE  log.  In particular, subjects  will be observed  for 
hemodynamic instability, allergic  reactions ( eg, hives, rashes, angioedema), and fevers 
(> 38.3º  po).  
The development of acute GVHD, its date of onset  and overall grade , is a key secondary outcome 
measure for patients on this trial.  Please refer to Section  6 “Dose  Modifications” that highlight the 
safety rules with respect to GVHD development.  Acute GVHD will be recorded on an AE  log.  
7.2 Adverse Event Attribution  
As noted, HCT is an aggressive therapy for the treatment of cancer, and a large number of AEs are 
expected in this setting, including a number of specific AEs that are associated with the underlying 
disease;  therapies administered prior to HCT;  health st atus of the transplant recipient including 
co-existing conditions;  the preparative regimen for transplant;  concomitant therapies intended to 
reduce transplant -related complications (eg,  immunosuppressants for the prevention of GVHD);  
and treatment for complications of HCT.   
IRB-33058  Page 25 of 43 23 August 2019   The Protocol Director  (PD) or designee will assess each Adverse Event  (AE) to determine whether 
it is unexpected according to the Informed  Consent, Protocol  Document, or 
Investigator’s  Brochure, and related to the investigation.  Unless specifically determined otherwise 
by the investigator, the following events are considered anticipated in this setting.  
• Alopecia  
• Anemia  
• Anorexia  
• Bleeding , including  requiring transfusions  
• Cardiac arrhythmias   
• Central venous catheter infections  
• Constipation  
• Diarrhea  
• Edema  
• Fatigue  
• Febrile episodes  
• Gastritis  
• Graft failure  
• Graft versus host disease  
• Hematuria   
• Hypertension  
• Hypotension  
• Hypoxia  
• Incontinence  • Infections, including sepsis  
• Insomnia  
• Laboratory abnormalities  
• Mental status changes and mood alterations  
• Mucositis  
• Nausea  
• Neutropenia  
• Pain  
• Pleural effusion  
• Pneumonitis  
• Rash  
• Seizures  
• Sinusoidal obstructive syndrome  
• Tachycardia  
• Thrombocytopenia  
• Thrombotic microangiopathy  
• Tremor  
• Vomiting  
7.3 Adverse Event  Reporting  
All serious adverse events (SAEs) related to study procedures will be collected from signing of 
informed consent through CD8+ Memory T -cell infusion.   Adverse events, both non -serious and 
serious, will be collected as outlined in Section 7.1 fro m date of CD8+ Memory T -cell infusion 
through 60 days.   Beyond 60 days post -cell infusion, SAEs related to study treatment will be 
collected through the Week 2 0 follow -up visit.  
All serious adverse events  (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB;  to the IND;  a nd to the DSMC , 
either in an annual review or as an expedited report, in accordance with the applicable guidelines 
and regulations.  
AEs meeting the criteria specified for an IND  Safety  Report as defined at 21CFR§312.32(c)(1) 
will be collected;  documented  in the adverse event log;  and reported to the IND (on a 
MedWatch  3500A form)  in the timeframe specified.  
The IND annual report will include summaries of the collected AEs, as specified by 
21CFR§312.33.

IRB-33058  Page 27 of 43 23 August 2019   10. MEASUREMENT and STATISTICAL METHODS  
Our extensive experience with the TLI ATG conditioning for allogeneic HCT in cancer patients 
showed a 30% incidence of FDC  at Day 90, with a 95% confidence interval of 10  to 49%.  The 
non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 3% (95% CI :  0 to 14%) at 100  days and 6% (95% CI :  
1 to 28%) at 1 year.  The i ncidence of acute GVHD by Day 100 was 6% ( 0.7 to 22%).  
10.1  Primary and Secondary Outcome measures  
Following the infusion of CD8+ memory T-cells to promote the conversion of mixed chimerism to 
full donor chimerism and ultimately reduce the risk of disease relapse a variety of outcome 
measures will be followed.  
The primary outcome is to determine the proportion of patients with full dose donor chimerism 
within 3  months of receiving the CD8+ memory T-cell infusion.   Successful conversion from 
mixed to complete chimerism is defined as achieving ≥ 95% donor type in the CD3+ lineage or 
whole blood within 90  days of cell infusion.    
The secondary outcome measures include the 1 year time -to-disease  progression ;  
overall  survival  (OS);  and event -free survival  (EFS);  and non -relapse mortality .  The incidence of 
acute and chronic GVHD following the infusion of allogeneic CD8+ memory T-cells will be 
determined.  
Recipients will be monitored for infusion  related  toxicities a nd the  rates of GVHD or marrow 
aplasia .  Typically following an unmanipulated DLI the timing for acute GVHD or marrow 
hypoplasi a onset is  about  30 days post-infusion  [32-38].  GVHD, if it occurs, will be treated 
promptly .  First line therapy will include corticosteroids at a dose of 1 -2 mg/kg depending upon 
severity .  Additional immunosuppressive medications will be add ed as clinically indicated .   
Evaluations will be performed to assess infusion related toxicity according to the following :   
• Post-infusion toxicity evaluations (including physical exam, vitals, and weight) will be 
performed on days +7 ;  +14;  +28;  and weeks  8;  12;  20;  and 26 (+/- 5 days for the first 
4 weeks post-infusion ;  +/- 14 days for date s thereafter)  using CTCAE  v4.0.   
• STR analysis will be performed prior to the CD8+ memory T -cell infusion (within  35 days 
prior) and then will follow the  sched uled events calendar assessment vis its until 6 months 
post-transplant . 
• GVHD will be according to Appendix  B for GVHD Grading .   
• CBC performed within 7 days prior to the CD8+ memory T -cell infusion and then will follow 
the scheduled events calendar until  6 months.  
• Chemistries including Albumin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, calcium, chloride, 
creatinine, glucose, potassium, total protein, AST, ALT, and sodium  will be performed within 
7 days prior to the cell infusion and thereafter follow the sch eduled events calendar  until 6 
months .   
• The level of tumor burden will be evaluated at 3 and 6 months after transplant  by standard 
imaging and  blood evaluation procedures specific for the patient disease  (refer to 
Appendix  C). 
Beyond 6  months all p atients will be followed as per standard as per our institutional practice  for 
HCT recipients (on average about every 6  weeks until 12  months post -transplant and regularly 
IRB-33058  Page 28 of 43 23 August 2019   thereafter) and data and laboratory tests including disease burden assessment will b e recorded to 
determine the 1  year overall  survival  and event -free survival, NRM and for the development of 
infections and chronic GVD.  
11. REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1 Institutional Review of Protocol  
The protocol , the informed consent and all forms of participant information related to the study 
(eg, advertisements used to recruit participants) will be reviewed and approved by the Stanford 
IRB and Stanford Cancer Center Scientific Review Committee (SRC) .  Any changes made to the 
protocol will be submitted as a modification and will be approved by the IRB prior to 
implementation .  The Protocol Director will disseminate the protocol amendment information to 
all participating investigators.  
11.2 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
The Stanford Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be the 
monitoring entity for this study .  The DSMC will audit study -related activities to determine 
whether the study has been conducted in accordance with the protocol, local standard operating 
proce dures, FDA regulations, and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) .  In addition, the DSMC will 
regularly review serious adverse events and protocol deviations associated with the research to 
ensure the protection of human subjects .  Results of the DSMC audit will b e communicated to the 
IRB and the appropriate regulatory authorities at the time of continuing review, or in an expedited 
fashion, as needed.  
11.3 Data Management Plan  
The Protocol Director, or his designee, will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate participant 
case histories with observations and data pertinent to the study .  The Stanford BMT data 
monitoring team along with the study coordinator will collect the information required in the Study 
calendar of events and maintain records for data analys is.  The data  will be reviewed by the study 
PI for accuracy against source document data.  
11.4 Confidentiality  
Patient records will be kept in a secure location at Stanford University Medical Center accessible 
only to research authorized personnel .  Patient identity will be kept as confidential as possible as 
required by law .  The patient will not be identified by name, social security number, address, 
telephone number, or any other personal direct identifier .  Study patients will be assigned an 
ident ification code .  Information about the code will be kept in a secure location and access limited 
to research study personnel .  The results of this study may be presented at scientific or medical 
meetings or published in scientific journals, however patient  identity will not be disclosed .  
Personal data included in the investigators’ database will be maintained in compliance with all 
applicable laws and regulations.  
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Statistical Analysis  
Analysis of 50 consecutive previous patie nts with persistent mixe d chimerism after HCT using 
TLI-ATG conditioning confirmed the observed rate of conversion to complete chimerism without 
IRB-33058  Page 29 of 43 23 August 2019   an additional cell infusion was 2 5% (n = 12), and assume the upper limit of conversion is likely 
35%.  The sample size determination for the clinical trial will follow a single arm Simon  2-stage 
trial principle, with a null hypothesis of 35% (p0), and an alternative hypothesis of 70% (p1).  We 
will use a significance level of 0.05  () and power of 0.9  (1-).  In Simon  stage  1, we plan to 
enroll 8 patients and if 4 or more  patients respond by converting to complete chimerism we will 
proceed to stage  2 where we will continue to enroll a full sample of 20 patients and declare success 
if a total of 11 or more  patients respond .  We will not start enrollment in  Simon  stage  2 until at 
least 3 successes are observed . 
Patients will receive a CD8+ memory T-cell infusion 30  to 75 days after their initial HCT .  The 
desired dose of CD8+ memory T-cells will be 5 x 106 cells/kg .  It is fully expected this dose will 
be safe and not provoke or increase the risk of GVH D or other complications .  In the phase  1 trial 
we infused this dose, or exceeded it, in 5  patients and observed no infusion related, early or late 
toxicities . 
Patients will be evaluated for toxicities,  defined as new Grade  3 to 4 toxicities, according to the 
Common Toxicity Criteria  v.4 and Grade  3 to 4 GVHD (Appendix  B) during the 60  days 
following the CD8+ memory T -cell infusion .  If 2 of the first 6  patient s develop DLTs, the dose 
will be lowered to 1 x 106 CD8+ memory T-cells/kg.  If 2 of the first 6  patients infused with this 
lower dose develop DLTs , then the trial will be stopped for safety  reasons.  
For the first 3 enrolled patients , the CD8+ memory T -cell infusion will be staggered by at least a 
30-day interval between patients to allow for an assessment of DLTs for each patient .  Thereafter , 
if no DLTs are observed , the CD8+ memory T -cell infusion will be staggered by 10-day intervals 
between patients .  For added safety , if there is any incidence of a DLT observed the wait period 
will be extended to 60  days between the patients .   
If a Grade  5 toxicity or death occurs and is at least likely related to the cell infusion , the trial will 
stop.  Considerat ion for trial modifications will depend on institutional IRB and DSM C reviews .  
The appropriate regulatory offices including FDA will be notified within 5  business  days of such 
an event.  
Statistical considerations for the revised protocol  
 
We have infused phenotypic CD8+ memory T cells in a total of 29 patients (as a treatment in 15 
patients who had disease relapse after transplant, and as a prophylactic intervention in 14 patients 
with mixed chimerism to convert to  complete chimerism to re duce the risk of subsequent disease 
relapse).  We have confirmed the safety; there have been no infusion reactions, and no grade 3 or 
higher adverse events attributable to the infusion, and no aggravation or precipitation of acute 
GVHD.  
 
We now propose to amend the protocol by administering a single dose of cyclophosphamide 
(1500mg/m2 BSA) 2 -5 days prior to the CD8+ memory T cell infusion. The primary reason to 
amend the protocol to include cyclophosphamide is the desire to take advantage of the new clinica l 
and pre -clinical information available that strongly suggests an increase in efficacy (success rate) 
with the addition (see section 2.10 in the revised Protocol). In addition to the obvious ethical 
impetus to provide trial participants with the optimal v ersion of an experimental treatment, we note 
a scientific rationale: since the use of cyclophosphamide in this context will very likely become the 
new standard prior to infusing a cellular therapy, it is advisable to adapt our protocol to that reality.  
IRB-33058  Page 30 of 43 23 August 2019    
The compelling ethical and scientific rationale notwithstanding, we must remain attentive to the 
extra assumptions required for statistical integration of the data from the patients treated without 
Cyclophosphamide early in the study and those treated with Cyclophosphamide after the change. 
Here is a review of the new design, the main issues it raises, and the analysis that led us to our new 
strategy:  
 
1. The original Simon optimal, 2 -stage design was predicated on a historical control success rate of 
35% an d an alternative success rate of 70%. There is no reason to alter the historical assumption. 
We propose a new embedded but independent 2 -stage design (see below for details) with a single 
arm treated with the addition of Cyclophosphamide to the current reg imen, predicated on an 80% 
alternative. The 10% increase in the alternative is based on the pre -clinical and clinical results 
cited above.  The original design entertained a Type 1 error rate of 5% and a Type 2 error rate of 
10%; in the new embedded trial we allow a 10% Type 1 error rate (which is more usual in phase 2) 
and retain the 10% Type 2 error rate.  
 
2. We considered simply finishing the trial with the remaining 6 patients in the original design now 
being treated with cyclophosphamide, which would address the ethical dimension. However, the 
interpretation of a positive result would rest on an assumption that the alternative under 
Cyclophosphamide cannot be less than that without Cyclophosphamide. This is a reasonable 
assumption, but at the end of th e trial we would likely not have strong evidence to support it, so the 
interpretation would still rely on a largely untested assumption. In addition, we would have little 
new evidence for safety, always an important consideration. By adding only 2 patients  to the entire 
study, we are able to treat up to 8 patients with the Cyclophosphamide -containing regimen, which 
leads to the 2 -stage design (details below) predicated on the 80% alternative assumption.  
 
Why is this better? We have converted an assumption necessary for interpretation  of a positive 
overall result into an assumption that drives the design  of the embedded trial whose results will test 
the assumption at high power  (90%). A positive result in the embedded trial is statistically definite, 
once it  is completed, since the design assumption has been subject to test.  A positive independent 
result in the embedded trial will buttress the overall result obtained by pooling the initial 14 and 
new 8 patients and calculating the one -sided 95% lower confide nce limit for the success rate. It 
should be noted that because the embedded trial “stands alone” and does not include the initial 
cohort of patients treated without Cyclophosphamide, the fact that the interim results in the initial 
patients are known does  not affect the type 1 error of the embedded trial.  
 
3. The details of the embedded trial: Assuming a 35% historical control rate, and an 80% 
alternative, for 10% Type 1 and 2 error rates, the Simon optimal 2 -stage design calls for a first 
stage with 2 pa tients, going on if there is at least 1 success, to the second stage with a cumulative 
total of 8 patients, rejecting the historical control rate (declaring a positive result) if there are at 
least 5 successes out of 8.

1. Abstract  
Heart failure (HF) affects almost 6 million people in the US, leading to significant  morbidity, 
mortality and an impaired quality of life. Additionally, there are an estimated one million HF -
related hospitalizations every year in the US, resulting in an estimated $30.7 billion in both direct 
and indirect costs. Despite recent advances in pharmacological and nonpharmacological HF -
targeted therapies, HF -associated hospital admissions have not declined. Accordingly, 
consideration needs to be given to managing HF -associated comorbidities in an effort to reduce 
morbidity, mortality, and decreas ed quality of life associated with HF.  
 
Poor sleep quality is a prevalent complaint in the HF population with an estimated 70% of HF 
patients chronically experiencing at least one of the following three symptoms:  1) difficulty falling 
asleep; 2) difficul ty maintaining sleep; 3) or early morning awakenings. Several studies have 
demonstrated an increased prevalence of poor sleep quality in HF patients. Moreover, poor sleep 
quality is  associated with a reduction in health -related quality of life (HRQOL) in H F patients. 
Poor sleep quality has several physiological sequelae including  increased sympathetic activity and 
perturbations of the hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal (HPA) axis.  Consequently, patients with poor 
sleep quality may exhibit increased heart rates ,  reduced heart rate variability, increased blood 
pressure and increased risk of arrhythmias, all of which have an unfavorable effect on HF. 
Furthermore, with chronic stimulation of the HPA axis, there is an increased risk of development 
of hypertension, diabetes, and even cardiovascular disease.  Eventually, the biological 
consequences of poor sleep can potentially compound the already stressed cardiovascular system in 
HF patients, leading to progression of HF and in turn, cause further deterioration in s leep quality, 
thereby creating a perpetual cycle.   
 
The limited available evidence intimates that improving sleep quality in patients with HF may 
improve morbidity and quality of life in this patient population. However, there is a paucity of 
evidence ass essing the use of effective pharmacologic therapies in HF.  The nonbenzodiazepine, 
GABA receptor agonist, zolpidem, has been found to have considerable benefits over  traditional 
benzodiazepi nes as a soporific medication. We hypothesize that by improving sl eep architecture, 
zolpidem , a nonbenzodiazepine, GABA receptor agonist, will decrease the propensity for central 
SDB events by decreasing the frequency of arousals and preventing associated decreases in pCO2 
below the apneic threshold.

2. Objectives (include all primary and secondary objectives)  
a. Characterize and compare sleep parameters  in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction 
(HFrEF ) in the setting of zolpidem tartrate vs placebo. Specifically, we will compare:  
i. Sleep latency (m in), Total Sleep Tim e (min) and  Sleep Efficiency (%)  
ii. Proportion of NREM vs REM sleep (%)  
b. Determine if improvements in sleep quality correlate with improvement in sympathovagal 
balance  
c. Investigate whether zolpidem tartrate subjectively improve s insomnia symptoms and health -
related quality of life (HRQOL)  in HFrEF  
d. Examine how zolpidem in heart failure patients with poor sleep quality impacts heart rate 
variability  
 
3. Background  (briefly describe  pre-clinical and clinical data, current experience with procedures, 
drug or device, an d any other relevant information to justify the research ) 
 
The increased prevalence of poor sleep quality or insomnia in HF patients has been demonstrated in 
several studies. In one study of 84 HFrEF patients, 56% reported trouble sleeping and 33%  of the 
patients  reported using a sleep aid,  most commonly used were benzodiazepines, followed by 
zolpidem . To date , there has been only one study investigating the tolerability of zolpidem in 
patients with HF.  This study, involving 15 patients with ischemic card iomyopathy ( EF < 45% ) and 
NYHA class I or II HF , investigated  the effects of Zolpidem MR (zolpidem modified released)  on 
sleep and nocturnal ventilation in patients with HFrEF .  Participants underwent full 
polysomnography in a placebo -controlled, double -blind randomized trial. Zolpidem MR was well 
tolerated  and increased total sleep time by 16% in this study . There was no change in the apnea -
hypopnea index or respiratory disturbance index . We propose to expand on the very limited 
prevailing evidence on sopo rific use in the setting of HF. By prescribing zol pidem tartrate 5 mg in 
the proposed study ( a shorter half -life form of the zolpidem at the lowest available dose), we aim to 
optimize patient sleep quality  and minimize potential side effects . The principal  investigator for the 
proposed study is a board -certified sleep physician who has years of experience with soporific 
medication use and potential adverse effects.   
 
4. Study Procedures  
a. Study design, including the sequence and timing of study procedures    
(distinguish research procedures from those that are part of routine care ). 
The proposed study will be a randomized, parallel, placebo controlled, double blind study. 
We aim to enroll 50 participants. Potential subjects will be asked about sleep difficulty as  outlined 
in the inclusion criteria. Qualifying p articipants will be randomized to receive either placebo or 
zolpidem tartrate 5 mg for a period of 7 days . Zolpidem is routinely used in a clinical setting for the 
treatment of insomnia. The placebo pill wil l be given as part of the research protocol.  
Patients will complete four questionnaires including the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) 
questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Kansas City Cardiomyopathy questionnaire  
(KCCQ) , and the Epworth Slee piness Scale (ESS) , at the baseline visit  and upon completion of the 
study . All four questionnaires are per formed both in the clinical and research settings.   
 
A self -applied home sleep monitor will be given to the subjects at the baseline visit after 
obtaining consent. The home sleep study will be repeated once between days 3 -7. Home sleep 
studies are routinely performed in clinical practice. To reduce burden and enhance convenience, 
subjects will also be offered the option to have two (2)  members from ou r study team deliver the 
equipment to their residence and assist in set -up.

b. Study duration and number of study visits required of research participant s. 
 
The duration of the study will be  8 days total . Participants will be required to complete three  in-
person  study visits  and two  home sleep stu dies. The first  in-person visit  will be a baseline visit,  
prior to randomization , to obtain consent, describe the study , address questions, complete 
questionnaires, and dispense the home sleep monitor. The estimate d time for this visit is 
approximately  60 minutes. The following day, patients will be randomly assigned to either receive 
zolpidem tartrate or placebo. This visit will take approximately 20 minutes. The subject will then 
either pick up or be mailed the ho me sleep monitor to repeat the home sleep study between days 3 -
7. The second in-person visit will be  on day 8 after completion of the intervention. This visit should 
last approximately 45 minutes. During this visit, the subject will repeat the questionnair es.   
  
c. Blinding , including justification for blinding or not blinding the trial, if applicable.  
Participants and investigators will be blinded  to the study drug and placebo  to avoid bias.  
 
d. Justification o f why participant s will not receive routine  care o r will have current therapy 
stopped.  
Participants  will receive routine care for HF with continuation of all their current therapy.    
 
e. Justification for inclusion of a placebo or non -treatment group.  
Placebo medication is necessary to provide a control grou p for comparison between the 
intervention (zolpidem tartrate) and no intervention without inducing bias.  
 
f. Definition of treatment failure or participant  removal criteria.  
Participant Removal Criteria:  
 Patient request  
 Side effects from the intervention  that are intolerable to the subject  
 A significant c hange in clinical status such as hospitalization  
 
g. Description of what happens to participant s receiving therapy when study ends or if a 
participant ’s participation in the study end s prematurely.  
 Patients wil l discontinue the study drug and remain on all prior medications  
 Patients can decide with their healthcare provider about treatment for sleep -related 
issues, including medication use.

6. Drugs/ Substances/ Devices  
a. The rationale for choosing the drug and dose or for choosing the device to be used.   
Zolpidem tartrate is FDA approved for the treatment of insomnia. It is has a quick onset of 
actio n (typically with 30 minutes) . Additionally, zolpidem’s short half -life of 2.4 hours along 
with the fact that it does not have an  active metabolite, make it relatively safe with less residual 
drowsiness  and impairment of psychomotor and cognitive function  compared to other soporific 
agents. Zolpidem’s preferential binding to the α -1-GABA A receptor with specific sedative -
hypnotic activity  and less respiratory depressant effect make it a safer choice for insomnia.  The 
minimum dose of zolpidem has been chosen (5 mg) as this the recommended dose for women 
and the elderly. This dose was also chosen to ensure that the minimum dose was used in the 
setting of HF . 
 
b. Justification and safety information if FDA approved drugs will be administered for non -FDA 
approved in dications or if doses or routes of administration or participant  populations are 
changed.  
N/A  
 
c. Justification and safety information if non -FDA approved drugs without an IND will be 
administered.

a. Primary outcome variable . 
Total Slee p Time (min)  
 
b. Secondary outcome variables . 
1. Sleep Efficiency (%)  
2. Sleep latency (min)  
3. Proportion of NREM vs REM sleep (%)  
4. Change in ISI, ESS, PSQI and KCCQ  between baseline and final visits  
 
c. Statistical plan including sample size justification and inte rim d ata analysis.  
We estimate that we will need to enroll 20 participants i n each arm in order to see and effect of 
16% increase for the primary outcome variable  of total sleep time . Thus, 25 in each arm would 
allow for about 20% dropout in sample.  Student’s unpaired t -test will be used to examine the 
mean difference for total sleep time between the two groups with intention to treat analysis.  
 
d. Early stopping rules.

8. Risks  
a. Medical risks, listing all procedures, their major and minor risks and expected fre quency.  
Questionnaires : There are no risks to completing the study questionnaires.  
 
Overnight Home Sleep Study : There are no major risks with a sleep study. Rarely, some 
individuals may experience minor redness or irritation at the site of the monitoring electrodes.  
 
Zolpidem Tartrate  Use: The following are the most common potential risks of taking zolpidem 
tartrate  are headache, residual drowsiness the next day, and dizziness, occurring in less than 
10%. Cardiovascular risks occur in less than 1 -2% and in clude palpitations, chest discomfort, 
edema, orthostatic hypertension. Sleep related activities such as sleep walking and sleep eating 
have been seen and occur in less than 1% of individuals.  
 
b. Steps taken to minimize the risks.  
 The dose of zolpidem tartra te which will be used for the proposed research is the minimal 
dose. It is the recommended dose for females and the elderly, and the lower end of the 
recommended dose for males.  
 A member of the study team will place a call to each subject  within 72 hours of the initiation 
of the medication to review any potential side effects.  
 All patients will be provided with  a contact number to call with questions or concerns  
 The drug will be given only for short term use, for a total of 7 doses.  
 
c. Plan for reporting u nanticipated problems or study deviations.  
Any adverse event will be reported to the IRB by the PI.  
 
d. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach of confidentiality.  
Breach of confidentiality would result in unauthorized individuals h aving access to information 
about the participant’s medical history. Several different measures will be undertaken to protect 
participant confidentiality. Paper files will be in locked file cabinets. Access to any 
computerized information will be restricte d to the study investigators or associated staff. 
Participant data will be stored with unique identifiers and will be password protected.

None  
 
 
9. Benefits  
a. Description of the probable benefits  for the participant and for society . 
There  are no direct benefits to subjects participating in the study. However, w e hypothesiz e 
that the admini stration of zolpidem tartrate to patients with HF will improve sleep quality  
without negatively affecting  respiratory status during sleep . Additionally, improvements in 
sleep quality in HF patients will possibly lead to a better health -related quality of l ife in 
these patients.

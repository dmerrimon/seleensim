Study Rationale
The platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha ( PDGFR antibody  olaratum ab in 
combinat ion with doxorubi cin dem onstrated a si gnificant improvement in overall survival ( OS)
over doxorubicin alone in pat ients with advanced soft ti ssue sarco ma(STS) (Tap et al. 201 6).
Since so me pat ients may not be appropriate candidates for doxorubicin -based chemotherapy , or 
have received prior anthracycline treatment, exploring olaratumab co mbinat ions with other 
chemotherapeut ic agents that are often used in STS treatment is of considerable interest.  Study  
I5B-MC-JGDL is a mult icenter Phase 1b /2 study  ofolaratum ab in co mbinat ion with gemci tabine 
and docetaxel in pat ients with advanced or m etastati c STS, notamenable to treatment with 
surgi cal resect ion or radi otherapy  with curative int ent.  The first part (Phase 1b) of the study  will 
consist of an open -label, single -arm, 
dose-escalat ion assessment of the safet y and tol erabili ty of 
olaratum abadministered at 15mg/kg(Days1 and 8) or20mg/kg(Days1 and 8 ) with 
gemcitabine (900 mg/m2[fixed dose rate :  10 mg/m2/minute] Day s 1and 8 ) and docetaxel (75 
mg/m2Day 8), of a 21 -day cycle.  After the dose of o laratumab in co mbinat ion with gemci tabine 
and docetaxel has been determined from the analysis of the Phase 1b pa rt, the Phase 2 , 
rando mized, double -blinded , placebo -controlled partof the study  will open to enrollment.
Approximately  256 pat ients will be rando mized in Phase 2 in a 1:1 ratio to Arm  A (olaratum ab 
plus gemcitabine and docetaxel ) or Arm  B (pl acebo pl us gemci tabine and docetaxel).

assessment of the association between clinical variables, such as histological subtypes, and clinical 
outcomes
Study Design:   This trial is a Phase 1b open -label, dose -escalation part followed by a randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled Phase 2 study of olaratumab plus gemcitabine and docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic STS, not amenable to treatment w ith surgical resection or radiotherapy with curative intent .  In the Phase 
1bpart, 2 cohorts (15 mg/kg or20 mg/kg) will be studied to determine the olaratumab dose that may  be safely  
administered in combination with gemcitabine and docetaxel.   After the dose ofolaratumab in combination with 
gemcitabine and docetaxel has been determined from the Phase 1b part, the Phase 2 part of the study will open to 
enrollment .  In Phase 2 ,approximately 256 patients will be randomized 1:1 , in a doub le-blinded manner, to Arm A 
(olaratumab plus gemcitabine and docetaxel) or Arm B (placebo plus gemcitabine and docetaxel). Randomization 
will be stratified by prior treatment with olaratumab (yes versus no), number of prior systemic therapies for locally
advanced or metast atic disease (0 versus ≥1), histological tumor type (leiomyosarcoma versus non -
leiomyosarcoma), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ( ECOG PS )(0 versus 1),and prior
pelvic radiation (yes versus no).   Patients will continue treatment unt il there is documented disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, death, or other discontinuation criteria are met.
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusions:   Patients at least 16 years of age, ECOG PS 0 to 1, 
gemcitabine anddocetaxel naïve, with histologically confirmed, locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic STS, 
and not amenable to curative treatment with surgery or radiotherapy .  Patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor or 
Kaposi’s sarcoma will be excluded.  Patients previ ously enrolled in Study I5B-MC -JGDJ or any other blinded study 
with olaratumab are not eligible to participate in this trial.
Test Product, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:   
Olaratumab: injection for intravenous (IV) use, supplied in single -use 500 mg/50 -mL vials containing 10 mg/mL of 
product in histidine buffer, administered to patients as an IVinfusion over approximately 60 minutes
For the Phase 1bpart: Olaratumab will be administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg on Days 1 and 8 of each 
21-day cycle.
For the Phase 2 part : Olaratumab will be administered at the dose determined by the analysis in the Phase 1b part 
on Day s1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle.
Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration:
For the Phase 1b and 2 part s:
Gemcit abine is a commercially available product and should be stored, reconstituted ,and discarded per 
manufacturer’s instructions .  Gemcitabine isadministered at a dose of 900mg/m 2over approximately 90 minutes 
(fixed dose rate:  10mg/m2/min
ute) on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day  cycle.
Docetaxel is a commercially available product and should be prepared and administered according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions.   Docetaxel  is administered at a dose of 75 mg/m2(IV) over approximately 60 minutes 
on Day  8 of each 21-day cycle.
For the Phase 2 part :
Placebo:   injection for IVuse, supplied in single -use vial s, administered to patients as an IVinfusion over 
approximately 60 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 5
LY3012207Planned Duration of Treatment:   Treatment continue suntil there is evidence of disease progression, death, 
intolerable toxicity, or other withdrawal criteria are met . In the event of permanent discontinuation of 
olaratumab/placebo therapy due to an olaratumab/placebo -related toxicity, patients may continue on gemcitabine 
and docetaxel treatment per protocol .  If either gemcitabine or docetaxel are permanently discontinued due to 
toxicity, the patient should discontinue active treatment with the gemcitabine/docetaxel combination.  Howev er, the 
patient may continue treatment with olaratumab/placebo alone , at the discretion of the investigator.  Any changes in 
treatments being added to or removed from patient care will be recorded on the eCRF.
Short -term follow -up (postdiscontinuation):   30 days (±7 days)
Long -term follow -up (postdiscontinuation): Patients that discontinue study treatment for reasons other than 
progression will be followed every 6 weeks (±7 days) until progr essive disease ( PD), thereafter ever y 3months 
(±7days)for the f irstyear, then ever y 6 mo nths (±14 days )until the patient’s de ath o r overall study completion.
Continued access:   After study completion, patients on study treatment who continue to experience clinical benefit 
and no undue risks , in the opinion of the investigator, may continue to receive study treatment until one of the 
criteria for discontinuation is met .  A continued access follow -up visit will occur 30 days (±7 day s)after 
discontinuation.
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 6
LY3012207Criteria for Evaluation
Efficacy:   Overall survival (time f rom randomization to death) is the primary per -patient measure for efficacy in the 
Phase 2 p art.
Radiographic assessments according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 criteria, will be 
performed every 6 weeks (±7 days) until radiographic documentation of PD.
In the Phase 2 part, t he following additional efficacy measures will be determined for each patient, with planned 
statistical analyses specified in Section 12 and in the statistical analysis plan (SAP; a separate document) .  Specific 
definitions of each of these measures (such as defining events and censoring for each time to event endpoint) will be 
provided in the SAP.
progression - free survival (PFS)
objective response rate (ORR)
disease control r ate (DCR)
time to first wo rsening of the mBPI-sf (Brief Pain Inventory Short Form Modified) “worst pain” score
time to any progression (censoring for death without progression)
time to any new metastases (censoring for death and for other type of PD)
new-metastases -free survival (n MFS)
time to any progression based solely on increased sum of target lesions
time to sustained worsening of The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of 
Life Que stionnaire Co re 30 Versio n 3.0 (EORTC QLQ -C30) scale scores (for example, Global Health Status / 
Quality  of Life score, Physical Functioning score, and Role Functioning score)
time to first worsening of ECOG PS
second PFS (PFS2) after end of study treatment while on subsequent anticancer therapy
Safet y:
Phase 1b : will inc lude a Cycle 1 dose-limiting toxicity  (DLT )evaluation period
Phase 1b and 2: Safety will be evaluated based on reported adverse events (AEs), physical examinations, vital 
signs, laboratory tests ,andelectrocardiograms (ECGs) .  Adv erse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA ®) and graded using the National Cancer Institute -Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.0.  Clinical laboratory toxicity will be graded using NCI 
CTCAE criteria, Version 4.0.
Patient
-Reported Outcomes (PROs):   Pain will be assessed with the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form Modified 
[mBPI -sf], HRQoL will be assessed with the EORTC QLQ -C30 and he alth stat uswill be assessed with the EuroQol 
5 Dimension 5 -Level (EQ-5D-5L).  Patients will complete the instruments on Day 1 of ever y cycle and at the 
30-day  short - term follow -up visit.  For those patients who discontinued for reasons other than PD, afull due 
diligence will be taken to collect PRO measures during long -term follow -up,every 6 weeks [±7 days] until PD .
Immunogenicity:   Blood samples will be collected to evaluate immunogenicity at baseline, during the study , and at 
the30 day follow -up visi t.  In the event of an olaratumab/placebo infusion -related reaction (IRR), serum will be 
collected asclose as possible to the onset of the IRR, at the resolution of the IRR , and 30 day s (±3 days) after the 
IRR.
Pharmacokinetic s:
Phase 1b : PK parameters, such as maximal concentration (C max),time of C max(tmax), area under the concentration-
time curve (AUC ), volume of distribution at steady state (Vss), clearance ( CL), and half-life ( t1/2)for olaratumab, 
gemcitabine and its metabolite (dFdU ),and docetaxel
Phase 2 : Population PK parameters for olaratumab
Biomarke rs:  Assessment of the association between biomarkers and clinical outcomes
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 7
LY3012207Statistical Methods:
Statistical:
Efficacy:   Phase 2: The primary objective is to compare OS in olaratumab -naïve patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic STS treated with olaratumab plus gemcitabine and docetaxel versus placebo plus gemcitabine and 
docetaxel.  Patients will be randomized 1:1 to the 2treatment arms.  The intent ion-to-treat (ITT) sample size of 166 
for olaratumab -naïve patients (83 in the experimental arm and 83 in the control arm) was selected assuming the 
final analysis of OS will occur after 108 OS events have been observed (35% censoring).     
The final total of 108OS events in the olaratumab -naïve patients (deaths) provides 80% statistical power for a two -
sided log -rank test at a 0. 20significance level (assuming the true OS hazard ratio [ HR]is 0.665).  An OS HR of 
0.
665corresponds approximately to an increased median surviv al from 15 mo nths (estimated from published 
clinical data in various types of patients with locally advanced or metastatic STS) in placebo plus gemcitabine and 
docetaxel to 2 2.5 months for olaratumab p
lus gemcitabine and docetaxel.
An additional 90 olara tumab-pretreated patients (45 in the experimental arm and 45 in the control arm) will be
randomized to compare the same regimens as a secondary objective.   
The primary efficacy outcome for the Phase 2 part of the study is OS in the olaratumab -naïve cohort of the ITT 
populatio n.  A nalysis of OS will be based on the stratified log rank test, stratified by the 3of the 4 randomization 
strata; that is, number of prior systemic therapies for locally advanced or metastatic disease (0 versus ≥1), 
histological tumor type (leiomyosarcoma versus non -leiomyosarcoma) ,and ECOG PS (0 versus 1) .
Overall survival curves, the median with 95% confidence interval ( CI)and survival rates at various time points for 
each treatment group will be estimated using Kapl an-Meier method (Kaplan and Meier 1958).  The HR will be 
estimated using a stratified Cox regression model, stratified by the aforementioned 3 randomization strata. All ITT 
populatio n will be included in the analysis of this endpoint. The same OS analyse s will also be performed 
separately for the olaratumab -pretreated cohort of the ITT population.  
Safety:   The s afety analy ses will be performed on the safety population defined as all enrolled patients in Phase 1b 
and all randomized patients in Phase 2, who received at least 1 dose, including a partial dose, of any study  
treatment .
In the Phase 1b part, DLT will be summarized by cohort in the patients who are evaluable for DLT assessments and 
be listed by patient.   For Phase 1 b and Phase 2 ,the incidence s of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) by 
maximum CTCAE grade that occurred during the study treatment period or within approximately 30 days after the 
decision is made to discontinue study treatment will be summarized .  Additionally, for Phase 1b and Phase 2 the 
following (but not limited to) safety -relate d outcomes will be summarized: study treatment discontinuation due to 
TEAEs, deaths during the study treatment period or within 30 days after the decision is made to discontinue study 
treatment, treatment -emergent serious adverse events during the study treatment period or within 30 days after the 
decision is made to discontinue study treatment, hospitalizations, and transfusions during the study treatment period 
or within 30 days after the decisi on is made to discontinue study treatment.
Adverse events, including TEAEs, will be listed and summarized in frequency tables using MedDRA.  Severity of 
AEs will be grade d using CTCAE version 4.0.  Other safety data, such as laboratory tests, ECGs ,and vital signs ,
will be listed and summarized, if appropriate.
Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs):   For each instrument (mBPI -sf, EORTC QLQ -C30, and EQ -5D-5L), 
percentage compliance will be calculated as the number of completed assessments divided by the numbe r of 
expected assessments.  Data will be separately summarized using descriptive statistics.  Analyses of time to 
worsening of pain as well as HRQoL scales will be conducted.
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 8
LY3012207Immunogenicity : Incidence of treatment -emergent anti-olaratumab antibodies and any  additional related assays will 
be tabulated.  Correlation to olaratumab drug level, efficacy , and safety  will be assessed, as appropriate.
Pharmacokinetics:
Phase 1b part: the PK parameter estimates for olaratumab, gemcitabine and its metabolite (dFdU) ,and docetaxel
will be calculated by standard noncompartmental methods.  Descriptive statistics will be calculated for PK 
parameters, but no formal statistical analysis is planned.
Phase 2 part: PK parameters for olaratumab ( CL, exposure, Vss, and t1/2) and inter -individual PK variability will be 
computed using nonlinear mixed effect modeling implemented in NONMEM.   Gemcitabine, dFdU ,and docetaxel
plasma levels will be reported using descriptive methods.
Explo ratory  biomarkers:   Assay results wil l be summarized and correlated with clinical outcomes.
Interim analysis :
There will be safety interim reviews for both Phase 1b and Phase 2 parts.  In addition, aninterim efficacy analys is is
planned for the Phase 2 part of the study.
The safety review for Phase 1b will be conducted by Lilly clinical research personnel.  The study investigators and 
the Lilly clinical research physician /clinical research scientist (CRP/CRS) will make the determination regarding 
dose escalation based upon their review of the safety/tolerability data and the PK data from the previous cohorts. In 
addition, an interim safety review will be conducted prior to proceeding to Phase 2 including safety andPK.
An independent data monitoring committee (iDMC) will be established to conduct Phase 2 safety interim reviews.  
The first iDMC meeting to review interim data will occur when approximately 60 patients (approximately 30 
patients from each arm) have received at least 2 cycles of treatment or discontinued all st udy treatment due to any 
reasons prior to Day 8 in Cycle 2.  Subsequent iDMC meetings will occur regularly thereafter.
Aninterim efficacy analys is isplanned for the Phase 2 part of the study.  After observing 40 OS events among the 
olaratumab -pretreated cohort of the ITT population, interim analysis will occur .  Any  positive interim efficacy 
results may be used for planning of additional separate clinical studies, but will not be used to modify the design 
and conduct of this current trial.

5.Introduction
5.1. Soft Tissue Sarcoma
Soft tissue sarco ma (STS) is a heterogeneous group of malignant tumors that ari se from tissue of 
mesenchymal origin .  Sof t tissue sarco maarises primarily from the embry onic m esoderm , with 
some neuroectodermal contribut ion and different iation to non -epithelial extraskeletal t issue,
including striated skeletal  and smooth muscle, adipose, and fibrous tissue ( Sharma et al. 2013; 
D’Angelo et al. 2014 ; Linch et al. 2014 ).  There are approximately 50 different types of  STS that
can be found in almost any anatomic location (American Cancer Society 2014; Linch et al. 
2014).  STS is rare,comprising approximately 1% of adult cancers . The annual  incidence o f 
STS in the United Kingdo m (UK)and United States ( US)is 3300 and 10,000
, respectively
(Jemal et al .2009; Nat ional Cancer Institute 2013 ).  A multidisciplinary  setting wit h teams 
specializing in the treatm entof STS is the best treatm ent approach for these tum ors.  
Management oflocalized disease is usually wit h curative intent ,using surgical resect ion with or 
without radi otherapy  and chemotherapy.  In spite of init ial aggressive management , there is a 
frequent recurrence of local inoperable or metastatic disease , and at thispoint sy stemic therapy  
plays a prominent role in the mult idisciplinary  management of STS (Linch et al. 2014 ).
The mainstay  therapy for treating advanced -stage STS has bee n chemotherapy , which in the 
first-line setting has provi dedoverall  response rates of approximately 25% (Linch et al . 2014).  
Even with the use of chemotherapy , advanced -stage STS is usually fatal and there remains a
need for novel and effect ive therapies .  
Doxorubicin either alone or in combinat ion has served as 
the init ial treatm ent for metastatic sarcoma for many years .  Vari ous other drug combinat ions 
have also been explored (Linch et al . 2014) .
In recent y ears, som e groups have reported that the combination o f gemci tabine plus docetaxel  is 
effect ive against metastatic STS
due to its broad spectrum of act ivity and has a favorable toxicit y 
profile (in co mpar ison with doxorubicin and ifo sfamide) (Ravi et al . 2015) .  Maki  et al  (2007)
studi ed the combination of gemci tabine plus docetaxel v ersus gemcitabine alone in 122 patients 
with metastati c STS .  In this study , gemci tabine (fixed dose rate of 900 mg/m 2on Days 1 and 8)
in combinat ion withdocetaxel (100 m g/m2on Day 8) yielded alonger progression -free survival
(PFS) (6.2months versus 3 months) and overall survival (OS) (17.9 months versus11.5 m onths ) 
when compared to gemcitabine alo ne.The most commo n Commo n Termino logy Criteria for 
Adverse Even ts (CTCAE )
Grade 3 to 4 toxicit y was thrombocy topenia (38%). Grade 3 to 4 
thrombocy topenia was 35% and 40% in the gemcitabine (N=49) and gemcitabine plus docetaxel 
(N=73) arm s,respect ively (Maki  et al . 2007).
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 24
LY3012207In the randomized Phase 3 trial of doxorubicin versus intensified doxorubicin plus ifo sfamide for 
first-line treatment of advanced or metastatic STS (Judson et al. 2014), doxorubicin in 
combinat ion with ifosfamide had a higher overall response (ORR) (26% versus 14%) and a 
longer PFS (7.4 mo nths versus 4.6 months) ,although there was no significant difference in OS. 
The m ost comm on Grade 3 to 4 toxicit y in the combinat ion arm  was febrile neutropenia (46%). 
Ifosfamide -related Grade 2 encephalopathy  occurred in 2% (4 of 224) of patients and 
ifosfamide -related Grade 3 encephalopathy  occurred in 4% (10 of 224 ) ofpatients. Only 5cases 
of treatm ent-related renal dysfunct ion occurred, all in the doxorubicin plus ifosfamide arm
(Judson et al. 2014).
Hensley  et al  (2008 a, 2008b )studi ed the combin ation of gemci tabine and docetaxel in patients 
with le
iomyosarcomas(LMS) .Gemcitabine was administered ata fixed dose rate of 900 mg/m2
over 90 minutes on D ays 1 and 8 while docetaxel was administered at 100 mg/m2on D ay 8. 
Object ive response rates w ere36% and 27% when the combinat ion was used as first -line and 
second -line agents ,respectively. When the combinat ion was used as first -line therapy (N= 42 ; 
Hensley  et al  2008b ), myel osuppressio n was the major toxicit y: neutropeni a Grade 3 in 5%of 
patients , Grade 4 i n 12%; anemia Grade 3 in 24%; and thrombocy topeni a Grade 3 in 9.5%, 
Grade 4 in 5%. Fatigue was Grade 3 in 17% of patients .  When the combinat ion was used as 
second -line therapy (N= 51 ; Hensley  et al . 2008a), the predominant toxicit y was unc omplicated 
myelosuppressio n: thrombocy topenia Grade 3 (29%), Grade 4 (10.4%); neutropenia Grade 3 
(12.5%), Grade 4 (8.3%) ;anemia Grade 3 (20.8%), Grade 4 (4.2%). While pulmo nary toxicity 
was reported, no patient had drug -related pneum onitis/hypoxia -typetoxicity.
AFrench study  group (Pautier et al .2012) compared
,prospectively ,the gem citabine and 
docetaxel co mbinat ion to gem citabine m onotherapy  in advanced LMS after anthracycline failure. 
In a group of 90 patients ,they confirmed the efficacy  of bothregimens ;the 3-month PFS rate s in 
the gem citabine monotherapy  arm and gemci tabine pl us docetaxel  arm 
were57% and71% in the 
uterine group and 68% and 53% in the non -uterine group, respectively ,with no si gnificant 
difference between the 2arms .
A more recent Phase 2 study (N=44) conducted in first -line metastatic / advanced LMS pat ients 
in London demonstrated that gemcitabine plus docetaxel  is an active regimen with 70.5% and 
59.1% pa tients with no progressi on at 3 and 6 months , respectively (Seddon et al . 2015a ).The 
most commo n Grade 3 or 4 toxicit ies were fat igue (30%), anemia (24%), dy spnea (16%), 
neutropeni a (12%), and infect ion (any, 12%). Thrombocy topeni a Grade 3 or 4 was 7%
(Seddon et al. 2015a )
.In a recent ly completed randomized Phase 3 tri al of gemci tabine pl us 
docetaxel ver sus doxorubi cin in the first-line treatment of pat ients with unresectable or 
metastati c STS, the re was no statistical difference in the 6-month PFS rate, median PFS , and OS 
between the 2 treatm ent arms (Seddon et al. 2015b) .Gemcitabine was administered at a fixed 
dose rate of 675 mg/m 2on Day s 1 and 8 while docetaxel was administered at 75 mg/m 2on 
Day 8.Significant Grade 3 to 4 toxicit ies include dfebrile neutropenia o f 20.3% and 11.9% in 
the doxorubicin (N=128) and gemcitabine pl

(1.28 [95% confidence interval { CI}0.98-1.67]; p=0.07), it was concl uded that doxorubicin
remains a first -line standard and confirmed gemcit abine/docetaxel activ ityinpatients with 
unresectable or metastatic STS (Seddon et al. 2015 b).
5.2. Olaratumab Background
Olaratum ab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G su bclass 1 (IgG1) -type m onoclonal 
antibody  that binds to platelet -derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα ).  Thi s ant ibody
possesses high affinit y binding for PDGFRα and blocks platel et-derived growth factor 
(PDGF) -AA, -BB, and -CC fro m binding to the receptor. In addition to blocking ligand -induced 
cellmitogenesis and receptor autophosphorylat ion, olaratumab inhibits ligand -induced
phosphorylat ion of the downstream signaling mo lecul es Akt and mitoge n-activated protein
kinase (Loizos et al . 2005; Study  Report IMC -3G3- 01).
In norm al mesenchymal bi ology,PDGF/PDGFR signaling has a significant role in mesenchymal 
stem cell different iation, growth of mesenchymal cells, angiogenesis ,and wound healing 
(Andrae et al . 2008; Ng et al . 2008 ;Li et al . 2014). PDGF/PDGFRα signaling has been 
implicated in the pathogenesis o f mu
ltiple cancers, including osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, 
prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and others.  In malignant disease, the 
PDGF/PDGFRα axis prom otes tumor growth and proliferat ion through both autocrine and 
paracrine mechanisms.   PDGFRα is expressed on stromal cells, as well as the cancer cells 
themselves, wi thin certain tum ors.  Furthermore, studies have shown that PDGF/ PDGFRα 
signaling affects tumor vasculature through paracrine mediat ion of vascular endothelial growth 
factor production (Shah et al. 2010).   Addit ional inform ation is available in the olaratumab 
investigator’s brochure (IB).
5.3. Study Rationale
The rando mized Phase 2 part of Study I5B-IE-JGDG ([JGDG; [IMCL CP15 -0806] ; olaratum ab 
plusdoxorubicin versus doxorubicin alo ne)met its protocol -defined primary  endpoint of PFS .  
The combinat ion of o laratumab and doxorubicin (investigational arm) in this trial showed a 
statist ically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in median OS (11.8 -mont
h 
improvement; HR=0.463; p=0.0003) over doxorubicin alo ne(control  arm).  Furtherm ore, in the 
primary  analysis (using the intent ion-to-treat [ITT] population based on in vestigator assessment), 
the study  met the protocol -defined final significance level for PFS (2- sided alpha=0.1999). The 
combinat ion of olaratumab and doxorubicin improved median PFS by 2.5 months over 
doxorubi cin alo ne(stratified HR=0.672 [95% CI: 0.442 , 1.021]; p=0.0615 ), corresponding to a 
32.8% reducti on in the risk of progression or death.  Grade ≥3 treatment -emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) were reported in 79.7% of patients in the invest igational arm and 69.2% of 
patients in the control  arm.  Grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs) occurring in at least 10% of patients 
intheinvest igational arm included neutropenia (consolidated term ; 54.7% [invest igationalarm] 
versus 33.8% [control arm] ), anemia (consolidated term ; 12.5% versus 9.2%),and febrile
neutropeni a(12.5% versus 13.8%) .  Although the incidence of neutropenia was increased in the 
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 26
LY3012207investi gational arm, the combinat ion of o laratumab and doxorubicin did not result in an 
increased overall incidence of febrile neutropenia or infect ions.  In gen eral, t heoverall safety 
profile of the co mbination o f olaratum ab and doxorubicin was consistent with the known 
toxicities of doxorubicin.
While doxorubicin alo ne or in combinat ion has been the mainstay  of treatm ent for decades, 
(Linch et al. 2014), in mor e recent y ears, g emci tabine pl us docetaxel  has demo nstrated to be an 
effect ivetreatm entagainst metastatic STS (Maki  et al . 2007 ;Hensley  et al . 2008 a, 2008b ,2013).  
In apatient-derived xenograft model of human liposarcoma ,olaratum ab in co mbinat ion with 
gemcitabine plus docetaxel  inhibited tumor growth to a greater extent than docetaxel plus
gemcitabine al one (p=0.05) .
The posi tive efficacy  resul ts seen wi th olaratum ab in combinat ion with doxorubi cin in 
Study JGDG
(Tap et al . 201 6)warrant further study o f olaratumab with gemci tabine plus 
docetaxel, another active treatment regimen ,for pati ents wi th advanced or m etastati c STS.
Study  I5B-MC-JGDL will eval uate the efficacy  and safet y of olaratum ab, in combinat ion with 
docetaxel and gemcitabin e(fixed dose rate: 10 m g/m2/minute) in pat ients with locally advanced
or metastati cSTS.   The study  will allow this evaluati on in both ol aratum ab-naïve and 
olaratum ab-pretreated populat ions.  Olaratumab -naïve patients are those who may be ineligible 
for treatm ent wi th doxorubi cin or for whom gemcitabine/docetaxel is more appropriate as init ial 
chemotherapy than doxorubicin .
More informat ion about the known and expected benefits, risks ,
and reasonably antici pated AEs 
of olaratum abmay be found in the IB.  Informat ion on AEs expected to be related to olaratumab
may be found in Sect ion 7 (Development Core Safety Information) of the IB.  Information on 
serious adverse events (SAEs) expected in the study  populati on independent of drug exposure 
and that will be assessed by the Sponsor in aggregate, periodically during the course of the study , 
may be found in Sect ion6 (Effects in Humans) of the IB.
5.4. Rationale for Selection of Dose
Olaratumab:
The current dose -selection strategy  for this study  is based on the integrated safet y, efficacy , and 
pharmacokinet ics (PK)data for olaratumab across previous Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. In 
2Phase 1 d ose-escalation trials ( Studies I5B-IE-JGDC and I5B-IE-JGDF ) and in the 2 Phas e 2 
monotherapy  studi es (Studi es I5B-IE-JGDE and I5B-IE-JGDH ), single -agent ol aratum ab has 
consistent ly been well tol erated ,with no dose-limiting toxicit ies (DLTs )observed up to a dose of 
20 m g/kg administered every  2 weeks and up to a dose of 15 mg/kg administered o nDays1 and 
8 of a 21- day cycle.   When used in co mbinat ion with liposomal doxorubicin in Study  I5B-IE-
JGDA (olaratum ab dose of 20 mg/kg every  2 weeks) , and wi th paclitaxel plus carbopl atin in 
Study  I5B-IE-JGDB (olaratumab dose of 15 mg/kg Day s1 and 8 every  3 weeks), a higher rate of 
toxicities such as neutropenia and infect ions was observed versus the comparator agents . As of 
30June 2016, 790 patients have received o laratumab .  through Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 
studi es.  In Study JGDG , although there was a higher incidence of some known doxorubicin 
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 27
LY3012207toxicities such as m ucosi tis, nausea/vomit ing, and di arrhea, these were monitorable, 
predominant ly Grade ≤2, and di d not l ead to a hi gher incidence of treatment discont inuat ion.  
Overall, t hese toxicit ies are consistent with the toxicit y profile of the combinat ion agents used 
and are considered monitorable and acceptable for the patient populat ions studied.
In addit ion, final PFS and OS data from Study JGDG show that the combinat ion of olara tumab 
15 m g/kg wi th doxorubi cin 75 mg/m2provi des a significant benefit compared to single- agent 
doxorubi cinin patients with advanced metastatic STS, without an increase in serious toxicit y.
Based on th e available clinical evidence , the Phase 1b partof this study will start the olaratumab 
dose escalat ion at 15 m g/kg.  Based on the safet y and PK results fro m the dose escalat ion atthe 
end of the Phase 1b part of this study , 
an appropri ate dose wil l be selected for the Phase 2.
Gemcitabine and Docetaxel:
The combinat ion of gemcitabine and docetaxel is an effect ive option for patients with metastatic 
sarcoma and has been studied using a diverse range of doses and across subtypes (Maki et al . 
2007).
Infusio n of gemcitabine at a f ixed-dose rate refers to infu sing gemcitabine at a continuous rate 
enabling the maintenance ofthe gem citabine concentrati on at a level that will optimize the 
incorporation of gemcitabine triphosphate, which is the active gemcitabine metabo lite, into 
deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA) (Hensl ey et al . 2008 a
).  Studies have shown that gemcitabine may 
have greater activit y when given as a fixed -dose rate i nfusi on (10 m g/m2/min) com pared w ith the 
recommended schedule (a 30-minute infusio n) (Tempero et al. 2003 ).
Fixed -dose rate gemcitabine (900 m g/m2over 90 minutes [fixed dose rate of 10 m g/m2/min], 
Days 1and 8, plus docetaxel  100 m g/m2on Day 8) yielded high object ive response rates among 
patients wi th advanced leio myosarco ma in both the second -line, and first -line setting (Hensley et 
al. 200 8a, 2008b ).  However, to increase the tolerabilit y of thischem otherapy regimen a 
docetaxel dose of 75 m g/m2,which is lower than 100 mg/m2,has been selected for this study . 
Some of the toxi city seen in previ ous clinical  experi ence (fat igue, ast henia, and fluid retention) 
wasmore typical  of thedocetaxel counterpart , suggesting that this docetaxel dose modificat ion 
could improve the tolerabili ty of this regimen.   This i s consistent with the 75-mg/m2 docetaxel  
dose chosen in recent Phase 3GeDDi S trial (Seddon et al. 2015
b). Therefore, this Phase 1b/2
trial investigate sthe efficacy and safet y of olaratumab in co mbinat ion with gemci tabine (900 
mg/m2over 90 minutes [ fixed -dose rate of 10 m g/m2/min])and docetaxel (75 mg/m2)for the 
treatm ent of locally advanced or m etastati c STS that i s not am enable to treatm ent wi th surgical 
resection or radi otherapy  with curative intent.
5.5. Rationale for Amendments
5.5.1. Rationale for Amendment (a)
The rationale for amendment (a)wasbased on feedback received fro mglobal regulatory  
authori tiesand com pliance wi th local regulatory  requi rements for submissions.  Major changes 
for amendment (a)included the fo llowing: new descri ptive language on prem edicat ion prior to 
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 28
LY3012207olaratum ab/placebo doses on Days 1 and 8 of Cy cle 1 and in subsequent cy cles.  Clarificat ion 
was also added related to the olaratumab observat ion period.  Additionally, the introduction was 
updated to include commo nly observed AEs for gemcitabine and docetaxel from published 
studi es, and to include data from the final primary analysis forefficacy and safet y for Study  I5B-
IE-JGDG .
5.5.2. Rationale for Amendment (b)
The protocol was amended to allow for expansio n of the olaratumab 20 mg/kg dose level
(Cohort 2 )by enrolling approximately 15 addit ional patients. The r ationale for adding an 
additional 15 pati ents to Cohort 2 is to confirm  the safet y of the20 m g/kg dose l evel prior to 
opening the Phase 2 randomized double -blinded porti on of  the tri al. Refer to Section 8.1.1 for 
further details.
5.5.3 .Rationale for Amendment (c) 
As doxorubi cin in co mbination wit h olaratum ab becom es more comm on in clinical pract ice for 
advanced or metastati c STS, addi tional evaluati on in ol aratum ab-pretreated patients is warranted 
in order to understand the effect of olaratumab as continuat ion therapy  with regimens such as 
gemcitabine/docetaxel  that are customarily administered after m aximal  doxorubicin dosing.  
Addit ionally , the concept of continuing a bio logic treatm ent wi th a change in chemotherapy  
backbone is supported by  evidence of on -going treatment effect of trastuzumab and bevacizumab 
in multiple lines of t herapy in HER2 posit ive breast cancer and metastatic colon cancer, 
respectively .  Furtherm ore, resistance to antibody  therapy in cancer is via separate mechanisms 
than chemotherapy  resistance, supporting the theory  that continued benefit from olaratumab is
possible after progressive disease on other chemotherapy regimens.  Finally , due to potenti al 
effect on PDGFRα expressing stromal cells, continued olaratumab exposure may lead to 
favorable changes in the tumor microenvironment irrespect ive of change in chem otherapy  
regimen.  The evaluat ion of olaratumab in co mbination with gemcitabine and docetaxel in 
olaratum ab pre -treated patients will be a secondary object ive. Ninet y patients will be added as 
this is deemed to be an adequate number to observe a signal f or strategi c planning of future 
studi es.  The protocol  amendment also adds aninterim efficacy analysis of all study  outcom esto 
allow for timely Phase 3 development strategies.

7.2.1. Rationale for Exclusion of Certain Study Candidates
The exclusio n criteria have been carefully  selected by  the Sponsor to ensure their ethical and 
scientific acceptabilit y, and to help establish specificit y of the pati ent popul ation for both 
efficacy  and safety  analyses.
7.3. Discontinuation
The reason for discontinuat ion and the date of di scontinuat ion will be collected for all patients.  
All enrolled (Phase 1b) and rando mized (Phase 2) patients who discont inue, regardless of 
whether or not they  received study  treatm ent, will have procedures performed as shown in the 
Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).
Patients who are di scont inued fro m the study  treatment early will have fo llow-up procedures 
perform ed as shown in the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 )
.
If a patient withdraws informed consent, he or she must not be contacted unless he or she has 
explicit lyprovide dpermissio n and consent.  Lilly may cont inue to use previously co llected 
medical research data prior to the withdrawal consistent with the original authorizat ion.
7.3.1. Discontinuation of Inadvertently Enrolled Patients
The cri teria for enro llment must be fo llowed explici tly. If the invest igator site ident ifies a patient 
who did not meet enrollment criteria and who was inadvertent ly enro lled, the Sponsor must be 
notified.   If the Sponsor i dentifies a patient who did not meet enrollment crite ria and who was 
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 36
LY3012207inadvertent ly enro lled, the invest igator site will be notified .  A discussio n must occur between 
the Sponsor clinical research physician ( CRP )/clinical research scient ist (CRS) and the 
investigator to determine whether the patient may conti nue in the study , with or wi thout 
investigat ional product ( IP).  Inadvertent ly enro lled patients may be maintained in the study  and 
on study  treatm entwhen the Lilly CRP /CRS agrees with the invest igator that it is medically 
appropriate f or that patient. The patient may  not continue in the study  with or wi thout study 
treatm entif the Lilly CRP /CRS does not agree with the investigator’s determination it is 
medically appropriate for the patient to continue.
The patient may  continue to receive study  drugs if allof the f ollowing condi tions are m et:
In the opinion o f the invest igator, the patient is receiving benefit .
The Lilly CRP /CRS and the invest igator determine that no effect ive alternat ive therapy 
exists .
The Lilly CRP/CRS and the invest igator agree there is no safety concern merit ing 
discontinuat ion of study  drugs .
The invest igator must obtain documented approval fro m the Lilly CRP /CRS to allow the 
inadv ertent ly enro lled pat ient to conti nue in the study  with or wi thout study  treatm ent.
7.3.2. Discontinuation of Patients
In addition, pati ents will  be discont inued from the study  drug and/or from the study  in the
following circumstances:
enrollment in any other clinical trial invo lving an investigational product or enrollment in 
any other ty pe of medical research judged not to be scient ifically or medically co mpat ible 
with this study
investig ator/phy sician or Sponsor decisio n
othe invest igator or Lilly stops the study or stops the patient’s participat ion in the 
study  for m edical, safet y, regul atory , or other reasons consistent with applicable 
laws, regulations, and good clinical practice
othe invest igator decides that the patient should be discontinued fro m study  
treatm ent or fro m the study
othe pati ent, f or any  reason, requi res treatm ent wi th another therapeuti c agent that 
has been demonstrated to be effect ive for treatm ent of the study  indicat ion,

evidence of progressive disease (Attachm ent 5 )
unacceptable toxicit y
pregnancy
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 37
LY3012207significant nonco mpliance with study  procedures and/or treatment
The discont inuation reason and date will be collected for all pat ients.  The date of 
discontinuat ion (for any  of the above reasons) from study  treatm ent is to be reported on the case 
report form (CRF).  Patients who discont inue will have fo llow-up procedur es performed as 
shown in the Study  Schedule (Attachment 1 ).
7.3.3. Patients who are Lost to Follow -Up
A pat ient willbe considered lost to fo llow-up if he or she repeatedly  fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be con tacted by  the study  site.  Site personnel are expected to make 
diligent attempts to contact patients (for exam ple, by  phone calls, cert ified letters, etc.) who fail 
to return for a scheduled visit or who the site is otherwise unable to follow.
Site personnel , or an independent third party ,will attempt to collect the vital status (that i s, alive 
or dead) for all enrolled (Phase 1b) or randomized (Phase 2) patients who are lost to fo llow-up, 
including enrolled or randomized pati
ents who do not receive study  treatm ent, within legal and 
ethical boundaries .  Site personnel , or an independent third party ,may search public sources for 
vital status inform ation.If the pati ent's vi tal status is determined, the vital status will be 
docum ented and the pati ent will not be considered lost to follow -up.
Lilly personnel will not be invo lved in any attempts to collect vital status informat ion.
7.3.4. Discontinuation of Study Sites
Study  site parti cipat ion may be discont inued if Lilly , the invest igator, or the ethical review board 
(ERB) or institutional review board (IRB) of the study  site judges discont inuat ion of study  site 
participat ion necessary  for m edical, safet y, regul atory , ethi cal, or other reasons consistent with 
applicable laws, regulat ions, and good clinical practices ( GCP ).
7.3.5. Discontinuation of the Study
The study  will be di scontinued if Lilly judges discontinuat ion of the study  necessary for medical, 
safet y, regul atory , ethi cal, or other reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulat ions, and 
GCP.   Prior to discont inuat ion, the ERB or IRB (which approve d the tri al) will be notified 
according to local regulation.

8.1. Summary of Study Design
Study  I5B-MC-JGDL is a mult icenter Phase 1b /2 study  ofolaratum ab in co mbinat ion with 
gemcitabine and docetaxel  in pat ients with locally advanced or metastatic STS, not amenable to 
treatm ent wi th surgical  resecti on or ra diotherapy  with curative intent.   The first part (Phase 1b) 
of the study  will consist of a n open -label, single -arm, dose -escalat ion assessment of the safet y 
and tol erabilit y of olaratumab administered at 15mg/kg(Days1 and 8) or20mg/kg(Day s1 and 
8) withgemci tabine (900 mg/m2[fixed dose rate :  10 m g/m2/minute] , Days 1and 8 ) and 
docetaxel ( 75 mg/ m2, Day8),ona 21-day cycle (Figure JGDL .1).  After the dose of olaratumab 
in combinat ion with gem citabine and docetaxel  has been determined from the analysis o f the 
Phase 1b part, the Phase 2, randomized, double -blinded , placebo -controlled part of the study  will 
open to enrollment.  Patients will be rando mized in a 1:1 ratio in a double -blinded manner to 
Arm A (ol aratum ab plus gemcitabine and docetaxel) or Arm B (placebo plus gemcitabine and 
docetaxel).  
 Figure JGDL .1illustrates the study  design.
Patients will  cont inue treatment until there is documented disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicity, death, or other discont inuat ion criteria are met.

*  Based on the outcome of the Phase 1b part, the dose selected for the Phase 2 part of 
JGDL will be either 15 mg/kg or20 mg/kg . Depending on the sa fety and 
pharmacokinetic profile of these dose levels, it is possible that an intermediate dosing 
regimen of 2loading doses of 20 mg/kg during Cycle 1followed by 15 mg/kg in every 
subsequent cycle could be utilized in Phase 2 , as is being studied in the Phase 3 Study 
JGDJ.
Figure JGDL .1. Illustration of study design.
8.1.1. Phase 1b Dose Escalation
The Phase 1b part is a single -arm dose escalat ion to determine the recommended dose of 
olaratum ab for the Phase 2 part that may be safely administered in combinat ion with gemci tabine 
(900 m g/m2) and docetaxel  (75 m g/m2) inpatients wi th locally advanced or metastati c STS .  This 
dose escalat ion has a starting o laratumab dose of 15 mg/kg and the highest olaratumab dose of 
20mg/kg. No intrapatient dose escalat ion is permitted. Patients in any cohort who do not 
complete Cycle 1 treatm ent for reasons other than a DLT will be replaced.
The DLT assessment will be performed as outlined in Sect ion 9.4.1.1 .The safet ydata for the 
cohort will be reviewed prior to dose escalat ionor dose determinat ion for Phase 2
.  The total  
number of patients with DLTs, the ty pe of DLTs ,and relevant PK information will be considered 
prior to m aking a decisio n.  At the time of analysis of safet y data for Phase 1b ,if review of the 

I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 40
LY3012207data determines that G -CSF use is required with this combinat ion,then this requi rement will be 
implemented in the Phase 2 part.
15 mg/kg Olaratumab Dose Level (Cohort 1)
Approximately  15 pati ents will be treated with olaratumab at 15 mg/kg, in co mbinat ion with 
gemcitabine and docetaxel , in the fi rst cohort.
Of the DLT -evaluable pat ients in the 15- mg/kg cohort, if one -third or more patients wi th DLTs 
are observed, no further dose escalat ion of o laratumab will occur.  If review of safet y data 
indicates that DLTs of prolonged neutropenia and/or febrileneutropeni a occurred that might be 
prevented by  more extensive prophylact ic use of G -CSF, then addit ional pat ients may be added 
to this cohort to determine if such G -CSF use would pro vide an overall DLT rate acceptable for 
Phase 2 study , after di scussio n with study  investigators.  Otherwise, if the DLT criteria are met 
or exceeded despite these measures, then the Phase 2 part of the study  will not open.
20 mg/kg Olaratumab Dose Level (Cohort 2)
Of the DLT -evaluable pat ients in the 15- mg/kg cohort, i f fewerthan one-thirdof patients wi th
DLT sare observed ,a new cohort with approximately 15 patients will be treated with olaratumab 
at 20 mg/kg in co mbinat ion with gemci tabine and docetaxe l, using the same DLT criteria 
described above for the 15-mg/kg olaratumab dose level.
If the DLT criteria are met or exceeded for the olaratumab 20 -mg/kg dose level, and review of 
safet y data indicates that DLTs of prolonged neutropenia and/or fever neutropeni a occurred that 
might be prevented by  more extensive prophylact ic use of G -CSF, then addit ional pat ients may 
be added to this cohort to determine if such G -CSF use woul d provi de an overall DLT rate 
acceptable for Phase 2, after discussio n with study investi gators.  A PK analysis of the 15
-mg/kg 
and 20 -mg/kg olaratumab dose level swill also be performed to determine if the serum  levels 
observed in this study  are consistent wi th those previously associated with a posi tive benefit/risk
in the STS pat ient populat ion.
Of the DLT -evaluable pat ients in the 20- mg/kg cohort, i f fewerthan one-thirdof patients wi th
DLTs are observed, then the 20 -mg/kg dose level may be chosen for Phase 2 study.
Patients in each cohort will cont inue treatment until there is docum ented disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicit y, death, or other discont inuat ion criteria are met.
Expansion of the20 mg/kg Olaratumab Dose Level (Cohort 2)
The 15-mg/kg olaratumab dose level (Cohort 1) safet y review has been co mpleted with 19 DLT -
evaluable pat ients (Cy cle 1).  There were no DLTs observed in Cohort 1.  Based on the safet y 
review of Cohort 1
, escalat ion to the 20-mg/kg olaratum ab dose level (Cohort 2) was 
implemented.
Inthe 18 DLT -evaluable pat ients enro lled in Cohort 2 ,DLTs were observed in 3patients (Grade 
3 febrile neutropenia in 2 pat ients
,one of who m hadbacteremia ,and a Grade 3 elevation o f 
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 41
LY3012207hepat ic transaminases in 1patient).  Two patient deaths were observed in Cohort 2 , one onCycle 
2 Day 9 (patient died in his sleep) and one on Cy cle 3 Day 5 (chest pain and cardiac arrest).  The 
first pati ent had a history  of hypertensio n and prior MI, and the sec ond pati ent had a history  of 
coronary artery  bypass graft surgery , cardi ac stent placement, and peri pheral  vascular disease; 
both deaths were deemed unrelated to study  treatment by  their investi gators. PK analysis o f 
Cohort 2 patients indica ted that t he olaratum ab C maxand AUC of the DLT pati ents were similar 
to other patients in the cohort .  The 2 patients who had died in Cohort 2 had olaratumab C maxand 
AUC very  close to the median of Cohort 2 , and their values overlapped wit h some patients from 
Cohort 1 .  Altogether ,these clinical and PK findings indicated it was unlikely that the 2 deaths in 
Cohort 2 were due to an olaratumab -related factor. Although the DLT rule was not exceeded in 
Cohort 2 (3 out of 18 patients), after discussio n with study  invest igators ,it was decided that it 
was reasonable to further confirm pat ient safet y at the 20 -mg/kg dose level prior to ini tiation of 
the Phase 2 portion of the study  by enrolling approximately 15 additional patients to Cohort 2.
8.1.2. Phase 2
After the dose of olaratumab in co mbination wit h gemcitabine and docetaxel has been 
determined fro m the Phase 1b part, the Phase 2 randomized, double -blinded partof the study  will 
open t o enrollment.  In the Phase 2 part, approximately 256patients will  be randomized 1:1 to 
receive eit her olaratum abplus gemci tabine and docetaxel (A
rm A) or pl acebo pl us gemci tabine 
and docetaxel (Arm  B).  Out of the 256 patients, 166 will be olaratumab na ïve and 90 will be 
olaratum ab pretreated patients.  Randomizat ion will  be stratified by prior treatm ent wi th 
olaratumab (y es versus no), number of prior sy stemic therapies for locally advanced or 
metastati c disease (0 versus ≥1), histol ogical  tumor type (leiomyosarcoma versus non -
leiomyosarcom a),ECOG perform ance status ( PS)(0 versus 1) ,and prior pelvic radiat ion (yes 
versus no).
Patients will  cont inue treatment until there is documented disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicity, death, or other discon tinuation criteria are met.
8.1.3. Definitions of Study Periods
Terms used to describe the periods during the study are defined below:
Baseline:   begins when the ICF is signed and ends at the first study treatment (or at 
discontinuat ion, if no treatm ent is given) .
Study Period:   begins at the first study treatment and ends at study  com pletion.The 
study  period 
does not i nclude the continued access period .
oTheunblinded Phase1b partwill be co mpleted prior to opening the Phase 2 partof 
the study  to randomizat ion.  Continuat ion of the study  into Phase 2 will be 
dependent on data from the Phase 1 b part.
oStudy Treatment Period :  begins at the first study treatment and ends when the 
patient and the investigator agree that the patient will n o longer continue study  
treatm ent.  The date of this agreement is to be reported on the CRF as the Date of 
Discontinuati on from study  treatm ent.
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 42
LY3012207oPostdiscontinuation Follow -Up:  begins the day  after the pati ent and the 
investigator agree that the patient wi ll no longer cont inue study  treatm ent.
Short -term follow -upbegins the day after the pati ent and the invest igator 
agree that the patient will no longer continue study treatment and lasts 
approximately  30 days (±7days).   The short -term follow -up visit occurs at or 
near the end of the short -term follow-up peri od (± 7days).
Long -term follow -upbegins theday after short -term follow-up is completed 
and cont inues unt il the patient’s death ,or un til the patient is lost to fo llow-up
or overal l study  com pletion.
Follow -up for progression -Patients that discont inue study  
treatm ent for reasons other than progression will be assessed for 
progression every  6weeks (±7 day s) until progressive disease 
(PD).
Follow -up for survival -Patients will be followed every 
3months (±7 day s) for the fi rst year, then every  6 months (±14 
days) unt il the patient’s death or overall study complet ion.
Continued Access Period:   Phase 1b and Phase 2 continued access period begins after 
completion of the Phase 1b and Phase 2 parts,respectively ,and ends at the end of trial .  
During the continued access period,patients on study  treatm ent who con tinue to 
experience clinical benefit and no undue risks may conti nue to receive study  treatm ent 
until one of the cri teria for discont inuat ion is met.  The continued access period includes 
continued access follow-up.
oContinued access follow -up:  begins theday after the pati ent and the invest igator 
agree that the patient will no longer continue treatment in the continued access 
period and l asts approximately 30 days (±7days).  The continued access
follow-up visit occurs at or near the end of the continued access fo llow-up peri od.
8.1.4. Baseline and Study Treatment Period Assessments
Baseline radiographic assessment of disease will be performed within 28 days prior to 
enrollment in Phase 1b and randomizat ion in Phase 2 ; scans performed prior to the date of 
consent may be used provided they are within 28 days of rando mizat ion.
Imaging and tum or assessment will be performed every  6weeks (±7 day s), irrespect ive of 
treatm ent cycles, as calculated from enro llment (Phase 1 b) or randomizat ion (Phas e 2).  Im aging 
requi rements include computed tom ography  (CT)scan or magnet ic resonance imaging (MRI) of 
chest, abdomen, and pelvis .  Other areas may be scanned , when clinically indicated.  Digital 
images are to be sent to a third -party  organi zation for st orage.  It i s recommended that CT 
imaging of the abdo men/pelvis be performed with intravenous (IV)contrast, whenever possible.  
If this is not feasible/advisable secondary to hy persensi tivity or other condit ions, then 
gadolinium -enhanced MRI is preferred.  For patients with known serious allergic reactions to CT 
contrast m aterial , a CT of  the chest wi thout contrast and contrast -enhanced MRI of the 
abdo men/pelvis are encouraged.
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 43
LY3012207The patient’s first treatment will be administered within 72 hours (3 day s) following enro llment 
(Phase 1b) or randomizat ion (Phase 2), whenever possible (up to 3 add itional days ’delay  of first 
dose of treatment will be permitted due to holidays, weekends, bad weather, or other unforeseen 
circumstances and will not cou nt as a protocol deviat ion).
Patients in both arms will receive any necessary  prem edicati on if needed (see Sect ion 9.1.1 ) prior 
to the infusio n of study  therapy  at each treatm ent cycle.
A treatment cy cle will  be defined as 3 weeks (21 da ys ± 3 day s).  The start of study  treatm ent 
will be considered Cycle 1 Day  1.
Phase 1b :
Olaratum ab (15 or 20 m g/kg IV infusio n) on Days 1 and 8 of every  3-week cycle over 
60minutes, fo llowed by  a 1-hour observat ion period for the first 2 cycles.If there is no 
evidence of an infusio n-related reacti on (IRR) after the D ay1 and D ay8 infusi ons of 
olaratum ab in the first 2 cy cles, no observation period is required for subsequent 
treatm ent cycles.   In the event that a Grade 1 or 2 IRR occurs after Cycle 2, the 1 -hour 
observat ion peri od will  be reinst ituted for a minimum of 2 cy cles.  The reinst ituted 
observat ion peri od m ay be suspended after 2 cy cles if the pat ient shows no further signs 
or symptoms of an IRR .
Gemci tabine (900 m g/m2, IV infusi on) onDays 1 and 8 over 90 minutes (fixed -dose rate 
of 10mg/m2/minute ), after olaratumab infusio n
Docetaxel (75 mg/m2IV infusio n) onDay 8over 60 minutes, after gemcitabine
Phase 2 :
Patients in the invest igational Arm A will receive:
Olaratum ab on Days 1 and 8 of every 21 -day cycle over 60 minutes, fo llowed by  a 1-
hour observation period for the first 2 cycles. If there is no evidence o f an IRR after 
the Day1 and D ay8 infusi ons in the first 2 cycles, no observat ion peri od is requi red 
for subsequent treatm ent cy cles.  In the event that a Grade 1 or 2 IRR occurs after 
Cycle 2, the 1 -hour observat ion peri od will be reinstituted for a minimum o f 2 cycles.  
The reinst ituted observat ion peri od may  be suspended after 2 cycles if the patient 
shows no fu rther si gns or symptom s of an IRR .  The dose of olaratumab will be 
determined fro m the Phase 1b part of the study .  Depending on the safet y and PK 
profile of the Phase 1b dose levels, it is possible that an intermediate dosing regimen 
of 2 loading doses of 20mg/kg during Cycle 1 fo llowed by  15mg/kg in every 
subsequent cy cle coul d be ut ilized in Phase 2, as is being studied in the Phase 3 Study 
JGDJ.
Gem citabine (900 m g/m2, IV infusi on) on Days 1 and 8 over 90 minutes (fixed -dose 
rate of 10 mg/m2/minute ), after olaratumab infusio n
Docetaxel (75 mg/m2IV infusio n) on Day  8 over 60 minutes, after gemcitabine
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 44
LY3012207Patients in the control Arm B will receive:
Placebo (IV infusio n) on Days 1 and 8 of every 21 -day cycle over 60 minutes, 
followed by a 1- hour observation period for the first 2 cycles. If there is no evidence 
of an IRR after the D ay1 and D ay8 infusi ons in the first 2 cycles, no observat ion 
period is requi red for subsequent treatment cy
cles.  In the event that a Grade 1 or 2 
IRR occurs after C ycle 2, the 1 -hour observat ion peri od will be reinst ituted for a 
minimum o f 2 cycles.  The reinst ituted observat ion peri od m ay be suspended after 2 
cycles if the pati ent shows no further signs or symptoms of an IRR.
Gem citabine (900 m g/m2, IV infusi on) on Days 1 and 8 over 90 minutes ( fixed -dose 
rate of 10 mg/m2/minute ), after olaratumab infusio n
Docetaxel (75 mg/m2IV infusio n) on Day  8 over 60 minutes, after gemcitabine
Phase 1b and 2
Administrati on and dosing of all therapeut ic products will occur as described in Section 9.1.
Criteria for starting the next cy cle are defined in Section 9.4.1.2 .  Dose reductions for 
olaratum ab/placebo will be made in the event of specific treatment -related AEs, as described in 
Secti on9.4.1.2.2 .  Supportive care guidelines are detailed in Sect ion9.6.1 .
Patients will  be treated until there is documented radio logical PD, toxi city requi ring cessat ion of 
treatm ent, wi thdrawal  of consent, or until other withdrawal criteria are met.  In the event there is 
symptom atic deterioration result ing in treatment discontinuation, radiog raphic confirmat ion 
shoul d be perform ed.  For patients who discont inue treatment for any  reason other than 
radiographically  docum ented PD (for exam ple, symptom atic deterioration), radiographic 
assessments should cont inue as scheduled every 6 weeks (±7 days) as cal culated from  
rando mizat ion unt il objective radiographic evidence of PD.
8.1.5. Postdiscontinuation Follow -Up Period Assessments
Postdiscontinuati on short -term and l ong-term follow -up assessments will be conducted as 
described in the Study  Sched ule (Attachment 1 ).Adverse event (AE) informat ion will be 
collected until at least 30 days after the last dose of study  treatm ent.  Aft er the 30 -day short -term 
follow-up visit, only  new and ongoing SAEs deemed related to study treatment will be co llected.
Long -term follow-up will cont inue as lo ng as the patient is alive, and has not wi thdrawn to
follow-up, or the study  has not completed as defined in Section 8.1.6 .
For pati ents who discont inue study  treatm ent for any  reason wi thout obj ectively measured PD, 
imaging studies and tumor assessments are obtained every  6 weeks (±7 days), i rrespect ive of 
treatm ent cycles as calculated from rando mization, until documented progression.
For pati ents that discont inue study  treatm ent after obj ectively measured PD, the fo llowing 
inform ation will be co llected every 3months (±7 days) for the first y ear, then every  6 months

Phase 1b
The Phase 1b partof the study  will be considered complete following determinat ion of the 
recommended Phase 2 dose of olaratumab that may be safely  administered in combinat ion with 
gemcitabine plus docetaxel  
to patients with locally advanced or metastatic STS (Figure JGDL .2).
Phase 2
This study  will be considered com plete (that i s, the sci entific evaluation will be co mplete [study
completion]) fo llowing final analysis o fthe OS endpoint ( atleast 108OS ev ents in the 
olaratum ab-naïve cohort )hasbeen performed and evaluated, as determined by Lilly
(Figure JGDL. 3).  Invest igators will continue to follow the study schedule for all patients until 
notified by Lilly that study  com pletion has occurred .
“End of trial” refers to the da te of the l ast visi t or last scheduled proce dure for the last patient.
Upon study  com pletion, invest igators and patients may be unblinded to study treatment 
assignment for the Phase 2 part.  Patients receiving study  treatm entand experiencing ongo ing 
clinical benefit and no undue risks may cont inue to receive the study  treatment in the continued 
access period.  The continued access period begins after study  com pletion and will cont inue unt il 
the end of trial.
The end o f trial occurs after study  com pletion and after the last patient has discont inued study  
treatm ent and com pleted any applicable continued access follow

LY3012207access period until one of the cri teria for di scont inuation is met (Section 7.3).  During the 
continued access period, placebo will no longer be administered, and crossover will not be 
permitted.
During the continued access period, co ncom itant medicat ion,AEs, SAEs, and study  treatm ent
dosing will be reported on the CRF.  Serious adverse events will also be reported to Lilly  Global 
Patient Safet y (see Section 10.3.1 ) .  In the event that an SAE occurs, Lilly may request addit ional 
inform ation (such as local laboratory  resul ts, concomi tant m edicati ons, and hospitalizat ions) in 
order to evaluate the reporte d SAE. Blood sam ples f or PK and immunogenicit y analysis will be 
collected inthe event of an infusio n-related reacti on (IRR).
Invest igators will perform any other standard procedures and tests needed to treat and evaluate 
patients; however, the choice and timing of the tests will be at the investigator’s discret ion.Lilly
will not routinely co llect the results of these assessments.
Patients who are in short -term follow-up when the continued access period begins will cont inue 
in short -term follow-up unt il the 30 -day short -term fo llow-up visit is co mpleted.  Long -term 
follow-up does not apply.
Patients who are in long -term follow-up when the continued access period begins will be 
discontinued fro m long-term follow-up.
8.1.8. Committees
The following committees will be established to evaluate patients’ safety and/orefficac y of th e 
study  treatm ent.  There will be charters for these committees to fo llow.
Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( iDMC)
Phase 2 :
For the Phase 2 part, the independent Data Monitoring C ommittee (iDMC) will beestablished to 
conduct interim safet y analyses as specified in Section 12.2.14 and will fo llow an approved 
iDMC charter .  The iDMC may init iate a consultatio n with an appropri ate expert (if addit ional 
expert ise is needed regarding evaluat ion of any  safety  signals ).  The iDMC will communicate 
back to Lilly Senior Management Designee about their assessment .
The i DMC will also review adverse events of special interest (AESI s
)for olaratum ab, including
IRRs .
The first iDMC meet ing to review Phase 2 interim safet y data will occur when approximately  
60patients (approximately  30patients from each arm ) have received 2 cy cles of treatm entor 
discontinued all study  treatm ent due to any  reasons pri or to Day 8 in Cycle 2.  Subsequent iDMC 
meet ings will occur approximately  every 6 months there after.  Enrollment and treatment will 
continue during the iDMC safet y assessments.  In the event a safety  signal  is detected, addit ional 
meet ings may occur as needed. See Section 12.2.14 for addi tional details.
Addit ionally , the i DMC will perform  the interim efficacy  analysis according to specificat ions in 
iDMC charter and study  statist ical analysis plan .
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 49
LY3012207Independent Review Committee (IRC)
Phase 2 :
An Independent Review C ommit tee m ay review the CT scans and MRI scans for tumor 
assessments from selected patients if necessary (for exam ple,based on inquiries fromregul atory
authori ties).   
8.1.9. Study Duration
From  first pati ent visi tin the Phase 1b part to last pati ent visi tin the Phase 2 part, the estimated 
study  durati on is 47 months.
8.2. Discussion of Design and Control
For the P hase 1b dose-escalation study , a nonrandomized, uncontrolled design is being used to 
ident ify the recommended dose of olaratum ab to be used in the Phase 2 part.
For the Phase 2 part, arandomized, controlled design is being used.  Randomization minimizes 
system atic bias in the select ion and assignment of patients to study  treatm ent and provides 
justificat ion for inferential statist ical methods to be used on data from this study .  Using a n 
appropriate concurrent con trol arm enables di rect stati stical estimat ion of benefits and harms due 
to study  treatm ent and minimizes bias in the assessment and interpretation of observed treatment 
effects. Patients will be stratified for differences in factors thought to be associated with clinical 
outcom es to further reduce the potential for bias and improve the power of the analyses
(Secti on9.3).  Assessment of bias is further minimized by the use o f a doubl e blind and placebo 
control .
Invest igational treatment administration in the Phase 2 partof this study  is doubl e -blind; that is, 
patients, invest igational sites, and the Sponsor s tudy team  do not have immediate access to 
treatm ent assi gnments for any  patients.  This design feature minimizes potential bias due to 
knowl edge of pat ient’s treatment during evaluat ion of study  endpoints, at the patient level or 
aggregated across patients .

withstand transient excursio n to room temperature (15°C -25°C) without adverse effect; however, 
storage at this temperature is not recommended.
Please refer to the pharmacy manual for olaratumab/placebo dosing so lution for infusio n. 
CAUTION:   Infusion -related reacti ons may  occur during or following olaratum ab/placebo
administration (see Section 9.4.1.2.2.1 for a definit ion of Grade 3 and 4 IRRs ).  During the 
administration of olaratumab /placebo , pati ents shoul d be in an area with resuscitat ion equipment 
and treatments necessary  for advanced lif e support and cardiopulmo nary resusci tation (CPR), 
such as bronchodilators, vasopressor agents ( for example , epinephrine), oxy gen, gl ucocorti coids, 
antihistamines, IV fluids, and so forth.  A 1- hour observat ion peri od is requi red after the 
administration o f the first and second cy cles of olaratum ab/placebo.  If there is no evidence of an 
IRR during the init ial 2 cycles of olaratum ab/placebo, then no observation period is required for 
subsequent treatment cy cles.  In the event that a Grade 1 or 2 IRR occurs after Cy cle 2, the 1 -
hour observation period will be reinst ituted for a minimum o f 2 cycles.  The reinst ituted 
observat ion peri od m ay be suspended after 2 cy cles if the pat ient shows no further signs or 
symptoms of an IRR.   See Section 9.4.1.2.2.1 for management of infusio n rate wi th Grade s1 and

LY3012207Docetaxel will be administered at a dose of 75mg/m2(IV) over 60 minutes on Day 8 of each 
21-daytreatm ent cy cle.
9.3. Method of Assignment to Treatment
Phase 1b:
Upon signing the inform ed consent form (ICF) , the si te will register the patient in the Interactive 
Web Response System (IWRS), which is web- based and accessible 24 hours a day . The IWRS 
registrati on consists of assigning the patient a unique study  identificat ion number. Patients who 
meet all criteria for enrollment will be assigned to receive study  treatm entthrough the IWRS 
system .No dose escalat ions (that is, to the next cohort) can occur without prior discussio n and 
agreem ent wi th the responsible Lilly CRP or CRS.
There i s no randomizat ion procedure for Phase 1b patients. Phase 1b pat ients will not participate 
in Phase 2.
Phase 2:
Upon signing the ICF, the si te will register the patient by  the IWRS, which is web -based and 
accessible 24 hours a day .  The IWRS registration consists of assigning the patient a unique 
study ident ification number for all patients .  Pati ents who meet all criteria will be rando mized
into 1 of  the 2 treatm ent arm s on a 1:1 basis , using the IWRS .
The I WRS will assign patients to treatment arms according to a stratified method of 
rando mization (that is, independent randomizat ion within each strat um), defined by  the 
following 5factors:
Prior treatm ent wi th olaratumab (y es versus no)
Number of prior systemic therapies for locally advanced/metastatic disease (0 versus ≥1)
NOTE:  Any therapy  administered in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting will not be 
considered as a prior line o f therapy  here.
Histologi cal tum or type (leiomyosarcom a versus non-le io myosarcoma )
ECOG PS(0 versus 1)
Prior pelvic radiation (yes versus no)
After rando mizat ion, pati ents shoul d receive thei r first dose of treatment within 72 hours (3 day s) 
whenever possible (up to 3 addit ional days ’delay  of first dose of treatment will be permitted due 
to holidays, weekends, bad weather, or other unforeseen circumstances and will not count as a 
protocol  deviat ion).
9.4. Selection and Timing of Doses
A cycle is defined as an interval of 21 days (up to 3 day s’delay  of a cy cle will be permitted due 
to holidays, weekends, bad weather, or other unforeseen circumstances and will not count as a 
protocol  deviat ion).
The dose of olaratum ab/placebo administered will be determined by measuring the pati ent's 
weight in kil ograms on D ays1 and 8 of each cycle.  Also, see Section 9.2.1 for further details on 
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 56
LY3012207olaratum ab/placebo.   The dose of gemcitabine or docetaxel administered will be determined by 
calculat ing the patient's body surface area (BSA) at the beginni ng of  each cycle.
If the patient’s weight does not fluctuate by  10% (increase or decrease) from the weight used to 
calculate the pri or dose, the olaratum ab/placebo or gemcitabine or docetaxel  dose will not need 
to be recalculated , unless deemed clinically meaningful .  A 5% variance in the calculated total 
dose (or for gem citabine and/or docetaxel a variance according to local inst itutional guidelines is 
also allowed ) will be allowed for ease of dose administration.
Day 8 administrati on of  gemci tabine and docetaxel must not be given prior to Day  8.
Patients will  receive treatm ent until evidence of progressive disease (PD), unacceptable toxicit y, 
death, or other withdrawal criteria are met (as described in Sect ion7.3).
9.4.1. Special Treatment Considerations
9.4.1.1. Dose -Limiting Toxicity Determination (Phase 1b Part)
Bone m arrow suppressi on occurs rel atively frequent ly wit h the gemcitabine and docetaxel 
regimen and can lead to complicat ions such as fever and neutropenia, infect ion, or bl eeding, 
which are generally considered DLT -level toxicit ies and thus can confound DLT determinat ion 
in the setting of co mbinat ion with olaratumab.  The criteria listed below will be used to 
determine the dose of olaratumab that can be added to gemcitabine and docetaxel without 
causing a significant increase in toxicit y over that expected with gemcitabine/doc etaxel alo ne.
In the Phase 1b part, DLT assessment will be performed.  A DLT is defined as events such as the 
following , graded according to the NCI -CTCAE version 4.0, whe n the event occurs within 
Cycle 1, and is considered to be related to study treatm ent by  the invest igator in conjuncture with 
the Sponsor :
febrile neutropenia with documented Grade ≥3 infection or sepsis
Grade 4 thrombocy topeni a, or Grade 3 thrombocy topeni a com plicate d by hemorrhage
Grade 4 neutropenia last ing 7 days or longer 
nonhematologic Grade ≥3 toxi city, except for toxicit ies such as nausea, vo miting, 
transi ent electroly te abnorm alities, or di arrhea which can be controlled with optimal 
medical management within 48 hours)
In addit ion to the DLT assessment period in Cycle 1, safet y data bey ond Cycle 1 m ay also be 
taken into consideration prior to a decisio n to escalation or determinat ion of the Phase 2 dose.
9.4.1.2. Dose Delays, Modifications, and Discontinuations
To begin dosing at each cy cle(Day  1), the fo llowing cri teria must be f ulfilled:
ANC ≥1.5 × 103cells/µL ( ≥1500 cells/µL; ≥1.5 × 109/L), with no G -CSF in the prior 48 
hours
Platelets ≥100 × 103cells/µL ( ≥100,000 cells/µL; ≥100 × 109cells/L) , with no platelet 
transfusio n in the prior 72 hours
Hem oglobin ≥
8.0g/dL .  Note: For inclusio n criteria, hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL .
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 57
LY3012207Total  bilirubin below ULN .  In pati ents wi th Gilbert’s Syndrome, total bilirubin should 
be 3 mg/dL.
Serum  creatinine ≤1.5 times ULN .  If creatinine is above ULN, the patient’s creat inine 
clearance is ≥45 m L/min (refer to Attachment 8 for the Cockcroft -Gault formula for 
creatinine clearance).
AST and ALT ≤3.0x ULN, or ≤5 x ULN if the transaminase elevat ion is due to liver 
metastases
Any treatm ent-related nonhem atologic toxicitythat is NCI-CTCAE, v 4.0Grade <2 or 
equivalent severit y to baseline , unless toxi city consists of l aboratory  abnormalit ies (for 
example, potassi um,magnesium , or phosphate ) that are managed per institutional
standards .
(For Grade 4 nonhem atologic toxicity deem ed related to ol aratumab/placebo ,
see Table JGDL.7.)
Delays:
In general, dose delays of one study  drug (ol aratumab/placebo ,gemcitabine ,or docetaxel ) due to 
toxicity guidances outlined in Secti ons 9.4.1.2.1 and 9.4.1.2.2 willnot necessitate delaysof the 
other study  drug .  However, close considerat ion must be made by the invest igator to administer 
all study  treatm ents per the schedule outlined in Section 9.1.
Treatment may be delayed for up to 14days to allo w a patient sufficient time for recovery  from 
study  drug -related toxici tyor non -study -drug-related even ts at the investigator’s discret ion (for 
example, an autom obile accident) .
Dose Modificat ions:
Any pat ient who requires a dose reduction for drug -related toxicit y will cont inue to receive the 
reduced dose for the remainder of the study , except in the situat ion described in Table JGDL. 2, 
footnote b .  For gem citabine or docetaxel , any pat ient who has had 2dose reducti onsand who 
experiences a toxicit y that woul d cause a thirddose reducti on m ust be discont inued fro m study  
treatm ent.  For olaratumab, a ny pat ient who has had 2dose reductions and who experiences a 
toxicity that woul d cause a thirddose reduction must be discont inued fro m study  treatm ent.
In the Phase 2 part, s ince all i nvest igators are blinded to treatment arms, they will treat all  
patients as if thepatientreceived study  drug versus placebo and will adjust doses accordingly.
In the event of an alterati onin olaratumab/placebo dose due to an olaratumab /placebo -related 
toxicity, gemci tabine or docetaxel need not be altered, and the planned gemci tabine or docetaxel
schedule should be maintained.
Similarly, olaratumab /placebo therapy  need not be altered for either gemci tabine -or 
docetaxel -related toxici ty.
The d osing algorithm on Day s1 and 8 for gemcitabine, docetaxel , o laratumab and G -CSF use, 
based on ANC and platelet count, are shown inTable JGDL. 2.  Treatment should not begin on 
Day 1 of any cycle until the ANC is 1500 cells/µl and the pl atelet count i s ≥100 ,000 cells/ µl.

a Patients with a prior history of pelvic radiation should receive prophylactic G -CSF in all cycles.  G -CSF use is recommended per the guidelines outlined in 
Section 9.1.1.4 .  Patients with a prior history of pelvic radiation who require chemotherapy dose reduction despite prophylactic G -CSF are not required to 
have prophylactic G -CSF in subsequent cycles if per investigator assessment such chemotherapy dose reductions adequately address the risk of further 
myelosuppression.

LY3012207Disconti nuati ons:
In the event of permanent discontinuation of o laratumab/placebo therapy  due to an 
olaratum ab/placebo -related toxi city, pati ents m ay continue on gem citabine and docetaxel  
treatm ent per protocol .  If either gemcitabine or docetaxel are perm anently discontinued due to 
toxicity, the pati ent shoul d discont inue act ive treatment with the gemcitabine/docetaxel 
combinat ionif it is unclear which individual agent is the cause o f the toxicit y.  If toxici ty is 
clearly  related to one agent or the other, for example neuropathy due to docetaxel, only that agent 
shoul d be discont inued .   The patient may cont inue treatment with olaratumab/placebo alone, at 
the discret ion of the invest igator , if gemcitabine and /ordocetaxel are permanently discont inued.  
Any changes in treatments being added to or removed fro m patient care will be recorded on the

9.4.1.2.1.1. Dose Level Reductions
In the case of toxicit y related to myelo suppressio n and its complications, the relat ive roles of 
gemcitabine and docetaxel  are often impossible to separate, and thus it is expected such toxicit y 
woul d resul t in dose reductions of both agents. In cases where AEs, in the opinion o f the 
investigator, are more likely  due to one drug than another, adjust ment of one of the 
chemotherapy agents and not the other is permissible.   
Dose l evel reduct ions for gem citabine and 
docet axel are shown in Table JGDL. 3.
The infusio n time o f gemci tabine after i ts dose reducti on may  be maintained at 90 minutes 
(
±5min) or may be shortened to keep a rate of approximately  10mg/m2/minaccording to 
discreti on of  the invest igator. The infusio n start and stop times must be reco rded.

treatments ,delay  gemcitabine and docetaxel for a maximum 
of 2weeks, until recover y to Grade ≤1.  If recover y to 
Grade ≤1 does not occ ur, discontinue gemcitabine and
docetaxel.   A second dose reduction (to gemcitabine

Note:  Bilirubin refers to total bilirubin .
ForGrade ≥2 nonhematologic organ -related toxicities(excluding alopecia) , delay treatm ent until 
recover yto Gr ade ≤1 or pre -therapy  baseline . Treatment may be delayed for up to 14days to 
allow a patient sufficient time to recover from study drug -related toxi city. If recovery  to Grade 
≤1 does not occur within this allowed time , discontinue gemcitabine and docetax el.If the patient 
continues to experience the same toxicities, a second dose reduction (per Table JGDL. 3) is 
allowed.  G em
citabine and docetaxel  treatm entshoul d be di scontinued if toxicit ies recur in spite 
of 2 dose reducti ons. In general, Grade 3 nonhematologic toxicit ies (excluding electroly te 
toxicities that respond to supplemental treatment )require dose reduction.   Permanent 
discontinuat ion of gemcitabine and docetaxel is indicated for Grade 3 organ -related toxici ty that 
recurs despite up to 2dose reduction s.  Docetaxel  shoul d be reduced for Grade 2 neurologic 
toxicity and permanent ly discont inued for Grade 3 neuro logic toxi city.  Gem citabine and 
docetaxel should be p ermanent ly discont inued for Grade 4 nonhematologic toxicit y unless 
previously discussed wit h the Lilly CRP/CRS.
Pulmo nary toxicity has been reported with the use of gemcitabine. In cases of severe lung

9.4.1.2.2. Olaratumab/Placebo
9.4.1.2.2.1. Infusion -Related Reactions
As wi th other m onocl onal antibodies, hypersensit ivity react ions m ay occur during or following 
olaratum ab administration.
A 1-hour observat ion peri od is requi red after the administrati on of olaratum ab/placebo in the 
first and second cy cles.  If there i s no evidence of an IRR during the init ial 2 cycles of 
olaratum ab/placebo, then no observat ion peri od is requi red for subsequent treatment cy cles.  In 
the event that a Grade 1 or 2 IRR occurs after Cycle 2, the 1
-hour observat ion peri od will  be 
reinst ituted for a minimum of 2 cycles.  The reinst ituted observat ion peri od m ay be suspended 
after 2 cy cles if the pat ient shows no further signs or symptoms of an IRR.   During the 
observat ion peri od, pati ents treated with olaratumab /placebo shoul d be cl osely  monitored f or 
signs and symptoms indicat ive of an infusio n reactio n by the medical staff fro m the start of the 
infusio n unt il at least 1 hour after the end of th e infusion in an area where emergency  medical 
resuscitat ion equipment and other agents (epinephrine , predniso lone equivalents, etc. ) are 
available.
Olaratum ab/placebo infusio n reactions will be defined according to the NCI -CTCAE Version 4.0
definition of  infusio n
-related r eactions.
Symptom s occurring during or following infusio n of investigational therapy  may also be defined 
according to AE categories such as allergic react ion, anaphylaxis, or cy tokine rel ease syndrom e 
(NCI -CTCAE Version4.0section “Immune system disorders”). In the setting of symptoms or 
signs occurring during or fo llowing infusio n of investigational therapy , invest igators are 
encouraged to use the AE term s that describe the event, and mark “yes” or “no” for 
hypersen sitivity/IRR event flag .
For pati ents who experience a Grade 1 or 2 IRR, the infusio n should be stopped and the patient 
treated with the following (or equivalent) medicat ions intravenously : a histamine H1 antagonist 
(for example ,diphenhydramine hydrochloride), glucocortico id (for exam ple,dexamethasone), 
acetaminophen, and oxy gen (as indicated ), according to standard medical pract ices.  After 
recovery , the infusio n rate shoul d be decreased 50% for the duration of the infusio n. Patients 
who have experienced a prior Grade 1 or 2 IRR to olaratum ab (or pl acebo) , should be 
prem edicated wi th the following (or equivalent) medicat ions: a histamine H1 antagonist ( for 
example , diphenhydramine) intravenously and glucocorti coid (for example , dexamethasone)
intravenously , 
acetaminophen, and any  other m edicati onsas appropri ate for prophylaxis of IRR , 
approximately  30to 60 minutes prior to all subsequent olaratum ab/placebo infusio ns.  In 
addition, the 1hour post infusio n observation period s hould be reinstated as per Section 9.2.1 .  If 
subsequent infusio ns are then tolerated with the use of premedicat ions as above and a 50% 
decrease in infusio n rate, the infusio n rate m ay be increased to a rate deemed appropriate by  the 
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 64
LY3012207investigator, as long as it does not exceed 25mg/min.  For olaratumab -pretreated patients who 
experienced a Grade 1 or 2 IRR during their prior treatment regimen ( that is, prior to 
rando mizat ion in this study ), the infusio n rate that was last tolerated should be the infusion rate 
for both doses of olaratumab in Cycle 1.   If tolerated, in subsequent cycles ,the infusio n rate may 
be increased to a rate deemed appropriate b y the investigator, as long as it does not exceed 
25mg/min.
A Grade 3 or 4 IRR will require immediate treatment, including the use of epinephrine, 
bronchodilators, and/or glucocortico ids for symptomat ic bronchospasm ; IV flui ds and/or 
pressors f or hy potensi on; and immediate and permanent discont inuat ion of all study  treatm ent
with appropri ate supporti ve care.
If a patient experiences an IRR to olaratum ab/placebo , all attem pts shoul d be m ade to obtain an 
anti-olaratum ab/placeb o antibody and olaratum ab/placebo PK blood sam plesas close to the 
onset of the event as possible, at the resolut ion of the event, and 30 days (±3days)following the 
event.   The procedure for sample collection and handling is described in a separate procedural 
manual.

LY3012207Table JGDL.7. General Guidelines for Dose Modification Due to Nonhematologic 
Toxicit ies Deemed Related to Olaratumab/Placebo
Reac tion Grade Required Dose Modification
Grade 1 No dose modification is required.
Grade 2 At the investigator’s discretion, the pat ient may  continue to receive olaratumab/placebo per 
protocol, provided that the event does not pose a serious health risk or is easily treated.
Grade 3 For a Grade 3 toxicity not adequately controlled with appropriate supportive care, the dose 
must be withheld until organtoxicity is ≤ Grade 1 or has returned to pretreatment baseline; 
then treatment may resume at a reduced dose of 12 mg/kg for the 15 -mg/kg dose level and 
reduced dose of 15mg/kg for the 20 -mg/kg dose level .  If to xicity  recurs after therapy 
resume s, a second dose reduction ( second dose reduction of 10 mg/kg for the 15 -mg/kg dose 
level and12mg/kg for the 20 -mg/kg dose level )is permitted.
Grade 4 The dose must be withheld until dose toxicity is ≤ Grade 1 or has returned to baseline.  
Permanent discontinuation should be considered for any patient experiencing Grade 4 
nonhematologic toxicity assessed as related to olaratumab/placebo. However, if resumption 
of dosing is deemed appropriate by the investigator, treatment may resume only after 
consultation with the Lilly study physician, with the dose reduced to 10 mg/kg for the 15 -
mg/kg dose level ; dose reduced to 15 mg/kg for the 20 -mg/kg dose level .  If Grade 4 toxicity 
recurs after therapy resumes, all study treatment will be discontinued.
9.5. Blinding
Phase 1b:
This partis an open -label study .
Phase 2:
This is thedoubl e-blind edpartof the study .
During enro llment and prior to the interim efficacy analysis , only a minimum number of Lilly 
personnel will see the rando mizat ion table and treatment assignments before the study  is 
complete.   Individuals (IWRS, clinical trials materials management, Global Pat ient Safet y, and 
data m anagement personnel) validat ing the database willnot have access to aggregate summary  
reports or statist ics.  PK and/or immunogenicit y data that coul d unblind the study  will not be 
reported to invest igative sites or other blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded.
Upon final analyses of the study , invest igators may unblind pat ients to study  treatm ent 
assignment.
Efficacy informat ion (as outlined in Sect ion 10.1)will not be shared with sites unt il the study is 
completed (see Secti on8.1.6 ).  Treatment assignment will be scrambled in the reporting database 
until the database lock for data analysis.  This will ensure unblinded aggregate efficacy results 
are not available unt il the time o f final data analysis.
If an invest igator, site personnel performing assessments, or patient is unblinded, the pat ient may 
be discont inued fro m study  treatm ent.  In cases where there are ethical reasons to have the 
patient rem ain on study  treatm ent, the invest igator must obtain specific approval fro m a Sponsor 
physician or designee for the patient to continue on study treatm ent.
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 67
LY30122079.5.1. Emergency Unblinding
Phase 2 :
In case of an emergency , the invest igator has the sole responsibilit y for determining if unblinding 
of a pati ent’s treatm ent assignment is warranted.  Patient safet y must always be the first 
consideration in making such a determinat ion.  If the invest igator decides that unblinding is 
warranted, the invest igator should make every effo rt to con tact the Lilly CRP /CRS prior to 
unblinding a patient’s treatment assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the 
patient.  If a pati ent’s treatment assignment is unblinded, Lilly must be notified immediately.
All events resul ting in an unblinding event must be recorded and reported through the IWRS. If 
the invest igator or patient beco mes unblinded in the IWRS, that patient willbe discont inued 
from study  treatm ent.
9.5.2. Inadvertent Unblinding
Every  effort will be m ade to blind both the patient and the invest igator to the ident ity of the 
treatm ent, but the inadvertent unblinding of a patient may occur.  A double -blind study  design is 
known to be imperfect in the oncoly tic setti ng because the pot ential for individual unblinding 
exists due to treatment -related si gns and symptom s.  If an invest igator, site personnel performing 
assessments, or patient is unblinded, the unblinding will not be sufficient cause (in and of itself) 
for that pati ent to be discont inued fro m study  treatment or excl uded from  any safet y or efficacy  
analyses.
Addit ionally , there m ay be ethical reasons to have the patient remain on the study  treatm ent.  F or 
patients to con tinue on study  treatm ent in the event of unblin ding, the invest igator must obtain 
specific approval fro m a Lilly CRP /CRS for the pati ent to continue in the study .
9.6. Concomitant Therapy
All conco mitant m edicat ions should be recorded throughout the patient’s participat ion in the 
study .
Concomitant medicat ions and supportive care therapies must also be documented at the time o f 
discontinuat ion and at the 30 -day short -term follow-up visit.
With the exceptions listed in the sect ions below, no other chemotherapy, invest igational
medicat ions, other anticancer therapy , immunotherapy , horm onal cancer therapy , radi ation, 
surgery  for cancer, or invest igationalmedicat ions will be permitted while pa tients are on study  
treatm ent.
Bisphosphonate osteoclast inhibitors ( for example , zoledronic acid or pamidronate) for treatment 
of bone metastases will be permitted while pat ients are on study  treatm ent.  However, the 
osteocl ast inhibitor denosumab is a monoclonal antibody  and coul d confound safet y analysis in 
the study  if the pati ent experie nces a hypersensit ivity reacti on to denosum ab.  Therefore, 
concomitant use of denosumab will not be permitted.
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 68
LY3012207Appropriate documentation for all forms of premedicat ions, supportive care, and concomitant 
medicat ions (for example , medicat ions such as sedatives, ant ibiotics, analgesics, ant ihistamines, 
corticosteroi ds, erythropoi etin;procedures such as paracentesis, thoracentesis; or blood products 
such as blood cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma transfusio ns)must be captured on the eCRF .
9.6.1. Suppo rtive Care
Patients shoul d receive full supportive care, if necessary .  Pati ents will  receive supportive care as 
judged by  their treating physician.  If it is unclear whether a therapy  shoul d be regarded as 
supportive care, the investigator should consult the Lilly C RP.  Use of any  supportive care 
therapy  must be captured on the eCRFs.
9.6.1.1. Granulocyte -Colony Stimulating Factors
G-CSF use is recommended in all cycles for patients with a prior history o f pelvic radiation.  For 
all other patien ts, G-CSF use is recommended per the guidelines outlined in Table JGDL. 2.
Patients wi th a pri or history  of pelvic radia tion who requi re chem otherapy  dose reducti on despi te 
prophylact ic G-CSF are not required to have prophylact ic G-CSF in subsequent cy cles if per 
investigator assessment such chemotherapy  dose reducti ons adequately  address the ri sk of 
further myelo suppressio n.
Prophylactic use of G -CSF shoul d consist of at l east 5 day s of G -CSF ( 5 micrograms/kg/day  
subcutaneously) beginning on Day  9, or a single dose of peg -GCSF ( 6 mg, subcutaneously) on 
Day 9 or 10.
9.6.1.2. Transfusion of Blood Products
Transfusio ns of red blood cells, platelets, or other blood products are permitted at the 
investigator’s discret ion, but may not be used to meet hematologic criteria for inclusion in the 
study  (refer to Secti on7.1,
 Inclusio n Criterion [9]).
9.6.1.3. Antiemetic Therapy
Both prophylactic and symptom -directed ant iemetic therap
iesare recommended and should be 
used in accordance wit h institutional guidelines (when existent) and/or at investigator’s 
discreti on.
9.6.2. Prohibited Therapies
Addit ional concurrent chemotherapy , radiati on therapy , biologic response m odifiers, or other 
investigat ional or approv ed anticancer agents may  not be administered to patients on this study .  
Palliat ive radiat ion or surgery  to symptom atic sites of disease will not be permitted while on 
study .
9.6.2.1. Effect of CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers on Do cetaxel
Docetaxel is a CYP3A4 substrate. In vitro studies have shown that the metabo lism of docetaxel 
may be modified by the conco mitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are 
metabo lized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Avoid concurrent use o f docetaxel with inhibitors and 
inducers of CYP3A4. Refer to Attachment 7 for a list ofcommo nCYP3A4 inducers and 
inhibitors .  Use of a drug that is listed in Attachm ent 7 when there is no appropriate clinical 
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 69
LY3012207subst itute for that drug will not be considered a protocol vio lation.Close m onitoring for toxi city 
and a docetaxel dose reduction could be considered if systemic administration of a potent 
CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avo ided.
9.7. Treatment Compliance
The study  medicat ion will be administered only at the invest igational sites by  the authorized 
study  personnel.  As a result, treatment compliance is ensured.   Treatment compliance will be 
monitored by  drug accountabilit y records, and treatm ent administration data are recorded in the 
patient’s medical record and eCRF.  An investigator is required to prepare, maintain, and record 
all observat ions and other data pertinent to the investigation on each individual treated in this 
clinical trial.  All data reported on the eCRF must be derived from source documents and be 
consiste nt with the source documents.

Utilization , Safety  Evaluations, Sample Collection and 
Testing, and A ppropriateness of Measurements
Written inform ed consent m ust be obtained pri or to any  study -specific pretreatm ent eval uations.
Study  procedures related to efficacy, safet y, patient-reported outcome s, resource utilizat ion
measures, sample collect ion,and testing assessments and their timing are described in the 
sections below and shown in the Study  Schedule ( Attachm ent 1 ).
10.1. Efficacy Measures
10.1.1. Radiographic Assessments at Baseline an d during Study 
Treatment
Within 28 days before enrollment in Phase 1 b and randomizat ionin Phase 2 , baseline tumor 
measurements will be performed on each pat ient.  Computed tomography (CT), including spiral 
CT scans and MRI are the pre ferred me thods of measurement .
The CT portion of a positron emission tomography ( PET)-CT scan may be used as a method of 
response assessment if the site can document that the CT is o f ident ical diagnostic qualit y to a 
diagnosti c CT (wi th intravenous and oral contrast). A PET scan alone or as part of a PET -CT 
may be performed for addit ional analyses but cannot be used to assess response according to 
RECIST .
The m ethod of assessment used at baseline must be used consistent ly for tum or assessment and 
will be repeated every 6 weeks (±7 day s), as calculated from date of enrollment for Phase 1b or 
rando mizat ionfor Phase 2 . Patients will be evaluated for response according to RECIST, v 1.1 
guidelines (Eisenhauer et al. 2009) , as outlined in Attachm ent 5 .
A Lilly  designated imaging core lab willcollect and store all tumor assessment images on all 
enrolled patients throughout the study. An independent review of all or a randomly selected 
subset of pat ient scans may be performed by an independent panel of radio logists.
After the primary  analysis of OS and unt il study  complet ion, Lilly will cont inue to collect all 
further anticancer treatment , subsequent disease progression date, and survival data on all 
patients but m ay reduce data collect ion for other efficacy data.  Th e frequency and ty pes of  
efficacy  assessments (other than collect ion of OS data) will be at the discret ion of the 
investigator, based on the standard of care.  Lilly will notify  investi gators when this reduced data 
collect ion begins and ends.
During the continued access period, efficacy assessments (frequency and type of assessments) 
will be at the discretion of the invest igator, based on the standard of care , and these data will not 
be co llected or analyzed.
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 71
LY301220710.1.2. Radiographic Assessments during the S tudy Period 
Postdiscontinuation Follow -Up
Postdiscontinuati on follow-up during the study  period will be conducted as described in the 
Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).
For those patients who discont inue study  treatm ent wi thout obj ectively measured PD, the 
investigat ive sites will cont inue to monitor patients and periodically evaluate tumor response 
every 6 weeks (±7 days) as calculated from enrollment (Phase 1b) or randomizat ion(Phase 2) by 
the sam emethod used at baseline and throughout the study  until the pati ent has object ive disease 
progression, or until the final analysis of OS.  After the pati ent has obj ective di sease progressi on, 
radiologic tests are no longer required and the patient shoul d be followed up approximately  every 
3months (±7 day s) for the fi rst  year, then every 6 mo nths (±14 days) unt il the pat ient’s death or 
overall study  com pletion.
After final analysis of OS, during the Continued Access Period, efficacy assessments (frequency 
and t ype of assessments) will be at the discretion of the investigator, based on the standard of 
care.
Lilly will cont inue to collect all further ant icancer treatments, init ialsubsequent disease 
progression date, and survival data through study  com pletion but may reduce data collect ion for 
other efficacy data.  Lilly  will notify  invest igators when this reduced data collect ion begins and 
ends.
10.1.3. Primary Efficacy Measure
In the Pha se 2 partof the study , the primary  efficacy  measure is OS.   Overall survival durat ion is 
measured from the date of rando mizat ion to the date of death due to any cause.  For each patient, 
prior to each data analysis, a reasonable effort will be made to obtain the most up to date status 
of the pati ent (date of death or last date known to be alive). For each patient who is not known to 
have died as of the data -inclusio n cutoff date for a particular analysis, OS will be censored for 
that analysis a t the date the pati ent was l ast known to be alive .  For any  patient who has 
withdrawn consent for further fo llow-up of  survival  data, OS will  be censored at the l ast date for 
which the patient consented to be fo llowed for the study .
10.1.4. Additional Efficacy Mea sures
In the Phase 2 partof the study , the following additi onal efficacy measures will be determined 
for each pat ient, with planned statist ical analyses specified in Sect ion
 12and in the statistical 
analysis plan ( SAP;a separate docum ent).  Specific definit ions of each of these measures (such 
as defining events and censoring for each t ime to event endpo int) will b e provi ded in the SAP.  
The secondary  efficacy measures will be collected at the times shown in the Study  Schedule 
(Attachm ent 1 ).

10.2. Patient -Reported Outcomes/Resource Utilization
Patient reported pain will be assessed using the mBPI -sf (Cleeland et al . 1991).  Health -related 
qualit y of l ife will be assessed with the EORTC QLQ -C30 (Aaronson et al. 1993).  Health status 
will be assessed using the EQ -5D- 5L (Janssen et al. 2008).  The PRO measures will be co llected 
on Day  1 of every  cycle and at the 30 -day short term fo llow-up visit.  
Paper versions of the quest ionnaires will be used.  It is reco mmended that the instruments be 
administered together and in sequence order, at the beginning o f the visit prior to other study  
procedures, with the mBPI-sf presented fi rst, followed by  the EORTC QLQ -C30 and continuing 
with the EQ -5D- 5L.  Whenever possible, if administration is not possible prior to all other 
procedures, at least every  effort shoul d be made to administer at the same t ime point in e ach 
visit.Questionnaires should be administered to th e pati ent pri or to extensive interaction wit h site 
staff and m ust be com pleted pri or to study  drug administration.
Patient-reported questionnaires should be completed by pat ients when a language translat ion is 
available in which the pat ient is fluent or literate.
10.2.1. mBPI -sf
The m BPI-sf (Cleeland et al . 1991) i s an 11 -item instrum ent used as a mult iple-item measure of 
cancer pain intensit y.  In addi tion to pain intensit y (4 items), the mBPI -sf is designed for patients 
to record the presence of pain in general, pain relief, and pain interference with funct ion (general 
activit y, mood, abili ty to wal k, abilit y to perform norm al work, rel ations with others, sleep, and 
enjoyment of life).  T he mBPI -sf is administered per the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).  The 
recall period is the past 24 hours or last week and complet ion time is ty pically 5 to 7 minutes.
Responses for the mBPI -sf items are captured through the use of 11 -point numeric rating scales 
anchored at 0 ( no pain ordoes not interfere ) and ranged through 10 ( pain as bad as you can 
imagine orcompletely interferes ).  The focus of the analysis will be on the “worst pain”.  “Worst 
pain” intensit y has been shown to meaningfully impact patients’ lives as indicated by  a strong 
correl ation with functional interference scores in various ty pes of c ancer (Daut et al . 1983; 
Serlin et al. 1995; Ger et al. 1999; McMillan et al. 2000; Shi et al. 2009).  Moreover, a study  by 
Stone et al. (2004) suggested that patients’ tendency to focus on the most severe level o f pain 
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 73
LY3012207during a recall period may bias average recalled pain. Therefore, t he focus of the analysis will 
be on the “worst pain”.
Analgesic use will be recorded on the eCRF.  Data on each individual prescript ion and 
over-the-counter analgesic medicat ion will be recorded on the Concomitant Medicat ions eCRF ,
including but not limited to drug name and mode of administration.  The use of analgesics should 
be reviewed with the patient during each visit.  Any  changes to analgesic use (new or stopped 
analgesics) will be recorded on the eCRF.  Analgesics will be classified into 1 of 6 categories, 
using an analgesic ladder approach with medicat ion category  based on a World Healt h 
Organizat ion scale outlined in Table JGDL.8.  A therapy category  will be assigned according to 
the maximum category  of therapy  routinely administered based on analgesic data for that cycle.
The m BPI-sf popul ation will include all pat ients who com pleted the baseline assessment 
(Cycle1 Day 1)followed by at least 1 mBPI -sf “wors t pain” assessment after 1 cy cle of study  
drug (Cycle 2 Day 1 or l ater).

10.2.2. EORTC QLQ -C30
Broadly used in cancer trials, validated, and available in over 80 different languages, the EORTC
QLQ -C30 (Aaronson et al. 1993) is a reliable and validated tool. The EORTC QLQ -C30 v3.0 is
a self -administered, cancer -specific ques tionnaire wi th multidimensio nal scales. The EORTC
QLQ -C30 self -reported general cancer instrument consists of 30 items covered by  1 of 3 
dimensio ns:
global heal th status/qualit y of life (2 items)
funct ional scales (15 total items addressing eit her physical, role, emotional, cognit ive, or
social functioning)
symptom  scales (13 total items addressing either fatigue, nausea/vomit ing, pain, dyspnea,
insomnia, appetite loss, constipat ion, diarrhea, or financial impact)
The EORTC QLQ -C30 questi onnaire is administered per the Study  Schedule ( Attachm ent 1 ).  
The recall period is the past week, complet ion time is ty pically 5 to 7 minutes, and the
questionnaire will be scored as described by the EORTC scoring manual (Fayers et al. 2001).   
The EORTC population will include all pat ients who com pleted the baseline assessment (Cycle 1
Day 1) followed by at least 1 EORTC assessment after 1 dose of study drug (Cy cle 2 Day  1 or
later).
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 74
LY301220710.2.3. EQ-5D-5L
The EQ -5D- 5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of self -reported heal th status
(Herdman et al. 2011).  Specifically , this quest ionnaire is included in this trial to evaluate 
healt h-state utilit ies associated with advanced STS.  These utilit y measures are an important 
input for economic evaluat ions concerning the value of treatment intervent ions.
The EQ -5D- 5L is designed to be used in conjunct ion wi th other pati ent-reported measures.  
Patients will  com plete the 5 -dimensio n (mobility, self -care, usual act ivities, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiet y/depressi on), 5-level (no problem, slight, moderate, severe, or extreme problem) 
assessment according to the Stu dy Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).  A unique EQ -5D healt h state is 
defined by co mbining 1 level fro m each of the 5 dimensions. Addit ionally, patients will indicate 
their current health status by  marking on a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 100 (best 
imaginable healt h state) to 0 (worst imaginable healt h state).
The recall period is “today .”  The EQ -5D- 5L is designed for self -completion by responde nts and 
is cognit ively  simple, taking only  a few minutes to complete.
The EQ-5D- 5L populat ion will include all pat ients who completed the baseline assessment 
(Cycle 1 Day 1) followed by at least 1 EQ -5D-5L assessment after 1 dose of study  drug (Cycle 2 
Day 1 or later) .
EQ-5D- 5L responses may be incorporated into cost utilit y analyses, but will not be included in 
the clinical study  report.
10.2.4. Resource Utilization
Invest igators will be asked to document the use of best supportive care measures, concomitant 
medicat ions, transfusio ns, and treatment -related hospitalization days.  Such assessments are to be 
taken throughout the study  through the 30 -day short -term postdi scont inuat ion follow-up visit .
10.3. Safety Evaluations
Invest igators are responsible for monitoring the safety of pat ients who have entered this study  
and for al erting Lilly or its designee to any  event that seems unusual, even if this event may be 
considered a n unant icipated benefit to the patient.
The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of pat ients during the study
.
The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate he alth care opti on, 
AEs that are serious, considered related to the study, or that caused the patient to discont inue 
before complet ing the study.  The patient should be fo llowed unt il the event is resolved or 
explained.  Frequency  of follow-up evaluati on is left to the discretion of the invest igator.
The timing of all safet y evaluat ions is shown in the Study  Schedule ( Attachm ent 1 ).

10.3.1. Adverse Events
Lilly has standards for reporting AEs that are to be fo llowed regardl ess of applicable regulatory  
requi rements that m ay be less stringent.  A clinical study  AE is any untoward medical event 
associated wi th the use of a drug in humans, whether or not it is co nsidered rel ated to that drug.
Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical trials, because the purpose of the clinical trial is to 
establish drug effect.
Any clinically  significant findings fro m electrocardi ogram s (ECGs), labs, or vi tal sign 
measurements that result in a diagnosis should be reported to Lilly or its designee.
Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposures to study  drugs shoul d be 
reported.  Data on fetal outcome and breast -feeding are collected for regulatory reporting and 
drug safet y evaluat ion.
Study  site personnel  will record the occurrence and nature of each patient’s preexist ing 
condi tions, including clinically  significant si gns and symptom s of the disease under treatment in 
the study .
After the informed consent form (ICF) is signed, before th e pati ent receives the first dose of 
study  treatm ent, site personnel will record the occurrence and nature of any  AEs and any  change 
in the preexist ing condit ion(s).  All AEs and SAEs related to protocol procedures are reported to 
Lilly or its desi gnee viaeCRF .
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 76
LY3012207In addit ion, all AEs occurring after the patient receives the first d ose of study  treatm entmust be 
reported to Lilly or its designee via eCRF.
Invest igators will be instructed to report to Lilly or its designee their assessment of the potential 
relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure, study drugs via eCRF .
Patients will  be evaluated for AEs at each visit and will be instructed to call their physician to 
report any  AEs between visi ts.
The NCI -CTCAE v 4.0will serve as the reference document for choosing appropriate 
termino logy for, and grading the severit y of, all AEs and other symptom s(NCI 2009)
.  For AEs 
without m atching termino logy wi thin the NCI -CTCAE v 4.0criteria,the investigator will be 
responsible for select ing the appropriate system organ class and assessing severit y grade based
on the intensit y of the event.
In addit ion to collect ing the AE verbat im and the CTCAE severit y grade, AE verbat im text wil l 
also be m apped by Lilly or its designee to corresponding termino logy within the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA ®) di ctionary.
If a patient’s dosage is reduced or treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study  site 
personnel must clearly  report to Lilly or its desi gnee via eCRF the ci rcumstances and data 
leading to any  such dosage reduction or discont inuation of treatment.
10.3.1.1. Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any  adverse event from  this study  that results in one of the fo llowing outcom es:
death
a life
-threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)
persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y
initial or prol onged inpatient hospitalizat ion
congenital ano maly/birth defect
considered significant by  the invest igator for any other reason
Important m edical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi talizati on may  be considered seri ous adverse drug events when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they  may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervent ion to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definit ion.
Serious adverse event collect ion begins after the patient has signed informed consent and has 
received study  treatm ents.  If a pati ent experi ences an SAE after si gning informed consent, but 
prior to receiving study  treatm ents, the event will not be reported as serious unless the 
investigator feels the event may  have been caused by  a protocol  procedure.
Data on SAEs that occur before the end of trial will be stored in the collect ion database and the 
Lilly Safety  System .
Study  site personnel  must al ert Lilly or its desi gnee of  any serious adverse event (SAE) within 
24 hours of invest igator awareness of the event via a Sponsor -approved method.  If study  site 
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 77
LY3012207personnel contact Lilly or its designee by  telephone regarding an SAE, study  site personnel  must 
also immediately provide official notificat ion on study -specific SAE forms.
This 24 -hour notificat ion requirement refers to the init ial SAE informat ion and all fo llow-up 
SAE informat ion.
Planned surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has 
worsened during the course of the study .
Planned hospi talizat ions or procedures for preexisting condit ions that are already recorded in the 
patient’s medical history  at the time of study  enro llment should not be considered SAEs.  
Hospitalization or prolongat ion of hospitalizat ion without a preci pitating clinical AE (for 
example, for t he administration of study treatm ent or other protocol -requi red procedure) shoul d 
not be considered SAEs.
Serious adverse events due to disease progressi on, including death, shoul d not be reported unless 
the invest igator deems them tobe possibl y related to the study  treatm ents.
The invest igator does not need to actively mo nitor pati ents f or AEs once the trial has ended, 
unless provided otherwise in the protocol ; however, i f an invest igator becomes aware of an SAE 
occurring after the patient’s participat ion in the trial has ended, and the investigator believes that 
the SAE is related to a protocol procedure or study treatments , the invest igator should repo rt the 
SAE to the Sponsor, and the SAE will be entered in the Lilly Safety  System .
Inform ation on SAEs expected in the study  popul ation independent of drug exposure and that 
will be assessed by  the Sponsor in aggregate periodically du ring the course of the trial may be 
found in the IB.
10.3.1.2. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed 
in the Development Core Safet y Informati on (DCSI) in the IB and that the invest igator identifies 
as rel ated to the study  treatm ents or study  procedure.  United S tates 21 CFR 312.32 and 
European Unio n Clinical Trial Direct ive 2001/20/EC and the associated detailed guidances or 
national regulatory  requi rements in parti cipat ing countries require the reporting o f SUSARs.  
Lilly has procedures that will be fo llowed for the recording and expedited reporting of SUSARs 
that are consistent with glo bal regulat ions and associated detailed guidances.
10.3.1.3. Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) are events that have been ident ified as safet y signals 
during preclinical or early  clinical tri als or based on class effects of similar drugs.  These events 
will be mo nitored prospectively in the clinical developmental program.  Each event is defined by  
a careful assessment and grouping of individual related MedDRA preferred terms.

10.3.2. Other Safety Measures
10.3.2.1. Electrocardiograms
Twelve -lead ECGs will be collected according to the Study Schedule( Attachm ent 1 ).  Patients 
must be supine for approximately  5 to 10 minutes before ECG collect ion and remain supine but 
awake during ECG collect ion.
Electrocardiograms may be obtained at addit ional times , when deemed clinically necessary .  
Collect ion of more ECGs than expected at a particular time point is allowed when needed to 
ensure high qualit y records.
Electrocardiograms will be interpreted by  a qualified physician (the investigator or qualified 
designee) at the site as soon after the time of ECG collect ion as possible, and ideally while the 
patient is st ill present, to determine whether the patient meets entry criteria and for immediate 
patient management, should any  clinically relevant findings be identified.
Table JGDL.10 provi des the Fridericia ’s QT correctio n formula.
Table JGDL.10. Fridericia ’s QT Correction Formula
FormulaFridericia 
QTc F= QT /(RR)1/3
Abbreviations:  QT = ECG interval measured from the onset of the QRS complex to the offset of the T wave; QTcF 
= QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia’s formula; RR = time between corresponding points on 2 
consecutive R waves on ECG.
After enro llment, if a clinically significant increase in the QT/corrected QT (QTc) interval fro m 
baseline (Table JGDL.10) , or other clinical ly significant quanti tative or qualitat ive change fro m 
baseline, i s present, the invest igator will assess the patient for symptoms (for example, 
palpitations, near syncope, syncope) and to determine if the patient can cont inue in the study .  
The invest igator or qualified designee is responsible for determining if any change in pat ient 
management is needed and must document his/her review of the ECG printed at the time of 
evaluat ion.
For Phase 1b, all digital ECGs w ill be electroni cally  transmi tted to a desi gnated central ECG 
laboratory .  
A cardio logist at the central ECG laboratory  will then conduct a full overread on the 
ECG (including all intervals); a report based on data from this analysis will be issued to the 
investigat ive site.  All data from the overreads will be placed in the Lilly database for analyt ical 
and study  report purposes.
When there are differences in ECG interpretation between the invest igator (or qualified 
designee) and the cardio logist at the central  ECG laboratory , the investigator (or qualified 
designee’s) interpretation will be used for study  entry  and immediate patie nt management.  
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 79
LY3012207Interpretations from the cardio logist at the central  ECG laboratory  will be used for data analysis 
and report writ ing purposes.   The invest igator (or qualified designee) must document his/her 
review of the ECG printed at the time of evaluat ion, the final overread ECG report issued by  the 
central  ECG l aboratory , and any alert reports .
10.3.3. Safety Monitoring
The Lilly CRP/CRS will m onitor saf ety data throughout the course of the Phase 1b partof the 
study and blinded safety data throughout the course of the Phase 2 partof the study .
Lilly will review SAEs wit hin time frames mandated by co mpany procedures.  The Lilly
CRP /CRS will, as is appropriate, consult with the funct ionally  independent Gl obal Pat ient Safet y 
therapeuti c area physician or clinical scient ist, and review:
trends in safety  data
laboratory  analy tes 
AESI (as defined in Sect ion10.3.1.3 )
If a patient experiences elevated ALT >5 ×ULN and elevated total bilirubin >2 ×ULN, clinical 
and laboratory  monitoring shoul d be ini tiated by  the invest igator. For pat ients entering the study  
with ALT >3 ×ULN, m onitoring shoul d be tri ggered at ALT >2 ×baseline.   Details for hepat ic 
monitoring depend upon the severit y and persistence of observed laboratory  test 
abnorm alities.To ensure patient safety and co mply with regulatory  guidance, the invest igator is 
to consul t with the Lilly CRP regarding co llection of specific reco mmended clinical information 
and fo llow-up laboratory  tests. See0.
For the Phase 2 partof the study , in the event that safet y monitoring uncovers an issue that needs 
to be addressed by  unblinding at the group l evel, only  members of the data m onitoring 
committee (an advisory  group for this study  formed to protect the integrit y of data; refer to 
Secti on12.2.14 )
 can conduct addit ional analyse s of the safet y data.
For the Phase 2 partof this study , in which survival is a primary endpo int, all deaths and SAE 
reports will be reviewed in a blinded manner by Lilly during the clinical trial.  These reports will 
be reviewed to assure completeness and accuracy but will not be unblinded to Lilly during the 
clinical trial.  If a death or other clinical AE is deemed serious, unexpected, and possibly related 
to study  treatments, only Lilly Global Patient Safety  representatives external to the study  team  
will be unblinded for regulatory  reporti ng and safety  monitoring purposes.  These measures will 
preserve the integrit y of the data collected during this trial and minimize any potential for bias 
while providing for appropriate safet y monitoring.
10.3.4. Complaint Handling
Lilly collects product complaints on study  treatm entused in clinical trials in order to ensure the 
safet y of study  participants, m onitor qua lity, and to facilitate process and product improvements.
Com plaint s related to docetaxel and/or gemcitabine are reported direct ly to the manufacturers of 
those drugs/devices in accordance with the package insert.
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 80
LY3012207For blinded studies, all product complaints associated with material packaged, labeled, and 
released by Lilly or its designee will be reported.
The invest igator or his/her designee is responsible for handling the fo llowing aspects o f the 
product complaint process in accordance wit h the instructions provided for this study :
recording a complete descript ion of the product complaint reported and any associated 
AEs using the study -specific co mplaint form s provided for this purpose
faxing the com pleted product complaint form wit hin 24 hours to Lilly or its desi gnee
If the invest igator is asked to return the product for invest igation, he/she will return a copy  of the 
product complaint form with the product.
10.4. Sample Collection and Testing
Attachm ent 1 lists the schedule for sample collect ions in this study.
Attachm ent 2 lists the specific tests that will be performed for this study  and whether these will 
be perform ed at a central or local laboratory.
10.4.1. Samples for Study Qualification and Health Monitoring
Blood and urine samples will be collected to determine whether patients meet 
inclusio n/excl usion criteria and to m onitor pati ent heal th.  Eligibilit y for inclusio n in this clinical 
trial will be based on l ocal clinical  laboratory  results (not transcribed onto eCRFs) and duplicate 
samples will be submitted to the central laboratory.   Treatment decisio ns may be based upon 
resul ts of tests perform ed locally. If local laboratory  tests are used for this purpose, then a 
duplicate specimen must be submitted to the central laboratory . Discrepancies between local and 
central  laboratory  that may have an impact on eligibilit y or treatm ent deci sions will  not be 
considered protocol deviat ions.
Invest igators must document their review of each laboratory  safety  report.
Laboratory /analy te resul ts that coul d unblind the study  will not be reported to invest igative sites 
or other blinded personnel until the study  has been unblinded.
Samples co llected for specified laboratory tests will be destroyed wit hin 60 days of receipt of 
confirmed test results.  Tests are run and confirmed prompt ly whenever scient ifically 
appropriate.  When scientific circumstances warrant, however, it is acceptable to retain samples 
to batch the tests run, or to retain the samples until the end of the study  to confirm  that the resul ts 
are valid.  Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to comply wit h 
applicable laws, regulat ions, or l aboratory  certificati on standards.
10.4.2. Biomarker Samples for Storage and Research
Biomarker research is performed to address questions of relevance to drug disposit ion, target 
engagement, pharmacodynamics, mechanism o f action, variabilit y of pat ient response (including 
safet y), and clinical outcome.  Sample collect ion is incorporated in to clinical studies to enable 
examinat ion of these questions through measurement of bio molecules including 
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 81
LY3012207deoxy ribonucleic acid ( DNA ), ribonucleic acid ( RNA ), proteins, lipids, and other cellular 
elements.
As part of Lil ly’s ongoing efforts to understand the relat ionship between cancer, genet ics, and 
response to therapy , this study  will analyze bio markers relevant to olaratumab, gem citabine, 
docetaxel ,and/or STS. The study  will analyze the correlat ion between bio markers and clinical 
outcom e and m ay be used for related research methods or validat ion of diagnostic tools or 
assays.
Samples for bi omarker research will be co llected at times specified in Attachment 6 , where local 
regul ations allow.
Where local regulat ions and ERBs allow, the fo llowing samples will be co llected for biomarker 
research as summarized below, specified in the Study  Schedule, and discussed in detail in the 
following subsect ions:
whole blood sam ple for geneti c research (see Section10.4.2.1 )
tumor tissue (newly obtained or archived) (see Section10.4.2.2 )
plasma for bi omarkers (see Section10.4.2.3 )
10.4.2.1. Whole Blood Sample for Genetic Research
A blood sam ple will be collected for pharmacogenetic analysis as specified in t he Sampling 
Schedule (Attachment 6 ), where local regulat ions allow .
Samples will  notbe used to conduct unspecified dise ase or popul ation genet ic research either 
now or in the future.  Samples will be used to investigate variable response to study  treatm ent 
and to investigate genetic variants though t to pl ay a rol e in STS.  Assessment of variable 
response may include evalua tion of  adverse events or differences in efficacy.  These studies may 
include but are not limit ed to PDGFR , PDGFR ligands, and genes funct ional in the tumor 
microenvironment to evaluate their association wit h observed response to study  treatm ent.
All samples will be coded with the patientnumber.  These samples and any data generated can 
be linked back to the patient only by the study site personnel.  Sam ples will  be retained for a 
maximum o f 15 years after the last patient visit for the study, or for a shorter period if local 
regul ations and/or ERBs /IRBs impose shorter time limits, at a facilit y selected by  the Sponsor.  
This retentio n peri od enables use of new techno logies, response to regulatory  quest ions, and 
investigat ion of variable response that may not be observed unt il later in drug development or 
when the drug is commercially available.
Molecular techno logies are expected to improve during the 15 -year storage period and therefore 
cannot be specifically  named.  However, exist ing techno logiesinclude who le geno me or exo me 
sequencing, geno me wide association studies, candidate gene studies, and epi geneti c analyses.  
Regardless of the techno logy utilized, data generated will be used only  for the specific research 
scope described in this sect ion.
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 82
LY301220710.4.2.2. Tumor Tissue for Biomarker Research
Previously obtained archived f ormalin-fixed paraffin- embedded tissue will be requested both for 
a central  pathol ogy review to confirm the diagnosis of STS and histol ogic subty pe, and for 
exploratory  biomarker research .
Collect ion of m andatory  archived tum or tissue sample ornewly obtained biopsy is required in 
order to participat ein this study unless restri cted by  local regulat ions.  If an archived specimen is 
not available, submissio n of a newly obtained biopsy (obtained at b aseline) is required for 
participat ion in this study .
The availabilit y of tum or tissues is important to better characterize the relat ionship of tumor 
biology and response evaluat ion in this study .  As such, this study  is requesting submissio n of 
tumor tissue (newly biopsied or archived) to support correlat ive studies.
Formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded tum or tissue shoul d be provi ded as a block or unstained 
slides.  Due diligence should be used to make sure that tumor specimen (n ot a norm al adjacent or 
a tum or margin sample) is provided.  Pathology  notes accom panying archival tissue may  also be 
requested. The report must be coded with the patient number.  Personal identifiers, including the 
patient’s name and init ials must be removed fro m the inst itutional pathol ogy report pri or to 
submissio n. Archival blo cks will  be secti oned and returned to the study  site. Archival s lides and 
tissue samples co llected on -study  will not be returned .
Tumor tissue will  be examined for bio markers that may include, but are not limited to, those 
related to STS, study  treatm ent and/or the mechanism of act ion of olaratumab .
Samples will  be retained for a m axim um of 15 y ears after the last patient visit for the study , or 
for a shorter peri od if local regulations and/or ERBs /IRBs impose shorter time limits, at a facilit y 
selected by  the Sponsor.  This retention period enables use of new techno logies, response to 
regul atory  questi ons, and invest igation of variable response that may not be observed unt il later 
in drug development or when the drug is co mmercially available.
Techno logies are expected to improve during t he 15 -year storage period and therefore cannot be 
specifically named.  However, exist ing approaches including mutation profiling, copy  number 
variabilit y, gene expressio n, and/or immunohistochemistry  may be perform ed on these ti ssue 
samples to assess poten tial associ ations wi th these bi omarkers and clinical outcomes.
10.4.2.3. Plasma Samples for Biomarker R esearch
Plasma sam ples f or non -pharmacogenet ic biomarker research will be collected at the times 
specified in the Sampling Schedule ( Attachment 6 ),where local regulat ions allow.
Samples will  be examined for bio markers related to cancer, variable response to study  treatm ent, 
the mechanism of act ion of  study  treatm ent, and/or for research -related m ethods, or validating 
diagnosti c tool s or assays.
Potenti al pharmacodynamics and/or circulating markers may  include, but are not limited to ,
PDGF -AA, PDGF -BB, and PDGF -CC.
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 83
LY3012207All biomarker samples will be coded with the patient number.  These samples and any  data 
generated can be linked back to the patient only by t he study site personnel.
Samples will  be retained for a m aximum  of15 years after the last patient visit for the study , or 
for a shorter peri od if local regulations and ERBs /IRBs impose shorter time limits, at a facilit y 
selected by  the Sponsor.  This retention period enables use of new techno logies, response to 
regul atory questi ons, and invest igation of variable response that may not be observed unt il later 
in drug development or when the drug is co mmercially available.
10.4.3. Samples for Immunogenicity Research
Blood sam ples f or immunogenicit y testing will  be collected to determine ant ibody  producti on
against olaratumab. To interpret the results of immunogenicit y, blood sam ples will  be collected
at the sam e time po ints as the blood samples designated to measure the serum concentrations of
olaratum ab (as noted in Section 10.4.4 ).
In the event of an olaratumab/placebo IRR, unscheduled blood samples will be co llected for 
additional immunogenici tyand PK analysis. These addit ional samples will be co llected as close 
as possible to the onset of the event, at the point of resolution fro m theevent, and 30 day s (± 3 
days) after onset of the event (as noted in Attachment 6).
Immunogenicit y will be assessed by  a validated assay  designed to detect anti -drug antibodies 
(ADA) inthe presence of the olaratumab. Antibodies may be further characterized and/or 
evaluated for their abili ty to neutralize the activit y of olaratum ab. Immunogenicit y may be 
further characterized by performing addit ional related assay s. The serum samples collected for
immunogenicit y testin g will  be stored at a facilit y designated by  the Sponsor.
Immunogenicit y informat ion that would unblind the study  will not be reported to invest igative
sites or blinded personnel unt il the study has been unblinded.
Samples may be stored for a maximum of 15 y ears f ollowing l ast pati ent visi t for the tri al at a
facilit y selected by  the Sponsor to enable further analysis of immune responses to olaratumab.   
The durati on allows the Sponsor to respond to regulatory  requests relate d to ol aratum ab.
10.4.4. Samples for Drug Concentration Measurements 
Pharmacokinetics
At the visit s and t imes specified in the Pharm acokinet ic and Immunogenicit y Sampling Schedule 
(Attachm ent 6 ), venous blood samples will  be collected to determine the serum concentrati ons of  
olaratum aband pl asma concentration sof gemci tabine and docetaxel .  A maximum o f 5samples 
may be collected at addit ional time points during the study ,if warranted and agreed upon 
between both the investigator and Lilly .  Instructi ons for the collection and handling of blood 
samples will be provided by  the Sponsor .  Itis preferred that the blood samples be obtained fro m 
a peripheral locat ion.  Bl ood sam ples will be allowed fro m central  access devices ,but a sam ple 
drawn fro m a centra l catheter of any t ype for PK must take precautions to prevent obtaining a 
dilute dsample.  If m ultiple sampl es are obtained centrally , the PK sample shoul d be the l ast 
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 84
LY3012207specimen drawn to reduce the potential for a diluted or improperly drawn sample.   The actual 
date and time ( 24-hour clock time ) of each sampling will be recorded.
These s amples will be analyzed at laborator iesdesignated by  the Sponsor.  Serum concentrations 
of olaratum abwill be assayed using a validated enzyme
-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
method .  Gem citabine (with its major m etabo lite, dFdU) and docetaxel concentrati ons in plasma 
will be analyzed using validated liquid chro matography wit h tandem mass spectrometry  
(LC/MS/MS) a ssays.
Drug concentration informat ion that wouldunblind the study  will not be reported to invest igative 
sites or blinded p ersonnel until the study has been unblinded.
The PK samples will be stored at a facilit y designated by  the Sponsor.   The remaining serum  and 
plasma f rom the samples collected for pharmacokinet ics may be pool ed and used for exploratory  
metabo lism work and other exploratory PK/pharmacodynamic work as deemed appropriate.
Bioanaly tical samples collected to m easure olaratumab, gem citabine ,and docetaxel
concentration will be retained for a maximum of 1 year fo llowing l ast pati ent visi t for the study .
10.5. Appropriateness of Measurements
The m easures used to assess safet y and efficacy in this study  are consistent wi th those used in 
most convent ionaloncol ogy trials.

records in the patient files as original source documents for the study .  If requested, the 
investigator will provide Lilly , applicable regul atory  agencies, and applicable ERBs with direct 
access to original source documents.
11.1. Data Capture S ystem
An electronic data capture sy stem  will be used in this trial.  The site mai ntains a separate source 
for the data entered by  the si te into the Sponsor -provided electronic data capture sy stem .
Case report form data will be encoded and stored in a clinical trial database.  Data managed by a 
central  vendor, such as laborat ory test data or ECG data, will be stored electronically in the 
central  vendor’s database system.  Data will subsequent ly be transferred from the central vendor 
to the Lilly generic labs system.
Any data for which the paper documentat ion provided by  the patient will serve as the source 
docum ent will be i dentified and documented by  each si te in that si te’s study  file.  Paper 
docum entati on provi ded by  the patient may include, for example, a paper diary  to collect PRO 
measures (for example, a rating scale), a daily dosing schedule, or an event diary.
Data from co mplaint forms submitted to Lilly will be encoded and stored in the global product 
complaint m anagement sy stem .
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 86
LY301220712. Sample Size and Statistical Methods
12.1. Determination of Sample Size
Phase 1b
The primary  object ive of the Phase 1b partis to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose of 
olaratum ab that m ay be safely administered in combinat ion with gemci tabine (900 m g/m2)and 
docetaxel (75 m g/ m2)to pati ents wi th locally advanced or metastati c STS . Section 8.1.1
outlines the study  design for the Phase 1b portion.  Approximately , a total  of 
45patients will  
ensure that at l east 1 5patients will be treated at the 15-mg/kg and 30 pati ents at the 20-mg/kg 
cohort (see also Section 8.1.1 .).
Phase 2
Based on the outcome of the Phase 1b part, the dose selected for the Phase 2 part of Study JGDL 
will be eit her 15 m g/kg, 20 m g/kg,or 2loading doses of 20 mg/kg during Cycle 1 fo llowed by 
15mg/kg in every  subsequent cycle. Thedosing regimen for olaratumab will remain Day s1 and 
8 of a 21- day cycle regardl ess of the dosing strategy  adopted.
The primary  object ive of the Phase 2 partis to compare olaratumab plus gemci tabine and 
docetaxel (experimental arm) versus place bo pl us gemci tabine/ docetaxel  (control  arm) in term s 
of OS
,in patients with locally advanced or metastatic STS ,who have not previously been treated 
with olaratum ab (the “o laratumab-naïve ”cohort) .
The Phase 2 part of the study will screen approximately 2 00olaratumab-naïve patients to 
rando mize 166 olaratumab-naïve patients in 1:1 randomizat ion (83 pati ents in the experimental 
arm and 83 patients in the control arm).  The primary ITT sample size of 166 was selected 
assuming the final analysis of OS will occur when at least 108 OS events in rando mized 
olaratumab-naïve patients have been observed (35% censoring).
The final total of 108OS events (deaths) in olaratumab -naïve pat ients provides 80% statist ical 
power for a two
-sided log-rank test at a 0. 20significance level (assuming the true OS HR is 
0.665).  An OS HR of 0. 665corresponds approximately to an increased median survival fro m 15 
months (est imated fro m published clinic al data in various t ypes of pat ients with advanced or 
metastati c STS) in placebo pl us gemcitabine and docetaxel to 22.5 months for olaratum ab plus 
gemcitabine and docetaxel .
In the event that OS is statist ically significant at the two -sided 0.20 alpha level, OS will also be 
compared to the m ore stringent two -sided 0.05 level.  In the event that OS is statistically 
significant at a two -sided 0.05 al pha l evel, then PFS will also be formally tested at a two -sided 
0.05 l evel. In the event that PFS is statistically significant at a two -sided 0.05 al pha level , then 
ORR will also be formally tested at a two -sided 0.05 level. This stati stical “gate -keeping” 
amongOS,PFS,and ORR ensures that an overall 0.05 alpha level is maintained, in the event 
that oneor moreendpo ints are statistically significant at the 0.05 level.
Akey secondary objective of the study  will be to com pare OS between the experi mental  arm and 
the control arm in pat ients with locally advanced or metastati c STS ,who have previously been 
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 87
LY3012207treated with o laratumab (the “o laratumab -pretreated” cohort) .   The Phase 2 part of the study will 
screen approximately 114 olaratum ab-pretreated patients to randomize 90olaratu mab-pretreated 
patients in 1:1 randomizat ion.
The sample size of 90 patients in the secondary cohort of “o laratumab -pretreated” patients was 
selected based on both statist ical and quali tative considerati ons.  See Secti on 12.2.14 for further 
discussio n of the rationale.
There will be aninterim efficacy  analysis planned for the Phase 2 partof the study .All available 
data on patient characterist ics, efficacy , and safet y outcom es will  be included for consi derat ion 
as part of the interim efficacy analysis. The primary  efficacy hypothesis will be tested at the 
interim efficacy  analysis using a no minal alph a level  of 0.00001.  The final analysis of the 
primary  efficacy  hypothesis will therefore be adjusted and tested at a nominal alpha level o f 
0.19999.
See Secti on
 12.2.14 and the study’s Statist ical Analysis Plan (a separate document) for further 
details regarding the interim efficacy analysis.
12.2. Statistical and Analytical Plans
12.2.1. General Considerations
Statistical analysis o f this study  will be the responsibilit y ofLilly .
All tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a 2 -sided al pha level of 0.05, unless otherwise 
stated.  All CIs will be given at a 2 -sided 95% level, unless otherwise stated .
Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment 
ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol.   Before unblinding of the aggregate 
database, minor modifications or clarificat ions to the data analysis methods may be described 
and just ified in the SAP.  Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the 
protocol , and the j ustificat ion for making the change, will be described in the clinical study  
report.
If study  data vi olate key  stati stical assumpt ionsofan analysis method, alternat ive statist ical 
methods m ay be used.
Unless specifically described otherwise, all baseline, efficacy, safety , 
and heal th outcom es
analyses will be performed separately for the olara tumab-naïve and olara tumab-pretreated 
cohorts.
Addit ional exploratory  analyses of the data will be conducted as deemed appropriate.
12.2.2. Analysis Population s
Phase 1b
Safety population: All enro lled patients who receive any quantit y of study  treatment , 
regardl ess of t heir eligibilit y for the study , will  be included in the safet y analysis. Safety 
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 88
LY3012207evaluat ion will be performed based on the actual init ial therapy a patient has received, 
regardl ess of any other cohort to which he or she was assigned.
Efficacy eval uation will be performed based on the cohort assigned, regardless of the actual 
dose l evel of therapy  received.
DLT -evaluable Population : The DLT -evaluable popul ation will include all enrolled 
patients who com plete Cy cle 1 or di scontinue due to a DLT prior to complet ing Cycle 1 
treatm ent.
Phase 2
TheIntent -to-Treat (ITT) population include sall randomized pat ients.In ITT populat ion,
patients will be allocated to treatment groups as rando mized, and not by actual treatment 
received. This populat ion will be used for baseline, efficacy, and heal th outcom e analyses.
Safety population:   will include all rando mized pati ents who received any  quant ity of study  
treatm ent, regardless o f their eligibili ty for the study . The safet y evaluation will be 
perform ed based on the actual study  treatm ent a pati ent has received, regardless o f the arm  to 
which he or she was rando mized. The safet y populat ion will be used for all dosing/exposure, 
adverse events, and resource utilizat ion analyses.
12.2.3. Patient Disposition
A detailed description o f patient di sposi tion will be provi ded.  It will include a summary  of the 
number and percentage of patients entered into the study , enrolled in the study , and treated as 
well as n umber and percentage of patients completing the study , or discont inuing (overall and by 
reason for discont inuat ion).  A summary  of all important protocol deviat ions will be provided.
12.2.4. Patient Characteristics
Descript ion of pat ient characterist ics at baselin e, such as pat ient demographics , baseline disease 
characterist ics, preexist ing condit ions, and pri or therapi es,will be reported using descript ive 
statist ics.
12.2.5. Concomitant Therapy
Concomitant medicat ions will  be summarized for the safet y populati on.
12.2.5.1. Postdiscontinuation Therapy
The numbers and percentages of patients reporting postdiscont inuat ion therapies will be 
provi ded overall, by  type of  therapy  (surgery , radiotherapy , or system ic therapy ), and by  drug 
name.
12.2.6. Treatment Compliance
The number of dose omissio ns, reducti ons, and delays, the number of cycles received, and dose 
intensity will be summarized for all treated patients per treatment arm.
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 89
LY301220712.2.7. Primary Outcome and Methodology
Phase 1b
The Phase 1b is a dose -escalat ion study .The primary  safet y endpo intis DLT. For each dose 
cohort, the numbers o f DLT will be assessed based on DLT -evaluable popul ation.
Phase 2
The primary  efficacy  outcome for the Phase 2 part of the study is OS inthe olaratumab -naïve 
cohort of the ITT populat ion. The final analysis o f OS will be based on the stratified log -rank 
test, stratified by  3 of the 4 randomizat ion factors: number of prior systemic therapies for locally
advanced or metastati c disease (0 versus ≥1), histological tumor ty pe (leiomyosarcom a versus 
non-leiomyosarco ma), and ECOG PS (0 versus 1).
Overall survival curves, the median wit h 95% CI and survival rates at various time points for 
each treatment group will be est imated using the Kapl an-Meier m ethod (Kapl an and Meier 
1958).  The HR will be est imated using a stratified Cox regression model (Cox 1972) , stratified 
the sam e as the log-rank test described above.
12.2.8. Other Analyses of Efficacy
12.2.8.1. Progression -Free Survival
Phase 2
A precise definit ion of events and censoring for PFS will be d efined in the SAP. Progression -free 
survival will be analyzed using the Kaplan -Meier meth od, 
and compared based on a log -rank 
test, stratified by  the same stratificat ion factors used in the analysis o f the primary  endpoint OS.
PFS will be co mpared between the 2treatm ent groups based on l og-rank test, stratified by the 
same stratificat ion factors used in the analysis of the primary  endpoint OS.  PFS survival curves, 
the median with 95% CI ,and survival rates at various time points for each treatment group will 
be est imated using the Kaplan -Meier m ethod (Kaplan and Meier 1958).   The HR will be 
estimated using a stratified Cox regressio n model,stratified b y randomization strata .
12.2.8.2. Additional Efficacy Analyses
Addit ional analyses of the m easures defined in Section 10.1.4 , as well as any other pre -planned 
efficacy  analyses ,will be d efined in the SAP.   In the event that efficacy is observed to be very 
similar between the olaratumab- naïve and o laratum ab-pretreated cohorts, it may  be reasonable to 
concl ude a uniform  efficacy across cohorts; in that case, additional efficacy  analyses m ay be 
perform ed pooling these 2popul ations, in order to obtain pooled estimates of efficacy 
param eters.
12.2.9. Pharmacokinetic andImmunogenicity Analyses
12.2.9.1. Pharmacokinetics
Pharmacokinet ic analyses will be conducted on patien ts who have received at least 1 dose of the 
study  drug and have had sufficient postdose samples collected to allow estimat ionof PK 
param eters .
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 90
LY3012207In the Phase 1b part, PK parameter estimates will be co mputed by standard nonco mpartmental 
methods of analysis for olaratum ab, and for gem citabine, dFdU ,and docetaxel . The m aximum  
concentration (C max), time o f Cmax(tmax), area under the concentration -time curve (AUC), 
half-life ( t1/2), volume of distribution at steady  state (Vss), clearance (CL), and other relevant 
param eters that can be calculated from the data will be reported from the senonco mpart mental 
analyses.
In the Phase 2 part, PK pa rameters for olaratumab (CL, exposure, Vss, and t1/2) and inter -
individual PK variabilit ywill be computed using nonlinear mixed effect modeling implemented 
inNONMEM .  The versio n of any  software used for the analysis will be do cumented and the 
program will meet the Lilly  requi rements of  software validation. Gem citabine, dFdU, and 
docetaxel plasma levels will be reported using descript ive methods.
If warranted by  the data,PK/pharmacodynamic analyses using OS, PFS, and/or other appropriate 
clinical endpo ints willalso be conducted to characterize the exposure- response relationship in 
this study .
12.2.9.2. Immunogenicity
Incidence of treatm ent-emergent (TE) anti-olaratumab ant ibodies and any rela ted assays will be 
tabul ated.  The potential impact of immunogenicit y on ol aratum ab exposure will be evaluated in 
the popul ation PK m odeling exercises where immunogenicit y will be evaluated as a covariate.  
In addit ion, graphical assessments will be conduc ted, as appropri ate, to com pare drug exposure 
between TEADA -negat ive and TEADA -positive patients at correspondent visits, or before and 
after TE-ADA development for patients who developed TE-ADA.  However, for patients who 
test posit ive for ADA, thei r AD A titers will be listed over time and associated PK information 
(for example, plasma concentration) will be listed in subsequent cycles for each patient .
In the event of an IRR, the immunogenicit y and olaratum ab serum  concentrati ons will  be 
tabul ated.
12.2.10. Exploratory Translational Research Analyses
Biomarker assay  resul ts will be summarized and correlated with clinical outcomes.
12.2.11. Analyses of Patient -Reported Outcomes (PROs)
Patient-reported outcomes are measured through the f ollowing:
• mBPI -sf (Brief Pain Inventory  [Short F orm] Modified)
• EORTC QLQ -C30 (The European Organization fo r Research and Treatment of Cancer 
Qualit y of Life Quest ionnaire Core 30)
• EQ 5D -5L (EuroQol 5 -Dimensio n 5-Level)
For each instrument (mBPI -sf, EORTC QLQ -C30, and EQ -5D- 5L), percentage ofcompliance 
and reasons for non -compliance will be summarized by  treatm ent arm  and time point , for the ITT 
popul ation. Percentage ofcompliance will be calcul ated as the number of completed 
assessments divided by  the number of expected assessments .
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 91
LY3012207Data will be separately summarized descript ively. Analyses will be performed separately by 
cohort (ol aratum abnaïve and o laratumab -pretreated). The m ain efficacy measure for the pain 
endpo int will be the time to first worsening of the mBPI -sf “worst pain” score. Time to first 
worsening in pain will be described using the method of Kaplan -Meier and analyses will b e 
made between the 2 arms by  a log-rank test.  “Worsening” will be defined as either a “worst 
pain” increase of ≥2 points post -baseline (Farrar et al. 2001; Rowbotham 2001) or an analgesic 
drug class increase of ≥1 level.  However, other approaches to defi ning clinically  meaningful  
worsening in pain might be considered.  Further details will be provided in the SAP.
Addit ionally , time to sustained worsening of QLQ -C30 scale scores (see Section 10.2) will be 
analyzed using Kaplan -Meier and Cox methods. Further statistical analysis to be performed for 
PROs will be defined and detailed in the SAP.
12.2.12. Safety Analyses
All safet y summaries and analyses will be based upon the Safet y Popul ation as defined in 
Secti on12.2.2 .Analyses will be performed for olaratum ab-naïve and o laratumab -pretreated
cohorts separately as well as pooled between these cohorts .
All safet y analyses are based on the Safet y popul ation unless specified otherwise.
Adverse events (AEs) , including TEAEs, will be summarized by MedDRA System 
Organ Class/preferred term, classified from verbat im terms.  The incidence and 
percentage of patients with at least one occurrence of a preferred term will be included, 
according to the most severe NCI -CTCAE Versi on 4.0 grade.  Causalit y (relat ionship to 
study  drug), acti on taken, and outcom e will be summarized separately .  Durati on of  AEs 
will be determined and included in the list ings.
Study  drug exposure will be summarized for each arm using the fo llowing vari ables: 
number of infusio ns, number of cy cles, durati on of study  treatm ent, cum ulative dose, 
dose intensit y,and rel ative dose intensit y.
Laboratory  resul ts will be classified according to the NCI -CTCAE, Versi on 4.0 criteria. 
Incidence of laboratory  abnorm alities will be summarized.
Hospitalizations due to AEs, transfusio ns, and concomitant drugs will be summarized.
Vital signs
ECG
In the Phase 1b part, DLT
swill be summarized by  cohort in the pati ents who are evaluable for 
DLT assessments and listed by pat ient.  For Phase 1 b and Phase 2, the incidences of TEAEs by 
maximum CTCAE grade that occurred during the study  treatm ent peri od or wi thin 
approximately  30 days after the deci sion is made to discont inue study  treatm entwill be 
summarized .  Addi tionally,for Phase 1b and Phase 2 the following (but not limit ed to) 
safet y-relate d outcom es will be summarized:  study treatment discont inuat ion due to TEAEs, 
deaths during the study  treatment peri od or wi thin 30 days after the deci sion is made to 
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 92
LY3012207discontinue study  treatm ent, treatm ent-emergent SAEs during the study  treatm ent peri od or 
within 30 days after the decisio n is made to discontinue study  treatm ent, hospi talizati ons, and 
transfusio ns during the study  treatm ent peri od or wit hin 30 days after the decisio n is made to 
discontinue study  treatm ent.
12.2.13. Subgroup Analyses
Subgroup analyses of PFS and OS will be performed and will be detailed in the SAP.
12.2.14. Interim Analyses
There will be safet y interim reviews for both Phase 1b and Phase 2 parts.  
Phase 1b
The safet y review for Phase 1b will be conducted by  Lilly  clinical research personnel.   Patient 
safet y will be assessed pri or to dose escal ation to ensure nothing precl udes administrati on of  a 
larger dose to future study  patients. In addit ion to reviewing AEs and laboratory  measurements, 
available PK/ pharmacodynamic profiles of olaratumab will be reviewed per cohort. Based on 
these interim result s, modificat ions (for example , reducti ons in dose i ncrement or changes in 
dosing schedule) to the d ose-escalat ion strategy  or other design elements may be made to ensure 
patient safet y. The study  invest igators and the Lilly CRP /CRS will make the determinat ion 
regarding dose escalat ion based upon their review of the safet y/tolerabilit y data and the PK d ata 
from the previous cohorts.
In addit ion, an interim safet y review will be conducted prior to proceeding to Phase 2 including 
safet y, PK, and pharmacodynamics . All relevant data including data beyond Cycle 1 will be 
reviewed to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of olaratum ab. The decision to proceed to 
Phase 2 will be made fo llowing discussio ns between the invest igators and Lilly clinical research 
personnel.
Phase 2
An independent data monitoring co mmit tee (i DMC) will be established to conduct safet y interim 
reviews .  The m embership, rol es, and responsibilit ies of the iDMC are defined in the iDMC 
Charter (that is, a s eparate i DMC charter document).
There will be no prespecified rules for stopping or modifying the trial due to safet y concerns.  
The i DMC members will review unblinded interim safet y data to determine whether there are 
sufficient safet y concerns to j ustify modifying the study  or the terminat ion of study  treatm ent 
and/or e nrollment.
Study  sites will receive informat ion about interim results ONLY if they need to know for the 
safet y of their pati ents. Unblinding details are provided in the blinding section of the protocol 
(Secti on9.5).
The first iDMC meet ing to review interim data will occur when approximately 60patient s 
(approximately 30patients fro m each arm ) have received atleast 2 cycles of treatment or 
discontinued all study  treatm ent due to any  reasons pri or to Day 8 in Cycle 2.  Pwill be provided 
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 93
LY3012207to the i DMC upon request. Subsequent iDMC meetings will occur approximately every 6 
months thereafter until approximately  1year after com pleting enrollment .  Enrollment and 
treatm ent will continue during the iDMC safety  assessments.  In the event a safet y signal is 
detected, additional meet ings may occur as needed.  Details as to the process and co mmunicat ion 
plan will be provided in the iDMC Charter.
As described in Section 12.1, an interim efficacy analysis is also planned for the Phase 2 part of 
the study .  The iDMC will be responsible for init ial conduct of the inter im efficacy analysis 
according to the specificat ions of the iDMC charter and statistical analysis plan. If there is an 
evidence of interim efficacy to warrant a sponsor internal review of the data, r esults of this 
interim efficacy  analysis may provide informat ion to help inform the init iation of new studies, 
but will not be used to modify the design and conduct of this current trial.
The interim efficacy analysis will occur a fter observing approximate ly40 OS events am ong the 
olaratum ab-pretreat edcohort of the ITT populat ion.  Due to the larger size of the olaratumab -
naïve cohort, it is expected that there will be at least another 40 OS events in the olaratumab -
naïve cohort at the time of this analysis.  The decisio n to perform interim efficacy analyses after 
40 OS events in each cohort was based on both statist ical and qualitat ive considerations.  An 
observat ion ofa very  strong effi cacy in one o f these cohorts , based on 40events, should be 
sufficient to consider further development for that co hort.  For example, an observed OS 
HR<0.60 woul d imply  at least an 80% (Bay esian noninformat ive) probabilit y that the true HR is 
less than 0.80. The evidence will be stronger if both cohorts show similar efficacy , allowing f or 
pooling of the cohorts.   Wit h 80 pooled events , an observed pooled OS HR< 0.67 woul d imply  at 
least a 79% probabilit y that the true pooled HR is less than 0.80.  Other efficacy and safet y 
outcom es will  be evaluated, so these scenarios for the interim OS HR are included here merely 
as a reference , to illustrate the kind of evidence that might lead to the init iation of addit ional 
studi es.  For further details, refer to the study’s Statist ical Analysis Plan (a separate document).
A second interim efficacy  analysis may  optionally be perfor med depending on the expected 
timing of the final analysis and the results of the first interim efficacy analysis.  If a second 
interim efficacy  analysis is performed, it will be conducted applying a no minal alpha level of 
0.00001 to the primary OSanalysi s in o laratumab -naïve pat ients.

It is essent ial that the exact infusio n start and stop times (actual clock readings), as well as 
infusio n parameters (such as, ty pe of  infusio n pump, flow rate se ttings) are recorded.  The exact 
time of co llection of each venous blood sample will be based on the clock used to record 
infusio n times.  It is essent ial that the pharmacokinetic blood samples not be withdrawn fro m the 
same site as the drug infusio n.
For samples co llected within the first 24 hours of study  drug administration , sample collect ion 
times may  vary  ±10% or as specified in the PK sampling schedule.

Treatment of A dvanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma
Overview
Protocol  I5B-MC-JGDL ( b) “A Phase 1b (Open -Label) / Phase 2 (Randomized, Double -Blinded) 
Study  Evaluat ing Gemcitabine and Docetaxel Wit h or Wi thout Ol aratum ab in the Treatm ent of 
Advanced Soft Ti ssue Sarcom a” has been amended.  The new protocol is indicate d by 
amendment ( c) and will be used to conduct the study  in place of any preceding version o f the 
protocol .
The overall changes and rationale for the changes made to this protocol are as fo llows: 
The protocol synopsis, definit ions, Figure JGDL.1 and Sect ions 7.1 and 8.1.2 were modified 
to allow for expansion o f olaratum ab of inclusio n criteria by enrolling 90 additional patients 
that have previously received o laratumab (olaratumab pre -treated) in the Phase 2 part of the 
study .  Secti on 6. 2 is updated with asecondary  objective regarding this pat ient populat ion.  
The r ationale for adding these pati ents i s toevaluate for a signal for strategi c planning of 
future studies including this patient subset (refer to section 5.2 and 5.5.3) .   
The protocol synopsis ,Sections 8.1.8 and 12.2.14, and SAP have been m odified to add an 
interim efficacy  analysis to the Phase 2 part of the study .  This analysis will be triggered after 
40 OS events in the olaratumab pre-treated patients .
In Section 5.4 the number of patients previously treated with olaratumab in clinical trials is 
updated per the most recent IB.   
Inclusio n criterion [9] regarding patients receiving ant i-coagul ant therapy  was updated for 
consistency across clinical trials wit h olaratumab.
Exclusio n criterion [23] was added regarding the olaratum ab pre -treated populat ion for 
safet y.
Criteria to begin subsequent treatment cy cles was cl arified in Section 9.4.1.2.  In this same 
section, clarificat ion was added to allowable treatment delays.
A second dose reduction in gemcitabine and docetaxel will be allowed with this amendment.  
Clarificat ions are also made on dose alterations for toxicit ies of gemcitabine and docetaxel.  
These changes are noted in Tables JGDL.2, JGDL.3, JGDL.4, and JGDL.5 and Section 
9.4.1.2.  In addit ion, in this same sect ion it is clarified that treatment may cont inue with one 
chemotherapy agent if the other is discontinued for toxicit y.
Secti on 9.4.1.2.2 i s updated wi th inform ation on modificat ion of infusio n rates for patients 
with Grade 1 and 2 IRRs.  It is also updated for instructions on olaratumab pre -treated 
patients wi th prior IRR.
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 126
LY3012207Tables JGDL.6 and JGDL.7 are updated for dose modifications of olaratumab for toxicit ies.  
These changes are for consistency across all o laratumab protocols.
In Table JGDL.10 the criteria for QT interval assessment is changed to the Fridericia’s QT 
correcti on formula, for consistency across olaratumab protocols.
Alterations in LDH, gammaglutamyl transferase, and TSH have not been foundto be related 
to olaratum ab.  Accordingly , inAttachm ent 2, these labs are no l onger requi red subsequent to 
baseline evaluat ion.    
PROs are not needed to be done in long -term follow-up period (Visit 802 -8XXX) for Phase 
1b/2.  Accordingly, the Post-Treatment Discont inuation Schedule has been updated. 
Other edits for clarit y andconsistency were made.

2. Synopsis
Study Rationale:
Recent ly, tThe platelet -derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR antibody  olaratumab in 
combinat ion with doxorubi cin dem onstrated a si gnificant improvement in an interim analysis of
overall survival (OS) over d oxorubicin alo ne in patients with advanced so ft tissue sarco ma (STS) 
(Tap et al . 201 65).  Since so me patients may not be appropriate candidates for doxorubicin -based 
chemotherapy, or have received prior anthracycline treatment, exploring olaratumab 
combina tions wi th other chemotherapeut ic agents that are often used in STS treatment is of 
considerable interest.  Study I5B-MC-JGDL is a mult icenter Phase 1b /2 study  ofolaratumab in 
combinat ion with gemci tabine and docetaxel  in patients wi th advanced or metastatic STS, not 
amenable to treatm ent wi th surgi cal resect ion or radi otherapy  with curative intent.   The first part 
(Phase 1b) of the study  will consist of an open -label , single- arm, dose -escalat ion assessment of 
the safet y and tol erabili ty of olaratum abadministered at 15mg/kg(Days 1 and 8) or20mg/kg
(Days 1 and 8 ) with gemci tabine (900 mg/m2[fixed dose rate :  10 m g/m2/minute] Days 1 and 8) 
and docetaxel (75 mg/m2Day 8), of  a 21 -day cycle.   After the dose of olaratumab in co mbinat ion 
with gemci tabine and docetaxel has been determined fro m the analysis of the Phase 1b part, the 
Phase 2
, randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled partof the study  will open to 
enrollment.   
Approximately 166 256 patients will  be randomized in Phase 2 in a 1:1 ratio to Arm  
A (ol aratum ab pl us gemci tabine and docetaxel) or Arm B (placebo plus gemcitabine and 
docetaxel).

I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 128
LY3012207Objectives:   
The primary objective of t he Phase 2 part is to compare the OS in olaratumab -naïve patients with locally advanced 
or metastatic STS treated with olaratumab plus gemcitabine and docetaxel versus placebo plus gemcitabine and 
docetaxel.
A secondary objective of the Phase 2 part is to compare OS in olaratumab -pretreated patients with locally advanced 
or metastatic STS treated with olaratumab plus gemcitabine and docetaxel versus placebo plus gemcitabine and 
docetaxel.
The secondary objectives of the Phase 2 p art are to compare olaratumab plus gemcitabine and docetaxel versus 
placebo plus gemcitabine and docetaxel in both olaratumab - naïve and olaratumab -pretreated groups, for the
follow ing:
The exploratory objective s for both Phase 1b and Phase 2 is are:
Study Design:   This trial is a Phase 1b open -label, dose -escalation part followed by a randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled Phase 2 study of olaratumab plus gemcitabine and docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic STS, not amenable to treatment with surgical resection or radiotherapy with curative intent.  In the Phase 
1b part, 2 cohorts (15 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg) will be studied to determine the olaratumab dose that may be safely 
administered in combination with gemcitabine and docetaxel.   After th e dose of olaratumab in combination with 
gemcitabine and docetaxel has been determined from the Phase 1b part, the Phase 2 part of the study will open to 
enrollment.  In Phase 2, approximately 166 256 patients will be randomized 1:1, in a double -blinded ma nner, to Arm 
A (olaratumab plus gemcitabine and docetaxel) or Arm B (placebo plus gemcitabine and docetaxel).  Randomization 
will be stratified by prior treatment with olaratumab (yes versus no), number of prior systemic therapies for locally 
advanced or m etastatic disease (0 versus ≥1), histological tumor type (leiomyosarcoma versus non -
leiomyosarcoma), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) (0 versus 1), and prior 
pelvic radiation (yes versus no).  Patients will continue treatmen t until there is documented disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, death, or other discontinuation criteria are met.
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion and Exclusions:   Patients at least 16 years of age, ECOG PS 0 to 1, 
gemcitabine ,anddocetaxel , and olaratumab naïve, with histologically confirmed, locally advanced, unresectable or 
metastatic STS, and not amenable to curative treatment with surgery or radiotherapy.  Patients with gastrointestinal 
stromal tumor or Kaposi’s sarcoma will b e excluded.  Patients previously enrolled in Study I5B -MC -JGDJ or any 
other blinded study with olaratumab are not eligible to participate in this trial.   
Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration:
For the Phase 1b and 2 parts :
Gemcitabine is a commercially available product and should be stored, reconstituted, and discarded per 
manufacturer’s instructions .  Gemcitabine isadministered at a dose of 900 mg/m 2over approximately 90 minutes 
(fixed dose rate:  10mg/m2/minute ) on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle.
Docetaxel :is a commercially available product A commercial preparation of docetaxel will be used and should be 
prepared and administered according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  In the Phase 1b and Phase 2 parts,
dDocetaxel will be isadministered at a dose of 75 mg/m2(IV) over approximately 60 minutes on Day 8 of each 21 -
day cycle.
For the Phase 2 part :
Placebo:   injection for IV use, supplied in single -use vials, administered to patients as an IV infusion over 
approximately 60 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of each 21 -day cycle
Planned Duration of Treatment:
Long -term follow -up (postdiscontinuation): Patients that di scontinue study treatment for reasons other than 
progression will be followed every 6 weeks (±7 days) until progr essive disease ( PD), thereafter ever y 2 3months 
(±7days)for the first 2years, then every 6 months (±14 days )until the patient’s de ath or o verall study completion.

LY3012207Statistical Methods:
Statistical:
Efficacy:   Phase 2: The primary objective is to compare OS in olaratumab -naïve patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic STS treated with olaratumab plus gemcitabine and docetaxel versus placebo plus gemcitabine and 
docetaxel.  Investigative sites will screen approximately 200  patients to randomize  166 Patients will be randomized
in1:1 randomizatio nto the two treatment arms. (83 patients in the experimental arm and 83 patients in the control 
arm) .  The intent ion-to-treat (ITT) sample size of 166 for olaratumab -naïve patients (83 in the experimental arm and 
83 in the control arm) was selected assumin g the final analysis of OS will occur after 108 OS events have been 
observed (35% censoring).
The final total of 108OS events in the olaratumab -naïve patients (deaths) provides 80% statistical power for a two -
sided log -rank test at a 0. 20significance lev el (assuming the true OS hazard ratio [ HR] is 0.665).  An OS HR of 
0.665corresponds approximately to an increased median survival from 15 months (estimated from published 
clinical data in various types of patients with locally advanced or metastatic STS) in placebo plus gemcitabine and 
docetaxel to 2 2.5 months for olaratumab plus gemcitabine and docetaxel.
An additional 90 olaratumab -pretreated patients (45 in the experimental arm and 45 in the control arm) will be 
randomized to compare the same regimens as asecondary objective.
The primary efficacy outcome for the Phase 2 part of the study is OS in the olaratumab -naïve cohort of the ITT 
populatio n.  Analysis of OS will be based on the stratified log rank test, stratified by the 3 of the 4 randomization 
strata; that is, number of prior systemic therapies for locally advanced or metastatic disease (0 versus ≥1), 
histological tumor type (leiomyosarcoma versus non -leiomyosarcoma) , and ECOG PS (0 versus 1) .
Overall survival curves, the median w ith 95% confidence interval ( CI)and survival rates at various time points for 
each treatment group will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier method (Kaplan and Meier 1958).  The HR will be 
estimated using a stratified Cox regression model, stratified by the af orementioned 3 randomization strata. All ITT 
populatio n will be included in the analysis of this endpoint.   There is no interim efficacy analysis planned for the 
Phase 2 part.   The same OS analyses will also be performed separately for the olaratumab -pret reated cohort of the 
ITT population.
Interim analysis
There will be safety interim reviews for both Phase 1b and Phase 2 parts.  In addition, an interim efficacy analysis is 
planned for the Phase 2 part of the study.
The safety review for Phase 1b will be conducted by Lilly clinical research personnel.  The study investigators and 
the Lilly clinical research physician/clinical research scientist (CRP/CRS) will make the determination regarding 
dose escalation based upon their review of the safety/tolerabili ty data and the PK data from the previous cohorts. In 
addition, an interim safety review will be conducted prior to proceeding to Phase 2 including safety and PK .
An independent data monitoring committee (iDMC) will be established to conduct Phase 2 safe ty interim reviews.  
The first iDMC meeting to review interim data will occur when approximately 60 patients (approximately 30 
patients from each arm) have received at least 2 cycles of treatment or discontinued all study treatment due to any 
reasons prior to Day 8 in Cycle 2.  Subsequent iDMC meetings will occur regularly thereafter .
An interim efficacy analysis is planned for the Phase 2 part of the study.  After observing 40 OS events among the 
olaratumab -pretreated cohort of the ITT population, interim analy sis will occur.  Any  positive interim efficacy 
results may be used for planning of additional separate clinical studies, but will not be used to modify the design and 
conduct of this current trial.

5.2 Olaratumab Background
In norm al mesenchymal bi ology,PDGF/PDGFR signaling has a significant role in mesenchymal 
stem cell different iation, growth of mesenchymal cells, angiogenesis, and wound healing 
(Andrae et al. 2008; Ng et al. 2008; Li et al. 2014).   
PDGF/PDGFRα signaling has been 
implicated in the pathogenesis o f multiple cancers, including osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, 
prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and others.  In malignant disease, the 
PDGF/PDGFRα axis prom otes tumor growth and prol iferat ion through both autocrine and 
paracrine mechanisms.   PDGFRα is expressed on stromal cells, as well as the cancer cells 
themselves, wi thin certain tum ors.  Furthermore, studies have shown that PDGF/PDGFRα 
signaling affects tumor vasculature through p aracrine mediat ion of vascular endothelial growth 
factor production (Shah et al. 2010).   Addit ional inform ation is available in the olaratumab 
investigator’s brochure (IB).
5.3 Study Rationale 
The posi tive efficacy  resul ts seen wi th olaratum ab in combinat ion with doxorubi cin in 
Study JGDG (Tap et al . 201 65)warrant further study  of olaratumab with gemci tabine plus 
docetaxel, another active treatment regimen, for patients with advanced or metastatic STS.
Study  I5B-MC-JGDL will eval uate the efficacy  and safet y of olaratum ab, in combinat ion with 
docetaxel and gemcitabine (fixed dose rate:  10 m g/m2/minute) in pat ients with locally advanced 
or metastati cSTS.  The study  will allow this evaluati on in both ol aratum ab-naïve and 
olaratum ab-pretreated populat ions.  Ol aratumab -naïve pat ients are those who may be ineligible 
for treatm ent wi th doxorubi cin or for whom gemcitabine/docetaxel is more appropriate as init ial 
chemotherapy than doxorubicin.
5.4 Rationale for Selection of Dose
Olaratumab:
The current dose -selection strategy  for this study  is based on the integrated safet y, efficacy , and 
pharmacokinet ics (PK)data for olaratumab across previous Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies.   In 
2Phase 1 d ose-escalation trials ( Studies I5B-IE-JGDCand I5B-IE-JGDF ) and in the 2 Phase 2 
monotherapy  studi es (Studi es I5B-IE-JGDE and I5B-IE-JGDH ), single -agent ol aratum ab has 
consistent ly been well tol erated ,with no dose-limiting toxicit ies (DLTs )observed up to a dose of 
20 m g/kg administered every  2weeks and up to a dose of 15 mg/kg administered o nDays1 and 
8 of a 21- day cycle.   When used in co mbinat ion with liposomal doxorubicin in Study  I5B-IE-
JGDA (olaratum ab dose of 20 mg/kg every  2 weeks), and wi th paclitaxel plus carbopl atin in 
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 131
LY3012207Study  I5B-IE-JGDB (olaratumab dose of 15 mg/kg Day s1 and 8 every  3 weeks), a higher rate of 
toxicities such as neutropenia and infect ions was observed versus the comparator agents . As of 
30June 20152016, 691 patients have been enro lled into the olaratumab clinical program and 497
790 patients have received olaratumab through Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 studies .  In Study  
JGDG , although there was a higher incidence of some known doxorubicin toxicit ies such as 
mucosit is, nausea/vomit ing, and diarrhea, these were monitorable, predominantly Grade ≤2, and 
did not l ead to a higher incidence of treatment discontinuat ion.  Overal l, these toxicit ies are 
consistent with the toxicit y profile of the combinatio n agents used and are considered 
monitorable and acceptable for the patient populat ions studied.
Gemcitabine and Docetaxel:
Fixed -dose rate gemcitabine (900 mg/m2over 90 minutes [ fixed dose rate of 10 m g/m2/min], 
Days 1 and 8, plus docetaxel 100 mg/m2on d D ay eight8) yielded high object ive response rates 
among pat ients with advanced l eiomyosarcoma in both the second- line, and first -line setting 
(Hensley et al. 2008a, 2008b).  However, to increase the tolerabilit y of this chemotherapy  
regimen a docetaxel dose of 75 mg/m2, which is lower than 100 mg/m2,has been selected for this 
study .  Som e of the toxi city seen in previ ous clinical  experience (fat igue, asthenia, a nd fluid 
retention) was m ore ty pical of the docetaxel counterpart, suggesting that this docetaxel dose 
modificati on coul d improve the tol erabili ty of this regimen.  Thi s is consistent with the 
75-mg/m2 docetaxel  dose chosen in recent Phase 3 GeDDiS trial ( Seddon et al. 2015b).  
Therefore, t his Phase 1b/2 trial invest igates the efficacy  and safet y of olaratumab in co mbination 
with gemci
tabine (900 m g/m2over 90 minutes [ fixed -dose rate of 10 m g/m2/min]) and docetaxel  
(75mg/m2)for the treatm ent of locally advanced or m etastati c STS that is not amenable to 
treatm ent wi th surgical  resecti on or radi otherapy  with curative intent.
5.5.3 Rationale for Amendment (c)
As doxorubi cin in co mbination wit h olaratum ab becom es more comm on in clinical pract ice for 
advanced or metastatic STS, addit ional evaluation in o laratumab -pretreated patients is warranted 
in order to understand the effect of olaratumab as continuat ion therapy  with regimens such as 
gemcitabine/docetaxel  that are custom arily administered after max imal doxorubicin dosing.  
Addit ionally , the concept of continuing a bio logic treatm ent wi th a change in chemotherapy  
backbone is supported by  evidence of on -going treatment effect of trastuzumab and bevacizumab 
in multiple lines of therapy  in HER2 posi tivebreast cancer and metastatic colon cancer, 
respectively .  Furtherm ore, resistance to antibody  therapy in cancer is via separate mechanisms
than chemotherapy  resistance, supporting the theory  that continued benefit from olaratumab is 
possible after progres sive disease on other chemotherapy regimens.  Finally, due to potential 
effect on PDGFRα expressing stromal cells, continued olaratumab exposure may lead to 
favorable changes in the tumor microenvironment irrespect ive of change in chemotherapy 
regimen.  Th e evaluat ion of olaratumab in co mbination with gemcitabine and docetaxel in 
olaratum ab pre -treated patients will be a secondary object ive. Ninet y patients will be added as 
this is deemed to be an adequate number to observe a signal for strategic planning o f future 
studi es.  The protocol  amendment also adds an interim efficacy  analysis o f all study  outcom es to 
allow for timely Phase 3 development strategies.

8.1 Summary of Study Design
Study  I5B-MC-JGDL is a mult icenter Phase 1b /2 study  ofolaratum ab in co mbinat ion wi th 
gemcitabine and docetaxel  in pat ients with locally advanced or metastatic STS, not amenable to 
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 134
LY3012207treatm ent wi th surgical  resecti on or ra diotherapy  with curative intent .  The first part (Phase 1b) 
of the study  will consist of an open -label, single -arm, dose-escalat ion assessment of the safet y 
and tol erabilit y of olaratumab administered at 15 mg/kg(Days 1 and 8 ) or20mg/kg (Days 1 and 
8) with gemci tabine (900 m g/m2[fixed dose rate :  10 m g/m2/minute],Days1and 8 ) and 
docetaxel (75 mg/ m2, Day8),on a 21 -day cycle (Figure JGDL.1 ).  After the dose of olaratumab 
in combinat ion with gem citabine and docetaxel  has been determined from the analysis o f the 
Phase 1b part, the Phase 2, randomized, double -blinded , placebo -controlled part of the study will 
open to enrollment.  Patients will be rando mized in a 1 :1 ratio in a double -blinded manner to 
Arm A (ol aratum ab plus gemci tabine and docetaxel) or Arm B (placebo plus gemcitabine and 
docetaxel).

*  Based on the outcome of the Phase 1b part, the dose selected for the Phase 2 part of 
JGDL will be either 15 mg/kg or20 mg/kg . Depending on the safety and 
pharmacokinetic profile of these dose levels, it is possible that an intermediate dosing 
regimen of 2loading doses of 20 mg/kg during Cycle 1followed by 15 mg/kg in every 
subsequent cycle could be utilized in Phase 2, as is being studied in the Phase 3 Study 
JGDJ.
Figure JGDL.1. Illustration of study design.
8.1.1 Phase 1b Dose Escalation 
The Phase 1b part is a single -arm dose escalat ion to determine the recommended dose of 
olaratum ab for the Phase 2 part that may be safely  administered in combinat ion with gemci tabine 
(900 m g/m2) and docetaxel  (75 m g/m2) inpatients wi th locally advanced or m etastati c STS .  This 
dose escalat ion has a starting o laratumab dose of 15 mg/kg and the highest ol aratum ab dose of 
20mg/kg. No intrapatient dose escalat ion is permitted. Patients in any cohort who do not 
complete Cycle 1 treatm ent for reasons other than a DLT will be replaced.
8.1.2 Phase 2
After the dose of olaratumab in co mbination wit h gemcitabine and docetaxel has been 
determined fro m the Phase 1b part, the Phase 2 randomized, double -blinded partof the study  will 
open to enrollment.  In the Phase 2 part, approximately 166 256 patients wi ll be rando mized 
1:1to receive eit her olaratum abplus gemcitabine and docetaxel (Arm  A) or pl acebo pl us 
gemcitabine and docetaxel  (Arm  B).  Out of the 256 patients, 166 patients will be olaratumab 
naïve and 90 patients will be o laratumab pretreated.   Rand omization will be stratified by prior 
treatm ent wi th olaratumab (y es versus no), number of prior systemic therapies for locally  
advanced or metastati c disease (0 versus ≥1), histological tumor ty pe (leiomyosarcom a versus 
non-leiomyosarco ma), ECOG performan ce status ( PS)(0 versus 1) ,and prior pelvic radiati on 
(yes versus no).
8.1.3 Definitions of Study Periods
Follow -up for survival -Patients will be fo llowed every 
2 3months (±7 days) for the first 2 years, then every  6 months 
(±14 day s) unt il the patient’s death or overall study  com pletion.
8.1.4 Baseline and Study Treatment Period Assessments
Phase 2 :
Patients in the invest igational Arm A will receive:
Olaratum ab (15 or 20 m g/kg IV infusio n)on Days 1 and 8 of every  21-day cycle over 
60 minutes, fo llowed by  a 1-hour observat ion period for the first 2 cycles. If there is 
no evidence of an IRR after the D ay1 and D ay8 infusio ns in the first 2 cycles, no 
observat ion peri od is requi red for subsequent treatment cy cles.  In the event that a 
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 136
LY3012207Grade 1 or 2 IRR occurs after Cy cle 2, the 1 -hour observat ion peri od will  be 
reinst ituted for a minimum of 2 cycles.  The reinst ituted observat ion peri od m ay be 
suspended after 2 cy cles if the patient shows no further signs or symptoms of an IRR.   
The dose of olaratumab will be determined from the Phase 1b part of the study .  
Depending on the safet y and PK profile of the Phase 1b dose levels, it is possible that 
an intermediate dosing regimen of 2 loading doses of 20 mg/kg during Cycle 1 
followed by 15 mg/kg in every subsequent cycle could be utilized in Phase 2, as is 
being studied in the Phase 3 Study  JGDJ.
8.1.5 Postdiscontinuation Follow -Up Period A ssessments
For pati ents that discont inue study  treatm ent after obj ectively measured PD, the fo llowing 
inform ation will be co llected every 2 3months (±7 day s) for the first 2 years, then every  6 
months (±14 days) unt il the pat ient’s death, or overall study  com pletion:
8.1.6 Study Completion and End of Trial
Phase 1b
The Phase 1b partof the study  will be considered complete following determinat ion of the 
recommended Phase 2 dose of olaratumab that may be safely administered in combinat ion with 
gemcitabine plus docetaxel  
to patients with locally advanced or metastatic STS (Figure JGDL.2 ).
Phase 2
This study  will be considered com plete (that i s, the sci entific evaluation will be co mplete [study
completion]) fo llowing final analysis o fthe OS endpoint ( at least 108 OS events in the 
olaratum ab-naïve cohort )hasbeen performed and evaluated, as determined by Lilly  
(Figure JGDL.3 ).  Invest igators will continue to follow the study schedule for all patients until 
notified by Lilly  that study  com pletion has occurred .
Abbreviations:  iDMC = independent Data Monitoring Committee; OS = overall

8.1.9 Study Duration
From  first pati ent visi t in the Phase 1b part to last patient visit in the Phase 2 part, the estimated 
study  durati on is 44 47 months.
Table JGDL.1 Treatment Regimens/Dosing Schedule
aAdminister olaratumab as an infusion over 60 minutes (± 5 minutes) , not to exceed 25 mg/min . Note exceptions 
when the infusion times of olaratumab are longer than 60 minutes (Section 9.4.1.2.2.1 9.2.1 ). Premedicate all 
patients with the following medications (or equivalent) intravenously : a histamine H1 antagonist ( for example , 
diphenhydramine) and dexamethasone 30 to 60 minutes prior to the olaratumab doses on Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 
1.  For subsequent cycles, premedicate all patients with a histamine H1 antagonist ( for example , 
diphenhydramine) intravenously 30 to 60 minutes prior to each dose of olaratumab.  See also Section 9.2.1 for 
more details.   Additional premedication may be provided at the investigator’s discretion.  Premedication must be
provided in the setting of a prior Grade 1-2 olaratumab/placebo IRR, as detailed in Section 9.4.1.2.2.1 .  All 
premedication administered must be adequately documented in the eCRF.
Treatment Regimens/Dosing Schedule (concluded)
dAdminister docetaxel as an infusion over 60 minutes (± 5 minutes) after gemcitabine .  Premedica tion for 
docetaxel may be administered according to institutional guidelines and/or clinical practice .  All premedication 
administered must be adequately documented in the eCRF .  Docetaxel premedication , if needed, must not be 
administered before the end o f olaratumab/placebo infusion or before completion of the observation period (if 
applicable).  Exception is given to dexamethasone premedication that is started 1 day prior to docetaxel per 
package insert.
9.2.1 Olaratumab/Placebo
CAUTION:   Infusion -related reacti ons may  occur during or following olaratumab/placebo 
administration (see Section 9.4.1.2.2.1 for a definit ion of Grade 3 and 4 IRRs).  During the 
administration of olaratumab/placebo, patients should be in an area with resu scitation equi pment 
and treatments necessary  for advanced life support and cardiopulmo nary resusci tation (CPR), 
such as bronchodilators, vasopressor agents (for example, epinephrine), oxy gen, gl ucocorti coids, 
antihistamines, IV fluids, and so forth.  A 1-h our observat ion peri od is requi red after the 
administration of the first and second cy cles of olaratum ab/placebo.  If there is no evidence of an 
IRR during the init ial 2 cycles of olaratum ab/placebo, then no observation period is required for 
subsequent tr eatment cy cles.  In the event that a Grade 1 or 2 IRR occurs after Cy cle 2, the 1 -
hour observation period will be reinst ituted for a minimum o f 2 cycles.  The reinst ituted 
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 138
LY3012207observat ion peri od m ay be suspended after 2 cy cles if the pat ient shows no further s igns or 
symptoms of an IRR.   See Section 9.4.1.2.2.1 for management of infusio n rate wi th Grade s1 and 
2 IRRs.
9.3 Method of Assignment to Treatment
Phase 2:
The I WRS will assign patients to treatment arms according to a stratified method of 
randomizat ion (that is, independent randomizat ion within each of 16stratuam or cells ), defined 
by the fo llowing 4 5prognosti c factors:
Prior treatm ent wi th olaratumab (y es versus no)
Number of prior systemic therapies for locally advanced/metastatic disease (0 versus ≥1)
9.4.1.2 Dose Delays, Modifications, and Discontinuations
To begin dosing at each cy cle (Day  1), the fo llowing cri teria must be f ulfilled:
ANC ≥1.5 × 103cells/µL ( ≥1500 cells/µL; ≥1.5 × 109/L), with no G -CSF in the prior 48 
hours
Platelets ≥100 × 103cells/µL ( ≥100,000 cells/µL; ≥100 × 109cells/L) , with no platelet 
transfusio n in the prior 72 hours
Delays:
Treatment may be delayed for up to 14days to allo w a patient sufficient time for recovery  from 
study  drug -related toxici tyor non -study -drug-related events at the investigator’s discret ion (for 
example, an autom obile accident).
Dose Modificat ions:
Any pat ient who requires a dose reduction for drug -related toxicit y will cont inue to receive the 
reduced dose for the remainder of the study , except in the situat ion described in Table JGDL.2 , 
footnote b .  For gem citabine or docetaxel , any pat ient who has had 1 2 dose reductions and who 
experiences a toxicit y that woul d cause a thirdsecond dose reducti on m ust be discont inued from 
study  treatm ent.  For ol aratum ab, a ny pat ient who has had 2dose reductions and who 
experiences a toxicit y that woul d cause a thirddose reducti on m ust be discont inued fro m study  
treatm ent.

a Patients with a prior history of pelvic radiation should receive prophylactic G -CSF in all cycles.  G -CSF use is recommended per the guidelines outlined in 
Section 9.1.1.4 .  Patients with a prior history of pelvic radiation who require chemotherapy dose reduction despite prophylactic G -CSF are not required to 
have prophylactic G -CSF in s ubsequent cycles if per investigator assessment such chemotherapy dose reductions adequately address the risk of further 
myelosuppression.
bIf there has been a previous 1 dose reduction for drug -related toxicity, the dose of gemcitabine is675mg/m2and the dose of docetaxel is 60mg/m2. If there 
have been 2dose reductions for drug -related toxicity, the dose of gemcitabine is 500 mg/m2and the dose of docetaxel is 45 mg/m2.  A Day 8 dose reduction 
of gemcitabine or docetaxel because of Day 8 blood count parameters does not need to be continued on Day 1 of the subsequent cycle .
cIf there has already been 1dose reduction for drug -related toxicity, the dose of gemcitabine is 500mg/m2and the dose of docetaxel is 45mg/m2.  A Day 8 
dose reduction of gemcitabine or docetaxel because of Day 8 blood count parameters does not need to be continued on Day 1 of the subsequent cycle.
cdAfter omission of gemcitabine and docetaxel on D ay 8 due to ANC <500 cells/ µLand/or platelet count of < 75,000 cells/ µL, reduce dose of gemcitabine to 
the next appropriate dose level per Table Table JGDL .3JGDL 3 675 mg/m2and docetaxel to 60 mg/m2for subsequent cycles.

LY3012207Discontinuations:
In the event of permanent discontinuation of o laratumab/placebo therapy  due to an 
olaratum ab/placebo -related toxi city, pati ents m ay continue on gem citabine and docetaxel  
treatm ent per protocol .  If either gemcitabine or docetaxel are permanently discont inued due to 
toxicity, the pati ent shoul d discont inue act ive treatment with the gemcitabine/docetaxel 
combinat ion if it is unclear which individual agent is the cause o f thetoxicit y.  If toxici ty is 
clearly  related to 1agent or the other, for example neuropathy  due to docetaxel, only  that agent 
shoul d be discont inued.   However, Tthe patient may continue treatment with o laratumab/placebo
alone, at the discret ion of the inves tigator , if gemcitabine and/or docetaxel are permanent ly 
discontinued.  Any changes in treatments being added to or removed fro m patient care will be 
recorded on the eCRF.

LY3012207First occurrence of febrile neutropenia and/or 
documented Grade 4 neutropenia persisting ≥ 7 daysReduce gemcitabine to 675 mg/m2and docetaxel to 
60mg/m2.  Prophylactic G -CSF recommended in 
subsequent cycles.  If patient experiences of febrile
neutropenia and/or documented Grade 4 neutropenia in a 
subsequent cycle despite dose reduction and prophylactic 
G-CSF, a second dose reduction (to gemcitabine 
500mg/m2and docetaxel 45 mg/m2) is allowed.  If 
febrile neutropenia or documented Grade 4 neutropenia 
occur in further cycles, the patient should be 
disco ntinued from the gemcitabine and docetaxel 
combinatio n.
Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelet count 25,000/µL
to ˂50,000 /µL) associated with clinically significant
bleeding Reduce gemcitabine to 675 mg/m2and docetaxel to 
60mg/m2for all subsequent cycles.  If the event recurs in 
a subsequent cycle despite dose reduction, a second dose 
reductio n (to gemcitabine 500 mg/m2and docetaxel 
45mg/m2) is allowed.  If Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with 
clinically significant bleeding o ccurs in further cycles, 
the patient should be discontinued from the gemcitabine 
and docetaxel combination.
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (pl atelet count 
<25,000/µ L)Reduce gemcitabine to 675 mg/m2and docetaxel to

9.4.1.2.2.1 Infusion -Related Reactions
For pati ents who experience a Grade 1 or 2 IRR, the infusio n should be stopped and the patient 
treated with the fo llowing (or equivalent) medicat ions intravenously : a histamine H1 antagonist 
(for example ,diphenhydramine hydrochloride), glucocortico id (for example ,dexamethasone), 
acetaminophen, and oxy gen (as indicated), according to standard medical pract ices.  After 
recovery , the infusio n rate shoul d be decreased 50% for the duration of the infusio n. 
Forp Patients who have experienced a prior Grade 1 or 2 IRR to olaratum ab (or placebo) , 
patients shoul d be prem edicated wi th the fo llowing (or equivalent) medicat ions:  a histamine H1 
antagonist ( for example , diphenhydr amine) intravenously and gl ucocorti coid (for example , 
dexamethasone) intravenously , acetaminophen, and any  other m edicat ionsas appropri ate for
prophylaxis of IRR , approximately  30to 60 minutes prior to all subsequent olaratumab/placebo 
infusio ns.  In add ition, the 1hour post infusio n observat ion peri od shoul d be reinstated as per 
Section 9.2.1.  If subsequent infusio ns are then tolerated with the use of premedicat ions as above 
and a 50% decrease in infusio n rate, the infusio n rate m ay be increased to a r ate deemed

Grade 2 At the investigator’s discretion, the pat ient may  continue to receive olaratumab/placebo per 
protocol, provided that the event does not pose a serious health risk or is easily treated.
Grade 3 For a Grade 3 toxicity not adequately controlled with appropriate supportive care, the dose 
must be withheld until organ toxicity is ≤ Grade 1 or has returned to pretreatment baseline; 
then treatment may resume at a reduced dose of 12 mg/kg for the 15 -mg/k g cohort (Phase 1b)
dose level and reduced dose of 15 -mg/kg for the 20-mg/kg cohortdose level .  If toxicity 
recurs after therapy resumes, a second dose reduction ( second dose reduction of 10 mg/kg for 
the 15 mg/kg cohort dose level and12 mg/kg for the 20 -mg/kg dose level cohort) )is 
permitted.
   Grade 4 The dose must be withheld until dose toxicity is ≤ Grade 1 or has returned to baseline.  
Permanent discontinuation should be considered for any patient exper iencing Grade 4 
nonhematologic toxicity assessed as related to olaratumab/placebo. However, if resumption 
of dosing is deemed appropriate by the investigator, treatment may resume only after 
consultation with the Lilly study physician, with the dose reduc ed to 10 mg/kg for the 15 -
mg/kg dose level cohort ; dose reduced to 15 mg/kg for the 20 -mg/kg cohort dose level .  If 
Grade 4 toxicity recurs after therapy resumes, all study treatment will be discontinued.
9.5 Blinding
Phase 2:
This is thedoubl e-blind edpart of the study .
During enro llment and prior to the interim efficacy analysis To preserve the blinding of the study , 
only a minimum number of Lilly  personnel  will see the randomizat ion table and treatment 
assignments before the study  is com plete.   Individuals (IWRS, clinical trials materials 
management, Global Pat ient Safet y, and data management personnel) validat ing the database 
willnot have access to aggregate summary  reports or stati stics.  PK and/or immunogenicit ydata 
that coul d unblind the study  will not be reported to invest igative sites or other blinded personnel 
until the study has been unblinded.
Upon final analyses of the overall study  completion (see Secti on 8.1.6 ), invest igators may 
unblind pati ents to study  treatm ent assignment.
10.1.2 Radiographic A ssessments during the Study Period 
Postdiscontinuation Follow Up
For those patients who discont inue study  treatm ent wi thout obj ectively measured PD, the 
investigat ive sites will cont inue to monitor patients and peri odically  evaluate tum or response 
every 6 weeks (±7 days) as calculated from enrollment (Phase 1b) or randomizat ion (Phase 2) by  
the sam emethod used at baseline and throughout the study  until the pati ent has object ive disease 
progression, or until the final analysis of OS.  After the patient has objective disease progression, 
radiologic tests are no longer required and the patient will shoul dbe followed up approximately  
every 2 3months (±7 day s) for the fi rst 2 years, then every  6 months (±14 days) unt il the 
patient’s death or overall study  com pletion.
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 145
LY301220710.2 Patient -Reported Outcomes/Resource Utilization
Patient reported pain will be assessed using the mBPI -sf (Cleeland et al . 1991).  Health -related 
qualit y of lifewill be assessed with the EORTC QLQ- C30 (Aaronson et al. 1993).  Health status 
will be assessed using the EQ -5D- 5L (Janssen et al. 2008).  The PRO measures will be co llected 
on Day  1 of every  cycle and at the 30 -day short term fo llow-up visit.  For th ose pati ents who 
discontinued for reasons other than PD, a full due diligence will be taken to collect PRO 
measures during long- term follow-up, every  6 weeks (±7 day s) unt il PD.

12.1 Determination of Sample Size
Phase 1b
The primary  object ive of the Phase 1b partis to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose of 
olaratum ab that m ay be safely administered in combinat ionwith gemci tabine (900 m g/m2)and 
docetaxel (75 m g/ m2)to pati ents wi th locally advanced or metastati c STS .  Section 8.1.1
outlines the study  design for the Phase 1b portion.  Approximately , a total  of 45patients will  
ensure that at l east 1 5patients will be treated at the 15-mg/kg and 30 patients at the 20 -mg/kg 
cohort (see also Section 8.1.1. ).
Phase 2
The primary  object ive of the Phase 2 partis to compare olaratumab plus gemci tabine and 
docetaxel (experimental arm) versus placebo plus gemci tabine/ docetaxel  (control  arm) in term s 
of OS
,in patients with locally  advanced or metastatic STS ,who have not previously been treated 
with olaratum ab (the “o laratumab -naïve” cohort).
The Phase 2 part of thestudy will screen approximately 200 olaratum ab-naïve patients to 
rando mize 166 olaratum ab-naïve patients in 1:1 randomizat ion (83 pati ents in the experimental 
arm and 83 patients in the control arm).  The primary  ITT sample size of 166 was selected 
assuming the final analysis of OS will occur when at least 1 08OS events in rando mized 
olaratum ab-naïve patients have been observed (35% censoring).
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 146
LY3012207The final total of 1 08OS events (deaths) in olaratumab -naïve patients provides 80% statist ical 
power for a two- sided log-rank test at a 0. 20significance level (assuming the true OS HR is 
0.665).  An OS HR of 0.6 65corresponds approximately to an increased median survival fro m 15 
months (est imated fro m published clinical data in various t ypes of pat ients wi th advanced or 
metastati c STS) in placebo pl us gemcitabine and docetaxel to 22.5 months for olaratum ab plus 
gemcitabine and docetaxel .
Akey secondary  objective of the study  will be to com pare OS between the experimental arm and 
the control arm in pat ients with locally  advanced or m etastati c STS, who have previously  been 
treated with o laratumab (the “o laratumab -pretreated” cohort).  The Ph ase 2 part of the study  will 
screen approximately 114 olaratum ab-pretreated patients to randomize 90 olaratumab -pretreated 
patients in 1:1 randomizat ion.
The sample size of 90 patients in the secondary cohort of “o laratumab -pretreated” patients was 
selecte d based on both statist ical and quali tative considerati ons.  See Secti on 12.2.14 for further 
discussio n of the rationale.
There is nowill be aninterim efficacy analysis planned for the Phase 2 partof the study .All 
available data on patient c haracteri stics, efficacy , and safet y outcom es will be included for 
consideration as part of the interim efficacy analysis.  The primary  efficacy  hypothesis will be 
tested at the interim efficacy analysis using a no minal alpha level o f 0.00001.  The final a nalysis 
of the primary  efficacy hypothesis will therefore be adjusted and tested at a nominal alpha level 
of 0.19999.
See Secti on 12.2.14 and the study’s Statist ical Analysis Plan (a separate document) for further 
details regarding the interim efficacy ana lysis.
12.2.1 General Considerations
Unless specifically described otherwise, all baseline, efficacy, safety , and heal th outcom es 
analyses will be performed separately for the olaratumab- naïve and olaratumab -pretreated 
cohorts.
12.2.2 Analysis Populations
Phase 2
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT)population:   will include sall rando mized patients .  InThe ITT 
analysis of efficacy  data will  consider popul ation,allocat ion of patients will be allocated to 
treatm ent groups as randomized, and not by  actual  treatm ent received. This populat ion will  
be used for baseline, efficacy, and healt h outcom e analyses.
A key  subset of the ITT popul ation is the LMS populat ion (rando mized patients with LMS),  
Unless oth erwise indicated, all efficacy analyses will be performed for both the full ITT 
popul ation and the LMS populat ion.
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 147
LY301220712.2.7 Primary Outcome and Methodology 
Phase 2
The primary  efficacy  outcome for the Phase 2 part of the study is OS in the olaratumab -naïve 
cohort of the ITT populat ion.  The final analysis o f OS will be based on the stratified log -rank 
test, stratified by  3 of the 4 randomizat ion factors: number of prior sy stemic therapies for locally
advanced or metastati c disease (0 versus ≥1), histological tumor ty pe (leiomyosarcom a versus 
non-leiomyosarco ma), and ECOG PS (0 versus 1).  
Overall survival curves, the median wit h 95% CI and survival rates at various time points for 
each treatment group will be est imated using the Kapl an-Meier m ethod (Kapl an and Meier 
1958).  The HR will be est imated using a stratified Cox regression model (Cox 1972) , stratified 
the sam e as the l og-rank test described above.   by the 3rando mizat ion strata (number of prior 
systemic therapies for advanced or metastatic disease [0 versus ≥1], histol ogical tum or type 
[leiomyosarco ma versus non -leiomyosarcoma], and ECOG PS [0 versus 1]).  All ITT populat ion 
will be included in the analysis o f this endpo int.
12.2.8.2 Additional Efficacy A nalyses
Addit ional analyses of the measures defined in Secti on 10.1.4 , as well as any other pre -planned 
efficacy  analyses, will be defined in the SAP.  In the event that efficacy is observed to be very 
similar between the olaratumab- naïve and o laratumab -pretreated cohorts, it may  be reasonable to 
concl ude a uniform  efficacy across cohorts; in that case, additional ef ficacy  analyses m ay be 
perform ed pooling these 2popul ations, in order to obtain pooled estimates of efficacy 
param eters.
12.2.11 Analyses of Patient -Reported Outcomes (PROs)
Data will be separately summarized descript ively. Analyses will be performed sep arately  by 
cohort (ol aratum ab naïve and o laratumab -pretreated). The m ain efficacy measure for the pain 
endpo int will be the time to first worsening of the mBPI -sf “worst pain” score. Time to first 
worsening in pain will be described using the method of K aplan -Meier and analyses will be 
made between the 2 arms by  a log-rank test.  “Worsening” will be defined as either a “worst 
pain” increase of ≥2 points post -baseline (Farrar et al. 2001; Rowbotham 2001) or an analgesic 
drug class increase of ≥1 level.  However, other approaches to defining clinically  meaningful  
worsening in pain might be considered.  Further details will be provided in the SAP.
12.2.12 Safety A nalyses
All safet y summaries and analyses will be based upon the Safet y Popul ation as defined in 
Secti on12.2.2 . Analyses will be performed for olaratumab -naïve and o laratumab -pretreated 
cohorts separately as well as pooled between these cohorts.
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 148
LY301220712.2.14 Interim Analysis
There will be a safet y interim analysis reviews for both Phas e 1b and Phase 2 parts.  
Phase 2
Only the iDMC is authorized to evaluate unblinded safet y analyses .  Study  sites will  receive 
inform ation about interim results ONLY if they need to know for the safet y of their pati ents. 
Unblinding det ails are provided in the blinding section of the protocol (Section 9.5).
The i DMC safet y reviews will be performed for all randomized patients .The first iDMC 
meet ing to review interim data will occur when approximately  60 pati ents (approximately  
30patients fro m each arm ) have received at l east 2 cy cles o f treatm ent or discont inued all study 
treatm ent due to any  reasons pri or to Day 8 in Cycle 2.  An interim PK analyses will acco mpany 
the iDMC safet y review and the PK analyses will be perform ed by a Lilly  PK scient ist 
independent fro m the study  team .  These data will be provided to the iDMC up on request.  
Subsequent iDMC meetings will occur approximately every  6 months thereafter until 
approximately  1year after complet ing enrollment .  Enrollment and treatment will cont inue 
during the iDMC safet y assessments.  In the event a safet y signal is detected, addit ional meetings 
may occur as needed.  Details as to the process and communication plan will be provided in the 
iDMC Charter.
As described in Secti on 12.1, an interim efficacy analysis is also planned for the Phase 2 part of
the study .  The i DMC will be responsible for init ial conduct of the interim efficacy  analysis 
according to the specificat ions of the iDMC charter and statistical analysis plan.  If there is an 
evidence of interim efficacy to warrant a sponsor internal rev iew of the data, resul ts of this 
interim efficacy  analysis may provide informat ion to help inform the init iation of new studies, 
but will not be used to modify  the design and conduct of this current trial.
The interim efficacy analysis will occur after obs erving approximately 40 OS events among the 
olaratum ab-pretreated cohort of the ITT populat ion.  Due to the larger size of the olaratumab -
naïve cohort, it is expected that there will be at least another 40 OS events in the olaratumab -
naïve cohort at the ti me of this analysis.  The decisio n to perform interim efficacy analyses after 
40 OS events in each cohort was based on both statist ical and qualitat ive considerations.  An 
observat ion of a very  strong efficacy in one of these cohorts, based on 40 events, s hould be 
sufficient to consider further development for that cohort.  For example, an observed OS 
HR<0.60 would imply  at least an 80% (Bay esian noninformat ive) probabilit y that the true HR is 
less than 0.80.  The evidence will be stronger if both cohorts s how similar efficacy, allowing for 
pooling of the cohorts.  With 80 pooled events, an observed pooled OS HR<0.67 would imply  at 
least a 79% probabilit y that the true pooled HR is less than 0.80.  Other efficacy and safet y 
outcom es will  be evaluated, so the se scenarios for the interim OS HR are included here merely 
as a reference, to illustrate the kind of evidence that might lead to the init iation of addit ional 
studi es.  For further details, refer to the study’s Statist ical Analysis Plan (a separate documen t).
A second interim efficacy  analysis may  optionally be perform ed depending on the expected 
timing of the final analysis and the results of the first interim efficacy analysis.  If a second 
I5B-MC-JGDL( c) Clinical Protocol Page 149
LY3012207interim efficacy  analysis is performed, it will be conducted appl ying a no minal alpha level of 
0.00001 to the primary OS analysis in o laratumab -naïve pat ients.
A limited number of pre -identified individuals may gain access to the limited unblinded data, as 
specified in the unblinding plan, prior to the interim or final database lock, in order to init iate the 
final populat ion PK/pharmacodynamic model deve lopment processes for interim or final 
analyses.  Informat ion that m ay unblind the study  during the analyses will not be reported to 
study  sites or b linded study  team  until the study has been unblinded.
Unblinding details are specified in the blinding section of the protocol ( Secti on9.5).  If changes 
to the unblinding plan occurred after protocol approval, they  may be described in either a 
protocol  amendment, the unblinding plan sect ion of the SAP, or in separate unblinding plan 
docum ent.

Short-term follow -upbegins the day after the patient and the inv estigator agree that the patient will no longer continue study treatment and lasts approximately 30 days (±7 days).  The date of this 
agreement is to be reported on the CRF as the date of Discontinuation from study treatment.
Long -term follow -up:begins the day after short -term follow- up is completed .
 Follow -up for progression: Patients that discontinue study treatment for reasons other than progression will be followed eve ry 6 weeks (±7 days) until PD.
 Follow -up for survival:  Patients will be followed every 23months (±7 days) for the first 2years, then every 6 months (±14 days) until the patient’s death or overall study completion.

aAssay ed by local or investigator -designated laboratory .
bDuplicate samples will also be a ssayed by Sponsor -designated laboratory .
cIf urinary  protein is ≥2+ at evaluations, a 24 -hour urine collection (to assess protein) must be collected , or alternatively, a urine protein/creatinine ratio on spot 
urine.   Note: UPC ratio of spot urine is an estimation of the 24 -hour urine protein excretion –a UPC ratio of 1 is roughly equivalent to a 24 -hour urine protein 
of 1000 mg.  UPC ratio is calculated using one of the following formulae:
[urine protein]/[urine creatinine] –if both protein and creatinine are reported in mg/dL 
[(urine protein) x 0.088]/[urine creatinine] –if urine creatinine is reported in mmol/L .
dAssay ed by a Sponsored -designated (central) laboratory. Refer to Attachm ent 6.
eSerum pregnancy test will be performed at screening in females of childbearing potential only (if the baseline serum test is positive, a repeat serum and urine 
pregnancy test will be done; if those results are positive, the investigator is to cons ult with the Lilly CRP regarding if dosing should occur and which follow -
up laboratory tests are performed).  While on -study, urine pregnancy test will be performed in females of childbearing potential only on D1 of ever y cycle or 
per local practice (which ever is of shorter duration) and at short -term follow -up visit .  If the serum pregnancy test performed for inclusion purposes is positive 
confirm by repeating the serum and performing a urine pregnancy test.  If the urine pregnancy test performed on D1 of each cycle is positive, confirm with a 
serum pregnancy test.
fPerformed only at screening in menopausal women that have experienced spontaneous amenorrhea for 6 to 12 months.  To be done for women only when 
needed to confirm postmenopausal status.
g  Per formed locally at screening only, repeat not required but should be obtained if clinically appropriate.

Treatment Groups 
CONFIDENTIAL Final Version 1.0 
This protocol describes a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, 2-
stage, efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamic study of 
IDE LA in subjects with previously treated iNHL that is 
refractory both to rituximab and to alkylating-agent-
containing chemotherapy. 
Eligible subjects will initiate oral therapy with IDELA at a 
starting dose of 150 mg BID given continuously. Treatment 
with IDELA will continue until tumor progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. Subjects will be followed in the clinic 
at 2-week intervals through the first 12 weeks oftreatment, at 
4-week intervals from 12 to 24 weeks of treatment, at 6-week 
intervals from 24 to 48 weeks of treatment, and at 12-week 
intervals thereafter. Tumor response will be evaluated at 
baseline; at 8, 16, and 24 weeks oftherapy; and every 12 
weeks thereafter according to standard criteria. The 
responses will be assessed by both the investigator and an 
independent review committee (IRC). 
The study will be conducted in 2 stages using Simon's 
optimal 2-stage design. In Stage 1 ofthe study, 31 subjects 
will be enrolled; if?:9 ofthese Stage 1 subjects have a tumor 
response, then the study will continue. In Stage 2, a further 
69 subjects will be enrolled. With a total intended sample 
size of 100 subjects, the study has power >0.90 to achieve a 
1-sided significance level of0.005 and will provide an ample 
safety database. 
Starting Dose: 150 mg BID

Site and/or 
Stratum 
Enrollment Limits 
Study Duration Final Version 1.0 
No randomization will be performed in the study. 
Study subjects will be enrolled at investigational sites in North 
America and Europe. 
At least 50 subjects with prior bendamustine exposure will be 
enrolled. The IWRS will gate accrual of subjects without prior 
bendamustine treatment. 
All subjects may receive study drug indefinitely unless any of the 
withdrawal criteria (such as withdrawal of consent, experienced an 
adverse event, or tumor progression) indicated in Section 9 of the 
protocol is met. 
Subjects will be followed in the clinic at 2-week intervals through the 
first 12 weeks oftreatment, at 4-week intervals from 12 to 24 weeks 
of treatment, at 6-week intervals from 24 to 48 weeks of treatment, 
and at 12-week intervals thereafter. Tumor response will be evaluated 
at baseline; at 8, 16, and 24 weeks of therapy; and every 12 weeks 
thereafter according to standard criteria. The responses will be 
assessed by both the investigator and an independent review 
committee (IRC), with the IRC-reviewed responses treated as primary 
in the efficacy analyses. 
Enrollment is planned to occur over ::; 15 months; subject follow-up 
will continue through ::=:: 6 months. 
1.3. Sample Size and Power 
Planned Sample Size Up to 120 subjects may be enrolled in order to ensure enrollment of 
::=:: 100 subjects (31 in Stage 1, and 69 in Stage 2) who have a 
documented diagnosis of lymphoma, who have confirmed 
refractory disease, and who can be evaluated for tumor response 
with baseline and on-study scans (through the planned 24-week, 
follow-up tumor assessment). 
Power Statement The null hypothesis that the IRC-reviewed ORR is ::; 20% will be 
tested against the alternative hypothesis that it is ::=:: 39% (ie, ~40% ). 
Using Simon's optimal 2-stage design [Simon 1989], a sample size 
of 100 subjects has power> 0.90 to achieve a 1-sided significance 
level of< 0.005 and will provide an adequate safety database. 
Actual Enrollment A total of 125 subjects have been enrolled into this study and this 
and Impact on Power will provide> 0.90 power to test the primary hypothesis.

Statistical Analysis Plan 
2. TYPE OF PLANNED ANALYSIS 
2.1. Interim Analysis Final Version 1.0 
A single formal interim analysis is planned under Simon's optimal 2-stage design. The sole 
purpose of this interim analysis is to determine ifthere is a sufficient ORR observed early in 
the study to warrant continuing the study to completion. The interim analysis constitutes a 
futility analysis; it will not be used to stop the trial early for positive efficacy. 
In Stage 1 of the study, 31 subjects will be enrolled. If~ 9 Stage 1 subjects have a response 
(ie, complete response or partial response), then the study will continue. If< 9 Stage 1 
subjects have a response, accrual to the study will be halted. At the end of Stage 1, the 
probability of erroneously proceeding with the study is 0.151 under the null hypothesis and 
of erroneously discontinuing the study is 0. 091 under the alternative hypothesis. 
If the required Stage 1 tumor ORR is seen based on investigator assessments, accrual can 
proceed in Stage 2 without interruption. If the required total number of subjects are accrued 
to Stage 1 but follow-up is not sufficiently mature (ie, through the Week 16 radiographic 
evaluation) in all Stage 1 subjects to reasonably assess the Stage 1 ORR, accrual to Stage 2 
may proceed while the Stage 1 data are being collated. All available tumor response and 
progression data will be considered at the time of the assessment. At the latest, the interim 
analysis will be performed when the last of the Stage 1 subjects has been enrolled and has 
completed the 16-week tumor assessment and these data are evaluated. 
2.2. Final Analysis 
In Stage 2 of the study, it is planned that 69 subjects will be enrolled to achieve the total 
intended sample size of 100 subjects. The final study analysis will be performed when all 
enrolled subjects have completed efficacy, safety, and other assessments through at least 
24 weeks of evaluation.

3. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR DATA ANALYSES 
3.1. Analysis Sets 
3.1.1. Intent-to- Treat Analysis Set 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set will comprise all subjects who receive ~1 dose of 
IDELA. The ITT analysis set will be used in the analyses of ORR, progression-free survival 
(PFS), overall survival (OS), safety, and study drug administration and compliance. The ITT 
analysis set will be the primary analysis set for all the efficacy variables. 
Duration of response (DOR) and time-to-response (TTR) will be analyzed based on all ITT 
subjects who achieve a CR or PR (including MR for subjects with WM). Lymph node 
response rate (LNR) will be analyzed based on all ITT subjects who have both baseline and 
2::1 evaluable post-baseline tumor assessments. 
3.1.2. Per Protocol Analysis Set 
It is anticipated that ITT subjects who meet any of the following criteria will not be included 
in the per protocol (PP) analysis set: 
• Do not have a diagnosis of lymphoma or documented refractory disease (refractory to 
both rituximab and an alkylating agent) 
• Do not have measurable nodal disease at baseline as determined by the IRC 
• Do not have a PFS event (PD or death), and do not have baseline and on-study tumor 
evaluation. 
The PP analysis set will be used in analyses of ORR, DOR, TTR, LNR and PFS. 
3.1.3. Phannacodynamic/Phannacokinetic Analysis Sets 
The pharmacodynamic /pharmacokinetic analysis sets include data from subjects in the ITT 
analysis set who have the necessary baseline and on-study measurements to provide 
interpretable results for the specific parameters of interest. 
3.2. Subject Groups 
There is only 1 treatment group for this study. 
3.3. Treatment Strata 
There is only 1 treatment group for this study and no treatment strata were planned. 
However, given the increasing relevance ofbendamustine as a component of treatment for 
subjects with iNHL, the IWRS will gate ::;so subjects without prior bendamustine treatment.

Statistical Analysis Plan 
3.4. Examination of Subject Subsets Final Version 1.0 
The efficacy endpoints (ORR, DOR, TTR and PFS) will be examined in the following 
subject subsets: 
• Refractory to last therapy status (Yes or No) 
• Number of prior therapies ( <4 or ~4) 
• Number of times refractory to an Alklating Agent (:S: 1 or> 1) 
• Number of times refractory to Rituximab (:S: 2 or> 2) 
• Refractory to bendamustine (Yes or No) 
• Disease subcategory (FL, SLL, WM or MZL ) 
• Suite for radioimmunotherapy (Yes or No) 
• Bulky status (Longest diameter of baseline lesion <7cm or~ 7cm) 
• Gender (Male or Female) 
• Age group ( <65 or ~65 years) 
• Race (White or Non-White) 
• Region (US or Non-US) 
AEs will be examined in the following subject subsets: 
• Sex (Male or Female) 
• Age group ( <65 or ~65 years) 
• Race (White or Non-White) 
• Region (US or Non-US) 
3.5. Multiple Comparisons 
Not applicable. 
3.6. Missing Data and Outliers 
Missing Data 
A missing data point for a given study visit may be due to any of the following reasons: 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 16 05 July 2013 
Idelalisib Study 101-09 
Statistical Analysis Plan Final Version 1.0 
• A visit occurred in the window but data were not collected or were unusable 
• A visit did not occur in the window 
• A subject permanently discontinued from the study before reaching the window 
In general, values for missing data will not be imputed unless methods for handling missing 
data are specified. 
Missing data in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: Lymphoma (FACT-Lym) will be 
handled according to the administration and scoring guidelines (Section 6.4.2. 5). 
Outliers 
No data will be excluded from the analyses, including any outliers. 
3. 7. Data Handling Conventions and Transformations 
• By-subject listings will be presented for subjects in the ITT analysis set and sorted by 
subject number, visit, and time (if applicable). 
• Summary tables for continuous variables will contain the following statistics: N 
(number in analysis set), n (number with data), mean, standard deviation (StD), 95% CI, 
median, Q 1, Q3, minimum, and maximum. The same number of decimal places as in the 
raw data will be presented when reporting minimum and maximum, 1 more decimal 
place than in the raw data will be presented when reporting mean, median, Q1 and Q3, 
and 2 more decimal places than in the raw data will be presented when reporting StD and 
95% CI. 
• Summary tables for categorical variables for baseline and safety data will include: N, n, 
percentage. The tables for efficacy endpoints will include standard error, and 95% Cis on 
the percentage, where appropriate. Unless otherwise indicated, 95% Cis for binary 
variables will be calculated using the binomial distribution. The denominator for the 
percentages will be the number of subjects in the respective analysis set, unless otherwise 
specified. Missing data will be included as a row in tables where it is appropriate. All 
percentages will be presented as one-decimal point, unless otherwise specified. Percents 
equal to 100 will be presented as 100% and percents will not be presented for zero 
frequencies. 
• Data from all sites will be pooled for all analyses. 
• Unscheduled visits will only be included in listings and the best or worst post-baseline 
summary. Unscheduled visits will not be included in the by-visit summary tables, unless 
otherwise specified. 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 17 05 July 2013 
Idelalisib Study 101-09 
Statistical Analysis Plan Final Version 1.0 
• Unless otherwise specified, all analyses will be 2-sided at the 0.05 level of significance. 
• For Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates, the 95% Cis will be calculated using Greenwood's 
formula with (complementary) log-log transformation. 
3.7.1. Data Handling for Efficacy Endpoints 
Ifthere is a significant degree of non-normality for a continuous endpoint, analysis may be 
performed on log-transformed data or using nonparametric methods, as appropriate. 
3.7.2. Data Handling for Laboratory data 
Laboratory data that are continuous in nature but are less than the lower limit of quantitation 
or above the upper limit of quantitation will be imputed as follows: 
• A value that is 1 unit less than the limit of quantitation will be used for calculation of 
descriptive statistics if the data is reported in the form of "<x" (xis considered the limit 
of quantitation). For example, if the values are reported as <50 and <5.0, then values of 
49 and 4.9 will be used for calculation of summary statistics, respectively. However, for 
direct bilirubin, a value of "<0.1" will be treated as 0.05 for calculation of summary 
statistics. 
• A value that is 1 unit above the limit of quantitation will be used for calculation of 
descriptive statistics if the data is reported in the form of ">x" (xis considered the limit 
of quantitation). For example, if the values are reported as >50 and >5.0, then values of 
51 and 5.1 will be used for calculation of summary statistics, respectively. 
• The limit of quantitation will be used for calculation of descriptive statistics if the data is 
reported in the form of":::; x" or "2:' x" (xis considered as the limit of quantitation). 
3.8. Visit Windows 
3.8.1. Defmition of Study Day 1 and Baseline 
Study Day 1 is defined as the day of first dose of study medication. 
Baseline is defined as the last observation before the first dose, unless otherwise specified. 
3.8.2. Analysis Windows 
For parameters that will be summarized by visit, the nominal visit as recorded on the 
electronic case report form will be used. For parameters assessed at the end of treatment 
(EOT) visit, the assessment results will be assigned to the next scheduled visit where the 
respective data were scheduled to be collected for summary. There will be no additional 
analysis windowing done based on the assessment date. 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 18 05 July 2013 
Idelalisib Study 101-09 
Statistical Analysis Plan Final Version 1.0 
3.8.3. Selection of Data in the Event of Multiple Records in a Window 
Depending on the statistical analysis method, single values may be required for each analysis 
window. For example, change from baseline by visit usually requires a single value per visit. 
Unless otherwise noted throughout the rest of this document, when a single value is needed, 
the following rule(s) will be used: 
• If more than 1 assessment occurs during the same nominal visit, select the record closest 
to the nominal day for that visit. 
• If there are 2 assessments that are equidistant from the nominal day, the data of the 
assessment after the scheduled study day will be used. 
• The last measurement will be used if multiple measurements are taken on the same day.

6. EFFICACY ANALYSES 
Imaging-based tumor assessments will be performed within 28 days prior to the start of 
treatment. On-study tumor assessments will be performed at ~8-to 12-week intervals at 
visits 1, 6, 9, 11, 13, and 15 (corresponding to baseline, Weeks 8, 16, 24, 36, and 48) and 
every 12 weeks thereafter. An end-of-treatment tumor assessment (if the subject withdraws 
from the study for reasons other than tumor progression on a routine imaging/scan) should be 
performed if the last assessment was performed > 4 weeks prior to end-of-treatment visit. 
Imaging-based tumor assessments include site of lesion and bi-dimensional measures for the 
largest diameter and the perpendicular diameter. Tumor response will be evaluated by both 
investigators and IRC. 
Data will be presented for both investigators assessments and IRC assessments. A subject's 
response status at each visit, best overall response (BOR), date of progression and date of 
first response will be determined by IRC and recorded in the IRC database. The findings of 
IRC will be considered primary for analyses of ORR and other tumor control endpoints 
(ie, DOR, TTR,% changes in tumor size and PFS). Consistency of evaluation between IRC 
and investigator assessments will be summarized by the percent agreement for overall 
response. 
6.1. Defmition of the Primary Efficacy End point 
A best overall response ofCR, PR, stable disease (SD), PD, not evaluable (NE) and no 
disease (ND) is allowed. For subjects with WM, a minor response (MR) is also allowed. In 
the event that a single PD is followed by an assessment that is SD, PR or CR which is the 
same or better than the prior nadir response and there is substantial interruption of exposure 
to study drug, that PD may not be considered in the BOR evaluation in accordance with the 
Gilead Protocol 101-09 Imaging Charter. 
ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve a CR or PR (or MR for subjects 
with WM) during the IDELA treatment. The response definitions for each category are based 
on standard criteria and defined in Section 8.1.5 of the protocol. Subjects who do not have 
sufficient baseline or on-study tumor status information to be adequately assessed for 
response status (ie, those with best overall responses ofNE or ND) will be included in the 
denominators in calculations of response rates. 
6.2. Statistical Hypothesis for the Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The study will test the hypothesis that ORR is 2: 39% (i.e. 2: ~40%) against the null 
hypothesis that it is :::; 20%. 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 24 05 July 2013 
Idelalisib Study 101-09 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
6.3. Analysis ofthe Primary Efficacy Endpoint Final Version 1.0 
The ORR and 95% CI will be presented along with the corresponding p-value from the exact 
binomial test. The number and proportion of subjects who were evaluated as CR, PR, SD, 
PD, NE, and ND will also be tabulated. 
The primary analysis for ORR will be conducted in the ITT set based on the IRC 
assessments. The investigator assessments will also be summarized. Both investigator and 
IRC assessments for tumor response will be listed in detail including site of lesion, date and 
method of evaluation, bidirectional measures and sum of the products of the perpendicular 
diameters of measurable index lesions (SPD). Summaries will also be provided for response 
at each visit separately when tumor assessment is available. 
Agreement in best overall response between IRC and investigator assessments will be 
summarized. 
6.4. Secondary Efficacy End points 
6.4.1. Defmition of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
• DOR-defined as the interval from the first documentation of CR or PR (or MR for WM 
subjects) to the earlier of the first documentation of disease progression or death from any 
cause 
• LNR-defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve a ~0 50% decrease from 
baseline in the SPD 
• TTR -defined as the interval from the start of study drug to the first documentation of 
CR or PR (or MR for WM subjects) 
• PFS -defined as the interval from the start of study drug to the earlier of the first 
documentation of disease progression or death from any cause 
• OS-defined as the interval from the date of first IDELA to death from any cause 
• Changes in HRQL as reported by subjects using the FACT-Lym 
• Changes in performance status as documented using the Kamofsky performance criteria 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 25 05 July 2013

Statistical Analysis Plan 
6.4.2. Analysis Methods for Secondary Efficacy End points 
6.4.2.1. Duration of Response and Progression-Free Survival Final Version 1.0 
The date of definitive progression will be the timepoint at which progression is first 
identified by relevant radiographic or imaging data. Death occurring:::; 30 days following the 
discontinuation of study drug will be considered as an event for the DOR and PFS 
calculation. Data will be censored on the date ofthe last tumor assessment (including 
assessments with a NE outcome) for subjects 
• who do not have disease progression or die within 30 days after discontinuation of the 
study drug, or 
• who start new anti-tumor therapy prior to documented disease progression, or 
• who have 2 or more consecutive missing tumor assessments before disease progression or 
death. 
Subjects without adequate baseline tumor response evaluation will be censored on Study Day 
1. PFS will also be summarized for responding subjects (ie, subjects with a CR or PR) and 
non-responding subjects separately. 
To assess the robustness of the primary DOR and PFS results, the following sensitivity 
analyses will be performed: 
• DOR and PFS will be assessed based on IRC assessments using the PP analysis set based 
on the same censoring rules as above. 
• DOR and PFS will be assessed based on investigators assessments using the same 
censoring rules as above. 
• DOR and PFS will be assessed based on the first PD identified by IRC without 
consideration of any drug interruption or the response status post that PD with all other 
censoring rules staying the same as the primary analysis. 
rPPD 
DOR and PFS will be summarized using KM methods and KM curves for DOR and PFS will 
be provided. All the derived endpoints will be listed. 
6.4.2.2. Lymph Node Response Rate 
The LNR will be summarized with 95% CI using the exact method based on the ITT and PP 
analysis sets using both the IRC assessments and investigators assessments. 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 26 05 July 2013 
Idelalisib Study 101-09 
Statistical Analysis Plan Final Version 1.0 
The SPD and percent change in SPD from baseline to each subsequent assessment will be 
summarized using both the IRC assessments and investigators assessments. The best percent 
change from baseline during the study will also be summarized based on the first reader of 
each reader pair ([Gilead ProtocollOl-09 Imaging Charter]) unless the adjudicator choose 
the second reader. The best percent change from baseline in SPD is defined as the largest 
decrease in tumor size while the subject was on-treatment. The baseline SPD will be the last 
value prior to the start of IDELA therapy. Note that for subjects who only have increases in 
tumor size from baseline, the smallest increase will be considered as the best change from 
baseline in SPD. Analyses will be conducted for the ITT and PP analysis sets. 
A waterfall plot of best on-treatment percent change in SPD based on the IRC and 
investigators assessments will be provided. Individual records for measurable and 
nonmeasurable lesions will be listed in detail. 
6.4.2.3. Time to Response 
TTR will be evaluated using both the IRC and investigators data based on ITT and PP 
subjects who achieve a CR or PR (or MR for WM subjects). TTR will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics. 
6.4.2.4. Overall survival 
OS will be analyzed using the KM method and KM curves for OS will be provided based on 
the ITT analysis set. An on-study OS analysis will be performed by only including deaths 
that occur while a subject is on study treatment or within 30 days post-last study treatment. 
Furthermore, OS will be analyzed by including the long-term follow-up data and considering 
any death as an event. Data from surviving subjects will be censored at the last time that the 
subject was known to be alive. 
6.4.2.5. Health-Related Quality of Life 
The FACT-Lym questionnaire includes sub scales for physical well-being (PWB, 7 items), 
social/ family well-being (SWB, 7 items), emotional well-being (EWB, 6 items), functional 
well-being (FWB, 7 items) and additional concerns (Lymphoma Subscale, LymS, 15 items). 
The FACT-Lym scoring guide identifies those negatively stated items that must be reversed 
before being added to obtain subscale totals. Negatively stated items are reversed by 
subtracting the response from "4". After reversing proper items, all subscale items are 
summed to a total, which is the subscale score. For all FACT-Lym scales and symptom 
indices, the higher score is associated with the better quality of life. The scores in the 
following items need to be reversed: 
• Physical well-being: all individual items 
• Social/family well-being: none 
• Emotional well-being: 5 individual items (except for the second item, "I am satisfied with 
how I am coping with my illness") 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 27 05 July 2013 
Idelalisib Study 101-09 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
• Functional well-being: none 
• Additional concerns: all individual items Final Version 1.0 
The subscale scores will be a summation of each individual item score. If-:::; 50% of item 
scores are missing, the subscale score will be calculated by multiplying the sum of the item 
scores by the number of items in the sub scale, then divided by the number of non-missing 
item scores. This imputes the missing scores by the mean of the non-missing scores within a 
subscale. 
Prorated subscale score = [sum of item scores] x [N of items in subscale] D I [N of items 
answered] 
The following composite scores will be derived from the above subscale total scores: 
• FACT Lym Trial Outcome Index (TOI, score range: 0-116) = PWB + FWB + LymS 
• FACT_ G Total Score (score range: 0-108) = PWB + SWB + EWB + FWB 
• FACT Lym Total Score (score range: 0-168) = PWB + SWB + EWB + FWB + LymS 
The FACT-G and FACT-Lym Total scores will be set to missing if20% or more ofthe 
included items are missing ( eg, only calculated if at least 22 of 27 FACT -G items are 
completed) or any of the component subscales are missing. TOI scores are set to missing if 
any of the component subscales are missing. 
If the baseline value is missing for subscale (ie, PWB, SWB, EWB, FWB and LymS), mean 
values ofthe corresponding subscale scores will be used to impute the baseline value. The 
mean and change from baseline in mean scores to each subsequent assessment will be 
summarized for the subscale and composite scores. The best change from baseline during the 
study, defined as the highest positive value among all post-baseline visits minus the baseline 
value, will also be summarized. 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 28 05 July 2013 
Idelalisib Study 101-09 
Statistical Analysis Plan Final Version 1.0 
Each subject's lymphoma subscale score and FACT-General subscales (ie, PWB, EWB, 
SWB, and FWB) scores at each assessment will be compared to their baseline scores. The 
minimally important difference (MID) for the FACT-Lym subscale is 3-5 points (Hlubocky 
et al, in press) and the MID for FACT-General subscales is 2-3 points (Yost and Eton 2005). 
As recommended by Yost and Eton (2005), the high end ofthis range will be used for 
interpreting individual subject change. An increase of at least 5 points will be required as a 
definition of symptom improvement for the lymphoma subscale and 3 points will be required 
as a definition of symptom improvement for the FACT -General subscales. A decline of at 
least 5 points will define symptom worsening for the lymphoma subscale and a decline of at 
least 3 points will define symptom worsening for the FACT -General subscales. Time to 
symptom response will be assessed by defining the first occurrence of symptom 
improvement as an event. Subjects who do not experience a symptom improvement 
compared to baseline will be censored at their last available PRO assessment time. 
Time-to-event analyses will be performed using the KM method. The cumulative distribution 
function (CDF) of best (or worst) change from baseline will be also provided. For the MID 
improvement comparison in Lyms, subjects with baseline score >55 will be excluded 
(ie, subjects with no room for improvement). For the MID improvement comparison in 
FACT-General subscales subjects with baseline score >57 will be excluded. 
A data listing for each individual item, the subscale scores and the composite scores will be 
presented for each subject at each visit. 
6.4.2.6. Performance Status 
The Kamofsky performance status scores and the change from baseline scores to each 
subsequent assessment will be summarized. The best and worst changes from baseline 
during the study will also be summarized. The best change from baseline is defined as the 
highest change score at post baseline. The worst change from baseline is defined as the 
lowest change score at post baseline.

7. SAFETY ANALYSES 
7.1. Adverse Events and Deaths Final Version 1.0 
The start of the AE reporting for a study subject will coincide with signing of the informed 
consent. The end of the adverse-event-reporting period occurs 30 days after discontinuation 
from study or when any ongoing drug-related AEs and/or serious adverse events (SAEs) 
have resolved or become stable. 
The focus of AE summarization will be on treatment-emergent AEs using the ITT analysis 
set. All AEs will be listed. 
7.1.1. Adverse Event Dictionary 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
version 15.1. System organ class (SOC), high level group term (HLGT), high level term 
(HL T), preferred term (PT), and lower level term (LL T) will be attached to the clinical 
database. 
7.1.2. Adverse Event Severity 
The severity of AEs will be graded by the investigator according to the CTCAE, Version 3.0, 
whenever possible. If a CTCAE criterion does not exist, the grade corresponding to the 
appropriate adjective will be used by the investigator to describe the maximum intensity of 
the AE. The severity grade will be categorized as: 
• Grade 1 (mild) 
• Grade 2 (moderate) 
• Grade 3 (severe) 
• Grade 4 (life threatening), or 
• Grade 5 (fatal) 
A missing severity grade will be considered as missing. 
7.1.3. Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug 
The investigator-described relationship of the adverse event to the study drug will be 
categorized as: 
• Definite 
• Probable

Statistical Analysis Plan 
• Possible 
• Unlikely, or 
• Unrelated Final Version 1.0 
AE will be considered as treatment-related ifthe causal relationship with study drug is 
recorded as definite, probable or possible. Events for which the investigator did not record 
relationship to study drug will be considered related and data listings will show relationship 
as mtssmg. 
7.1.4. Serious Adverse Events 
SAEs are those identified as serious in the clinical database. The clinical database will be 
reconciled with the SAE database from the Drug Safety and Public Health (DSPH) 
department before database finalization. 
7.1.5. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
7.1.5.1. Definition of Treatment- Emergent 
Treatment-emergent AEs are events in a given study period that meet one of the following 
criteria: 
• Events with onset dates on or after the start of treatment and up to 30 days after the 
permanent discontinuation of the study medication. 
• The continuing AEs diagnosed prior to the start of treatment and worsening in severity 
grade, or non-serious AEs at baseline which become serious, or AEs resulting in 
treatment discontinuation after the start of treatment. 
7.1.5.2. Incomplete Dates 
All AEs with partial onset or stop dates will be identified and the partial dates will be 
imputed as follows: 
• For AE onset date: If day and month are missing but year is available, then the imputed 
day and month will be OlJan or the first dosing date ifthey have the same year, 
whichever is later. If day is missing but the month and year are available, then the 
imputed day will be the first day of the month or the first dosing date if they have the 
same month and year, whichever is later. 
• For AE stop date: If day and month are missing but year is available, then the imputed 
day and month will be 31Dec or 30 days after the last dose of IDELA if they have the 
same year, whichever is earlier. If day is missing but the month and year are available, 
then the imputed day will be the last day of the month or 30 days after the last dose of 
IDELA if they have the same month and year, whichever is earlier.

7.1.6. Summaries of Adverse Events and Deaths Final Version 1.0 
A brief summary of treatment-emergent AEs will show the number and percentage of 
subjects who (1) had any AE, (2) had any Grade 2:3 AE, (3) had any treatment-related AE, 
( 4) had any Grade 2:3 treatment-related AE , (5) had any SAE, (6) had any treatment-related 
SAE, (7) discontinued from study drug due to an AE, (8) dose reduction due to an AE, 
(9) death due to AEs (1 0) death during study drug treatment up to 30 days post last dose and 
(11) all deaths including long-term follow up . 
Summaries (number and percentage of subjects) of treatment-emergent AEs (by SOC, HLT 
and PT) will be provided as follows: 
• All AEs 
• All AEs by severity 
• Grade 2:3 AE 
• All AEs occurring in at least 10% of subjects

• Grade 2:3 treatment-related AEs 
• All SAEs 
• All treatment-related SAEs 
• All AEs that caused discontinuation from study drug 
• AEs leading to deaths 
Multiple events will be counted once only per subject in each summary. For data 
presentation, SOC, HL T and PT will be sorted by decreasing frequency. For summaries by 
severity grade, the most severe event will be selected. In addition to the presentation by SOC 
and HL T, each summary listed above will also be presented by preferred term in decreasing 
frequency. 
Summary of all treatment-emergent AEs will also be summarized by SOC, HLT and PT, and 
by PT only in the following subgroups: sex (Male or Female), age group (<65 or >=65 years) 
and race (White or Non-White). 
In addition to the by-treatment summaries, data listings will be provided for the following:

date is after the first dose date, the relative day will be calculated as (AE onset date-first 
dose date + 1 ), however, if the AE onset date is prior to the first dose date, the relative day 
will be calculated as (AE onset date-first dose date). 
7.2. Laboratory Evaluations 
All laboratory data will be listed. Summaries of laboratory data will be based on observed 
data and will be reported using SI units. The focus of laboratory data summarization will be 
on treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities using the ITT analysis set. 
7.2.1. Summaries of Numeric Laboratory Results 
Descriptive statistics (sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, Ql, Q3, minimum and 
maximum) will be provided for each laboratory test specified in the study protocol as 
follows: 
• Baseline values 
• Values at each post-baseline analysis window 
• Change from baseline at each post-baseline analysis window 
In the case of multiple values in an analysis window, data will be selected for analysis as 
described in Section 3.8.3. In addition, the mean change from baseline for lab parameters will 
be plotted over time. 
7.2.2. Summaries of Categorical Laboratory Results

Statistical Analysis Plan 
7.2.3. Graded Laboratory Values Final Version 1.0 
Applicable hematological and serum biochemistry laboratory data will be programmatically 
graded according to CTCAE, Version 4.03 severity grade [grade laboratory results as 
Grade 0, mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), severe (Grade 3), or life threatening (Grade 4)]. 
Grade 0 includes all values that do not meet criteria for an abnormality of at least Grade 1. 
Some laboratory tests have criteria for both increased and decreased levels; analyses for each 
direction (ie, increased, decreased) will be presented separately. 
7.2.3.1. Treatment- Emergent Laboratory Abnormalities 
A treatment-emergent laboratory abnormality is defined as an abnormality that, compared to 
baseline, worsens by ?:1 grade in the period from the first dose ofiDELA to 30 days after the 
last dose of study treatment. If baseline data are missing, then any graded abnormality 
(ie, an abnormality that is Grade ?: 1 in severity) will be considered treatment-emergent. 
7.2.3.2. Summaries of Laboratory Abnormalities 
The following summaries (number and percentage of subjects) oftreatment-emergent 
laboratory abnormalities will be provided (subjects will be categorized according to most 
severe abnormality grade): 
• Baseline and worst post-baseline laboratory abnormalities 
• Grade?: 3 laboratory abnormalities 
For all summaries of laboratory abnormalities, the denominator is the number of subjects in 
the ITT analysis set. A listing of treatment-emergent Grade?: 3 laboratory abnormalities will 
be provided. 
7.2.4. Shift in CTCAE Grade Relative to Baseline 
Shift tables will be presented by showing change in CTCAE severity grade from baseline to 
the worst grade post baseline. 
7.2.5. Transaminase elevations 
Analysis of transaminase elevations will be based on laboratory values. Number and 
percentage of subjects will be summarized for subjects 
• with Grade 3 or 4 ALT/AST elevation 
• with Grade 3 or 4 ALT/AST elevation resolved to both ALT/AST of Grade 1 or less 
• re-challenged after dose interruption due to Grade 3 or 4 ALT/AST elevation

less 
Kaplan-Meier curves and estimates will be provided for time to onset of first Grade 3 or 4 
treatment-emergent ALT/ AST elevations. Time to onset of first event is defined as time from 
start of study treatment to the start date of first Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent AL T I AS T 
elevation, ie, time in days is calculated as (start date of first occurrence) -(date of first dose 
of study drug) + 1. In the absence of an event, the censoring date applied will be the earliest 
from the following dates: last dose date (if treatment discontinued)+ 30 days, analysis data 
cut-off date and death. 
For subjects with at least 1 episode of Grade 3 or 4 ALT/AST elevation, time to resolution of 
first episode oftreatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 ALT/AST elevation to Grade 1 or less will 
be summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates. The same censoring rule described above for 
time to onset will be used. In addition, the same analysis will be performed for subjects who 
are rechallenged due to Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent ALT/ AST elevations. 
7.3. Vital Signs 
Vital sign data (body temperature, sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures , and sitting 
pulse rate) will be summarized in the following tables: 
• Actual values and the changes from baseline by visit for each measure 
• Number and percent of subjects by systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 
category (high, normal, low) at each visit categorizing SBP?: 140 mmHg as high and 
< 90 mmHg as low; DBP?: 90 mmHg as high and< 60 mmHg as low. 
Data for body weight and height will be listed with the vital signs as collected in the CRF. 
High or low values for vital signs will be flagged. 
7.4. Prior Therapy and Prior Radiation 
Number of prior regimens and time since the completion of last regimen will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics (sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, Q1, Q3, 
minimum and maximum). A partial completion date will be imputed using the following 
algorithm for the last regimen: 
• If day and month are missing but year is available, then the imputed day and month will 
be OlJan or the starting date ofthe last regimen, whichever is later; 
• If day is missing but the month and year are available, then the imputed day will be the 
first day of the month, or the starting date of the last regimen, whichever is later; 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 35 05 July 2013 
Idelalisib Study 101-09 
Statistical Analysis Plan Final Version 1.0 
• If year is missing, no imputation will be done and the completion date will be treated as 
mtssmg. 
Number(%) of subjects who received 1, 2, 3, ... prior regimens will also be provided. In 
addition, number(%) of subjects refractory to rituximab, refractory to alkylating-agent, 
refractory to bendamustine, and refractory to last therapy will also be summarized. 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for number of subjects who received certain regimens 
(eg, BR, CHOP, R-CHOP). Descriptive statistics will also be provided for the last regimen 
subjects received prior to study entry. The best response (n, %) to last therapy, and duration 
of response to the last therapy will be summarized. 
Number of subjects received prior radiation will be summarized and will be listed. 
7.5. Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant medications will be coded by means ofthe World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary (WHO DRUG) dictionary, June 2010 into Anatomical- Therapeutic-Chemical 
classification (ATC) codes. 
Concomitant medications are defined as any medications meeting the following criteria: 
• Starting on or after the first dose of IDE LA treatment up to 30 days post the last dose 
• Starting before and continuing after the first dose of IDELA treatment up to 30 days post 
the last dose 
The incomplete dates handling method used for AE summaries will be used for concomitant 
medication summaries (section 7.1.5.2). 
Prior medications are defined as any medications stopped before the first dose of study drug. 
Summaries of the number and percentage of subjects who used prior and concomitant 
medications will be presented in tabular form by preferred drug name based on ITT analysis 
set. The summary tables will be sorted by descending frequency of preferred term in the 
total column. Subjects will only be counted once for multiple drug use (by preferred drug 
name) per subject. 
Concomitant medications started on/ -after the start of study medication or ongoing 
medications will be flagged on the prior and concomitant medication data listing. 
The summaries and listings will be based on the ITT analysis set. 
7.6. Electrocardiogram Results 
The following analyses of electrocardiogram (ECG) results are intended to identify gross 
changes in QT intervals. The 12-lead ECG measurements will be collected at screening , 
Visit 9 (Week 16), and end oftreatment visit.

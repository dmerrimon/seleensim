Number : PRO 10 ; ONC -2014 -138 (Bayer); PRO10/1200.262 (Boehringer Ingelheim) /Pro 10 Exelixis  
Sponsor:  Sarah Cannon  Development Innovations , LLC  – Nashville – TN 
Study  Duration:  Enrollment  will occur over approx imately 18 months.   The 
total duration of the study is planned to be approximately 
27 months.  Phase of Study :  II 
Study  Center s: This study will be conducted at approximately 20 sites.  
Number of 
Patients:  Up to  160 patients are planned to be enrolled in this study.  
Objectives:  Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to:  
• Determine the overall response rate (Complete Response [CR] + Partial Response 
[PR]) in each patient population receiving targeted therapy based on relevant genomic alter ations.  
Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives of this study are to:  
• Evaluate the clinical benefit rate (CR + PR + stable disease [SD] ≥ 6 months) in 
each patient population receiving targeted therapy based on relevant genomic 
alterations.  
• Determine the time to treatment failure (measured from the first day of treatment until the patient is removed from study for toxicity, disease progression, patient 
choice, or death) in each patient population receiving targeted therapy based on relevant genomic alterations.  
• To determine the progression free survival (PFS) in each patient population receiving targeted therapy based on relevant genomic alterations.  
Study  Design : This four -arm pilot phase II study will evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of selected 
commercially available molecularly matched targeted therapies in pat ients who have failed 
first line treatment for one of the following tumor types:   (1) non- small cell lung cancer, (2) 
urothelial carcinoma, (3) non -colon gastrointestinal cancers, and (4) upper aerodigestive 
tract cancers.  Patients will be profiled with next -generation sequencing technology results 
known prior to consideration for enrollment on this protocol.  Patients with the specified 
tumor types demonstrating one of the genomic alterations described in Table 1 may be 
assessed for protocol eligibility and treatment.  All eligible patients will receive one of the FDA -approved targeted agents at the recommended dose outlined in Table 2.  Patients with a 
genomic alteration that is not described in Table 1 but is covered by a targeted agent in Table 2 will also be eligible . Dose modifications will be implemented based on criteria 
outlined in the product package insert for each individual agent.  Patients will be 
re-evaluated for treatment response after receiving 8 weeks of oral therapy (with the 
exception o f regorafenib which is dosed intermittently for 21 out of every 28 days).  
Response to therapy will be assigned using RECIST v1.1 (see Section E).  Patients who have

 objective response (OR) or stable disease (SD) will continue treatment with re -evaluations  
every 8 weeks, until the time of tumor progression or intolerable treatment -related side 
effects.  If a patient was not profiled with Foundation One® prior to study enrolment, S arah 
Cannon  Development  Innovations  shall use reasonable efforts to collect an d send to 
Foundation Medicine adequate tumor tissue meeting the tissue specimen requirements for 
Foundation One® for retrospective profiling that will be completed and compared to the

20. Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C . 
21. Presence of other active cancers unless indolent and not requiring therapy.  Patients with Stage I cancer who have received definitive local treatment and are considered unlikely to recur are eligible.  All patients with previously treated in situ carcin oma 
(i.e., non -invasive) are eligible, as are patients with history of non -melanoma skin 
cancer. 
22. Psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit compliance with the protocol.  
Correlative 
Testing:  Patients will be profiled with next -generation sequencing technology outside of this protocol 
and will be enrolled based on the results of this profiling.  If a patient was not profiled with Foundation One
® prior to study enrolment, S arah Cannon Development Innovations  shall 
use reasonable efforts to collect and send to Foundation Medicine adequate tumor tissue 
meeting the tissue specimen requirements for Foundation One® for retrospective profiling 
that will be completed and compared to the profiling report provided at study ent ry.   
Statistical 
Methodology  The design of this trial uses an exact single -stage design for each of the four arms. (A’Hern 
2001)  For this investigation, it has been determined that an ORR (CR + PR) of 10% or worse has low activity in line with standard of care.  An ORR of 25% (or better) is considered to indicate interesting activity.  Using a one- sided alpha of 5% and power of 
80%, 40 evaluable patients will be required in each arm.  A minimum of 8 responders in a 
particular arm would indicate that the corresponding tumor type would be worthy of further 
investigations.

 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background and Rationale 
Advances in next generation sequencing technologies in combination with decreasing costs of 
testing has allowed broader implementation of ge nomic profiling  in the clinical practice of 
medical oncology and clinical research. (Thomas et al. 2014; Johnson et al. 2014; Gray et al. 2014; Schwaederle et al. 2014)  The identification of genomic alterations that drive the development and progression of specific tumors has resulted in the discovery of targeted agents that may produce tumor regressions in tumors that possess the alteration.  More than 30 targeted 
small molecules and monoclonal antibodies have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of a variety of cancers.  
Johnson et al. recently published a retrospective evaluation of the use of a targeted next-generation sequencing platform (FoundationOne) in advanced cancer patients.  (Johnson et al.  
2014) The assay identifie d potentially actionable genomic alterations in 83% of tumors with a 
median of two actionable mutations per patient.  Fifty -seven percent of patients were identified 
by NGS testing as potential candidates for clinical trials in which th e tumor- targeted treatment 
had demonstrated early clinical activity or preclinical rationale for use.  Twenty -six percent of 
patients had alterations that predicted sensitivity to targeted agents that were already approved for the cancer type assessed  and an additional 17% demonstrated alterations that could be 
targeted by an FDA -approved agent for another tumor type. 
Researchers at MD Anderson Cancer Center have also reported on the ability to select therapy in a phase I clinical trials program based on tumor alterations detected with an institutionally developed CLIA- certified sequencing panel.  ( Tsimberidou et al, 2012)  Approximately 40% of 
the pa tients tested had 1 or more alte ration.  Patients  whose tumors had an alte ration were treated 
with matched ta rgeted therapy when available and compared to a group with out matched 
targeted therapy.  Patients receiving matched therapy had a higher overall response rate (27% vs 5%), longer time to treatment failure (5.2 vs 2.2 months) and longer survival (13.4 vs 9 months) compared to the non- matched group. In a separate manuscript, patients with PIK3CA mutations 
were treated, whenever feasible, with agents targ eting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and 
compared to patients with wild -type PIK3CA treated  on the same protocol s.  (Janku et al. 2012)  
Patients with PIK3CA mutations who were treated with targeted therapies demonstrated a higher response rate than patients without mutations (30% vs 10%). 
Similar data have been reported by Von Hoff et al.  In this pilot study, pati ents from nine 
different centers were molecularly profiled in a CLIA -certified lab. (Von Hoff et al 2010 )  A 
molecular target was detected in 98% of patients and 66 patients were treated with the regimen 
recommended by the profiling.  Patients in the study  served as their own control as progression-
free survival following the treatment regimen selected by molecular profiling was compared with the progression-fee survival for the most recent regimen on which the patient experienced progression. The molecular-profiling approach to treatment selection resulted in a longer

 progression- free survival in 27% of patients compared to the progression-free survival obtained 
with their most recent therapy.  
The University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center recently reported their initial 
experience with a molecular tumor board created to review molecula r test results.  (Schwaederle 
et al. 2014)  There was a median of 4 molecular alterations per patient found by next-generation sequencing.  Among the 11 evaluable patients whose treatment was determined by molecular diagnostics, 3 achieved partial responses.  The most common reasons for not acting on the molecular diagnostics results were that patients were ineligible for or could not travel to an appropriately targeted clinical trial and/or that insurance would not cover the recommended agent.  
Targeting specific molecular alterations with next -generation sequencing and other genomic 
technologies could transform oncology.  In order to facilitate the incorporation of molecular profiling into routine clinical practice, the French National Cancer Institute and French Ministry of Heal th have established a process  to profile patients free of charge nationwide across the 
health -care system.  (Nowak et al. 2012) Decreasing technology costs and increased insurance 
coverage of sequencing tests will allow for increased availability in other regions.  Additional challenges that may limit widespread use of molecular profiling include information processing, genomic medical educat ion and interpretati on, cost, and reimbursement . (Thomas et al. 2014)  
Perhaps the biggest challenge for physicians utilizing molecular profiling is bei ng unable to act 
on a known alte ration because a targeted drug is not available commercially for that in dication or 
in the clinical trial setting.  ( Munoz et al. 2013)  Both the clinical trial system and the system of 
financial coverage for approved drugs are inadequate, as they were designed for individual drugs being utilized in unselected patient populations. Preliminary profiling results  suggest that an 
individual patient’s tumor possesse s a unique set of molecular alterations that may require a 
customized treatment regimen based on the targeted alterations rather than the histologic tumor type.  Initial trials have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes in patients receiving treatment 
regimens  matched to known molecular alte rations.  However, additional trials in this setting are 
warranted to further identify patient subgroups that may benefit from target ed therapies.  
This phase II study will evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of selected commercially available molecularly matched targeted therapies in patients whose tumors have progressed while receiving or following first line treatment for one of the following four tumor types:   (1) non-small cell lung cancer, (2) urothelial carcinoma, (3) non-colon gastrointestinal cancers (including hepatobiliary, pancreatic, and gastroesophageal tumors), and (4) upper aerodigestive tract cancers (including l ip, tongue, salivary glands, gum, oral cavity, mouth, tonsils, oropharynx, 
nasopharynx, nasal cavity, sinus, and larynx tumors).  The most common genomic alterations  
associated with these tumors are summa rized in Table 1.

All drugs will be administered according to the recommended package insert dose.  Dosing will be continuous daily for all drugs except regorafenib, which is dosed for 21 days out of every 28 days.  For the purposes of the study, a treatment cycle will be defined as 28 days.  Recommended dose modifications for treatment- related toxicities are outlined in the package insert prescribing 
information.  Patients will r eturn to clinic on day 1 of every treatment cycle for evaluation and 
scans will be performed every 2 cycles for disease assessment.  The product package ins erts for 
the individual drugs are included in Appendices G and H. 
 1.3 Rationale for the Study  
With the increased availability of next -generation sequencing, oncologists are beginning to 
incorporate genomic profiling into the routine care of cancer patients.  More than half of all 
patients will have an actionable genomic alteration in their tumor when profiled, which could 
help guide the choice of targeted therapy treatment.  Multiple targeted agents are now available

 for clinical use and numerous additional agents are currently in clinical trials.  Several agents that 
target specific g enomic mutations have been approved based on improved treatment outcomes in 
a population of patients enriched for the specific genomic alteration ( eg. crizotinib, vemurafenib, 
dabrafenib, ceritinib).  Preliminary studies also suggest that targeting treatment toward known tumor g enomic characteristics improves the chances of disease response with targeted agents.  
This pilot study will evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of selected commercially available molecularly matched targeted therapies in patients who have failed f irst line treatment 
for one of the following four tumor types:   (1) non- small cell lung cancer, (2) urothelial 
carcinoma, (3) non-colon gastrointestinal cancers, and (4) upper aerodigestive tract cancers.   
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary Objective  
The primary o bjective  of this study is to : 
• Determine the overall response rate (Complete Response [CR] + Partial Response 
[PR]) in each patient population receiving targeted therapy based on relevant genomic alterations.    
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives of this study are to:  
• Evaluate the clinical benefit rate (CR + PR + stable disease [SD] ≥ 6 months ) in 
each patient population receiving targeted therapy based on relevant genomic alterations.  
• Determine the time to treatment failure (measured from the first day of treatment until the patient is removed from study for toxicity, disease progression, patient 
choice, or death)  in each patient population receiving targeted therapy based on 
relevant genomic alterations.  
• To determine the progression free survival (PFS) in each patient population receiving targeted therapy based on relevant genomic alterations.

discontinuation must be followed until the laboratory values have returned to Grade 1 or 2, unless it is, in the opinion of the investigator, not likely that these values are to improve.  In this case, the investigator must record his or her reasoning for making this decision in the patients’ medical records and as a comment in the e CRF.  
4. STUDY REGISTRATION 
The patient must willingly consent after being informed of the procedures to be followed, the experimental nature of the treatment, potential benefits, treatment alternatives, side -effects, risks , 
and discomforts.  Human protection committee ( Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics 
Committee  [IRB/EC] ) approval of this protocol and consent form is required.  Eligible patients 
who wish to participate in the study will be enrolled into the study. 
Registration must occur prior to the initiation of protocol therapy.  Patients eligible to participate 
in the study may be enrolled through the Sarah Cannon Development Innovations Central Enrollment Desk.  The enrollment desk may be reached by calling (877) MY-1- SCRI.  
Registration may be done via fax (866) 699 0258 Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Central Standard Time.  Patient registration will be confirmed via email within 24 hours, or by the next business day . 
5. STUDY DESIGN  
This four- arm pilot phase II study will evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of selected 
commercially available
 molecularly matched targeted therapies in patients who have failed first 
line treatme nt for one of the following tumor types:  (1) non- small cell lung cancer, (2) urothelial 
carcinoma, (3) non-colon gastrointestinal cancers, and (4) upper aerodige stive tract cancers.  
Patients will be profiled with next-generation sequencing technology results known prior to consideration for enrollment on this protocol.  Patients with the specified tumor types demonstrating one of the genomic alterations described  in Table 1 may be assessed for protocol 
eligibility and treatment.  Patients with a genomic alteration that is not described in Table 1 but is covered by a targeted agent in Table 2 will also be eligible.
  All eligible patients will receive one 
of the FDA-approved targeted agents at the recommended dose outlined in Table 2.  Dose modifications will be implemented based on criteria outlined in the product package insert for each individual agent.  Patients will be re -evaluated for treatment response after r eceiving 8

 weeks of oral  therapy  (with the exception of regorafenib which is dosed intermittently for 21 out 
of every 28 days).  Response to therapy will be assigned using RECIST v1.1 (see Appendix  E).  
Patients who have objective response (OR) or stable disease (SD) will continue treatment with 
re-evaluations every 8 weeks, until the time of tumor progression or intolerable treatment- related 
side effects.  If a patient was not profiled with Foundation One® prior to study enrolment, Sarah 
Cannon Development  Innovations shall use reasonable efforts to collect and send to Foundation 
Medicine adequate tumor tissue meeting the tissue specimen requirements for Foundation One® 
for retrospective profiling that will be completed and compared to the profiling report provided at study entry.  
A total of 160 patients are planned to be enrolled on the trial (40 patients per study arm).  
5.1 Treatment Plan  
5.1.1 FDA -Approved Targeted Agents  
The FDA -approved targeted agents that will be administered during the study are outlined in 
Table 2.  Study drugs will be provided by the manufacturer and will not be billed to the patient’s 
insurance as the proposed usage is considered off-label for the agent.  The treating physician will decide which  targeted agent will be prescribed based on the  genomic alterations per tumor type 
and the targets listed in the package insert for each agent that are outlined in Tables 1 and 2.  Patients with a genomic alteration that is not described in Table 1 but is covered by a targeted agent in Table 2 will also be eligible.
  The Medical Monitor will verify the genomic alteration 
and prescribed targeted agent when the patient is registered for the trial.  
All patients entering this study will receive one of the targeted agents orally  either daily 
continuously at the prescribed dose listed in Table 2 (except for regorafenib which is dosed daily for 21 out of every 28 days).  Patients will be instructed to take the medication with or without food as directed in the product package insert.  The time of day for administration of study drug should be consistent. 
If the patient misses a dose of study drug , the patient should skip the missed dose and take the 
next dose as scheduled. If vomiting occurs after taking the study medication, the patient should be instructed not to 
retake the dose.  Patients should take the next scheduled dose of study drug.  If vomiting persists the patient should contact the investigator. 
No routine prophylactic antiemetics will be given.  However, antiemetics may be administered 
for the tre atment of  nausea and vomiting when they occur, and may be given prophylactically 
afterwards.  
Study drug compliance will be assessed by pill counts on Day 1 of each cycle.  The research staff will count and document the amount of study drug taken and returned by the patient.

 5.2 Treatment Duration  
Patients will continue to receive treatment until disease progression, the patient requests to 
discontinue treatment, or the treating physician feels it is in the best interest of the patient to discontinue.  
For the purposes of the study, a treatment cycle is defined as 28 days.  Patients will be evaluated 
for toxicity at the start of each cycle.  Every 2 cycles  restaging will occur with imaging, 
laboratory tests will be assessed as defined in Appendix E. 
5.3 Concomitant M edications  
Patients will be instructed not to take any additional medications during the course of the study 
without prior consultation with the research team.  At each visit, the patient will be asked about any new medications he is taking or has taken af ter the start of the study drug. 
5.3.1 Permitted Concomitant Medications  
No routine prophylactic antiemetics will be given.  However, antiemetics may be administered for the treatment of  nausea and vomiting when they occur, and may be given prophylactically 
afterwards.   Anti- emetics may be administered  according to standard practice guidelines. 
Medications may be administered for maintenance of existing conditions prior to study enrollment or for a new condition that develops while on study, including but not lim ited to the 
following: 
• Bisphosphonate use, as recommended according to practice guidelines 
• Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) inhibitor use, as recommended according to practice guidelines  
Other medications considered necessary for  the patient’s safety and well -being may be given at 
the discretion of the investigator. 
5.3.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
The following treatments are prohibited  or should be used with caution while in this study:  
• No other investigational therapy should be given to patients.  No anticancer agents other than the study medications should be given to patients.  If such agents are required for a patient, then the patient must firs t be withdrawn from the study. 
• Herbal preparations/medications are not allowed t hroughout the study.  These herbal 
medications include, but are not limited to: St. John’s wort, kava, ephedra (ma huang), gingko biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), yohimbe, saw palmetto, and ginseng.  Patients should stop using these herbal medication s 7 days prior to first dose of study drug. 
• Regorafenib and cabozantinib are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system.  
Therefore, drugs that are strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be avoided.  These drugs are listed in Appendix F.  Othe r potential drug interactions are described in the

6. DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
If toxicity occurs, the toxicity will be graded  utilizing the NCI CTCAE v 4.03 
(http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE ), a
nd appropriate supportive care treatment will be 
administered to decrease the signs and symptoms thereof.  Dose adjustments will be based on the 
organ system exhibiting the greatest degree of toxicity.  
Doses of study drug will be modified based on hematologic and non- h ematologic toxicity  as 
outlined in the product package insert for each FDA-approved targeted agent.  If dose reductions are necessary, they will be permanent for the remainder o f the treatment.  Any patient requiring a 
toxicity -related dose delay of more than 28 days from the intended day of the next scheduled 
dose must be discontinued from the study. 
7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND EVALUATIONS  
7.1 Overview

9. RESPONSE EVALUATIONS  AND MEASUREMENTS  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumors (RE CIST) Version 1.1 (see Appendix E ).  Lesions are either measurable or non -
measurable according to the criteria.  The term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used, as it does not provide additional meaning or accuracy. 
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Statistical Design  
This four- arm pilot phase II study will evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of selected 
commercially available
 molecularly matched targeted therapies in patients who have failed first 
line treatment for one of the following tumor types:   (1) non- small cell lung cancer, (2) 
urothelial carcinoma, (3) non-colon gastrointestinal cancers, and (4) upper aerodigestive tract 
cancers.  Patients will be profiled with next-generation sequencing technology results known prior to consideration for enrolment on this protocol.  Patients with the specified tumor types demonstrating one of the genomic alterations described in Table 1 may be assessed for protocol eligibility and treatment.  Patients with a genomic alteration that is not des cribed in Table 1 but is 
covered by a targeted agent in Table 2 will also be eligible
. All eligible patients will receive one 
of the FDA-approved targeted agents at the recommended dose outlined in Table 2. 
Sample Size Considerations  
The design of this tri al uses an exact single- stage design for each of the four arms. (A’Hern 
2001)  For this investigation, it has been determined that an ORR (CR + PR) of 10% or worse 
has low activity in line with standard of care.  An ORR of 25% (or better) is considered to indicate interesting activity.  Using a one -sided alpha of 5% and power of 80%, 40 evaluable 
patients will be required in each arm.  A minimum of 8 responders in a particular arm would indicate that the corresponding tumor type would be worthy of further investigations.   
10.2 Data Analysis 
Descriptive statistics, including mean, median, standard deviations and ranges for all continuous 
measures will be tabulated and reported.  Percentages and frequencies for all categorical measures will also be presented. Tim e to events endpoints will be reported using Kaplan- Meier 
estimates, with 95% confidence intervals (CI)  for median time to event.

 10.2.1 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline disease char acteristics will be summarized .  Data to be tabu lated will 
include demographic features such as age, sex and race, as well as disease- specific 
characteristics.  
The number and percentages o f patients screened,  treated, and withdrawn from treatment/study 
for any reason will be presented overall and also b y study arm . 
10.2.2 Efficacy Analysis 
All efficacy analyses will be performed using the Intent -To-Treat Population. 
• Overall Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with confirmed 
complete response ( CR) or partial response ( PR (i.e. 2 CRs or P Rs at least 4 weeks apart) 
according to the RECIST v1.1.   
• Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) is defined as the proportion of patients with CR, PR or SD ≥ 6 months according to the RECIST v1.1.  
o For ORR and CBR, patients without a post- baseline tumor assessment will be 
classed as not evaluable (NE) and considered as non -responder. 
 
• Time to treatment failure (TTF) is measured from the first day of treatment until the 
patient is removed from study for toxicity, disease progression, patient choice, or death. 
 
• Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the first day of study drug 
administration (Day 1) to disease progression as defined by the R ECIST  v1.1, or death on 
study.  Patients who are alive and free from disease progression will be censored at the date of last tumor assessment.  
For ORR and CBR, the estimates and the associated 95% CI  (based on the Clopper- Pearson 
method) in each treatment group will be calculated.  
For PFS , Kaplan -Meier curves will be generated and the median time to event and the associated 
95% CI  will be provided. 
10.2.3 Safety  Analysis  
Safety will be assessed through the analysis of the reported incidence of treatment -emergent 
AEs.  Treatment -emergent AEs are those with an onset on or after the initiation of therapy, and 
will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v. 4.03.  A copy of CTCAE scoring system may be downloaded from: http:// evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-
14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf . 
The AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), and summarized using system organ class and preferred term by treatment arm  for all patients in the

Other safety endpoints including laboratory results, vital signs and ECG findings will be summarized for all patients in the Safety Population   
10.3 Analysis Time Points  
10.3.1 Final Analysis  
The final analysis of the study will occur when the required number of response evaluable patients has been reached in each treatment arm . 
11. SAFETY REPORTING AND ANALYS ES 
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording protocol-defined AEs and Serious Adverse E vents (SAEs), measurement of protocol- specified laboratory tests  and other protocol-
specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation o f the study drug. 
The Principal Investigator is responsible for recognizing and reporting AEs to the Sarah Cannon Development Innovations Safety Department .  It is the Sponsor’s responsibility to report relevant 
SAEs to the applicable local, national, or international regulatory bodies.  In addition, Investigators must report SAEs and follow-up information to their responsible IRB/EC according to the policies of that IRB/EC.  
 The Principal Investigator is also responsible for ensuring that every staff member involved in 
the study is familiar with the content of this section . 
11.1 Definitions   
11.1.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  An adverse event (also known as adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the use of a drug, without any judgement about causality.   An adverse event can arise with any use of the drug (e.g., off-label use, use in 
combination with another drug) and with any route of administration, formulation, dose or including overdose.

 11.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An AE or a suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is considered “serious” if it results in any of 
the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening AE  
• Inpatient hospitalization of at leas t 24-hours  or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct norma l life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patie nt or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dys crasias 
or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.   
It is important to distinguish between “serious” and “severe” AE, as the terms are not 
synonymous.  Severity is a measure of intensity; however, an AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  Seriousness serves as the guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  “Serious” is a regulatory definition and is based on patient/event outcome or action usually associated  with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or vital functions.  
For example, nausea which persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but may not be considered an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke which results in only a limited de gree of 
disability may be considered only a mild stroke, but would be considered an SAE.  Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs on the eCRF and SAEs on the SAE Report Form. 
11.1.3 Adverse Reaction  
An adverse reaction means any adverse event caused by a drug.  Adverse reactions are a subset 
of all suspected adverse reactions where there is a reason to conclude that the drug caused the event.  
11.1.4 Suspected Adverse Reaction  
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.  Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.

 11.1.5 Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events  
Recording of Adverse Events  
All AEs of any patient during the course of the research study will be recorded in the eCRF, and 
the investigator will give his or her opinion as to the relationship of the AE to the study drug treatment (i.e., whether the event is related or unrelated to study drug administration). 
All AEs should be documented.  A description of the event, including its date of onset and 
resolution, whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE) or not, any action taken (e.g., changes to study treatment), and outcome, should be provided, along with the investigator’s assessment of causality (i.e., the relationship to the study treatment[s]).  For an AE to be a suspected treatment -related event there should be at least a reasonable possibility of a causal 
relationship between the protocol treatment and the AE.  Adverse events will be graded according to  the NCI CTCAE v4.03, and changes will be documented. 
If the AE is serious, it should be reported immediately to Sarah Cannon Development Innovations Safety Department.  Other untoward events occurring in the framework of a clinical study are to be recorded as AEs (i.e., AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including invasive procedures such as biopsies, 
medication washout, or no treatment run- in). 
Any clinically significant signs and symptoms; abnormal test findings; changes in physical examination; hypersensitivity; and other measurements that occur will be reported as an AE, and collected on the relevant eCRF screen.  
Test findings will be reported as an AE if: the test result requires an adjustment in the study 
drug(s) or discontinuation of treatment, and/ or test findings require additional testing or surgical intervention, a test result or finding is associated with accompanying symptoms, or a test result is considered to be an AE by the investigator. 
Reporting Period for Adverse Events  
All AEs regardless of seriousness or relationship to the FDA -approved targeted agents (called 
study t reatment), spanning from the start of study treatment, until 30 calendar days after 
discontinuation or completion of study treatment as defined by the clinical study for that patient, 
are to be recorded on the corresponding screen(s) included in the eCRF. 
All AEs resulting in discontinuation from the study should be followed until resolution or 
stabilization.  All new AEs occurring during this period must be reported and followed until resolution unless, in the opinion of the investigator, the AE or laboratory abnormality/ies are not likely to improve because of the underlying disease.  In this case, the investigators must record his or her reasoning for this decision in the patient’s medical record and as a comment on the eCRF screen.  
After 30 days of completion of protocol-specific treatment or discontinuation, only AEs, SAEs, or deaths assessed by the investigator as treatment related are to be reported.

 11.1.6 Assessment of Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs whether volunteered by the patient, discovered by study personnel during 
questioning, or detected through physical examination, laboratory test, or other means will be reported appropriately.  Each reported AE or SAE will be described by its duration (i.e., start and end dates), regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to the study drug (see following guidance), and actions taken. 
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should apply the 
following general guideline:  
YES:  There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and administration of the study medication, and the AE cannot be readily explained by the patient’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapies, and/or the AE follows a known pattern of response to the study drug, and/or the AE abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study drug or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re- challenge.  
NO:  Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study drug (e.g., pre-
existing medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication), and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to study drug administration (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after first dose of study drug). 
11.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting by Investigators  
Adverse events classified by the treating investigator as serious require expeditious handling and reporting to S arah Cannon  Development Innovations Safety Department in order to comply with 
regulatory requirements.  Determination of life -threatening or serious is based on the opinion of 
either the Sponsor or the Investigator.   
Serious AEs may occur at any time from the start of study treatment through the 30 day follow-
up period after the last study treatment.  The S arah Cannon Development  Innovations Safety 
Department must be notified of all SAEs, regardless of causality, within 24 hours of the 
first knowledge of the event by the treating physician or research personnel.   
To report a SAE, the SAE Report Form should be completed with the necessary information. 
The SAE report should be sent to Sarah Cannon Development Innovations Safety Department 
via fax or e-mail using the using the following contact information (during both business and 
non-business hours):

 The initial report must be as complete as possible, including an assessment of the causal 
relationship between the event and the investigational product (s), if available.  Information not available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end date for the AE or laboratory values received after the report) must be documented on a follow-up report .  A fin al report to document 
resolution of the SAE is required. 
Follow-up information for SAEs and information on non-serious AEs that become serious should 
also be reported to S arah Cannon Development Innovations Safety Department as soon as it is 
available; the se reports should be submitted using the Sarah Cannon Development Innovations 
SAE Report Form.  The detailed SAE reporting process will be provided to the sites in the SAE reporting guidelines contained in the study reference manual.  
Investigators must rep ort SAEs and follow-up information to their responsible IRB according to 
the policies of the responsible IRB.

11.3 Recording of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
11.3.1 Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms 
All AEs should be recorded individually in the patient’s own words (verbatim) unless, in the 
opinion of the Principal Investigator or designated physician, the AEs constitute components of a 
recognized condition, disease, or syndrome.  In the latter case, the condition, disease, or syndrome should be named rather than each individual sign or symptom.  If a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate on the relevant form(s) (SAE Report Form and/or AE eCRF screen).  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow-up information is available.  If a diagnosis is determined subsequent to the reporting of the cons tellation of symptoms, the 
signs/symptoms should be updated to reflect the diagnosis. 
Progression of malignancy (including fatal outcomes), if documented by use of appropriate 
method (for example, as per RECIST criteria for solid tumors), should not be reported as an SAE.  
11.3.2 Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation time points.  Such events should only be recorded once on the SAE Report Form and/or the AE eCRF screen .  If a persistent AE becomes more severe or lessens in severity, it should be 
recorded on a separate SAE Report Form and/or AE eCRF screen.  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between patient evaluation time points, and subsequently recurs.  All recurrent AEs should be recorded on an SAE Report Form and/or AE eCRF screen.  
11.3.3 Abnormal Laboratory Values 
If an abnormal laboratory value or vital sign is associated with clinical signs and/or symptoms, the sign or symptom should be reported as an AE or SAE, and the associated laboratory value or vital sign should be considered additional information that must be collected on the relevant eCRF screen.  If the laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome, only the diagnosis needs to be recorded  on the SAE Report Form or AE eCRF screen. 
Abnormal laboratory values will be reported as an AE if: the laboratory result requires an adjustment in the study drug(s) or discontinuation of treatment, and/ or laboratory findings require additional testing or surgical intervention, a laboratory result or finding is associated with accompanying symptoms, or a laboratory result is considered to be an AE by the investigator.

 11.3.4 Deaths  
Deaths that occur during the protocol- specified AE reporting period that are attri buted by the 
Investigator solely to progression of disease will be recorded on the “Study Discontinuation”  
eCRF screen.  All other on study deaths, regardless of attribution, will be recorded on an SAE 
Report Form and expeditiously reported to the S arah Cannon Development  Innovations Safety 
Department.  
When recording a SAE with an outcome of death, the event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the SAE Report Form and Adverse Event screen of the eCRF.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, record “Death NOS” on the eCRF Adverse Event screen.  During post- study survival follow -up, deaths attributed to progression of disease will be 
record ed only on the “After Progressive Disease Follow- Up” eCRF screen.  
11.3.5 Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization, or Surgery 
Any AE that results in hospitalization of >24 hours or prolongation of pre -existing 
hospitalization should be documented and reported a s an SAE unless specifically instructed 
otherwise in this protocol.  There are some hospitalizations that do not require reporting as an SAE.  
Treatment within or admission to the following facilities is not considered to meet the criteria of “inpatient hos pitalization” (although if any other SAE criteria are met, the event must still be 
treated as an SAE and immediately reported):  
• Emergency Department or Emergency Room  
• Outpatient or same -day surgery units 
• Observation or short-stay unit 
• Rehabilitation facility  
• Hospice or skilled nursing facility  
• Nursing homes, Custodial care or Respite care facility  
Hospitalization during the study for a pre-planned surgical or medical procedure (one which was planned prior to entry in the study), does not require reporting a s an SAE to the S arah Cannon 
Development Innovations Safety Department.  
11.3.6 Pre-Existing Medical Conditions  
A pre -existing medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such conditions 
should be recorded on the General Medical History eCRF screen.  A pre- existing medical 
condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When recording such events on an SAE Report Form and/or AE eCRF screen, it is importan t to convey the concept that the pre-existing condition has 
changed by including applicable descriptors.

 11.3.7 New Cancers  
The development of a new primary cancer should be regarded as an AE and will generally meet 
at least one of the seriousness criteria.  New primary cancers are those that are not the primary reason for the administration of the study treatment and have developed after the inclusion of the patient into the study.  They do not include metastases of the original cancer.  Symptoms of metastasis or  the metastasis itself should not be reported as an AE/SAE, as they are considered to 
be disease progression. 
11.3.8 Pregnancy, Abortion, Birth Defects/Congenital Anomalies 
If a patient becomes pregnant while enrolled in the study, a Pregnancy Form should be 
completed and faxed to the S arah Cannon Innovations Safety Department.  S arah Cannon 
Development Innovations Safety Department should be notified expeditiously, irrespective of whether or not it meets the criteria for expedited reporting.  Abortions (spontaneous, accidental, or therapeutic) must also be reported to Sarah Cannon  Development Innovations Safety 
Department.  
If a female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during the male patient’s participation in this study, this must be reported to the Sarah Cannon Development Innovations Safety Department immediately.  Every effort should be made to follow the pregnancy for the final pregnancy outcome. 
Congenital anomalies/birth defects always meet SAE criteria, and should therefore be 
expeditiously reported as an SAE, using the previously described process for SAE reporting.  A Pregnancy Form should also have been previously completed, and will need to be updated to reflect the outcome of the pregnancy.  
11.3.9 FDA -Approved Targeted Agent  Overdose  
Symptomatic and n on-symptomatic overdose must be reported in the eCRF.  Any accidental or 
intentional overdose with the study treatment that is symptomatic, even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion, is to be reported to the Sarah Cannon Development Innovations Safety  
Department no greater than 24 hours from first knowledge of the event using the corresponding screens in the eCRF and following the same process described for SAE reporting if  the overdose 
is symptomatic.  
For information on how to manage an overdose of th e FDA -approved targeted ag ents, see the 
product package insert for each individual agent included in Appendices G and H. 
 11.4 Sarah Cannon Development  Innovations Safety Department Serious Adverse

 Sarah Cannon Development  Innovations Safety Department is responsible for reporting relevant 
SAEs to the competent authority, other applicable regulatory authorities, and participating  
investigators, in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines, 
FDA regulations, and/or local regulatory requir ements.  
11.4.1 Sarah Cannon Development  Innovations Safety Department Assessment of 
Unexpected  
Sarah Cannon Development Innovations is responsible for assessing an AE or SAR as 
“unexpected”.  
An AE or SAR is considered “unexpected” when the following conditions oc cur: 
• Event(s) is not mentioned in the IB (or current USPI) 
• Event(s) is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed 
• An event(s) is not consistent with the General Investigative Plan or in the current application  
• Includes AEs or SAR that may be anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the 
study drug, or that occur with members of the drug class, but that have previously been 
observed under investigation. 
When applicable, an unexpected AE may also apply to an event that is not listed in the current USPI or an event that may be mentioned in the USPI, but differs from the event because of greater severity or specificity.  
Known as Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR), these events suspected (by the Investigator or Sponsor) to be related to the study drug, are unexpected (not listed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure [IB] or USPI), and are serious (as defined by the protocol) and require 
expedient submission to relevant health authorities  within 7 days (fatal or life -threatening event) 
or 15 days (all serious events), or as defined by law.  The term SUSAR is used primarily in the 
reporting of events to regulatory authorities. 
Expected AEs are those events that are listed or characterized in the USPI or current IB.  
11.4.2 Sponsor Reporting for Clinic al Studies under  an Investigational New Drug

12. Q UALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL  
12.1 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, quality audits, and inspections by the 
Sponsor or its representative(s), government regulatory authorities, and the IRB/EC of all study-
related documents (e.g., source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, case report forms).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study- related facilities.  The investigator will ensure that the s tudy monitor or any other 
compliance or Quality Assurance reviewer is given access to all study -related documents and 
study- related facilities.  
At the Sponsor’s discretion, Source Document Verification (SDV) may be performed on all data items or a percentage thereof.  
Participation as an investigator in this study implies the acceptance of potential inspection by government regulatory authorities, the Sponsor or its representative(s) , or the pharmaceutical 
companies providing drug supply for the study. 
13. ETHIC AL, FINANCIAL, AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
This research study will be conducted according to the standards of Good Clinical Practice 
outlined in the ICH E6 Tripartite Guideline and CFR Title 21 part 312, applicable government regulations, institutional research policies and procedures and any other local applicable 
regulatory requirement(s). 
13.1 Institutional Review Board Approval 
The clinical study protocol, informed consent form ( ICF), Patient Information Sheet (PIS), 
product package insert , available safety information, patient documents (e.g., study diary), 
patient recruitment procedures (e.g., advertisements), information about payments (i.e., Principal 
Investigator payments) and compensation available to the patients and documentation evidencing the Pri ncipal Investigator’s qualifications should be submitted to the IRB for ethical review and 
approval if required by local regulations, prior to the study start.  
The Principal Investigator/Sponsor and/or designee will follow all necessary regulations to ensure appropriate, initial, and on-going , IRB  study review.  The Principal Investigator/Sponsor 
(as appropriate) must submit and, where necessary, obtain approval from the IRB for all subsequent protocol amendments and changes to the informed consent document.  Investigators will be advised by the Sponsor or designee whether an amendment is considered substantial or non-substantial and whether it requires submission for approval or notification only to an IRB.

 Safety updates for the individual FDA-approved tar geted agents  will be prepared by the Sponsor 
or its representative as required, for distribution to the I nvestigator(s) and submission to the 
relevant IRB . 
13.2 Regulatory Approval 
As required by local regulations, the Sponsor will ensure all legal aspects are covered, and 
approval of the appropriate regulatory bodies obtained, prior to study initiation.  If required, the Sponsor will also ensure that the implementation of substantial amendments to the protocol and other relevant study documents happen only after approval by the relevant regulatory authorities. 
13.3 Informed Consent  
Informed consent is a process by which a patient voluntarily confirms his or her willingness to 
participate in a particular study after having been informed of all aspects of the study tha t are 
relevant to the patient's decision to participate.  Informed consent is documented by means of a written, signed, and dated informed consent form (ICF) . 
The ICF will be submitted for approval to the IRB that is responsible for review and approval of 
the study.  Each consent form must include all of the relevant elements currently required by the FDA, as well as local county authority or state regulations and national requirements. 
Before recruitment and enrollment into the study , each prospective cand idate will be given a full 
explanation of the research study.  Once the essential information has been provided to the 
prospective candidate, and the Investigator is sure that the individual candidate understands the implications of participating in this r esearch study, the candidate will be asked to give consent to 
participate in the study by signing an ICF.  A notation that written informed consent has been 
obtained will be made in the patient’s medical record.  A copy of the ICF, to include the patient’s 
signature, will be provided by the investigator to the patient. 
If an amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design or the potential risks to the 
patients, the patient’s consent to continue participation in the study should be obtained. 
13.3.1 Confidentiality  
13.3.1.1 Patient Confidentiality  
Confidentiality of patient’s personal data will be protected in accordance with the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  HIPAA regulations require that, in order to participate in the study, a patient must sign an authorization form for the study that he or she has been informed of following: 
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from patients in this study 
• Who will have access to that information and why 
• Who will use or disclose that information

 • That health information may be further disclosed by the recipients of the information, and 
that if the information is disclosed the information may no longer be protected by federal or state privacy laws  
• The information coll ected about the research study will be kept separate from the 
patient’s medical records, but the patient will be able to obtain the research records after the conclusion of the study  
• Whether the authorization contains an expiration date 
• The rights of a res earch patient to revoke his or her authorization 
In the event that a patient revokes authorization to collect or use his or her PHI, the investigator, by regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of patient authorization.  For patients that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should 
be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e., that the patient is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period. 
In compliance with  ICH GCP guidelines and applicable parts of 21 CFR it is a requirement that 
the investigator and institution permit authorized representatives of the Sponsor, the regulatory 
authorities and the IRB/ EC direct access to review the patient’s original medical records at the 
site for verification of study- related procedures and data.  
Measures to protect confidentiality include: only a unique study number and initials will identify patients in the eCRF or other documents submitted to the Sponsor.  This information, together with the patient’s date of birth, will be used in the database for patient identification.  Patient names or addresses will not be entered in the e CRF.  No material bearing a patient’s name will 
be kept on file by Sponsor.  Patients will be informed of their rights within the ICF. 
13.3.1.2 Investigator and Staff Information 
Personal data of the investigators and sub-investigators may be included in the Sarah Cannon 
Development Innovations database, and shall be treated in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.  When archiving or processing personal data pertaining to the investigator or sub investigator, Sarah Cannon  Development Innovations shall take all appropriate measures to 
safeguard and prevent access to this data by any unauthorized party.

14.1 Amendments to the Protocol  
Amendments to the protocol shall be planned, documented, and signature authorized prior to 
implementation.  
If an amendment to the protocol is required, the amendment will be originated and documented by the Sponsor.  All amendments require review and approval of all pharmaceutical companies and the Principal Investigator supporting the study.  The written amendment must be reviewed and approved by the Sponsor, and submitted to the IRB at the investigator’s facility for the board’s approval. 
Amendments specifically involving change to study design, risk to patient, increase to dosing or 
exposure, patient number increase, addition or removal of new tests or procedures, shall be reviewed and approved by the IRB  of record for the Investigator’s facility.  
The amendment will be submitted formally to the FDA or other regulatory authorities by the Sponsor as applicable, and IRB approval obtained, and s pecifically when an increase to dosing or 
patient exposure and/or patient number has been proposed; or, when the addition or removal of an Investigator is necessitated.  
Items requiring a protocol amendment approval from  IRB and/or FDA or other regulatory 
authorities includes, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Change to study design  
• Risk to patient 
• Increase to dose or patient exposure to drug 
• Patient number increase  
• Addition or removal of tests and / or procedures 
• Addition/removal of a new Investigator 
It should be further noted that, if an amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design or the potential risks to the patients, their consent to continue participation in the study should be obtained.

14.3 Study  Documentation and Storage 
The Principal Investigator  must maintain a list of appropriately qualified persons to whom he/she 
has delegated study duties and should ensure that all persons assisting in the conduct of the study are informed of their obligations.  All persons authorized to make entries and/or corrections on the eCRF s are to be included on this document.  All entries in the patient’s e CRF are to be 
supported by source documentation where appropriate. 
Source documents are the original documents, data, records,  and certified copies of original 
records of clinical findings, observations, and activities from which the patient’s eCRF data are 
obtained.  These can include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory, medico- technical department and pharmacy records, diaries, microfiches, ECG

 traces, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate and complete, 
photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, and correspondence. 
The Principal Investigator and each study staff member is responsible for maintaining a comprehensive and centralized filing system (e.g., regulatory binder o r investigator study file 
[ISF]) of all study- related (essential) documentation, suitable for inspection at any time by 
representatives from the Sponsor and/or applicable regulatory authorities.  The ISF must consist of those documents that individually or collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of the study and the quality of the data produced.  The ISF should contain as a minimum all relevant documents and correspondence as outlined in ICH GCP Section 8 and 21 CFR Part 312.57, including key documents such as the IB and any amendments, protocol and any amendments, copies of completed eCRF s, IRB approval documents, Financial Disclosure forms, patient 
identification lists, enrollment logs, delegation of authority log, staff qualification documents, laboratory normal ranges, records relating to the study drug including accountability records.  Drug accountability records should, at a minimum, contain information regarding receipt, shipment, and disposition.  Each form of drug accountability record, at a minimum, should contain Principal Investigator  name, date drug shipped/received, date, quantity and batch/code, 
or lot number for identity of each shipment.  In addition, all original source documents supporting entries in the eCRF must be maintained and be readily available.  
The Sponsor shall maintain adequate product records and financial interest records as per 21CFR Part 54.6 and Part 312.57 for no less than 2 years after the last shipment / delivery of the drug for investigational use is discontinued and the FDA has been notified of the discontinuation. 
The Investigator shall maintain adequate records of drug disposition, case histories, and any other study-related records as per 21 CFR Part 312.62 for no less than 2 years after the last shipment / deliv ery of the drug for investigational use is discontinued and the FDA has been 
notified of the discontinuation. 
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or from the Sponsor or its 
representative, the investigator additionally agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient information to link records e.g., e CRFs, medical records), all 
original, signed ICFs , and copies of all eCRFs, SAE Reporting forms, source documents, 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and related essential regulatory documents.  The documents listed above must be retained by the investigator for as long as needed to comply with national and international regulations (generally 2 years after discontinuing clinical development or after the last marketing approval).  Sponsor will notify the investigator(s)/institutions(s) when the study- related r ecords are no longer required. 
If the investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the study, both the Sponsor and its representative should be prospectively notified.  The study records must be transferred to an acceptable designee, such as another investigator, another institution, or to the Sponsor .  The 
investigator must obtain the S ponsor ’s written permission before disposing of any records, even 
if retention requirements have been met.  All study files will be maintained by the Sponsor (Sarah Cannon Development Innovations) throughout the study, and w ill be held by the  Sponsor 
at the conclusion of the study.

 14.4 Data Collection 
The study e CRF is the primary data collection instrument for the study .  Case report forms will 
be completed using the English language and should be kept current to enable the Sponsor to 
review the patients’ status throughout the course of the study. 
In order to maintain confidentiality, only study number, patient number, initials and date of birth 
will identify the patient in the e CRF.  If the patient’s name appears on  any other document (e.g., 
laboratory report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to be supplied to Sarah Cannon Development Innovations and replaced instead with the patient number and patient’s initials.  The investigator will maintain a personal patient identification list (patient numbers with corresponding patient identifiers) to enable records to be identified and verified as authentic.  Patient data/information will be kept confidential, and will be managed according to applicable local, state, and federal regulations.  
All data requested in the eCRF must be supported by and be consistent with the patient’s source documentation.  All missing data must be explained.  When a required laboratory test, assessment, or evaluation has not been done or an “Unknown” box is not an option on the e CRF, 
a note should be created verifying that the field was “Not Done” or “Unknown.”  For any entry errors made, the error(s) must be corrected, and a note explaining the reason for change should be provided. 
The investigator will sign and date the patient eCRF casebook indicating that the data in the 
eCRF has been assessed.  Each completed eCRF will be signed and dated by the Principal 
Investigator, once all data for that patient is final.  
14.5 Disclosure and Pu blication Policy  
All information provided regarding the study , as well as all information collected/documented 
during the course of the study, will be regarded as confidential.  The Sponsor reserves the right to release literature publications based on the results of the study.  Results from the study will be published/presented as per the Sponsor’s publication process.  
Inclusion of the investigator in the authorship of any multi center  publication will be based upon 
substantial contribution to the design, analysis, interpretation of data, drafting and/or critically revising any manuscript(s) derived from the study.  The investigator acknowledges that the study is part of a multicenter  study and agrees that any publication by the investigator of the results of 
the study conducted at research site shall not be made before the first multicenter  publication.  In 
the event there is no multi center  publication within fifteen (15) months after the study has been 
completed or terminated at all study sites, and all data has been received, the investigator shall have the right to publish its results from the study , subject  to the notice requirements described 
herein and subject to acknowledgement of the Sponsor as appropriate.  Investigator shall provide the Sponsor thirty (30) days to review a manuscript or any poster presentation, abstract or other written or oral material which describes the results of the study for the purpose only of determining if any confidential or patentable information is disclosed thereby.  If the Sponsor requests in writing, the investigator shall withhold any publication or presentation an additional

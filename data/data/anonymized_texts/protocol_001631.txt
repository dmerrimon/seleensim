5INTRODUCTION
5.1 Rationale and Backgr ound
Daily  wear contact lenses are worn during waking hours for a full day  and then removed for 
cleaning and disinfection prior to reinsertion the follo wing day . Frequent replacement daily  
wear contact lenses are replaced according to the product package insert provided by  the 
contact lens manufacturer .
 
 
 
 
 
In this clinical study , the clinical performance of the investigational  contact lens will 
be assessed and the  contact lens will be compared to the commercially  available

Biofinity  contact lens in a crossover design, both to be worn in a daily  wear modality  and 
replaced on a monthly  basis.
5.2 Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this stud y is to assess the clinical performance of the investigational  
contact lens over 30 day s of daily  wear .The primary  endpoint was selected to address the 
primary  objective of the study . Procedures for measurement of these endpoints were selected 
based on common practice for these assessments. The design of this study  is justified based 
upon preclinical and clinical testing, as described within the I nvestigator’s Brochure. 
Biofinity  contact lenses were chosen as the control product because these lenses have the 
same wear modality  and replacement schedule.
At the end of the study , a clinical study  report will be prepared in accordance with applicable 
regulatory  requirements and standards.
5.3 Risk s and Benefits
Contact lenses may  offer improved peripheral vision and the convenience of not wearing 
spectacles. Material properties and design characteristics of the contact lens in development 
are features consistent with successful contact lens wear .
Based upon non -clinical testing and/or documented rationale for applicability  of test results 
to the I P, the new contact lens in development is assessed to be non -toxic and biocompatible 
for on -eye use.
Biofinity  contact lenses are commercially  available for dail y wear use under a monthly wear
modality ; further details on any  known potential risks and benefits can be found in the 
package insert.
A summary  of the known potential risks and benefits associated with the  contact 
lens in development can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure . Risks are minimized by  
compliance with the eligibility  criteria and study  procedures, clinical oversight and 
monitoring, and through close supervision b y a licensed clinician during exposure to the 
study  lenses.

The sit e personnel will educate subjects on proper hy giene and lens handling, as well as
compliance with the use of contact lenses according to the protocol. Subjects should be 
instructed not to wear contact lenses while sleeping or swimming. The site personnel w ill 
also advise the subjects to remove contact lenses and return for prompt follow -up of 
symptoms, such as ocular discomfort, foreign body  sensation, excessive tearing, vision 
changes, or h yperemia.

Permanent vision loss as defined b y loss of 2 or more lines of BCV A from enrollment 
visit that fails to resolve
Uveitis (anterior , intermediate, or posterior)
Corneal abrasion affecting ≥50% of corneal surface area
Significant Non -Serious Adverse Events
A significant non -serious AE is a device-r elated, non -sight threatening adverse event that 
warrants discontinuation of an y contact lens wear for greater than or equal to 2 weeks. In 
addition, the I nvestigator must report any  occurrence of the following as a Significant 
Non-Serious Adverse Event:
Peripheral non- progressive non- infectious ulcers
All sy mptomatic corneal infiltrative events
Corneal staining score greater than or equal to grade 3 (Refer to MOP  for grading 
scales) 
Temporary  vision loss as defined by  loss of 2 or more lines of BCV A from enrollment 
visit that persists for 2 or more weeks
Neovascularization score greater than or equal to grade 2 (Refer to MOP  for grading 
scales)
The above events ar e based on the categories pr ovided in the ISO 1 1980 and the US FDA  
Premarket Notification (510 (k)) Guidance Document for Daily W ear Contact Lenses.
Device Deficiencies
A device deficiency  is inadequacy  of a medical device with respect to its identity , quality , 
durability , reliability , safety , or performance. A device deficiency  may  or may  not be 
associated with patient harm (ie, ADE or SADE); however , not all ADEs or SADEs are due 
to a device deficiency . The Investigator should determine the applicable category listed in the 
Device Deficiency  eCRF for the identified or suspect device deficiency  and report an y patient 
harm separately . Examples of device deficiencies include the following: 
Failure to meet product specifications (eg, incorrect lens power/diameter/base 
curve/color)
Lens/solution cloud y

Lens surface/edge defect 
Torn lens during handling /in pack 
Packaging deficit (eg, mislabeled product, tampered seal, leaking bottle/container)
Suspect product contamination
Lack of performance
11.2 Monitoring for Adverse Events
At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity  to spontaneousl y mention any 
problems, the Investigator should inquire about AEs by  asking the standard questions shown 
below and report as applicable:
“Have you had an y health problems since your last study  visit? ”
“Have there been an y changes in the medicines you take since your last study  visit? ”
In addition, changes in any pr otocol -specific parameters and/or questionnair es evaluated 
during the stud y are to be reviewed b y the Investigator . Any untoward (unfavorable and 
unintended) change in a protocol -specific parameter or quest ionnair e response that is 
clinically  relevant, in the opinion of the I nvestigator , is to be reported as an AE. These 
clinically  relevant changes will be reported regardless of causality . 
11.3 Procedures for Recording and Reporting
AEs are collected from the time of informed consent .Any pre -existing medical conditions or 
signs/sy mptoms present in a subject prior to the start of the study  (i.e., before informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study  and should be recorded in the subject ’s 
Medical History .
In addition, temporary  lens awareness or visual changes during the fitting process are not 
considered AEs if the Investigator assesses that the sy mptom(s) can reasonably  resolve within 
the anticipated adaptation period. 
For each recorded event, the ADEs and SAEs documentation must include: date of 
occurrence, severity , treatment (if applicable), outcome, and assessments of the seriousness 
and causality . In addition, the I nvestigator must document all device deficiencies reported or 
observed with test and control products on the Device Deficiency  eCRF . The site must submit 
all available information on ADEs, SAEs, and device deficiencies to the Study  Sponsor 
immediately  as follows:

ADEs or SAEs are documented on the Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device 
Effect eCRF within 24 hours of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness. 
Device deficiencies are documented on the Device Deficiency eCRF within 24 hours 
of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness. 
A printed cop y of the completed Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect 
and/or Device Deficiency eCRF must be included with product returns. Please refer to 
the MOP for further details regarding product returns. 
Additional relevant information after initial reporting must be entered into the eCRF as 
soon as the data become available.  
Document an y changes to concomitant medications on the appropriate eCRFs.
Document all relevant information from Discharge Summary , Autopsy  Report,
Certificate of Death etc., if applicable, in narrative section of the Serious Adverse 
Event and Adverse Device Effect eCRF .
Note: Should the EDC system become non -operational, the site must complete the 
appropriate paper Serious Adverse E vent and Adverse Device Ef fectand/or Device 
Deficiency  Form. 
The completed form is emailed to the Study  Sponsor at 
msus.safety @alcon.com according to the timelines outlined above; however , the reported 
informat ion must be entered into the EDC sy stem once it becomes operational.
Any AEs and device deficiencies for non -study  marketed devices/products (i e,CLEAR 
CARE disinfection solution) will be considered and processed as spontaneous (following the 
post-market vigilance procedures) and should be communicated to the device ’s/product ’s 
manufacturer as per local requirements.
Study  Sponsor representatives may  be contacted for any  protocol -related question and their 
contact information is provided in the Manual of Procedures that accompanies this protocol.
Further , depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency  being reported, the Study  
Sponsor may  request copies of applicable portions of the subject’ s medical records. The 
Investigator must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regulatory  authorities or I RB/IEC.
Intensity and Causality Assessments
Where appropriate, the Investigator must assess the intensity  (severit y) of the AE based on 
medical judgment with consideration of any subjective symptom(s), as defined below:
Alcon - Business Use Only   Effective Date:

TDOC-0057641
Protocol - Clinical
09-Jul-2020
Page 45of 56
Intensity (Severity)
Mild An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily  tolerate the sign or 
symptom.
Moderate An AE is moderate if the sign or s ymptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the subject ’s usual activities.
Severe An AE is severe if the sign or sy mptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject ’s inability  to work or engage in their usual activities.
For every  AE in the study, the Investigator must assess the causalit y (Related or Not Related 
to the medical device or study  procedure). An assessment of causality  will also be performed 
by Study  Sponsor utilizing the same definitions, as shown below:
Causality
Related AnAE classified as related may  be either definitely  related or possibl y 
related where a direct cause and ef fect relationship with the medical 
device or stud y procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a 
reasonable possibility  that the AE was caused b y the medical device or 
study  procedure.
Not Related An AE classified as not related may  either be definitely  unrelated or 
simply  unlikel y to be related (ie, there are other more likely causes for the 
AE).
The Study  Sponsor will assess the AEs and may  upgrade the Investigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality . The Study  Sponsor will notify  the Investigator of an y AEs that is 
upgraded from non -
serious to serious or from unrelated to related.
Furthermore, the Study  Sponsor shall promptly  conduc t an evaluation of any  unanticipated 
adverse device effect, including anticipated adverse events that occur in unanticipated 
severit y or frequency . The results of this evaluation will be reported to the FDA, the IRB, and 
participating Investigators within 10 working day s upon receiving notification of the effect.
11.4 Return Product Analysis

(GPCMS). 
11.5 Unmask ing of the Study Treatment
Masked information on the identity  of the assigned medical device should not be disclosed 
during the stud y (refer to Section 9.4 T reatment Masking). If the treatment code needs to be 
broken in the interest of subject safet y, the Investigator is encouraged to cont act an 
appropriate Stud y Sponsor representative prior to unmasking the information if there is 
sufficient time. Dependent upon the individual circumstances (i e, medical emergency ), the 
code may  be broken prior to contact with the Study  Sponsor . The Study  Sponsor must be 
informed of all cases in which the code was broken and of the circumstances involved. 
Additionally , the Study  Sponsor may  be required to unmask the information in order to fulfill 
expedited regulatory  reporting requirements.
11.6 Follow -Up of Sub jects with Adverse Events
The Investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the 
study  and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the study . 
The Investigator sho uld provide the Study  Sponsor with any  new safet y information (which 
includes new AEs and changes to previousl y reported AEs) that may  affect the safet y 
evaluation of the device. For AEs that are unresolved/ ongoing at time of subject exit from 
study , any  additional information received at follow - up should be documented in the eCRFs 
up to study  completion (ie, database lock). 
Any additional data received up to 3 months after subject discontinuation or exit must be 
documented and available upon the Study  Sponsor ’s request. All complaints received after 
this time period will be considered and processed as spontaneous (following the postmarket 
vigilance procedures) and should be communicated to the medical device ’s manufacturer as 
per local requirements.
The I nvestigator should also report complaints on non- Alcon products directly  to the 
manufacturer as per the manufacturer ’s instructions or local regulatory  requirements.

12.5 Handling of Missing Data
All data obtained in evaluable subjects/ey es will be included in the analy sis. No imputation 
for missing values will be carried out for the primary   effectiveness
12.6 Safety Analys es
The safet y endpoints are: 
AEs
Biomicroscop yfindings
Device deficiencies
There are no safet y hypotheses planned in this study . The focus of the safet y anal ysis will be 
a comprehensive descriptive assessment of occurrence of adverse events as well as the other 
listed parameters. 
All AEs occurring from the time a subject signs informed consent to study  exit will be 
accounted for in the reportin g. Safety  anal yses will be conducted using the safet y analysis set 
on a treatment -emergent basis. Descriptive summaries (counts and percentages) for ocular

and nonocular AEs will be presented by  Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities 
Preferred T erms. AEs leading to study  discontinuation, significant non- serious AEs, and 
SAEs will be identified. Individual subject listings will be provided, as necessary .
Individual subject listings will be provided for AEs that occur after signing informed consent 
but prior to exposure to IP .
Each biomicroscop y parameter will be tabulated by its grade. For each biomicroscop y 
parameter , counts and percentages of ey es that experience an increase of ≥ 2 grades from 
baseline (last assessment prior to study lens exposure foreach period ) to any  subsequent visit 
within the same period will be presented. A supportive listing will be generated which will 
include all biomicroscopy  data from all visits within the same period for those ey es 
experiencing the increase.
Two listings f or device deficiencies, prior to exposure of study  contact lenses and 
treatment -emergent, will be provided. Additionally , each device deficiency  category  will be 
tabulated.
No inferential testing will be done for safet y anal ysis.

13DATA HANDLING AND ADMINISTRA TIVE REQUIREMENTS
13.1 Subject C onfidentiality
The Investigator must ensure that the subject’ s anony mity is maintained throughout the 
course of the stud y. In particular , the Investigator must keep an enrollment log with 
confidential identify ing information that corresponds to the subject numbers and initials of 
each st udy participant. At the end of the clinical study , the Study  Sponsor will collect a copy  
of the enrollment log without any identifying subject information . All documents submitted 
to the Study  Sponsor will identify  the subjects exclusively  by number and de mographic 
information. No other personally  identify ing information will be transmitted to the Study  
Sponsor .
13.2 Completion of Sour ce Documents and Case R eport Forms
The nature and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that original data 
required to complete the CRFs exist and are accessible for verification by  the site monitor , 
and all discrepancies shall be appropriately  documented via the query  resolution process. Site
monitors are appointed by the Stud y Sponsor and are independent of stud y site staf f.
If electronic records are maintained, the method of verification must be determined in
advance of starting the study . 
At a minimum, source documents include the following information for each subject:
Subject identification (name, sex, race/ethnicit y)
Documentation of subject eligibility

Date of informed consent
Dates of visits
Documentation that protocol specific procedures w ere performed
Results of study  parameters, as required b y the protocol
IP accountability  records
Documentation of AEs and other safet y parameters (if applicable)
Records regarding medical histories and the use of concomitant therapies prior to and 
during t he stud y
Date of stud y completion and reason for earl y discontinuation, if applicable
It is required that the author of an entry  in the source documents be identifiable. Direct access 
to source documentation (medical records) must be allowed for the purpos e of verify ing that 
the data recorded on the CRF are consistent with the original source data.
Only  designated individuals at the site will complete the CRFs. The CRFs must be completed 
at regular intervals following the clinical study  visit schedule. I t is expected that all data 
reported have corresponding entries in the source documents. The Principal I nvestigator is 
responsible for reviewing and certify ing that the CRFs are accurate and complete. The onl y 
subject identifiers recorded on the CRFs will be subject number , and subject demographic 
information. 
13.3 Data Review and Clarifications
A review of CRF data to the subject’ s source data will be completed by  the site monitor to 
ensure completeness and accuracy . After the CRFs have been completed, additional data 
clarifications and/or additions may  be needed as a result of the data cleaning process. Data 
clarifications are documented and are part of each subject’ s CRF .
13.4 Sponsor and Monitoring Responsibilities
The Study  Sponsor will designate a monitor to conduct the appropriate site visits at the 
appropriate intervals according to the stud y monitoring plan. The clinical investigation will 
be monitored to ensure that the rights and well -being of the subjects are protected, the 
reported data are accurate, complete, and verifiable from the source documents, and the study  
is conducted in compliance with the current approved protocol (and amendments[s], if 
applicable), with current GCP , and with applicable regulatory  requirements.

The site may  not screen subjects or perform the informed consent process on any  subject until 
it receives a notification from an appropriate Study Sponsor representative that the site may 
commence conducting study  activities. Monitoring will be conducted periodically  while the 
clinical study is ongoing. Monitoring methods may  include site visits, telephone, written and 
fax correspondence. Close -out visits will take place after the last visit of the last subject at the 
site.
A Coordinating Investigator may  be identified by  the Study  Sponsor to review and endorse 
the final study  report. In cases where a Coordinating Investigator is engaged , the Study  
Sponsor will select the Coordinating Investigator based upon their experience, qualifications, 
active study  participation, and their willingness an d ava ilability  to take on this role.
13.5 Regulatory Documentation and Records Retention
The Investigator is required to maintain up
-to-date, complete regulatory  documentation as 
indicated b y the Study Sponsor and the Investigator ’s files will be reviewed as pa rt of the 
ongoing stud y monitoring. Financial information is to be kept separately . 
Additionally , the Investigator must keep study records and source documents consistent with 
the terms of the clinical study  agreement with the Study  Sponsor . If the Invest igator retires, 
relocates, or for an y other reason withdraws from responsibility  of keeping the study  records, 
then the Study  Sponsor must be notified and suitable arrangements made for retention of 
study  records and source documents needed to comply with national and international 
regulations.
13.6 Quality Assurance and Quality Contr ol
The Study  Sponsor will secure agreement from all involved parties to ensure direct access to 
all study  related sites, source data and documents, and reports for the purpose of mo nitoring

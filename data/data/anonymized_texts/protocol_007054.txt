ABSTRACT
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 4 
 
 
Title An Open-label,  Phase  II, Multicenter  Study  of Enhancing  Pembrolizumab  
Responses  in Melanoma  through  Intratumoral  pIL-12  Electroporation  
Patient  
population  Patients  with melanoma  with progressive  locally  advanced  or metastatic  
disease  that is not amenable  to definitive  local  therapy  with curative  intent.  
Rationale  for 
Study  Inhibition  of the PD-L1/PD-1  axis with mAbs is transforming  the therapeutic  
landscape  in melanoma,  with objective  response  rates  (ORR)  in the range  of 
20-50%.  Unfortunately,  even  in melanoma,  which  is considered  to be one of 
the most  immunoresponsive  types  of solid tumor,  the majority  of patients  will 
not respond  to monotherapy  with anti-PD-1  agents.  These primary  PD-1  
nonresponders  represent  a significant  unmet  medical  need  that may benefit  
from a combination  therapy  tailored  to the negative  PD-L1 nonresponder  
phenotype.  Combining  the anti-PD-1  agent,  pembrolizumab,  with an agent  
capable  of driving  an effective  T cell response,  such  as IL-12,  may increase  
the immunogenicity  and CTL activity  in the nonresponder  phenotype  and 
enhance  response  to pembrolizumab.  
Primary  
Objective  To assess  the anti-tumor  efficacy  (defined  as the best overall  response  rate 
using  RECIST  v1.1)  of the combination  of intratumoral  pIL-12 EP and 
pembrolizumab  in patients  with melanoma  who are progressing  or have  
progressed  on anti-PD-1  therapy.  
Secondary  
Objectives  To assess  safety  and tolerability  of the combination  of intratumoral  pIL-12 EP 
and pembrolizumab;  duration  of response;  twenty-four  week  landmark  
progression  free survival;  median  progression  free survival;  overall  survival;  
and best overall  objective  response  rate by  immune-related  Response  
Criteria  (irRC)  in melanoma  patients  treated  with the combination  of 
intratumoral  pIL-12  EP and pembrolizumab.  
Study  Design  This is a multi-center,  Phase  II, open  label,  single-arm  trial of intratumoral  pIL- 
12 EP  in combination  with pembrolizumab  in patients  with melanoma.  
Patients  will initiate  treatment  with pembrolizumab  concurrently  with the first 
cycle  of intratumoral  pIL-12  EP. Pembrolizumab  will be administered  at 200 
mg flat dose  every  3 weeks.  Cycles  of intratumoral  pIL-12 EP (each  cycle  
consisting  of treatment  on days  1, 5 and 8) will occur  every  6 weeks  as long  
as patients  have  accessible  lesions  for EP. Patients  will be evaluated  for 
response  every  12 weeks  by RECIST  v1.1.   Patients  will continue  on therapy  
if they have  stable  disease  or better,  defined  under  investigator  evaluation  at 
the time of disease  evaluations.  Therapy  will be given  until  disease  
progression  or unacceptable  toxicity.  The only exception  will be those  patients  
who experience  a confirmed  CR and who have  been  on treatment  for at least  
6 months;  these  patients  may discontinue  treatment  at the investigator’s  
discretion.  Patients  may reinitiate  either  therapy  post- complete  remission  
relapse  if the study  remains  open  and the patient  meets  the conditions  
outlined  in the protocol.  Patients  will be followed  continually  for safety  and 
tolerability  by assessment  of adverse  events.

patients  42 evaluable  patients  
 
 
 
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 5
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
Duration  of 
Therapy  Patients  may continue  treatment  for as long as they continue  to benefit  from 
treatment  for up to 2 years  or until disease  progression;  inter-current  illness  
that prevents  further  administration  of treatment;  unacceptable  adverse  
event(s);  patient  decision  to withdraw  from the study;  significant  patient  non- 
compliance   with  protocol;   general  or  specific  changes in the patients’  
condition  that render  the patient  unacceptable  for further  treatment  in the 
judgment  of the investigator;  or those  who  experience  a confirmed  CR from 
the time of study  entry.  After 24 months,  patients  may continue  study  
treatment  if approved  by the Principal  Investigator,  OncoSec  Medical,  and 
Merck.  Patients  may reinitiate  either  therapy  post-complete  remission  relapse  
if the study  remains  open  and the patient  meets  the conditions  outlined  in the 
protocol.  
Duration  of 
Follow  up After  the end of treatment,  each  subject  will be followed  for 30 days  for 
adverse  event  monitoring  (serious  adverse  events  will be collected  for 90 
days after the end  of treatment  as described  in Section  7). For subjects  who 
discontinue  for r easons  other than progressive  disease,  every  attempt  should  
be made  to continue  monitoring  their  disease  status  by radiologic  imaging.  
Monitoring  should  continue  (1) until start  of a new anti-cancer  treatment,  (2) 
until documented  disease  progression,  or (3) until death,  whichever  occurs  
first. Radiographic  imaging  in follow-up  may be performed  as clinically  
indicated  or per local standard  of care.  Each  subject  will be followed  for 
overall  survival  until death,  withdrawal  of consent,  or the end of the study,  
whichever  occurs  first. 
Duration  of 
study  The study  is expected  to reach  completion  ~24 months  from the time the 
study  opens  to accrual.  However,  the study  duration  will depend  on the rate of 
patient  enrollment.  
Study  Drugs  Each  treatment  cycle  is 3 weeks.  
Plasmid  interleukin-12  (pIL-12)  for i ntratumoral  injection  at ¼ tumor  volume  at 
concentration  of 0.5 mg/mL  followed  by in vivo electroporation  (EP) of six 
pulses  at f ield strengths  (E+) of 1500  V/cm  and pulse  width  of 100 μs at 1- 
second  intervals.  A m inimum  of 0.1 mL pIL-12  per lesion  for lesions  <0.1 cm3 
will be administered.  Intratumoral  pIL-12 EP  will be administered  on Days  1, 5 
and 8 of every  odd cycle  (every  6 weeks).  
Pembrolizumab  is a humanized  mAb  administered  intravenously  at 200 mg 
every  3 weeks.  
Safety  
Assessments  Safety  will be assessed  during  the study  by documentation  of adverse  events  
(AEs),  clinical  laboratory  tests,  physical  examination,  vital sign 
measurements,  and Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group  (ECOG)  
performance  status.  Toxicities  will be defined  and graded  using  NCI CTCAE  
4.0. 
Efficacy  
Assessments  Overall  response  rate (ORR)  will be evaluated  using  RECIST  v1.1  by 
investigator  evaluation  at each  re-staging  assessment  performed  
approximately  every  12 weeks.  An independent  central  review  may also be 
employed  for response  evaluations.  Duration  of response  (DOR),  twenty-four  
week  landmark  progression  free survival  (PFS@24),  median  progression  free 
survival  (PFS),  overall  survival  (OS)  and ORR  evaluated  by immune  related-  
Response  Criteria  (irRC)  will also  be assessed.

1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1  BACKGROUND  ON INDICATION  
Melanoma  is one of the most  dangerous  forms  of skin  cancer  and  one of the seven  most  common  cancers  
in the United  States.   Furthermore,  its incidence  is increasing  [1]. When  melanoma  is caught  early  
enough,  surgical  excision  can be curative  in the majority  of Stage  I and  II melanomas  and the overall  5- 
year  survival  rate  for patients  without  spread  to regional  lymph  nodes  or other  organs  is about  98 
percent  in the United  States  [2]. At later  stages,  malignant  melanoma  remains  a deadly and frequently  
difficult  to treat  cancer.  The  overall  5-year  survival  rate for patients  falls  to 62 percent  when  the disease  
reaches  the lymph  nodes  and 15 percent  when  the disease  metastasizes  to distant  organs  [2]. 
Numerous  chemotherapy  regimens  have  been  tested  in melanoma  with  only modest  success  and limited  
overall survival  benefit.  Targeted  kinase  inhibitors  (TKI)  such  as BRAF  and MEK  signal  transduction  
inhibitors  either  alone  or in combination,  and immunotherapy  agents  such  as the CTLA4  inhibitor  
ipilimumab  are current  first-line  options  in the metastatic  setting,  each  of which  have  proven  benefits.  
While  BRAF  and/or  MEK  inhibitors  are very  effective  in terms  of producing  initial  responses  for 
approximately  50%  of biomarker-positive  patients,  most  patients  will progress  within  6 months  and few 
patients  have  lasting  responses  [33].  Furthermore,  the variable  mechanisms  of resistance  to TKIs  have  
limited  the determination  of effective  sequenced  treatment  algorithms.  Early  immunotherapy  agents  
such  as interferon  and high-dose  IL-2  were  of limited  efficacy  in the metastatic  setting  and had extensive  
toxicity  limiting  their  overall  applicability  and long-term  use.  While  immunotherapy  can be extremely  
effective  it is not able  to halt  the very  aggressive  disease  that  is commonplace  in melanoma  and does  not 
benefit  the majority  of patients.  
The importance  of intact  immune  surveillance  along  with  evidence  demonstrating  a correlation  between  
tumor  infiltrating  lymphocytes  (TILs)  and  favorable  prognosis  support  continued  efforts  to focus  on 
targeting  pathways  of T cell activation  [34].  One  major  pathway  emerging  as a target  for immunotherapy  
is the PD-1/PD-L1  axis  due to the inhibition  of T cell activation  that  is triggered  through  the T cell 
receptor  upon  binding  of the PD-1  ligands  (PD-L1  and  PD-L2)  to PD-1 3. Inhibition  of the PD-1/PD-L1  axis  
by monoclonal  antibodies  (mAbs)  continues  to be investigated  as it plays  a critical  role  in tumor  immune  
evasion.  Additionally,  the presence  of CD8+ T cells  and the ratio of CD8+  effector  T cells/FoxP3+  
regulatory  T cells  seems  to correlate  with  improved  prognosis  and long-term  survival  in solid  
malignancies  such  as melanoma 5,6; thus  enhancing  T cell  response  and  increasing  immunogenicity  
continue  to be of therapeutic  importance  in treating  solid  tumors.  
 
1.2  BACKGROUND  ON THE COMPOUNDS  
Preclinical  in vitro  and  in vivo  experiments  have  shown  that  PD-1  and/or  PD-L1  blockade  using  
monoclonal  antibodies  (mAb)  enhances  tumor-cell  specific  activation,  cytokine  production,  anti- tumor  
effector  mechanisms,  and  clearance  of tumor  cells  by the immune  system  [7-12].  
Murine  pre-clinical  studies  have  shown  that  administration  of antibodies  blocking  PD-1/PD-L1  
interaction  enhances  infiltration  of tumor-specific  CD8+ T cells  and leads  ultimately  to tumor  rejection.  
The presence  of IFN-γ, granzyme  B, and  perforin  upon  blockade  of the PD-1  pathway  indicate  local  
infiltration  and activation  of effector  T cell function  in vivo  [8-10, 11,13,14].

Pembrolizumab  is a potent  and highly  selective  humanized  mAb  of the IgG4/kappa  isotype  designed  to 
directly  block  the interaction  between PD-1  and  its ligands,  PD-L1  and  PD-L2.  Pembrolizumab  contains  
the S228P  stabilizing  mutation  and has no antibody-dependent  cell-  mediated   cytotoxicity  (ADCC)  or 
complement-dependent  cytotoxicity  (CDC)  activity.  
Pembrolizumab  modulates  the level  of interleukin-2  (IL-2),  tumor  necrosis  factor  alpha  (TNFα), 
interferon  gamma  (IFN- Υ), and  other  cytokines.  The antibody  potentiates  existing  immune  responses  
only in the presence  of antigen  and does  not nonspecifically  activate  T cells.  Pembrolizumab  strongly  
enhances  T lymphocyte  immune  responses  in cultured  blood  cells  from  healthy  human  donors,  cancer  
patients,  and  primates.  In T cell stimulation  assays  using  human  donor  blood  cells,  the EC50  was  in the 
range  of 0.1 to  0.3 nM (see  pembrolizumab  Investigator  Brochure).  
Pembrolizumab  is currently  undergoing  Phase  III testing  in advanced  melanoma  and  lung  populations.  
Data  from  the Phase  I/II melanoma  trials  demonstrate  a high  rate of sustained  tumor  regression,  with  
mainly  grade  1 or grade  2 toxic  effects 15. The functional  activity  of pembrolizumab  measured  in an ex   
vivo  SEB-induced  IL-2  production  assay  (modulation  assay)  in whole  blood  samples  from  2 cynomolgus  
monkey  studies  was  used  to determine  the starting  dose in the Phase  I dose  escalation  study.  Increased  
production  of cytokines  such  as IL-2  have been  generally  regarded  as a marker  of potential  anti-tumor  
immune  activity  and blocking  PD-1  was  found to increase  this  IL-2 response.  The ex vivo  IL-2  modulation  
assay  data  indicated  a potency  (EC50) of app roximately  15 μg/mL  (90%  CI, 5-36 μg/mL)  for 
pembrolizumab.  Simulations  based  on allometrically  scaled  cynomolgus  monkey  PK parameters  
suggested  that  the target  EC50 concentration  of 15 μg/mL  should  be readily  attained  as trough  levels  at 
steady-  state  following  IV dosing  of 1 mg/kg  pembrolizumab  every  2 weeks.  A 10 mg/kg  every  2 weeks  
dose represents  a 40-fold  dose multiple  over  the no observed  adverse  effect  level  (NOAEL),  see 
pembrolizumab  Investigator’s  Brochure  for more detail.  The extended  Phase  I study tested  2 mg/kg  and 
10 mg/kg  administration  at either  every  2 or every  3 weeks.  Additional  PK, safety,  and efficacy  analysis  of 
completed  and  ongoing  multi-dose  trials  (1 - 10mg/kg  range)  has determined  a flat dose  of 200 mg    
Q3W  corresponding  to 2.5 to  3 mg/kg  is to be used  for all new  studies.  This  dose used  in the  expanded  
access   program   ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  for melanoma  patients  who  relapsed  on ipilimumab  was  set at 2 
mg/kg.  
Publication  of the multi-dose  pembrolizumab  monotherapy  trial  demonstrated  the confirmed  response  
rate  by RECIST  v1.1  in 117 patients  with  advanced  melanoma  to be 38% (95%  confidence  interval  [CI],  
25 to 44), with  the highest  confirmed  response  rate  observed  in the cohort  that  received  10 mg/kg  every  
2 weeks  (52%,  95%  CI, 38 to 66). The response  rate did not differ  significantly  between  patients  who  had  
received  prior  ipilimumab  treatments  and those  who  had not.  Responses  were  durable  in the majority  of 
patients  (median  follow-up,  11 months  among  patients  who  had  a response)  and the overall median  
progression-free  survival  among 135 patients  was  longer  than  7 months  [15].  
Of the 135 patients  assessed  in the 2013  publication  of the Phase  I trial,  generalized  symptoms  including  
fatigue  and  asthenia,  fever  and chills,  myalgias,  and headaches  were  reported  frequently  but were  of low  
grade.  Rashes  and pruritus  were  reported  in 21%  of the patients;  grade  3 or 4 pruritus  was  reported  in 
1% of the patients,  and  grade  3 or 4 rash  in 2%. Treatment-related  pneumonitis  was  reported  in 4% of 
the patients.  Grade  3 or 4 elevations  of aminotransferase  levels  were  reported  in 1% of the patients.  Two  
cases  of grade  3 renal  failure  were  reported.  Diarrhea  was  reported  in 20% of the patients,  with  a single  
case  of grade  3 treatment-related  diarrhea.  Grade  3 hyperthyroidism   and  grade  2 adrenal  
insufficiency  developed  in one patient.  No other  endocrinopathies  were  recorded 15. Measures  of efficacy

and safety resulting  from  this Phase  I trial  support  administration  of pembrolizumab  in patients  with  
advanced  melanoma  to achieve  tumor  regression  without  significant  safety  issues.  
Intratumoral  plasmid  interleukin-12  (pIL-12)  administered  by in vivo  electroporation  (EP)  will be added  
to the treatment  regimen  of melanoma  in this trial.  Interleukin-12  (IL-12)  is a 70 kilodalton  protein  
consisting  of two  subunits  linked  by a disulfide  bond  [36].  It is a potent  pleotropic  cytokine,  capable  of 
driving  cell-mediated  immunity  through  multiple  parallel  mechanisms,  including  activation  of NK cells  
and cytotoxic  T lymphocytes  (CTLs)  as well  as inhibition  of regulatory  T cells  and myeloid-derived  
suppressor  cells  (MDSCs)[35-37]  . Also,  as a potent  inducer  of interferon-gamma  (IFN-γ), IL-12  can drive  
upregulation  of antigen  processing  and presentation  machinery  (APM)  within  tumors.  
IL-12  has  undergone  pre-clinical  testing  against  various  tumors  in mice,  administered  as a recombinant  
protein  therapy  and by plasmid  encoding  IL-12  gene  therapy.  Comparative  studies  showed  IL-12  gene  
therapy  to be as efficient  as IL-12  protein  therapy  with  far less toxic  side  effects  [16].  Delivery  of IL-12  by 
gene  therapy  has  been  tested  for antitumor  effects  and safety  in the poorly  immunogenic  and metastatic  
B16  murine  melanoma  model.  Intratumoral  injection  of pIL-12  and  intratumoral  injection  followed  by EP 
have  demonstrated  antitumor  effect  and far less toxicity  than  other  methods  of gene  therapy  delivery.  
Administration  of intratumoral  pIL-12  followed  by EP results  in significant  growth  delay  when  
administered  as one treatment[17]  with  complete  tumor  regression  achievable  in two and three  
treatment  protocols 18,19. EP is a physical  method  of delivery  of compounds  to tissues  in vivo  and  was  first  
reported to transfect  cells  in vivo  with  plasmid  DNA  in 1991 when  reporter gene  expression  was  seen  in 
skin  cells  of mice 20. In a study  conducted  by Lucas  et al. in 2002, mice  receiving  intratumoral  pIL-12  (50  
μg, 1μg/μL) followed by  application  of six 100 μs pulses  with  field  strength  of 1500 V/cm  EP on day 0 
and day 7 slowed  tumor  growth,  with  47%  (8/17)  showing  complete  regression  of tumors.  All mice  
experienced  prolonged  survival.  Seven  of the animals  that  showed  complete  regression  and remained  
disease-free  for 50 days  were  challenged  with  B16.F10  tumor  cells,  and  5 were  resistant  to tumor  
growth.  Serum  levels  of IL-12  and  IFN-γ were  not significantly  greater  than  expression  in mice  that  
received  no treatment  (P > 0.05). Infiltration  of CD4+  and  CD8+  T cells  was  seen  in tumors  five days  after  
pIL-12  EP. 
In a follow  up experiment  comparing  a two-treatment  versus  three-treatment  protocol,  three  treatments  
(days  0, 4 and  7) under  similar  treatment  conditions  resulted  in an 80% cure  rate  with  mice  free  of 
tumors  for >100 days,  statistically  significant  (p<0.05)  over the 60%  (9 out of 15 mice)  survival  rate 
resulting  from  the two-treatment  protocol.  When  challenged  with  B16.F10  cells,  all 12 (100%)  of the 
disease  free mice  in the three-treatment  groups  were  resistant,  and  eight  out of nine  mice  (88.9%)  in the 
two-treatment  group  were  resistant  suggesting  the development  of  an immune  memory  response.  
These  treatment  protocols   were   further  examined  in multiple  tumor  and  metastatic  models.  In 
addition,  no toxicity  or adverse  reactions  were  noted  in the treated  mice.  
To fully  characterize  the potential  toxicity  following  pIL-12  EP, C57B1/6  mice  with  established  B16.F10  
melanoma  tumors  were  treated  on the three-treatment  protocol  and  evaluated  for weight  change,  tumor  
response,  blood  chemistry  and hematology  values,  serum  IL-12  levels  and histopathologic  analysis  of 
multiple  tissues.  Two different  concentrations  (0.1  μg/μL and 1 μg/μL) of intratumoral  injection  of pIL- 
12 (50  μL) with  and  without  EP were assessed.  Focal  inflammation  of the kidney  and focal 
glomerusclerosis  at later  time  points  were the  abnormal  findings  seen at the higher  dose.  Symptoms  
associated  with  systemic  spillage  of IL-12  and  corresponding  increased  expression  of IFN-ϒ, such  as

weight  loss  and splenomegaly  were  not observed.  No significant  serum  protein  IL-12  levels  were  seen in 
any group  [21].  
Intratumoral  injection  of pIL-12  followed  by in vivo  EP is currently  under  investigation  in a multi-  center  
Phase  II trial.  A Phase  I trial  was  conducted  involving  seven  dosing  cohorts  with  a total  of 24 patients.  
Patients  received  one  cycle  consisting  of three  days  of treatment.  Maximum  total  plasmid  injected  per 
visit  ranged  from  0.2-6  mg, at concentrations  ranging  from 0.1-1.6  mg/mL.  A dose proportional  increase  
in IL-12  protein  expression  compared  to pretreatment  in biopsied  tumors  was  seen  in all patients  with   
no significant  IL-12  spillage  into  circulation.  Most  (76%) electroporated  lesions  demonstrated  greater  
than  20% necrosis  at the time  of follow-up  biopsy  or excision  performed  between  3 and 31 days  after  the 
last injection.  Four  of 19 patients  who  had  distant  disease  had  evidence  of distant  responses  including  3 
complete  responses  in patients  with  progressive  metastatic  disease.  Of these  patients,  2 patients  had not 
had any subsequent  systemic  therapy  while  1 patient  had received  dacarbazine  following  pIL-12   
therapy.  All three  complete  responses  occurred  in the setting  of patients  with  disseminated  progressive  
cutaneous  lesions.  No dose  related  or treatment  related  toxicity  was  seen  except  for transient  pain  and 
discomfort  at the injection  site [22].  
Results  from  the Phase  I study  led to the ongoing  Phase  II testing  of intratumoral  pIL-12  (0.5  mg/mL)  EP 
in 30 patients  principally  with  in-transit  cutaneous  and subcutaneous  metastatic  melanoma  or M1a  
melanoma  and few patients  with  M1b  and M1c.  In this trial,  one  treatment  cycle  consists  of three  
treatment  days  (days  1, 5 and 8) at 12-week  intervals.  Interim  data  from  21 patients  in the Phase  II trial,  
reported 8 of 21 patients  (38%) exhibited  an objective  response  and 11 of 18 patients  with  evaluable  
lesions  (61%)  experienced  regression  of non-injected  lesions.  Transient  pain  and inflammation  at the 
treatment  site were  the most  common  grade  1/2 drug-related  adverse  events  (AEs),  with  no grade  3/4 
drug-related  AEs[23].   I 
n the main  (1-year)  portion  of a Phase  2 study  (OMS-I100)  to assess  safety,  tolerability,  and  explore  the 
anti-tumor  activity  of IT-pIL12-EP  monotherapy  in patients  with  melanoma,  the overall  response  rate  
(ORR)  by modified  “skin”  Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in Solid  Tumors  (RECIST)  in 23 evaluable  patients  
was  34.8%  (8/23),  with  17.4%  (4/23)  of patients  achieving  a complete  response  (CR).  The disease  
control  rate (DCR  = CR + partial  response  [PR]  + stable  disease  [SD])  was  65.2%  (15/23).  Major              
(i.e., ≥ 30%)  regression  of at least  1 local  lesion  was  seen in 64.0%  (16/25)  of patients.  Twenty-two  
patients  had at least  one anatomically  distinct  lesion  that  was  left untreated  (i.e.,  non-injected,  non-EP)  in 
order  to evaluate  for an abscopal  effect.  Major  (i.e.,  ≥30%) regres sion  of at least  one untreated  lesion  was  
observed  in 31.8%  (7/22)  of patients.  Further  in the addendum  cohort,  overall  response  rate (ORR)  by 
modified  “skin”  Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in Solid  Tumors  (RECIST)  in 15 evaluable patients  was  
40% (6/15),  with  all 6 patients  achieving  a partial  response  (PR).  The  disease  control  rate  (DCR  = CR  + 
partial  response  [PR]  + stable  disease  [SD])  was  53.3%  (8/15).  Major  (i.e.,  ≥30%)  regression  of at least  1 
local  lesion  was  seen  in 44.4%  (8/20)  of patients.  Twenty  patients  had at least  one anatomically  distinct  
lesion  that  was  left untreated  (i.e.,  non-injected,  non-EP)  in order  to evaluate  for an abscopal  effect.  
Major  (i.e.,  ≥30%)  regression  of at least  one untreated  lesion  was  observed  in 20% (5/20) of patients.  
Overall,  safety  data  with  IT-pIL12-EP  are available  from  118 patients  with  malignancies,  of whom  96 
received  IT-pIL12-EP  as monotherapy  (i.e.,  monotherapy  patients)  and 22 received  IT-pIL12-EP  in 
combination  with  pembrolizumab  (i.e.,  combination  patients).

Overall,  IT-pIL12-EP  was  well  tolerated  as monotherapy.  The  only  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  
(TEAEs)  occurring  at an incidence  ≥ 10%  among  patients  treated  with  IT-pIL12-EP  as monotherapy  
were  related  to the treatment  administration  procedure,  including  procedural  pain  (55.2%),  injection  
site inflammation  (14.6%),  and  injection  site discoloration  (11.5%),  as well  as fatigue  (12.5%).  For most  
patients  who  experienced  these  events,  the events  were  assessed  by the Investigator  as study  drug- or  
procedurally-related.  No patient  treated  with  IT-pIL12-EP  monotherapy  experienced  a serious  adverse  
reaction  (SAR) (i.e.,  a study  drug-related  serious  adverse  event  [SAE]).  
1.3  RATIONALE  FOR  THE  PROPOSED  STUDY  
Inhibition  of the PD-L1/PD-1  axis  with  mAbs  is transforming  the therapeutic  landscape  in melanoma,  
with  objective  response  rates  (ORR)  in the range  of 20-50%. Unfortunately,  even  in melanoma,  which  is 
considered  to be one  of the most  immunoresponsive  types  of solid  tumor,  the majority  of patients  will 
not respond  to monotherapy  with  anti-PD-1  agents.  These  primary  PD-1-nonresponders  represent  a 
significant  unmet  medical  need  that  may  benefit  from  a combination  therapy  tailored  to the PD-1-  
nonresponder  phenotype  to convert  them  to a PD-1-  responder  population.  
PD-1  was  shown  to be expressed  on activated  lymphocytes  including  peripheral  CD4+  and  CD8+  T-cells,  
B cells,  T regs  and Natural  Killer  (NK)  cells  [24,25].  Expression  has also  been  shown  during  thymic  
development  on CD4-CD8-  (double negative)  T-cells  as well  as subsets  of macrophages  and dendritic  
cells  [26].  The  ligands  for PD-1  (PDL-1  and  PD-L2)  are constitutively  expressed  or can be induced  in a 
variety  of cell types  and various  tumors  [4, 29-31].  Patients  with  a brisk  CD8+PD-1+  TIL population,  
usually  seen  in distinct  clusters  in association  with  PD-L1+ cells,  often  have  a high  probability  of response  
to anti-PD-1  monotherapy.  These  patients  benefit  from  a strong  endogenous  antitumor  response,    
leading  to the generation  of cytotoxic  T lymphocytes.  On the other  hand,  the absence  of significant  
numbers  of TILs  in melanoma  is highly  correlated  with  the lack  of response  to PD-1  therapy 27. Combining  
the anti-PD-1  agent,  pembrolizumab,  with  an agent  capable  of driving  an effective  T cell response,        
such  as IL-12,  may  increase  the immunogenicity  in the nonresponder  phenotype  and enhance  response  
to pembrolizumab.  
Intratumoral  injection  of pIL-12  alone  has demonstrated  reduced  tumor  volume  along  with  peritumoral  
and intratumoral  infiltrates  of CD4+ and  CD8+ in the  poorly  immunogenic  and anti-  PD1 refractory  
B16.F10  mouse  melanoma  model 28. The  addition  of EP to mediate  gene  delivery  supports  conversion  of 
the low  TIL/non-immunogenic  mouse  model  into  an immunogenic  one,  as evidenced  by tumor  
regression  associated  with  CD4+ and CD8+  infiltrates  and rejection  of subsequent  tumor  grafts18,19. The  
dose proportional  increase  in IL-12  protein  expression  and tumor  levels  of IFN-ϒ seen in the Phase  I trial  
further demonstrate  intratumoral  changes  post  treatment.  Emerging  Phase  II data  indicate  a doubling  of 
intratumoral  NK cells  from  pre- treatment  through  day 11 and  at day  39, and  increased  frequency  in 
activated  circulating  NK cells  [23].  
This  trial  will  assess  whether  response  to pembrolizumab  in a preselected  population  of patients  
determined  to have  low  TILmelanoma  can  improve  overall response  rates  when  treated  in combination  
with  intratumoral  pIL-12  EP. Patients  in part  A will be selected  based  on their  TIL status  and patients  in 
part  B will be enrolled  if they  are progressing  on PD-1  therapy.Tissue  biopsies  of all patients  will be 
collected  prior  to enrollment  to assess  for study  eligibility.  Patients  in part  A will be selected  based  on a 
flow cytometric  assay,  quantifying  intratumoral  PD-1 hiCD8 +CTLA4 + “exhausted”  lymphocytes  developed  
by investigators  at UCSF[43].  The purpose  of this  patient  pre-selection  is to enrich  the study  population  
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852

for patients,  who  would  be unlikely  to respond  to pembrolizumab  as a monotherapy.  Patients  in part  B 
will be eligible  if they  have  received  >/= 12  weeks  of an anti-PD-1  therapy  and have  shown  progression  
by RECIST  by radiological  confirmation  or if cutaneous  and subcutaneous  lesions  have  enlarged  or new  
lesions  appeared.  
This  multi-center,  open-label,  single  arm  trial  will  evaluate  in total  42 patients,  comparing  objective  
response  rates  with  the combination  of pIL-12  EP + pembrolizumab  versus  pembrolizumab  historical  
control  rates.  
Each  treatment  cycle  is 3 weeks.  Patients  will initiate  treatment  of pembrolizumab  concurrently  with  the 
first cycle  of intratumoral  (IT) pIL-12  EP. Pembrolizumab  will be administered  at 200 mg once  per  
treatment  cycle  (i.e.,  every  3 weeks).  IT pIL-12  EP will be administered  on days  1, 5 and 8 every 6 weeks  
(i.e., every  odd cycle)  as long  as patients  have  accessible  lesions  for EP. Patients  will be evaluated  for 
objective  response  approximately  every  12 weeks  using  RECIST  v1.1  by investigator  evaluation  and will 
continue  on therapy  if they  have  stable  disease  or better  at the time  of disease  evaluations.  An 
independent  central  review  may  also  be employed  for response  evaluations.  Therapy  will be given  until  
disease  progression  or unacceptable  toxicity  for up to two  years. The only  exception  will be those  
patients  who  experience  a confirmed  CR; these  patients  may discontinue  treatment  at the investigator’s  
discretion.  Patients  may  reinitiate  either  therapy  post-complete  remission  relapse  if the  study  remains  
open and the patient  meets  the conditions  outlined  in the protocol.  Patients  will be followed  continually  
for safety  and tolerability  by assessment  of adverse  events.  
 
1.4  CORRELATIVE  STUDIES  
1.4.1 BIOMARKERS  
The primary  biomarker  objective  is to assess  the relationship  between  PD-L1 expression,  TIL profile  
(IHC and  gene  expression),  and  anti-tumor  activity  of pIL-12  EP + pembrolizumab  in patients.  
Investigators  at UCSF  have  found  that  patients  with  a subset  of “exhausted”  TIL expressing  PD- 
1hiCD8+CTLA4+,  demonstrate  a diminished  response  rate to checkpoint  blockade  therapy[43].  
It is hypothesized  that  treatment  with  IT pIL-12  EP will increase  TIL  expression  and,  therefore,  increase  
the likelihood  of tumor  regression  and response  to pembrolizumab.  
Response  rates  from  the combination  of IT pIL-12  EP plus  pembrolizumab  will be stratified  by TIL status  
and PD-L1  IHC  expression  to insure  that  the study  population  is comparable  to the historical  control  
population  treated  with  pembrolizumab  as a monotherapy.  The TIL/  PD-L1 status  of the selected  
population  will be confirmed  retrospectively  using  at least  one of the following  assays:  the PD-L1 IHC 
assay  (clone  22C3)  developed  by Merck  and  by quantitative  CD8  T cell density  [42].  
Other  candidate  biomarkers  which  will  be investigated  in the study  may  include,  but are not limited  to, 
the following:  
 RNA  and DNA profiling  in biopsy  tissue  
 Multispectral  fluorescent  immunohistochemistry  from  immune  subsets  in biopsy  tissue  
 Quantitative  RNA  expression  of candidate  genes  of interest  
 Cytokine/chemokine  profiles  in peripheral  blood  
 Antigen  specific  cellular  and  humoral  immune  profiles  in peripheral  blood

1.4.2 FUTURE  BIOMEDICAL  RESEARCH  
Future  biomedical  research  on blood  and leftover  tumor  biopsy  specimens  will be performed  on 
collected  samples  during  this clinical  trial.  This  research  may  include  genetic  analyses  (DNA),  gene  
expression  profiling  (RNA),  proteomics,  metabolomics  (serum,  plasma)  and/or  the measurement  of 
other  analytes.  This  research  is for biomarker  testing  to address  emergent  questions  not described  
elsewhere  in the protocol  (as part  of the main  biomarker  correlative  objectives).  The objective  is to 
explore  and  identify  biomarkers  that  inform  scientific  understanding  of this  therapeutic  treatment  and 
tumor  biology  responses  to IT pIL-12  EP. Such  retrospective  studies  will be conducted  with  appropriate  
statistical  considerations  and evaluation  of results  as described  in Section  8. Tissue  and  blood  samples  
will be collected  at the time  points  described  in Section  6 (Study  Procedures  and Observations).

2.4  ENDPOINTS  
2.4.1 PRIMARY  ENDPOINTS  
Best  overall  objective  response  rate (ORR),  CR + PR, within  24 weeks  of first  treatment  with  pIL-12  EP 
and pembrolizumab  will be determined  using  RECIST  v1.1  by investigator  evaluation  and compared  
against  historical  rates  for pembrolizumab  as a monotherapy  in a similar  population.  An independent  
central  review  may  also  be employed  for response  evaluations.  The  response  rate  of patients   in part  A 
with  low TIL status  on the screening  flow cytometric  assay  is estimated  at 12.5%  based  on the assay's  
false  negative  rate  in this population  and  the rate  of pseudoprogression  by RECIST  of patients  is part  B is 
the same.  . 
2.4.2 SECONDARY  ENDPOINTS  
Safety  and tolerability  is defined  by assessment  of adverse  events.  These  will  be assessed  using  the NCI  
CTCAE  version  4.0. 
Duration  of response  (DOR)  for those  experiencing  CR or PR is the number  of days  from  the initial  
documentation  of an objective  response  to the most  current  evaluation  of that  response  (censored  
duration)  or to documentation  of progression.  
 
 
Twenty-four  week  landmark  progression  free survival  (PFS  at 24) is defined  as the percentage  of 
patients,  who  have  progressed  at the 24 week  time  point.  
Progression  free survival  (PFS)  is defined  as the duration  between  the date  of treatment  initiation  to the 
first date  of either  disease  progression  or death.  
Overall  survival  (OS)  is defined  as the duration  between  the date of treatment  initiation  to the date of 
death,  regardless  of the cause  of death.  
Best  overall  objective  response  rate,  CR + PR, is determined  by immune  related-Response  Criteria  (irRC).  
2.4.3 EXPLORATORY  ENDPOINTS  
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 20 
 
Co-primary  candidate  biomarkers  to be investigated  in this study  include  PD-L1 expression  levels  
assessed  by IHC,  and  TIL profile  assessed  by CD8 T cell density  in tumor  tissue.  
Changes  in PD-L1 expression  will be assessed  pre-  and  post-treatment  using  one or both  of the following  
immunohistochemical  evaluations:  
(1) the Merck  developed  PD-L1 IHC  assay  (clone22C3)  with  a stringent  cut-off  of <1%  in tumor  or 
stromal  cells  of the tumor  environment.  
(2) an assay  developed  by Tumeh/UCLA[42]  is now  being  managed  at the Rosenblum  lab at UCSF  with  a 
low TIL cut-off  of <600 CD8  cells/mm 2. If tumor  samples  demonstrate  that  the combination  therapy  
converts  tumors  from  low TIL to high  TIL  but without  a corresponding  increase  in ORR,  then  the 
hypothesis  that  enhancing  TILs  will increase  pembrolizumab  efficacy  can be rejected.  Changes  in other  
biomarkers  and immune  responses  in tissue  and  blood  will  be assessed  for association  with  clinical  
outcome  (efficacy  endpoints).  
 
 
3 STUDY  DESIGN  
3.1  CHARACTERISTICS  
This  is a multi-center,  Phase  II, open label,  single-arm  trial  of intratumoral  pIL-12  EP in combination  with  
pembrolizumab  in patients  with  melanoma.  The  best  overall objective  response  rate  of the combination  
will be compared  to negative  PD-L1 historical  rates  for pembrolizumab  as a monotherapy.  Patients  will 
be evaluated in 2 parts.  Part  A patients  will be selected  using  a flow cytometric  assay  that  quantifies  
intratumoral  PD-1 hiCD8 +CTLA4 + “exhausted”  lymphocytes  in the tumor.  Part B will enroll  patients  who  
have  or are failing  pembrolizumab  at least  12 weeks  after  starting  PD-1  Antibody  alone  or in 
combination.  The  study  will assess  post-treatment  increase  of immunogenicity  in melanomas  and the 
enhancement  of pembrolizumab  responses  in this population.  
 
3.2  NUMBER  OF SUBJECTS  
This  trial  is planned  for 42 evaluable  patients.  Patients  will  be evaluated  in 2 parts.  Part  A (22  patients)  
will be selected  using  a flow  cytometric  assay  that  quantifies  intratumoral  PD-1hiCD8+CTLA4+  
“exhausted”  lymphocytes  in the tumor.  Part  B will enroll  20 patients  who  have  or are failing  
pembrolizumab  at least  12 weeks  after  starting  PD-1  antibody  alone  or in combination,  or, who  have  
been  selected  using  a flow cytometric  assay  that  quantifies  intratumoral  PD-1hiCD8+CTLA4+  
“exhausted”  lymphocytes  in the tumor.  
 
3.3  ELIGIBILITY  CRITERIA  
Patients  must  have  baseline  evaluations  performed  prior  to the first  dose  of study  drug  and must  meet  
all inclusion  and exclusion  criteria.   Patients  are intended  to have an untreated  lesion  when  there  are 3 
or more  visible,  treatable  lesions  present.  In addition,  the patient  must  be thoroughly  informed  about  all 
aspects  of the study,  including  the study  visit  schedule  and required  evaluations  and  all regulatory  
requirements  for informed  consent.  The written  informed  consent  must  be obtained  from  the patient  
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 21 
 
prior  to enrollment.  The following  criteria  apply  to all patients  enrolled  onto  the study  unless  otherwise  
specified.  
 
 
3.3.1 INCLUSION  CRITERIA

who  have received  ipilimumab,  which  must  be stopped  6 weeks  prior  to first  dose of study  treatment.  
Patients  are prohibited  from  receiving  live vaccines  within  30 days  prior  to first  dose  of study  treatment.  
4. Age ≥ 18 years  
5. Part A: Patient  has agreed  to two  newly  obtained  tumor  biopsies  and as required  re-biopsies  (that  can

Analysis  of one  of the fresh  biopsy  samples  for PD-1 hiCD8 +CTLA4hi  in the CD8+CD45 +   gate  based  on flow 
cytometry  will be done.  A second  fresh  biopsy  sample  is required  for further  biomarker  analysis  and 
confirmation  at a later  date  of low  PD-L1  expression  using  an IHC assay  for PD-L1  expression.  A valid  
flow cytometry  result  is not required  for study  participation,  but repeated  biopsy  for reanalysis  is 
strongly  recommended  for patient  with  insufficient  TILs  in the first  tissue  sample.  
Or 
Part B: Anti-PD-1  non-responders  are defined  as those  showing  disease  progression  according  to RECIST  
v1.1  after  at least  12 weeks  of therapy  with  a PD-1  antibody  either  alone  or in combination  with  
approved  checkpoint  inhibitor  or targeted  therapies  according  to their  label.  There  is no serological

9. Female  patient  of childbearing  potential  has  a negative  serum  or urine  pregnancy  test within  14 days  
prior  to administration  of study  therapy.  
10. The effects  of pIL-12  EP and pembrolizumab  on the developing  human  fetus   are  unknown.  For 
this reason  women  of child-bearing  potential  (not  free  from  menses  for >2 years,  post  
hysterectomy/oophorectomy,  or surgically  sterilized)  must  agree  to use two  methods  of contraception,   
or abstain  from  heterosexual  activity,  during  participation  in study,  from the time  of consent  through  120

Barrier  methods  are diaphragms,  cervical  caps,  cervical  shields,  male  condoms,  and  female  condoms.  The 
second  method  of contraception  may  be another  barrier  method,  a copper  containing  IUD,  spermicidal  
foams,  sponges  and films,  or hormone-based  contraception  (for example,  hormone  pills,  hormone  rings,  
hormone  patches,  hormone-releasing  IUDs,  or Depo  Provera).  Men  with  partners  who  are capable  of 
getting  pregnant  must agree  to use  one  of the barrier  methods  of contraception  listed  above  during  
participation  in the study,  starting  with  the first  dose  of study  drug  through  120  days  after  the last  dose  of 
study  therapy.  Should  a woman  become  pregnant  or suspect  she is pregnant  while  she or  her partner  is 
participating  in this study,  she should  inform  her treating  physician  immediately.

but potential  risk  for adverse  events  in nursing  infants  secondary  to treatment  of the mother  with  pIL-12  
EP + pembrolizumab  breastfeeding  should  be discontinued  if the mother  is treated  with  pIL-12  EP + 
pembrolizumab.  
13. Patients  with  symptomatic  ascites  or pleural  effusion.  A patient  who  is clinically  stable  following  
treatment  for these  conditions  is eligible.  
14. Patient  is HCV  Ab positive  or HBSAg  positive  
 
 
3.4  DURATION  OF THERAPY  
Subjects  may  withdraw  consent  at any  time  for any  reason or be dropped  from  the trial  at the discretion  
of the Investigator  should  any untoward  effect  occur.  In addition,  a subject  may  be withdrawn  by the 
Investigator  or the Sponsor-Principal  Investigator  if enrollment  into the trial  is inappropriate,  the trial  
plan  is violated,  or for administrative  and/or  other  safety reasons.  
In the absence  of treatment  delays due  to adverse  events,  treatment  may  continue  as long  as the patient  
continues  to benefit  from  the treatment  or until:  
• The subject  or legal  representative  withdraws  consent  
• Confirmed  radiographic  disease  progression  
o Note:  For unconfirmed  radiographic   disease   progression,  patients   should  
continue  treatment  at the discretion  of the Investigator  
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 24 
 
o Note:  A subject  may  be granted  an exception  to continue  on treatment  with  
confirmed  radiographic  progression  if clinically  stable  or clinically  improved.  
• Inter-current  illness  that  prevents  further  administration  of treatment  
• The subject  has a confirmed  positive  serum  or urine  pregnancy  test 
• Unacceptable  adverse  event(s)  
• Subject  decides  to withdraw  from the study  
• Significant  patient  non-compliance  with  protocol  
• Subject  was  lost to follow-up  
• General  or specific  changes  in the patients’  condition  render  the patient  unacceptable  for 
further treatment  in the judgment  of the Investigator.  
• Patients  who  have  a confirmed  complete  response  by two scans ≥4 weeks  apart  and who  
have  been  on treatment  for at least  6 months  may  discontinue  pembrolizumab  treatment  at the 
discretion  of the Investigator  after  receiving  at least  two doses  beyond  the initial  determination  
of CR. Patients  may  enter  retreatment  for post-complete  remission  relapse  ONLY  if they  meet 
defined criteria  (see  Section  5.1.2). 
• Completed  24 months  of study  treatment  
Note:  24 months  of study  medication  is calculated  as the interval  from  the date  of first  dose  
regardless  of missed  or skipped  treatment.  After  24 months,  subjects  may  continue  study  treatment  
if approved  by the Principal  Investigator,  OncoSec  Medical,  and Merck.  Subjects  who stop  study  
treatment  after  24 months  may  be eligible for up to one  year  of additional  study  treatment  if they  
progress  after  stopping  study  treatment  provided  they  meet  the requirements  detailed  in Section  
5.1.2.  
• Administrative  reasons  
 
 
3.5  DURATION  OF FOLLOW  UP 
The Safety  Follow-up  visit  procedures  are listed  in Section  6 (Study  Procedures  and Observations).  After  
the end of treatment,  each  subject  will be followed  for 30 days  for adverse  event  monitoring  (serious  
adverse  events  will  be collected  for 90 days  after  the end  of treatment  as described  in Section  7.6).  For 
subjects  who  discontinue  for reasons  other  than  progressive  disease,  every  attempt  should  be made  to 
continue  monitoring  their  disease  status  by radiologic  imaging.  Monitoring  should  continue  (1) until  start  
of a new  anti-cancer  treatment,  (2) until  documented  disease  progression,  or (3) until  death,       
whichever  occurs  first.  Radiographic  imaging  in follow-up  may  be performed  as clinically  indicated  or 
per local  standard  of care . Each  subject  will be followed  for overall  survival  collecting  data  on subsequent  
treatments  and responses  where  possible,  until  death,  withdrawal  of consent,  or the end of the study,  
whichever  occurs  first.

4 STUDY  DRUGS  
4.1  DESCRIPTION , SUPPLY  AND  STORAGE  OF INVESTIGATIONAL  DRUGS  
The Investigator  shall  take  responsibility  for and  shall  take  all steps  to maintain  appropriate  records  and 
ensure appropriate  supply,  storage,  handling,  distribution  and usage  of investigational  product  in 
accordance  with  the protocol  and  any applicable  laws  and  regulations.  
 
 
4.1.1 PLASMID  INTERLEUKIN -12 (PIL-12)  
Classification  
DNA plasmid  vector  (pUMVC3-hIL-12- NGVL331,  referred  to as “pIL -12”),  expressing  IL-12  gene,  
contains  the human  IL-12  p35 and p40 subunits  that  are separated  by an internal  ribosomal  entry  site 
and are driven  by a single  CMV  promoter.  
 
 
 
 
Figure 1:  The structure  of DNA  plasmid vector  expressing  Interleukin-12  
Mechanism  of Action  
pIL-12  cDNA plasmid  is a nonviral,  high  copy  number  plasmid  designed  to achieve  a transient  
transfection  of the host  cell and  high  level  of IL-12  protein  expression.  EP following  intratumoral  pIL-12  
injection  delivers  controlled  electrical  pulses  in a square  wave  pulse  pattern,  yielding  optimal  
transmembrane  potential  for electroporation  to occur 39. The  electroporation  pulses  are between  six 
hexagonal  opposing  needle  electrodes.  After  the first  pulse,  the polarity  between  the opposing  needle  
electrode  pairs  is reversed  and the needle  pair  is pulsed  again.  After  the initial  paired  pulse,  the pulse  
delivery  is rotated  clockwise  to the next  opposing  needle  pairs  until  a total  of six pulses  are delivered  to 
complete  the electroporation  sequence.  Six pulses  at a field strength  (E+) of 1500  V/cm  and pulse  width  
of 100 μ s at 1-second  intervals  will be administered  to each previously  injected  tumor.  
IL-12  is a 70 kilodalton  protein  consisting  of two  subunits,  40 kD and  35 kD, linked  by a disulfide  bond 36. 
It is a potent  pleotropic  cytokine  capable  of promoting  the development  of a T helper 1 response,  
inducing  the  production  of IFN-gamma  and increasing  the  proliferation  and cytotoxicity  of NK and  T

cells 37. Studies  have  shown  that  IL-12  also  acts  to up-regulate  the expression  of HLA  class  I and II, and  
ICAM  1, on human  melanoma  cells,  which  may  increase  their  immunogenicity.  In addition,  IFN increases  
MHC  I expression  on B16.F10  melanoma  cells 32. IL-12  immunotherapy  also  results  in the inhibition  of 
angiogenesis  through  mechanisms  not thoroughly  elucidated 38.

Note:  pIL-12  should  be given  first followed  by a 60 minute  observation  period  between  the two treatments.  
 
1 Accessible  tumors  for treatment  will be measured  in centimeters  and ¼ tumor  volume  will be calculated  
for each  tumor  selected  for treatment:  ¼ tumor  volume  = [(longest  diameter  in cm)(perpendicular  
diameter  in cm)2]/8; a minimum  of 0.1 mL per lesion  for lesions  <0.1  cm3  in ¼ volume  will be 
administered.  The maximum  plasmid  injection  volume  per patient  per day will not exceed  20 mL. 
2 Immediately  following  intratumoral  injection,  six pulses  at field  strengths  (E+) of 1500  V/cm  and pulse  
width  of 100 μs at 1-second  intervals  will be administered  to each  previously  injected  tumor  (see Section  
5.1.1.1).

5.1.1 TIMING  OF DOSE  ADMINISTRATION  
All trial  treatments  are planned  to be administered  on an outpatient  basis.  Intratumoral  pIL-12  should  
be given  first followed  by a minimum  of 60 minutes  observation  period  between  the two  treatments.  
 
 
Pembrolizumab  administration  
Pembrolizumab  should  be administered  on Day 1 of each  cycle  (±3days)  after  all procedures  / 
assessments  have  been  completed  as detailed  in the Study  Procedures  and Observations  (Section  6.0), 
and after  intratumoral  IL-12-EP  administration.  Pembrolizumab  will  be administered  as a 30 minute  IV 
infusion  (treatment  cycle  intervals  may  be increased  due to toxicity  as described  in Section  5.2).  Sites  
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 31 
 
should  make  every  effort  to target  infusion  timing  to be as close  to 30 minutes  as possible.  However,  
given  the variability  of infusion  pumps  from  site to site,  a window  of -5 minutes  and +10 minutes  is 
permitted  (i.e.,  infusion  time  is 30 minutes:  -5 min/+10  min).  
The separate  Pharmacy  Manual  contains  specific  instructions  for pembrolizumab  dose  calculation,  
reconstitution,  preparation  of the infusion  fluid,  and  administration.  
 
 
Intratumoral  pIL-12 Electroporation  
Intratumoral  pIL-12  followed  by EP may be administered  at each  odd cycle  as long  as the subject  has at 
least  one accessible  superficial  lesion  (ASL)  for treatment.  An ASL is defined  as meeting  the following  
criteria;  (1) at least  0.3 cm x 0.3 cm in longest  perpendicular  diameters,  (2) in a suitable  location  for 
application  of electroporation.  In a case  where  a subject  may  have  multiple  ASLs,  the maximum  number  
of lesions  should  be treated  at each  cycle,  keeping  in mind, (1)  patient  tolerability,  and  (2) not to exceed  
the maximum  daily  dose  of 20 mL.  Prior  to initiation  of a new  treatment  cycle  of  pIL-12  EP, the 
Investigator  will determine  ASLs  for treatment  during  that  cycle.  The  same  ASLs  should  be treated  on 
each  day of the cycle  (i.e.  Days  1, 5, 8). Previously  treated,  previously  identified  lesions  present  at  
baseline  that  were  left untreated,  and new  lesions  which  appear  during  the course  of the study  that  meet  
the definition  of an ASL may  be treated  as long  as the maximum  plasmid  injection  volume  per  patient  per 
day does not exceed  20 mL.  If no ASLs  are present  at subsequent  cycles,  the subject  may  skip  that  cycle  of 
pIL-12  and  continue  on the study  calendar.  When  feasible  one  lesion  should  remain  untreated  during  
Cycle  1 to permit  biopsy  of an untreated  lesion,  see Section  6.1.2.3.  
 
5.1.2 POST-COMPLETE  REMISSION  RELAPSE  ADMINISTRATION  
Duration  of therapy  may  continue  until  patients  have  a confi rmed  complete  response  by two scans  ≥4 
weeks  apart  and who  have  been  on treatment  for at least  6 months.  Discontinuation  of the study  regimen  
(IT-pIL12-EP  and pembrolizumab)  may  occur  at the discretion  of the Investigator  after  receiving  at least  
two doses  of pembrolizumab  beyond  the initial  determination  of CR. 
 
 
Patients  may  reinitiate  the full study  regimen  upon  relapse  if the  study  remains  open and the patient  
meets  the following  conditions:  
1. Stopped  treatment  after  attaining  an investigator-determined  confirmed  CR by RECISTv1.1  
2. Was  treated  for at least  24 weeks  with  pembrolizumab  before  discontinuing  therapy  
3. Received  at least  two treatments  with  pembrolizumab  beyond  the date when  the initial  CR 
was  declared  
4. Experienced  an investigator-determined  progression  after  stopping  treatment  
5. Did not receive  any  anti-cancer  treatment  since  the last  dose  of treatment  
6. Have  a performance  status  of 0 or 1 on the ECOG  Performance  Scale  
7. Demonstrate  adequate  organ  function  as follows:  
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852

Adequate  hematological  function:   
Absolute  neutrophil  count  (ANC)  ≥1,500/μL 
Platelets  ≥100,000/ μL 
Hemoglobin  ≥9 g/dL  
Adequate  hepatic  function:   
Serum  total  bilirubin  ≤1.5 x upper limit  of normal  (ULN)  OR Direct  
bilirubin  ≤ ULN  for patients  with  total  bilirubin  levels  
>1.5 ULN  
AST  (SGOT)  and ALT  (SGPT)  ≤2.5 x ULN  OR ≤5 x ULN  for patients  with  liver  
metastases  
Adequate  renal  function:   
Serum  creatinine  ≤1.5 x ULN  
Coagulation:   
International  normalized  ration  (INR)  
or Prothrombin  Time  (PT)  ≤1.5 x ULN  (Only  if not  using  anticoagulants1) 
Activated  partial  thromboplastin  time  
(aPTT)  ≤1.5 x ULN  (Only  if not  using  anticoagulants1) 
1If patient  is receiving  anticoagulants,  then  value  must  be within  therapeutic  range  for that  
condition  that  patient  is being  treated  for. 
 
8. Female  patient  of  childbearing  potential  should  have  a negative  serum   or urine  
pregnancy  test within  14 days  prior  to receiving  retreatment  
9. Women  of child-bearing  potential  (not  free  from  menses  for >2 years,  post  
hysterectomy/oophorectomy,  or surgically  sterilized)  must  agree  to use two  methods  of 
contraception,  or abstain  from heterosexual  activity,  during  participation  in study,  starting  with  
the first  study  treatment  from  the time  of consent  through  120  days  after  the last dose  of study  
therapy.  The  two  methods  must  include  at least  one “barrier  method”.  Barrier  methods  are 
diaphragms,  cervical  caps,  cervical  shields,  male  condoms,  and  female  condoms.  The  second  
method  of contraception  may  be another  barrier  method,  a copper  containing  IUD,  spermicidal  
foams,  sponges  and films,  or hormone-based  contraception  (for example,  hormone  pills,  hormone  
rings,  hormone  patches,  hormone-  releasing  IUDs,  or Depo  Provera).  Men  with  partners  who  
are capable  of  getting  pregnant  must agree  to use one of the barrier  methods  of contraception  
listed  above  during  participation  in the study,  starting  with  the first dose  of study  drug through  
120 days  after  the last  dose  of study  therapy.  
Patients  who  restart  treatment  will be retreated  at the same  21 day cycle  length  they  received  
upon  initial  treatment.  The  assessments  will follow  the main  study  calendar  and  will be  noted  in 
the CRFs  as “re-treatment”  cycles.

IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 33 
 
Prior  to plasmid  injection,  using  sterile  precautions,  1% lidocaine  may  be injected  around  the lesion  
intended  for IT-pIL-12  EP to obtain  local  anesthesia.  In addition,  the patient  may  be given  analgesics  or 
anxiolytics  as necessary  prior  to or during  treatment.  After  injecting  the plasmid  solution  into  the 
accessible  tumor,  a sterile  applicator  containing  6 stainless  steel  electrodes  arranged  in a circle  will  be 
placed  into  or around  the tumor.  The  applicator  will  be connected  to the power  supply  and six pulses  at a 
field strength  (E+) of 1500  V/cm  and pulse  width  of 100 μ s at 1-second  intervals  will be administered  to 
each  previously  injected  tumor.  EP following  intratumoral  pIL-12  injection  delivers  controlled  electrical  
pulses  in a square  wave  pulse  pattern,  yielding  optimal  transmembrane  potential  for electroporation  to 
occur  [39].  The electroporation  pulses  are between  six hexagonal  opposing  needle  electrodes.  After  the 
first pulse,  the polarity  between  the opposing  needle  electrode  pairs  is reversed  and  the needle  pair  is 
pulsed  again.  After  the initial  paired  pulse,  the pulse  delivery  is rotated  clockwise  to the next  opposing  
needle pairs  until  a total  of six pulses  are delivered  to complete  the electroporation  sequence.  When  
multiple  tumors  are being  injected  on the same  day,  EP should  be performed  immediately  after  the 
plasmid  injection  for each  tumor.  Once  a tumor  has been  completely  treated,  the next  tumor  can be 
injected  with  plasmid  and immediately  electroporated.  
The OncoSec  Medical  System  EP device  used  to deliver  the plasmid  consists  of two  main  components:  (1) 
a sterile  disposable  electrode  applicator  (OMS  Applicator)  with  needle  electrodes  (OMS  Applicator  Tip)  
and (2) an electric  pulse  device,  the OMS  Electroporation  Therapy  Generator  (OMS  Generator).  The OMS  
Applicator  connects  to the OMS  Generator  via a cable  with  a proximal  connector.   An OMS  
Electroporation  Therapy  Printer  (OMS Printer)  may  be optionally  used  to generate  a real  time  event  log 
of the electroporation  treatment  information  used  during  the treatment.  Additional  details  regarding  
handling  of the device  are provided  in the OncoSec  Medical  System  Operator’s  Manual.  
 
 
5.2 DOSE  MODIFICATIONS  AND  DOSING  DELAYS

In case  toxicity  does  not resolve  to Grade  0-1 or baseline  within  12 weeks  after  
last infusion,  trial  treatment  should  be discontinued  after  consultation  with  the 
Sponsor-Principal  Investigator.  With  Investigator  and Sponsor-Principal  
Investigator  agreement,  subjects  with  a laboratory  adverse  event  still at Grade  
2 after  12 weeks  may continue  treatment  in the trial  only if asymptomatic  and 
controlled.  
Subjects  who  experience  a recurrence  of the same  severe  or life-threatening  event  at the same  grade  or 
greater  with   re-challenge  of  pembrolizumab  should  be discontinued  from   trial  treatment.  
 
 
5.3  MONITORING  AND  TOXICITY  MANAGEMENT  
Each  patient  receiving  IT pIL-12  EP + pembrolizumab  will be evaluable  for safety.  Safety  will be assessed  
during  the study  by documentation  of adverse  events  (AEs),  clinical  laboratory  tests,  physical  
examination,  vital  sign  measurements,  and  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group  (ECOG)  performance  
status.  
Each  patient  will be assessed  periodically  for the development  of any toxicity  as outlined  in Section  6 
Study  Procedures  and Observations . Toxicity  will be assessed  according  to the NCI CTCAE  v4.0 .   Dose  
adjustments  will be made  according  to the system  showing  the greatest  degree  of toxicity.  
 
 
5.4  RESCUE  MEDICATIONS  & SUPPORTIVE  CARE  
5.4.1 SUPPORTIVE  CARE  GUIDELINES  
Subjects  should  receive  appropriate  supportive  care  measures  as deemed  necessary  by the treating  
Investigator.  Suggested  supportive  care  measures  for the management  of adverse  events  with  potential  
immunologic  etiology  are outlined  below.  Where  appropriate,  these  guidelines  include  the use  of oral  or 
intravenous  treatment  with  corticosteroids  as well  as additional  anti-inflammatory  agents  if symptoms  
do not improve  with  administration  of corticosteroids.   Note  that  several  courses  of steroid  tapering  
may  be necessary  as symptoms  may worsen  when  the steroid  dose  is decreased.  For each  disorder,  
attempts  should  be made  to rule  out other  causes  such  as metastatic  disease  or bacterial  or viral  
infection,  which  might  require  additional  supportive  care.  The treatment  guidelines  are intended  to be 
applied  when  the investigator  determines  the events  to be related  to pembrolizumab.  
 
Note:  if after  the evaluation  the event  is determined  not to be related, the investigator  does  not need  to 
follow  the treatment  guidance  (as outlined  below).  Refer  to Section  5.2.1  for dose modification.  
 
It may be necessary  to perform  conditional  procedures  such  as bronchoscopy,  endoscopy,  or skin  
photography  as part  of evaluation  of the event.  
 
 Pneumonitis : 
o For Grade  2 events, treat  with  systemic  corticosteroids.  When  symptoms  improve  to 
Grade  1 or less,  steroid  taper  should  be started  and  continued  over  no less  than  4 weeks.  
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 36 
 
o For Grade  3-4 events , immediately  treat  with  intravenous  steroids.  Administer  additional  
anti-inflammatory  measures,  as needed.  
o Add prophylactic  antibiotics  for opportunistic  infections  in the case of prolonged  steroid  
administration.  
 Diarrhea/Colitis : 
Subjects  should  be carefully  monitored  for signs  and symptoms  of enterocolitis  (such  as diarrhea,  
abdominal  pain,  blood  or mucus  in stool,  with  or without  fever)  and of bowel  perforation  (such  as 
peritoneal  signs  and ileus).  
 
o All subjects  who  experience  diarrhea/colitis  should  be advised  to drink  liberal  quantities  
of clear  fluids.  If sufficient  oral fluid  intake  is not feasible,  fluid  and electrolytes  should  be 
substituted  via IV infusion.  For Grade  2 or higher  diarrhea,  consider  GI consultation  and 
endoscopy  to confirm  or rule  out colitis.  
o For Grade  2 diarrhea/colitis,  administer  oral corticosteroids.  
o For Grade  3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis,  treat  with  intravenous  steroids  followed  by high  dose  
oral steroids.  
o When  symptoms  improve  to Grade  1 or less,  steroid  taper  should  be started  and continued  
over no less  than  4 weeks.  
 Type  1 diabetes  mellitus  (if new  onset, including  diabetic  ketoacidosis  [DKA] ) or ≥ Grade  3 
Hyperglycemia,  if associated  with  ketosis  (ketonuria)  or metabolic  acidosis  (DKA)  
o For T1DM  or Grade  3-4  Hyperglycemia  
 Insulin  replacement  therapy  is recommended  for Type  I diabetes  mellitus  and for 
Grade  3-4 hyperglycemia  associated  with  metabolic  acidosis  or ketonuria.  
 Evaluate   patients   with   serum   glucose   and  a  metabolic   panel,   urine   ketones,  
glycosylated  hemoglobin,  and C-peptide.  
 Hypophysitis : 
o For Grade  2 events,  treat  with  corticosteroids.  When  symptoms  improve  to Grade  1 or less,  
steroid  taper  should  be started  and continued  over no less than  4 weeks.  Replacement  of 
appropriate  hormones  may  be required  as the steroid  dose  is tapered.  
o For Grade  3-4 events,  treat  with  an initial  dose  of IV corticosteroids  followed  by oral 
corticosteroids.  When  symptoms  improve  to Grade  1 or less,  steroid  taper  should  be 
started  and continued  over  no less than  4 weeks.  Replacement  of appropriate  hormones  
may  be required  as the steroid  dose  is tapered.  
 Hyperthyroidism  or Hypothyroidism : 
Thyroid  disorders  can occur  at any time  during  treatment.  Monitor  patients  for changes  in 
thyroid  function  (at the start  of treatment,  periodically  during  treatment,  and  as indicated  based  
on clinical  evaluation)  and for clinical  signs  and symptoms  of thyroid  disorders.  
 
o Grade  2 hyperthyroidism  events  (and  Grade  2-4  hypothyroidism):  
 In hyperthyroidism,  non-selective  beta-blockers  (e.g.  propranolol)  are suggested  
as initial  therapy.

 In hypothyroidism,  thyroid  hormone  replacement  therapy,  with  levothyroxine  or 
liothyroinine,  is indicated  per standard  of care.  
o Grade  3-4  hyperthyroidism  
 Treat  with  an initial  dose  of IV corticosteroid  followed  by oral corticosteroids.  
When  symptoms  improve  to Grade  1 or less,  steroid  taper  should  be started  and 
continued  over  no less than  4 weeks.  Replacement  of appropriate  hormones  may  
be required  as the steroid  dose is tapered.  
 Hepatic : 
o For Grade  2 events,  monitor  liver  function  tests  more  frequently  until  returned  to baseline  
values  (consider  weekly).  
 Treat  with  IV or oral  corticosteroids  
o For Grade  3-4  events,  treat  with  intravenous  corticosteroids  for 24 to 48 hours.  
o When   symptoms   improve   to  Grade   1  or  less,   a  steroid   taper   should   be  started   and 
continued  over  no less than  4 weeks.  
 Renal Failure  or Nephritis : 
o For Grade  2 events,  treat  with corticosteroids.  
o For Grade  3-4 events,  treat with systemic  corticosteroids.  
o When symptoms  improve  to Grade  1 or less, steroid  taper  should  be started  and continued  over 
no less than 4 weeks.  
 Management  of Infusion  Reactions : Signs  and symptoms  usually  develop  during  or shortly  after  
drug infusion  and generally  resolve  completely  within  24 hours  of completion  of infusion.

6 STUDY  PROCEDURES  AND  OBSERVATIONS  
6.1  SCHEDULE  OF PROCEDURES  AND  OBSERVATIONS  
The study-specific  assessments  are detailed  in this section  and outlined  in Table  4 Schedule  of Study  
Procedures . Screening  assessments  must  be performed  within  28 days  prior  to the first  dose  of 
investigational  product  unless  otherwise  noted  (biopsy  samples  during  screening  may be done  90 days  
prior  to the first  dose  of treatment,  or at the discretion  of the study  sponsor).  Any  results  falling  outside  
of the reference  ranges  may  be repeated  at the discretion  of the Investigator.  All on-study  visit  
procedures  are allowed  a window  of ± 2 days  unless  otherwise  noted.   Treatment  or visit  delays  for 
public  holidays  or weather  conditions  do not constitute  a protocol  violation.  Research-related  
biomaterials  will no longer  be collected/processed  for patients  who  continue  treatment  beyond  24 
months.  
A written,  signed,  informed  consent  form  (ICF)  and a Health  Insurance  Portability  and Accountability  Act 
(HIPAA)  authorization  must  be obtained  before  any  study-specific  assessments  are initiated.  A copy  of 
the signed  ICF will be given  to the subject  and a copy  will be filed  in the medical  record.  The original  will  
be kept  on file with  the study  records.  Informed  consent  for specimens  for Future  Biomedical  Research  
will be obtained  during  screening  and must  be obtained  prior  to collection  of all Future  Biomedical  
Research  specimens.  
All patients  who  are consented  will  be registered  in OnCore ®, the UCSF  Helen  Diller  Family  
Comprehensive  Cancer  Center  Clinical  Trial  Management  System  (CTMS).   Data  will  be captured  in 
Medidata  or on paper  case  report forms  (CRFs)  maintained  by the site.  Data  may  be captured  on paper  
CRFs  for patients  who  continue  treatment  beyond  24 months.  Both  systems  are password  protected  and  
meet  HIPAA  requirements.  
 
6.1.1 PRETREATMENT  PERIOD

participation,  but repeated  biopsy  for reanalysis  is strongly  recommended  for patient  with  insufficient  
TILs  in the first  tissue  sample.  Low  TIL samples  will be presumed  to have  a low  proportion  of partially  
exhausted  T cells  for reporting  purposes  unless  a second  sample  reveals  an adequate  TIL population.  The  
second  biopsy  will be fixed  in formalin  and used  for biomarker  analysis  in the tumor  microenvironment  
using  at least  one IHC-based  assay.  Archival  tissue  should  also  be collected  whenever                        
available  and as long  as tissue  has  not been  previously  irradiated  and no systemic  antineoplastic  therapy  
has been  received  by the patient  between  the time  of the biopsy  and the first  administration  of protocol  
therapy.  Coagulation  assessment  must  be evaluated  within  24 hrs prior  to all biopsy  collections.  Biopsy  
samples  may be collected  up to 90 days  prior  to the first dose  of treatment,  or at the discretion  of the 
study  sponsor.

withdraw  consent  for further  data  collection.  For subjects  who  discontinue  for reasons  other  than  
progressive  disease,  every  attempt  should  be made  to continue  monitoring  their  disease  status  by 
radiologic  imaging.  Radiologic  monitoring  should  continue  (1) until  start of a new  anti- cancer  treatment,  
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 45 
 
(2) until  documented  disease  progression,  or (3) until  death,  whichever  occurs  first.  Radiographic  
imaging  in follow-up  may  be performed  as clinically  indicated  or per local  standard  of care . At time  of off 
treatment,  all patients  will enter  survival  follow-up,  and patients  or their  caregivers  will be contacted  
approximately  every 90 days  until  closure  of the study  via a site-placed  telephone  call  or documentation  
of clinic  visit.  Inquiries  into  the following  will be made:  
• Date of first  progression  (if the first  progression  has not occurred  prior  to entry  in the Follow-Up  
Phase) 
• Follow-up  therapy  for the treatment  of melanoma  (including  radiation,  anticancer  treatment,  
adjuvant  therapies  or surgeries)  
• Resolution  of AEs  and SAEs  ongoing  at the time  of entry  into survival  follow-up  
• Status  (alive,  no evidence  of disease,  alive  with  disease,  deceased)  
• Cause  and  date of death  (if applicable)  
 
 
6.1.5 DISCONTINUATION  OF THERAPY  
The Investigator  will  withdraw  a patient  whenever  continued  participation  is no longer  in the patient’s  
best interests.   Reasons  for withdrawing  a patient  include,  but are not limited  to, disease  progression,  
the occurrence  of an adverse  event  or a concurrent  illness,  a patient’s  request  to end  participation,  a 
patient’s  non-compliance  or simply  significant  uncertainty  on the part  of the Investigator  that  continued  
participation  is prudent.  There  may  also  be administrative  reasons  to terminate  participation,  such  as 
concern  about  a patient’s  compliance  with  the prescribed  treatment  regimen.  
 
 
6.1.6 WITHDRAWAL /DISCONTINUATION  
When  a subject  discontinues/withdraws  prior  to trial  completion,  all applicable  activities  scheduled  for 
the final  trial  visit  should  be performed  at the time  of discontinuation.  Any  adverse  events  which  are 
present  at the time  of discontinuation/withdrawal  should  be followed  in accordance  with  the safety  
requirements  outlined  in Section  7.4 – Follow-up  of Adverse  Events.  Subjects  who  a) attain  a CR or b) 
complete  24 months  of treatment  with  pembrolizumab  may  discontinue  treatment  with  the option  of 
restarting  treatment  if they  meet  the criteria  specified  in Section  5.1.2.  After  discontinuing  treatment  
following  assessment  of CR, these  subjects  should  return  to the site for a Safety  Follow-up Visit  
(described  in Section  6.1.3)  and then  proceed  to the Follow-Up  Period  of the study  (described  in Section  
6.1.4).

1. Baseline  conditions assessment  per DSMC  policy  (Baseline  Conditions VI Form). This will only  be required  
for patients  enrolled  and treated  at UCSF. For other  participating  sites,  baseline  conditions  will be 
recorded  and included  as part  of the medical history. 
2. Pain assessment  monitoring will be performed as part  of the adverse events  assessment on Days  1, 5 and 
8 of each  pIL-12  EP treatment  visit.  Patients  will use a numeric  pain  rating  scale to rate their  pain  with  a 
start  and stop  time  to capture  any pain  associated  with  EP procedure  and duration. Any  pain five minutes  
after  the EP treatment  will be evaluated  on the pain  scale and documented  as an AE. 
3. Includes  blood  pressure  (systolic  and diastolic),  respiratory  rate,  heart  rate and temperature.  Height only  
required  at screening.  Weight  collected  only at screening,  Day 1 of every  cycle,  and at the Safety  Follow-  
up/End  of Study  visit. 
4. Medical  history  all cancer  history  and includes  any conditions  resolved  within  6 months  of enrollment as 
well  as surgeries  and therapies  related  to the treatment  of melanoma  and any residual  toxicity.  
5. Disease-specific  staging  criteria.  
6. Disease  will be followed  using criteria  defined by RECIST v1.1. Evaluation  only  required  at time of imaging  
therefore  will be done  every 4 cycles  (within  7 days prior to Cycle 5, 9, 13, etc). 
7. ECOG.  
8. Two  newly  obtained  biopsies are mandatory  at baseline.  
Screening  biopsy  samples  may be collected  up to 30 days prior  to the first  dose of treatment,  or at the 
discretion  of the study  sponsor. 
One  biopsy  will be used  for evaluation  of TIL score by flow cytometry and analysis. A valid  flow cytometry  
result  is not required  for study participation,  but repeated  biopsy for reanalysis  is strongly  recommended  
for patient  with  insufficient  TILs  in the first  tissue  sample.  Low  TIL samples  will  be presumed  to have a low 
proportion  of partially  exhausted  T cells  for reporting  purposes  unless  a second  sample  reveals  an adequate  
TIL population.  
The second  biopsy  will be fixed  in formalin and used  for  biomarker analysis  to confirm  low PD-L1  
expression  in the tumor  microenvironment using Merck’s PD-L1  IHC assay (clone 22C3). 
At Cycle 2, prior  to treatment,  biopsies  from both  a treated  and untreated  lesion  must be obtained  for 
biomarker  analysis. Biopsies  of changing  lesions  should be obtained  at sign of regression or progression  for 
biomarker  analysis. The biopsy techniques  allowed  in the study  include  tru cut core biopsies or surgical  
biopsies.  Coagulation  assessment must be evaluated  within  24 hrs prior  to all biopsy  collections.  
Archival  tissue  may be utilized for the Merck  PD-L1  assay as long  as tissue  has not been previously  
irradiated  and no systemic antineoplastic  therapy  has been  received  by the patient  between the time  of the 
biopsy  and the first administration of protocol  therapy.  However,  two newly  obtained  biopsies  at baseline  
are still required.  
Post-treatment  biopsy  should not be performed  if End  of Study visit  occurs  more than 24 months  from  
initiation  of study  treatment.  
Unless  noted by the PI no other  biopsies  are required.  
9. Including  hemoglobin, platelets,  red blood cells,  white  blood  cells,  basophils  (abs),  eosinophils (abs),  
lymphocytes  (abs),  monocytes  (abs),  neutrophils  (abs),  and hematocrit. 
10. Including  sodium, potassium, chloride,  calcium,  phosphorus,  magnesium,  carbon dioxide CO2  or 
bicarbonate),  urea  nitrogen (BUN), creatinine,  uric acid, total protein,  albumin,  total bilirubin,  alkaline  
phosphatase,  alanine aminotransferase  (ALT), aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST),  lactate  dehydrogenase  
(LDH), direct  bilirubin,  non-fasting glucose.  
11. Including   PT/INR  and  aPTT.  Coagulation   assessment   required   if  biopsies  are  planned   and  must  be 
evaluated  within  24 hrs prior  to all biopsy  collections,  including  the biopsy  at Cycle 2. 
12. Including  T3, FT4 and TSH.  Following  Cycle 2, testing  will be performed  every  other  cycle (i.e.,  even  cycles),  
13. Including  HIV 1/2 antibodies,  HBsAg,  HCV  RNA (qualitative).  
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 49 
 
14. Only  required  for women of child-bearing potential  (i.e.,  postmenopausal  women  and women  who  have had 
a hysterectomy,  oophorectomy are not of child- bearing  potential).  Negative test must be performed within  
14 days  prior to first  study  treatment.  
15. Whole  blood  collection  for biomarker analysis. Research  tubes  should be collected  prior to treatment.  
16. Including  dipstick  and microscopic examinations  when  findings are abnormal.  Following  Cycle 1, testing  
will be performed every  3 cycles  (e.g.,  Cycle 4, 7, 10, 13, etc.). 
17. Tumor  imaging (either  CT or PET-CT or MRI,  with  strong preference  for CT) will be performed  within  28 
days prior  to enrollment.  CT must  be of the chest,  abdomen  and pelvis  (and  all extremities  with  lesions).  
The same imaging technique  has to be used  in a patient throughout  the study.  Imaging performed  every  4 
cycles,  thus  imaging should be performed within  7 days prior  to Cycle 5, Cycle 9, Cycle 13, etc.).  After  first  
documentation  of response,  repeat  imaging  is required  approximately  4 weeks  later  for confirmation of CR 
and PR. 
18. The same imaging  technique  should be used  in a patient as used  earlier  in the study.  Assessment  to be 
performed  in patients  who  discontinue  study  therapy  early without  documented  disease progression.  
Every  effort  should be made to continue monitoring their  disease status  by radiologic  imaging.  Monitoring  
should continue  1) until start of a new anti-cancer  treatment,  (2) until  documented  disease  progression,  or 
(3) until  death,  whichever  occurs first.  Radiographic  imaging  in follow-up  may be performed  as clinically  
indicated  or per local  standard  of care. 
19. Photograph  documentation  with  a ruler  and bi-dimensional  clinical  measurements  of target  and non-target  
lesions  will be performed  at screening,  then  every  4 cycles.. Photographs  and clinical  measurements  are to 
be completed  prior to any planned  biopsies.  After  first documentation  of response,  repeat  assessment  is 
required  approximately  4 weeks  later  for confirmation for CR and PR. 
20. Screening  and Safety  Follow-Up/End of Study Visits should include  a complete  physical exam.  Physical  
Exams  at all other  study  time  points  should be symptom-directed. 
21. Blood will only be collected  for research  through 24 months on study.

6.1.7 CRITERIA  FOR  PAIN ASSESSMENT  FOR  AE REPORTING  
 
 
For patients  who  experience  pain,  record  start  and stop  time  on the CRF.  If pain  persists  beyond  5 
minutes,  the duration  of time  required  for patient’s  post -treatment  pain  score  to return to their  
baseline  should  be captured  as an AE for pain,  assessing  the rating  and duration  (Figure  2). 
 
 
Figure 2 Numeric  pain rating scale  
 
 
 
 
 
6.2  GUIDELINES  FOR  BIOPSY  COLLECTION  
Fresh  tumor  biopsies  will be collected  prior  to first  treatment  with  pIL-12-EP  and at multiple  time  
points  post-treatment.  Tumors  biopsied  at post-treatment  time  points  may  be obtained  from  either  
treated  or untreated  tumors  as detailed  below.  Whenever  possible,  and  without  the risk  of artifact  from 
the screening  biopsy,  one  of the post-treatment  biopsies  should  be obtained  from the same  lesion  
biopsied  during  screening.  Tumors  selected  for biopsy  must  be accessible  and  the procedure  
considered  safe  per the investigator.  At any time  point  where  a biopsy  is required  but the patient  
does  not  present  with  an accessible  tumor  or if  a biopsy  of adequate  size  to meet  all exploratory  
objectives  cannot  be safely  obtained  (i.e. patient  has no lesions  to biopsy),  this  does  not constitute  
a protocol  deviation  but should  be clearly  documented  in the patient’s  record.  The following  
guidance  is provided  for each  biopsy  time  point:  
 
 
Screening:  
• Two  biopsies  (5mm  punch,  core  or excisional  biopsy)  are required.  A re-biopsy  is permitted  if 
results  are indeterminate.  Whenever  possible,  the second  biopsy  should  come  from the largest  
accessible  lesion  to allow  for a second  biopsy  at Cycle  2. 
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 51 
 
Prior  to Treatment  Cycle  2, Day 1: 
• Biopsies  of both  an untreated  lesion  and a treated  lesion  are required  (5mm  punch,  core  or 
excisional  biopsy).  Whenever  possible,  one of these  biopsies  should  be from  the same  lesion  as the 
screening  biopsy  if the  lesion  is of adequate  size such  that  the margins  of a repeat  biopsy  would  not 
intersect  with  the margins  of previous  biopsy.  If either  lesion  is too small  for 5mm  biopsy,  please  
contact  the investigator-  sponsor.  
 
 
At Safety  Follow-up/  End  of Study  Visit  
• Biopsies  should  be at the EOS  visit  whenever  feasible.  
 Biopsy  should  not be performed  if EOS  visit  occurs  more than  24 months  from  initiation  of 
study  treatment.  
 
 
6.3 CONCOMITANT  MEDICATIONS /VACCINATIONS  (ALLOWED  & PROHIBITED ) 
Medications  or vaccinations  specifically  prohibited  in the exclusion  criteria  are not allowed  during  the 
ongoing  trial.  If there  is a clinical  indication  for one of these  or other  medications  or vaccinations  
specifically  prohibited  during  the trial,  discontinuation  from  trial  therapy  or vaccination  may  be 
required.  The Investigator  should  discuss  any questions  regarding  this with  the Sponsor-Principal  
Investigator.  The final  decision  on any supportive  therapy  or vaccination  rests  with  the Investigator  
and/or  the subject's  primary  physician.  However,  the decision  to continue  the subject  on trial  therapy  
or vaccination  schedule  requires  the mutual  agreement  of the Investigator,  the Sponsor-Principal  
Investigator,  and  the subject.  
6.3.1  ACCEPTABLE  CONCOMITANT  MEDICATIONS  
All treatments  that  the Investigator  considers  necessa ry for a subject’s  welfare  may be administered  at 
the discretion  of the Investigator  in keeping  with  the community  standards  of medical  care.  All 
concomitant  medication  will be recorded  on the case  report  form  (CRF)  including  all prescription,  
over-the-counter  (OTC),  herbal  supplements,  and  IV medications  and fluids.  If changes  occur  during  
the trial  period,  documentation  of drug  dosage,  frequency,  route,  and  date  may  also  be included  on the 
CRF.  
All concomitant  medications  received  within  28 days  before  the first  dose  of trial  treatment  and 30 
days  after  the last  dose  of trial  treatment  should  be recorded.  Concomitant  medications  administered  
after  30 days  after  the last  dose of  trial  treatment  should  be recorded  for SAEs  and ECIs.  
6.3.2  PROHIBITED  CONCOMITANT  MEDICATIONS  
Subjects   are  prohibited  from   receiving  the  following  therapies   during  the Screening  and 
Treatment  Phase  (including  retreatment  for post-complete  response  relapse)  of this  trial:  
• Anti-cancer  systemic  chemotherapy  or biological  therapy  
• Immunotherapy  not specified  in this protocol  
• Chemotherapy  not specified  in this protocol  
• Investigational  agents  other  than  pembrolizumab  and pIL-12  EP 
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 52 
 
• Radiation  therapy  
o Note:  Radiation  therapy  to a symptomatic  solitary  lesion  or to the brain  may  be 
allowed  after  consultation  with  Sponsor-Principal  Investigator.  
• Live  vaccines   within  30 days   prior  to the first  dose  of  trial  treatment  and while  
participating  in the trial.  Examples  of live  vaccines  include,  but are not limited  to, the 
following:  measles,  mumps,  rubella,  chicken  pox,  yellow  fever,  rabies,  BCG,  and typhoid  (oral)  
vaccine.   Seasonal  influenza  vaccines  for injection  are generally  killed  virus  vaccines  and are 
allowed;  however  intranasal  influenza  vaccines  (e.g.,  Flu-Mist®)  are live  attenuated  vaccines,  
and are not allowed.  
• Glucocorticoids  for any  purpose  other  than  to modulate  symptoms  from  an event  of clinical  
interest  of suspected  immunologic  etiology.  The use  of physiologic  doses  of corticosteroids  
may  be approved  after  consultation  with  the Sponsor-Principal  Investigator.  Topical  steroids  
are permitted.  
Subjects  who,  in the assessment  by the Investigator,  require  the use of any of the aforementioned  
treatments  for clinical  management  should  be removed  from the trial.  Subjects  may receive  other  
medications  that  the Investigator  deems  to be medically  necessary.  
The Exclusion  Criteria  describes  other  medications  which  are prohibited  in this trial  (described  in 
Section  3.3.2).  There  are no prohibited  therapies  during  the Post-Treatment  Follow-up  Phase.  
 
 
6.4  DIETARY  RESTRICTIONS  
Patients  should  maintain  a normal,  healthy  diet.  
 
 
6.5  CONTRACEPTION  
Pembrolizumab  and/or  pIL-12  EP may  have  adverse  effects  on a fetus  in utero.  Furthermore,  it is  not  
known  if pembrolizumab  and/or  pIL-12  EP has  transient  adverse  effects  on the composition  of 
sperm.  Non-pregnant,  non-breast-feeding  women  may  be enrolled  if they  are willing  to use  2 methods  
of birth  control  or are considered  highly  unlikely  to conceive.   Highly  unlikely  to conceive  is defined  as 
1) surgically  sterilized,  or 2) postmenopausal  (a woman  who is≥45 years  of age  and  has not had  
menses  for greater  than  1 year  will  be considered  postmenopausal),  or 3) not heterosexually  active  for 
the duration  of the study.  The two  birth  control  methods  can be either  two  barrier  methods  or a 
barrier  method  plus  a hormonal  method  to prevent  pregnancy.  Subjects  should  start  using  birth  
control  from  signing  of  consent  throughout  the study  period  up to 120 days  after  the last  dose  of 
study  therapy.  
The following  are considered  adequate  barrier  methods  of contraception:  diaphragm,  condom  (by the 
partner),  copper  intrauterine  device,  sponge,  or spermicide.  Appropriate  hormonal  contraceptives  
will include  any  registered  and marketed  contraceptive  agent  that  contains  an estrogen  and/or  a 
progestational  agent  (including  oral, subcutaneous,  intrauterine,  or intramuscular  agents).  
Subjects  should  be informed  that  taking  the study  medication  may  involve  unknown  risks  to the fetus  
(unborn  baby)  if pregnancy  were  to occur  during  the study.  In order  to participate  in the study  they  
must  adhere  to the contraception  requirement  (described  above)  for the  duration  of the study  and 
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 53 
 
during  the follow-up  period  defined  above.  Reporting  of Pregnancy  and Lactation  to the Sponsor-  
Principal  Investigator  and to Merck  and OncoSec  Medical  Inc.  is required.  If there  is any question  that  
a subject  will not reliably  comply  with  the requirements  for contraception,  that  subject  should not be 
entered  into the study.  
 
 
6.5.1 USE IN PREGNANCY  
If a subject  inadvertently  becomes  pregnant  while  on treatment  with  pembrolizumab  and/or  pIL-12  
EP, the subject  will immediately  be removed  from  the study.  The site will contact  the subject  at least  
monthly  and document  the subject’s  status  until  the pregnancy  has been  completed  or terminated.  
The outcome  of  the  pregnancy  will be reported to the  Sponsor-Principal  Investigator  (or 
designee)  without  delay  and within  24 hours  if the outcome  is a serious  adverse  experience  (e.g.,  
death,  abortion,  congenital  anomaly,  or other  disabling  or life-threatening  complication  to the mother  
or newborn).  The study  Investigator  will  make  every  effort to obtain  permission  to follow  the 
outcome  of the pregnancy  and report the condition  of the fetus  or newborn  to the Sponsor-Principal  
Investigator . If a male  subject  impregnates  his female  partner  the study  personnel  at the site  must  
be informed  immediately  and the pregnancy  reported  to the Sponsor-Principal  Investigator  (or 
designee)  and  followed  as described  above.  
6.5.2 USE IN NURSING  WOMEN  
It is unknown  whether  pembrolizumab  and/or  pIL-12  is excreted  in human  milk.  Since  many  drugs  
are excreted  in human  milk,  and because  of the potential  for serious  adverse  reactions  in the nursing  
infant,  subjects  who  are breast-feeding  are not eligible  for enrollment.

7 REPORTING  AND  DOCUMENTATION  OF RESULTS  
7.1 EVALUATION  OF EFFICACY  (OR ACTIVITY ) 
7.1.1 ANTITUMOR  EFFECT  – SOLID  TUMORS  
Response  and  progression  in this study  will be evaluated  using  the new  international  criteria  proposed  
by the Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in Solid  Tumors  (RECIST ) Committee  [JNCI  92(3):205-216,  2000].  
Changes  in only the largest  diameter  (unidimensional  measurement)  of the tumor  lesions  are used  in 
the RECIST  v1.1  criteria.  Evaluation  by immune-related  Response  Criteria  (irRC)  to satisfy  secondary  
objectives  is described  in Section  7.1.2.  
 
7.1.1.1 Definitions  
Evaluable  for toxicity  (i.e.,  Safety  Evaluable  Population)  
All patients  will  be evaluable  for toxicity  from  the time  of their  first  treatment  with  the study  drug.  
Evaluable  for objective  response  (i.e.,  Efficacy  Evaluable  Population)  
Only  those  patients  who  have  measurable  disease  present  at baseline,  have  received  at least  one cycle  
of therapy  of both  pembrolizumab  and pIL-12  EP will be considered  evaluable  for response.   These  
patients  will have  their  response  classified  according  to the definitions  stated  below.  
 
 
7.1.1.2 Disease  Parameters  
Measurable  disease  
Measurable  disease  is defined  as lesions  (or tumors)  that  can  be accurately  measured  in at least  one 
dimension  (longest  diameter  to be recorded)  with  a minimum  size of 15mm  by CT scan  (irrespective  
of scanner  type),  10mm  caliper  measurement  by clinical  exam  (when  superficial),  and/or  20mm  by 
chest  X-ray (if clearly  defined  and  surrounded  by aerated  lung).  
All tumor  measurements  will be recorded  in millimeters  or decimal  fractions  of centimeters.  
Previously  irradiated  lesions  are considered  non-measurable  except  in cases  of documented  
progression  of the lesion  since  the completion  of radiation  therapy.  It is recommended  that  previously  
irradiated  lesions  that  would   otherwise  be considered  measurable  be followed  closely  by 
investigators  comments,  measurements  and photographs  if applicable  for retrospective  review.  
Target  lesions  
All measurable  lesions  up to a maximum  of 5 lesions  total  (and  a maximum  of two lesions  per  organ)  
representative  of all involved  organs  should  be identified  as target  lesions  and recorded  and  measured  
at baseline.   Target  lesions  will be selected  on the basis  of their  size (lesions  with  the longest diameter)   
and their  suitability  for accurate   repeated  measurements  (either  by imaging  techniques  or 
clinically).  A sum  of the longest  diameter  (LD)  for all target  lesions  will be calculated  and reported       
as the baseline  sum  LD.  The baseline  sum  LD will  be used  as reference  by which  to characterize  the 
objective  tumor  response.  
Non-target  lesions  
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 55 
 
All other  lesions  (or sites  of disease)  including  any measurable  lesions  over  and  above  the 5 target  
lesions  should  be identified  as  non-target  lesions  and should  also  be recorded  at baseline.   It is 
possible  to record  multiple  non-target  lesions  involving  the same  organ  as a single  item  on the case  
record  form  (e.g.  “multiple  enlarged  pelvic  lymph  nodes”  or “multiple  liver  metastases”).   Bone  lesions  
may be measureable  if ≥ 1 cm on MRI.  Measurements  of these  lesions  are not required,  but the 
presence  or absence  of each  will  be noted  throughout  follow-up.  It is  recommended  that  bone  
lesions   be followed  closely  by investigators   by comments  and measurements  whenever  possible  for 
retrospective  review.  
 
 
Non-measurable  disease  
Non-measurable  disease  is  all   other  lesions   (or  sites   of disease),  including  small   lesions  (longest  
diameter  < 20 mm  with  conventional  techniques  or < 10 mm  using  spiral  CT scan).  Leptomeningeal  
disease,  ascites,  pleural  or pericardial  effusion,  inflammatory  breast  disease,  lymphangitic  involvement  
of skin  or lung,  abdominal  masses/abdominal  organomegaly  identified  by physical  exam  that  is not 
measurable  by reproducible  imaging  techniques  are all non-  measurable.  
 
 
7.1.1.3 Methods  for Evaluation  of Measurable  Disease  
All measurements  will be taken  and recorded  in metric  notation  using  a ruler  or calipers.  All baseline  
evaluations  will  be performed  as closely  as possible  to the beginning  of treatment  and never  more  
than  28 days  before  the beginning  of the treatment.  
The same  method  of assessment  and the same  technique  will  be used  to characterize  each  identified  
and reported  lesion  at baseline  and  during  follow-up.  Imaging-based  evaluation  is preferred  to 
evaluation  by clinical  examination  when  both  methods  have  been  used  to assess  the antitumor  effect  
of a treatment.  
Conventional  CT (or PET-CT)  
These  techniques   should  be performed  with  cuts  of 10 mm  or  less  in slice  thickness  
contiguously.  Spiral  CT should  be performed  using  a 5 mm  contiguous  reconstruction  algorithm.  This  
applies  to tumors  of the chest,  abdomen,  and pelvis.  If measurable  disease  is noted  in other  areas  of 
the body,  CT imaging  of those  areas  should  be performed  as well.  Whole-body  PET-CT  is the preferred  
imaging  technique  whenever  possible.  
 
7.1.1.4 RECIST  v1.1  Response  Criteria  
Evaluation  of Target  Lesions  
Complete  Response  (CR)  
Disappearance  of all target  lesions,  determined  by two separate  observations  conducted  not 
less than  4 weeks  apart.  Any  pathological  lymph  nodes  (whether  target  or non-target)  must  
have  reduction  in short  axis  to <10  mm  (the  sum  may  not be “0” if there  are target  nodes).  
There  can  be no appearance  of new  lesions.  
Partial  Response  (PR)  
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 56 
 
At least  a 30%  decrease  in the sum  of the longest  diameter  (LD)  of target  lesions,  taking  as 
reference  the baseline  sum  LD. There  can be no appearance  of new  lesions.  
Progressive  Disease  (PD)  
At least  a 20%  increase  in the sum  of the SLD  of target  lesions,  taking  as reference  the smallest  
sum  SLD  recorded  since  the treatment  started  and minimum  5 mm  increase  over the nadir,  or 
the appearance  of one  or more new  lesions.  
Stable  Disease  (SD)  
Neither  sufficient  shrinkage  to qualify  for PR nor sufficient  increase  to qualify  for PD, taking  as 
reference  the smallest  sum  LD since  the treatment  started.  
 
 
Evaluation  of Non-Target  Lesions  
Complete  Response  (CR)  
Disappearance  of all non-target  lesions  and  normalization  of tumor  marker  level.   All lymph  
nodes  must  be non-pathological  in size (< 10 mm  short  axis).  
Incomplete  Response/Stable  Disease  (SD)  
Persistence  of one or more  non-target  lesion(s)  and/or  maintenance  of tumor  marker  level  
above  the normal  limits.  
Progressive  Disease  (PD)  
Appearance  of one or more  new  lesions  and/or  unequivocal  progression  of existing  non-target  
lesions.  
 
 
Evaluation  of Best  Overall  Response  
The best  overall  response  is the best  response  recorded  from  the start  of the treatment  until  disease  
progression/recurrence  (taking  as reference  for progressive  disease  the smallest  measurements  
recorded  since  the treatment  started). The patient's  best  response  assignment  will depend  on the 
achievement  of both  measurement  and confirmation  criteria.

7.1.2 IMMUNE  RELATED  RESPONSE  CRITERIA  (IRRC) 
Definitions  of measurable  and non-measurable  disease  
Measurable  disease  
Neoplastic  masses  that  can be precisely  measured  in 2 in-plane  perpendicular  diameters.  Both  
its longest  diameter  and its longest  perpendicular  must  be greater  than  or equal  to 10 mm  or 2 
times  the axial  slice  thickness.  Lymph  nodes  must  have  a short-axis  line- length  of ≥ 15 mm.  
Malignant  lymph  nodes  must  be measurable  in 2 perpendicular  diameters.  Both  its longest  
diameter  and  its longest  perpendicular  must  be greater  than  or equal  to 15 mm  or 2 times  the 
axial  slice  thickness.  The  quantitative  endpoint  will be defined  as the product  of the longest  
diameter  with  its longest  perpendicular.  
 
 
Non-measurable  disease  
Non-measurable  lesions  are those  that  are not suitable  for quantitative  assessment  over  time.  
These  include:  
1. Neoplastic  masses  that  are too small  to measure,  because  their  longest  uninterrupted  
diameter  or longest  perpendicular  are less than  10 mm or two  times  the axial  slice  thickness.  
2. Neoplastic  masses  whose  boundaries  cannot  be distinguished.  This  includes  masses  which  
cannot  be demarcated  from  surrounding  tissue  because  of inadequate  contrast,  masses  with  
overly  complex  morphology,  or those  with  highly  heterogeneous  tissue  composition.  
3. Other  types  of lesions  that  are confidently  felt to represent  neoplastic  tissue,  but difficult  to 
quantify  in a reproducible  manner.  These  include  bone  metastases,  leptomeningeal  metastases,  
malignant  ascites,  pleural/pericardial  effusions,  inflammatory  breast  disease,  lymphangitis  
cutis/pulmonis,  cystic  lesions,  ill defined  abdominal  masses,  etc.  
 
 
For irRC, only target  lesions  selected  at baseline  and  measurable  new  lesions  are taken  into account.  
At the baseline  tumor  assessment,  the sum  of the products  of the two  largest  perpendicular  diameters  
(SPD) of all index  lesions  (five  lesions  per  organ,  up to 10 visceral  lesions  and five cutaneous  index  
lesions)  is calculated.  
At each subsequent  tumor  assessment,  the SPD of the index  lesions  and of new,  measurable  lesions  (≥5 
X 5 mm;  up to 5 new  lesions  per organ:  5 new  cutaneous  lesions  and 10 visceral  lesions)  are added  
together  to provide  the total  time-point  tumor  burden.  
 
 
Overall  response  using  irRC:  
Complete  Response  (irCR)  
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 58 
 
Complete  disappearance  of all tumor  lesions  (whether  measureable  or not, and no new  
lesions).  CR must  be confirmed  by repeated,  consecutive  assessments  made  no less  than  4 
weeks  from  the date  first  documented.  
Partial  Response  (irPR)  
Decrease  in SPD  of 50% or greater  by a consecutive  assessment  at least  4 weeks  after  first  
documentation.  
Stable  Disease  (irSD)  
Failure  to meet  criteria  for irCR  or irPR,  in absence  of irPD.  
Progressive  Disease  (irPD)  
At least  25%  increase  in SPD  relative  to nadir  (minimum  recorded  tumor  burden)  
Confirmation  by a repeat,  consecutive  assessment  no less  than  4 weeks  from  the data  first  
documented.  
Please note  other  key  differences  between  irRC  and  the original  WHO  criteria:  New  measurable  lesions  
will be incorporated  into the SPDNew  non measurable  lesions  do not define  progression  but preclude  
irCR  
 
 
Non-index  lesions  contribute  to defining  irCR  (complete  disappearance  required).  IrRC  for the current  
protocol  is adopted  from  Wolchok  et al  (2009).  
 
7.2  EVALUATION  OF SAFETY  
Analyses  will be performed  for all  patients  having  received  at least  one dose  of study  drug.  The study  
will use  the CTCAE  v4.0  for reporting  of adverse  events.  Safety  will be assessed  during  the study  by 
documentation  of adverse  events  (AEs),  clinical  laboratory  tests,  physical  examination,  vital  sign  
measurements,  and  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group  (ECOG) performance  status.  
For multicenter  studies,  the Principal  Investigator  at the UCSF  Coordinating  Center  will hold  the role of 
Study  Chair.  The Study  Chair  is responsible  for the overall  conduct  of the  study  and for monitoring  its 
safety  and progress  at all participating  sites. 
 
 
7.2.1 EVALUATING  ADVERSE  EVENTS  
An investigator  who  is a qualified  physician  will evaluate  all adverse  events  according  to the NCI  
Common  Terminology  for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE),  version  4.0. Any  adverse  event  which  changes  
CTCAE  grade  over  the course  of a given  episode  will  have  each  change  of grade  recorded  on the 
adverse  event  case  report  forms/worksheets.  
All adverse  events  regardless  of CTCAE  grade  must  also  be evaluated  for seriousness.  
 
 
Definitions  of Adverse  Events  
7.2.1.1 Adverse  Event  
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 59 
 
An adverse  event  (also  known  as an adverse  experience)  is defined  as any untoward  medical  
occurrence  associated  with  the use  of a drug  in humans,  whether  or not considered  drug  related.   More  
specifically,  an adverse  event  (can  be any  unfavorable  and  unintended  sign  (e.g.,  an abnormal  
laboratory  finding),  symptom,  or disease  temporally  associated  with  the use of a drug,  without  any  
judgment  about  causality.  An adverse  event  can arise  from  any use of the drug  (e.g.,  off-label  use,  use  in 
combination  with  another  drug)  and from  any route  of administration,  formulation,  or dose,  including  
an overdose.  Any  untoward  medical  occurrence  prior  to dosing  at C1D1 will  be recorded  as         
Medical  History.  
7.2.1.2 Adverse  reaction  
An adverse  reaction  is defined  as any adverse  event  caused  by the use  of a drug.   Adverse  reactions  are 
a subset  of all suspected  adverse  reactions  for which  there  is reason  to conclude  that  the drug  caused  
the event.  
7.2.1.3 Suspected  
A suspected  adverse  reaction  is defined  as any adverse  event  for which  there  is a reasonable  
possibility  that  the drug  caused  the adverse  event.  For  the purposes  of IND  safety  reporting,  
“reasonable  possibility”   indicates   that  there  is  evidence  to suggest  a causal  relationship  between  
the drug and the adverse  event.  A suspected  adverse  reaction  implies  a lesser  degree  of certainty  
about  causality  than  an adverse  reaction.  
7.2.1.4 Unexpected  
An adverse  event  or suspected  adverse  reaction  is considered  unexpected  if it is not listed  in the 
investigator  brochure  or package  insert(s),  or is not listed at the specificity  or severity that  has  been  
observed,  or, if  an investigator  brochure  is not required  or available,  is not consistent  with  the risk  
information  described  in the general  investigational  plan  or elsewhere  in the current  application.  
“Unexpected,”  as used  in this definition,  also  refers  to adverse  events  or suspected  adverse  reactions  
that  are mentioned  in the investigator  brochure  as occurring  with  a class  of drugs  or as  anticipated  
from the pharmacological  properties   of  the drug,  but are not specifically  mentioned  as occurring  
with  the particular  drug  under  investigation.  
Adverse  events   that  would  be anticipated  to occur  as  part  of the  disease  process   are  considered  
unexpected  for the  purposes  of reporting  because  they  would  not be listed  in the investigator   
brochure.    For example,  a certain  number  of non-acute  deaths  in a cancer  trial  would  be anticipated  as 
an outcome  of the underlying  disease,  but such  deaths  would  generally  not be listed  as a suspected  
adverse  reaction  in the investigator  brochure.  
 
 
Some  adverse  events  are listed  in the Investigator  Brochure  as occurring  with  the same  class  of drugs,  
or as anticipated  from  the pharmacological  properties  of the drug,  even  though  they  have  not been  
observed  with  the drug  under  investigation.   Such  events  would  be considered  unexpected  until  they  
have  been  observed  with  the drug under  investigation.  For example,  although  angioedema  is 
anticipated  to occur  in some  patients  exposed  to drugs  in the ACE  inhibitor  class and angioedema  
would  be described  in the investigator  brochure  as a class  effect,  the first  case  of angioedema  observed  
with  the drug  under  investigation  should  be considered  unexpected  for reporting  purposes.  
7.2.1.5 Serious  
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 60 
 
An adverse  event  or suspected  adverse  reaction  is considered  serious  if, in the view  of either  the 
Investigator  or Sponsor-Principal  Investigator,  it results  in any of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening  adverse  event  
• Inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  hospitalization  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  normal  
life function  
• Congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Note:  In addition  to the above  criteria,  adverse  events  meeting  either  of the below  criteria,  although  
not serious  per ICH definition,  are reportable  to the  Merck  in the same  timeframe  as SAEs  to meet  certain  
local  requirements.  Therefore,  these  events  are considered  serious  by Merck for collection  purposes.  
● Is a new cancer (that is not a condition  of the study);  
● Is associated  with an overdose.  
Important  medical  events  that  may  not result  in death,  are life-threatening,  or require  hospitalization  
may  be considered  serious  when,  based  upon  appropriate  medical  judgment,  they  may  jeopardize  the 
patient  or subject  and may  require  medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  
listed  in this definition.  Examples  of such  medical  events  include  allergic  bronchospasm  requiring  
intensive  treatment  in an emergency  room  or at home,  blood  dyscrasias  or convulsions  that  do not 
result  in inpatient  hospitalization,  or the development  of drug dependency  or drug abuse.  
7.2.1.6 Life-threatening  
An adverse  event  or suspected  adverse  reaction  is considered  life-threatening  if, in the view  of either  
the Investigator  or Sponsor-Principal  Investigator,  its occurrence  places  the patient  or subject  at 
immediate  risk  of death.  It does not include  an adverse  event  or suspected  adverse  reaction  that,  had it 
occurred  in a more  severe  form, might  have caused  death. 
 
7.2.2  EVENTS  OF CLINICAL  INTEREST  
Events  of clinical  interest  for this  trial  include:  
1. an overdose  of investigational  product,  as defined  in Section  7.6, that  is not associated  with  clinical  
symptoms  or abnormal  laboratory  results.  
2. an elevated  AST  or ALT  lab value  that  is greater  than  or equal  to 3X the  upper  limit  of normal  and  an 
elevated  total  bilirubin  lab value  that  is greater  than  or equal  to 2X the upper  limit  of normal  and,  at the 
same  time,  an alkaline  phosphatase  lab value  that  is less than  2X the upper  limit  of normal,  as 
determined  by way  of protocol-specified  laboratory  testing  or unscheduled  laboratory  testing.*  
 
 
*Note:    These  criteria  are based  upon  available  regulatory  guidance  documents.  The purpose  of 
the criteria  is to specify  a threshold  of abnormal  hepatic  tests  that  may  require  an additional  
evaluation  for an  underlying  etiology.  
 
 
7.3  RECORDING  OF AN ADVERSE  EVENT  
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 61 
 
All adverse  events,  regardless  of grade,  will be entered  into the Medidata  RAVE  EDC  system.  For  the 
primary  UCSF  clinical  site,  all grade  3 and above  adverse  events  will be entered  into  OnCore ®, whether  
or not the event  is believed  to be associated  with  use of the study  drug.  Data  about  these  events  and 
their  severity  will be recorded  using  the NCI  CTCAE  v4.0.    Note:  satellite  sites  will not be required  to 
enter  the information  into  OnCore ®. 
 
 
The Investigator  will  assign  attribution  of the possible  association  of the event  with  use of the 
investigational  drug,  and this information  will be entered  into  Medidata  RAVE  (and  OnCore ® when  
appropriate)  using  the classification  system  listed  below:  
 
 
Relationship  Attribution  Description  
 
Unrelated  The  AE   is 
intervention  clearly  NOT related  to the  
 
Unrelated  to investigational

Unlikely  The AE is doubtfully  
intervention  related  to the 
Possible  The AE may be related  to the intervention  Related    to investigational  
drug/intervention  Definite  The AE is clearly  related  to the intervention  
 
Signs  or symptoms  reported  as adverse  events  will be graded  and recorded  by the Investigator  
according  to the CTCAE.  When  specific  adverse  events  are not listed  in the CTCAE  they  will be graded  
by the Investigator  as none , mild , moderate  or severe  according  to the following  grades  and  definitions:  
 
Grade  0 No AE (or within  normal  limits)  
Grade  1 Mild;  asymptomatic  or mild  symptoms;  clinical  or diagnostic  observations  only;  
intervention  not indicated  
Grade  2 Moderate;  minimal,  local,  or  noninvasive  intervention  (e.g.,  packing,  cautery)  
indicated;  limiting  age-appropriate  instrumental  activities  of daily  living  (ADL)  
Grade  3: Severe or medically  significant  but not immediately  life-threatening;  hospitalization  
or prolongation  of hospitalization  indicated;  disabling;  limiting  self-care  ADL  
Grade  4: Life-threatening  consequences;  urgent  intervention  indicated  
Grade  5: Death  related  to AE 
 
7.4  FOLLOW -UP OF ADVERSE  EVENTS  
All adverse  events   will  be followed   with   appropriate  medical  management  until  resolved.  
Patients  removed  from  study  for unacceptable  adverse  events  will be followed  until  resolution  or 
stabilization  of the adverse  event.  For selected  adverse  events  for which  administration  of the 
investigational  drug  was  stopped,  a re-challenge  of the subject  with  the investigational  drug  may  be 
conducted  if considered  both  safe  and  ethical  by the Investigator.  
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 62 
 
7.5  ADVERSE  EVENTS  MONITORING  
All adverse  events,  whether  or not unexpected,  and  whether  or not considered  to be associated  with  
the use of the study  drug(s),  will  be entered  into  Medidata  Rave ®, or a paper  case  report  form,  as noted  
above.  
The Sponsor-Principal  Investigator  (or designee)  will  assess  all adverse  events  and determine  
reportability  requirements  to the UCSF  Data  and  Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  and  UCSF’s  
Institutional  Review  Board;  and,  when  the study  is conducted  under  an Investigational  New  Drug  
Application  (IND),  to the Food  and Drug  Administration  (FDA)  if it meets  the FDA  reporting criteria.  
 
 
All adverse  events  entered  into  Medidata  Rave ® will be reviewed  by OncoSec  Medical  Inc. and  
monitoring  reports  will be reviewed  by the Sponsor- Principal  Investigator  and/or  UCSF’s  DSMC  on an 
ongoing  basis.  
All grade(s)  3-5 adverse  events  entered  into  OnCore®  will be reviewed  on a monthly  basis  at the Site 
Committee  meetings.  The Site Committee  will  review  and discuss  the selected  toxicity,  the toxicity  
grade,  and the attribution  of relationship  of the adverse  event  to the administration  of the study  
drug(s).  
In addition,  all suspected  adverse  reactions  considered  “serious”  entered  into  OnCore®,  will be 
reviewed  and monitored  by the Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  on an ongoing  basis  and 
discussed  at DSMC  meetings,  which  take  place  approximately  every six weeks.  
For a detailed  description  of the Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Plan  for a Multicenter  Phase  2 or 3 
Institutional  Study  at the Helen Diller  Comprehensive  Cancer  Center  please  refer  to Appendix  2 
Multicenter  Institutional  Studies.  
 
7.6  EXPEDITED  REPORTING  
Reporting  to the Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  
If a death occurs  during  the treatment  phase  of the study  or within  30 days  after  the last  
administration  of the study  drug(s)  and it is determined  to be related  either  to the study 
drug(s)  or to a study  procedure,  the Sponsor-Principal  Investigator  or his/her  designee  must  
notify  the DSMC  Chair  (or qualified  alternate)  within  1 business  day of knowledge  of the event.  
The contact  may  be by phone  or e-mail.  
Reporting  to UCSF  Institutional  Review  Board  
The Sponsor-Principal  Investigator  must  report  events  meeting  the UCSF  IRB definition  of 
“Unanticipated  Problem”  (UP)  within  5 business  days  of his/her  awareness  of the event.  
Expedited  Reporting  to the Food  and Drug  Administration  
If the study  is being  conducted  under  an IND,  the Sponsor-Principal  Investigator  is responsible  
for determining  whether  or not the suspected  adverse  reaction  meets  the criteria  for expedited  
reporting in accordance  with  Federal  Regulations  (21 CFR  §312.32).  
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 63 
 
The Sponsor-Principal  Investigator  must  report  in an IND  safety  report  any suspected  adverse  
reaction  that  is both  serious  and unexpected.  The Sponsor-Principal  Investigator  needs  to 
ensure that  the event  meets  all three  definitions:  
o Suspected  adverse  reaction  
o Unexpected  
o Serious  
 
If the adverse  event  does  not meet  all three  of the definitions,  it should  not be submitted  as an 
expedited  IND  safety  report.  
The timeline  for submitting  an IND  safety  report  to FDA  is no later  than  15 calendar  days  after  
the Sponsor-Principal  Investigator  determines  that  the suspected  adverse  reaction  qualifies  for 
reporting (21 CFR  312.32(c)(1)).  
Any  unexpected  fatal or life-threatening  suspected  adverse  reaction  will be reported  to FDA  no 
later  than  7 calendar  days  after the Sponsor- Principal  Investigator’s  initial  receipt  of the 
information  (21 CFR 312.32(c)(2)).  
Any  relevant  additional  information  that  pertains  to a previously  submitted  IND  safety  report  
will be submitted  to FDA  as a Follow-up  IND  Safety  Report  without  delay,  as soon  as 
the information  is available  (21  CFR 312.32(d)(2)).  
Expedited  Reporting  to Merck  and OncoSec  Medical  Inc. Reporting  of Overdose  
For purposes  of this  trial,  an overdose  of pembrolizumab  will  be defined  as any dose of 1,000  
mg or greater  (≥5 times  the indicated  dose) . No specific  information  is available  on the 
treatment  of overdose  of pembrolizumab.  In the event  of overdose,  the current  infusion  of 
pembrolizumab  should  be discontinued  and the subject  should  be observed  closely  for signs  of 
toxicity.  Appropriate  supportive  treatment  should  be provided  if clinically  indicated.  
If an adverse  event(s)  is associated  with  (“results  from”)  the overdose  of an investigational  
product,  the adverse  event(s)  is reported  as a serious  adverse  event,  even  if no other  
seriousness  criteria  are met  and  should  be reported  to the Sponsor-Principal  Investigator  (or 
designee)  within  24 hours.  
If a dose  meeting  the protocol  definition  of overdose  is taken  without  any  associated  clinical  
symptoms  or abnormal  laboratory  results,  the overdose  is reported  as a non-serious  Event  of 
Clinical  Interest  (ECI), using  the terminology  “accidental  or intentional  overdose  without  
adverse  effect.”  
All reports  of overdose  with  and  without  an adverse  event  must  be reported  within  24 hours  to 
the Sponsor-Principal  Investigator  (or designee).  It is then  the responsibility  of UCSF  as the 
Sponsor  to complete  reporting  to Merck  Global  Safety  (Attn:  Worldwide  Product  Safety;  FAX  
215 993-1220)  and to OncoSec  Medical  Inc (Attn:  Medical  Monitor;  Email:  
safety@oncosec.com).  
Reporting  of Pregnancy  and Lactation  
Although  pregnancy  and lactation  are not considered  adverse  events,  it is the responsibility  of 
Investigators  or their  designees  to report any pregnancy  or lactation  in a subject  
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 64 
 
(spontaneously  reported  to them)  that  occurs  during  the trial  or within  120 days  of completing  
the trial  completing  the trial,  or 30 days  following  cessation  of treatment  if the subject  initiates  
new  anticancer  therapy,  whichever  is earlier.  All subjects  and female  partners  of male  subjects  
who  become  pregnant  must  be followed  to the completion/termination  of the pregnancy.  
Pregnancy  outcomes  of spontaneous  abortion,  missed  abortion,  benign  hydatidiform  mole,  
blighted  ovum,  fetal  death,  intrauterine  death,  miscarriage  and  stillbirth  must  be reported  as 
serious  events  (Important  Medical  Events).  If the pregnancy  continues  to term,  the outcome  
(health  of infant)  must  also  be reported.  
Such  events  must  be reported  within  24 hours  to the Sponsor-Principal  Investigator  (or 
designee).  It is then  the responsibility  of UCSF  as the Sponsor  to complete  reporting  to Merck  
Global  Safety  (Attn:  Worldwide  Product  Safety;  Fax:  215-993-1220)  and to OncoSec  Medical  
Inc (Attn:  Medical  Monitor;  Email:  safety@oncosec.com).  
Immediate  Reporting  of Adverse  Events  
For the time  period  beginning  when  the consent  form  is signed  until  treatment  
allocation/randomization,  any  serious  adverse  event,  or follow  up to a serious  adverse  event,  
including  death  due to any  cause  other  than  progression  of the cancer  under  study  that  occurs  
to any  subject  must  be reported  within  24 hours  to the Sponsor-Principal  Investigator  and 
within  2 working  days  to Merck  Global  Safety  and to OncoSec  Medical  Inc if it causes  the 
subject  to be excluded  from  the trial,  or is the result  of a protocol-specified  intervention,  
including  but not limited  to washout  or discontinuation  of usual  therapy,  diet,  placebo  
treatment  or a procedure.  
For the time  period  beginning  at treatment  allocation/randomization  through  90 days  
following  cessation  of treatment,  or 30 days  following  cessation  of treatment  if the  subject  
initiates  new  anti-cancer  therapy,  whichever  is earlier,  any  serious  adverse  event,  or follow  up 
to a serious  adverse  event,  including  death  due to any  cause  other  than  progression  of the 
cancer  under  study,  whether  or not related  to any  of the investigational  products,  must  be 
reported within  24 hours  to the Sponsor-Principal  Investigator  (or designee).  It is then  the 
responsibility  of UCSF  as the Sponsor  to complete  reporting  to Merck  Global  Safety  and 
OncoSec  Medical  Inc..

Protocol-Specific  Exceptions  to Serious  Adverse  Event  Reporting  
 
Efficacy  endpoints  as outlined  in this section  will not be reported  to Merck  as described  in 
Immediate  Reporting  of Adverse  Events,  unless  there  is evidence  suggesting  a causal  
relationship  between  the drug and the event.  Any  such  event  will be submitted  to the Sponsor-  
Principal  Investigator  within  24 hours  and to Merck  Global  Safety  and  and to OncoSec  Medical  
Inc. within  2 working  days  either  by electronic  or paper  media.  
Specifically,  the suspected/actual  events  covered  in this exception  include  any  event  that  is 
disease  progression  of the cancer  under  study.  
 
The Sponsor-Principal  Investigator  will monitor  unblinded  aggregated  efficacy  endpoint  
events  and  safety  data  to ensure the  safety  of the subjects  in the trial.  Any  suspected  endpoint  
which  upon  review  is not progression  of the cancer  under  study  will be forwarded  to Merck  
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 66 
 
Global  Safety  and to OncoSec  Medical  Inc.  as a SAE  within  2 working  days  of determination  that  
the event  is not progression  of the cancer  under  study.  
 
Hospitalization  related  to convenience  (e.g.transportation  issues  etc.)  will  not be considered  a 
SAE.  
8 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  AND  EVALUATION  OF RESULTS  
8.1 STUDY  ENDPOINTS  
8.1.1 PRIMARY  ENDPOINT  
Best  overall  objective  response  rate (ORR),  CR + PR, within  24 weeks  of first  treatment  with  
pIL-12  electroporation  and pembrolizumab  will be determined  by RECIST  v1.1  and  compared  
against  historical  response  rates for  pembrolizumab  as a monotherapy  in a similar  population.  
8.1.2 SECONDARY  ENDPOINTS  
Safety  and tolerability  is defined  by assessment  of adverse  events.  These  will  be assessed  using  
the NCI  CTCAE.  
Duration  of response  (DOR)  for those  experiencing  CR or PR is the number  of days  from  the 
initial  documentation  of an objective  response  to the most  current  evaluation  of that  response  
(censored  duration)  or to documentation  of progression.  
Twenty-four  week  landmark  progression  free survival  (PFS  at 24 weeks)  is defined  as the % of  
patients  who  have  either  progressed  or not progressed  at 24 weeks.  
Progression  free  survival  (PFS)  is defined  as the duration  between  the date of  treatment  
initiation  to the first  date  of either  disease  progression  or death.  
Overall  survival  (OS)  is defined  as the duration  between  the date  of treatment  initiation  to the 
date of death,  regardless  of the cause  of death.  
Best  overall  objective  response  rate (ORR),  CR + PR, determined  by immune-related  Response  
Criteria  (irRC).  
8.1.3 EXPLORATORY  ENDPOINTS  
Co-primary  candidate  biomarkers  to be investigated  in this study  include  PD-L1 expression  
levels  assessed  by IHC and TIL profile  assessed  by CD8 T cell density  in tumor  tissue.  Changes  
in PD-L1  expression  will be assessed  pre-  and  post-treatment  using  at least  one of the 
following  IHC-based  assays:  (1) the Merck  developed  PD-L1 IHC  assay  (clone  22C3)  with  a 
stringent  cut-off  negative  of <1% in tumor  or stromal  cells  of the tumor  environment  or (2) an 
assay  developed  by Tumeh/UCLA  [42]  with  a low TIL cut-off  of <600 CD8 cells/mm2.  If tumor  
samples  demonstrate  that  the combination  therapy  converts  tumors  from  low TIL to high  TIL  
but without  a corresponding  increase  in ORR,  then  the hypothesis  that  enhancing  TILs  will 
increase  pembrolizumab  efficacy  can be rejected.  Changes  in other  biomarkers  and  immune  
responses  in tissue  and  blood  will be assessed  for association  with  clinical  outcome  (efficacy  
endpoints).  
 
8.1.4 STUDY  DESIGN  
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 67 
 
This  is a multicenter,  Phase  II, open-label,  42-patient  single-arm  trial  of intratumoral  pIL-12  
EP in combination  with  pembrolizumab  in patients  with  melanoma.  Patients  will be 
evaluated in 2 parts.  Part  A patients  will be selected  using  a flow cytometric  assay  that  
quantifies  intratumoral  PD-1hiCD8+CTLA4+  “exhausted”  lymphocytes  in the tumor.  Part B 
will enroll  patients  who  have  or are failing  pembrolizumab  at least  12 weeks  after  starting  
PD-1  antibody  alone  or in combination,  or, who  have  been  selected  using  a flow cytometric  
assay  that  quantifies  intratumoral  PD-1hiCD8+CTLA4+  “exhausted”  lymphocytes  in the 
tumor.  
 
 
8.1.5 SAMPLE  SIZE AND  POWER  ESTIMATE  
Best  ORR  by RECISTv1.1  within  24 weeks  is the primary  efficacy  endpoint  for this study.  Given 
that  this preliminary  study  is a single-arm  combination  study  with  a historical  comparator,  
the sample  size depends  upon  the presumed  “baseline  pembrolizumab  ORR” in the biomarker  
selected  population.  The assumnption  was  made  that  the false  negative  rate  of the assay  in 
this projected  patient  population  defines  the H0 for the study.  Based  on analysis  of UCSF  
patients  treated  with  pembrolizumab  as a monotherapy,  we estimate  the false  negative  rate  
of the flow  cytometric  assay  as 12.5%.  Therefore,  a 42 patient  study  will meet  the following  
statistical  parameters:  H0 = 12.5%;  Halt = 30%;  alpha  of 0.025  (actual;  one-sided  test);  power  
= 85%. 
 
8.1.6 REPLACEMENT  POLICY  
Patients  who  discontinue  from the study  for reasons  unrelated  to the study  will be replaced as 
required  for the study  to meet  its objectives.  The decision  to remove  a subject/patient  and to 
replace  dropouts  will documented  and made  jointly  by the Sponsor-Principal  Investigator  
and study  statistician.  
 
8.1.7 ACCRUAL  ESTIMATES  
This  study  plans  to complete  enrollment  18 months  after  opening  to accrual.  It is estimated  that  
roughly  half of the patient  population  will have  PD-L1-negative  melanoma  meeting  the 
eligibility  criteria  for enrollment.  Given an estimation  of 100 patients  that  would  be candidates  
for an anti-PD-1  therapy  seen per year  at the primary  clinical  site alone,  completion  of 
enrollment  across  multiple  sites  within  18 months  can be attained.  Recruitment  of other  clinical  
sites  for participation  in this trial  further  supports  achievable  accrual  of 42 evaluable  patients  
within  18 months.  
 
 
8.2  ANALYSES  PLANS  
8.2.1 ANALYSIS  POPULATION  
8.2.1.1 Primary  Analysis  (or Analysis  of Primary  Endpoints)  
 
THE PRIMARY  EFFICACY  ANALYSES  WILL  BE BASED  ON THE  FULL  ANALYSIS  SET (FAS)  
POPULATION . PATIENTS  WITH  MEASURABLE  DISEASE  AT BASELINE , WHICH  IS DEFINED  
SEPARATELY  UNDER  INVESTIGATOR  EVALUATION , WHO  RECEIVED  AT LEAST  ONE  DOSE  OF 
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 68 
 
INTRATUMORAL  PIL-12-EP  AND  PEMBROLIZUMAB  STUDY  TREATMENT  WILL  BE INCLUDED  IN 
THE FAS POPULAT IONSAFETY  ANALYSIS  SETS  
Safety  analysis  set: The safety  analysis  set comprises  all enrolled  patients  who  received  any amount  of 
study  drug.  
 
 
8.2.1.2 Secondary  Analysis  (or Analysis  of Secondary  Endpoints)  
Analyses  of PFS  and  OS are based  on the All Patients  as Treated  (APaT)  population.  The APaT  
population  consists  of all patients  who  received  at least  1 dose  of intratumoral  pIL-12-EP  and 
pembrolizumab  study  treatment.  PFS  and  OS will  also  be analyzed  based  on the FAS.  Analysis  of DOR 
will be based  on patients  that  experience  CR or PR at the time  of disease  evaluations  while  on study.  
Analyses  to satisfy  exploratory  endpoints  will be based  on the All Patients  as Treated  (APaT)  
population,  consisting  of all patients  who  received  at least  1 dose  of study  treatment.  
Future  Biomedical  Research:  
Future  biomedical  research  on blood  and leftover  tumor  biopsy  specimens  will be performed  on 
collected  samples  during  this clinical  trial.  This  research  may  include  genetic  analyses  (DNA),  gene  
expression  profiling  (RNA),  proteomics,  metabolomics  (serum,  plasma)  and/or  the measurement  of 
other  analytes.  This  research  is for biomarker  testing  to address  emergent  questions  not described  
elsewhere  in the protocol  (as part  of the main  biomarker  correlative  objectives).  The objective  is to 
explore  and  identify  biomarkers  that  inform  scientific  understanding  of this  therapeutic  treatment.  
The specimens  will be stored  to provide  a resource  for studies  conducted  by trial  partners  focused  on 
the study  of biomarkers  responsible  for the mechanism  of action  and to answer  emerging  questions  
surrounding  pathway  involvement  or other  aspects  of disease.  It is well  recognized  that  information  
obtained  from  additional  studies  conducted  on clinical  specimens  offers   greater   understanding  of 
patient  response  to therapy  and  the  potential  for development  of  novel  treatments  or enhanced  
targeted  to populations  with  the greatest  need.  
 
8.3  EVALUATION  OF SAFETY  
Analyses  will be performed  for all  patients  having  received  at least  one dose  of study  drug.  The study  
will use  the NCI CTCAE  v4.0  and  guidance  provided  in Section  7.2. 
 
8.4  INTERIM  ANALYSIS  AND  STOPPING  RULES  
An interim  safety  analysis  will be performed  after  15 patients  have  been  treated  on study.  If 5 of these  
15 patients  have  had treatment-related  serious  adverse  events  as defined  in the protocol,  the accrual  
will be stopped  and  the study  will be terminated.  
 
 
8.5  CLINICAL  CRITERIA  FOR  EARLY  TRIAL  TERMINATION  
Early  trial  termination  will be the result  of the criteria  specified  below:  
1. Quality  or quantity  of data  recording  is inaccurate  or incomplete  
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852

9 STUDY  MANAGEMENT  
9.1  PRE-STUDY  DOCUMENTATION  
This  study  will be conducted  in accordance  with  the ethical  principles  that  have  their  origin  in the 
Declaration  of Helsinki  as stated  in 21 CFR §312.120(c)(4);  consistent  with  GCP  and all applicable  
regulatory  requirements.  
Before  initiating  this trial,  the Investigator  will  have written  and dated approval  from  the Institutional  
Review  Board  for the  protocol,  written  informed  consent  form,  subject  recruitment  materials,  and  any 
other  written  information  to be provided  to subjects  before  any protocol  related  procedures  are 
performed  on any subjects.  
The clinical  investigation  will not begin  until  either  FDA  has determined  that  the study  under  the 
Investigational  Drug  Application  (IND)  is  allowed  to proceed  or the Sponsor-Principal  
Investigator  has  received  a letter  from  FDA  stating  that  the study  is exempt  from  IND  requirements.  
The Investigator  must  comply  with  the applicable  regulations  in Title  21 of the Code  of Federal  
Regulations  (21  CFR §50,  §54,  and  §312),  GCP/ICH  guidelines,  and  all applicable  regulatory  
requirements.   The IRB  must  comply  with  the regulations  in 21 CFR  §56 and  applicable  regulatory  
requirements.  
 
9.2  INSTITUTIONAL  REVIEW  BOARD  APPROVAL  
The protocol,  the proposed  informed  consent  form,  and all forms  of participant  information  related  to 
the study  (e.g.  advertisements  used  to recruit  participants)  will be reviewed  and  approved  by the UCSF  
Institutional  Review  Board.   Prior  to obtaining  IRB  approval,  the protocol  must  be approved  by the 
Helen Diller  Family  Comprehensive  Cancer  Center  Site Committee  and  by the Protocol  Review  
Committee  (PRC).  The initial  protocol  and all protocol  amendments  must  be approved  by the IRB  prior  
to implementation.  
 
9.3  INFORMED  CONSENT  
All participants  must  be provided  a consent  form  describing  the study  with  sufficient  information  for 
each  participant  to make  an informed  decision  regarding  their  participation.   Participants  must  sign  
the CHR-approved  informed  consent  form  prior  to participation  in any study  specific  procedure.  The 
participant  must  receive  a copy  of the signed  and  dated  consent  document.  The  original  signed  copy of 
the consent  document  must  be retained  in the medical  record  or research  file.  
Consent  must  be documented  by the subject’s  dated  signature  or by the subject’s  legally  acceptable  
representative’s  dated  signature  on a consent  form  along  with  the dated  signature  of the person  
conducting  the consent  discussion.  
A copy  of the signed  and  dated  consent  form  should  be given  to the subject  before  participation  in the 
trial.  
The initial  informed  consent  form,  any  subsequent  revised  written  informed  consent  form  and any 
writt en information  provided  to the subject  must  receive  the IRB/ERC’s  approval/favorable  opinion  in 
advance  of use.   The  subject  or his/her  legally  acceptable  representative  should  be informed  in a 
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 71 
 
timely  manner  if new  information  becomes  available  that  may be relevant  to the  subject’s  willingness  
to continue  participation  in the trial.  The communication  of this  information  will be provided  and  
documented  via a revised  consent  form  or addendum  to the original  consent  form  that  captures  the 
subject’s  dated  signature  or by the subject’s  legally  acceptable  representative’s  dated  signature.  
Specifics  about  a trial  and  the trial  population  will be added  to the consent  form  template  at the 
protocol  level.  
The informed  consent  will adhere  to IRB/ERC  requirements,  applicable  laws  and regulations  and  
Sponsor  requirements.  
 
 
9.4  CHANGES  IN THE PROTOCOL  
Once  the protocol  has  been  approved  by the UCSF  IRB,  any  changes  to the protocol  must  be 
documented  in the form  of an amendment.  The amendment  must  be signed  by the Sponsor- Principal  
Investigator  and  approved  by PRC  and  the IRB prior  to implementation.  
If it becomes  necessary  to alter  the protocol  to eliminate  an immediate  hazard  to patients,  an 
amendment  may  be implemented  prior  to IRB approval.  In this circumstance,  however,  the Sponsor-  
Principal  Investigator  must  then  notify  the IRB in writing  within  five (5) working  days  after  
implementation.   The Study  Chair and the UCSF  study  team  will be responsible  for updating  any 
participating  sites.  
 
 
9.5  HANDLING  AND  DOCUMENTATION  OF CLINICAL  SUPPLIES  
The UCSF  Principal  Investigator  and  Investigators  at each participating  site will  maintain  complete  
records  showing  the receipt,  dispensation,  return,  or other  disposition  of all investigational  drugs  and 
the EP devices.  The date,  quantity  and batch  or code  number  of the drug,  and the identification  of 
patients  to whom  study  drug  has been  dispensed  by patient  number  and  initials  will be included.  The 
Investigator  will  maintain  written  records  of any  disposition  of the study  drug.  
The Investigator  shall  not make  the investigational  drug available  to any  individuals  other  than  to 
qualified  study  patients.  Furthermore,  the Investigator  will  not allow  the investigational  drug  to be 
used  in any manner  other  than  that  specified  in this protocol.  
 
 
9.6 CASE  REPORT  FORMS  (CRF S) 
The Investigator  and/or  his/her  designee  will  prepare  and  maintain  adequate  and  accurate  
participant  case  histories  with  observations  and  data  pertinent  to the study.  Study  specific  electronic  
Case  Report  Forms  (eCRFs)  will document  safety  and treatment  outcomes  for safety  monitoring  and 
data  analysis.  All study  data  will  be entered  onto  paper  CRFs  or into  Medidata  Rave ® via data  entry  
screens  for eCRFs  in accordance  with  the CTMS  study  calendar,  using  single data  entry  with  a secure  
access  account.   Data  may  be captured  on paper  CRFs  for patients  who  continue  treatment  beyond  24 
months.  The Clinical  Research  Coordinator  (CRC) will  complete  the CRFs  as soon  as possible  upon  
completion  of the study  visit;  the Investigator  will  review  and approve  the completed  eCRFs.  
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 72 
 
The information  collected  on eCRFs  shall  be identical  to that  appearing  in original  source  documents.  
Source  documents  will be found  in the patient’s  medical  records  maintained  by clinical  site.   All source  
documentation  should  be kept  in separate  research  folders  for each  patient.  
In accordance  with  federal  regulations,  the Investigator  is responsible  for the  accuracy  and 
authenticity  of all clinical  and  laboratory  data  entered  onto  eCRFs.   The Investigator  will  approve  all 
completed  eCRFs  to attest  that  the information  contained  on the eCRFs  is true  and accurate.  
All source  documentation  and CTMS  data  will  be available  for review/monitoring  by the UCSF  DSMC  
and regulatory  agencies.  OncoSec  will be the primary  entity  responsible  for monitoring  the data.  
The Investigator  will  be responsible  for ensuring  the accurate  capture  of study  data.   At study  
completion,  when  the eCRFs  have  been  declared  to be complete  and  accurate,  the database  will  be 
locked.   Any  changes  to the data  entered  into the eCRFs  after  that  time  can only  be made  by joint  
written  agreement  among  the Study  Chair,  the Trial  Statistician,  and the Protocol  Project  Manager.  
Each   participating  site will complete  study  specific   CRFs  for safety  monitoring  and data  analysis.  
Each  site  will  enter  the study  data  into Medidata  Rave®  via standardized  CRFs  using  single  data  entry  
with  a secure  access  account.  The participating  site’s  Clinical  Research  Coordinator  (CRC)  will  
complete  the CRFs  (including  any deviations)  within  10 business  days  of the visit;  the Investigator  will  
review  and approve  the completed  CRFs.  Study  data  from the participating  site will  be reported  and  
reviewed  in aggregate  with  data  from  patients  enrolled  at the coordinating  center,  UCSF.  All source  
documentation  and CTMS  data  will  be available  for review/monitoring  as needed.  
 
 
9.7  OVERSIGHT  AND  MONITORING  PLAN  
OncoSec  Medical  Inc.  will  be the monitoring  entity  for this  study.  OncoSec  will be monitoring  the 
patient  and regulatory  data  for this trial  and  providing  the UCSF  DSMC  with  the monitoring  reports  for 
review.  The UCSF  DSMC  will provide  monitoring  oversight.  The  DSMC  will  routinely  review  all adverse  
events  and  suspected  adverse  reactions  consider ed “serious”.  The DSMC  will  audit  study - related 
activities  to ensure  that  the study  is conducted  in accordance  with  the protocol,  local  standard  
operating  procedures,  FDA  regulations,  and  Good  Clinical  Practice  (GCP).   Significant  results  of the 
DSMC  audit  will be communicated  to the IRB  and the appropriate  regulatory  authorities  at the time  of 
continuing  review,  or in an expedited  fashion,  as applicable.   See  Appendix  2 Data  and Safety  
Monitoring  Plan  for additional  information.  
 
 
9.8  MULTICENTER  COMMUNICATION  
The UCSF  Coordinating  Center  provides  administration,  data  management,  and  organizational  support  
for the  participating  sites  in the conduct  of a multicenter  clinical  trial.   The  UCSF  Coordinating  Center  
or designee  (OncoSec  Medical  Inc.)  for Phase  II studies  will also  coordinate,  at minimum,  monthly  
conference  calls  with  the participating  sites  or more  frequently  as needed  to discuss  risk assessment.  
The following  issues  will be discussed  as appropriate:  
• Enrollment  information  
• Adverse  events  (i.e.,  new  adverse  events  and  updates  on unresolved  adverse  events  and  new  
safety  information)  
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852

9.9  RECORD  KEEPING  AND  RECORD  RETENTION  
The Investigator  is  required  to maintain  adequate  records   of  the  disposition  of the  drug,  
including  dates,  quantity,  and  use by  subjects,  as well  as written  records  of the disposition  of the drug  
when  the study  ends.  
The Investigator  is required  to prepare  and maintain  adequate  and accurate  case  histories  that  record  
all observations  and other  data  pertinent  to the investigation  on each  individual  administered  the 
investigational  drug or employed  as  a control  in the investigation.  Case  histories  include  the case  
report forms  and supporting  data  including,  for example,  signed  and  dated  consent  forms   and  
medical  records  including,  for example,  progress  notes   of  the  physician,  the individual's  hospital  
chart(s),  and  the nurses'  notes. The case  history  for each  individual  shall  document  that  informed  
consent  was  obtained  prior  to participation  in the study.  
Study  documentation  includes  all eCRFs,  data  correction  forms  or queries,  source  documents,  Sponsor- 
Principal  Investigator  correspondence,  monitoring  logs/letters,  and  regulatory  documents  (e.g.,  
protocol  and  amendments,  IRB  correspondence  and  approval,  signed  patient  consent  forms).  
Source  documents  include  all recordings  of observations  or notations  of clinical  activities  and all 
reports and records  necessary  for the evaluation  and reconstruction  of the clinical  research  study.  
In accordance  with  FDA  regulations,  the Investigator  shall  retain  records  for a period  of 2 years  
following  the date  a marketing  application  is approved  for the  drug  for the  indication  for which  it is 
being  investigated;  or, if no  application  is to be filed  or if the  application  is not approved  for such  
indication,  until  2 years  after  the investigation  is discontinued  and  FDA  is notified.  
 
 
9.10 COORDINATING  CENTER  DOCUMENTATION  OF DISTRIBUTION  
It is the responsibility  of the Study  Chair  to maintain  adequate  files  documenting  the distribution  of 
study  documents  as well  as their  receipt  (when  possible).  The  HDFCCC  recommends  that  the Study  
Chair  maintain  a correspondence  file and  log for each  segment  of distribution  (e.g.,  FDA,  drug 
manufacturer,  participating  sites,  etc.).  
Correspondence  file:  should  contain  copies  (paper  or electronic)  of all protocol  versions,  cover letters,  
amendment  outlines  (summary  of changes),  etc.,  along  with  distribution  documentation  and (when  
available)  documentation  of receipt.  
Correspondence  log:  should  be a brief  list of all documents  distributed  including  the date  sent,  
recipient(s),  and  (if available)  a tracking  number  and  date received.  
At a minimum,  the Study  Chair  must  keep  documentation  of when  and to whom  the protocol,  its 
updates  and safety  information  are distributed.

IT-pIL12-EP and anti-PD-1 Page 74 
 
Study  personnel  from  all participating  sub-sites  (not  including  UCSF)  must  receive  training  from  UCSF  
or designee  (OncoSec  Medical  Inc.)  before  the site  may  be activated  to enroll  patients.  This  training  
will include,  but is not limited  to, protocol  and  GCP  overview,  AE reporting,  proper  administration  of 
study  treatments,  and  review  of study  objectives  and study  procedures.

10 PROTECTION  OF HUMAN  SUBJECTS  
10.1 PROTECTION  FROM  UNNECESSARY  HARM  
Each  clinical  site  is responsible  for protecting  all subjects  involved  in human  experimentation.  This  is 
accomplished  through  the CHR mechanism  and the process  of informed  consent.  The  CHR reviews  all 
proposed  studies  involving  human experimentation  and ensures  that  the subject’s  rights  and welfare  
are protected  and that  the potential  benefits  and/or  the importance  of the knowledge  to be gained  
outweigh  the risks  to the individual.  The  CHR also  reviews  the informed  consent  document  associated  
with  each  study  in order  to ensure  that  the consent  document  accurately  and clearly  communicates  
the nature  of the research  to be done  and  its associated  risks  and benefits.  
 
 
10.2 PROTECTION  OF PRIVACY  
Patients  will  be informed  of the extent  to which  their  confidential  health  information  generated  from  
this study may  be used  for research  purposes.  Following  this discussion,  they  will be asked  to sign  the 
HIPAA  form and  informed  consent  documents.  The original  signed  document  will become  part  of the 
patient’s  medical  records,  and each patient  will receive  a copy of the signed  document.  The use and 
disclosure  of  protected  health  information  will be limited   to the individuals  described  in the 
informed  consent  document.

APPENDIX  2 DATA  AND  SAFETY  MONITORING  PLAN  FOR  MULTICENTER  INSTITUTIONAL  
STUDY  
(PHASE  2 OR 3 INSTITUTIONAL  STUDY ) 
 
The UCSF  Helen Diller  Family  Comprehensive  Cancer  Center  (HDFCCC)  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
Committee  (DSMC)  is responsible  for monitoring  data  quality  and subject  safety  for all HDFCCC  
institutional  clinical  studies.  A summary  of DSMC  activities  for this study  includes:  
 
 
• Review  of suspected  adverse  reactions  considered  “serious”  
 
 
Monitoring  and  Reporting  Guidelines  
The UCSF  Coordinating  Center  provides  administration,  data  management,  and organizational  
support  for the  participating  sites  in the conduct  of a multicenter  clinical  trial.  The  UCSF  Coordinating  
Center  will also  coordinate  quarterly  conference  calls  with  the participating  sites  to communicate  the 
review  of adverse  events,  safety  data,  and  other  study  matters.  
 
 
The Principal  Investigator  at the UCSF  Coordinating  Center  will hold  the role  of Study  Chair.  The Study  
Chair  is responsible  for the overall  conduct  of the study  and for monitoring  its safety  and progress  at 
all participating  sites.  The Study  Chair  will conduct  continuous  review  of data  and subject  safety  and 
discuss  each  subject’s  treatment  at monthly  UCSF  Site Committee  meetings.  The discussions  are 
documented  in the UCSF  Site Committee  meeting  minutes.  
Multicenter  communication  
The UCSF  Coordinating  Center  provides  administration,  data  management,  and organizational  
support  for the participating  sites  in the conduct  of a multicenter  clinical  trial.  The UCSF  Coordinating  
Center  will also  coordinate,  at minimum,  monthly  conference  calls  with  the participating  sites  at the 
completion  of each  cohort  or more  frequently  as needed  to discuss  risk assessment.  The following  
issues  will be discussed  as appropriate:  
• Enrollment  information  
• Adverse  events  (i.e. new  adverse  events  and updates  on unresolved  adverse  events  and new  
safety  information)  
• Protocol  violations  
• Other  issues  affecting  the conduct  of the study  
Adverse  events  reporting  to the DSMC  will include  reports  from  both  the UCSF  Coordinating  Center,  
as well  as the participating  sites.  The DSMC  will be responsible  for monitoring  all data  entered  in 
OnCore®  at the UCSF  Coordinating  Center  and the participating  sites.  The data  (i.e. copies  of source  
documents)  from  the participating  sites  will be sent electronically  or faxed  over to the UCSF  
Coordinating  Center  prior  to the monitoring  visits  in order  for the DSMC  to monitor  the participating  
site’s  compliance  with  the protocol,  patient  safety,  and  to verify  data  entry.  
Version date: 10-12-2017 Protocol CC#:15852
IT pIL-12 EP and antiPD-1 Page 81 
 
 
 
Adverse  Event  Review  and  Monitoring  
Adverse  Event  Monitoring  
All Grade  3-5 Adverse  Events,  whether  or not unexpected,  and whether  or not considered  to be 
associated  with  the use of study drug,  will be entered  into  OnCore®,  UCSF’s  Clinical  Trial  Management  
System.  
All Grade  3-5 adverse  events  entered  into  OnCore®  will be reviewed  on a monthly  basis  at the UCSF  
Site Committee  meetings.  All clinically  significant  adverse  events  must  be reported to the UCSF  
Coordinating  Center  by the participating  sites  within  10 business  days  of becoming  aware  of the event 
or during  the next  scheduled  quarterly  conference  call,  whichever  is sooner.  The UCSF  Site Committee  
will review  and discuss  the selected  toxicity,  the toxicity  grade,  and the attribution  of relationship  of 
the adverse  event  to the administration  of the study  drug(s)  from  the UCSF  Coordinating  Center  and 
the participating  sites.  
In addition,  all suspected  adverse  reactions  considered  “serious”  must  be entered  in OnCore®  and 
reported to the UCSF  Coordinating  Center  within  1 business  day.  The suspected  adverse reactions  
considered  “serious”  will be reviewed  and monitored  by the  Data   and  Safety Monitoring  Committee  
on an ongoing  basis  and discussed  at the DSMC  meeting,  which  take  place  every six (6) weeks.  
If a death occurs  during  the treatment  phase  of the study  or within  30 days  after  the last 
administration  of the study  drug(s)  and is determined  to be related  either  to the investigational  drug  
or any research  related  procedure,  the Study  Chair  at the UCSF  Coordinating  Center  or the assigned  
designee  must  be notified  within  1 business  day from  the participating  site(s)  and the Study  Chair  
must  then  notify  the DSMC  Chair  or qualified  alternate  within  1 business  day of this notification.  The 
contact  may  be by phone  or e-mail.  
 
 
Increase  in Adverse  Event  Rates  
If an increase  in the frequency   of Grade  3 or 4 adverse  events  (above  the rate reported  in the 
Investigator  Brochure  or package  insert),  the Study  Chair at the UCSF  Coordinating  Center  is 
responsible  for notifying  the DSMC  at the time  the increased  rate  is identified.  The report will indicate  
if the incidence  of adverse  events  observed  in the study  is above  the range  stated  in the Investigator  
Brochure  or package  insert.  
If at any time  the Study  Chair  stops  enrollment  or stops  the study  due to safety  issues,  the DSMC  Chair  
and DSMC  Manager  must  be notified  within  1 business  day via e-mail.  The DSMC  must  receive  a formal  
letter  within  10 business  days  and  the CHR must  be notified.

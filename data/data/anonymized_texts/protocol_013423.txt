1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
Human epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  2 (HER2)  is a highly  valuable  biomarker in breast  cancer,  
and its expression  or gene amplification  directly influences  treatment.  Patients  with HER2  positive  
(HER2+)  breast  cancer  (overexpressed  and/or  gene-amplified) receive  targeted  HER2  therapies  that 
reduce the risk of death  by up to 1/3rd, while  patient  with HER2  negative  (“normal”) (HER2 -) breast  
cancer  do not receive  them.   However,  10-15% of patients with HER2 - primary  malignancies  on 
repeat  central  testing  (after  an initial  test was positive)  appear  to benefit  from  HER2  targeted  adjuvant  
treatment.   This lack of central  confirmation of positive  HER2  status  has led to the hypothesis  that 
some  patients  without  overexpression/amplification may nonetheless  benefit  from  anti-HER2  
therapies.  On the other  hand,  prospective  randomized  trials  that included  patients  with metastases  
known  to only test negative  for HER2  have never  demonstrated benefit  for anti- HER2  therapies.  
Change  in HER2  status  over time and site is a potential confounder and some  studies  suggest  that a 
minority  of patients  with HER2 - primary malignancies  develop HER2+  metastases,  which  would  
then presumably  respond  to HER2  targeted  therapy.   Indeed, there  is evidence  that up to 10-15% of 
HER2 - primary  breast  cancer  patients develop  HER2+  metastases.  Identifying  such patients  non- 
invasively  would  be an example of targeted  imaging  guiding  the choice  of targeted  therapy.  
We hypothesize  that imaging  with a targeted  HER2  radiotracer  will allow  us to identify  patients 
with HER2 - primary  breast  cancers  who develop  HER2+  metastases,  and who may benefit  from  the 
addition  of HER2  targeted  therapy.  
 
The following  schema will be used to test this central  hypothesis: 
 
Pre-protocol  evaluation  & recruitment: Identify  patients with HER2 - primary  breast  cancer  and 
metastases  demonstrable on CT, MR, and FDG  PET 
 
 
Protocol:  Determine  the proportion of patients  with HER2 - primary  breast  cancer  who develop  
imagable HER2+  metastases  using  a targeted HER2  radiotracer.

2.0 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
The aim of this study  is to determine  the proportion of patients  with HER2 - primary  breast  cancer  
who develop  imagable HER2+  metastases  using  a targeted  HER2  radiotracer.  
3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
HER2  
The HER2  receptor  is a 185-kDa transmembrane receptor  tyrosine kinase  that is expressed  in a wide 
variety  of human  epithelial  cancers  including  breast,  bladder, ovarian,  endometrial, cervical, lung,  
stomach,  prostate  as well as head and neck and pancreatic  cancers  1. In preclinical  studies,  HER2  
over-expression has been  found  to contribute  to oncogenic  transformation, tumorigenesis,  and 
metastatic potential 2, 3. In human  breast  cancers,  HER2  is overexpressed  in 20-30% of cases,  and this 
has been  correlated  with resistance to therapy,  shorter  disease - free and overall  survival  in patients 
with this disease 4, 5. The ErbB2/HER2  oncogene  encodes  a transmembrane tyrosine  kinase  receptor  
that belongs  to the epidermal growth  factor  receptor  (EGFR)  family  and plays  an essential  role in 
promoting  cell growth,  migration,  differentiation, proliferation, and survival. The family  is comprised  
of ErbB1  (EGFR/HER1),  ErbB2  (HER2/neu),  ErbB3  (HER3), and ErbB4  (HER4).  Each receptor  has 
an extracellular  domain,  a lipophilic  transmembrane domain,  and an intracellular  tyrosine kinase  
domain.  Activation  of the kinase  occurs  with ligand  binding  and hetero - or homodimerization  of 
these  receptors. Ligand - independent  activation  of HER2  may occur  due to mutations  in HER2  or 
receptor  overexpression 6. Activation plays  a pivotal  role in cell proliferation and survival  7. 
Therefore,  HER2  has become a very important  target  of anticancer  drug development. 
Trastuza mab a nd Pertuzumab 
Trastuzumab  and pertuzumabare humanized  anti-HER2  monoclonal antibodies (Herceptin;  
Genentech,  South  San Francisco,  CA and Perjeta;  Genentech,  South  San Francisco ), that inhibit  the 
growth  of breast  cancer  cells with HER2  over-expression  8. In a landmark  randomized  clinical  trial, 
the addition of trastuzumab  to chemotherapy  improved  response  rates and prolonged survival  for 
patients  with HER2 -overexpressing  metastatic  breast  cancer  9. Large,  multicenter  randomized  
adjuvant  trials  have shown  a 50%  reduction in the risk of recurrence  for women  with HER2+  early  
stage  breast  cancer  treated  with trastuzumab  plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone  10, 11. 
 
Experience  with trastuzumab  and pertuzumab  administration  has shown  that the drug is relatively  
safe. The most  significant  safety signal  observed during  clinical  trials  was cardiac  dysfunction 
(principally  clinically  significant  heart  failure [CHF]),  particularly when  trastuzumab  was given  in 
combination with an anthracycline -containing  regimen.  Much  of the cardiac  dysfunction was 
reversible on discontinuation  of drug.

In addition, during the first infusion  with trastuzumab  and pertuzumab, a  symptom  complex most  
commonly  consisting of fever  and/or  chills  was observed  in approximately 40%  of patients.  The 
symptoms  were  usually  mild to moderate  in severity  and controlled  with acetaminophen,  
diphenhydramine,  or meperidine.  These  symptoms  were  uncommon  with subsequent infusions.  
However,  in the postapproval  setting,  more  severe  adverse  reactions to trastuzumab have been  
reported.  These  have been  categorized  as hypersensitivity reactions  (including  anaphylaxis), infusion  
reactions,  and pulmonary  events.  Rarely,  these  severe  reactions  culminated  in a fatal outcome.  
There  are no adequate  or well-controlled  studies in pregnant  women,  and animal  reproduction studies  
are not always  predictive of human  response.   Therefore,  these  agents  should be used during  
pregnancy  only if the potential  benefit  to the mother  outweighs  the potential risk to the fetus.  In the 
postmarketing setting,  oligohydramnios  (decreased  amniotic fluid)  has been  reported  in women who 
received  trastuzumab  during  pregnancy,  either  in combination with chemotherapy or as a single  
agent.  Given  the limited  number  of reported  cases,  the high background rate  of occurrence  of 
oligohydramnios,  the lack of clear  temporal relationships  between  drug  use and clinical  findings,  and 
the lack of supportive  findings  in animal  studies,  an association between  trastuzumab  and 
oligohydramnios  has not been  established.  Advise  women of childbearing potential  to use effective  
contraceptive  methods  during  treatment and for seven  months  after last dose of trastuzumab.  
Trastuzumab  appears  to be relatively  nonimmunogenic.  Only  1 of 903 patients  evaluated  developed  
neutralizing  antibodies  to trastuzumab.  The development of anti- trastuzumab  antibodies  in this 
patient was not associated with clinical  signs  or symptoms.  
 
 
HER2  Hete ro ge ne ity in Brea st Ca ncer a nd its S ignifica  nce 
 
There  is growing  evidence  that HER2  expression may change  between  the primary  breast  malignancy  
and metastases.12-14 Thus,  knowledge of HER2  status  in the primary  breast  malignancy  may not be 
representative of the metastases.  This is an example of tumor heterogeneity.  Inaccurate  knowledge  of 
HER2  status  in metastases,  due to tumor  heterogeneity,  may lead to suboptimal  treatment of 
metastatic breast  cancer.  
 
Tumor heterogeneity has specific  important  implications  for HER2  negative  (HER2 -) primary  breast  
cancer.  Patients  with HER2  positive  (HER2+)  breast  cancer  (overexpressed  and/or  gene-amplified)  
receive  targeted  HER2  therapies  that reduce  the risk of death  by up to 1/3rd, 9, 10 while  patient  with 
HER2  negative  (“normal”)  (HER2 -) breast  cancer  do not receive  them.  However,  10-15% of patients 
with HER2 - primary  malignancies  on repeat  central  testing  (after  an initial  test was positive)  appear  
to benefit  from  HER2  targeted  adjuvant  treatment.  15 This lack of central  confirmation  of positive  
HER2  status  has led to the hypothesis  that some  patients without  overexpression/amplification may 
nonetheless  benefit  from  anti-HER2  therapies.  On the other  hand,  prospective  randomized  trials  that 
included  patients with metastases  known  to only test negative  for HER2  have never  demonstrated 
benefit  for anti-HER2  therapies.  Change  in HER2  status  over time and site is a potential  confounder  
and some  studies  suggest  that a minority  of patients with HER2 - primary  malignancies  develop

HER2+  metastases,  which would  then presumably  respond  to HER2  targeted  therapy.  Indeed,  there  
is evidence that up to 10-15% of HER2 - primary  breast  cancer  patients develop HER2+  metastases.  14 
 
There  are over 900,000  women  currently  living  with metastatic  breast  cancer,  with more  than 50,000  
diagnosed  each year.16 80% of these  women  have HER2 - primary malignancies.  If 10% of these  
patients  could  respond  to HER2  therapy,  that represents  a current  population of over 72,000  women.  
Identifying  the patients  with HER2 - primary  breast  cancer  who could  benefit  from  the addition  of 
HER2  targeted  therapy  may reduce  breast  cancer  mortality  in tens of thousands  of breast  cancer  
patients.

As HER2  is a critical protein  in many  malignancies,  there  has been  
significant   interest   in  targeted   HER2   imaging.     Several   radionuclide  
agents  have been  developed, such as 68Galium-DOTA-F(ab‟)2- 
trastuzumab  17 and 64Cu -DOTA -trastuzumab  18, but their use  has been  
limited  due to the unique  properties  of antibody distribution of radiotracer 
half- lives.  89Zr-trastuzumab and 89Zr-pertuzumab  overcome   these  
limitations  by combining  the highly  specific  monoclonal antibody  
trastuzumab  with a PET radiotracer (89Zr , half- life 78 hours)  that matches  
the pharmacokinetics of the antibody.  The half- life of 89Zr is long enough  
to allow optimal  antibody biodistribution. This results  in PET/CT  images  
with excellent  visualization of HER2+  lesions  in patients  with HER2+  
metastatic  breast  cancer  (Figure  1). 19 Memorial  Sloan-Kettering Cancer  
Center  (MSKCC)  is one of the few institutions  in the world  with 
experience  in 89Zr-trastuzumab and 89Zr-pertuzumab  production  and pre-

trastuzumab  and 89Zr-pertuzumab  imaging  . If HER2 -targeted  PET/CT  could  identify  HER2 - 
primary breast  cancer  patients who develop  HER2+  metastases,  then HER2  targeted  systemic  therapy  
becomes  a new treatment  option in these  patients.  
 
 
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
The aim of this study  is to determine  the proportion of patients  with HER2 - primary  breast  cancer  
who develop  imagable HER2+  metastases  using  a targeted  HER2  radiotracer.   Determining  this 
proportion  will help ascertain  if there  is value translating  HER2 -targeted  PET/CT  from  a research  
study  to a clinical  study.

Patients  presenting  to the clinic  with metastatic  HER2 - primary  breast  cancer  will have their prior  
pathology and imaging  studies  reviewed  by the PI or another  investigator  to determine  patients  with 
a) biopsy proven  metastatic disease  and b) 5 or more  metastases  demonstrable on the most  recent  CT, 
MR, or FDG  PET/CT.  At least one biopsy proven  site of metastasis  in the medical record  will be 
required  to provide  proof  of metastatic  breast  cancer  for each patient. The most  recent  body  CT, 
body  MR, and FDG  PET/CT  studies  will be reviewed  to determine  the number  of demonstrable 
metastases.  Demonstrable  metastases  will be defined  as lytic or blastic  osseous  metastases  on CT, 
osseous  metastases  on MR, liver metastases  greater  than 1.5cm  in long axis on CT or MR, lymph  
nodes  greater  than 1.5 cm in short  axis on CT or MR, lung metastases  greater  than 1.0 cm in long axis 
on CT or MR, and FDG -avid foci that cannot  be explained as physiologic or inflammatory.  
Preference  will be given  to selecting  patients with increasing  metastatic  burden  on recent  sequential  
imaging  studies, in order  maximize  the likelihood  of patients  with active  metastases.  Patients  must  
have an ECOG  performance  score  of 0-2.24 50 Patients  with HER2 - primary breast  cancer,  biopsy 
proof  of metastatic  disease,  and at least 5 foci of demonstrable  metastases  on recent  clinical  imaging  
modalities will be considered for the protocol. 
HER2  status  will be defined  according  to recently published  ASCO  guidelines,  as described  in "Step  
1" of Section  9.0 "Treatment/Intervention  Plan".  In brief, only patients  that are IHC 0, IHC 1+, or  
IHC 2+ and FISH  < 2.0 on the repeat  testing  or reexamination  will be considered  HER2 - and will 
proceed  to HER2 -targeted  PET/CT.  Patients with repeat  testing  results  of IHC 3+  or IHC 2+ and 
FISH  ≥2.0, will be removed from  the protocol.  
 
Patients  with confirmed  HER2 - breast  cancer  will then undergo  HER2 -targeted  PET/CT.  89Zr- 
trastuzumab  is a novel  radiotracer which  allows  excellent  visualization  of HER2+  lesions.19    89Zr- 
pertuzumab  is a novel  radiotracer  which may allow  for specific  visualization  of HER2+  lesions.  
PET/CT  imaging  with these  novel  radiotracers  will allow  evaluation of all identifiable  malignant  
lesions,  rather  than evaluation of only single  lesions by biopsy.   Avid  lesions will be considered  
suspicious  for HER2+  malignancy.   Following amendment 9, we will use 89Zr-pertuzumab  
preferentially,  unless  unavailable  for a successful  imaging  study.  
 
Patients  with at least one 89Zr-trastuzumab or 89Zr-pertuzumab  avid lesion will be biopsied to confirm  
HER2+  pathology.  From  these  50 patients,  we will determine  the proportion of HER2 - primary 
breast  cancer  patients that express  HER2+  malignancy imagable  by HER2 -targeted  PET/CT.  
Patients  who are recruited  to the protocol, but then drop out prior  to HER2 -targeted  PET/CT,  will be 
replaced  with newly  recruited  patients.  
 
4.3 Intervention  
 
HER2 -targeted  PET/CT  will be performed in HER2 - primary  breast  cancer  patients  to identify  
patients  with  positive  foci suspicious  for HER2+  metastases.  
Timing  of 89Zr-trastuzumab  or 89Zr-pertuzumab  P ET/CT  ima ging: Optimal  time between  tracer  
injection and PET scanning of 89Zr-trastuzumab depends on both clearance of the antibody from the 
blood  pool and counting  statistics.   The optimum  time between  tracer  injection  and 89Zr-trastuzumab

PET scanning  in patients with metastatic  breast  cancer  has been  shown  to be 4-6 days.19 We will 
perform  PET/CT  4-6 days after radiotracer  administration.  
89Zr-trastuzumab  PET/CT  imaging:  89Zr-trastuzumab PET studies  will be performed  as hybrid  
PET/CT  examinations  for attenuation correction, lesion localization,  and availability  of additional CT 
data. 4 to 6 days following radiotracer administration, the patient will be positioned on a GE PET/CT 
scanner,  dedicated  for research  scans  at MSKCC.  The CT component  will be obtained  utilizing  a low 
mA (80 mA) to minimize  radiation exposure.  3D imaging  will be obtained  from  the mid skull  to 
proximal  thighs  (approximately  6-7 bed positions).  89Zr-trastuzumab  or 89Zr-pertuzumab  PET/CT  
images  will be reconstructed  using  iterative  reconstruction,  and displayed  in multiplanar  
reconstruction.  
89Zr-trastuzumab  and 89Zr-pertuzumab  P ET/C  T interp  reta tio n: HER2 -targeted  PET/CT  scans  will be 
interpreted  by two different  nuclear  medicine  experts, both experienced in the use novel  research  PET 
radiotracers.  Physiologic  89Zr-trastuzumab  or 89Zr-pertuzumab  uptake  will be expected  in the blood  
pool,  liver,  spleen,  and kidneys.  Radiotracer uptake  in areas  which are not physiologic  will be graded  
both qualitatively  and semiquantitatively.  For qualitative  scoring,  we will use a score  of five where  1 
= definitely  normal,  2 = probably  normal,  3 = equivocal, 4 = probably  abnormal,  and 5 = definitely  
abnormal.  Semiquantitative  analysis  of tracer  uptake  will be performed for all grade 4 and 5 lesions,  
as well as for apparently  normal  background  liver and background  blood  pool.  Three -dimensional  
regions  of interest  (ROIs)  will be placed  over grade  4 and 5 lesions,  the liver,  and the mediastinal 
blood  pool,  and tracer  uptake  will be quantified  using  standardized  uptake  value  (SUV),  calculated  
as: SUV  = decay  corrected  mean  ROI activity  (μCi/ml) / (injected  dose (μCi)/ body  weight  (g)). 
Both  SUVmax  and SUVpeak  will be recorded  for lesions,  and SUVmax  and SUVaverage  will be 
recorded  for background  measurements.  Only  those  foci qualitatively  scored  conspicuously positive  
by both readers  (scores  of 4 or 5) will be considered  as   “positive”.

signaling.  89Zr is a metallo -radionuclide  with a half- life of 78 hours,  long enough  to allow  favorable  
biodistribution of radiolabeled antibodies. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer  Center  is one of the few 
institutions  in the world  with experience in 89Zr-trastuzumab  a nd 89Zr-pertuzumab  production  and 
imaging.20 MSKCC  has approved   Investigational New  Drug  from  the FDA  for human  89Zr- 
trastuzumab  a nd 89Zr-pertuzumab  imaging  . 
 
89Zr-trastuzumab  and 89Zr-pertuzumab  will be produced  on demand  by the Cyclotron-Radiochemistry 
Core  at MSKCC  (under  the direction  of Dr. Jason  Lewis),  which has experience  in the production of 
these   PET  radiopharmaceuticals.    89Zr-trastuzumab  and  89Zr-pertuzumab   will  be  manufactured

according  to the MSKCC  IND.  The final product  is tested  for sterility,  pyrogenicity,  as well as other  
quality  control  determinants,  including  radionuclide  and radiochemical  purity,  prior to release  and 
administration.  
 
Dose  of 89Zr-trastuzumab and 89Zr-pertuzumab: Patients  will receive  between  37 and 203 Mbq  (1.0 
and 5.5 mCi) of 89Zr-trastuzumab given IV over 5-10 min, depending on radiotracer production 
capacity.  The initial  injected  activity  is expected  to be 185Mbq  (5 mCi) +/- 10% with full radiotracer  
production capacity.  The activity  may be adjusted  downward  in later patients  if imaging  quality  can 
be maintained  at a lower  level  of activtiy.  In order  to optimize  tumor  targeting  radiolabeled 89Zr- 
trastuzumab  will be brought  up to a final mass  dose of 50mg  by adding  non-radiolabeled trastuzumab  
(For example: 185MBq  in 3mg 89Zr -trastuzumab  added  to 47 mg of non-radiolabeled trastuzumab).  
Data in the literature  has shown  that the optimal  mass of trastuzumab  is ~50 mg, in trastuzumab  naïve  
breast  cancer  patients.19 Non-radiolabeled  trastuzumab  and pertuzumab  will be obtained  from  the 
MSKCC  pharmacy.  
 
Please  see section 11.0 for a discussion of 89Zr-trastuzumab and 89Zr-pertuzumab  side effects  and 
radiation safety.

6.2 Subject  Inclusion  Criteria  
 
• Women age > 18 
• Biopsy  proven  HER2   negative  primary  breast  cancer  and biopsy proven  metastatic  
disease.  
• 5 or more  foci of demonstrable metastases  on recent  imaging  modalities (CT, MR,

7.0 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
The recruitment  plan will identify  HER2 - primary  breast  cancer  patients with multiple  metastases  
demonstrable  on recent  clinical  imaging  modalities  (CT, MR, and FDG  PET/CT).  All patients 
recruited  to the protocol  will be women,  as breast  cancer  is primarily  a disease  of women  and the 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

initial  cohort  size of 50 will be too small to generalize  meaningful  results  in a small number  of men. 
Eligible  patients will be approached  to enroll  in the protocol  and provide written  informed  consent.  
 
 
Potential research  subjects  will be identified  by a member of the patient ‟s treatment  team,  the 
protocol  investigator,  or research  team  at Memorial Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  (MSKCC). If the 
investigator  is amember of the treatment  team,  s/he will screen  their patient‟s medical records  for 
suitable research  study  participants and discuss the study  and their potential for enrolling  in the 
research  study.  Potential subjects  contacted  by their treating  physician will be referred  to the 
investigator/research staff  of the study.  
 
The principal investigator  may also screen  the medical records  of patients with whom  they do not 
have a treatment relationship  for the limited  purpose  of identifying  patients who would  be eligible  to 
enroll  in the study  and to record  appropriate contact  information  in order  to approach  these  patients  
regarding the possibility of enrolling  in the study.  
 
During  the initial  conversation between  the investigator/research staff  and the patient, the patient  may 
be asked  to provide  certain  health  information  that is necessary to the recruitment and enrollment  
process.  The investigator/research  staff may also review  portions  of their medical records  at MSKCC  
in order  to further  assess  eligibility. They  will use the information  provided by the patient and/or  
medical record  to confirm  that the patient is eligible  and to contact  the patient  regarding  study  
enrollment.  If the patient  turns  out to be ineligible  for the research  study, the research  staff will 
destroy  all information  collected  on the patient during  the initial  conversation and medical records  
review,  except  for any information  that must  be maintained  for screening  log purposes.  
 
In most  cases,  the initial  contact  with the prospective  subject  will be conducted  either  by the 
treatment  team,  investigator  or the research  staff working  in consultation  with the treatment  team.  
The recruitment process  outlined  presents  no more  than minimal  risk to the privacy  of the patients 
who are screened  and minimal  PHI will be maintained  as part of a screening  log. For these  reasons,  
we seek a (partial)  limited  waiver  of authorization for the purposes  of (1) reviewing  medical records  
to identify  potential  research  subjects  and obtain  information  relevant  to the enrollment  process;  (2) 
conversing with patients  regarding  possible enrollment;  (3) handling  of PHI contained  within  those  
records  and provided by the potential subjects;  and (4) maintaining  information  in a screening  log of 
patients  approached (if  applicable).

9.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN 
 
The aim of this study  is to determine  the proportion of patients  with HER2 - primary  breast  cancer  
who develop  imagable HER2+  metastases  using  a targeted  HER2  radiotracer.  Once a patient is 
confirmed  eligible  for protocol  participation, the following  will occur:  
 
 
Step  1. HER2 -targeted   PET/CT  to  identify   patients  with 89Zr-trastuzumab  or 89Zr-pertuzumab  
positive  foc i susp ic io us for HER2+  metastases.  
 
Patients  with confirmed HER2 - malignancy  from  archived  pathology  samples  will undergo  HER2 - 
targeted  PET/CT  to determine  if the patient  demonstrates 89Zr-trastuzumab  or 89Zr-pertuzumab  
positive  lesions  suspicious  for HER2+  metastases.  Please  see section  4.2 for a discussion of HER2 - 
targeted  PET/CT  imaging  and interpretation.  
 
 
Step 2. Biopsy  to  confirm  HER2+   status  of at least one 89Zr-trastuzumab  or 89Zr-pertuzumab  
metastasis  
 
89Zr-trastuzumab  or 89Zr-pertuzumab  positive  foci will be suspected  of being  HER2+  metastases.  At 
least one of these  foci will be biopsied  to confirm  a HER2+  breast  cancer  metastasis  at the suspected  
site. 
Selectio  n o f b iopsy  targe  t a nd performa  nce o f b iopsy: Biopsies  will be performed  by a fellowship  
trained  oncologic interventional  radiologist,  experienced in ultrasound,  CT, and PET/CT  guided  
biopsies.  In order  to minimize  risk to the patient,  site selection  will be performed  with consultation 
between  the study  PI and the interventional radiologist.  PET and CT images  will be reviewed  to 
determine  the most  accessible  and least invasive  site of suspected  89Zr-trastuzumab or 89Zr-pertuzumab  
avid metastatic  disease.  If the avid lesion is believed  to be amenable to ultrasound  guided  biopsy  
(lymph nodes,  soft tissue  lesions),  then ultrasound  guided  biopsy will be performed. Next,  CT guided  
biopsy will be considered for lesions  determined  to be inaccessible to ultrasound,  but visible  on CT 
(lytic  and sclerotic osseous  lesions,  liver lesions,  lung nodules).  In cases  where  the focus  cannot  be 
localized  by ultrasound  or CT, then a PET/CT  guided  biopsy  will be utilized.  MSKCC  has 
substantial  experience  with PET/CT  guided  biopsy of radiotracer avid foci which  are occult  on CT. 
One-to-three  18-20 gauge  core specimens  will be obtained  for pathologic  analysis  and placed in 
formalin.  If the avid foci are not amenable to biopsy,  due to the risk of the biopsy or any other  risk, 
then biopsy will not be performed. The fellowship  trained  oncologic interventional  radiologist will 
determine  if PT/INR  or other  laboratory  tests shall  be performed  prior to biopsy.  In most  cases  this 
will result in PT/INR  measurement.  
 
If a biopsy  is not performed  because  no avid foci are deemed  amenable  to biopsy, then the patient ‟s 
participation in the protocol  will end at this point.  They  will be counted  as 1 of the 50 patients  to 
undergo  the HER2 -targeted   PET/CT  as part of this study.

Patho  lo gic a na lysis o f b iop sy sa mp les: Pathologic analysis  will be performed  by a board -certified  
breast  pathology  specialist  with more  than 5 years  experience. Standard  Hematoxylin  and Eosin  
slides  will be prepared  and evaluated  to confirm  the presence  of breast  cancer  metastasis  at the 
biopsied  site. Biopsy  proven  breast  cancer  metastases  will then undergo  evaluation for HER2  
expression  by immunohistochemistry,  as described above.  The immunohistochemical  results  will be 
as follows:  0, 1+ = negative  result;  2+ = equivocal  result;  and 3+ = positive  result.  Tissues  with 2+ 
staining  (equivocal)  will go on to analysis  with fluorescent  in situ hybridization (FISH)  for HER2  
amplification as per ASCO  guidelines.  26 FISH  is performed from  paraffin  embedded tissue  using  
FDA -approved  ERBB2  (HER2/NEU)  PathVysion  assay  probes  and procedure.  Green  fluorescence  
represents  CEP17,  while  red fluorescence  represents  Her2.  A HER2/CEP17  ratio of > 2.0 HER2  will 
be considered  positive.  Only  tissues  with 3+ immunohistochemical staining  or tissues  with 2+ 
immunohistochemical  staining  AND  positive  HER2  FISH  will be considered “HER2  positive”. 
These  criteria  for HER2+  breast  cancer  are equivalent  to the recently  published  ASCO  guidelines25. 
If the pathologic analysis of a 89Zr-trastuzumab  avid focus  yields  inconclusive  tissue  or results,  then 
the possibility  of an additional biopsy will be discussed with the patient and the interventional  
radiologist.  
 
Only  patients  with HER2+  metastases  on pathology  will be considered  to have proven  HER2+  
disease  . 
 
 
10.0   EVALUATION  DURING  TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
 
89Zr-trastuzumab  and 89Zr-pertuzumab  PET/CT  scans  will be interpreted  by two different  nuclear  
medicine  experts,  both experienced  in the use novel  research  PET radiotracers.  Physiologic 89Zr- 
trastuzumab  uptake  will be expected  in the blood  pool,  liver,  spleen,  and kidneys.  Radiotracer  uptake  
in areas  which  are not physiologic will be graded  both qualitatively  and semiquantitatively.  For 
qualitative  scoring,  we will use a score  of five where  1 = definitely  normal,  2 = probably  normal,  3 = 
equivocal,  4 = probably  abnormal,  and 5 = definitely  abnormal.  Semiquantitative  analysis  of tracer  
uptake  will be performed  for all grade  4 and 5 lesions,  as well as for apparently  normal background  
liver and background  blood  pool.  Three-dimensional regions  of interest  (ROIs)  will be placed  in 
these  areas  and tracer  uptake will be quantified  using  standardized  uptake  value  (SUV),  calculated as: 
SUV  = decay  corrected  mean  ROI activity  (μCi/ml) / (injected  dose (μCi)/ body  weight  (g)). Both  
SUVmax  and SUVpeak  will be recorded  for lesions,  and SUVmax and SUVaverage  will be recorded  
for background  measurements.  Only  those  foci qualitatively  scored  conspicuously  positive by both 
readers  (scores  of 4 or 5) will be considered as  “positive”.  
 
11.0   TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
89Zr-trastuzumab  and 89Zr-pertuzumab:  These  diagnostic agents  are expected  to have  a very low 
incidence  of adverse  events.  Nevertheless,  patients  will be monitored  closely  for evidence  of adverse  
event,  including  vital signs  and followup  patient  reporting.    If a severe  adverse  effect  (Common

Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  grade  3 or 4) attributable  to 89Zr-trastuzumab  or 89Zr- 
pertuzumab  occurs  in any patient,  then further  use will be suspended  and the protocol  reviewed with 
the MSKCC  Data Safety Monitoring  Committee.  
Less Like ly: Infusion  or allergic reactions,  which may include  fevers  
 
o Chills  
o Tiredness  
o Rashes  
o Hives  
 
Rad ia tio n risk: We will image with 37 and 203 Mbq (1.0 and 5.5 mCi) of 89Zr-trastuzumab or 89Zr- 
pertuzumab.  The effective  dose from  185MBq  of 89Zr-trastuzumab  is estimated  to be 7.4 cGy (see 
Appendix  1).29 A low milliampere  CT scan,  performed  as part of the hybrid  89Zr-trastuzumab  
PET/CT,   has  an effective   dose  of 0.9  rem.    The  effective   dose  from   the  experimental  89Zr- 
trastuzumab  PET/CT  examination is 8.3 rem, which  is comparable  to the dose from  other  
radiolabeled  antibodies received  by oncology  patients  in MSKCC  clinical  trials. 
 
Pregna  nc y risk: Even  low diagnostic  levels  of radiation,  such as those  that will be received  in this 
protocol  from  the investigational PET/CT  studies,  are associated  with a risk of inducing  childhood  
cancer.  HER2  targeted  systemic  therapy  could  have additional  pregnancy  risks. A negative  
pregnancy  test will be required  before patient  accrual  to this protocol. Patients on this protocol  will 
be advised  not to become  pregnant  during the time period  of the protocol.  
 
Biopsy  risk s: Minimally  invasive  biopsy  procedures  are selected  to minimize  the risk to patients;  
however,  risks cannot  be eliminated.  Risks  from  biopsies include  pain,  bleeding,  infection,  and need 
for additional procedures.  Risks  may vary based  on site of biopsy.  Most  biopsies  will be of lymph  
nodes or bones.  
 
 
12.0   CRITERIA  FOR  THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
There  are no criteria  for therapeutic  response.  This protocol  will identify  previously unknown  
HER2+  metastases  in presumed HER2 - breast  cancer  patients.  
 
 
13.0     CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
• Patients  may withdraw  from  the protocol  voluntarily  at any time.  
• Development  of unacceptable  toxicity.  
• The patient  is found  to be ineligible  for the protocol  as designated  in the section on Criteria 
for Patient/Subject  Eligibility.

14.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
50 patients  with HER2 - primary  breast  cancer  will undergo  89Zr-trastuzumab  or 89Zr-pertuzumab  
targeted  scanning,  with an expected  accrual  rate of 2-3 patients  per month.  All lesions  with  uptake  
will be noted  and, among patients with  uptake,  at least one lesion per patient  will be biopsied to 
confirm  HER2+  pathology.  We expect  5-10 patients  will have at least one such lesion,  based  on a 
previous  study  that estimated  this proportion  as 12 % in biopsy samples,  which is limited  compared 
with our whole  body  imaging.  We will report  the proportion  of patients with at least one 
pathologically verified  HER2+  lesion  along with its 95% exact  binomial  confidence  interval  with an 
anticipated  half- width of 14%.  We note that this is a lower  bound  to the proportion of patients  with 
HER2+  metastases  from  a HER2 - primary.  To prevent  unnecessary imaging,  we will perform  an 
interim  analysis  after 23 patients are imaged.  If none of the 23 patients has a pathologically verified  
HER2  positive  metastasis,  then we will stop the trial. The probabilities  of stopping  the trial are 5% 
and 63% if the proportions of patients with pathology verified  HER2  positive  lesions are 12% and 
2%. To precent  unnecessary  biopsies  we will perform separate  interim  analyses  using  the data from  
patients  who had a biopsy following  positive    imaging.  This is especially a concern  if there  are more  
patients  with uptake than expected.  Since  the number  of biopsied patients is not known  at this stage  
we implement  this decision  rule in a rolling  fashion:  if 5 or more  of the first 8 biopsied patients have 
no pathologically confirmed  HER2+  disease,  then HER2 -targeted  imaging  will be deemed  
insufficiently specific and the study  will stop to prevent  unnecessary  biopsies.  If the study  continues  
beyond  the first 8 biopsied  patients, then a second  interim  look will take place at 15 biopsied patients  
(if reached).  If 7 or more  of these  15 patients have no pathologically confirmed  HER2+  disease, then 
we will stop the study. Based  on this rule the probability  of stopping  the study  is 90% if the true 
proportion  of HER2+  disease  in biopsied patients  is 50%.  The probability  of stopping  decreases  to 
20% if the true proportion of HER2+  disease in biopsied patients  is 75%.  
 
 
15.1 RESEARCH PARTICIPANT REGISTRATION AND RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURES

A research  study  assistant  (RSA)  will be assigned  to this study.  The responsibilities of the 
RSA  include  project  compliance,  data collection, and entry,  data reporting,  regulatory 
monitoring, problem resolution and prioritization, and coordination of activities of the 
protocol  study  team.  The data collected  from  this study  will be entered  into a secure  
database.  Source  documentation will be available  to support  the computerized patient  record.  
 
16.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient  accruals  and completeness of 
registration  data. Routine data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  data and 
inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates  and extent  and accuracy  of evaluations and follow -up will be 
monitored  periodically throughout  the study  period and potential problems will be brought  to 
the attention  of the study  team  for discussion  and action.  
16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  
were approved by the National  Cancer  Institute  in September  2001.  The plans  address  the new 
policies  set forth  by the NCI in the document  entitled  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  Institute  
for Data  and Safety  Monitoring  of Clinical  Trials” which can be found  at: 
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html. The DSM Plans at MSKCC were 
established  and are monitored  by the Office of Clinical  Research.  The MSKCC  Data and 
Safety Monitoring Plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at: 
http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm. 
 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by which  clinical  trials  are monitored  for data, safety  
and quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic response,  and staff education 
on clinical  research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus there  are two 
institutional  committees  that are responsible for monitoring the activities  of our clinical  trials  
programs.  The committees:  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and 
II clinical  trials,  and the Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III clinical  
trials, report  to the Center ‟s Research  Council  and Institutional  Review  Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development and review  process,  each protocol  will be assessed  for its 
level  of risk and degree  of monitoring required. Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  
in- house  sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) Will be addressed  and 
the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation. 
The protocol  will be conducted  in accordance  with the protocol  submitted  to and approved  by 
the United  States  Army Medical  Research  and Materiel  Comman d‟s (USAMRMC)  Office of 
Research  Protections (ORP),  Human  Research  Protection Office (HRPO).  
Accurate and complete study  records  will be maintained  and made  available  to representatives  
of the U.S. Army  Medical  Research  and Materiel  Command as a part of their responsibility to 
protect  human  subjects  in research.  Research  records  will be stored  in a confidential  manner  
so as to protect  the confidentiality  of subject  information.

Guidance  for the Requirement  of a Research  Monitor  
Per DoD  Directive 3216.02, all greater  than minimal  risk studies  require  a Research  Monitor.  
The USAMRMC  ORP  HRPO  also reserves  the authority  to require  assignment  of a Research  
Monitor  for those  protocols  assessed  as presenting  no greater  than a minimal  risk to the 
subjects  participating in the study.  
Responsibilities  of the Research  Monitor  
The research  monitor  is required  to review all unanticipated  problems  involving  risk to 
subjects  or others,  serious adverse  events  and all subject  deaths  associated  with the protocol  
and provide  an unbiased  written  report  of the event.  
Research  Monitor:  David  Hyman,  MD 
Dr. Hyman  will serve  as an independent  clinical  monitor  of the research  trial and oversee  the 
conduct  and expectations  of fulfilling  its research  goals  and obligations. He will be meeting  
with the Principal Investigator  to review  any relevant toxicities incurred  by patients and to 
determine  whether  the study  accrual  is being  conducted  in a timely and efficient manner.  Dr. 
Hyman is a qualified  physician, other  than the Principal Investigator,  not associated with this 
particular  study,  able to provide  medical care to research  subjects  for conditions  that may 
arise during  the conduct  of this study,  and will monitor  the subjects  during  the conduct  of the 
study.  As the research  monitor,  Dr. Hyman: 
• May discuss  the research  protocol  with the investigators,  interview  human  subjects,  
and consult  with others  outside of the study  about  the research;  
• Shall  have authority  to stop the research  protocol  in progress,  remove  individual  
human  subjects  from  the research  protocol, and take whatever  steps  are necessary  to 
protect  the safety  and well-being  of human  subjects  until the IRB can assess  the 
monitor ‟s report;  
• Shall  have the responsibility to promptly report  their observations  and findings  to the 
IRB or other  designated  official  and the HRPO.  
 
 
17.1 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
Participation in this trial is voluntary.  All patients will be required  to sign a statement of informed  
consent,  which  must  conform  to IRB guidelines.  
 
Confidentiality: All patient  records  will be kept as confidential  as is possible under  the law. No 
individual  identifiers  will be used in any reports  or publication  resulting  from  this study,  but the data 
will be used in the interest  of the ongoing research.  
 
Benefits:  HER2  targeted  therapy  reduces  the risk of death  by 1/3rd in appropriately selected  HER2+  
breast  cancer  patients.  This protocol  attempts  to identify  breast  cancer  patients  with HER2 - primary  
tumors  that develop  HER2+  metastases.    Patients  with newly  identified  HER2+   metastases   may

benefit  from  the addition of HER2  target  therapies  to their treatment  regimen.  There  is no guarantee  
of any benefit.  
 
Incentives:  No incentives  will be offered  to patients/subjects for participation in the study.  
 
Costs:  The research  89Zr-trastuzumab  radiotracer and 89Zr-trastuzumab  PET/CT  scan will be 
performed  without  charge.  Biopsies  resulting  from  the 89Zr-trastuzumab  PET/CT  scan will be 
performed  without  charge.  Pathological examinations performed  as part of this protocol  will be 
performed  without  charge.  If HER2+  metastases  are discovered  as part of this protocol,  then HER2  
targeted  therapy  will be performed  according  to current  standards  of care for HER2+  breast  cancer  
and the patient  will be charged  for this therapy.  The patient  will be responsible for the costs  of 
standard  medical care.  
 
Alternatives: The patient can choose  not to be on this study  and follow  the treatment outlined  by his 
or her treating physician. 
 
Treatment and Compensation: If the patient  is injured  as a result  of participating in this study,  
emergency care, hospitalization,  and outpatient care will be made  available  by the hospital  and billed  
to the patient and his insurance  company as part of his medical expenses.  If the patient  desires  
additional information  about  the consent  process,  research  patient ‟s rights,  or research -related  injury,  
he/she  may call the Patient Representative ‟s office  at (212)  639-8254.  
 
17.2 Privacy  
 
MSKCC‟s  Privacy  Office  may allow  the use and disclosure  of protected  health information 
pursuant  to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization form.  The use and disclosure  of 
protected  health information  will be limited  to the individuals  described in the Research  
Authorization form.  A Research  Authorization form  must  be completed  by the Principal 
Investigator  and approved  by the IRB and Privacy Board  (IRB/PB).  
17.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious if it results  in ANY  of the following  outcomes: 
 
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  
hospitalization 
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death, be  life threatening,  or

Number of sites:  Approximately 15  
Study period s: 
Screening: 28 days  
Double -blind Treatment: 18 weeks  
Follow -up: 30 days (after last dose of study drug)  Phase of development: 2 
Study Design:  This is a multi center, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group  study 
comparing multiple doses of investigational product (HTD1801) to placebo. Upon confirmation of 
eligibility, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to HTD1801 500 mg twice daily (BID), HTD1801 
1,000 mg BID, or placebo BID for 18 weeks.  
Objectives:  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of HTD1801 on liver fat content (LFC) in 
adults with NASH and T2DM . 
The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate:  
1. The effects of HTD1801 on hemoglobin A1c  (HbA1c)  and glucose metabolism ; 
2. The effects of HTD1801 on lipid profile ; 
3. The effects of HTD1801 on liver associated enzymes ; 
4. The effects of HTD1801 on biomarkers of liver inflammation and fibrosis ; 
5. The effects of HTD1801 on  bile acid homeostasis ; 
6. The safety and t olerability of HTD1801.  
Methodology:  This is an 18 -week randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, proof -of-concept, and 
dose-ranging  study comparing multiple doses of HTD1801 to placebo. Clinic visits for efficacy 
assessments and safety monitoring will occur at Week 2, then every 4 weeks throughout the 
Double -Blind Treatment Period. A follow -up safety telephone contact will take place at least 30 days 
after the last dose of study drug.  An interim analysis will be conducted once a minimum of 51 subjects 
complete the assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint.  An independent Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board will provide additional safety  oversight.  
Number of subjects (planned):  Approximately 117 
Inclusion criteria:  
1. Male or female between 18 and 75 years of age.  
2. Clinical diagnosis of NASH with at least stage F1 fibrosis as evident by:

Analysis of Primary Endpoint:  
The primary endpoint is absolute change from Baseline to Week 18 in LFC, or absolute change from 
Baseline to the Early Termination (ET) visit for subjects who terminate the study prematurely. Absolute 
change from Baseline in LFC will be assessed  by analysis of covariance that includes the effects of 
treatment group, Baseline LFC, and Basel ine ALT.  Comparison of  each active treatment group to 
placebo will be tested at the 5% level of significance without adjustment for multiple tests.  Secondarily, 
comparison of  the 2 active treatment groups with each other will be tested at the 5% level . 
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints:  
Relative (percent)  change from Baseline in LFC will be analyzed by the same model described for the 
primary endpoint.  Normalization of LFC will be analyzed by logistic regression that includes the effects 
of treatment group,  Baseline LFC, and Baseline ALT.  
All additional secondary endpoints are continuous and each will be assessed  by analysis of covariance 
that includes treatment group and the Baseline value  of the analysis variable.  All secondary analyses 
(except LFC) will have missing Week 18 values imputed using a multiple imputation procedure for all 
subjects with an available measurement prior to Week 18.  
Safety Evaluatio n 
Safety Endpoints:  
Adverse events and changes in physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical 
laboratory values  will be used to evaluate safety and tolerability. Adverse event incidence will be 
assessed during the Double -Blind Treatment Period. Ad verse event type, relationship, severity, onset, 
and duration will be presented by treatment group within the Double -Blind Treatment Period.  
Safety Analysis:  
Changes in physical examination, vital signs, ECG, and clinical laboratory values will be prese nted using 
summary statistics. Numbers and percentages of the first occurrence for each adverse event will be 
presented.  
Sample Size:  
An absolute change in LFC of 5% as measured by MRI -PDFF has been reported to be the minimal 
clinically relevant difference b etween active treatment and placebo that correlates with histological 
improvement in NASH  (Loomba et al., 2015 , Patel et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, Harrison  and colleagues  
reported  a pooled standard deviation  of 6.3%  for changes from Baseline in LFC  (Harrison et al., 2018 ). 
Based on this standard deviation, 35 subjects in each treatment group will provide 90% power to show 
a difference of 5  percentage points  between any 2 treatment groups at the 5% level of significance.  To 
allow for a dropout rate of 10%, 39 subjects will be randomized to each of the 3 treatment groups.  An 
interim analysis will be conducted after a minimum of 51 subjects  complete the assessment of the 
primary efficacy endpoint to assess sample size assumptions and futility through conditional power; the 
study will not be stopped for efficacy.

 Page 19 1.0 INTRODUCTION  
HTD1801 is a novel salt formed between berberine (B BR) and ursodeoxycholic acid 
(UDCA) with a stoichiometr y of 1:1.  HTD1801  is currently being developed  as an oral 
treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) . HTD1801 is expected to dissociate 
into BBR  salt and UDCA after oral administration, which suggests that the efficacy 
and safety profiles of HTD1801 can be predicted by thos e of the individual components  
(see Section 1.1.1.1 ). 
Berberine  and UDCA have displayed wide -ranging biologic activ ity relative to liver 
dysfunction in no nclinical and clinical settings, including immunomodulatory, 
anti-inflammatory, anti -fibrotic, anti -microbial, and hepatoprotective  effects . 
Furthermore, their effects on serum lipid, hepatic lipid, and /or glucose metabolism , all 
of which are implicated in the pathogenesis  of NASH, have been well studied and 
reported in the literature.  
Given  the reported hepatotherapeutic mechanisms of BBR and UDCA , the 
pharmacologic profile of HTD1801 (see Section 1.1.1.2 ) may offer patients with 
NASH a safe and effective therapy.  HighTide Biopharma Pty. Ltd. (HighTide) is 
conducting t his proof -of-concept (POC) study  to evaluate HTD1801 in adults with 
NASH and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)  by assessing changes in liver fat content 
(LFC) over 18 weeks . 
1.1 BACKGROUND  
1.1.1 Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis  
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is a progressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease 
(NAFLD) characterized by the presence of hepatic steatosis and inflammation with 
hepatocyte injury ( i.e., ballooning) with or without fibrosis. While the prevalence of 
NAFLD in the general population is estimated at 20 -30%,  NASH has been reported to 
affect approximately 5%  of the general population . It is generally agreed that patients 
with NASH can exhibit histological progression to cirrhotic -stage disease. 
Furthermore, several studies have reported that the most common ca use of death in 
patients with NAFLD/NASH is cardiovascular disease, w hile patients specifically 
with NASH have an increase d liver -related mortality rate  (Chalasani et al., 2012 , NICE 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 HighTide Biopharma Pty. Ltd.  
 HTD1801  
Clinical Protocol  IND 139 502 
 
 
 Page 20 2016 ). The most common comorbidities associated with NASH are reported to includ e 
obesity, T2DM, insulin resistance, hypertension,  and dyslipid emia  (Rinella 2015 ). 
It is hypothesized that different pathogenic factors lead to “multiple hits” during the 
disease progressio n from hepatic steatosis to the hepatic inflammatory  and 
hepatocellular damage components that define NASH  (Adams and Angulo 2006 , 
Weiss et al., 2014 ). Accumulation of hepatic fat  linked to insulin resistance  is 
considered the “first hit.”  Hyperinsulinemia i n the context of insulin resistance leads 
to an increased release of free fatty acids from adipocytes and myocytes, which are then 
absorbed by and accumulate in the liver  result ing in steatosis . Insulin resistance also 
promotes de novo  triglyceride synthesis  within the liver and inhibits fatty acid oxidation 
thereby promoting triglyceride  accumulation  (Adams and Angulo 2006 ). Additional 
oxidative injury has been proposed as a “second hit,” which manifests the 
necroinflammatory component of steatohepatitis . Factors associated with obesity and 
metabolic syndrome, such as i ncreased circulating free fatty acids , excess iron, and 
intestinal bacterial overgrowth , increase levels of reactive oxygen species and produce 
cytotoxic aldehydes , which further contribute to oxidative stress and promote 
hepatocyte injury, inflammation , and apoptosis  (Basaranoglu et al., 2013 ). As 
hepatocyte injury becomes repetitive and repair dysregul ated, the liver’s normal 
wound -healing process stalls during tissue reconstruction  and progression to fibrosis 
and cirrhosis ensues  (Diehl an d Day 2017 ). 
Despite the investigation of multiple therapies, there are no approved drugs for the 
treatment of NAFLD, or more specifically, NASH. Currently, weight loss is the only 
therapy with reasonable evidence suggesting that it is s afe, beneficial,  and may result  in 
improved histologic features of NASH. Many patients , however,  do not 
achieve  or cannot maintain goals of lifestyle modification for a long -term period  
(Vilar -Gomez et al., 2015 ). Novel pharmacologic therapies that comprehensively 
ameliorate the pathological spectrum of NASH are therefore needed.  
1.1.1.1  Berberine  and Ursodeoxycholic Acid  
Berberine  is an isoquinoline alkaloid found in many different plants, with a long history 
of use in tr aditional Chinese medicine  (Caliceti et al., 2016 , Kumar et al., 2015 ).  
Berberine chloride  (BBR·Cl) is an approved antiseptic drug in China, Japan, and 
Taiwan. In the U nited States (US)  and Australia, BBR is widely used in various dietary  
supplements for a number of advertised health benefits and is grandfathered under the 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 HighTide Biopharma Pty. Ltd.  
 HTD1801  
Clinical Protocol  IND 139 502 
 
 
 Page 21 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA)  in the US  (Council for 
Responsible Nutrition 1998 ). The reported multi -spectrum activity of BBR, including 
effects on glucose and lip id metabolism, hepatic steatosis , oxidative stress, 
inflammat ion, and  fibro sis suggests that BBR has the potential to treat NAFLD/NASH. 
Furthermore, clinical studies of BBR for the treatment of T2DM , hyperlipidemia, 
hypertension, and NAFLD  have yielded fa vorable results  (Cicero and Ertek 2009 , Lan 
et al., 2015 ). 
Ursodeoxycholic acid is a secondary bile acid produced by intestinal bacteria as a 
metabolic by -product, which is approved by the US Food and Dr ug Administration 
(FDA) for the non -surgical treatment of cholesterol gallstone dissolution (Actigall®, 
NDA 019594 ) and the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) (URSO 250® and 
URSO Forte®, NDA 020675 ). Similar to BBR, UDCA activity is reported to include 
anti-oxidative stress, anti -inflammatory, anti -apoptotic, and anti -fibrotic effects , as 
well as improvement in liver injury caused by microbial dysbiosis . In the clinical 
setting, favorable  results were reported for UDCA combination therapy compared  to 
UDCA monotherapy in  the treatment of NASH  (Xiang et al., 2013 ). 
Based on the pharmacological properties and clinical evaluation s of BBR and UDCA  
relative to  NASH and conditi ons that are most commonly attributed to its development, 
BBR and UDCA may present as good “partners” for effectively treating this advanced 
liver disease.  More information about the activity, safety, and efficacy of BBR  and 
UDCA  can be found in the HTD180 1 Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.1.1.2  HTD1801  
HTD1801  is expected to demonstrate a multi -functional pharmacologic  profile 
reflecting the individual actions of its active components, BBR and UDCA . These 
agents target multiple aberrant pathways that may contribute to the pathogenesis of 
NASH . The beneficial effects of HTD1801 in patients with  NASH are expected to 
include, but may not be limited to:  
• Improved insulin resistance and regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism ; 
• Reduction of fat deposition in the liver ; 
• Restoration of the intestinal barrier function ;

 Page 22 • Anti-inflammatory, anti -oxidative, and anti -apoptotic effec ts; 
• Anti-fibrotic effects.  
Given the unique pharmacologic  profiles of BBR and UDCA, both additive and 
synergistic effects are expected to occur when the 2 products are administered together 
as HTD1801.  More information about the activity, safety, and effic acy of HTD1801  
can be found in the HTD1801 Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.1.2 Nonclinical Studies  
The pharmacology of HTD1801 was evaluated in vivo  in rodent and primate models of 
hyperlipidemia/NAFLD : 
• HTD1801 was evaluated in a  pilot study of high-fat diet-induced Golden Syrian 
hamsters . After 8 week s, hamsters administered  HTD1801 100 mg/kg or a 
physical mixture of BBR·Cl and UDCA 100 mg/kg (molar ratio of 1:1) had 
decreased serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride s, and 
malondialdehyde compared to those of a model (untreated) control group ; 
however,  the effects were enhanced with HTD1801 compared to the physical 
mixture of BBR·Cl and UDCA. Hamsters treated with the physical mixture of 
BBR·Cl and UDCA also exhibited greater decreases in body weigh t and more 
serious adverse effects than the group treated with HTD1801.  
• HTD1801 was further evaluated in a high -fat diet -induced Golden Syrian  hamster 
model of hyperlipidemia/NAFLD.  At doses of 50 mg/kg or 200 mg/kg 
administered intragastrically for 7 weeks , HTD1801  significantly reduced serum 
levels of TC, triglyceride , and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL -c), the 
ratio of TC/ high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL -c), and the atherosclerotic 
index value, as well as the ris k of atherosclerosis, in a dose -dependent manner. 
Hepatic lipidosis and body lipidosis also were significantly reduced, while 
hepatic  inflammation was ameliorated.  
• HTD1801 was evaluated in mal e Rhesus  monkeys with naturally -occurring 
NAFLD.  Study results indicated a dose -dependent reduction of liver steatosis. At 
30 mg/kg (equivalent to a clinical proposed dose of 1 ,050 mg/70 kg person/day) , 
HTD1801  significantly reduced liver steatosis, while a t 15 mg /kg (equivalent to 
a clinical proposed dose of 525 mg/70 kg person/day) , a decreasing trend in 
CONFIDENTIAL

 Page 23 steatosis was observed after 69 days of administration. Significant lowering of  
LDL -c, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
level s was noted , while a treatment -related decreasing trend was observed for TC, 
apolipoprotein B, and blood glucose levels.  
The nonclinical toxicity profiles of both BBR and UDCA have been extensively 
documented . A full International Conference on  Harmonisati on (ICH) M3 battery of 
nonclinical studies of UDCA was submitted in support of NDA 020675 . The toxicity 
profile of BBR was assessed in a battery o f nonclinical studies conducted and/or 
revie wed by the National Toxicology P rogram. These studies include single -dose oral 
studies in mice and rats, in vitro  and in vivo  genotoxicity studies, and reproductive  and 
developmental to xicity studies in mice and rats  (National Toxicology Program 2002 , 
2003c , a, b, 2010 ). 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicity profile s of HTD1801 have been evaluated in 
both rats a nd dogs. T oxicology studies of up to 2 weeks  in rats (non -GLP) and up to 
13 weeks in dogs (GLP)  have been conducted . Combined administration of BBR and 
UDCA as HTD1801 yield ed PK and toxicity profiles similar t o those  of the individual 
components UDCA and BBR. In addition, a 13-week GLP dog study provided data to 
qualify the toxicity profile of BBR  in non -rodents and the safety of the combination of 
BBR  and UDCA when administered as HTD1801.  
Available nonclinica l study data for HTD1801, together with cumulative nonclinical 
study data and clinical experience for BBR and UDCA individually, support  the safety 
and tolerability  of HTD1801 for this  POC study.  More information about the 
nonclinical evaluation of HTD1801  can be found in the HTD1801 Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
1.2 STUDY RATIONALE  
1.2.1 Rationale for Study Design  
This 18 -week randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, POC , dose -ranging study will 
compare  multiple doses of HTD1801 to placebo.  A randomized, double -blind design 
will enhance study rigor and qualit y relative to assessment of the pre -specified 
endpoints (see Section 3.4). In the absence of approved or recognized therapeutics for 
NASH , a placebo control group will be utilized , as has been reported for  several prior

Clinical Protocol  IND 139 502 
 
 
 Page 24 randomized, placebo -controlled assessments of various pharmacologic agents  
(Loomba et al., 2008 ). 
Since accumulation of hepatic fat is considered the “first hit” in the pathogenesis of 
NASH  (Adams and Angulo 2006 ), change in LFC by magnetic resonance 
imaging -estimated proton density fat fraction (MRI -PDFF) is an appropriate  primary 
endpoint and is consistent with that used in recent Phase 2 POC studies in NASH  
(Harrison et al., 2018 , Madrigal Pharmaceuticals 2018 ). 
1.2.2 Rationale for Dose and Duration  
Ursodeoxycholic acid  is approved by the US FDA at a dose of 13 -15 mg/kg/day  (URSO 
250® and URSO FORTE®), or approximately  1 g/day for a 70 kg individual . Berberine  
is widely used in dietary supplements in the US at a recommended dose of 
17-33 mg/kg/day , or approximately  1-2 g/day  for a 70 kg individual . Furthermore, New 
Tantose A®, an over -the-counter combination inc luding BBR (adult dose of 
0.300  g/day) an d UDCA (0.030 g/day), has been approved in Japan for acute diarrheal 
illness  (New Tantose A®), while the therapeutic dosage in most of BBR’s clinical 
experience  is around 0.4 -2.7 g/day orally  for expos ures up to 181 days  (Cicero and 
Ertek 2009 , Lan et al., 2015 ). As shown in Table 3, the UDCA and BBR  content of 
HTD1801 are comparable to doses associated with clinical safety .

b Safety at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day is supported by the published literature for PBC patients  
(Angulo et al., 1999 ). 
c Therapeutic dosage in most of BBR’s clinical experience  (Cicero and Ertek 2009 , Lan et al., 
2015 ). 
d HTD1801 dose of 2 ,000 mg/day is equivalent to 1 ,022 m g/day BBR and 1 ,078 mg/day UDCA.  
Furthermore, data from a f irst-in-human , single  ascending dose  study of HTD1801 in 
healthy subjects  (Protocol HTD1801.PCT002) demonstrated dose proportionality for

 Page 25 UDCA and BBR exposure parameters  at orally administered HTD1801 doses of 
0.5-4.0 g/day. Single doses of HTD1801 were also safe and well tolerated . 
Lastly,  recent Phase 2 POC studies in NASH  (Harrison et al., 2018 , Madrigal 
Pharmaceuticals 2018 ) show  clinically meaningful absolute and relative reductions in 
LFC assessed by MRI -PDFF over 12 -week treatment periods. An 18 -week HTD1801 
treatment period is therefore adequate to assess the study’s primary endpoint  and to 
maximize collection of  exposure and safety related data.

This multi center , randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, POC  and dose -ranging 
study will compare  multiple doses of HTD1801 to placebo. Upon confirmation of 
eligibility, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to  receive 1 of 2 doses of 
HTD1801 or placebo for 18 weeks.  
Subjects will receive 500 mg HTD1801 , 1,000 mg HTD1801,  or placebo  (collective ly, 
the study drug or study drugs) , administered twice daily (BID) during the 18-week 
Double -Blind Treatment Period.  Clinic visits for efficacy assessments and safety 
monitoring will occur at Week 2, then every 4 weeks throughout the Double -Blind 
Treatment  Period. A follow -up safety telephone contact for an assessment of adverse 
events (AEs) and concomitant medications will take place at least 30 days after the last 
dose of study drug.  An interim analysis will be conducted after a minimum of 51 
subjects com plete the assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint to assess sample size 
assumptions and futility through conditional power; the study will not be stopped for 
efficacy.  An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board  (DSMB)  will provide 
additional safety oversight.  
3.2 DURATION OF SUBJECT PARTICIPATION AND STUDY  
Once the informed consent form ( ICF) is sig ned, Screening assessments 
(see Section  5.1.1 ) may be performed over a 28 -day period prior to randomization at 
the Baseline visit. Subjects will then be randomized to receive their assigned study drug 
during the 18 -week Double -Blind Treatment Period  (see Section  5.1.3 ). If a subject 
completes the Double -Blind Treatment Period  or discontinues his/her assigned study 
drug early, the subject will complete follow -up assessments (see Section  5.1.5 ) at least 
30 days after the last dose of study drug . Overall subject participation, from Screening 
through the follow -up assessments, may last for up to appr oximately 6 months.  
The study begins when the first subject signs the ICF. The end of the study will occur 
when all subjects have discontinued taking their assigned study drug  (i.e., either at the 
end of the Double -Blind Treatment Period  or earlier) and ha ve completed the follow -up 
assessments.

 Page 33 3.4.2 Safety  
Adverse events and changes in physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram 
(ECG), and clinical laboratory values will be used to evaluate safety and tolerability. 
Adverse event incidence will be determined during the Double -Blind Treatment 
Period. Adverse event type, relationship, severity, onset, and duration will be presented 
by treatment group within the Double -Blind  Treatment Period.  
3.5 SUBJECT NUMBERING, RANDOMIZATION , AND BLINDING  
After signing the ICF, s ubjects will be assigned a unique subject ID number, which is 
a combination of the investigational site ID number and a sequential subject number. 
The subject ID number will be maintained throughout the course of the study and will 
be the primary number used to manage subject -related operations and documentation. 
The process for s ubjects who fail Screening but then repeat the Screening process due 
to a change in their eligibility status (see Section 5.1.1 ) will be described in the Study 
Procedures Manual ( SPM ) or other applicable instructions . 
Upon confirmation of subject eligibility at the Baseline visit (see Section 5.1.2 ), 
investigational  site staff will login to  the designated automated  system to randomize 
the subject. Subjects  will be randomized in equal numbers to 1 of 3 treatment groups : 
HTD1801 500 mg BID, 1,000 mg BID, or placebo BID. In addition to the subject ID 
number, subjects  will be assigned a randomization number, as  well as a kit ID number 
corresponding to a pre-packaged and numbered study drug  kit (see Section  4.1.2 ). 
All subjects and study personnel will remain blinded to the treatment administered 
throughout the study. All study drugs will be provid ed in matching white tablets, 
4 tablets to a pouch , 2 pouches  to be administered each day, 1 pouch  in the morning 
and 1 pouch  in the evening. An adequate supply of study drug will be provided to each 
subject at each clinic visit to cover the next 2 - or 4-week period with additional days 
of coverage , as applic able (e.g., to provide for possible scheduling conflicts ). 
In this double -blind study, if a medical emergency occurs and a decision about a 
subject ’s condition requires knowledge of the study drug assignment  in order to 
properly treat the subject , the study blind may be broken for th at specific  subject  only.  
The decision to break the blind for a subject  should only be ma de after consultation 
with the M edical Monitor or Sponsor representative.

 Page 36 along with any unused study drug.  Returned u nused study drug must not be 
re-dispensed to subjects.  
4.3 HANDLING OF INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  
The Investigator will be fully responsible for the security, accessibility , and storage of 
the study drugs  while  they are at the investigational site.   The Investigator is also 
responsible for the education of site staff in the correct administration of the study drugs 
and must ensure that appropriate study drug accountability re cords are maintained . 
4.4 COMPLIANCE WITH INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  
At applicable clinic visit s during the Dou ble-Blind Treatment Period 
(see Section  5.1.3 ), subjects  will be queried about their compliance with taking their  
assigned study drug as instructed . The number of full and empty study drug pouch es 
will be captured on the electronic case report form (e CRF ). 
4.5 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
The use of permitted  concomitant medications may continue  during the study  at the 
same dosage strength and frequency . If subjects are receiving p ermitted  medication s, 
doses and regimens should be stable as described in Section  3.3.1 : 
• Thiazolidinediones, GLP -1 agonists, DPP -4 inhibitors, or SGLT -2 inhibitors  
must be stable  for ≥90 days prior to randomization ; 
• Vitamin E dose of ≤400 IU must be stable for ≥90 days prior to randomization 
with no anticipated dose increases during the study ; 
• Regimens for other concomitant medications must be stable for ≥28 days prior to 
randomiza tion. 
Changes to permitted concomitant medications are not to be made unless medically 
necessary. The Medical Monitor may be consulted, as needed, on such changes. The 
need for medication or dose changes must be documented in the subject’s source 
documents  (e.g., in response to an AE).

 Page 37 During the Double -Blind Treatment Period, concomitant medications should not be 
taken within 1 hour prior to dosing of study drug or up to 6 hours following dosing of 
study drug.  
Note the following  for specific concomitant medications:  
• Dose adjustments for T2DM medication regimens, including those for metformin 
and insulin, will primarily be made in consultation with the subject’s primary care 
physician.  
• Short courses of oral prednisone/prednisolone  (or prednisone/prednisolone 
equivalent)  ≤10 mg/day  for conditions unrelated to NASH (e.g., allergic reaction) 
are permitted.  
• The study drug should be taken >1 hour before or 4 -6 hours after taking any of 
the following: b ile acid sequestering agents (e.g.,  cholestyr amine and colestipol), 
aluminum -based antacids (e.g., aluminum hydroxide), or traditional Chinese 
medicines . 
• Based on HTD1801 human PK data and in vitro  inhibition of cytochrome P450 
(CYP450 ) and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase  (UGT ) enzyme s, a 
meaningful inhibition of CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and UGT enzymes at the doses used 
in this study  is not expected . Other than those listed in Section  4.6, Table 4, the 
concomitant use of statins, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serot onin and 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and other antidepressants (i.e., agomelatine, 
mirtazapine, reboxetine, vilazodone, and vortioxetine) is permitted.  
4.6 PROHIBITED CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
Certain concomitant medications have been identified for exclusion  from this study  
and are not to be taken at any time during the entire study  (i.e., from Screening through 
the Follow -up Period) .  These e xclusions are primarily due to t he potential  drug 
interaction profile of the BBR  component of HTD1801. Table 4 lists m edications 
known to be  strong inhibi tors of P-glycoprotein (P -gp), CYP3A4, and CYP2D6 ; strong  
inducers of CYP3A4 ; as well as P -gp substrates wi th a narrow therapeutic index , and 
that are prohibited from concomitant use during this study .

 Page 39 4.7 MANAGEMENT OF CONCOMITANT CONDITIONS  
In general, the Investigator should advise subjects to consult their primary care 
physician as medically warranted.  
Specifically for the management of T2DM, the Investigator will instruct study s ubjects 
to visit or consult their primary care physician if clinical laboratory results or other 
symptomatology indicate a hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic state. The Investigator will 
advise subjects on routine blood glucose monitoring and follow -up with the ir primary 
care physician, consistent with the subjects’ standard T2DM management practices, as 
well as instruct subjects to report any signs or symptoms of low or high blood glucose 
for appropriate management and follow -up. 
4.8 LIFESTYLE CONSIDERATIONS  
All su bjects  will receive a hand -out of standard recommendations  about life style 
modification , including, but not limited to : dietary modification, weight loss, exercise, 
the use of dietary supplements, and alcohol consumption.  Subject adherence to diet and 
lifestyle recommendations will not specifically be assessed .

5.1.1 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 
PROCEDURES, MEASUREMENTS, AND EVALUATIONS 
Study procedures are summarized acr oss all scheduled study visits as indicated in the 
Study Design (Fig ure 1) and the Schedule of Time and Events (Table 1). Unscheduled 
visits may also occur at any time if medically warranted. Study related assessments 
performed at all visits will be recorded in the eCRF. 
Throughout  the study,  clinical  laboratory  (blood  and  urine)  samples  will  be 
collected during a fasting state (i.e., at least 8 hours prior to sample collection) and 
sent to the designated central laboratory for analysis.  Study drug should be taken 
with water and food (e.g., meal or snack). 
For subjects who cannot be contacted for either a return for a scheduled clinic visit  or 
for follow-up assessments as  described in  this section,  and who may be considered  “lost 
to follow-up,” at least 3 documented attempts should be made to establish contact with 
and to instruct the subject on how to complete study procedures. In the final attempt to 
contact the subject, a letter should be sent by certified mail to the subject’s last known 
address. 
Screening (D ays -28 to -1) 
Prior to any clinical procedures and evaluations, written signed informed consent must 
be obtained.  Screening  procedures  must  be completed  within  28 days  prior  to the 
Baseline visit and can be performed across multiple days during this period. Screening 
clinical  laboratory  tests (see Sections  6.2.2  and 6.3.4 ) may be repeated  once  during 
Screening  if the Investigator  believes  the results  to be erroneous.  In the event  that 
Screening  tests  are repeated,  the most  current  results  will  be used  to determine 
eligibility.  Potential  subjects  who do not meet  all eligibility  criteria  at Screening  will 
be allowed to re-screen once  if the  Investigator believes  that there  has been a change 
in eligibility status. If a potential subject fails to meet eligibility criteria upon re-screen, 
he/she will remain ineligible for the study. 
During  Screening,  the following  procedures  must  be conducted  and assessments 
obtained.  The information will be collected in the investigational site’s standard source 
document s or in source document templates provided by the Sponsor.

laboratory collection schedule and corresponding an alytes, respectiv ely. 
At the completion of the Weeks 2, 6, 10 and 14 clinic visits, the next 4-week supply of 
study drug will be dispensed  to the subject. At all  visits, used and unused study drug 
pouches will be collected from the subject; compliance with taking the study drug will 
be assessed. 
Prior and concomitant medications will be reviewed and any changes will be recorded 
on the appropriate  eCRF  page.   Generally,  any new  medications  that are being  taken 
are, by default, to be considered as being necessitated by an  AE.  Rarely, a previously 
unmentioned  prior  medication  may be disclosed,  and  that  eCRF  page  should  be 
updated.

may have occurred during the intervening period.  
5.1.4 Study Discharge  
Following the succe ssful completion of all procedures at the Week 18 visit  of the 
Double -Blind Treatment Period , all subject s are to undergo study discharge procedures.  
This will include instructions to the subject  to contact the investigational site 
immediately if any problems or concerns arise during the next 30 days of follow -up 
(see Section  5.1.6 ). 
5.1.5 Early Termination  
Shoul d a subject permanently discontinue taking his/her assigned study drug, an Early 
Termination (ET) visit should be performed. The ET visit procedures and assessments 
are the same as those performed at the Week 18 visit (see Section  5.1.3 ).  If the ET visit 
coincides with a regularly scheduled study visit, the ET visit procedures and 
assessments will be performed in its place.  The subject will then be instructed to con tact 
the investigational site immediately if any problems or concerns arise during the next 
30 days of follow -up (see Section  5.1.6 ). 
5.1.6 Follow -up Period  
All s ubjects  will undergo follow -up evaluations at least 30 days  after the last dose of 
study drug. The follow -up can be via telephone, provided that the subject  has no health 
concerns related to the study.  The subject  may be asked to return to the investigati onal 
site if the Investigator thinks it is advisable for safety reasons. The following 
assessments will be conducted by telephone (or other ) contact : 
• AE monitoring  
• Concomitant medications (query for any possible relationship to an AE)  
Following the comple tion of the follow -up procedures, the subject  is officially 
discharged from the study.

6.1.3 CONDUCT OF STUDY PROCEDURES AND ASSESSMENTS 
For all study pr ocedures and  assessments describ ed in this section, refer to the Schedule 
of Time and Even ts (Table 1) and Section 5.0. 
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES 
Demographics and Medical History 
The Investigator  or qualified designee will  obtain demographic data, medical  history , 
and medication history for each potential subject at Screening. Demographic data will 
include, at a minimum, the subject’s age and/or date of birth, sex, race, and ethnicity. 
Medical  and medication  history  will include  relevant  medical  conditions  and 
treatments, including surgical procedures, within the last 10 years of Screening that the 
Investigator considers clinically significant. 
Randomization and Study Drug Management 
Upon  confirmation  of subject  eligibility  at the Baseline  visit (see  Section  5.1.2 ), 
investigational  site staff  will login  to the designated  automated  system  to randomize 
the subject  and to dispense  the assigned  study  drug kits. The designated  automated 
system  will also be used  throughout  the study  to enter  study  visit data,  update  the 
subject’s study disposition, and for study drug supply management. Refer to the  SPM  
or applicable instructions for further system and process related details. 
Subject Reminder Cards 
Subject reminder cards will be provided to  all (potential) subjects at  each study  visit. 
The reminder  cards  will  inform  the subject  of the date  and  time of his/her  next 
scheduled visit and will include any necessary instructions. 
6.2 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
6.2.1 Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
Magnetic resonance imaging -estimated pr oton density fat fraction  will be utilized as 
the p rimary efficacy measure to quantify LFC.  Proton density fat -fraction , which is a 
fundamental property of tissue that measures hepatic fat concentration  based on the 
CONFIDENTIAL  HighTide Biopharma Pty. Ltd.  
HTD1801  
Clinical Protocol  IND 139 502 
Page 46 6.2.2 density  of mobile  protons  from  fat (triglycerides)  compared  to the total  density  of 
protons from mobile triglycerides and mobile water, is well-accepted as a standardized 
non-invasive biomarker of LFC (Reeder et al., 2012) . 
Corrected  T1 (or iron-corrected  T1) is an MRI-based  technique  that characterizes 
tissue in vivo  based on the fluidity of water protons within the tissue. Relative to liver 
tissue, the T1 m easurement of free water increases with inflammation and fibrosis, but 
must be corrected due to the confounding effect of iron (Banerjee et al., 2014). While 
cT1 will not be utilized  as an efficacy  measure  for this study,  it will be utilized  as a 
biomarker  of fibrosis  to qualify  potential  subjects  given  its reported  correlation  with 
histological parameters of liver disease (Pavlides et al., 2016) . 
Investigational  sites  will  utilize  their local  MRI  facility,  which  will be qualified 
according to a study-specific image acquisition protocol, to acquire the MRI-PDFF and 
cT1 scans.  Magnetic  resonance  imaging  scans  will be performed  on the  subjects’ 
abdominal  region  and will last approximately  10 minutes.  Scan  data  will  then  be 
transmitted  electronically  via a secure  portal  to a central  imaging  laboratory  for 
analysis.  Central  imaging  specialists  blinded  to the clinical  data  will use the 
Liver MultiScan  Disco ver™ (LMSD;  Perspectum  Diagnostics,  Oxford,  United 
Kingdom) investigational device to analyze the scans and report the MRI-PDFF, cT1, 
and T2* results to the investigational sites. The MRI-PDFF, cT1, and T2* results will 
be reported at Screening, with MRI-PDFF and cT1 as part of the eligibility criteria. At 
a minimum, clinical metrics for the MRI-PDFF will be reported at the Week 18 or ET 
visit.  Technical  and analysis  specifications  and  procedures,  including  the blinded 
reporting of  any results, will  be detailed in  the central imaging  manual, imaging  charter, 
and/or SPM. 
Efficacy Related Laboratory and Biomarker Assessments 
A central laboratory will be u tilized to perfor m efficacy related clinical lab oratory and 
biomarker assessments as specified in Table 1 and Table 2 and as described in this 
section. Samples for laborato ry and biomarker assessments performed at Baseline mu st 
be collected prior to study  drug dosing. Th e Investigator or qualified designee must 
review the results of all central laboratory testing to assess subject eligibility at 
Screening and Baseline, as well as continued study participatio n for the duration of the 
Double-Blind Tr eatment Period.  Procedures for sample collection and handling, 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 HighTide Biopharma Pty. Ltd.  
 HTD1801  
Clinical Protocol  IND 139 502 
 
 
 Page 47 including the blin ded reporting of any results,  will be detailed in the central laboratory 
manual  and/or SPM . 
The following laboratory and biomarker assessments will be utilized as secondary 
efficacy measures:  
Fasting glucose, HbA1c, HOMA -IR, serum triglycerides, LDL -c, and HDL -c will be 
utilized in this study to assess glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, and lipid 
metabolism. These measu res are routinely performed in the management of metabolic 
abno rmalities  that underlie  the pathogenesis of NAFLD, including dyslipidemia and 
T2DM, the latter of which is recognized as a risk factor  for progressive hepatic fibrosis  
(Adams and Angulo 2006 ). 
Aspartate aminotransferase and ALT are liver-associated enzymes  that will be utilized 
in this study to assess  liver biochemistry. These enzymes are markers of liver injury 
that may be useful surrogate measures of NAFLD and NASH, particularly in T2DM 
patien ts (Sanyal et al., 2015 ). 
Pro-C3 and the ELF score  are biomarkers that will be utilized in this study to assess 
liver inflammation and fibrosis . Pro -C3 is a neo-epitope of PIIINP, which has been 
reported to reflect the true formation of collagen and to potentially be an accurate 
biomarker for the formation of fibrotic tissue in the liver  (Nielsen et al., 2013 ). The 
ELF score  is a set of extracellular matrix marker s that consists of TIMP -1, PIIINP , and 
HA, and has b een reported to show good correlations with fibrosis stages in chronic 
liver disease  (Lichtinghagen et al., 2013 ). 
Total bile acids, C4, and FGF19  are biomarkers that will be utilized in this study to 
assess bile acid homeostasis. Factors implicated in the pathogenesis of NASH, such as 
obesity  or increased BMI , insulin resistance, and elevated AST and ALT serum 
concentrat ions to the dysregulation and increase of serum bile acids. Likewise, 
elevations in  serum C4, an indicator of bile acid synthesis in vivo , have been observed 
in NASH patients.  Conversely, reduced serum concentrations of FGF19, which inhibits  
the rate -limiting enzyme CYP7A1 to regulate bile acid synthesis, have also been 
observed in NASH patients (Zhang and Deng 2018 ). Furthermore, the results of a 
recent study of BBR administered to wild type and farnesoid X receptor (FXR)

 Page 48 knockout mice suggest that BBR  may exert its lipid -lowering effect by modulating bile 
acid turnover  and activating the FXR -FGF19  signaling pathway  (Sun et al., 2017 ). 
6.3 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
6.3.1 Physical Examinations  
Physical examinations must be performed at investigational sites by medically 
qualified indiv iduals according to local requirements. Abnormal physical examination 
findings that the Investigator considers clinically significant are to be reported as AEs.  
The comprehensive physical examination will include the assessment of the following: 
skin; head , neck, eyes, ears, nose, throat; upper and lower extremities; chest and lungs; 
abdomen; cardiovascular system ; and a brief neurological examination.  The targeted 
physical examination will be a symptom -driven assessment of body systems or organs 
as indicat ed by AEs or other findings.  
6.3.2 Vital Signs, Height, and Weight  
Vital sign measurements must be performed at investigational sites by medically 
qualified individuals according to local requirements . Measurements include blood 
pressure, pulse, respiratory rate , and body temperature. Blood pressure and pulse will 
be taken in a recumbent, semirecumbent, or sitting position after 5 minutes of rest. 
Height ( at Screening only) and weight will also be performed.  Abnormal findings that 
the Investigator considers clini cally significant are to be reported as AEs.  
6.3.3 Electrocardiograms  
Twelve -lead ECGs will be performed at the investigational site with the subject in a 
recumbent or semirecumbent position after 5 minutes of rest. Local institutional 
standards for QT interval corrections should be utilized . Interpretation of ECG results 
for the ongoing assessment of safety will be performed by the Investigator or qualified 
designee during the scheduled visit.  Abnormal ECG readings that the Investigator 
considers clinic ally significant are to be reported as AEs. Additionally, the Investigator 
should consult the Medical Monitor, when possible, for any abnormal, clinically 
significant ECG findings  that may result in a change to the subject’s treatment or 
management .

6.3.6 Safety Related La boratory Assessments 
A central laboratory will be utilized to perform safety related clinical laboratory 
assessments as specified in Table 1 and Table 2 and as described in this section. 
Samples for labo ratory assessments performed at Baseline must be co llected  prior to 
study drug dosing. The Investigator or qualified designee mu st review the results of 
all central laboratory testing to assess subject eligibility at Screening and Baseline, as 
well as continued study participation for the duration of the Double-Blind Treatment 
Period. Procedur es for sample collection and handlin g, including the blin ded reporting 
of any results, will be detailed in the central laboratory manual and/or SPM. 
In addition to standard serum chemistry, lipid, hematology, and coagulation panels 
(see Table 2) conducted at sp ecific visits throughout the stu dy, samples to assess HIV 
and Hepatitis B/C, G6PD, and r ecreational drug use will only be collected at Screen ing 
to determine those factors that could render the subject unsuitable for the study or 
confound study results. 
A local laborator y will perform serum pregnancy testing at Screening, Baseline, an d at 
the Week 18 visit for all FOCP. A locally perf ormed urine preg nancy test will also  be 
done at Baseline. A local laboratory will perform FSH testing at Screening for all 
postmenopausal females. 
Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be collected from the time at which the poten tial subject signs the 
ICF. Subjects will be instructed to report all AEs during the stu dy and will be assessed 
for the occurren ce of AEs throu ghout the study until at least 30 d ays after discontinuing 
the study drug. General and non-leading questions such as “How are you feeling?” 
should be asked when assessing the occurrence of AEs. The defin ition, reportin g, and 
recording requir ements for AEs are described in Section 7.0. 
Prior and Conco mitant Medications 
Prior and concomitant medicatio ns will be reviewed  to determine study eligibility for 
potential subjects and to monitor continued study participation. In addition to 
medication histo ry (see Section 6.1.1), any medicatio n, including prescription, 
over-the-counter, or natural/herbal preparations, received within 28 days of

 Page 51 7.0 PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS 
ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 DEFINITION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
The following definition of an AE will be used for this study:  Adverse event means a ny 
untoward medical occur rence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or 
not considered drug related.  
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use 
of the investigational product, regardless of whether it is co nsidered to be related t o the 
investigational product.  
The following  are examples of AEs : 
• Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the indication under 
study . 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition , including an 
incre ase in frequency or intensity of the condition . 
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product 
administration , even if they were  present  before  the start of the study . 
• Signs, symptom s, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction  with another 
medical product . 
• Signs, symptoms , or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigational product or a concurrent medication . 
Overdose should not be reported as an AE or serious adverse event ( SAE ), but rather 
the symptoms resulting from the overdose  should be reported as such . 
Examples of AEs do not include  the following : 
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy) . The medical 
condi tion that led to the procedure as the  AE should be reported . 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 HighTide Biopharma Pty. Ltd.  
 HTD1801  
Clinical Protocol  IND 139 502 
 
 
 Page 52 • Situations  that are unwanted by the subject  but in which  an untoward medical 
occurrence did not occur , for example  social inconvenience after admission to a 
hospital . 
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of a pre-existing disease or condition (present 
or detec ted before  enrollment)  that do es not worsen  overall . 
• Expected p rogression of the disease being studied, including signs or symptoms 
of the disease,  unless  progression is more severe than expected for the subject ’s 
condition . 
Adverse events  may include pre -treatment  or post-treatment  events that occur as a 
result of protocol -mandated procedures ( e.g., invasive procedures, modification of the 
subject ’s previous therapeutic regimen).  
Adverse events  should be captured even if the y occur during  periods without drug 
treatment, post -treatment periods, known  placebo  treatment , or in a reference or control 
group receiving drug or nondrug therapy.  
The Investigator is responsible for all AE assessments . The Investigator and 
investigational site  staff will note all AEs mentioned  by the subject  at Baseline and 
during study drug administration. All clinical complaints volunteered by or elicited 
from the subject  during the study will be recorded on the appropriate page of the  eCRF 
for the study period indicated  (see Section 6.3.5 ). The subject  will receive appropriate 
treatment and medical supervision  for any AE that occurs . 
All AEs judged to be  clinically significant, including clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities, will be followed until resolution.  All AEs will be summarized in the 
annual report or more frequently if requested by the regulatory agency. Serious adverse 
events  require special reporting in addition to documentation in the eCRF as described 
in Section  7.7.

 Page 53 7.2 DEFINITION OF A S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  
In this study, an SAE  is defined as an AE that  meets any of the following criteria : 
• Results in death . 
• Is life -threatening .  The term life-threatening  in the definition of an SAE  refers to 
an event in which the subject  was at risk of death at the time of the event.  The 
term life-threatening  does not refer to an event that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires hospitalization or a prolongation of an existing hospitalization . In 
general, hospitalization signifies that the subject  has been detaine d at the hospital 
or emergency ward for observation or treatment that would not have been 
appropriate in the physician’s office or out -patient setting.  Complications that 
occur during hospitalization are AEs , but not necessarily SAEs . A medical 
occurrence  or complication that prolongs hospitalization is an SAE . When there 
is doubt as to whether hospitalization occurred or was necessary, the AE should 
be considered  an SAE . Hospitalization for elective treatments of a preexisting 
condition that di d not worsen  from its original B aseline  level  is not considered an 
SAE. 
• A persistent or significant incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions . This d oes not  include AEs of relatively minor 
medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, influenza and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) that may interfere 
or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect . This refers to the offspring of a study 
subject . 
• An other important medical event . Medical or scientific judgment should be 
exercised when  deciding whether reporting is appropriate  for other important 
medic al events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization but still may jeopardize the subject  or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. These events 
should also be considere d serious. Examples of such events are intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
CONFIDENTIAL  HighTide Biopharma Pty. Ltd.  
HTD1801  
Clinical Protocol  IND 139 502 
Page 54 dyscrasias , or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or in the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
7.3 
7.4 An SAE  requires  additional  detailed  reports  and  follow-up.  The  content  of these 
detailed  reports  must  address  the Investigator’s  estimate  of causality.  The Medical 
Monitor will review the SAE to determine if it is an expected SAE (i.e., whether or not 
the SAE is identified in nature, severity, and frequency in the Investigator’s Brochure ). 
RECORDING ADVERS E EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERS E EVENTS 
When  an AE  or SAE  occurs,  the Investigator  is responsible  for reviewing all 
documentation  (e.g.,  hospital  progress  notes,  laboratory,  and  diagnostic  reports) 
relative to the event(s). The Investigator will record all relevant information about any 
AE (including  SAE s) on the AE page  of the eCRF.  It is not acceptable  for the 
Investigator to send photocopies of the subject ’s medic al records in lieu of the proper ly 
complet ed AE or SAE pages of the e CRF . These documents should not be sent unless 
they are specifically  requested  by the Sponsor’s  or designee’s  pharmacovigilance 
department. If  this request  occurs,  all subject  identifiers  and protected  health 
information should be blinded on the copies of the medical records before submission 
to the pharmacovigilance department and to the appropriate authorities. 
The Investigator will also attempt to report a diagnosis, instead of signs, symptoms, or 
other  clinical  information, for  the AE. The  diagnosis,  not the individual  signs  and 
symptoms,  should  be documented  on the appropriate  page of the eCRF  as the AE or 
SAE.  In addition, SAEs  need to be reported  in the SAE report.  Adverse events being 
processed  as SAEs  will also require  additional  documentation.  The SPM (or  other 
applicable instructions) provides additional guidelines about reporting SAEs. 
ASSESSMENT OF INTENSITY 
The Investigator will assess the intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study on the basis of his or her clinical jud gment.  The classifications in Table 5 should 
be used in assig ning intensity of each AE recorded in the eCRF.

a From Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.0  
Any AE that changes in intensity or grade during a single occurrence of an AE  will be 
recorded in the eCRF at the highest level experience d by the subject . 
An AE that is assessed as severe s hould not be confused with an SAE. Severity is a 
category used for rating the intensity of an AE (such as mild, moderate, or severe 
myocardial infarction ). However, an AE itself may be of relatively minor medical 
significance, such as a severe headache.  Both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. 
An AE is considered  serio us when it meets one of the pre defined outcomes described 
in Section  7.2. 
7.5 ASSESSMENT OF CAUSALITY  
The I nvestigator must  estimate  the relationship between the investigational product and 
the occurrence of each AE or SAE by using his or her best clinic al judgment . Elements 
to consider  for this estimate include the history of the underlying disease, concomitant 
therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of t he AE or SAE  to th e 
investigational product. The I nvestigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure 
or product  label for marketed products in estimating  the relationship . 
Becau se of reporting timelines, the I nvestigator might have minimal information to 
include in the initial SAE report.  However, the I nvestigator must always make an 
assessm ent of causality for every SAE  before  the transmission of the SAE  report . The 
CONFIDENTIAL  HighTide Biopharma Pty. Ltd.  
HTD1801  
Clinical Protocol  IND 139 502 
Page 56 Investigator  may change  his or her opinion  of the causality  in light  of follow-up 
information, with subsequent amendment of the SAE report. Causality assessment is a 
criterion  used to determine  regulatory  reporting  requirements  and should  not be left 
blank on the eCRF. The same applies to AEs tha t are to be processed as SAEs. 
Table 6 provides some definitions to use in the assessment. 
Table 6. Assessment of Causality of AEs  
Term  Definition  
Possibly related  The AE may be related to the investi gational agent(s) or intervention: the AE 
has a temporal relationship to the administration of the investigational 
agent(s) or research intervention . 
Unrelated  
(or not related)  The AE is clearly not related to the investigational agent(s) or intervention : 
the AE has no temporal relationship to the administration of the 
investigational agent(s) or research intervention, and follows no known or 
suspected pattern of response, and an alternative cause is present.  
7.6 EXPECTEDNESS OF S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
An expected AE is one that is consistent with  the known risk information described in 
the product label (if applicable) or the current Investigator ’s Brochure . The 
expectedness of an SAE will be assessed  by the Medical Monitor  and Sponsor on 
receipt of the initial SAE report.  
7.7 REPORTING OF S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
1.Any SAE occurring  after the subject  signs the ICF and the study drug  has been
administered , as described in Section 7.1, must be repor ted to the Sponsor ’s or
designee’s pharmacovigilance department  by phone, fax, or e -mail within 24  hours
of the time the Investigator becomes aware of the SAE (Table 7).  Any SAE
reported by phone should be immediately followed up with the submission o f the
comp leted SAE report form .  Urgent  reporting of SAEs is required for the following
reasons :
a.To enable the Sponsor to fulfill the reporting requirements to the appropriate
regulatory authority ;
CONFIDENTIAL

• Causality of each SAE;  
• Signature of the Investigator . 
The SAE report  will be forwarded to the Sponsor’s or designee’s pharmacovigilance  
department  within the designated time frames. If additional information to complete 
the SAE report is needed , the I nvestigator will not wait before notifying the 
pharmacovigi lance  department of the SAE . The SAE report will be updated by the 
Investigator when addi tional information is received.  
7.8 FOLLOW -UP OF A DVERSE EVENTS  AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
After the initial AE or SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow 
each subject  and provide further information to the  Sponsor  about  the subject ’s 
condition.  All AEs and SAEs will be followed until  the occurrence of one of the 
following : 
CONFIDENTIAL  HighTide Biopharma Pty. Ltd.

Clinical Protocol  IND 139 502 
Page 58 • The condition r esolves;
• The AE or SAE  is considered not causally related  to investigational product ;
• The subject  is lost to follow -up;
• The subject  is followed for at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug  (or
other appropriate time frame) ;
• The subject  starts another investigational product .
7.9 The appropriate  SAE  report  will be updated  once  the SAE  resolves,  stabilizes,  or is 
otherwise explained, or until the subject is lost to follow-up. The Investigator also will 
ensure  that updates  include  any supplemental  data  that may explain  causality  of the 
SAE(s). 
New or updated information will be recorded on  a copy of the initial SAE report form; 
all incorrect data should be marked out (by a single line), initialed, and dated by the 
Investigator or designee, with the new information clearly reco rded. The updated  SAE 
report form will then be signed and dated by the Investigator and resubmitted to the 
Sponsor’s or designee’s pharmaco vigilance dep artment as outlined in Table 7.

 Page 60 • Repeating liver enzyme and serum bilirubin test s 2-3 times weekly. The 
frequency of retesting can decrease to once a week or less if abnormalities 
stabilize or if the study drug has been discontinued and the subject is 
asymptomatic.  
• Obtaining a more detailed history of the subject’s symptoms and prior or 
concurrent diseases.  
• Obtaining a history of the subject’s concomitant medication  use (including 
non-prescription medications and  herbal /dietary supplement preparations), 
alcohol use, recreational drug use, and  special diets.  
• Ruling out acute viral hepat itis types A, B, C, D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic  
hepatitis; hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease.  
• Obtaining a history of the subject’s exposure to environmental chemical agents.  
• Obtaining additional tests to evaluate the subject’s liver function, as appropriate 
(e.g., INR, direct  bilirubin).  
• Considering gastroenterology or hepatology consultations.  
At a minimum, the Medical Monitor should be consulted on events that may be 
considered  DILI. Rechallenge is not recommended if it is dete rmined that the subject 
has experienced  DILI . 
7.10 PREGNANCY  
When any member of the investigational site  staff become s aware of a subject ’s (or 
subject ’s partner ’s) pregnancy , the site staff  must report t he pregnancy  to the Sponsor’s 
or designee’s pharmacovigilance department within 24 hours by using  the P regnancy 
Notification Form.  The female subject  will discontinue study drug. The pregnancy will 
be followed until there is an outcome and the outcome  is reported to the S ponsor.  
Pregnancy is not to  be reported as an AE.

 Page 62 8.0 STUDY OR SITE TERMINATION AND SUBJECT  DISCONTINUATION  
8.1 ADVERSE EVENT  STOPPING RULES  
If a subject  experiences  an AE that, in the judgment of the Investigator, the Sponsor, 
or the Medical Monitor, presents an unacceptable consequence or risk to the subject , 
the subject  may be discontinued from the study.  The Investigator should consult the 
Medical Monitor, when po ssible, for any situations (e.g., abnormal, clinically 
significant findings) that may result in a change to the subject’s treatment or 
management . 
8.2 NONCOMPLIANCE  
After the Investigator , the Medical Monitor, and/or Study Monitor  consult ( and the 
Sponsor , if appropriate ), a subject  may be discontinued from the study for the following 
administrative reasons:  
• Failure  to take the assigned study drug as mandated b y the  instructions provided 
in Section 4.2. 
• Failure to comply with protocol requirements . 
• Unauthorized, subject -initiated changes in the study drug dosing regimen . 
8.3 WITHDRAWAL OF CONSENT  
Any subject  who withdraws consent for any reason at any time during the study will be 
discontinued from the study, and the reason(s) will be documented on the appropriate 
eCRF page.   Subjects  will be encouraged to complete the study; however, they may 
voluntarily withdra w at any time. The Investigator will provide a written explanation 
of the reason for discontinuation in a source document and this information will be 
recorded on the appropriate e CRF page. Subjects will be specifically queried to 
determine whether or not  withdrawal of consent might have been  due to an AE.  If a 
subject  withdraws before completion, every effort should be made to complete the ET 
visit and follow -up assessments  (see Sections 5.1.5  and 5.1.6 ). A subject  may be 
removed from the study for the reasons described in Section  8.1 through Section  8.3.

 Page 65 9.0 DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
9.1 DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING  
Electronic case report forms will be used to capture study assessments an d data. The 
study coordinator or other delegated study  staff at the investigational site will enter  data 
from source documents into the eCRFs. All eCRFs will be reviewed and 
source -verified by the Study Monitor during periodic site visits, and the Study Monitor 
will ensure that all data in the eCRF s are correct and complete.  Before  or between visits, 
the Medical Monitor or Study Monitor may conduct a preliminary medical review of 
the e CRFs. Once the eCRFs are complete d and source -verified, the Investigator must 
electronically sign all required  eCRF  pages, verifying the accuracy of all data contained 
in the eCRF s. 
Training will be provided for the electronic data capture ( EDC ) system. All study  staff 
at the investigational site using the EDC system must have the necessary education, 
training, and experience or any combination of these . The Investigator will be 
responsible for documenting employee education, training, and previous experie nce 
that pertain to the EDC system  for all investigational site staff using the EDC system .  
The Investigator must maintain adequate security of the EDC system, in cluding 
documentation that all users have been trained on the appropriate standard operating 
procedure  and a list of authorized users. To ensure all data entries can be tracked , all 
personnel responsible for data entry must obtain a unique user ID  and password before 
any data can be entered in the eCRFs. Authorized study staff  at the investigation al site 
will be assigned a unique user ID only after receiving standard operating procedure  
training.  
If electronic data systems other than those provided and maintained by the Sponsor are 
used for documentation and data capture, the Investigator must ensure that the systems 
are validated and that data  are back ed up as described in Section  10.2.

 Page 66 9.2 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
9.2.1 General Overview  
The study an alyses will be conducted in a GCP controlled environment  and will be 
described in detail in a  Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) .  The SAP will also include the 
analysis table, listing, and figure specifications.  
A Biostatistics Data Review Meeting will be co nducted to prior to database lock in 
order to determine which protocol deviations are major vs. minor.  
The data will be summarized in tables and listings according to nominal st udy visit and 
treatment group. As appropriate, tables will display the number o f subjects with 
non-missing data (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for 
continuous data and showing counts and percentage for categorical data. All statistical 
analyses will be performed and data appendices will be created by using  SAS (version 
9.2 or later, Cary NC).  
All statistical tests will be two -sided with a 0.05 alpha (α)  level.  
No alpha adjustments for multiplicity will be made for analysis of efficacy endpoints 
for this POC  study.  
9.2.2 Analysis Datasets  
The efficacy dataset  will consist of all randomized subjects  who meet the following 
conditions:  
• For analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, randomized subjects who complete 
at least 80  days of study drug dosing and have a Week 18 (or ET ) visit MRI -PDFF 
assessment . 
• For analysis of the secondary efficacy endpoints, randomized subjects who 
receive at least one dose of study drug and have at least one post -dose assessment.  
The safety dataset  will include all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose 
of study drug.

 Page 67 9.2.3 Efficacy Analysis  
9.2.3.1  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change from Baseline to Week 18 in 
LFC, or absolute change from Baseline to the ET visit for subjects who terminate the 
study prematurely. Absolute c hange from Baseline in LFC will be assessed  by analysis 
of covariance that includes the effects of treatment group, Baseline LFC, and Baseline 
ALT. Comparison of each active treatment group to placebo will be tested at the 5% 
level of significance without adjustment for multiple tests. Secondarily, comparison of  
the 2 active treatment groups with each other will be tested at the 5% level . 
9.2.3.2  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  
The secondary efficacy endpoints of this study include the following:  
1. Absolute and relative ( percent ) change in fasting glucose and Hb A1c from Baseline 
to Week 18 , or to the ET visit for dropouts . 
2. A ≥30% reduction in LFC from Baseline to Week  18, or to the ET visit for dropouts . 
3. Percent change in LFC from Baseline to Week 18, or to the ET visit for dropouts . 
4. Normalization of LFC to <5% at Week 18, or to the ET visit for dropouts.  
5. A ≥5-percentage point reduction in LFC from Baseline to Week 18, or to the ET 
visit for dropouts . 
6. Absolute and percent change in HOMA -IR from Baseline to Week 18 , or to the ET 
visit for dropouts.  
7. Absolute and percent change in LDL -c, serum triglycerides, and HDL -c from 
Baseline to Week 18 , or to the ET visit for dropouts.  
8. Absolute and percent change in AST and ALT  from Baseline to Week 18 , or to the 
ET visit for dr opouts.

10. Absolute and percent change in Pro-C3 from Baseline to Week 18, or to the ET 
visit f or dropouts , among  subjects with elevated Pro -C3 at Baseline . 
11. Absolute and percent change in the ELF score and each component of ELF 
(TIMP -1, PIIINP , and HA ) from Baseline to Week 18 , or to the ET visit for 
dropouts . 
12. Absolute and percent change in total bile acids, C4, and FGF19  from Baseline to 
Week 18, or to the ET visit for dropouts . 
Percent change from Baseline in LFC will be analyzed by the same model described 
for the primary efficacy endpoint. Normalization of L FC, a ≥30% reduction in LFC , 
and a 5-percentage  point reduction in LFC will each be analyzed by a logistic 
regression that includes the effects of treatment group, Baseline LFC, and Baseline 
ALT.  
All additional secondary efficacy endpoints are continuous a nd each will be assessed  
by analysis of covariance that includes treatment group and the Baseline value  of the 
analysis variable. All secondary analyses (except LFC) will have missing Week 18 
values imputed using a multiple imputation procedure for all sub jects with an available 
measurement prior to Week 18.  
9.2.4 Missing Data  
It is unlikely that all subjects will complete the 18 -week evaluation. Endpoints that will 
only be measured at Week 18 or the ET visit (i.e., LFC) will have the value at the ET 
visit impute d for the missing Week 18 visit.  All other efficacy e ndpoints will have 
their Week 18 value imputed using a multiple imputation procedure.  
9.2.5 Safety Analysis  
The safety dataset  will be used for all safety analyses. Safety analyses will address AEs, 
physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory assessments .

individually; AE inciden ce will be summarized by system organ class and preferred 
terms within a system organ c lass for each treatment group.  Adverse event type, 
relationship, severity, onset, and duration will be presented by treatment group within 
the Double -Blind Treatment Per iod. Liver -specific AEs also will be included.  
The number  of subjects with AEs , as well as the number of AEs , also will be displayed.  
At the subject -level, each AE will be counted only once for a given subject within a 
specified system organ class, prefer red term. If the same AE occurs on multiple 
occasions for a subject, the occurrence with the highest severity and relationship to 
study medication will be reported. Individual AE terms will be reported as separate 
events.  
Changes in vital signs, ECGs , and clinical laboratory parameters from Baseline to end 
of study will be examined and displayed using shift tables (low, normal, high). Shift 
tables for Week 18, or the last available study visit, will be presented relative to  
Baseline for all clinical laboratory parameters.  
9.2.6 Sample Size  
An absolute change in LFC of 5% as measured by M RI-PDFF has been reported 
to be the minimal clinically relevant difference between active treatment and 
placebo  that correlates with histological improvement in NASH  (Loomba et al., 2015 , 
Patel et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, Harrison  and colleagues  reported  a pooled standard 
deviation of  6.3% for  changes fr om Baseline in LFC  (Harrison et al., 2018 ).  Based on 
this standard deviation, 35 subjects in each treatment group will provide 90% power to 
show a difference of 5  percentage points  between any 2 treatment groups a t the 5% 
level of significance.  To allow for a dropout rate of 10%, 39 subjects will be 
randomized to each of the 3 treatment groups.  
9.2.7 Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis will be conducted after a minimum of 51 subjects complete the 
assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint to assess sample size assumptions and 
futility through conditional power; the study will not be stopped for efficac y. The 
method of Cui and colleagues (Cui et al., 1999 ) will be used to compute the alpha spend

 Page 70 associated with the interim analysis to assess futility and to recompute sample size by 
evaluating the pooled standard deviation for the  change from Baseline  in LFC . 
Conditional power calculations will be performed for the difference between each of 
the 2 active treatment groups  versus placebo for the primary endpoint.  The following 
rules will be applied for the primary efficacy endpoint:  
1. If both conditional powers at the time of the interim analysis are <10%, then the 
study will be terminated for futility.  
2. If either conditional power is ≥10% but both are <36%, then the sample size will 
not be increased and the study will continue based on the original sample size.  
3. If either conditional power is ≥36% but both are <80%, then the sample size will 
be adjusted to retain the original power of 90% or a 50% increase in the sample 
size, whichever is the smallest.  
4. If either conditional power is ≥80%, then the study will conti nue as is.  
The Sponsor will be advised of either futility, no change, or of a specific sample size 
increase , but not about the degree of efficacy per treatment group.  The analys is will be 
conducted by an independent statistician who is not otherwise involv ed in the 
operational aspects of this study .

The anonymity of participating subject s must be maintained. Subjects  will be identified 
by an assigned subject  ID number (see Section 3.5) on eCRFs and other documents 
retrieved from the investigational site or sent to the Study Monitor, Sponsor, regulatory 
agencies , central laboratories , or blinded reviewers. Documents that identify the subject  
(e.g., the signed ICF) must be maintained in strict  confidence by the Investigator, 
except to the extent necessary to allow auditing by the appropriate regulatory authority, 
the Study Monitor, or Sponsor representatives.  
10.4 PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE  
Substantive changes in the protocol include changes that affect th e safety of subject s 
or changes that alter the scope of the investigation, the scientific quality of the study, 
the experimental design, dosages, assessment variable(s), the number of subject s 
treated, or the subject -selection criteria.  Such changes must b e prepared as a protocol 
amendment by the S ponsor and implemented only upo n joint approval of the S ponsor 
and the Investigator.  A protocol amendment must receive IRB/IEC approval before  
implementation. In parallel with the IRB/IEC approval process, the protocol 
amendment will be submitted to the appropriate regulatory authority as an amendment 
to the regulatory submission under which the study is being conducted. If a protocol 
amendment requires changes in the ICF, the revised ICF prepared by the Investigator 
must  also be approved by the S ponsor , Study Monitor, and the IRB/IEC before 
implementation.  
Departures from the protocol eligibility criteria (see Sections 3.3.1  and 3.3.2 ) are not 
permitted as these could jeopardize subject safety, study integrity, or regula tory 
acceptance of the results.  
Departures from other protocol  procedures  or requirements are allowed only in 
situations that eliminate an immediate risk to a subject  and that are deemed crucial for 
the safety and well -being of that subject . The Investigator or the attending physician 
will also contact the Medical Monitor as soon as possible in the case of such a 
departure.  These departures do not require pre -approval by the IRB/IEC; however, the

 Page 1 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
(International Conference on  Harmonisation  E6, Section 4.8) 
Informed conse nt must be obtained from every subject  before he or she enters a study. It must be 
given freely and not under duress.  Consent must be  documented by the subject  or the subject ’s 
legally acceptable  representative s igning an IRB/IEC -approved ICF. When minors are involved, a 
parent or guardian should sign the ICF. If the minor is an adolescent (12 to 16 -18 years of age, 
depend ent on region, as specifie d in ICH E11, Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the 
Pediatric Population), his or her signature should also be included. Subjects  who do not speak 
English must be presented with a n ICF written in a language that they understand. A copy of the 
signed ICF must be given and made available to Sponsor and represe ntatives of the appropriate 
regulatory authority upon request. If, for any reason, subject  risk is increased as the study 
progresses, a revised IRB/IEC -approved ICF must be signed by the subject . 
Nothing in these regulations is intended to limit the author ity of a physician to provide emergency 
medical care to the extent the physician is permitted to do so under applicable federal, state, or 
local laws. Only in the case of a life -threatening incident may an investigational agent be used 
without prior signed consent.  In such an emergency situation, separate certifications must be 
written by both a physician not participating in the study and the Investigator. The certifications, 
along with the protocol and ICF, must be sent to the IRB/IEC within 5 worki ng days. In this 
situation, the Investigator may not administer any subsequent investigational product to that 
subject  until informed consent and IRB/IEC approval are obtained.  
BASIC ELEMENTS OF INFORMED CONSENT  
Every ICF must include explanations of each of the following 2 2 elements:  
• The fact t hat the trial involves research  
• The purpose of the trial  
• The trial treatment(s) and the probability for random assignment to each treatment  
• The trial procedures to be followed, including all invasive procedures  
• The subject ’s responsibilities

• The reasonably foreseeable risks or inconveniences to the subject  and, when applicable, to an 
embryo, fetus, or nursing infant  
• The reasonably expected benefits (When there is no int ended clinical benefit to the subject , the 
subject  should be made aware of this .) 
• The alternative procedure(s) or course(s) of treatment that may be available to the subject , as 
well as  their important potential benefits and risks  
• The compensation or treat ment available to the subject  in the event of a trial -related injury  
• The anticipated prorated payment, if any, to the subject  for participating in the trial  
• The anticipated expenses, if any, to the subject  for participating in the trial  
• The fact t hat the subject ’s participation in the trial is voluntary and that the subject  may refuse 
to participate or withdraw from the trial, at any time, without penalty or loss of benefits to 
which the subject  is otherwise entitled  
• That the monitor(s), the auditor(s), the  IRB/IEC, and the regulatory authority(ies) will be 
granted direct access to the subject ’s original medical records for verification of study 
procedures or data, without violating the confidentiality of the subject , to the extent permitted 
by applicable laws and regulations and that, by signing a written ICF, the subject  or the 
subject ’s legally acceptable representative is authorizing such acc ess 
• That the records identifying the subject  will be kept confidential and, to the extent permitted 
by the applicable laws or regulations, will not be made publicly available; and if the results of 
the trial are published, the subject ’s identity will remai n confidential  
• That the subject  or the subject ’s legally acceptable  representative will be informed in a timely 
manner if information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject ’s willingness to 
continue participation in the trial

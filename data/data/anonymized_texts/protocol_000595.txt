Amendment 1 (01Feb2021)
Overall Rationale for the Amendment
The principal reason for this amendment was to introduce a complementary safety cohort 
(which will be referred to as the safety cohort throughout the protocol) and clarify the number of subjects to be enrolled and the analysis populations for the efficacy and safety analyses. The safety cohort will serve the purpose of providing additional safety assessment. Although efficacy data will be collected for the safety cohort, only descriptive summaries will be provided and th ere is no intent to pool the efficacy data from the safety cohort with that from 
the primary cohort. These changes were made to reflect mitigation of the low RSV circulation 
and impact on efficacy data due to the COVID-19 pandemic related measures.

TITLE
A Phase 3 Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of 
MEDI8897, a Monoclonal Antibody With an Extended Half-life Against Respiratory Syncytial Virus, in Healthy Late Preterm and Term Infants (MELODY)
HYPOTHESES
Primary Hypothesis
Compared to placebo, a single intramuscular (IM) ME DI8897 dose, 50 mg if weight < 5 kg or 100 mg if 
weight ≥ 5 kg, will be efficacious in reducing medically attended lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) 
caused by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymer ase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed respiratory 
syncytial virus (RSV) in healthy late preterm and term infants born ≥ 35 weeks 0 days gestational age (GA)
and entering their first RSV season, and the safety profile will be acceptable.
Secondary Hypotheses
• There will be a reduction in the incidence of hospitalizations attributable to RT-PCR-confirmed RSV• The predicted serum exposures of MEDI8897 will be adequate for the duration of the RSV season• Anti-drug antibody (ADA) to MEDI8897 will not impact the serum concentrations or safety of 
MEDI8897 through 150 days post dosing (ie, during a 5-month RSV season)

STUDY DESIGN
Study D5290C00004 (MELODY) is a pivotal Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
single-dose study to determine if MEDI8897 will prevent medically attended RSV-confirmed LRTI in healthy infants entering their first RSV season. The population to be enrolled is healthy late preterm and term infants born ≥ 35 weeks 0 days GA who would not receive RSV prophylaxis based on the American Academy of 
Pediatrics (AAP) or other local or national guid elines. A total of approximately  3,000 infa nts will be 
randomized 2:1 to receive a 50-mg (if weight < 5 kg) or 100-mg (if weight ≥5 kg) IM dose of MEDI8897 
(N = 2,000) or placebo (N = 1,000). Randomization will be stratified by hemisphere (northern hemisphere 
[NH], southern hemisphere [SH]) and by subject age at the time of randomization ( ≤ 3 months, > 3 to 
≤6 months, > 6 months). Enrollment of infants > 6 mont hs of age will be limited to approximately 500. The 
study will comprise 2 cohorts: a primary cohort (N = ~1,500) and a complementary sa fety cohort (hereafter 
referred to as the safety cohort; N = ~1,500) for a total of approximately 3,000 s ubjects. The pr imary cohort 
will include subjects from the NH2019, SH2020, and NH2020 enrollment seasons. The safety cohort will include subjects enrolled after the NH2020 enrollment s eason. Given the largely reduced circulation of RSV 
due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic related measures, the efficacy analyses performed in the primary analysis for the primary cohort will serve the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of MEDI8897 in the study population. Although efficacy data will also be collected for the safety cohort, only descriptive 
MedImmune Protocol D5290C00004 (MELODY) Amendment 1
MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 7 of 76 Template 18.0summaries will be provided and there is no intent to pool the efficacy data from the safety cohort with that 
from the primary cohort. Both the primary and safety cohorts, individually and combined, will serve the purpose of evaluating the safety of MEDI8897.
All subjects will be followed for approximately 510 days after dosing. An independent data monitoring 
committee will review safety data regularly and make recommendations regarding further study conduct.
Subjects will be monitored throughout the study for LRTI. All subjects seeking medical attention for a 
respiratory illness (in either the inpatient or outpatient setting) will be evaluated for the occurrence of LRTI. All subjects found to have an LRTI and all subjects who require hospitalization for a respiratory infection, 
even if there is not a diagnosis of LRTI, should have respiratory samples obtained and respiratory assessment 
forms completed. Samples should be collected for all of these events (even those not meeting the protocol definition of LRTI). Subjects who have a primary hospitalization for a respiratory infection (ie, upper or lower tract) or a respiratory deterioration during a hospitalization, or who seek outpatient medical attention (including ER visits) for a lower respiratory illness, will be assessed clinically for the presence of LRTI and for RSV by central laboratory diagnostic testing of respiratory secretions. 
In addition to the clinical assessment of LRTI, there is a protocol definition using objective criteria for the 
determination of a medically attended protocol-defined LRTI. To meet the protocol-defined endpoint of medically attended LRTI, subjects with signs of LRTI must have documented at least one physical exam finding of rhonchi, rales, crackles, or wheeze AND at least one of the following clinical signs:
• Increased respiratory rate at rest (age < 2 months, ≥ 60 breaths/min; age 2 to 6 months, ≥50 breaths/min; 
age > 6 months, ≥ 40 breaths/min) OR
• Hypoxemia (in room air: oxygen saturation < 95% at altitudes ≤ 1,800 meters or < 92% at altitudes 
> 1,800 meters), OR
• Clinical signs of severe respiratory disease (eg, acute hypoxic or ventilatory failure, new onset apnea, 
nasal flaring, intercostal, subcostal or supraclavicular retractions, grunting) or dehydration secondary to 
inadequate oral intake due to respiratory distress (need for intravenous fluid)
Testing for RSV will be performed centrally using the United States Food and Drug Administration-cleared
and Conformité Européenne or European Conformity-marked in vitro diagnostic real-time RT-PCR assay 
(Lyra RSV + human metapneumovirus [hMPV] assay; Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA). A diagnosis of RSV LRTI requires having a respiratory sample positive for RSV by the central laboratory RT-PCR.
TARGET SUBJECT POPULATION
Healthy late preterm and term infants > 35 weeks 0 days GA entering their first RSV season
TREATMENT GROUPS AND REGIMENS
Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio  to receive a single IM dose of MEDI8897 (N = 2,000) or 
placebo (N = 1,000). The MEDI8897 dose level will be stratified by body weight at time of dosing: 50 mg MEDI8897 for infants < 5 kg or 100 mg MEDI8897 for infants ≥5 kg.
STATISTICAL METHODS
General Considerations:
Tabular summaries will be presented by treatment group. Categorical data will be summarized by the number 
and percentage of subjects in each category. Continuous variables will be summarized by descriptive statistics. Additional details of statistical analyses will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
There will be 2 study cohorts: a primary cohort and a safety cohort. The primary cohort will include subjects 
from the NH2019, SH2020, and NH2020 enrollment seasons (enrollment was paused after one subject from NH2020 was enrolled due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic). The safety cohort will include subjects enrolled after the NH2020 enrollment season.
The Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population is defined as all subjects who are randomized. Subjects will be included 
in the treatment group corresponding to their randomized treatment. All analyses, with the exception of safety, 
MedImmune Protocol D5290C00004 (MELODY) Amendment 1
MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 8 of 76 Template 18.0will be performed on the ITT Population unless otherwise specified. Subjects in the ITT Population and from 
the primary cohort will be ITT Population 1 (ITT1). Subjects in the ITT Population and from the safety cohort will be ITT Population 2 (ITT2).
The As-treated Population will include all subjects who are randomized and who receive any amount of 
investigational product. Subjects will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the treatment actually received. All safety analyses will be performed on the As-treated Population. Subjects in the As-treated Population and from the primary cohort will be As-treated Population 1 (AT1). Subjects in the As-treated Population and from the safety cohort will be As-treated Population 2 (AT2).
Sample Size:
This Phase 3 study will enroll approximately  3,000 sub jects of whom approximately  2,000 w ill receive 
MEDI8897 and 1,000 will receive placebo. Th e 2,000 subjects to be dosed with MEDI8897 in this study, 
together with the 968 subjects dosed with MEDI8897 in the Phase 2b Study D5290C00003 and at least600 subjects dosed with MEDI8897 in the palivizumab-controlled Phase 2/3 Study D5290C00005, will 
contribute to a safety database of at least approximately 3,600 subjects exposed to MEDI8897. 
For this Phase 3 study, the original sample size of 3,000 was driven by the safety database requirement, and 
the study had at least 99% power for the pr imary eff icacy e ndpoint. Reducing the sample size to 1,500 still 
allows the study to be sufficiently powered. M ore specifically, the sample size of approximately 1,500 
subjects in the primary cohort has at least 99% power to detect 70% relative risk reduction ( RRR), assuming a 
placebo group medically attended RSV LRTI incidence of 8% with a 2-sided α = 0.05.
The 70% RRR assumption is based on the Phase 2b Study D5290C00003 in which there was 70% RRR in the 
incidence of medically attended RSV LRTI (9.5% placebo, 2.6% MEDI8897; p < 0.001) and 79% RRR in the 
incidence of RSV hospitalization (4.1% placebo, 0.8% MEDI8897; p < 0.001) in subjects who received MEDI8897 prophylaxis. In addition, the assumption is  supported by a placebo-controlled study in Native 
American term infants in which there was a  
 in infants who received motavizumab 
prophylaxis. In the event that the incidence rate in the placebo group drops due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (eg, social distancing), the sample size of 1,500 still provides at least 90% power to detect 70% 
RRR if the placebo incidence rate is 4% or higher.
To evaluate risk, a sample size of 2,000 subjects exposed to MEDI8897 in this Phase 3 study will provide a
> 99% probability of observing at least one adverse event (AE) if the true event rate is 0.3%; if no AEs are observed, this study provides 98% confidence that the true event rate is < 0.2%.
Statistical Analyses:
There are 3 planned analyses for this study: the primary analysis, safety analysis, and final analysis. The 
primary analysis will be conducted after all randomized subjects (except for one subject enrolled in the NH2020 season) from the primary cohort have been  followed through Day 361 and will be the primary 
analysis for which the study is designed to assess efficacy. For the primary analysis, all efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), ADA, and safety data collected for the primary cohort through at least Day 361 will 
be analyzed. The safety analysis will be conducted when all subjects from the safety cohort have been 
followed through Day 151. For the safety analysis, in addition to the analyses conducted during the primary analysis based on the primary cohort, all available efficacy, PK, ADA, RSV neutralizing antibody, RSV serology, and safety data collected for the safety cohort will be analyzed (only descriptive summaries will be provided for the efficacy data collected for the safety cohort). The final analysis will be conducted when all subjects have completed the last visit of the study (ie,  Day 511). Given the largely reduced circulation of RSV 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic related measures, the efficacy analyses performed in the primary analysis for the primary cohort will serve the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of MEDI8897 in the study population.Although efficacy data will also be collected for the safety cohort, only descriptive summaries will be 
MedImmune Protocol D5290C00004 (MELODY) Amendment 1
MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 9 of 76 Template 18.0provided and there is no intent to pool the efficacy data from the safety cohort with that from the primary 
cohort. Both the primary and the safety cohorts, individually and combined, will serve the purpose of evaluating the safety of MEDI8897.
The primary and secondary efficacy hypotheses will be a ssessed in the primary analysis for the primary cohort 
by a hierarchical order. That is, the secondary hypothesis will be tested at a significance level of 0.05 only if the treatment effect on the primary efficacy endpoint is demonstrated at the significance level of 2-sided 0.05. With that, the over all Type I e rror is controlled at 0.05. Therefore, no further multiplicity adjustment is 
necessary.
Primary Endpoint Analysis:
Primary Efficacy Analysis
The incidence of RSV LRTI (inpatient and outpatient) during 5 months of the RSV season will be based on 
RSV test results (performed centrally via RT-PCR) and objective clinical LRTI criteria and will be presented 
by treatment group. For subjects with multiple medically attended RSV LRTI events, only the first occurrence will be used in the primary analysis.
The primary efficacy analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted on ITT1. RSV LRTI that occurs 
through 150 days post dose will contribute to the primary efficacy analysis. For subjects who do not have a medically attended RSV LRTI and are not followed through 150 days post dose, their event status will be imputed assuming the observed placebo RSV LRTI rate conditional on stratification factors using multiple 
imputation techniques and will be described in the SAP.  A Poisson regression model with robust variance will 
be used as the primary efficacy analysis model to compare the incidence of medically attended RSV LRTI between MEDI8897 and placebo, including treatment group, age at the time of randomization (ie, ≤ 3 months, 
>3  t o  ≤6 months, > 6 months), and dichotomous temperate hemispheres (NH and SH) as covariates. In 
addition, the 2-sided p-value and corresponding 2-side d 95% confidence interval on the relative risk will be 
provided from the model. RRR is defined as (1 - Pn/Ps) where Pn is the incidence of RSV LRTI through 150 days post dose in the MEDI8897 group and Ps is the incidence of RSV LRTI through 150 days post dose in the placebo group generated by the model. Statistical significance will be achieved if the 2-sided p-value is ≤0.05. 
During blinded data review prior to database lock for  the primary analysis, it was decided to drop the 
stratification factor hemisphere from the full model due to no incidence of medically attended RSV LRTI events through 150 days post dose for SH in the primary cohort, which would cause a known convergence or estimation issue. Similar consideration also applies to other analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint, where hemisphere will be dropped from the corresponding models.
Additional Analyses of the Primary Endpoint
A Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel approach stratified by age group at the time of randomization (ie, ≤ 3 months, 
>3t o  ≤ 6 months, > 6 months) will be used to compare the incidence of RSV LRTI through 150 days post 
dose between treatment groups as a secondary analysis for the primary endpoint. The additional analyses will be conducted on ITT1. In addition, a time-to-event analysis assessing time to first RSV LRTI may be 
performed as a supplementary analysis.
An analysis may also include all RSV positive LRTI endpoints, using results from either the central laboratory 
or local laboratory.
Different approaches to handle missing data (ie, early discontinuation and no RSV LRTI prior to 
discontinuation) may be considered for supplementary analyses. Additional analyses may be performed to 
adjust duration of efficacy follow-up and to assess the efficacy within subgroups. These analyses will be described in the SAP.
The incidence of medically attended RSV LRTI through 150 days post dose will also be summarized by 
treatment group on ITT2.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 10 of 76 Template 18.0Secondary Endpoint Analyses:
Efficacy
The incidence of RSV LRTI hospitalization through 150 days post dose will be presented by treatment group. 
Similar methods as described above for the primary efficacy endpoint will be used to assess efficacy on RSV LRTI hospitalization on ITT1. 
The incidence of RSV LRTI hospitalization through 150 days post dose will also be summarized by treatment 
group on ITT2.
Safety
The safety analyses will be conducted on the overall As-treated Population, AT1, and AT2. Safety of 
MEDI8897 will primarily be assessed by the occurrence of TEAEs and TESAEs. Adverse events will be graded according to the current version of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events where applicable for pediatric assessments. Adverse events will be coded by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and the type, incidence, severity, and relationship to investigational product will be summarized by treatment group. Other safety assessments will include:
• Occurrence of AESIs to include targeted AEs of hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis), 
thrombocytopenia, and immune complex disease (eg, vasculitis, endocarditis, neuritis, glomerulonephritis) following investigational product administration.
• Occurrence of NOCDs following investigational product administration
Pharmacokinetics Analysis
Following a single dose of MEDI8897, individual MEDI8897 serum concentration data will be tabulated by 
treatment group along with descriptive statistics. PK parameters, eg, C max, AUC, apparent clearance, and 
terminal half-life, will be estimated using non-compartmental analysi s, if data permit.
Anti-drug Antibody Analysis
The incidence of ADA to MEDI8897 will be assessed and summarized by number and percentage of subjects 
that are ADA positive by treatment group. The ADA titer will be listed by subject at different time points. The impact of ADA on PK, efficacy, and association with TEAEs and TESAEs will be assessed. These summaries will be conducted on the overall As-treated Population, AT1, and AT2, unless specified otherwise.
Exploratory Endpoint Analyses:
HRU and Caregiver Burden
The magnitude of HRU (eg, number of admissions to hospitals and ICUs and duration of stay; number of 
subjects who require respiratory support and supplemental oxygen and the duration of use; number and types of outpatient visits, eg, ER, urgent care, outpatient clinic; and number of prescription and over-the-countermedications and duration of use) will be summarized overall by treatment group, and for the following subgroups: subjects with at least one medically attended LRTI caused by RT-PCR-confirmed RSV, subjects with medically  attended LRTI not caused by RSV, and sub jects with non-protocol defined LRTIs, which may 
be further broken down by RSV status. These summaries will be conducted on ITT1 and ITT2 (if data permit).
Caregiver burden (eg, caregiver missed work days, subject absence from day care) for subjects with medically 
attended LRTI caused by RT-PCR-confirmed RSV will be summarized by treatment group on ITT1 and ITT2 (if data permit).
RSV Neutralizing Antibody and RSV Serology
RSV neutralizing antibody levels afforded by MEDI8897 will be compared to maternal RSV neutralizing 
antibody levels and those elicited following infection in the placebo group.
RSV seroresponses will be evaluated as a measure of RSV exposure in the placebo and MEDI8897 groups.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 18 of 76 Template 18.01 INTRODUCTION
Prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) illnesses in all infants is a major public health 
priority. However, despite more than 50 years of attempted vaccine development, there are no 
licensed vaccines. As there is no approved RSV prophylaxis for the broader population of healthy infants and no tr eatment for RSV, the current management for these patients when 
they acquire serious RSV illness is supportive care. 
The only currently approved prophylaxis for RSV, palivizumab (Synagis
®), was developed by
MedImmune and is only indicated for use in high-risk children: preterm infants ≤35 weeks 
gestational age (GA), children with chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity, and children with haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (CHD). In addition, further restrictions have been implemented by local or national recommending bodies on the use of palivizumab. For example, in the United States of America (USA) per the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines, palivizumab is not recommended for healthy preterm infants 
≥29 weeks GA ( American Academy of Pediatrics, 2014 ). In the United Kingdom (UK), 
palivizumab is recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation 
(JCVI) for preterm infants with CLD or haemodynamically significant, acyanotic CHD based on the GA at birth and chronological age at the start of the RSV season ( JCVI, 2010a , 
2010b ).
1.1 Disease Background
Respiratory syncytial virus is the most co mmon cause of lower respiratory tract infection 
(LRTI) among infants and young children, resulting in annual epidemics worldwide ( Hall et 
al, 2009 ; Hall, 2012 ; Madhi et al, 2006 ; Shay et al, 1999 ; Shi et al, 2017 ; Stockman et al, 
2012 ). All children, including healthy term infants, are at risk for severe RSV LRTI with 
primary RSV infection during infancy. Ninety percent of children are infected with RSV in the first 2 years of life and up to 40% of those will have LRTI with the initial episode (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2014 ; Greenough et al, 2001 ; Meissner, 2003 ; Parrott et al, 
1973 ). RSV LRTI, characterized predominantly as bronchiolitis or pneumonia, represents a 
serious illness with acute and perhaps long-term consequences to the developing lungs in these young children ( Blanken et al, 2013 ). It is estimated that RSV causes up to 90% of 
childhood bronchiolitis and up to 40% of pediatric pneumonias ( Hall, 2001 ). In 2015, an 
estimated 33.1 million (uncertainty range, 21.6 to 50.3 million) new episodes of 
RSV-associated LRTI occurred worldwide in  children younger than 5 years (28% of LRTI 
episodes), with approximately 3.2 million (range, 2.7 to 3.8 million) episodes necessitating hospitalizations, leading to 59,600 (range , 48,000 to 74,500) in-hospital deaths ( Shi et al, 
2017 ). Children younger than 1 year of age had an estimated 2.3 million hospital admissions. 
The overall mortality due to RSV LRTI was estimated to be as high as 118,200 (uncertainty range, 94,600 to 149,400 ( Shi et al, 2017 ).

MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 19 of 76 Template 18.0Although hospi talization is well recognized as an important consequence of RSV illness, a 
large percentage of the healthcare burden from RSV occurs outside the hospital ( Carroll et al, 
2008 ; Hall et al, 2009 ; Hall, 2012 ; Paramore et al, 2010 ) as office visits and emergency 
department visits, especially in healthy infants.  In children < 5 years of age in the USA, RSV 
is estimated to cause 1 in 13 private practice visits, 1 in 38 emergency department visits, and 
1 in 334 hospitalizations ( Hall, 2012 ). Another study demonstrated that in otherwise healthy 
term infants < 12 months of age in a Medicaid program (1995 - 2003), 13.3% had an outpatient visit, 6.2% had an emergency depa rtment visit, and 5.5% were hospitalized for 
bronchiolitis ( Carroll et al, 2008 ). Paramore and colleagues reported high rates of outpatient 
RSV LRTI among infants and young children, ranging from 157.5 to 252.0 per 1,000 children < 1 year of age ( Paramore et al, 2010 ). This study also showed that outpatient RSV LRTI rates 
for late preterm (33 to 36 weeks GA) infants ranged from 183.3 to 245.7 per 1,000 infants, 
with rates for full-term infants ranging from 128.8 to 171.3 per 1,000 infants.
Hospitalization rates among young children in European countries appear to be similar to 
those in the US; the rates for infants within the first year of life were invariably the highest, 19 to 22 per 1,000 children, consistent with the USA and Canadian data ( Jansen et al, 2007 ; 
van Gageldonk-Lafeber et al, 2005 ; Weigl et al, 2001 ). In addition, RSV hospitalization rates 
among German children 0 to 3 years of age were found to be 4 and 9 times greater than the hospitalization rates associated with parainfluenza and influenza viral infections, respectively(König et al, 2004 ).
Similarly, high rates of RSV hospitalization are evident in South Africa. For infants 
< 6 months of age, the incidence (95% confidence interval [CI]) of severe LRTI was 
26.2 (range, 23.6 to 29.0) per 1,000 in those born at ≥36 weeks GA, 125.0 (range, 95.3 to 
159.9) per 1,000 in those born at 32 to 35 weeks GA, and 142.3 (range, 89.50 to 212.0) per 1,000 in those born at < 32 weeks GA ( Madhi et al, 2006 ).
1.2 MEDI8897 Background
MEDI8897 is briefly described below. Refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure for details. 
MEDI8897 is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1 κ) monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) directed against the prefusion conformat ion of the RSV F protein. The antibody has 
been engineered with a triple amino acid substitution (YTE; M257Y/S259T/T261E
[M252Y/S254T/T256E, according to the European Union (EU) numbering system]) in the 
fragment crystallizable (Fc) region to prolong the terminal half-life (t 1/2), which is expected to 
provide protection from serious RSV diseas e for the duration of the RSV season. MEDI8897
neutralizes RSV by binding the prefusion conformation of the RSV F protein at a site distinct from that bound by palivizumab. In preclinical studies, MEDI8897 was > 150-fold more potent than palivizumab in vitro and approximately 9-fold more potent than palivizumab in vivo in the cotton rat model ( Zhu et al, 2017 ). MEDI8897 is currently under development by 
MedImmune Protocol D5290C00004 (MELODY) Amendment 1
MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 20 of 76 Template 18.0MedImmune for the passive immunization of all infants entering their first RSV season and 
children with CLD or CHD entering their first and second RSV season for the prevention of LRTI caused by RSV. MEDI8897 may provide a cost-effect ive opportunity to protect all 
infants from RSV disease based on an improvement in potency and the extended t
1/2that is 
expected to support once-per-RSV-season dosing.
1.3 Summary of Nonclinical Experience
The potential clinical ut ility of MED I8897 and dose predictions of the antibody were 
evaluated in the cotton rat model of RSV infection. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of 1G7, the non-YTE version of MEDI8897, was evaluated in cotton rats following a single intramuscular (IM) dose of 0.25 to 3.0 mg/kg. Serum concentrations increased dose proportionally across the entire dose range with a terminal-phase elimination t
1/2of approximately 1 day. In cotton rats, 
a serum concentration of 6.8 μg/mL resulted in a 3-log reduction in lung RSV titers and for 
Phase 2b was identified as the target serum concentration to maintain in children to provide 
antiviral activity against RSV over a typical 5-month RSV season.
The YTE amino acid substitutions introduced into MEDI8897 do not impact RSV neutralizing 
activity when compared to th e parental mAb, 1G7. MEDI8 897/1G7 showed potent antiviral 
activity in vitro against RSV A and B laboratory strains, clinical isolates, as well as 
palivizumab-resistant viruses. MEDI8897/1G7 was > 150-fold more potent than palivizumab in vitro against the laboratory strains and > 50-fold more potent than palivizumab against clinical isolates based on the median half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
50)(Zhu et al, 2017 ). 
Toxicity, toxicokinetics (TK), and immunogenicity of MEDI8897 were evaluated in a G ood 
Laboratory Practice-compliant repeat-dose in travenous (IV) and IM toxicology study 
conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. Cynomolgus monkeys represent a pharmacologically relevant model for nonclinical safety assessment based on similar binding of MEDI8897 to cynomolgus monkey neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) compared to human FcRn. Toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys indicate that there is no evidence of MEDI8897 toxicity in these animal models.  
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, data from nonclinical studies do not reveal any MEDI8897-related 
safety concerns.

1.4 Summary of Clinical Experience
MEDI8897 has been investigated in 3 completed clinical studies.
1.4.1 Study D5290C00001
The first-time-in-human Study D5290C00001 ( Griffin et al, 2017 ) was a Phase 1a, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose- escalation study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, and PK of MEDI8897 compared to placebo. A total of 136 subjects were randomized and received a single dose of MEDI8897 (6 subjects each at doses of 300 mg IV, 1,000 mg IV, 3,000 mg IV, and 100 mg IM; 78 subjects at 300 mg IM) or placebo (34 subjects). The mean t
1/2of MEDI8897 ranged from 85 to 117 days across the IV and IM 
dose groups confirming the predicted 3- to 4-fold increase in the t 1/2of MEDI8897 compared 
to a standard immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody. The safety profile of MEDI8897 was 
favorable, with similar proportions of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported in 
placebo (61.8%) and MEDI8897 recipients (62.7%). Two treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs; gunshot wound and appendicitis) were reported in 2 MEDI8897 recipients. TEAEs judged to be related to investigational product were reported in 29.4% of placebo recipients and 17.6% of MEDI8897 recipients. The most frequent TEAEs in the MEDI8897 total group included upper respiratory tract infection (URTI; 18.6%), headache (8.8%), 
urinary tract infection (5.9%), dermatitis contact (4.9%), musculoskeletal pain (4.9%), nausea 
(4.9%), and vomiting (4.9%). The most frequent TEAEs in the placebo group were headache 
(17.6%), URTI (8.8%), nausea (5.9%), increased blood creatine phosphokinase level (5.9%), 
and paresthesia (5.9%). There were no events designated as an adverse event of special interest (AESI) or new onset chronic disease (NOCD). There were no deaths. No safety signals in this healthy adult population were observed. Post-baseline ADA was detected in 13.7% of adults receiving MEDI8897 and 15.2% of adults in the placebo group. On Day 361, 
ADA was detected in 5.3% of subjects in the MEDI8897 total group and 10.7% of subjects in the placebo group. The highest titer at Day 361 was 1:200 for both the MEDI8897 total and placebo groups. The presence and titer of ADA had no effect on the PK or safety profile. These results confirmed the extended half-life and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile 
for MEDI8897, including no observed hypersensiti vity reactions, thus supporting further 
clinical studies of IM administration of 1 dose of MEDI8897 in the target population of infants to provide protection for the duration of the RSV season.
1.4.2 Study D5290C00002
The first-time-in-infant Study D5290C00002 ( Domachowske et al, 2018 ) was a Phase 1b/2a, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending-dose study to evaluate safety,PK, and ADA in healthy preterm infants. The population enrolled was healthy preterm infants 
born between 32 weeks 0 days and 34 weeks 6 days gestation who would not receive RSV

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 22 of 76 Template 18.0prophylaxis based on the AAP or other national or local guidelines. Thes e subjects would not 
be receiving palivizumab, allowing for a placebo comparator group. A total of 89 infants from sites in the USA, Chile, and South Africa were randomized and received a single IM dose of MEDI8897 (10, 25, or 50 mg; N = 71) or placebo (N = 18) and were followed for approximately 360 days after dosing. 
A total of 66 subjects (93%) in the MEDI8897 group and 17 subjects (94.4%) in the placebo 
group reported at least 1 TEAE. No safety signals were observed with ascending dose levels. The majority of the events were mild or moderate in severity; only 2 TEAEs were assessed as ≥ Grade 3 severity, and neither was considered to  be related to investigational product by the 
investigator. There were no deaths, AESIs, or NOCDs in any dose group. 
Three MEDI8897 subjects (4.2%) had a total of 5 TESAEs, none of which were considered 
related to investigational product by the investigator; no subjects in the placebo group had a TESAE. One infant who received 25 mg of MEDI8897 was hospitalized for LRTI. Real-time 
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactio n (RT-PCR) testing from th e central laboratory 
was negative for RSV (but positive for human metapneumovirus [hMPV]); the illness resolved.  
 
 
 
The most frequently reported TEAEs for the MEDI8897 group were URTI (69.0%), 
gastroenteritis (29.6%), cough (25.4%), pyrexia (22.5%), and otitis media (21.1%). There 
were no trends by dose of MEDI8897 for these events. The most frequently reported TEAEs in the placebo group were URTI (66.7%), anemia (33.3%), gastroenteritis (22.2%), cough (22.2%), and otitis media (22.2%). Skin rashes (defined as adverse events [AEs] that coded to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activi ties (MedDRA) preferred terms of dermatitis, 
dermatitis allergic, dermatitis atopic, dermatitis contact, dermatitis diaper, dry skin, eczema, rash, and rash papular) were reported for 38.9% of subjects in the placebo group and 47.9% of subjects in the MEDI8897 group. No skin events were consistent with hypersensitivity. 
MEDI8897 exhibited a less-than-dose-proportional exposure increase between the 10 and 
25 mg doses; however, exposure increase was dose proportional between 25 and 50 mg doses. 
Following a single IM dose of 10, 25, or 50 mg, the estimated t½ of MEDI8897 ranged from 62.5 to 72.9 days. On Day 151, 87% of the MEDI8897 serum concentrations following the 50 mg IM dose were above the EC
90threshold of 6.8 μg/mL.
ADA was not detected in any subject at Day 151. Post-baseline ADA was detected at Day 361 
only in 18/68 (26.5%) subjects, and there were 2 subjects with transient ADA positive titers at Day 50 only who were ADA negative at Day 361. Overall, post-baseline ADA was detected in

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 23 of 76 Template 18.020/71 subjects (28.2%) in the MEDI8897 group and 0/17 subjects (0%) in the placebo group. 
None of the post-baseline MEDI8897 ADA-positive subjects were ADA positive at baseline; only one subject (in the placebo group) was ADA-positive at baseline. The highest titer detected was 1:25,600 (observed in 2 subjects [2.8%]). The 20 subjects in the MEDI8897 group who had ADA detected were positive for the presence of ADA targeting the YTE 
domain and 4 of the 20 subjects with samples available had neutralizing ADA antibody. 
There was no impact of the presence of ADA on safety. ADAs did not appear to impact PK 
for 150 days after dosing, but there may have been an impact between Day 151 and Day 361. Serum anti-RSV neutralizing antibody titer s increased dose-dependently following 
administration of MEDI8897 and were higher than placebo by Day 8 and through Day 151. Serum MEDI8897 concentrations were correlated with serum anti-RSV neutralizing antibody across all the dose levels, confirming anti-RSV activity of MEDI8897.
1.4.3 Study D5290C00003
The Phase 2b Study D5290C00003 was a rando mized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
single-dose study that evaluated the safety, efficacy, PK, and ADA response of MEDI8897 in 
healthy pr eterm infants. Subjects were 29 to < 35 weeks GA entering their first RSV season 
who would not receive RSV prophylaxis based on the JCVI, AAP, or other local or national guidelines. Overall, 1,453 subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive a single dose of 50 mg IM MEDI8897 (n = 969) or placebo (n = 484). A total of 1,447 subjects were dosed, including 966 subjects in the MEDI8897 group and 481 subjects in the placebo group. Subjects were followed for approximately 360 days after dosing. The study was completed on 06Dec2018 (last subject last visit). 
Results from the planned primary analysis conducted after all randomized subjects who 
remained in the study completed the Day 151 visit demonstrated a statistically significant 
relative risk reduction (RRR) in the inciden ce of the primary endpoint of RSV-confirmed 
LRTI (inpatient and outpatient) and the secondary endpoint of RSV hospitalization.  
 
 
 
 
Based on the primary analysis, the safety profile for the MEDI8897 group was comparable to 
the placebo group, with no identified risks. Overall,  of subjects in the MEDI8897 group and  of subjects in the placebo group had at least 1 TEAE. The majority of the TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. TEAEs ≤1 day post dose occurred in 2.5% of 
subjects in both groups. In comparison to the placebo group, the MEDI8897 group had a

MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 24 of 76 Template 18.0lower incidence of TEAEs occurring ≤7 days post dose (15.2% vs 12.5%, respectively), 
TEAEs≥Grade 3 in severity (12.3% vs 7.4%, respectively), and TESAEs (16.7% vs 10.4%, 
respectively). The most common TESAEs, based on the MEDI8897 group, were bronchiolitis (2.1% MEDI8897, 4.2% placebo), LRTI (1.4% MEDI8897, 2.7% placebo), pneumonia 
(1.4% MEDI8897, 2.1% p lacebo), and bronchitis (1.2% MEDI8897, 2.3% placebo). None of 
the TESAEs were considered related to study treatment by the investigator. Five deaths were 
reported during the study through Day 361, in cluding 2 subjects (0.2%) in the MEDI8897 
group and 3 subjects (0.6%) in the placebo group. None of the deaths were related to study drug according to the investigator.
Overall, the incidence of investigational product-related TEAEs (MEDI8897 2.3%, placebo 
2.1%); AESIs, including hypersensitivity, imm une complex disease, and thrombocytopenia 
(MEDI8897 0.5%, placebo 0.6%); and NOCDs (MEDI8897 0.3%, placebo 0.8%) was low and generally comparable between the placebo and MEDI8897 groups. AESIs were reported 
in 5 subjects (4 subjects with rash or rash macular and 1 subject with petechiae) in the 
MEDI8897 group and 3 subjects (rash or rash papular) in the placebo group. All events were Grade 1 in severity. The TEAE of petechiae that was reported as an AESI was 1-day duration and was reported by the site investigator base d on description by the parent. There were no 
laboratory assessments for the petechiae.
TEAEs that involved the skin and subcutaneous tissues (including diaper rash) were collected 
as skin reactions, with a few exceptions for skin reactions that could be definitively diagnosed such as impetigo, varicella, and scabies.  
Following a single fixed 50 mg IM dose of MEDI8897, over 95% of measurable Day 151 
concentrations were greater than the nonclinical EC
90target of 6.8 μg/mL. The median area 
under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC 0-∞) and estimated apparent 
t½ were 5.3 day.mg/mL (range, 3.2 to 10.2 day.mg/mL) and 56.5 days (range, 46.8 to 81.1 days), respectively. 
Overall, the rate and titers of ADA were low, and in ADA-positive subjects there was no 
effect on PK or safety. Of the subjects who had serum samples available for testing, ADA was detected post baseline in 4.3% (40/921) of subjects in the MEDI8897 group and 
2.8% (13/466) of subjects in the placebo group; with less than 5% of subjects in either group 
being ADA positive at any visit. ADA titers ranged from 1:50 to 1:3,200 in the MEDI8897 group and 1:50 to 1:200 in the placebo group. Of the MEDI8897 subjects who were post-baseline ADA positive, ADA targeting the YTE domain was observed in 4/17 subjects on Day 151 and 10/15 on Day 361. Two MEDI8897 subjects had neutralizing ADA antibody on Day 361.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 25 of 76 Template 18.01.5 Rationale for Conducting the Study
Prevention of RSV illnesses in all infants is a major public health priority but, despite almost 
50 years of attempted vaccine development and extensive ongoing work (www.clinicaltrials.gov), there is not yet a safe and effective vaccine. While RSV prevention exists in the form of a specific RSV IgG (Synagis
®, palivizumab) requiring 5 monthly 
injections, it is licensed only for infants who experience the greatest morbidity and mortality 
from RSV: preterm infants born ≤ 35 weeks GA, children with CLD of prematurity, and
children with hemodynamically significant CHD. In addition, due to the cost of prophylaxis, further restrictions have been implemented by local or national recommending bodies. For 
example, the USA national guidelines provided by the AAP ( American Academy of 
Pediatrics, 2014 ) limit the recommendation for palivizumab to (a) preterm infants born before 
29 weeks GA who are younger than 12 months of age at the start of the RSV season, (b) preterm infants with a GA of < 32 weeks and CLD for the first year of life with 
consideration of prophylaxis during the second year if continued medical support is required, 
and (c) infants with hemodynamically significant CHD who are 12 months of age or younger. In the UK, palivizumab is recommended by the JCVI for preterm infants with CLD or hemodynamically significant, acyanotic CHD based on the GA at birth and chronological age at the start of the RSV season ( JCVI, 2010a , 2010b ). Currently, there is no approved RSV 
prophylaxis for the broader population of healthy infants, and there is no treatment for active RSV infection. The current standard of care for these patients with serious RSV illness is supportive care. Thus, there is a significant unmet medical need in healthy infants. MEDI8897 is being developed as a cost-effective opportunity to protect all infants from RSV disease 
based on improved potency and an extended t
1/2, which is expected to support once-per-RSV-
season dosing.
Based on advice from the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA), a pivotal 
Phase 2b study was conducted in healthy preterm infants born 29 to 35 weeks GA to demonstrate efficacy and safety  of MEDI8897 in healthy preter m infants who are not eligible 
to receive palivizumab according to AAP or other local guidelines. Based on favorable benefit-risk results following the primary analysis, this Phase 3 study in h ealthy infants
≥35 weeks GA will be initiated.
1.6 Benefit-Risk and Ethical Assessment
The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH)/Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable regulatory requirements.
Prevention of RSV illness in all infants is a major public health priority. However, despite 
many years of attempted vaccine development, there is no safe and effective vaccine for these children. As there is no approved RSV prophylaxis for the broader population of healthy 
MedImmune Protocol D5290C00004 (MELODY) Amendment 1
MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 26 of 76 Template 18.0infants once they acquire serious RSV illness, the medical management for these patients is 
supportive care. 
Based on the risk of serious RSV disease in younger infants and in high-risk children, there is 
an established unmet medical need for the use of MEDI8897 as a prophylactic mAb in all infants entering their first RSV season and in high-risk preterm infants and children up to 
2 years of age with CLD or CHD. Infants in this study who receive MEDI8897 may 
potentially benefit by being protected against se rious RSV disease; however, this has not yet 
been proven in this population.
MEDI8897 has no endogenous targets, and no safety  concerns were identified in nonclinical 
studies. The potential risks are based primarily  on common safety risks observed with any 
immunoglobulin, including mAbs such as palivizumab. These potential risks include, but are not limited to, hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis), immune complex disease, thrombocytopenia, and injection site reactions. To date, there have been no observed events of 
anaphylaxis, significant hypersensitivity reactions, immune complex disease, or 
thrombocytopenia attributable to MEDI8897 in the clinical studies. Nonetheless, subjects in MEDI8897 clinical studies will be monitored for important potential risks, and routine pharmacovigilance and risk minimizatio n activities will be performed accordingly.
1.7 Research Hypotheses
1.7.1 Primary Hypothesis
Compared to placebo, a single IM MEDI8897 dose,  50 mg if weight < 5 kg or 100 mg if 
weight ≥ 5 kg, will be eff icacious in reducing medically attended LRTI caused by RT-PCR-
confirmed RSV in healthy late preterm and term infants born ≥ 35 weeks 0 days GA and
entering their first RSV season, and the safety profile will be acceptable.
1.7.2 Secondary Hypotheses
!There will be a reduction in the incidence of hospitalizations attributable to RT-PCR-
confirmed RSV
!The predicted serum exposure of MEDI8897 will be adequate for the duration of the RSV 
season
!ADA to MEDI8897 will not significantly impact the serum concentrations or safety of 
MEDI8897 through 150 days post dosing (ie, during a 5-month RSV season)

3 STUDY DESIGN
3.1 Description of the Study
3.1.1 Overview
Study D5290C00004 (MELODY) is a pivotal Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, single-dose study to determine if MEDI8897 will prevent medically 
attended RSV-confirmed LRTI in healthy infants entering their first RSV season ( Figure 1 ). 
The population to be enrolled is healthy late preterm and term infants born ≥ 35 weeks 0 days 
GA who would not receive RSV prophylaxis based on the AAP or other local or national guidelines. The study will be conducted over 5 respiratory virus seasons (3 northern

over multiple seasons. A total of approximately 3,000 infants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive a single 50-mg (if < 5 kg weight at the time of dosing) or 100-mg (if ≥ 5 kg weight 
at the time of dosing) IM dose of MED I8897 (N = 2,000) or placebo (N = 1,000). The study 
may continue to enroll through 5 enrollment seas ons even if the target of 3,000 subjects is 
met. Randomization will be stratified by hemisphere (NH, SH) and by subject age at the time 
of randomization ( ≤ 3 months, > 3 to ≤6 months, > 6 months). Enrollment of infants 
> 6 months of age will be limited to approximately  500. The study will comprise 2 cohorts: a 
primary cohort (N = ~1,500) and a complementary safe ty cohort (hereafter referred to as the 
safety cohort; N = ~1,500) for a total of approxima tely 3,000 subjects. Given the largely 
reduced circulation of RSV due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pand emic
related measures, the primary cohort will include subjects from the NH2019, SH2020, and NH2020 enrollment seasons. The safety cohort will include subjects enrolled after the 
NH2020 enrollment season. The efficacy analyses performed in the primary analysis for the 
primary cohort will serve the purpose of evaluat ing the efficacy of MEDI8897 in the study 
population. Although effi cacy data will also be collected for the safety cohort, only descriptive 
summaries will be provided and there is no intent to pool the efficacy data from the safety cohort with that from the primary cohort. Both th e primary and the safety cohorts, individually 
and combined, will serve the purpose of evaluat ing the safety of MEDI8897. All subjects will 
be followed for approximately 510 days after dosing. An independent data monitoring committee will review safety data regularly and make recommendations regarding further 
study conduct.
Subjects will be monitored throughout the study for LRTI. All subjects seeking medical 
attention for a respiratory illness (in either the inpatient or outpatient setting) will be evaluated 
for the occurrence of LRTI. All subjects found to have an LRTI and all subjects who require hospitalization for a respiratory infect ion, even if there is not a diagnosis of LRTI, should have 
respiratory samples obtained and respiratory assessment forms completed. Samples should be 
collected for all of these events (even those not meeting the protocol definition of LRTI). Subjects who have a primary hospitalization for a respiratory infection (ie, upper or lower tract) or a respiratory deterioration during a hospitalization, or who seek outpatient medical 
attention (including emergency room [ER] visits) for a lower respiratory illness, will be 
assessed clinically for the presence of LRTI and for RSV by central laboratory diagnostic testing of respiratory secretions. 
In addition to the clinical assessment of LRTI, there is a protocol definition using objective 
criteria for the determination of a medically attended protocol-defined LRTI. To meet the protocol-defined endpoint of medically attended LRTI, subjects with signs of LRTI must have documented at least one physical exam finding of rhonchi, rales, crackles, or wheeze AND at least one of the following clinical signs:

Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive a single IM dose of MEDI8897 
(N = 2,000) or placebo (N = 1,000). The MEDI8897 dose level will be stratified by body 
weight at time of dosing: 50 mg MEDI8897 for infants < 5 kg or 100 mg MEDI8897 for 
infants ≥5k g .
3.2 Rationale for Dose, Population, and Endpoints
3.2.1 Dose Rationale
A single fixed 50-mg IM dose was shown to be efficacious in the Phase 2b Study 
D5290C00003 in preterm infants (29 to < 35 w eeks GA) in their first RSV season (see 
Section 1.4). Model-based analyses of the Phase 2b clinical PK and efficacy data identified a 
projected serum AUC 0-∞of  as the protective exposure threshold. The risk of 
medically attended RSV-confirmed LRTI over the course of the RSV season was significantly 
lower in infants with higher projected AUC 0-∞. Infants with AUC 0-∞above 13.4 day.mg/mL 
had a statistically significantly higher probabi lity of protection base d on exposure-response 
analysis using Cox proportional hazard regression.  
 
 Additionally, 
a cut-point analysis of the weight-normalized  doses of all treated infants revealed that a 
10 mg/kg dose was the corresponding clinically efficacious and protective threshold dose. Henceforth, based on these analyses, a stratified fixed dosing strategy by weight bands is proposed to ensure maintenance of MEDI8897 serum concentrations above the target AUC throughout the RSV season. Based on dose optimization analysis designed to maximize the proportion of infants with clinically efficacious  MEDI8897 serum exposure, a single fixed 
50-mg IM dose is proposed for infants < 5 kg in their first RSV season while a single fixed 100-mg dose is proposed for infants weighing ≥ 5 kg entering their first RSV season.
3.2.2 Rationale for Study Population
MEDI8897 has the potential to address a serious unmet medical need by protecting all infants 
from RSV disease with once per season dosing. A dose of 50 mg MEDI8897 was first evaluated in healthy preterm infants 29 to < 35 weeks GA (per US FDA advice) in the pivotal Phase 2b Study D5290C00003 with favorable benefit-risk results following the primary analysis (see Section 1.4). This study proposes to further extend the population to healthy late 
preterm and term infants ( ≥35 weeks GA) to meet the overall goal of evaluating MEDI8897 
for prevention of RSV disease in all infants entering their first RSV season.

MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 33 of 76 Template 18.03.2.3 Rationale for Endpoints
The endpoints for this Phase 3 pivotal study are the same as the endpoints used in the 
completed Phase 2b pivotal study. The primary endpoint is the incidence of medically 
attended LRTI (inpatient and outpatient) due to RT-PCR-confirmed RSV through 150 days 
after dosing (ie, during a typical 5-month RSV season). This endpoint will examine the efficacy of MEDI8897 compared to placebo in preve nting LRTI due to RSV. RSV results in a 
significant burden of disease consisting of hospitalization, visits to the ER, and visits to outpatient clinics. This primary endpoint is designed to allow the capture of the total burden of RSV disease and the efficacy of MEDI8897 in reducing that burden. A separate secondary endpoint of RSV hospitalization will also be evaluated. 
Safety endpoints include TEAEs, TESAEs, AESIs (defined as hypersensitivity including 
anaphylaxis, immune complex disease, and thrombocytopenia), NOCDs, and concomitant 
medications. 
Serum concentration of MEDI8897 at selected time points will be evaluated as a secondary 
endpoint to confirm that ade quate serum exposures are maintained for at least 5 months after 
dosing. Additionally, serum concentration data will be used to characterize the PK of MEDI8897 in infants using a population PK approach separately. For infants who require hospitalization for LRTI or any respiratory infection, an additional serum sample for measurement of MEDI8897 concentration and ADA will be obtained contemporaneous with time of hospitalization. Exposure-response analysis will be performed to relate MEDI8897 
serum concentrations and efficacy e ndpoints (LRTI including RSV-associated 
hospitalization).
To determine MEDI8897 serum levels post dosing and correlation with the development of 
ADA, serum concentrations will be measured up to 360 days post dosing. ADA will be measured at selected time points throughout the study and at 360 days post dosing, when MEDI8897 levels are expected to be low. 
Exploratory endpoints will examine magnitude of healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and 
caregiver burden due to RSV illness in the studied population. This will allow the 
determination of social and economic resources that are required for infants who have 
RSV-confirmed LRTI. Serum anti-RSV neutralizing antibody levels will be evaluated for correlation with serum MEDI8897 levels and maternally-derived RSV neutralizing antibody 
levels in the placebo group. RSV serology will be  performed to identify potential exposure to 
RSV. To monitor for RSV resistance, the F protein from collected RSV isolates w ill be 
genetically characterized and novel variants  will be phenotypically characterized for 
susceptibility to MED I8897 and palivizumab neutralization. The incidence of medically 
attended LRTI (inpatient and outpatient) due to RT-PCR-confirmed RSV from Day 152 toDay 361 will be assessed to determine if there is a possible effect of MEDI8897 past Day 151.

4.1.4 Subject Enrollment and Randomization
Study participation begins (ie, a subject is “enrolled”) once written informed consent is 
obtained. Once informed consent is obtained, a subject identif ication (SID) number w ill be 
assigned by a central system (eg, an interactive web response system [IWRS]), and the screening evaluations may begin to assess study  eligibility (inclusion/exclusion) criteria. The 
SID number will be used to identify the subject during the screening process and throughout study participation, if applicable. 
A master log of all consented subjects will be maintained at the site and will document all 
screening failures (ie, subjects who are consented but do not meet study eligibility criteria 
and/or are not randomized), including the reason(s) for screening failure.
Subjects who fail to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria (ie, screening failures) should not be
randomized or administered investigational product. The investigator must consult with the sponsor before a subject who has failed screening may be considered for rescreening.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 36 of 76 Template 18.04.1.5 Withdrawal from the Study
Subjects may at any time be withdrawn from the study without prejudice to further treatment
(withdrawal of consent). The caregivers of such subjects will always be asked about the 
reason(s) for withdrawal and the presence of any AEs. If possible, the subject will be seen and 
assessed by the investigator. AEs will be followed up. If a subject withdraws from further participation in the study, then no further st udy visits or data collection should take place.
4.1.6 Discontinuation of Investigational Product
Each subject in this study will receive a single IM dose of investigational product. An 
individual subject will not receive investigational product if any of the following occur in the subject in question:
1 Withdrawal of consent
2 Subject is determined to have met one or more of the exclusion criteria or failed to meet 
all of the in clusion criteria for study participation
Subjects who have received investigational product will be followed for protocol-specified 
assessments including follow-up of any AEs unless consent is withdrawn from further study participation (Section 4.1.5 ) or the subject is lost to follow-up. Subjects who have not received 
investigational product, regardless of reason, will not be followed.
4.1.7 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for Data and Biological Samples
MedImmune ensures that biological samples are returned to the source or destroyed at the end of a specified period as described in the informed consent.
If a subject withdraws consent to the use of donate d biological samples, the samples will be 
disposed of/destroyed, and the action documented. If samples are already analyzed, MedImmune is not obliged to destroy the results of this research.
The Principal Investigator:
!Ensures subjects’ withdrawal of informed consent to the use of donated samples is 
notified immediately to MedImmune.
!Ensures that biological samples from that subject, if stored at the study site, are 
immediately identified, disposed of/destroyed, and the action documented.
!Ensures the organization(s) holding the samples is/are informed about the withdrawn 
consent immediately and that samples are disposed of/destroyed, the action documented 
and the signed document returned to the study site.
!Ensures that the subject and MedImmune are informed about the sample disposal.

4.3.1 Eff icacy
4.3.1.1 Lower Respiratory Tract Infection
Subjects will be monitored t hroughout the study for LRTI (see Table 5 ). All subjects seeking 
medical attention for a respiratory illness (in eithe r the inpatient or outpatient setting) will be 
evaluated for the occurrence of LRTI ( Table 6 ). All subjects found to have an LRTI and all 
subjects who require hospitalization for a respiratory infection, even if there is not a diagnosis of LRTI, should have respiratory samples  obtained and respiratory assessment forms 
completed. Samples should be collected for all of these respiratory events even those not meeting the protocol de finition of LRTI. Subjects who have a primary hospitalization for a 
respiratory infection (ie, upper or lower tract) or a respiratory deterioration during a 
hospitalization, or who seek outpatient medical attention (including ER visits) for a lower 
respiratory illness, will be assessed clinically for the presence of LRTI and for RSV by central 
laboratory diagnostic testing of respiratory secretions. Testing for RSV will be performed 
using the US FDA-cleared and CE-marked in vitro diagnostic real-time RT-PCR assay (Lyra RSV + hMPV assay; Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA, www.qui del.com). A diagnosis of 
RSV LRTI requires having a respiratory sample positive for RSV by the central laboratory RT-PCR assay.
In addition to the clinical assessment of LRTI, there is a protocol definition using objective 
criteria for the determination of a medically attended protocol-defined RSV LRTI. To meet 
the protocol-defined endpoint of medically atte nded RSV LRTI, subjects with signs of LRTI 
must have documented at least one physical exam finding of rhonchi, rales, crackles, or 
wheeze AND at least one of the following clinical signs:
•Increased respiratory rate at rest (age: < 2 months, ≥ 60 breaths/min; 2 to 6 months, 
≥50 breaths/min; > 6 months, ≥40 breaths/min), OR
•Hypoxemia (in room air: oxygen saturation < 95% at altitudes ≤ 1,800 meters or < 92% at 
altitudes > 1,800 meters), OR
•Clinical signs of severe respiratory disease (eg, acute hypoxic or ventilatory failure, new onset apnea, nasal flaring, intercostal, subcostal or supraclavicular retractions, grunting) or dehydration secondary to inadequate oral intake due to respiratory distress (need for IV
fluid).

Note: One item from each column is required to meet the protocol-defined endpoint of RSV LRTI.
RSV Hospitalization
An RSV hospitalization is defined as either (1) a respiratory hospitalization with a positive 
RSV test within approximately 2 days of hospital admission (primary) or (2) a new onset of respiratory symptoms in an already hospitalized subject, with an objective measure of worsening respiratory status and positive RSV test (nosocomial). Primary and nosocomial RSV hospitalization are further defined below.
Primary RSV HospitalizationRSV diagnostic testing will be performed on re spiratory secretions obtained within 
approximately 2 days before or after admission  for subjects hospitalized for respiratory 
infection (upper or lower respiratory tract). If the RSV diagnostic test (performed centrally via RT-PCR) is positive, the hospitalization will be classified as a primary RSV hospitalization. Deaths that can be demonstrated as caused by RSV (by autopsy or clinical history and virologic evidence) will also be consid ered as primary R SV hospitalization endpoints.
Nosocomial RSV Hospitalization
Subjects hospitalized for a respiratory illness or non -respiratory illness whose RSV diagnostic 
test is negative may develop nosocomial RSV illness during the study.
If signs (such as retractions, rhonchi, wheezing, crackles or rales) of a new lower respiratory 
illness occur during a hospitalization, whatever the reason for hospitalization, and there is an 
objective measure of worsening respiratory status (that is, new requirement for supplemental 
oxygen, increase in supplemental oxygen requirement from prior to the onset of symptoms, or 
MedImmune Protocol D5290C00004 (MELODY) Amendment 1
MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 42 of 76 Template 18.0need for new or additional mechanical vent ilatio n), a specimen will be collected within 
approximately 2 days from worsening of respiratory  status for RSV diagnostic testing by the 
central laboratory. For any subject who is hospitalized for a respiratory infection (upper or lower respiratory tract), the subject must return to his/her baseline respiratory status or be 
clearly resolving the preceding respiratory illne ss before a subsequent respiratory deterioration 
for a nosocomial RSV hospitalization event can be determined.
If the RSV diagnostic test (performed centrally via RT-PCR) is positive, the subsequent 
hospital days will count as a nosoc omial RSV hospitalization. The days of RSV 
hospitalization will be coun ted beginning with the start of th e respiratory deterioration that 
resulted in the RSV diagnostic test.
RSV LRTI Outpatient Events
Subjects who seek outpatient medical attention, including ER and urgent care visits, for an 
LRTI should have respiratory secretions obtained within approximately 2 days after the init ial 
healthcare provider assessment.
Respiratory Secretions for RSV Detection
Respiratory secretions for RSV testing must be collected from all subjects with LRTIs 
(inpatient or outpatient) and from all hospitalized subjects with any new respiratory infection 
(upper or lower) within approximately 2 days after the init ial healthcare provider assessment 
and diagnosis. Nasal secretions will be obtained unless the subject is intubated, and then tracheal secretions may be obtained.
Respiratory secretions will be tested in a central laboratory for RSV using the US FDA-
cleared and CE-marked in vitro diagnostic real-time RT-PCR assay (Lyra RSV + h MPV 
assay; Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA, www.quidel.com). Testing of all samples may include other respiratory pathogens.
Monitoring for RSV Resistance
As an exploratory endpoint, novel RSV F varian ts identified in RSV positive nasal specimens
collected from study subjects will be evaluated by genotypic and phenotypic methods to monitor potential susceptibility changes to MEDI8897 neutralization. The subtype and 
genotypic determination of RSV will be performed  directly on the nasal specimens that are 
collected from all subjects who are confirmed RSV-positive using the Lyra RSV + hMPV real-time RT-PCR assay manuf actured by Quidel Corporation (Lyra RSV + hMPV assay;
Quidel Corporation, San Diego CA, www.quidel.com).The full-length F gene will be amplified using a standard, single-tube population-based RT-PCR method and sequenced by Sanger sequencing methodology. Amino acid substitution(s) within the MEDI8897 binding

4.5.1.2 Dose Administration Steps
No incompatibilities between MED I8897 and polycarbonate or polypropylene syringes have 
been observed.
MEDI8897 does not contain preservatives and any unused portion must be discarded. Total 
in-use storage time from needle puncture of the investigational product vial to administration should not exceed 4 hours at room temperature. If storage time exceeds these limits, a new vial should be used.
The dose administration steps are as follows:1 A dose of 50 mg (ie, 0.5 mL) of MEDI8897 will be obtained by withdrawing the entire 
contents of 1 investigational vial with an appropriately sized syringe.
2 A dose of 100 mg (ie, 1.0 mL) of MEDI8897 will be obtained by withdrawing the entire 
contents of 2 investigational vials with an appropriately sized syringe.
3 For subjects randomized to placebo, a co rresponding volume of placebo (0.5 mL for 
infants < 5 kg or 1.0 mL for infants ≥ 5 kg) should be administered. 
4 Switch the needle prior to administration.5 Administer investigational product using the appropriate size needle ranging from 22 to 
25 gauge and 5/8 to 1.0 inches based on muscle size and weight of the subject.
4.5.1.3 Treatment Administration
The first day of dosing is considered Day 1.
Investigational product (MEDI8897 or placebo) will be supplied by an unblinded 
investigational product manager. Blinding will be performed at the site level to ensure that MEDI8897 and placebo are indistinguishable in appearance and are not labeled to reveal
treatment identity. 
Investigational product (MEDI8897 or placebo) should be administered in the anterol ateral 
aspect of the thigh according to standard practice procedures for IM injections.
4.5.1.4 Monitoring of Dose Administration
Subjects will be monitored before and after investigational product administration through 
assessment of vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate). All vital signs should be obtained within 60 minutes prior to dosing, and at 30 minutes (± 5 minutes) and at 60 minutes (± 5 minutes) post dose.

MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 49 of 76 Template 18.0of investigational product accountability records will be returned to MedImmune. All unused 
investigational product will be returned to a MedImmune-authorized depot or disposed of 
upon authorization by MedImmune.
4.6 Treatment Assignment and Blinding
4.6.1 Methods for Assigning Treatment Groups
An IWRS will be used for randomization to  a treatment group and assignment of blinded
investigational product kit numbers. A subject is  considered randomized into the study when 
the investigator notifies the IWRS that the subject meets eligibility criteria and the IWRS 
provides th e assignment of blinded investigational product kit numbers to the subject.
Subjects will be randomized at a 2:1 ratio to receive MEDI8897 (N = 2,000) or placebo 
(N = 1,000). Randomization will be stratified by hemisphere (NH and SH) and by subject age at the time of randomization (ie, ≤3 months, > 3 to ≤ 6 months, > 6 months). Enrollment of 
infants > 6 months of age will be limited to approximately 500.
The procedure for using IWRS is as follows:
!The investigator or designee contacts the IWRS and provides the SID number and 
subject’s baseline characteristic(s) used to verify that it is the same subject
!Placebo (provided by site) or a vial from a ME DI8897 kit will be assigned to the subject
!Confirmation of this information is sent to the unblinded investigational product manager 
who prepares the investigational product to be dispensed to the subject per the response 
system and records the appropriate information in the investigational product 
accountability log
Investigational product (MEDI8897 or placebo) mu st be administered the same day the 
investigational product is assigned. Total in-use storage time from needle puncture of the investigational product vial to administration should not exceed 4 hours at room temperature. If storage time exceeds these limits, a new vial should be used. If there is a delay in the administration of investigational product such that it will not be administered within the specified timeframe, the unblinded investigational product manager must be notified 
immediately.
4.6.2 Methods to Ensure Blinding
This is a double-blind study in which sites are using commercially available saline as the 
placebo. MEDI8897 and placebo are visually indistinguishable once in syringes. Neither the subject/legal representative nor the investigator or any of the site staff who are involved in the 
treatment or clinical evaluation of the subjects will be aware of the treatment received (ICH E9). In the event that treatment allocation for a subject becomes known to the 
investigator or other blinded study staff involved in the management of study subjects, the 
sponsor must be notified immediately . If the treatment allocation for a subject needs to be 
MedImmune Protocol D5290C00004 (MELODY) Amendment 1
MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 50 of 76 Template 18.0known to treat an individual subject for an AE, the investigator must notify the sponsor 
immediately . The site will maintain a written plan detailing which staff members are 
blinded/unblinded and the process of investigational product administration used to maintain the blind.
Details of maintaining the double-blind setting until database lock for the primary and safety 
analyses are provided in Section 4.8.1 .
4.6.3 Methods for Unblinding
4.6.3.1 Unblinding in the Event of a Medical Emergency 
In the event of a medical emergency, the investigator may unblind an individual subject’s 
investigational product allocation. Instructions for unblinding an individual subject’s investigational product allocation are containe d in the IWRS manual. In general, unblinding 
should only occur if management of the medical emergency would be different based on the subject having received investigational product. In the majority of cases, the management of a 
medical emergency would be the same whether or not investigational product was received by 
the subject. If this was the case, the investigational product allocation should not be unblinded.
MedImmune retains the right to unblind the treatment allocation for SAEs that are unexpected 
and are suspected to be causally related to an investigational product and that potentially require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities.
4.7 Restrictions During the Study and Concomitant Treatment(s)
The investigator must be informed as soon as possible about any medication taken from the 
time of screening until the end of the clinical phase of the study (final study visit). Any 
concomitant medication(s), including herbal preparations, taken during the study will be 
recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).
4.7.1 Permitted Concomitant Medications
Investigators may prescribe concomitant medications or treatments deemed necessary to provide ade quate supportive care including routine vitamins and iron.
4.7.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications
Use of concomitant medications including OT C medications (except fo r routine vitamins and 
iron), herbal supplements, etc from Day 1 th rough Day 15 post dose is discouraged. Subjects’ 
legal representatives must be instructed not to administer any medications, including OTCproducts, without first consulting with the investigator.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 51 of 76 Template 18.04.8 Statistical Evaluation
4.8.1 General Considerations
There will be 2 study cohorts: a primary cohort and a safety cohort. The primary cohort will 
include subjects from the NH2019, SH2020, and NH2020 enrollment seasons (enrollment was 
paused after one subject from the NH2020 was enrolled due to the impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic). The safety cohort will include subjects en rolled after th e NH2020 enrollment 
season.
There are 3 planned analyses for this study: the primary analysis, safety analysis, and final 
analysis. The primary analysis will be conducted after all randomized subjects (except for one subject enrolled in the NH2020 season) from the primary c ohort have been followed 
through Day 361 and will be the primar y analysis for which the study is designed to assess 
efficacy. For the primary analysis, all efficacy, PK, ADA, and safety data collected for the 
primary cohort through at least Day 361 will be analyzed. The safety analysis will be 
conducted when all subjects from the safety cohort have been followed through Day 151. For 
the safety analysis, in addition to the analyses conducted during the primary analysis based on the primary cohort, all available efficacy, PK, ADA, RSV neutralizing antibody, RSV serology, and safety data collected for the safety cohort will be analyzed (only descriptive summaries will be provided for the efficacy data collected for the safety cohort). The final analysis will be conducted when all subjects have completed the last visit of the study (ie, Day 511). Given the largely reduced circulati on of RSV due to the COVID-19 pandemic
related measures, the efficacy analyses performed in the primary analysis for the primary 
cohort will serve the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of MEDI8897 in the study population. 
Although efficacy data will also be collected for the safety cohort, only descriptive summaries will be provided and there is no intent to pool the efficacy data from the safety cohort with that from the primary c ohort. Bot h the primary and the safety cohorts, individually and 
combined, will serve the purpose of evaluating the safety of MEDI8897.
Tabular summaries will be presented by treatment group. Categorical data will be summarized 
by the number and percentage of subjects in each category. Continuous variables will be summarized by descriptive statistics. Addi tional details of statistical analyses will be 
described in the Statis tical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
The Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population will include all subjects who are randomized. In this 
population, data w ill be analyzed according to the randomized treatment. All analyses, with 
the exception of safety, will be performed on th e ITT Population unless otherwise specified.
Subjects in the ITT Population and from the primary cohort will be ITT Population 1 (ITT1). 
Subjects in the ITT Population and from the safety cohort will be ITT Population 2 (ITT2).
The As-treated Population will include all subjects who are randomized and who receive any 
amount of investigational product. In this population, data will be analyzed according to the 
MedImmune Protocol D5290C00004 (MELODY) Amendment 1
MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 52 of 76 Template 18.0treatment actually received. All safety anal yses will be performed  on the As-treated 
Population. Subjects in the As-treated Popul ation and from the primary cohort will be 
As-treated Population 1 (AT1). Subjects in the As-treated Population and from the safety cohort will be As-treated Population 2 (AT2).
The Per-protocol P opulation will include subjects in the ITT Populatio n who receive the 
correct dose of randomized treatment and who do not have a serious protocol violation. 
Detailed criteria defining this population will be determined and documented prior to performing the primary analysis.
The study will maintain a double-blind setting (ie, blind for subjects, Investigators/site staff, 
and Sponsor/designated clinical research organization) until database lock for the primary and safety analyses. More specifically, at the time of the primary analysis (where the analyses will be based only on the primary cohort), the data from the primary cohort will be unblinded to the Sponsor/designated clinical research organization associated with the analysis, write-up,
and submission. To maintain the double-blind setting for the safety cohort until the safety 
analysis, any data with potential unblinding risk will be split by primary cohort and safety cohort by the corresponding third party data vendors and when the primary database lockoccurs, no potential unblinded information will be transferred from subjects not in the primary cohort. The unblinded data from the safety cohort will not be transferred to the Sponsor until the database lock for safety analysis occurs. The site personnel, subjects, and the study team 
members involved in advice or d ecisions involving study subjects and/or day-to-day 
interactions with the site will remain blinded until the end of the study (ie, all subjects have 
completed the Day 511 visit) to ensure the trial integrity is maintained. Further details will be 
specified in the unblinding plan prior to unblinding of the primary cohort data.
4.8.2 Sample Size
This Phase 3 study will  enroll a pproximately 3,000 sub jects of whom approximately 
2,000 will receive MEDI8897 and 1,000 will receive placebo. The 2,000 subjects to be dosed with MEDI8897 in this study, together with  the 968 subjects dosed with MEDI8897 in the 
Phase 2b Study D5290C00003 and at least 600 subjects dosed with MEDI8897 in the 
palivizumab-controlled Phase 2/3 Study D5290C00005, will contribute to a safety database of 
at least approximately 3,600 subjects exposed to MEDI8897.
For this Phase 3 study, the original sample size of 3,000 was driven by the safety database 
requirement, and the study had at least 99% power for the primary endpoint. Reducing the sample size to 1,500 still allows the study to be sufficiently powered. More specifically, thesample size of approximately 1,500 subjects in th e primary cohort has at least 99% power to 
detect 70% RRR, assumi ng a placebo group medically attended RSV LRTI incidence of 8%,
with a 2-sided α= 0.05. The assumption of 8% incidence is supported both by literature 
MedImmune Protocol D5290C00004 (MELODY) Amendment 1
MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 53 of 76 Template 18.0(Paramore et al, 2010 ) and the observed placebo incidence rate (9.6%) in the Phase 2b Study 
D5290C00003.
The 70% RRR assumption is based on the Phase 2b Study D5290C00003 in which there was 
70% RRR in the incidence of medically attended RSV LRTI (9.5% placebo, 2.6% MEDI8897; p < 0.001) and RRR in the incidence of RSV hospitalization 
(4.1% placebo, 0.8% MEDI8897; p < 0.001) in subjects who received MEDI8897 prophylaxis 
(see Section 1.4.3 ). In addition, the assumption is supported by a placebo-controlled study in 
Native American term infants in which there was a  
 
in infants who received motavizumab prophylaxis ( O'Brien et al, 2015 ). In the 
event that the incidence rate in the placebo group drops due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (eg, social distancing), the sample size of 1,500 still provides at least 90% power to 
detect 70% RRR if the placebo incidence rate is 4% or higher.
To evaluate risk, a sample size of 2,000 subjects exposed to MEDI8897 in this Phase 3 study 
will provide a > 99% probability of observing at least one AE if the true event rate is 0.3%; if 
no AEs are observed, this study provides 98% confidence that the true event rate is < 0.2%.
4.8.3 Eff icacy
The primary and secondary efficacy hypotheses w ill be assessed in the primary analysis for 
the primary c ohort by a hierarchical order. That is, the secondary hypothesis will be tested at a 
significance level of 0.05 only if the treatment effect on the primary efficacy endpoint is 
demonstrated at the significance level of 2-sided 0.05. More specifically, after the significance of the primary efficacy endpoint is demonstrate d, the secondary efficacy endpoint will first be 
tested from pooling all ITT subjects from the Phase 2b Study D5290C00003 and ITT1 in the Phase 3 Study D5290C00004. If the significance of the pooled efficacy based on pooling all subjects from Phase 2b and Phase 3 is demonstrated (at 2-sided 0.05), the secondary efficacy endpoint will be further tested from pooling th e 860 subjects weighing < 5 kg on Day 1 (ie, 
290 subjects randomized to placebo and 570 s ubjects randomized to MEDI8897) in the 
Phase 2b Study D5290C00003 and ITT1 subjects in  the Phase 3 Study D5290C00004. If the 
significance of the pooled efficacy based on pooling the subjects weighing < 5 kg from Phase 2b and Phase 3 ITT1 subjects is again demonstrated (at 2-sided 0.05), the secondary 
efficacy endpoint will be tested using ITT1 subjects from this Phase 3 study alone. With that, the overall Type I error is controlled  at 0.05. Therefore, no further multip licity adjustment is 
necessary.
4.8.3.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis
The primary endpoint is the incidence of medically attended RSV LRTI (inpatient and 
outpatient) through 150 days post dose. For sub jects with multiple events, only the first 
MedImmune Protocol D5290C00004 (MELODY) Amendment 1
MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 54 of 76 Template 18.0occurrence will be used in the primary analysis. The determination of medically attended RSV 
LRTI will be based on RSV test results (performed centrally using RT-PCR) and objective clinical LRTI criteria.
The primary efficacy analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed on ITT1 using a
Poisson regression model with robust variance ( Zou, 2004 ). The model contains the term of 
treatment group and age group at randomization (ie, age ≤3 months, age > 3 to ≤ 6 months, 
age > 6 months) and dichotomous temperate h emispheres (NH and SH) a s covariates. The
RRR, de fined as 1- Relative Risk, and its corresponding 2-sided 95% CI, will be estimated 
from the model. In addition, the 2-sided p-v alue testing null hypothesis that the incidence of 
medically attended RSV LRTI between MEDI8897 and placebo groups are the same will be obtained from the model. Statistical significance will be achieved if the 2-sided p-value is 
≤0.05.
During blinded data review prior to database lo ck for the primary analysis, it was revealed that 
there was no incidence of medically attended RSV LRTI events through 150 days post dose 
for SH in the primary cohort, which would cau se a known convergence or estimation issue. 
Therefore, it was decided to drop the stratification factor hemisphere from the full model and a reduced model (including the term of treatment group and age at randomization stratum as covariate) will be used instead. Similar consideration also applies to other analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint, where hemisphere will be dropped from the corresponding models. 
RSV LRTI that occurs through 150 days post dose will contribute to the primary efficacy 
analysis. For subjects who do not have a medically attended RSV LRTI and are not followed 
through 150 days post dose, their event status will be imputed assuming the observed placebo 
RSV LRTI rate conditional on stratification factor (age at randomization) using multiple imputation techniques and will be described in the SAP.
If convergence cannot be achieved using the Poisson regression analysis model, the stratified 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test (detailed in Section 4.8.3.2 ) will be used as the primary 
analysis model.
The above described analysis on the primary efficacy endpoint will also be conducted on the 
Per-protocol Population.
4.8.3.2 Additional Analyses of the Primary Endpoint
The additional analyses of the primary endpoint will be conducted on ITT1. To allow for 
differences in follow-up time, the primary analysis using a Poisson Regression with robust 
variance will be repeated, adjusting for the same covariates as well as log (follow-up time) as an offset. Since the follow-up time is adjusted in the model, there is no missing imputation for this analysis.

MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 55 of 76 Template 18.0A CMH test stratified by age at randomization (ie, ≤3 months, > 3 to ≤6 months, > 6 months) 
will be used to compare between treatment groups through 150 days post dose as the key secondary analysis for the primary endpoint. The RRR and its associated 95% CI will be provided. Th is analysis will be performed without  imputation. The Breslow-Day test and 
Zelen’s exact test will be used to test the hom ogeneity of the odds ratios across strata and the 
corresponding p-values will be presented.
In addition, a Kaplan-Meier curve for time to first medically attended RSV LRTI will be
generated based on observed events. Treatmen t group differences  in time-to-first medically 
attended RSV LRTI w ill be compared using the str atified log-rank test with the stratification 
factor (age at randomization) as the strata.
Additional analyses, including summaries for age at onset of the first medically attended RSV 
LRTI, inpatient/outpatient visit settings, a nd RSV subtypes associated with the primary 
endpoint will be provided.
An analysis may also include all RSV positive LRTI endpoints, using results from either the 
central laboratory or local laboratory.
Additional sensitivity analyses will be conducted on ITT1 to assess the robustness of the 
efficacy results with regard to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
4.8.3.3 Supplementary Analyses of the Primary Endpoint
The supplementary analyses of the primary endpoint w ill be c onducted on ITT1. To evaluate 
the impact of the missing data on the pr imary analyses, the following supplementary analyses 
will be condu cted. For subjects who do not have an RSV LRTI and are not followed through 
150 days post dose:
1 Count these subjects as having not met the RSV LRTI endpoint within each treatment 
group 
2 Perform multiple imputation using the observed event rate per treatment group for their 
event status
3 Perform single imputation using observed placebo rate for both groups
The details of the supplementary analyses will be described in the Statist ical Analysis Plan.
4.8.3.4 Subgroup Analyses of the Primary Endpoint
Subgroup analysis will be performed for the primary efficacy endpoint, the incidence of 
medically attended RSV LRTI. Treatment-by-subgroup interaction will be tested using the Poisson regression with robust variance mode l with the terms of treatment, age group, 
subgroup, and treatment-by-subgroup interaction. If this full model does not achieve 
convergence, a reduced model of treatment, subgroup, and treatment-by-subgroup interaction 
MedImmune Protocol D5290C00004 (MELODY) Amendment 1
MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 56 of 76 Template 18.0will be used. Significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction is judged at the significance level 
of 0.10. Within each level of a subgroup, the RRR and its corresponding 95% CI will be 
estimated using a Poisson regression model with robust variance with the term of tr eatment. A 
forest plot of the RRR and the 95% CI will be presented. In the event that the Poisson regression model does not converge for any stratum of a subgroup, the exact conditional 
method based on the number of RSV LRTIs ( Breslow and Day, 1987 ) will be used as the 
analytical model to generate the RRR and its corresponding CI for all subgroup strata.
The subgroup analysis will be conducted for the following subgroups on ITT1:
!Hemisphere
!Age at randomization stratum (age ≤ 3 months, age > 3 to ≤ 6 months, age > 6 months)
!Gender
!Race (Caucasian, non-Caucasian)
!Weight at birth (weight ≤2.5 kg, weight > 2.5 kg )
!Weight on Day 1 (weight < 5 kg, weight ≥ 5 kg)
!Sibling also participating in the study (yes/no)
In addition, incidence of medically attended RSV LRTI will be summarized by country on 
ITT1.
4.8.3.5 Secondary Efficacy Analyses
The secondary efficacy endpoint is th e incidence of RSV LR TI hospitalization through 
150 days post dose. For subjects with multiple RSV LRTI hospitalizations, only the first occurrence will be used in the analysis.
For the pooled analysis, a Poisson re gression model with robust variance ( Zou, 2004 ) will be 
used to assess the treatment effect on the incidence of RSV LRTI hospitalization between MEDI8897 and placebo groups in the pooled ITT population, which includes all ITT subjects from Study D5290C00003 and ITT1 subjects from Study D52090C00004. In addition to the 
treatment arm, the variable “Study” (which id entifies the enrolled study for each subject) will 
be used as a covariate to adjust for differences between the 2 studies. RRR and its corresponding 95% CI will be estimated from the model. RSV LRTI hospitalization that occurs through 150 days post dose will contribute to the analysis. For subjects who do not have an RSV LRTI and were not followed through 150 days post dose, their event status will be imputed using the observed placebo RSV LRTI hospitalization rate following the repeated imputation procedure conditional on study.
For the analysis using the primary cohort of Ph ase 3 data alone, a Poisson regression model 
with robust variance ( Zou, 2004 ) using only the treatment term will be used to assess the 
treatment effect on the incidence of RSV LRTI hospitalization between MEDI8897 and

MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 57 of 76 Template 18.0placebo groups in ITT1. RRR and its corresponding 95% CI will be estimated from the model. 
RSV LRTI hospitalization that occurs through 150 days post dose will contribute to the analysis. For subjects who do not have an RSV LRTI and were not followed through 150 days post dose, their event status will be imputed using the observed placebo RSV LRTI hospitalization rate following the repeated imputation procedure without involvement of 
stratification factors.
The additional analyses, including the CMH tes t stratified by study (for the pooled population) 
or the CMH test with the only term of treatment (for subjects from Phase 3 alone) for the incidence of RSV LRTI hospitalization, and the Kaplan-Meier for time-to-first RSV LRTI hospitalization will be conducted on ITT1. Treatmen t group differences in time-to-first RSV 
LRTI hospitalization will be compared using log-rank test. 
In addition, age at onset of the first medically attended RSV LRTI hospitalization through 
150 days post dose will be analyzed similar to that for the primary endpoint. Summary of 
incidence of RSV LRTI hospitalization by subgroup will also be provided. These analyses 
will be conducted on ITT1.
4.8.3.6 Additional Efficacy Analyses for the Safety Cohort
Additional efficacy summaries on ITT2 w ill be produced.
The incidence of medically attended RSV LRTI (inpatient and outpatient) through 150 days 
post dose will be summarized by treatment group us ing ITT2. For subjects with multiple 
medically attended RSV LRTI events, only the first occurrence will be used in the summary.
The incidence of RSV hospitalization through 150 days after dosing will be summarized by 
treatment group using ITT2.
Additional analyses, including summaries for age at onset of the first medically attended RSV
LRTI, inpatient/outpatient visit settings, and RSV subtypes associated with the incidence of 
medically attended RSV LRTI through 150 days post dose will be provided.
Details of the efficacy analys es for the safety cohort w ill be provided in the SAP.
4.8.4 Safety
Safety analyses will be conducted for the overall As-treated Population, AT1, and AT2. Safety 
of MEDI8897 will primarily be assessed and me asured by the occurrence of all TEAEs and 
TESAEs. AEs will be graded according to the current version of the NCI CTCAE where 
applicable for pediatric assessments. AEs will be  coded by MedDRA system organ class and 
preferred term. Specific AEs will be counted once for each subject for calculating rates, but will be presented in total in subject listings. In  addition, if the same AE occurs multiple t imes 
within a particular subject, the highest severi ty and level of causality will be reported. The

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 58 of 76 Template 18.0type, incidence, severity, and relationship to  study investigational product will be summarized 
by treatment group. In addition, summaries of deaths and SAEs will be provided. Other safety 
assessments will include:
!Occurrence of AESIs to include targeted AEs of hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis), 
thrombocytopenia, and immune complex disease (eg, vasculitis, endocarditis, neuritis, 
glomerulonephritis) following i nvestigational product administration 
!Occurrence of NOCDs following investigational product administration
4.8.5 Analysis of Pharmacokinetics and Anti-drug Antibody
4.8.5.1 Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Following a single dose of MEDI8897, individual MEDI8897 serum concentration data will 
be tabulated by treatment group along with descriptive statistics. PK parameters, eg, C max, 
AUC, apparent clearance, and t 1/2, will be es timated using non-compartmental analysis, if data 
permit.
4.8.5.2 Anti-drug Antibody Analysis
The incidence of ADA to MEDI8897 will be assessed and summarized by number and 
percentage of subjects who are ADA positive by treatment group. The ADA titer will be listed 
by subject at different time points. The impact of ADA on PK, efficacy, and association with 
TEAEs and TESAEs, will be assessed. The summaries will be conducted on the overall As-treated Population, AT1, and AT2, unless specified otherwise. 
4.8.6 Exploratory Analysis
The magnitude of HRU (eg, number of admission s to hospitals and ICUs and duration of stay; 
number of subjects who require respiratory support and supplemental oxygen and the duration of use; number and types of outpatient visits, eg, ER, urgent care, outpatient clinic; and 
number of prescription and OTC medications and duration of use) will be summarized overall 
by treatment group, and for the following subgroups: subjects with at least one medically attended LRTI caused by RT-PCR-confirmed RSV, subjects with medically attended LRTI not caused by RSV, and subjects with non-protocol defined LRTIs, which may be further broken down by RSV status. Summaries of the magnitude of HRU will be conducted on ITT1and ITT2 (if data permit).
Caregiver burden (eg, caregiver missed work days, subject absence from day care) for subjects 
with medically attended LRTI caused by RT-PCR-confirmed RSV will be summarized by treatment group on ITT1 and I TT2 (if data permit).
RSV seroresponses will be evaluated as a measure of “RSV exposure” in the placebo and 
MEDI8897 groups.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 59 of 76 Template 18.0RSV neutralizing antibody levels afforded by MEDI8897 will be compared to maternal RSV 
neutralizing antibody levels and those elicited following infection in the placebo group.
RSV genotypic analysis will report the sequence changes in the mature F protein from all 
RSV positive isolates compared to contemporary RSV A and RSV B reference strains.  Susceptibility of novel RSV variants to MEDI8897 will be tested and compared to control 
viruses.
The incidence of medically attended RSV LRTI (inpatient and outpatient) from Day 152 to 
Day 361 will be based on RSV test results (performed centrally via RT-PCR) and objective clinical LRTI criteria and will be summarized  by treatment group on ITT1 and ITT2.

An independent data monitoring committee will review safety data regularly and make 
recommendations regarding further study conduct.
4.8.8 Interim Analysis
No interim analyses are planned.
5 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY
5.1 Definition of Adverse Events
An AE is the development of any untoward me dical occurrence in a subject or clinical study 
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (e g, nausea, chest pain),  or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs and can include a 
deterioration of a pre-existing medical occurrence.  An AE may occur at any time even if no 
study treatment has been administered.
Elective treatment or surgery or preplanned treatment or surgery (that was scheduled prior to 
the subject being enrolled into the study) for a documented pre-existing condition that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE (serious or nonserious). An untoward medical 
event occurring during the prescheduled elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment
should be recorded as an AE or SAE.

∀Hospital admissions and/or surgical operations planned before or during a study are
not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteri orate in an unexpected way during the study.
!Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
!Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in offspring of the subject
!Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above
∀Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in this situation. Examples of medically important events are intensive treatment in an ER or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, 
or convulsions that do not result in hospitalizations
5.3 Definition of Adverse Events of Special Interest
An AESI is one of scientific and medical interest specific to understanding of the 
investigational product and may require close monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to MedImmune. An AESI may be serious or nonserious. The rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to characterize and understand them in association with the use of this investigational product.
5.3.1 Hypersensitivity, Including Anaphylaxis
Administration of polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations and mAbs has been associated with immediate (type I) hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis) that occurs during or after dosing. An immediate hypersensitivity reaction is defined as an acute onset of an illness with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both during administration of investigational product (but does not meet the definition of anaphylaxis). Anaphylaxis is a rare event, usually occurring after subsequent exposure to antige n, and it is most commonly accompanied by 
severe systemic skin and or mucosal reactions. It is potentially a fatal, systemic allergic 
reaction that is distinct from simple allergic reactions (eg, rash, pruritus) because of the 
simultaneous involvement of several organ systems ( Sampson et al, 2006 ). A full definition of 
anaphylaxis is provided in Appendix B . See Section 5.5for recording AEs.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 61 of 76 Template 18.05.3.2 Immune Complex Disease
Immune complex disease can manifest in the form of a number of conditions such as 
vasculitis, endocarditis, neuritis, glomerul onephritis, serum sickness, and arthralgias. 
Drug-induced immune complex (type III) hypers ensitivity reactions can occur when host 
immune system generates antibodies to drug resulting in soluble circulating antigen-antibody complexes formation and their deposition in blood vessels. Subsequently this initiates tissue 
damaging inflammatory reactions mediated by complement and/or leukocytes and mast cells. 
The pathology and clinical manifestations are de pendent on the tissues/organs involved, with 
vascular, skin and renal tissues being common sites of injury. Common examples of immune complex hypersensitivity  reactions are serum s ickness (systemic) and Arthus reactions (local). 
The clinical manifestations of serum sickness include skin rash, fever, malaise, and polyarthralgias or polyarthritis. Symptoms typically develop 1 to 2 weeks after first exposure 
to antigen and usually resolve in several weeks after withdrawal of the causative agent. Serum 
sickness needs to be differentiated from other ‘serum-sickness-like’ reactions that have a similar clinical presentation (eg, viral infections, anti-seizure drugs), but are believed to have different pathogenic mechanisms. Both serum sic kness and serum sickness-like reactions have 
been reported with mAbs (eg, rituximab, infliximab). Clinical presentation and time to onset should be taken into account for the diagnosis and differentiation of these reactions. Diagnosis of these suspected reactions is best confirmed via biopsy of the affected tissues. See Section 5.5for recording AEs.
5.3.3 Thrombocytopenia
Thrombocytopenia is a disorder in which there is an abnormally low platelet count; a normal 
platelet c ount ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per μL. The 3 major causes of low 
platelet c ounts include: 1) insufficient platelet synthesis in the bone marrow; 2) increased 
breakdown of platelets in the bloodstream; and 3) increased breakdown of pl atelets in the 
spleen or liver. General symptoms of thrombocytopenia include bleeding in the mouth and gums, bruising, nosebleeds, and petechiae (pinpoint red spots/rash). Severe bleeding is the 
major complication, which may occur in the brain or gastrointestinal tract. Drug-induced 
thrombocytopenia is a reversible form of thrombocytopenia that should be suspected in a subject who presents with new onset thrombocytopenia or recurrent episodes of acute thrombocytopenia, without an obvious alternative etiology. It is commonly induced by drug-dependent antibodies that cause platelet destruction or clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (drug-induced immune  thrombocytopenia), and less commonly by 
drug-induced bone marrow suppression or autoimmune thrombocytopenia that is initiated by exposure to the offending drug but persists in its absence. The init ial approach to the subject 
with suspected drug-induced thrombocytopenia involves confirming thrombocytopenia, 
establishing a temporal relationship to a drug, and eliminating other causes of thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis is made clinically by documenting prompt resolution of thrombocytopenia after discontinuation of the suspected drug (typically within 1 week). Most

MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 62 of 76 Template 18.0subjects with drug-induced thrombocytopenia require no specific treatment, as their platelet 
counts will recover promptly following withdra wal of the causative agent. See Section 5.5for 
recording AEs.
5.4 Definition of New Onset Chronic Disease
An NOCD is a newly diagnosed medical condition  that is of a chronic, ongoing nature. It is 
observed after receiving the investigational product and is assessed by the investigator as 
medically significant. Examples of NOCDs include, but are not limited to diabetes, autoimmune disease (eg, lupus, rhe umatoid arthritis), and neurological disease (eg, epilepsy). 
Events that would not be considered as NOCDs are mild eczema, diagnosis of a congenital anomaly present at study entry, or acute illness (eg, upper respiratory infection, otitis media, bronchitis). See Section 5.5for recording AEs.
5.5 Recording of Adverse Events
AEs, including SAEs, AESIs, and NOCDs, will be recorded on the eCRF using a recognized 
medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the event. These events will be assessed by 
the investigator for severity, relationship to the investigational product and study procedure(s), 
possible etiologies, and whether the event meets criteria of an SAE (see Sections 5.2and5.6), 
or is an AESI or NOCD (see Sections 5.3, 5.4, and 5.7) and therefore requires immediate 
notification to the sponsor. See Appendix A for guidelines for assessment of AE severity and 
relationship to investigational product. If an  AE evolves into a condition that meets the 
definition of “serious,” it will be reported on the AE form in the eCRF as an SAE.
5.5.1 Time Period for Collection of Adverse Events
AEs and SAEs will be collected from the time of signature of informed consent through 
Day 361. 
All AESIs and NOCDs will be collected fro m the time of dosing through Day 361.
5.5.2 Follow-up of Unresolved Adverse Events
Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’s last  visit are followed up by  the investigator for 
as long as medically indicated but without furt her recording in the eCRF. MedImmune retains 
the right to request additional information for any subject with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the 
end of the study, if judged necessary.
5.5.3 Deaths
All deaths that occur during the study, including the protocol-defined follow-up period must 
be reported as follows:
!Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as an SAE. A post-mortem 
(autopsy) may be helpful in the assessment of the cause of death, and if performed a copy

MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 63 of 76 Template 18.0of the post-mortem results should be forwarded to MedImmune representative(s) within 
the usual timeframes (refer to Section 5.6for additional information).
5.6 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational 
product, or to the study procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF.
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then investigators or other site personnel must 
inform the appropriate sponsor study representativ e(s) within one day ie, immediately but no 
later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated sponsor study representative works with the investigator to ensure that all the 
necessary information is provided to the sponsor patient safety data entry site within 
1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life-threatening events and within 5 calendar days 
of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal or life-threatening AEs where important or relevant information is missing, active 
follow-up is undertaken immediately. Investigat ors or other site pe rsonnel must inform 
sponsor study representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE 
within one calendar day i.e., immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she 
becomes aware of it.
Once the investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the Electronic Data 
Capture (EDC) system, an automated email aler t is sent to inform the designated sponsor 
study representative(s).
If the EDC system is not available, then the i nvestigator or other study site personnel reports 
an SAE to the appropriate sponsor study representative by telephone. The sponsor st udy 
representative will advise the investigator/study site personnel how to proceed.
5.7 Other Events Requiring Immediate Reporting
5.7.1 Overdose
An overdose is defined as a subject receiving a dose of investigational product in excess of 
that specified in the Investigator’s Brochure, unl ess otherwise specified in this protocol.
•An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis on the relevant AE 
modules in the eCRF and on the overdose eCRF module.
•An overdose associated with an SAE must be recorded as an SAE.
•An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the overdose eCRF module.

MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 64 of 76 Template 18.0If an overdose on a MedImmune study drug occurs in the course of the study, then the 
investigator or other site personnel must inform appropriate sponsor study representatives 
immediately, or no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The 
designated sponsor study representative works with the investigator to ensure that all relevant 
information is provided to the sponsor’s patien t safety data entry site. For all overdoses, 
reporting to the data entry site must occur within 24 hours.
5.7.2 Medication Error
For the purposes of this clinical st udy, a medication error is an unintended failure or mistake 
in the treatment process for a MedImmune study drug that either causes harm to the subject or has the potential to cause harm to the subject. 
A medication error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human- or process-related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study site staff or subject.
Medication error includes situations where an error: 
!Occurred
!Was identified and intercepted before the subject received the drug
!Did not occur, but circumstances were recognized that could have led to an error
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
!Dispensing error, eg, medication prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actually given to 
the subject
!Drug not administered as indicated, eg, wrong route or wrong site of administration
!Drug not stored as instructed, eg, kept at room temperature when it should be in the 
refrigerator 
!Wrong subject received the medication (excluding IWRS errors)
!Wrong drug administered to subject (excluding IWRS errors)
Examples of events that do not require reporting as  medication errors in clinical studies:
!Errors related to or resulting from IWRS - including those which lead to one of the above 
listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error 
!Accidental overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
Medication errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may occur as a consequence of the 
medication error.

personnel informs the appropriate MedImmune representatives within 1 day, ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated MedImmune representative works with the investigator to ensure that all 
relevant information is completed within 1 or 5 calendar days if there is an SAE associated 
with the medication error (see Section 5.6) and within 30 days for all other medication errors. 
Medication errors should be reported using a Medication Error Report Form.
5.7.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest
5.7.3.1 Hypersensitivity, Including Anaphylaxis
Events of immediate (type I) hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis (as defined in 
Appendix B ), require that the investigator or other site personnel inform appropriate sponsor 
study representatives immediately, or no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes 
aware of the event. The designated sponsor study representative works with the investigator to 
ensure that all relevant information is provided and entered in EDC. If the event is considered 
serious it must be reported as an SAE (see Section 5.6).
Signs of immediate hypersensitivity include ur ticaria, pruritus, angioedema, skin rash, 
difficulty breathing, and wheezing. Parent(s)/legal representatives will be provided a card with this information to aid in prompt identificat ion and reporting of these signs. Parent(s)/legal 
representatives will be instructed to immediately report the occurrence of any of these findings to the site investigator who should then re port the events to a ppropriate spon sor study 
representatives immediately, or no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of 
the event.
5.7.3.2 Immune Complex Disease
Events of immune complex disease (as defined in Section 5.3.2 ) require that the investigator 
or other site personnel inform appropriate sponsor study representatives immediately, or no 
later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of the event. The designated sponsor 
study representative works with the investigator to ensure that all relevant information is 
provided a nd entered into EDC. If the event is considered serious it must be reported as an 
SAE (see Section 5.6).
5.7.3.3 Thrombocytopenia
Events of thrombocytopeni a (platelet count  < 120,000 per μL) require that the investigator or 
other site personnel inform appropriate sponsor study representatives immediately, or no later 
than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of the event. The designated sponsor study 
representative works with the investigator to ensure that all relevant information is provided

!Provide information and suppor t to the investigator(s)
!Confirm that facilities remain acceptable
!Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately and timely recorded in the eCRFs, that biological samples are handled in 
accordance with the Laboratory Manual a nd that study drug accountability checks are 
being performed
!Perform source data verification (a comparison of the data in the eCRFs with the subject’s 
medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relev ant to the study) 
including verification of informed consent of participating subjects. This will require 
direct access to all original records for each subject (eg, clinic charts)
!Ensure withdrawal of informed consent to the use of the subject’s biological samples is 
reported and biological samples are identified  and disposed of/destroyed accordingly, and 
the action is documented, and reported to the subject.
The MedImmune representative will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other 
staff at the center needs information and advice about the study conduct.

Each subject will be provided with contact information for the Principal Investigator. In 
addition, each subject will receive a toll-free number intended to provide the subject’s physician access to a medical monitor 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in the event of an emergent situation where the subject’s health is deemed to be at risk. In this situation, when a 
subject presents to a medical facility where the treating physician or health care provider 
requires access to a physician who has knowledge of the investigational product and the clinical study protocol and the Principal Investigator is not available, the treating physician or health care provider can contact a medical monitor through this system, which is managed by 
a third party vendor.
7 ETHICAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS
7.1 Subject Data Protection
Each subject will be assigned a SID to ensure that personally identifiable information is kept 
separate from the study data. Subject data that are relevant to the trial, eg, demographic 
information, physical or mental health condition, diagnosis, comorbidities, laboratory test 
results, etc. will only be collected with the s ubject’s informed consent. The informed consent 
form will incorporate (or, in some cases, be accompanied by a separate document incorporating) wording that describes how subject data will be collected, used, and distributed in compliance with relevant data protection and privacy legislation.
7.2 Ethics and Regulatory Review
The IRB/IEC responsible for each site must review and approve the final study protocol, including the final version of the informed consent form and any other written information and/or materials to be provided to the subjects. The IRB/IEC must also approve all advertising 
used to recruit subjects for the study. The i nvestigator is responsible for submitting these 
documents to the applicable IRB/IEC, and distributing them to the study site staff.
The opinion of the IRB/IEC must be given in writing. The investigator must provide a copy of 
the written approval to MedImmune before enrollment of any subject into the study. 
MedImmune should approve any substantive modifications to the informed consent form that 
are needed to meet local requirements.
If required by local regulations, the protocol must be re-approved by the IRB/IEC annually.Before the study is initiated, MedImmune will ensure that the national regulatory authority in 
each country has been notified and their approval has been obtained, as required. MedImmune 
will provide safety updates/reports according to local requirements, including suspected

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 73 of 76 Template 18.0Appendix A Additional Safety Guidance
Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
Life threatening
‘Life-threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the subject’s death. ‘Life-threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospitalization
Outpatient treatment in an ER is not in itself a serious AE, although the reasons for it may be 
(eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema). Hospital admissions and/or surgical operations planned 
before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the 
subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way 
during the study.
Important Medical Event or Medical Intervention
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in death, hospitalization, disability or incapacity bu t may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious. These should usually be considered as serious.
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgment must be used.
Examples of such events are:
!Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring IV hydrocortisone 
treatment
!Hepatotoxicity caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine
!Intensive treatment in an ER or at home for allergic bronchospasm
!Blood dyscra sias (eg, neutropenia or anemia requiring bl ood transfusion) or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization
Assessment of Severity
Assessment of severity is one of the responsibilities of the investigator in the evaluation of 
AEs and SAEs. The determination of severity s hould be made by the investigator based upon 
medical judgment and the severi ty categories of Grade 1 to 5 as defined below.
MedImmune Protocol D5290C00004 (MELODY) Amendment 1
MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 74 of 76 Template 18.0Grade 1 An event of mild intensity that is usually transient and may 
require only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living.
Grade 2 An event of moderate intensity that is usually alleviated with 
additional specific therapeutic intervention. The event interferes 
with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but 
poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.
Grade 3 A severe event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention. 
The event interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects the clinical status of the subject.
Grade 4 An event, and/or its immediate sequelae, that is associated with 
an imminent risk of death.
Grade 5 Death as a result of an event.
It is important to distinguish between serious criteria and severity of an AE. Severity is a 
measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Section 5.2. A Grade 3 
AE need not necessarily be considered an SAE. For example, a Grade 3 headache that persists for several hours may not meet the regulatory defi nition of an SAE and would be considered a 
nonserious event, whereas a Grade 2 seizure resulting in a hospital admission would be 
considered an SAE.
Assessment of Relationship
A guide to Interpreting the Causality Question
The investigator is required to provide an assessment of relationship of AEs and SAEs to the 
investigational product. The followi ng factors should be considered when deciding if there is a 
“reasonable possibility” that an AE may have been caused by the investigational product.
!Time Course. Exposure to suspect investigational product. Has the subject actually 
received the suspect investigational product? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal 
relationship to the administration of the suspect investigational product?
!Consistency with known investigational product profile. Was the AE consistent with the 
previous knowledge of the suspect investigational product (pharmacology and toxicology) or products of the same pharmacological class? OR could the AE be anticipated from its 
pharmacological properties? 
!De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose 
of the suspect investigational product?
MedImmune Protocol D5290C00004 (MELODY) Amendment 1
MEDI8897 01Feb2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 75 of 76 Template 18.0!No alternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another etiology such as 
the underlying disease, other drugs, or other host or environmental factors.
!Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected investigational product was 
reintroduced after having been stopped? MedImmune would not normally recommend or 
support a re-challenge.
!Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship?
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
!Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the investigational product?
!Is there a known mechanism?
Causality of ‘related’ is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expression ‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.
The causality assessment is  performed based on the available data including enough 
information to make an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient information in the 
case, it is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.
Causal relationship in cases where the diseas e under study has deteriorated due to lack of 
effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility.
Relationship to Protocol Procedures
The investigator is also required to provide an assessment of relationship of SAEs to protocol 
procedures on the SAE Report Form. This includes non-TESAEs (ie, SAEs that occur prior to the administration of investigational product) as well as TESAEs. A protocol-related SAE may occur as a result of a procedure or intervention required during the study (eg, blood 
collection, washout of an existing medication). Th e following guidelines should be used by 
investigators to assess the relationship of SAEs to the protocol:
Protocol related: The event occurred due to a procedure/intervention that was described 
in the protocol for which there is no alternative etiology present in the subject’s medical record.
Not protocol related: The event is related to  an etiology other than the procedure/ 
intervention that was described in the protocol (the alternative etiology must be documented in the study subject’s medical record).

Second symposium on the definition and ma nagement of anaphylaxis: Summary report --
Second National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network symposium. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2006;117:391-7.
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis 
Network define anaphylaxis as a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. They recognize 3 categories of anaphylaxis, with criteria designated to capture from 80% of cases (category 1) to > 95% of all cases  of anaphylaxis (for all 3 categories). 
1 Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula)
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING
(a) Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expiratory flow [PEF], hypoxemia)
(b) Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (eg, 
hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)
2 Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that 
patient (minutes to several hours):
(a) Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch-flush, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula)
(b) Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, 
hypoxemia)
(c) Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence)
(d) Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)
3 Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours):
(a) Infants and children: low systolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% decrease in 
systolic BP

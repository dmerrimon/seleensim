 1.2 Background and Rationale  
1.2.1 Epidemiology of High -Risk Multiple  Myeloma  
In 2018, there were over 30,000 new cases of multiple myeloma (MM) and over 10,000 deaths 
from this disease.1 MM is the second most common hematological malignancy in adults after 
lymphoma, with a median survival diagnosis of about 10 years.2 A subgroup of  myeloma  patients 
carry features that confer poor risk and median survival is usually less than 4 years3. Historically, 
these  poor-prognosis patients  have been  identified  using clinical  biomarkers such as 
β2-microglobulin and albumin. Based on these two ma rkers, patients were classified into 3 risk - 
category groups in the International Staging System for Myeloma (ISS). With the advent of analytical methods that can diagnose chromosomal translocations, such as Fluorescence In Situ 
Hybridization (FISH), genomic changes were found to be independent risk factors for prognosis 
of multiple  myeloma  regardless  of treatment.  Based  on the International Myeloma Working Group 
(IMWG) consensus, high- risk chromosomal instabilities include translocations of the IgH locus 
on chromosome 14 with an oncogene such as FGFR3/MMSET on chromosome 4 (t(4;14)) or c - 
MAF  on chromosome 16 (t(14;16)) or MAFB  on chromosome 20 (t(14;20)).
3 These  translocations 
are observed in 15%, 4% and 1% of the newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients, 
respectively.4,5 Beside translocations, deletion of p53 on chromosome 17p, non-hyperdiploid 
karyotype, deletion  13 by karyotype, and gain 1q/loss of 1p (seen  in 7%, 50% 44%, 30% of newly 
diagnosed multiple  myeloma  patients,  respectively)  are also associated  with poor survival. 4,5 Each 
of these genomic aberrations has independently similar impact on the outcome of multiple myeloma  patients  while  their combination further reduces  overall  survival. For example,  the triple 
combination of an adverse IgH translocation, gain(1q), and del(17p) was associated  with a median 
overall  survival (OS)  of 9.1 months.
6 Chromosomal aberrations  showing improved outcomes were 
also identified, such as trisomies 3 and 5.7,8 When both favorable and unfavorable cytogenetics 
coincide in the same patient, the unfavorable findings tend to dominate the clinical  picture8,9. 
1.2.2 Definition of High -Risk Multiple  Myeloma  
High risk disease is defined by IMWG consensus.3 IMWG defines high-r isk disease as either R -
ISS Stage III or by one or more high- risk cytogenetic abnormalities (CAs). 3 R-ISS Stage III is 
defined as serum β -microglobulin ≥5.5 mg/L and either high risk CA by iFISH or high LDH.10 
High –risk CAs are 1) t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), del(17/17p), non- hyperdiploid karyotype, 
gain(1q), del 13, gain 1q, or a high- risk signature on gene expression profile (GEP).  
 
1.2.3 Treatment of High -Risk Multiple  Myeloma  
Bortezomib  partly  overcomes  the adverse effect  of t(4;14) and possibly del(17p) on CR, PFS,  and 
OS.11-15 A meta -analysis of 4 randomized trials showed that the odds of post -transplantation deep 
response rate (VGPR or better) were similar in high -risk cytogenetics (del(17p) and t(4;14)) and 
standard risk cytogenetics when bortezomib was used in the induction treatment.13 An integrated 
analysis of phase III trials demonstrates PFS benefit in patients with t(4;14) but lacking del(17p) and in del(17p) lacking t(4;14) but not in patients carrying both abnormalities.
16 Thus, a 
bortezomib- based induction regimen, and if patient is eligible followed by high dose 
therapy/ASCT, ideally  shortly after completion  of 6-8 cycles  of initial therapy, is the recommended 
treatment in NDMM with high -risk features.3 Typically after 3 -4 cycles of multi -drug induction 
regimen, treatment is paused briefly for stem cell collection and then treatment is completed to  6- 
DC11B Clinical Trial protocol, v1.0  Page 11 of 61

 8 cycles.  However,  this regimen  results in MRD -negativity  in only 20% of patients17 and CR only 
in 30-35%18,19 of patients,  and the median  Event- Free Survival remains  at 14-24 months depending 
on the cytogenetic abnormality.11 In patients who do not receive ASCT in frontline therapy but 
receive PI/lenalidomide  based  regimen,  achieve 15% CR20 and with addition of cyclophosphamide 
35% CR with only half of them being MRD negative.21 Thus, there is clear need for intensifying 
the upfront treatment in this patient population. Despite this need, there is no consensus on the 
appropriate subsequent therapy for these patients. Prevailing approaches include proteasome 
inhibitor/immunomodula tory drug combination maintenance, a second autotransplant, or even an 
allotransplant.3,16,22 A meta -analysis  of 4 European trials  showed that double ASCT  combined with 
a bortezomib -based treatment regimen partially abrogates poor PFS in patients carrying both 
t(4;14) and del(17p)16, and limited  data with RVD  maintenance given up to 3 years  post-transplant 
suggests some benefit in a group with del p53, del 1p; (t(4;14) or t(14;16)) with an sCR rate of 
50%.23 Although long- term PFS can be achieved with allogeneic HSCT, the benefits of graft - 
versus- myeloma effect are limited by high treatment- related mortality (TRM), approaching 40% 
for myeloablative transplantations.24 Clinical trial enrollment for high -risk NDMM is therefore 
recommended by multiple expert  groups.18,22 
1.2.4 MRD as Clinical Outcome in Myeloma  Patients  
MRD  testing  in NDMM  patients  following first-line therapy  was originally  developed using multi- 
color flow cytometry,25 which has been widely used in several trials for multiple myeloma.26,27 
Due to their superior sensitivity, genomic testing like Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) or IgH 
became the preferred method of MRD testing. Specifically, flow cytometry -based MRD assa ys 
can detect 1 myeloma cell in 100,000 bone marrow cells; current genetic MRD assays can detect 1 myeloma cell in 1,000,000 bone marrow cells.
28 This is important because the depth of MRD 
correlates with PFS.29,30,31,32 Data are limited in patients with h igh-risk myeloma but also show 
that MRD  is an independent risk factor  in high- risk myeloma.33 Therefore  multiple  expert  reviews 
propose that MRD testing should and will become a primary regulatory efficacy endpoint.3,22,34 
1.2.5 CAR- T Therapy in Multiple  Myeloma  
B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), also known as tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily 
member 17 (TNFRSF17) or CD269, is consistently and selectively expressed on normal plasma 
and myeloma cells.35 For this reason, it is a preferred target antigen for CAR immunotherapy of 
MM. Upon engagement by its ligands, i.e., TNFSF13 (APRIL: a proliferation- inducing ligand; 
CD256) and TNFSF13B  (BAFF:  B cell-activating  factor;  also known as BLYS  or CD257), BCMA 
supports survival of plasma  cells.36 
A CAR construct against BCMA was originally developed at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and was introduced into CD3+ cells using a viral transduction system that inserts the gene permanently into the genome of  the T -cell. At the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 9x10
6 
cells/kg, 63% of the patients achieved very good partial response (VGPR) or better.37 Given the 
promising efficacy  of the virally  transduced  anti-BCMA  CAR T- cells,  several  other groups created 
permanently modified anti -BCMA CAR T -cells now in clinical testing. Bluebird Bio’s anti- 
BCMA -CAR T -cell construct has completed its phase II trial in relapsed refractory patients who 
progressed after at least 2 lines of therapy demonstrated an impressive 85% overall response rate (ORR) with 45% of the patients having CR or better response.
38,39 Another product originally 
developed in China was recently evaluated in relapsed refractory patients during a Phase I  multi- 
DC11B Clinical Trial protocol, v1.0  Page 12 of 61

 center trial in USA and showed  100% ORR with 61% of the patients achieving CR or better.40 
Similar highly promising result are reported for several other anti -BCMA CAR -T cell products 
developed by different groups confirming the high potency of anti -BCMA CAR T -cells in killing 
myeloma cells. More importantly, this potency is seen across all risk groups, including patients 
with adverse  cytogenetics  suggesting that CAR T- cell mediated  killing  is independent of resistance 
mechanisms generated by high- risk chromosomal  aberrations.  
 
The pote ncy of virally transduced CAR therapies comes with significant risks. All clinical trials 
of virally transduced CAR T -cells have recorded serious instances of cytokine release syndrome 
(CRS)  and neurological toxicity.  In the recent  American  Society  of Blood and Marrow  Transplant 
(ASBMT) consensus meeting, CRS was defined as “a supraphysiologic response following any 
immune therapy that results in the activation or engagement of endogenous or infused T cells 
and/or other immune  effector  cells.  Symptoms c an be progressive, must  include fever  at the onset, 
and may include hypotension, capillary leak (hypoxia) and end organ dysfunction.”41 CRS is a 
prototypical systemic  inflammatory  response syndrome that occurs  hours to days after CAR T- cell 
infusion. Signs  and symptoms include fever, myalgia, malaise, and, in more severe cases, a 
capillary  leak syndrome associated  with hypoxia, hypotension, and occasionally  renal  dysfunction 
and coagulopathy. Peak CAR T -cells as a result of in vivo proliferation has been strongly 
associated with the severity of CRS in many CAR  T -cell  studies.42,43  The  proliferation  of 
CAR T- cells upon engagement  with target  antigen  drives them  to secrete cytokines that initiates  a 
cascade of systemic  inflammatory  events.  Among all cytokines elevated  during CRS,  IL-6 plays  a 
central  role as neutralization  of this cytokine quickly and effectively  reverses  clinical  deterioration 
in most  cases.  
 
The first presenting symptom of CRS is usually fever associated with mild constitutional symptoms
.42,44-46 In a number of patients, the initial mild symptoms progress over the course of 
hours to days and turn into a systemic  inflammatory  syndrome c haracterized  by sinus tachycardia, 
hypotension and hypoxia. In severe cases, patients may require mechanical ventilation and 
vasopressors.  CRS  can start as early  as the day of CAR T- cell infusion and in most  cases  it occurs 
within the first 14 days following the infusion. Severe cases appear to occur closer to the time of infusion and the severity of CRS was reported to correlate with peak CAR T -cell levels as 
mentioned above as well as disease burden
42,43 and addition of preconditioning 
chemotherapy.43,44,46,47 
Neurotoxicity associated  with CAR T- cell treatment,  now named  “Immune effector  cell-associated 
neurotoxicity syndrome” (ICANS) in the ASBMT consensus panel document, is described as “a disorder characterized  by a pathologic process  involving the central  nervous system  following any 
immune therapy that results in the activation or engagement of endogenous or infused T cells and/or other immune effector cells. Reported neurologic toxicities include headaches, confusion, 
alterations in wakefulness, hallucinations, dysphasia, ataxia, apraxia, facial nerve palsy, tremor, 
dysmetria,  and seizures
43-45,48- 53. Neurotoxicity  has been  reported  in several  anti-CD19  CAR T- cell 
trials and severe cerebral edema lead to death in a small number of patients54,55. However, it has 
occurred  less frequently in anti-BCMA  CAR T- cell trials37,39. Factors  that underlie CRS  like peak 
CAR T -cell levels44,46,54,56 or cytokine levels43,48,52,57 are also associated with  neurotoxicity. 
Several grading systems have been developed for CAR T -cell-re lated CRS and neurotoxicity and 
this protocol uses grading developed based on ASBMT consensus criteria.41

2.2 Screening, Evaluation and Enrollment  
2.2.1 Recruitment of  Patients  
Subjects will be identified through the clinical practices of the  investigator or sub-investigators 
and through referrals from outside hospitals and physicians. Patients diagnosed with high- risk 
multiple myeloma can be referred any time after they complete induction therapy. Patient should 
be enrolled and treated with D escartes -11 prior to ASCT if they are transplant eligible. If the 
patient  does not have cells available at the time of screening  (See Section  3.3.1.1  for details),  they 
can be referred to Sponsor’s Cell Collection Protocol (See Appendix B ). 
 
2.2.2 Screening  Evaluation 
Please refer to Section 4.1.1 for Screening visit evaluations.  
 
2.2.3 Enrollment  
To enroll a subject on this study, the following documents are required:  
• Copy of signed/dated consent and HIPAA  Authorization 
• Source documentation to confirm  enrollment/eligibility  
2.2.4 Early Withdrawal of  Subjects  
Patients who do not complete at least one Descartes -11 infusion will be considered to have 
prematurely discontinued the study. The reasons for premature discontinuation mus t be recorded 
on the case report form. Final study evaluations will be completed at the time of discontinuation. Provided that all protocol requirements are satisfied for the trial to continue safely, patients who 
withdraw early from the study will not be counted toward study recruitment limits.  
 
2.2.5 Data Collection and Follow -Up of Early Withdrawals 
Patients who withdraw early from the study and who have provided consent for follow -up data 
collection  will be eligible  for continued data collection  for up to one year.  Withdrawn  patients  who 
are followed at other institutions  or practices,  because of preference  or geographical concerns,  will 
confer follow -up via notes from their local physician and/or phone interviews. Toxicity and other 
clinical assessments will be obtained from the treating physician and recorded into appropriate 
case report form (CRF). In the event a subject fails to complete the follow -up requirements, all 
attempts  to contact  the subject  including: 1) at least three telephone contacts  (on different  days and 
at different times of the day), and 2) a certified letter will be  documented.

 3.3.5.3  Granulocyte Colony -Stimulating  Factor 
If the absolute neutrophil count becomes less than 1000/microliter and there is suspicion of or 
documented bacterial infecti on, then based on the investigator’s discretion, growth factor support 
can be given. Growth factors should be discontinued once the ANC is above 1000/microliter.  
 
3.3.5.4  Corticosteroids  
Patients should not take systemic corticosteroids (including prednisone, dexamethasone or any other corticosteroid) that exceeds a dose equivalent to 40 mg/day or more of prednisone for any purpose without approval of the Principle Investigator. In addition, corticosteroids should be 
withheld for 12 hours before and 24 hour after the Descartes -11 infusion.  
 
3.4 Anti -Myeloma Treatment Following  Descartes -11 
After all Descartes -11 infusions and the Day 28 response assessment are completed, further anti - 
myeloma treatment can be administered. The treatment choice is left to investigator’s discretion. 
If the patient is eligible for transplant, high dose chemotherapy and ASCT can be given. Patient 
will be followed -up during this period to evaluate the clinical outcomes for secondary objectives.

Completion  of each cycle includes a response  assessment  visit.  Patients  will be taken  off treatment 
for the  following: 
• General  or specific  changes  in the patient's condition render  the patient  unacceptable for further 
treatment on this study in the judgment of the  investigator. 
• Any Descartes -11-related  Grade 3 to 5 toxicity  occurring within  the 14 days immediately  after 
infusion of the drug product, with the following exceptions:  
• ≤Grade 3 to 4 Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) lasting <7 days 
• Grade 2 CRS associated with fever, hypotension or hypoxia lasting less than 72 hours 
(i.e., improves to ≤Grade 1 CRS in less than 72 hours) 
• Non-hematologic toxicities: 
o Fever of any grade, including febrile  neutropenia 
o ≤Grade 3 diarrhea lasting <72  hours 
o ≤Grade 3 nausea and/or vomiting lasting <72 hours 
o ≤Grade 3 fatigue lasting <7  days 
o ≤Grade 4 transaminase, bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), or creatinine 
elevation lasting <7  days 
• Hematologic  toxicities:  
o ≤Grade 3 neutropenia of any duration or Grade 4 neutropenia lasting <28 days 
o ≤Grade 3 anemia of any duration or Grade 4 anemia lasting <28 days 
o ≤Grade  3 thrombocytopenia of any duration or Grade  4 thrombocytopenia lasting  
<28 days  
o All cytopenias except neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia as described above 
The National Cancer  Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) 
Version 5 will be used to grade toxicities during the trial unless specified above.  
 
4.5.2 Criteria for Off-Study  
Patients will be taken off study for the following:  
• The patient voluntarily withdraws  
• There is significant patient  noncompliance 
• Death  
• Development of progressive or relapsed MM after completing Descartes -11 infusions 
 
Patients must be followed until all adverse events have resolved to grade 2 or less other than 
lymphopenia or alopecia.  If an adverse event  is not expected  to resolve to Grade 2 or less, this will 
be noted in the patient medical record and the patient will be taken off -study. Patients, upon 
obtaining consent, will also be followed for additional clinical outcomes like overall  survival.

 Safety, Adverse Events, Protocol Deviation and Stopping 
Rules  
5.1 Definitions  
5.1.1 Adverse Events  (AE)  
An adverse event  (AE)  is defined  as any reaction,  side effect,  or untoward event  that occurs  during 
the clinical trial associated with the use of a test article in humans, whether or not the event is considered  related  to the treatment  or clinically  significant.  For this study, AEs will include events 
reported  by the patient,  as well as clinically  significant abnormal findings on physical examination 
or laboratory  evaluation. A new illness,  symptom, sign or worsening of a pre- existing  condition or 
abnormality is considered an AE. An abnormal laboratory value will be considered an AE if the laboratory abnormality is characterized by any of the  following: 
• Results in discontinuation from the  study 
• Is associated with clinical signs or  symptoms 
• Requires treatment or any other therapeutic intervention 
• Is associated with death or another serious adverse event, including  hospitalization.  
• Is judged by the Investigator to be of significant clinical  impact  
 
All AEs, including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory evaluations, regardless 
of severity, will be followed until satisfactory resolution.  
 
5.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction  
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there i s a reasonable possibility 
that the test article  caused  the adverse event.  For the purposes of IND safety  reporting, “reasonable 
possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the test article and the adverse event.  A suspect ed adverse reaction  implies  less certainty  about causality  than adverse 
reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a test  article.  
 
5.1.3 Serious Unexpected Adverse Reaction  (SUSAR)  
An adverse event  or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  "unexpected"  if it is not listed  in the 
investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information 
described  in the general  investigational plan or elsewhere in the current  application. "Unexpected" 
also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of the test article or as anticipated  from the pharmacological 
properties of the drug but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the test article under investigation. 

DC11B Clinical Trial protocol, v 1.0  Page 34 of 61  
This document is the confidential property of the Cartesian Therapeutics.  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by Cartesian in writing.   
 5.1.4 Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following:  
• Death within 30 days of Descartes -11 infusion 
• Grade 4 or 5 CRS, infusion reaction,  neurotoxicity 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (except for protocol - 
mandated ~24- hour admission for observation due to new -onset fever)  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions 
• A congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a SAE experience when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this  definition. 
 
 
5.1.5 Protocol Deviation 
A one -time, unintentional action or process that departs from the IRB -approved study protocol, 
involving one incident and identified  retrospectively,  after the event  occurred.  Any leukapheresis - 
related failure or deviation will be recorded, even if it does not constitute a per -protocol AE. 
 
5.2 Recording of Adverse  Events  
5.2.1 Adverse Event Recording  Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the protocol therapy completion. For this study, 
collection of adverse events will begin with enrollment until the subject is off -study. Serious 
Adverse Event reporting period starts with leukapheresis and ends at 30 days after last Descartes - 
11 infusion.  
 
All unresolved adverse events  should be followed by the investigator until the events  are resolved, 
the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained. At the last scheduled 
visit, the investigator should instruct each subject to report any sus pected adverse event(s) that 
might reasonably be related to participation in this study. The investigator should notify the Sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or 
terminated study participation if th e event may reasonably be related to this study. The Sponsor 
should also be notified  if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer  or of 
a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in 
this study.  
 
5.2.2 Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization or  Surgery  
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be 
documented and reported as a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise as  
DC11B Clinical Trial protocol, v 1.0  Page 35 of 61  
This document is the confidential property of the Cartesian Therapeutics.  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by Cartesian in writing.   
 below. Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the 
condition meets  the criteria  for an adverse event.  Neither  the condition, hospitalization,  prolonged 
hospitalization, nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances:  
 
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical procedures for a preexisting condition. Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if 
the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was  uneventful. 
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for therapy of the target disease of the study, 
unless there is clinical  worsening or an increase  in frequency  of hospital admissions  as judged 
by the clinical  investigator. 
• Hospitalization for protocol -mandated 24- hour observation following new onset of fever 
following infusion of  Descartes -11. 
 
 
5.2.3 Pregnancies  
To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy in a patient on study treatment must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy must be followed up to 
determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the 
presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital  abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn 
complications. Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Study Pregnancy Form and reported by the investigator to the Sponsor. Pregnancy  follow -up should be recorded  on the same  form  and 
must include an assessmen t of the possible relationship to the study treatment of any pregnancy 
outcome. Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported on the SAE Report Form. 
Pregnancy outcomes must be collected for the female partners of any males who took study 
treatment  in this study. Consent to report information  regarding these  pregnancy outcomes should 
be obtained from the  mother. 
 
5.2.4 Recording of Adverse Events  
At each contact with the subject during the adverse  event  recording  period  (defined  in  Section 5.2.1), the investigator must seek information on adverse events by specific questioning 
and, as appropriate, by examination. Information on all adverse events should be recorded 
immediately in the source document, and in the appropriate adverse event module of the case 
report form (CRF). All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures 
results  should be recorded  in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis. 
To the extent possible, adverse events should be recorded as a diagnosis and symptoms used to make the diagnosis recorded within the diagnosis event. Do not list symptoms if a diagnosis can 
be assigned. 
 
Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent should be recorded in the 
Medical History CRF. Any condition listed in a subject’s medical history for which the severity 
increases at the time of, or post -Descartes -11 infusion, should be ca ptured as an adverse event.  
 
Adverse events (including lab abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a 
diagnosis whenever  possible, rather  than individual underlying signs and symptoms. When  a clear 
diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate Adverse Event. The clinical  course of each event  should be followed until resolution, stabilization,  or until 
DC11B Clinical Trial protocol, v 1.0  Page 36 of 61

Do not disclose or use except as authorized by Cartesian in writing.   
 it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause. As detailed as 
possible, each adverse event should be evaluated to determine:  
 
• The severity grade (CTCAE Version 5.0 Grade  1-5) 
• Its duration (start and end dates)  
• Its relati onship to the study treatment:  Is there a reasonable possibility  that the AE is related  to 
Descartes -11- No (unrelated) or Yes. If yes - is the event definitely, probably, possibly or 
unlikely related to the investigational treatment (Descartes -11). 
• Action taken with respect to study or investigational treatment (none, dose adjusted, 
temporarily interrupted, permanently discontinued, unknown, not  applicable)  
• Whether medication or therapy taken (i.e., no concomitant medication/non- drug therapy, 
concomitant medication/non-drug therapy) 
• Whether it is serious, as defined in Section  5.1. 
 
All adverse events should be treated appropriately. If a concomitant medication or non-drug therapy  is given, this action  should be recorded  on the Adverse Event CRF.  Adverse events  should 
be entered into the eCRF system within 10 working days from the knowledge of the event took 
place. Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is 
judged to be permanent, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if 
necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study treatment, the 
interventions required to treat it, and the  outcome. 
 
Progression of malignancy (including fatal outcomes), documented appropri ately in the medical 
records,  should not be reported  as a serious adverse event.  Adverse events  that occur  concurrently 
with the progression of malignancy but that are not related to disease progression (i.e., deep vein 
thrombosis) will be reported as an a dverse event as described  above. 
 
5.2.5 SAE and SUSAR  Reporting  
To ensure patient safety, every SAE and SUSAR, regardless of suspected causality, occurring 
during the adverse event  reporting period defined  in Section  5.2.1  must  be reported  to the Sponsor 
within  24 hours of learning  of its occurrence.  Recurrent  episodes, complications,  or progression of 
the initial SAE must be reported as follow -up information is received. An SAE occurring at a 
different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one 
should be reported separately as a new  event.  
 
5.2.5.1  Study Sponsor Notification by the  Investigator 
Any SUSAR and SAE as defined in Section 5.1 must be reported to the Sponsor by email or fax 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. To the extent possible, adverse events should be 
recorded as a diagnosis. Do not list symptoms if a diagnosis can be assigned. At the time of the 
initial notification, a serious adverse event (SAE) re port form should be filled. Following 
parameters will be asked in the form:  
• Subject  information  
• A description of the event (if there is a diagnosis, it should be  included) 
• Date of  onset 
DC11B Clinical Trial protocol, v 1.0  Page 37 of 61  
This document is the confidential property of the Cartesian Therapeutics.  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by Cartesian in writing.   
 • Current status  
• Whether study treatment was  discontinued 
• The reason why the event is classified as  serious 
• Investigator assessment of the association between the event and study  treatment  
• Concomitant medications when the event  happened 
• Narrative summary of the  event  
 
Follow-up information  on this event  should be reported  when  received.  The follow-up information 
should describe 1) whether  the event  has resolved  or continues, 2) if and how it was treated,  and 
3) whether the patient continued or withdrew from study participation.  
 
5.2.5.2  IRB Notification by the  Investigator 
Following events should be reported to IRB:  
 
• Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in terms 
of severity or frequency. For  example:  
• Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more frequent than 
initially  expected.  
• Chan ge in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or biologic 
used in a research  protocol. 
• Breach of  confidentiality.  
• Change to the protocol taken  without prior  IRB review  to eliminate  apparent  immediate  hazard 
to a research  participant. 
• Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks, or the complaint 
cannot be resolved by the research team.  
• Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the IRB approved protocol) that in the opinion of the investigator placed one or more participants at increased 
risk or affects the rights or welfare of  subjects.  
 
Deaths that occur during the study should be reported within the IRB -specified time frame. 
For reportable deaths, the initial submission to the IRB may be made by contacting the IRB 
Director  or Associate  Director.  The AE/Unanticipated  Problem Form is required  as a follow up to 
the initial  submission. 
 
5.2.5.3  FDA Notification by the Study  Sponsor  
The Sponsor is required to report certain study events in an expedited fashion to the FDA. These written notifications of adverse events are referred to as IND safety reports. The sponsor m ust 
report an IND safety report as described in: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/U  
CM227351.pdf 
DC11B Clinical Trial protocol, v 1.0  Page 38 of 61  
This document is the confidential property of the Cartesian Therapeutics.  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by Cartesian in writing.   
 The following  describes  the safety  reporting requirements  by timeline  for reporting and associated 
type of  event:  
 
• Within  7 Calendar Days any study event  that is unexpected,  fatal or life-threatening  suspected 
adverse reaction.  
• Within  15 Calendar Days any study event  that is unexpected, suspected  adverse reaction  that 
is serious, but not fatal or life -threatening -or- a previous adverse event that was not initially 
deemed reportable but is later found to fit the criteria for reporting, any finding from tests in 
laboratory animals that suggest a significant risk for  human subjects including reports of 
mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity or reports of significant organ toxicity at or near the expected human  exposure. 
 
5.3 Medical  Monitor  
The medical  monitor will be a Sponsor physician or Sponsor-appointed physician with appropriate 
experience and Board  Certification  to oversee study conduct on the Sponsor’s behalf,  consult with 
site investigators, review and synthesize safety information from the various clinical sites, and to apply study- stopping criteria. All decisions by the medical monitor affecting study conduct, 
including the application of study- stopping or dose -escalation rules, will be documented in the 
study record.  
 
5.4 Recording of Protocol  Deviations  
If the impact on the protocol disrupts the study design, may affect the outcome (objectives), or 
compromises the safety and welfare of the subjects, the deviation must be reported to the medical monitor within three business days. Include the following information on the Sponsor -supplied 
exception/deviation form: protocol number, subject study number, description of the exception/deviation from protocol and rationale. Ensure all completed exception/deviation forms 
are signed by the Site Investigator and submitted to the Study Sponsor and medical monitor for 
review. Once approval of the exception request or acknowledgement of the deviation has been granted by the Sponsor and medical monitor, the exception or deviation will be submitted to IRB 
and all other applicable committees.  
 
Other dev iations should be explained in a memo to file (example: a subject missing a visit is not 
an issue unless a critical/important treatment or procedure was missed and must have been performed at that specific time).  
 
5.5 Stopping Rules and Study  Termination 
Premature termination of the clinical trial may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, change in opinion of the IRB or medical monitor. Additionally, recruitment may be stopped for 
reasons of particularly low recruitment, protocol violations, or  inadequate data recording. 
Specifically, study will be stopped if:  
 
• Study Sponsor or a Regulatory Body decides for any reason that subject safety may be 
compromised by continuing the  study. 
• The Sponsor decides to discontinue the development of the intervention to be used in this 
study. 
DC11B Clinical Trial protocol, v 1.0  Page 39 of 61  
This document is the confidential property of the Cartesian Therapeutics.  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by Cartesian in writing.   
  
The study will be paused if:  
 
• There is death that is reasonably attributed to study drug within the first 30 days after first 
infusion 
• Two subjects with Grade 4 adverse events to vital organs that are assessed as probably or 
definitely related to study drug within the 14days after last  infusion 
 
If the study is paused for the reasons above, the PI and members of the study team will meet in person or by teleconference within 24 hours of the event to have a thorough discussion of the event. Meeting minutes capturing the review of any ongoing investigations, including next steps 
in the management of the subject and any proposed changes to the protocol will be forwarded to 
the medical monitor. If all parties agree as to the event resolution, then the pause will be lifted. If 
the study is paused for manufacturing reasons, the Sponsor will make recommendations for 
process improvements to be implemented. Pending successful completion of a process validation 
run, the manufacturing pause will be lifted.

 Statistical Considerations  
Statistical analysis will be described in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan.  
 
Briefly, with respect to sample size: the primary endpoint will be the proportion of responders, 
i.e., patients  who are MRD -negative with sCR at the Day 28 Visit.  This is an open- label  study, and 
the null hypothesis is that the responder rate will not differ from  the natural  rate of MRD -negative 
sCR at the end of consolidation, as observed in the literature. We determined that this natural rate 
is 10%.19,31,64,69-73 For purposes of power calculations, we assume that the response rate will be 
35%. With these assumptions, a sample size of 34 will provide 80% power to detect a one -tailed 
difference at the 95% confidence  level.

 Ethical Considerations  
7.1 General  Issues  
This study is to be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice 
(FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable 
government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures. 
 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted i ndependent 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) for formal approval of the study conduct. The decision of the IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator and a copy of 
this decision  will be provided to the sponsor before  commencement  of this study. The investigator 
should provide a list of IRB members and their affiliations to the  Sponsor. 
 
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this 
study. The consent form will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by the IRB 
for the study. The formal consent of a subject, using the IRB -approved consent form, must be 
obtained before that subject  is submitted  to any study procedure. This consent form  must  be signed 
by the subject or legally acceptable surrogate, and the investigator -designated research 
professional obtaining the  consent. 
 
7.2 Rationale for Subject  Selection  
The patients to be entered in this protocol have MM which is an almost always incurable disease and therefore these patients have limited life expectancies. Subjects from both genders and all 
racial/ethnic groups are eligible for this study if they meet the eligibility criteria. To date, there is 
no information that suggests that differences in disease response would be expected in one group 
compared to another. It is not considered reasonable to administer a previously uncharacterized 
cell therapy to preg nant or lactating women. Children do not develop MM. Efforts will be made 
to extend accrual to a representative population, but in this preliminary study, a balance must be struck  between  patient  safety  considerations and limitations  on the number of individuals exposed 
to potentially toxic and/or ineffective treatments on the one hand and the need to explore gender and ethnic aspects of clinical research on the other hand. If differences in outcome that correlate 
to gender or to ethnic identity are noted, accrual may be expanded, or a follow -up study may be 
written to investigate those differences more  fully.  
 
7.3 Evaluation of Benefits and Risks  
Clinical trial summarized  above demonstrated  that targeting  BCMA  in MM by the CAR  construct 
that will be used in the current protocol demonstrated mainly activity- associated toxicity and no 
off-target  or on- target  off-tumor effects.  Furthermore,  as noted above, Descartes -11 is expected  to 
have even a better safety profile than the one u sed in that trial. Taken together, the potential 
benefits of the trial outweigh its  risks.

 7.4 Recordkeeping  
7.4.1 Source Data  
Source data is all information,  original records  of clinical  findings, observations, or other activities 
in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. Source data are 
contained in source documents. Examples of these original documents and data records include 
hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subject diaries or 
evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, 
copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiches, 
photographic negatives,  microfilm or magnetic  media,  x-rays,  subject  files,  and records  kept at the 
pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments involved in the clinical trial. 
 
7.4.2 Case Report  Forms  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collecti on instrument for the study. All  data 
requested on the CRF must be recorded. All entries will be entered into an electronic data  capture 
system (eCRF). The Principal Investigator is responsible for assuring that the data entered into 
eCRF is complete, accurate, and that entry and updates are performed in a timely  manner.  
 
7.4.3 Confidentiality  
The investigator must ensure anonymity of the patients; patients must not be identified by names in any documents submitted  to the sponsor. Signed informed consent forms  and patient  enrollment 
log must be kept strictly confidential to enable patient identification at the site. Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the Health 
Insurance Portability  and Accountability  Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed 
subject authorization informing the subject of the  following: 
 
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this  study 
• Who will have access to that information and why 
• Who will use or disclose that  information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their  PHI. 
 
If a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by regulation, retains the 
ability  to use all information  collected  prior  to the revocation  of subject  authorization. For subjects 
that have revoked authorization to collect  or use PHI,  attempts  should be made to obtain permission 
to collect at least vital status (i.e., that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study 
period. 
 
7.4.4 Records  Retention  
It is the sponsor’s responsibility to retain study essential documents f or at least 2 years after the 
last approval of a marketing application in their country and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in their country or at least 2 years have elapsed since the 
formal discontinuation of clinical dev elopment of the investigational product. These documents 
should be retained for a longer period if required by a Regulatory Body.

 Appendix  A MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES FOR CAR 
T-CELL-RELATED TOXICITIES  
The clinical signs and symptoms of CAR T -related toxicities guide the grading and management 
of CRS and neurotoxicity. This protocol adapts management recommendations described by Lee et al.
41 A copy of this reference will be provided to the investigator a nd staff are encouraged to 
review it prior to enrolling the first patient. The following is recommended:  
 
1. All patients with suspicion of CRS or fever above 37.9°C should be admitted for at least a 
24-hour observation. 
2. Infectious disease work -up with blood cultures should be initiated each time CRS is 
suspected. Empiric broad- spectrum intravenous antibiotics are  recommended.  
3. Vital signs should be checked at least every 4 hours with strict urine input and output 
monitoring. 
4. Patients  with poor oral intake should be started  on intravenous fluids. Patients  with 80% of 
their baseline systolic blood pressure (or if systolic BP<90mmHg) should be given a 0.5-
1 L fluid  bolus. Fluid  boluses can be repeated  as needed;  however, they should be kept to a 
minimum with a low threshold of starting low dose vasopressor as the capillary leak 
during CRS can lead to fluid overload. 
5. Patients should be transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)  if: 
a. the patient’s systolic pressure does not respond to the first fluid bolus;  
b. the patient requires 2 or more fluid boluses within 24 hours; 
c. the patient’s heart rate remains above 125/min for at least 4  hours; 
d. the patient’s supplemental oxygen requirement is more than 40% FiO2;  or 
e. the patient has >Grade 2  neurotoxicity. 
6. Patients admitted to the ICU should have the  following: 
a. vital signs checked every 2 hours; 
b. cardiac enzymes, ECG and echocardiogram  evaluation; 
c. if systolic blood pressure is below 75% of baseline or below 85 mmHg, 
norepinephrine should be  started; 
d. CBC should be checked twice a day and cytopenias should be treated as  follows: 
i. blood transfusion to keep Hgb above 8.0  g/dL; 
ii. platelet transfusion to keep platelet above  20k; 
iii. growth factors for neutropenia can be started if ANC is below 1000/ µL. 
Filgr astim is recommended due to a shorter half -life compared with 
pegfilgrastim.  
7. Tocilizumab at the FDA -approved dose for CRS should be administered in the following 
circumstances:  
a. grade 3  CRS;  
b. grade 2 CRS that is not resolving within 72 hours;  or 
grade 2 CRS in the context of other co- morbidities or old age.  
DC11B Clinical Trial protocol, v 1.0  Page 50 of 61  
This document is the confidential property of the Cartesian Therapeutics.  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by Cartesian in writing.   
 8. TOCILIZUMAB SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN FOR ISOLATED NEUROTOXOCITY.  
9. If the patient  does not respond to tocilizumab  within  12 hours, a repeat  dose of tocilizumab 
can be given. If  the  patient  does  not  respond  to  the  second  dose,  corticosteroids  
(i.e. methylprednisolone 1mg/kg every 12 hours) should be  prescribed.  
10. Patients who are recovering from CRS should not be discharged until they are afebrile for 
at least 24  hours. 
11. If neurotoxicity is suspected, the patient should be evaluated with the Immune Effector 
Cell Encephalopathy (ICE) scale41. Patients with Grade 2 neurotoxicity should get a 
neurology consult and thorough evaluation, e.g., with lumbar puncture and MRI, for  other 
etiologies.  
12. Patients  who have Descartes -11 related  neurotoxicity (except  for headache)  should receive 
dexamethasone in the following situations at 10mg/kg every 4- 6 hours until symptoms 
regress to Grade 1: 
a. grade 3 neurotoxi city lasting for 24  hours; 
b. grade 4 neurotoxicity;  or 
c. any generalized seizure (in conjunction with other anti -seizure therapies).

Do not disclose or use except as authorized by Cartesian in writing.   
 • If the patient  is on anticoagulation therapy,  there  should be no contraindication for holding 
the drug during the apheresis  procedure 
8. If the subject is actively on a medication for treatment of an oncologic disease, there should 
be a minimum of 7 days between the last dose and the leukapheresis procedure. If the agent 
is a monoclonal antibody then wash- out should be minimum of 21 days and if it is an 
experimental agent then it should be 5  half-lives.  
 
 
2.2 Exclusion  Criteria  
1. Major chronic illness that is not well managed at the time of study entry and in the opinion of 
the investigator may increase the risk to the  patient.  
2. Any other laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the investigator, may jeopardize the subject’s ability to participate in the  study. 
3. Any active significant cardiac or pulmonary disease. Note: Patients with asthma and COPD 
controlled with inhaled medications are  allow ed. 
4. Treatment with any investigational agent within 4 weeks of screening or 5 half -lives of the 
investigational drug (whichever is  longer). 
5. History of significant recurrent infections or any active infection at screening visit.  
6. Patient is pregnant or  lactating.  
 
 
2.3 Screening, Evaluation and Enrollment  
2.3.1 Recruitment of  Patients  
Subjects  who are enrolled  into a study using Descartes  products will be referred  for cell collection.  
 
2.3.2 Screening  Evaluation 
Please refer to Section 4.1.1 for Screening visit evaluations.  
 
2.3.3 Enrollment  
To enroll a subject on this study, the following documents are required:  
• Copy of signed/dated consent and HIPAA  Authorization 
• Source documentation to confirm  enrollment/eligibility  
DC11B Clinical Trial protocol, v 1.0  Page 55 of 61  
This document is the confidential property of the Cartesian Therapeutics.  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by Cartesian in writing.   
 Before leukapheresis, the following assessment s should be completed:  
• Vital signs (including pulse  oximetry)  
• Concomitant medications  
• CBC  
 
After leukapheresis, the following assessments should be completed:  
• Adverse event review and  evaluation  
• CBC  
 
 
3.3 Management of Possible  Toxicities  
All toxicities should be managed based on institutional guidelines and per apheresis physician’s 
discretion. Below are recommendations and deviations from them will not be considered as 
protocol deviation.  
 
3.3.1 Hypocalcemia  
Hypocalcemia is a decrease in calciu m levels.  Hypocalcemia is a response to citrate  toxicity,  which 
can result with large volume leukapheresis. Symptoms of hypocalcemia include numbness and tingling, especially  in the hands, feet, and around the mouth. Hypocalcemia can also cause painful 
muscle spasms that can be alleviated with calcium -rich foods and supplements. If symptoms 
persist during the procedure, the following protocols are advised: slowing the procedure, 
decreasing the amount of anticoagulation, and administering oral or intravenous calcium 
supplementation. 
 
3.3.2 Vasovagal Response  
Few subjects experience episodes of vasovagal responses such as lightheadedness or fainting. 
These occurrences are induced by extracorporeal blood flow and discomfort and/or fear of 
venipunctures. Major vasovagal episodes have been reported from patients r eceiving therapeutic 
leukapheresis in research for treatment of polymyositis and dermatomyositis, diseases of the muscle tissue.  
 
3.3.3 Blood Loss  
Varying, minor degrees of RBC or platelet loss have been reported. Devices separate and return 
blood according to different manufacturer settings that may have an influence on accounted 
hemoglobin or hematocrit levels. Significant blood loss, however, has not been reported. Patients 
with a history of anemia or thrombocytopenia should proceed leukapheresis treatments wi th 
caution. 
 
3.3.4 Discomfort at Venipuncture Site 
Discomfort, bruising, bleeding, or swelling at the venipuncture site may occur. These minor 
interactions may occur with any venipuncture procedure and is usually dependent on venous  
DC11B Clinical Trial protocol, v 1.0  Page 56 of 61

Do not disclose or use except as authorized by Cartesian in writing.   
 structural  integrity.  Routine procedures are in place at each facility  to help minimize  the occurrence 
of these discomforts and, in some cases, an alternate venipuncture site may be  utilized.  
 
3.3.5 Infection  
Infection, although rare, can occur at the venipuncture site due to cannula or catheter placement. 
Infection is minimized with proper sterilization standards and has been significantly reduced with 
disposable collection and storage  equipment. 
 
4 Safety,  Adver  se Events,  Pr otocol  Deviation  and Stopping 
Rules  
4.1 Definitions  
4.1.1 Adverse Events  (AE)  
An adverse event  (AE)  is defined  as any reaction,  side effect,  or untoward event  that occurs  during 
the clinical trial associated with the use of a test article  in humans, whether or not the event is 
considered  related  to the treatment  or clinically  significant.  For this study, AEs will include events 
reported  by the patient,  as well as clinically  significant abnormal findings on physical examination 
or laboratory  evaluation. A new illness,  symptom, sign or worsening of a pre- existing  condition or 
abnormality is considered an AE. An abnormal laboratory value will be considered an AE if the laboratory abnormality is characterized by any of t he following: 
• Results in discontinuation from the  study 
• Is associated with clinical signs or  symptoms 
• Requires treatment or any other therapeutic intervention 
• Is associated with death or another serious adverse event, including  hospitalization.  
• Is judged by the Investigator to be of significant clinical  impact  
 
All AEs, including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory evaluations, regardless of severity, will be followed until satisfactory resolution.  
 
4.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction  
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the test article  caused  the adverse event.  For the purposes of IND safety  reporting, “reasonable 
possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the test article and 
the adverse event.  A suspected  adverse reaction  implies  less certainty  about causality  than adverse 
reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a test  article.  
 
4.1.3 Serious Unexpected Adverse Reaction  (SUSAR)  
An adverse event  or suspected  adverse reaction  is considered  "unexpected"  if it is not listed  in the 
investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an 
investi gator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information 
described  in the general  investigational plan or elsewhere in the current  application. "Unexpected"  
DC11B Clinical Trial protocol, v 1.0  Page 57 of 61  
This document is the confidential property of the Cartesian Therapeutics.  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by Cartesian in writing.   
 also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator 
brochure as occurring with a class of the test article or as anticipated from the pharmacological 
properties of the drug but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the test article under 
investigatio n. 
 
4.1.4 Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following:  
 
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a SAE experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or s urgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this  definition. 
 
 
4.1.5 Protocol Deviation 
A one -time, unintentional action or process that departs from the IRB -approved study protocol, 
involving one incident and identified  retrospectively,  after the event  occurred.  Any leukapheresis - 
related failure or deviation will be recorded, even if it does not constitute a per -protocol AE. 
 
4.2 Recording of Adverse  Events  
4.2.1 Adverse Event Recording  Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as the period from the signing of consent to the leukapheresis completion. Serious Adverse Event reporting 
period starts with leukapheresis and ends 72 hours after the procedure.  
 
All unresolved adverse events  should be followed by the investigator until the events  are resolved, 
the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event  is otherwise explained. At the last scheduled 
visit, the investigator should instruct each subject to report any suspected adverse event(s) that 
might reasonably be related to participation in this study. The investigator should notify the 
Sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or 
terminated study participation if the event may reasonably be related to this study. The Sponsor 
should also be notified  if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer  or of 
a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in this study.  
 
4.2.2 Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization or  Surgery  
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be 
documented and reported as a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise as 
below. Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the  
DC11B Clinical Trial protocol, v 1.0  Page 58 of 61  
This document is the confidential property of the Cartesian Therapeutics.  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by Cartesian in writing.   
 condition meets  the criteria  for an adverse event.  Neither  the condition, hospitalization,  prolonged 
hospitalization, nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in the following  circumstances:  
 
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical procedures for 
a preexisting condition. Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if 
the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was  uneventful. 
• Hospit alization or prolonged hospitalization for therapy of the target disease of the study, 
unless there is clinical worsening or an increase in frequency of hospital admissions as 
judged by the clinical  investigator. 
 
 
4.2.3 Pregnancies  
To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy in a patient on study treatment must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy must be followed up to 
determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the 
presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn 
complications. Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Study Pregnancy Form and reported 
by the investigator to the Sponsor. Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded  on the same  form  and 
must include an assessment of the possible relationship to the study treatment of any pregnancy outcome. Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported on the SAE Report Form. 
Pregnancy outcomes must be collected for the female partners of any males who took study 
treatment  in this study. Consent to report information  regarding these  pregnancy outcomes should 
be obtained from the  mother. 
 
4.2.4 Recording of Adverse Events  
Information on all adverse events should be recorded immediately in the source document, and in 
the appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF). All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures  results  should be recorded  in the source document, 
though should be grouped under one diagnosis. To the extent possible, adverse events should be recorded as a diagnosis and symptoms used to make the diagnosis recorded within the diagnosis 
event. Do not list symptoms if a diagnosis can be  assigne d. 
 
Adverse events (including lab abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a 
diagnosis whenever  possible, rather  than individual underlying signs and symptoms. When  a clear 
diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate Adverse Event. The clinical  course of each event  should be followed until resolution, stabilization,  or until 
it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause. As detailed as possible, each adverse ev ent should be evaluated to determine:  
 
• The severity grade (CTCAE Version 5.0 Grade  1-5) 
• Its duration (start and end dates)  
• Its relationship to the leukapheresis procedure Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to procedure - No (unrelated)  or Yes. If yes - is the event definitely, probably, possibly 
or unlikely  related  
DC11B Clinical Trial protocol, v 1.0  Page 59 of 61  
This document is the confidential property of the Cartesian Therapeutics.  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by Cartesian in writing.   
 • Action taken with respect to study or investigational treatment (none, dose adjusted, 
temporarily interrupted, permanently discontinued, unknown, not  applicable)  
• Whether medication or therapy taken (i.e., no concomitant medication/non- drug therapy, 
concomitant medication/non-drug therapy) 
• Whether it is serious, as defined in Section  5.1. 
 
All adverse events should be treated appropriately. If a concomitant medication or non-drug 
therapy  is given, this action  should be recorded  on the Adverse Event CRF.  Adverse events  should 
be entered into the eCRF system within 10 working days from the knowledge of the event took 
place. Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is 
judged to be permanent, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if 
necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study treatment, the 
interventions required to treat it, and the  outcome. 
 
Progression of malignancy (including fatal outcomes), documented appropriately in the medical records,  should not be reported  as a serious adverse event.  Adverse events  that occur  concurrently 
with the progression of malignancy but that are not related to disease progression (i.e., deep vein thrombosis) will be reported as an adverse event as described above. 
 
4.2.5 SAE and SUSAR  Reporting  
To ensure patient safety, every SAE and SUSAR, regardless of suspected causality, occurring 
during the adverse event reporting period must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
learning of its occurrence. Recurrent episodes, complications, or progression of the initial SAE 
must be reported as fol low-up information is received. An SAE occurring at a different time 
interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one should be reported separately as a new event.  
 
4.2.5.1  Study Sponsor Notification by the  Investigator 
Any SUSAR and SAE as defined in Section 4.1 must be reported to the Sponsor by email or fax 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. To the extent possible, adverse events should be 
recorded as a diagnosis. Do not list symptoms if a diagnosis can be assigned. At the time of the 
initial notification, a serious adverse event (SAE) report form should be filled. Following 
parameters will be asked in the form:  
 
• Subject  information  
• A description of the event (if there is a diagnosis, it should be  included) 
• Date of onset 
• Current status  
• Whether study treatment was  discontinued 
• The reason why the event is classified as  serious 
• Investigator assessment of the association between the event and  procedure 
• Concomitant medications when the event  happened 
• Narrative summary  of the  event  
DC11B Clinical Trial protocol, v 1.0  Page 60 of 61  
This document is the confidential property of the Cartesian Therapeutics.  
Do not disclose or use except as authorized by Cartesian in writing.   
 Follow-up information  on this event  should be reported  when  received.  The follow-up information 
should describe 1) whether  the event  has resolved  or continues, 2) if and how it was treated,  and 
3) whether the patient continued or withdrew from study participation.  
 
4.2.5.2  IRB Notification by the  Investigator 
Following events should be reported to IRB:  
 
• Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in terms 
of severity or frequency. For  example:  
• Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more frequent than 
initially  expected.  
• Breach of  confidentiality.  
• Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate 
hazard to a research  participant.  
• Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks, or the complaint 
cannot be resolved by the research  team.  
• Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the IRB approved 
protocol) that in the opinion of the investigator placed one or more participants at increased risk or affects the rights or welfare  of subjects.  
 
Deaths that occur during the study should be reported within the IRB -specified time frame. 
For reportable deaths, the initial submission to the IRB may be made by contacting the IRB 
Director  or Associate  Director.  The AE/Unanticipated  Problem Form is required  as a follow up to 
the initial  submission. 
 
5. Ethical Consider  ations  
5.1 General  Issues 
This study is to be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice 
(FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures. 
 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted i ndependent 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) for formal approval of the study conduct. The decision of the IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator and a copy of 
this decision  will be provided to the sponsor before  commencement  of this study. The investigator 
should provide a list of IRB members and their affiliations to the  Sponsor. 
 
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this 
study. The consent form will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by the IRB 
for the study. The formal consent of a subject, using the IRB -approved consent form, must be 
obtained  before that subject  is submitted  to any study procedure. This consent form  must  be signed 
DC11B Clinical Trial protocol, v 1.0  Page 61 of 61

Do not disclose or use except as authorized by Cartesian in writing.   
 by the subject or legally acceptable surrogate, and the investigator -designated research 
professional obtaining the consent.  
 
5.2 Evaluation of Benefits and Risks  
Cells  collected  from  subjects  enrolled  into this protocol will be used to manufacture  Descartes -11. 
There is no expected direct benefit of the procedure. These subjects will be identified by the 
Principal Investigator of the Sponsor’s clinical trial at a site that has an open treatment protocol 
involving Descartes -11. Subjects  identified  for the Descartes -11 clinical  trial protocols have either 
symptomatic disease that is refractory to standard of care or they are intolerant to approved regimens for their disease and therefore in need of additional investigational  treatment.  
 
The risks associated  with leukapheresis  are associated  with the decrease in WBC count, interaction 
with anticoagulation solutions, and the actual  venipuncture site for withdrawal  and return  of blood, 
all of which can be identified and treated easily at certified apheresis  centers.  
 
5.3 Confidentiality  
The investigator must ensure anonymity of the patients; patients must not be identified by names 
in any documents submitted  to the sponsor. Signed inf ormed  consent forms  and patient  enrollment 
log must be kept strictly confidential to enable patient identification at the site. Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the Health 
Insurance Por tability  and Accountability  Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed 
subject authorization informing the subject of the  following: 
 
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this  study 
• Who will have access to that information and  why 
• Who will use or disclose that  information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their  PHI. 
 
If a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by regulation, retains the ability  to use all information  collected  prior  to the revocation  of subject  authorization. For subjects 
that have revoked authorization to collect  or use PHI,  attempts  should be made to obtain permission 
to collect at least vital status (i.e., that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study 
period.

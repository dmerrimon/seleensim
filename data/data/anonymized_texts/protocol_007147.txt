 Abstract 
 
Chronic refractory cough i n adults is  defined as a cough lasting more than 8 weeks that does 
not resolve with treatment for asthma/eosinophilic airway disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or rhinosinusitis/post-nasal drip; and is not caused by smoking, ACE  inhibitors, 
or parenchymal lung disease.  It is one of the most common conditions leading to specialty 
referral , accounting for about 20% of new pulmonary consultations.  Chronic refractory cough 
can lead to severe impairment of quality of life and social isolation as well as sleep deprivation and chronic fatigue.  The few available treatments have limited benefit and substantial side effects or abuse potential.  While there are validated tools to measure the health-impact of chronic cough which can provide feasible clinical trial  outcome measures, there have been no 
academic multi -center trials of chronic cough, and guidelines for treatment continue to rely 
largely on opinion rather than evidence. The Pilot of Zinc Acetate to Improve Chronic Cough (ZICO ) is a pilot study for a larger randomized clinical trial to establish the safety  and tolerability  
of zinc  acetate to treat cough in this population. The pilot trial will enroll 3 6 participants , 18 in 
each group, at 3 clinical centers. Participants will be 18 years or older, with chr onic cough 
lasting at least 3 months, which has been unresponsive to treatments for  asthma, GERD  or 
other upper airway disease.  Individuals that are current smokers, use an  ACE inhibitor, 
currently take zinc supplements (or multivitamins with zinc), or whose medical history includes primary parenchymal lung disease, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, pancreatitis, or another medical condition that could interfere with the study  or are pregnant or 
breast-feeding will be excluded.  Participants will be randomized to receive 6 weeks of treatment with either zinc acetate or placebo.  Follow-up assessments will occur at 1, 3, 6 and 8 weeks 
after randomization; the final assessment, after a two week washout, will help establish the 
duration of treatment effect. The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the feasibility of a full 
scale trial including estimating the statistical properties of the Cough Specific Quality of Life 
Questionnaire (CQLQ)  and other measures of cough severity and overall health.

 treat, the impact of the condition is often underestimated and patients are told that they need to 
accept their condition.  
 
Despite advances  in our understanding of the neurobiology  of cough,  there has  been a paucity  of 
rigorous  clinical  research on this  condition.   For example,  ClinicalTrials.gov  lists only 3 clinical  
trials  for chronic  refractory  cough,  none sponsored by NIH.  This lack of evidence is  particularly  
notable in  that the evidence- based guidelines for chronic  cough treatment  must  rely more on 
expert  opinion than rigorous  evidence,  leading to an “urgent”  call for multicenter  trials  of potential 
cough therapies.1, 14  
 
Usual  OTC treatments  with expectorants  and antihistamines  are not  beneficial vs. placebo,  
although widely  used at a cost of $5 Billion / year.15 Treatments  such as  morphine,  amitriptyline,  
gabapentin,  and P2X3 receptor  blockers  have been effective in well-designed single- site trials,  but 
the treatment  effects  are moderate and adverse effects  are common.16, 17, 18, 19, 20 In a 2013 meta -
analysis,  Yancey  et al., found 49 comparative studies of antitussive treatments,  13 of which  were 
considered good quality.   They  concluded that  the only  proven effective treatments  were  opioid 
narcotics  and dextromethorphan and raised concerns  about  adverse effects  and abuse potential, 
making them  unsuited for chronic  use.15  
 
The lack  of evidence regarding effective treatments  for chronic  cough is supported by a survey of 
opinion leaders  in which  82% agreed  with the statement:   “There are no currently  effective 
treatments  for cough hypersensitivity  syndrome.”  21  Despite its high morbidity and prevalence, no 
approved treatments are available for chronic refractory cough.  Indeed, the FDA has not 
approved a new treatment for cough since 1958 (benzonatate, Tesalon®).   
 
This trial takes a novel approach to chronic refractory cough that specifically targets the recently 
discovered major mechano-receptor and chemo-receptor for cough supported by strong pre-
clinical a nd highly supportive human data.  
 
Role of Na-K ATP-ase 
Considerable progress has been made by the Canning laboratory in defining the vagal afferent  
pathways  regulating cough and this  has facilitated the identification and evaluation of novel  
therapeutic  strategies  for cough suppression.9, 22, 23, 24 At least  2 vagal afferent nerve  subtypes  
essential  to cough regulation have been identified (figure 2).25, 26 Notably,  the cough receptors  
express  unique isozymes of Na+-K+ ATPase.27 These sodium  pump  isozymes  play an essential  
role in regulating cough receptor  excitability.   Cardiac  glycosides  (digoxin and ouabain)  and other  
drugs  known to interact  with neuronal sodium  pumps  dose-dependently suppress  cough in guinea 
pigs and in patients.26, 27, 28, 29  This work strongly  suggests  that neuronal  sodium  pump inhibition  
may be an effective antitussive strategy,  prompting clinical assessments by our consultants  
Jaclyn Smith and colleagues  to evaluate the actions  of digoxin in chronic  cough patients  and a 
study  by Lorcan McGarvey  and colleagues  to measure cough reflex  sensitivity  in a group of 
patients  with loss of function mutations  in their neuronal sodium  pumps .28   
 
We found no evidence for neuronal isoform  expression in structural  cells of the human airways  
based on exhaustive microarray analysis  of >40K  genetic  loci in human bronchi (n=5 lung 
donors),  suggesting that  neuronal selective inhibitors of this isoenzyme will have limited off target 
effects  in the lung.  Unfortunately,  both digoxin and ouabain are relatively  nonselective inhibitors  
of sodium  pump  function,  and have narrow  therapeutic  windows,  thus limiting their utility  as 
antitussives.   Thus, other  strategies  for inhibition of  this isoenzyme are necessary.   Zinc is a 
strong candidate for this  role.

In humans,  zinc lozenges  have been effective in reducing the duration of viral upper  respiratory  
infections  (URI).  The theoretical,  though unproven,  mechanism  has been to block  adhesion of  
virus  to epithelial cells via ICAM1.37  Three controlled clinical trials  of zinc acetate or  zinc 
gluconate have demonstrated symptom  reduction URI,  particularly  the duration of  acute cough.38, 
39, 40 A meta -analysis  showed a benefit with zinc therapy  for URI.  The summary  statistics  
indicated that  acute cough duration was reduced with zinc lozenges  at a dose greater  than 75 
mg/day.41, 42 Thus, there is sufficient  evidence to support  the notion that  adequate doses  of zinc 
can benefit humans  who suffer  from chronic  cough.  
 
Zinc is a widely available molecule with a long safety history as a nutritional supplement, 
treatment for colds, and for therapy of Wilson’s disease that will be immediately available for 
patients should it be shown to be effective.  Zinc may be administered long-term if necessary, 
unlike narcotic antitussives. We are proposing to use the FDA -approved formulation of zinc 
acetate (Galzin®) in the approved adult dose of 150mg/day for long-term use in Wilson’s disease.   
 
Previous  studies  of antitussives  that have  shown  an effect have  had treatment periods  of 2 
weeks  to 12 weeks, with a treatment effect apparent at 2-4 weeks. The treatment  duration of 6 
weeks  was selected as a reasonable period to determine whether there is  a treatment effect and 
to assess for tolerability,  adherence, steady -state  serum  zinc levels, potential  adverse effects, 
and persistence of treatment  effects.  Longer treatment  periods  would not substantially  augment 
the goals  of this pilot/feasibility  study.

 2. Study  design 
 
Randomized, two parallel arm, placebo-controlled clinical trial (n = 36, 18/arm).  
The study aims are:  
• To establish if treatment with zinc acetate is well tolerated  
• To determine if the trial logistics are feasible  
• To assess statistical properties  of patient reported measures of cough  
 
2.1. Trial schema  
 
 
2.2. Eligibility criteria  
 
Participants  must affirm that they  have multiple daily episodes  of cough that have  persisted for 
more  than three months . Individuals with asthma/eosinophilic airway disease or 
gastroesophageal reflux may be eligible if treatment with  inhaled corticosteroids  and/or  
bronchodilators, or  H2 blockers and/or proton pump  inhibitors, respectively , did not resolve 
cough. In addition, individuals with upper airway cough and/or rhinosinusitis whose cough did not 
respond to nasal steroids, antihistamines and/or expectorants/decongestants  may be eligible to 
participate.  
Individuals on treatments for cough (e.g. inhaled corticosteroids, H2 blockers, nasal steroids)  
should remain on their background treatment during the trial.  
Individuals  cannot be current smokers  (not smoked for at least six months ), can not be using an 
ACE inhibitor, and cannot have  any parenchymal lung disease as all of these can cause cough.

2.6. Outcome measures 
 
2.6.1. Patient Reported Outcomes 
 
Cough specific Quality of Life (CQLQ) :  This is a 28 item self- completed questionnaire with six 
subscales with excellent psychometric properties (Cronbach alpha = 0.92, ICC = 0.89) that is 
responsive to treatment.13, 43 The estimates of the standard deviation are consistent (12-15) across 
studies.  A minimum clinically important difference of 5 has been proposed, which is  based upon a 
small single center study of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and has not been validated in a larger, multicenter cohort.
44  
 Leicester cough questionnaire (LCQ) :  The LCQ is a patient reported cough outcome measure 
which has been validated and will be used to assess convergent validity for the CQLQ.  The LCQ 
has similar properties as the CQLQ with 19 items and 3 domains, with a total possible score ranging from 3 to 21.
45, 46 The minimal important difference of the LCQ for patients with chronic 
cough is 1.3. 47 
 Cough visual analog scales, overall, daytime, nighttime, urge to cough (C-VAS): T he C -VAS is a 
patient reported cough outcome measure that provides a measure of the severity, intensity and noxious qualities of cough that are not as well represented on the health impact scales. Each 
element of the VAS has a possible score of 0 to 100.
16  
 
EuroQol EQ -5D- 5L: The EQ -5D-5L is an overall  measure of health related quality of life that that 
provides a measure of utility for calculation of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). The EQ -5D 
measures 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety/depression graded from level 1 (i.e., no problems) to level 5 (i.e., extreme problems). Use of the 5-levels (EQ -5D-5L) rather than the standard 3 level EQ-5D (EQ -5D-3L) decreases the 
ceiling effec t, improves  discriminative ability, and potentially has more power to detect differences 
between groups.
48 
 Cough-related Impact on Quality of Life Scale (Cough IQOL S):  This is a health related quality of 
life measure that includes the impact of cough adapted from Sandra Wilson’s Asthma Impact on 
Quality of Life Survey (AQOLIS ). 
 
Global assessment of change in cough (GACC):  Global rating of change scales are widely used to 
measure change in self- assessed patient condition and determine the MID for other health related 
quality of life questionnaires.
49, 50 The Global Assessment of Change in Cough (GACC) asks 
patients to assess changes in their quality of life related to their cough on a 7 point scale on four 
domains (activity limitation, symptoms, emotions, and overall quality of life). 
 
Cough Diary : The study will use the Cough Severity Diary to track cough symptoms. The diary is a 
simple, seven-item daily diary designed to assess patient reported outcomes regarding frequency 
and severity of cough.51) 
 
2.6.2. Pulmonary function 
Spirometry (pre- and post-bronchodilator ): Spirometry  is a common office test of lung function; 
both pre and post-bronchodilator tests will be performed. Post-bronchodilator spirometry will be performed after 2 inhalations of albuterol.  This will be done to exclude patients with significant 
 
ZICO Protocol Version 1.5  Analysis plan │ 17 
 
 Confidential, not for attribution or citation.   
 airflow obstruction or restriction that may indicate underlying parenchymal lung disease or COPD  
and to evaluate the association of lung function with cough. 
 
2.6.3. Other measures 
Demographic data collected includes age, gender, race, marital status and educational level . 
 Clinical data includes  height, weight, body mass index, smoking status  and history of smoking in 
pack years .  Adverse events, changes in symptoms, medication use and utilization of medical care 
with also be assessed.  
 
2.7. Specimen collection, sto rage and  shipping  
 Serum will be collected for measurement of serum creatinine and subsequent calculation of 
creatinine clearance to determine if the participant meets the eligibility criteria. 
 Biospecimens collected for measurement of serum zinc and copper  levels  will be processed at the 
clinical sites and sent to Q uest Diagnostic  laboratories, a CLIA approved central  laboratory, for 
zinc and copper assessment. Zinc assessment  will be measured to assess whether serum zinc 
levels  are associated with  cough and response to treatment, and whether  supplementation 
increases  serum zinc levels . Copper assessment will be performed to check for signs of potential 
copper deficiency. Participants should fast for at least 4 hours prior to collection of blood for zinc and copper analysis. Specimens for serum zinc and copper analysis must be processed within 2 
hours to ensure accurate  assessment of zinc and copper levels.  
 
Additional blood will be collected and stored for future use. T he ALA -ACRC maintains a 
biorepository of specimens from our studies to conduct ancillary studies of the relationship of 
biomarkers to airway and related diseases.  Permission to draw and store biospecimens for future 
ancillary studies and/or DNA testing is optional and is not a requirement for participation in this 
study. The results of future genetic testing will not be provided to study participants. Blo od 
specimens  for future use are stored at -70° or -80 ° C at the local site and shipped periodically in 
batches  on dry  ice for storage at the ACRC biospecimen repository  at Nemours  Children’s Center 
(NCC) . The DCC supplies  blood drawing tubes, bar -code labels, shipping labels,  containers, and 
transmittal slips.  All sites are required to be certified in biosafety  for handling biological 
specimens  in accordance with local hospital /  university  policy  and applicable law.   
 
 
 
3. Study treatment 
3.1. Description of study treatment 
Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a daily dose of 150 mg of z inc a cetate or 
matched placebo taken in three doses of 50 mg each or  placebo.  For this trial 50 mg zinc acetate 
capsules will be over-encapsulated and a matched placebo will be created. Zinc will be taken with 
the morning or evening meal. Participants will be instructed to titrate up the dose of study drug 
starting with  one capsule (50 mg) in the morning on day 1, increasing to two capsules (100 mg) on 
day 4, and reaching three capsules (150 mg) on day 8.  Participants will be instructed to take the 
medication with food.   If participants are not able to tolerate the full dose, they may split the dose 
 
ZICO Protocol Version 1.5  Analysis plan │ 18 
 
 Confidential, not for attribution or citation.   
 into two or three doses per day taken at meal -time  (e.g. two caps ules in AM and one capsule in 
PM, or one capsule with breakfast, lunch, and dinner ).  If a participant is not able to tolerate the full 
dose, then the dose should be titrated down to the highest tolerable dose, i.e., one or two 
capsules as tolerated.  
The s tudy will use the FDA- approved  formulation of oral zinc, Galzin®. FDA has approved 
Galzin® 150mg/day for long-term use in adults with Wilson’s disease. Zinc supplementation for food has been considered Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the FDA. NIH recommends 
up to 40 mg/day as a dietary supplement in adults and multivitamins used long-term for prevention 
of macular degeneration contain 80mg of elemental zinc.  OTC lozenges (Cold-eez ®) contain 13.3 mg of zinc as zinc gluconate and are taken in doses  of up to 80 mg/day for relief of URI 
symptoms.  Zinc gluconate is available as unregulated nutritional supplements in 100mg capsules.   
3.2. Randomization  
Participants will be randomized to zinc acetate or placebo at V2. Treatment assignment will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio with stratification by clinic with permuted block design will be 
used. Assignments will released from the DCC after evidence that an eligible participant has 
signed consent and completed all baseline evaluations. 
Zinc a cetate or placebo will be dispensed to the participant at the V2 visit. At randomization the 
participant will be assigned a unique bottle ID code and clinics will dispense that bottle to the 
participant. Each participant will receive a single bottle of 16 8 capsules for the 6 weeks of 
treatment. At the second to last study (V5)  visit, the bottle with the unused capsules will be returned . 
3.3. Side effects  
The most common adverse effects of zinc supplementation are dyspepsia, nausea, and a metallic taste. These side effects can be mitigated by downward  adjustment  of the dose, taking the drug 
with meals, and/or spreading the dose out over the day (i.e. taking 1 capsule in the morning and 2 capsules at night, or taking 1 capsule each at breakfast, lunch, and dinner).  
 Elevations  of liver and pancreatic  enzymes  have  been reported in patients  with Wilson’s  disease,  
treated with zinc acetate, but this has not been reported in other  populations and the relationship 
with zinc supplementation is unclear.  Participants with a history of pancreatitis will be excluded 
from the study. Study participants experiencing abdominal pain should be evaluated for possible 
pancreatitis.  With z inc gluconate nasal  spray  some  patients  have noted loss of smell,  but this has 
not been reported with oral zinc. 
 Zinc is listed as  a class A drug for pregnancy  indicating that  it does  not have substantial  
teratogenic  potential.  We are excluding pregnant and lactating women from this  trial because 
pregnancy  may have  either beneficial or deleterious  effects  on chronic  cough and zinc is 
transmitted in breast milk that may  alter infant feeding behavior . Women of child bearing potential 
must be willing to use appropriate methods of pregnancy prevention during the duration of the 
study. Women of childbearing potential includes all female participants except those who are 
surgically sterile (both ovaries and/or uterus removed), postmenopausal (no menstrual period for 
longer than 12 consecutive months), or incapable of pregnancy.  
 
The FDA-approved prescribing information  for zinc acetate  states  the following regarding over -
dosage: 
 
“One  fatality  associated with over-dosage of zinc sulfate has 
 
ZICO Protocol Version 1.5  Analysis plan │ 19 
 
 Confidential, not for attribution or citation.   
 been reported.  The death of this adult  woman followed the  
accidental ingestion of approximately  28 g of zinc sulfate.  
[Equivalent  to 560 capsules  of zinc acetate  or 3 bottles  of 
dispensed study  drug] .  Death occurred on the fifth day after 
ingestion and was attributed  to renal  failure.  Hemorrhagic  
pancreatitis  and hyperglycemic  coma resulted from the overdose.  
The amount  ingested was  500 mg/Kg  of zinc sulfate, a         
value that is in the same  order of magnitude as that found to be 
lethal in animals.”  
 
Drug interaction information contained in UpToDate indicates  that absorption of the following 
medications might  be impaired by zinc: cephalosporin antibiotics, quinolone antibiotics, 
tetracycline antibiotics, bisphosphonates, dolutegravir, deferiprone, and eltrombopag. If a 
participant is prescribed one of these medications during the study, the participant will be 
instructed to take zinc/placebo at least 1 hour prior  to or 1 hour after taking that medication.   
 
In theory, prolonged consumption of zinc could lead to copper deficiency which is manifest as a 
reversible anemia and neutropenia as well as neuropathy.  Because copper is ubiquitous in the 
diet, and deficiency is rare in the absence of malabsorption syndromes or gastric bypass surgery, it is unlikely that the duration of treatment in this trial will lead to copper deficiency. 
However, in patients using long- term high- dose zinc, monitoring for hematologic abnormalities 
and peripheral neuropathy would be indicated.
52 We will measure serum copper levels prior to 
starting study drug and after completing study drug treatment to assess for potential signs of 
copper deficiency, as well as to assess the likelihood of side effects in more long- term use of 
zinc.  
 
3.4. Unmasking 
Unmasking of treatment assignment is rarely necessary.  If adverse events occur that may be 
related to the study treatment, then the study treatment is stopped and the patient continues 
follow -up.  Envelopes with treatment assignment are provided to the clinic in the case a treating 
physician feels it is important to know the treatment assignment.  In addition, the DCC provides a 
phone number where authorized personnel can receive unmasking information.    All participants 
are provided with a wallet card that provides information that they are participating in a clinical trial 
and gives the contact numbers of personnel at the clinic.  
 
4.  Analysis plan  
4.1. Sample size  
 
The primary goals of the pilot study are to establish the feasibility of performing a randomized trial 
and to obtain preliminary estimates of the relative efficacy of zinc versus placebo and the 
statistical properties of the patient reported outcome measures . A sample size of 36 (18/arm)  has 
80% power to detect a treatment effect of 0.56 standard deviations (SD)  or greater, where SD is 
for the difference from baseline to 6 weeks in CQLQ score, based upon a two-sample t-test and a 
one-sided type 1 error rate of 0.20.  We are conducting a contemporaneous cohort study to 
establish the minimal important difference ( MID) and SD for change in CQLQ scores in 100 
participants with chronic cough.  This analysis will not necessarily provide information whether the 
changes are clinically important, but will provide a framework for establishing changes that are 
outside of the range of variability of symptoms and would be noticeable by the patient. Thus, in 
 
ZICO Protocol Version 1.5  Analysis plan │ 20 
 
 Confidential, not for attribution or citation.   
 this context, the MID would be analogous to the “Just Noticeable Difference” (JND) used in 
psychophysics of perception.   
 
 
Primary  Analysis  
 The primary analysis will focus on the tolerability of zinc acetate versus placebo. These analysis will rely on qualitative assessments of adverse drug effects as well as unadjusted comparisons of 
the frequency of events and adherence by treatment assignment.  
 
The statist ical analysis  for efficacy will be an unadjusted comparison of  6-week  change in CQLQ 
between treatment  groups.   A linear  mixed effects  model will be used to model change in CQLQ  
over time. A saturated  means  model  with indicators for each time point,  treatment  and treatment  
by time interaction,  will be specified and a random  effect for individual will be used to account  for 
the repeated  measurements over time. The 6-week  treatment by  time interaction term  
represents  the difference in change in CQLQ  between the  treatment groups,  i.e. the primary  
outcome. If  the data are non- normal, then transformations and non- parametric  alternatives  (e.g. 
Wilcoxon Rank -Sum test comparing  the raw differences from baseline to 6-weeks  between 
treatment groups)  will be explored.  Using the methods described by Cocks and Torgerson, we 
will test whether or not the upper boundary of the 1-sided 80% confidence interval of the treatment effect excludes the MID.
53 For example, a total sample size of 36 would be sufficient to 
exclude a MID of 5 or higher for a 1-sided 80% confidence interval if the standard deviation for the change in CQLQ was 15. Sensitivity  analyses  using alternate mean and covariance 
structures  will also be performed.   Analyses  will be done based upon principles  of intention to 
treat, i.e. all data from all randomized participants  will be included in the analysis.  
 
Secondary  outcomes  
include,  but are not  limited to, LCQ, diary  data,  C-VAS, GACC, quality  of 
life measures, and safety  data.   Continuous  variables  will be analyzed similarly  to the primary  
outcome.   Event  outcomes will be analyzed in two ways:  negative binomial regression for rates  
and Kaplan -Meier  curves  and Cox proportional  hazards  models for time to first event.  
 
Assessment  of futility  for a definitive trial will not rest with any single measure but  will depend on 
a synthesis  of the overall study  feasibility  and treatment tolerability  as well as magnitude and 
consistency  of the observed treatment effect.  However, in line with formal  futility  designs  in 
neuroscience and oncology,  we will not likely  proceed with a definitive trial if the upper  boundary  
of the one- sided 80% confidence interval of the treatment  effect  excludes  the minimally  important  
difference for the CQLQ,  which  we will validate in the concurrent cohort study . 
 
Descriptive s tatistics will be computed for baseline clinical and demographic characteristics by 
treatment group. Results will be displayed as means with standard deviations, medians with 1st 
and 3rd quartiles, and proportions as appropriate.

5. Protection of human subjects 
 
5.1.  Risks to the p articipants 
 Study procedures  present minor risks : 
 Spirometry:  Participants will undergo spirometry at V1, V5 and V6. This procedure involves 
forceful respiratory maneuvers. Occasionally people develop light-headedness during the procedure or soreness of the chest for a few days afterward. In the Lung Health Study, in 
approximately 25,000 tests, one individual sustained a serious cervical injury from syncope 
during spirometry while standing. The risk of syncope in this study is minimized by having participants sit during the maneuvers. 
Questionnaires  and assessments : Participants will be asked to provide information about their 
psychological, physical, and medical functioning on questionnaires. While we will make every 
effort to protect privacy and keep data confidential, there is a risk that information can be 
disseminated in ways that can risk the privacy of a person. To minimize risk, we will use only study codes to identify data and study records, store study data and records in a secure place, and personal information such as names, addresses, and telephone numbers will  not be in the 
central database.  
 Chest x -ray: Participants without a chest x -ray or CT scan from within the past 2 years will have 
a chest x -ray taken to determine eligibility. Chest x -ray is a standard medical procedure for 
imaging of the lung. Risks to the volunteers are minimal. Participants undergoing chest x -ray for 
this study will be exposed to a small amount of radiation as part of the study. The effective dose equivalent for a chest x -ray is 7.2 millirem  (mrem), or 0.072 millsiev erts (mSv) . This compares to 
the average background radiation dose a U.S. resident receives yearly from natural sources of 310 mrem, or 3.1 mSv.  
We are requiring that all x -rays taken as part of the study be interpreted by a certified radiologist 
on site. The scans will be inspected for image quality and inclusion of all parts of the chest. It may occur that other findings are found on these images that may represent clinically  significant 
findings (e.g. lung nodules). If any incidental findings are discovered during the study, the 
clinical site study physician will be notified, the information will be given to the participant and, 
with their permission, the information will also be transmitted to the participant’s usual caregiver 
for appropriate medical care or follow-up. 
 Specimens  will be obtained for serum creatinine, serum zinc and copper levels , and future 
research.  Risks of blood draw are minimized by limiting the amount drawn to no more than 
about 70 mL over the course of the study. Patients have venipuncture in the seated or lying 
position to minimize syncopal events and pressure is applied after the procedure.  
The risks of genome and other ancillary analys es of specimens are primarily related to the 
possibility that an outside agency not approved by the participant might obtain and use the 
information in such a way that it would harm the participant. To minimize this risk, specimens  
will be identified only by a numeric identifier. The results will not be a part of a participant’s 
general medical record. Genetic information or other information obtained from participants will not be supplied to any outside agency except as authorized by the consent statement. Genetic and biomarker data will not be linked to the participants ’ personal identifiers and will be shared 
ZICO Protocol Version 1. 5  Protection of human subjects  │ 22 
 
 
 Confidential, not for attribution or citation.   
 with other investigators in the network through study ID codes. R esults may be presented in 
publications and meetings but individual names will not be identified.  
 
5.2. Data Confidentiality  
Data which includes  identifiable protected health information (PHI) are collected at each of the 
clinical sites.  PHI is stored at each of the clinical sites in accordance with HIPAA regulations  and 
local university  and hospital policies.  This includes  the storage of PHI in locked cabinets  or rooms,  
limited  access to  secure data areas  by certified participating study  personnel, password  
protection for electronic  medical records, and  explanation of HIPAA regulations  on the study  
consent form. Data such  as lung function or laboratory  tests  that are collected as  part of this study  
may be transmitted to the participants ’ treating  physicians  with the consent of the participant.  
Participants  are informed in the consent that PHI may  also be disclosed  for auditing purposes  by 
the FDA or other regulatory  bodies  and is subject to subpoena.  
Date of birth and gender of participants must be shared with the central laboratory  to determine 
zinc and copper reference values. The resulting data is shared only between the originating site, 
central laboratory , and DCC through a HIPAA -compliant results application run by the central 
laboratory . Personal identifiers are not otherwise transmitted to the DCC or central laboratory . 
All data are identified by study  ID, and other identifying information is  not entered into the 
central study  database.  Source records  that are transmitted to the DCC  for data quality  audits  
have  identifying information redacted, however  on-site inspections  may involve  access  by DCC 
personnel  to medical records.  
 
5.3. Recruitment and consent procedures 
Participants will be recruited by each participating clinic using their own IRB approved methods. 
These methods may include local American Lung Association campaigns, solicitation in 
physician offices, clinics, workplaces , and public media advertisements. All public 
advertisements are subject to approval by the local Institutional Review Board ( IRB) and must 
indicate that it is a research study. The DCC will help coordinate recruitment among clinics and promote sharing of effective recruitment strategies within the network.  
The consent form will be subject to approval by the clinical center IRB. A copy of the consent 
form will be given to each participant, and the signed original will be kept in the participant’s research chart.

 6. Data and safety monitoring plan 
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is appointed and chartered by the American Lung 
Association to monitor ALA-ACRC trials. The DSMB will serves in a consultative capacity to 
ALA and will make recommendations regarding the initiation and continuation of ACRC studies . 
The NIH program officer is invited to attend review meetings , and recommendations and 
minutes will be forwarded to the NIH program officer and to all IRBs involved in the oversight of the study. The primary responsibility of the DSMB is to protect participants but they ma y also 
make  recommendations regarding the scientific conduct of the study .
14 The DSMB w ill meet to 
review the protocol and consent prior to study initiation and then periodically throughout the study to review the progress of the trial.  Typically  the meetings take place twice a year. The 
investigators will present the DSMB with study performance data including screening and enrollment data, and measures of data quality and timeliness.  Safety data will include reporting of adverse events, protocol  deviations, and unexpected or unusual events that may affect the 
safety or scientific validity of the study.  Because of the nature of this study, we are not proposing interim efficacy analyses or stopping guidelines. At the end of each DSMB meeting, 
the board will vote whether to continue the study as planned or whether to recommend changes to the study.  Dr. Wise serves as the medical monitor for the research group and reviews all serious adverse event or unusual event reports to determine whether any immediate local or study -wide actions 
are indicated.  Because Dr. Wise reviews patient events, he will remain masked to the coded 
treatment assignments.  Interim serious adverse events or significant protocol deviations are transmitted to the DSMB as they occur with concurrent notification of the clinical site IRBs and, if appropriate to the FDA. The DSMB is given the option of having an interim meeting to review the event.  
The DSMB reports will be masked with respect to treatment assignments groups by using codes 
to identify the zinc acetate and placebo groups.  The DSMB may elect to maintain the masking 
or they can be unmasked at any time. They may also decide to be unmasked for an individual 
case if there is a serious adverse event that may be related to a specific treatment.

1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEMA       
This phase II study of the anti-G D2 murine IgG3 monoclonal antibody 3F8 combined with 
granulocyte- macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM- CSF) will assess relapse-free 
survival in patients who are post- stem-cell transplantation and in first complete/very good 
partial remission (CR/VGPR) but are at very high risk of relapse of neuroblastoma. The 
high-dose 3F8 usage is four fold greater than the standard 3F8 dosage used in prior phase 
II studies.  13- cis-Retinoic Acid will be used in this protocol after patients are evaluated 
for response to 3F8/GM- CSF. We will apply real -time quantitative RT -PCR 
methodology targeting G D2 synthase mRNA for monitoring response in bone marrow; we 
will test the hypothesis that early bone marrow response has prognostic importance.   
 
2.0 OBJECTIVES AND SCIENTIFIC AIMS  
Primary Objectives  
• Assess the impact of high-dose 3F8/GM- CSF on relapse-free survival in patients 
who are post- stem-cell transplantation and in first complete or very good partial 
remission , but at high risk of relapse. 
 Secondary Objective s 
• Apply real-time quantitative RT -PCR to test the hypothesis that the minimal 
residual disease content of bone marrow after the first treatments with 3F8/GM -
CSF has significant prognostic impact on relapse- free survival . 
• Monitor safety of the high-dose antibody treatment, to assure no side- effects or 
noxious sequelae develop or emerge that were not seen in the prior phase I study. 
 
3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
3.1 Disease background: Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial 
solid tumor of childhood; 50-60% of patients present with an unresectable primary tumor 
and metastases in bone marrow (BM).1  Intensive induction chemotherapy and aggressive 
surgery have improved remission rates in young patients2-4; results have been less 
impressive in adolescents and adults in whom NB is especially chemoresistant.5,6
Realization o f an effective strategy for eradicating minimal residual disease (MRD) has 
remained a formidable challenge.  Post -surgical use of local radiotherapy helps control 
MRD in the primary site.7 Myeloablative therapy (with stem-cell support) has been the 
most common approach for eradicating MRD in distant sites.  The long- term relapse -free 
survival rate in a recent national study was only ~20%, although the vitamin A derivative 13-cis-retinoic acid helped to improve overall survival.
8These results, plus the 
potentially severe toxicities of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, are compelling reasons

for pursuing novel therapeutic approaches, including immunotherapy mediated by anti-
GD2 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs)9-22 which interact with granulocytes.23 
 
3.2 Rationale for 3F8:  3F8 is a murine IgG3 MoAb that is well suited for targeted 
immunotherapy.  The reasons are several.  First, the intensive chemotherapy required to produce in NB patients the minimal disease state optimal for immunotherapy results in 
 prolonged lymphopenia. This setting is unfavorable for active immunotherapy but allows  passive immunotherapy since the patient is unable to reject allogeneic, xenogeneic, or 
 genetically -engineered MoAbs.  Second, 3F8 recognizes the ganglioside G
D2.24  This 
 target antigen is highly expressed on NB (but has restricted distribution in normal human 
 tissues), is not modulated from the cell surface when bound by MoAbs, and is genetically  stable (unlike tumor-associated antigens such as immunoglobulin idiotypes on lymphoma  cells).
25-27  Third, scintigraphy using 131I-3F8 confirms that 3F8 localizes selectively to 
 G D2(+) tumor deposits in patients.28  The excellent targeting potential of 3F8 was 
 evidenced by its high tumor to non-tumor ratio, the high percent injecte d dose per gram 
 uptake, and the limited, if any, nonspecific liver and spleen uptake.28,29  Fourth, 3F8 
mediates destruction in vitro, in a dose-dependent manner, of G D2(+) human tumor cells 
 by human complement30 and by human lymphocytes, cultured monocytes, and 
 neutrophils.31-33  Finally, the capacity of 3F8 to activate complement (C’) on NB cells 
(which lack decay accelerating factor34) raises the possibility of C’ -mediated lysis in 
 patients and the release of C’ fragments that may elicit an inflammatory influx of 
 granulocytes capable of lysing 3F8-labeled tumor cells.  Furthermore, the deposition of  C’ fragments C3b and iC3b on NB cells may enhance ADCC because the receptor for  iC3b – variously called Mac-1, CR3, CD11b/CD18, or ά
Mβ2-integrin – is a key element 
 in anti -GD2 MoAb-mediated tumor- cell kill by neutrophils,35,36 which are the most 
 abundant circulating class of leukocyte. 
3.3 Rationale for GM- CSF:  GM-CSF can amplify 3F8 anti- NB activity in patients 
via effects on granulocytes and macrophages.  Reasons for combining GM-CSF with 3F8 include the following.  First, granulocyte production is only transiently suppressed by chemotherapy, and GM-CSF increases neutrophil and eosinophil production and is well 
 tolerated compared to other cytokines such as interleukin-2.
37  Second, granulocytes from 
 patients receiving chemotherapy and normal volunteers mount ADCC against NB cells 
 via non-oxidative mechanisms, and GM- CSF enhances the ADCC.36,38-42 Third, 
 eosinophilic infiltration of some cancers has favorable prognostic significance, and  eosinophils exhibit potent antitumor activity in animal models.
43,44  Fourth, activated 
 monocytes-macrophages efficiently phagocytose NB cells, and exposure in vitro or in 
vivo to GM-CSF primes monocytes- macrophages for greater antineoplastic 
cytotoxicity.33,39,45-50  Fifth, GM -CSF enhances the proliferation, maturation, and function 
 of antigen -presenting cells, including antigen processing and presentation by 
 macrophages and dendritic cells37,51,52 - effects that might promote induction, or 
antitumor activity, of an idiotypic network.53-56  Finally, GM -CSF is not a growth factor 
 for NB cells in vitro.57

3.4 Rationale for quantitating BM disease by real- time RT-PCR:  Curative 
 strategies for stage 4 NB must encompass control of both the primary mass and distant 
 disease.  Dose- intensive chemotherapy has had a favorable impact on resectability of 
 primary tumors and surgical removal of all visible tumor, follow ed by local radiotherapy, 
 reduces the risk of relapse in the primary site to <10%.4,7  Dose-intensive chemotherapy 
 eliminates histologically evident BM involvement in 90% of high -risk cases.3  These 
encouraging results have shifted the focus of curative strategies to the problem of MRD – 
 which is readily assessed in BM. 
 
Adjuvant treatments, such as immunotherapy with MoAbs, may make gradual and not quantum changes in MRD, which by definition is beyond the sensitivity of conventional histologic
58 or radiologic techniques. The availability of more sensitive methods for 
quantitating occult tumor cells in sequential BM specimens can allow determination of the efficacy and optimal duration of adjuvant treatment.  T he absence of detectable tumor 
cells in BM c an serve as a surrogate end point for the adjuvant treatment strategy, while 
quantitative data on BM disease will help detect relapse earlier and indicate a need for a 
change in treatment.   
 
We
58-65a and others66-70 have reported a series of studies aimed at improving the utility of 
BM testing , focusing on immunologic al and molecular methods for identifying MRD .  
The limit of detection for immunocytology is 1/105 to 1/106 cells; RT-PCR has slightly 
superior sensitivity with a range of 1/105 to 1/107 cells.  The results suggest that G D2
synthase might serve as a sensitive marker of MRD in BM and that its level might reflect clinical disease status as well as correlate with histologic response to immunotherapy.   
Histologic examination of aspirates and biops ies from bilateral posterior iliac crests has 
been the standard method for detecting NB in BM.  We have routinely also obtained 
specimens from bilateral anterior iliac crests since sampling from multiple sites increases detection rates.
65a  Histologic studies alone, however, yield an underestimate of BM 
involvement, as shown by immunocytology with MoAbs.68.69  For >15 years, we have 
used anti- GD2 immunocytology to enumerate NB cells in BM of patients.92   Molecular 
markers have also been tested for detectin g NB.  Thus, the gene transcript for tyrosine 
hydroxylase, which is a key enzyme in the catecholamine biosynthesis pathway, is useful for identifying NB in BM but its expression is down- regulated in some cells.
64,67  We 
found cancer- testis antigen GAGE to be comparable in sensitivity to immunocytology in 
detecting NB in BM,59 and results with GAGE  proved to have prognostic significance.61  
Ease of use, superior sensitivity, and greater specificity prompted us to study the utility of real-time quantitative R T-PCR of GD2 synthase mRNA for the detection of rare NB cells 
in BM.  The marker GD2 synthase is particularly pertinent because NB cells express ganglioside GD2 at high density, with little heterogeneity within tumors or among patients, and this surface antigen has limited expression in normal human tissues.
25-27
The key enzyme required for GD2 synthesis is GD2 synthase (β1,4-N-

acetylgalactosamineyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.92).62  In a study of 155 BM samples (100 
patients), the transcript levels correlated well with the number of NB cells in BM as 
measured by immunocytology.63  Further, in a study of BM findings in 86 NB patients 
treated with 3F8 and GM -CSF, molecular responders had a significantly lower risk of 
disease progression.65  The data provide compelling support for the utility of this 
molecular approach for assessing MRD . 
3.5Clinical experience with 3F8/GM- CSF:   Prior clinical studies of 3F8/GM -CSF 
established 1) this combination’s excellent activity against refractory BM disease (IRB protocols 94-018 and 03-077); 2) the safety of markedly augmented 3F8 dosing (IRB protocol 05-015: “3F8 antibody dose escalation plus granulocyte-macrophage colony-
 stimulating factor in high -risk neuroblastoma: A phase I trial”)
71a compared to dosages 
derived from pilot studies in the 1980s, an important finding since in vitro studies show a 
 3F8 dose-dependent lysis of NB cells (see section 3.2); and 3) the superiority of  subcutaneous over intravenous (iv) use of GM-CSF, for both anti- NB effect and 
 treatment simplification (which helps patients and medical staff - and promotes wide 
 availability of this treatment)  
71-73   
 
The long-standing standard daily dosage of 3F8 has been 20 mg/m2.  In the IRB protocol 
05-015 dose escalation phase I study, 3F8 dosages up to 160 mg/m2 were possible 
without dose- limiting toxicity , as reported71a (That protocol also used a small dose of 
heat-modified 3F8 – 2 mg/m2, iv over ~5 minutes – administered just before the 
treatment dose, as a way to modify the major acute toxicity of pain.)  For the current 
protocol, we chose daily 3F8 dosage 80 mg/m2 because in the dose escalation phase I 
study, serum levels were not significantly different at a 3F8 daily dosage of > 80 mg/m2
(see Figure 1), and excellen t anti-NB activity was seen at 80 mg/m2.

3.6
HAMA response/idiotypic network:
   In a study of 34 patients with MRD 
treated with 3F8 alone, patients with a self -limited (transient) HAMA response had 
significantly better PFS than patients who had persistently high HAMA titers or no HAMA formation.
15 This association of a transient low level HAMA/anti-idiotype (Ab2) 
antibody response with better PFS was a seemingly paradoxic al finding since 
HAMA/Ab2 blocks 3F8 binding to tumor cells.  The unexpected observation regarding HAMA/Ab2 and survival led to the hypothesis of a host idiotypic network induced by 3F8 (Ab1) and responsible for long-term tumor control.  The idiotypic network was first postulated by Jerne
75 for immune regulation and later demonstrated in human disease 
models, including cancer patients.76-79 Anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab2) in the HAMA pool 
may mimic antigen G D2 and stimulate an Ab3 antibody response.  We previously reported 
the association of anti- anti-idiotype (Ab3) with prolonged survival among patients who 
underwent myeloablative therapy with autologous stem -cell rescue.53 Other investigators 
have postulated the development of an idiotypic network in patients treated with 17- 1A 
antibodies, where both Ab3 antibodies as well as anti-idiotypic and anti- anti-idiotypic T 
cells have been demonstrated.54,55
In our study of 34 patients, consistent with the emergence of an idiotypic network, Ab3 (anti-anti-idiotype) and Ab3' (anti -G
D2) response at 6- 14 months after treatment with 3F8 
alone correlated with improved PFS, and higher Ab3 titers showed a stronger correlation with improved outcome, while non-idiotype antibody responses (anti-mouse or anti-tumor nuclear antigen) had no apparent impact on outcome.
56  Since G D2 is an auto -
antigen, induced Ab3' response represented a breakdown in self- tolerance.  We 
hypothesized that significant rises in Ab3 or Ab3' would not be possible unless 
suppressor pathways were removed and naive T or B cells were allowed to repopulate.  Following intensive chemotherapy that eliminates a large part of the lymphoid system, exposure to tumor-selective Ab1s (3F8) might induce unique Ab2s that could bias the recovering repertoire towards the G
D2 antigen network.  The potential for biasing the 0102030405060

immune system towards specific antigens has been well documented in murine models80
and human disease states.81,82  If true, one would expect such an idiotypic network to be 
most successful following intensive immunosuppressive therapy, and not easily induced 
in immunocompetent patients.  In fact, we found that myeloablative therapy suppressed HAMA and Ab2 but was followed by the appearance of Ab3 which in turn correlated 
with prolonged survival.
53,56  The prerequisite of strongly immunosuppressive therapy 
may explain why in most clinical studies of MoAbs, such an idiotypic network is not commonly observed.  However, when found in patients with colorectal or ovarian carcinoma treated with specific MoAbs, the idiotypic network gave patients superior survival advantage.
54,55,76,77,83 -87 
 
 3.7 Isotretinoin (13 -cis-retinoic acid)  was shown in a randomized national study to 
significantly decrease the risk of early relapse in patients treated in complete remission and to significantly improve overall survival.
8 This agent subsequently became standard 
of care for NB patients in remission.  It will be used in this protocol after patients are 
evaluated for response to 3F8/GM- CSF – same dosage, same timing as in the predecessor 
3F8/GM-CSF (IRB 03-077) protocol. 
 
3.8Interpretations and implications:   Various strategies have undergone clinical 
testing to promote immune- mediated attack against cancer.  However, few clinical trials 
have used MoAb-targeted immunotherapy against solid tumors in children or adults,
especially with ADCC as the principal underlying immune cytotoxic mechanism.  Also, an antineoplastic role for granulocytes has received scant attention.
23  A treatment 
program combining 3F8 and GM-CSF thus represents a step towards filling a gap in the emerging field of immunotherapy.   
This phase II trial exploits recent findings that promise to optimize the anti -NB activity of 
3F8/GM- CSF – namely, high dosing of 3F8 and subcutaneous use of GM-CSF.  Further, 
RT-PCR analysis of response in BM, which has proved informative in past studies, will 
be applied to monitor anti- NB activity of the immunotherapy, with an emphasis on early 
recognition of treatment efficacy.  The studies focus on BM; findings may not reflect 
total body tumor burden.  Metastatic NB is, however, a systemic disease, and, as with leukemia,
88 BM status appears to approximate the overall disease state.  If the RT -PCR 
method proves to be sensitive, it will provide a useful tool for measuring NB- cell content 
in BM as a patient goes through treatment.  The ability to identify patients not likely to benefit from further use of a given adjuvant thera py will allow a more timely switch to a 
possibly better treatment.  We hypothesize that quantifying G
D2 synthase transcript levels 
will help stratify patients by tumor load, define tumor thresholds that correlate with favorable clinical outcome, and provide prognostic classification for patients receiving immunotherapy.  Risk-related molecular guidelines can be rapidly incorporated into future treatment programs.  Our RT-PCR method provides a quantitative measure, such that the percentage of 
patients who achieve CR in BM, and the degree of response with 3F8/GM-CSF, can be

calculated and compared to other adjuvant treatments.  With NB, where randomized trials 
are difficult to carry out because of the small number of affected patients, such quantitative analys es acquire even greater utility for rapidly identifying both the best 
agent and its optimal use in a curative treatment program.   
The findings regarding RT-PCR utility in the adjuvant setting, granulocyte activation, 
and idiotypic network will have gener al implications for MoAb -based therapeutic 
strategies against solid tumors in humans.    The ease of administration of the treatments (a subcutaneous injection of GM- CSF, 
which is given at home, and a 30-minute iv infusion of 3F8 in the outpatient clinic), plus their transient acute side -effects, are compatible with usage of this regimen beyond our 
hospital – a strong positive factor in furthering product development, which in fact is underway in a multi-institutional study of 3F8/GM-CSF using the previous 3F8 dosage. 
 
4.0 OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN/INTERVENTION 
4.1 Design 
This phase II, open- label, single arm trial assesses the anti- NB activity of high -dose 3F8 
(80 mg/m
2/day), which is used in cycles 1-2 , with return to standard 3F8 dosage (20 
mg/m2/day) in subsequent cycles. The patients are post -transplant and in 1st
complete/very good partial remission (CR/VGPR ),89 with no evidence of NB by standard 
studies, but are at high risk for relapse.   
 Clinical results will be compared to those in the predecessor trials which used only the standard 3F8 dosage.  Real- time quantitative RT -PCR
63-65 will be used to assess MRD in 
BM.  13-cis-retinoic acid is started after cycle 2.   
 
4.2 Intervention  
Road Map/Schema (1st CR/VGPR) :  A cycle consists of treatment with 3F8 for 5 days. GM-
CSF is started 5 days in advance of each 3F8 cycle.  The break between end of a cycle of 
3F8/GM-CSF and start of next cycle is 2- to-4-weeks through 4 cycles; subsequent breaks are 
~6-8 weeks.  13- cis-retinoic acid is started after cycle 2.

Continue with ~6-8-week breaks through 24 months from 1st dose of 3F8.  The treatment 
schedule may require minor adjustment as clinically indicated (e.g., due to PDH closure for 
holidays).  Patients can complete the missed day of 3F8 the following week, so they receive 
a full 5-day cycle.  GM -CSF will be continu ed through the 3F8 make-up day at the 500 
mcg/m2 dose.   
 
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS  
5.1  3F8 monoclonal antibody (IND number of BB- IND-8449)  
   5.1.1 Source and Pharmacology:  Monoclonal antibody 3F8 is purified by column chromatography. The final p roduct is tested to assure that it is free of nucleic 
acid, murine viruses, bacteria, fungi, mycoplasma and pyrogens. Supplier: 3F8 is manufactured as an investigational agent.   5.1.2 Formulation and Stability: The purified antibody is frozen at –80
oC, at 2 
mg/mL 0.1 M citrate -phosphate pH 4.2 buffer in glass vials.  At –80oC it is stable for at 
least 3 years.  For iv administration, 3F8 should be diluted into 10 ml 5% human serum albumin and millipore (0.2 µm) filtered before use.  Route of Administration: iv infusion.    
 
 5.2 Yeast-derived human recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating f
 actor GM -CSF; LEUKINE (sargramostim)) is produced by Berlex Laboratories, Seattle, 
 WA. 
 
  5.2.1 LEUKINE is a sterile, white, preservative -free, lyophilized powder 
 suitable for iv infusion upon reconstitution of 250 mcg vials; these vials should be 
 reconstituted aseptically with 1.0 ml Sterile Water for Injection, USP (without 
 preservative). The reconstituted LEUKINE solutions are clear, colorless, isotonic with a  pH of 7.4 ± 0.3, and contain 250 mcg/ml of Sargramostim.  The single-use vial should  not be re-entered or reused.  Do not save any unused portion for later administration.   Vials containing 500 mcg of LEUKINE are already in solution and are multiple dose  vials. 
   5.2.2  During reconstitution the Sterile Water for Injection, USP should be  directed at the side of the vial and the contents gently swirled to avoid foaming during  dissolution. Avoid excessive or rigorous agitation; do not shake.

- 10 - 
  5.2.3 Dilution for iv infusion should be performed in 0.9% Sodium Chloride 
Injection. USP. If the final concentration of LEUKINE is below 10 mcg/ml, Albumin 
(Human), add 1 mg Albumin (Human) per l ml 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP 
 (e.g. use 1 ml 5% Albumin [Human] in 50 ml 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP). 
  5.2.4 An in-line membrane filter is not to be used for iv infusion of LEUKINE.  
 5.2.5 LEUKINE contains no antibacterial preservative and therefore should be 
administered as soon as possible, and within 6 hours following reconstitution and/or dilution for iv infusion. Store LEUKINE powder, reconstituted solutions, or diluted solutions under refrigeration at 2-8°C (36-46°F); do not freeze or shake. LEUKINE vials are intended for single u se only; discard any unused solution after 6 hours.  Do not use 
beyond the expiration date printed on the vial. 
    5.2.6 In the absence of compatibility and stability information, no other 
medication should be added to infusion solutions containing LEUKINE.  Use only 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP to prepare iv infusion solutions. 
 
  5.2.7 Aseptic technique should he employed in the preparation of all LEUKINE Solutions. To assure correct concentration following reconstitution, care should be exercised  to eliminate any air bubbles from the needle hub of the syringe used to prepare 
the diluent. Parenteral products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.

induced maturation of tumor cells is not known. In NB cell lines it has been shown to down reg ulate MYCN RNA and protein expression, and such down regulation correlates 
with the ability of isotretinoin to induce tumor cell growth arrest.  Recent studies using gene transfection directly implicate down regulation of MYCN expression by isotretinoin 
as a key event in achieving sustained arrest of NB cell proliferation. RA also appears to 
enhance normal hematopoietic differentiation by increasing the responsiveness of myeloid and erythroid progenitor cells to the action of myeloid colony stimulating activity and erythropoietin, respectively. Metabolism:
 RA is 99.9% bound in plasma 
(almost entirely to albumin) and has a half- life of 10-20 hours. The major metabolite is 4-
oxoisotretinoin, and excretion is in the urine and feces. A single oral dose of 100mg/m2
isotretinoin will produce peak plasma levels of 1- 2mM. The mean peak time as 3.2 hours 
after 80mg orally, with a terminal t ½ of 10 to 20 hours. Administering 160 mg/m2/day to 
children after autologous bone marrow transplantation has been shown to achieve 13 -cis-
RA levels of 5 to 7 micromolar.

  5.3.2 Formulation and Stability: Isotretinoin, which is the 13- cis isomer of 
retinoic acid, will be used. This is a yellow--orange crystalline powder with a molecular 
weight of 300.44.  Isotretinoin is sensitive to light and oxygen, and so it should not be 
removed from the capsule for longer than one hour prior to administration to the patient 
and it should be kept in subdued light as much as possible. 
   5.3.3 Guidelines for Administration: PO with fat-containing food or milk to 
 enhance absorption.  Administration of the entire capsule is to be encouraged and small  children can be trained to s wallow them using similar sized candy. 
   5.3.4 Supplier: Isotretinoin is available commercially under the trade name 
ACCUTANE (Roche Laboratories) in 10mg, 20mg, and 40mg soft gelatin capsules.  See 
 package insert for further information.

7.0 RECRUITMENT PLAN 
In each of the past 2 years, 46 patients were treated on the predecessor of this protocol.  
We anticipate at least maintaining this accrual rate, which will allow rapid realization of preliminary conclusions, with completion of the trial in 3 -4 years.  Given the favorable 
prior efficacy -toxicity profile with 3F8/GM -CSF, we expect that all patients will 
complete the trial.  Patients will be offered participation in this study by their attending physician in the Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center.  No 
patient will be identified by chart review or direct advertising.  The attending physician will be responsible for explaining the study, obtaining written informed consent, and registering the patient on study.  Patients will mainly be children and adolescents beca use 
of the nature of NB (90% of patients are <6 years old at diagnosis).  Patients of both sexes and all ethnic backgrounds are eligible for this study.   
       
8.0 PRETREATMENT EVALUATION

9.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTI ON PLAN  
9.1 Schedule : 3F8 is dosed at 80 mg/m
2/day (cycles 1 -2) or 20 mg/m2/day (cycles 3 
and beyond) and infused iv over 30-90 minutes.   Patients who experience unacceptable 
pain (see section 11.2.1) or unacceptable hypertension (see section 11.2.2) with high-dose 3F8 can continue on the protocol with standard-dose 3F8. To modulate pain from 3F8, patients are premedicated with analgesics (e.g., hydromorphone) and antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine). 3F8 is started ~1 hr after GM -CSF. GM -CSF is dosed 
at 250 mcg/m
2/day from day –5 to day +1 (i.e. Wednesday to Tuesday is customary), and 
is 500 mcg/m2/day on days +2 to +4 (i.e. Wednesday to Friday), as in the predecessor 
protocols.18,74  Patients come off stud y if progressive disease occurs or if there is life -
threatening grade 4 toxicity from 3F8. 
 
 The break from end of a cycle to start of next cycle is 2 -to-4 weeks through 4 cycles; 
subsequent breaks are ~6-8 weeks.  13- cis-retinoic acid is started after cyc le 2.  Road 
map/schema is in section 4.2.   
 
Patients who develop HAMA which precludes timely treatments with 3F8/GM -CSF are 
eligible to receive low -dose maintenance regimens such as irinotecan alone,92
temozolomide alone,93irinotecan -temozolomide,94 or cyclophosphamide-topotecan.95
They can also receive anti -HAMA agents such as rituximab and cyclophosphamide.  
They resume treatment with 3F8/GM-CSF if HAMA becomes negative.

 13.2Life-threatening grade 4 toxicity clearly attributable to 3F8. 
 
13.3The investigators will make ever y reasonable effort to keep each patient in the 
study until all planned treatments and assessments have been performed.  The investigators may discontinue study drug treatment for the following reasons: 
 
• Adverse events , including unacceptable toxicity or e xacerbation of underlying disease, 
associated with study drug administration and necessitating discontinuation of treatment.  Patients who are removed from the study due to adverse events will be treated and followed according to established, acceptable medical practice.  All pertinent information concerning the outcome of such treatment will be entered in the Case Report Form or on the Serious Event Report, as applicable. 
 
• Withdrawal of consent.   The patient's desire to withdraw from the study may occur at
any time.  The investigator should carefully consider whether the patient’s withdrawal of 
consent is due to an adverse event, and if so, record the adverse event as the reason for withdrawal.
• Withdrawal by the physician  for clinical reasons not related t o study drug treatment, for 
example, clinical need to administer a concomitant medication that is excluded by the protocol, in the absence of an adverse event. 
 
• Violation of the study protocol , including failure to return for required treatments or 
assessments.  Patients who fail to return for treatments will be withdrawn from the study 
if more than 4 scheduled doses are missed 
 
13.4 Patients will not be removed from study in order to receive radiotherapy.   
 
13.5  Patients removed from the study will not be replaced. Every effort will be made to  
follow these patients, with extent-of-disease evaluations performed at least every 3

14.0 BIOSTATISTICS  
The objective of this phase II trial is to assess the anti-NB activity of high-dose 3F8 plus 
GM-CSF in patients who are post- stem cell transplantation and in first CR/VGPR from 
high-risk NB. The 3F8 dosing is four fold greater than the standard 3F8 dosage used in 
prior phase II studies.   
14.1  Primary Endpoint 
 
The primary endpoint i s two-year relapse-free survival (RFS).   
 
14.2  Sample Size  
We will use a Simon’s two- stage design .97 The type I error rate is set as 0.1 and the type 
II error rate as 0.1. 
 
In the predecessor trial (IRB 03 -077: 3F8 at standard dosage of 100 mg/m2/cycle, 
combined with GM-CSF, plus 13- cis-retinoic acid ), the 44 patients treated in CR/VGPR 
post-transplant achieved 78% two- year RFS.  By taking into account of the small sample 
variation, we will consider a two-year RFS rate 0.72 as not promising and 0.88 as 
promising with the new treatment. Eighteen patients will be accrued initially, and if there are less than 14 RFSs, further accrual to the protocol will be stopped and the new 
treatment will be declared ineffective in this protocol.  If there are at least 14 RFSs, then 
an additional 25 patients will be accrued for a total of 43.  If at least 35 RFSs out of 43 patients, the protocol would be considered to have a positive result and the new treatment would be considered worthy of further t esting in this patient population. The probability 
of stopping the study earlier is 54% under the null hypothesis. 
            
 14.3  Accrual Rate  
 
We expect to accrue 10-15 patients per year.  This trial can be completed within 3- 4 
years. The accrual will  continue after the first stage of the study, and the two- stage design 
is used to guard against many early recurrences.  
 
14.4  Secondary Endpoint  
 
The association between histologic examination and real time RT -PCR regarding BM 
status will be assessed by t he Wilcoxon statistic.  The clinical significance (relapse -free 
survival) of histologic results and real time RT-PCR findings will be assessed by log-rank test and Cox regression model.

16.2 Data and Safety Monitoring 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer 
Center were approved by the National Cancer Institute in September 2001.  The plans 
address the new policies set forth by the NCI in the document entitled “Policy of the National Cancer Institute for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials” which can be found at:  http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html
.   The DSM Plans at 
MSKCC were established and are monitored by the Office of Clinical Research.  The MSKCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plans can be found on the MSKCC Intranet at: http://mskweb 2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm
 
There are several different mechanisms by which clinical trials are monitored for data, safety and quality.  There are institutional processes in place for quality assurance (e.g., protocol monitoring, compliance and data verification audits, therapeutic response, and staff education on clinical research QA) and departmental procedures for quality control,  plus there are two institutional committees that are responsible for monitoring the activities of our clinical trials programs.  The committees: Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) for Phase I and II clinical trials, and the Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB)  for Phase III clinical trials,  report to the Center’s Research Council and 
Institutional Review Board.    During the protocol development and review process, each protocol will be assessed for it’s level of risk and degree of monitoring required.  Every type of protocol (e.g., NIH sponsored, in-house sponsored, industrial sponsored, NCI cooperative group, etc.) will be 
addressed and the monitoring procedures will be established at the time of protocol activation.  
 Institutional monitoring plan for phase I and phase II trials:  Memorial Sloan -Kettering 
Cancer Center (MSKCC) has established standard procedures for data safety monitoring 
of clinical research (see appendix).  For Phase II trials, these procedures include consideration of accrual rates, toxicity, adherence to dose- escalation schedules, adverse 
event notification and data recording.  Therapeutic respons es are logged on a central 
database and approximately 50% are reviewed by an independent committee.  An annual report of the trial’s progress is sent to the IRB.  All of the procedures for Phase II studies outlined in MSKCC’s policy are applicable to the c urrent trial and will be followed by 
the investigators.  The analysis of safety will include all patients who receive at least one dose of study medication.  Adverse events, including all toxic effects of treatment, will be tabulated individually, and summarized by body system, according to dosage of study medication (single dose as well as cumulative doses of 3F8 and GM-CSF), and according to severity or toxicity grade.  Laboratory data will be tabulated and summarized by descriptive statistics, as well as  on the basis of MSKCC specified normal ranges.

o If an amendment will need to be made to the protocol and/or consent form 
The PI’s signature and the date it was signed are required on the completed report. 
For IND/IDE protocols : 
The CRDB AE report should be completed as above and the FDA assigned IND/IDE 
number written at the top of the report. The report will be forwarded to the FDA by the Institutional SAE Manager through the IND Office.  
 
17.2.1  All SAEs must
 be entered into the CRDB SAE form page. 
 
SAEs are defined as grade 4 toxicities other than fatigue, weight loss or weight gain, 
anorexia, nausea, anxiety, constipation, urinary retention from opioid analgesics, 
somnolence/hallucinations/ disorientation/confusion/ agitation/anxiety from anti-histamine and opioid premedications, hypomagnesemia, fever, rash, dry skin from 
Accutane, urticaria from 3F8 or GMCSF, myelosuppression from the combination of 3F8 and GM- CSF, pain and transient hypoxia from opioids, and breath-holding with or 
without transient oxygen requirement. Preexisting conditions e.g. hearing loss, hyperbilirubinemia or elevated LFTs from TPN, a lopecia are not counted as SAEs.  
Hospitalizations that arise from complications of chemotherapy are considered part of standard care and therefore will not be reported.

page 7 of 33 1. OBJECTIVES  
1.1. Primary objective  
1.1.1. Determine sensitivity on a per -subject basis of 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC 
PET/CT for detecting tumor location, confirming with conventional 
imaging, clinical follow -up, and histopathology/biopsy where available.  
1.2. Secondary objective  
1.2.1. Determine positive predictive value on a per -subject and per -region basis 
of 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC PET/CT for detecting tumor location, confirming 
with histopathology and conventional imaging.  
1.2.2. Continue to evaluate safety of 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC injection as 
categorized by CTCAE 4.03. 
1.3. Exploratory objective  
1.3.1. Determine the impact of 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT on clinical 
management in patients who have prostate cancer with biochemical recurrence.  
1.3.2. Determine inte r-reader reproducibility.  
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
2.1. Current imaging of prostate cancer  
Per NCCN guidelines ,
3 at the time of biochemical recurrence, imaging is performed 
to detect and characterize the disease to determine treatment or guide change in 
management. Imaging can evaluate anatomic or functional parameters. The following 
imaging is recommended as standard techniques at this time -point:  
• Imaging is performed for the detection and characterization of disease to 
select treatment or guide change in management  
• Anatomic imaging techniques include plain film radiographs, ultrasound, 
CT, and MRI.  
• Functional imaging techniques include radionuclide bone scan, PET, and advanced MRI techniques such as spe ctroscopy and di ffusion -weighted 
imaging (DWI).  
2.2. Prostate Cancer, Biochemical Recurrence  
Biochemical recurrence will be defined using the AUA and ASTRO -Phoenix 
definitions. Specifically:  
2.2.1. Post radical prostatectomy (RP) – AUA recommendation
1 is PSA greater 
than 0.2 ng/mL measured 6–13 weeks after RP and Confirmatory persistent 
PSA greater than 0.2 ng/mL.  
2.2.2. Post-radiation therapy –  ASTRO- Phoenix consensus definition2 nadir + 
greater than or equal to 2 ng/mL rise in PSA  
 
page 8 of 33 2.3. 68Ga-HBED -CC PSMA (68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC) 
Current evidence regarding detection rate of  biochemical recurrence (BCR ) 
with 68Ga-HBED -CC PSMA (68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC) PET/CT from two recent 
papers : 
• Morigi, 2015: Detection rate was 50% when PSA was below 0.5 ng/mL, 
69% for PSA 0.5–2.0 ng/mL, and 86% when PSA was above 2.0 4. 
• Eiber, 2015: Detection rate was 57.9% for PSA 0.2 to <0.5 ng/mL, 72.7% 
for PSA 0.5 to <1, 93.0% for 1 to <2.0, and 96.8% for ≥ 2.0 5.  
2.4. Prior human subjects experience  
Safety . No adverse drug reactions have been  reported in the literature for 68Ga 
PSMA -HBED -CC. As a PET tracer, the drug should remain pharmacologi cally inert 
and not perturb the biological system. Afshar -Oromieh and colleagues6,7 as well as 
Green et al.8 have clearly stated that no adverse events or pharmacologic events were 
observed during their studies. Adverse events were not discussed in other reviewed 
studies9-16 or case reports.17,18 In total, these papers provide data regarding more than 
1200 subjects without any noted adverse reactions.  
Efficacy. To date, there have been 11 studies6,7,10 -12,14,15,26 -29 describing use of 68Ga 
PSMA -HBED -CC and 4 clinical trials.8,13,16 Tables with key information of reviewed 
paper s are provided (Tables 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3)  of the IND Application 
Maurer et al.  (2014) [Germany].11 The purpose of this retrospective study was 
to investigate the diagnostic e fficacy of 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC -PET 
imaging when compared against radical prostatectomy and templated lymph 
node dissection as well as conventional imaging (CT, MRI). The primary inclusion criterion was  intermediate -to-high risk prostate cancer scheduled to 
undergo radical prostatectomy. The only exclusion criterion was presence, or 
history, of a secondary malignancy. A total of 130 patients were reviewed. A contrast enhanced diagnostic CT was performed at the same imaging session 
as the PET scan. A double -trained board certified radiologist -nuclear 
medicine physician blinded to post -operative histopathological results 
analyzed all the imaging data sets (
68Ga PSMA -PET/CT and PET/MR). 
Conventional imaging was read prior to the  68Ga PSMA -PET data. Results 
yielded a patient -based ROC AUC of 0.835 (95% CI 0.763 –  0.908) for  68Ga 
PSMA -PET and an AUC of 0.691 (95% CI 0.592- 0.789) for conventional 
imaging. For  68Ga PSMA -PET, patient -based sensitivity was 65.9 %, 
specificity was 98.9%, and an overall accuracy of 88.5%. In contrast, 
conventional imaging had a patient -based sensitivity of 43.9%, specificity of 
85.4%, and an overall accuracy of 72.3%. On a template -based analysis 
driven by lymph node dissection, the  68Ga PSMA- PET sensitivity was 
calculated as 78.2%, specificity as 99.1%, and accuracy as 95.7%. Conventional imaging resulted in a sensitivity of 29.1%, specificity of 97.2%, 
and accuracy of 86.1%.  
Van Leeuwen et al.  (2014) [Australia].
13 The purpose of this prospective trial 
was to assess accuracy of 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC -PET/CT for lymph node 
page 9 of 33 staging in intermediate - and high- risk prostate cancer. Criteria for selection 
included planned radical prostatectomy, treatment naïve, negative bone scan, 
no concurrent (or history of) a secondary malignancy, and at >5%  risk of 
metastatic lymph nodes. Patients with suspected extra -nodal disease on prior 
contrast -enhanced CT were excluded. 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT was 
performed <4 weeks before the radical prostatectomy and lymph node 
dissection. A total of 30 men were enr olled and evaluated. A non -contrast 
enhanced CT was performed at the same imaging session of the 68Ga PSMA -
HBED- CC -PET. Images were analyzed by two nuclear medicine physicians; 
it is not stated if the physicians were blinded to the pathologic results or i f the 
scan interpretations were completed prior to surgery. Results yielded a 
patient -based specificity of 95%, sensitivity of 64%, positive predictive value 
of 88%, and negative predictive value of 82%. Lymph node analysis yielded 
specificity of 100%, sensitivity of 58%, PPV of 94% and NPV of 98%. The 
mean size of true- positive metastatic lymph nodes was 4.7 mm (± 1.4mm) 
and false- negative size was 2.7mm (± 1.3mm).  
Eiber et al.  (2015)  [Germany].10 The purpose of this retrospectiv e study was 
to investigate the detection rate of 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC PET/CT in men 
with biochemical recurrence (PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL). Only men who had 
undergone a radical prostatectomy, had not received chemotherapy, and had a 
diagnostic CT done with the PSMA im aging study were included. Men 
undergoing antiandrogen therapy (n=70) were included. A total of 248 
subjects were included in the analysis. The active comparator was the 
diagnostic CT done simultaneously with the PET imaging. Scans were 
interpreted by a bo ard certified radiologist and a board certified nuclear 
medicine physician. The reviewers were not blinded. No significant detection 
effect was observed with antiandrogen use (p=0.0783).  PSMA was able to 
identify additional areas of disease involvement in 61 subjects (24.6%) 
whereas CT showed additional regions in 17 subjects (6.9%). A significant 
limitation of the study was a lack of histopathology for outcome comparisons. 
Sensitivity, sp ecificity, positive and negative predictive values are not 
provided.  
Afshar -Oromieh et al.  (2015)  [Germany].7 The purpose of this retrospective 
study was to analyze the diagnostic value of  68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT 
in a large cohort with multiple variables. The cohort was designed to align with a generalized population; men were included if they had suspected 
progressive disease following conventional therapy (radiation therapy and/o r 
radical prostatectomy, n=292) or to determine metastatic disease burden prior 
to initial therapy (n=27). Of those with suspected recurrence, 86 were on 
antiandrogen therapy. A non- contrast enhanced diagnostic CT scan was 
performed at the same imaging ses sion as the PET scan; additionally, a low -
dose attenuation scan was performed for the 
68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET. 
Scans were interpreted by two board -certified nuclear medicine physicians. 
No adverse events or clinically detectable pharmacological effects were noted 
in any of the subjects following injection of the PSMA -HBED -CC 
page 10 of 33 radiotracer. A total of 901 tumor lesions were observed in 319 subjects. 
Lesion -based analysis yielded sensitivity of 76.6%, specificity of 100%, 
negative predictive value of 91.4%, and positive predictive value of 100%. Because all patients were assumed to have tumor and therefore could not be considered ‘true negative,’ the authors did not provide a per -patient 
calculation.  
Green et al.  (2017)  [Indiana University School of Medicine]
8. The purpose of 
this small study was to estimate human radiation dosimetry for  68Ga PSMA -
HBED- CC under approval of an RDRC research protocol. Both 
biodistribution and pharmacokinetics were evaluated in subjects (n = 9). Administered dose of 
68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC was 3.04 mCi and images were 
acquired at 15 minutes post -injection, 60 minutes post -injection, and 90 
minutes post -injection. Subjects reported no symptoms or adverse reactions 
following radiopharmaceutical administration. Organ dose estimates are 
provided 22 organs and for whole body.  
It should be noted that radiolabeled PSMA ligands have been shown to be taken up 
by rectal carcinoma,19 gastrointestinal stromal tumors,20 renal cell carcinoma,21 
pancreatic serous cystadenoma,22 stromal hyperplasia of the breast,23 B-cell follicular 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma,24 and Paget disease.25 
Summary. To date, a prospective, well -controlled clinica l trial evaluating the 
efficacy of 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT has not been performed for prostate 
cancer. Robust trials for both initial diagnosis as well as those men with suspected recurrence needs to be designed and performed. Current retrospective review  of 
68Ga 
PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT done in foreign nations suggests strong efficacy of 
the 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC radiotracer. Currently, three clinical trials are underway –  
two foreign, one domestic.30-32 Additional pivotal phase 3 trials should be completed 
in the U.S. to determine effectiveness in the generalized population a nd determine 
requirements for implementation if found effective.  
2.5. Rationale  
Imaging and staging of prostate cancer is critical for surgical and treatment planning.  
We aim to image patients with suspected metastatic prostate cancer using Gallium- 68 
labeled HBED -CC PSMA (68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC) in order to demonstrate its 
utility.  We plan to utilize this data to obtain further approvals of the 68Ga PSMA -
HBED -CC compound, so that this agent will become widely available for clinical 
imaging in prostate cancer patien ts.  
68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC has become of particular interest due to 2 recent  publication s. 
The first article demonstrate d that 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT ha d a higher 
sensitivity for the detection of disease than F -18 choline in a head -to-head intra -
patient comparison that included 37 patients7. The second paper looked at the 
sensitivity of 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC in the detection of metastatic lesions in patients 
with recurrent prostate cancer8. Their results show ed a detection rate of 50% for 
patients with a PSA less than 1 ng/ml, and detection rate above 85% for patients with a PSA greater than 2 ng/ml.  These detection rates are significantly higher than that 
reported by groups using choline
9. However, 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC was not 
page 11 of 33 patented and therefore no company or private entity will make the investment 
required to bring 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC to market.  In the vacuum of availability, 
academic groups must take the lead in order to collect the necessary data for future FDA approval.  
We aim to study the ability of 
68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC to detect disease at 
biochemical recurrence in post -prostatectomy  or post -radiation  patients .

5. PROCEDURES  
Protocol should not supersede standard of care procedures for patient safety.  
5.1. Imaging preparation  
5.1.1. Oral hydration. Participants will be encouraged to maximize hydration the 
day before and day of 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC imaging.  
5.1.2. Furosemide . 20 mg furosemide (IV push) will be administered concurrently 
or immediately after radiotracer administration to minimize PET scatter 
artifacts from excreted radiotracer accumulation in the kidney and urinary bladder.  
5.1.3. Contrast . Imaging contrast will not be ordered as part of this study.  
5.1.4. Voiding . Participants will be asked to void prior to radiotracer injection.  
5.2. 
68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC administration  
5.2.1. Dose . 3-7 mCi ( 111 – 259 MBq) . Target 5 mCi.  
5.2.2. Route of administration . Intravenous.  
5.2.3. Frequency . Once per PET scan.  
5.2.4. Uptake time . 75 minutes ±  25 minutes. Target 75 minutes  
5.3. Prohibited Medications  
None.  
5.4. PET/CT scan  
5.4.1. Scan coverage . Scan coverage will extend from mid -thigh to the base of the 
skull, starting from the mid -thighs to minimize urinary bladder radiotracer 
accumulation at the start of PET imaging. Subject to void immediately prior to imaging.  
5.4.2. Bed position . Scan time will be dependent on scanner capabilities. At a 
minimum, 3 minutes per bed position wil l be used . 
5.4.3. Discharge. Subject must be monitored for adverse events for a minimum of  
2 hours post -injection.  
5.4.4. Local Analysis. A board- certified nuclear medicine physician on- site will 
interpret the images within 3 business days of the  imaging study. These 
interpretations will not be used for final evaluation, however regional 
positivity results will be collected as study data .  
5.4.5. Internal Blinded Reads . Imaging  data will be interpreted by two  different 
readers in a random order  at separate reading sessions. Cross sectional 
imaging from the CT will be av ailable for anatomic correlate.  Final reads for 
each subject  will be interpreted as positive or negative for the presence of 
pelvic nodal disease, and positive or negative for the presence of osseous metastatic  disease and soft tissue metastases outsid e of the pelvis. All 
readers will have undergone  
68Ga PSMA  PET training.  
5.4.6. Results dissemination.  Local analysis will be shared with the subject’s 
page 13 of 33 clinician and will be included in the subject’s medical record.  
5.5. Visual I nterpretation of PET data  (internal blind reads ) 
Regions of suspected disease will be graded on a two -point scale by each reader 
(0=Negative or 1=Positive). A region will be judged as positive if at least one lesion 
in this region is visually positive . Regions are defined in Table 12.1 in Section 12. 
Criteria for visual interpretation positive for disease are detailed in Section 1 2.1.1. 
5.6. Follow -up imaging  
All subjects should be followed as per standard of care consistent with the 
institution/physician. Reports and copies of any conventional imaging obtained 
during the 12 month window following the PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT scan will be 
obtained. Clini cal notes will also be reviewed to identify metastatic lesions.  
Interpretation of follow -up imaging is performed by local institution following 
standard procedures. Preferable comparison imaging would be the same imaging 
device as the initial re -staging work -up as per RECIST guidelines .  
68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET positive findings will be validated as true positive or 
false positive as outlined in more detail below. False  negative 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC 
PET findings will only be determined when positive  biopsies of 68Ga PSMA -HBED-
CC PET negative lesions that are present on conventional imaging are performed as 
part of standard clinical care. This scenario is uncommon. 
68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET validation based on follow -up imaging  (CT, MRI, bone 
scan) : 
5.6.1. Lymph nodes  68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC positive nodes will be assessed for 
change in size using standard of care follow -up imaging.  
5.6.2. PSMA -positive osseous or metastatic lesions.  68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC 
positive osseous or distant metastatic lesions will be followed by other 
imaging (bone scan, NaF PET, CT or MRI) at the treating phy sician’s 
discretion and local standard of care.  
5.6.3. Biopsy. Biopsies to determine metastas es or provide information for re -
staging should be performed at treating physician’s discretion and per local 
standard of care.  
5.7. General Concomitant Medication and Suppor tive Care Guidelines  
In general, subjects may receive full concomitant and supportive care throughout this 
trial.   
5.8. Follow -Up  
5.8.1. Active follow -up. Subjects will be actively followed for acute adverse 
events for 10 radioactive half -lives rounded up to the cal endar day ( as per 
the established standard ). With a half -life of 67.71 minute  for 68galliu m, the 
active follow -up will be a minimum of 1 calendar day.  
5.8.2. Long term follow -up. After the active follow -up period, the subject will 
return to standard follow -up with their physician. Subject’s outcome will be 
followed through passive chart review. Contact with subject and/or subject’s 
treating physicians may occur to better define treatment outcomes.  
page 14 of 33 5.9. Criteria for remo val from study 
• Consent . Subjects must be able to continue to provide consent for this 
study. If a treating physician or study team member believes a subject can 
no longer provide prospective consent, the investigator will be contacted to 
determine if the  subject can provide consent and is able  continue on study.  
• Refusal to continue in the study . In this event, the reasons for  withdrawal 
will be documented.  
6. PATIENT ASSESSMENTS

page 16 of 33 9. ADVERSE EVENTS: RE PORTING REQUIRE MENTS  
This study will also be monitored by internal oversight specialists at the University of Iowa. 
The Data and Safety Monitoring Plan of the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center provides 
standard operating procedures to monitor all clinical cancer trials at the UIHC. All 
investigator -initiated trials are automatically monitored by the Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC). A detailed data and safety monitoring plan for this study is on file with 
the DSMC . This study has been assigned as a risk level 4 as an IND phase 2b/3 study  
9.1. Determination of Reporting Requirements  
The clinical research team is responsible for collecting and recording the research data. As these results are collected, all toxicities and adverse events will be identified 
and reported to the principal investigator (PI). The PI will determine final relationship 
of the event to the investigational products (
68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC):  
• Grade 1 and 2 events do not require attributions assigned.  
• Grade 3 and higher adverse events require attribution determination . 
• All serious adverse events (SAEs) require attribution determination .  
Toxicity will be graded according to NCI’s Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE v4). The principal investigator will have final responsibility for determining the attrib ution 
of toxicity as it is related to the investigational product.  
9.2. Institutional Review Board reporting requirements  
Adverse events that meet criteria of both serious and attributed  (possible, probable, or 
definite) to the study agent. Thus:  
• Serious adve rse events and 
• Attributable to 
68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC  
Report to the IRB via HawkIRB within 10 business days of event  
9.3. FDA reporting requirements [ M. Graham , sponsor]  
Adverse events that meet criteria of serious, unexpected, and attributed  (possible, 
probable, or definite) to 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC must be reported to the sponsor or 
the sponsor’s appointed designee:  
• Only serious adverse events are reported to FDA [21 CFR 312.32]  
• Attributable to 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC with a causal relationship as 
described [21 CFR 312.32 (c)(1)(i)]  
• Unexpected, as defined by the FDA: “…not listed in the investigator 
brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; 
or, if an investigator or, if an investigator brochure is not require d or 
available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended.”  
9.4. Routine Adverse Event Reporting Requirements to DSMC  
For non- serious adverse events, documentati on must begin at radiotracer injection  
and continue through 24 hours post injection.  
page 17 of 33 Routine adverse events will be reported by submission of an adverse events log to the 
DSMC at the time of DSMC review.  
9.5. Serious  Adverse Event Reporting to DSMC  
Serious ad verse events occurring after 68Ga PSMA -HBED- CC injection  will require a 
notification to the DSMC within 1 busines s day of learning of the event. The SAE 
capture window will be from the administration of 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC through 
24 hours after administration . Serious adverse events that occur after this window are 
reportable if they are deemed reasonably attributed to the investigational drug, 68Ga 
PSMA -HBED -CC. 
10. CLINICAL TRIAL  MONITORING  
Clinical trial monitoring will be conducted to ensure the rights and well -being of human 
subjects are protected, that the reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, and 
that the conduct of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol and/or 
amendment, with good clinical practic e (GCP), and with applicable regulatory 
requirement(s).  
10.1. University of Iowa’s Human Subjects Office  
The University of Iowa’s Human Subjects Office (HSO) provides five different types of monitoring visits (post -approval responsibilities review, post -approval  monitoring 
and education visit, directed monitoring, department of defense sponsored research monitoring, student principal investigator review). The HSO also provides an IND educational visit combined with a post -approval responsibilities review. 
• Monit oring is performed by the HSO from their roster of qualified 
individuals.  
• Monitoring is on- site. 
• An educational IND visit will be requested by the PI. This will be done after 
IRB approval. The IRB indicate if accrual can begin prior to this visit.  
• For the educational IND visit, i f subjects have been consented, all signed 
consent documents will be reviewed.  
• For the educational IND visit, the principal investigator will be provided a copy of the report documenting the visit within 1 month.

12. EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
Determination of efficacy requires two primary assessments.  
The first assessment is the clinical read of the 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT scan. Trained 
readers will identify lesions positive for prostate cancer disease, and based on these results, 
will categorize specifically defined anatomical regions of the subject ( Table 12.2) as positive 
for disease by 68Ga-PSMA -HBED- CC PET/CT. Criteria are described in Section 12.1 below. 
The second assessment is the reference standard determination of disease positivity or 
negativity also performed on the same specifically defined  anatomical regions (Table 12.2).  
The reference standard definitions are described below, and consist of a combination of 
pathological confirmation, conventional imaging follow -up evidence, and serial PSA 
measurements. Criteria are described in Section 1 2.2 below. 
For purposes of endpoints, four major regions are identified for final analysis as defined in Table 12.1. Each region is divided into subregions as defined in Table 12.2. All primary data 
from 
68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET interpretations, pathology results, and conventional 
imaging results, will be collected  per the subregions defined below. The final region 
assignments and results will be derived from the subregion data as applicable.

2 Pelvis outside of prostate bed including lymph nodes  
3 Extrapelvic soft tissue, lymph nodes and organ metastases (non -bone)

   Table 12- 2. Subregion Classification 
page 21 of 33 12.1. 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET  Results Definition  
Imaging interpretation 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET:  
Local Interpretations:   PET images will initially be interpreted by a board certified 
nuclear medicine physician or a board- certified radiologist experienced in reading 
PET at the time of the imaging study at the institution that the study is being 
performed. These interpretati ons will not be used for evaluation of the primary 
endpoint.  
Blinded  Read Logistics:  Imaging data will be de -identified. PET data will be 
interpreted by two  different readers in a random order at separate reading sessions. 
Cross sectional imaging (CT or M RI) from the 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET will be 
available for anatomic correlate. The blinded readers will be blinded to all other 
imaging results and all other clinical data.  
Reader Positivity and Negativity Definition:  Sub-regions defined in Table 12.2 will 
be graded for the presence of suspected disease on a two -point scale by each reader 
(0=Negative or 1=Positive). A region will be judged as positive if at least one lesion 
in this region is visually positive.. 
12.1.1. Criteria for visual interpretation:  
Sub-regions  of suspected disease will be graded on a two -point scale by each 
blinded reader (0=Negative or 1=  Positive). A region will be judged as 
positive if at least one lesion in this region is visually positive.  
12.1.1.1. Lymph nodes will be considered positive if the 68Ga-PSMA -
HBED -CC uptake is focal and greater than blood pool (adjacent 
or mediastinal blood pool).  
- Lymph nodes will be classified further by region: pelvic, 
retroperitoneal, thoracic and other.  Additionally, pelvic lymph 
nodes will be sub- classified accord ing to their localization as 
follows: R/L obturator, R/L external iliac, R/L internal iliac and other (total of 7 subgroups).  These pelvic sub-regions will 
be correlated with reference standard results in these sub -
regions, however this sub- region data wi ll not be directly used 
for evaluation of the primary or secondary endpoints, but for exploratory analysis.  
12.1.1.2. Visceral lesions will be considered positive if the 
68Ga-PSMA -
HBED -CC uptake is focal and greater than physiologic 
background activity of the involvement organ or anatomic site. 
- Visceral lesions will be classified further by major organ: lung, 
liver, pancreas... as defined in Table 2 .  These sub -regions will 
be correlated with reference standard results in these sub -
regions, however this sub- region data will not be directly used 
for evaluation of the primary or secondary endpoints, but for 
exploratory analysis.  
12.1.1.3. Bone lesions will be considered positive if the 68Ga-PSMA -
page 22 of 33 HBED -CC uptake is focal and greater than physiologic bone 
marrow.  
- Bone lesions will be classified by further by region: spine, ribs, 
pelvis, extremities, skull, sternum, and clavicle , as Defined in 
Table 12.2.  These sub- regions will be correlated with 
reference standard results in these sub- regions, however this 
sub-region data will not be directly used for evaluation of the 
primary or secondary endpoint s, but for exploratory analysis .  
12.1.1.4. Prostate bed and prostate lesions will be considered positive if 
the 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC uptake is focal and greater than 
physiologic background activi ty of the involvement organ or 
anatomic site.  
12.2. Reference standard definition:  
12.2.1. Histopathology/Biopsy will be the primary determinate of tissue positivity 
and negativity for prostate cancer disease. Pathology date, organ, and 
location as well as any notes rel ated to the pathology will be obtained from 
the subject  chart.  The anatomical r egion/sub- region the pathology occurred 
in will be assigned by the investigator team:  
68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC positive findings are aimed to be confirmed by 
histopathology/biopsy if clinically feasible.  Pathology performed 60 days 
before or after the 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET will be available for 
correlation.  
Histopathological procedures and biopsies will be performed as clinically indicated and as per institutional protocol. 
12.2.1.1. Lymph Node s, Visceral Lesions, and Bone Lesions positive for 
disease by pathology.  
− Lesions with positive pathologic confirmation will be regarded as 
positive for disease. The regionality of the resected tissue will be 
assigned into respective regions and sub- regions  as described abov e in 
Table 12.2.  
12.2.1.2. Lymph Nodes and Visceral Lesions negative for disease by pathology.  
− Tissue removed and negative for pathology are considered negative for 
prostate cancer disease, unless subsequent conventional imaging 
or 
68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET imaging demonstrates that targeted 
tissue were not resected. In this case:  
i. Subjects can be rescanned with dedicated CT, MRI, or 68Ga-
PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT to determine if the suspicious 68Ga-
PSMA -HBED -CC tissue was removed. If the tissue is 
confirmed as removed, this is considered negative for disease.  
page 23 of 33 ii. If 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT positive tissue is still 
present, a needle biopsy can be pursued at the discretion of the 
treating physician. Images of the procedure will be reviewed to determine i f the correct tissue was biopsied.  
- If the 
68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT positive tissue was 
biopsied, a negative pathologic finding of the biopsied tissue is considered negative for disease.  
- If the 
68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT positive tissue was 
biopsied, a positi ve pathologic finding of the biopsied 
tissue is considered positive for disease.  
- If biopsy or re -biopsy is not performed, or the wrong tissue 
was biopsied, change in node size as measured by conventional imaging and as defined below will be the criteria by  which disease status will be defined.  
12.2.1.3. Bone lesions:  Given the high rate of false negative biopsies for osseous metastases in subject s with prostate cancer, subject s with 
negative bone biopsies of 
68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET positive 
lesions will be further eva luated:  
- If pathology demonstrates an alternative diagnoses that is known to be 
68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC positive (eg Renal Cell 
Carcinoma metastases, Paget’s disease), then this will be considered negative for disease.  
- If pathology is indeterminate, then follow -up imaging as 
described below will be performed as per clinical standards at the site.  
12.2.1.4. Although not routinely performed during standard practice, immunohistochemical staining for PSMA of tumor specimens (primary and lymph node metastases) may be performed, although not required.  
12.2.1.5. All regions not sampled for biopsy/histopathology will be designated as indeterminate for disease by pathology. Conventional imaging follow -up may be used in these cases to 
determine tissue status.  
12.2.2. Follow -up Imaging will be used as a  secondary assessment for prostate 
cancer in the event pathology information is not available:  
All subject s will be tracked for follow -up conventional imaging between 3- 12 
months post 
68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC (dedicated CT, MRI and/or bone scan) 
as per site standard of care.  If no follow -up imaging has been performed 
within the 9 months following the 68Ga-PSMA -HBED- CC scan, then the 
research study will pay for an additional follow -up CT scan to be performed 
page 24 of 33 in the 9 -12 month window post -68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC scan.  Follow up 
imaging will only be performed on subjects that have positive 68Ga-PSMA -
HBED- CC findings because conventional imaging assessment for disease is 
primarily targeting suspicious lesions identified by 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -
CC PET/CT. Interpretation of follow -up imaging will be performed by local 
read. Preferably, the follow -up conventional imaging should be the same 
modality/modalities as the initial staging work -up to allow for reproducible 
and accurate co mparisons.  Conventional imaging standards as described 
below will be used to determine tissue positive for prostate cancer disease. 
Conventional imaging will not be used to determine negative prostate cancer disease regions due to its inherently low negative predictive value.  
Tissue positive for
 prostate cancer disease based on follow -up imaging:  
12.2.2.1. Lymph nodes  will be assessed by change in size.  
i. Positive for disease:  
a. -For subject s undergoing systemic treatment (alone or in 
combination with targeted treatme nt): If on post -treatment 
follow -up imaging within 3 -12 months, visually suspicious 
lymph nodes seen on CT or MRI decrease by more than 30% in 
short axis diameter and PSA declines by more than 50%. 
- If PSA increases by more than 25% (PCWG3 definition of 
recurrence)  on systemic therapy, then an increase in the 
size of lesion by more than 20% in the short axis diameter 
will be considered a positive for disease.  
b. In subjects with localized suspected lymph node(s) receiving targeted treatment without concomitant systemic treatment there are two ways to achieve positive for disease designation:  
- If the subject shows a decrease of PSA by greater than 50% after targeted treatment and the lymph node does not enlarge (change in size less than 20% in the short axis diame ter or less than 3 mm increase in short axis diameter) 
[OR] 
- If on post -treatment follow -up imaging within 3 -12 months, 
lymph nodes seen on CT or MRI decrease by more than 30% in short axis diameter (with a minimum of 3 mm in 
change in size)  
c. For untreated s ubject s: If on follow -up imaging within 3 -12 
months, lymph nodes seen on CT or MRI increase by more than 20% in short axis diameter (with a minimum of 3 mm in change in size).  
page 25 of 33 ii. Negative for disease:  
- Conventional Imaging follow -up will not be used for 
assessment of negativity for disease.  
iii. Indeterminate for disease  
- Regions with no lymph nodes determined to be positive by the 
conventional imaging criteria described above and without pathology will be designated regions indeterminate for prostate cancer disease.  
- Subjects that have had neither pathology sampling, nor 
conventional imaging follow up will have all regions 
designated as indeterminate for disease by reference standard.  
12.2.2.2. Visceral lesions (non -lymph node soft tissue or organ)
 and 
prostate bed and prostate  lesions will be assessed by change in 
size.  
i. Positive for disease:  
a. For subject s undergoing systemic treatment (alone or in 
combination with targeted treatment): If on post -treatment 
follow -up imaging within 3 -12 months, visually conspicuous 
lesions seen on CT or MRI decrease by more than 30% in long 
axis diameter and PSA declines by more than 50%.  
- If PSA increases by more than 25% (PCWG3 definition of recurrence) on systemic therapy, then an increase in the size of lesion by more than 20% in the long axis  diameter 
will be considered positive for disease.  
b. In subjects with localized suspected lesions(s) receiving targeted treatment without concomitant systemic treatment there are two ways to meet positive disease criteria: 
- If the subject demonstrates a decre ase of PSA by greater 
than 50% after targeted treatment [ OR] 
- If on post -treatment follow -up imaging within 3 -12 months, 
lesions seen on CT or MRI decrease by more than 30% in long axis diameter (with a minimum of 3 mm in change in size)  
c. For untreated subje cts: If on follow -up imaging within 3 -12 
months, lesions seen on CT or MRI increase by more than 20% 
page 26 of 33 in long axis diameter (with a minimum of 3 mm in change in 
size).  
ii. Negative for disease:  
- Conventional Imaging follow up will not be used for 
assessment of negativity for disease  
iii. Indeterminate for disease  
- Regions with no visceral lesions determined to be positive by 
the conventional imaging criteria described above and without pathology will be designated as visceral regions indeterminate for prostate cancer disease.  
- Prostate bed and prostate regions not determined to be positive 
by the conventional imaging criteria described above and 
without pathology will be designated as prostate regions indeterminate for prostate cancer disease.  
- Subjects that have had nei ther pathology sampling, nor 
conventional imaging follow up will have all prostate and visceral regions designated as indeterminate for disease by reference standard.  
12.2.2.3. Bone lesions will be considered:  
i. Positive for disease on baseline assessment:  
- Any positiv e sclerotic lesion on the CT portion of the 
68Ga-
PSMA -HBED -CC PET or on a separate CT obtained ≤  30 days 
before or after the PET/CT.  
- Focal uptake on the baseline bone scan performed within one month of 
68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET.  
- Any MRI lesion in bone read as positive on the initial MRI 
performed within one month of 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET.  
ii. Positive for disease on follow up:  
- Any new positive sclerotic lesion on CT within 12 months 
of 68Ga-PSMA -HBED -CC PET scan  
- Any new MRI bone lesion within 12 months of 68Ga-PSMA -
HBED -CC PET scan

conventional imaging criteria described above and without 
pathology will be designated bone regions indeterminate for prostate cancer disease.  
13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1. Statistical Justification  
This study is a pilot study to determine target sensitivity fo r 
68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC 
for the detection of metastatic prostate cancer in the biochemical recurrent population. 
Based upon literature , we anticipate sensitivities of > 80% in this patient population, 
but there are uncertainties, particularly related to the pr oposed reference standard. We 
plan to use the results of this pilot study, potentially combined with reported results 
from other sites across the US performing similar  studies (same patient population, 
same methods, same reference standard definitions…) to determine most- appropriate 
primary endpoint sensitivities for a larger University of Iowa study to follow this one, so as to appropriately statistically power the larger study.  
The primary objective of this pilot study is to obtain preliminary information  on the 
sensitivity of physician reads for Ga -68 PSMA post -prostatectomy biochemical 
recurrence; physicians’ ability to correctly identify biochemical recurrence via Ga- 68 
PSMA relative to our pathology/conventional imaging reference standard. Due to the 
lack of clinical experience with this radiopharmaceutical, this pilot study is meant to 
gain meaningful information of the sensitivity of this agent in this patient population 
to generate hypotheses for further trials.  
To evaluate sensitivity, patients must undergo both Ga -68 PSMA imaging and 
evaluation for biochemical recurrence by pathology, follow -up conventional imaging, 
or both. Sensitivity is defined as:

13.2. Primary and S econdary E ndpoints  using histopathology/biopsy and 
conventional imaging follow -up 
Primary:  Sensitivity on a per -subject basis of 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT for 
detection of tumor location confirmed by histopathology/biopsy and conventional 
imaging follow -up will be calculated and reported along with the corresponding two-
sided 95% confidence intervals. The confidence intervals will be constructed using 
the Wilson score method.   
No statistical significance will be generated due to the pilot nature of the project.  
Secondary:  PPVs on a per -subject and per -region -basis of 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC 
for detection of tumor location confirmed by histopathology/biopsy and conventional 
imaging follow -up will be calculated and reported along with the corresponding two-
sided 95% confidence intervals. The confidence intervals will be constructed using 
the Wilson score method. 
The following definitions will define accuracy of 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC for 
detection of tumor location confirmed by histopathology/biopsy and conventional 
imaging follow -up 
No statistical significance will be generated due to the pilot nature of the project.  
13.3. Definitions of 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC accuracy  
13.3.1. True positive definitions  
13.3.1.1. 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT positive for nodal 
metastases  by internal blind  reader – and pathology (if 
available) positive for that node, or node positive for disease by 
imaging as defined in Section 12.2.2.1 If this criteria is met, the 
subject is defined as true positive for nodal disease. 
13.3.1.2. 68Ga PSMA -HBED -CC PET/CT positive for viscera l 
metastases  by internal blind  reader – and pathology (if 
available) positive for that visceral lesion, or, visceral lesion 
positive for disease by imaging as defined in Section 12.2.2.2. If this criteria is met, the subject is defined as true positive for  
visceral disease.  
13.3.1.3.

page 29 of 33 metastases by internal blind reader - and pathology (if 
available) positive for that osseous lesion, or, osseous lesion 
positive for disease by imaging as defined in Section 12.2.2.3. If this criteria is met, the subject is defined as true positive for 
osseous disease.

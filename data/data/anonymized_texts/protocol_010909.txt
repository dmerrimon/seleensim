Page 3 2. SYNOPSIS  
Name of Sponsor/  Company: Alkermes, Inc.  
Name of Investigational Product: ALKS 3831  
Name of Active Ingredients: samidorphan and olanzapine 
Title of Study: A Phase 2, Randomized, Multicenter, Safety, Tolerability, and Dose-Ranging Study of 
Samidorphan, a Component of ALKS 3831, in Adults with Schizophrenia Treated with Olanzapine  
No. of Study Centers: This is a multi -center study  
Studied Period:  
Estimated date first patient consented: June 2013  
Estimated date last patient completed: June 2015 Phase of development: 2 
Objectives:  
The objecti ves of this study are to evaluate 3 doses of samidorphan co -administered with olanzapine 
(ALKS 3831) in subjects with schizophrenia to (1) evaluate ALKS 3831 as a treatment for 
schizophrenia, (2) assess the safety and tolerability of ALKS 3831 , and (3) cha racterize the impact of the 
samidorphan component of ALKS 3831 on weight and other metabolic factors. 
Methodology: 
This is a Phase 2, randomized, placebo -controlled multicenter study, which will be conducted in 2 parts: 
Part A and Part B. Part A will begin with screening and will include a 1 -week olanzapine lead -in period 
followed by a 12-week double-blind, placebo- controlled treatment period where subjects will receive 
samidorphan or placebo (in addition to the olanzapine prescribed on Study Day 1). Part B will include an 
additional 12- week treatment period where all subjects will receive active olanzapine + samidorphan (ie, 
ALKS 3831). At the end of Part B, samidorphan dosing will stop, but olanzapine dosing will continue uninterrupted through the 4- week follow-up period, which includes 2 safety visits. 
This study will use an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) to monitor for tolerability of 
study drug. After at least 1 week of safety data has been collected for 40 randomized subjects, the 
DSMB  will review the accumulated safety data for all subjects. After at least 1 week of safety data has 
been collected for 150 randomized subjects, the DSMB will review the accumulated safety data for all 
subjects. Complete details of the membership and functi oning of this board will be available in the 
DSMB Charter.  
During clinic visits, assessments of psychotic symptoms using measures such as the Positive and 
Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Clinical Global Impressions- Severity (CGI -S) will occur. Body 
weight will be measured using consistent methods at every visit. Alcohol and drug use will be monitored 
throughout the study. Concentrations of samidorphan, RDC-9986 (primary metabolite of samidorphan), 
and olanzapine will be determined in plasma samples collected at Visits 2 -23. 
Part A (Screening, Olanzapine Lead -in, and Double -blind Treatment Period)  
Screening assessments will occur in the 30 -day period before subjects report to the clinic for verification 
of eligibility and initiation of olanzapine treatment (Study Day 1). On Study Day 1 (Visit 2), all eligible 
subjects will be initiated on olanzapine.  Olanzapine dose will be selected and titrated by the principal 
investigator ( PI) based upon individual subject needs and consistent with current clinical prac tice. 
Subjects will return one week later (ie, Study Day 8, Visit 3) for a 2 -night inpatient stay and the start of 
the 12-week double-blind placebo- controlled treatment period. At this visit, subjects will be randomized 
in a 1:1:1:1 ra tio to receive samido rphan (5, 10, or 20 mg) or placebo. Olanzapine dosing will continue 
uninterrupted. Thus, the Part A treatment groups will be as follows: 
Protocol Amendment #3- CZ CONFIDENTIAL  Alkermes, Inc  
13 June 2014 ALK3831-302 
Page 4 • Olanzapine + Samidorphan (5 mg) • Olanzapine + Samidorphan (20 mg) 
• Olanzapine + Samidorphan (10 mg) • Olanzapine + Placebo  
All study drug will be taken once daily by mouth. Olanzapine and samidorphan/placebo tablets should 
be taken together (ie, at the same time). Randomization will be stratified by the amount of weight 
change during the olanzapine lead-in period (ie, from Day 1 to Day 8), with subjects grouped into the 
following 3 strata: 
• Weight change ≤0 kg • Weight increase >0 to <1 kg • Weight increase ≥1 kg 
Subjects will be discharged from the inpatient unit on Study Day 10 (Visit 5) and will return on Study Day 15 (Visit 6 ). 
Subjects are not required to be taking any antipsychotic medication at the time of screening or Visit 2. However, those who are will be tapered off of their prior antipsychotic medication within two weeks after initiation (ie, by Study Day 15, Visit 6). This cross-taper from prior antipsychotic treatment to 
olanzapine will be conducted under the care and discretion of the PI  and consistent with current clinical 
practice.  
After Study Day 15 subjects will return to the clinic weekly through the first month of double-blind treatment (ie, Study Day 36) and then every 2 weeks thereafter for the remainder of Part A. Any subject who prematurely discontinues during Part A will be asked to return to the clinic for an early termination  
(ET) visit and will be asked to return for follow -up visits 2  and 4 weeks later.

Shaded cells represent inpatient stays.  
Assessments prior to study drug administration at Visit 13 (the transition visit) will serve as end of Part A assessments; dosing and post- dose assessments will be considered Part B assessments.  
Part B (Active ALKS 3831 Treatment and Safety Follow- up Periods)  
After completion of Part A (ie, at Visit 13), subjects will transition into Part B and will continue onto a 
12-week active treatment period during which all subjects will receive ALKS 3831 (ie, olanzapine plus 
samidorphan). Subjects who had been receiving ALKS 3831 during the double-blind period will 
continue on the same dose for the 12 -week active treatment period. Subjects who had been receiving 
olanzapine + placebo in the double -blind period will continue on the same dose of olanzapine and will 
be transitioned from placebo to samidorphan (at the highest dose). 
At Visit 13 (Study  Day 92), subjects will be admitted for a 2 -night inpatient stay (Visits 13 -15, Study 
Days 92 -94) to allow for monitoring following initiation of samidorphan dose in subjects originally 
assigned to the olanzapine + placebo group. The inpatient stay is required for all subjects. After 
discharge (Study Day 94), subjects will return 5 days later for Visit 16 (Study Day 99). After Visit 16, 
subjects will be seen weekly for the next 3 weeks (Visits 17 -19) and then at 2- week intervals for the 
remainder of the stu dy (Visits 20 -25). 
The subject will take the final samidorphan dose the night before Visit 23 (Study Day 176). No samidorphan dose will be administered onsite during Visit 23. Olanzapine dosing will continue 
uninterrupted through a 4 -week follow -up period:  A safety follow -up visit will occur 2 weeks after and

Shaded cells represent inpatient stays . 
Number of subjects (planned):  Approximately 280 subjects will be randomized. 
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion:  
Adul ts (18 -50 years of age) with stable schizophrenia who may benefit from olanzapine treatment, who 
have a body mass index (BMI) of 17-30 kg/m2, who have maintained a stable body weight for at least 
3 months prior to screening (change ≤5%) and from screening to Visit 2 (change ≤1 kg), and who have 
not been exposed to olanzapine, clozapine, mesoridazine, chlorpromazine, or thioridazine for more than 
1 week within the past year or at any time in the 3 months prior to screening will be considered for participation. Complete eligibility criteria are listed in Section 7.1  and Section 7.2. 
Investigational product dosage and mode of administration: 
ALKS  3831 refers to the combination of olanzapine and samidorphan. In this study, olanzapine and 
samidorphan will be co- administered. Commercially available olanzapine for oral administration will be 
supplied or arranged for dispensing by the investigative site. 
Samidorphan will be provided by the sponsor. Each tablet contains samidorphan (2.5, 5 or 10 mg). 
Subjects will take 2 tablets per day by mouth (ie, doses of samidorphan will be 5, 10, or 20 mg). 
Samidorphan is a Schedule II controlled substance according to the United States Drug Enforcement 
Agency and will require proper handling. 
Reference product dosage and mode of administration:  
Placebo consists of tablets identical in size and appearance to the samidorphan tablets, but without active 
samidorphan. Subjects will take 2 tablets per day by mouth.  
Duration of study: The study duration for each subject will be approximately 33 weeks and will include 
25 study visits. This includes up to one month for screening, a 1- week lead -in period of olanzapine 
dosing, two 12- week treatment per iods (a 12 -week double-blind placebo-controlled period and a 
12-week period where all subjects get active ALKS  3831), and safety follow-up visits which occur 2 and 
4 weeks after Visit 23 . 
Criteria for evaluation:  
Safety Assessments  
Safety will be evaluated based on the following measures: 
• Incidence of Adverse events (AEs)  
• Clinical laboratory test (chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) results  
• Vital signs  including blood pressure  
Protocol Amendment #3- CZ CONFIDENTIAL  Alkermes, Inc  
13 June 2014 ALK3831-302 
Page 6 • Electrocardiograms (ECGs)  
• Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
• Laboratory parameters including HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose 
and insulin, ratio of fasting glucose to fasting insulin, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), C -reactive 
protein, leptin, bicarbonate, and carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT)  
Reported AE terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) 
preferred terms and system organ classes. Concomitant medications will be categorized using the World 
Health Organization (WHO) Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system.  
Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
For all subjects, plasma samples will be collected according to the schedule in Table  1 and Table  2 for 
quantifying olanzapine, samidorphan, and RDC-9986 (primary metabolite of samidorphan) concentrations. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data may be used to assess compliance with study drug 
administration and/or in a subsequent population PK evaluation conducted outside of this study. 
Efficacy Assessments  
Efficacy will be evaluated based on following measures:  
• Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)  
• Body weight 
• Waist circumference  
• Clinical Global Impressions -Severity (CGI -S) 
• Impact of Weight on Quality of Life – Lite Question naire (IWQOL -Lite)  
• Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP)  
• Timeline Follow -Back (TLFB) assessment of alcohol drinking  
• Food Craving Inventory (FCI)  
Other Assessments:  
Pharmacogenetic assessments to explore the relationship between olanzapine-induced weight gain and 
genotype and identify people susceptible to weight gain  
Endpoints:  
Primary Endpoint:  Absolute change in PANSS total score from randomization to the end of Part A 
Secondary Endpoints:  
• Percent change in body weight  
• Number and percentage of subj ects with adverse events from randomization to the end of 
Part A  
• Absolute change in body weight 
• Proportion of subjects exhibiting significant weight gain (definition of weight gain will include body weight gain greater than 7%) 
• Absolute change in CGI-S  
 
Protocol Amendment #3- CZ CONFIDENTIAL  Alkermes, Inc  
13 June 2014 ALK3831-302 
Page 7 Additional Endpoints:  
• Change in waist circumference  
• Change in blood lipid concentrations including LDL, HDL, total cholesterol and 
triglycerides  
• Change in assessments related to glucose regulation including fasting glucose and insulin, fasting glucose to fasting insulin ratio, HbA1c, C- reactive protein, leptin and bicarbonate  
• Change in vital signs including blood pressure 
• Change in IWQOL- Lite scales (physical function, self -esteem, sexual life, public distress 
and work) and total score 
• Change in PSP 
• Change in FCI  
• Change in alcohol and drug use  
Statistical methods:  
Once all subjects have completed Part A of the study, an unblinded analysis of the 12- week placebo -
controlled data will be performed. This analysis may be conducted prior to the completion of Part B of the study. 
Safety 
All subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug (olanzapine, samidorphan, or placebo) will be 
included in the safety analysis. The secondary endpoint, number and percentage of subjects with adverse 
events from randomization to the end of Part A, will be analyzed descriptively by treatment group. Adverse events will be summarized overall and by MedDRA® preferred terms and system organ class 
as well as by severity and by relationship to study drug. Additional analysis of safety assessments will 
include summary statistics including mean, median, interquartile range, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables and number and percent for categorical variables. These statistics will be provided 
for the following: AEs, ECG parameters, laboratory test results, vital signs, and C -SSRS results during 
the entire study. 
Efficacy  
The efficacy analysis will be conducted on 2 full analysis set (FAS) populations: 
• The FAS 1 population will include all subjects who are randomized, receive at least one 
dose of study drug, and have at least one post- baseline PANSS assessment.  
• The FAS 2 population will include all FAS 1 subjects who gained weight during the initial week of olanzapine treatment prior to randomization and have at least one post- baseline 
weight assessment.
 
The primary endpoint is the absolute change in PANSS total score from randomization to the end of Part 
A (ie, the end of the 12- week, placebo -controlled double- blind treatment period) and will be evaluated 
by treatment group (ALKS 3831 vs. the placebo group [olanzapine alone]) using a 2-sided mixed-model 
for repeated measures ( MMRM ) to test for equivalence at an alpha level of 0.05. The primary analysis 
will be conducted in the FAS 1 population. More details about this analysis will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
The secondary endpoint, percent change in weight from randomization to the end of Part A, will be evaluated by treatment group using an MMRM approach similar to that of the primary endpoint. However, this wi ll be a superiority analysis. Each treatment group will be compared to the placebo 
Protocol Amendment #3- CZ CONFIDENTIAL  Alkermes, Inc  
13 June 2014 ALK3831-302 
Page 8 group with a 2 -sided hypothesis test to test for superiority at an alpha level of 0.05. The secondary 
efficacy analysis will also be conducted in the FAS 1 population. More details about this analysis will be 
provided in the SAP.  
Analysis of  other secondary endpoints and additional endpoints will include inferential analyses and 
descriptive analyses by visit (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous 
variables and number and percent for categorical variables), as appropriate.  
Analyses for the primary and secondary endpoints will be repeated in the FAS 2 population as sensitivity 
analyses when applicable. Additional details regarding these analyses w ill be provided in the SAP.  
Sample size considerations 
Sample size calculations are based on the primary endpoint of absolute change in PANSS total score. 
These calculations assume an equivalence margin of 10 points, a standard deviation of 20 points, and a 
true difference of 0 points. With these assumptions, 280 randomized subjects provide 95% power to detect  equivalence on the primary endpoint (absolute PANSS total score change from randomization to 
the end of Part A) with a 2- sided test at an alpha level  of 0.05. These 280 subjects represent 70 subjects 
for each treatment arm (ALKS 3831 5 mg, ALKS  3831 10 mg, ALKS 3831 20 mg, and placebo) in a 
1:1:1:1 ratio. For the primary analysis, subjects in the 3 ALKS  3831 treatment groups will be pooled for 
comparis on with placebo. If this analysis shows equivalence, follow-up analyses on individual dose 
levels will be performed . Assuming a 20% discontinuation rate prior to randomization, an estimated 350 
subjects will be enrolled in this study.

5.1. Background  
Olanzapine is regarded as one of the most effective antipsychotics with well -recognized efficacy 
and other advantages such as decreased incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms. However, it also 
has safety and tolerability limitations which have been demonstrated to affect compliance and 
retention of patients on olanzapine therapy [ Lieberman, 2005]. In particular, results of the 
CATIE (Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness) study identify olanzapine as 
an effective atypical antipsychotic agent associated with the highest weight gain (4.2 kg over up 
to 18 months of treatment and an overall >7% body weight in 30% of subjects) and a 
comparatively higher discontinuation rate due to increases in body weight and metabolic effects than other antipsychotic agents [Lieberman, 2005] . Further, it is estimated that between 40 -60% 
of people with schizophrenia abuse alcohol and/or illicit drugs [ Lubman, 2010], and these “dual 
diagnosis” patients have worse outcomes on a variety of measures [Batki, 2009;Dixon 1999 ]. 
ALKS  3831 is a combination drug under investigation for treatment of schizophrenia. The 
principle active component in ALKS 3831 is olanzapine. The other active component is samidorphan, a new chemical entity that clinical studies have shown to limit the weight gain caused by olanzapine alone. This effect was first seen in a proof -of- concept study conducted in 
healthy adults (Study ALK33-301). This eff ect appears to be specific to antipsychotic weight 
gain because samidorphan did not cause meaningful changes in weight when administered as a single agent in adults with  binge eating disorder (Study ALK33-101). 
As stated previously, despite being regarded as one of the most effective antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia, safety and tolerability limitations have affected compliance and retention of patients on olanzapine therapy. As a result, many patients are switched from 
olanzapine to other a ntipsychotics to address tolerability issues even if the alternative 
antipsychotic is regarded as less effective. The presence of samidorphan in ALKS 3831 is to 
enhance the benefit and decrease the risk of the principal ingredient, olanzapine. 
In addition to enhancing the safety of olanzapine, samidorphan may help with substance abuse in 
schizophrenia. Comorbid substance abuse is regarded as a considerable obstacle in the treatment and management of many patients with schizophrenia. Samidorphan (also referr ed to as ALKS 
33 or RDC-0313) is structurally derived from naltrexone and like naltrexone, acts as an antagonist at μ-opioid receptors with mixed agonist/antagonist activity at both κ and δ receptors. In laboratory animals and in humans, samidorphan is a potent µ-antagonist. Clinical data have 
shown that samidorphan blocked both the subjective and physiological effects of the opioid 
agonist remifentanil (Study ALK33 -004). In adults with alcohol dependence, samidorphan was 
associated with a reduction in drinking behavior (Study ALK33-005). 
Thus, the combination of samidorphan and olanzapine (ie, ALKS 3831) as a fixed-dose 
combination may result in an enhanced therapeutic agent for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. ALKS 3831 could thereby address the need for antipsychotics with improved 
benefit/risk profiles for schizophrenia patients for whom olanzapine is the optimal antipsychotic 
choice as well as dual diagnosis patients and expand the population of patients for whom olanzapine is the antipsychotic of choice.

Page 16 5.2. Study Drugs  
In this study, samidorphan and olanzapine will be co- administered oral tablets. The following 
sections provide an overview of samidorphan and olanzapine. Detailed information about the 
study drugs can be found in the ALKS 3831 Investigator ’s Brochure  (IB) and Zyprexa® 
(olanzapine) United States (US) Package Insert [2011] respectively . 
5.2.1. Samidorphan 
Samidorphan is a new chemical entity in clinical development by Alkermes. It is an opioid modulator which acts primarily as an antagonist at µ opioid receptors, with mixed 
agonist/antagonist activity at δ and κ receptors. It is currently being investigated as a single agent for the treatment of reward disorders, in combination with buprenorphine for the treatment of 
major depressive disorder and for the treatment of cocaine dependence, and in combination with 
olanzapine for the treatment of schizophrenia. Based on its chemical structure, samidorphan is a Schedule II  controlled substance according to the US Drug Enforcement Agency and will require 
proper handling (see Section  10). 
Ten clinical studies of samidorphan have been conducted to date, 8 of which included subjects that received samidorphan alone (not in combination with another product). Overall, 
approximately 600 subjects have been exposed to samidorphan. Commonly reported adverse 
events (AEs) observed across all studies included nausea, fatigue, and somnolence. Overall, no trends or clinically meaningful changes have been observed in clinical laboratory analytes, vital 
sign parameters, or electrocardiogram (ECG) data.  
5.2.2. Olanzapine  
Olanzapine has been available in the US  since 1996 and was originally approved for the 
treatment of schizophrenia, but has since been approved for other indications including the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents and bipolar disorder. The safety and tolerability profile 
of olanzapine is well documented, and adverse event labeling is supported by an extensive safety database that includes over 8,500 adult patients [ 2011]. Commonly reported AEs consistent 
across all or most dosage forms in short-term, placebo controlled trials include somnolence, constipation, dry mouth, accidental injury, weight gain, postural hypotension, dizziness, asthenia, fever and abnormal gait. 
5.3. Study Ra tionale  
Schizophrenia is a lifelong illness and changes in medication are often made to better manage 
evolving symptoms and to control side effects and/or tolerability issues. Similar to what was 
done in the landmark CATIE study [ Lieberman, 2005] , this study is seeking to enroll patients 
that are psychiatrically stable, where stability is largely defined by the absence of significant 
fluctuations or an acute exacerbation of symptoms. In these patients, stability may still reflect a 
sub-optimal condition that could be improved by transitioning to a different medication. Other 
patients may be well-controlled on their current antipsychotic, but may be experiencing 
unpleasant or intolerable side effects such as hyper prolactinemia or extrapyramidal symptoms. 
These patients may also benefit from switching to a different medication.  
Protocol Amendment #3- CZ CONFIDENTIAL  Alkermes, Inc  
13 June 2014 ALK3831-302 
Page 17 In this Phase 2 study, such patients will be transitioned to olanzapine which is widely regarded as 
one of the most efficacious antipsychoti cs currently available. Patients with stable symptoms 
who are not currently taking an antipsychotic, but who may benefit from treatment with olanzapine, are also eligible to participate in this study. In addition to olanzapine, subjects will also receive s amidorphan. Samidorphan may offer a range of potential benefits when 
administered with olanzapine for patients with schizophrenia including attenuated weight gain and a reduction in concomitant substance abuse. Both of these benefits have the potential to increase patient retention on therapy and improve long term outcomes.  
One Phase 1 study, ALK33-301, has been conducted in healthy adults (N = 106) to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of samidorphan taken with olanzapine to mitigate olanzapine-induced weight gain. The co-administration of samidorphan (5 mg) and olanzapine when 
administered once daily for 3 weeks to healthy volunteers was generally well tolerated and 
resulted in significantly less weight gain compared with subjects administere d olanzapine alone. 
Aside from a positive effect on weight gain, samidorphan did not appear to impact the adverse event profile of olanzapine in this Phase 1 study. The co-administration of samidorphan and 
olanzapine did not impact the pharmacokinetics (PK) of either individual drug. 
Alkermes refers to the combination of olanzapine and samidorphan as ALKS 3831. The current 
Phase 2 study in adults with schizophrenia will assess the efficacy of ALKS 3831 on psychiatric 
symptoms , the safety and tolerability of  ALKS 3831, and whether subjects receiving ALKS 3831 
gain less weight than subjects receiving placebo . 
Future studies will explore other anticipated benefits conferred by ALKS 3831 opioid modulation. 
5.4. Dose Rationale  
Commercially available olanzapine will be  administered at the dose selected by the principal 
investigator  (PI) based on the individual subject’s clinical condition. 
Clinical studies investigating the safety, tolerability, PK , and exploratory efficacy with 
samidorphan have found this compound to be safe and generally well tolerated following single 
oral doses of 1-55.7 mg and up to 12- weeks of once daily oral or sublingual (1-10 mg) 
administration (see ALKS 3831 IB). The samidorphan dose levels (oral administration) in the 
current trial (5, 10, and 20 mg) were selected based on PK, pharmacologic, and safety 
considerations. It is expected that these doses will be sufficient to establish a therapeutic dose 
range and inform dose selection for future studies.  
Based on the divergent metabolic pathways of samidorphan and olanzapine, and supported by 
the results of a prior clinical trial and an in vitro investigation, no PK drug -drug interactions are 
anticipated in the patient population.

7.3. Subject Withdrawal  
A subject may be discontinue d from the study at any time if the subject, PI (or designee ), or 
sponsor determines that it is not in the best interest of the subject to continue participation. If a 
subject has  an ANC <1.0 ×103 per μL at anytime from Visit 2 to Visit 25 , the PI (or designee) 
should discontinue the subject from participation immediately . 
If a subject withdraws from the study for any reason, any ongoing AEs and/ or a low ANC will be 
followed until resolution, until deem ed stable by the PI , or until the subject is deemed by the PI  
to be lost to follow-up. If, in the opinion of the PI , it is necessary to monitor a subject beyond the 
PPD
Protocol Amendment #3- CZ CONFIDENTIAL  Alkermes, Inc  
13 June 2014 ALK3831-302 
Page 23 safety follow -up visit, the follow-up period may be extended as necessary. In such instances, the 
sponsor and the PI  will agree to an acceptable follow -up schedule. 
In the event that a subject chooses to withdraw from the study, the PI  (or designee ) should make 
a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s) for withdrawal while fully respecting the subject’s 
rights. The subject should complete an ET visit when possible and subjects should be encouraged 
to return for follow-up visits 2 and 4 weeks after the ET visit. If the subject fails or refuses to return to the study center, an attempt must be made to contact the subject by telephone in order to assess as many safety and efficacy parameters as possible. All data collected over the 
telephone must be documented and kept in the subject’s record. 
The PI must maintain a record of all subjects who fail to complete the study. A full explanation 
of the reason for study discontinuation will be made on the appropriate electronic case report 
form (eCRF). If a subject is lost to follow-up, a reasonable attempt to contact the subject must be 
made and documented.  
7.4. Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who withdraw from the study after randomization will not be replaced. 
8. STUDY DESIGN 
8.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
It is not unusual for prescribing physicians to consider a change in a patient’s antipsychotic 
medication  (see Section  5.3). Reasons for considering a change often include insufficient control 
of symptoms and/or tolerability issues. In some cases, patients who are apparently adequately 
controlled may wish to change therapies in hopes of even better control or fewer side effects. 
This study will include subjects who have a diagnosis of schizophrenia who have not been 
exposed to olanzapine, clozapine, mesoridazine, chlorpromazine, or thioridazine for more than one week  within the past year or at any time in the 3 months prior to screening.  
This is a Phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter study, which will be conducted in two parts: Part A and Part B. Part A will begin with screening and will include a 1 -week 
olanzapine lead -in period followed by a 12-week double-blind, placebo- controlled treatment 
period where subjects will receive samidorphan or placebo (in addition to the olanzapine prescribed on Study Day 1). Part B will include an additional 12- week treatment period where all 
subjects will receive active olanzapine + samidorphan (ie, ALKS 3831). At the end of Part B, 
samidorphan dosing will stop, but olanzapine dosing will continue uninterrupted through the 4-
week follow-up period, which includes 2 safet y visits.  
This study will use an Independent Data Safety Monitoring board (DSMB) to monitor for 
tolerability of study drug. After at least one week of safety data has been collected for 40 
randomized subjects, the DSMB will review the accumulated safety data for all subjects. After at least one week of safety data has been collected for 150 randomized subjects, the DSMB will 
review the accumulated safety data for all subjects. Complete details of the membership and 
functioning of this board will be availabl e in the DSMB Charter.

Page 24 This is Alkermes’ first study of the co -administration of olanzapine and samidorphan in a 
population of adults with schizophrenia. In addition, this study includes higher doses of 
samidorphan than the 5-mg dose that was used in a prior study (ALK33 -301). Samidorphan has 
been associated with somnolence, and olanzapine has been associated w ith orthostatic 
hypotension. In ALK33-301, there was no apparent additive effect of the co-administration on either of these adverse effects. However , because the current study involves higher doses of 
samidorphan than studied previously, it was desired to take a conservative approach by 
monitoring subjects in an inpatient setting for 2 nights following randomization (Visit 3) and 
transition (Visit 13) . 
During clinic visits, assessments of psychotic symptoms using measures such as the PANSS and 
CGI-S will occur. Body weight will be measured using consistent methods at every visit. 
Alcohol and drug use will be monitored throughout the study. Concentrations of samidorphan, RDC -9986 (primary metabolite of samidorphan), and olanzapine will be determined in plasma 
samples collected at Visits 2 -23. 
8.1.1. Part A (Screening, Olanzapine Lead -In, and Double -Blind Placebo -Controlled 
Treatment Period)  
Screening assessment s will occur in the 30-day period before subjects report to the clinic for 
verification of eligibility and initiation of olanzapine treatment (Study Day 1). On Study Day 1 (Visit 2), all eligible subjects will be initiated on olanzapine. Olanzapine dose will be selected 
and titrated by the PI based upon individual subject needs and consistent with current clinical 
practice. Subjects will return one week later (ie, Study Day 8, Visit 3) for a 2- night inpatient stay 
and the start of the 12-week double-blind placebo -controlled treatment period. At this visit, 
subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive samidorphan (5 mg, 10 mg, or 20 mg) or 
placebo. Olanzapine dosing will continue uninterrupted. Thus, the Part A treatment groups will be as follows: 
• Olanzapine + Samidorphan (5 mg) • Olanzapine + Samidorphan (20 mg) 
• Olanzapine + Samidorphan (10 mg)  • Olanzapine + Placebo  
All study drug will be taken once daily, by mouth, at the same time. Subjects will be encouraged 
to take study drug in the evening or at bedtime. Study drug administration may be adjusted to 
accommodate study procedures. Randomization will be stratified by the amount of weight 
change during the olanzapine lead -in period (ie, from Day 1 to Day 8), with subjects grouped 
into the following 3 strata:  
• Weight change ≤0 kg • Weight increase >0 to <1 kg • Weight increase ≥1 kg 
This stratification will be used for analyses of secondary endpoints as specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) . 
Subjects will be discharged from the clinic on Study Day 10 (Visit 5), and will return on Study Day 15 (Visit 6). 
Subjects are not required to be taking any antipsychotic medication at the time of screening or 
Visit 2. However, those who are will be tapered off of their prior antipsychotic medication within 
2 weeks af ter initiation (ie, by Study Day 15, Visit 6). This cross -taper from prior antipsychotic 
Protocol Amendment #3- CZ CONFIDENTIAL  Alkermes, Inc  
13 June 2014 ALK3831-302 
Page 25 treatment to olanzapine will be conducted under the care and discretion of the PI  and consistent 
with current clinical practice.  
After Study Day 15 subjects will retur n to the clinic weekly through the first month of double-
blind treatment (ie, Study Day 36) and then every 2 weeks thereafter for the remainder of Part A. 
Any subject who prematurely discontinues during Part A will be asked to return to the clinic 
immediately for an ET visit and after 2 and 4 weeks for follow-up visits. 
Assessments prior to study -drug administration at Visit 13 (the transition visit) will serve as end 
of Part A assessments; dosing and post- dose assessments will be considered Part B assessme nts. 
8.1.2. Part B (Active ALKS  3831 Treatment and Safety Follow- up Periods)  
After completion of Part A (ie, at Visit 13), subjects will transition into Part B and will continue 
onto a 12- week active treatment period during which all subjects will receive ALKS 38 31 (ie, 
olanzapine + samidorphan). Subjects who had been receiving ALKS 3831 during the double-
blind period will continue on the same dose for the 12- week active treatment period. Subjects 
who had been receiving olanzapine + placebo in the double-blind period will continue on the 
same dose of olanzapine and will be transitioned from placebo to samidorphan (at the highest 
dose). 
At Visit 13 (Study Day 92), subjects will be admitted for a 2 -night inpatient stay to allow for 
monitoring following initiation of samidorphan dose in subjects originally assigned to the 
olanzapine + placebo group. Because treatment assignments in the double-blind period must 
remain blind until all subjects have completed Part A or been discontinued from the study, the inpatient stay is required for all subjects. After discharge (Study Day 94), subjects will return 
5 days later for Visit 16 (Study Day 99). After Visit 16, subjects will be seen weekly for the next 3 weeks (Visits 17-19) and then at 2-week intervals for the remainder of the study (Visits 20 -25). 
The subject will take the final samidorphan dose the night before Visit 23 (Study Day 176) . No 
samidorphan dose will be administered onsite during Visit 23. Olanzapine dosing will continue uninterrupted. Two safety follow-up visits will occur 2 and 4 weeks after Visit 23. Any subject who prematurely discontinues from the study during Part B will be asked to return to the clinic 
for an ET visit and follow-up visits 2 and 4 weeks after the ET visit. 
8.2. Schedule of Visits and Assessments  
The schedule of visits and assessments for Part A is shown in Table 1. The schedule of visits and 
assessments for Part B is shown in Table 2. 
Because fasting glucose and ins ulin levels will be measured at some visits, subjects will be 
instructed not to eat or drink for 8 hours before these visits: Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 13, and Visit 23/ET (see Table 1 and Table 2). Random glucose and insulin levels will be measured at visits 
where glucose and insulin measurements are indicated, but fasting is not required. 
For a missed visit, the site should attempt to contact the subject to reschedule.  
Prematu re discontinuation procedures are provided in Section 7.3.

Page 33 8.3. Study Procedures Descriptions  
Details of the study procedures are described below.  
8.3.1. Informed Consent  
The nature of the study and its risks and benefits will be explained to the subject (and caregiver 
as required ) by the PI or designee as described in the site-specific ICF approved by the 
overseeing Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) (see 
Section  17.3).  
8.3.2. Demographics, Medical and Psychiatric History 
Demographic data and medical/p sychiatric history will be reviewed and documented according 
to the schedule shown in Table 1. 
8.3.3. Drug Testing  
A urine drug test for prohibited substances, including benzodiazepines, opioids, amphetamine/ 
methamphetamine, and cocaine , will be performed at the time points specified in Table 1 and 
Table 2. 
8.3.4. Timeline Follow -Back  
Alcohol use will be recorded using the Timeline Follow- Back (TLFB ) method [ Sobell and 
Sobell 1992] at the time points specified in Table 1 and Table 2. At each visit where TLFB is to 
be performed, alcohol use data will be collected for the prior 30-day period. 8.3.5. Concomitant Medication Review  
Concomitant medications will be reviewed at every  visit. The medications include prescription 
and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and supplements. 
Study staff will record the following data on all medications used by the subject: name, dose, 
regimen, route of administration, start and stop dates, and the indication for use. 
8.3.6. Vital Signs  
Vital signs (ie, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oral body temperature) will be 
assessed at every visit. Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured after the subject has been resting in a seated  or supine position for at least 5 minutes. 
An effort will be made to consistently use the same arm (preferably the subject's dominant arm) to measure blood pressure and heart rate throughout the study. The blood pressure cuff will be calibrated per study site standard operating procedures (SOP). Automated measurement is 
preferred, but if performed manually, heart rate will be measured in the brachial artery for at least 30 seconds. 
Protocol Amendment #3- CZ CONFIDENTIAL   Alkermes, Inc  
13 June 2014 ALK3831-302 
Page 34 Orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate will be measured according to the schedule shown in 
Table 1 and Table 2. Orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate will be collected in the following 
manner:  
• Allow subject to be in a supine position for at l east 5 minutes  
• Measure blood pressure and heart rate 
• Have subject stand for 2 minutes 
• Measure blood pressure and heart rate 
For Part A, orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate measurements will be taken anytime pre-dose and approximately 1 hour post-dose at Visits 3 - 6 and Visit 13 only. At all other dosing 
visits, routine vital sign assessments will be conducted anytime pre -dose. At all other visits 
(when no dosing occurs) assessments will be conducted anytime. 
For Part B, orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate measurements will be taken pre -dose and 
approximately 1 hour post-dose at Visits 13 - 16. At all other dosing visits, routine vital sign 
assessments will be conducted anytime pre -dose. At all other visits (when no dosing occurs) 
assessments wil l be conducted anytime.  
8.3.7. Physical Examination, Height 
A physical examination will be performed according to the schedule shown in Table 1 and 
Table 2. 
Height will be measured at Visit 1 only.  
8.3.8. Body Weight and Waist Circumference  
Body weight will be measured 3 times at every visit. The median weight will be calculated by an 
Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) system at Visit 2 and Visit 3 to calculate the change 
in weight duri ng the first week of olanzapine exposure. At Visit 2, as part of the eligibility 
assessment, the PI or designee must ensure that the subject’s body weight has not changed by 
greater than 1  kg. Body weight will also be measured prior to discharge from the i npatient stay.  
Subjects should be asked to void immediately prior to the body weight measurement. Subjects 
should be weighed on the same scale for each measurement under the same conditions. Subjects should remove all personal items, such as watches and jewelry, prior to body weight 
measurement. Subjects should be weighed in hospital gowns with a consistent amount of 
undergarments for each measurement. Subjects will be weighed 3 times. The median weight will be calculated by an IWRS system as described abov e at Visit 2 and Visit 3 and entered into an 
electronic data capture (EDC) system at all other visits.  
Waist circumference will be measured according to the schedule shown in Table 1 and Table 2. 
8.3.9. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG will be conducted according to the schedule shown in Table 1 and Table 2. For 
Part A, ECG will be measured anytime pre -dose and approximately 3 hours post- dose except for 
Visit 1 and Visit 2 where only 1 ECG will be done. For Visit 2, the ECG should be completed 
Protocol Amendment #3- CZ CONFIDENTIAL   Alkermes, Inc  
13 June 2014 ALK3831-302 
Page 35 before dosing. For Visit 6, dosing may be done earlier than normal to accommodate post-dose 
procedures. 
For Part B, ECG will be measured anytime pre -dose and approximately 3 hours post- dose except 
for Visit 23/ET and Visit 24 where no dosing occurs. For Visit 16, dosing may be done earlier 
than normal to accommodate post-dose procedure. 
8.3.10. Adverse Event Monitori ng 
AEs will be monitored continuously from the time a subject signs the informed consent 
document until the completion of the final study visit. AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) are defined in Sections  13.2 and 13.3, respectively. Section  13.5 provides guidance on the 
monitoring and reporting requirements for AEs. Section  13.6 provides guidance on the reporting 
requirements for SAEs.  
8.3.11. Laboratory Assessments 
Blood and urine samples for laboratory assessments will be collected according to the schedule 
shown in Table 1 and Table  2. Overnight fasting (no eating or drinking for 8 hours before the 
visit) will be required for labs at Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 13, and Visit 23/ET. Otherwise, samples 
will be collected in accordance with the site’s usual procedures and analyzed by a central 
laboratory. Follow -up samples may be obtained for repeat testing as clinically indicated. 
Specific hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis assessments are listed in Table 3. Overnight 
fasting is required for some visits because fasting glucose and insulin levels (value and absolute change from baseline) will be measured. Otherwise, random glucose and insulin levels will be 
taken.

8.3.11.1. Specialty Laboratory Assessments 
In addition to the clinical laboratory assessments listed in Table 3, HbA1c, C- reactive protein, 
leptin, and carbohydrate defic ient transferrin ( CDT ) will be assessed at select visits, as indicated 
in Table 1 and Table 2. 
A blood sample for pharmacogenetic analyses exploring the relationship between olanzapine-
induced weight gain and genotype will be collected according to the schedule in Table 1. This 
sample will be stored by a third party for up to 10 years after study completion (instructions will be given f or shipping to storage facility). Note: This sample should only be taken if subjects have 
Protocol Amendment #3- CZ CONFIDENTIAL   Alkermes, Inc  
13 June 2014 ALK3831-302 
Page 37 agreed to it by signing a separate DNA consent form (see Section  17.3) . Subjects may be 
enrolled in the study without consenting to this procedure, in which case it should not be done. 
8.3.11.2. Pregnancy Screening  
A pregnancy test will be performed on all women according to the schedule in Table 1 and 
Table 2. At screening, a serum pregnancy test will be performed. A urine pregnancy test will be 
performed at all other scheduled time points. A positive result at any time will necessitate the 
subject’s withdrawal from the study.  
8.3.12. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Samidorphan, RDC-9986 (primary metabolite of samidorphan), and olanzapine concentrations 
will be determined from plasma samples collected according to the schedule in Table 1 and 
Table 2. The time of last study drug administration and the associated PK blood draw must both be recorded in each subject’s appropriate source documents. PK samples will be stored at -20°C ± 10°C. 
Pharmacokinetic data may be used to assess compliance with study drug administration and/or 
included in a subsequent population PK analysis conducted outside of this study. 
8.3.13. Clinical Global Impressions -Severity  
The PI or designee will complete the CGI -S (Appendix A ) scale at the time points shown in 
Table 1 and Table 2. 8.3.14. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The PI or designee will complete the C -SSRS ( Appendix B ) according to the schedule in Table 1 
and Table 2. At Screening, the “Baseline” version will be administered, and at all other visits, the

Page 38 8.3.19. Audio Recording  
The screening interview and administration of assessments may be recorded using an audio 
digital pen. A third party may review these recordings for quality assurance and confirmation of 
subject eligibility.  
8.3.20. Olanzapine Administration  
Subjects will receive olanzapine for once daily administration  according to the schedule in 
Table 1 and Table 2. The dose will be at the discretion of the PI . 
Initiation on olanzapine, including transition from another antipsychotic (as applicable), is a 
highly individualized process. Forma lizing the potential clinical scenarios may pose undue 
burden and/or risk to subjects. Clinical judgment is essential, and for this reason, the details of 
this process are left to the discretion of the treating physician, who will follow current clinical 
practice.  
8.3.21. Randomization 
After confirming eligibility on Visit 3, and after a 1 -week olanzapine lead -in period, subjects will 
be randomized as outlined in Section  9.3. 
8.3.22. Drug Dispensation and Reconciliation 
Section  9 provides information related to drug dispensing procedures. The study drug use and 
storage information will be explained to/reviewed with the subject.  
Study drugs include samidorphan and matching placebo tablets, and olanzapine tablets, all for oral administration. Samidorphan is a Schedule II substance, and should be stored, dispensed, and otherwise handled in accordance with the associated regulations.  
Olanzapine will be prescribed by the PI and dispensed for oral administration  by study staff . 
During the inpatient stays, study drug will be dispensed once daily, and the time of 
administration will be at the discretion of study staff. Time of administration at any visit 
(inpatient or outpatient) may be adjusted as needed to accommodate post- dose measurements . 
Before being discharged from each inpatient stay, and at each post -randomization outpatient visit 
until Visit 23/ET, all subjects will receive blister cards containing samidorphan or placebo for 
self administration. Subjects will be instructed to take 2  tablets per day from the blister card in 
addition to their olanzapine tablet(s) once daily in the evening or at bedtime until Visit 23. The 
subject will take the final samidorphan dose the night before Visit 23. No samidorphan dose will 
be administered onsite during Visit 23. Olanzapine dosing will continue uninterrupted. Two 
safety follow -up visits will occur 2 and 4 weeks after Visit 23. Any subject who prematurely 
discontinues from the study during Part B wil l be asked to return to the clinic for an ET visit and 
follow-up visits 2 and 4 weeks after the ET visit. 
Subjects will be instructed to keep all unused tablets in their blister card and not to mix tablets 
between blister cards and bottles.  
Subjects will b e instructed to return the original containers and any remaining study drug at each 
subsequent visit. Study drug accountability will be documented as the number of tablets 
Protocol Amendment #3- CZ CONFIDENTIAL   Alkermes, Inc  
13 June 2014 ALK3831-302 
Page 39 dispensed, dosed, lost/missing, or remaining. If applicable, the site will discuss noncompliance 
with the subject.  
8.3.23. Emergency Treatment Card  
An emergency treatment card will be distributed to each subject prior to discharge at Visit 5. The card will indicate that the subject may be receiving an opioid antagonist and/or olanzapine and will include the PI ’s contact information, a suggested pain management plan, and information 
regarding opiate blockade. Subjects will be instructed to keep the emergency treatment card with them at all times. Study personnel will confirm that the subjects have the card in their possession 
at each study visit. The treatment cards will be collected at Visit 23/ET.  
8.3.24. Clinical Validation Inventory for Study Admission 
The PI or designee will complete the Diagnostic Validation Workbook as part of the Clinical 
Validation  Inventory for Study Admission (C- VISA
™) at Visit 1. This workbook is a structured 
method for assessing and documenting study eligibility based on the criteria given in Section 7. 
8.4. Study Requirements and Restrictions  
8.4.1. Prohibited Medications  
Use or expected use of any of the following medications (including generic equivalents or alternative brand names) within 60 days prior to screening or during the study period is 
prohibited. 
• All prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) agents taken for the purpose of w eight 
reduction, including (but not limited to) the following anti-obesity agents: 
− Prescription drugs such as orlistat (Xenical), sibutramine (Meridia), Belviq 
(lorcaserin); and phentermine (Adipex-P, Ionamin, Pro- Fast SA, Pro -Fast SR, 
Fastin, Oby- Trim, Za ntryl, Teramine, Phentride, Phentercot, Obephen, Oby- cap), 
Qsymia (phentermine and topiramate)  
− Over -the-counter anti-obesity agents (eg, herbal supplements or other alternative 
remedies such as Cortislim, Dexatrim, Acutrim, Orlistat)  
• Systemic steroids administered by oral, intravenous, or intramuscular route 
• Antipsychotic agents including clozapine, mesoridazine, chlorpromazine, or 
thioridazine 
• Zyprexa oral disintegrating tablets , Zyprexa Relprevv
™ intramuscular injection (long -
acting), or Zyprexa IntraMuscular injection (short -acting)  
• Topiramate (Topamax®); Calcitonin (eg, Miacalcin®), Exenatide (Byetta®); 
Sulfonylureas (eg, Diamicron®, Amaryl®, Glucotrol®, Micronase®); Meglitinides (eg, 
Starlix®, Prandin®); Metformin or any hypoglycemic agent  
Use of opioid agonists (eg, codeine, oxycodone, tramadol, or morphine) within 14 days before 
screening is prohibited. Use of opioid antagonists, including naltrexone (any formulations) and 
Protocol Amendment #3- CZ CONFIDENTIAL   Alkermes, Inc  
13 June 2014 ALK3831-302 
Page 40 naloxone within 60 days before screening through the follow-up visit is prohibited. Note: during 
the study period, opioid agonists should be avoided (refer to Section  8.4.4).  
Use of hypnotic agents for insomnia (eg, benzodiazepines, zolpidem, trazodone) is permissible. Short half-life benzodiazepines are preferable for the treatment of insomnia over long half- life 
benzodiazepines due to the potential for lingering effects on daytime functioning and study 
assessments.  
Treatment of ag itation and/or anxiety with benzodiazepines is permissible, but the dose should 
be kept as stable as possible throughout the study so as not to interfere with daytime functioning and study assessments. Special care should be taken with dosing of benzodiazepines on study 
visit days so as not to influence efficacy ratings (eg, PANSS); doses of benzodiazepines should be withheld if scheduled to be taken within several hours of a PANSS rating. 
Use of moderate to strong inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (prescription 
medications, OTC medications, or dietary supplements) within 30 days before randomization through follow-up is prohibited. A partial list of CYP 3A4 modulators is provided in Appendix G . 
Medications that are contraindicated with olanzapine use or exhibit drug- interaction potential 
with olanzapine will be defined and prohibited at the discretion of the PI . 
See Section  8.3.5 for details regarding the  concomitant medication review . 
8.4.2. Contraception  
All subjects must agree to use an acceptable method of contraception for the duration of the study. Subjects who are abstinent must agree to use an acceptable contraceptive method should they become sexually active. The following are considered acceptable methods:  
• Condom (barrier method) plus 
− Intrauterine device (IUD)  
or 
− Hormonal contraceptive (such as birth control pills or patches, a vaginal ring, or a 
contraceptive implant)  
Sexually active male subjects must agree use a condom in addition to his partner's normal use of 
contraception. 
Exemptions: Subjects who are surgically sterile are exempt from the requirement to use 
contraception. Women who have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilater al 
salpingo-oophorectomy are considered surgically sterile. Men who have undergone a vasectomy 
are considered surgically sterile. In addition, women who are postmenopausal are also exempt 
from the requirement to use contraception. 
8.4.3. Other Restrictions  
Subjec ts will be instructed to maintain their normal caffeine intake as well as normal 
activity/exercise throughout the study. Subjects are prohibited from participating in a weight 
management program for the duration of the study. 
Protocol Amendment #3- CZ CONFIDENTIAL   Alkermes, Inc  
13 June 2014 ALK3831-302 
Page 41 8.4.4. Pain Management 
Because ALKS  3831 contains samidorphan, a μ-opioid receptor antagonist, patients may 
experience reduced or ineffective analgesia when taking an opioid analgesic agent concurrently 
with ALKS  3831, including several days after last dosing of ALKS 3831. 
In the event of an emergency, pain management of the subject should include the following: 
• Regional analgesia or use of non -opioid analgesics 
• If opiate anesthesia or analgesia is required, the subject should be continuously monitored, in an anesthesia care setting, by persons not involved in the conduct of the 
surgical or diagnostic procedure. The opioid therapy must be provided by individuals 
specifically trained in the use of anesthetic drugs and the management of the 
respiratory effects of potent opioids, specifically the establishment and the maintenance of a patent airway and assisted ventilation.  
• Close monitoring by appropriately trained personnel in a setting equipped and staffed 
for cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
For subjects requiring emergency opioid analgesics prior to dosing, the study drug should not be 
administered. If opioid analgesics are required after the study drug has been dosed, it may take 
several days for opiate sensitivity to be restored, since samidorphan is an opioid antagonist and 
could interfere with opioid- mediated pain management.

Page 42 9. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
9.1. Study Drug Dose and Administration  
Study drugs include samidorphan and matching placebo tablets, and olanzapine tablets, all for 
oral administration. Samidorphan is a Schedule II substance, and should be stored, dispensed, and otherwise handled in accordance with the associated regulations . 
Olanzapine will be prescribed by the PI and will be dispensed for oral administration by study 
staff. 
During the inpatient stays, study drug will be dispensed once daily, and the time of 
administration will be at the discretion of the clinic staff. Time of administration at any visit (inpatient or outpatient) may be adjusted as needed to accommodate post- dose measurements. 
Before being discharged from each inpatient s tay, and at each outpatient post-randomization 
study visit until Visit 23/ET, all subjects will receive blister cards containing samidorphan or placebo for self administration. Subjects will be instructed to take 2  tablets per day from the 
blister card and  their olanzapine tablet(s) once daily in the evening or at bedtime until Visit 23. 
The subject will take the final samidorphan dose the night before Visit 23. No samidorphan dose will be administered onsite during Visit 23/ET. Olanzapine dosing will continue uninterrupted. Two safety follow-up visits will occur 2 and 4 weeks after Visit 23. Any subject who 
prematurely discontinues from the study during Part B will be asked to return to the clinic for an 
ET visit and follow-up visits 2 and 4 weeks after the ET visit.  
Subjects should take all study drug tablets (olanzapine and samidorphan/placebo) orally and at 
the same time. Subjects should be advised that somnolence may occur with dosing and thus they 
should avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until they have determined how the study 
drug affects them.  
Subjects will be instructed to keep all unused tablets in their blister card and not to mix tablets between blister cards and bottles.  Subjects will also be instructed to return unused tablets to the 
site when they return for their next visit. If dosing occurs at this visit, the dose should be taken 
from subjects’ next blister card. The dose should not be taken from the blister card the subjects are returning. 
If a dose is missed or forgotten, subjects will be instructed to resume the regular dosing schedule 
the following evening. Subjects will be instructed not to take a double dose to try to “make up” 
for a missed dose. 
9.2. Treatment Compliance  
As described in Section 8.3.22, study personnel will assess treatment compliance at every visit 
from first dose of study drug at Visit 2 through Visit 23/ET accounting for the dispensed tablets 
(samidorphan, olanzapine, and placebo accounting for dosed, lost/missing, or rema ining tablets). 
Additional measures of compliance may be used; these will be described in the Operational Plan 
as necessary. Study drug accountability will be performed using an EDC system. Subjects who 
have demonstrated compliance during the first week of olanzapine study will be randomized to double-blind treatment (samidorphan or placebo). 
Protocol Amendment #3- CZ CONFIDENTIAL   Alkermes, Inc  
13 June 2014 ALK3831-302 
Page 43 Noncompliance will be discussed with the subject as needed. 
9.3. Randomization and Blinding  
Part A of this study will be conducted in a double-blind fashion. On Day 8 (Visi t 3), subjects will 
be randomized to receive one of the following regimens in a 1:1:1:1 ratio: 
• Olanzapine + Samidorphan (5 mg) 
• Olanzapine + Samidorphan (10 mg)  
• Olanzapine + Samidorphan (20 mg)   
• Olanzapine + Placebo  
Randomization will be performed centrally  through an IWRS system and will be stratified by the 
amount of weight change during the olanzapine lead-in period (ie, from Day 1 to Day 8), with 
subjects grouped into the following 3 strata: 
• Weight change ≤0 kg 
• Weight increase >0 to <1 kg 
• Weight increase ≥1 kg 
Alkermes staff, clinical staff, and subjects will remain blinded to treatment assignment until Part A of the study is complete. All  staff will remain blinded except when their 
study function requires unblinding (eg, drug supply management, IWRS operation, DSMB 
operation, etc). These unblinded staff will follow procedures designed to ensure that study 
integrity is maintained.  
9.4. Breaking Study Blind  
The PI is responsible for all trial- related medical decisions. Emergency unblinding may b e done 
without contacting a medical monitor. Any premature unblinding should be promptly 
documented and explained to the medical monitor within 24 hours following disclosure of study drug assignment. Breaking the blind for a single subject will not affect the blind for the 
remaining subjects.  
Once Part A of the study is complete (ie, the final subject has completed the final Part A 
assessment), the Part A data will be locked, unblinded, and the Part A data analyses will be 
conducted. This may occur prior to the completion of Part B of the study; however individual 
treatment assignments will remain blinded to the sites.

Page 44 10. STUDY DRUG MATERIALS  AND MANAGEMENT  
10.1. Study Drug  
Commercially available olanzapine will be supplied or arranged for dispensing by the 
investigative site.  
Samidorphan will be provided by the sponsor. Each tablet contains 2.5, 5, or 10 mg. Subjects 
will take 2 tablets per day (ie, doses of samidorphan will be 5, 10, or 20 mg) by mouth. 
Samidorphan is a Schedule II substance and will require proper handling, storage, and 
accountability in accordance with local, regulations, and operating procedures. 
Placebo consists of tablets, identical in size and appearance to the samidorphan tablets. Subjects 
will take 2 tablets per day by mouth.  
10.2. Packaging and Labeling  
Samidorphan and placebo will be packaged in blister packs. Blister packs will be provided in 
weekly or biweekly configurations. The weekly blister pack will contain 18 tablets, which 
provides one week of dosing with sufficient overage to allow for 2 additional once daily doses. 
The biweekly packs will contain 32 tablets, providing 2 weeks of dosing with sufficient overage 
to allow for 2 additional once daily doses. 
Blister pack labels will meet all applicable local and regulatory requirements.  
10.3. Storag e 
Under the US Controlled Substances Act, samidorphan is considered a Schedule II substance 
because it is  derived from opium alkaloids. Therefore, samidorphan and/or blinded study drug 
must be stored in accordance with restrictions related to Schedule II substances. The site will 
take adequate precautions, including storage of the investigational drug in a securely locked, 
substantially constructed cabinet, or other securely locked, substantially constructed enclosure, 
access to which is limited, to prevent theft or diversion of the substance. 
10.4. Accountability  
The clinical site is required to maintain current drug dispensation and accountability logs 
throughout the study. All unused supplies will be checked against the drug movement records 
during the study and/or at the end of the study. 
Refer to Section 9 for additional study drug reconciliation procedures. 
10.5. Handling and Disposal  
Following completion and verification of accountability logs, all unused and used packages must 
be destroyed in accordance with regulations for controlled substances. Study drug destruction 
will occur only at the end of the trial and upon notification/approval by the sponsor. Packages 
may be destroyed on site according to Good Clinical Practi ce (GCP) , site procedures and in 
accordance with all regulations for controlled substances. Alternatively, the sponsor may arrange 
Protocol Amendment #3- CZ CONFIDENTIAL   Alkermes, Inc

Page 48 13. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
Safety will be assessed from randomization to the end of Part A. Part B data will be used to 
examine longer- term safe ty. The number and percentage of subjects with AEs from 
randomization to the end of Part A is included as a secondary endpoint. In addition to this secondary  endpoint, safety will be evaluated based on AEs, vital signs, clinical laboratory 
assessments (hem atology, blood clinical biochemistry, and urinalysis), 12-lead ECG findings, 
and data from C- SSRS surveys.  
13.1. Safety Endpoints  
• Number and percentage of subjects with adverse events from randomization to the 
end of Part A 
• Change in blood lipid concentrations including LDL, HDL, total cholesterol and triglycerides  
• Change in assessments related to glucose regulation including fasting glucose and insulin, fasting glucose to fasting  insulin ratio, HbA1c, c-reactive protein, leptin and 
bicarbonate 
• Change in vital signs including blood pressure 
13.2. Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product. The occurrence, which may or may not have a causal 
relationship with the  investigational treatment, may include any clinical or laboratory change that 
does not commonly occur in that subject and is considered clinically significant. 
Illnesses present prior to the subject signing the main ICF are considered to be pre- existing 
conditions and are documented on the medical history eCRF. Pre-existing conditions that worsen 
during the study are entered on the AE eCRF. 
All out-of- range laboratory values will be deemed as clinically significant or not clinically 
significant by the PI (or designated investigator). Clinically significant values will be considered 
AEs and recorded as such on the eCRFs. 
13.3. Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality that 
meets o ne or more of the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening. The subject is at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurs. This does not include reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.  
Protocol Amendment #3- CZ CONFIDENTIAL   Alkermes, Inc  
13 June 2014 ALK3831-302 
Page 49 • Requi res inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. Hospital 
admission for elective surgery scheduled prior to study entry is not considered an 
SAE.  
• Results in disability/incapacity (eg, a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to 
conduct normal life functions) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. 
At Visits 3 and 13, subjects are admitted for a 2- night inpatient stay at the study site, per the 
protocol. If prolongation of this protocol-required stay is necessary for the management of the 
subject’s schizophrenia without a worsening of the subject’s baseline clinical status or the 
development of new signs or symptoms , and is confirmed as such by the medical monitor, the 
event should be categorized as an AE, not an SAE. 
Admission to an inpatient unit or hospital for a non- medical reason (ie, social -stay admission) 
during the trial is considered an AE, not an SAE. 
13.4. Relationship to Study Drug  
The assessment of study drug relationship to each AE will be reported on the appropriate source 
document (and SAE form, in the event of an SAE) by the PI  (or designated investigator ) 
according to his/her best clinical judgment. The criteria listed in Table 4 should be used to guide 
this assessment. Please note that not all criteria must be present to be indicative of a particular drug relationship. All study drugs are considered “test drugs” for the purposes of the definitions 
listed in the table.  However, relationship and action taken will be separated out in the EDC to 
assess for olanzapine and samidorphan/placebo separately. The PI  (or designated investigator ) 
can attribute relationship to olanzapine, samidorphan/placebo or both.

1 Relationship will be assessed twice: once for olanzapine and once for samidorphan/placebo  
13.4.1. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
PIs or their designees will be required to record additional details for AEs of special interest  
related to abuse liability . These AEs fall into  general categories  including (but not limited to) 
Protocol Amendment #3- CZ CONFIDENTIAL   Alkermes, Inc  
13 June 2014 ALK3831-302 
Page 51 substance- related disorders , euphoria, sedation, s timulation, hallucination s, motor impairment, 
and cognitive impairment. More details on these AEs will be provided outside of this protocol. 
13.5. Monitoring and Recording of Adverse Events  
AE data collection will begin after a subject signs the main ICF and will continue until 
completion of the safety follow-up visit. Any AE or SAE having an onset a fter the safety 
follow- up visit will not be collected or reported unless the PI (or designated investigator ) feels 
that the event may be related to the study drug.  
Subjects will be instructed by the PI (or designee ) to report the occurrence of any AE. All 
volunteered, elicited, and observed AEs are to be recorded on the AE eCRFs. 
The PI (or designated investigator) will assess all AEs regarding any causal relationship to the 
study drug (see Section  13.4), the intensity (severity) of the event, action taken, and subject 
outcome. The following criteria should be used to guide the assessment of intensity (severity): 
• Mild:  Causes awareness of sign or symptom, but is easily tolerated; does not interfere 
with usual activities  
• Moderate:  Causes discomfort enough to interfere with usual activities  
• Severe:  Is incapacitating; results in inability to work or perform usual activities  
All AEs will be followed until resolution, until deemed stable by the PI, or until the subject i s 
deemed by the PI to be lost to follow -up. 
For clinical study safety reporting purposes, the most recent version of the IB will be used as the 
reference document to designate event expectedness.  
Withdrawal from the study as a result of an AE and any thera peutic measures that are taken shall 
be at the discretion of the PI  (or designated investigator). If a subject withdraws from the study 
for any reason
13.6. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  , any ongoing AEs will be followed until resolution, until deemed stable by the PI , 
or until the subject i s deemed by the PI to be lost to follow-up. 
All SAEs must be reported to  within 24 hours of discovery, by faxing the 
report to the following: 
Attention:  Medical Monitor  
US Fax Number :  
EU Fax Number:  
The written report should be submitted on the SAE form provided for this purpose. The report 
must include the PI ’s (or designated investigator ’s) opinion as to whether the event is study drug-
related. If this  relationship is determined to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to study 
drug, evidence to support this assessment must also be provided. This assessment will be done twice: once for olanzapine and once for samidorphan/placebo. The report submi tted will include 
both assessments.

Page 52 14. STATISTICS  
14.1. Sample Size Considerations  
Sample size calculations are based on the primary endpoint of absolute change in PANSS total 
score. These calculations assume an equivalence margin of 10 points, a standard deviation of 20 points, and a true difference of 0 points. With these assumptions, 280 randomized subjects 
provide 95% power to demonstrate equivalence on the primary endpoint (absolute PANSS total 
score change from randomization to the end of Part A) with a 2-side d test at an alpha level of 
0.05. These 280 subjects represent 70 subjects for each treatment arm (ALKS 3831 5 mg, 
ALKS  3831 10 mg, ALKS 3831 20 mg, and placebo) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. For the primary analysis, 
subjects in the 3 ALKS 3831 treatment groups will be pooled for comparison with placebo. If 
this analysis shows equivalence, follow-up analyses on individual dose levels will be performed. 
Assuming a 20% discontinuation rate prior to randomization, an estimated 350 subjects will be 
enrolled in this stud y. 
14.2. General Statistical Methodology  
The statistical analysis methods are described below. Additional details will be provided in the 
statistical analysis plan to be finalized before database lock and unblinding. In general, summary 
statistics, including n, mean with (SD), median, minimum, and maximum for continuous 
variables and number (%) of subjects in each category for categorical variables will be provided 
by treatment group for all variables.  
Source data for the summary tables and statistical analyses will be presented as subject data 
listings.  
All statistical tests and CIs, unless stated otherwise, will be 2 -sided and will be set at α = 0.05.  
14.2.1. Efficacy Population 
The efficacy analysis will be conducted on 2 analysis populations: 
• The FAS 1 population will include all subjects who are randomized, r eceive at least 
one dose of study drug, and have at least one post- baseline PANSS assessment.  
• The FAS 2 population will include all FAS 1 subjects who gained weight during the 
initial week of olanzapine treatment prior to randomization  and have at least one 
post- baseline weight assessment.  
14.2.2. Safety Population 
The safety population, defined as all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study 
drug (olanzapine, samidorphan, or placebo), will be used in the safety analyses. 
14.3. Demographics and Baseline D ata 
Demographics and baseline characteristics such as gender, age, race, ethnicity, weight, BMI will 
be summarized with descriptive statistics to assess the comparability of the study groups.

Page 53 If there are heterogeneities between treatment groups in any of the subject characteristics that are 
of clinical importance or could affect the treatment outcome, the impact of the imbalances will 
be investigated and, if necessary, appropriate adjustments will be considered in the efficacy and 
safety analyses.  
Medical history will be summarized for the safety population using the number of observations 
and percentage of subjects by body system. 
14.4. Efficacy Analyses  
The primary endpoint is the absolute change in PANSS total score from randomization to the end of Part A (ie,  the end of the 12-week, placebo-controlled double-blind treatment period) and will 
be evaluated by treatment group (ALKS 3831 vs. the placebo group [olanzapine alone]) using a 2-sided mixed -model for repeated measures (MMRM) to test for equivalence at an alpha level of 
0.05. The primary analysis will be conducted in the FAS 1 population. More details about this 
analysis will be provided in the SAP . 
The secondary endpoint, percent change in weight from randomization to the end of Part A, will 
be evaluated b y treatment group using an MMRM approach similar to that of the primary 
endpoint. However, this will be a superiority analysis. Each treatment group will be compared to the placebo group with a 2- sided hypothesis test to test for superiority at an alpha le vel of 0.05. 
The secondary efficacy analysis will also be conducted in the FAS 1 population. More details 
about this analysis will be provided in the SAP. 
Analysis of other secondary endpoints and additional endpoints will include inferential analyses 
and descriptive analyses by visit (mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous 
variables and number and percent  for categorical variables), as appropriate.  
Analyses for the primary and secondary endpoints will be repeated in the FAS 2 population as sensitivity analyses when applicable. Additional details regarding these analyses will be provided 
in the SAP. 
14.5. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
For all subjects, plasma samples will be collected on Visits 2 -23 to quantify the concentrations of 
olanzapine, samidorphan, and RDC-9986 (primary metabolite of samidorphan). Pharmacokinetic data may be used to assess compliance and/or included in subsequent population PK evaluation 
conducted outside of this study. 
14.6. Safety and Tolerability Analyses  
Reported AE terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA©) preferred terms and system organ classes. Descriptive summary statistics will be 
provided for AEs, laboratory tests, and vital signs and will include mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum for continuous variables and number and percent for categorical variables.  
The incidence of AEs, including clinically significant abnormal laboratory tests or ECG values, 
will be summarized for each treatment group and overall, by severity and by relationship to study 
drug. The summary tables will include the number and percent of subjects with AEs overall, by

Page 54 system organ class, and by preferred terms within each system organ class. AEs resulting in 
treatment discontinuation or modification will be identified.  
Laboratory tests will be summarized by visit for the absolute value itself and for change from baseline. Tables showing the shift from baseline will also be presented. 
ECG findings will be summarized by visit. Concomitant medications will be categorized and 
presented using the World Health Organization (WHO) drug Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical 
(ATC) classification system.

SEVERITY (CGI -S) SCALE  
Rating Clinician-rated
Administration time Varies with familiarity with
patient
Main purpose T o provide a global rating of illness
severity, improvement and response to treatmentPopulation Adults
Commentary
Amongst the most widely used of extant brief assessment
tools in psychiatry, the CGI is a 3-item observer-ratedscale that measures illness severity (CGIS), globalimprovement or change (CGIC) and therapeutic response.The illness severity and improvement sections of theinstrument are used more frequently than the therapeuticresponse section in both clinical and research settings. TheEarly Clinical Drug Evaluation Program (ECDEU) ver-sion of the CGI (reproduced here) is the most widely usedformat, and asks that the clinician rate the patient relativeto their past experience with other patients with the samediagnosis, with or without collateral information. Severalalternative versions of the CGI have been developed, how-ever, such as the FDA Clinicians’ Interview-BasedImpression of Change (CIBIC), which uses only informa-tion collected during the interview, not collateral. TheCGI has proved to be a robust measure of efficacy inmany clinical drug trials, and is easy and quick to admin-ister, provided that the clinician knows the patient well. 
Scoring
The CGI is rated on a 7-point scale, with the severity ofillness scale using a range of responses from 1 (normal)through to 7 (amongst the most severely ill patients).CGI-C scores range from 1 (very much improved)through to 7 (very much worse). Treatment responseratings should take account of both therapeutic efficacyand treatment-related adverse events and range from 0(marked improvement and no side-effects) and 4(unchanged or worse and side-effects outweigh the thera-peutic effects). Each component of the CGI is rated sepa-rately; the instrument does not yield a global score.

(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types)  
Lifetime  
Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of a ct. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent 
does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not 
have to be any in
jury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, 
this is consider
ed an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal 
act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g. gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if 
someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt? 
Have you done anyt
hing to harm yourself? 
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died? 
What did you do? 
Did you______ as a way to end your life?  
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____? 
Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____? 
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, 
or get something else to happen)?  (Self-Injurious Behavior without suicidal intent)

Interrupted Attempt:    
When the person is interrupted (by an outside circumstance) from starting the potentially self-injurious act  (if not for th at, actual attempt would have 
occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pills in hand but is stopped from ingesting.  Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. 
Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by someone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, 
even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumping: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around neck 
but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.

(iii) Manifest:  difficulties th at are clearly  visible  to anybody, although they do not substantially  interfere  
with the  person ’s ability  to perform  a role in this area,  taking  into account  his/her  socio-cultural context,  
age, sex  and level of education.  
(iv) Marked:  difficulties co nsiderably  hinder the person  from performing  his/her  role in this area.  the person  is 
still capable  of performing  some  tasks,  although insufficiently  and occasionall y, without professional  or social  
help. If  the person  is helped  by someone,  s/he may qualify  for the previous level of functioning. 
(v) Severe:  difficulties th at make  the person  unable to perform  any role in this area if not helped  by a 
professional, or  the person  has a destructive  role, howeve r, there  are no survival  risks 
(vi) Very severe:  deterioratio n and extreme  difficulties which  may put the person ’s survival  at risk 
 
Levels of severity: area  d 
(i) Absent

(iii) Manifest:  speaking  too loudly  o r speaking  to others  in a too familiar  manner, or eating  in a socially  
unacceptable way  
(iv) Marked:  insulting  other  peo ple in public,  breaking  or throwing objects,  frequently  behaving  in a 
socially unacceptable  way, but not dangerous way (e.g. undressing  or urinating  in public)  
(v) Severe:  frequent ve rbal threats  or physical  attacks without intention  or possible  serious injurie s 
(vi) Very severe:  frequent aggressive  acts, aimed  to cause  serious injuries  
 
(2) Choose  a 10-point  range.  The 10-point  range  is based  on the level of dysfunction for the 4 main areas:  (a) socially 
useful activities,  including work and study;  (b) personal  and social  relationships;(c)  self-care;  and (d) disturbing  and 
aggressive  behavior.  
 
100-91        Excellent  functioning in all 4 areas.  The person  is held in high consideration  for his/her  good 
qualities, adequately  copes  with life’s problems,  and is involved in a wide range  of interests and 
activities  
90-81          Good  functio ning in all 4 areas,  only has common  problems  or difficulties  
80-71          Mild difficulties  for 1 or more  a-c areas 
70-61          Manifest  but not marked  d ifficulties in 1 or more  a-c areas or mild difficulties in d 
60-51          Marked  difficult ies for 1 or more  a-c areas or manifest  difficulties in d 
50-41          Marked  difficult ies in 2 or more  areas,  or severe difficulties in 1 or more  a-c areas,  with or 
without marked difficulties in d

20-11          Severe  difficul ties in all a-d areas or very severe  difficulties in d with or without 
deterioration  in general a -c areas.  If the person  reacts  to provocative  stimuli,  the suggested rating  is 20-
16; if not, 15-11. 
10-1            Lack of indepen dence for basic functioning, with extreme behaviou r, but with no risk to survival  (6-10) 
or with risk to survival,  e.g. death  risk due to malnutrition,  dehydration, infections,  inability  to recognise 
manifest  dangerous situations  (1-5)

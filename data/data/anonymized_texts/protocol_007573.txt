ABSTRACT  
 
Context :  
Down syndrome  affects 1 per 800 births and is one of the most common causes of 
developmental disability in the U S. Life expectancy for Down syndrome  has increased 
significantly: estimated median survival in t he U S in 1997 was 49 years. Down syndrome is 
associated with an increased risk for obesity, with an estimated prevalence of 47 -48% in 
adults and 30 -50% in children with Down syndrome. Adolescents with Down syndrome are 
more likely to have increased adiposi ty compared to unaffected peers and may be at 
increased risk for obesity -related co -morbidities, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular 
disease.  How one defines obesity in DS is not clear .  Individuals with DS have short stature 
and possibly increased adiposit y, and the body mass index ( BMI ) used to define obesity for 
otherwise healthy population s may not accurately depict body fatness or capture  
cardiometabolic risk in DS . 
 
Objectives :  
Primary: To compare the relationship between BMI -Z score and cardi ometabolic risk  
(CMR)  factors in youth with DS, and in age -, sex -, race -, ethnicity - and BMI -Z score - 
matched controls.  
Secondary: To examine the relationship between obesity, lifestyle (physical activity, 
nutrition), body image, and quality of life in DS , and to explore barriers to maintaining a 
healthy weight in children with DS.  
Study Design :  
Observational c ohort study  
Setting/Participants:  
The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Clinical and Translational Research Center  and 
Children’s National Medica l Center . 
A total of 260 evaluable male and female subjects ages 10-20 years  of any race or ethnic 
background  will be recruited:  155 subjects  with DS  (with and without significant CHD) and  
105 non-DS controls, matched for age, sex, race, ethnicity, an d BMI -Z. Approximately 600 
subjects will need to be screened in order to achieve this number of evaluable subjects.  
Study Measures :  
Anthropometrics (height, weight, BMI), DXA  derived measures (lean  body mass, fat mass) ,  
blood glucose, plasma insulin, oral glucose tolerance  tests (glucose tolerance, insulin  
sensitivity index , insulin resistance (HOMA -IR)),  HbA1c, lipids, non -HDL cholesterol,

PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Study Title  Cardiometabolic risk and obesity in adolescents with Down syndrome  
Funder  National Institutes of Health ( NIH) 
Study R ationale   
DS is associated with an increased risk for obesity . Adolescents with DS are 
more likely to have increased adiposity compared to unaffected peers and may 
be at increased risk for obesity -related co -morbidities, such as type 2 diabetes 
(T2DM)  and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Congenital heart disease (CHD) 
affects approximately 50% of individuals with DS; the NHLBI Working Group 
on Obesity and Other Cardio -vascular Risk Factors in Congenital Heart Disease 
highlighted the high prevalence of obesity in the setting of CHD, and called for 
studies to identify obesity measures that are more sensitive than BMI as well as 
studies of CVD risk prevention . Unfortunately, clinicians caring for obese 
adolescents with DS with or without CHD have little scientific  evidence upon 
which to base guidance regarding  cardiometabolic risk  (CMR ): data regarding 
CVD risk and prevalence of pre -diabetes and T2DM in obese adolescents with 
DS are lacking.   
The measure of body fatness  which best predicts CMR in DS is not known. W e 
plan to  compare BMI and other measures of body fatness in healthy controls 
and adolescents with DS to determine which measure s best capture CVD and/or 
T2DM risk .  These data will equip medical providers with the tools to better 
assess risk, initiate prev ention measures, and guide screening in adolescents 
with DS.   
Study Objective( s) 
Part 1:   
 
Primary   
To compare the relationship between BMI -Z score and 
cardiometabolic risk factors in youth with DS, and in age -, sex-, 
race-, ethnicity -, and BMI -Z score -matched controls.  
a) Compare cardiometabolic risk factors [non -HDL cholesterol, 
lipoprotein subclass particles, blood pressure, insulin resistance 
(measured by HOMA -IR), insulin sensitivity index (ISI), glucose 
tolerance, inflammatory markers, and adipokines )] in adolescents with 
DS and in matched controls.  
b) Determine the extent to which adiposity (fat mass by DXA) explains 
this relationship in DS vs. controls.  
c) Assess cardiac end organ injury (pulse wave velocity (PWV) and left 
ventricular mass) in rel ationship to BMI -Z score in adolescents with DS 
and controls. Determine whether BMI -Z or other measures of adiposity 
(skin -fold thickness, waist circumference) better discriminates 
adolescents with DS at increased cardiometabolic risk.  
Hypothesis : DS is as sociated with worse cardiometabolic risk factors for 
a given BMI -Z compared to controls. This difference arises at least in 
part, from increased adiposity.  
    
 
  10/8/2018  ix 
 Secondary  
To examine the relationship between obesity, lifestyle (physical 
activity, nutrition), bo dy image, and quality of life in DS, and to 
explore barriers to maintaining a healthy weight in children with 
DS.  
a) Compare the relationships between BMI -Z, and body image and 
quality of life in adolescents with DS with those of matched controls.  
b) Identify DS -specific barriers (i.e., nutrition, behavioral issues, body 
image, feeding behaviors, parental -and self -imposed activity restrictions) 
to maintaining a healthy lifestyle.  
Hypothesis : Obesity negatively impacts body image and quality of 
life in adol escents with DS.  
Obesity is associated with less physical activity . 
Psychological, behavioral , physical conditions unique to DS impede 
maintenance of healthy lifestyle and weight.

1 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Introduction  
Understanding the role of obesity and body composition in cardiometabolic (CMR) factors in 
Down syndrome (DS).  DS affects 1 per 800 births12 and is o ne of the most common causes of 
developmental disability in the U.S. Life expectancy for DS has increased significantly; 
estimated median survival in the US was 49 years in 199713. DS is associated with an increased 
risk for obesity14, with an estimated pr evalence of 47 -48%15 in adults and 30 -50%16 in children 
with DS. Concurrent with the physiologic increase in insulin resistance that accompanies 
puberty, adolescents with DS are more likely to have increased adiposity compared to 
unaffected peers, and may be at increased risk for obesity -related comorbidities, such as type 2 
diabetes (T2DM)17 and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Moreover, congenital heart disease 
(CHD) affects approximately 50% of individuals with DS5; the NHLBI Working Group on 
Obesity and Ot her Cardio -vascular Risk Factors in Congenital Heart Disease highlighted the 
high prevalence of obesity in the setting of CHD, and called for studies to identify obesity 
measures that are more sensitive than BMI as well as studies of CVD risk prevention.6 
Unfortunately, clinicians caring for obese adolescents with DS with or without CHD have little 
scientific evidence upon which to base guidance regarding CMR: data regarding CVD risk and 
prevalence of pre -diabetes and T2DM in obese adolescents with DS are l acking.  
 
In 1977, DS was proposed to be an atheroma -free model; atheroma was completely absent at 
autopsy in five institutionalized adults with DS, while atheroma was present in institutionalized 
adults without DS18. Individuals with DS were hypothesized to be protected from 
atherosclerotic disease. Subsequent studies both supported19, 20, and contradicted21, 22 this 
conclusion. Group differences in lipid profiles were not found in the original study, but others 
identified a more atherosclerotic lipid prof ile in DS 23-26. Recently, after excluding deaths 
caused by CHD, three large cohort studies reported increased mortality due to CVD in DS 27-29. 
Hill et al28 found a standardized mortality ratio of 6.2 for cardiovascular deaths, with a ratio of 
3.9 for isc hemic heart disease specifically. Mortality due to diabetes mellitus is also increased, 
with a standardized mortality ratio of 11.4  28, however T1DM and T2DM were not 
differentiated. These data suggest increased CVD risk in DS, but the relative contributio ns of 
obesity versus factor(s) intrinsic to DS have yet to be delineated. Increased life expectancy in 
DS demands that we better understand obesity, characterize CMR, and identify the best 
screening measures for this risk, with the goal of minimizing healt h disparities for this at -risk 
population.  This study will examine the association of obesity with CMR in DS during 
adolescence, a critical period marked by pubertal insulin resistance and transition to potential 
independence. Our study has direct implicat ions for daily medical care of individuals with DS. 
The marker which best predicts CMR in DS is not known. We plan to evaluate which measure 
of adiposity best captures CVD and/or T2DM risk in DS to equip medical providers with the 
tools to better assess ri sk, initiate prevention measures, and guide screening in adolescents with 
DS. 
Understanding the relationship of obesity to body image, QOL, and physical activity, and 
explore barriers to healthy weight in adolescents with DS. Childhood obesity may contribu te to 
significant psychosocial complications30. In general, obese children report poorer QOL.31 
Children and adults with DS have low levels of physical activity 32, 33. Children with CHD also 
   
   
  10/8/2018  2 
tend to be less physically active than peers34, 35, and self -concept may limit engagement in 
physical activity;  36 thus, a cycle of poor self -esteem may feed physical inactivity and obesity. 
Among children with DS, factors such as competing family responsibilities, reduced skills; and 
paucity of accessible programs lik ely contribute to low physical activity37. Body image, QOL, 
and physical activity in relation to BMI have not been explored in adolescents with DS. 
Cognitive and physical complications of DS, as well as parental perceptions, can make 
traditional community -based weight loss programs difficult to access and utilize effectively. 
Identification of barriers to obesity prevention and management is crucial if effective programs 
are to be developed. This study will explore body image, QOL, physical activity pattern s, 
eating behaviors, and parental perception of activity risk and tolerance in adolescents with DS, 
both with and without CHD.  
Thus, we will characterize the relationship between obesity and CMR in DS, fill a critical 
knowledge gap regarding CVD and T2DM r isk, and clarify scr eening measures for these risks . 
We will also explore psychosocial implications of increased weight and barriers to healthy 
weight in adolescents with DS, to establish the foundation for future studies addressing these 
important aspects  of ob esity prevention and treatment.  
1.2 Compliance Statement  
This study will be conducted in full accordance with all applicable Children’s Hospital of 
Philadelphia and Children’s National Medical Center Research Policies and Procedures and all 
applicable Fe deral and state laws and regulations including 45 CFR 46. All episode s of 
noncompliance will be documented.  
The investigators will perform the study in accordance with this protocol, will obtain consent 
and assent, and will report unanticipated problems in volving risks to subjects or others  in 
accordance with The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and Children’s National Medical 
Center IRB Policies and Procedures and all federal requirements. Collection, recording, and 
reporting of data will be accurate an d will ensure the privacy, health, and welfare of research 
subjects during and after the study.  
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES

with CMR in adolescents with DS . 
2.1 Primary Aim 1   
The prim ary objective is t o compare the relationship between BMI -Z score and 
cardiometabolic risk factors in youth with DS, and in age -, sex -, race -, ethnicity - and BMI -Z 
score - matched controls.  
a) Compare cardiometabolic risk factors [non -HDL cholesterol, lipop rotein subclass particles, 
blood pressure, insulin resistance (measured by HOMA -IR), insulin sensitivity index (ISI), 
glucose tolerance, inflammatory markers, and adipokines)] in adolescents with DS and in 
matched controls.  
b) Determine the extent to which  adiposity (fat mass by DXA) explains this relationship in DS 
vs. controls.

c) Assess cardiac end organ injury (pulse wave velocity (PWV) and left ventricular mass) in 
relationship to BMI -Z score in adolescents with DS and controls. Determine whether BMI -Z or 
other measures of adiposity (skin -fold thickness, waist circumference) better discriminates 
adolescents with DS at increased cardiometabolic risk.   
2.2 Secondary Aim  
The secondary objective is to examine the relationship between obesity, lifestyle (physic al 
activity, nutrition), body image, and quality of life in DS, and to explore barriers to maintaining 
a healthy weight in children with DS.  
a) Compare the relationships between BMI -Z, and body image and quality of life in 
adolescents with DS with those o f matched controls.  
b) Identify DS -specific barriers (i.e., nutrition, behavioral issues, body image, feeding 
behaviors, parental and self -imposed activity restrictions) to maintaining a healthy lifestyle.  
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 General Schema of Study Desig n 
This observational  cross -sectional study will involve one study visit for all groups. All 
participants will be consented before any procedures. During the study visit both groups will 
receive: urine pregnancy test (for female subjects), fasting blood sa mple , OGTT  (if BMI≥85% 
percentile) , DXA scan, anthropometric measurements, pubertal status exam, PWV and PWA, 
echocardiography, family history of CVD/dyslipidemia/T2DM,  QOL,  body image , eating 
behaviors and other  questionnaires . Three twenty -four hour dietary recal l interviews of parents 
and children will be conducted by research bionutritionists  by telephone, using the multi -pass 
method.   Accelerometers will be distributed for home use.  
 
3.2 Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projected  
3.2.1 Duration of Stu dy Participation  
The study duration for both the DS and control  group will be approximately 5-8 hours for the 
1-day visit. The dietary intake phone interview will be approximately 30 minutes each time, 
totaling approximately 1.5 hour s. SenseWear armbands w ill be worn in the home environment 
for seven consecutive days.  
3.2.2 Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projected  
The study will be conducted at 2 investigative site s in the United States : The CTRC at CHOP  
and the CSR at CNMC . 
Recruitment will  stop when approximately 260 evaluable subjects are enrolled ( 155 DS 
subjects and 105 control subjects).  It is expected that CHOP will enroll 1 30 subjects and 
CNMC will enroll 2 5 subjects into the Down syndrome group, and that CHOP will enroll 80 
subjects and CNMC will enroll 2 5 subjects into the control group. A pproximately 600 subjects 
   
   
  10/8/2018  4 
overall  (450 at CHOP and 150 at CNMC)  will be screened, or “ enrolled ,” to produce 260 
evaluable subjects.  
3.3 Study Population  
3.3.1 Inclusion Criteria  
The study plans to recruit a pproximately equal numbers of females and males, and is open to  
participants regardless of their race or ethnic background. We will not restrict enrollment based 
on gender, race or ethnicity, and will actively recruit members of minority groups. We 
anticip ate that the sample will be predominantly Caucasian and African American with smaller 
numbers of Hispanic and Asian minority groups since these are not well -represented in the 
CHOP  and CNMC  catchment area s.. We anticipate recruiting a number of participant s who 
self-identify as mixed race. Very few families of American Indian/Alaska Native and Native 
Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander groups reside in the Philadelphia area and are not likely to 
be represented in this study.  
In the event that a non -English s peaking participant wishes to enroll in the study, we will use 
the Hospital Interpreter Services to locate an interpreter that can assist the study and the family 
to achieve this goal.  
3.3.2 Inclusion Criteria

2) Diagnosis of DS   
3) Parental/guardian permission (informed consent) a nd if appropriate, child assent  
Control Group  
1) Males and females age 10 to 20 years  
2) Parental/guardian permission (informed consent) and if appropriate, child assent  
3.3.3 Exclusion Criteria

atypical antipsychotics  
Subjects that do not meet all of the enrollment criteria may not be enrolled. Any violations of 
these crit eria must be reported in accordance with IRB Policies and Procedures.

for youth ages 11 -19. This condition -specific  QOL assessment is a 27 ite m 
questionnaire that yields a total score and 4 domain scores, including 
physical comfort , body esteem, social life, and family relations. It has been 
used in children, adolescents, and in special populations.  
 IWQOL -Kids – Parent Form - The Impact of Weigh t on Quality of  Life 
Kids  – Parent Form  (IWQOL -Parents ) is a measure of the parent perception 
of weight -related quality of life. This condition -specific QOL assessment is 
a 27 item questionnaire that yields a total score and 4 domain scores, 
including phys ical comfort, body esteem, social life, and family relations.  
 BES – the Body Esteem Scale for Children is a 20 -item, yes/no 
questionnaire designed to assess children’s attitudes and feelings about their 
body and appearance.  
   
   
  10/8/2018  7 
 FRS  – The Stunkard Figure Rati ng Scale depicts 9 male and 9 female 
figures, ranging in size from very thin to very overweight. It is used to 
assess perceptions of current and ideal body size.  
 ASAQ -   The Adolescent Sedentary Activity Questionnaire is a reliable 
assessment of a compre hensive range of sedentary behaviors that occur in 
school -aged young people. In this measure, the parent will estimate the 
amount of time spent engaging in various sedentary activities during each 
day of a typical school week and weekend.  
 CEBQ – The Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire157 is a reliable and valid, 
35 item questionnaire measuring appetite and eating style (satiety 
responsiveness, food enjoyment, food responsiveness, slowness in eating, 
food fussiness, desire to drink, emotional over -eating and  emotional under -

environment. Families will be mailed the HFI prior to the study appointment 
and will be asked to bring the completed survey to the study appointment.  
 Physical activity/armband diary – Participants will be asked to keep a record 
of the times that they did not wear the physical activity armband and of their 
activities on the days that they wore the armband. The diary packet will be 
sent home with each participant, along with a postage -paid envelope to 
return the diary.  
 
 SenseWear® Armbands (Body Media, Inc. ). Participants will be asked to wear armband 
accelerometers for 7 days, 24 hours per day, for 1 week with the exception of when they 
are bathing/showering or if participating in water activities, such as swimming. 
Information collected will include amount  and intensity of physical activities, sedentary 
activities, and sleep. There are no direct benefits to participants of this assessment, but 
the data gleaned from these assessments will provide valuable information about the 
lifestyle habits of children an d adolescents with Down syndrome.  
 
4.2 Follow -up Phase   
Dietary Intake Assessment: The twenty -four hour dietary recall will be completed by the 
research bionutritionists  in the two to three weeks following the study visit. Three phone calls 
   
   
  10/8/2018  8 
(to gather informa tion on two weekdays, one weekday) will be averaged to complete a single 
report.  
 
4.3 Subject Completion/Withdrawal  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to their care.  They may 
also be discontinued from the study at the discretio n of the i nvestigator s for lack of adherence 
to study treatment or visit schedules, AEs, and/or pregnancy .  The investigator s may also 
withdraw subjects who violate the study plan, or to protect the subject for reasons of safety or 
for administrative reaso ns.  It will be documented whether or not each subject completes the 
clinical study. If the Investigator s become  aware of any serious, related adverse events after the 
subject completes or withdraws from the study, they will be recorded in the source docum ents 
and on the CRF.  
5   STUDY EVALUATIONS AN D MEASUREMENTS  
5.1Screening and Monitoring Evaluations and Measurements  
5.1.1 Physical Examination  
Evaluations obtained during the study visit include Tanner staging of puberty by a pediatric 
endocrinologist .  
5.1.2 Vital Sig ns 
Vital signs will be recorded while the subject is sitting down  by the nursing staff . BP will be 
measured by auscultation three times, after a five minute rest in a quiet area with the subject in 
a seated position; the average of the 2nd and 3rd measurem ents will be used.  
5.1.3 Laboratory Evaluations  
A fasting blood sample will be performed for the following laboratory evaluations. For those 
individuals undergoing the OGTT, this will be done with insertion of the intravenous (IV) line 
before glucose has been in gested. For individuals not requiring an OGTT, the fasting blood 
samples will be obtained by a r outine needle stick. When necessary, commercial kits for the 
individual lab tests will be purchased by the investigators.  Blood sampling will be performed 
for the following laboratory evaluations . 
1. Lipid panel (TG, TC, HDL -C, LDL -C) 
2. Lipoprotein subclass analysis  
3. Blood glucose (BG)  
4. Plasma insulin  
5. High sensitivity C -reactive protein (hs -CRP)  
6. Interleukin 6 (IL -6)  
   
   
  10/8/2018  9 
7. Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor  1 (PAI 1)  
8. Adiponectin  (total and HMW)  & Leptin  
9. TSH and T4  
10. HbA1c  
5.1.4  Glucose Tolerance Test  
Glucose Tolerance (2 -hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)) will be performed by 
nursing staff . Subjects will be told to eat a high  carbohydrate diet for 3 days before the 
study. Topical anesthetic ointment at the phlebotomy sites will be offered the morning of 
the visit. Baseline BG and insulin will be obtained. Subjects will ingest glucose solution 
(1.75 g/kg; maximum of 75 g) over 2 minutes. BG and i nsulin will be drawn at 30, 60, 90, 
and 120 min via a blood -drawing IV. However, the investigators realize that not all subjects 
will tolerate placement of the blood drawing IV, particularly given that children with Down 
syndrome may have developmental del ays. For these subjects, BG and insulin will be 
drawn fasting , subjects will ingest glucose solution as described above, and a second blood 
draw will occur  at 120 minutes. OGTT will be interpreted based on American Diabetes 
Association criteria98: Fasting BG: <100 mg/dl= normal, 100 -125mg/dl = impaired fasting 
glucose  (IFG), ≥126 mg/dl = diabetes; 2 -hour BG <140 mg/dL = normal, 140 -199 mg/dL = 
impaired glucose tolerance  (IGT), ≥200 mg/dL = diabetes.  
5.1.5 Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) and Pulse Wave Analysis ( PWA)  
Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) and Pulse Wave Analysis (PWA) will be performed in the by 
a trained professional. . Aortic PWV  measurements are performed in the supine position 
after at least 5 minutes rest using the right carotid and right femoral arteries , with a 
Sphygmocor PVx System (AtCor Medical, West Ryde, Australia) device. PWA  will 
provide novel, supplemental data about central pulse pressure (CPP) in our subjects. The 
same software and equipment as for PWV are used, on the right radial artery. CPP is 
measured using radial artery tonometry.99  
5.1.6  Anthropometry  
Weight measured by digital electronic scale (Scaletronix) and stature on a stadiometer 
(Holtain). Age - and sex -specific Z -scores generated based on CDC 2000 growth charts100 
so that DS and non-DS groups will be compared by the same reference. Body proportions 
and fat distribution measurements (sitting height, a rm,waist  and hip  circumference, and 
skin fold thickness at triceps, biceps, subscapular, and suprailiac sites) will be measured . 
5.1.7  Left Ventricular (LV) Mass  
LV mass will be measured by echocardiography, as described by the American Society of 
Echocardiography’s guidelines101. Per these guidelines the equation of Devereux et al will 
be used102. LV Mass Index (LV mass/height2.7), ha s been used to normalize LV mass to 
body size103. However, this inde x increases with decreasing height, which is not ideal for 
children with DS. Use of centile curves and z -scores104 is another strategy to account for 
   
   
  10/8/2018  10 
lean mass (LM), which may also be diff erent in children with DS. We will measure LM by 
DXA and can thus normalize LV mass directly.  
5.1.7.1 Pregnancy Testing  
A urine pregnancy test will be performed for female subjects .  A positive pregnancy result will 
be disclosed to the participant only. Pregnancy results will be disclosed to the parent/guardian 
if the subject gives the investigators permission. Subjects found to be pregnant during the visit 
will not be able to enroll in this study. The investigators will counsel the subject and guide 
them to  seek the appropriate care.  
5.1.8 Safety Evaluation  
The study investigators will be responsible for safety monitoring. A routine needle stick or an 
IV line used for drawing blood may cause some discomfort (topical anesthetic cream will be 
available), bruising, a nd rarely fainting. Use of the anesthetic cream may cause an allergic 
reaction.  Although high adiposity is possible in participants with BMI<85%ile and might 
contribute to abnormal glucose tolerance, we will limit the subjects undergoing OGTT 1) to 
minimiz e participant burden in this cohort of children with developmental disabilities, and 2) 
on the likelihood of finding cardiometabolic abnormalities. We confined our IR assessment to 
HOMA -IR rather than IVGTT or clamp studies --considered the gold standard fo r IR 
assessment -- in the spirit of sensitivity to these children with intellectual disabilities and their 
families. We will obtain interim time points within the OGTT to calculate ISI, a measure of 
whole body insulin sensitivity. This requires a minimum of  5 time points, necessitating the 
placement of a blood -drawing IV. Given the children’s developmental disabilities, some 
children may not tolerate this procedure —in this subset only time points 0 and 120 will be 
drawn and ISI omitted from their analyses.  
Participants will be fasting 12 hours prior to their study visit. This may cause hunger pangs, 
upset stomach, headache, or light -headedness. If the participant shows any signs of clinical 
instability or definitively decides to discontinue participation, th e study visit will be ended. 
Possible side effects of the OGTT include temporary high or low blood sugar. A risk of the 
OGTT includes an upset stomach. Participants will be monitored by a nurse or doctor during 
the study procedures. Episodes of low blood g lucose will be treated with oral or IV glucose 
when indicated.  
During the study visit, if a participant is found to have any previously unknown medical 
conditions, they will be referred to their pediatrician for care.  
This protocol also involves exposure t o radiation from the DXA scans. However, this involves 
a very small radiation exposure, which is unlikely to cause any untoward effects to the 
participant. Being that the protocol may be unsafe to an unborn child, preg nancy  is an 
exclusion criterion of the  study.   
The noninvasive measures of arterial stiffness and central pulse pressure are done via Pulse 
Wave Velocity and Pulse Wave Analysis. This poses little risk to the patient.  
The patient will be notified of any clinically relevant abnormal test resul t(s) performed by 
CLIA certified labs,  by mail and or by phone. Because of batching of samples, there may be a 
   
   
  10/8/2018  11 
significant time delay between the study visit and result notification. It will be recommended 
that results, especially abnormal results, be dis cussed by the guardian with the participant’s 
primary care physician. In the case of study referrals by the primary care provider, the 
investigators may send study results via email, phone, and/or mail to the primary care physician 
directly.  Studies perfor med by non CLIA labs will  not be disclosed.  
Any adverse events will be reported as per the study site policies . 
6   STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
6.1 Data Analysis  
We will screen approximately 200 children with DS to enroll  155 evaluable children with DS. 
Approximately 50% will have CHD , which will be hemodynamically significant in 
approximately 50 -75%.  Subjects with minor, hemodynamically insignificant lesions (such as a 
small PDA) will be grouped with subjects without CHD.  
Primary Aim: The primary aim is t o compare the relationship between BMI -Z and 
cardiometabolic risk factors in youth with DS and matched controls.  This relationship may be 
different in children with DS with and without CHD.  In order to model the analyses 
appropriately, the p rimary outcom e variables will be compared between children with DS with 
and without hemodynamically significant CHD. If the groups differ, subsequent analyses will 
include a dummy variable indicating presence/absence of hemodynamically significant CHD . 
Descriptive data  analysis will summarize distributions of all risk factor measures (age, weight, 
BMI -Z, non -HDL -C, lipid levels, lipoprotein subclass particles, BP, HOMA -IR, ISI, 
inflammatory markers, adipokines, CPP, PWV, LV mass, gender, race, ethnicity, pubertal 
stage,  pre-diabetes and diabetes status, physical activity). Subjects with DS will be compared to 
age-, sex -, race -, and BMI -Z matched controls, first by comparison of risk factor distributions 
by DS status. Next, we will fit separate regression models for each risk factor, with DS as the 
exposure of interest, adjusted for potential confounders, including pubertal stage, family history 
of CVD, dietary fat intake, and smoking history. Interaction terms among confounders will be 
used when data frequencies permit. I nitial regressions will confirm the size and sign of 
associations of subject characteristics and CVD risk factors. Complementary analyses will 
implement propensity scores, using logistic regression to model DS as a function of observed 
covariates, and then  will compare DS and non -DS children for each endpoint using weighted 
analyses. Weights will be calculated by the inverse of the fitted probability of DS106. This 
method will standardize the comparisons of CVD risk factors by differences in observed 
charac teristics of DS and non - DS children and thus will permit statem ents such as ―If a 
sample of children otherwise comparable were alternatively DS and non -DS, what would be 
the differences in CVD risk factors? Finally, we will perform sensitivity analyses as to the 
potential impact on our results from unobserved potentia l confounders. Initial analyses will 
determine whether children with DS differ from their non -DS counterparts in terms of CVD 
risk factors and will become the basis for addressing the questions in the four sub -aims.  
 
 
6.1.1  Aim 1a) BMI -Z scores and DS – CMR factors  
 
   
   
  10/8/2018  12 
To analyze this aim, the statistical model noted above will be modified to include an interaction 
term between DS and BMI -Z score for each CVD risk factor. An important interaction term 
will reflect varying association of BMI -Z by disease stat us. Based on preliminary data we 
estimate 50% of subjects with DS will have BMI≥85%ile and undergo an OGTT. We will 
compare prevalence of IGT or IFG and T2DM between groups. (Although DS is associated 
with increased risk for T1DM, this would most likely pr esent acutely and have already been 
diagnosed if present.)  
 
6.1.2  Aim 1b) DXA -measured FM This sub aim  will make use of the model in Aim 1a. 
Inclusion of FM in explaining CMR factors in the model should offset any statistical 
interaction between BMI -Z and DS status.  
Aim 1c) PWV [and LV Mass] Using the model outlined previously, we will add PWV as an 
indicator of end organ damage to assess additional information provided by PWV, especially 
with regard to the interaction of BMI -Z and CVD risk factor levels . This approach will be used 
for CPP and LV mass as well.  
 
6.1.3  Aim 1d) Discrimination ability of BMI -Z and other screening measures This 
analysis will be confined to children with DS, and will require for each CVD risk factor the 
determination before a nalysis of a threshold of high versus low, in order to evaluate 
discrimination. With BMI -Z, and each risk factor taken individually, we shall estimate the c -
statistic, a measure of discrimination representing the area under the ROC curve of the tradeoff 
of sensitivity and specificity, for each screening measure as a predictor of high vs. low risk. 
Finally, we shall compare the additional discriminatory power of adding one screening measure 
to an existing screening measure, such as WC to BMI -Z to determine w hether an additional 
screen is worth the expense and time. These contrasts will be implemented using the methods 
outlined by Pepe and colleagues122.  
 
6.1.4   Secondary Aim  
Initial data analysis will be descriptive to examine distributions of QOL, body imag e and other 
measures in this AIM.  Models for QOL and body image, with DS and BMI -Z as the exposure 
of interest, adjusted for potential confounders (e.g., sex, ethnicity) will be linear regressions 
and alternatively ordinal regressions depending on the measure distributions . The latter 
regression model assumes only ordered rather than continuous dependent variables. Estimates 
of interest will be the main effects (association of BMI -Z on QOL and body image), and the 
interaction of DS and these factors (does the presence of DS modify associations of interest?).      
 
Stata software (version 11.1 or later; Stata Corp., College Station, Texas), supplemented with 
SAS v 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary NC) and R (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 
Vienna, Austria ) will be used for statistical analysis. Methods outlined by Pepe and colleagues 
are now implemented in Stata v 11.  
6.2    Sample Size and Statistical Power  
Primary Aim: Assuming 15 5 evaluable  children with DS and 1 05 evaluable children without 
DS for anal ysis and conservatively using nonparametric methods for comparison of CVD risk 
factors, power exceeds 0.85 to detect a between -group difference of 0.35 standard deviation 
(SD). For example, non -HDL -C is our primary CMR outcome measure, and 0.35 SD 
   
   
  10/8/2018  13 
correspo nds to a difference of 7 mg/dl. A difference of 10 mg/dl is considered clinically 
relevant by pediatric cardiologists . 
Secondary Aim: Power for the paired design can be assessed by assuming paired comparisons 
of residuals of a regression of BMI -Z on QOL an d body image measures. Assuming that the 
outcomes, and thus residuals, will be  continuous, power = 0.86 to detect as significant as little 
as 0.25 SD in  differences between DS children and controls using nonparametric tests 
(Wilcoxon) that would suitable  for both continuous and ordered data. Thus, the sample should 
have substantial power to demonstrate even small differences between DS and matched 
controls.     
6.3   Potential Problems/Feasibility  
If we find no differences in CMR factors between youth wit h DS and controls, the resulting 
estimates (and confidence bounds) will still generate crucial information, given the literature 
claims of decreased CVD risk in DS, and scarcity of data on T2DM risk. Confidence bounds on 
estimates will allow us to rule out  clinically important differences. We might find that DS 
children are at decreased CVD risk compared to unaffected controls. Such information would 
help guide clinicians caring for children with DS, and prevent unnecessary screening. Although 
high adiposit y is possible in participants with BMI<85%ile and might contribute to abnormal 
glucose tolerance, we will limit the subjects undergoing OGTT 1) to minimize participant 
burden in this cohort of children with developmental disabilities, and 2) on the likelih ood of 
finding cardiometabolic abnormalities. We confined our IR assessment to HOMA -IR rather 
than IVGTT or clamp studies --considered the gold standard for IR assessment -- in the spirit of 
sensitivity to these children with intellectual disabilities and th eir families. We will obtain 
interim time points within the OGTT to calculate ISI, a measure of whole body insulin 
sensitivity. This requires a minimum of 5 time points, necessitating the placement of a blood -
drawing IV. Given the children’s developmental disabilities, some children may not tolerate 
this procedure —in this subset only time points 0 and 120 will be drawn and ISI omitted from 
their analyses. Measures of LV mass may still be confounded by mild valve regurgitation or 
EKG conduction abnormalities . We are aware of this issue, and will interpret de-identified 
results with the expertise of the study cardiologist(s) . They advocate acquiring this data, given 
the cardiometabolic implications of LV mass. The technique has not been used previously in 
this population and will generate novel data.  
 
7 SAFETY MANAGEMENT  
7.1 Clinical Adverse Events  
Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study.  
7.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
The Investigator is responsible for recording and reporting unanticipated pr oblems related to 
research that occur during and after study treatment.   The plan for Adverse Event reporting 
should be consistent with the study site IRB Guidelines. Since the study procedures are not 
greater than minimal risk, SAEs are not expected. If an y unanticipated problems related to the 
research involving risks to subjects or others happen during the course of this study (including 
   
   
  10/8/2018  14 
SAEs) these will be reported to the IRB in accordance with the study site policies . AEs that are 
not serious but that a re notable and could involve risks to subjects will be summarized in 
narrative or other format and submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing review.  
 
7.3 Medical Emergencies (if applicable)  
The investigators do not anticipate any medical emergencies with  this minimal risk study. 
However, there is a possibility that study participants may have low or high blood glucose or 
side effects resulting from the OGTT. The study participants will be monitored throughout 
testing. The study coordinator, a nurse or phy sician will be present during these procedures. If 
necessary, episodes of significant hypoglycemia will be treated immediately with oral or IV 
glucose (although unlikely).  
8 STUDY ADMINISTRATION  
8.1 Data Collection and Management  
Data Management CHOP CTRC Infor matics Core will create case report forms (CRF) and 
REDCap database for data capture. REDCap is an NIH -supported web -based data management 
software designed by Vanderbilt University investigators. Of special benefit to the proposed 
investigation is the int erface between EPIC (the EMR) and the research database that allows for 
use of clinical information for research purposes. For data not already incorporated in EPIC, 
once the investigative team confirms complete and accurate data, it will be entered into 
REDCap. Using REDCap checking tools, the data manager confirms completeness and valid 
values weekly and informs any errors or omissions to the investigative team for prompt 
resolution. Real -time data checking ensures prompt creation of an analysis dataset u pon data 
acquisition completion. Tables generated by REDCap will be exported and merged for use with 
Stata and SAS statistical packages as needed for immediate access to the research team.    
The PI  is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of data c ollection and management. 
The PI may designate qualified individual(s) to collect data and manage data. Only 
investigators and research staff that have completed appropriate IRB training and approval and 
are listed on the IRB approved protocol are eligible  to collect and work on information from 
the study. Future studies that may use patients or data collected from this study must have 
separate approved IRB protocols and consent forms, if applicable.  
Recruitment data will be recorded onto the screening ques tionnaire  after the verbal consent is 
recorded . Original data will be recorded directly onto CRFs by the study coordinator or a study 
investigator. Copies of laboratory, physical exam, anthropometric, DXA, PWV, and PWA  
results will be received through inte r-office mailing, picked up directly, and sometimes through 
email. This information also will be recorded onto CRFs while the originals may be kept at the 
testing site .CRFs will be kept in a locked filing cabinet in a locked room at all times. All 
informat ion will be transferred to REDCap , a secure, web -based application supported by the 
CHOP Research Institute. The password to log onto the database will be unique to each 
member of the study team.  CNMC study staff will be assigned to a REDcap user group tha t 
will restrict their access so they may view and edit solely the information of subjects enrolled at 
CNMC. The CNMC Principle Investigator will have access to view/edit data of all subjects. 
   
   
  10/8/2018  15 
Note that only limited PHI (date of visit, date of birth) is inc luded in the REDcap database. 
CHOP will have read -write access for data collected at both sites. CHOP will require access to 
edit records for both sites because several evaluations will be analyzed at CHOP, and reports 
including data from both CHOP and CNM C sites will be forwarded to the CHOP team, who 
will then import or enter the data into REDCap. Written informed consent granting permission 
for other site(s) to access PHI will be obtained from all subjects .The CRF and REDCap  
database will be designed by the CTRC Informatics Services.  
All data and records generated during this study will be kept confidential in accordance with 
institutional policies and on HIPPA subject privacy. The investigators/study team members/site 
personnel will not use such data and  records for any purpose other than for conducting the 
study.  
As a way to minimize the chance of PHI (protected health information) from being disclosed, a 
unique identification code will be used for each participant. The key to this code will be kept in 
a locked file in the PI/Study Coordinator’s office.  
If any publications result from this research, the participant will not be identified by name/PHI.  
The information collected as part of this study will be kept for 6 years or until the completion 
of the s tudy (whichever is longer). At that time, the information collected will be destroyed or 
all identifiable information will be removed. All keys will be destroyed at this time, as well.  
8.2 Confidentiality  
All data and records generated during this study will b e kept confidential in accordance with  
institutional pol icies and HIPPA’s guidelines on subject privacy. The investigators/study 
personnel will not use such data and records for any purpose other than conducting the study.  
8.3 Regulatory and Ethical Consider ations  
8.3.1 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
Study progress and safety will be reviewed quarterly (and for frequently if needed)  by the PI . 
Review of the rate of subject accrual, adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria will occur 
quarterly to assure that parti cipants meet the eligibility criteria. There will be ongoing 
collection of data on adverse events and compliance to the treatment protocol throughout the 
study by research staff, which will be reviewed monthly by the study team and PI. If there is an 
incid ental finding deemed by the PI to be clinically relevant, the primary care provider will be 
notified. The parent/guardian will be notified and asked to follow up with the subject’s primary 
care provider i f during the visit;  a subject is noted to have blood  pressure that is ≥ the 95th 
percentile for age, gender, and height. We will notify the parent/guardian/primary care provider 
with clinically relevant abnormal labs. Specifically, lipid levels/insulin levels/blood glucose 
levels/OGTT results/TSH and T4.   Note that some labs, such as lipids and insulin, are run in 
batches and reporting of results may be delayed.  
8.3.2 Incidental Findings  
Participants will have the option to consent for any incidental findings to be shared with their 
primary care provider. If there  is an incidental finding deemed by the PI to be clinically 
   
   
  10/8/2018  16 
relevant, the primary care provider will be notified. The parent/guardian will be notified and 
asked to follow up with the subject’s primary care provider if during the visit; a subject is noted 
to have blood pressure that is ≥ the 95th percentile for age, gender, and height. We will notify 
the parent/guardian/primary care provider with clinically relevant abnormal labs. Specifically, 
lipid levels/insulin levels/blood glucose levels/OGTT results/TS H and T4.  Note that some 
labs, such as lipids and insulin, are run in batches and reporting of results may be delayed.  
 
8.3.3 Risk Assessment  
The risks of participating in this study are relatively small and the investigators believe the 
overall study is of min imal risk to the parti cipants. An OGTT will only be administered to 
subjects that have BMIs ≥ 85th percent ile, not known to have diabetes .  
Expected risks to the subject are as follows:  
 Blood draw may result  in temporary discomfort from the n eedle stick, bruising, 
fainting, wea kness, and rarely an infection at the site  
 Possible side effects of the OGTT include temporary high or low blood sugar and upset 
stomach  
 Anthropometric measurements and pubertal status exam poses minimal risks  
 Exposure to radiation during DXA scan  
 Sharing of private health information (PHI) including dietary intake, demographic 
information, health history and medical information  
 Pulse wave velocity and pulse wave analysis poses minimal risks  
 12 hour overnight fasting may cause hunger pangs, upset stomach, h eadache, or light -
headedness  
 Blood pressure measurement by auscultation may cause temporary numbness/tingling 
in the arm  
 SenseWear® Armbands  worn for 7 consecutive days may cause skin irritability  
 Sensitive psychosocial issues may arise during questionnai re assessment  
A small amount of blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn at major assessment points. 
Adolescents may experience some degree of discomfort, bruising, or lightheadedness with 
fasting blood draws. There is also a risk of infection when blood is  drawn. These 
occurrences are rare, generally mild, and respond to conservative treatment.  
The OGTT is frequently used to screen for diabetes and impairments in glucose regulation 
in children both within the confines of a study and in routine clinical prac tice; additional 
intermediate blood draws will be performed for glucose and insulin in order to assess 
insulin sensitivity.  Because of these intermediate time points for blood collection, an 
intravenous line will be placed, which can be associated with di scomfort and a small risk of 
infection.  The use of EMLA cream is optional to minimize discomfort to the study 
participant. Experienced pediatric research nurses will perform the OGTT; OGTT are 
routinely performed in this setting.  Seven blood samples are required and the volumes of 
blood will be minimized to reduce the risk of anemia.  The concern with OGTT is 
hypoglycemia occurring 2 -3 hours after consumption of the dextrose load.  If hypoglycemic 
   
   
  10/8/2018  17 
symptoms develop, blood glucose will be checked. In the ev ent of hypoglycemia (blood 
glucose<60 mg/dL), the study will be terminated and carbohydrates consumed by the 
subject.  Blood glucose will be monitored until normalization is assured.  To minimize 
subject burden, particularly in this cohort of children with  developmental disabilities, we 
will perform OGTT only in subjects with BMI ≥85%.  While the aim of the study is to 
uncover cardiometabolic risk factors in children with DS and to uncover whether 
adolescents with DS have greater risk for a given BMI z -score, glucose intolerance is 
unlikely in children with BMI<85% and the yield of  doing OGTT in this subgroup is 
relatively low. Our team felt that it was crucial to be sensitive to the burden of participation 
placed on these children with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families.  
Participation in the study involv es risks associated with the small amount of radiation 
exposure associated with the DXA whole body scan for body composition assessment; the 
total radiation EDE from DXA scans is less than 3 μSv (or 1 mrem). This total amount of 
radiation is less than the exposure to daily background radiation at sea level (3,000 μSv 
per year) and is therefore considered minimal risk. Females of childbearing potent ial 
undergo a urine pregnancy test prior to the DXA scans. Pregnant females do not have 
DXA scans performed in order to protect the unborn fetus.  
The anthropometric assessment involves measurements of height, weight, circumferences 
and skinfold thickness. There is a very minor possibility of bruising from the skinfold 
thickness measurements. The exam will be performed by trained anthropometrists 
experienced in obtaining measurements in children at all levels of cognitive ability. The 
measurements are obtain ed in a private room. The parent is permitted to stay with the child 
if it increases their comfort with the exam.  
The puberty assessment will be performed by pediatric endocrinologists in a private 
setting. The procedure will be explained to the child in a dvance, and the parent is 
permitted to be present if preferred by the child. The exam is performed by highly 
experienced personnel who are familiar with minimizing distress associated with the 
exam.  
SenseWear® Armbands (Body  Media, Inc.).  There is little t o no risk associated with 
measuring physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep with armband accelerometers. 
These accelerometers fit comfortably on the participant’s arm and can easily be removed 
should he/she become uncomfortable. Some patients may experience skin irritation, 
particularly when sweating, with the devices in which case they can adjust them or in rare 
instances, remove them if necessary. To prevent irritation, parents will be instructed to 
clean the armband with mild soap and water when  the child removes it to bath e or shower. 
If irritation does occur, parents will be instructed to use Aquaphor or Vaseline where the 
fabric of the band is to treat and prevent further irritation. If a child is allergic to metal they 
will not be required to  complete this assessment.  
A licensed clinical psychologist with expertise in working with children and adolescents, 
will meet with families concerning sensitive psychosocial issues that may arise during 
assessments or intervention. Any emotional upset wil l be handled with appropriate support 
to the participants and their caregivers. Further, if a behavioral health concern arises 
   
   
  10/8/2018  18 
during the study needing further evaluation and treatment, the clinical psychologist  will 
assist with a referral . 
If a subject sh ows any signs of clinical instability or definitively decides to discontinue 
participation, the study visit will end.  
 
8.3.4 Potential Benefits of Study Participation  
There may be no direct benefit and benefits will be to future patients , Science  and society. 
Participants may directly benefit from identification  of abnormalities such as diabetes from the 
OGTT . Participants may indirectly benefit from identification of abnormalities such as 
dyslipidemia and hypothyroidism from the fasting blood draw.  If clinically  relevant 
abnormalities are found, the family  will be notified. With the consent from the family, 
clinically relevant tests results will be shared with the subject’s primary care physician.  Only 
studies performed by CLIA certified labs will be disclosed. Participants found to have an 
impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance will be referred appropriately for further 
management and treatment.  
The physical activity questionnaires and dietary recall may potentially lead the 
participants/parents/ guardians into awareness about making healthy lifestyle options in diet and 
exercise.   
There is also a potential indirect benefit in helping scientists and health providers further 
understand the relationship between obesity and Cardiometabolic risk in Dow n syndrome  
youth .  
8.3.5 Risk -Benefit Assessment  
The benefits to participation in this trial outweigh the potential risks. Clinicians caring for 
obese adolescents with Down syndrome with or without CHD have very little scientific 
evidence upon which to base guid ance regarding Cardiometabolic risk. Data regarding 
prevalence of pre -diabetes and T2D and on CVD risk in obese adolescents with Down 
syndrome are lacking.  This study will have direct implications for the daily medical care of 
individuals with Down syndrom e. Currently, we do not know whether BMI is the best marker 
of cardiometabolic risk in Down syndrome. We plan to determine which measure of adiposity 
best captures CVD and or diabetes risk in Down syndrome, so that primary care providers will  
know what mea sure to use to assess risk in adolescents with Down syndrome (i.e. BMI, waist 
circumference, or skin fold thickness). Medical providers will then be able to use the 
appropriate measure for prevention, and to guide screening.  
8.4 Recruitment Strategy  
Potential subjects will be identified using the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Subjects  
will be recruited from multiple sources , including local  primary care, Endocrinology, 
Cardiology and Trisomy 21 clinics, local advertisements, previous studies (if th ey gave 
permission to be contacted), and DS community events . The DS Connect recruitment registry 
will e-mail registry participants the IRB -approved recruitment flyer .  
   
   
  10/8/2018  19 
 
A study website will also be used as a source of information for potential DS and cont rol 
subjects.  
The Recruitment Enhancement Core (REC) will e -mail or postal mail potential control subjects 
using the IRB -approved REC letter for control subjects.  This letter will contain opt -out 
language that allows study staff to contact participants via one phone call who have not opted -
out 2 weeks following the letter being sent.  
After  the initial telephone screening, subjects that agree to participate and qualify  for the study 
will be scheduled for an appointm ent. Verbal consent will be obtained by th e study team prior 
to the  screening.  
8.5 Informed Consent/Assent  and HIPAA Authorization  
Prior to conducting the screening interview  and prior to mailing the family the HFI 
questionnaire , verbal consent from the subject (if 18 years or older)/ parent/guardian /legal 
authorized representative  will be obtained and documented by the study coordinator/study 
investigator. A description of the procedures involved in the study, as well as the risks/benefits 
will be provided verbally as part of this process. Additionally , it will be stressed that any 
questions are appropriate and that all aspects of the study are voluntary.  
Prior to conducting the study visit procedures, the study coordinator will obtain consent and if 
appropriate assent from the p articipant. A waiver of minor assent by the study coordinator will 
be obtained for participants not capable of assenting. The consent/assent process will take place 
in a private room. It will be stressed again that participation in the study is voluntary and that 
any questions ca n and should be raised. Consent and assent will be documented by the  
parent/guardian/participant’s signatures on the approved consent documents. A description of 
the procedures involved in the study, as well as the risks and benefits, will be provided verb ally 
as part of the consent process.  
Consent/assent documents will be maintained in the participant’s study file and documented. 
The parent/guardian will receive a copy of the signed document(s).  
8.5.1 Consent for Down syndrome subjects 18 – 20 years of age  
Ability to provide consent will be ascertained by the study team. Initially, the team will assess 
the participants’ ability by engaging them in conversation to obtain a brief, general sense of 
their ability to comprehend and communicate. If ability to provide  consent seems likely, the 
team will then explain the following to confirm that the study participant understands all of the 
essential element s of the consent form:  
a. The purpose of the research study. We will explain that the study is trying to 
find out whi ch tests and measurements will best capture the risks of heart 
disease and type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents with DS. We will ask 
them to explain in their own words what the study is about.  
   
   
  10/8/2018  20 
b. Study procedures will be explained with the aid of a pic ture book that depicts 
the study visit and at -home procedures. We will then ask them to explain in their 
own words what each procedure will be like.  
c. The staff will clearly explain that the study participant does not have to 
participate in the study, that t hey can change their mind about being in the study 
at any time, and that no one will be disappointed, upset or consider it a failure if 
they decide they do not want to continue with the study. Subjects will be asked 
to explain in their own words that  they understand that they do not have to 
participate in the study and that there are no consequences if they choose not to.   
d. We will explain that their information will be kept private to the best of our 
ability. We will explain the risks of each procedure. We will also explain that 
they may learn more about their health from the study, and that their health may 
improve from taking the thyroid hormone pills, but that it is also possible that 
they may not benefit from the study. Participants will be asked to expl ain in 
their own words what they understand about the risks and benefits of the study.  
If it is deemed by the study team at any of the above points  that the subject is unable to consent 
for themselves, the subject’s legally authorized representative/health  care representative will 
provide the written informed consent on the subject’s behalf.  
8.5.2 Assent  Procedures  
Assent will be obtained and documented on the consent form for children capable of 
assenting.  DS subjects age 18 -20 years of age that are not capable  of consenting for 
themselves will have assent documented in the consent form.  If the capability of some of the 
participants  is limited in comprehending the study and that they  cannot reasonably be 
consulted, assent will not be obtained . In these cases, th e investigators will document it on 
the consent form. Investigators will obtain assent whenever possible.  
8.5.3 Waiver of Documentation of Consent  
Waiver of documentation of consent is being sought for screening procedures, as the 
subject over age 18/parent/guar dian/legal authorized representative will be contacted by 
telephone  and obtaining a signature will not be feasible.  As described in (8.5), verbal 
consent /HIPAA authorization  will be obtained and documented by the study 
coordinator/study investigator prior to conducting the screening interview  and prior to 
mailing the family the HFI .  
 
8.5.4 Waiver of Assent  
Waiver of assent is being sought for screening procedures, as subjects may not be 
present when parents/guardians/legally authorized representatives are contac ted 
   
   
  10/8/2018  21 
8.6 Payment to Subjects/Families  
All study procedures and expenses will not be billed to the participant. The total reimbursement 
for the study visit is $150. The parent/guardian will receive a total of $100 to offset the burdens 
of transportation/parking/ time off work/babysitting fees/meals.  The parent/guardian will 
receive  $50 immediately after the study visit and an additional $50 once all post -visit 
procedures are complete.   The participant will receive a $50 gift card  for their efforts toward 
the study .  
In the event that any study procedure cannot be completed on the date of the study visit and the 
participant returns on another date to complete any pending study procedure(s), the 
parent/guardian will be reimbursed with $50 to offset the burdens of the  time and effort needed 
to come in for the visit.

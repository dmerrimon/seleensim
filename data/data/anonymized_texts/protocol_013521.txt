Protocol Title  
A phase 1/2 study evaluating brentuximab vedotin in combination with nivolumab in patients with relapsed or 
refractory Hodgkin lymphoma after failure of frontline therapy 
Study Objectives 
Primary:  
● To assess the safety profile of brentuximab vedotin administered in combination with nivolumab in patients 
with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphom a (HL)  
● To assess the antitumor activity of brentuximab vedotin administered in combination with nivolumab in patients with relapsed or refractory HL  
Secondary:  
● To assess the objective response rate (ORR)  
● To assess the duration of complete response (CR) and  objective response (OR)  
● To assess progression -free survival (PFS) after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)  
Additional:  
● To assess overall survival (OS)  
● To compare the CR rate in patients who relapsed after frontline therapy with the CR rate in patients  who 
were refractory to frontline therapy  
● To assess the feasibility of stem cell mobilization and collection after treatment with brentuximab vedotin in combination with nivolumab  
● To assess PFS  
● To assess pharmacokinetics and incidence of antitherapeutic an tibodies ( ATA) against  each study drug 
given in combination  
● To assess tumor amplification and expression of programmed death -ligand 1/ programmed death -ligand 2 
(PD-L1/PD-L2) and relationship to response  
● To assess tumor microenvironment and peripheral immune status  
● To compare safety and efficacy of treatment  with staggered versus same -day dosing schemes  
● To compare biomarker data obtained with staggered versus same -day dosing schemes  
● To explore efficacy in patients who previously received brentuximab vedotin  
Study Population 
Key eligibility criteria include adult (aged ≥18 years) patients with relapsed or refractory HL following failure 
of standard frontline chemotherapy for the treatment of classical HL.  Patients must have an Eastern 
Cooperative Onco logy Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 and qualifying baseline laboratory data.  
Patients are excluded if they were previously treated with immu no-oncology agents or previously received an 
autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant.  Patients with documented history of a cerebral vascular event, 
history of another invasive malignancy that has not been in remission for at least 3 years, or history of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) are also excluded.  There will be 3 parts in this  study; each 
part will be enrolled sequentially.  For Parts 1 and 2, patients previously treated with brentuximab vedotin are 
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23  Jan 2017 
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 3 of 91 excluded; for Part 3, patients who were treated with brentuximab vedotin are eligible under the following 
conditions: 1) patient's  HL was not primary refractory to  a brentuximab vedotin- containing regimen in first line, 
i.e., patient achieved a CR to a brentuximab vedotin -containing regimen and did not progress within 3 months 
of the last dose of brentuximab vedotin ; and 2)  brentuxim ab vedotin was not  discontinued due to unacceptable 
toxicity.  
Number of Planned Patients  
Approximately 92 patients will be enrolled in this study.  
Study Design  
This is a phase 1/2, open -label, multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety and antitumor  activity of 
brentuximab vedotin treatment combined with nivolumab.  
Patients will be treated for up to four 21 -day cycles.  In Parts 1 and 2, the first dose of brentuximab vedotin 
1.8 mg/kg will be given on Cycle  1 Day 1. The first dose of nivolumab 3 mg/k g will be given on Cycle  1 Day 8. 
For Cycle  2 and all subsequent cycles, brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg will be 
given on Day 1.   In Part 3, both brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg and nivolumab 3  mg/kg will be adminis tered on 
Day 1 of all Cycles.  For patients in Part 3 who were previously treated with brentuximab vedotin  and had a 
dose reduction, dose assignment  must be discussed with the medical monitor . 
Patients in Parts 1 and 2 with radiographic evidence of progressive disease (PD) at the Cycle 2 response 
assessment are not eligible for further treatment on the study.  All other patients are eligible to continue treatment on study through Cycle  4.  After completion of the end-of-treatment (EOT) response assessment s, 
patients are eligible to undergo ASCT.  It is recommended that hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) be mobilized and collected after Cycle 4.  However, stem cell collection may occur in prior cycles after discussion with the  
medical monitor.  If patients have an unacceptable toxicity that is attributable to only one agent, as determined by the investigator, they will be eligible to continue on the treatment protocol through Cycle  4 with the tolerated 
drug as a single agent.  
Patients in Part 3 with confirmed, unequivocal PD at the Cycle 2 response assessment are not eligible for further 
treatment and will proceed to the EOT visit.  Patients with stable disease (SD) or better at the Cycle 2 response assessment may continue on tr eatment through Cycle 4.  Patients with an indeterminate response (IR), as 
defined by the Lymphoma Response to Immunomodulatory Therapy Criteria (LYRIC; Appendix D ) (Cheson 
2016 ), also may continue on treatment through Cycle 4.  After completion of the EOT response assessment, 
patients are eligible to undergo ASCT.  It is recommended that HSC  be mobilized and collected after Cycle 4.  
However, stem cell collection may occur in prior cycles after discussion with the medical monitor.  If patients have an unacceptable toxicity that is attributable to only one agent, as determined by the investigator, they will be eligible to continue on the treatment protocol  through Cycle 4 with the tolerated drug as a single agent.  
The safety of combination treatment in Part 1 will be evaluated by a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) prior 
to expansion of enrollment in Part 2 to evaluate treatment effect.  In Part 1, after 6 patients have been followed 
through the end of the dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) period, or at the point that 2 or more patients experience a 
DLT, whichever comes first, the SMC will review all available data and make a recommendation for one of the 
following:  
1. To proceed to Part 2 of the study, expanding enrollment with additional patients treated with the study 
drugs at the doses and schedule determined to be safe in Part 1 of the study;  
2. To repeat Part 1 of the study and treat up to 6 additional patients at the same drug doses and schedule 
previously tested or with any of the following modifications that may include, but are not limited to:  
a. Dose reductio n of brentuximab vedotin to 1.2 mg/kg and/or nivolumab to 1 mg/kg; of note, doses may 
not be increased abo ve 1.8  mg/kg brentuximab vedotin or 3 mg/kg nivolumab 
b. Administration of combination treatment on Day 1 of every cycle  
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 4 of 91 3. To close the study to additional enrollment.  
For the purpose of this study, DLTs are defined as any study drug -related toxicity (brentuximab vedotin or 
nivolumab) that requires either a dose reduction or delay of more than 7 days of either study drug in Cycle  2 or 
delays the Cycle 3 Day 1 administration of combined treatment by more than 7 days.  The DLT -evaluation 
period consists of the fir st cycle  of therapy through the Cycle  3 Day 1 administration of combined treatment.  
Part 2 of the study will further characterize safety and evaluate the antitumor activity of brentuximab vedotin 
combined with nivolumab in patients who have failed standard  frontline chemotherapy by enrolling 
approximately 50 additional patients at the recommended dose schedule determined in Part 1.  
Part 3 of the study will further characterize safety and efficacy of the study drug combination administered as 
same -day dosing  in all cycles by enrolling approximately 30 additional patients with relapsed or refractory HL 
at the recommended doses as followed in Part 2.  
Test Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
Brentuximab vedotin  
Parts 1, 2, and 3: 1.8 mg/kg or 1.2 mg/kg will be administered every 3 weeks via outpatient intravenous (IV) 
infusion on Day 1 of each cycle, as determined by the SMC in Part 1.  
Nivolumab  
Parts 1 and 2 (Staggered Dosing) : 3 mg/kg or 1  mg/kg will be administered every 3 weeks via outpatient IV 
infusion on Day 8 of Cycle  1 and Day  1 of each subsequent cycle or on Day 1 of each cycle, as determined by 
the SMC in Part  1. 
Part 3 (Same -day Dosing) : 3 mg/kg will be administered every 3 weeks via outpatient IV infusion following 
each brentuximab vedotin do se on Day 1 of all treatment cycles.  
Duration of Treatment  
Planned treatment duration is 4 cycles (12 weeks).  
Efficacy Assessments  
Lymphoma response and progression will be assessed by investigators using the Lugano Classification Revised Staging System fo r malignant lymphoma (Cheson 2014) .  Dedicated CT scans of chest, neck, abdomen, and 
pelvis  will be conducted at Cycle 2 response assessments . CT and PET scans will be performed at baseline, at 
EOT, pr ior to ASCT, and during long -term follow -up.  PET will be  performed with CT scans until the patient is 
in complete metabolic response (CmR) by PET.  For patients in Part 3, investigators will conduct response 
assessments using  the Lugan o criteria with the incorporation  of the Lymphoma Response to 
Immunomodulatory Therapy Criteria (Cheson 2016). 
Cycle-2 CT scans of diagnostic quality will be performed 15 to 21 days after dosing to assess for progression of 
disease.  The window for performing CT/PET scans at the EOT assessment for patients in Parts 1 and 2 is 23 to 37 days post last dose of study dru g, but for patients in Part 3, the window for performing CT/PET scans at the 
EOT assessment  is 15 to 30 days post last dose of study drug.  Pre-ASCT scans may be waived for patients who 
have a scan performed within 6 weeks prior.   Long -term follow -up asses sments will be performed at the 
following time points post -ASCT (or post-EOT for patients who do not undergo ASCT): 100 days and then 6, 9, 
12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months, and then per institutional standard thereafter.  A final safety visit will be 
performed 100 days after the last dose of nivolumab and after the EOT visit to assess for potential immune -
mediated adverse events  (AEs) .  Patients will be followed according to this schedule until withdrawal of 
consent, death,  or study closure, whichever occurs first.  
Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity Assessments  
Serum concentrations of brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab, and plasma concentrations of MMAE (unconjugated) will be measured.  ATA against brentuximab vedotin and ATA  against nivolumab will also be 
assessed.

Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 5 of 91 Biomarker Assessments  
Blood and tumor samples will be collected for measurement of potential biomarkers.  
Safety Assessments  
Safety assessments will include the surveillance and recording of AEs, physical examinatio n findings, pulse 
oximetry tests, and laboratory tests.  
Statistical Methods  
Safety and efficacy analyses will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  Frequencies and percentages will 
be used when presenting categorical variables.  The primary efficacy endpoint of CR rate will be tested using a 
one-sided exact binomial test with a null hypothesis of CR rate less than or equal to 30% and α=0.05.

1.1 Hodgkin Lymphoma  
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a neoplasm of lymphoid tissue that is histopathologically defined 
by the presence of malignant Hodgkin Reed -Sternberg (HRS) cells in a background of 
inflammatory cells.  Advances in the use of combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy in HL over the past half century have resulted in a durable remission rate of approximately 70% (Connors 2005).  However, these multi -agent  regimens are associated with significant 
morbidity, including secondary malignancies, cardiac disease, pulmonary disease, and infertility (Loge 1999) ( Swerdlow 2000).  Furthermore, approximately 30–40% of patients 
presenting with HL will become refractory to initial therapy or will relapse.  
1.2 Molecular Targets in the Treatment of Hodgkin Lymphoma  
CD30, a cell membrane protein of the tumor necrosis receptor family, is uniformly expressed on HRS cell s.  However, normal expression of CD30 is restricted to a relatively small 
population of activated T cells and B cells, making it an excellent surface protein to target 
with antibody- directed therapy (Falini 1995). 
The programmed death -1 (PD -1) cell surface membrane receptor is a mem ber of the CD28 
family of T  cell co -stimulatory receptors (Pardoll 2003).  PD -1 signaling has been shown to 
inhibit T cell activation, and expansion of previously activated cells.  Experimental  results 
suggest that PD-1 blockade has the potential to activate anti- self T  cell responses, but these 
responses are variable and dependent upon various host genetic factors ( Sharpe 2007).  There 
is growing evidence that HRS cell -directed PD -1 signaling in tumor infiltrating T  cells 
contributes to the tumor’s ability to avoid clearance by the immune system.  The PD -1 
ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, are both expressed by multiple HL cell lines and PD-1 
overexpression is found in tumor- infiltrating and peripheral blood T cells of patients with HL 
(Yamamoto 2008).  PD -L1 expression in clinical samples, as detected by 
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, is present in  more than 80% of cases of HL, with 
similar rates of expression in all HL pathological subtypes (Chen 2013).  There are multiple 
mechanisms that can account for upregulated expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 in HRS cells.  Many cases of HL are associated with amplif ication of chromosome 9p24.1 which contains 
the genes PD -L1, PD-L2, and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2).  An increase in JAK2 copy number 
indirectly contributes to PD ligand overexpression through STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1)- mediated transcriptional effects on PD -L1 and PD- L2 (Green 
2010).  Furth ermore, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection of malignant HRS cells, which is 
implicated in approximately 40% of cases of HL, contributes to overexpression of PD- L1 
even in the absence of 9p24.1 amplification.  The EBV latent membrane protein 1 exerts direct  and indirect effects on PD- L1 promoter and enhancer elements leading to increased 
PD-L1 protein expression ( Green 2012).

Brochure.  
1.3.1  Brentuximab Vedotin 
Brentuximab vedotin is a CD30- directed antibody -drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of 3 
components: 1) the chimeric IgG1 antibody cAC10, specific for human CD30; 2) t he 
microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE); and 3) a protease- cleavable 
linker that covalently attaches MMAE to cAC10.  The primary mechanism of anticancer activity of brentuximab vedotin is binding of the ADC to CD30- expressing cells, followed by 
internalization of the ADC -CD30 complex, and the release of MMAE via proteolytic 
cleavage.  Binding of MMAE to tubulin disrupts the microtubule network within the cell, subsequently inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic death of the cell.  Possible additional mechanisms of anticancer activity include bystander effects on nearby cells in the tumor microenvironment, immunogenic cell death, and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis 
(Oflazoglu 2007; Li 2014; Muller 2014; Gardai 2015; Kim 2015). 
In a pivotal phase 2 study of 102 patients with relapsed or refractory HL following 
autologous stem cell transplant ( ASCT), treatment with brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks resulted in an objective response rate (ORR) of 75% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64.9%–82.6%).  The complete response (CR) rate was 34% (95% CI, 25.2%–44.4%) 
and the median progression-free survival (PFS) for all patients on study was 5.6 months 
(95% CI, 5.0–9.0 months) ( Younes 2012). 
The activity of brentuximab vedotin in patients who had previously received it was 
demonstrated in the SGN35-006 study of p atients with hematologic  malignancies who 
initially respond ed to brentuximab vedotin and then subsequently progress ed (Bartlett 2014 ).  
In this open- label, multicenter , phase 2 study of patients with HL or systemic anaplastic large 
cell l ymphoma who had responded to brentuximab vedotin monotherapy during a previous 
clinical trial ( Bartlett 2014 ), patients were eligible if they had achieved a partial response 
(PR) or better to  initial treatment with  brentuximab vedotin, discontinued treatment while in 
remission, and subsequently developed disease progression or relapse.  In the retreatment 
study, patients received brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg on Day 1 of each 21- day treatment 
cycle .  Patients who se dose was reduc ed to 1.2 mg/kg for any reason during their initial 
therapy  were given  1.2 mg/kg on Day 1 of each 21- day treatment cycle  upon retreatment.  Of 
the 21 patients with HL enrolled, t he median time between the last brentuximab vedotin dose 
from initial treatment  and the first dose at retreatment was 11.4 months (range 4–45 months).  
The ORR and CR rates with brentuximab vedotin retreatment were 60% and 30%, 
respectively.  The median duration of response was 9.2 months (range 0.0+ to  19.5+ months).  
For patients who achieved a CR, the median duration of response was 9.4 months (range 1.7–
14.2 months).  The median PFS was 9.9 months, and the median overall survival ( OS) had 
not been reached at the time of study clo sure.  The most common adverse events (AE s) were 
peripheral sensory neuropathy (59%), fatigue and nausea (41% each), diarrhea (38%), and 
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 13 of 91 arthralgia, headache, peripheral motor neuropathy, and pyrexia (28% each).  The most 
common AEs that were ≥ Grade 3 consisted of anemia (17%), fatigue (14%), and 
hyperglycemia, hypophosphatemia, and thrombocytopenia (10% each).  No serious AE s 
leading to death were attributed to brentuximab vedotin. 
1.3.2  Nivolumab 
Nivolumab is a fully-human monoclonal antibody (immunoglobulin G4 [IgG4]) that targets 
PD-1.  In vitro, nivolumab binds to PD-1 with high affinity (EC50 0.39 to 2.62 nM), and 
inhibits the binding of PD- 1 to its ligands PD -L1 and PD-L2 (IC50 ± 1 nM).  Nivolumab 
binds specifically to PD-1 and not to related members of the CD28 family such as CD28, ICOS, CTLA -4, and BTLA.  Nivolumab blocks the PD-1 pathway and results in a 
reproducible enhancement of both proliferation and interferon gamma ( IFN-γ) release in the 
mixed lymphocyte reaction.  Using a cytomegalovirus (CMV) re -stimulation assay with 
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ), the effect of nivolumab on 
antigen -specific recall response indicates that nivolumab augments IFN-γ secretion from 
CMV -specific memory T cells in a dos e-dependent manner versus isotype-matched control.  
In vivo blockade of PD-1 by a murine analog of nivolumab enhances the antitumor immune response and results in tumor rejection in several immunocompetent mouse tumor models 
(MC38, SA1/N, and PAN02) ( Wolchok 2009). 
A recent report from a phase 1 study of nivolumab in patients with advanced hematological 
malignancies demonstrated a high response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory HL, with an ORR of 87% (20/23) and a CR rate of 17% (4/23).  The responses obtained were durable with a 6-month PFS of 86% and no significant difference in the ORR in the subset of 
18 patients who had previously failed brentuximab vedotin ( Ansell 2015). 
1.4 Clinical Study Rationale  
High dose chemotherapy with ASCT provides the best chance to achieve a durable remission 
in patients with HL who have relapsed or refractory disease after standard frontline combination chemotherapy ( Schmitz 2002).  Salvage chemotherapy is typically given prior 
to delivering high-dose chemotherapy/ASCT to maximally debulk disease.  Patients achieving a metabolic CR after salvage chemotherapy have a long -term relapse- free survival 
of ~75% post- ASCT.  In contrast, patients with evidence of residual disease prior to high 
dose chemotherapy/ASCT have a long -term relapse-free survival that is only ~25% 
(Moskowitz 2010).  Because results from salvage therapy directly influence long- term 
event -free survival post- ASCT, it is critical to develop well- tolerated regimens that increase 
CR rates pre-ASCT (Moskowitz 2012). 
Given that brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab both have documented high single- agent 
response rates in HL and also work through distinct mechanisms of action, it is expected that combination therapy could potentially be more effective in the salvage treatment set ting than 
administration of either agent alone.  Moreover, both agents are well tolerated, have few overlapping toxicities, and can be infused in the outpatient setting.  This study will evaluate

3.1 Summary of Study Design  
This is a phase 1/2, open- label, multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety and 
antitumor activity of brentuximab vedotin treatment co mbined with nivolumab.  The study 
will be conducted in 3 parts. 
3.1.1  Study Design Parts 1 and 2  
Patients  in Parts 1 and 2 wi ll be treated for up to four 21- day cycles.   The first dose of 
brentuximab vedotin will be given on Cycle 1 Day 1.  The first dose of nivolumab will be 
given on Cycle 1 Day 8.  For Cycle  2 and all subsequent cycles, both brentuximab vedotin 
and nivolumab will be administered on Day 1.  Nivolumab will be administered at least 
30 minutes after infusion of brentuximab vedotin is complete ( Figure  1).

Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Ame ndment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 17 of 91 Patients  in Parts 1 and 2 with radiographic evidence of progressive disease (PD) at the Cycle 
2 response assessment are not el igible for further treatment on the study.  All other patients  in 
Parts 1 and 2 are eligible to continue treatment on study through Cycle 4.  After completion 
of the end-of- treatment (EOT)  response assessment s, patients are eligible to undergo ASCT.  
It is recommended that hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) be mobilized and collected after 
Cycle 4.  However, stem cell collection may occur in prior cycles after discussion with the medical monitor.  If patients have an unacceptable toxicity that is attributable to only one agent, as determined by the investigator, they will be eligible to continue on the treatment 
protocol through Cycle 4 with the tolerated drug as a single agent. 
3.1.2  Study Design Part 3  
In Part  3, patients will be treated for up to four 21- day cycles .  Both brentuximab vedotin and 
nivolumab will be administered on Day 1 of all cycles ( Figure 2); nivolumab will be 
administered at least 30  minutes after infusion of brentuximab vedotin is complete.

Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4;  23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 18 of 91 Patients in Part 3 with confirmed, unequivocal PD at Cycle 2  are not eligible for further 
treatment and will proceed to the EOT visit.  Patients with stable disease  (SD) or better at the 
Cycle 2 response asses sment may continue on treatment through Cycle 4.  Patients with an 
indeterminate response (IR) , as defined by the Lymphoma Response to Immunomodulatory 
Therapy Criteria (LYRIC; Appendix D ) (Cheson 2016), also may continue on treatmen t 
through Cycle 4.  After completion of the EOT  response assessment, patients are eligible to 
undergo ASCT.  It is recommended that H SC be mobilized and collected after Cycle 4.  
However, stem cell collection may occur in prior cycles after discussion with the medical 
monitor.  If patients have an unacceptable toxicity that is attributable to only one agent, as determined by the investi gator, they will be eligible to continue on the treatment protocol 
through Cycle 4 with the tolerated drug as a single agent.  
3.1.3  Safety Monitoring Committee  
In Part 1, the safety of combination treatment will be evaluated by a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC ) prior to expansion of enrollment to evaluate treatment effect in Part 2, as 
detailed in Section 9.3.9.  In Part 1, after 6 patients have been followed through the end of the 
dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) period, or at the point that 2 or more patients experience a DLT, 
whichever comes first, the SMC will review all available data and make a recommendation 
for one of the following: 
1. To proceed to Part 2 of the study, expanding enrollment with additional patients treated 
with the study drugs at the doses and schedule determined to be safe in Part 1 of the study 
2. To repeat Part 1 of the study and treat up to 6 additional patients at the same drug doses 
and schedule previously tested or with any of the following modifications that may 
include, but are not limited to: 
a. Dose reduction of brentuximab vedotin to 1.2 mg/kg and/or nivolumab to 1 mg/kg; of 
note, doses may not be increased above 1.8 mg/kg brentuxima b vedotin or 3 mg/kg 
nivolumab 
b. Administration of combination treatment on Day 1 of every cycle 
3. To close the study to additional enrollment.  
Part 2 of the study will further characterize safety and evaluate the antitumor activity of brentuximab vedotin combined with nivolumab in patients who have failed standard frontline chemotherapy by enrolling approximately 50 additional patients at the recommended dose 
schedule determined in Part 1. 
Part 3 of the study will further characterize safety and efficacy of th e study drug combination 
administered as same -day dosing in all cycles by enrolling approximately 30 additional 
patients with relapsed or refractory HL at the recommended doses as followed in Part 2.  If 
any safety signals are observed after the first 6 patients in Part 3 have been treated for 
2 cycles, then an SMC meeting will be convened. 
Details of the SMC will be documented in an SMC charter.

Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 19 of 91 3.1.4  Dose -Limiting Toxicities  
DLTs are only assessed during Part 1 of the study.  For the purpose of this study, DLTs are 
defined as any study drug -related toxicity (brentuximab vedotin or nivolumab) that requires 
either a dose reduction or delay of more than 7 days of either study drug in Cycle 2 or delays the Cycle 3 Day 1 administration of combined treatment by more than 7 days.  The DLT -
evaluation period consists of the first cycle of therapy through the Cycle 3 Day 1 administration of combined treatment.  The I nvestigator’s Brochures for brentuximab vedotin 
and nivolumab individually describe AEs commonly observed relative to either agent (i.e., neutropenia or peripheral neuropathy with brentuximab vedotin; immune- mediated AEs with 
nivolumab), as well as less common serious findings.  The respective I nvestigator’s 
Brochure s should be referenced when attributing causality; however, the final decision 
regarding causality is at the discretion of the investigator. 
If any patient enrolled in Part 1 discontinues the study during the DLT period, that patient 
will be replaced unless discontinuation is for DLT. 
3.2 Discussion and Rationale for Study Design 
The endpoints of this study are appropriate for evaluating the safety of brentuximab vedotin 
treatment in combination with nivolumab for patients with relapsed or refractory HL.  The DLT evaluati on in Part 1 of the study will provide an opportunity to assess safety and 
tolerability of combination treatment, the components of which have previously been assessed for safety in other settings.  Expanded enrollment in Part 2 is designed to assess the 
efficacy of the combination treatment based on CR rate with staggered dosing of nivolumab and to provide additional safety data.  The sample size is chosen to provide satisfactory power to exclude the previously demonstrated CR rate of single-agent brentuximab vedotin in a similar patient population in the case that the true CR rate of the combination treatment 
meets a clinically compelling threshold.  
3.2.1  Rationale for Study Design of Same -day Dosing 
On interim analysis, patients in Parts 1 and 2 had an ORR of 90% (95% CI 72.6%, 97.8% ; 
26/29 patients) and a CR rate of 62% (95% CI 42.3%, 79.3%; 18/29 patients).  Similar results 
were reported by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group study (E4412 Arms D and E) 
(ORR 100%, 8/8 evaluable patients; CR rate 6 2.5%, 5/8 pat ients) , which enrolled patients 
with relapsed refractory HL for treatment with  both brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab on 
Day 1 beginning with Cycle  1 (Diefenbach 2016) .  Based on results from both studies , a 
decision was made to amend the protocol to evaluate the safety and efficacy of same- day 
dosing of the study-drug combination beginnin g with Cycle 1 .  This new cohort, Part 3, will 
enroll patients with relapsed or refractory HL and will permit patients previously treated with brentuximab vedotin to explore activity of the combined regimen in brentuximab vedotin-
exposed patients.  
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 20 of 91 3.2.2  Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups  
In this open- label study, each part of the trial will enroll sequentially.  Enrollment and 
treatment in Part 1 will be completed before enrollment begins in Part 2, which will evaluate 
a staggered dosing schedule of brentuximab vedotin and  nivolumab in Cycle 1 followed by 
same-day dosing of both drugs in Cycles 2 through 4. 
After enrollment in Part 2 is complete, approximately 30 patients will be enrolled in Part 3 to 
evaluate same- day dosing of brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab in all treatment cycles. 
3.2.3  Rationale for Selection of Doses  
The recommended dose for brentuximab vedotin per its prescribing information is 1.8 mg/kg 
via intravenous (IV) infusion administered every 3 weeks.  This dose and schedule were evaluated in two pivotal phase 2 studies (SG035-0003 and SG035-0004) in patients with CD30 -positive hema tologic malignancies.   This dose and schedule for retreatment with 
brentuximab vedotin monotherapy were similarly evaluated in a separate phase 2 study (SGN35 -006) with the caveat that patients  enrolled for retreatment  who had a dose reduction 
for any reason to 1.2 mg/kg during their initial therapy  would receive brentuximab vedotin 
retreatment  at the reduced dose of 1.2 mg/kg.  
The dose for nivolumab for this study is 3 mg/kg via IV infusion administered every 3 weeks.  The approved dose for nivolumab as monotherapy is 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks for the treatment of melanoma and metastatic squamous non -small cell lung cancer.  However, 
nivolumab has been studied as monotherapy and in combination treatment in several tumor types with dosing every 3 weeks.  It was recently reported that nivolumab dose levels of 0.3, 2, and 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks yielded similar ORR, PFS, and OS in a phase 2 trial of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (Motzer 2015).  Moreover, nivolumab dose 
levels of 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks were associated with very similar (median 64%–70%) PD -1 receptor occupancy and comparable ORR and PFS in patients with 
advanced melanoma (Topalian 2012).  These findings indicate a flat dose -response 
relationship for nivolumab across a wide dose range for both 2- and 3-week dosing schedules, suggesting that dosing nivolumab at 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks is appropriate in the current study.  These results further suggest that reduction of the nivolumab dose level to 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks is  appropriate if the combination of 3 mg/kg nivolumab with 
brentuximab vedotin results in an unfavorable safety profile. 
The rationale for staggered dosing of brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab in Cycle 1 is 
supported by the reasoning that, by delivering brentuximab vedotin, a directly cytotoxic 
agent, 1 week prior to nivolumab in Cycle 1, it is anticipated that tumor -associated antigens 
will be released and available for presentation to resident cytotoxic T  cells at the same time 
that these cells become activated through PD -1 blockade.  However, because of the long half-
life of nivolumab, there is no rationale to continue staggered dosing beyond Cycle 1. 
Same-day dosing in all tre atment cycles is supported by data from the ECOG- ACRIN study 
(E4412) ( Diefenbach 2016).  In that study, patients in Arms D and E with relapsed or 
refractory HL  were treated with brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab administered on Day 1 
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 21 of 91 of 21- day cycles.  The regimen was well -tolerated in the 10 patients who were ev aluable for 
safety, with only 1 infusion-related reaction observed.  The ORR was 100% in 8 efficacy-
evaluable patients, with a CR rate of 62.5%.  Based on the low rate of infusion- related 
reactions and promising activity observed in the E4412 study, the protocol was amended  to 
explore same-day dosing in Part 3 of the SGN35 -025 study.

5 TREATMENTS  
5.1 Treatments Administered  
There are two inves tigational agents under study in this protocol.  Brentuximab vedotin is an 
ADC consisting of the antibody cAC10, specific for human CD30; the microtubule-
disrupting agent MMAE; and a protease- cleavable linker that covalently attaches MMAE to 
cAC10.  Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that acts as an 
immunomodulator by blocking ligand activation of the PD- 1 receptor on activated T cells.  
5.2 Brentuximab Vedotin 
Detailed information describing the preparation, administration, and storage of brentuximab vedotin is located in the Pharmacy Binder. 
5.2.1  Description  
Brentuximab vedotin is a sterile, preservative free, white to off-white lyophilized cake or 
powder supplied by Seattle Genetics in single-use vials for reconstitution for IV administration.   Each vial of the product contains brentuximab vedotin, trehalose, sodium 
citrate, and polysorbate 80.  See the Pharmacy Binder for further information. 
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 25 of 91 5.2.2  Dose and Administration 
Brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg (or 1.2 mg/kg, if recommended by the SMC during Part 1)  
will be administered every 21 days by IV infusion given over approximately 30 minutes.  For 
patients in Part 3 who were previously treated with brentuximab vedotin and had a dose 
reduction, dose assignment must be discussed with the medical monitor . 
In the absence of infusion-related reactions, the infusion rate for all patients should be calculated in order to achieve a 30 -minute infusion period. Brentuximab vedotin must not be 
administered as an IV push or bolus.  Brentuximab vedotin should not be mixed with other medications.  When both drugs are administered on Day 1 of the cycle, brentuximab vedotin administration should be completed at least 30 minutes prior to starting administration of 
nivolumab. 
Dosing is based on patient actual body weight.  Doses must be adjusted for patients who 
experience a ≥10% change in weight from baseline.  Other dose adjustments for changes in body weight are permitted per institutional standard.  An exception to weight-based dosing is made for patients weighing greater than 100 kg; doses will be based on 100 kg for these 
individuals.  Rounding is permissible within 5% of the nominal dose. 
5.2.3  Dose Modifications  
Table 1 describes the recommended dose modifications for brentuximab vedotin 
treatment -associated toxicity.  
Doses reduced for brentuximab vedotin-related toxicity should not be re- escalated without 
discussion with the sponsor.  Patients who discontinue nivolumab due to an AE may continue 
treatment with brentuximab vedotin monotherapy to complete the allowable 4 cycles of treatment.  If brentuximab vedotin is withheld at the time a cycle  of nivolumab is given, once 
the AE causing the delay of brentuximab vedotin has resolved, administration of brentuximab vedotin should resume on the same schedule with the next cycle of combination therapy.  Dose delays of both brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab resulting in treatment 
interruption of all therapy for >6 weeks requir e patient discontinuation from study treatment.

5.2.4  Storage and Handling 
Refrigeration should be set at 2–8°C for storage of vials and solutions containing 
brentuximab vedotin.  The controlled location must be accessible only to the pharmacist, the investigator, or a duly designated person.  Brentuximab vedotin does not contain preservatives; therefore, opened and reconstituted vials of brentuximab vedotin should be used as soon as possible.  If not used immediately, the in-use storage should not be longer than 24 hours.  It is recommended that brentuximab vedotin vials and solutions be protected from direct sunlight until the time of use.  Reconstituted vials and solutions must not be 
shaken. 
Drug accountability instructions are provided in the Pharmacy Binder. 
5.2.5  Packaging and Labeling 
Drug product vials may be labeled as brentuximab vedotin, the United States adopted name 
(USAN) and the International Nonproprietary Name (INN), or as SGN-35, the compound 
code; the 2 names can be used interchangeably.

Brentuximab vedotin vials are provided via single-use containers.  Any partially used vials or 
diluted dosing solutions should be discarded using appropriate institutional drug disposal 
procedures. 
Brentuximab vedotin should be reconstituted with the appropriate amount of Sterile Wa ter 
for Injection, United States Pharmacopeia (USP) or equivalent (see Pharmacy Binder for 
details).  The vial should be gently swirled until the contents are completely dissolved.  The vial must not be shaken.  The reconstituted drug product should be inspected visually for any 
particulate matter and discoloration.  
The required volume of reconstituted drug product should be diluted into an infusion bag.  
The bag should be gently inverted to mix the solution.  The bag must not be shaken.  Prior to administration, the reconstituted and diluted drug product should be inspected visually for 
any particulate matter and discoloration.  
Detailed drug preparation instructions are provided in the Pharmacy Binder. 
5.3 Nivolumab 
Detailed information describing the preparation, administration, and storage of nivolumab is 
located in the Pharmacy Binder. 5.3.1  Description  
Nivolumab is a sterile, preservative free, clear to opalescent, colorless to pale-yellow solution 
supplied by Seattle Genetics in single -use vials for dilu tion for IV administration.  Each 
single -use vial of the product contains 100 mg/10  mL solution.  See the Pharmacy Binder for 
further information. 
5.3.2  Method of Procurement  
Nivolumab will be provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb and supplied to the study sites by 
Seattle Genetics.  
5.3.3  Dose and Administration 
For patients in Parts 1 and 2, nivolumab will be administered on Day 8 of Cycle  1 and Day 1 
of Cycles 2 through 4 of each 21- day treatment cycle.  For patients in Part 3, nivolumab will 
be administered on Day 1 of a ll 21-day treatment cycles.  Patients will receive nivolumab at a 
dose of 3 mg/kg (or 1  mg/kg, if recommended by the SMC during Part 1) as a 60- minute 
infusion.  When both drugs are administered on Day 1 of the cycle, nivolumab should be 
administered at least 30 minutes after completing treatment with brentuximab vedotin.  Nivolumab infusions should be administered through an IV line containing a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein binding in-line filter (pore size of 0.2 micrometer to 1.2  micrometer).  
Other drugs should not be co-administered through the same IV line (e.g., brentuximab 
vedotin). 
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 28 of 91 Dosing calculations should be based on the body weight assessed at baseline.  It is not 
necessary to re calculate subsequent doses if the patient weight is within 1 0% of the weight 
used to calculate the previous dose.  All doses should be rounded to the nearest milligram. 
The Pharmacy Binder contains specific instructions for nivolumab dose calculation, dilution, 
preparation of the infusion fluid, and administration. 
5.3.4  Dose Modifications  
Based on available information, autoimmune complications are the most likely AEs 
attributable to nivolumab.  Dose modifications for AEs are described in this section as well 
as in Appendix 2 of the nivolumab Investigator’s Brochure. 
There will be no dose escalations or reductions of nivolumab allowed, unless determined by 
the SMC to enroll patients to be treated at 1  mg/kg throughout the trial (see Section 3.1.3).  
Patients who discontinue brentuximab vedotin due to an AE may continue treatment with 
nivolumab monotherapy to complete the allowable 4 cycles of treatment.  If nivolumab is held at the time a cycle of brentuximab vedotin is given, once the AE causing the delay of nivolumab has resolved, administration of nivolumab should resume on the same schedule with the next cycle  of combination therapy.  Dose delays of both brentuximab vedotin and 
nivolumab resulting in treatment in terruption of all therapy for >6 weeks require patient 
discontinuation from study treatment.  See Section 7.6.1.1 for determining causality. 
5.3.4.1  Dose D elays  
Dose delays for nivolumab- related liver function test (LFT) abnormalities are described in 
Section 5.3.4.3.  Otherwise, nivolumab administration should be delayed for the following: 
● Any ≥ Grade 2 non-skin, nivolumab-related AE, with the following exception: 
○ Grade 2 nivolumab-related fatigue or laboratory abnormalities, other than LFT 
abnormalities (see Section 5.3.4.3), do not require a treatment delay 
● Any Grade 3 skin, nivolumab- related AE  
● Any Grade 3 nivolumab-related laboratory abnormality, other than LFT abnormalities 
(see Section 5.3.4.3), with the following exceptions for lymphopenia or asymptomatic 
amylase or lipase:  
○ Grade 3 lymphopenia does not require dose delay 
○ Any ≥ Grade 3 nivolumab- related amylase or lipase abnormality that has been 
evaluated clinically and radiographically and is without evidence of pancreatitis 
does not require dose delay.  The medical monitor should be consulted for such 
≥ Grade 3 amylase or lipase abnormalities  
● Any AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the investigator, warrants delaying the dose of nivolumab 
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin ; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 29 of 91 Patients who require delay of nivolumab should be re- evaluated weekly o r more frequently if 
clinically indicated.  Nivolumab may be resumed at the next scheduled treatment cycle if the 
AE recovers to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline, with the following exceptions: 
● Patients may resume nivolumab treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fatigue 
● Patients who have not experienced a Grade 3 nivolumab- related skin AE may resume 
nivolumab treatment in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity 
● Nivolumab-related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis must have resolved to

Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 33 of 91 5.5.1  Required Concomitant Therapy  
Patients should be up- to-date on any recommended vaccinations prior to study entry.  
Additional vaccination(s) during each cycle of study treatment must be approved by the 
medical monitor.  
Required premedications to prevent infusion- related reactions  are described in Section 5.4.1 
and Section 5.4.2. 
5.5.2  Allowed Concomitant Therapy  
The use of platelet and/or RBC  supportive growth factors or transfusions when applicable is 
allowed.  The use of colony stimulating factors for the treatment of neutropenia per 
institutional practice is permitted during therapy.  
Patients who are receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitors concomitantly with brentuximab vedotin should be closely monitored for adverse reactions. 
Routine prophylaxis with vaccines is permitted prior to study entry; it is recommended that 
vaccines used do not contain live micro-organisms.  
Patients are permitted the use of topical, ocular, intra -articular, intranasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption).  Stable adrenal replacement steroid doses 
>10 mg daily prednisone, or prednisone equivalent, are permitted.  A brief (less than 
3 weeks) course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed- type hypersensitivity reaction caused by a 
contact allergen) is permitted.  Treatmen t with 0.5 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone IV (or 
oral equivalent), followed by a taper, is recommended for certain immune- mediated AEs; see 
Section 5.3.4.3 for dose modifications and relevant management algorithms in Appendix 3 of 
the nivolumab Investigator’s Brochure.  Treatment with 0.5 to 1 mg/kg corticosteroids, 
followed by taper, is recomme nded for Grade 2 or 3 creatinine elevation or nephritis. 
Peripheral blood stem cells may be mobilized following Cycle  4 at the discretion of the 
investigator.  However, stem cell collection may occur in prior cycles after discussion with 
the medical monito r.  Collection of peripheral blood stem cells for ASCT, if applicable, 
should occur per institutional standard of care.  If stem cell collection after Cycle 4 is inadequate, additional collection of peripheral blood stem cells for ASCT may be performed 
per institutional standards, if applicable.  
At the discretion of the treating physician, consolidative radiotherapy or consolidative treatment with single -agent brentuximab vedotin may be given post- ASCT.  
Allowed medications to manage infusion- related reactio ns are described in Section  5.6.1.1

Section 5.5.2. 
5.6 Management of Adverse Reactions  
5.6.1  Management of Infusion Reactions  
Infusion-related reactions may occur during the infusion of study treatment(s).  The infusion 
should be administered at a site properly equipped and staffed to manage anaphylaxis should it occur.  All supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care should be given throughout the study according to institutional standards.  Supportive measures may include 
extending the infusion time and/or administering medications for infusion -related reactions.  
Infusion or hypersensitivity reactions may occur to either brentuximab vedotin or nivolumab.  
If such a reaction were to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruritus, arthralgias, hypotension, hypertension, bronchospasm, or other allergic- like 
reactions.  Infusion reactions should be graded according to NCI CTCAE (Version 4.03) 
guidelines. 
5.6.1.1  Patients in Parts 1 and 2  
Premedication for the prevention of infusion reactions should be administered beginning with 
Cycle 2, at least 30 minutes prior to dosing study drug(s), and should include an antihistamine and low -dose corticosteroid , as described in Section 5.4.1.  If the onset of a 
reaction occurs during an infusion, the infusion may be interrupted for treatment of the infusion- related reaction, including treatment with antihistamines, corticosteroids, 
bronchodilator therapy, and/or antipyretics, as appropriate.  Patients who experience a 
Grade 3 infusion-related reaction to brentuximab vedotin or nivolumab may potentially receive additional treatment with the study drug(s) at the discretion of the investigator after 
discussion with the sponsor. 
If anaphylaxis or a Grade  4 infusion- related reaction occurs, administration of the implicated 
agent(s) (brentuximab vedotin and/or nivolumab) should be immediately and permanently 
discontinued. 
In case of late-occurring hypersensitivity symptoms to nivolumab (e.g., appearance of a 
localized or generalized pruritus within 1 week after nivolumab treatment), symptomatic 
treatment may be given (e.g., oral antihistamine or corticosteroids).  
5.6.1.2  Patients in Part 3  
For patients in Part 3, prophylactic premedication with antihistamines fo r prevention of 
infusion- related reactions is to be administered prior to combination treatment on Day 1 of 
each 21 -day cycle  as described in Section 5.4.2.  Patie nts who experience an infusion- related 
reaction with this premedication regimen should receive additional premedication with 
dexamethasone 0.2 mg/kg (maximum 10 mg IV  or equivalent) as well as the antihistamines  
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 35 of 91 as described in Section 5.4.2 for all subsequent cycles.  Additional premedication for 
symptom management (e.g., acetaminophen and/or ondansetron) may also be given at the discretion of the investigator.  If the onset of a reaction occurs during an infusion, the infusion may be interrupted for treatment of the infusion- related reaction, including treatment 
with antihistamines, corticosteroids, and/or bronchodilator therapy, as appropriate.  Patients who ex perience a Grade 3 infusion-related reaction to brentuximab vedotin or nivolumab 
may potentially receive additional treatment with the study drug(s) at the discretion of the 
investigator after discussion with the sponsor. 
If anaphylaxis or a Grade  4 infusion- related reaction occurs, administration of the implicated 
agent(s) (brentuximab vedotin and/or nivolumab) should be immediately and permanently 
discontinued. 
In case of late-occurring hypersensitivity symptoms to nivolumab (e.g., appearance of a 
localiz ed or generalized pruritus within 1 week after nivolumab treatment), symptomatic 
treatment may be given (e.g., oral antihistamine or corticosteroids).  
5.6.2  Management of Suspected Progressive Multifocal Leukoencepalopathy  
Signs and symptoms of PML may include a ltered mental status, motor deficits such as 
hemiparesis or ataxia, visual disturbances, or higher cortical dysfunction such as dysphasia or 
agnosia.  See the Investigator’s Brochure(s) for further details. 
If PML is suspected, hold further dosing of brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab and 
undertake a diagnostic work-up including (but not limited to): 
● Neurologic examinations, as warranted  
● Brain radiologic features by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  
● PCR analysis: John Cunningham virus (JCV) DNA detectable in cerebrospinal fluid  
 
If PML is confirmed, permanently discontinue treatment with brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab. 
5.6.3  Management of Immune -Adverse Events  
Immuno-oncology agents are associated with AEs that can differ in severity and duration 
from AEs caused by other therapeutic classes.  Nivolumab is considered an immuno-
oncology agent in this protocol.  Early recognition and management of AEs associated with immune -oncology agents may mitigate severe toxicity.  The following groups of AEs should 
be managed p er the algorithms found in Appendix 3 of the nivolumab Investigator’s 
Brochure : 
● Gastrointestinal 
● Renal  
● Pulmonary 
● Hepatic, with the following exceptions: 
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 36 of 91 ○ Patients with a baseline LFT level in the Grade  1 range (AST or ALT >ULN to 
3.0 x ULN and/or total bilirubin >ULN to 1.5 x ULN) should be managed by AE 
Grade -specified algorithms as applied to the absolute increase in AE Grade level 
above base line.  For example, management of a Grade 3 AST elevation for a patient who had a baseline AST level in the Grade 1 range would be per the 
Grade 2 algorithm.  
● Endocrinopathy 
● Skin 
● Neurological  
 
See Section 5.5.2 for allowed high- dose corticosteroid treatment.

7 STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
7.1 Screening/Baseline Assessments  
Only patients who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria specified in Section 4 will be 
enrolled in this study. 
Tissue samples will be sent to the central pathology lab for disease confirmation and further 
evaluation of CD30 and PD -L1 expression. 
Patient medical history includes a thorough review of significant past medical history, 
current conditions, any treatment for prior malignancies and response to prior treatment, and any concomitant medications.  Included with medical history is a review of any inflammatory conditions; patients with certain inflammatory conditions of interest at Screening/Baseline 
will have an additional review at the EOT  visit.  
Pulmonary function tests are required for all patients at screening.  DLCO over 60% 
(adjusted for hemoglobin) must be confirmed by a pulmonary function test prior to study 
enrollment.  
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 42 of 91 7.2 Response/Efficacy Assessments  
7.2.1  Parts 1 and 2  
For patients in Parts 1 and 2, the determination of antitumor activity will be based on 
response assess ments made according to the Lugano Classification Revised Staging System 
for malignant lymphoma (Cheson 2014) and treatment decisions by the investigator will be 
based on these assessments.  
Staging will be performed by PET and CT of diagnostic quality, with disease involvement determined by focal fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) uptake in nodal and extranodal sites  
(including spleen, liver, bone marrow, and thyroid) that is consistent with lymphoma, according to the pattern of uptake and/or CT characteristics.  Up to six of the largest nodes, 
nodal masses, or other involved lesions that are measurable in two diameters should be identified as target lesions; if possible they should be from disparate regions of the body, and they should include me diastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are 
involved. 
At Cycle  2 (Day 15 + 6 days), a CT scan of diagnostic quality will be performed to assess for 
PD; a limited scan that includes sites of disease identified at baseline is acceptable.  For 
subsequent response assessments, both PET and CT scans will be requir ed until the patient 
achieves a CmR by PET assessment.  After the patient achieves a CmR by PET, response will be followed by CT scans of diagnostic quality only.  For PET- based assessments, a 
clinical response of progressive metabolic disease (PmD), no metabolic response (NmR), partial metabolic response (PmR), or CmR will be determined.  If only CT- based assessment 
is performed, response will be categorized as PD, SD, PR, or CR.  PmD/PD includes radiological evidence of progression per Lugano Classification Revised Staging System for malignant lymphoma  (Cheson 2014).  If clinical progression is determined by the 
investigator, radiographic staging should also be performed to determine response assessment per Lugano Classification Revised Staging System for malignant lymphoma.  The PET scan metabolic uptake will be graded using the Deauville  5-point scal e (Biggi 2013) 
(Barrington 2010) with a score of ≤3 considered to represent a CmR. 
Patients’ clinical data must be available for CRF source verification.  Copies of tumor images 
must be made available for review by the sponsor (or its designee), upon request. 
7.2.2  Part 3  
For patients in Part 3, the determination of antitumor activity will be assessed using the 
Lugano Classification Revised Staging System for malignant lymphoma (Cheson 2014) with 
the incorporation of LYRIC  (Appendix D ) (Cheson 2016).  T reatment decisions by the 
investigator will be based on these assessments.  Staging will be performed by PET/CT of diagnostic quality, with disease involvement determined by focal FDG uptake in nodal and extranodal sites (including spleen, liver, bone marrow, and thyroid) that is consistent with 
lymphoma according to the pattern of uptake and/or CT characteristics.  Up to six of the largest nodes, nodal masses, or other involved lesions that are measurable in two diameters 
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 43 of 91 should be identified as target lesions at baseline.  If possible, target lesions should be from 
different regions of the body, and they should include mediast inal and retroperitoneal areas 
of disease whenever these sites are involved.  
At Cycle  2 (Day 15 + 6 days), a CT scan of diagnostic quality will be performed to assess for 
PD; a limited scan that includes sites of disease identified at baseline is acceptable.   For all 
other response assessments, a clinical response of PD, SD, PR, or CR will be determined unless tumor flare or pseudo-progression is suspected.  If tumor flare or pseudoprogression is not suspected, PD is defined by radiological evidence of prog ression  according to the Lugano 
criteria  (Cheson 2014).  If clinical progression is determined by the investigator, radiographic 
staging should also be performed to determine response assessment per Lugano classification criteria.  The PET scan metabolic uptake will be graded using the Deauville 5 -point scale 
(Barrington 2010; Biggi 2013), with a score of ≤3 considered to represent a complete 
metabolic response.   Except for the Cycle 2 response assessment, both PET and CT scanning 
will be required until disease is PET negative; responses will then be followed by CT scan of 
diagnostic quality only. 
If tumor flare or pseudo-progression is suspected by the investigator during treatment, then a 
clinical response of indeterminate response (IR) will be determined until subsequent 
evaluation of radiographic imaging or biopsy confirms or refutes PD.  IR is defined 
according to the following: 
1. An increase in ov erall tumor burden (as assessed by the sum of the products of the largest 
diameter [SPD]) of ≥50% of up to 6 measurable lesions in the first 12 weeks of therapy, 
without clinical deterioration ; 
2. Appearance of new lesions, or growth of one or more existing lesion(s) ≥50% at any time 
during treatment, occurring in the context of lack of overall progression (<50% increase) of overall tumor burden, as measured by SPD of up to 6 lesions at any time during 
treatment; and  
3. An increase in FDG uptake using the 5-Point Scale per the Deauville Criteria of one or 
more lesion(s) without a concomitant increase in lesion size or number. 
See Appendix D  for further details and criteria for follow -up of a determination of IR. 
For patients with  an IR, investigators should use clinical judgement to determine the 
appropriate course of action for further evaluation.  Repeat imaging should be performed 
accordi ng to the Schedule of Events ( or sooner if clinically indicated ), and PD must be 
confirmed or refuted based on LYRIC follow- up criteria for IR (Cheson 2016).  In addition, 
biopsy of sites of disease involvement should be strongly considered . 
If a patient has a second determination of IR, then subsequent repeat imaging should be performed between 4 and 8 weeks (or earlier if clinically indicated) .  Follow-up radiographic 
assessment  for patients with IR is not required if a follow-up biops y has been performed that 
confirms  the patient's  response. 
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 44 of 91 Patients’ clinical data must be available for CRF source verification.  All imaging studies 
must be copied to CDs and provided to the sponsor.  At the end of the study, the images may 
either be sent to a central radiology facility for confirmation of disease response or destroyed.  
7.3 Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity Assessments

Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 50 of 91 7.4.1  Tumor Biopsies  
Formalin fixed paraffin -embedded tumor tissue blocks taken after relapse of prior therapy 
will be collected at screening to assess biomarkers implicated in sensitivity or resistance to 
brentuximab vedotin and/or nivolumab (e.g., CD30 expression, PD- L1/L2 amplification , and 
expression).  If tumor tissue block is not available, a minimum of approximately 20 unstained charged slides of the tumor tissue will be required.  If multiple blocks are available, the one 
with the highest tumor content is preferred.  If archival tumor tissues (i.e., tumor tissue obtained at the time of the patient’s original diagnosis and/or at the time of subsequent procedures conducted as part of the patient’s stand ard care) are available, they will be 
collected under the same criteria to understand the impact of prior treatment on CD30 and PD-L1/L2 expression.  If any tissue remains, the tumor pathology block may be returned to 
the original site by the Sponsor or designee at the end of the study upon request.  See the 
Laboratory Manual for details.  
Efforts should be made to take additional biops ies in patients who demonstrate disease 
progression, indeterminate response on study, or residual disease at the EOT visit.  These 
optional samples are to be tested for the expression of CD30 and PD-L1/L2 expression and 
other potential markers to understand potential delayed response and/or resistance 
mechanism.  
Assessments may include histopathology and immunohistochemistry of tumor biopsies for: 
● Expression of PD-L1/L2, CD30, immune cell markers and expression of other 
immune checkpoint molecules in malignant Reed -Sternberg cells and tumor 
infiltrating lymphocytes by IHC, as well as amplification of 9p24.1  
● Tumor infiltrating ly mphocytes (CD3, CD4, CD8, Foxp3+ and ratios thereof) 
● Expression of CD30 and PD-1 among T, B, macrophage and myeloid cell populations 
including, but not limited to CD4, CD8, Foxp3, CD68, and CD163 
● Amplification and expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 by malignant Reed -Sternberg 
cells and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes  
● Expression (by RNA or protein) of other immune checkpoint molecules, including, but not limited to Galectin -1, if an assay becomes available  
● Epstein -Barr Virus infection status if not previously known 
● Expression analysis of 23-gene predictor for outcome post- ASCT in c lassical HL 
7.5 Biospecimen Repository  
In the US only, for patients who provide additional consent, remaining de-identified unused 
blood and/or tissue will be retained by Seattle Genetics and  used for future research, 
including but not limited to the evaluation of targets for novel therapeutic agents, the biology of ADC sensitivity and resistance mechanisms, and to identify pharmacodynamic biomarkers of ADCs.  Blood and tissue samples donated for future research will be retained for a period of up to 25 years.  If additional consent is not provided, any remaining biological samples 
will be destroyed following study completion. 
 
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 51 of 91 7.6 Safety Assessments  
The assessment of safety during the course of this study will consist of the surveillance and 
recording of adverse events (AEs) including serious adverse events (SAEs), recording of concomitant medication and measurements of protocol- specified physical examination 
findings, pulse oximetry tests, and laboratory tests.  
Safety will be monitored over the course of the study by an SMC as described in 
Section  9.3.9. 
7.6.1  Adverse Events 
7.6.1.1  Definitions  
Adverse Event  
According to the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E2A guideline Definitions 
and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and 21 CFR 312.32, Investigational New Drug (IND) Safety Reporting, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have 
a causal relationship with this treatment.  
The following information should be considered when determining whether or not to record a 
test result, medical condition, or other incident on the Adverse Events and Pre- existing 
Conditions CRF: 
● From the time of informed consent through the day prior to study Day 1, only study protocol-related AEs should be recorded.  A protocol- related AE is defined as an 
untoward medical event occurring as a result of a protocol mandated procedure. 
● All medical conditions present or ongoing predose on study Day 1 should be 
recorded.  
● All AEs (regardless of relationship to study drug) should be recorded from study 
Day 1 (predose ) through the end of the safety reporting period (see Section 7.6.1.3).  
Complications that occur in association with any procedure (e.g., biopsy) should be 
recorded as AEs whether or not the procedure was protocol mandated. 
● Changes in medical conditions and AEs, including changes in severity, frequency, or character, during the safety reporting period should be recorded. 
● In general, an abnormal laboratory value should not be recorded as an AE unless it is 
associated with clinical signs or symptoms, requires an intervention, results in a SAE, or results in study termination or interruption/discontinuation of study treatment.  When recording an AE resulting from a laboratory abnormality, the resulting medical condition rather than the abnormality itself should be recorded (e.g., record “anemia” 
rather than “low hemoglobin”). 
 
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab ve dotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 52 of 91 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE should be classified as an SAE if it meets one of the following criteria: 
Fatal:  AE resulted in death  
 
Life threatening:  The AEs placed the patient at immediate risk of death. This classification does not 
apply to an AE that hypothetically might cause death if it were more severe.  
 
Hospitalization:  The AE required or prolonged an existing inpatient hospitalization. Hospitalizations 
for elective medical or surgical procedures or treatments planned before the signing 
of informed consent in the study or routine check -ups are not SAEs by this criterion. 
Admission to a palliative unit or hospice care facility is not considered to be a 
hospitalization.  Hospitalizations or prolonged hospitalizations for scheduled 
therapy of the underlying cancer or study target disease need not be captured as 
SAEs.  
 
Disabl ing/incapacitating:  Resulted in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
 
Congenital anomaly or 
birth defect:  An adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a patient exposed to  the molecule or study 
treatment regimen before conception or during pregnancy.  
 
Medically significant:  The AE did not meet any of the above criteria, but could have jeopardized the 
patient and might have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above or involves suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent.  
Adverse Event Severity  
AE severity should be graded using the NCI CTCAE, version 4.03.  These criteria are 
provided in the study manual. 
AE severity and seriousness are assessed independently.  ‘Severity’ characterizes the 
intensity of an AE.  ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the sponsor 
for defining regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for Serious Adverse Events). 
 
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 53 of 91 Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Treatment  
The relationship of each AE to each study treatment (brentuximab vedotin, nivolumab) 
should be evaluated by the investigator using the following criteria: 
Related:  There is evidence  to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE, such 
as: 
● an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug 
exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome)  
● an event that is not commonly associated w ith drug exposure, but is otherwise 
uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture)  
Unrelated:  Another cause of the AE is more plausible (e.g., due to underlying disease or occurs 
commonly in the study population), or a temporal sequence cannot be established 
with the onset of the AE and administration of the study treatment, or a causal 
relationship is considered biologically implausible  
 
The Investigator’s B rochures  for brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab individually describe 
adverse events commonly observed relative to either agent (i.e., neutropenia or peripheral 
neuropathy with brentuximab vedotin; immune-mediated adverse events with nivolumab), as 
well as less common serious findings.  The respective Investigator’s B rochure  should be 
referenced when attributing causality; however, the final decision regarding causality is at the 
discretion of the investigator. 
7.6.1.2  Procedures for Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events  
Investigator and study personnel will report all AEs and SAEs whether elicited during patient 
questioning, discovered during physical examination, laboratory testing and/or other means 
by recording them on the CRF and/or SAE form, as appropriate. 
Eliciting Adverse Events  
An open-ended or non-directed method of questioning should be used at each study visit to 
elicit the reporting of AEs.  
Recording Adverse Events  
The following information should be recorded on the Adverse Events and Pre- existing 
Conditions CRF: 
● Description including onset and resolution dates 
● Whether it met serious criteria  
● Severity  
● Relationship to study treatment or other causality  
● Outcome 
Diagnosis versu s Signs or Symptoms 
In general, the use of a unifying diagnosis is preferred to the listing out of individual 
symptoms.  Grouping of symptoms into a diagnosis should only be done if each component sign and/or symptom is a medically confirmed component of a diagnosis as evidenced by 
 
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 54 of 91 standard medical textbooks.  If any aspect of a sign or symptom does not fit into a classic 
pattern of the diagnosis, report the individual symptom as a separate AE. 
Adverse reactions associated with the infusion of study drugs must be recorded as both the 
NCI CTCAE term for infusion- related reaction (e.g., cytokine release syndrome, acute 
infusion reaction, or allergic or hypersensitivity reaction) and with each sign or symptom recorded as an individual adverse event.  Level of severity for both the overall infusion-
related reaction term and the individual signs and symptoms should also be recorded. 
Recording Serious Adverse Events  
For SAEs, record the event(s) on both the CRF and the SAE form. 
The following should be considered when recording SAEs: 
● Death is an outcome of an event.  The event that resulted in the death should be 
recorded and reported on both an SAE form and CRF. 
● For hospitalizations, surgical, or diagnostic procedures, the illness leading to the 
surgical or diagnostic procedure should be recorded as the SAE, not the procedure itself.  The procedure should be captured in the narrative as part of the action taken in 
response to the illness. 
Progression of the Underlying Cancer  
Do not use the term ‘disease progression’ alone when reporting AEs, including SAEs, 
because it is too nonspecific.  Symptoms of disease progression that meet the criteria for an SAE must be reported.  When possible, report the specific disease (clinical) manifestation of the progression (e.g., “malignant pleural effusion”, “spinal bone metastases”, “lymphadenopathy”, “brain metastases”).  Otherwise, it is acceptable to report the specific 
disease (e.g., non-Hodgkin lymphoma) as an SAE. 
Pregnancy  
Notification to Drug Safety: complete a Pregnancy Report Form for all pr egnancies that 
occur from the time of first study drug dose until 6 months after the last dose of brentuximab 
vedotin or 8 months after the last dose of nivolumab, whichever is later, including any pregnancies that occur in the partner of a male study pati ent.  Only report pregnancies that 
occur in a male patient’s partner if the estimated date of conception is after the male patient’s first study drug(s) dose.  Email or fax to the sponsor’s Drug Safety Department within 48 hours of becoming aware of a pregnancy.  All pregnancies will be monitored for the full duration; all perinatal and neonatal outcomes should be reported.  Infants should be followed 
for a minimum of 8 weeks. 
Collection of data on the CRF: a ll pregnancies (as described above) that occur wi thin 
6 months after the last dose of brentuximab vedotin or 8 months of the last dose of 
nivolumab, whichever is later, will also be recorded on the Adverse Events and Pre- Existing 
Conditions CRF. 
 
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 55 of 91 Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous, should be reported as an SAE.  
Congenital anomalies or birth defects, as defined by the ‘serious’ criterion above (see 
definitions Section 7.6.1.1) should be reported as SAEs. 
7.6.1.3  Reporting Periods for Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
The safety reporting period for all AEs and SAEs is from study Day 1 (predose) through the 
EOT visit or 30 days after the last brentuximab vedotin dose or 100 days after the last nivolumab dose, whichever is later.  However, all study protocol- related AEs are to be 
recorded from the time of informed consent.  All SAEs that occur after the safety reporting period and are considered study treatment-related in the opinion of the investigator should 
also be reported to the sponsor. 
SAEs will be followed until significant changes return to baseline, the event stabilizes 
(recovering/resolving) or is no longer considered clinically significant by the investigator, or the pat ient dies or withdraws consent.  All non-serious AEs will be followed through the 
safety reporting period.  Certain non-serious AEs of interest may be followed until 
resolution, return to baseline, or study closure. 
7.6.1.4  Serious Adverse Events Require Immediate Reporting 
Within 24 hours of observing or learning of an SAE, investigators are to report the event to 
the sponsor, regardless of the relationship of the event to the study treatment regimen. 
For initial SAE reports, available case details are to be recor ded on an SAE form. At a 
minimum, the following should be included: 
● Patient number 
● Date of event onset  
● Description of the event 
● Study treatment, if known 
 
The completed SAE form and SAE Fax Cover Sheet are to be emailed or faxed to the 
sponsor’s Drug Safety Department within 24 hours (see email address or fax number specified on the SAE report form) unless otherwise instructed on the Sponsor’s SAE form.  Relevant follow-up information is to be submitted to the sponsor as soon as it becomes 
available.  
7.6.1.5  Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities  
Investigators are required to report all SAEs, including anticipated SAEs, to the sponsor (see Section 7.6.1.4).  
The sponsor will report all SAEs to regulatory authorities as required per local regulatory 
reporting requirements.  In the United States, endpoints that assess disease- related mortality 
or major morbidity as well as other SAEs that are not stud y endpoints, but are known 
consequences of the underlying disease or condition that are anticipated to occur in the study population should not be reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as individual 
 
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 56 of 91 IND safety reports per the final rule amendi ng the IND safety reporting requirements under 
21 CFR 312.32 and the FDA’s guidance Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and 
Bioavailability (BA) and Bioequivalence (BE) Studies (December 2012). 
In this study, the SAEs that do not require individual IND safety reports to the FDA are 
progression of the underlying cancer and SAEs related to the mobilization of stem cells for ASCT.  These anticipated SAEs will be reviewed periodically by an SMC and Seattle Genetics Drug Safety Department.  If, upon review, an SAE is occurring at a higher rate than that which would be expected for HL patients being treated with either study treatment (brentuximab vedotin or nivolumab), then an IND safety report for the SAE will be 
submitted to the FDA.  
7.6.2  Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Samples will be drawn for local and central labs.  Local laboratory testing will be used for 
evaluating safety and making clinical decisions.  The following laboratory assessments will be performed by both the local and central lab to evaluate safety at scheduled timepoints (see 
Appendix A ) during the course of the study: 
● The chemistry panel is to include the following tests: albumin, alkaline phosphatase, 
ALT , AST, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, creatinine, chloride, lactate dehydrogenase, 
phosphorus, potassium, sodium, total bilirubin, amylase, lipase, and gamma- glutamyl 
transpeptidase, serum glucose , and uric acid.  Additionally, TSH, free T3, and free T4 
must also be tested at Cycle 1, Cycle 3, and EOT. 
● The CBC with differential is to include the following tests: white blood cell count with five -part differential (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and 
basophils), platelet count, RBC  count, bands and blasts, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. 
The following additional laboratory assessment(s) will be performed by local laboratories at 
the designated timepoints (see Appendix A ): 
● Hepatitis B and C serologies; if hepatitis C serology is positive, HCV RNA test by PCR is required to confirm 
● Epstein -Barr virus serology  
● A serum or urine β-hCG pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential 
7.6.3  Physical Examinati on 
Physical examinations should include assessments of the following body parts/systems: 
abdomen, extremities, head, heart, lungs, neck, and neurological.  Measurements of height 
obtained within the prior 12 months may be utilized.

Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 57 of 91 7.6.4  Other Safety Assessment  
7.6.4.1  Pulmonary -related signs or symptoms  
Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry should be obtained prior to each dose of nivolumab and 
at any time a patient has any new or worsening respiratory symptoms.  A reading at rest and on exertion should be obtained at each time point.  The extent of the exertion should be based on the judgment of the investigator, but should remain consistent for each individual patient throughout the study.  However, if the patient’s status changes, the investigator can alter the extent o f exertion based upon their medical judgment.  If a patient shows changes on pulse 
oximetry or other pulmonary-related signs (e.g., hypoxia, fever) or symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, cough) consistent with possible pulmonary adverse events, the patient should be immediately evaluated to rule out pulmonary toxicity.  An algorithm for the management of suspected pulmonary toxicity can be found in Appendix 3 of the nivolumab Investigator ’s Brochure.  
See Section 5.3.4 for nivolumab dose modifications and Section 5.5.2 for allowed 
concomitant therapy for pulmonary-related signs or symptoms. 
7.7 Appropriateness of Measurements  
The safety measures that will be used in this trial are considered standard procedures for 
evaluating the potential adverse effects of study medications.  
ATA is commonly assessed for biolo gics; therefore, standard tests will be performed to 
detect the possible presence of specific antibodies to brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab.  Pharmacokinetic assessments for drug activity are also common in clinical studies.  
8 DATA QUALITY CONTROL  AND QUAL ITY ASSURANCE  
8.1 Site Training and Monitoring Procedures  
A study manual with instructions for study compliance and CRF completion will be 
provided.  Prior to the enrollment of patients at the site, Seattle Genetics or its designated clinical and medical perso nnel will review the following items with the investigator and 
clinic staff:  
● The protocol, study objectives, eligibility requirements, study procedures, 
registration , and withdrawal processes 
● Current Investigator’s Brochure/ package insert 
● Recording and reporting AE and SAE

keeping  
● Patient coding and randomization (if applicable) 
● Study samples/specimen collection, handling and shipping 
● Protocol compliance 
● Clinical study record keeping, document retention, and administrative requirements 
Monitoring visits will occur periodically, with frequency dependent on the rate of enrollment 
and workload at each site.  During monitoring visits, the Seattle Genetics representative will 
review regulatory documentation, CRFs, source documentation, and investigational product storage, preparation, and accountability.  The CRFs will be reviewed for c ompleteness, 
adherence to the provided guidelines, and accuracy compared to the source documents.  The investigators must ensure that the monitor is allowed to inspect all source documents pertinent to study patients, and must cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems noted in the course of the trial are resolved.  The investigator must maintain a comprehensive and centralized filing system of all study -related documentation that is suitable for inspection 
by Seattle Genetics or its designated monitors and by quality assurance auditors, or 
representatives of regulatory authorities. 
8.2 Data Management Procedures  
Seattle Genetics will provide CRF Completion Guidelines for electronic CRF (eCRF) data 
entry.  Study specific data management procedures wi ll be maintained in the data 
management plan.  Queries resulting from edit checks and/or data verification procedures 
will be posted electronically in the eCRF.  
8.3 Access to Source Data 
The investigator will permit the sponsor’s representatives to monitor the study as frequently 
as the sponsor deems necessary to determine that protocol adherence and data recording are satisfactory.  Appropriate measures to protect patient confidentiality are to be employed during monitoring.  The CRFs and related source docume nts will be reviewed in detail by the 
monitor at each site visit.  Original source documents or certified copies are needed for review.  This review includes inspection of data acquired as a requirement for participation in this study and other medical records as required to confirm that the information contained in the CRFs, such as disease assessments, AEs, and concomitant medications, is complete and correct.  Other study records, such as correspondence with the sponsor and the IRB/IEC and screening and drug accountability logs will also be inspected.  All source data and study 
 
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 59 of 91 records must also be available for inspection by representatives of regulatory authorities and 
IRB/IEC.  
8.4 Accuracy and Reliability of Data 
Steps to be taken to assure the accuracy an d reliability of data include: 
● The selection of qualified investigators and appropriate study centers. 
● Review of protocol procedures with the investigators and associated personnel prior to the study. 
● Periodic monitoring visits by the designated monitor(s) . 
● CRFs will be reviewed for accuracy and completeness by the designated monitor(s) 
during monitoring visits to the study centers.  Any discrepancies will be resolved with 
the investigator or designees as appropriate.  
8.5 Quality Assurance Procedures  
The Resear ch and Development Quality Assurance group or its designee may conduct audits 
at the clinical site or other study -related facilities and organizations.  Audit reports will be 
retained by the Research and Development Quality Assurance group of Seattle Genetics as part of the written record.  
8.6 Data Handling and Record Keeping 
8.6.1  Data Handling  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and 
timeliness of the data reported to the sponsor in the CRFs and in all required r eports.  Data 
reported on the CRF that is derived from source documents should be consistent with the 
source documents or the discrepancies should be explained. 
Any change or correction to a CRF will be maintained in an audit trail within the electronic 
data capture system.  Data changes may only be made by those individuals so authorized.  The investigator should retain records of the changes and corrections, written and/or 
electronic.  
8.6.2  Investigator Record Retention 
The investigator shall retain study drug disposition records and all source documentation 
(such as original ECG tracings, laboratory reports, inpatient or office patient records) for the maximum period required by the country and Institution in which the study will be conducted, or for the period specified by Seattle Genetics, whichever is longer.  The investigator must contact Seattle Genetics prior to destroying any records associated with the study.  If the investigator withdraws from the study (due to relocation, retirement, etc), the records shall be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee, such as another investigator 
or IRB/IEC.  Notice of such transfer will be provided in writing to Seattle Genetics.

9.1 Determination of Sample Size  
It is anticipated that a total of  approximately 55 patients will be enrolled in Parts 1 and 2 of 
the study.  This number was chosen in order to enable an adequately powered analysis of the 
primary endpoint of CR rate and to characterize the safety profile of the combination treatment.  This number will be greater if multiple dose regimens are investigated in Part 1 of the study as only those patients from Part 1 who are treated with the dose regimen chosen for 
Part 2 will be included in the analysis of the primary endpoint. 
The sample size needed to provide adequate power to test the primary endpoint is at least 53.  
With this sample size a one -sided exact binomial test at level α=0.05 will reject the null 
hypothesis of a CR rate less than or equal to 30% approximately 90% of the time when the true CR rate is 50%.  For the given parameters the null will be rejected when 22 or more CRs 
are observed (i.e., CR rate ≥41.5% is observed). 
For the safety assessment of the combination treatment, a sample size of 55 patients will 
provide a 94% chance of observing at least one occurrence of an adverse event with a true 
event rate of 5%.  
For Part 3, no formal hypothesis test is specified.  The sample size of 30 patients was chosen 
to allow adequate precision of estimates for response rates  and safety data.   For example, if 
63% (19/30) of patients have a CR, then the 95% exact CI is (44%, 80%).  The s ample size  
of 30 patients is sufficient to perform exploratory biomarker analyses. 
East 5.4 was used to perform sample size calculations. 
9.2 Study Endpoint Definitions  
9.2.1  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
9.2.1.1  Complete Response (CR) Rate  
CR rate is defined as the proportion of patients with best response of CR prior to ASCT or 
initiation of subsequent antitumor treatment not specified in the protocol.  In Parts 1 and 2, response will be determined by investigator assessment according to the Lugano 
Classification Revised Staging System for malignant lymphoma (Cheson 2014); see Section 
7.2 for details of the modified criteria.  For Part 3, response will be determined by investigator  assessment  according to the Lugano Classified Revised Staging System (Cheson 
2014) with the incorporation of LYRIC ( Appendix D ) (Cheson 2016).  Patients whose 
response to treatment cannot be adequately assessed according to the specified criteria will 
be classified as no n-responders for the purpose of calculating CR rate.

Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 61 of 91 9.2.2  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
9.2.2.1  Objective Response Rate (ORR)  
ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with best response of CR or PR prior to ASCT 
or initiation of subsequent antitumor treatment not specified in the protocol.  Response is by investigator assessment according to the Lugano Classification Revised Staging System for malignant lymphoma (Cheson 2014); see Section 7.2 for details of the modified criteria.  
Patients whose response to treatment cannot be adequately assessed according to the 
specified criteria will be classified as non -responders for the purpose of calculating ORR. 
9.2.2.2  Progression- Free Survival (PFS) after AS CT 
PFS after ASCT is defined as the time from ASCT to the first documentation of PD or to 
death due to any cause, whichever comes first.  Patients who do not undergo ASCT will not be included in the analysis of this endpoint.  Documentation of PD must be c onsistent with 
the criteria described in Section 7.2.  Specifically, PFS will be calculated as:  
 PFS = Date of first documented PD or death – Date of ASCT + 1.  
PFS data will be censored as described below:  
● Patients who do not have PD and are still on study at the time of an analysis will be censored at the date of the most recent disease assessment prior to the analysis which 
was adequate to document PD  
● Patients who have started an antitumor treatment (excluding high -dose conditioning 
regimens pre -ASCT, consolidative radiotherapy pre- or post-ASCT, or consolidative 
treatment with single -agent brentuximab vedotin post-ASCT) other than the study 
treatmen t prior to documented PD will be censored at the date of the most recent 
disease assessment which was adequate to document PD prior to start of new therapy 
● Patients who are removed from study prior to documentation of PD will be censored 
at the date of the most recent disease assessment prior to study discontinuation which 
was adequate to document PD. 
If a patient does not have any adequate disease assessments after ASCT their PFS will be censored at one day. 
9.2.2.3  Duration of Response  
Duration of response is def ined as the time from start of the first documentation of OR (CR 
or PR) to the first documentation of PD or to death due to any cause, whichever comes first.  
Duration of response will only be calculated for the group of patients achieving an objective response while on study.  Documentation of PD must be consistent with the criteria described 
in Section 7.2.  Duration of response data will be censore d as described below:  
 
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 62 of 91 ● Patients who do not have PD and are still on study at the time of an analysis will be 
censored at the date of the most recent disease assessment prior to the analysis which 
was adequate to document PD 
● Patients who have started an anti tumor treatment (excluding stem cell transplant or 
post-ASCT consolidative therapy) other than the study treatment prior to documented 
PD will be censored at the date of the most recent disease assessment prior to start of 
new therapy which was adequate to  document PD 
● Patients who are removed from study prior to documentation of PD will be censored 
at the date of the most recent disease assessment prior to study discontinuation which 
was adequate to document PD. 
If a patient does not have any disease assessments adequate to detect PD after the first documentation of objective response, their duration of response will be censored at one day. 
An additional exploratory analysis of PFS may be conducted in which clinical assessment 
will be considered adequate to detect disease progression. Other exploratory analyses of PFS may also be performed.  These analyses may involve different definitions of events and/or 
different censoring rules; details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan ( SAP). 
9.2.3  Additional Efficacy Endpoints  
9.2.3.1  Overall Survival (OS)  
Overall survival is defined as the time from date of enrollment to date of death due to any 
cause.  In the absence of confirmation of death, overall survival time will be censored at the last date the patient is know n to be alive.  Patients lacking data beyond the date of enrollment 
will have their overall survival time censored to 1 day. 
9.2.3.2  PFS 
PFS is defined as the time from enrollment to the first documentation of PD or to death due 
to any cause, whichever comes first.  Documentation of PD must be consistent with the 
criteria described in Section 7.2.  Specifically, PFS will be calculated as:  
 PFS = Date of first documented PD or death – Date of enrollment + 1. 
PFS data will be censored as described below:  
● Patients who do not have PD and are still on study at the time of an analysis will be 
censored at the date of the most recent disease assessment prior to the analysis that 
was adequate to document PD 
● Patients who have started an antitumor treatment (excluding high -dose conditioning 
regim ens pre-ASCT, consolidative radiotherapy pre- or post-ASCT, or consolidative 
treatment with single -agent brentuximab vedotin post-ASCT) other than the study 
treatment prior to documented PD will be censored at the date of the most recent disease assessment  that was adequate to document PD prior to start of new therapy

If a patient does not have any adequate disease assessments after enrollment their PFS will be censored at one day. 
An additional exploratory analysis of PFS may be conducted in which clinical assessment 
will be considered adequate to detect disease progression.  Other exploratory analyses of PFS 
may also be performed.  These analyses may involve different definitions of events and/or 
different censoring rules; details will be provided in the SAP. 
9.3 Statistical and Analytical Plans  
The statistical and a nalytical plans presented below summarize the more complete plans to be 
detailed in the SAP.  A change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will 
require a protocol amendment only if it alters site conduct (e.g., adding baseline assessment s 
to define a subgroup).  The SAP will be finalized prior to database lock.  Any changes to the 
methods described in the final SAP will be described and justified in the clinical study report. 
9.3.1  General Considerations  
This is a phase 1/2 open- label study with a formal statistical hypothesis for the primary 
efficacy endpoint of CR rate.  There are no formal pre- specified hypotheses associated with 
the primary safety objective.  
In general, descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maxim um) 
will be used to summarize continuous variables collected. Frequencies and percentages will 
be used when presenting categorical variables.  Summaries will be presented overall and by 
dose regimen unless otherwise specified. 
9.3.1.1  Randomization and Blinding 
No randomization will be carried out and no blinding will be enforced as this is an open- label 
trial. 
9.3.1.2  Adjustments for Covariates  
Adjustment for covariates will not take place for analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint of 
CR rate.  Subgroup analyses and st ratified analyses may be carried out for particular 
covariates of interest.  Exploratory analysis of biomarker and pharmacodynamic endpoints 
may also incorporate covariate adjustment.  
9.3.1.3  Handling of Dropouts and Missing Data  
Missing data will not be imputed, with the exception of AE dates while calculating duration 
of events. Patients with missing values of a variable other than response endpoints (CR and 
ORR) and time -to-event endpoints (PFS and OS) will be excluded from the analysis of that 
endpoint.  Patien ts whose disease response cannot be assessed will be scored as non-
responders for calculating the CR rate and ORR.  Censoring rules will be applied to the 
 
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 64 of 91 estimation of the distribution of the time -to-event endpoints; details will be provided in the 
SAP.  
9.3.1.4  Multicenter Studies  
Due to the size of the trial and the number of study sites, it is not anticipated that any one site 
will accrue enough patients to warrant an analysis by site.  
9.3.1.5  Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity  
No adjustment for multiplicity is plann ed as there is only a single planned hypothesis test of 
the primary efficacy endpoint. 
9.3.1.6  Data Transformations and Derivations 
Age in years will be calculated with the SAS INTCK function using informed consent date 
and birth date. 
Study Day will be calculated  as Date – First Dose Date + 1 for dates on or after the first dose 
date.  For dates prior to the first dose date, Study Day will be calculated as Date – First Dose 
Date.  For all calculations of Study Day, the First Dose Date will be the earliest date of 
treatment administration for brentuximab vedotin.  
Other time variables based on two dates, e.g., Start Date and End Date, will be calculated as 
(End Date – Start Date + 1) (in days) unless otherwise specified in the planned analysis 
section.  
The following unit conversion will be implemented unless otherwise specified: 
 Months = Days / 30.4375 
 Years = Days / 365.25 
Baseline values used in all analyses will be the most recent non -missing measurement prior 
to the first dose of study drug. The EOT date will be  the date the EOT visit is performed, or 30 days after the last dose of 
study drug if an EOT visit is not performed. 
For efficacy assessments, the date of response will be the latest of all radiologic scan dates 
for the given disease assessment.  The date of progression will be the earliest of all radiologic 
scan dates for the given restage assessment.  
9.3.1.7  Analysis Sets  
All Enrolled Patients Analysis Set  
The All Enrolled Patients analysis set includes all patients enrolled in the study.  The All Enrolled Patien ts set will be used for the primary efficacy analysis.  Secondary and additional 
efficacy endpoints will also be analyzed using this analysis set. 
 
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 65 of 91 All Treated Patients Analysis Set  
The All Treated Patients analysis set includes all patients who receive any  amount of 
brentuximab vedotin or nivolumab.  The All Treated Patients set will be used for presentation 
of safety data and may be used for exploratory analyses of efficacy endpoints.  
Efficacy Evaluable Analysis Set  
The Efficacy Evaluable analysis set incl udes all patients who had an adequate baseline 
disease assessment, received any amount of either drug, and subsequently had an adequate 
response assessment.  The Efficacy Evaluable set will be used for exploratory analysis of 
efficacy endpoints. 
9.3.1.8  Examinatio n of Subgroups  
As exploratory analyses, subgroup analyses may be conducted for selected endpoints.  
Detailed methodology will be provided in the SAP. 
9.3.1.9  Timing of Analyses  
Analysis of the primary endpoint will be carried out after all patients have had their EOT  
assessment s.  Interim summaries of various endpoints may be presented at scientific 
congresses prior to the final analysis of the primary endpoint.  Interim summaries will also be 
presented to the SMC.  Database cutoff will be determined after all patients have completed 
treatment.  
9.3.2  Patient Disposition 
An accounting of study patients by disposition will be tabulated and the number of patients in 
each analysis set will be summarized.  Patients who discontinue study treatment and patients who withdraw from the study will be summarized with reason for discontinuation or 
withdrawal.  
9.3.3  Patient Characteristics  
Demographics and other baseline characteristics will be summarized.  Details will be provided in the SAP. 
9.3.4  Treatment Compliance  
The dose administered at each cycle for each treatment agent will be assessed and dose 
intensity will be summarized.  Details will be provided in the SAP.  
9.3.5  Efficacy Analyses  
9.3.5.1  Primary Efficacy Analyses 
CR rate at the EOT visit  will be calculated using the All Enrolled Patients analys is set and 
will include all patients in this analysis set who were enrolled on the dose regimen chosen for 
Part 2.  A two -sided 90% exact binomial CI  will be calculated (Clopper 1934) and the test 
will be carried out f or the following null and alternative hypotheses: 
 
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 66 of 91 ● H0: CR rate ≤30% 
● H1: CR rate >30%  
The test will be carried out using a one- sided exact binomial test at level α=0.05, thus the null 
will be rejected in favor of the alternative if P <0.05 is observed. 
9.3.5.2  Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
ORR at EOT will be calculated using the All Enrolled Patients set and its two -sided 95% 
exact binomial CI will be presented (Clopper 1934 ).  Additional summaries of ORR may be 
presented based on patient demographics of interest.  Summaries may also be presented using 
the All Treated Patients and the Efficacy Evaluable analysis sets. PFS and duration of response estimates will be based on Kaplan -Meier methodology and Kaplan- Meier plots will 
be presented.  The median PFS and duration of response times will be determined and their 
two-sided 95% CI calculated using the log -log transformation method ( Collett 1994). 
9.3.5.3  Additional Efficacy Analyses 
OS and PFS estimates will be based on Kaplan -Meier methodology and Kaplan- Meier plots 
will be presented.  The median OS time will be determined and its two -sided 95% CI 
calculated using the log -log transformation method ( Collett 1994). 
9.3.6  Pharmacokin etic and ATA Analyses 
Pharmacokinetic parameters to be estimated for brentuximab vedotin and MMAE include the 
area under the concentration -time curve (AUC), maximum concentration (C
max) or 
concentration at the end of infusion (C eoi), the time C max occurred  (Tmax), and trough 
concentration (C trough) for brentuximab vedotin.  For nivolumab, C eoi and C trough will be 
summarized.  The incidence of ATA to brentuximab vedotin and to nivolumab will also be 
assessed.  
9.3.7  Biomarker Analyses  
Relationships of biomarkers (e.g., baseline values, absolute and relative changes from 
baseline) to efficacy, safety and PK parameters will be explored.  Relationships and associated data that are determined to be of interest will be summarized.  Details will be 
described separately.  
9.3.8  Safety Analyses 
9.3.8.1  Extent of Exposure  
Exposure for each treatment agent, including duration of treatment, number of cycles, total 
dose, dose modifications, and dose intensity will be summarized using the All Treated 
Patients analysis set.  
Details will be provided in the SAP.

Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 67 of 91 9.3.8.2  Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be defined as treatment emergent if they are newly occurring or worsen 
following treatment with either brentuximab vedotin or nivolumab.  The incidence of all AEs, treatment -emergent AEs, and treatment -related AEs will be tabulated.  AEs will be 
classified by system organ class and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
AEs will be listed and summarized by MedDRA preferred term, severity, and relationship to 
study dr ug.  In the event of multiple occurrences of the same AE with the same preferred 
term in one patient, the AE will be counted once as the occurrence.  The incidence of AEs will be tabulated by preferred term and treatment group.  AEs leading to premature 
discontinuation of study drug will be summarized and listed in the same manner. 
9.3.8.3  Deaths and Serious Adverse Events 
Serious adverse events will be listed and summarized in the same manner as all AEs.  Events 
with a fatal outcome will be listed.  
9.3.8.4  Clinical Labora tory Results  
Summary statistics for actual values and for change from baseline may be tabulated as 
appropriate for laboratory results and scheduled visit.  Laboratory values will be listed with 
grade per NCI CTCAE and out of normal reference range flags.  
9.3.9  Interim Analyses 
In Part 1 of the study, an SMC will monitor the trial for safety and provide guidance 
regarding possible enrollment of additional patients in Part 1 and possible expansion of enrollment in Part 2.  Initially 6 patients will be enrolled in P art 1.  If a patient discontinues 
treatment for reasons other than a DLT prior to 6 patients completing the DLT evaluation period then they will be replaced (as long as the arm remains open).  These patients will be monitored for DLT throughout the DLT evaluation period (see Section 3.1.4 for details regarding the definition of DLT and DLT- evaluable).  The SMC will review safety data and 
provide recommendations when either of the following occurs: 
1. 2 or more of the patients in the current arm are determined to have had a DLT based on 
the protocol definition. 
2. 6 patients complete the DLT evaluation period (by either remaining on treatment or having a DLT). 
On review of all available data, the SMC may determine that the classification of DLT was 
not appropriate for one or more of the patients, in which case enrollment may resume if the target of 6 patients has not yet been reached.  However, if 2 or more patients were determined to have experienced DLT, then expansion will not occur as the next step.  Based on SMC recommendations, additional pat ients may be enrolled at modified treatment and/or 
dosing levels (details in Section 3.1).  These additional patients will then be assessed for 
DLT in the same manner described above to determine if it is appropriate to expand 
 
Study SGN35 -025 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4; 23 Jan 2017  
Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 68 of 91 enrollment.  If it is determined by the SMC that due to safety concerns no additional dose 
levels or schedules should be enrolled, then the study will be closed to enrollment. 
Additionally, interim data from the study may be presented at scientific meetings such as the 
annual meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Society of 
Hematology.

Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 80 of 91 APPENDIX D : OVERVIEW OF LYRIC CRITERIA (PART 3 ONLY)  
If tumor flare or pseudo-progression is suspected, then a cl inical response of indeterminate 
response (IR) should be reported based on the Lymphoma Response to Immunomodulatory 
Therapy Criteria (LYRIC) (Cheson 2016). 
Definition of Indeterminate Response  
● IR1: An increase in overall tumor burden (as assessed by the sum of the products of 
the largest diameter [ SPD]) of ≥50% of up to 6 measurable lesions in the first 
12 weeks of therapy, without clinical deterioration  
In general, patients should be experiencing clinical stability or improvement and 
must be able to tolerate continued treatment and not at risk of serious complications should tumor growth occur.  Symptoms related to tumor growth, such as pain at the tumor site or compression of adjacent structures,  may not be 
considered as clinical deterioration in this context.  
● IR2: Appearance of new lesions, or growth of one or more existing lesion(s) ≥50% at 
any time during treatment, occurring in the context of lack of overall progression (<50% increase) of overall tumor burden, as measured by SPD of up to 6 lesions at 
any time during treatment; and  
This may occur early or late in the treatment course. A biopsy is strongly 
encouraged when a patient experiences this phenomenon. If the biopsy does not confirm the presence of viable tumor in the new or enlarging lesion(s), then the lesion(s) are not considered active disease and should not be used in subsequent 
SPD assessments.  
● IR3:  An increase in fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) uptake (using the 5- Point Scale per 
the Deauville  Criteria of one or more lesion[s]) without a concomitant increase in 
lesion size or number. 
Increased immune activity at the site of tumor may manifest as an increase in 
FDG uptake. Therefore, by itself changes in uptake should not trigger an assignment of progressive disease ( PD). The magnitude of increase in uptake in 
an immune- mediated flare compared to that in true tumor progression is not yet 
known. It is important to investigate this finding, especially in conjunction with a biopsy (if possible) of the lesion in question, an increase in FDG avidity of one or more lesions suggestive of lymphoma, without a concomitant increase in size of 
those lesions meeting PD criteria does not constitute PD.  
It is possible that, at a single time point a patient could fulfill criteria for both IR 1 or 2 AND 
IR3.  For example, there could be a new FDG-avid lesion in the absence of overall 
progression (IR2), and at the same time, increase in FDG uptake of a separate lesion (IR3).  In such cases, the designation of IR1 or 2 should take priority (e.g., IR2 in the above 
example).

Brentuximab vedotin; nivolumab  Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential  Page 81 of 91 Follow- Up of Indeterminate Response  
At 12 weeks (or earlier if clinically indicated) after a response of IR is determined by the 
Investigator, repeat imaging is mandatory and PD must be confirmed or refuted based on LYRIC follow-up criteria for IR.  PD should be reported if the SPD of the target lesion has 
increased further, with the considerations below: 
● In the case of IR1, the comparison should be between the first IR1 and the current SPD, with an increase of ≥10% constituting PD. In addition, there should be an increase of ≥5 mm (in either dimension) of at least one lesion for lesions ≤2 cm, and 
10 mm for lesions > 2 cm, to be consistent with the Lugano classification ( Cheson 
2016) .  If the target SPD increase is <10%, the response would still be categorized as 
IR1, and the patient could continue treatment until a subsequent scan shows either PD (≥10% increase from first IR1 time point and an increase of >5 mm in either 
dimension of at least one lesion) or response (≥ 50% decrease from baseline). In this 
situation, it is reasonable to repeat imaging in 4 –8 weeks to ensure absence of 
significant further increase.  
● In the case of IR2, the new or growing lesion(s) (unless biopsy proven to be benign) should be added to the target lesion(s), up to a total of no more than 6 total lesions. If the SPD of the newly defined set of target lesions has increased ≥50% from their nadir value (which may precede the IR time point), the patient should be considered 
to have PD. 
● In the case of IR3, since inflammatory responses may result in an increase in the 
standardized uptake value of a lesion, the patient will not be considered to have PD unless there is evidence of PD by an increase in lesion size or the development of new 
lesions, as noted above.

Section(s)  Change  Rationale  
Synopsis, Figure  1, 
6.7, 7.2  Added long -term follow up assessments to the scanning schedule:  CT scans 
(chest, neck, abdomen, and pelvis) and PET scans will be performed at 
baseline, at the End of Treatment (EOT), pre- ASCT, and during long -term 
follow -up; PET is performed with CT scan s until the patient is in compete 
metabolic response (CmR) by PET.  Clarify that PET scans are needed until the patient has 
CmR.  
3.1, 3.2.1  Removed dose levels of brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab  Revisions provide a more high -level summary of dosing; 
exact dose levels to be determined by the SMC are noted 
in dosing and administration sections.  
5.2.2  Added dose levels to the administration section and clarified the timing for 
completing the brentuximab vedotin administration when combined with nivoluma b at Cycles 2 –4. To align with the synopsis; clarify potential for dose de -
escalation based on SMC recommendation after the first 6 
patients complete treatment; clarify that brentuximab 
vedotin treatment should be completed 30 minutes prior to 
nivolumab infusion at cycles 2 –4 (not cycle 1).  
5.3.2  Correction.  To clarify that BMS will provide nivolumab.  
5.3.3  Added 1 mg/kg dose level to the administration.  To clarify potential for dose de -escalation based on SMC 
recommendation after the first 6 patients c omplete 
treatment.  
5.3.4  Added the following sentences:  Based on available information, 
autoimmune complications are the most likely AEs attributable to 
nivolumab.  Dose modifications for AEs are described in this section as well 
as in Appendix 2 of the nivolumab IB.  
Removed the following sentence:  There are no recommended dose 
modifications for hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.  Revisions to clarify what the most likely nivolumab -
related AEs are based on current data and the location of dose modifications for nivolumab- related toxicities.  
Removed sentence because it is not consistent with recommended dose modifications for hypothyroidism and 
hyperthyroidism in following sections.  
5.3.4.3  Revised dose modifications for total bilirubin elevations as follo ws: 
● If a patient has a baseline total bilirubin that is within normal limits, 
delay dosing for nivolumab -related Grade 2 elevations (>1 .5 to 3 x 
ULN)  
◦ Nivolumab may be resumed if the bilirubin improves to Grade 1 (≤3 x ULN)  or better (≤1.5 x ULN)  
● If a patient has a baseline Grade 1 elevation of total bilirubin that is in 
the Grade 1 range (ULN to ≤1.5 x ULN), delay dosing for nivolumab -
related Grade 3 elevations in the range of (>3 to 5 x ULN)  
◦ Nivolumab may be resumed if the total bilirubin improve s to Grade Revisions to clarify that the ranges in this protocol for 
LFT abnormalities are not an exact match of the CTCAE 
definitions of grade.

2 (1 to 3 x ULN)  or better (≤3 x ULN)  
Removed grade levels from discontinuation paragraph.  
5.5.2  Added the fol lowing sentence:  
At the discretion of the treating physician, consolidative radiotherapy or 
consolidative treatment with single -agent brentuximab vedotin may be give 
post-ASCT.  To align with censoring rules for PFS.  
5.5.2, 6.3.12  Revised stem cell collect ion as follows:  Collection of peripheral blood stem 
cells for ASCT, if applicable, should occur per institutional standard of care , 
generally between 10 -21 days after last dose of study drug(s) .   Protocol calls for scans at EOT (30 –37 days post last 
dose), which are performed before collection of stem 
cells.  Change was made to reconcile the timing of the 
scans and the stem cell collection period and clarify that 
the scans should occur prior to the collection of stem cells 
for ASCT.  
6.1 Added the following:  With the exception of gamma -glutamyl  transpeptidase 
levels and thyroid function tests, the  results from all other clinical laboratory 
assessments must be reviewed prior to study drug dosing. Clarify which labs must be reviewed prior t o dosing.  
6.2.1, Appendix A  Moved assessment of weight from screening visit to baseline visit; removed 
requirement for fasting glucose at baseline.  Moved weight to be consistent with study drug dosing 
calculations; clarified that fasting glucose is not required.  
6.4 Added the following note to the CT and PET assessments:  (may be 
performed 23 to 37 days after last dose of study drug to allow for collection 
of peripheral blood stem cells for ASCT, if applicable)  Clarify the timing of scans should occur p rior to collection 
of PBSC for ASCT.  
7.2 Added definitions and summary of assessments for complete metabolic 
response, partial metabolic response, no metabolic response, and progressive 
metabolic disease.  To align with Lugano Classification Revised Stagin g 
System for malignant lymphoma language.  
7.4 Added biomarker tests for serum and/or plasma sPD -1 and sPD -L2, as well 
as anti -CMV/EBV/FLU T cell responses from PBMC.  List new tests to be assessed.

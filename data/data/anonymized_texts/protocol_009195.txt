• To characterize the safety profile of acalabrutinib and pembrolizumab in 
subjects with solid tumors  in each of the five studies including ST-003 
(pancreatic cancer ), ST- 005 (bladder cancer ), ST -006 (HNSCC) , ST-007 
(NSCLC), and ST-208 (ovarian cancer ). 
• To determine the best overall response rate and overall  response rate (ORR) 
of pembrolizumab monotherapy and the combination of acalabrutinib and 
pembrolizumab. This applies to ST -005, ST -006 and ST-007. 
 
 Secondary  Objective 
• To evaluate the efficacy (multiple efficacy endpoints including ORR, PFS and 
OS) of acalabrutinib monotherapy and acalabrutinib and pembrolizumab 
combination treatment in subjects with solid tumor s using standard response 
criteria . This applies to ST-003 and ST-208. 
• To determine progression-free survival (PFS) in subjects  treated with 
pembrolizumab monotherapy and the combination of acalabrutinib and 
pembrolizumab. This applies to ST -005, ST-006, and ST-007.

3. STUDY OVERVIEW 
 Study Design 
These five studies are p hase 2, multicenter, open-label, randomized studies  evaluating 
acalabrutinib or pembrolizumab monotherapy and the combination of acalabrutinib and 
pembrolizumab in subjects with solid tumors. Subjects meeting the eligibility criteria for 
the study will be randomized 1:1 to one of the following arms: Arm 1:  Acalabrutinib 100 mg administered orally (PO) twice per day (BID)  (ST-003, ST-
208) or Pembrolizumab 200 mg administered as an intravenous (IV ) infusion every 3 
weeks (Q3W) (ST-005, ST-006, ST-007)  
Arm 2:  Acalabrutinib 100 mg PO BID plus Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W  
Acalabrutinib treatment can continue for subjects who are tolerating therapy and not progressing. Pembrolizumab study treatment is for 24 months from the date of first dose 
for subjects who are tolerating therapy and not progressing. Subjects who have 
confirmed progressive disease on the combination of pembrolizumab and acalabrutinib 
will discontinue study treatment. Subjects who have confirmed progressive disease on 
monotherapy arm may start combination until a second disease progression. Disease 
progression will be determined based on irRECIST guidelines. Also pembrolizumab 
treatment can end for subjects with confirmed complete response ( CR) if treatment has 
been administered for at least 24 weeks and 2 doses of pembrolizumab have been administered after confirmation of CR.  Refer to Protocol section 3 for more details.

Acerta Pharma  Confidential  Page 10 of 24 6. ANALYSIS SETS 
The following definitions will be used for the efficacy and safety analysis populations. 
 
 Safety Analysis Set  
The safety analysis set includes all subjects who receive at least one dose of any study 
drug (either acalabrutinib or pembrolizumab). The safety analysis set will be used for 
evaluating the safety and efficacy endpoints with the exception of DOR. The analyses of 
DOR will be conducted on the subset of the safety analysis set who achieve CR or PR 
as their best overall response.  
 
 Efficacy Evaluable Analysis Set  
All subjects in the safety analysis set who have ≥ 1 evaluable response assessment 
after the first dose of study drug (either acalabrutinib or pembrolizumab). Sensitivity 
analyses of efficacy endpoints will be carried out on the efficacy-evaluable population. 
 
 Pharmacokinetic/Pharm acodynamic Analyses Set  
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic evaluable  analysis set will be defined by PK /PD 
group.  
7. FINAL ANALYSIS AND CLINICAL STUDY REPORT 
Planned final analysis will be conducted once last subject exits study and database is locked. The CSR will be written based on the final analysis.  
 
8. STATISTICAL METHODS OF ANALYSIS  
 General Principles 
Descriptive statistics [including means, standard deviations, medians, minimum and maximum for continuous variables and frequency, proportions and confidence intervals (CIs) for discrete variables] will be used to summarize data as appropriate. 
Calculation of time to event or duration of event endpoints will be based on the study day of the event or censoring date rather than visit number or visit label. Missing efficacy or safety data will not be imputed unless otherwise specified.  
The following rules will be used for the days to months/years conversion: 
• 1 month= 30.4375 days; 
• 1 year= 365.25 days.

Acerta Pharma  Confidential  Page 11 of 24 All summaries will be presented by treatment group. 
 Subject Accountability 
The number of subjects enrolled by site will be presented. Subject disposition will be 
summarized for all enrolled subjects including the following information: 
• Proportion of subjects who received study  drug 
• Proportion of subjects with study drug discontinuation and primary reason for 
study drug discontinuation 
• Proportion of subjects discontinuing study and reasons for study discontinuation  
• Time on study  
 
 Important Protocol Deviations 
Important Protocol Deviations (IPDs) categories are defined and managed by the study 
team during the IPD reviews throughout the study before database lock. The final IPD list for each study  is used to produce the summary of IPDs and the l isting of subjects 
with IPDs, respectively.    
 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Summaries of demographic characteristics will be presented for age, age category (< 65, ≥ 65), gender, race, ethnicity, and geographic region for each study.   
Baseline characteristics will be presented for Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, disease stage, tumor grade where relevant, number of 
prior anticancer therapies  for each study . 
 
 Treatment and Medications 
8.5.1 Prior Anticancer Regimens  
Summary statistics will be presented for  prior anticancer regimens (might include 
multiple therapies)  and prior cancer-related surgery  for each study. Prior cancer therapy 
categories  will be adjudicated by the medical monitor. 
 8.5.2 Concomitant Medications

Acerta Pharma  Confidential  Page 12 of 24 8.5.3 Exposure to Investigational Product  
Number of subjects who received at least one dose of acalabrutinib, pembrolizumab or 
both, duration of exposure, average daily dose of acalabrutinib, average dose of 
pembrolizumab per administration cycle, and relative dose intensity will be summarized 
for each investigational product and by treatment group. 
Exposure parameters are defined in more detail in Appendix 12.1.  
 Safety Analyses  
8.6.1 Adverse Events 
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA v20.1 or higher) will be used 
to code all AEs  to a system organ class and a preferred term.  The severity of the AE will 
be assessed by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03. Study drug-related AEs are those assessed by 
investigator as related.  
All AE tables will be summarized by original treatment group and crossover group for 
each study. For subjects who crossed-over from monotherapy to a combination therapy 
of acal abrutinib and pembrolizumab, AEs experienced up to crossover date will 
summarized under monotherapy arm, while AEs on or after the cross -over date (1
st dose 
date of second study drug added) will be summarized under crossover group.   
TEAEs are defined as those events that occur or worsen on or after the first dose of 
study drug, through the treatment phase, and within 30 days following the last dose of acalabrutinib or within 90 days following the last dose of pembrolizumab. 
TEAEs will be summarized by system organ class  (SOC) and preferred terms in 
descending order of frequency, by CTCAE toxicity grade. Drug-related TEAEs, serious 
TEAEs, TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation and removal from study  will be 
summarized by SOC and preferred terms as well as by preferred teams only in 
descending order of frequency and by CTCAE toxicity grade.  
Death information is reported in the study exit case report form ( CRF) for all deaths. 
Incidences of deaths are to be reported, along with the primary cause of death.

Acerta Pharma  Confidential  Page 13 of 24 8.6.2 Adverse Events of Clinical Interest 
Events of Clinical Interest identified for a calabrutinib and combination of acalabrutinib 
with pembrolizumab will be summarized for each study. The definitions of these 
categories are part of Appendix 12.5 and 12.6. 
 
8.6.3 Laboratory Test Results 
Laboratory data up to 30 days after last dose or the safety follow -up visit date, 
whichever is later, will be reported in SI units. Applicable laboratory results will be 
graded according to CTCAE Version 4.03. For each laboratory  parameter, the 
baseline laboratory  value/grade is defined as the last laboratory  value/grade 
collected  on or prior to the date of the first dose of study  drug.  Treatment -emergent 
laboratory abnormalities  for selected parameters  will be summarized.  
 8.6.4 Vital Signs 
Body  temperature, heart r ate (beats/min), systolic  blood pressure (mmHg), diastolic  
blood
 pressure (mmHg),  respiratory  rate (breaths/min), and weight will be collected for 
each study as scheduled in protocol Appendix. For each  parameter, summary statistics 
(mean, standard deviation, median, and range) will be produced for  baseline, maximum,  
and minimum value.  
 
8.6.5 ECOG Performance Status 
ECOG performance status scores  will be summarized for each treatment group using 
shift table.  The shifts  in scores from baseline to worst ECOG score  on treatment will be 
summarized.    
 Efficacy Analyses  
8.7.1 Best Overall Response, Disease Control Rate and Overall Response Rate  
DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve a best response of SD, PR or 
CR at any point of the study. The primary endpoint for ST-003 is DCR by RECIST1.1 
criteria by investigators.   
ORR  is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve a best response of PR or CR 
at any point of the study. The primary endpoint for ST -005, ST-006, ST-007, and ST-208 
is ORR  by RECIST1.1 criteria by investigators.

Version 1.0 dated: 30 January 2018  
 
   
Acerta Pharma  Confidential  Page 14 of 24  
 The primary analysis of DCR and ORR will be conducted using safety analysis set. DCR 
and ORR will be calculated with the corresponding exact binomial 2-sided 95% CI for 
each original treatment arm  and separately for subjects who crossed over from a 
monotherapy to a combination therapy. Monotherapy subjects who crossed-over will be 
summarized according to their original treatment assignment up to the point of crossover, and then summarized as a crossover subject using their res ponse 
immediately prior to crossover as a new baseline for their combination treatment. A sensitivity analysis using efficacy evaluable analysis s et will also be presented. 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for best overall response for each treatment group.  The number and proportion of subjects within each category of response will be presented.     
8.7.2 Duration of Response 
The DOR is  defined as the interval from the first documentation of response to the 
earlier of the first documentation of definitive disease progression or death from any 
cause.  The DOR  will only be summarized for subjects in safety analysis set who 
achieved response (CR or PR) at any point of the study. Kaplan-Meier methods will be 
used to estimate event-free curves and corresponding quantiles (including the median).  
For crossover subjects who originally started on monotherapy , the DOR will only be 
summarized/listed i f ORR for this group is non-zero. If confirmed response is  achieved 
after the crossover, the DOR  for a combination therapy will be summarized. 
Data from surviving, non-progressing subjects will be censored at the date of the last 
adequate disease assessment that is on or before the start date of the new antitumor 
therapy. Data from subjects who have disease progression or die after more than one 
missed visit  will be censored at the last visit date before the missing assessments which  
lack objective disease assessment . The details of definition of progression events and 
censoring rules are the same as for PFS endpoint and are listed in Appendix 12.3.  
 8.7.3 Progression-free Survival 
Progression -free survival is defined as the interval from the start of therapy to the earlier 
of the first documentation of objective disease progression or death from any cause.  Kaplan-Meier methods  will be used to estimate the event-free curves and corresponding 
quantiles (including the median).

Acerta Pharma  Confidential  Page 15 of 24  
 For crossover subjects who originally started on monotherapy , the PFS will only be 
summarized/listed if ORR for this group is non-zero. 
Data from surviving, non-progressing subjects will be censored at the date of the last 
adequate disease assessment that is on or before the start date of the new antitumor 
therapy. Data from subjects who have disease progression or die after more than one 
missed visit will be censored at the last visit date  prior to the missing assessments which 
lack objective disease assessment . The details of definition of progression events and 
censoring rules for primary and sensitivity analyses of PFS are listed in Appendix 12.3. 
In the primary analysis using safety analysis set, study treatment end date will be used 
as the date of progression for subjects who discontinued study treatment due to disease 
progression or death prior to 1st radiographic assessment. Data for subjects who 
discontinued study treatment prior to 1st radiographic assessment due to reasons other 
than disease progression or death will be censored at their study treatment start date.  
 
8.7.4 Overall Survival 
Overall survival is defined as the time from  treatment start date until date of death due to 
any cause. Subjects who are known to be alive or whose survival status is unknown will 
be censored at the date last known to be alive. Subjects who lost to follow -up for survival 
immediately after randomization will be censored at first dose date (Appendix 12.4). OS 
will be summarized for safety analysis set  only and based on original treatment 
assignment. Crossover subjects who originally started on monotherapy and cross over 
to a combination treatment will be summarized as part of the original monotherapy group for OS. The analysis methods for OS will be similar to those described for PFS. 
 
8.7.5 Serum Cancer Antigens CA-19-9 and CA-125  
Changes  in CA-19-9 (ST-003) and CA-125 (ST-208) will be evaluated using descriptive 
statistics using safety analysis set .  
 8.7.6 Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
In addition to evaluation of DCR, ORR, DOR and PFS by RECIST 1.1 criteria exploratory  endpoints of irDCR, irORR , irDOR and irPFS were planned to be evaluated 
by irRECIST criteria (Appendix 7 or 8 in the protocol s). For studies that did not collect 
these immune -related responses no analysis will be performed.

Acerta Pharma  Confidential  Page 16 of 24 8.7.7 Other Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
Time to initial response (PR or better) in months will be calculated and summarized.  
 
 8.7.8 Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic and Biomarker  Analyses  
Additional pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and biomarker analyses may be 
performed, as deemed appropriate. A separate analysis plan for these analyses will be 
developed by PK/PD  group. 
 
 Sensitivity Analyses  
Sensitivity analyses will be done using efficacy evaluable analysis set for efficacy 
endpoints of ORR. if the primary and sensitivity analysis of ORR are consistent, we won’t perform sensitivity analysis using efficacy evaluable analysis set for DOR, PFS, and OS. They are also referenced in corresponding parts of section 9 .7. 
 
9. CHANGES FROM PROTOCOL-SPECIFIED ANALYSES   
Exploratory  endpoints of irDCR, irORR , irDOR and irPFS were planned to be evaluated 
by irRECIST criteria . For studies that did not collect these endpoints  no analysis will be 
performed. These changes will also be documented in the Clinical Study Report. 
Also, one event of clinical interest (ECIs) defined in these protocols (overdose) will not be applicable for this final analysis. Instead, an expanded list of ECIs will be summarized based on the emerging clinical data for acalabrutinib and recent FDA submission in MCL. Overdose, if occurred, will be summarized as part of the important protocol deviations.

 11. APPENDICES 
12.1  Definitions 
Study D ay 
The study  day will be calculated in reference to the first dose  date of study  drug. Study 
Day 1 is defined as the first dose date of study  drug . For assessments that occur on or 
after the first dose date of study  drug , study day is defined as (date of assessment – 
first dose  date of study  drug  + 1). For assessments that occur prior to the first dose 
date of study  drug , study day is defined as (date of assessment – first dose  date of 
study  drug ). There is no Study Day 0. 
 
Duration of Exposure 
The duration of exposure to acalabrutinib or pembrolizumab will be calculated in months 
as (last dose date - first dose date + 1) / 30.4375. The gaps in treatment will be included. 
The duration of exposure in days will be used for planned dose calculation. 
 
Total Dose   
Total dose received is a sum of all actual doses taken through the treatment duration and will be presented in grams. For scheduled drug administration visits that are skipped the actual dose will be 0. 
 
Average Daily Dose (Acalabrutinib)    
Average daily dose is total dose divided by duration of exposure in days. 
 
Average Dose per administration cycle ( Pembrolizumab)   
Average dose per administration cycle  is total dose divided by number of cycles for 
pembrolizumab study treatment. 
 
Relative Dose Intensi ty 
Relative dose intensity is the ratio of total dose to the protocol -specified total  dose 
through the duration of exposure.

 12.2  Imputation Rules for Partial or Missing Dates 
Imputation of partial  dates will be made for AE onset and stop dates, start and 
end dates of concomitant medication, start date of  subsequent anticancer  
therapy, date of initial diagnosis  and death date.  If dates  are completely  missing, no 
imputation will be made. For any partial  date with missing year, no imputation will be 
made.  
The general rule for imputation is:  
• If only day is missing, then the 15th of the month will be used.  
• If only year is present, then June 30th will be used. 
If such imputation date for initial  diagnosis  is on or after date of first dose,  then date of 
first d ose – 1 will  be used. If  such imputed date for subsequent  anticancer therapies 
is before date of last dose,  then date of last dose + 1 will  be used.   
If the imputed date is for an AE start date and is in the same  year and month as but 
before the first dose date, then the first dose date will be used, or if the imputed AE 
start date is after the AE  end date, then the AE end date will be used. If the imputed 
date is for an AE start date and is in the same year and month as but after the last dose 
date + 30 days, then the last dose date + 30 days will be used.  
If the imputed date is for an AE end date and is after the death date, then the death date 
will be used, or if the imputed AE end date is before the AE start date, then the AE start date will be used.  
Every effort will be made to obtain complete dates for deaths. If both month and day are 
missing for death date or a death date is totally missing, do not impute and censor the subject survival time. If death year and month are available but day is missing, the 
following algorithm will be used: 
• If mmyyyy for last contact date = mmyyyy for death date, set death date to the day after the last contact date. 
• If mmyyyy for last contact date < mmyyyy for death date, set death date to the first day of the death month. 
• If mmyyyy for last contact date > mmyyyy for death date, data error and do not impute.

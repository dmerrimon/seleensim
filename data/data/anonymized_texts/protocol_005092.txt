Secondary Objective:  
 To compare the diagnostic quality of PET/CT images obtained at 1  
hour and 4 hours post copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T injection . 
Study Design  This is a prospective, open -label Phase 1/2 study to evaluate copper Cu 64 
PSMA I&T injection for PET/CT imaging  in patients with recurrent 
metastatic prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy.   
Phase 1  
The Phase 1 portion of the study will include a total of 12 patients with 
metastatic prostate cancer. Patients will be randomized into three g roups of 
four patients. Patients in each  group will receive a single intravenous dose 
of 5, 7, or 9 mCi of copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T.  Whole -body PET/CT 
images will be acquired at 1 hour ± 15 minutes, 4 hours ± 0.5 hours, and 
24 hours ± 2.0 hours post -injection to determine radiation absorbed dose 
estimates.   
The 1  hour and 4-hour PET/CT images will be evaluated independently by 
three rea ders blinded to all patient information and dose administered to 
assess the quality of the images (24 PET/CT image sets total).  The 
assessments will be used to determine an acceptable dose to be 
administered for the Phase 2 study.  
Phase 2  
The Phase 2 porti on of the study will include a separate group of 26 
patients with metastatic prostate cancer.  Each patient will be administered 
the same intravenous dose of copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T injection 
determined in the Phase 1 study. PET/CT images will be acquired for  all 
patients at 1 hour ± 15 minutes and 4 hours ± 30 minutes  post copper Cu 
64 PSMA I&T injection.  
The PET/CT images will be interpreted independently by three readers 
blinded to all patient information. Each patient study will be assessed and 
scored for the detection of prostate cancer.  Specifically, each reader will 
categorize images as “Disease” or “ No Disease” based only on tumor

CONFIDENTIAL  Pharmacokinetic/Radiation Absorbed Dose:  
Whole body PET/CT scans will be acquired at 1 hour ± 15 minutes, 4 
hours ± 30 minutes , and 24 hours ± 2.0 hours  post-injection .  CT scans will 
be acquired for attenuation correction and anatomical  reference . Images 
will be acquired using calibrated time -of-flight mode  using digital 
scanners. For calculati on of radiation absorbed dose estimates, volumes of 
interest  (VOI)  will be delineated for the kidneys, liver, lungs, spleen, 
urinary bladder , salivary glands , and total body.  Image count values will be 
corrected  for radioactive decay, scanner response, start/stop times , and net 
injecte d dose.  The remaining activity will be assumed to be distributed 
homogeneously throughout the body after  adjusting for  activit y in the 
organs, blood, and voided urine.  Organ -specific and whole -body radiation 
dose analysis will be performed using OLINDA/EXM  software , following 
Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) guidelines.  
Voided urine activity values will be accounted for in the dosimetry 
analysis by collection of  all urine for 0 -1 hour  and 1-4 hour  intervals post -
injection.  The total voided urine volu me for each interval will be measured 
and the total radioactivity calculated by comparison to a calibrated 
standardized sample  or per Site’s standard methods . Calibrated urine 
voiding curves will be determined and included in the dosimetry analysis.  
Venous blood samples will be collected prior to copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T 
injection and at 1  hour, 2 hours, 4 hours and 24 hours post-injection.  The 
radioactivity concentration in the blood samples will be determined on a 
per-milliliter basis using a calibrate d standard measured in a well counter 
for dosimetry analysis  or per Site’s standard methods . No metabolite 
analysis will be performed on the blood or urine samples.  
Estimates of radiation absorbed dose will be calculated for all patients with 
the data fro m the VOI analysis at each imaging timepoint.   
Dose -Range  Evaluation : 
The 1  hour and 4-hour post-injection PET/CT images for all patients will 
be evaluated for diagnostic image quality by three independent readers 
blinded  to all patient information and dose s administered . Image quality 
will be assessed using the following scoring system: 0 = ina dequate (grainy 
images with poor delineation of lesions); 1 = questionable (clear images, 
but lesion delineation is suboptimal and small lesions [1 cm] are hard to 
assess); 2 = acceptable (clear images, large and small lesion delineation is 
possible). Coho rt scores will be calculated by adding the average patient 
image scores in each dosing group.  
In addition, the blinded readers will record lesion signal -to-noise, 
Maximum Standard Uptake Value (SUV max), lesion -contrast -to-noise and 
lesion -to-normal tissue  values derived from VOI values as described in the 
Independent Read er Manual . The cohort scores and image quality

CONFIDENTIAL  evaluations will be used in the determination of the injected dose value for 
the Phase 2 study.  
Safety Assessments:  
All patients will be followed for adverse events for 24 hours post -injection.   
Severity of adverse events will be assessed independently by the 
Investigator s and graded using the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0, in which Gra des 1, 
2, 3, 4, and 5 describe adverse events as mild, moderate, severe,  or 
medically significant but not life -threatening, life -threatening, and death 
related to adverse event, respectively.  
Routine clinical chemistry, hematology, PSA,  and urinalysis will be 
performed at 4 hours post -injection on all  patients . If no clinically 
significant changes are noted, no additional follow -up will be performed . If 
significant findings are noted, they will be reassessed at 24 hours post -
injection  and fol lowed until values return to normal or baseline, or until the 
Investigator  and Medical Monitor determine it is no longer ne cessary.   
A 12 -lead ECG will be obtained at 30 minutes and 3.5 hours post -injection 
for all patients.  If no clinically significant ch anges are noted, no additional 
follow -up will be performed.  If significant findings are noted, the  patient  
will be reassessed at 24 hours post -injection and followed until values 
return to normal or baseline, or until the Investigator  and Medical Monitor 
determine it is no longer necessary.   
Vital signs including heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate will be 
obtained at 5 minutes, 30 minutes , 1 hour and 4  hours post -injection  on all 
patients.  If no clinically significant changes are noted, no additional 
follow -up will be performed.  If significant findings are noted, they will be 
reassessed at 24 hours post -injection . 
Follow -up: 
Patients will be seen 24 hours post -injection for  assessment of adverse 
event s, clinically significant lab or ECG valu es or clinically significant 
vital signs.  Patients with clinically significant changes  will be followed 
until such events resolve  or as decided by the Investigator  and Medical 
Monitor.

All patients will undergo an efficacy assessment based on copper Cu 64 
PSMA I&T PET/CT results and the results of clinical presentation for 
evaluation against the Composite Reference Standard.  
The Composite Reference Standard  is defined as follows :  
 Local histopathology obtained from prostate cancer surgery or 
biopsy  obtained within 60 days  before or  following copper  Cu 64 PSMA 
I&T PET/CT , or 
 If histopathology is not available, anatomical correlation of 
conventional image findings (e.g., targeted MRI or CT or any FDA -
approved PET PSMA agent) that are acquired prior to locoregional or 
systemic treatment  and within 60 d ays before or  following copper Cu 64 
PSMA I&T PET/CT

 To determine the region -level correct localization rate (CLR) of 
copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T injection PET/CT imaging for the detection of 
recurrent metastatic prostate cancer at 1- and 4 -hours  post-injection . The 
CLR is defined as the percentage of regions cont aining at least one true 
PET positive lesion, with exactly localized correspondence between 
PET/CT imaging and the Composite Reference Standard  regardless of any 
co-existent false positive findings, within the same region, out of all 
regions containing at least one PET positive finding . 
 To determine the patient -level correct detection rate (CDR) of 
copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T injection PET/CT imaging for the detection of 
recurrent metastatic prostate cancer at 1 hour and 4 hours post -injection . 
The CDR is defined as the percentage of patients who have a least one true 
PET positive lesion with exactly localized correspondence between PET 
imaging and the Composite Reference Standard  regardless of any co -
existent false positive findings, out of all patients who are scanned   
Since all patients enrolled in the study will have disease, the CLR is a 
measure of the sensitivity of the copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T injection scan. 
Current methods have a CLR  of 60%; thus, the hypothesis to be tested in 
the Phase 2 portion of the study is:  H0: πC = π0 versus HA: πC > π0  where 
πC is the CLR for copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T injection  and π0 is the CLR 
from the literature (estimated to be 60%).  
This hypothesis will be tested using an exact one -sample binomial test with 
a one -sided α=0.025.  
Secondary  Objective : 
The secondary  objective  for the Phase 2 study is to compare the diagnostic 
quality of  PET/CT  images obta ined at 1 hour and 4 hours post copper Cu 
64 PSMA I&T injection . 
Safety Endpoint : 
To assess the safety of copper Cu 64 PSMA I&T injection in patients with 
recurrent prostate cancer.  Safety will be assessed by monitoring  adverse 
events, clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis , ECG, and vital signs.  
Analysis Populations : 
Several analysis populations of patients are defined, which may provide a 
more complete description of the collected data, provide a logical 
mechanism for grouping and listing results based on an applied analysis, 
and/or allow appropriate stratification of  various analyses.  
 The Enrolled Patient Population (EPP) represents patients who sign 
an Informed Consent Form and have baseline data.

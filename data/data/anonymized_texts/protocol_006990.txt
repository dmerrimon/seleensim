Aim of the Study  
The primary aim of thi s research is to determine the accuracy of smartphone pulse 
oximeters in detecting blood oxygen saturations, episodes of desaturations , and heart rate by 
comparing  results  to a Masimo© hospital -grade pulse oximeter.   
 
Introduction  
Digital innovations have made it possible for consumers to use mobile devices for 
medical purposes. They can be used to  monitor physiological parameters  such as  blood pressure, 
heart rate, blood oxygen satura tion, and body temperature. They can also be used  to conduct 
diagnostic tests , request  prescription  refills , and relay medical information to physicians .1 
Consequently, the h ealthcare  sector is being profoundly affected  by this emerging  technology .1,2 
A frequen t reliance on mobile devices  has been reported among  healthcare practitioner s (HCP s) 
and students, with 85% reporting the use of a mobile device at least once daily for clinical 
purposes. The most common use was  for information,  time management , or communication 
relating to education and patient care.3 In 2010, approximately 50 percent of physicians used a 
mobile phone or a smart  mobile  device as a part of his or her practice. In 2015, that number 
increased to approximately 70 percent.  The overall growth of applications (apps)  was 38.1 
percent , compounded annually over the past five years ; in regards to medical apps, the growth  
was documented at  41.9 percent.4   
 
Various cell phone companies have created and embe dded pulse oximetry apps  in smart 
phones  that enable individuals  to monitor their oxygen saturation and vital signs. Samsung, 
Apple, and various other companies have designed cellular devices that are capable of providing 
health -related app s. Other  developers have created app s that are  compatible with Andro id and 
iOS technologies. Some companies, including  Lionsgate Technologies and Masimo, have 
developed external pulse oximeters that are compatible with smartphones. While these features 
seem promising for use of home monitoring o f blood oxygen saturation levels, the accuracy of 
many of these features  and devices  have  not yet been established.  
 
Smartphone pulse oximeters and other mobile health (mHealth) apps are examples of 
new and evolving technology, which if developed accurately  and used correctly , may make a 
difference in  the lives of  many individuals . A study conducted by Petersen et al  suggests that if 
pulse oximeters coul d be available on mobile phones  many global infectious diseases, such as 
pneumonia in children, could be treated faster and mortality rate would thus decrease due to 
prompt detection of changes in vital signs  alongside quicker treatments .5, 6 Studies from both 
Canada and Uganda regardin g the Phone Oximeter  prototype (a device interfacing pulse 
oximeters and smartphones)  provide an  overall usability scores of 82 percent and 78 percent 
respectiv ely, indicative that a phone could  be a functional oximeter interface.7 A usability score 
of  > 75% is considered appropriate as a functional interface. Additionally, a blinded randomized 
control trial in Australia, revealed that self -monitoring of oxygen saturation via a telehealth app 
Breathe -easy© reduced exacerbations of asthma in pregnant women.8 Since  the severity of 
asthma increases during pregnancy commonly,  Zairaina et al  studied monitoring in pregnant 
women and found that it improved quality of life, although it did not impact lung function.8 
 
 3 Alexander et al compared four different smartpho ne application -based monitors: Instant 
Blood Pressure, Instant Blood Pressure Pro, Pulse Oximeter, and Pulse Oximeter Pro . Three 
different parameters were measured using these four devices: heart rate, blood pressure , and 
SpO 2. The comparison revealed a la rge degree of variance in the values between the Instant 
Blood Pressure, the Instant Blood Pressure Pro, the Pulse Oximeter, and the Pulse Oximeter 
Pro.9 Another study by Petersen and Dumont was conducted that compared the response of 
motion artifact of th ree different mobile pulse oximeter devices, all interfaced to Apple iPod 
Touch devices : the Nonin Xpod, the Masimo OEM inline module, and an Audio Phone Oximeter 
prototype . The study showed that there was more motion artifact at lower saturations for all three 
of the devices. The most valid measurements was found with Masimo’s mobile device at 
readable values of approximately 85 to 87 percent.10  
 
While the technology to detect SpO 2 and heartrates on smartphones is emerging and 
widely available , there is n o evidence supporting its use in patients with lung disease . 
Smartphone pulse oximetry could be useful in individual s with acute or chronic lung disease ; 
however , device inaccuracies could be harmful  if desaturations are not detected  immediately . It 
is not  known how accurately these devices detect oxygen saturation /desaturation  in patients with 
acute or chronic lung  conditions . This study will be used to evaluate the accuracy of smartphone 
pulse oximeters in patients that will be undergoing a six -minute walk test in a pulmonary 
function lab.   
 
Experimental  Design  and Methods  
This is a prospective, observational study conducted  at the pulmonary function laboratory at 
Rush University Medical Center. Subjects  (n=48) will be selected if they are of 18 years of age 
or older, ambulatory, scheduled for a six -minute walk test , and  agree to participate. The 
following information will be  collected:  
 First name  
 Last name  
 Date of Birth  
 Age 
 Height  
 Gender  
 Race/Ethnicity  
 Oxygen use and frequency (if they are already on oxygen)  
 Pulmonary Disorder s 
 Borg’s Dyspnea Scale  
 Heart rate (hospital -grade pulse oximeter and  external and built -in smartphone pulse 
oximeter; pre - and post - test) 
 SpO 2 (hospital -grade pulse oximeter and external and built -in smartphone puls e oximeter; 
pre- and post - test) 
 
Procedures  
For every patient that meets inclusion criteria, demographic  information such as: age, 
race, and gender will be collected. Weight will be measured in the pulmonary function clinic by 
the designated respiratory therapist. Heart rate and SpO 2 measurements will be taken per normal 
routine during the six -minute walk test ( before and after t he test) . Parameters  will be measured 
 4 using an iPhone attached external pulse oximeter (Kenek Edge, LionsGate Technologies, 
Vancouver, Canada),  a Samsung S8 (Samsung Electronics Co. Inc., Seoul, South Korea) built -in 
pulse oximeter, and  a Masimo© (Masimo C orporation, Irvine, California) hospital -grade pulse 
oximeter. Readings will be obtained before and after the test. All three devices will be used to 
obtain readings from a single  arm, consecutively. Each reading will be recorded manually by 
persons involv ed in the research. Each reading will be  recor ded using RedCap software and later 
transferred to SPSS software for data analysis. All data  placed  on the  RedCap software and SPSS  
will only be accessible by the primary investigators.  
 
Subject Population  
Inclusion criteria  
Ambulatory patients, 18 years and older, visiting the p ulmonary function laboratory at Rush 
University Medical Center for a 6 -minute walk test  (n = 30)  that agree to participate.  
Exclusion criteria  
 
Patients wh o are under the age of 18  years or  patients with high blood pressure above 
180/90 mm  Hg or pressure below 70/50  mm Hg will be  excluded. Patients who are dizzy , light -
headed or have severe headaches, if SpO 2 at or below 85% on  supplemental oxygen or if  patients 
are on  oxygen greater than 4 liters per minute will be excluded. Gait i ssues that may result in a 
fall or p atient walks with a walk er and did not  bring the device to this visit will be excluded.  
 
Consent and Recruitment  Procedure  
Recruitment will be based on inc lusion and exclusion criterion. Study subjects will be 
recruited through convenience sampling of patients attending the pulmonary function lab for a 6 -
minute walk test at Rush University Medical Center. Verbal consent will be obtained during the 
time of su bject interaction. Waiver of written consent will be requested since no invasive 
procedures are involved or procedures that would potentially be harmful to the participants.  
 
Compensation  
There is no compensation provided in this study. The participant is not required any other 
follow up after obtaining this initial data.  
 
Special Precautions  
There are no special precautions needed in this study. Standard disinfection policies 
apply. Personal protective equipment and standard protocol should be followed at all times. 
Patient safety and privacy will be addressed at all times.  
 
Confidentiality  
Persons who are primary investigators and secondary investigators, along with the IRB, 
will have access to patient records. To protect patient privacy and confidentialit y, each patient 
will be assigned a subject identification number. Names will not be included in the data analysis. 
The investigators will strictly adhere to HIPAA and IRB guidelines to ensure that patient 
confidentiality is maintained.  
Plans for Data Anal ysis 
Data for each  subject will be recorded in RedCap which will  only be accessed by study 
investigators. Means and standard deviation will be calculated for age, gender, race, heart rate, 
 5 and pulse oximeter reading from hospital -grade and smartphone pulse  oximeters. A t -test will be 
used to determine any significant association between age, gender, diagnosis, weight, and 
oxygen use (p< .05). Alpha will be used as 0.05 and beta will be used as 0.20. It can be predicted 
that these tests will be parametric. A  scatter plot will be used to assess bias and validity.  
 
Independent variables : Type of pulse oximeter  
 
Dependent variables:  SpO 2 and heart rate  
Co-variables:  body mass index, admitting diagnosis, age, site of measurement , oxygenation 
status , skin pigmentation, nail color,  and pulmonary disorders.

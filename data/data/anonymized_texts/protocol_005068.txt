Study Design  
This is an open label, dose -seeking phase 1 /2 study using a defined dose of nivol umab 
and escalating doses of ABI -009 given intravenously.  
 
I. Dose Escalation Phase 1 Part of Study:  The study will employ the standard “cohort 
of three” design (2). Three patients are treated at each dose level with expansion to six 
patients per cohort if DLT is observed in one of the three initially -enrolled patients at each 
dose level. If no DLT occurs after 2 doses, escalation to the next dose level will be 
permit ted. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the highest safely tolerated dose, 
where not more than one patient experienced DLT, with the next higher dose level having 
at least two patients who experienced DLT. Patients in the dose escalation study may 
continue treatment at their designated dose levels up to eighteen  3-week  cycles or until 
significant disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. No intra -patient dose 
escalation will take place.  
 
Dose of nivolumab :  3 mg/kg IV over 30 min. q 3 weeks  (Day 1 of every 21 -day cycle)  
 
Dose of ABI -009:  
 
NB: ABI-009 will start after 2nd nivolumab  dose  and will be administered on D8 and D15 
beginning in C2.  
 
Escalating doses IV over 30 min for 2 of every 3 weeks:  
 
Treatment Cycle        # Pts.      Dose Level      Dose,  mg/m2       
 
Every 3 weeks              3-6                   I                      56    
Every 3 weeks              3-6                  II                      75                       
Every 3 weeks              3-6                 III                    100  
 
Note: DLT includes any > Grade 3 colitis, hepatitis, or pneumonitis, any Grade 1 -2 colitis, 
hepatitis or pneumonitis that recurs, worsens or persists with oral steroids longer than 14 
days, symptoms of adre nal crisis, any Grade 4 hematologic toxicity or any        > Grade 
3 non -hematologic toxicity.  If DLT develops in more than 1 patient at Dose 56 mg/m2, the dose 
will be de -escalated to 45 mg/m2 and to 30 mg/m2 if DLT develops at 45 mg/m2.  
 
II. Expansion Ph ase 2 Part of Study : Following dose escalation, an  additional 22-28 
patients will receive ABI -009 at the MTD and defined doses of nivolumab to assess overall 
safety and potential efficacy in a greater number of patients. Patients in the expansion 
phase of the study may continue treatment up to 18 3-week treatment  cycles or until 
significant disease progression  or unacceptable toxicity occurs.  
The study will be conducted in compliance with International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practices (GCPs).  
Surgical Resection:  After three or more treatment cycle s, the principal investigator may 
recommend surgical debulking, complete surgical removal or a biopsy. If residual disease

cycles may be given 2-4 weeks after surgery, i f the surgical incision has healed, and if 
the patient has < grade I toxicity.  
 
Resected or biopsied tumors will be analyzed for the effects of this dual therapy on 
disease control rate , and immune cell trafficking in the tumor microenvironment. Fresh 
and paraffin embedded tissue blocks will be analyzed by FACS for PD -L1 and other 
biomarkers, including Tregs, CD8+, CD4+ cells etc. Immunohistochemistry for cyclin G1, 
cyclin D1 and Ki67 will be conducted to determine the tumor's proliferative state. 
Histopat hologic examination for tumor necrosis and mitotic index will also be determined.  
 
Conditions for Continuation of Treatment in the Presence of Increased Tumor 
Size by CT scan or MRI Indicating Progressive Disease by RECIST v1.1:  
Treatment may be continued if:  
1. There are no signs or symptoms indicating unequivocal progression.  
2. There is no worsening of ECOG score attributable to progressive disease.  
3. There is no tumor growth at critical sites that is life -threatening.  
4. Patient signs an informed consent that he/she is aware of alternative therapies but

Length of Study  
The study is expected to take approximately 32 months from first patient enrolled to last 
patient follow -up, including approximately 24 months of enrollment period, an estimated 
6 months of treat ment (or until treatment is no longer tolerated) and an end of treatment 
visit at 4 weeks (+/ - 7 days) after last treatment.   
The End of Study (EOS) defined as either the date of the last visit of the last patient to 
complete the study, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last patient that 
is required for primary, secondary, and/or exploratory analysis, as pre -specified in the 
protocol.  
End of Treatment (EOT) for a patient is defined as the date of the last dose of ABI -009 or 
nivolumab . End of Treatment Visit for a patient is when safety assessments and 
procedures are performed after the last treatment, which m ust occur at least 4 weeks (± 
7 days) after the last dose of ABI -009 or nivolumab .   
Follow -up period is the on -study time period after the EOT Visit. All patients that 
discontinue study drug and have not withdrawn full consent to participate in the study will 
continue in the follow -up phase for survival and initiation anticancer therapy. Follow up 
will continue approximately every 12 weeks (+/ - 3 weeks), until death, withdrawal of 
consent, or the study closes, whichever is the earliest. This evaluation may  be made by 
record review and/or telephone contact.

Confidential and Proprietary  10 Final Protocol: September 26, 2019  Study Treatmen t 
Patients will receive nivolumab 3 mg/kg as IV infusion over 30 min every 3 weeks  (Day 1 
of every 21 -day cycle) , followed by escalating doses of ABI-009 30, 45, 75 mg/m2 for 2 of 
every 3 weeks by IV infusion over 30 minutes . ABI-009 dosing will start after 2nd 
nivolumab dose and to be administered on Day 8 and Day 15 of every cycle beginning in 
Cycle 2.  Patients will continue therapy until unequivocal clinical disease pro gression, 
unacceptable toxicity, or until in the opinion of the investigator the patient is no longer 
benefiting from therapy, or at the patient’s discretion.  
Overview of Key Safety Assessments  
Safety and tolerability will be monitored through continuous r eporting of treatment -
emergent and treatment -related adverse events (AEs), AEs of special interest, laboratory 
abnormalities, and incidence of patients experiencing dose modifications, dose 
delay/dose not given, dose interruptions, and/or premature discont inuation of IP due to 
an AE. All AEs will be recorded by the investigator from the time the patient signs informed 
consent until 28 days after the last dose of IP. Adverse events will be graded by National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria  for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03.  
Physical examination, vital sign s, laboratory assessments (e .g., serum chemistry, 
hematology), and ECOG performance status will be monitored. All SAEs (regardless of 
relationship to IP) will be followed until resolution. Local laboratory analysis will be 
performed as per study schedule.   
The MTD for ABI -009 will be determined, and will be used in the Phase 2 part of the study.  
Overview of Key Efficacy Assessments  
Patients will be evaluated for disease control rate [ complete response (CR), partial 
response (PR), and stable disease (SD) ], or progressive disease (PD) by CT imaging. 
Contrast enhanced MRI can also be used, as long as the same modality is used 
throughout the study. Baseline scan results can be accepted fro m outside institutions, but 
must be done within 4 weeks of starting therapy and must include (as clinically indicated), 
chest abdominal, and pelvic CT or MRI. The first response assessment by CT or MRI 
scans documenting target lesions will be done 6 weeks after first treatment and should 
be repeated every 6 weeks for the first year, then every 12 weeks thereafter until the end 
of treatment . If an initial observation of objective response (CR or PR) is made, a 
confirmation scan should be done at 6 weeks afte r initial observation. Scans should 
continue on schedule regardless of delays in ABI -009 dosing .  
The efficacy  endpoint s, DCR (CR, PR and SD), OR (CR + PR), PFS , and RFS  will be 
determined by a local  radiologic assessment  using RECIST v1.1 . After end of tr eatment , 
patients will be followed for survival every 12 weeks  (+/- 3 weeks) , or more frequently as 
needed, until death, withdrawal of consent, or the study closes, whichever is the earliest.

Confidential and Proprietary  11 Final Protocol: September 26, 2019  Demographic and baseline information (e.g., extent of prior therapy) on study patients 
will be tabulated.  The number of patients studied for the Phase 1  (dose escalation)  part 
of study could range from 12 to 18 evaluable patients , and 22 -28 evaluable patie nts for 
the Phase 2 (dose expansion)  part of the study .   
For the Phase 1 part of the study, t he following information will be reported for  all 
adverse events observed in the study: dose level, type (organ affected or laboratory 
determination, such as absolute neutrophil count), severity (by NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03 and most extreme 
abnormal values f or laboratory determinations) and relatedness to study treatment.  For 
each dose the number and percentage of patients experiencing any grade 3, 4, or 5 
adverse event will be reported, as well as the number and percentage of patients who 
experienced select ed specific types of adverse events.  In addition, the DLTs will be 
summarized by dose level and the MTD will be determined.  
The following table gives the probability of dose escalation at a single dose level as a 
function of the true probability of DLT at that level using the cohorts of 3 design 
(Objective #1)  (2).

For the Phase 1 part of the study, the entire treated population (Full Analysis Set) will be 
the analysis population for all safety analyses. Adverse events will be coded using the 
NIH CTCAE v4.03. Summary tables will include the number and percentage of patients 
with AEs, serious AEs, fatal AEs and o ther AEs of interest. Safety will be analyzed in all 
patient groups together (metastatic and locally advanced). Although this study will not 
be large enough to allow firm conclusions about safety or efficacy, it will provide 
preliminary data on safety and efficacy that will be useful in planning future studies.  
Frequency tables, graphs, and summary statistics will be used for outcome data.  
Patient incidence of all treatment -emergent AEs  will be tabulated. Tables of fatal adverse 
events, serious adverse events, treatment -related AEs, and adverse events leading to 
withdrawal from investigation product will also be provided.

Confidential and Proprietary  12 Final Protocol: September 26, 2019  The disease control rate (DCR; CR+PR+SD),  objective response rate (ORR; CR + PR), 
progression free survival (PFS), and recurrence -free survival (RFS) will be assess ed by 
a local radiologic assessment using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) v1.1  and irRECIST . 
The focus of the study is to estimate the DCR  in patients treated with ABI -009 and 
nivolumab. Patients who progress before receiving ABI -009 will be replaced, and will not 
be included in the statistical analysis. The number and percentage of patients achieving 
response will be summarized .   
Analysis of other efficacy endpoints,  PFS at 4 months, RFS at 4 months, median PFS, 
and median OS will be assessed for all subtypes together, and separately in the five 
sarcoma subtypes .  
PFS, RFS  and OS will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier (KM) analysis. The number of 
patients  in each category is expected to be small; therefore, PFS at 4 months, RFS at 4 
months, median PFS,  median RFS  and median OS for these patients will be summarized 
by descriptive statistics.  
 
Exploratory Analysis:  
DCR  based on RECIST v1,1 will be correlated with DCR  based on Immune -related 
Response Criteria (irRECIST) and summarized by descriptive statistics.  
PD-L1 and other biomarker  expression in patients’ tumors will be correlated with DCR 
PFS, and RFS  and summarized by descr iptive statistics.  
DCR will be correlated with presence of PTEN mutation in patient’s archived tumor and 
summarized by descriptive statistics .

 1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Soft Tissue Sarcoma   
Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a relatively rare neoplasm of mesenchymal origin, which 
includes a diversity of histological subtypes and occurs with an incidence of about 1% of 
all adult cancers.  Surgical resection is still the treatment of choice for local ized disease, 
along with radiation therapy for unresectable sarcomas. However, recurrence rate is high 
(~50%) and treatment options for metastatic/relapsed STS are limited to anthracycline -
based chemotherapy (i.e., doxorubicin), administered alone or in co mbination with 
alkylating agents (ifosfamide and/or dacarbazine) (3, 4). Judging from studies conducted 
over the last 20 years, prognosis for advanced STS has been uniformly poor, with an 
estimated median survival of only 8 to 13 months (5-7). Recently, two new drugs for soft 
tissue sarcoma have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration 
(USFDA). The first drug, pazopanib (Votrient®, Novartis Pharma), is a multiple tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor, which hinders growth factor -mediated signal transduction pathways 
involved in tumor angiogenesis (8-10). The second drug, trabectedin/ET -743 (Yondelis®, 
Janssen Biotech, Inc.), is a natural alkaloid, originally isolated from the Caribbean 
tunicate, Ecteinascidia turbinata, which interacts with DNA in a complex manner that 
interferes with gene transcription a nd DNA repair (11). Following the approval of 
trabectedin in Europe for treatme nt-resistant STS (12, 13) and the resu lts of a pivotal 
Phase 3 trial (14), which enabled its approval in the United States for liposarcoma and  
leiomyosarcoma in 2015, there is renewed optimism for improving the quality of life, 
progression -free survival, and potentially, the overall survival of advanced STS patients 
that have failed standard therapies (14, 15).  
1.1.1  mTOR Inhibitors in Soft Tissue Sarcoma  
Aberrant mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is common in sarcomas and 
other malignancies. Drug resistance and toxicities often limit beneﬁts of systemic 
chemotherapy used to trea t metastatic sarcomas. Ridaforolimus is an inhibitor of 
mammalian target of rapamycin, an integral component of the phosphatidyl 3 -kinase/AKT 
signaling pathway, with early evidence of activity in sarcomas.  
A multicenter, open -label,  single -arm, phase II trial was conducted to assess the 
antitumor activity of ridaforolim us in patients with distinc t subtypes of advanced sarcomas 
(Chawla et al. A  total of 212 patients were treated in four separate histologic cohorts. In 
this heavily pretreated population, 61 patients (28.8%) achieved CBR. Median PFS was 
15.3 weeks; median O S was 40 weeks. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) conﬁrmed response rate was 1.9%, with four patients achieving conﬁrmed PR 
(two with osteosarcoma, one with spindle cell sarcoma, and one with undifferentiated 
pleomorphic sarcoma [former ly malignant ﬁbrous histiocytoma ]). Archival tumor protein 
markers analyzed were not correlated with CBR. Related adverse events were generally 
mild or moderate and consisted primarily of stomatitis, mucosal inﬂammation, mouth 
ulceration, rash, and fatigue . Conclusion : Single -agent ridaforolimus in patients with 
advanced and pretreated sarcomas led to PFS results that compare favorably with 
historical metrics.  
ABI-009/Nivolumab  
Protocol: SOC -1701     Sarcoma Oncology Research Center  
 
Confidential and Proprietary  23 Final Protocol: September 26, 2019  
 A large randomized placebo -controlled phase III trial evaluated the mTOR inhibitor 
ridaforolimus to assess maintenance of disease control in advanced sarcomas  after 
benefit from prior chemotherapy  (16). Patients with metastatic soft tissue or bone 
sarcomas who achieved objective response or sta ble disease with prior chemotherapy 
were randomly assigned to receive ridaforolimus 40 mg or placebo once per day for 5 
days every week. Primary end point was progression -free survival (PFS); secondary end 
points included overall survival (OS), best target  lesion response, safety, and tolerability.  
A total of 711 patients were enrolled, and 702 received blinded study drug. Ridaforolimus 
treatment led to a modest, although signiﬁcant, improvement in PFS per independent 
review compared with placebo (hazard ra tio [HR],  0.72; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.85; P <  .001; 
median PFS, 17.7 v 14.6 weeks). Ridaforolimus induced a mean 1.3% decrease in target 
lesion size versus a  10.3%increase with placebo (P <  .001). Median OS with ridaforolimus 
was 90.6 weeks versus 85.3 weeks w ith placebo (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.12; P = 
.46). Adverse events (AEs) more common with ridaforolimus included stomatitis, 
infections, fati gue, thrombocytopenia, noninfec tious pneumonitis, hyperglycemia, and 
rash. Grade 3 AEs were more common with rid aforolimus than placebo (64.1% v 25.6%).  
Conclusion : Ridaforolimus delayed tumor progression to a small statistically signiﬁcant 
degree in patients with metastatic sarcoma who experienced beneﬁt with prior 
chemotherapy. Toxicities were observed with ridafo rolimus, as expected with mTOR 
inhibition. These data provide a foundation on which to further improve control of 
sarcomas.  
Other mTOR inhibitors, including sirolimus and everolimus, have been tested or are being 
tested in clinical trials for advanced soft  tissue sarcoma. For example, s irolimus , is 
currently approved for  immunosuppression  following organ transplantation. However, 
there is increasing interest in its role as a neoplastic agent. In a report of four cases of 
progressive metastatic sarcoma in pa tients who have progressed after 2 –6 lines of 
chemotherapy, treatment with sirolimus resulted in minor radiographic imp rovement in 
three cases  (17). Myxoid chondrosarcoma has also been reported to respond well to 
sirolimus in combination with cyclophosphamide  (18). 
Further, a  phase II study investigating the efficacy of everolimus in  patients with 
histological evidence of progressive or metastatic  bone or soft tissue sarcoma is 
currently underway  (19), as is a phase I/II study of everolimus in  pediatric patients with 
recurrent or refractory solid tumors  (20). 
1.1.2  Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Soft Tissue Sarcoma  
Immune check point inhibitors have become a mainstay of therapy for melanoma and are 
currently being developed for various solid tumors including renal cell carcinoma, non -
small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, head and neck cancer and lymphoma. The 
under lying principle is to thwart the defenses (checkpoints) that tumors utilize to cripple 
the immune system. Examples of FDA -approved immune checkpoint inhibitors include 
monoclonal antibodies ipilimumab and nivolumab (21). Ipilimumab (Yervoy®) is a 
recombinant human IgG1 monoc lonal antibody that blocks the human cytotoxic T -
lymphocyte antigen (CTLA -4) which tumors use to overturn the immune system. CTL4 is 
one of several co -inhibitory molecules that help in controlling the T -cell response to 
stimuli/cancer cells. Cancer cells b ind to the CTL -4 antigen to avoid the destruction by 
ABI-009/Nivolumab  
Protocol: SOC -1701     Sarcoma Oncology Research Center

 cytotoxic T cells. In a pivotal phase III study, ipilimumab in combination with a glycoprotein 
100 (gp100) peptide vaccine improved overall survival in Stage III or IV unresectable 
melanoma. These result s, together with two other supportive studies, formed the basis of 
FDA approval for unresectable or metastatic melanoma (22, 23). Nivolumab (Opdivo®) 
is a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that blocks the programmed death receptor -1 (PD -
1). It is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma 
and disease progression following ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a 
BRAF inhibitor. This indication is approved under accelerated appr oval by the USFDA  
(23). 
Recently, the results of a multicenter phase 2 study (SARC028 ) investigating the safety 
and efficacy of pembrolizumab, a programmed death -1 (PD -1) inhibitor, in advanced soft 
tissue sarcoma and bone sarcoma (SARC028) showed that t he ORR in the overa ll STS 
cohort was 18% and the 12 -wk PFS 55% [95% CI, 42 -71]). Clinical activity was variable 
by histologic subtype with 40% ORR in UPS (1 CR and 3PR out of 10 evaluable pts), 2 
PR/10 were seen in DDLPS, 1PR/10 in SS and 0/10 in LMS. For BS, median follow -up 
was 12.3 months (ORR 5%; 12 -wk PFS 28% [95% CI, 14 -41]), with 1PR/22 OS, 1PR/5 
CS and 0/13 ES. Seventy  pre-pembrolizumab  tissues were analyzed with PD -L1+ in 3/70 
(4%); all 3 were UPS. Of the 2 evaluable pts, 1 had CR and 1 PR. Two OS were PD -L1+ 
on mult i-color IHC, 1 had PR. All PD -L1+ samples had CD8+ T -cell in filtration. There were 
no post -pembro  PD-L1+ samples. The authors concluded that pembrolizumab  has clinical 
activity in UPS and LPS, and expansion cohorts in those subtypes are planned. Pre -
treatm ent PD -L1 expression was infrequent, but correlated with T -cell infiltration and 
response in UPS & OS  (24).  
1.1.3  Combination Chemo -/Immuno - therapy for Soft Tissue Sarcoma  
Understanding the bifunctional role that the immune system plays in tumor eradication vs  
growth promotion is critical in the design and timing of combination tumoricidal and 
immunologic therapies for sarcomas (25). Hence, immune checkpoin t inhibitors that 
promote sustained T cell activation by suppressing T regs, may have synergistic activity 
with a tumoricidal agent, such as ABI -009, an mTOR inhibitor, whose plausible 
mechanism of action is to destroy the cancer cells and expose the tumor neoantigens for 
immune recognition.  
The initial results of our study  on the feasibility of sequen tial administration of trabectedin 
and nivolumab support this concept. Trabectedin has direct cytotoxic activity in tumor 
cells and has also been shown to deplete pro -tumor macrophages in the tumor 
microenvironment (26). Nivolumab inhibits the immune checkpoint molecule, PD -1, which 
restores anti -tumor activity  in tumor -infiltra ting T cells. The objectives were  to assess the 
safety/toxicity and efficacy of sequential administration of trabectedin and nivolumab in 
patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Fourteen patients with locally -
advanced and/or metastatic STS were e valuated. Each patient received 1 dose of single -
agent trabectedin (1.5 mg/kg continuous intravenous infusion, CIV, for 24 hours), followed 
by sequential administration of trabectedin CIV and nivolumab (3 mg/kg IV over 30 
minutes) every 3 -4 weeks, starting  3 weeks after the first trabectedin dose. 
Dexamethasone  (6-20 mg IV over 30 minutes) was given prior to each trabectedin 
treatment. Safety/toxicity was analyzed  using the NIH/NCI CTCAE v.4.03 . Baseline and

 follow -up CT scans or MRIs were performed after every 2 cycles of the sequential chemo -
/immuno -therapy. Tumor responses were assessed by RECIST v1.1 and immune -related 
response criteria (irRC). Histologic subtypes include malignant fibrous histiocytoma / 
undifferentiated pleomorphic sarc oma (n = 6), leiomyosarcoma (n = 3), synovial sarcoma 
(n = 2), myxoid liposarcoma (n = 2) and chondrosarcoma (n = 1). All patients had 
metastatic disease and a median of 4 lines of prior chemotherapy.  Safety analysis: Grade 
3 treatment emergent adverse ev ents include anemia (n=1), fatigue (n = 1), decreased 
platelet count (n=1), and increased creatine kinase (n=1). These AEs have been reported 
with trabectedin use. No immune -related adverse event has been observed so far. 
Efficacy analysis: Thirteen patien ts received 2 cycles of sequential chemo -/immuno -
therapy, had follow -up CT scan or MRI, and were evaluated for objective response (OR), 
best overall response rate, (BORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression -free survival 
(PFS) and overall survival (OS ). There were 2 partial responses (PR), with one biopsied 
nodule showing >90% liquefaction necrosis, 8 stable disease (SD) and 3 progressive 
disease (PD), with best overall response rate (BORR) of 15.3%, DCR of 76.9%, median 
PFS of >8 weeks (range: 8 -21 we eks), and median OS of >8 weeks (12.3 ->21 weeks). 
To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore sequentially administered chemo -
/immuno -therapy in patients with advanced STS.  The in itial data suggest that paired 
administration of trabectedin and ni volumab is safe. We continue to evaluate for safety 
as well as synergistic activity based on their mechanisms of action on the tumor -immune 
microenvironment (27).  
 
1.1.4  Strategies to improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors  in 
other clinical indic ations . 
Recently, seve ral studies focused in modifying the tumor -immune microenvironment 
(TME) with small molecules that increase the number of activated T cells exerting 
tumoricidal activity and/or suppressing growth promoting macrophages in the TME.  
These drugs include microbiota modifiers, drugs targeting co -inhibitory receptors, anti -
angiogenic therapeutics, small molecules, and oncolytic viruses.  
The vascular network with its specific components (endothelial cells, pericytes, growth 
factors, and r eceptors) plays a key role in the regulation of inflammatory response, wound 
healing, and immune surveillance. The transit of immune cells in the tumor plays a critical 
role in the outcome of immunotherapeutic strategies, similarly to classical 
chemotherap eutic drugs. In particular, a normalized endothelium ensures the correct 
trafficking of T cells to the tumor be d (28). In fact, tumor angiogenesis contributes to the 
escape of the immune tumor through the immunosuppressive activity exerted by VEGF, 
PGE2, IL -10, and tumor hypoxia. In particular, VEGF acts through both the inhibition of 
lymphocyte adhesion to activated endothe lial cells and the systemic effect on immune -
regulatory cell function, including the suppression of DCs maturation, the inhibition of T 
cell development, and the increase of inhibitory immune cells . Therefore, the possibility 
of administering immune checkp oint inhibitors  during an anti -angiogenic treatment has 
been studied in different types of cancers according to the hypothesis that anti -angiogenic 
drug-induced normalization of the vessels may improve immunotherapeutic strategies.

Confidential and Proprietary  26 Final Protocol: September 26, 2019  
 On the other hand, immun e checkpoint inhibitor  activation of Th1 cells blocked vessel 
normalization, suggesting the existence of a mutually regulatory circuit . 
It is interesting to note that a combination of small molecules and immune checkpoint 
inhibitors  have been evaluated in a mouse model of oral cancer. In this neoplasia, both 
activation of PI3K/mTOR and MEK/ERK pathways promoted the immunosuppressive 
tumor microenvironment  [28]. In an immunogenic model of cancer of the oral cavity, 
rapamycin reduced tumor growth in a CD8 -dependent manne r (28). More  recently, Moore 
et al.  (28) demonstrated that rapamycin improved IFNγ production by peripheral and 
tumor -infiltrating CD8 T cells in a mouse model of oral cancer. Furthermore, antitumor 
efficacy was enhanced by the CD8 T cell but n ot by NK cell. Non -inflamed tumor models, 
which represent the low level of response to immune therapies, did not induce T cell or 
NK CD8 cell –mediated antitumor immunity when treated with combinations of targeted 
and immune checkpoint inhibitors s. In other  models, antitumor immune responses to PD -
L1 mAb treatment were enhanced when treated with mTOR inhibitors. These data 
suggested that a combination of mTOR and ICIs inhibitors should be evaluated in clinical 
trials setting.  An appealing concept is to utili ze a tumor targeted rapamycin, nab 
rapamycin (ABI -009) to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, specifically 
nivolumab in various cancer types wherein immune checkpoint inhibitors are already 
shown to be effective and are already FDA approv ed. 
1.2. ABI-009 Background  
1.2.1.  Rapamycin and Rapalogs  
Rapamycin is a crystalline powder with the empirical formula C51H79NO13 and a 
molec ular weight of 914.17. Rapamycin is a protein kinase inhibitor that is approved for 
immunosuppression in renal transplant patients , and is under investigation as a cancer 
treatment. Rapamycin inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin , mTOR, a regulatory 
protein kinase in cancer that recognizes high stress levels, including depleted nutrient 
levels and states of h ypoxia (29). mTOR is a serine/threonine -specific protein kinase, 
downstream of the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI3K)/Akt (protein kinase B) pathway, 
and a key regulator of cell survival, proliferation, stress, and metabolism. Additionally, 
mTOR is involved in regula ting angiogenesis by controlling endothelial and smooth 
muscle cell proliferation via the hypoxia -inducible factor -1α and vascular endothelial 
growth factor (30). Consistent with its role in cell proliferation, the mTOR pathway is 
frequently overactivated in a number of human malignancies , and is  thus considered to 
be an attractive target for anti -cancer therapy. Rapamycin and its analogs (rapalogs) 
function as allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1 . Rapalogs  are currently used in the treatment 
of advanced renal cell carcinoma and other t umors (31). 
Numerous preclinical studies have reported the impact of different biomarkers involved in 
the mTOR pathway, on the efficacy of mTOR inhibitors, such as:  
• PI3K, TSC1, TSC2, PI3 K, AKT, and PTEN gene mutations (32) 
• Phosp horylated p -AKT, p -S6, p -4EBP1 expression  (33) 
• biomarkers for the proliferati on (Ki -67) and  apoptosis (PARP) (31) 
ABI-009/Nivolumab

Confidential and Proprietary  27 Final Protocol: September 26, 2019  
 However, no clinical studies have confirmed the importance of these biomarkers as 
predictive factors of efficacy, except PI3K  mutation in non PEComa tumors such as breast 
carcinoma  (32). 
Although rapamycin , an oral therapeutic,  is an efficacious mTOR inhibitor, it has poor 
solubility, low oral bioavailability, and dose -limiting toxicity (29, 34). Marke ted rapamycin 
analogs are temsirolimus and everolimus. Temsirolimus,  approved for the treatment of 
kidney cancer , is a prodrug of rapamycin and requires conversion by the CYP3A enzyme . 
Everolimus is approved for pediatric and adult patients with subependym al giant cell 
astrocytoma , for advanced hormone receptor -positive, HER2 -negative breast cancer in 
combination with exemestane, progressive neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin 
(PNET s), subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with tuberous 
sclerosis and advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure of treatment with sunitinib or 
sorafenib (35-39). 
Oral rapamycin and currently available rapalogs induce common side effects including 
hypertension, maculopapular rash (7 5%), mucositis (50%), asthenia (40%), nausea 
(43%), thrombocytopenia, metabolic abnormalities and more rarely pneumonitis (8%, 3% 
grade 3) sometimes fatal (40-42). The most frequently occurring grade 3 or 4 adverse 
events were hyperglycemia (17%), hyp ophosphatemia (13%), anemia (9%), and 
hypertriglycer idemia (6%) (43). These side effects could lead to the discontinuation of the 
treatment in 60% of patients in some studies.  
1.2.2.  ABI-009 ( nab-Rapamycin)  
The novel nanoparticle albumin -bound rapamycin ( nab-rapamycin , ABI -009) is freely 
dispersible in saline and is suitable for intravenous administration , and ha s produced both 
a favorable safety profile and evidence of efficacy in patients with metastatic solid tumors  
(44). 
Nanoparticle albumin -bound or nab® technology (Abraxis BioScience, a wholly -owned 
subsidiary of Celgene Corporation) when applied to hydrophobic molecules, such as 
paclitaxel ( nab-paclitaxel; Abraxane®), has led to improved drug delivery, safety, and 
efficacy in various solid tumors compar ed with the conventional paclitaxel formulation 
(45). This suggests that the nab formulation of rapamycin may also produce similar 
advantages over the standard rapamycin.  
The nab technology may enhance tumor penetration and accumulation via the albumin 
receptor -mediated (gp60) endothelial transcytosis. Albumin is highly soluble, has long 
plasma ha lf-life, broad binding affinity, and accumulates in tumors, making it an ideal 
candidate for drug delivery (45, 47). Albumin circulating in the bloodstream can interact 
with gp60 to initiate caveolae -mediated transcytosis to reach tumor cells  (48, 49). Indeed, 
nab-paclitaxel transcytosis across the epithelial monolayer was dependent on caveolae 
formation  (50). In accordance with these observations, at equal doses, nab-paclitaxel 
showed greater selectivity to tumors compared with solvent -based paclitaxel, which is 
likely attributed to the biologically active ingredient albumin and lack of solvent (50).

 1.2.3.  Preclinical Studies with ABI-009 
Preclinical primary pharmac ology studies in vivo demonstrated significant antitumor 
activity of ABI-009 as a single agent administered intravenously at 40 mg/kg, 3 times 
weekly for 4 weeks, across different tumor xenograft models in nude mice (see Figure  1 
below), including breast, colorectal, multiple myeloma, and pancreatic cancer (51-55). 
This dose level correlates to approximately 120 m g/m2 in human. These findings are 
consistent with published information on rapamycin as an mTOR inhibitor and the role of 
mTOR in tumor growth (56). In addition, recent preclinical study has demonstrated that 
combination of ABI-009 with the Akt inhibitor perifosine induced synergistic antitumor 
activity in mult iple myeloma (54). 
Figure  1: Antitumor Activity of ABI-009 in Tumor Xenografts  
 
Preclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in rats showed that intravenously administered 
ABI-009 exhibited linear PK with respect to dose and large volume of distribution (Vz), 
due to efficient tissue extraction of rapamycin from the central blood compartme nt (53). 
Shortly  after dosing, tissue rapamycin level was 3 -5 fold higher than that of blood, 
indicating efficient extraction. The terminal half life of ABI-009 was long in rats, ranging 
from 13.4 - 25.8 hours and resulted in significant blood level at 48 hours (~10 ng/ml ) and 
120 hours (>1 ng/ml). Consistent with literature of rapamycin (57), excretion of ABI-009 
was primarily through the fecal route (68.57 - 69.99%) with minimum contribution from 
the renal route (7.73 - 8.84%).  
The safety and toxicity of ABI-009 were evaluated in a series of preclinical stud ies. In a 
GLP repeat -dose toxicity study in male and female rats, ABI -009 administered IV was 
well tolerated at doses up to 90 mg/kg (equivalent to 540 mg/m2 human dose)  when 

ABI-009/Nivolumab  
Protocol: SOC -1701     Sarcoma Oncology Research Center  
 
Confidential and Proprietary  29 Final Protocol: September 26, 2019  
 delivered every four days for 3 cycles . Nonclinical toxicology studies of ABI-009 showed 
no new or unexpected toxicity compared to what is already known for rapamycin  and 
other rapalogs (58-60). 
1.2.4.  Clinical Studies with ABI-009 
In a phase 1 dose escalation, tolerability and pharmacokinetics study conducted at MD 
Anderson Cancer Center (Protocol CA -401), ABI-009 was well tolerated with evidence of 
responses and SD in various solid tumors including renal cell carcinoma and bladder 
cancer, both of which typically express mTOR (42). Twenty -six patients were treat ed with 
45, 56.25, 100, 125, 150 mg/m2 ABI-009 per week for 3 weeks, followed by a week of rest 
(28-day cycle). ABI-009 was  administered intravenously. The maximum tolerated dose 
was established at 100 mg/m2. 
Nineteen  patients were evaluable for efficacy . One patient in the 45 mg/m2 (95 mg actual 
rapamycin dose) cohort diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the kidney and with bone and 
intrathoracic metastases had a confirmed PR. The target lesion of this patient was 
reduced by 35.1% and the duration of response  lasted 183 days. Two (11%) patients (at 
doses 45 and 125 mg/m2, with actual rapamycin doses of 88 mg and 193 mg, 
respectively) had an overall tumor evaluation of SD (confirmed): 1 patient with 
mesothelioma had SD for 365 days and 1 patient with a neuroend ocrine tumor in the left 
axillary node had SD for 238 days.  
In the phase 1 study  described above , for all cohorts and all grades, 25 of 26 (96%) 
patients experienced at least 1 AE. The most common AEs were mucosal inflammation 
(10 patients, 38%), fatigue (7 patients, 27%), rash (6 patients, 23%), diarrhea (6 patients, 
23%), and nausea (5 patients, 19%). Most of these AEs were grade 1/2 events, with only 
3 grade 3 nonhematologic AEs (2 elevated AST and 1 dyspnea). Specifically, at the 
maximum -tolerated dose  (MTD, 100 mg/m2), all 7 patients experienced at least 1 AE of 
any grades, and the most common AEs were mucositis and fatigue (5 patients, 71% 
each). Four (15%) patients experienced at least 1 treatment -related serious AE, including 
arrhythmia (grade 2) and mood alteration (grade 3) both in the 125 mg/m2 cohort, vomiting 
(grade 3) in the 45 mg/m2 cohort, and dyspnea (grade 3) in the 100 mg/m2 cohort.  
The most common hematologic AEs, for all cohorts and grades, were thrombocytopenia 
(58%), followed by hypo kalemia (23%), anemia and hypophosphatemia (19% each), and 
neutropenia and hypertriglyceridemia (15% each). Most of these events were grade 1/2, 
and only 1 grade 4 hematologic event occurred (thrombocytopenia in the 150 mg/m2 arm). 
At the MTD, the only hem atologic AE was a grade 3 anemia.  In this clinical study, 16 of 
26 patients (62%) had treatment -related adverse events ( TRAEs ) requiring a week dose 
delay .  
1.3. Nivolumab Background  
Nivolumab is a n FDA -approved  human monoclonal antibody that blocks the intera ction 
between PD -1 and its ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2. Nivolumab is an IgG4 kappa 
immunoglobulin that has a calculated molecular mass of 146 kDa  (64).

 1.3.1.  Nivolumab Mechanism of Action  
Binding of the PD -1 ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2, to the PD -1 receptor found on T cells, 
inhibits T -cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD -1 ligands occurs 
in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active 
T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Nivolumab is a human immunoglob ulin G4 (IgG4) 
monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD -1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD -
L1 and PD -L2, releasing PD -1 pathway -mediated inhibition of the immune response, 
including the anti -tumor immune  response. In syngeneic mouse tumor models , blocking 
PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth  (64). 
1.3.2.  Nivolumab Clinical Studies  
Trial 1 was a multicenter, open -label trial that randomized (2:1) patients with unresectable 
or metastatic melanoma to receive either nivolumab  administered intravenously at 3 
mg/kg every 2 weeks or investigator’s choice of chemotherapy, either single -agent 
dacarbazine 1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks or the combination of carboplatin AUC 6 every 
3 weeks plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Patients were required to have 
progre ssion of disease on or following ipilimumab treatment and, if BRAF V600 mutation 
positive, a BRAF inhibitor. The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease, medical 
conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression, ocular melanoma, active brain 
metasta sis, or a history of Grade 4 ipilimumab -related adverse reactions (except for 
endocrinopathies) or Grade 3 ipilimumab-related adverse reactions that had not resolved 
or were inadequately controlled within 12 weeks of the initiating event. Tumor 
assessments  were conducted 9 weeks after randomization then every 6 weeks for the 
first year, and every 12 weeks thereafter.  
Efficacy was evaluated in a single -arm, non -comparative, planned interim analysis of the 
first 120 patients who received nivolumab  in Trial 1  and in whom the minimum duration 
of follow up was 6 months. The major efficacy outcome measures in this population were 
confirmed objective response rate (ORR) as measured by blinded independent central 
review using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid T umors (RECIST 1.1) and duration of 
response.  
Among the 120 patients treated with nivolumab , the median age was 58 years (range: 
25-88), 65% of patients were male, 98% were white, and the ECOG PS was 0 (58%) or 
1 (42%). Disease characteristics were M1c dis ease (76%), BRAF V600 mutation positive 
(22%), elevated LDH  (56%), history of brain metastases (18%), and two or more prior 
systemic therapies for metastatic disease (68%).  
The ORR was 32% (95% confidence interval: 23, 41), consisting of 4 complete respon ses 
and 34 partial responses in nivolumab -treated patients. Of 38 patients with responses, 33 
patients (87%) had ongoing responses with durations ranging from 2.6+ to 10+ months, 
which included 13 patients with ongoing responses of 6 months or longer.  
There were objective responses in patients with and without BRAF V600 mutation 
positive -melanoma.

 1.3.3.  Nivolumab Adverse Events  
The data described in the WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS section  of the nivolumab 
(Opdivo ) product information  and below reflect exposure to nivolumab  in Trial 1, a 
randomized, open -label trial in which 370 patients with unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma received nivolumab  3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=268) or investigator’s choice of 
chemotherapy (n=102), either dac arbazine 1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks or the 
combination of carboplatin AUC 6 every 3 weeks plus pac litaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 
weeks . The median duration of exposure was 5.3 months (range: 1 day -13.8+ months) 
with a median of eight doses (range: 1 to 31) in nivolumab -treated patients and was 2 
months (range: 1 day -9.6+ months) in chemotherapy treated patients. In this ongoing trial, 
24% of patients received nivolumab  for greater than 6 months and 3% of patients received 
nivolumab  for greater than 1 year.  
Clinic ally significant adverse reactions were also evaluated in 574 patients with solid 
tumors enrolled in two clinical trials receiving nivolumab  at doses of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg every 
2 weeks,  supplemented by immune -mediated adverse reaction reports across ongoing 
clinical trials .   
In Trial 1, patients had documented disease progression following treatment with 
ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. The trial excluded 
patients with autoimmune disease, prior ipilimumab -related Grade 4 adve rse reactions 
(except for endocrinopathies) or Grade 3 ipilimumab -related adverse reactions that had 
not resolved or were inadequately controlled within 12 weeks of the initiating event, 
patients with a condition requiring chronic systemic treatment with c orticosteroids (>10 
mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications, a positive test 
for hepatitis B or C, and a history of HIV.  
The study population characteristics in the nivolumab  group and the chemotherapy group 
were similar: 66 % male, median age 59.5 years, 98% white, baseline ECOG performance 
status 0 (59%) or 1 (41%), 74% with M1c stage disease, 73% with cutaneous melanoma, 
11% with mucosal melanoma, 73% received two or more prior therapies for advanced or 
metastatic disease, and 18% had brain metastasis. There were more patients in the 
nivolumab  group with elevated LDH at baseline (51% vs. 38%).  
• Immune -mediated Grade 2 pneumonitis    
Severe pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease, including fatal cases, occurred with 
nivoluma b treatment. Across the clinical trial experience in 574 patients with solid tumors, 
fatal immune -mediated pneumonitis occurred in 0.9% (5/574) of patients receiving 
nivolumab . No cases of fatal pneumonitis occurred in Trial 1; all five fatal cases occurre d 
in a dose -finding study with  nivolumab  doses of 1 mg/kg (two patients), 3 mg/kg (two 
patients), and 10 mg/kg (one patient).  
In Trial 1, pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 3.4% (9/268) of 
patients receiving nivolumab  and none of the 102 patients receiving chemotherapy. 
Immune -mediated pneumonitis, defined as requiring use of corticosteroids and no clea r 
alternate etiology, occurred in 2.2% (6/268) of patients receiving nivolumab : one with 
Grade 3 and five with Grade 2 pneumonitis. The median time to onset for the six cases 
was 2.2 months (range: 25 days-3.5 months). In two patients, pneumonitis was diag nosed 
ABI-009/Nivolumab  
Protocol: SOC -1701     Sarcoma Oncology Research Center  
 
Confidential and Proprietary  32 Final Protocol: September 26, 2019  
 after discontinuation of nivolumab  for other reasons, and Grade 2 pneumonitis led to 
interruption or permanent discontinuation of nivolumab  in the remaining four patients. All 
six patients received high -dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone  equivalents 
per day); immune -mediated pneumonitis improved to Grade 0 or 1 with corticosteroids in 
all six patients. There were two patients with Grade 2 pneumonitis that completely 
resolved (defined as improved to Grade 0 with completion of corticosteroi ds) and 
nivolumab  was restarted without recurrence of pneumonitis.  
• Immune -mediated Grade 2 -3 colitis   
In Trial 1, diarrhea or colitis occurred in 21% (57/268) of patients receiving nivolumab  and 
18% (18/102) of patients receiving chemotherapy. Immune -media ted colitis, defined as 
requiring use of corticosteroids with no clear alternate etiology, occurred in 2.2% (6/268) 
of patients receiving nivolumab : five patients with Grade 3 and one patient with Grade 2 
colitis. The median time to onset of immune -mediate d colitis from initiation of nivolumab  
was 2.5 months (range: 1 -6 months). In three patients, colitis was diagnosed after 
discontinuation of  nivolumab  for other reasons, and Grade 2 or 3 colitis led to interruption 
or permanent discontinuation of nivolumab  in the remaining three patients. Five of these 
six patients received high -dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equivalents) 
for a median duration of 1.4 months (range: 3 days -2.4 months) preceding corticosteroid 
taper. The sixth patient continu ed on low -dose corticosteroids started for another 
immune -mediated adverse reaction. Immune -mediated colitis improved to Grade 0 with 
corticosteroids in five patients, including one patient with Grade 3 colitis retreated after 
complete resolution (defined as improved to Grade 0 with completion of corticosteroids) 
without additional events of colitis. Grade 2 colitis was ongoing in one patient.  
• Immune -mediated hepatitis.  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) greater than 3 and up  to 5 times upper limit of normal 
(ULN) or total bilirubin greater than 1.5 and  up to 3 times ULN  
In Trial 1, there was an increased incidence of liver test abnormalities in the nibolumab -
treated group as compared to the chemotherapy -treated group, with in creases in AST 
(28% vs. 12%), alkaline phosphatase (22% vs. 13%), ALT (16% vs. 5%), and total bilirubin 
(9% vs. 0). Immune -mediated hepatitis, defined as requirement for corticosteroids and no 
clear alternate etiology, occurred in 1.1% (3/268) of patients receiving nivolumab : two 
patients with Grade 3 and one patient with Grade 2 hepatitis. The time to onset was 97, 
113, and 86 days after initiation of nivolumab . In one patient, hepatitis was diagnosed 
after discontinuation of  nivolumab  for other reasons. I n two patients, nivolumab  was 
withheld. All three patients received high -dose corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone 
equivalents). Liver tests improved to Grade 1 within 4-15 days of initiation of 
corticosteroids. Immune -mediated hepatitis resolved and  did not recur with continuation 
of corticosteroids in two patients; the third patient died of disease progression with 
persistent hepatitis. The two patients with Grade 3 hepatitis that resolved restarted 
nivolumab  and, in one patient, Grade 3 immune -medi ated hepatitis recurred resulting in 
permanent discontinuation of nivolumab .  
• Immune -mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction. Creatinine greater than 
1.5 and up to 6 times ULN or greater than 1.5 times baseline

treated group as compared to the chemotherapy -treated group (13% vs. 9%). Grade 2 or 
3 immune -mediated nephritis or  renal dysfunction (defined as >  Grade 2 increased 
creatinine, requirement for corticosteroids, and no clear alternate etiology) occurred in 
0.7% (2/268) of patients at 3.5 and 6 months after nivolumab  initiation, respectively. 
Nivolumab  was permanently discontinued in both patients; both received high -dose 
corticosteroids (at least 40 mg prednisone equi valents). Immune -mediated nephritis 
resolved and did not recur with continuation of corticosteroids in one patient. Renal 
dysfunction was ongoing in one patient.  
• Immune -mediated hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism  
In Trial 1, where patients were evaluated at baseline and during the trial for thyroid 
function, Grade 1 or 2 hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (21/268) of patients receiving 
nivolumab  and none of the 102 patients receiving chemotherapy. The median time to 
onset was 2.5 months (range: 24 days -11.7 months). Seventeen of the 21 patients with 
hypothyroidism received levothyroxine. Fifteen of 17 patients received subsequent 
nivolumab  dosing while continuing to receive levothyroxine.  
Grade 1 or 2 hyperthyroidism oc curred in 3% (8/268) of patients receiving nivolumab  and 
1% (1/102) of patients receiving chemotherapy. The median time to onset in nivolumab -
treated patients was 1.6 months (range: 0 -3.3 months). Four of five patients with Grade 
1 hyperthyroidism and two of three patients with Grade 2 hyperthyroidism had 
documented resolution of hyperthyroidism; all three patients received medical 
management for Grade 2 hyperthyroidism.  
• Any other severe or Grade 3 treatment -related adverse reactions   
Other clinically sign ificant immune -mediated adverse reactions can occur. Immune -
mediated adverse reactions may occur after discontinuation of nivolumab  therapy.  
The following clinically significant, immune -mediated adverse reactions occurred in less 
than 1% of nivolumab -treated patients in Trial 1: pancreatitis, uveitis, demyelination, 
autoimmune neuropathy, adrenal insufficiency, and facial and abducens nerve paresis.  
Across clinical trials of nivolumab  administered at doses of 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg the 
following additional clinically significant, immune -mediated adverse reactions were 
identified: hypophysitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, hypopituitarism, Guillain -Barré syndrome, 
and myasthenic syndrome.  
Nivolumab  was discontinued for adverse reactions in 9% of patients. Twenty -six percent 
of patients receiving nivolumab had a drug delay for an adverse reaction. Serious adverse 
reactions occurred in 41% of patients receiving nivolumab . Grade 3 and 4 adverse 
reactions occurred in 42% of patients receiving nivolumab . The most freque nt Grade 3 
and 4 adverse reactions reported  in 2% to less than 5% of patients receiving  nivolumab  
were abdominal pain, hyponatremia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, and 
increased lipase.  Other adverse events that occurred in >10% of patients were r ash, 
pruritus, cough , upper respiratory tract infection , peripheral edema , increased AST, 
increased alkaline phosphatase , hyponatremia , increased ALT , and h yperkalemia , with

 no Grade 3 -4 AE except for rash which was Grade 3 -4 in 0.4%. Other clinically important 
adverse reactions in less than 10% of patients treated with nivolumab  were:   
Cardiac Disorders: ventricular arrhythmia  
Eye Disorders: iridocyclitis  
General Disorders a nd Administration Site Conditions: infusion -related reactions 
Investigations: increased amylase, increased lipase   
Nervous System Disorders: dizziness, peripheral and sensory neuropathy   
Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, 
vitiligo, psoriasis.   
1.4. Rationale  for the  Schedule of the  Study  
In this study nivolumab will be given once every 3 weeks (D1 of a 3 week cycle) and ABI -
009 will be administ ered on D8 and D15 of the 3 week cycle starting in Cycle 2 (C2).  
Thus, ABI -009 will be given weekly for 2 weeks with a 1 week break.  
Although nivolumab is approved on a biweekly schedule, in this study, because 
nivolumab is being given in combination wit h ABI -009 which is administered 2 out of 3 
weeks, a 3 weekly schedule for nivolumab was adopted. In a prior Phase 3 combination 
study with ipililumab , nivolumab 3 mg/kg was given every 3 weeks during the time when 
combination therapy was give n (65). In this study, nivolumab and ABI -009 have different 
mechanisms of action. Therefore, it is not expected that the individual toxicities would 
significantly overlap. As a  safety  precaution, nivolumab will be given every three weeks  
(instead of every 2 weeks)  when used in combination with ABI -009. Additionally, 
escalating doses of ABI -009 will start two dose levels below the MTD  of 100 mg/m2 
observed in the Phase 1 study  (44), as well as a de -escalation  schedule if DLT is noted 
at Dose Level 1  (See Dose R eduction in Section 6). 
Nivolumab acts by blocking PD1, a negative regulator of T cell activation and response, 
thus promoting T cell activation and  allowing the immune system to atta ck the tumor  (66). 
Rapamycin  suppression of mTOR results in a multitude of effects including a disruption 
of the G1/S transi tion of the proliferation cycle and results  in a mid -to-late G1 arrest  (67). 
Rapamycin , by disrupt ing cytokine signaling that promotes lymphoc yte growth and 
differentiation, also promot es the expansion of Treg cells and depletes effector T cells, 
leading to immune suppression (68). It was therefore hypothesized that administering  
anti-PD1 antibody first will allow T cell activation, which will not be blunted by later 
administration of ABI -009. On the other hand, the addition of ABI -009 after anti -PD1 
antibody also allows ABI -009 to exert its antiproliferative activity and potentially to 
increase autophagy for enhanced antigen presentation (30).  In a recent  study with 
syngeneic B 16 mouse tumor model testing the combination  and sequencing  of anti -PD1 
antibody and ABI -009, the administration of anti -PD1 antibody for one week before 
combining with ABI-009 demonstrated better antitumor efficacy compared to anti -PD1 
/ABI-009 concurrent  treatment or ABI -009 administered for one week before anti -PD1 
antibody  [privileged communication by AADi  Bioscience Inc ].

 2. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND  ENDPOINTS  
2.1. Objectives  
2.1.1.  Primary  Objectives  
The prim ary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of ABI -
009 when used in combination with nivolumab in advanced UPS, liposarcoma, 
osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma .  
2.1.2.  Secondary  Objectives  
The secondary objectives are t o investigate the disease control r ate (DCR) , progression 
free survival  (PFS) , recurrence -free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS)  using 
nivolumab/ABI -009 combination therapy in advanced Ewing’s sarcoma, PEComa, 
epithelioid sarcoma, desmoid tumor, chordoma, non -small cell lung cancer, small cell lung 
cancer, urethelial carcinoma, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma 
of head and neck, hepatocellular carcinoma, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, MSI -
H/dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer, and tumors with genetic mutations sensi tive to 
mTOR inhibitors .  
2.1.3.  Exploratory  Objectives  
• To correlate DCR  based on Immune -related Response Criteria (irRECIST) with 
that based on RECIST v1.1.  
• To correlate DCR with PD -L1 and other biomarker expression in patients’ tumors  
• To correlate DCR with PTEN mutation in patient’s archived tumor  
2.2. Endpoints  
2.2.1.  Primary Endpoint  
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD)  
2.2.2.  Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints are  
• Disease control rate (DCR) , progression free survival (PFS), recurrence -free 
survival (RFS)  as determined by  the institution’s  radiologic assessment using 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST) v1.1 and irRECIST criteria  
(Hodi et al., 2016) ; and overall survival (OS).  
• PFS rate at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months , RFS at 4 months, median PFS, and median 
OS will be assessed separately in subgroups of patients with metastatic disease 
and locally advanced disease. Patients in the locally advanced tumor subgroup 
may be clinically indicated to receive surgery if there is  sufficient tumor shrinkage, 
which could introduce a bias in the assessment of the PFS rate at 4 months, 
median PFS, and OS. Recurrence -free survival (RFS) defined as progression free 
ABI-009/Nivolumab

Confidential and Proprietary  36 Final Protocol: September 26, 2019  
 survival + absence of disease progression or recurrence after surgical r esection 
has been added to the secondary endpoints to obviate this bias.  
2.2.3.  Exploratory Endpoints  
• Correlat ion between  DCR  based on Immune -related Response Criteria (irRECIST) 
with that based on RECIST v1.1.  
• Correlation between DCR with PD -L1 and other biomar ker expression in patients’ 
tumors .  
• Correlation between DCR and PTEN mutation in patient’s archived tumor  
2.3. Study Design  
This is an open label, dose -seeking phase 1 /2 study using a defined dose of nivolumab 
and escalating doses of A BI-009 given intravenously.  
I. Dose Escalation Phase 1 Part of Study:  The study will employ the standard “cohort 
of three” design (Storer, 1989). Three patients are treated at each dose level with 
expansion to six patients per cohort if DLT is observed in one of the three initially -enrolled 
patients at each dose level. If no DLT occurs after 2 doses, escalation to the next dose 
level will be permitted. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the highest safely 
tolerated dose, where not more than one patien t experienced DLT, with the next higher 
dose level having at least two patients who experienced DLT. Patients in the dose 
escalation study may continue treatment at their designated dose levels up to eighteen 
3-week treatment  cycles or until significant disease progression or unacceptable toxicity 
occurs. No intra -patient dose escalation will take place.  
Dose of nivolumab: 3 mg/kg IV over 30 min. q 3 weeks  
NB: ABI-009 will start after 2nd Nivo dose , and will be administered o n D8 and D15 
beginning in C2.  
Dose of ABI -009: Escalating doses IV over 30 min for 2 of every 3 weeks:

Note: DLT includes any > Grade 3 colitis, hepatitis, or pneumonitis, any Grade 1 -2 colitis, 
hepatitis or pneumonitis that recurs, worsens or persists with oral steroids longer than 14 
days, symptoms of adrenal crisis, any Grade 4 hematologic t oxicity or any        > Grade 
3 non -hematologic toxicity.   
 
II. Expansion Phase 2 Part of Study : Following dose escalation, an  additional 22-28 
patients will receive ABI -009 at the MTD and defined doses of nivolumab to assess overall 
safety and potential efficacy in a greater number of patients. Patients in the expansion

Confidential and Proprietary  37 Final Protocol: September 26, 2019  
 phase of the study may continue treatment up to 18 3-week treatment  cycles or until 
significant disease progression  or unacceptable toxicity occurs.  
The study will be conducted in compliance with International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practices (GCPs).  
Surgical Resection:  After three or more treatment cycle s, the principal investigator may 
recommend surgical debulking, complete surgical removal or a biopsy. If residual disease 
is present either by histopathological examination or by CT scan/MRI, repeat treatment 
cycles may be given 2 -4 weeks after surgery, i f the surgical incision has healed, and if 
the patient has < grade I toxicity.  
 
Resected or biopsied tumors will be analyzed for the effects of this dual therapy on 
disease control rate, and immune cell trafficking in the tumor microenvironment. Fresh 
and paraffin embedded tissue blocks will be analyzed by FACS for PD -L1 and other 
biomarkers, including Tregs, CD8+, CD4+ cells etc. Immunohistochemistry for cyclin G1, 
cyclin D1 and Ki67 will be conducted to determine the tumor's proliferative state. 
Histopat hologic examination for tumor necrosis and mitotic index will also be determined.  
 
Conditions for Continuation of Treatment in the Presence of Increased Tumor 
Size by CT scan or MRI Indicating Progressive Disease by RECIST v1.1:  
Treatment may be continued if: 
1. There are no signs or symptoms indicating unequivocal progression.  
2. There is no worsening of ECOG score attributable to progressive disease.  
3. There is no tumor growth at critical sites that is life -threatening.  
4. Patient signs an informed conse nt that he/she is aware of alternative therapies but  
    wishes to  defer these therapies.  
5. There is clinical benefit , as determined by investigator

5.1. Screening Evaluations  
This study will be conducted at a sin gle center, the Sarcoma Oncology  Research  Center, 
Santa Monica CA,  USA. Each  patient  who ente rs into the  screening  period  for the study  
receives  a unique patient  identification number before any stud y-related procedures are 
performed.  The patient  identification number will be assigned . This number will be used 
to identify the patient  throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study 
documentation related to that patient .  
The patient  identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical 
study; it must not be changed  after initial assignment, including if a patient  is rescreened.   
Before patient s may be entered into the study, the Sponsor  requires a copy of the site’s 
written IRB/IEC  approval of the protocol, informed consent form, and all other patient  
information and/or recruitment material, if applicable . A signed and dated Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) approved informed consent form  (latest approved version) must be 
obtained from each patient  prior to performing any study -specific procedures. All patient s 
or legally acceptable representatives must personally sign and date the consent form 
before commencement of study -specific procedu res. Adverse Events are to be collected 
for a patient  once t hey have signed the informed consent .  
Screening evaluations will be performed for all patients to determine study eligibility.  
These evaluations must be obtained ≤ 14 days prior to enrollment. An y questions 
regarding patient eligibility should be directed to AADi or other sponsor -nominated 
representatives or designees for approval.  
The following procedures are to be completed during the screening period , after signed 
informed consent has been obta ined,  designated in the Schedule of Assessments , Table

Confidential and Proprietary  50 Final Protocol : January 31, 2019  6. DESCRIPTION OF STUDY  TREATMENTS  (ABI-009/NIVO ) 
6.1. ABI-009/Nivolumab  Dosage, Administration, and Schedule  
For the Phase 1 part of study, p atients will receive nivolumab 3 mg/kg as IV infusion over 
60 min every 3 weeks, followed by escalating doses of ABI-009 56,  75, 100  mg/m2 for 2 
of every 3 weeks by IV infusion over 30 minutes . ABI-009 will start on Day 8 of Cycle 2. 
If DLT develops in more than 1 patient at Dose 56 mg/m2, the dose will be de -escalated to 45 
mg/m2 and to 30 mg/m2 if DLT develops at 45 mg/m2. Patients will co ntinue therapy until 
unequivocal clinical disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or until in the opinion of 
the investigator the patient is no longer benefiting from therapy, or at the patient’s 
discretion.   
For the Phase 2 part of study, p atients wil l receive nivolumab 3 mg/kg as IV infusion over 
30 min every 3 weeks, followed by ABI -009 at the MTD dose  for 2 of every 3 weeks by IV 
infusion over 30 minutes . ABI-009 will start on Day 8 of Cycle 2.  Patients will continue 
therapy until unequivocal clinic al disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or until in 
the opinion of the investigator the patient is no longer benefiting from therapy, or at the 
patient’s discretion.   
6.2. ABI-009 Dose Modification and Stopping Rules  
6.2.1.  Dosage Adjustments, Dela ys, Rules for Withholding or Restarting, 
Permanent  Discontinuation  
If, treatment cannot be administered on the planned visit date, ABI -009 may be 
administered +/- 2 days from the scheduled date. Prior to ABI -009 administration on Day 
1 of each cycle, patients must meet the following hematological requirements:  
• ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L 
• Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L 
• Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL  
The treatment will be on hold up to 14 days until the patient has fulfilled these criteria . 
If a Grade 4 hematologic toxicity occurs, the dose of ABI -009 is held until toxicity resolves 
to Grade 1 or less. The dose of ABI -009 is then modified according to the dose 
modification section. If a Grade 3 non -hematologic toxicity occurs, both nivolumab and 
ABI-009 a re withheld until toxicity resolves to Grade 1 or less. The dose of ABI -009 is 
then modified according to the dose modification section. Nivolumab has no dose 
modification.  
The maximum delay between a missed scheduled dose and the next one (whichever 
dose was missed) should not be longer than 14 days . Approval from the Medical Monitor 
is required to restart study treatment after ≥ 21 days of interruption.  
During the Phase 2 part of the study, d oses of ABI -009 will be reduced for hem atologic 
and other toxicit ies. Two levels of dose modifications are permitted according to the 
criteria below.  If MTD is determined to be 56 mg/m2, dose reductions will occur 
sequentially ( 45 mg/m2 and 30 mg/m2), there should be no direct reduction by two dose 
ABI-009/Nivolumab

Confidential and Proprietary  51 Final Protocol : January 31, 2019  levels . If a toxicity requiring dose modification occurs following the second dose 
reduction of ABI -009, further treatment should be discontinued. Dose adjustments are to 
be made according to the system sh owing the greatest degree of toxicity.  Toxicities will 
be graded using the NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 3. 
Guidelines for dose modifications and interruptions for management of common toxicities 
associated with the study treatment(s) are provided in this section:  
• General guidelines for clinically significant toxicities related to study treatment  
And 
• Specific guidelines for adverse events of special interest, which are events that 
have been observed with higher frequency or severity.  
In the event of clinically significant AE in any part of the study, treatment may be withheld 
and supportive therapy admini stered as clinically indicated.  If the toxicity or event is not 
grade 3/4 and resolves to baseline or grade  1 in less than or equal to 14 days of sto pping 
therapy, t hen treatment may be restarted.  Dose reduction of ABI -009 should be 
considered as clinically indicated.  
If the toxicity does not resolve to at least grade 1 in less than 14 days, withdrawal from 
treatment with the IP is recommended.  However , if the investigator and AADi Medical 
Monitor agree that further treatment would benefit the patient , treatment can continue with 
at least one dose level dose reduction,  per Table 4.  
Table 4.  Dose Level Reduction Guidelines  
Dose level  ABI-009 Dose/Schedule  
  1 Initial Dose : 56 mg/m2 
-1 (first dose reduction)   45 mg/m2 
-2 (second dose reduction)   30 mg/m2 
If an AE resolves to grade 1 or baseline at the reduced dose level, and no additional 
toxicities are seen during the following cycle  of study treatment at the reduced dose, the 
dose may be increased to the previous dose level.  
Any patient  meeting the criteria for Hy’s Law case (i.e. severe drug -induced liver inj ury) 
will be considered a dose -limiting toxicity . A Hy’s Law case is defined as: AST or ALT 
values of ≥  3 x ULN AND with serum total bilirubin level (TBL) of > 2 x ULN without signs 
of cholestasis and with no other clear alternative reason to explain the observed 
liver-related laboratory abnormalities.  
ABI-009 dose modification guidelines are outlined in Table 4 and Table 5 
 for clinically significant toxicities that are deemed related.  The dosing schedule is 
described in the Schedule of Assessments,  Table 2.

Rechallenge may be considered if an alternative cause for impaired liver tests (ALT, AS T, 
and ALP) and/or elevated TBL is discovered and the laboratory abnormalities resolve to 
normal or baseline.  
6.2.2.3.  Criteria for Rechallenge with ABI-009 After Potential Hepatotoxicity  
The decision to rechallenge the patient  should be discussed and agreed upon 
unanimously by the patient , investigator, and AADi medical monitor.  
If signs or symptoms recur with rechallenge, then ABI -009 should be permanently 
discontinued.  Patient s who clearly meet the criteria for permanent discontinuation (as 
described in Section  6.2.1 ) should never be rechallenged.  
6.2.3.  Overdose  
On a per dose basis, an overdose is defined as 10% over the protocol -specified dose of 
ABI-009 assigned to a given pat ient, regardless of any associated AEs or sequelae.  
On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as anything more frequent 
than the protocol required schedule or frequency.   
On an infusion rate basis, an overdose is defined as any rate faster t han the protocol -
specified rate  of 30 minutes for each infusion.

Confidential and Proprietary  59 Final Protocol : January 31, 2019  conducted as necessary. Any significant discrepancy will be recorded and reported to 
AADi  or their designee and a plan for resolution will be documented.  
Accurate record ing of all ABI -009 administration will be made in the appropriate section 
of the patient’s CRF and source documents. The investigator or designee is responsible 
for accounting for all study -specific IP either administered or in their custody during the 
course of the study.  
For Nivolumab, the Investigator, or designee, shall record the dispe nsing of  study drug 
to patients . The study drug record will be made available to AADi or authorized AADi -
designated monitoring personnel for t he purpose of accounting for the use of the  drug. 
Accurate recording of all nivolumab  administration will be made in the a ppropriate 
section of the patient’s CRF and source documents. The investigator or designee is 
responsible for accounting for all study -specific IP either administered or in their custody 
during the course of the study.  
7.3. ABI-009 Reconstitution  
NOTE: It is not a requirement to use filter needles in the preparation, or in -line filters 
during the administration of ABI -009. In any event, filters of pore size less than 15 microns 
(15 µm) must not be used.  
ABI-009 will be reconstituted by appropriate study person nel and administered to the 
patient in the study site (see below). The Investigator will calculate the BSA of the patient 
in order to determine the total amount of ABI -009 to be administered.  
Reconstitution and Use of ABI -009: 
1. Calculate the patient’s BSA a ccording to standard institutional methods.  
BSA will be calculated at baseline and recalculated if the weight changes by >10%.  
 Calculate the total dose (in mg) to be administered by:  
  Total Dose (mg) = BSA  (study dose mg/m2) 
2. Calculate the total number of vials required by:  
  Total Number of Vials = Total dose (mg)  
            100 (mg/vial)  
 Round up the number of vials to be reconstituted to the next higher whole number 
when a fractional number of vials is obtained by the above formula (e.g., if the total 
number of vials = 4.05 or 4.5, then 5 vials would be reconstituted).  
3. Using sterile technique, prepare the vials for reconstitution.  
4. Swab the rubber stoppers with alcohol.  
5. Reconstitute each ABI -009 vial by using a 50 -cc or 60 -cc sterile syringe t o inject  20 
mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection into each vial over a period of not less than 1 
minute (Note: Change the syringes after reconstituting every 3 vials).  
ABI-009/Nivolumab  
Protocol: SOC -1701                                             Sarcoma Oncology Research Center  
 
Confidential and Proprietary  60 Final Protocol : January 31, 2019  • Aseptically, reconstitute each vial by injecting 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride 
Injection.  
• Slowly  inject the 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection over a minimum of 1 
minute, using the sterile syringe to direct the solution flow onto the INSIDE WALL 
OF THE VIAL.  
• DO NOT INJECT  the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection directly onto the lyop hilized 
cake as this will result in foaming.  
• Once the injection is complete, allow the vial to sit for a minimum of 5  minutes to 
ensure proper wetting of the lyophilized cake/powder.  
• Gently  swirl and/or invert the vial slowly for at least 2 minutes until c omplete 
dissolution of any cake/powder occurs. Avoid  generation of foam.  
• If foaming or clumping occurs, stand solution for at least 15 minutes until foam 
subsides.  
• Each mL of reconstituted product will contain 5 mg of rapamycin.  
6. Calculate the exact total d osing volume (to the nearest mL) of 5 mg/mL suspension 
required for the patient:  
  Dosing volume (mL) = Total dose (mg)/5 (mg/mL)  
7. The reconstituted sample should be translucent and homogeneous without visible 
particulates. If unsuspended powder i s visible,  the vial should be  gently  inverted again 
to ensure complete resuspension, prior to use.  
8. Using a new, sterile 50 -cc or 60 -cc syringe, withdraw the reconstituted ABI -009 
solution. Do not remove the rubber stopper from the ABI -009 vials as this can 
compromis e the sterility of the drug preparation.  
9. Inject the calculated dosing volume of reconstituted ABI -009 suspension into an empty 
sterile, standard PVC or non -PVC IV bag using an injection port. Inject perpendicularly 
into the center of the injection port to avoid dislodging plastic material into the IV bag. 
Repeat steps 9 and 10 until the patient’s entire required dose is injected into the IV 
bag. 
10. Remove the injection port.  
11. Once the exact volume of reconstituted ABI -009 has been withdrawn from the vials, 
discard any excess solution left over in accordance with standard operating 
procedures for cytotoxic drugs.  
12. Administer the calculated dosing volume of reconstituted ABI -009 suspension by IV 
infusion over 30 minutes  (+/- 10 min) . The use of in -line filters i s not necessary; if used, 
in-line filters with pore sizes of < 15  microns (15 µm) should not be used. Upon 
completion of infusion, the infusion catheter should be flushed with ~2 mL normal 
saline  to ensure all drug has been infused .

temperature (<25°C).  
7.4. Receipt and Return of ABI -009 
Upon receipt of the study drug supplies, the Investigator or designee will conduct an 
inventory and sign both copies of the study drug receipt and forward one copy to the 
address indicated on the form. One copy of the receipt and the packing slip must be 
retained in the Investigator’s regulatory file records.  Investigator or  designee will be 
responsible for drug inventory, drug accountability, and disposition of unused study drug.  
A representative from AADi or his/her designee will inspect the study drug inventory, 
Drug Accountability Record form(s), and will arrange for the disposition of any remaining 
unused study drug. No study drug may be returned to AADi without the representative 
from AADi or other AADi -designated personnel first inspecting the study drug inventory 
and accountability documentation .

to 1.2 micrometer).   
• Do not coadminister other drugs through the same intravenous line.  
• Flush the intravenous line at end of infusion.   
7.6. Concomitant Medications and P rocedures  
Dexamethasone, 10 mg IV, will be given on D8 of every cycle, beginning Cycle 2 , to 
preempt or reduce the incidence/severity of pneumonitis and/or hepatitis  with combined 
use of nivolumab and ABI -009. 
All concomitant treatments, including blood and blood products, must be reported on the 
CRF. Throughout the study, investigators may p rescribe any concomitant medications or 
treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care except for those listed 
in Section 7.8. 
Concomitant therapies are to be collected from enrollment/randomization through the 
EOT Visit . Therapy name including indication, dose, frequency, route, start date and stop 
date will be recorded on each patient ’s CRF(s). 
7.7. Permitted Medications  and Procedur es 
The investigator must be informed as soon as possible about any medication taken from 
the time of screening until the end of the clinical phase of the study (final study visit). Any 
concomitant medication(s), including herbal preparations, taken during the study will be 
recorded in the CRF. The minimum requirement is that drug name, dose, and the dates 
of administration are to be recorded. Additionally, a complete list of all prior cancer 
therapies will be recorded in the CRF. 
Patient s should receive ful l supportive care during the study, including transfusions of 
blood and blood products, and treatment with antibiotics, anti -emetics, anti -diarrheas , and 
analgesics, and other care as deemed appropriate, and in accordance with their 
institutional guideline s. WBC growth factors may be administered at the discretion of the 
investigator, consistent with institutional guidelines.  
Extreme precaution must be taken with contraceptives (either combined or progesterone 
only), as it is not known if there is the potential of inhibition/induction of enzymes that 
affect the metabolism of estrogens and/or progestins.   
7.8. Prohibited Medications and Procedures  
The use of certain medications, and illicit drugs within 5 half -lives or 28 days, whichever 
is shorter prior to t he first dose of study drug and for the duration of the study  will not be

For the Phase 2 part of the study, the entire treated population (Full Analysis Set) will be 
the analysis population for all safety analyses. Adverse events will be coded using the 
NIH CTCAE v4.03. Summary tables will include the number and percentage of patients 
with AEs, serious AEs, fatal AEs and o ther AEs of interest. Safety will be analyzed in all 
patient groups together (metastatic and locally advanced). Although this study will not 
be large enough to allow firm conclusions about safety or efficacy, it will provide 
preliminary data on safety and efficacy that will be useful in planning future studies.  
Frequency tables, graphs, and summary statistics will be used for outcome data.  
Patient incidence of all treatment -emergent AEs  will be tabulated. Tables of fatal adverse 
events, serious adverse eve nts, treatment -related AEs, and adverse events leading to 
withdrawal from investigation product will also be provided.  
For select laboratory parameters, changes of laboratory values over time (e .g., change 
from baseline summary statistics), grade shifts i n laboratory values from baseline to worst 
on-study value, and grade 3 or higher laboratory toxicities will be summarized.  
The ECG measurements from this study will be performed as per standard of care for 
routine safety monitoring.  
For ABI -009 and nivol umab  exposure, summary statistic will be provided for total number 
of doses, average dose administered, and duration of each treatment.  
8.3. Efficacy Analysis  
The Efficacy Analysis Datas et includes all enrolled patients with measurable tumor per 
RECIST v1.1 at baseline who receive at least two dose s of ABI -009 and had a follow -up 
CT scan/MRI .  
The disease control rate (DCR; CR+PR+SD),  objective response rate (ORR; CR + PR), 
progression free survival (PFS), recurrence -free survival (RFS) will be assessed  by an 
local radiologic assessment using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) v1.1.

Protocol: SOC -1701                                             Sarcoma Oncology Research Center  
 
Confidential and Proprietary  66 Final Protocol : January 31, 2019  The focus of the study is to estimate the DCR  in patients treated with ABI -009 and 
nivolumab. Patients who progress before receiving ABI -009 will be replaced, and will not 
be included in the statistical analysis. The number and percentage of patients achieving 
disease control (CR, PR or SD)  will be summarized .  
Analysis of other efficacy endpoints,  PFS at 4 months, RFS at 4 months, median PFS, 
median RFS and median OS will be assessed for all subtypes together, and separately 
in the five sarcoma subtypes with metastatic disease and locally advanced disease. 
Patients may be stratified further as loca lly advanced or metastatic. Patients in the locally 
advanced tumor subgroup may be clinically indicated to receive surgery if there is 
sufficient tumor shrinkage, which could introduce a bias in the assessment of the PFS  at 
4 months , median PFS, and OS. Recurrence -free survival (RFS) defined as progression 
free survival + absence of disease progression or recurrence after surgical resection has 
been added to the secondary endpoints to obviate this bias.  
PFS, RFS and OS will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier (KM) analysis. The number of 
patients  in each category is expected to be small; therefore, PFS at 4 months, RFS at 4 
months, median PFS, and median OS for these patients will be summarized by 
descriptive statistics.  
8.4. Exploratory Analysis  
DCR  based on RECIST v1 .1 will be correlated with DCR  based on Immune -related 
Response Criteria (irRECIST) and summarized by descriptive statistics  and comparative 
KM analysis.  
PD-L1 and other biomarker expression in patients’ tumors will be correlated with DCR  
and summarized by descriptive statistics.  
DCR will be correlated with presence of PTEN mutation in patient’s archived tumor and 
summarized by descriptive statistics.  
8.5. Covariates and Subgroups  
Up to 20 clinical indications will be studied , including Ewing’s sarcoma, PEComa, 
epithelioid sarcoma, desmoid tumor, chordoma, non -small cell lung cancer, small cell lung 
cancer, urethelial carcinoma, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcino ma 
of head and neck, hepatocellular carcinoma, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, MSI -
H/dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer, and tumors with genetic mutations sensitive to 
mTOR inhibitors , as well as t hose with metastatic disease and those with locally 
advanced  disease  for which surgery is not an option . The subgroups of patients will be 
assessed  together  and as subgroups  for the efficacy  endpoint s, 
In addition , the following covariates may be used to examine efficacy and/or safety in 
subgroup or covariate analyses , if sufficient number  of patients are enrolled in the 
subgroups : 
• Gender (male and f emale)  
• Age at enrollment (<65 vs ≥65 and <75 vs ≥75 years)  
• ECOG Pe rformance Status at baseline (0 vs 1)

8.6. Sample Size Considerations  
The analyses of all study objectives is descriptive and hypothesis generating in nature .  
The sample size will not be enough to make any statistical conclusions about efficacy or 
safety, but will be useful for planning future Phase 2 clinical trials.  
8.7. Primary Analysis  
The objective of the primary analysis is to address all study objectives and it will be 
conducted when all patients have had the opportunity to be treated for at least 6 months . 
All primary, secondary , and exploratory efficacy and safety analyses will be c onducted 
at the time of the primary analysis . 
8.8. Planned Methods of Analysis  
8.8.1.  General Considerations  
A clinical study report will be generated for the primary analysis.  The study report will be 
updated once the last data point is collected from the last patien t that is required for 
primary, secondary, and/or exploratory analysis, as pre -specified in the protocol.  
The analyses of all study objectives will be descriptive and hypothesis generating in 
nature .   
Continuous variables will be summarized by the non -missing sample size (n), mean, 
standard deviation, first and third quartiles, minimum and maximum. Categorical variables 
will be summarized by the n and percent in each category.  
Point estimate s for effic acy endpoint incidences  will be accompanied by a 2 -sided 95% 
exact binomial CI (69). 
Time  to event endpoints  will be summarized descriptively using  the KM method (70). KM 
quartiles (when estimable) along with the 95% 2 -sided CIs (71), the number of patients  
censored and the num ber of events will be provided.  Kaplan Meier  estimates will also be 
presented graphically.  
No adjustments for multiplicity are planned for the analysis of the efficacy endpoints.  
8.8.2.  General Considerations  
The secondary efficacy  endpoint, DCR , will be determined by a local radiologic 
assessment .   
The primary analysis will  evaluate  the DCR  in patients treated with ABI -009 and 
nivolumab by providing  the number and proportion of patients achieving disease control  
along with  an exact  binomial  95% CI for th e proportion.   
DCR  is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a confirmed CR, PR or SD  per 
RECIST v1.1. If an initial observation of objective response (CR or PR) is made, a 
confirmation scan should be done at 6 weeks after initial observation.

Analysis of other secondary efficacy endpoints PFS at 4 months , RFS at 4 months, 
median PFS, and median OS will be done separately for the 5 sarcoma subtypes groups . 
Progression -free survival  is defined as the time from the first do se date  to the first 
observation of a disease  progress ion or death due to any cause. If a patient  has not 
progressed or died by the  data cutoff date, the PFS time will be censored at the time of 
the last evaluable t umor assessment.  
Recurrence -free survival (RFS)  is defined as the time from the first dose date to the first 
observation of a disease progression  or recurrence /progression  after surgical resection 
of tumor , or death due to any cause .  If a patient has not progressed or died by the  data 
cutoff date, the R FS time will be censored at the time of the last evaluable tumor 
assessment.  
Overall survival  is defined as the time from the fi rst do se date  to the date of death due to 
any c ause . If a pa tient is lost t o follo w-up befo re the data cutoff date or still alive by the 
data cutoff date the OS time will be censored at the last contact date.

Confidential and Proprietary  69 Final Protocol : January 31, 2019  9. MONITORING, RECORDIN G AND REPORTING OF A DVERSE 
EVENTS  
9.1. Toxicities of ABI -009  
ABI-009 is a formulation of rapamycin. No unexpected toxicities not already known for 
rapamycin  (Rapamune®) or the rapamycin  prodrug, temsirolimus  (Torisel®), were 
identified in the nonclinical toxicity studies , or observed in the phase 1 studies for ABI -
009. 
More details on the know n precautions, warnings, and AEs of rapamycin  and rapalogs  
are found in the Rapamune® and Torisel® Package Insert s (58, 59). 
9.2. Toxicities of Nivolumab  
Nivolumab is an FDA approved monoclonal antibody for the treatment of advanced 
melanoma, non small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma and bladder cancer. The 
toxicities of nivolumab are immune -related adverse events including immune -mediated 
pneumonitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies and visual disorders. More details and known 
precautions, warnings and AEs are  found in the product information 
(www.accessdata.fda.gov).  
An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or 
worsen in a patient  during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a 
worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the patient ’s 
health, including laboratory test values (as specified by the criteria below), regardless of 
etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or 
inten sity of a preexisting conditi on) should be considered an AE.  A diagnosis or syndrome 
should be recorded on the AE page of the CRF rather than the individual signs or 
symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome. Note:  Disease progression and death due will 
not be  recorded as an AE.  
Abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to the IP  should be reported as an AE. Overdose, 
accidental or intentional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be reported on 
the appropriate  CRF, see Section 6.2.3  for the definition of overdose. Any sequela of an 
accidental or intentional overdose of the IP  should be re ported as an AE on the AE CRF. 
If the sequela of an overdose is an SAE, then the sequela must be reported on an SAE  
report for m and on the AE CRF.  The overdose resulting in the SAE should be identified 
as the cause of the event on the SAE report form and CRF but should not be reported as 
an SAE itself.  
All patients will be monitored for AEs during the study. Assessments may incl ude 
monitoring of any or a ll of the following parameters:  the patient ’s clinical symptoms, 
laboratory, pathological, radiological or surgical findings, physical examination findings, 
or other appropriate tests and procedures.  
All AEs will be recorded by th e investigator from the time the patient  signs informed 
consent until 28 days after the last dose of ABI-009 and those SAEs made known to the 
investigator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being related to IP. AEs and SAEs 
will be recorded on th e AE page of the CRF and in the patient ’s source documents. All 
ABI-009/Nivolumab  
Protocol: SOC -1701                                             Sarcoma Oncology Research Center  
 
Confidential and Proprietary  70 Final Protocol : January 31, 2019  SAEs must be reported to AADi Drug Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report 
Form, or approved equivalent form.  
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a patient is to be 
removed from treatment due to an AE. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that 
all AEs observed by the investigator or reported by the patient tha t occur after the first 
dose of IP through the EOT V isit are reported using the applicable CRF (eg, Adverse 
Event Summary CRF).  
9.3. Evaluation of Adverse Events  
The investigator must assign the following AE attributes:  
• AE diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known ( if not known, signs or symptoms)  
• Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved)  
• Severity [and/or toxicity per protocol]  
• Assessment of relatedness to the IP 
• Assessment of relatedness to protocol -required procedures  
• Action taken  
The AE toxicity grading scale u sed will be the NCI CTCAE Version  4.03.  
9.4. Serious Adverse Events  
9.4.1.  Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is defined as an AE that meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening (places the patient  at immediate risk of death)  
• requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other medically important serious event  
An AE would meet  the criterion of “requires hospitalization”, if the event necessitated an 
in-patient admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).   
If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any of 
the serious crit eria, the event could be classified as an SAE under the criterion of “other 
medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could include allergic 
bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, drug -induced liver injury, or events that 
necessita te an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.  
Since the criteria for the CTCAE grading scale differs from the regulatory criteria for SAEs, 
if AEs correspond to grade 4 “life threatening” CTCAE grading scale criteria 
ABI-009/Nivolumab  
Protocol: SOC -1701                                             Sarcoma Oncology Research Center  
 
Confidential and Proprietary  71 Final Protocol : January 31, 2019  (eg, laborato ry abnormality reported as grade 4 without manifestation of life threatening 
status), it will be left to the investigator’s judgment to also repo rt these abnormalities as 
SAEs.  For any AE that applies to this situation, comprehensive documentation of the 
event’s severity status must be recorded in the patient ’s medical record.   
9.4.2.  Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs)  must be reported by the 
Investigator to their IRB in writing, and to the FDA within 7 days as required by law.  
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report 
Form in addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF.  All SAEs must be 
reported to AADi  Drug Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event 
by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form , or approved 
equivalent form. This instruction pertains to initial SAE reports as well as any follow -up 
reports.  
The investigator is required to ensure that the data on these for ms is accurate and 
consistent. This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to IP) that 
occur during the study (from the time of signing of the informed consent form to 28  days 
after the last dose of IP), and those made known to the investigator at any time thereafter 
that are suspected of being related to IP.   
The SAE report should provide a detailed description of the SAE and include a concise 
summary of hospital records  and ot her relevant documents. If a patient  died and an 
autopsy has been performed, copies of the autopsy report and death certificate are to be 
sent to AADi  Drug Safety as s oon as these become available. Any follow -up data will be 
detailed in a subsequent  SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form, and sent to 
AADi  Drug Safety.  
Where required by local legislation, the investigator is responsible for informing the 
IRB/EC of the SAE and providing them with all relevant initial and follow -up information 
about the event. The investigator must keep copies of all SAE information on file including 
correspondence with AADi  and the IRB/EC.  
9.5. Pregnancy and Breast Feeding Reporting  
If a pregnancy occurs in a female patient , or female partner of a male patient , while the 
patient  is taking protocol -required therapies , report the pregnancy to AADi as specified 
below.  In addition to reporting any pregnancies occurring during the study, investigators 
should monitor for pregnancies that occur up to 3 months after the last d ose of protocol -
required therapies.  
The investigator will follow the female patient  until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify AADi Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal 
or abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow -up Report Form, or approved 
equivalent form. If a lactation case occurs while  the female patient  is taking protocol -
required therapies, report the lactation case to AADi as specified below.  In addition to 
reporting a lactation case during the study, investigators should monitor for lactation 
cases that occur up to 1 week after the last dose of protocol -required therapies.

STUDY  
10.1.  Discontinuation from Investigational Product  
The following events are considered sufficient reasons for discontinuing a patient from 
the IP:  
• AE(s) (that are intolerable)  
• Disease progression  
• Physician decision  
• Withdrawal of consent (from treatment only)  
• Death  
• Lost to follow up  
• Protocol violation  
• Other (to be specified on the CRF) 
The reason for treatment discontinuation should be recorded in the CRF and in the source 
documents.  
10.2.  Discontinuation from the Study  
The following events are considered sufficient reasons for discontinuing a patient from 
the study:  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Death  
• Lost to follow up  
• Protocol violation  
• Other (to be specif ied on the CRF) 
The reason for study discontinuation should be recorded in the CRF and in the source 
documents.  
At the time of withdrawal, it should be determined whether the patient is withdrawing from 
treatment alone, or from treatment and collection of further data (e .g., survival).  Every 
effort should be made to collect survival  data after patient withdraws from treatment.  
Patient s have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without 
prejudice to his or her fut ure medical care by the physician or at the institution.  
10.3.  Investigator or Sponsor Decision to Withdraw or Terminate Patient’s 
Participation Prior to Study Completion  
The investigator and/or sponsor can decide to withdraw a patient (s) from  Investigational 
Product  and/or other protocol -required therapies, protocol procedures, or the study as a 
whole at any time prior to study completion.

Confidential and Proprietary  74 Final Protocol : January 31, 2019  11. REGULATORY OBLIGATIO NS 
11.1.  Informed Consent  
An initial  sample  informed consent form is provided for the investigator  to prepare  the 
informed consent document to be used at his or her site.  Updates to the template are to 
be communicated formally in writing from the investigator to AADi . The written informed 
consent document is to be prepared  in the language(s) of the potential patient population.  
Before a patient ’s participation in the clini cal study, the  investigator  is responsible  for 
obtaining written informed consent from the patient  after adequate explanation of the 
aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study and before  any 
protoco l-specific  screening  procedures or the IP is  administered.   
The investigator  is also responsible for asking the patient  if the patient  has a primary care 
physician and if the patient  agrees to have his/her primary care physician informed of the 
patient ’s participation in the clinical study . If the patient  agrees to such notification, the  
investigator  is to inform the patient ’s primary care physician of the patient ’s participation 
in the clinical study.  If the patient  does not have a primary care physician and the  
investigator will be acting in that capacity, the  investigator  is to document such in the 
patient ’s medical record . 
The acquisition of informed consent  and t he patient ’s agreement or refusal of his/her 
notification of the primary care physician  is to be documented in the patient ’s medical 
records, and the informed consent form  to be signed  and personally  dated  by the patient  
or a legally acceptable representative  and by the person who conducted  the informed 
consent discussion.  The original  signed  informed  consent  form is to be retained in 
accordance with institutional policy, and a copy of the signed consent form  is to be 
provided  to the patient  or legally acceptable representativ e. 
If a potential patient  is illiterate or visually impa ired and does not have a legally acceptable 
representative, the  investigator must provide an impartial witness to read the informed 
consent form to the patie nt and must allow for questions.  Thereafter, both the patient  and 
the witness must sign the informed consent form to attest that informed consent was 
freely given and understood.   
11.2.  Institutional Review Board/Independent  Ethic s Committee  
A copy of the protocol, proposed informed consent form, other written patient  information, 
and any proposed advertising material must be submitted to the  IRB for written approval . 
A copy of the written approval of the protocol and infor med consent form mus t be received 
by AADi before recruitment of patient s into the study and shipment of AADi IP. 
The investigator  must submit and, where necessary, obtain approval from the  IRB for all 
subsequent protocol amen dments and changes to the informed consent document.  The  
investigator  is to notify the IRB of deviations from the protocol or SAEs  occurring at the 
site and other AE reports received from AADi, in accordance with local procedures.  
The investigator  is responsible for obtaining annual  IRB approva l [IRBs only]/renewa l 
[IRBs and IECs] throughout the duration of the study.  Copies of the investigato r’s report s 
and the IRB  continuance of approval must be sent  to AADi.

Confidential and Proprietary  75 Final Protocol : January 31, 2019  11.3.  Patient Confidentiality  
The investigator  must ensure that the patient ’s confidentiality is maintained  for documents 
submitted to AADi.  
• Patient s are  to be identified  by a uniqu e patient  identification numbe r. 
• Where permitted, date of birth  is to be documented and formatted in 
accordance with local laws and regulation s. 
• On the CRF demographics page, in addition to the  uniqu e patient  identification 
number, include the  age at time of enrollmen t. 
• For SAEs  reported to AADi, patient s are to be identified by their unique patient  
identification numbe r, initial s (for faxed  reports,  in accordance  with local laws 
and regulations), and da te of birth  (in accordance with local laws and 
regulations ). 
• Documents that are  not subm itted to AADi (eg, signed informed consent forms)  
are to be kept in confidence by the  investigato r, except as described belo w. 
In compliance with  Federal regulations/ICH GCP Guidelines, it is required that the 
investigator  and institution permit authorized re presentatives of  the company, of the 
regulatory agency(s), and the  IRB direct access to review the patient ’s original medical 
records for verification of stud y-related procedures and data.  Direct access includes 
examining, analyzing, verifying, and  reproducing any records and reports that are 
important to the evaluation of the study.  The investigator  is obligated to inform and  obtain 
the consent of the patient  to permit  such individual s to have access to his/her stud y-
related records, including pe rsonal information.  
 
11.4.  Protocol Amendments   
If investigator amends the protocol, agreement from AADi  must be obtained.  The IRB 
must be informed of all amendments and give approval.  The investigator must send a 
copy of the approval letter from the  IRB to AADi.  
11.5.  Termination of the Stu dy 
Both AADi and the i nvestigator reserve the right to terminate the  Investigato r’s 
participation  in the study according to the study contract.  The investigator  is to notify the  
IRB in writing of the study’s completion or early termination and send a copy of the 
notification to AADi.

Confidential and Proprietary  76 Final Protocol : January 31, 2019  12. DATA HANDLING AND RE CORDKEEPING  
12.1.  Data/Documents  
The investigator must ensure that the records and documents pertaining to the conduct 
of the study and the distribution of the investigational product  are complete, accurate, 
filed, and retained. Examples of source documents include: hospital records; clin ic and 
office charts; laboratory notes; memoranda; checklists; dispensing records; recorded data 
from automated instruments; copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being 
accurate copies; microfiche; x -ray film and reports; and records kep t at the pharmacy; 
and the laboratories, as well as copies of CRFs or CD -ROM.  
12.2.  Data Management  
Data will be collected via CRF and entered into the clinical database . These data will be 
electronically verified through use of programmed edit checks specified by the clinical 
team.  Discrepancies in the data will be brought to the attention of the clinical team, and 
investigational site personnel, if necessary. Resolutions to these issues wil l be reflected 
in the database.  An audit trail within the system will tr ack all changes made to the data.  
12.3.  Investigator  Responsibilities for Data Collection  
The investigator  is responsibl e for compl ying with the requirements  for all assessments 
and data collection  (including patient s not receiving  protoco l-required therapies)  as 
stipulated in the protocol for each patient  in the study.  For patient s who withdraw prior to 
completion of all protoco l-required visits and are  unab le or unwilling to continue the 
Schedule of  Assessment s (Table 2), the investigator  can search  publically  available 
records (where permitted ) to ascertain survival status.   
This ensures that the data set(s) produced as an outcome of the study is/are as 
comprehensive as poss ible. 
12.4 Research Use of Fresh and Stored Human Samples, Specimens or Data  
• Intended Use: Samples and data collected under this protocol will be used to study 
the effects of combination therapy with ABI-009, an mTOR inhibitor that  affects the 
differentiation of M1 and M2 macrophages in the tumor microenvironment (TME), 
and a immun e checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab , that inhibits CTLA4 and PD -1 and 
ligands in the TME. No genetic testing will be conducted.  
• Resected or biopsied tumors that are > than 500 mm3 will be collected and cut into 
two pieces. One piece of tumor will be placed i n media, processed and analyzed 
by flow cytometry (FACS). The second piece will be placed in 10% neutral -buffered 
formalin and later processed to formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) blocks. 
Tumors that are < 500 mm3 in volume will be not be cut and the  whole tumor will 
be used for FACS analysis.   
• For biomarker studies, flow cytometry analysis will be for human CD45, CD3, CD4, 
CD8, CD56, LAG -3, PD -1 and PD -L1 markers. Cell suspensions will be divided in 
two tubes, and each tube will be analyzed independ ently for the individual set of 
markers. Tube 1: CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, PD -1, PD -L1, viability. Tube 2: 
ABI-009/Nivolumab

IBB, and FoxP3 regulatory T cells.  
• Histopathologic examination of resected o r biopsied tumors will be conducted, the 
degree of tumor necrosis and mitotic index will be assessed, and 
immunohistochemical analysis for expression of PD -1, PD -L1, CD8+, CD4+, 
CD19, CD20, CD45, NK, Ki67, cyclin G1, cyclin D1 will be conducted.   
• Storage:  Access to stored samples will be limited using a locked freezer.  Samples 
and data will be stored using codes assigned by the investigators.  Data will be 
kept in password -protected computers. Only investigators will have access to the 
samples and data.  
• Tracking: Data will be tracked using a secure database system (e.g. Merge eCOS).  
• Disposition at the completion of the study: All stored samples will be archived at 
the clinical site. Study participants who request destruction of samples will be 
notified of compliance with such request and all supporting details will be 
maintained for tracking.  
12.5 Future Use of Stored Specimens  
All samples and associated results will be no less than single coded prior to being 
shipped from the site for analysis, or storage.  Tracking of samples will be independent 
of the patient’s identification number for the study. Data collected for this study will be 
analyzed and stored at the clinical site. After the study is completed, the de -identified, 
archived data will be transmitte d to and stored in a secure database under the 
supervision of the principal investigator, for use by other researchers including those 
outside of the study. Permission to transmit data to the secure data base will be 
included in the informed consent.  
The patient retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by 
contacting the Investigator.  Following the request from the patient, the investigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and patient number so that any remaining 
blood or tumor  samples and any other components from the cells can be located and 
destroyed. Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are 
completed.   
The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative material s from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the request 
of the patient through the Investigator, at the end of the storage period, or as appropriate 
(e.g., the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certa in sample type no longer 
justifies keeping the sample). The patient has no commercial rights to the products and 
has no commercial rights to the data, information, discoveries, or derivative materials 
gained or produced from the sample.  
12.6 Sample Storage and Destruction  
Any blood or  tumor sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessment s (Table 
2) can be analyzed  for any of th e tests out lined in  the protocol and for any tes ts necessary 
to minimize risks to study patient s. This includes testing to ensure  analytical methods

Confidential and Proprietary  78 Final Protocol : January 31, 2019  produce  reliable and valid data  throughout the course of the study . This can also  include, 
but is not limited to, investigatio n of unexpected results, incurred sample reanalysis, and 
analyses for method transfer and comparability.  
All samples and associated results will be no less than single coded prior to being shipped 
from the  site for analysis, or storage.  Tracking of samples will be independent of the 
patient ’s identification number for the study. Results are stored in a secure database to 
ensure confidentiality.   
Results from this analysis are to be documented and maintaine d, but are not necessarily 
reported as part of this study.   
The records should be retained by the Investigator /Sponsor  according to ICH, local 
regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement, whichever is longer; but at a 
minimum, all study documentation must be retained for 2 years after the last marketing 
application approval in an ICH region or after at le ast 2 years have elapsed since formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of ABI -009. 
Since the evaluations are not expected to benefit the patient  directly or to alter the 
treatment course, the results of other exploratory studies are not placed in th e patient ’s 
medical record and are not to be made available to the patient , members of the family, 
the personal physician, or other third parties, except as specified in the informed consent.  
The patient  retains the right to request that the sample materia l be destroyed by 
contacting the Investigator.  Following the request from the patient , the i nvestigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and patient  number so that any remaining 
blood or tumor  samples and any other components from the cel ls can be located and 
destroyed. Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are 
completed.   
The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destr uction of the sample(s) at the request 
of the patient  through the Investigator, at the end of the storage period, or as appropriate 
(e.g., the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type no longer  
justifies keeping the sample).  If a commercial product is developed from this research 
project, the sponso r owns the commercial product. The patient  has no commercial rights 
to such product and has no commercial rights to the data, information, discoveries, or 
derivative materials gained or  produced from the sample.

13.1.  Study Monitoring  
The Institution representative, AADi representativ e(s) and regulatory authority inspectors 
are responsible for contacting and visiting the  investigator  for the purpose of inspecting 
the facilities and, upon request, inspecting the various records of the clinical study (eg, 
CRFs and other pertinent data) provided that patient  confidentiality is respected.  
The Institution representative together with the AADi representative  are responsible for 
verifying the CRFs as needed  throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; 
completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations 
on the conduct of clinical research.  Monitoring will include on -site visits with the 
investigator and his/her  staff as well as any appropriate communications by mail, email, 
fax, or telephone.  During monitoring visits, the facilities, IP storage area, CRFs, patient’s 
source documents, and all other study documentation will be inspected/reviewed by the 
AADi repres entative in accordance with the Study Monitoring Plan.    
The investigator  agrees  to cooperate  with the clinical monitor  to ensure that any problems 
detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in completing  CRFs, 
are resolved.  
13.2.  Audits and Inspections  
In accordance with ICH GCP and the sponsor’s  audit plans, this study may be selected 
for audit by representatives from AADi’s Inspection of site facilities (eg, pharmacy,  
protoco l-required therapy  storage areas, laboratories) and review of stud y-related records 
will occur to evaluate the study conduct and compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and 
applicable regulatory requirements.

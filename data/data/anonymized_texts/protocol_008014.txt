Title of Study: An Open -Label Study to Evaluate the Safety  and Tolerability  of PCS499 for 
the treatmen t of Necrobiosis Lipoidica  
Study center(s):  Approximately 4 centers in  the US 
Studied period (years):  
Estimated date first patient enrolls:  To Be Determined  
Estimated date last patient enrolls:  To Be Determined  
Estimated date last patient completes 1 year of treatment:  To Be 
Determined  Phase of  
development:  2 
OBJECTIVES:  
Primary Objective:  
To evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of PCS499 in patients with Necrobiosis 
Lipoidica 
  
Exploratory Objectives: 
To evaluate the efficacy of PCS499 on reducing clinical findings related to Necrobiosis 
Lipoidica  
To assess the pharmacodynamic activity of PCS499 on immunologic and inflammatory 
biomarkers 
 
Methodology:   
This is an open-label study that will evaluate the safety of PCS499 for the treatment of 
necrobiosis lipoidica (NL) and will inform the design of future studies.  Based on previous 
experience with PCS499, a 1200 mg daily dose administered as 600 mg BID was well-
tolerated in a study of patients with diabetic nephropathy, but had limited efficacy.  A recent 
Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers found that daily doses of 1800 mg administered as 900 
mg BID or 600 mg TID of PCS499 w ere safe and well tolerated.       
The study will consist of a 6 month treatment period followed by a 6 month extension period.   
Approximately 12 NL patients (6-9 patients without ulceration and 3-6 patients with 
ulceration) who also meet other inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study.  
Patients will be administered PCS499 900 mg BID.  Primary safety and exploratory efficacy

analysis will be performed after the last patient c ompletes the 6-month visit. Patients will 
have the option to continue dosing in an extension period for up to an additional 6 months.   
All patients will take PCS499 300 mg BID with food for 1 week.  Beginning at Week 2, 
patients will commence administration of twice daily dosing of three PCS499 300 mg tablets 
(900 mg BID) with food.  Patients will continue at their assigned dose for the remainder of 
the study.   
During the dosing period, if a patient receiving PCS499 900 mg BID experiences unacceptable toxicity (i.e., non- transient, moderate to severe limitation in activity) that is 
deemed by the Investigator to be related to study drug, his/her dose will be changed to 
PCS499 600 mg TID with food at the discreti on of the Investigator in consultation with the 
Medical Monitor.  If this dose is not tolerated, the dose will be further reduced to PCS499 
600 mg BID with food at the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor.  If 4 out of the first 6 patients dosed in this study require dose modification or discontinue from the study due to a drug- related adverse event within 1 month of dosing, 
consideration will be made to change the starting dose to 600 mg TID with food for all 
subsequent patients.  Efficacy and safety data will be collected at regular intervals throughout 
the course of the study.   
An analysis will be conducted to assess safety and exploratory efficacy after the last patient 
completes the 6 -month visit.  A final analysis of patients enrolled in the study will be 
conducted after the last patient completes the 12 -month visit.  
 
Number of patients (planned):  
• Total number enrolled into this open label study:  ~12 NL patients  
− 6-9 without ulcerations and 3-6 with ulcerations 
Diagnosis and Main criteria for Eligibility:  
Inclusion criteria:  
1. Male or female patients age 18 to 80 years of age, inclusive, at Screening.  
2. Biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of NL.  Biopsies of continually active lesions performed 
outside of this clinical study will need to be reviewed and the diagnosis confirmed by 
the study pathologist.  For patients with no previous history of biopsy, no biopsy 
within the previous 5 years, a biopsy that is not confirmed to be NL, or newly active 
lesion, a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of NL will be performed at the Screening visit.

STATISTICAL ANALYSES:  
Analysis Populations: 
Patients will be analyzed by assigned treatment group.  Analyses w ill be performed based on 
observed data, and missing values will not be imputed unless otherwise stated. 
• Safety Population:  Defined as all patients enrolled in the study who received at 
least 1 dose of treatment.  
• Efficacy Population (Modified Intent to T reat (mITT)):  Defined as all patients 
enrolled in the study who received at least 1 dose of treatment and has at least 1 post-baseline efficacy assessment.    
• Per-Protocol Population:  Defined as a subset of the Efficacy Population who did 
not have a majo r protocol violation as defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
• Biomarker Population:  Defined as all patients enrolled in the study who received at least 1 dose of treatment, participated in biomarker evaluations, and have appropriate samples available for analysis.    
Timing of Analyses: 
All endpoints will be analyzed after the last patient completes the 3 -month visit and the 6- 
month visit (primary) .  A final lock of the database and the final analyses will occur after the 
last patient completes the 12 -month visit.  
Patient Characteristics:  
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics will be presented for each treatment group by descriptive statistics as well as for the combined active groups. All descriptive summary 
statistics of continuous variables will include: n, me an, median, standard deviation, minimum 
and maximum. All descriptive summaries presenting frequencies and incidences will include 
n, % and N, where N is the total number of patients with recorded values in the 
corresponding group.  Patient completion status and exposure outcomes will be similarly 
presented.

Name of Active Ingredient: PCS499 
Safety Analyses:  
The safety analyses will be performed using the Safety Population and include adverse 
events, changes in physical exam findings, vital signs, and clinical laboratory values.   
Adverse events will be coded using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version 21.0 or higher).  The number and percent of patients 
reporting at least one adverse event will be summarized by System Organ Class (SOC) and 
Preferred Term (PT) and presented by dose level, severity, relationship to study drug, amount 
of drug exposure, and time. Each patient will contribute only once (i.e., first occurrence) to 
each of the incidence rates, regardless of the number of occurrences. For reporting of adverse 
event severity in patient s with more than one occurrence of the same adverse event, the 
patient will only be reported once based on the highest severity of the adverse event 
observed. Patients who have a serious adverse event (SAE) or who discontinue the study due to an adverse event deemed to be related to study drug will be described in patient narratives.  
 
Vital signs, clinical laboratory, and ECG results will also be presented and summarized by dose level and summarized by descriptive statistics with change from Baseline values 
calculated.  All safety data collected in the clinical database, including physical exam findings and abnormal ECG results, will be presented in data listings.   
Efficacy Ana lyses: 
Efficacy analyses will be performed using the Efficacy (mITT) Population.  Efficacy 
endpoints will be summarized by descriptive statistics for each treatment group and by 
ulceration status. All descriptive summary statistics of continuous variables will include: n, 
mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. All descriptive summaries 
presenting frequencies and i ncidences will include n, % and N, where N is the total number 
of patients with recorded values in the corresponding group.  Graphical representations will 
be presented, if appropriate.  Efficacy data will also be presented in listings to assess changes within patients over time.    
Exploratory Analyses: 
Depending on the extent of the data, additional exploratory analyses may be performed to 
characterize relationships among variables, such as correlations among variables and 
trending, as well as further sub-group analyses, such as based on diabetic status and study completion status.  Additional sensitivity analyses may include comparisons between 
observed values and imputed values for missing data using different methods (e.g., multiple 
imputation, last observation carried forward ( LOCF).

CONFIDENTIAL   23 7. INTRODUCTION 
7.1. Background Information  
Necrobiosis lipoidica (NL) is a rare, idiopathic granulomatous disease involving collagen 
degradation.  It is a chronic, disfiguring skin condition that often develops on the pretibial region 
of the lower extremities but can also occur on other areas including the face, scalp,  forearm, and 
trunk.  NL usually presents initially as red papules that enlarge to form patches or plaques with 
an atrophic yellow center.  Although more commonly found in diabetic patients, non- diabetic 
patients can also develop NL and the progression of the disease is not correlated with glycemic control.  It is estimated that approximately 0.3% of the diabetic population has NL and that between 11 -65% of the NL patients are diabetic ( Muller, 1966; O'Toole, 1999).  NL also occurs 
predominantly in women (3:1 female- to-male ratio).  Ulceration occurs in approximately 30% of 
patients, which can lead to more severe complications, such as deep tiss ue infections that can 
threaten life of the limb  (Muller, 1966; Erfurt-Berge, 2015 ). Rare cases of squamous cell 
carcinoma in the NL region have also been reported.  
The earliest observed changes in NL involve small vessel vascular inflammation, progressing to 
larger vessel vasculitis, and collagen degeneration with septal fibrosis and fibrotic replacement 
of fat lobules ( Muller, 1966). Interstitial and palisaded granulomas involving the dermis and 
subcutaneous tissues are usually present. Granulomas are composed primarily of histiocytes 
(macrophages) with lymphocytes and plasma cells.  Palisaded histiocytes can be found near 
necrobiotic areas (especially in diabetics) with deposition of extracellular fat.  Although the 
pathophysiology of NL is still unclear, various potential mechanisms for development and progression of NL have been proposed.  Immune-complex deposition in blood vessels, abnormal 
collagen deposition/degradation and impaired neutrophil migration have all been suggested as 
possible causes of granuloma and necrobiotic collagen seen in the disease ( Ullman, 1977; 
Oikarinen, 1987; Markey, 1988; Gange, 1979).  Considering the strong association between NL 
and diabetics, diabetic microangiopathy (deposition of glycoprotein in blood vessels) has also been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis ( Reid, 2013) .   
7.2. Preclinical Data 
PCS499 is a methylxanthine derivative that is structurally identical to the pentoxifylline M1 
metabolite (PTX -M1), except that several key hydrogen atoms have been replaced with 
deuterium.  Pentoxifylline is th e active ingredient in Trental® which is approved in the US for 
the treatment of intermittent claudication on the basis of occlusive arterial disease of the limbs.  The extended release (ER) formulation of Trental was originally approved for use in Europe in 
1972 and US FDA approval for the treatment of intermittent claudication due to chronic occlusive arterial disease of the limbs was granted in 1984.  Metabolically, PTX and PTX -M1 
are known to interconvert in erythrocytes and liver by carbonyl reductase and CYP enzymes and are subsequently metabolized to hydroxy, carboxy and demethylated metabolites (PTX-M2, 
PTX-M3, PTX-M4, PTX-M6 and PTX M7) as well as the terminal metabolite, M5 by various 
CYP enzymes and possibly carboxylase ( Hinze, 1972; Lillibridge, 1996; Lee, 1997; Shin, 1998; 
Nicklasson, 2002; Peterson, 2004; Wyska, 2007).   
PCS499 has a complex mechanism of action including anti- inflammatory, immunomodulatory, 
hemorheological and antifibrotic effects that potentially could benefit NL patients.  PCS499 has 
Protocol PCS499- NL01  Date:  02 November 2018 
CONFIDENTIAL   24 slightly more potent anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive  activities than PTX in inhibiting 
proinflammatory cytokines (TNF -α and IFN-γ) and neutrophil activation that drive granuloma 
formation  and other inflammatory/autoimmune mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of NL.    
In addition, P TX and PTX-M1 have in vitro  hemorheological properties that increase red blood 
cell deformability and decrease platelet aggregation.  These data suggested that PCS499 
potentially could moderate hypoxia and platelet aggregation/coagulation associated with 
microangiopathy and antibody- mediated vasculitis in NL.  F urthermore, PCS499 and PTX have 
similar activities in inhibiting in vitro the secretion of TGF -β, the master regulator of fibrosis, 
which could potentially modulate the fibrosis and increased collagen crossing linking in basement membranes in NL lesions.  
Thus, PCS499 may benefit NL patients based on its slightly more potent inhibition of pro-inflammatory  cytokines/chemoattractants and neutrophil activation that induce inflammation and 
granuloma formation, as well as its promoting effect on red blood cell de formability and platelet 
deaggregation, which can improve microcirculatory flow and hypoxia in NL lesions, plus its inhibitory effect on TGF-β which reduce fibrosis and other collagen abnormalities.  
In terms of toxicology findings, there was no evidence of genetic toxicity in vitro or in vivo. 
PCS499 did not inhibit any of the major CYP450 isotypes in human liver microsomes; it 
exhibited low plasma protein binding and was permeable in CaCO-2 cells. The oral bioavailability of PCS499 was 37% in rats, and 62% and 25% in male and female dogs, 
respectively.   
PCS499 was well- tolerated in single - and repeat -dose toxicity studies at dose levels that are 
above the anticipated human dose levels. Overall, none of preclinical results preclude the administration of PCS 499 to humans and its development for the treatment of NL.   
Full details regarding the preclinical program for PCS499 are provided in the Investigational 
Brochure (IB ). 
7.3. Clinical Data Summary  
7.3.1. Previous P hase 1  and 2  Studies  
PCS499 was previously being developed for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Six  clinical 
trials with PCS499 have been completed including 4 studies in healthy volunteers and 2 studies in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
Four Phase 1 clinical trials in healthy adult volunteers have been completed evaluating tablet 
formulations, different dose regimens and administration of PCS499 with and without food. PCS499 tablets provide for a controlled release of the drug over an extended period of time after 
dosing. The maximum concentration (Cmax) 
 and area under the concentration vs time curve 
(AUC) of PCS499 increased approximately in proportion to dose across the range of tolerated 
doses.  Single daily doses up to 2400 mg have been administered to healthy subjects and were 
well tolerated up to 1800 mg. A daily dose of 1800 mg administered as 900 mg BID or 600 mg 
TID in a multiple dose healthy volunteer study was also well tolerated.  In healthy volunteers 
administered 900 mg BID or 600 mg TID, the most common adverse events were nausea and headache.      
Protocol PCS499- NL01  Date:  02 November 2018 
CONFIDENTIAL   25 Trials in patients with CKD include a single Phase 1 study and a Phase 2, 48-week double-blind 
into 48-week open -label clinical trial in CKD patients with Type 2 diabetes.   During the Phase 2 
double-blind study, treatment with PCS499 was generally well tolerated. Gastrointestinal (GI) 
events were reported more frequently in the PCS499 arm. Nausea was the most commonly 
reported event in the PCS499 arm, with 12 (13.5%) PCS499 vs 5 (5.7%) placebo patients 
reporting the event. Influenza was reported in 9 (10.1%) PCS499 and 1 (1.1%) placebo patients, and peripheral oedema reported in 9 (10.1%) PCS499 and 4 (4.5%) placebo patients. 
Hypertension was reported in a greater proportion of placebo patients, with 6 (6.7%) PCS499 
and 12 (13.6%) placebo patients experiencing the event. However, as only 6 patients required dose reduction, and only 4 patients were unable to tolerate PCS499 due to a GI event (and were 
forced to discontinue treatment), the 600 mg BID dosing regimen, following an initial 2  weeks of 
once daily  (QD) dosing, appeared to be satisfactorily tolerated in this patient population.  
Clinical safety data obtained to date in the 5 completed, Phase I clinical studies and the Phase 2 
study indicate that P CS499 is well tolerated. There have been no serious adverse events (SAEs) 
that were considered by the Investigators to be related to study treatment. Further information 
regarding previous clinical studies can be found in the Investigator Brochure.    
7.4. Dose  Rationale  
Previously, single oral doses of up to 1800 mg have been shown to be safe and well tolerated in a 
Phase 1 study with healthy volunteers.   
PCS499 has been previously administered to CKD patients.  Multiple doses of 600 mg QD for 2 
weeks followed  by 600 mg BID for an additional 2 weeks were administered to Stage 3 CKD 
patients. No significant AEs were observed in this  study. Also, in a Phase 2 study (CP.505.2001), 
PCS499 was administered at a dose of 600 mg BID for up to 2 years in diabetic nephropathy patients. From the studies conducted to date, although tolerable, higher daily doses may be 
needed to further maximize  the effects from PCS499.   
A recent study (PCS499.1005) was performed to identify a formulation with target product 
profile characteristics of a delayed time to maximum concentration ( Tmax), lower Cmax, and 
increased AUC.  The PK and safety profile of the selected form ulation was then assessed in a 
multiple dose study with a maximum daily dose of 1800 mg administered as 900 mg B ID or 600 
mg TID.  Both the 900 mg BID and 600 mg TID dosing regimens were well -tolerated in healthy 
volunteers, although the 900 mg dos e resulted in higher AUC and Cmax than the 600 mg dose.  
While the sample size was small with large variations among patients, an association may exist in certain subjects between the presence of AEs and a rapid drug absorption rate and higher 
maximum plasma concentrations .   
Therefore,  as the 900 mg BID dosing regimen of PCS499 results in a higher AUC and is 
generally well  tolerated, this regimen was selected for this study .  However, if a patient 
administered 900 mg BID has unacceptable toxicity, the dosing regimen will be changed to 600 
mg TID.   
7.5. Study Rationale  
No approved therapies exist for NL.  Current treatment approaches are based on empirical 
evidence, but generally produce unsatisfactory results.  These include corticosteroids (topical, 
Protocol PCS499- NL01  Date:  02 November 2018 
CONFIDENTIAL   26 intralesional, and systemic), topical calcineurin inhibitors, anti-pla telet agents, various 
immunosuppressants (chloroquine, thalidomide, TNF-α blockers, etc.), UV phototherapy, and 
skin grafting. For ulcerated lesions, wound care involving moisture control, infection control, conservative debridement, and compression therapy is employed. Spontaneous resolution has been reported in 13-19% of patients after 6- 12 years (Muller, 1966).  
Clinically, multiple case reports have been published suggesting benefit from the use of pentoxifylline (PTX) in NL patients, possibly related to its vascular and anti- inflammatory 
effects (Littler, 1987; Noz, 1993; Basaria, 2003; Wee, 2017). PCS499 is an analog of 
pentoxifylline that provides an exposure profile of active molecules more favorable to inhibiting 
the secretion of TNF -α, IFN-γ, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, PCS499 has 
been well tolerated in Phase 1 studies  at higher doses , which may be due to the flatter slope in 
achieving maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of active metabolites , which would be 
consistent with published reports that equate a higher rate of adverse events with a rapid drug 
absorption rate and higher maximum plasma concentrations for PTX ( Cleary, 1999 ).  Thus, 
PCS499 may benefit NL patients based on its enhanced inhibition of cytokines (TNF- α, IFN-γ) 
that induce inflammation and granuloma formation as well as its effect on red blood cell deformability and promotion of platelet deaggregation, which can improve microcirculatory 
flow.  Furthermore, higher doses of PCS499 can be administered with resulting higher exposures 
of active molecules with no observed increase in adverse effects.

Protocol PCS499- NL01  Date:  02 November 2018 
CONFIDENTIAL   28 9. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
9.1. Overall Study Design  and Plan: Description  
This is an open-label study that will evaluate the safety of PCS499 for the treatment of 
necrobiosis lipoidica (NL) and will inform the design of future studies.   
The study will consist of a 6 month treatment period followed by a 6 month extension period.   
Approximately 12 NL patients (6-9 patients without ulceration and 3- 6 patients with ulceration) 
who also meet other inclusion/exclusion cr iteria will be enrolled in the study.  Patients will be 
administered PCS499 900 mg BID.  Primary safety and exploratory efficacy analysis will be 
performed after the last patient completes the 6-month visit. Patients will have the option to 
continue dosing in an extension period for up to an additional 6 months.   
All patients will take PCS499 300 mg BID with food for 1 week.  Beginning at Week 2, patients 
will commence administration of twice daily dosing of three PCS499 300 mg tablets (900 mg 
BID) with food.  Patients will continue at their assigned dose for the remainder of the study.   
During the dosing period, if a patient receiving PCS499 900 mg BID experiences unacceptable toxicity (i.e., non- transient, moderate to severe limitation in activity) tha t is deemed by the 
Investigator to be related to study drug, his/her dose will be changed to PCS499 600 mg TID 
with food at the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor.  If this 
dose is not tolerated, the dose will be furthe r reduced to PCS499 600 mg BID with food at the 
discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor.   If 4 out of the first 6 patients dosed in this study require dose modification or discontinue from the study due to a 
drug-related ad verse event within 1 month of dosing, consideration will be made to change the 
starting dose to 600 mg TID with food for all subsequent patients.  Efficacy and safety data will 
be collected at regular intervals throughout the course of the study.   
An analysis will be conducted to assess safety and exploratory efficacy after the last patient 
completes the 6 -month visit.  A final analysis of patients enrolled in the study will be conducted 
after the last patient completes the 12 -month visit.  
9.2. Detailed Descri ption of Study Visit s

Protocol PCS499- NL01  Date: 02 November 2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   44 
 
 at any time for any reason without prejudice to their medical care.  The Investigator also has the 
right to withdraw patients from the study if it is in their best interest.  Patients  may be withdrawn 
from the study if they:  
• Have entered the study in violation of the protocol 
• Require use of a prohibited concomitant medication 
• Experience an AE that warrants premature withdrawal  
All treated patients should be followed according to the Schedule of Assessments.  All patients, 
even those who are withdrawn prematurely , should have all evaluations for the Month 12/ET 
Visit performed, if possible.  All procedures required should be documented in the electronic case report form ( eCRF).  For all patients who withdraw prematurely, the Investigator will 
indicate one of the following reasons for withdrawal on the e CRF: 
• Adverse event  (AE) 
• Death 
• Protocol violation  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Patient’s decision  
• Other (reason to be specified by the Investigator)  
In case of patient s’ withdrawal from the study due to an AE, such patient s will be closely 
monitored until the resolution or stabilization of the AE.  The Investigator should document the 
reason for withdrawal  in the source documentation and e CRF.  
If a patient withdraws participation from the trial early, early withdrawal should be documented 
by the Investigator (or designee) in the appropriate eCRF pages and source documents when confirmed.

 11. TREATMENT OF PATIENT S 
11.1. Description of Study Drug  
PCS499 is a stable, optically active, white -crystalline solid with the chemical name ( S)-1-
(4,4,6,6,6- pentadeutero -5-hydroxyhexyl) -3,7-dimethyl-1H -purine-2,6(3H ,7H)-dione.  Th e 
structural formula is provided in Figure  1 . 
Figure  1: Structural Formula for PCS499 
 
The molecular formula is C13H15D5N4O3.    
The dosage form is  a white tablet containing 3 00 mg of PCS499.  The inactive ingredients are 
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), silicon dioxide , and magnesium stearate.  
11.2. Concomitant Medications  
At the discretion of the Investigator, over -the-counter (OTC) medications will be allowed for the 
management of a self -limiting indication (e.g., acetaminophen for headache).  The use of 
concomitant OTC medications , including OTC herbals, must be approved by the Investigator 
before administration.  All prescription medications must be approved by the Investigator 
throughout the active treatment period.    
With the exception of PCS 499, investigational drugs are not to be taken during the study.   
IMPORTANT:  Patients should be instructed to consult with the Investigator before taking 
any new medication or changing medications and/or dosing regimens throughout the study.   
Drugs that are known to be strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 may increase exposure to the 
investigational product.  The Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor prior to (if 
possible) the initiation of a CYP1A2 inhibiting drug, such as ciprofloxacin, cimetidine, 
fluvoxamine, etc.           
  
Additional medication limitations are as follows: 
• Topical skin t reatments to the affected  NL area are not permitted during the study. 
• Systemic or topical immunosuppressive therapy, including but not limited to

Each patient’s study medication will be packaged in a study-specific box (kit) and shipped to the 
study site by  a central distribution site . 
12.3. Study Drug Storage  
All investigational drug supplies should be stored in a secure, locked area, under the 
responsibility of the Investigator or other authorized individual.  Study drug must be stored in the 
original packaging between 20 to 25°C (68 to 77°F), with deviations permitted between 15 to 
30°C (59 to 86°F), and protected from extreme conditions of temperature, light, and humidity.  
12.4. Study Drug Preparation  
There is no study drug preparation needed for this study. 
12.5. Administration  
All patients will take PCS499 300 mg BID with food for 1 week.  Beginning at Week 2, patients 
will commence administration of twice daily dosing of three PCS499 300 mg tablets (900 mg BID) with food.  Patients will continue at their assigned dose for the remainder of the study. 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout study and the following steps may be taken: 
• During the dosing period, if a patient receiving PCS499 900 mg BID experiences unacceptable toxicity (i.e., non- transient, moderate to severe limitation in activity) 
that is deemed by the Investigator to be related to study drug, his/her dose will be changed to PCS499 600 mg TID with food at the discretion of the Investigator in 
consultation with the Medical Monitor.  If this dose is not tolerated, the dose will be 
further reduced to PCS499 600 mg BID with food at the discretion of the Investigator 
in consultation with the Medical Monitor.  If 4 out of the first 6 patients dosed in this 
study require dose modification or discontinue from the study due to a drug- related 
adverse event within 1 month of dosing, consideration will be ma de to change the 
starting dose to 600 mg TID with food for all subsequent patients.  If clinically 
indicated at any time during the study, study medication will be discontinued.  
However, patients will not be discontinued from the study due to cessation of study 
drug. 
All changes in medication administration will also be noted in the eCRF.  
Each kit will be clearly marked with dosage instruction s.    
Each subject’s medication will be packaged for dispensing as described in the study manual.

 14. ASSESSMENT OF EXPLORATORY E FFICACY  
14.1. Exploratory Efficacy Variables  
14.1.1. Investigator Global Assessment: Necrobiosis Lipoidica ( IGA :NL)  
The Investigator Global Assessment : Necrobiosis Lipoidica ( IGA:NL) is a tool that has been 
adapted to assess the presence and severity of necrobiosis lesions.  Adap tation of the scale was 
based on input from 4 dermatologists with expertise  in granulomatous disorders, NL, and ulcers.  
The scale has face validity and has performed well in limited testing .  The scale scores activity 
based on features of inflammation/erythema , induration, and ulceration ( Table 3) and damage 
based on features of pigmentation, scarring, and atrophy ( Table 4).  Further validation of the 
scale is ongoing.  
Instructions:  Select (1) a numeric score that describes the activity and (2) a numeric score that 
describes the damage of the reference lesion*.  (*Reference lesion is the most severely affected 
lesion.) 
Table 3: IGA :NL Activity  
 
Score  Definition  Description  
0 Clear No inflammation, induration or ulceration , but residual damage may

2 Mild Mild inflammation (pink color)  and/or slight induration; no ulceration 
present. 
3 Moderate  Marked inflammation (dark pink, yellow- orange color)  and/or 
moderate induration; no ulceration present. 
4 Severe Intense inflammation (red or orange color) and/or severe induration and/or 1-2 shallow ulcerations present, but underlying structures (muscle, bone) NOT visible. 
5 Very Severe  Very intense inflammation (bright red/purple or deep orange color) and/or very severe induration and/or any deep ulceration present with underlying structures (muscle, bone) visible and/or more than 2 ulcerations.

14.1.2. Necrobiosis Lipoidica Color and Ulcer Scale (NLCUS)  
A tool called the Necrobiosis Lipoidica Color and Ulcer Scale (NLCUS) is also under 
development that separately assess es the color and ulcer of NL lesions.  This tool includes 
domains to separately assess the color/inflammation (Table 5) and induration ( Table 6) of NL 
lesions and the extent of ulceration , if present  (Table 7).  The  scale was  developed among 4 
dermatologists with expertise  in granulomatous disorders, NL, and ulcers, and has face validity 
and has performed well in limited pre- clinical testing .  Further validation of the scale is ongoing. 
Instructions:  Select (1) a numeric score that describes the color and (2) a numeric score that 
describes the ulceration status of the reference lesion*.  (*Reference lesion is the most severely 
affected lesion.)

14.1.3. Physician Global Assessment (PGA)  
The physician’s global assessment will be performed using a 10 c m VAS ranging from “ none” to 
“extreme activity ”, after the question “ Based on your assessment of the disease activity , draw a 
vertical mark (|) through the horizontal line for the level of disease activity  that is present today.”  
14.1.4. Lesion /ulcer surface area  
Surface area of the lesions(s)/ulcer  will be measured by the Investigator and by photography.  
Lesion surface area is defined as the surface area of the lesion with active 
inflammation/erythema.  The total lesion surface area (if more than one lesion is present), the 
reference lesion (defined as the lesion with the highest disease severity) surface area, reference ulcer surface area (defined as the ulcer with the highest disease severity  within the  reference 
lesion), and total ulcer surface area will be calculated .  The longest length and width (measured 
perpendicular to the longest length) measurements taken by the Investigator with a ruler will be entered into the eCRF  along with an assessment of the shape of the lesion (rectangular, circular, 
triangular, or elliptical) .   
Using the digital photograph/3D scan of the lesion, the Investigator will also electronically trace 
the perimeter of the reference lesion  and reference ulcer (if present).  Based on the tracing, t he 
surface area of the reference lesion and the surface area and volume of the reference ulcer  (if 
present) will be calculated.    
14.1.5. Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI) 
The Dermatology Quality of Life  Index (DLQI) is a self -administered , standard health- related 
quality of life (HRQL) instrument used in clinical trials related to skin diseases  (Both, 2007).  
The DLQI consists of 10 items and covers six domains including: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. Scores range from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating poorer HRQL.    
14.1.6. Skindex -29 
Skindex-29 is another self- administered  standard HRQL instrument that has been proposed to be 
comprehensive, but less used in clinical trials ( Chren, 2012).  It includes 29- items with 3 
domains, symp toms, emotions and functioning.  Each domain is scored from 0 to 100 with 
higher scores indicating lower quality of life.  The domains can be combined and scored separately .

 14.1.7. Patient Global Assessment (PtGA)  
The patient’s global assessment will be performe d using a 10 cm VAS ranging from “very 
severe” to “not at all”, after the question “Please indicate with a vertical mark (|) on the 
horizontal line, how does your skin condition affect you today?” 
14.1.8. Exploratory Efficacy Variables in Ulcerated Patients  
14.1.8.1. Closur e of reference ulcer  
Closure of reference ulcer is defined as skin re-epithelialization without drainage or dressing 
requirements confirmed at two consecutive study visits 2 weeks apart. 
14.1.8.2. Ulcer volume  
Ulcer volume will be assessed using via the use of a 3D- imaging system.   
14.2. Biomarkers  
Selected serum biomarkers related to the potential anti-inflammatory and/or immunosuppressive 
effects of PCS499 on NL will be measured.  These include TNF -α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, 
IL-17 and MCP-1.   
Additionally, an association between underlying autoimmunity and the development of NL has been suggested based on the higher than expected prevalence of the disease in patients with Type 
1 diabetes (as compared to Type 2 diabetes)  (Erfurt-Berge, 2015).  C- peptide levels will be 
measured to assess whether there is any benefit of PCS499 in maintaining natural insulin production.

 15. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
The safety parameters collected will include adverse events, vital signs, E CGs, physical 
examinations, and laboratory tests.  In addition, concomitant medications will be recorded .  
15.1. Safety Parameters  
15.1.1. Vital Signs , Height, Weight, and Body Mass Index  
Vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oral temperature, will be 
measured .  Height, wei ght and body mass index measurements will be collected at Screening  
only. Vital signs will be performed after the patient has been seated for at least 5 minutes.  
15.1.2. Physical Examination  
Full physical examinations  will be performed.  All abnormal findings will be documented in the 
eCRF. 
15.1.3. Electrocardiogram  
Standard resting 12- lead ECGs will be performed ; ECGs will be performed after the patient has 
rested for at least 5 minutes.  
15.1.4. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
Clinical Safety Laboratory assessments will include hematology, chemistry and urin alysis, 
coagulation, and HgbA1c.  
Screening panels will include v irus serology (HIV, and hepatitis B and C).  Results must be 
available prior to dosing. 
The list of clinical laborator y assessments is included i n Appendix A. 
15.1.4.1. Pregnancy Testing  
PCS499 should not be administered to pregnant women.  Effective methods of birth control must 
be used by WOCBP. 
A serum β- HCG will be performed at Visit 1 (Screening).  All WOCBP will have local urine 
pregnancy tests as indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Table 2).  A positive urine pregnancy test 
requires immediate interruption of study treatment until a serum β-HCG is performed and found 
to be negative.  If positive, the subject must be discontinued from the study. 
15.1.5. Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications are defined as any medication taken by the patient during the course of 
the study following the first dose.  Prior medications are defined as any medication taken by the 
patient within 30 days of their first dose of study medication .  Prior and concomitant medications 
will be coded using the WHO Drug Dictionary.

CONFIDENTIAL   55 
 
 15.2. Adverse Event s and Reporting Procedures  
15.2.1. Adverse Event Definition and Collection  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical 
product whether or not considered drug- related.  Adverse events may include safety findings 
considered to be clinically significant by the Investigator, Sponsor, or Medical Monitor.  An 
adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not it is related to the medicinal product.  Reporting an adverse event does not necessarily reflect a conclusion by the Investigator, Sponsor or Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) that the event is causally related to the  drug. 
All adverse events should be captured and must be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Adverse events should be spontaneously reported or elicited by non-suggestive probing.  All 
adverse event reports should contain the date the adverse event occurred, a brief description of 
the event (if the event consists of a cluster of signs and symptoms, record a diagnosis rather than each sign and symptom), onset date, the severity, the Investigator’s assessment of the 
relationship to study drug, the study drug action taken, the outcome, date resolved, and whether 
or not the event was serious (and if so, why). 
New information regarding signs and symptoms that occurred during the Screening phase and 
prior to the day of the first study medication dose on Day 1 of study that are related to screening 
procedures should be recorded on the Adverse Event log.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries 
should be regarded as AEs.  Abnormal results of laboratory tests or diagnostic procedures are considered to be AEs if the abnorm ality: 
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• Is considered by the Investigator to be of clinical significance  
• Results in study withdrawal 
• Fulfills any of the criteria for an SAE, as described in this section  
• Requires intervention or further evaluat ion to determine the etiology of the 
abnormality and/or assess the risk to the patient 
• Requires treatment  
15.2.2. Categorizing Adverse Events in Relation to Study Phase 
The relationship of each adverse event must be recorded on the Adverse Event e CRF as one of 
the choices provided on the scale that follows, where the temporal sequence is defined as an association between administration of a drug and the observed reaction or event such that the drug was present prior to the reaction or event: 
The Investigator assess es the relationship between the AE and the study drug by using the 
following definitions: 
Protocol PCS499- NL01  Date: 02 November 2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   56 
 
 • DEFINITELY RELATED – Onset of the event as relative to administration of the 
study drug is reasonable and there is no other cause to explain the event; or a re-
challenge (if feasible) is positive.  
• PROBABLY RELATED – Onset of the event as relative to administration of the 
study drug is reasonable and is more likely explained by the drug than by any other cause.    
• POSSIBLY RELATED – Onset of the event as relative to adm inistration of the study 
drug is reasonable; however, the event could have been due to another, equally likely, cause. 
• UNLIKELY TO BE RELATED – Onset of the event as relative to administration of 
the study drug, is possible but another cause itself can explain the occurrence of the event or there are no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the product could have caused the event. 
• NOT RELATED – Onset of the event as relative to administration of the study drug, 
is not reasonable; or, another cause itself can explain the occurrence of the event.  
All AEs (regardless of seriousness or relationship to study drug) including those from the time of signing of the Informed Consent Form ( ICF) through to the follow- up/early withdrawal visit are 
to be recorded in the patient’s source documents and on the corresponding page(s) in the e CRF.  
Whenever possible, symptoms, signs, and laboratory abnormalities should be grouped as a single syndrome or diagnosis.  The Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with respect to study drug, corrective treatment/therapy given, outcome and his/her opinion as to 
whether there is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the study drug .  All 
medications administered to treat an AE must be recorded in the patient’s source documentation 
and documented in the e CRF. 
15.2.3. Assigning Severity to Adverse Events  
The severity of each adverse event must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF as one of the choices provided on the scale below: 
• MILD: Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated. 
• MODERATE: Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity.  
• SEVERE: Incapa citating with inability to work or do usual activity.  
15.2.4. Serious Adverse Event  Definition and Collection  
An adverse event is considered a serious adverse event (SAE) if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it includes any untoward medical occur rence at any dose that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
Protocol PCS499- NL01  Date: 02 November 2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   57 
 
 • Results in a significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage or 
disruption in the patient's body fun ction/structure, physical activities and/or quality of 
life. 
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is a medically important event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. 
The term “life threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the patient in the view of either the I nvestigator or Sponsor, was at risk of immediate death at the time of the 
event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.  Death is an outcome of an event.  The event that resulted in death should be recorded 
and reported on the SAE form and documented in the e CRF. 
Reporting serious adverse events to the Medical Monitor requires additional detailed reports and 
follow-up, depending upon the Investigator's (or in some cases the Sponsor's) estimate of a 
causal relationship between the test agent and the adverse event(s), and whether the adverse event(s) is identified in  nature, severity, and frequency in the Investigator's Brochure or other 
risk information supplied to the Investigator. 
In the event of a serious adverse event, the Investigator must notify the Medical Monitor 
immediately (within 24 hours).  The SAE hotline telephone and SAE fax line numbers will be 
provided to each site and will be present also on the Serious Adverse Event Worksheet.  Details 
of the serious adverse event must be documented on the Serious Adverse Event Worksheet by the site and faxed to the SAE fax line.  The initial report should be as complete as possible. 
Information not available at the time of the initial report ( e.g., an end date for the adverse event 
or discharge summary/testing/laboratory values received after the first report), must be 
documented on a follow-up Serious Adverse Event Worksheet.  Sites must make an effort to obtain all hospital medical records including discharge summary confirming final diagnosis.  
All serious adverse events (SAEs) should be submitted to the Instituti onal Review Board (IRB) 
as per the requirements of the IRB.  The death of a patient must be immediately (within 24 hours 
of site awareness) reported to the IRB.  All serious and non-serious adverse events should be 
thoroughly documented on the Adverse Event eCRF and followed out by the Investigator until the event resolves or until the termination visit.  The event may be followed longer, if deemed 
necessary.  Sites must ensure that the final SAE Worksheet captures the same information as the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  For any death occurring during the trial, the medical condition that led to 
the death on the Adverse Event eCRF and also reported on the SAE Worksheet.  The “outcome” 
status should be noted as “death” in these cases of SAEs that resulted in death.  In addition, all 
SAEs that occur within 30 days after the last dose of study drug should be recorded and reported as noted previously.

Per-Protocol Population:  Defined as a subset of the Efficacy Population who did not have a 
major protocol violation as defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
Biomarker Population:  Defined as all patients enrolled in the study who received at least 1 dose of treatment, participated in biomarker evaluations, and have appropriate samples available for analysis.    
17.4. Patient Characteristic s 
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics will be presented by descriptive statistics. All descriptive summary statistics of continuous variables will include: n, mean, median, standard 
deviation, minimum and maximum.  All descriptive summaries presenting frequencies and 
incidences will include n, % and N, where N is the total number of patients with recorded values 
in the corresponding group.  Patient completion status and exposure outcomes will be similarly presented.    
17.5. Safety  Analysis 
 
The safety analyses will be performed using the Safety Population and include adverse events, changes in physical exam findings, vital signs, clinical laboratory  values, and ECG results.
 
17.5.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA version 21.0 or higher).  The number and percent of patients reporting at 
least one adverse event will be summarized by System Organ Class (S OC) and Preferred Term 
(PT) and presented by dose level, severity, relationship to study drug, amount of drug exposure,

 and time. Each patient will contribute only once (i.e., first occurrence) to each of the incidence 
rates, regardless of the number of oc currences. For reporting of adverse event severity in patient s 
with more than one occurrence of the same adverse event, the patient  will only be reported once 
based on the highest severity of the adverse event observed. Patients who have a serious adverse event (SAE) or who discontinue the study due to an adverse event deemed to be related to study 
drug will be described in patient narratives.    
17.5.2. Other Safety Analyses  
Vital signs, clinical laboratory, and ECG results will also be presented and summarized by  dose 
level and summarized by descriptive statistics with change from Baseline values calculated.  All 
safety data collected in the clinical database, including physical exam findings and abnormal ECG results, will be presented in data listings.  
17.6. Efficacy A nalysi s 
Efficacy analyses will be performed using the Efficacy (mITT) Population.  Efficacy endpoints will be summarized by descriptive statistics for each treatment group and by ulceration status. All descriptive summary statistics of continuous variables  will include: n, me an, median, 
standard deviation, minimum and maximum. All descriptive summaries presenting frequencies 
and incidences will include n, % and N, where N is the total number of patients with recorded values in the corresponding group.  Graphical representations will be presented, if appropriate.  Efficacy data will also be presented in listings to assess changes within patients over time.    
17.7. Biomarkers  
Analyses will be performed using the Biomarker Population.  Biomarkers will be evaluated to assess changes within patients over time.  Additional exploratory analyses may be performed depending on the extent of the data using appropriate statistical methods. 
17.8. Exploratory Associations among Outcomes 
Depending on the extent of the data, addit ional exploratory analyses may be performed to 
characterize relationships among variables, such as correlations among variables and trending, as well as further sub -group analyses, such as based on diabetic status and study completion status.  
Additional sensitivity analyses may include comparisons between observed values and imputed values for missing data using different methods (e.g., multiple imputation, LOCF).

 21. ETHICS 
The procedures set out in this study protocol, pertaining to the conduct, evaluation, and 
documentation of this study, are designed to ensure that the sponsor and the Investigator abide by 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP), including but not limited to Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 50, 56, and 312 and the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
guidelines and directives.  Compliance with these regulations also constitutes compliance with 
the ethical principles described in the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki, Tokyo 2004, Korea 2008 and applicable local regulatory requirements and law.  
Copies of these materials are available from Processa Pharmaceuticals and the CRO designee by 
request.  The purpose of these regulations, legal obligations, and guidances is to define the standards and principles for the proper conduct of clinical trials that have been developed by the 
medical, scientific, and regulatory communities.  They are not intended to impede or restrict 
clinical research.  
The ethical standards defined within GCP are intended to ensure that: 
1. Human subjects are provided with an adequate understanding of the possible risks of their participation in the study, and that they have a free choice to participate or not. 
2. The study is conducted with diligence and in conformance with the protocol in such a way as to protect subject safety and ensure the integrity of the findings. 
3. The potential benefits of the research justify the risks. 
The Investigator is responsible for protecting the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects under his/her care, and for the control of the medications under investigation. 
The Principal Investigator will ensure that all persons assisting with the study are adequately 
informed about the protocol, any amendments to the protocol, the study drug, and their study-
related duties and functions.  The Investigator will maintain a list of sub-Investigators and other 
appropriately qualified persons to whom he or she has delegated significant study- related duties.  
Individuals ineligible to conduct or work on clinical studies, including those ineligible as a result 
of debarment under the Generic Drug Enforcement Act of 1992, will not be allowed to conduct 
or work on studies sponsored by Processa Pharmaceuticals.  The Investigat or is required to 
immediately disclose to Processa Pharmaceuticals in writing, if any person involved in the 
conduct of the study is debarred pursuant to a hearing by US FDA under this anti- fraud law, or if 
any proceeding for debarment is pending, or is (to the best of the Investigator’s knowledge) threatened.  
The rest of this section of the protocol describes in more detail the specific GCP-defined responsibilities the Investigator assumes by agreeing to participate in this study.  
21.1. Ethics Review  
The Invest igator (or designee) must submit this study protocol, the Processa Pharmaceuticals 
approved informed consent form ( ICF), patient information sheets (PISs), subject recruitment 
materials, and other appropriate documents to the appropriate IRB or IEC, and following review of the submitted materials is required to forward to Processa Pharmaceuticals (or designee) a 
Protocol PCS499- NL01  Date: 02 November 2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   67 
 
 copy of the written and dated approval/favorable opinion signed by the IRB Chairman, along 
with a list of the IRB/IEC composition.  
The approval/fav orable opinion should clearly state the trial (study number, protocol title, and 
version number), the documents reviewed (Protocol, ICF, IB, etc.) and the date of the review.  
The study will not commence at the study site until Processa Pharmaceuticals has  received a 
copy of this written and dated approval/favorable opinion. 
During the trial, any amendment to the protocol and the ICF (as appropriate) should be submitted 
to the IRB/IEC.  The IRB/IEC should also be informed of any event likely to affect the s afety of 
subjects or the continued conduct of the trial, in particular any change in safety.  Additionally, all 
updates to the IB will be sent to the IRB/IEC.  A progress report will be sent to the IRB/IEC and 
the protocol will be reviewed annual ly or more frequently, as required by IRB/IEC or local 
regulations. 
The Investigator will notify the IRB/IEC of the conclusion of the clinical study within 1 month 
of completion or termination of the study.  The final report sent to the IRB/IEC will also be sent 
to Processa Pharmaceuticals, along with the completed eCRFs and all necessary regulatory 
documents, thereby fulfilling the Investigator’s regulatory responsibility. 
The Investigator will maintain a copy of all correspondence with the IRB/IEC, including copies 
of approved documents.  The Investigator will also maintain a copy of the IRB/IEC membership list, including members’ occupation and qualifications (or a statement confirming compliance 
with GCP requirements for committee composition).  An IRB or IEC Gene ral Assurance 
Number may be accepted in lieu of a membership roster.  
21.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
This study will be conducted in accordance with GCP as delineated by Title 21 CFR Parts 50, 56, and 312, and the ICH guidelines and directives.  Participating Investigators, including 
members of the Committees and National Coordinators, will receive compensation for their time but will receive no financial profit from their activities related to the trial.  
Before the first subject is enrolled in the study, all ethical, regulatory, and legal requirements must be met.  
An Investigator participating in this study is required to maintain complete and accurate study 
documentation in compliance with current GCP standards and all applicable local regulations 
related to the conduct of a clinical study.  
21.3. Written Informed Consent  
Prior to performing any study -related activities under this protocol, including screening tests and 
assessments, written informed consent with the approved ICF must be obtained from the subject 
or subject’s legally authorized representative, as applicable,  in accordance with local practice and 
regulations.  Written informed consent must be obtained from all subjects participating in a 
clinical study conducted by Processa Pharmaceuticals.  
The background of the proposed study, the procedures, the benefits and risks of the study, and that study participation is voluntary for the subject must be explained to the subject.  The subject must be given sufficient time to consider whether to participate in the study.  
Protocol PCS499- NL01  Date: 02 November 2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   68 
 
 A copy of the ICF, signed and dated by the subject, must be given to the subject.  Confirmation 
of a subject’s informed consent must also be documented in the subject’s source documentation 
prior to any testing under this protocol, including screening tests and assessments.  
Each consent form should contain an authorization allowing the Principal Investigator(s) and 
Processa Pharmaceuticals to use and disclose patient health information (PHI) in compliance 
with local law.  
The original signed consent form will be retained with the study records.

 22. DATA HANDLING AND RECORDKEEPING 
22.1. Data Collection  
Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) will be provided to the study site by Processa or its 
designee.  All protocol-required information collected during the study must be recorded by the 
Investigator or designated representative in the source documentation for the study.  The source 
documentation will then be used to enter the protocol required information onto the eCRF.  The Investigator may authorize other persons to make entries in the eCRF, provided that the names, 
positions, signatures and initials of these persons are supplied in a delegation of authority log 
actively maintained at the site and reviewed by the Study Monitor.  The Investigator or 
designated representative should enter source document data for enrolled patients into the eCRF 
as soon as possible once the information has been collected.  All changes to data will be 
collected electronically through a computerized system for electronic data capture.  Changes or 
corrections to electronic case report forms will be documented by use of audit trails and include 
identification of the person making a change or correction, and wil l be time/date stamped.  The 
eCRF for each patient will be checked against source documents by the Study Monitor.  eCRFs 
will be stored on an appropriate storage media at the Investigator's site and the data management 
center. 
Prior to the start of the study, the Principal Investigator will complete a Delegation of Authority form (Site Signature and Delegation Log), showing the signatures and handwritten initials of all 
individuals and the delegation of responsibilities, such as identifying those individual s who are 
authorized to make or change entries on e CRFs. 
22.2. Case Report Form Completion  
Data within the eCRF will be monitored by the Clinical Research Associate according to a 
Clinical Monitoring Plan.  Queries will be generated based on discrepancies found while 
monitoring.  Site personnel will review and respond to these queries appropriately.  Additionally, CRO and Processa Pharmaceuticals may periodically perform aggregate data reviews, which 
could result in queries being generated for site personnel resolution.  The final, completed e CRF 
for each subject must be electronically signed and dated by the Principal Investigator to signify 
that the Principal Investigator has reviewed the eCRF and certifies it to be complete and 
accurate. 
22.3. Database Management, Da ta Clarification, and Quality Assurance  
A designated CRO will be responsible for data management.  Data Management will develop a 
Data Management Plan document and provide it to Processa Pharmaceuticals for approval.  The DMP document will define all activ ities in the data collection and cleaning process.  The detailed 
DMP will be based on the protocol, work scope, contract, analysis plans, data-flows, e CRFs, data 
cleaning procedures, other supporting documents, and data management standards and practices. 
Programmed data validation edit checks will be run to check for database completeness and 
consistency, and queries will be generated upon data entry or via review by a Clinical Data 
Manager after entry.  The sites will respond to the data queries in a time ly manner.  
Protocol PCS499- NL01  Date: 02 November 2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   70 
 
 Concurrent medications entered into the database will be coded using a WHO Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical dictionary.  Coexistent diseases and AEs will be coded using MedDRA.  
Quality control procedures will be conducted prior to database lock according to the designated CRO SOPs.  
When the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked.  Any changes to the database after that time will only be made by joint written agreement between Processa Pharmaceuticals, the Trial S tatistician, the Data Manager, and the Quality Assurance 
Auditor according to designated CRO SOPs. 
22.4. Inspection of Records/Source Documents  
According to the ICH guidelines for GCP, the sponsor or designee must verify data entered in the eCRF entries against the source documents, except for the pre- identified source data directly 
documented in the e CRF (if applicable).  The ICF will include a statement by which the subject 
allows the sponsor’s duly authorized personnel, the IRB/IEC, and the regulatory authorit ies to 
have direct access to source data that supports the data in the eCRF (e.g., subject’s medical file, 
appointment books, and original laboratory records).  These personnel, bound by professional secrecy, must keep confidential all personal medical inf ormation. 
The objective of source document verification (SDV) is to comply with GCP and international 
regulatory requirements and to reduce the risks of fraud.  Source document verification means 
ensuring that the source documents are an accurate and verifiable reflection of the subject’s participation in the study and that all relevant information that is recorded in the source document is accurately entered into the eCRF. 
Where source documents serve as the basis for deriving data for the trial, SDV should ensure that these documents are correctly labeled and filed and that the data derived from them are correct.  
All source documents pertaining to this study will be maintained by the Investigator and made available for inspection by authorized persons.  If electronic progress notes and other electronic 
source documents are not Title 21 CFR Part 11 compliant, they are not considered a valid source 
for this study.  All progress notes must be dated and signed by the Investigator or 
sub-Investigator at the time  of the visit.  Processa  Pharmaceuticals reserves the right to terminate 
the study for refusal of the Investigator to supply original source documentation for this clinical study. 
The Investigator will note in a source independent from the e CRF the following information: 
1. Information to confirm that the subject exists ( e.g., initials, date of birth, sex) 
2. Confirmation that the subject satisfies the inclusion/exclusion criteria  
3. Confirmation that the subject is taking part in the clinical trial 
4. Confirmation of the informed consent process 
5. Visit dates and documentation of protocol assessments and procedures 
6. Information concerning all AEs 
7. Details of concomitant and investigational medications  
Protocol PCS499- NL01  Date: 02 November 2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   71 
 
 Source document verification is not a substitute for clinical trial monitoring, the purpose of 
which is to ensure that the protocol has been followed correctly, the eCRF has been fully and 
accurately completed, SDV has been carried out, and the study timelines and enrollment goals and requirements have been met.  
22.5. Retention of Records  
The Investigator must maintain all study documentation as confidential, and take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents. 
The Investigator must retain the study documents at least 2 years after the approval of a 
marketing application/new drug application for the indication investigated or at least 2 years 
have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational 
product (e.g., the Investigational New Drug application is withdrawn).  These documents should 
be retained for a longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with Processa Pharmaceuticals.  
The Investigator must notify Processa  Pharmaceuticals prior to destroying any study essential 
documents. 
If the Investigator can no longer ensure archiving, he/she shall inform Processa  Pharmaceuticals.  
The relevant records shall be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee.   
Protocol PCS499- NL01  Date: 02 November 2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   72 
 
 23. CONFIDENTIALITY, AMENDMENTS, AND PUBLICATIONS 
All informa tion disclosed or provided by Processa  Pharmaceuticals (or designee) or produced 
during the trial including, but not limited to, the protocol, the eCRFs, the IB, and the results 
obtained during the course of the trial (if applicable), are confidential.  The Investigator or any person under his/her authority agrees to undertake to keep confidential and not to disclose the information to any third party without the prior written approval of Processa Pharmaceuticals.  
However, submission of this protocol and any other necessary documentation to the IRB/IEC is expressly permitted, the IRB/IEC members having the same obligation of confidentiality. 
All information generated in this study must be considered highly confidential and must not be 
disclosed to any persons not directly concerned with the study without written prior permission from Processa Pharmaceuticals.  However, authorized regulatory officials and sponsor personnel 
(or designee) will be allowed full access to inspect and copy the records.  The copied and inspected records will remain at the site and will not be transmitted or removed from the site.  All study drug, subject bodily fluids, and/or other materials collected shall be used solely in 
accordance with this protocol, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Processa Pharmaceuticals 
and responsible ethics committee(s) or regulatory authorities.  
Photographs from this study may be used for the further development of clinical tools to evaluate the disease activity in patients with Necrobiosis Lipoidica (e.g. the IGA:NL scale and the 
NLCUS).  If photographs are used, they will only include unidentifiable images, meaning that 
the patient will not be able to be identified from these photographs. 
Subjects will be identified only by unique subject numbers in eCRFs.  Their full names may, 
however, be made known to a regulatory agency or other authorized officials in the event of inspections.  Documents containing the full name or other personally identifiable information of 
the subject are to remain at the site.  This information will not be transferred to Processa 
Pharmaceuticals nor be contained in regulatory filings.  In the event of inspections by authorized 
agencies, this subject identification may be disclosed.  
23.1. Subject Data Protection  
Prior to an y testing under this protocol, including screening tests and assessments, candidates 
must also provide all authorizations required by local law ( e.g., PHI authorization in North 
America).  
The subject will not be identified by name in the eCRF or in any study reports and these reports 
will be used for research purposes only.  Processa Pharmaceuticals, its partner(s) and 
designee(s), and various government health agencies may inspect the records of this study.  Every effort will be made to keep the subject’s  personal medical data confidential.  
Processa Pharmaceuticals will protect individual subject information to the fullest extent possible during this trial.  At no time will a subject become identified in any publication or presentation.  However, the subject may have to become identified in the event of a regulatory authority audit 
or inspection in order to verify the accuracy of the data.  Access to subject information is at the 
discretion of Processa Pharmaceuticals and cannot occur prior to database lock or other specified events as determined solely by the discretion of Processa Pharmaceuticals.  
Protocol PCS499- NL01  Date: 02 November 2018 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   73 
 
 23.2. Study Protocol Amendments  
The Investigator will not make any changes to this protocol without prior written consent from 
Processa Pharmaceuticals and subsequent approval by the IRB/IEC.  Any permanent change to 
the protocol, whether it is an overall change or a change for specific study center(s), must be handled as a protocol amendment.  Any amendment to the protocol that appears necessary as the 
study progresse s will be fully discussed by the Investigator(s) and Processa Pharmaceuticals.  If 
agreement is reached regarding the need for an amendment, it will be written by Processa 
Pharmaceuticals.  The written amendment must be submitted to the chairman of the IRB /IEC 
identified with this responsibility.  Except for administrative amendments, Investigators must await IRB/IEC approval of protocol amendments before implementing the change(s).  Administrative amendments are defined as having no effect on the safety of the research 
subjects, scope of the investigation, or quality of the trial.  However, a protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to subjects should be implemented immediately, and the IRB/IEC notified within 5 days.  Processa  Pharmaceuticals will ensure submission of any 
protocol amendments to the appropriate regulatory agencies. 
When, in the judgment of the chairman of the local IRB/IEC, the Investigators, and/or Processa 
Pharmaceuticals, the amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design and/or 
increases the potential risk to the subject, the currently approved written ICF will require similar 
modification.  In such cases, the Investigator will obtain repeat informed consent from subjects enrolled in the study before expecting continued participation. 
23.3. Publication  
All information concerning the product as well as any information such as clinical indications for 
the study drugs, their formula, their formulation, methods of manufacture and other scientific 
data relating to it, that have been provided by Processa  Pharmaceuticals or designee, and are 
unpublished, are confidential and must remain the sole property of Processa Pharmaceuticals.  
The Investigator will agree to use the information only for the purposes of carrying out this study 
and for no other purpose unless prior written permission from Processa Pharmaceuticals is obtained.  Processa Pharmaceuticals has full ownership of the e CRFs completed as part  of the 
study. 
By signing the study protocol, the Investigator agrees that the results of the study may be used for the purposes of national and international registration, publication, and information for 
medical and pharmaceutical professionals by Proces sa Pharmaceuticals.  If necessary, the 
authorities will be notified of the Investigator’s name, address, qualifications, and extent of 
involvement. 
Processa Pharmaceuticals or designee will prepare a final report on the study.  The Investigator 
may not publish or present any information on this study without first presenting the information to Processa Pharmaceuticals for review.

Amendment 1: February 26, 2009 31.0   Introduction 
  
       Spine metastases are a common pattern of spr ead for many different malignancies, especially prostate 
cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, renal cancer, mela noma, and colorectal cancer.  Treatment of 
symptomatic spine metastases typically consists of  radiation therapy, sometimes following surgical 
decompression of the spine.  Radiation therapy has b een used to improve tumor control, alleviate tumor-
related pain, prevent pathologic fractures, and improve neurologic symptoms such as weakness, numbness, and paresthesias.  The traditional radiation therapy course consists of daily treatment, Monday 
through Friday, for a period of approximately 2-5 weeks.  A prolonged course of radiation therapy can 
affect quality of life, particularly if life expectancy is  limited.  In addition, patients with spinal metastases 
often have other sites of disease, and a more rapid ra diation course may allow more timely administration 
of systemic chemotherapy to address these other disease sites.  Recent technolog ical advancements allow 
high-dose precisely targeted radiation treatments to be delivered in only 1-5 sessions.  A more rapid 
radiation course may positively affect quality of life.  This radiation procedure is called stereotactic body 
radiotherapy (SBRT).  Traditional radiation therapy us ually includes at least 1-2 vertebral levels proximal 
and distal to the affected spine.  SBRT limits the amount of normal tissue irradiated, and this sparing of bone marrow may facilitate continued delivery of intens ive systemic chemotherapy with less delays for 
management of myelosuppression.  Radiosurgery may also result in better long-term local control than 
standard radiation therapy thus ob viating the ultimate need for extens ive spine surgery for decompression 
and fixation, and may provide potentially more rapid on set of clinical response such as pain improvement 
or amelioration of ne urologic deficits. 
        Treatment of recurrent spine metastases is often challenging.  With the advent of more effective 
chemotherapy and targeted therapy agents, many patient s with metastatic cancer are surviving longer than 
has traditionally been seen in the past.  Although pa tients often have significant improvement in pain 
and/or neurologic symptoms with traditional radiatio n therapy, as survival rates have improved patients 
are at risk of developing recurrent symptomatic disea se.  Traditional radiation therapy cannot be repeated 
at the same site in the spine, due to  the increased risk of in jury to normal tissue.  Spinal surgery is often 
difficult and can be associated with significant risk, or  may not be an option due to prior surgery, other 
medical conditions or limited life expectancy.  Stereot actic body radiotherapy offers an alternative to 
surgery for management of recurrent disease, which can be  delivered in an outpatient setting with low risk 
of side effects.          Treatment of primary spine tumors may consist of surgery, radiation therapy, or a combination of 
surgery followed by radiation therapy.  As with spin e metastases, radiation therapy has been used to 
achieve tumor control, alleviate tumor-related pain, and improve neurologic symptoms such as weakness, 
numbness, and paresthesias.  The traditional radiation therapy course consists of daily treatment, Monday 
through Friday, for a period of approximately 3-6 w eeks.  This prolonged course of radiation can affect 
quality of life.  Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT ) allows the delivery of highly precise radiation in 
only 1-5 treatments.  Surgical management of patient s with primary spine tumors can be associated with 
significant risk of morbidity.  Some patients are not surgical candidates due to other serious medical 
conditions.  The advantage of SBRT over surgery is th at it is not painful, and does not require anesthesia 
or hospitalization.  In addition, some of these benign tumors, such as meningiomas and schwannomas, 
also occur in the brain where radiosurgery has been  proven to produce local control rates similar to 
surgical resection.    
       Traditional fractionated radiation therapy for spine metastases has been studied extensively.  A meta-
analysis of 16 randomized trials comparing various schedules of fractionated radiation therapy over 1-2 
weeks to single fraction radiotherapy demonstrated un satisfactory complete pain relief rates of less than 
30%.  Most studies analyzed used a single fraction of 8 Gy.  There was no difference between single fraction and multi-fraction radiotherapy in overall res ponse rate or complete response rate; however, the 
 
Amendment 1: February 26, 2009 4re-treatment rate was 2.5 fold higher for single fr action radiation therapy (1).  The dose that can be 
delivered safely in a single fraction of radiation to the sp ine is limited by the tolera nce of the spinal cord.  
Standard radiation therapy commonly includes a relatively  long length of spinal cord, and delivers the full 
prescription dose to the cord.       Recent technological advances have made it po ssible to deliver high doses of radiation therapy with 
high precision over just a few days, while preserving function of surrounding critical structures.  This treatment modality, termed stereotactic body radiothe rapy (SBRT), is emerging as an expedient, safe, and 
effective radiation modality for a variety of malignanc ies.  SBRT was recently defined by the American 
Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (A STRO) as a “treatment method to deliver a high dose 
of radiation to the target, utilizing either a single do se or a small number of fractions with a high degree of 
precision within the body” (2).  Stereotactic radios urgery is a well-established treatment for intracranial 
metastases with local control rates of 80-90%.  Several institutions have investigated the use of SBRT for 
the treatment of spine metastases and primary spin e tumors, and have reported excellent local tumor 
control, onset of pain relief and ne urologic improvement at least as rapid as traditional radiation therapy, 
with fairly low toxicity risk.  Many phase I and II tr ials of SBRT have now b een published demonstrating 
its efficacy and safety.  Although follow-up is variab le, the local control rates for metastatic disease have 
generally been in the range of 81-95%, at least pa rtial pain relief of 67-10 0%, and rates of late 
myelopathy of 0-4%.  No grade 3-5 late toxicity has be en reported with respect to other organs such as the 
kidneys, lungs, bowel, and esophagus (3).         Gerszten and colleagues from the University  of Pittsburgh published a series of 393 patients with 500 
spine metastases treated with Cyberknife stereotac tic radiosurgery to a maximum dose of 12.5-25 Gy 
(mean 20 Gy, or 16 Gy to the 80% isodose line) in a single fraction.  344 tumor sites had received prior 
fractionated radiation therapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions or  35 Gy in 14 fractions).  With a median follow-up 
of 21 months, 86% had significant long-term pain im provement and 88% had long-term tumor control.  
The rate of neurologic deficit improvement was 84%.   No tumor progression at immediately adjacent spine levels was seen.  There were no cases of  treatment-related myelopathy (4).   
 
       Some tumor histologies, such as renal ce ll carcinomas and malignant melanoma, are known to be 
relatively radioresistant, and thus standard RT may provide less than optimal clinical response.  The 
University of Pittsburgh experience treating spin e metastases from renal cell cancer and malignant 
melanoma was reported by Gerszten in 2005.  Fort y-eight patients with 60 renal cell metastases were 
treated to 14-20 Gy (mean 16 Gy) prescribed to the 80% isodose line (maximum dose 17.5-25 Gy) in a single fraction.  Most patients had previously been  treated with fractionated external-beam radiation 
therapy.  With a median follow-up of 37 months, 89% of patients had durable pain improvement and 
there were no cases of radiation myelopathy or radicu lopathy (5).  Thirty-six melanoma spine metastases 
in 28 patients were treated with single fraction S BRT using the same dose regimen.  With a median 
follow-up of 13 months, 96% of patients had long-te rm pain improvement and there were no cases of 
neural toxicity (6). 
 
       Chang and colleagues published MD Anders on Cancer Center’s phase I/II experience using SBRT 
for spine metastases.  Seventy-four tumors in 63 patient s were treated to 30 Gy in 5 fractions or 27 Gy in 
3 fractions delivered every 2 days, with typically 80-90% of the target volume receiving at least the 
prescription dose.  Thirty-five patients had previously received in-field radiation therapy, with the cord 
dose limited to < 45 Gy.  No chemotherapy was given within 30 days of radiosurgery.  With a median 
follow-up of 21.3 months, the 1-year local control ra te based on MRI imaging was 84%, and narcotic use 
decreased from 60% to 36% at six months.  Twenty -three percent of patients progressed radiographically, 
and the pattern of failure suggested that the pedicl es and posterior elements using a wide bone margin 
posterior to the involved vertebrae should be routinely included in the planning target volume.  The spinal 
 
Amendment 1: February 26, 2009 5cord was limited to 10 Gy in 5 fractions or 9 Gy in 3 fractions.  No patient developed grade 3 or 4 
neurologic toxicity (7). 
 
       Yamada and colleagues from Memorial Sloa n-Kettering Cancer Center tr eated 103 spinal metastases 
in 93 patients with SBRT to a median dose of 24 Gy (range 18-24 Gy), with the median percentage of the 
PTV receiving at least 95% of the dose being 95% (82- 100%).  No patient had received prior RT to the 
region of interest.  The maximum spinal cord dose w as limited to 14 Gy and the cauda equina dose was 
limited to 16 Gy.  With a median follow-up of 15 months, 90% of patients experienced durable pain 
control and local control.  The median time to local fa ilure was 9 months.  Local control was dose-related:  
95% for 24 Gy compared to 80% for < 24 Gy (mean 20.8 Gy).  Treatment failure was defined as disease 
progression on MRI.  Acute toxicity was generally m ild (grade 1-2), and there were not cases of late 
myelopathy or radiculopathy (8).  
       The Stanford University experience was re ported by Gibbs and colleagues.  Seventy-four patients 
with 102 spinal metastases were treated with Cyberkni fe.  The majority (50 patients) had prior radiation 
therapy within or adjacent to the tr eatment site.  Patients were treated to 16-25 Gy in 1-5 fractions, with 
fractionated treatment used when single-fraction SBRT  would give a cord Dmax > 10 Gy.  With a mean 
follow-up of 9 months, 84% had improvement or re solution of their symptoms and 3 patients (4%) 
developed clinical or radiographic signs of spinal cord injury at 6-10 months after treatment.   There were 
no clear spinal cord total dose or average dose that predicted these complications.  Two of three patients 
had received anti-angiogenic or epidermal growth fact or inhibitor-targeted ther apy within 2 months of 
developing clinical myelopathy.  No complicati ons occurred when the volume of cord receiving a 
biological equivalent dose of 12 Gy in a single fraction (BED
3 of 58 Gy) was less than 0.15 cm3.  Acute 
toxicity was uncommon and limited to nausea. They recommended using SBRT treatment schedules that 
limited the spinal cord biologic equivalent dose to 10 Gy to < 0.3 cc and 12 Gy to < 0.15 cc in 1 fraction 
(9). 
        The Stanford University experience in treati ng benign tumors of the spine has been reported.  Fifty-
one patients with 55 benign extra-axial, intradural spin al tumors were treated with Cyberknife stereotactic 
radiosurgery, including 30 schwannomas, 9 neurofibro mas, and 16 meningiomas.  Only 4 patients were 
previously irradiated.  Eligibility criteria were contraindications for surgery due to medical co-
morbidities, underlying Neurofibromatosis I (7 patients)  or II (10 patients) resulting in multiple lesions 
developing over time, or patient preference, with well-circumscribed lesions, no evidence of spinal 
instability and minimal compression of the spinal cord.   The most common presenting symptom was 
pain, followed by radiculopathy and myelopathy.  Pati ents were treated to 16-30 Gy in 1-5 fractions 
typically to the 80% IDL (most received 1-2 fractions ).  The median follow-up time was 23 months.  Of 
the 28 patients with greater than 24 months follow-up,  all have stabilized (61%) or decreased (39%) in 
size.  Radiosurgery was not very effective at reversi ng mass effect.  Three tumors enlarged by < 10% at 6-
12 months, two were transient and one underwent su rgery for worsening pre-existing meylopathy.  
Schwannoma patients experienced 96%  local control, with 56% stable and 40% decreased in size on 
imaging.  The majority experienced stabilized clin ical symptoms, 50% had significant pain improvement, 
and 40% had decreased weakness or improved sensa tion; 18% experienced clinical worsening.  
Meningioma patients experienced 100% local control,  with 67% stable and 33% decreased in size on 
imaging.  Approximately 70% significant improveme nt in pain and 50% had improved strength, but 
without improvement in sensory loss.  Thirty per cent experienced minor worsening pain, numbness, or 
weakness.  Only 50% of neurofibroma patients we re symptomatically stable, and none had improved 
clinical symptoms.  However, 6 of 7 patients w ho underwent follow-up imaging had stable disease.  
Interesting, the surgical literature also reports poor  symptomatic control.  One patient with a meningioma 
(2%) experienced presumed radiation myelopathy 8 months after SBRT to a dose of 24 Gy in 3 fractions (maximum dose 3435 cGy); the volume of cord irradiated to 18 Gy was 1.7 cm
3 (9,10).  
 
 
Amendment 1: February 26, 2009 6     Intramedullary spinal cord AVMs have also  been treated with SBRT.  A report from Stanford 
University on 15 patients treated to a mean prescrip tion dose of 20 Gy in 2-5 fractions.  With mean 
follow-up of 28 months, only 1 of 8 patients with fo llow-up angiography at 3 years showed complete 
obliteration; however, there were no further hemorrh ages or neurologic deterioration. The authors 
recommended not treating intramedullary lesions greater than 1.5 cm3 in volume, to minimize the chance 
of neural toxicity (9).           Sohn (from Korea) reported results at the Inte rnational Stereotactic Radiosurgery Society Meeting in 
July 2007 on the use of SBRT for 33 patients with  schwannoma or meningioma of the spine treated with 
the Novalis system.  Patients received a single fracti on of 13 Gy (schwannoma) or 15 Gy (meningioma) 
prescribed to the 80% isodose line.  For patients with  spinal cord compression, fractionated stereotactic 
radiosurgery was utilized (24 Gy in 3 fractions).  W ith a mean follow-up of two years, there were no late 
toxicities. 
 
       Also at the International Stereotactic Ra diosurgery Society Meeting in July 2007, Sahgal (UCSF) 
reported the results of 16 patients w ith benign spinal tumors treated w ith Cyberknife radiosurgery.  Doses 
ranged from 12 Gy in 1 fraction to 5 Gy in 5 fracti ons.  With a median follow-up of 25 months, there 
were no late toxicities.  Three patients with Neur ofibromatosis I progressed.  The one year freedom from 
progression rate was 89%.   
  St. John’s Mercy has installed an Elekta Synergy-S
® linear accelerator at the David C. Pratt Cancer 
Center that is specifically designed to deliver hi ghly-precise SBRT treatments.  It has a tightened 
isocenter accuracy calibrated to a precision of within 1.5 mm diameter, a micro-MLC for treatment of small radiation ports, a specially designed Hexapod
® table top that can correct for patient misalignment in 
both translational and rotational directions, an onboa rd cone-beam kV CT for precise tumor localization 
immediately prior to treatment, four-dimensional CT (4D-CT) and 3D Line® which together allow for 
accurate monitoring of and compensation for tumor moti on during respiration, activ e breathing control for 
respiratory gating, and real-time continuous fluorosco pic capability for visual confirmation that the target 
remains in the treatment field. 
 
2.0 Objectives  
  This study will evaluate the local control rate as we ll as acute and late toxicity rates of stereotactic 
body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the treatment of  spine metastases and benign spine tumors. 
 
 2.1 Hypothesis 
  2.1.1  For selected patients with spine metastases or  benign spine tumors, stereotactic body  
   radiotherapy (SBRT) is technically feasible with acceptable complication rates.   2.1.2  Local tumor control rate with stereotactic bod y radiotherapy (SBRT) will be at least as  
   good as standard fractionation radiation therapy. 
 
 2.2 Study Design  
  2.2.1  Single site, non-randomized, prospective, phase IV trial 
  2.2.2  Composed of 2 patient groups: 
        Spine Metastases         Benign Spine Tumors 
  2.2.3  Data collected will include patient demo graphics, pathology data, tumor stage,  
   SBRT dose fractionation scheme, dose received by adjacent critical normal tissues,     tumor recurrence data, and acute and late toxicities.     2.2.4  Follow up data will be collected during th e patient’s standard office visits.  The 
    anticipated duration of this study is 5 years. 
 
Amendment 1: February 26, 2009 7 2.3 End Points  
  2.3.1  Primary endpoints will be symptom cont rol and local tumor recurrence rate.   
   -  Evaluation of pain relief will be assessed using a 10-point visual analog scale 
   -  Analgesic use will be documented to ensu re that pain improvement is not due to an  
       increase in the amount of analgesic usage.     -  Evaluation of neurologic improvement  will be assessed by physical exam using the  
      ASIA Impairment Scale    - Local recurrence is defined as tumor recurrence or progression within the planning  
    target volume.  
- Local control rate will be evaluated by imag ing techniques and/or clinical symptoms  
 (worsening or no improvement in pain or neurologic compromise).  If follow-up     imaging is available, a local recurrenc e will be defined as an increase of > 20% in  
   tumor size.   
  2.3.2  Secondary endpoint will be late toxicity rate.  
   - Grading of acute and late complicati ons is defined in Section 12.3 (Appendix III)

   plus a 2-5 mm margin, at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.  It is     recommended that consideration be given to including the entire involved vertebral  
   body plus the pedicles and posterior el ements of the involved vertebral bodies.   
 
Amendment 1: February 26, 2009 9  6.1.4 The PTV for benign tumors will be defined as the CTV plus a 2-5 mm margin, at the  
   discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.  The PTV may be modified to exclude  
   the spinal cord and cauda equina volumes. 
   6.2 Normal Tissue Definition 
  6.2.1 Required normal tissue contours will vary accordin g to the level of spinal irradiation  
   and corresponding organs at risk.  The spinal cord (including the cauda equina when     appropriate) will be contoured for all cases.  The esophagus, stomach, bowel, kidneys,  
   liver, larynx, lungs, and heart will be contoured when appropriate. 
  6.2.2  Spinal cord – Contours should extend from th e superior slice of the planning CT scan  
   or the foramen magnum (whichever is most caudad) to the inferior slice of the  
   planning CT scan or the terminal end of th e spinal cord (whichever is most cephalad).  
   The volume may be expanded by 1-2 mm for setup uncertainty. 
  6.2.3  Cauda Equina – Contours should extend from th e superior slice of the planning CT  
   scan or the terminal end of the spinal cord  (whichever is most caudad) to the inferior  
   slice of the planning CT scan or the termin al end of the cauda equina (which is most  
   cephalad), and includes the entire thecal sac.  The volume may be expanded by     1-2 mm for setup uncertainty. 
6.2.4 Esophagus – Contours should include the entire esophagus, from 2 cm above the  
 manubrium to the level of the gastroesophageal (GE) junction.  When possible, oral  
 contrast should be utilized to aid in volume definition. 6.2.5 Stomach – Contours should include the entire st omach, with the proximal limit at the  
   GE junction.  When possible, oral contrast should be utilized to aid in volume  
   definition. 
  6.2.6  Bowel – Contours should include both small and large bowel.  When possible, oral  
   contrast should be utilized to aid in volume definition. 
  6.2.7  Kidneys – Contours should include the entire left and right kidneys, including the  
   renal parenchama and adjacent proximal collecting system. 
  6.2.8  Liver – Contours should include the entire liver, from the hepatic dome to its inferior  
   border.  
  6.2.9  Larynx – Contours should include the entire larynx, from the hyoid bone through the  
   cricoid cartilage 
  6.2.10  Lungs – Contours should include the entire left lung, right lung, and both lungs. 
  6.2.11  Heart – Contours should include the entire heart along with the pericardial sac, from  
   the upper limit of the right atrium and right ventricle (excluding the pulmonary trunk,  
   ascending aorta, and SVC) to the inferior extent of the myocardium. 
  6.2.12  Skin – Contour should include a 5 mm thick volume beneath the skin surface. 
 
 6.3 Dose-Specification 
  6.3.1  Radiation beams will conform to the PTV outline without additional margin and the  
   dose will be prescribed to the isodose line (ID L) that covers at least 95% of the PTV, 
   which is typically around 80%.    6.3.2  SBRT dose-fractionation scheme will be chosen at the discretion of the treating  
   radiation oncologist, but the normal tissue dose constraints must be maintained. 
   Suggested dose-fractionation schemes, deri ved from the available literature, are listed 
   below.  Also included are the corresponding biologic equivalent dose (BED) for each 
   based on the linear-quadratic model:

7.0 Stereotactic Body Radiot herapy Treatment Delivery 
 
 7.1 Premedication 
  The decision to premedicate a patient prior to spine SBRT is at the discretion of the  
  radiation oncologist and/or neurosurgeon.  While there is no universal agreement, the  
  following are a list of agents that have been suggested by some investigators to potentially  
  reduce patient discomfort, and possibly prevent acute and/or late toxicity if used as  
  premedication prior to spine SBRT.  
  7.1.1 Corticosteroids (Decadron 4-10 mg PO or equivalent) 15-60 minutes prior to each  
   fraction for the intended purpose of modulating immediate inflammatory effects.     7.1.2 Analgesic premedication to avoid general di scomfort during long treatment durations.  
  7.1.3  Prophylactic antiemetics (Zofran 4-8 mg PO or Kytril 2 mg PO) 45-60 minutes prior  
   to each fraction to possibly prevent acute nausea 
  7.1.4  Anti-anxiety medication for patient comfort during long treatment duration 
  7.2 Treatment  
  7.2.1  The medical physics staff will perform routine quality assurance checks on the  
   treatment machine to ensure that the mechanical isocenter stability is within  
   specification (ie. diameter < 1.5 mm).  
 
Amendment 1: February 26, 2009 12  7.2.2  The medical physics staff will perform patient-specific quality assurance  
   measurements to ensure that the treatme nt plan is deliverable and that the dose  
   distribution is accurate.  
  7.2.3  The patient will be positioned in the cu stom immobilization device on the Hexapod®  
   treatment couch and aligned to 3-poi nt setup points with the in-room lasers. 
  7.2.4 Daily CT localization of the GTV isocenter is required prior to each fraction.  Once  
   the patient is properly positioned, a cone -beam CT of the treatment area is acquired,  
   fused, and aligned to the treatment pl anning CT.  Translational and rotational  
   adjustments of patient positioning are performed as indicated.  If adjustments are  
   required, an orthogonal (ex. AP and LATERAL) set of electron portal images or a     second cone-beam CT of the treatment area will be obtained prior to treatment 
   to confirm proper alignment of the is ocenter.  A third cone-beam CT may be  
   obtained following treatment deliver y to assess for intra-fraction motion.   
   Depending on the overall treatment time, an additional cone-beam CT scan may be  
   obtained during treatment at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist to     ensure accuracy of the isocente r alignment and target localization. 
  7.2.5  Either multiple coplanar or noncoplanar static  gantry angle intensity-modulated fields  
   or rotational arcs will be utilized. 
  7.2.6  Only photon (x-ray) beams will be used, preferably in energies of 6-18 MV. 
 8.0 Drug Therapy 
 
 8.1 The use of chemotherapy is left to the discretion of the medical oncologist. 
 8.2 Chemotherapy agents during radiation is not allo wed.  Ideally, chemotherapy should not have  
  been given within 30 days of starting radiation and should not resume until at least 2 weeks  
  after completing radiation.  In addition, it is not recommended to perform SBRT when  
  targeted anti-angiogenesis therapy is pla nned within 2 months of the procedure.  
 9.0 Patient Assessment

      withdrawn from the study to allow for proper medical care.   
 10.0 Risk/Benefit Analysis 
  10.1 Risk associated with SBRT for sp ine metastases and primary spine tumors 
  10.1.1  Acute toxicities reported to occur as a result of SBRT for spine metastases and  
   benign spine tumors include, but are not limited to:  general malaise, nausea,     anorexia, radiation dermatitis, local hair loss, local musculoskeletal pain,     dysphagia/esophagitis, hoarseness, diarrh ea, and neurologic changes including motor  
   weakness, numbness, and/or paresthesias   10.1.2  Late toxicities reported to occur as a result of SBRT for spine metastases and benign 
spine tumors are uncommon and primarily ne urologic, consisting of motor weakness, 
numbness, and/or paresthesias.  Other serious  late toxicities are rare and may include 
vertebral body collapse, persistent dysphagi a, esophageal stricture, bowel ulceration 
and/or perforation, impaired liver function,  reduction in kidney function, reduction in 
lung function, hypothyroidism, persistent hoarseness, and localized skin fibrosis 
edema and/or ulceration. 
  10.2 Minimization of Risks 
  Although the risks outlined in Section 9.3 may occur, the likelihood of serious events  
  occurring is considered uncommon as long as cer tain precautions are taken.  The potential  
  risks have been minimized by: 
  - Premedication as described in Section 7.1 
  - Strict compliance with normal tissue dose constraints as described in Sections 6.4   10.3 Potential Patient Benefits 
  10.3.1 Ability to offer effective and expedient local therapy to patients with limited life  
   expectancy from spine metastases 
  10.3.2  Reduction in amount of radiation delivered to adjacent normal structures compared to  
   standard-fractionation radiation therapy 
10.3.3  Reduced treatment duration compared to standard-fractionation radiation therapy 
10.3.4  Ability to avoid surgery pote ntially associated with significant risk of morbidity 
 
 10.4 Justification of the Study 
  Patients who have spine metastases are not curable and often have a limited life expectancy.   
  Local tumor control is important for prevention of tumor-related pain, pathologic fractures,    and neurologic deterioration due to spinal cord / cauda equina compression.  Standard  
  fractionation radiation therapy consists of a daily treatment regimen for approximately 2-3  
 
Amendment 1: February 26, 2009 15  weeks, and has demonstrated unsatisfactory comple te pain relief rates and tumor control rates.   
  Stereotactic body radiotherapy shortens the radiation course to only 1-5 sessions.  Non- 
  surgical treatment for recurrent spine metasta ses is very limited.  Traditional radiation therapy  
  cannot be repeated at the same site in the spin e, due to the increased risk of injury to normal  
  tissue.  Spinal surgery is often difficult and can  be associated with significant risk, or may not  
  be an option due to prior surgery, other medical conditions or limited life expectancy.     Stereotactic body radiotherapy offers an alte rnative to surgery for management of recurrent  
  disease.  Recent phase I/II trials of SBRT for spine metastases have reported local tumor  
  control rates of 81-95%, durable improvemen t in pain of 67-100%, and improvement in  
  neurologic function of 84%, with low toxicity rates.  Surgical management of patients with  
  benign spine tumors can be associated with signi ficant risk of morbidity.  The advantage of  
  stereotactic body radiotherapy is that it is not painful, and does not require anesthesia or  
  hospitalization.     
   
 10.5 Statistical Analysis 
  10.5.1  The overall survival and local control rates will be analyzed. 
  10.5.2  The incidence rate for any serious adverse events will be calculated.

STUDY TITLE: PHASE IV TRIAL EVALUATING THE USE OF STEREOTACTIC BODY  
 RADIOTHERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF SPINE METASTASES AND  
 PRIMARY SPINE TUMORS  This is a clinical trial (type of research study).  Cl inical trials include only patients who choose to take 
part.  This consent form may contain words that yo u do not understand.  Please ask the study doctor or the 
study staff to explain any words or information th at you do not clearly understand.  You may take home 
an unsigned copy of this consent form to think ab out or discuss with family and friends before making 
your decision.    WHAT SHOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT THE RESEARCH DOCTOR? 
 
You should know that your relationship with a resea rch doctor is different from your relationship with 
your personal doctor.  Your personal doctor is treating your specific problem with the hope of a benefit 
for you.  When a doctor is your research doctor, he/she  is treating all subjects under a specific protocol to 
learn about the results of a treatment, and with th e understanding that you may or may not benefit from 
your participation in the study.  Be sure to ask questio ns of the study doctor if you want more information 
about this relationship. 
 WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING PERFORMED?   Treatment of cancer that has spread to the spine (metas tases) and tumors that begin in the spine (primary 
tumors) is challenging and the outcome is often di sappointing.  Treatment may consist of surgery, 
radiation therapy, or a combination of surgery followe d by radiation therapy.  Radiation therapy has been 
used to improve local tumor control, alleviate tumo r-related pain, prevent spine fractures, and improve 
neurologic symptoms such as weakness and numbness. Spinal surgery is often difficult and can be 
associated with significant risk, or may not be an optio n due to prior surgery or other medical conditions.  
While a standard course of radiation therapy may take  2-6 weeks of daily treatment to complete, recent 
technological advancements allow high-dose precisely targ eted radiation treatment to be delivered in only 
1-5 sessions.  This technique is called stereotactic bo dy radiotherapy.  The advantage of stereotactic 
radiotherapy over surgery is that it is not painful,  and does not require anesthesia or hospitalization.  
Several institutions have reported ex cellent local tumor control, pain relief, and neurologic improvement, 
with low toxicity risk.  The purpose of this study is to collect additional data on the effectiveness of 
stereotactic body radiotherapy for spine metastases and primary spine tumors.   
 HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THE STUDY?  Approximately 50 people are expected to participate in this clinical study.  
 
WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY? 
 If you wish to take part in this study, a series of t ests will be performed to determine if you qualify for 
participation in the clinical study.  Your physic ian will ask you a series of questions regarding your 
 
Amendment 1: February 26, 2009 17medical history and a standard physical exam will be  performed.  If you are a woman of childbearing age, 
you may be asked to give a urine or blood specime n so that a pregnancy test can be performed.  
 
If you qualify for the study, you will undergo a radiation treatment planning session called a simulation.  
At this visit, a custom rigid foam device will be fa bricated to immobilize your body in the correct position 
for treatment.  A CT scan and an MRI scan will be obtained to plan your treatment.  Permanent small tattoos may be applied to your skin to aid in  positioning your body on the treatment table. 
 
There may be several days between the simulation an d the day you begin radiation.  During this time, 
complex radiation treatment planning will be performed  by your radiation oncologist and their medical 
physics staff.  You will receive between 1-5 radia tion treatments.  Your physician will explain your 
treatment in more detail.  Each radiation session may ta ke an hour or longer to complete.  After the entire 
radiation course is complete, you will be  given follow-up instructions.    
 
HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THE STUDY?  We anticipate that you will remain in the study for a pproximately 5 years.  After treatment is completed 
routine follow-up visits will be conducted, typically at 3 month intervals for the first year, then less 
frequently. 
 Your physician may decide stop your treatment if: 1) your disease becomes worse, or 2) side effects become very severe, or 3) new scientific developments occur that indicate the treatment is not in your best 
interest, or 4) your physician believes that this tr eatment is no longer in your best interest.  If your 
treatment is stopped, your doctor will discuss further treatment options with you.  
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?  By participating in this study, you are at risk for sev eral possible expected and unexpected side effects 
associated with stereotactic body radiotherapy to the spine.  Some of these are described below; however, 
there also may be other side effects that we cannot pr edict.  Most side effects go away shortly after the 
radiation therapy is stopped, but in some cases side e ffects can be serious, long-lasting, or permanent.  
 Risks arising from the delivery of stereotactic radi otherapy to the spine which may occur shortly after 
completing treatment may include, but are not limited to:   • Fatigue 
 • Nausea occurring within a few hours of treatment 
 • Loss of appetite  • Hair loss over the treatment area  • Skin redness over the treatment area  • Skin tanning over the treatment area 
 • Dry peeling of skin over the treatment area 
 • Moist desquamation over the treatment area  • Dry itchy skin  • Muscular pain over the treatment area  • Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)  • Dyspnea (shortness of breath) 
 • Hoarseness 
 • Diarrhea 
• Neurologic changes including motor weakness, numbness, and/or paresthesias  
 
 
Amendment 1: February 26, 2009 18Risks arising from the delivery of stereotactic ra diotherapy to the spine which may develop several 
months to years after completing treatment may include, but are not limited to:  
 • Bleeding ulceration and/or perforation (hole)  in the stomach, duodenum, and/or small bowel 
 • Scarring, swelling, and/or ulceration of the skin over the treatment area  • Persistent dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) or esophageal stricture  • Persistent hoarseness  • Decrease in liver function  • Decrease in kidney function 
 • Dyspnea (shortness of breath) due to decrease in lung function 
 • Decrease in thyroid function  • Vertebral body collapse / fracture 
• Neurologic changes including motor weakness, numbness, and/or paresthesias 
 
I understand that all these side effects are possible.  I may experience no side effects, some of them, or 
most of them.  Although I will be closely monitored, not all side effects can be predicated and unforeseen 
problems can arise.  I understand that there may be some unknown or unanticipated risks or discomforts 
in addition to those specified here.  
Reproductive risks:  Because even very small doses of  radiation can affect an unborn baby, you should 
not become pregnant while receiving radiation treat ment.  You should also not nurse a baby while 
receiving radiation treatment.   ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKI NG PART IN THE STUDY? 
 
If you agree to take part in this study, there may or ma y not be a direct medical benefit to you.  However, 
there have been several trials completed at other ins titutions that have shown high local control rates, 
improvement in pain and neurologic symptoms after stereotactic body radiotherapy for spine metastases 
and primary spine tumors.  It is also convenient, re quiring only 1-5 radiation sessions and no anesthesia or 
hospitalization.  Toxicity risk has been reported to be fairly low. 
 
WHAT OTHER OPTIONS ARE THERE?  Other treatment options may include surgery, chemot herapy, standard-fractionation radiation therapy, or 
other investigational procedures or medications.  Anot her option is no further therapy.  Your doctor can 
provide information about your disease and the benefits of the different treatments for you.  You should 
feel free to talk with your doctor about your disease and expected outcomes.  The doctor involved in your 
care will be available to answer any questions you have about this program.  You are free to ask your 
doctor any questions concerning this program now or in the future.  
 You are free to seek care from a doctor of your choice at any time.  If you do not take part in, or withdraw 
from, the study you will continue to receive alternate care.   
 WHAT ABOUT CONFIDENTIALITY?  Efforts will be made to keep your personal info rmation confidential.  We cannot guarantee absolute 
confidentiality.  This Informed Consent and anot her document called an “Authorization to Use and 
Disclose Health Information” control how your health  information may be used and disclosed during and 
after this study.  The results of this study may be published or presented at meetings but will not include 
your name or reveal your identity.  To participate in this study, you must sign both the Informed Consent and the Authorization to Use and Disclose Health Information.  Your personal information may be 
disclosed if required by law.

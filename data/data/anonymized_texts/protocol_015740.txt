Since the primary intent of this trial is to evaluate the effect of the drug when taken 
as intended in the protocol, a hypothetical strategy will be employed for the 
intercurrent event of treatment/study discontinuation (due to any reason). 
Specifically, the assumption will be that had the subjects not discontinued, their 
efficacy would have been similar to the efficacy of subjects from the same treatment 
group who did not discontinue. For other intercurrent events that do not cause 
treatment/study discontinuation such as modest treatment non- compliance, protocol 
allowed dose adjustments, or initiation or adjustment of concomitant medications 
related to other symptoms all observed values will be used.

Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019STUDY SUMMARY (SYNOPSIS)
Title: AMulticenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled Trial of
Troriluzolein Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Rationale: First-line treatment forGeneralized Anxiety Disorder(GAD)includes 
cognitive behavior therapy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Nonetheless, up 
to 50% of patients have an inadequate response to conventional 
pharmacotherapy[1]. While SSRIs, SNRIs, buspirone and some 
benzodiazepines have been approved for GAD, the majority of patients do 
not have an adequate response to pharmacologic treatment.
The proposed study is based on recent preclinical, clinical, and
neuroimaging studies that implicate glutamatergic hyperactivity in the 
pathogenesis of GAD [2-8]. In addition. the results from apublished 
clinical studyexamining the use of riluzole, a glutamate modulating agent,
suggested efficacy in patients with GAD[2-4].
Troriluzoleis anovel glutamate modulating drug that is being developed 
for thepotential treatment ofGAD.
Troriluzoleis a tripeptide prodrug of the glutamate modulating agent 
riluzolethat has been optimized for improved bioavailability, 
pharmacokinetics and dosing. Riluzole is currently only indicated for ALS 
and has a number of non-desirable attributes that have limited its clinical 
use. Key limitations of riluzole include:
•Poor oral bioavailability —When riluzole is administered in a tablet 
form, approximately 40% is either not absorbed or is metabolized in the 
liver before reaching systemic circulation. 
•Negative food effect —Riluzole must be taken on an empty stomach, at 
least one hour before or two hours after a meal. Failure to adhere to these 
guidelines results in lower drug levels and potentially decreased 
therapeutic effects.
•Negative effect on liver —Riluzole has been shown to have dose-
dependent liver effects that include elevations on liver function tests. 
Taking riluzole necessitates regular laboratory monitoring of liver 
function. 
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol V03 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 6of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019•Pharmacokinetic variability —Due to extensive first-pass metabolism 
and CYP1A2 metabolism.
Troriluzolewas developed to address limitations of riluzole that have 
restricted its broader clinical application. Based on thepreclinical features of 
troriluzoleand data from a completed Phase 1 studyof troriluzole, we 
anticipate the clinical pharmacology to offer favorable properties as compared 
to available riluzole: 
1. Troriluzoleis expected to have better oral bioavailability ;
2. Troriluzoleis expected to have no food restrictions imposed ;
3. Troriluzoleis designed to release riluzole after bypassing first-pass 
metabolism and thus confer lower overall drug burden to the liver , which 
may translate into a better safety and tolerability profile;
4. Troriluzoleis expected to have reduced pharmacokinetic variability and be 
dosed only once daily .
As an optimized prodrug of riluzole, the regulatory pathway for troriluzole
will rely on toxicology data with troriluzolein rodents and non-human 
primates, clinical experience with troriluzolein other clinical disorders such 
as spinocerebellar ataxia, and the well-characterized safety experience of 
riluzole, which has been marketed globally for over 20 years and is considered 
safeand well tolerated.
Target 
Population:Male and female outpatient subjects between the ages of 18 -65
years, inclusive, with a primaryDSM-5 diagnosis of Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder(confirmed by the MINI) who have aHamilton 
Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) score of 18 or greater at screening 
and baseline.  Additionally, GADsymptoms in subjects had to be 
present for year and at least of moderate severity on the Clinical 
Global Impression -Severity of Illness Scaleat study entry.
Number of 
Subjects:Approximately 372 randomized subjects

Design:BHV4157-207 is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, 2-arm study designed to assess safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy of troriluzolein subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorderwho 
have a Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) score of 18 or greater at 
screening and baseline.  Additionally, GAD symptoms in subjects had to be 
Impression Scale-Severity of Illness scale at study entry.
Subjects who qualifywill be randomized to receive placebo (BID) or 
troriluzole(100 mg BID).
Dosing will continue for 8 weeks. Eligible subjects will have the
opportunity to continue in a 48 week open label extension phase. Those 
subjects not continuing in the 48 week extension will return to the clinic 
two weeks after discontinuing study medication for a follow-up safety 
visit.
For subjects entering the Extension Phase, their first in-person Extension 
Visit will be four weeks after the Week 8 Randomization Phase visit. 
Subjects will undergo visits everyfourth week through Week 12 of this 
phase. Then subjects will undergo visits every 12 weeks up to Week 48 of 
this phase. All subjects will undergo a post study drug termination visit 
two weeks after the last dose of study drug in the Extension Phase.

Draft Version 03; 01 Aug20191 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE
1.1 Background
Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. [Biohaven] is developing a new drug, troriluzole(BHV4157),
for the treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Troriluzoleis a novel and optimized 
prodrug of the glutamatergic agent riluzole. The FDA originally approved riluzole 
(RILUTEK®) 50 mg twice-a-day(NDA #20-599) for the treatment of patients with 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Riluzole, which is only indicated for ALS, has been 
marketed globally for over 20 years and is considered safe and well tolerated but has a number 
of non-desirable attributes that have limited its clinical use. Troriluzoleis a tripeptide prodrug 
of the glutamate modulating agent riluzole that has been optimized for improved 
bioavailability, pharmacokinetics and dosing. The proposed study in GADis based on recent 
preclinical, clinical and neuroimaging studies that implicate glutamatergic hyperactivity in the 
pathogenesis of GAD[2-8]. Biohaven hypothesizes that the glutamatemodulation effects of 
troriluzolemay address underlying pathologic brain function that is associated with GAD, and 
thus provide symptomatic benefit in patients suffering from GAD.
1.1.1 Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)
GAD represents adisorder of significant unmet need, affecting approximately 4.3% of the 
population at some point in their life[9] Approximatelyone-third of cases areconsidered 
severe.  GAD is a chronic condition characterized by excessive anxiety and worry that is out of 
proportion to actual context and causes significant distress or functional impairment.  Rates of 
full remission have been observed to be low[10], with recovery rates from the index episode of 
less than 60% after a 12-year follow-up. Of those who experienced a recovery, approximately 
half experienced a recurrence within the same observation period [10], over 25% recurring 
within 3 years of remission [11] In clinical studies of approved treatments (SSRIs and SNRIs) 
the rates of remission are typically less than 50%[1]. Patients who experience a partial recovery 
are more vulnerable to relapse[12]. Further, patients with GAD have increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease. The social impact includes increased risk of not marrying, absenteeism 
(average of one week per month), increased risk of suicide, and high healthcare costs. Minimal 
research has been conducted on the treatment of GAD that has not responded to conventional 
therapy. Frequently treatment-resistant patients are adjunctively administered benzodiazepines 
despite the potential for abuse and consequently symptom exacerbation. Based on the unmet 
medical need described above, additional treatments are required for populations with GAD
that has not responded adequately to pharmacotherapy.
1.1.2 Rationale for Troriluzole in the Treatment of GAD
The proposed study is based on recent preclinical, clinical, and neuroimaging studies that 
implicate glutamatergic hyperactivity in the pathogenesis of GAD[2-8] Preclinical data with 
riluzole (the active metabolite of troriluzole)demonstrated rapid acting antianxiety effects in 
multiple preclinical models.  Efficacy was similar to a benzodiazepine comparator but superior 
on cognitive tests [7, 8, 13].

Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 18of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019Open label data also suggest benefit from the glutamate modulator riluzole in individuals with 
GAD. In a open-label study by Mathew, 12 of 15 patients treated who completed the trial 
responded positively to riluzole on the HAM-Aover the 8 week course of the trial[2].  As part 
of this study, subjects received proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic 
resonance imaging scans to measure the effect of riluzole on N-acetylaspartate (NAA), which 
is a mitochondrial amino acid considered to be a marker of neuronal integrity.  In general, 
responders showed increases in hippocampal NAA compared to nonresponders and a 
relationship was seen between changes in hippocampal NAA and anxiety symptoms at study 
end compared to baseline [3].   In addition, MRI showed a positive correlation between 
hippocampal volume, NAA concentration and HAM-A improvement [4].  
The tremendous unmet medical need in anxiety disorders combined with favorable clinical 
experience with riluzole to date, warrant the identification and clinical development of an 
optimized formulation of riluzole.  The therapeutic potential of riluzole has been suggested by 
multiple clinical reports and trials on its active metabolite suggesting favorable effects in 
patients with a variety of psychiatric  conditions.
1.1.2.1 Pre-Clinical Studies
Data from preclinical studies support the following findings. Please refer to the IB for 
additional pre-clinical information. 
No activity at a broad screen of enzymes and receptors, including hERG
Toxicology studies in rats and monkeys reveal no novel findings relative to what has been 
reported for riluzole;
Safety pharmacology studies indicate no clinically relevant changes in hERG, 
cardiovascular parameters or respiratory parameters. Minimal changes on neurobehavioral 
parameters at high dose levels are consistent with the known sedative effects of riluzole in 
rats;
No signals for carcinogenicity (negative for Ames assay, in vitro chromosomal aberrations 
and in vivo micronucleus)

Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 19of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019The longer-term safety profile of troriluzole is expected to be similar to riluzole based on the 
following: 
Troriluzole is a tripeptide prodrug of riluzole. It readily metabolizes to riluzole and
composite amino acids, sarcosine and glycine. These amino acids are generally non- toxic 
and will be taken up into their normal physiologic role in the body; 
Troriluzole was designed to be stable enough to bypass first-pass metabolism before being 
metabolized.  Performance in healthy volunteers has been similar to what has been 
observed in preclinical species, insofar as the concentrations of troriluzole have been 
negligible compared to active metabolite and time to peak concentration of the active 
metabolite has been delayed relative to troriluzole. In addition, the time to peak 
concentration of the active metabolite (Tmax) is delayed compared to troriluzole.  This 
Tmax is longer than that seen with rilutek tablets.  This PK pattern of delayed time to peak 
riluzole concentration is consistent with diminished first pass liver metabolism.
Troriluzole has no relevant intrinsic receptor activity as tested in 88 ion channels and 
receptors, including hERG; 
Toxicology assessments in two preclinical species reflect no novel safety signals as 
compared to riluzole; 
Troriluzole, dosed between 140-280 mg, contains a comparablemolar amount of riluzole as 
found in a 70-140 mg dose of riluzole, well below the 200 mg daily dose of riluzole that has 
been studied in frail subjects with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis where it was found to be 
safely administered and generally well-tolerated.

BHV4157-201 was a Phase 2b/3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
parallel-group study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of troriluzole in 
subjects with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). Subjects were randomized to receive troriluzole
(140 mg PO once daily [QD]) or placebo for 8 weeks. A total of 141 subjects were randomized 
into the double-blind randomization phase (71 subjects in the troriluzole 140 mg QD group and 
70 subjects in the placebo group). 
During the double-blind randomization phase, administration of troriluzole at 140 mg QD for 8 
weeks was well tolerated in adult subjects with SCA. There were no deaths reported during the 
randomization phase of this study. Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported for 5 (3.55%) 
subjects, including 4 troriluzole-treated subjects (asthenia, atrial fibrillation, blood creatine 
phosphokinase increased, dehydration, back pain and cerebral infarction), and 1 placebo- 
treated subject (chest discomfort). No clinically meaningful trends in laboratory values were 
identified in this study. No subject had AST or ALT laboratory abnormalities > 3 X ULN. 
Subjects who completed the double-blind randomization phase were offered 96 weeks of open- 
label treatment with troriluzole (140 mg PO QD) in an extension phase. In the first 48-week 
portion of the Extension Phase, subjects who experienced a decline (as defined by 
demonstration of a 2 point or greater decline from baseline on the SARA scale on each of the 
two most recent consecutive visits accompanied by PI impression of clinical worsening) may 
be increased to 280 mg daily.  One hundred and thirty (131) subjects continued into the open-
label extension phase, which is currently on-going.  To date, the preliminary safety profile of 
troriluzole 140 mg QD is consistent with the troriluzole safety profile observed during the 
randomization phase. CCI

Draft Version 03; 01 Aug20191.1.3 Potential for Drug-Drug Interactions
Troriluzole: Troriluzole, itself, is not expected to interfere with drug metabolism and its 
cleavage via plasma peptidases renders it unlikely to be affected significantly by liver 
cytochrome P450 inhibitors. Troriluzolehas the following known pharmacokinetic/metabolism 
parameters:
Not an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, orCYP2D6
In CYP inductionstudies:
oThe estimated E -fold 
induction,respectively;
o -fold 
induction, respectively;and
oTroriluzoledid not increase CYP3A4 mRNA at doses up to 30
Riluzole Metabolism: Troriluzolemetabolizes to riluzole. As per the USPI, riluzole metabolism 
has been assessed in special populations, characterized by hepatic impairment (2 to 3 fold 
increase in AUC with Child-Pugh Scores of A and B), renal impairment (no effect), age (no 
effect), gender (no effect), smokers (20% faster elimination) and race (Japanese compared to 
Caucasians: no effect).
Effect of other drugs on Riluzole metabolism: In vitro studies using human liver microsomal 
preparations suggest that CYP1A2 is the principal isozyme involved in the initial oxidative 
metabolism of riluzole and, therefore, potential interactions may occur when riluzole is given 
concurrently with agents that affect CYP1A2 activity. Potential inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g., 
cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, fluvoxamine, methoxsalen, mexiletine, oral 
contraceptives, thiabendazole, vemurafenib, zileuton ) could decrease the rate of riluzole 
elimination, while inducers of CYP1A2 (e.g., cigarette smoke, charcoal-broiled food, 
rifampicin, and omeprazole) could increase the rate of riluzole elimination.
Effect of Riluzole on the Metabolism of Other Drugs: CYP1A2 is the principal isoenzyme 
involved in the initial oxidative metabolism of riluzole; potential interactions may occur when 
riluzole is given concurrently with other agents which are also metabolized primarily by 
CYP1A2 (e.g., theophylline, caffeine, and tacrine). Currently, it is not known whether riluzole 
has any potential for enzyme induction in humans.
Clinical drug interaction studies for troriluzolehave not been conducted yet.
1.1.4 Clinical Adverse Event Profile
Troriluzole readily metabolizes to riluzole. Therefore, the 20 years’ global clinical experience 
is important to summarize herein.

Draft Version 03; 01 Aug20191.1.4.3 Riluzole
Clinical information on riluzole, as reflected in the USPI, is predominantly based on experience 
from approximately 4000 patients given riluzole for ALS. Refer to the US Prescribing 
Information (15) where greater details on the adverse event profile of riluzole can be found.  
The following summarizes relevant information.
Overall, riluzole tablets have been well tolerated in populations with ALS and diverse 
neuropsychiatric conditions that include Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and spinocerebellar ataxia. In randomized controlled trials comparing 
a 100 mg daily dose of riluzole with placebo, no AEs occurred at rates greater than 5% and 
twice that of placebo. The AEs occurring greater than 5% and at least 2% more than placebo 
included asthenia (18% vs 12% placebo) and nausea (14% vs 9%). These two AEs showed 
trends for a dose response (16). The published literature on the use of riluzole tablets in 
psychiatric disorders, while generally comprised of case-series, is consistent with this 
tolerability profile.
The most commonly observed AEs associated with the use of riluzole tablets more frequently
than placebo treated patients were:
asthenia;
nausea;
dizziness;
decreased lung function;  
diarrhea;
abdominal pain; 
pneumonia; 
vomiting;
vertigo; 
circumoral paresthesia;
anorexia; andCCI
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol V03 Confidential

Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019somnolence.
Approximately 14% (n = 141) of the 982 individuals with ALS who received riluzole in pre-
marketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse experience. Of those 
patients who discontinued due to adverse events, the most commonly reported were: nausea, 
abdominal pain, constipation, and ALT elevations. In a dose response study in ALS patients, 
the rates of discontinuation of RILUTEK for asthenia, nausea, abdominal pain, and ALT 
elevation were dose related. The AEs of asthenia, nausea, dizziness, diarrhea, anorexia, vertigo, 
somnolence, andcircumoralparesthesia were dose related. Assessment of pulmonary AEs is 
confounded by the underlying illness, ALS, which is associated with respiratorysymptoms.
1.1.4.3.1 Elevations in Liver Function Tests
Troriluzolehas not been associated with significant changes in liver function or pathology in 
nonclinical toxicology studies to date, as reflected in the IB. No clinically significant LFT 
changes were observed on study drug in BHV4157-101.  In the ongoing clinical trial in SCA, 
LFTs remain blinded; however, no subjects were required to discontinue study medication due 
to elevated LFTs.  
Riluzole is associated with elevations in aminotransferases that have been reflected in 
monitoring precautions that will be followed within this protocol. Experience in almost 800 
ALS patients indicates that about 50% of riluzole-treated patients will experience at least one 
ALT/SGPT level above the upper limit of normal, about 8% will have elevations > 3 X ULN, 
and about 2% of patients will have elevations > 5 X ULN. A single non-ALS patient with 
epilepsy treated with concomitant carbamazepine and phenobarbital experienced marked, rapid 
elevations of liver enzymes with jaundice (ALT 26 X ULN, AST 17 X ULN, and bilirubin 11 
X ULN) four months after starting riluzole; these returned to normal 7 weeks after treatment 
discontinuation. Maximum increases in serum ALT usually occurred within 3 months after the 
start of riluzole therapy and were usually transient when < 5 times ULN. In trials, if ALT levels 
were < 5 times ULN, treatment continued and ALT levels usually returned to below 2 times 
ULN within 2 to 6 months. Treatment in studies was discontinued, however, if ALT levels 
exceeded 5 X ULN, so that there is no experience with continued treatment of ALS patients 
once ALT values exceed 5 times ULN. There were rare instances of jaundice. There is limited 
experience with rechallenge of patients who have had riluzole discontinued for ALT > 5 X 
ULN, but there is the possibility of increased ALT values reoccurring. Therefore, rechallenge is 
not recommended. In post-marketing experience, cases of clinical hepatitis associated with 
riluzole have been reported, including one with fatal outcome.
1.1.4.3.2 Neutropenia
Troriluzolehas not been associated with hematologic findings in nonclinical toxicology studies 
to date. In Study BHV4157-101, one subject in the 17.5 mg BID cohort experienced transient 
and mildly decreased white blood cell count after three days of treatment; however, this subject 
evidenced moderate decline during the screening period prior to medication administration.  
The subject’s count increased while on continued study drug and normalized within 6 days 
after onset.
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol V03 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 27of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019For riluzole, according to the USPI, rare cases of neutropenia were reported. Among 
approximately 4,000 patients given riluzole for ALS in clinical trials, there were three cases of 
marked neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count less than 500/mm3), all seen within the first 2 
months of riluzole treatment. In one case, neutrophil counts rose on continued treatment. In a 
second case, counts rose after therapy was stopped. A third casewas more complex, with 
marked anemia as well as neutropenia and the etiology of both is uncertain. Patients should be 
warned to report any febrile illness to their physicians. The report of a febrile illness should 
prompt treating physicians to check white blood cell counts.
1.1.4.3.3 Interstitial Lung Disease
Troriluzolehas not been associated with pulmonary findings in nonclinical toxicology studies 
to date.
For riluzole according to the USPI, rare cases of interstitial lung disease have been reported, 
some of them severe; upon further investigation, many of these cases were hypersensitivity 
pneumonitis. If respiratory symptoms develop such as dry cough and/or dyspnea, chest 
radiography should be performed, and in case of findings suggestive of interstitial lung disease 
or hypersensitivity pneumonitis (e.g., bilateral diffuse lung opacities), riluzole should be 
discontinued immediately. In the majority of the reported cases, symptoms resolved after drug 
discontinuation and symptomatic treatment.
1.1.5 Potential Risk to Fetal Development
Troriluzolehas not yet been assessed in fertility and fetal development studies.
As described in the USPI, oral administration of riluzole to pregnant animals during the period 
of organogenesis caused embryotoxicity in rats and rabbits at doses of 27 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg, 
respectively, or 2.6 and 11.5 times, respectively, the recommended maximum human daily 
dose on a mg/m2 basis. Evidence of maternal toxicity was also observed at these doses. When 
administered to rats prior to and during mating (malesand females) and throughout gestation 
and lactation (females), riluzole produced adverse effects on pregnancy (decreased 
implantations, increased intrauterine death) and offspring viability and growth at an oral dose 
of 15 mg/kg or 1.5 times the maximum daily dose on a mg/m2 basis. There are no adequate and 
well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Riluzole should be used during pregnancy only if 
the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to thefetus.
1.2 StudyRationale
1.2.1 Study Design Rationale
Troriluzoleis a glutamate modulating drug that is being developed for the potential treatment 
of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Alzeimer’s 
disease. This protocol represents the first trial of troriluzolein Generalized Anxiety Disorder
(GAD).
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol V03 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 28of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019Troriluzoleis a novel tripeptide prodrug of the glutamate modulating agent riluzole. The 
proposed study is based on recent preclinical, clinical and neuroimaging studies that implicate 
glutamatergic hyperactivity in the pathogenesis of GAD[2-8]. Whiletroriluzolehas yet to be 
studied in GAD, studies with riluzole in populations with GADprovide support for the 
therapeutic potential of troriluzole[2-4]. Trials have also suggested the benefit of riluzole in 
individuals with OCD [17, 18].
Riluzole has several modes of action; prominent among them, are a reduction in glutamate 
outflow due to effects on the excitatory amino acid transporters [19]. Given the evidence for 
the potential role of glutamate in GAD, and that troriluzoleis a prodrug of riluzole, it is 
hypothesized that it would be expected to have therapeutic value in GADas a glutamate 
modulatingagent.
Troriluzolewas developed to advance upon the limitations of riluzole that have restricted its 
broader clinical application. Riluzole tablets have 60% bioavailability, attributed to high first-
pass metabolism in the liver. This is thought to be related to metabolism by the 
heterogeneously expressed CYP1A2 enzyme, which is also attributable to the high PK 
variability associated with riluzole. In addition, riluzole is associated with reduced exposure 
when taken with meals (i.e., a negative food effect), resulting in the guidance to take riluzole 
within a three hour fast (one hour before ortwo hours after a meal). Riluzole is also dosed 
twice a day, has dose-dependent effects on liver function tests and the drug substance itself has 
other intrinsic limitations including: very low solubility in water, poor oral palatability, pH 
dependent chemical stability and intense oral numbness if administered directly to the oral 
mucosa.
In an effort to mitigate the aforementioned limitations of riluzole, several classes of prodrugs 
were designed, synthesized, and evaluated in multiple in vitro stability assays to predict in vivo 
drug levels [20]. Troriluzoleis a third generation of prodrug development representing 
multiple years of chemistry effort with optimized in vivo and in vitro features based on stability 
while transiting the digestive system, enhanced gastrointestinal absorption, avoidance of first 
pass metabolism, favorable safety pharmacology, metabolic cleavage in the plasma, and 
enhanced pharmacokinetic properties.
Based on the preclinical features of troriluzole, we anticipate the clinical pharmacology to offer 
favorable properties as compared to available riluzole:
Troriluzoleis expected to have better oralbioavailability;
Troriluzoleis designed to release riluzole after bypassing first-pass metabolism and thus 
confer lower overall drug burden to the liver, which may translate into a better safety and 
tolerability profile as well as reduced pharmacokineticvariability;
Troriluzoleis expected to allow for once daily dosing, thus improvingmedication 
compliance;
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol V03 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 29of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019Troriluzole is expected to be readily absorbed in both the fasting and fed states; thus, the 
prodrug is not anticipated to require any special meal restrictions. In contrast, oral riluzole 
tablets require a 3-hour window of fasting around the two daily doses;

BHV4157-207 is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 2-arm placebo- controlled 
parallel-group study designed to assess safety, tolerability, and efficacy of troriluzolein a 
population of patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorderwho have a Hamilton Anxiety Rating 
Scale (HAM-A) score of 18 or greater at screening and baseline.  Additionally, GAD
year and at least of moderate severity on the 
Clinical Global Impression -Severity of Illness Scaleat study entry.
Qualifying subjects will receive either troriluzole 100 mg BIDor Placebo BID during the 
randomization phase of the trial. Dosing will continue for 8 weeks. Subjects will return to the 
clinic two weeks after discontinuing study medication for a follow-up safety visit. In addition, 
subjects completing the Randomization Phase will be offered approximately 48 weeks of open-
label treatment as long as the investigatorbelieves open-label treatment offers an acceptable 
risk-benefit profile. Subjects who agree to enter the Extension Phase will not complete the 
follow-up safety visit and should continue dosing as specified.
Subjects entering the Extension Phase will have their first Extension Visit four weeks after the 
Week 8 Randomization Phase visit. Thereafter, subjects will undergo visits every four weeks 
up through week 12 of the Extension Phase as outlined in Table 2 (Schedule of 
Assessments/Time & Events-Extension Phase). Subjects will then undergo visits every 12 
weeks up to Week 48 of the Extension phase. All subjects will undergo a termination visit two 
weeks after the last dose of study drug.
Subjects entering the Extension Phase will continue with the same dosetaken at the end of the 
Randomization Phase. 
Subjects will be assessed at clinic visits per the Schedule of Assessments/Time & Events.

Draft Version 03; 01 Aug20194.3.1 Screening Phase
The Screening Phase will range from a minimum of 2 days to a maximum of 35. The purpose of 
the Screening Visit is to ensure that the appropriate subjects are entered into the trial and remain 
stable during the pre-treatment phase. The investigator will determine that the subject meets 
eligibility criteria and will collect demographic and medical data presenting a full characterization 
of the subject. All attempts should be made to obtain medical and pharmacy records to confirm 
the subject ’s medical and medication treatment history. It is estimated approximately372 subjects 
will enter the randomization phase of thetrial.
The SAFER interview will be conducted remotely with the subject by a CRO shortly after 
the screening visit.  A SAFER pass is necessary for the subject to berandomized.
Please refer to the Schedule of Assessments/Time & Events for details on Screening Procedures.
4.3.2 Randomization Phase
Subjects who are determined to be eligible for the study will enter the Randomization Phase. 
Subjects will receive troriluzole(100 mg BID) or placebo (BID)(in a 1:1 ratio).
Dosing will continue for 8 weeks. Subjects will return to the clinic two weeks after discontinuing 
study medication for a follow-up safety visit (unless they are continuing in the Extension Phase).
If subjects have difficulty tolerating BID dosing due to morning dosing of 100 mg (such as 
experiencing sedation) then the investigator may permit the subject to switch to dosing of 200 mg 
at night time only (and document this change in the subject’s records).
Down titration to 100 mg will only be allowed to address tolerability issues and only with medical 
monitor approval. If a subject down titrates they will need to stay on that dose for the duration of 
the Randomization Phase. 
Subjects should take their medication twice a day, doses should be taken in the mornings and 
evenings approximately 12 hours apart.  If tolerability issues arise please refer to Section
9.2.5.
Please refer to the Schedule of Assessments/Time & Events for details on procedures during the 
Randomization Phase. There is a visit window of +/-2 day visit window during the 
Randomization Phase of the study. It is estimated that approximately 372 subjects will enter this 
phase of the trial.
4.3.3 Extension Phase (if applicable)
Subjects completing the Randomization Phase will be offered approximately 48 weeks of open-
label treatment as long as the PI believes open-label treatment offers an acceptable risk-benefit 
profile. 
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol v02 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 40of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019Subjects will have visits in the Extension Phase every four weeks through Week 12 and then 
every 12 weeks thereafterup to Week 48. All subjects will undergo a termination visit two weeks 
after the last dose of study drug.
Subjects entering the Extension phase will continue on the same dose that was taken at the end of 
the Randomization phase.
If subjects have difficulty tolerating BID dosing due to morning dosing of 100 mg (such as 
experiencing sedation) then the investigator may permit thesubject to switch to dosing of 200 mg 
at night time only (and document this change in the subject’s records).
Down titration to 100 mg will only be allowed to address tolerability issues. Subjects may be 
rechallenged to increase to 100mg BID during the Extension Phase at the discreation of the 
investigator.
All visits of the Extension Phase will be open-label.
Please refer to the Schedule of Assessments/Time & Events for details on procedures during the 
Extension Phase. There is a visit window of +/-5 days during the Extension Phaseof the study.

Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019Patients should not undergo any elective medical procedure without prior consultation with the 
Investigator.  An elective procedure (minor surgery, dental surgery, orthopedic surgery etc…) that 
might require hospitalization or anesthesia should be deferred until after the study whenever 
clinically appropriate.
5.5 Woman of Childbearing Potential
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) include any female who has experienced menarche 
and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, 
or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal. Post-menopausal is defined as:
oAmenorrhea greater than or equal to 12 consecutive months without another cause and a 
documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level > 35mIU/mL or;
oWoman with irregular menstrual periods and a documented serumfollicle stimulating 
hormone (FSH) level > 35mIU/mLor;
oNOTE: FSH level testing is not required for women greater than or equal to62 years old 
with amenorrhea of greater than or equal to oneyear;
oWoman on hormone replacement therapy(HRT).
The requisite drug interaction studies to determine the interaction of troriluzolewith oral 
contraceptives have not been completed to date. It is therefore not possible to determine the 
efficacy of oral contraceptives as an effective method of contraception for WOCBP who are 
participating in this study. Oral estrogen and progestin hormonal contraceptives as a sole method 
of contraception are therefore prohibited. It is required that all WOCBP use two methods of 
contraception for the duration of the study (i.e. beginning at 30 days prior to baseline) through 30
days after the last dose of study drug. The two methods should include one barrier method (e.g. 
diaphragm with spermicidal gel, condom with spermicidal gel, intrauterine devices, cervical cap) 
and one other method. The other method could include oral contraceptives (e.g. oral 
contraceptives, injectable contraceptives or contraceptive implant) or another barrier method.
Any male who has a female partner of WOCBP has to avoid becoming pregnant while 
participating in this study. If male subjects are sexually active and not vasectomized for at least 6 
months, and if the subject’s female partner is not surgically sterile or is not post -menopausal, 
then one of the following accepted methods of contraception should be used throughout the study 
and for 90 days after the last study drugadministration:
oSimultaneous use of male condom, and for the female partner, hormonal contraceptives 
(e.g., birth control pills, implants, patch, depot injection, used sinceat least 4 weeks) or 
intra-uterine contraceptive device (placed since at least 4 weeks) before sexual 
intercourse;
oSimultaneous use of male condom, and for the female partner, diaphragmwith 
intravaginally appliedspermicide.

Draft Version 03; 01 Aug20197.4 Safety Assessments
Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by report of adverse events (AE) and by evaluation of 
abnormalities and clinically significant changes in physical examinations, ECGs, vital signs, and 
laboratory tests.
7.4.1 Vital Signs and Physical Measurements (Height and Weight)
Sitting vital sign measurements (temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate) will be recorded 
during the scheduled visits as specified in the Schedule of Assessments/Time & Events and as 
medically necessary.
Body weight and height will be recorded at scheduled visits. The following guidelines will aid in 
the standardization of these measurements:
1. The site should attempt to use the same scale to weigh a given subject throughout thestudy;
2. Scales should be calibrated and zeroed just prior to each subject ’s weigh-in session.
7.4.2 Electrocardiogram (ECG)
A 12-Lead ECG will be recorded during the scheduled visits as specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments/Time & Events and as medically necessary.
7.4.3 Physical Exam
Subjects will undergo a complete physical exam in both the Randomization and Extension Phase 
of the study. The Physical Exam should include at least the following components: HEENT 
(head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat), neck, lymph nodes, lungs, cardiovascular, abdomen, skin, and 
musculoskeletal evaluation by the Principal Investigator or a medically qualified delegate.  If a 
subject is discontinued for any reason, an attempt should be made to conduct a final physical 
exam.
7.4.4 Laboratory Assessments
Laboratorytesting will include the following:
a) Hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, CBC with differential and absolute 
neutrophilcount
b) Serum Chemistry: sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, ALT, AST, LDH, alkaline 
phosphatase, GGT, phosphorous, bicarbonate, CPK, total protein, albumin, total bilirubin 
(if greater than 2 mg/dl bilirubin will be fractionated), glucose, creatinine, BUN, uric acid, 
and pregnancy testing (WOCBP). Additionally, at screening, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, 
triglycerides, folate, HbA1c, TSH, T4, B12, eGFR, P-Amylase, and Lipase;
c) Urinalysis: macroscopic examination, pH, specific gravity, ketones, nitrites, urobilinogen, 
leukocyte esterase, protein, creatinine, glucose, and occult blood will be performed during 
the scheduled visits as specified in the Schedule of Assessments/Time & Events and as 
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol v02 Confidential

Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019medically necessary. If blood, protein, or leukocytes, are positive microscopic 
examination will be performed on abnormalfindings;
d)Serum pregnancy test will be conducted at screening, baseline and all scheduled 
visits.Urine pregnancy tests will be performed prior to dosing at baseline and at 
scheduled visits, at study visits where lab assessments are not performed, or at the 
discretion of theInvestigator. Subjects will be provided with urine pregnancy tests to take 
in between the Week 12, Week 24, Week 36 and Week 48 office visits during the 
Extension Phase;
e) HBsAg, HCV, HIV antibody detection, and RPR (reflex testing will be done for any 
positive RPR)will be performed at screening.
f) Urine Drug Screen for cannabis (medical and recreational), amphetamines (including
MDMA/ecstasy), cocaine, barbiturate, PCP and opiates at screening and EOS visit. Reflex 
confirmatory testing will be conducted on all positive urine drug screen samples.
g) Blood alcohol level.
Any lab value outside of the normal range must be brought to the attention of a physician 
(Investigator or Sub-Investigator) at the site. The Investigator will indicate whether or not a 
flagged value is of clinical significancein the source document. In addition, if warranted repeat 
labs can be drawn.
7.4.4.1 Pharmacokinetics
A pharmacokinetic sample will be collected at Week 2, Week 6, and Week 8 of the
Randomization Phase. Subjects should take their dose at their routine time on the days of these 
visits. Date and time of doses on the day of each visit and the day prior will be collected in case 
report forms along with time of last meal for entry into the eDC system. Subjects who are able to 
schedule a morning visit for Week 2 and Week 6 can be instructed to hold their dose of study 
drug that morning until after a PK trough sample is obtained, if possible and appropriate.
Additionally, PK samples should be drawn if there are any SAEs in either the Randomization or 
Extension Phase of the study that are assessed as possibly drug-related or severe AEs that could 
be drug-related.
7.4.4.2 Pharmacogenetics
A pharmacogenetics blood sample will be obtained at baseline and end of study (Week 8 
Randomization Phase) for possible future exploratory analysis investigating how genetic variation 
may determine troriluzoleefficacy and safety. All subjects will sign a pharmacogenomics ICF 
indicating whether they are consenting to or not consenting to provide a pharmacogenetic blood 
sample. All subjects will be informed that consenting to provide a blood sample for 
pharmacogenetic analysis is optional and does not affect participation in the study.
DNA samples will be stored indefinitely from subjects who have provided written informed 
consent unless a written request for destruction of the sample is provided by the subject to the site 
which conducted the Biohaven-sponsored clinical trial. This written request provided by the 
subject requesting destruction of the subject’s pharmacogenetic samples should be provided by 
the site to the sponsor.

Draft Version 03; 01 Aug20197.4.4.3 Pregnancy Testing
Pregnancy testing should be performed on all women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) during 
both the Randomization Phase and Extension Phase of the study. Refer to the Schedule of 
Assessments/Time & Events for detailed time points in which serum pregnancy tests and urine 
pregnancy tests are required. Urine pregnancy testing may also be done at the discretion of the 
Investigator at any time during the study. Subjects should not continue in the study if the 
pregnancy test is positive at any time.
7.4.4.4 Evaluation of Laboratory Assessments
The management of abnormal LFTs are described herein. Scheduled LFTs (ALT, AST, bilirubin, 
alkaline phosphatase) at Week 4 and through Week 48 visits (see Schedule of Assessments for 
details) will be evaluated by a physician or other qualified medical personnel.
If AST or ALT values are between 3x ULN and <5x ULN, the Investigator will medically 
evaluate the subject. Medical assessment of the subject can include the following:
Must include repeat LFT assessments (ALT, AST, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline
phosphatase, PT, aPTT, INR) within 1 week and follow until resolution. The frequencyof the 
repeat tests will be clinically based on trajectory of change (e.g., improving, stable vs 
increasing). These tests can be performed either at a local, or preferably, central lab
Assessment of AEs, usage of concomitant medications, exposure to potential hepatictoxins, 
risk factors for hepatitis or alcoholic liver disease
Based on overall clinical presentation (severity and extent of lab abnormalities; rate ofchange 
of lab values), additional evaluations (as outlined under the scenario of ALT/AST > 5xULN) 
may be considered.
If any visit shows ALT or AST>5x ULN, the Investigator will assess this as a potential SAE. The 
subject will be managed as appropriate, including:
Study medication must be discontinued immediately
Bring subject in for physical exam and evaluation.
oAssess for right heart failure, hypotension, and signs/symptoms of alcohol abuse
oAssess for exposure to toxic dietary/herbal supplements and/or prescriptions drugs that are 
associated with hepatic effects, such as acetaminophen;
oAssess for potential exposure to environmental toxins
oEvaluate for abdominal pain, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol v02 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 55of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019Repeat LFTs (AST, ALT, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase) as soon as possible, 
with either a local lab or preferably central lab; and, follow to resolution;
Order other labs tests to rule-out other causes of lab abnormalities and to assess extent of 
hepatic effects
ocoagulation factors (PT, aPTT, INR)
oHepatitis A, B and C serologies
oEpstein-Barr virus serology
Assess AEs
Consider gall bladder or ductal imaging studies if presentation suggests potential for gall 
stones.
Entry into the Extension Phase requires continued impression that open-label treatment offers an 
acceptable risk-benefit profile. If lab abnormalities in the Randomization Phase arepotentially 
clinically significant then treatment with study drug in the Extension Phase should not begin until 
such labs near normal limits or in the case of elevated transaminases (ALT orAST) are within 3x 
ULN. If results from the scheduled Week 8 assessment show emergence of potentially clinically 
significant lab abnormalities and the subject has already started open-label troriluzole, then labs 
must be repeated and the investigator, based on clinical impression concerning thenature and 
severity of results, may decide to continue troriluzole. In the case of AST orALT > 5 x ULN, re-
challenge with study drug will not be allowed.
7.4.5 Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale (Sheehan STS)
The Sheehan STS (S-STS) is a prospective, clinician administered ratingscale that contains 16 
questions to track both treatment-emergent suicidal ideation and behaviors[21, 22]. The S-STS 
will be completed on a paper form at the site. At the screening visit, the recall period for 
completing the S-STS is 6 months prior; at all other visits, the recall period for completing the S-
STS is since the last visit. Subjects who have a S-STS score > 0 should be evaluated by the 
investigator.  If the investigator determines that a subject is at risk of suicide or self-harm, 
appropriate measures to ensure the subject’s safety and obtain mental health evaluation must be 
implemented. The subject must immediately be discontinued from the study. The event should be 
recorded as either an AE or SAE as determined by the investigator and reported within 24 hours 
to the Sponsor.
7.5 Clinical Outcome Assessments
Training will be provided for all clinical outcome assessments through either didactic, video 
certification, and/or online training.  
The order of the tests should include the administration of the HAM-Aprior to other clinical / 
safety outcome assessments, followed by the other clinical outcome assessments.

Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 56of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug20197.5.1 Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)
The HAM-Ais a clinician-administered scale used extensively in research and clinical practice to 
both rate severity of GADand to monitor improvement during treatment. It is designed to rate the 
severity of anxietyas well as thetype of symptoms in patients with GAD. The HAM-A will be 
utilized as the primary efficacy assessment of the pati ent’s level of anxiety and must be 
administered utilizing a structured interview guide, the Structured Interview Guide for the 
Hamilton Anxiety Scale (SIGH-A)[23].
The scale consists of 14 items. Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe) with 
a total score range of 0-56.  Subscale scores can be calculated for psychicanxiety factor (sum of 
HAM-A items anxious mood, tension, fears, insomnia, concentration, depressed mood, and 
behavior at interview), and somatic anxietyfactor (sum of HAM-A items somatic muscular, 
somatic sensory, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary and autonomic 
symptoms).
Raters must be trained and pre-approved by sponsor or sponsor representative (i.e. CRO) to rate 
subjects on the HAM-A. Raters must complete training and receive their certification prior to 
administering the HAM-Ato study subjects. 
7.5.2 Placebo-Control Reminder Script (PCRS)
The Placebo-Control Reminder Script (PCRS)is a statement read by a clinician to a subject prior 
to every administration of the HAM-Athroughout the study. It is intended to provide a 
standardized method for educating subjects on what it means to be in a placebo-controlled study, 
expectations regarding clinical benefit, and how to interact with study staff, to minimizing the 
placebo effect.
7.5.3 Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)
The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) is a patient-rated measure of functional disability in domains 
of work, social and family life. The SDS has demonstrated sensitivity to treatment effects in 
numerous randomized controlled trials in populations with varied diagnoses (70).  The assessment 
is a three item questionnaire measuringdisease-related disruption of work, social life and family 
life.  Respondents evaluate impairment on an 11 point scale from 0 -10 with anchor definitions. 
The 3 items can also be summed into a single dimensional measure of global functional 
impairment that rages from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired).
Subjects may indicate that item 1 of the SDS (Work/School) is not applicable to them by 
checking a box labeled “ I have not worked / studied at all during the past week for reasons 
unrelated to the disorder. ” For these subjects item 1 of the SDS is not scored. Ho wever, subjects 
that were unable to work or study due to reasons related to thedisorder must complete item 1.
If a subject checks the “not working” box for the Work/School item, you MUST check 
compliance to this instruction, before the visit ends.

Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 57of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug20197.5.4 Clinical Global Impression (CGI)
Subjects will be rated on the seven-point Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and Global 
Improvement (CGI-I) scales of the CGI.  The CGI-S is rated during the screening phase as a 
screening assessment to determine eligibility for entry into the study.  
A Sponsor approved rater, preferably a psychiatrist, should administer the CGI.  All efforts 
should be made to ensure that the same clinician administers the CGI-S and CGI-I for a 
given patient.  Notation in the subject’s study records should substantiate the CGI ratings.
7.5.5 Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17 Item Version (HAM-D-17)
The HAM-D 17 score, derived from the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression 
Rating Scale (SIGH-D) will be used as a secondary assessment of the patient’s level of 
depression.  
Although theHAM-Dconsists of  21 items, thescoringis based on the first 17. Eight items 
arescored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 = not present to 4 = severe. Nine arescored from 0-
2.
7.5.6 Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ)
The Penn State Worry Questionnaire(PSWQ) is a self-administered, 16-item, Likert-type scale 
designed to measure worry. Possible range ofscores is 16-80.  Each item is scored 1-5.  Items 1, 
3, 8, 10 and 11 are reversed scored.
7.5.7 Cognitive Test Battery
The Cognitive Test Battery will consist of the Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST) and the 
Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R).
The DSST requires that subjects fill in a series of symbols correctly coded withing 2 minutes.
The higher the score the better the performance.  
TheHopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R)is one test with a set of six forms intended 
to measure verbal learning and memory in individuals ages 16 and older. The six forms of the 
HVLT-R are designed to allow frequent, rapid retesting. Each test includes a list of 12 nouns; the 
examiner reads the list to the examinee, who repeats as many words as remembered, in any order. 
This process is repeated three times; 20-25 minutes later, examinees are asked again to recall as 
many words as possible; for the final task, the examiner reads a list of 24 words (including the 12 
words from the list) and asks the examinee after each whether the word was on the list [24].
7.5.8 Clinical Trial and Site Scale-B (CTSS-B)
The Clinical Trial and Site Scale-B (CTSS-B) is a scale to assess potential domains associated 
with placebo response.  Thescale is a patient reported assessment and consists of 26 items.   
Items 1-24 are rated on a scale from 1 (“Completely Disagree”) to 9 (“Completely Agree”).  
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol v02 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 58of 80

CTSS-Bis a modified version of an assessment developed by Feltner et al. [25].
8 EARLY DISCONTNUATION OF STUDY
All subjects who discontinue study treatment early should complete the 2-Week Post Dose Visit. 
The only exception to this requirement is when a subject withdraws consent for all study 
procedures or loses the ability to consent freely (i.e. is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated 
for the treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness).
9 STUDY DRUG MANAGEMENT
9.1 Description of StudyDrug
9.1.1 Investigational Product
An investigational product, also known as investigational medicinal product in some regions, is 
defined as follows:
A pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a 
clinical study, including products already with a marketing authorization but used or assembled 
(formulated or packaged) in a way different from the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized 
indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form.
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area according to the local regulations. It 
is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that the investigational product is only dispensed 
to study patients. The investigational product must be dispensed only from official study sites by 
authorized personnel according to local regulations.
In this protocol, the investigational products are: troriluzolecapsules 100 mg and matching 
placebo.
9.1.2 Packaging, Shipment and Storage
Clinical Trial Materials should be stored at controlled temperature between 200C and 250 C (680F
-770F), with excursions permitted between 150C and 300 C (590F-860F), in a secure, temperature 
controlled, limited access area. Themedications will be stored in a locked, environmentally-
controlled medication room with restricted access. Container(s) will bear a label containing at 
least the name of the study drug, lot and/or batch numberand storage conditions.
9.2 Dose andAdministration
9.2.1 Randomization Phase
During the randomization phase, all subjects will be randomized to receive troriluzole 100 mg 
BID or placebo BID.
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol v02 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 59of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019It is recommended that all patients ingest study drugtwice per day (BID)once in the morning and 
once in the evening (approximately 12 hours apart).  Study drug can be taken without regard to 
meals. 
If subjects have difficulty tolerating BID dosingdue to morning dosing of 100 mg (such as 
experiencing sedation) then the investigator may permit the subject to switch to dosing of 200 mg 
at night time only (and document this change in the subject’s records).
Down titration to 100 mg will only be allowed to address tolerability issues and only with medical 
monitor approval. If a subject down titrates they will need to stay on that dose for the duration of 
the Randomization Phase. 
9.2.2 Extension Phase
Subjects completing the Randomization Phase will be offered approximately 48 weeks of 
troriluzoletreatment as long as the PI believes open-label treatment offers an acceptable risk-
benefit profile. Subjects who agree to enter the Extension Phase will receive open-label 
troriluzole. Subjects entering the Extension phase will continue on the same dose that was taken 
at the end of the Randomization phase. Subjects will continue to ingest study drug twice per day 
(BID)once in the morning and once in the evening (approximately 12 hours apart).  Study drug 
can be taken without regard to meals.
If subjects have difficulty tolerating BID dosing due to morning dosing of 100 mg (such as 
experiencing sedation) then the investigator may permit the subject to switch to dosing of 200 mg 
at night time only (and document this change in the subject’s records).
Down titration to 100 mg will only be allowed to address tolerability issues. Subjects may be 
rechallenged to increase to 100mg BID during the Extension Phase at the discreation of the 
investigator.
All visits of the Extension Phase will be open-label.
9.2.3 Method of Assigning Patient Identification
The investigator or designee will need to access an Interactive Web-based Response System 
(IWRS) in order to register each subject in each study phase. Initially the investigator or designee 
will enter the subject into the study at the Screening Visit after informed consent is obtained and a 
subject number is assigned. After completion of all screening evaluations, all eligible subjects 
will be randomized via IWRS at the Baseline Visit, in a 1:1 ratio to receive either placebo (BID)
or troriluzole(100 mg BID). Treatment assignments will be obtained by the investigator (or 
designee) via the IWRS system.
Investigational sites will access the IWRS at each scheduled IP dispensing visit throughout the 
Randomization Phaseto dispense drug. The IWRS system will assign specific bottlenumbers for 
all blinded study drug to be dispensed to the subject. Once a bottlehas been assigned it cannot be 
dispensed to another study subject.
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol v02 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 60of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019Once a subject completes the Randomization Phase or if a subject is discontinued early from the 
study, the investigator or designee must access the IWRS to discontinue the patient from 
participation in the studyor to indicate that the subject will continue into the Extension Phase.
Subjects who complete 8 weeks of treatment in the Randomization Phase may be eligible for an 
Extension Phase of the study. The investigator or designee must access the IWRS to enter the 
subject in the Extension Phase. Investigational sites will access the IWRS at each IP dispensing
visit throughout the Extension Phaseto dispense drug.
Study medication will be assigned via the IWRS system in the Randomization and Extension 
Phase. Sites will be responsible for recording the bottle numbers dispensed to the subject on the 
Drug Accountability Form provided in the Regulatory Binder, as well as ensure appropriate 
documentation of dispensation in the subject’s medical record. Once a subject completes the 
Extension Phase or if a subject is discontinued early from the Extension Phase of the study, the 
investigator or designee must access the IWRS to document the discontinuation of the subject 
from participation in the study.
9.2.4 Selection and Timing of Dose and Administration
During the randomization phase of the study, subjects will be randomized to receive placebo 
(BID) or troriluzole(100 mg BID). Open label BHV-4157 will be provided during the extension 
phase. Study Drug will be dispensed at the baseline visit. Subjects should take the first dose the 
day after the baseline visit.  Study medication should be administered twice per day (BID) once in 
the morning and once in the evening (approximately 12 hours apart).
9.2.5 Dose Modifications
Randomization Phase:  Subjects will receive 100 mgBID or Placebo BID for eight (8) weeks.
If subjects have difficulty tolerating 100 mg BID dosing (such as experiencing sedation) then the 
investigator may permit the subject to switch to dosing of 200 mg at night time or morning only 
(and document this change in the subject’s records).
Down titration to 100 mg once daily (QD) will only be allowed to address tolerability issues and 
only with medical monitor approval. If a subject down titrates to 100 mg QD they will need to 
stay on that dose for the duration of the Randomization Phase.
Extension Phase: Subjects entering the Extension phase will continue on the same dose that was 
taken at the end of the Randomization phase. Subjects receiving placebo in the randomization 
phase will be switched in a blinded manner to 100 mg BID or 100 mg QD.  Subjects who enter 
the Extension Phase on 100 mg QD due to tolerability issues can be rechallenged to increase to 
100 mg BID based on investigator judgement.
For subjects who do not tolerate their study treatment the investigator may permit them to switch 
to night time dosing(200 mg QD at night)if there is reason to believe that may help tolerability. 
Any such changes must be documented by the investigator.  If the subject is receiving 100 mg QD
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol v02 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 61of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019and this switch in dosing time does not result in acceptable tolerability then dosing should be 
discontinued. 
9.3 Blinding and Unblinding
Blinding is critical to the integrity of this clinical study. However, in the event of a medical 
emergency or pregnancy in an individual subject, in which knowledge of the investigational 
product is critical to the subjec t’s management, the blind for that patient may be broken by the 
treating physician.
Before breaking the blind of an individual subject ’s treatment, the investigator should have 
determined that the information is necessary, i.e., that it will alter the subject ’s immediate 
management. In many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not investigational 
product related, the problem may be properly managed by assuming that the subject is receiving 
active product without the need for unblinding. Unblinding will be managed via the IWRS 
system.
A pharmacokineticist, IWRS vendor, and pharmacovigilance rolemay be unblinded before data 
areunblinded for the primary endpoint and all subjects complete the Randomized Phaseof the 
study. Except as noted above, other members of the BHV research team will remain blinded. For 
purposes of the DMC, periodic analysis will be carried out by the unblinded safety biostatistics 
team independent and firewalled from the team directly involved with the design and primary 
analysis of the trial.  Areport will be prepared for the DMC as outlined in the DMC charter.
In cases of accidental unblinding, contact the Medical Monitor and ensure every attempt to 
preserve the blind is made.
9.4 Treatment Compliance
Responsible study personnel will dispense the study drug. Accountability and compliance 
verification should be documented in the subject ’s study records.
Subjects will be counseled on the importance of taking the study drug as directed at all study 
visits. If poor compliance continues, (i.e., multiple missed doses resulting in less than 80% overall 
compliance during the Randomization and Extension Phase), discontinuation of the subject from 
the trial should be considered and discussed with the Sponsor.
9.5 Destruction and Return of Study Drug
All unused and/or partially used study drug can be sent back to the drug depot for destruction 
onlyafter being inspected and reconcile d by the responsible BHV Study monitor or the sponsor’s 
designee.
If it is site policy to destroystudy drug on site, it is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that 
arrangements have been made for the disposal, procedures for proper disposal have been 
established according to the applicable regulations, guidelines and institutional procedures, and 
appropriate records of the disposal have been documented. The unused study drugs can only be

10 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
pre-existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation patient administered an 
investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding for example) symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use 
of the investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product.
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during an open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a patient. In order to prevent reporting bias, patients should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs. The collection of non-serious 
AE information should begin at the initiation of study drug.
10.1 Serious Adverse Events
There are two types of adverse events, Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and Non-Serious Adverse 
Events (AEs).
10.1.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
A SAE is any event that meets any of the following criteria at any dose:
Death;
Life-threatening;
Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existinghospitalization;
Persistent or significantdisability/incapacity;
Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who receivedtroriluzole;
Other: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening,or require 
hospitalization, may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events are (but not limitedto):
oIntensive treatment in an emergency room or at home forallergic bronchospasm;
oBlood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization;
oDevelopment of drug dependency or drugabuse;
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol v02 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 63of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019oPotential drug induced liver injury (see section 10.1.7).
10.1.2 Definition of Terms
Mild: Is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic
intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living.
Moderate: Is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The event 
interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or 
permanent risk of harm to the subject.
Severe: Interrupts usual activities of daily living, significantly affects clinical status, or may 
require intensive therapeutic intervention.
Life threatening: An AE is life threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred; i.e., it does not include a reaction that if it had occurred in a more serious 
form might have caused death. For example, drug induced hepatitis that resolved without 
evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life threatening even though drug induced 
hepatitis can be fatal.
Hospitalization: AEs requiring hospitalization should be considered SAEs. Hospitalization for 
elective surgery or routine clinical procedures that are not the result of an AE (e.g., elective 
surgery for a pre-existing condition that has not worsened) need not be considered AEs or SAEs. 
If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, that occurrence must be reported as an AE, 
either 'serious' or 'non-serious' according to the usual criteria.
In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving at least 
an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would 
not have been appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting. When in doubt as to 
whether 'hospitalization' occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.
The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs in BHV clinical studies (but may be 
considered non-serious AEs):
A visit to the emergency room or other hospital department <24 hours that does not result in 
an admission (unless considered “important medical event” or event that is life threatening);
Elective surgery, planned prior to signingconsent;
Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgicalprocedure;
Routine health assessment requiring admission (i.e., routinecolonoscopy);
Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing onhealth and 
requires no medical intervention (i.e., lack of housing, care-giver respite, family 
circumstances).
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol v02 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 64of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019Disability/incapacitating: An AE is incapacitating or disabling if the experience results in a 
substantial and/or permanent disruption of the subject's ability to carry out normal life functions. 
10.1.3 Classification of Adverse Events
The severity of all AEs must be recorded in the eCRF and on the SAE Form, if applicable. The 
severity or intensit y of an AE refers to the extent to which it affects the subject’s daily activities. 
The severity of events should be graded as mild, moderate or severe.  
The Investigator’s assessment of an AEs relationship to study drug is part of the documentation 
process but is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there is any 
doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. The relationship 
or association of the study drug in causing or contributing to the AE will be characterized as 
either not related or related. 
10.1.4 Collection and Reporting Serious Adverse Events
Following the patient’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or 
not related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with 
protocol-specific procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period 
and within 30 days of discontinuation of dosing. The investigator should report any SAE 
occurring after these time periods that is believed to be related to study drug or protocol-specific 
procedures.  
An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its status of 
seriousness.  
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to the study drug, but is potentially related 
to the conditions of the study (such as a withdrawal of previous therapy or a complication related 
to study procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE 
Report Form.  
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, overdose, potential drug induced liver injury 
and pregnancies must be reported within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the 
event. For this study we will be capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC) and on the 
SAE form.  
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all SAEs and all Other Important Medical Events 
to  immediately via telephone, upon observing or learning of the event.  will then 
immediately notify the Biohaven Medical Monitor of the event.  The SAE form must then be 
submitted to  within one working day. The Investigator is responsible for submitting all 
applicable events to the Independent Review Board (IRB) as per the IRB’s reporting 
requirements. Additionally, the Investigator, or designated staff, is responsible for enteringthe 
SAE information in the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system (i.e.: event term, start stop dates, 
causality, severity).  CCI CCI
CCI
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol v02 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 65of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019Additionally, any serious adverse experience must be reported immediately or no later than 24 
hoursafter awareness of the event to the  department. 
The Serious Adverse Event Report Form (SAERF) should be submitted to  by facsimile 
(FAX). 
Reports can be made by telephone via the Safety Hotline Number below if a SAERF cannot be 
immediately submitted.
For any questions relating to SAEs, please contact the Medical Monitor via telephone:
SAE Telephone Contact: Dr. 
If only limited information is initially available, follow-up reports are required. If an ongoing 
SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information becomes 
available, a follow-up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming 
aware of the updated information using the same procedure used for the transmission of the initial 
SAE and the same event term should be used.  
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
10.1.5 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of the product 
that is considered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of overdose 
(suspected or confirmed and irrespective of whether or not it involved troriluzole) must be 
communicated to Biohaven or a specified designee within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming 
aware of the updated information and be fully documented as an SAE. Details of any signs or 
symptoms and their management should be recorded including details of any antidote(s) 
administered.
10.1.6 Pregnancy
If following initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequently discovered that a study 
patient is pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of the investigational product exposure, 
including during at least 6 half-lives after the product administration, the investigational product 
will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (i.e., dose tapering if necessary for 
patient safety). Protocol-required procedures for the study will be discontinued and the follow up 
must be performed on the patient unless contraindicated by the pregnancy (i.e., x-ray studies). 
Other appropriate pregnancy follow-up procedures should be considered if indicated. 
Sites should instruct patients to contact the investigator if they become pregnant during the course 
of the study. The investigator must immediately notify  of the event within 24 hours of the 
Investigator becoming aware of the information. The site must complete a Pregnancy Report CCICCICCI

neonatal outcome and, where applicable offspring information must also be reported on a 
Pregnancy Report Form.
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant should be reported to 
10.1.7 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of the initial liver-related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs as per Section 10.1.4.
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as:
Aminotransferases (AT) (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN);
  AND
Total bilirubin (TBL) > 2 times ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis(elevated serum 
alkaline phosphatase); 
AND
No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
If any potential DILI is identified and meets the criteria above, the Biohaven Medical Monitor 
should immediately be contacted for further instruction on dosing adjustments and whether the 
patient must discontinue from the trial and appropriate follow up requirements. 
10.2 Non-serious Adverse Events
A non-serious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
10.2.1 Collection and Reporting of Non-Serious Adverse Events
The collection of non-serious AE information should begin at the initiation of study drug.
Non-serious adverse events should be followed until conclusion or stabilization, or reported as 
SAEs if they become serious. Follow-up is also required for non-serious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study drug or those that are present at the end of study 
treatment.
The following laboratory test abnormalities should be captured on the non-serious AE CRF page 
or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate: 
Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition ofan SAE;CCI

11 STATISTICS
Detailed plans for analysis will be summarized in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan document, 
to be written and approved prior to database unblinding. A summary of statistical aspects of the 
design and intended analysis is provided here
11.1 General Procedures
Categorical variables are tabulated with counts and percentages. Continuous variables are 
summarized with univariate statistics (e.g., n, mean, standard error, median, minimum and 
maximum).  
For the calculation of descriptive statistics of observed data, subjects must have a baseline value 
to be evaluable for endpoints based on values and changes from baseline over time.
Tabulations of the following endpoints present the number of unique subjects with an event: 
protocol deviations; non-study medications; adverse events; and laboratory abnormalities. Thus, 
for these endpoints, multiple occurrences of the same event are counted only once per subject.
Unless otherwise specified, the randomization phase and the open-label extension phase will be 
analyzed separately. For subjects receiving troriluzoleduring both phases, summary statistics will 
be provided for data from both phases combined.
11.2 Sample Size
The sample size for this study will be approximately 372 randomized subjects.
From a review of generalized anxiety disorder by Hidalgo[26], data from 7 adult studies 
(treatment duration between 4 to 12 weeks) provided the standard deviation for change from 
baseline ranging from 6.0 to 8.7; the average standard deviation was 7.4. 
With an expected Week 8 difference between treatment groups to be 2.5 points on the HAM-A
total scale, 372 subjects provide 90% power based on a 2-sample t-test with a common standard 
deviation of 7.4. The previous is based on an assumption of no premature discontinuations, if 
premature discontinuations occur at a rate of up to 25%, the power to detect a 2.5 point difference 
may be as low as 80%.
11.3 Populations for Analysis
The following analysis sets are defined for this protocol:
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol v02 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 68of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019oEnrolled subjects: Patients who signed an informed consent form and were assigned a 
Patient Identification number (PID)
oRandomized subjects: Enrolled subjects who received a treatment assignment from the 
Interactive Web Response System (IWRS).
oTreated subjects: Enrolled subjects who received at least 1 dose of blinded study therapy 
(troriluzoleor placebo) or open-label troriluzole.
oModified Intent to Treat (mITT) subjects: Randomized subjects that received at least one 
dose of blinded study therapy and provided at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment 
during the randomization phase
11.4 Statistical Methods
11.4.1 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
Tabulations of demographic and baseline characteristics will be made for all treated subjects. A 
separate set of tabulations will be made for subjects enrolled but not randomized.
Demographic information will be summarized descriptively by treatment group and overall (i.e., 
treatment groups combined).
11.4.2 Primary Endpoint(s)
As the primary objective of this study is based on the evaluation of severity of patients’ 
symptomology, the estimand for the primary endpoint will be the effect due to the initially 
randomized treatments if taken as directed, a de jure efficacy estimand.  The target population 
will be the mITT population. The primary endpoint will be the change from baseline in the HAM-
A score, troriluzolerelative to placebo, at Week 8 of the randomization phase. This treatment 
effect will be summarized as the difference in change from baseline in the HAM-A between the 
groups receiving troriluzoleand placebo. 
Since the primary intent of this trial is to evaluate the effect of the drug when taken as intended in 
the protocol, a hypothetical strategy will be employed for the intercurrent event of treatment/study 
discontinuation (due to any reason). Specifically, the assumption will be that had the subjects not 
discontinued, their efficacy would have been similar to the efficacy of subjects from the same 
treatment group who did not discontinue. For other intercurrent events that do not cause 
treatment/study discontinuation such as modest treatment non-compliance, protocol allowed dose 
adjustments, or initiation or adjustment of concomitant medications related to other symptoms all 
observed values will be used.
The change from baseline in the HAM-A score, will be analyzed using Mixed Model for 
Repeated Measures (MMRM).  The model will include treatment, visit and the treatment-by-visit 
interaction as fixed effects, and the baseline value of the HAM-A and baseline Ham-A by visit 
interaction as covariates. The covariance structure will be initially specified as unstructured.  If 
the model fails to converge, then a Huynh-Feldt structure may beused, followed by an AR(1) 
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol v02 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 69of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019structure. The troriluzoleand placebo groups will be compared at the end of the double-blind 
phase using a single degree of freedom contrast, with Kenwood-Rogers degrees of freedom, and 
significance assessed at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05.  Sensitivity analyses will include, but not 
limited to a multiple imputation method employing a jump to reference method. Details of these 
analyses are provided in the statistical analysis plan.
Additional analyses on the HAM-A Scale will included analysis of the change from baseline 
Psychic Anxiety and Somatic Anxiety subscales as well as analyses of the percentage of HAM-A
responders and remitters.  Response is defined a a 50% or greater reduction in the HAM-A Total 
Score from baseline to endpoint.  Remission is defined as a HAM-A Total Score <= 7 at Weeks 6
and 8. Details of these analyses are provided in the statistical analysis plan.
11.4.3 Secondary and Exploratory Endpoint(s)
Continuous change-from-baseline efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the same 
methodology as the primary endpoint.  Further details on the secondary and exploratory analyses 
are provided in the SAP.
11.4.4 Adjustment for Multiplicity
Type 1 error will be controlled for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints by testing them 
with a gate-keeping procedure. The primary endpoint will be tested at a two-sided alpha level of 
0.05. If this test is significant, then the secondary efficacyendpoints will be tested using 
Hochberg’s procedure.  If the test of the primary endpoint is not significant, then the unadjusted 
p-values for the secondary endpoints will be presented only for descriptive purposes, and no 
conclusions will be drawn from this result
No attempt will be made to adjust for multiplicity when testing the exploratory endpoints. Any 
exploratory endpoints subjected to significance testing are evaluated at an unadjusted two-sided 
alpha level of 0.05.
11.4.5 Missing Data
Studies similar to the randomized phase of this study showed ~25% of the subjects fail to 
complete the blinded randomized portion of the study[27][28]. Hence, we expect a similar rate of 
discontinuation during the randomized phase of this study. As part of sensitivity analyses for the 
primary and secondary endpoints, the missing data will be multiply imputed for the primary 
endpoint using reference methods (e.g. jump to reference). Further details on the handling of 
missing data, including for the SDS, are provided in the statistical analysis plan.
11.4.6 Analysis of Safety
The investigators determine the intensity of AEs and the relationship of AEs to study therapy. The 
investigators’ terms are coded and grouped by system organ class using the latest version of the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) available. AEs will be presented by 
system organ class and preferred term, ordered by the overall frequency of events.  If a subject 
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol v02 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 70of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019had an adverse event with different intensities over time, then only the greatest intensity is 
reported in a study phase.
The frequencies of the following safety events are summarized by treatment group and overall for 
treated subjects:  SAEs; all AEs, non-serious AEs; AEs by intensity; AEs by relatedness and 
clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities.
Graphical and tabular displays of on-treatment liver function test results are provided
11.5 Schedule of Analyses
This study will be monitored by a Data Safety Monitoring Board which will review interim 
summaries of the data during the trial. Please see section 12.1 for details.
An initial analysis of the data will be conducted after the last subject completes their Week 8 visit.  
This will only include analyses of efficacy data from the double-blind phase of the study, 
however safety analyses will include data from double-blind as well as the extension phase.
A final analysis of the study will be completed after the last subject completes their last study 
visit. This will summarize all efficacy data collected in the open-label phase, and summarize all 
safety, laboratory and other data collected through the entire study.
Additional analyses may be conducted during the open-label phase of the study to support 
regulatory and administrative requirements. 
12 ETHICS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), 
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and all applicable regulations, including the Federal Food, Drug 
and Cosmetic Act, U.S. applicable Code of Federal Regulations (title 21), any IEC requirements 
relative to clinical studies. The study will also be conducted in compliance with the 
recommendations laid down in the most recent version of the Declaration of Helsinki, with the 
exception that registration of such Phase 1 trials in a publicly accessible database is not 
mandatory.
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol. The protocol and any amendments 
and the patient informed consent will receive Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IRB/IEC) approval/favorable opinion prior to initiation of the study.
All serious breaches must be reported to Biohaven (or designee) immediately. A Serious breach is 
a breach of the conditions and principles of GCP in connection with the study or protocol, which 
is likely to affect, to a significant degree, the safety or physical or mental integrity of the patients 
of the study or the scientific value of the study.
Study personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by education, training, and 
experience to perform their respective task(s).
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol v02 Confidential

Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019This study will not use the services of study personnel where sanctions have been invoked or 
where there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (e.g., loss of medical licensure, debarment).
12.1 Data Monitoring Committee
An independent Data Monitoring Committee(DMC) will be utilized for this study. The DMC 
will reviewthe safety of all patients enrolled in trials on an regularbasis. 
The DMC will review the protocol, and will identify the data parameters and format of the 
information to be regularly reported.  The DMC will meet in person or by conference call 
approximately quarterly. The DMC will typically receive reports with data by treatment group 
(e.g. blinded group A, group B etc.) or, if requested by the DMC, completely unblinded. 
Based on the review of safety data, the DMC will make recommendations regarding the conduct 
of the study to the clinical team. These may include continuing the study as designed, amending 
safety monitoring procedures, modifying the protocol or theinformed consent form, or 
recommending the termination of the study.  
For purposes of the DMC, dataanalysis will be carried out by the unblinded safety biostatistics 
team independent and firewalled from the team directly involved witht the study design and 
primary analyses, and a report will be prepared for the DMC.
For further details please refer to the DMC charter.
12.2 Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee
The Investigators agree to provide the IEC with all appropriate documents, including a copy of 
the protocol/amendments, ICFs, advertising text (if any), Investigator’s brochure (if any) and any 
other written information provided to study subjects. The trial will not begin until the 
Investigators have obtained the IEC favorable written approvals for the above-mentioned study 
documents. A properly executed written ICF shall be read, signed, and dated by each subject prior 
to entering the trial or prior to performing any study procedure. The original signed and dated ICF 
will be kept at the Investigator site and a copy will be given to the subject.
In the event that the protocol is amended, the revised protocol must be approved by the IEC prior 
to its implementation, unless the changes involve only logistical or administrative aspects of the
trial. If a revised ICF is introduced during the study, each subject’s further consent must be 
obtained. The new version of the ICF must be approved by the IEC, prior to subsequently 
obtaining each subject’s consent.
The Principal investigator and the Sp onsor’s representative must sign the protocol and its 
amendments (if any) before initiating the study.
It is the Sponsor’s responsibility to submit the protocol and its amendments (if any), and the ICFs 
to regulatory authorities when necessary.
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol v02 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 72of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug201912.3 Informed Consent
Investigators must ensure that patients, or, in those situations where consent cannot be given by 
patients, their legally acceptable representatives, are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, 
potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they volunteer to 
participate.
Biohaven (or designee) will provide the investigator with an appropriate (i.e., Global or Local) 
sample informed consent form which will include all elements required byICH, GCP and 
applicable regulatory requirements. The sample informed consent form will adhere to the ethical 
principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Before the potential subject has undergone any study-related screening procedures, the nature of 
thestudy and the potential risks associated with it will be explained to the subject, and the subject 
will be given an opportunity to ask questions to his or her satisfaction. After the questions are 
answered, but before proceeding further, the subject must read and sign a written informed 
consent form. This signed informed consent form will be reviewed and approved by an IRB/IEC, 
revisions to the protocol and informed consent form will be reviewed and approved by the 
IRB/IEC, a copy retained in the Study Master File, and the date and time the subject signed the 
form will be entered in his or her CRF. The subject will be provided with a copy of his or her 
signed and dated informed consentform.
If informed consent is initially given by a patient’s legal guardi an or legally acceptable 
representative, and the patient subsequently becomes capable of making and communicating their 
informed consent during the study, then the consent must additionally be obtained from the 
patient.
The informed consent form must also include a statement that Biohaven and its representatives 
and regulatory authorities may have direct access to patient records.
The rights, safety, and well-being of study patients are the most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.
A separate ICF will be obtained for the collection of blood for pharmacogenetic samples for 
possible future exploratory analysis investigating how genetic variation may determine troriluzole
efficacy and safety. All subjects will sign a pharmacogenomics ICF indicating whether they are 
consenting to or not consenting to provide a pharmacogenetic blood sample. All subjects will be 
informed that consenting to provide a blood sample for pharmacogenetic analysis is optional and 
does not affe ct participation in the study. The investigator or the investigator’s designee is 
responsible for verifying the patient’s consent prior to obtaining the pharmacogenetic blood 
sample.
The approval of the pharmacogenetic ICF may occur separately from the consent form for other 
study related procedures and assessments. In instances were IRB approval for pharmacogenetics 
samples is not obtained, samples for genetic analysis will not be collected.
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol v02 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 73of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019DNA samples will be stored indefinitely from subjects who have provided written informed 
consent unless a written request for destruction of the sample is provided by the subject to the site 
which conducted the Biohaven-sponsored clinical trial. This written request provided by the 
subject to the site requesting destruc tion of the subject’s pharmacogenetic samples should be 
provided by the site to the sponsor.
12.4 Case Report Forms
An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed 
to record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation of each study patient. Data 
reported on the CRF that are derived from source documents must be consistent with the source 
documents or the discrepancies must be explained.
Electronic CRFs will be prepared for all data collections fields when EDC is being used.
The confidentiality of records that could identify patients must be protected, respecting the 
privacy and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s).
The investigator must retain a copy of the CRFs including records of changes and corrections. If 
EDC is being used, signatures will be obtained electronically and a copy of the electronic CRFs 
will be provided (or the data from the CRFs) for future reference.
12.5 Records Management and Retention
In accordance with the principles of GCP and GLP, the study may be inspected by regulatory 
authorities, the Sponsor and CRO. The Sponsor is entitled to access information about the status 
of the study and to review the original documents of the study.
Theinvestigator must retain all study records and source documents for the maximum required by 
the applicable regulations and guidelines, or institution procedures or for the period of time 
specified by the sponsor, whichever is longer. The investigator must contact the Sponsor prior to 
destroying any records associated with this study.
Biohaven will notify the investigators when the study files for this study are no longer needed.
If the investigator withdraws from the study (i.e., retirement, relocation), the records shall be 
transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee.  Notice of such transfer will be given in writing to 
Biohaven.
It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that the current disposition record of 
investigational product (those supplied by the sponsor) is maintained at each study site where the 
study drug is inventoried and dispensed. Records or logs must comply with applicable regulations 
and guidelines and should include:
oAmount of study drug received and placed in storagearea;

12.6 Source Documentation
An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed 
to record all observations and other data pertinent for all subjects on study.
If source documents are created to support the collection of study information, this must be 
retained with the other pertinent medical record for each patient for verification ofdata points, 
unless otherwise instructed by the Sponsor or designee to enter data directly on theCRF.
12.7 Study Files and Record Retention
The CRO will utilize the Sponsor’s Electronic Trial Master File (eTMF) for the purposes of this 
study. The Sponsor does not require original documents that have already been scanned and 
entered into the eTMF system be forwarded to the Sponsor. Any original documents (i.e. 1572, 
signed financial disclosure, signed ICF, etc.) will be retained in the regulatory binder at the study 
site. The CRO will do a final TMF reconciliation to ensure all study files and regulatory 
documents have been correctly uploaded to the TMF prior to the close or termination of the study. 
Any materials or documents to support the clinical trial outside of the eTMF (i.e. rater training 
tapes) should be maintained by the CRO. The Sponsor will be contacted to determine whether the 
study documents/materials that are retained outside of the TMF will be forwarded to the Sponsor, 
destroyed or kept at CRO or at another facility for a longer period of time at the Sponsor's
expense.
13 AMENDMENTS
Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immediate risk to study subjects, may be 
made only by Biohaven. A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard 
to subjects may be implemented immediately, provided the IRB/IEC is notified within 5 days.
Any permanent change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. The written 
amendment must be submitted to the IRB/IEC and the investigator must await approval before 
implementing the changes. Biohaven will submit protocol amendments to the appropriate 
regulatory authorities for approval.

Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019If in the judgment of the IRB/IEC, the investigator, and/or Biohaven, the amendment to the 
protocol substantially changes the study design and/or increases the potential risk to the subject 
and/or has an impact on the subject's involvement as a study participant, the currently approved 
written informed consent form will require similar modification. In such cases, informed consent 
will be renewed for subjects enrolled in the study before continued participation.
14 STUDY REPORT AND PUBLICATIONS
Biohaven is responsible for preparing and providing the appropriate regulatory authorities with 
clinical study reports according to the applicable regulatory requirements. The publication policy 
of Biohaven is discussed in the investigator's Clinical Research Agreement.
15 STUDY DISCONTINUATION
Both Biohaven and the Principal Investigator reserve the right to terminate the study at the 
investigator’s site at any time. Should this be necessary, Biohaven or a specified designee will 
inform the appropriate regulatory authorities of the termination of the study and the reasons for its 
termination, and the Principal Investigator will inform theIRB/IEC of the same. In terminating 
the study, Biohaven and the Principal Investigator will assure that adequate consideration is given 
to the protection of the subjects’ interests.
16 CONFIDENTIALITY
All information generated in this study is considered highly confidential and must not be 
disclosed to any person or entity not directly involved with the study unless prior written consent 
is gained from Biohaven. However, authorized regulatory officials, IRB/IEC personnel, Biohaven 
and its authorized representatives are allowed full access to the records.
Identification of subjects and CRFs shall be by initials, screening and treatment numbers only. If 
required, the subject's full name may be made known to an authorized regulatory agency or other 
authorized official.
Biohaven may approve the sharing of de-identified data from this study to be made available to 
researchers for the purpose of advancing the understanding of neurologic or psychiatric illness,
rating scales, or trial methodology for the affected population. In any publication of this data, 
confidentiality of individual subjects will be protected.

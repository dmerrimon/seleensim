2.0 Background
2.1 Current Approaches for Radiation Protection
Long-term radiation exposure in the cardiac catheterization laboratory is associated 
with an increased risk of premature cataract formation, chromosomal damage, 
subclinical atherosclerosis and cancer (1-4). Conventional approaches to limit radiation 
exposure include a) wearing lead apparel, b) positioning table and ceiling-mounted 
radiation shields between the operator and patient, and c) technical considerations such 
as reducing the fluoroscopic frame rate, minimizing fluoroscopic time and acquisition 
runs, maintaining the optimal table height and image intensifier position, and use of 
filters and collimators in the imaging chain (5,6). 
Despite these approaches, physicians working in the cardiac catheterization laboratory 
continue to receive high doses of radiation, primarily attributable to scatter radiation 
from the patient. This situation has in part been compounded by the increasing 
complexity of therapeutic procedures, such as interventions for chronic total occlusion. 
Prior studies have demonstrated that the primary operator is subject to the highest 
radiation dose due to proximity to the primary radiation beam, but other operators and 
staff also receive significant occupational exposure. Because of these concerns, there

4has been a clear need to develop new methods to reduce radiation exposure to 
physicians and staff in the cardiac catheterization laboratory.
2.2 ControlRad System
ControlRad has developed a novel technology to reduce radiation exposure during 
cardiac catheterization procedures. The system uses a dynamic collimator that is 
installed above the X-ray tube of the cath lab system (Figure 1). The collimator is 
composed of a partially X-ray attenuating plate with a non-attenuating aperture 
corresponding to the region of interest. The attenuating plate is controlled by a number 
of motors to support high-speed motion of the plate. The position of the aperture is 
controlled by the physician using a table-mounted touch pad (Figure 2). Image 
processing software is used to match brightness and contrast in the attenuated and 
non-attenuated zones. The portion of the image seen through the aperture receives 
normal radiation dose, whereas the portion seen through the attenuated zone receives 
less radiation (Figure 3). For example, during a mid-LAD intervention, the aperture can 
be placed to maintain normal fluoroscopic image quality over the region of interest with 
a lower resolution over the remainder of the screen. The ControlRad system reduces 
radiation exposure during fluoroscopy, but does not change the dose during 
cineangiography.

2.3 Pre-Clinical Data
The ControlRad system was evaluated in a swine model of iliac and renal artery stenting 
(7). Radiation dose measurements were obtained with and without the ControlRad 
system. 
As shown below, there was a significant reduction in baseline radiation dose to both the 
operator and animal with the ControlRad system. The overall effect was a radiation 
reduction of approximately 75% relative to baseline dose.

3.1 Objectives
To determine whether the ControlRad system reduces radiation dose to operators, staff 
and patients during diagnostic and interventional cardiac catheterization and 
electrophysiology (EP) implant procedures
3.2 Design
Prospective, randomized single center evaluation
3.3 Study Population
- Patients scheduled for cardiac catheterization in cath lab 5 at Beaumont Royal Oak.
- Enrolment will continue until 40 patients undergoing intervention have been 
recruited. (The total patient population is estimated to be 200 given the current 
diagnostic cardiac catheterization to interventional cardiac catheterization case 
ration is 2:1 which may fluctuate more participants are enrolled.)
- EP patients scheduled for a Pacemaker or ICD in cath lab 5 at Beaumont Royal Oak 
Hospital.  Enrollment will continue until 30 patients undergo a complex procedure in 
the EP lab. (The current patient population is estimated to be 120 given the simple 
to complex case ratio which may fluctuate as more participants are enrolled.) 
- Physicians and staff 
oFor each procedure, 3 staff members will be study subjects: a) the primary 
operator, b) the secondary operator, c) the nurse/tech who circulates in the 
room 
oDifferent operators and staff may participate in each case depending on 
cath lab scheduling. The cath lab has 20 cardiology fellows, 35 
interventional cardiologists and 56 staff, all of whom may participate in the 
study

3.6 Study Endpoints
Primary Endpoint
- Mean effective radiation dose (μSv) to the primary operator 
Secondary Endpoints
- Mean effective radiation dose (μSv) to the secondary operator 
- Mean effective radiation dose (μSv) to the circulating nurse 
- Mean radiation dose to the patient (dose-area product, DAP)
- Mean radiation dose (μSv) at a standard location on the wall of the cath lab
3.7 Definitions
- Primary operator is the physician who usually stands nearest to the C-arm. This is 
generally the attending physician in the EP cases and a fellow in cath lab 
- Secondary operator is the physician or scrub assistant (nurse or technician) who 
typically stands to the right of the primary operator and in most cases is the 
attending physician in the cath lab. 
- Nurse or Anesthesia team  typically circulates in the room and is responsible for 
monitoring the patient, administering medications and obtaining equipment for the 
procedure
4.0 Conduct of Study

8- Physicians and staff who work in Cath Lab 5 will be provided an information sheet 
regarding the study. The principal investigator will assist in informing the physicians 
and staff about the study, but will not participate in the consent process. Consent 
will be obtained by the research coordinator and will continue for the duration of 
the study. A physician or staff member may withdraw consent at any time during 
the study. Scheduling of procedures and staff will be determined by the cath lab 
manager/scheduler according to usual schedules and lab availability. If a patient, 
physician or staff member declines participation, the procedure will be scheduled in 
another cath lab. 
4.3 Randomization
Procedures will be randomized 1:1 using sealed envelopes provided by the study 
statistician to either cardiac catheterization without ControlRad or cardiac 
catheterization with the ControlRad system. The same 1:1 randomization process will be 
applied to the EP patient population. Patients will be blinded to the randomization. 
4.4 Measurement of Radiation Dose
Two methods will be used to measure radiation dose during the catheterization 
procedure:
A. Real-time Dosimeter Badge (RaySafe)
Real-time radiation exposure data will be collected using the commercially available 
RaySafe dosimetry system (RaySafe i3, Billdal, Sweden). This dosimeter provides the 
ability to measure radiation dose per case. 
B. Landauer Luxel Aluminium Oxide Dosimeter Badges
The Landauer dosimeter badge will provide a cumulative  radiation dose for each 
anatomic location. One set of badges will be used for cases performed with 
ControlRad, and one set for catheterization cases without ControlRad. 
C. Dosimeter Badge Positions
Prior to each catheterization procedure the radiation badges will be placed at each 
location by the research coordinator, radiation safety officer, or trained cath lab 
staff member. The dosimeter badges will be removed at the end of each case.
The location of the badges is shown below:

9Cath Lab Wall Wall (2)
The outer dosimeter badges will be placed on the left anterior side of the thyroid 
collar and the left ankle. The knee badge is affixed to the lower seam of the lead 
apron. 
The inner badges will be placed underneath the lead apparel over the left anterior 
chest. 
The cath lab dosimeters will be placed at standard location on the wall at the foot 
end of the cath lab table. 
For the Landauer dosimeters, two badges will be placed at each location (one badge 
as a backup). 28 badges will be required (14 with and 14 without ControlRad)
4.5 Radiation Settings in Lab
The frame rate for fluoroscopy will be 7.5 frames per second (fps) and 15 fps for 
cineangiography (these settings are currently the default in Lab 5).  
4.6 Catheterization Procedure and EP procedure
Cardiac catheterization, percutaneous coronary intervention, pacemaker and ICD 
implantation will be performed according to standard guidelines and clinical practice. 
The ControlRad is only used during fluoroscopy (the device is not used during “cine” 
acquisition runs). In the event use of the ControlRad device is felt to significantly 
diminish imaging quality outside the region of interest the device can be turned off. 
Standard of care views (typically orthogonal) will be performed after PCI to ensure there 
is no vessel injury. 
Each attending physician may perform 1-2 “roll-in” cases to train on the ControlRad 
system before randomizing patients in the study.  
4.7 Follow-Up
No clinical follow-up will be performed after the hospital stay since the primary 
endpoint is radiation dose measured in the cath lab. 
5.0 Data Management
5.1 Data Collection
Data will be collected in case report forms in the REDCap database. 
5.2 Effective Radiation Dose
The effective radiation dose per case (E) will be calculated using a single dosimeter 
method (8).

105.3 Power Analysis
In 2017, the median total air kerma dose (TAK) for a diagnostic and PCI in Cath Lab 5 was 
460 mGy and 1577 mGy respectively. Approximately 50% of the TAK for a diagnostic or 
PCI procedure is from fluoroscopy and 50% from cineangiography. In pre-clinical studies 
the ControlRad system reduced radiation dose by 75% during fluoroscopy. 
Using PASS 14 Power Analysis and Sample Size Software (2015). NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, 
Utah, USA, ncss.com/software/pass, we found that 9 diagnostic patients and 6 PCI 
patients per arm would give us 80% power to detect that absolute difference of 20% 
with a 0.05 significance level. Allowing for some variation in the actual frequencies in 
this higher risk group of patients or any drop outs, we intend to enroll 30 patients per 
arm.
5.4 Blinding
The physicians and nurses will be blinded to the radiation dose received in each case. 
The radiation dose to each operator and nurse will be recorded after every case by the 
study coordinator or radiation safety operator.  
5.5 Statistical Analysis
Data will be analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. Continuous variables will be reported 
as mean ± standard deviation, and where appropriate as median ± interquartile range. 
Analyses will be performed by a biostatistician using with SAS software for Windows 
version 9.3 (or higher).

116.0 Risk Analysis
6.1 Risks/Benefits to Physicians and Staff
In the standard of care arm of the study there is no additional risk or benefit to the 
physicians or staff. In the ControlRad arm there is no risk to the physician or staff 
however both may benefit from reduced radiation exposure.
6.2 Risks/Benefits to Patient
The decision how to treat the patient is at the discretion of the attending physician. The 
technical approach used for the cardiac catheterization procedure will not be affected 
by the ControlRad system. In the standard of care arm of the study there is no additional 
risk or benefit to the patient. In the ControlRad arm there the patient may benefit from 
reduced radiation exposure. In the ControlRad arm there may be slightly diminished 
visualization of surrounding structures (outside the region of interest) when the device 
is used during fluoroscopy.

BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
Neonates with persistent pulmonary  hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) or hy poxic 
respiratory  failure (HRF) who do not respond to comprehensive supportive intensive care 
measures are t ypically treated with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) , which is considered standard 
therap y.  Inhaled nitric oxide treatment increases the partial pressure of arterial oxygen 
(PaO 2) by dilating pulmonary  vessels in better ventilated areas of the lung, redistributing 
pulmonary  blood flow away  from regions with low ventilation.  I nhaled nitric oxide appears 
to reduce the need for extracorporeal membrane oxy genation (ECMO) in HRF , while 
mortality  is not affected .1  However, treatment with iNO is not effective for all patients and 
requires continued intubation and artificial ventilation.
Sildenafil citrate is a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase t ype5 (PDE5), which is found 
in high concentrations in the lungs.  I nhibition of PDE5 s
hould enhance the vasodilatory  
effects of naturally  occurring and inhaled nitric oxide, promoting relaxation of vascular 
smooth muscle, and increasing blood flow.  There fore, sildenafil may  have utility  in the 
treatment of neonates with PPHN and HRF at ris k for PPHN.  
Case r eports ofoff-label use of 
sildenafil in conjunction with iNO indicate that sildenafil could enhance the efficacy  of iNO 
and reduce the time on iNO therap y.  The effects of the addition of IV sildenafil to standard 
iNO therap y in the acu
te stage of this disease will be studied in this clinical study .
OBJECTIVES 
The primary objective sof this study  areto evaluate the efficacy and safet y of IV 
sildenafil 
when added to iNO for the treatment ofneonates with PPHN or HRF and at 
risk for PPHN.
The secondary  objectives of this study  are to evaluate the developmental progress of 
patients with PPHN treated with IV sildenafil or placebo, 12 and 24 months after the 
end of study  treatment.
ENDPOINTS
Part A:
Co-Primary Endpoints: Assessed at Day 14 o
r hospital discharge, whichever occurs first:
Time on iNO treatment after initiation of IV study drug for subjects without treatment 
failure;
Treatment failure rate, defined as need for additional treatment targeting PPHN, need 
for ECMO, or death during the study .

Number of Subjects/Sites
Total of 64 subjects ( 32 for each arm)/ A minimum of ~30 sites.
Country Location
Primarily , but not limited to t he European Union and No rth America.
Study Design
This study  will be conducted in two parts.  Part A is thedouble -blind phase to assess the 
efficacy  and safet y of IV sildenafil versus placebo when added to iNO for no more than 
14-days, during the acute phase of the disease, with follow -up at 7 and 28 days after the end 
of study  drug infusion.  Part B is the long-term, non- interventional phase , during which all 
subjects will be encouraged to return at 12 and 24 months after the end of study  drug 
infusion, to take part in developme ntal assessments, audiological and ophthalmology  tests.
Analy sis of the double -blind phase of the study  (Part A) will be performed when all subjects 
have completed or discontinued from the double
-blind phase, and a stud y report will be 
written.  Anal ysis of the non- interventional phase of the study  (Part B) will be performed 
when all subjects have completed or discontinued from the 2- year follow -up visit, and a final 
study  report will be written.
Part A:
This is a multi -center, multi -national, randomized, d ouble -blind (sponsor and investigator), 
placebo- controlled, parallel group study  with a screening phase, treatment phase, and 
follow -up phase.  Neonates who are 96hours of age (at randomization) , at least 34 weeks 
gestational age, receiving iNO at 10 -20ppm while on 50% FiO 2for PPHN or HRF and at 
risk for PPHN, with oxygenation index (OI) >15 and <60, will be randomized to 1 of 
2parallel arms of study  drug treatment:  IV sildenafil or IV placebo (1:1 ratio).  Study drug 
infusion must continue for at le ast 48 hours, and may  continue for up to 14 -days, with or 
without the administration of additional therap y for PPHN, such as alternative pulmonary 
vasodilators.  Note:  If maintaining study drug infusion for 48 hours is deemed by the 
investigator to compro mise subject safety, the study drug infusion may be stopped, and 
the subject treated with standard care.
Weaning from iNO, according to protocol- defined guidelines (See Section 6.2.3) , must oc cur 
prior to stopping IV study  drug, up to the 
14-day infusion limit.  After study drug is 
discontinued , the study  drug infusion may be restarted within 24 hours as needed based on 
clinical decline , but not to exceed the 14- day infusion limit .  All subject s will be followed up 
for medical status and adverse events at 7 and 28days after stud y drug is discontinued .

Page 8Part B:
This is the non-interventional phase of the study, in which developmental progress of 
subjects from Part A will be assessed.  Subjects’ parents/legal representative will have the opportunity to return the subjects for two visits, at 12 and 24 month following the end of study drug treatment.
STUDY TREATMENTS
Part A:
All subjects will be treated with standard background therapy, including iNO as specified in 
the protocol.
Study treatment will be either IV sildenafil, loading dose of 0.1 mg/kg over 30 minutes, 
followed by maintenance dose of 0.03 mg/kg/h, or IV placebo; infusion to last no more than 14-days.  Should a serious or severe event of hypotension develop during the loading dose, per clinical judgment, the investigator has the option to reduce the infusion rate of the loading dose by 50%, or briefly stop the infusion for 15 minutes and then restart the loading dose at half the rate, for the rest of the loading dose.
Part B:
This part of the study is non-interventional.
STATISTICAL METHODS
The primary statistical objective is to test for the superiority of iNO + sildenafil over iNO + 
placebo for time on iNO treatment after initiation of IV study drug for subjects without treatment failures, and for treatment failure rate.
Sample Size Determination
All subjects who take part in Part A of the study are eligible to take part in Part B, the 
long-term follow-up part of the study.
Sample size calculation for time on iNO for subjects without treatment failure is based on the 
internal database at .  In the  database, there were 101 patients treated with iNO alone who were not treatment failures and met the 
following entry criteria of this study: age ≤96 hours (at start of study medication), gestational 
age ≥34 weeks, PPHN patients, 15 < OI <60 at baseline.  The mean (S.D.) time on iNO for 
those 101 patients was 3.4 (1.88) days.  It is believed to be clinically relevant if subjects receiving iNO + sildenafil have a 50% reduction in the time on iNO (ie, 1.7 days). 
Sample size calculation for the treatment failure rate is based on the iNOmax
®pivotal studies 
(NINOS and CINRGI) (46% and 33% respectively) and the previously completed Pfizer PPHN study A1481157 (2 (7%) out of 29 subjects).  Treatment failure rates of 40% and 10% are assumed for the iNO alone arm and the iNO + sildenafil arm respectively.PPD PPD

Page 9A total of 64 subjects ( 32 for each arm) will be enrolled in the study .
Assuming 40% treatment failure rate in the iNO alone arm and 10% failure rate in the iNO +
sildenafil arm:
Time on iNO for subjects without treatment failure: 19 (59%) subjects in iNO alone 
vs. 29 (91%) subjects in iNO + sildenafil will provide 8 5% power to detect a mean 
difference of 1.7 days for time on iNO, assuming mean of 3.4 days for iNO alone and 
population standard deviation of 1.88 days, at significance level of 0.05 from a 
2-sided two sample t -test.
Treatment failure rate: 32 subjects in each treatment will provide 80% power to detect 
an absolute difference of 30% (40% vs. 10%) at significance level of 0.05 (2 -sided).
Statistical Analysis for Primary Endpoint
Part A :
Time on iNO for subjects without treatment failure will be summarized fo r each treatment.  
Treatment comparison will be conducted using analy
sis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting 
for time on iNO treatment prior to randomization.  Mean treatment difference, its 
95% confidence interval and p -value will be calculated.
Treatment fa ilure rate and its 95% confidence interval will be calculated for each treatment 
group.  Treatment comparison will be conducted using either Chi- square test or Fisher’s 
exact test ,whichever is appropriate.  Estimated treatment difference in rates, its 
95% confidence interval and p -value will be calculated.
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all randomized subjects who receive any 
infusion of study  treatment.  The per -protocol (PP) population will be restricted to subjects 
who complete the study  with no major protocol violations.  The primary  efficacy  anal ysis 
will be based on the ITT population.
Part B :
For the long-term development assessments, data will be explored through the use of 
standard presentations of descriptive statistics.
Phar macokinetic and Pharmacokinetic -Pharmacodynamic Methods
The PK of sildenafil and of UK -103320, the major metabolite in adults, will be characterized 
using population PK analy sis of sildenafil plasma concentration- time data.
Note:   PK samples will not be collected from study  subjects in France.

Page 171.INTRODUCTION
Persistent pulmonary  hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is the term given to a condition in 
which the normal pulmonary  hypertension of the fetus is sustained after birth , and can 
complicate neonatal respiratory  failure.  PPHN is diagnosed in 1.9 per 1000 live birth s.2  
Mortality  for PPHN is between 5- 10% even with appropriate therapy ,3and can be higher 
than 20% .Prevalence and mortality  rates vary  between centers and locales.  Survivors have 
high morbidity  in the forms of neurodevelopmental and audiological impairment, cognitive 
delay s,andhearing loss .4, 5
PPHN is a complex sy ndrome, in which t he cause is frequentl y unknown.   The sy ndrome 
includes pulmonary  vasoconstriction, right -to-left shunting through the ductus arteriosus 
and/or foramen ovale, and severe h ypoxemia without evidence of congenital heart disease.  
The diverse underl ying pathophy siolog ies of PPHN present earl y as h ypoxic respiratory  
failure that is not responsive to 100% oxy gen.
Newborns with hy poxic respiratory  failure not controlled by  comprehensive supportive 
intensive care measures (eg, mechanical ventilation techniques, surfactant administration, 
alkalinization, sedation, and neuromuscular blockade) are t ypicall y treated with inhaled nitric 
oxide (iNO).  When inhaled, nitric oxide selectively  dilates the pulmonary  vasculature, with 
minimal effect on the s ystemic vasculature.  Inhale d NO appears to i ncrease the partial 
pressure of arterial ox ygen (PaO 2)by dilating pulmonary  vessels in better ventilated areas of 
the lung, redistributing pulmonary  blood flow away  from lung regions with low 
ventilation/perfusion ratios toward regions wi th normal ratios.
  It is the only selective 
pulmonary  vasodilator that has been shown to improve oxy genation in newborns with 
hypoxic respiratory  failure .6
When iNO is not effective, patients may  be maintained w ith extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation (ECMO), which provides pump support for the d ysfunctional heart and 
oxygenation for the failing lungs, while the pulmonary  hypertension returns to expected 
post-natal levels.  ECMO has been described as the most inva sive therapeutic modality  and 
the ultimate rescue .7  Hypoxic respiratory  failure is the most common reason for referral for 
neonatal ECMO .8
The Neonatal Inhaled Nitri c Oxide Study  Group (NINOS)1and Clinical Inhaled Nitric Oxide 
Research Group (CINRGI)9trials showed that treatment with iNO significantly  reduces the 
need for ECMO 
in patients with hy poxic respiratory  failure and/or PPHN.  Despite this 
therapeutic benefit, in the NINOS and CINRGI trials, 39% and 38% of the subjects who 
received iNO, respectively, were eventuall y treated with ECMO because iNO had failed to 
correct their h ypoxic respiratory  failure.  Recent data show the survival rate for newborns 
with PPHN who require ECMO is no more than 80%
.10  These data indicate that there 
remains 
a need for additional effective treatmen t options for this patient population.
Subsequent to NI NOS and CI NRGI and the widespread availability  of iNO, it has  become 
routine in many  neonatal centers to treat hy poxic respiratory  failure with iNO earlier, i e,in 
the presence of lesser degrees of h ypoxemia, than it was initiated in NI NOS and CI NRGI 
(OI25) and without clinical evidence of PPHN.

Page 181.1.Indication
Revatio®is a PDE5 inhibitor that is approved in oral form for the treatment of pulmonary  
arterial h ypertension (PAH) in adults (globally ) and chi ldren (in the EU) .  The intravenous 
preparation is approved globally  for the treatment of PAH in adults.  In this study , the IV 
preparation will be studied in the treatment of term and near -
term neonates with the disease 
of persistent pulmonary  hypertensio n of the newborn (PPHN) or hy poxic respiratory  failure 
(HRF) and at risk for PPHN.
1.2.Background and Rationale
This study  is being conducted as part of aPaediatric Investigation Plan required by  the 
Paediatric Committee (PDCO) of the European Medicines Agenc y(EMA) .
1.2.1. Study Rationale
Treatment with iNO has been shown to significantly  reduce the need for extracorporeal 
membrane ox ygenation (ECMO) and has become a standard of care for neonates with PPHN.  
However, around 40 % of neonates with PPHN fail to respond to iNO .11
Furthermore long term complications of iNO in neonates are unknown and serious adverse 
events of iNO, such as methaemoglobinaemia, oxidative injury , and effects on platelet 
function have been reported.12  In addition, a dministration of iNO is by  inhalation, requiring 
intubation and ventilatory support in the neonatal ICU , with their associated risks for 
co-morbidities
, such as nosocomial infections and pneum othorax.
Despite the availabilit y of iNO and ECMO in tertiary  specialised centres, hy poxic respiratory  
failure and PPHN remain life threatening conditions.  Thus, there is a need for additional
therapies for PPHN that may  supplement the use of iNO or ECMO ,
increase the rate of 
recovery , and reduce time on the ventilator and in the ICU.
In Part A, the primary  endpoints of this study  will assess the efficacy  of IV sildenafil to 
reduce the amount of time needed on iNO, b ycomparing the time on iNO plus sildena fil to 
time on iNO plus placebo in subjects without treatment failure , and to reduce the treatment 
failure rate of standard therap y.  Anecdotal reports indicate that sildenafil (oral preparation 
via nasogastric tube) is added to iNO treatment for several r easons, such as to prevent 
rebound ,13to augment the efficacy of iNO ,14and in cases when PPHN is refractory  to iNO 
treatment .15
The study  is designed to allow subjects to begin treatment with standard of care, followed b y
additional treatment with IV sildenafil during the acute phase of the disease , and allow for a
rapid removal of iNO as measured b y improvement in disease state.  Th e
seendpoint s have
the potential to assess the clinical as well as practical benefits of sildenafil as measured by  
the reduction in the duration of iNO therap yand reduction in the rate of treatment failure 
seen with iNO therapy .

Page 19PartB of this study  is designed to monitor the developmental progress , neurological 
development, and long term safet yof subjects enrolled in the study .  All subjects who 
received study  treatment (sildenafil or placebo) will be eligible to participate in this long-
term f ollow -up part of the study .  
1.2.2. Revatio
Sildenafil citrate is a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase t ype5 (PDE5).  Present 
throughout the body , PDE5 is found in high concentrations in the lungs.  Inhibition of PDE5 
enhances the vasodilatory effects of nitric oxide in pulmonary  hypertension by  preventing the 
degradation of cy clic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which promotes relaxation of 
vascular smooth muscle and increases blood flow.
Sildenafil produces a relatively  selective reduction in pulmonary  artery  pressure without 
adverse s ystemic hemody namic effects.
Revatio(sildenafil citrate) has been licensed in adults for use in the treatment of pulmonary  
arterial h ypertension (PAH); approval granted in2005 in the EU and the US .  In May  2011, 
the Euro
pean Commission approved Revatiofor the treatment of paediatric patients aged 
1to 17 years with PAH.  Also, there are reports that sildenafil may  have utility  in the 
treatment of neonates with PPHN .14, 16, 17
For further information on completed and ongoing studies conducted in support of this 
indication, refer to the Investigators’ Brochure.
1.2.3. Previous Clinical Experience in PPHN
Study  A1481157 was a seven day , open -label, multicentre study  in 36 neonatal patients with 
PPHN or hy poxic respiratory  failure and at risk of developing PPHN.  The study  consisted of 
eight escalating -dose groups (see Table 1) with patients receiving study  drug for at least 
48hours and for up to 7 days with or without the addition of standard treatment.
Seven neonates were enrolled before treatment with iNO was started.  In these neonates, OI 
improved after initiation of sildenafil infusion and 6 of the 7 neonates completed treatment 
without the need for iNO or ECMO.   Twent y-nine subjects were on iNO prior to study  start.  
Among these 29 subjects, 2 (7%) needed ECMO or died.
Sildenafil was given at increasin g doses in this study .  Twent y subjects had a total of 
41treatment emergent adverse events, and onl y five of these were regarded as related to 
study  drug.  
There was one death and four serious treatment emergent adverse events, none 
were considered relate d to study  treatment.  In total, four neonates were withdrawn from the 
study  due to treatment emergent adverse events, two of which were regarded as treatment 
related.  The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severit y.  However, five 
treatm ent emergent events, reported in five neonate patients, were rated as severe (three of 
which were also recorded as serious adverse events).  None of these were considered 
treatment related.

Page 20Study  A1481276 was an open -label, single centre, single arm study  to determine the efficacy  
of IV sildenafil as monotherap y in the treatment of neonatal patients (target 40 subjects) with 
PPHN or hy poxic respiratory  failure and at risk of developing PPHN .  The subjects were to 
be naïve to iNO treatment .  
The study  consi sted of one dosing group, with all subjects receiving IV sildenafil for up to 
14-days.  Standard treatment –iNO and/or ECMO –could be provided for lack of efficacy , at 
the discretion of the investigator/treating phy
sician.  Sildenafil was given as a 30 -minute 
loading dose, followed by  a maintenance dose, according to the subject’s weight (see 
Section 1.2.4 Dose Rationale).
Four subjects were enrolled into the study , and received IV sildenafil.  One subject 
completed the study without the need for iNO or ECMO.  Three subjects discontinued the 
study  early.  One subject was disqualified following echocardiogram results showing ductal 
shunting due to a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) .  The second subject was discontinued from 
the st udy due to adverse event (Reduced cardiac function), and was treated with ECMO.  The 
third subject did not respond to sildenafil or iNO andsuffered worsening PPHN which led to 
her death.
Thirty -four treatment emergent adverse events were reported for the four subjects.  None 
were considered as related to study  treatment.  Three of these AEs were reported, for two 
subjects, as serious AEs (bradycardia, congenital pneumonia, and worsening PPHN leading 
to death).  None of these were considered treatment relat ed.
Due to evolved standard of care and widespread use of iNO at earl y signs of hy poxic 
respiratory  failure or PPHN, the clinical relevance of study  A1481276 came into question. 
Dialogue with phy sicians and the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) of the European Medicines 
Agency  (EMA) led to terminating study  A1481276 and designing study  A1481316 to address 
clinical benefit of IV sildenafil in the context of iNO treatment.
1.2.4. Dose Rationale
In Stud y A1481157, 36 near-and full-term neonates diagnosed with PPHN were 
administered intravenous sildenafil within 72 hours of birth.  One patient died during the 
study  from her underly ing disease, and data from this patient were not included in the 
pharmacokinetic anal ysis.  The dosing regimen consisted of a loading infusion o f fixed 
duration ranging from 5 min to 3 hours among treatment groups, followed by  a continuous 
maintenance infusion of variable duration, ranging from 2. 5to 168 hours for individual 
patients.  A ll but 4 patients received the maintenance infusion for at l east the minimum 
duration of 48 hours specified in the protocol.  One group of four patients received the 
maintenance infusion only.

PK and oxy genation index were m easured in 35 of the 36 PPHN neonates enrolled in the 
study .
A population PK model was developed from the study  which described the pharmacokinetics 
of sildenafil in PPHN patients .18  Subsequently , an explorator y indirect response PK -PD 
model for oxy genation index ( OI) was developed which adequatel y described the 
pharmacod ynamics of OI.  The established PK and PK-PD model combined with the 
observed PK and OI data indicated that a similar OI response was observed across all dose 
groups , and also predicted by  the PK -PD model across all dose groups in Study  A1481157, 
potentially  any dose regimen tested could be taken forward in terms of OI response.
Since the link between OI and the reduced need for iNO is uncertain, the relationship of a 
response between sildenafil and iNO is unknown, and treatment failure is seriously  
detrimental for patients with this disease, the targeted dose regimen for this study  should:
Achieve the maximum OI response observed in Study  A148115
7.
Achieve sufficient sildenafil exposure which has been shown to be efficacious in 
children/adults treated for PAH.
Part A
The proposed dose regimen for Part A of this study  (A1481316) is a loading dose of 
0.1mg/kg given over 30 minutes followed by  a mai ntenance dose of 0.03 mg/kg/h, is 
predicted to achieve these two targets.  Using this regimen the sildenafil concentration at 
steady  state is predicted to be [Mean (95% CI), 57(32, 98) ng/mL ], similar to what has been 
shown to be efficacious in children/adults treated for PAH.  This dosing regimen was utilized 
in Study  A1481276; there were no reports of adverse events or tolerability  issues related to 
IV sildenafil infusion.

Page 25Study drug infusion must continue for at least 48 hours, and may continue for up to 
14-days, with or without the administration of additional therapy  for PPHN, such as 
alternative pulmonary  vasodilator.   (See Section 5.5Concomitant Medication for a list of 
prohibited medication.)   If maintaining study drug infusion for 48 hours is deemed by the 
investigator to compromise subject safety, the study drug infusion may be stopped, and 
the subject treated with standard care.
Weaning from iNO, according to protocol- defined guidelines, must occur prior to stopping 
IVstudy  drug, up to the 14
-day infusion limit.  After study  drug discontinuation, the subject 
may be restarted within 24 hours if needed based on clinical decline, but not to exceed the 
14-dayinfusion limit.  All subjects will be followed up for medical status and adverse events 
at 7 and 28 days after the discontinuation of study  drug.
Dosing instructions including a chart of infusi
on rates by  weight will be provided to the study  
pharmacist s.  The stud y drug infusion will start with a loading dose of 0.1 mg/kg 
administered over 30 minutes.  The loading dose is intended to bring the plasma 
concentration to the targeted level. 
Part B
This long -term non- interventional phase of the study  will evaluate the developmental 
progress of the subjects in the study  at 12 and 24 months following theend of study  
treatment.

4.3.Sponsor Qualified Medical Personnel
The contact information for the sponsor's appropriately
 qualified medical personnel for the 
trial is documented in the study  contact list , located with study -related materials and manuals 
at each si te.
To facilitate access to appropriatel y qualified medical personnel on stud y related medical 
questions or problems, subjects are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains, 
at a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, p atient study  number, 
contact information for the investigational site and contact details for a help desk in the event 
that the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question 
or problem originating from another healthc are professional not involved in the subjects 
participation in the study . The help desk number can also be used b y investigational staff if 
they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems, however it should only  be used in 
the event that the esta blished communication pathway s between the investigational site and 
the study  team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace the 
established communication pathway s between the investigational site and study  team for 
advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the study . The help desk 
number is not intended for use by the subject directly  and if a subject calls that number they  
will be directed back to the investigational site.
5.STUDY TREATMENTS
This section a pplies only  to Part A of the study .
This is a double -blind study  in which the Sponsor’s study  team, investigator and site staff, 
and subject’s legal representative are blinded.  The investigator/site staff will enlist the aid of 
a research pharmacist(s) or other suitably  qualified individual who is not directly  involved in 
the care of stud y subjects, collecting study data or study assessments.  At the beginning of the 
study , only active open -label supplies will be available.  The site’s pharmacist(s) or oth er 
suitably  qualified individual will be unblinded to study  treatment and be involved in the 
receipt, storage, and preparation of the study  drug / investigational product.  In addition, they  
will maintain the blind with respect to all other study  staff.

Page 29At the start of the stud y, unblinded open -label investigational product (sildenafil and empt y 
placebo cartons )will be provided by  the Sponsor , to the unblinded site pharmacist(s) or other 
suitably  qualified individual at the site for storage and preparatio n.
When double -blind investigational product
(active and placebo) are available, the supplies 
will be provided by the Sponsor to the site.  The Sponsor’s study  team, i nvestigator and site 
staff, and subject ’s legal representative are all blinded to the bli nded investigational product
(active and placebo)
5.1.Allocation to Treatment
The trial design uses 2 parallel arms with a ratio of 1:1, active treatment to placebo.
An automated IVRS will be utilized in this study .  The sy stem will assign randomization 
number s to subjects, as they  are determined to be eligible for study  treatment, in accordance 
with the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  The randomization number for each subject must 
be recorded in the appropriate case report form (CRF).
The sitepharmacist(s) or other suitably  qualified individual will receive the randomization 
treatment assignment with each unique randomization number.  The sitepharmacist(s) or 
other suitably  qualified individual will prepare and label the investigational product for the 
loading dose and maintenance infusion according to the dilution instructions for the assigned 
randomization number and treatment ty pe.  All study  staff, other than the site pharmacist(s) 
or other suitably  qualified individual, will be blinded to study  treatme nt
5.2.Breaking the Blind –for Blinded and Unblinded Investigational Product
The study  will be double -blinded, to the Sponsor’s study  team, to the investigator and site 
staff, and to the subject’s legal representative .  
Exception for unblinded investigational product : the site pharmacist orother suitably 
qualified individual who prepares the study infusion will be unblinded to treatment 
assignment .
For blinded investigational product , the site pharmacist or other suitabl y qualified 
individual who prepares the study  infusion will be blinded to treatment assignment and must 
follow the instructions for breaking the blind.
At the initiation of the study , the study  site will be instructed on the method for breaking the 
blind.  The method will be either a manual or electronic process.  Blinding codes should only  
be broken in emergency  situations for reasons of subject safet y and in emergency  situations 
only if knowledge of the investigational product will alter the course of treatment of the 
subject.  Whenever pos sible, the investigator or sub- investigator consults with a member of 
the Sponsor’s study  team prior to breaking the blind.  When the blinding code is broken, the 
reason must be full y documented and entered on the CRF.
If a s ubject ’s code is broken , the subject will continue to be followed up throughout the study  
as per the visit schedule.

If the condition of stud y subjects does not improve or worsens after the start of study  
medication, and the subject, in the opinion of the i nvestigator, would benefit from additional 
drug treatment (especially to avoid use of ECMO), the investigator should institute any  
treatment necessary  to provide maximum care for the subject.  The stud y drug infusion 
should be stopped, and the investigator should begin additional treatment.  The subject 
should remain in the study for the purpose of collecting safet y and follow -up data.
The use of additional drug therapies prohibited b y the protocol specifically  targeting PPHN 
(eg,PDE5 inhibitors, endotheli n antagonists, prostacy clins (inhaled or IV), magnesium 
sulfate infusion, nitroprusside, and vasopressin) will be considered failure of study  treatment.  
6. STUDY PROCEDURES 
PartA is a short term study , conducted in an acute care setting.  The study  consis ts of a 
screening phase , treatment phase during which study  drug is intravenously infused, and a 
follow -up phase consisting of 2 study  visits.
PartB is a long -term extension of the study , conducted in the clinic offices, and consists of 
2long-term follow -up study  visits.

6.2.Treatment Period
Dosing instructions including a chart of infusion rates by  weight will be provided to the study  
pharmacist.  The study drug infusion will start with a loading dose (sildenafil or placebo) 
administered over 30 minutes, followed by  the maintenance dose (sildenafil or placebo) 
administered at a lower infusion rate.  The study drug should be infused via a dedicated 
intravenous line or separate port if using a multi-lumen catheter .
6.2.1. Procedures for Initial 30 Minutes of Study Treatment (Loading Dose)
Administer loading dose for 30 minutes.  Should a serious or severe event of 
hypotension develop during the loading dose, per clinical judgment, the investigator 
has the option to reduce the infusion rate of the loading dose b y 50%, or briefly stop 
the infusion for 15 minutes and then restart the loading dose at half the rate, for the 
rest of the loading dose.
Close monitoring of vital signs (BP, HR, RR, O 2saturation); record vital signs every 
15minutes x 2 .
Ongoing review/recording of concomitant medications and background iNO therap y.
Ongoing monitoring of adverse events .
6.2.2. Procedures for Maintenance Infusi onPeriod
Study  drug infusion must continue for at least 48 hours and may  continue for up to 14- days 
(336 hours).  If maintaining study  drug infusion for 48 hours is deemed b y the investigator to 
compromise subject safety, the stud y drug infusion may be st opped, and the subject treated 
with standard care.
Reduce stud y drug infusion to maintenance infusion rate; infuse for at least 48 hours .

6.2.3. Procedures for Weaning from iNO
If the subject is receiving iNO at >20 ppm, the investigator should make every  attempt to 
decrease the iNO down to 20 ppm as soon as possible over 24 hours, according to site 
practice.  As ox ygenation improves, the FiO 2should be decreased to 60%.
Weaning of iNO for study  purposes should begin when the following conditions occur:
iNO treatment is 20 ppm; AND
FiO 260%; AND
PaO 260mm H g (7.9 kPa); AND/OR
SpO 2(oxygen saturation per pulse oximeter) 90%.
The iNO should be decreased to 5 ppm by  decrements of 5 ppm every  1
-2hours.  At the 
same time, the FiO 2should be decreased b y steps of 2% to 4% per hour to 40%. After that, 
iNO should be weaned by  1ppm every  1-2hours down to 0 ppm.  During this time, the 
subject’s ox ygen saturation should be monitored closely, and the FiO 2may be increased 
asneeded.   PaO 2must remain ≥60 mm Hg and/or SpO 2≥90% before moving from one step 
to the next .  See Figure 2below for an illustrated representation of possible weaning 
scenario.
If the subject’s oxygen saturation decreases at any time during the weaning process, the 
investigator should increase iNO and Fi
O2as needed, and try weaning again when the 
subject is stable.

6.2.4. Stopping Study Drug Infusion (Between 48 and 336 hours)
Study  drug infusion may  be discontinued at an ytime during the study , if the infusion is 
deemed b y the investigator to compromise subject safet y and well -
being.  The subject will be 
treated with standard care.
After a minimum treatment period of 48 hours , and after iNO treatment has been 
success fully weaned off, study  drug infusion may  be discontinued at the investigator’s 
discretion, according to the following steps:
The iNO treatment must be discontinued at least 1 hour prior to discontinuation of 
study  drug, unless the 
14-day infusion limit (336 hours) has been reached .
If PaO 260mm Hg (or 7.9 kPa) and/or SpO 2≥90% and FiO 2is 40-50%, t he rate of 
study  drug infusion will be reduced b y half and the infusion continued for 12 hours
(1hour).
If PaO 260mm Hg (or 7.9 kPa) and/or SpO 2≥90% and FiO 2is 40- 50% after 12
(1) hours, the stud y drug infusion will be discontinued .
The date, time, and rate of study  drug infusion changes should be recorded in the 
CRF .

6.3.Follow -up Visit s(short -term)
There will be two short -term follow -up visits for this s tudy: Follow Up1 and Follow Up2 
will be conducted at 7 3days(or hospital discharge if sooner) and 28 3days, respectively , 
after the end of the study drug infusion .  Follow Up 2 visit may  be conducted as a 
telephone call instead of a clinic or office v isit.
Assessments will be conducted as follows:
Follow Up 1 (or hospital discharge if sooner) :
Vital signs (BP, HR, RR, O 2saturation) ;
Physical examination ;
Monitoring of adverse events;
Monitoring of concomitant medications, if subject remains hospitaliz ed;
Dispense diary  for the recording of possible adverse events until the next study  
visit.
At Part A Follow -up Visit 1, the subject’s parent/legal representative will be given a diary  for 
the recording of possible adverse events between visits.  The inves tigator will instruct the 
parent/legal representative to collect possible adverse events until the next study  visit.
Follow Up 2 (may  be conducted as a telephone call) :
Monitoring of adverse events;
Monitoring of concomitant medications, if subject remains hospitalized ;
If conducted in person, dispense diary  for the recording of possible adverse events 
until the next study  visit .

Medical History , SAEs, or AEs.  A new diary  will be provided to the parent/legal 
representative at the end of Part B Visit 1, to be returned at Part B Visit 2.
NOTE:  In consideration of the need to sc hedule and conduct Part B visit procedures in 
multiple clinics, involving multiple specialists, and to reduce the burden on study  subjects of 
multiple assessments, the L ong-Term Visit procedures may  be conducted on separate day s as 
needed.  All procedures must be performed within the Study  Visit windows of 12 and 24 (2) 
months following the end of study  drug infusion, as noted above.
6.5.Subject Withdrawal
Subjects may bewithdraw nfrom the stud y at an y time at the request of their legal 
representative , or the y may be withdrawn at any  time at the discretion of the investigator or 
sponsor for safet yor behavioral reasons, or the inability  of the subject or legal representative
to comply  with the protocol required schedule of study  visits or procedures at a given study  
site.
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every  effort should be made to contact the 
subject ’s legal representative .  In any circumstance, every  effort should be made to document 
subject outcome, if possible.  The investigator should inquire about the reason for 
withdrawal, request the subject to return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow -
up with the 
subject regarding an y unresolved adverse events (AEs) .
If the subject is withdraw nfrom the study , and the legal representativ e also withdraws 
consent for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed, and 
no additional data should be collected.  The sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data 
collected before such withdrawal of consent.

If treatment is stopped at any  point prior to the 48 to 120 hour PK samples, a PK sample will 
be taken immediatel y prior to the end of th e infusion and if practical the post infusion PK 
samples will be collected as scheduled.
If the infusion is re -started, and only one post-infusion PK blood sample ha sbeen collected 
previously , a sample will be drawn prior to re- starting.  Subsequent sampl es are not required.
An interim anal ysis will be performed b y an unblinded PK anal yst after a minimum of 
10subjects in Part A have completed the stud y.  Observed sildenafil concentration -time data 
will be evaluated to determine whether PK sampling shou l
d occur during all three proposed 
sampling windows (4
-8 hrs; 18-24 hrs; and 40 -48hrs) following the stop of infusion.  If all 
samples within a given window are below the lower limit of quantification, the PK 
sample collection in its associated window may be dropped for subsequent subjects.  If 
this change is deemed appropriate, the Pfizer study team will communicate this change 
to the study sites in writing.
Blood samples must not be collected from the catheter or port connected to study  
drug infusion.
Sampl es will be centrifuged at approximatel y 1700 x g for about 10 minutes at 4 C.  
The plasma will be stored in appropriatel y labeled screw -capped pol ypropylene tube

Page 488.ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
8.1.Adverse Events
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or su spected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following 
sections.
For all AEs , the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine 
the outcome of the AEand to assess whether i t meets the criteria for classification as a nSAE
requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its designated representative.  For all AEs, 
sufficient information should be obtained b y the investigator to determine the causalit y of the 
AE.  The investigator is required to assess causality .  Follow -up by  the investigator may  be 
required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the 
investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews co nducted by  the Sponsor, any  non- serious adverse event 
that is determined b y the Sponsor to be serious will be reported b y the Sponsor as a n SAE .  
To assist in the determination of case seriousness further information may  be requested from 
the investigator to provide clarit y and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study .  
8.2.Reporting Period
For SAEs, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated representative begins from 
the time that the subject provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the subject’s 
participation in the study , ie, prior to undergoing any  study -related procedure and/or 
receiving investigational product, through and including 28 calendar day s after the last 
administration of the investigational prod uct.  SAEs occurring to a subject after the active 
reporting period has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes 
aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a 
reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational product are to be reported to the 
sponsor.
AEs (serious and non -
serious) should be recorded on the Case Report Form (CRF) from the 
time the subject has taken at least 1 dose of investigational product through the subject ’slast
visit.   
For the purposes of this study :
A diary  will be given to the subject’s parent/legal guardian at Part A Follow -up Visit 1, and 
at Part B Long Term Follow -up Visits 1 and 2.  The parent/legal guardian will be instructed 
by the investigator to record information related to possible adverse events that may  occur 
between visits.
Between Part A follow -up Visit 1 (Part A follow -up Visit 2 may  be a telephone call) and 
PartB Visit 1 and between Part B Visit 1 and Visit 2, the subject’s parent/legally  accep table 
representative will collect possible adverse events in a diary .  At the study  visits, the

the diary  which items meet the definitions of adverse events (See Section 8.3below) or 
medical history , and which items are not considered either.
Medical history  will be considered conditions that were present at birth but not detected at 
the time of screening in Part A, suc h as congenital or chromosomal abnormalities, or 
occurred prior to stud y drug treatment, and will be recorded in the CRF under Medical 
History .  Adverse events will be recorded in the CRF as such.  
SAEs must be reported from the time the subject’s parent/ legal representative provides 
informed consent through Part B Long-term Follow -Up Visit 2 and at an y time an 
investigator becomes aware.
8.3.Definition of an Adverse Event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administere d a 
product or medical device; the event need not necessarily  have a causal relationship with the 
treatment or usage.  Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:  
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in phy sical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progression/worsening of underl ying disease;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , they  may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravas ation;
Exposure during pregnancy .(EDP);
Exposure via breastfeeding;

Page 50Medication error ;
Occupational exposure.
8.4.Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an AEare as follows: 
Test r esult is associated with accompan ying symptoms, and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in study  dosing or discontinuation from the study , 
significant additional conco mitant drug treatment, or other therapy , and/or
Test result is considered to be an AEby the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result tha t is determined to be an error does not require 
reporting as an AE.
8.5.Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.
Medical and scientific judgment isexercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospitalization.  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or m ay require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.

There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study .  All SAEs will be reported by  the 
investigator as described in pre vious sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safet y 
database (see the section on Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements ).
8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug
-Induced Liver Injury 
Abnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
levels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria 
outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury  are considered potential cases of 
drug-induced liver injury (p otential Hy ’s law cases) and should alway s be considered 
important medical events.  
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug- induced liver injury  
depends on the subject’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions. Subjects who 
present with the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory values:
Subjects with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range 
who subsequently  present with AST or AL T values3 times the upper limit of 
normal (X ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin value2 X ULN with no evidence 
of hemoly sis and an alkaline phosphatase value2X ULN or not available.
For subjects with preexisti ng AL TOR AST OR total bilirubin values above the 
upper limit of normal, the following threshold values should be used in the definition 
mentioned above:
For subjects with pre -existing AST or AL T baseline values above the normal 
range: AST or ALT 
2times the baseline values and  3 XULN, or 
8 XULN (whichever is smaller).
Concurrent with
For subjects with pre-existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: Total 
bilirubin level increased from baseline b y an amount of at least one time the upper
limit of normal orif the value reaches 3 times the upper limit of normal (whichever 
is smaller).
The subject should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal result s.  This evaluation should 
include laboratory  tests, detailed history  and phy sical assessment.  In addition to repeating 
measurements of AST and AL T, laboratory  tests should include albumin, creatine kinase, 
total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutamy l transferase, prothrombin time 
(PT)/international normalized ratio (I NR), and alkaline phosphatase.  A detailed history , 
including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen , recreational drug 
and supplement consumption, f amily  history , occupational exposure, sexual history , travel

hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary  tract) may  be warranted.  All 
cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria defined above, with no 
other cause for liver function test (L FT) abnormalities identified at the time sh ould be 
considered potential Hy ’s law cases irrespective of availability  of all the results of the 
investigations performed to determine etiology  of the abnormal LFTs.  Such potential Hy ’s 
law cases should be reported as SAEs.
8.6.Hospitalization
Hospitalizati on is defined as an y initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospital or 
equivalent healthcare facility  or any  prolongation of an existing admission.  Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, or neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).  An emergency  room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization; 
however, the event leading to the emergency  room visit should be assessed for medical 
importance.
Hospitalization does not include the following:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospice facilities;
Respite care ( eg,caregiver relief);
Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing homes;
Same day  surgeries (as outpatient/sam e day /ambulatory  procedures).
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, clinical 
AEis not in itself a nSAE .  Examples include: 
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
developm ent of a new AEor with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for 
work -up of persistent pre- treatment lab abnormality);
Social admission (e g, subject has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical exam ination );
Protocol -specified admission during a study  (eg,for a procedure required by  the study  
protocol);

Page 53Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE (eg,for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;
Pre-planne d treatments or surgical procedures .  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject.
Diagnostic and therapeutic non- invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as AEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis 
that begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulti ng 
appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the AE.
8.7.Severity Assessment
If required on the AEcase report forms (CRFs) , the investigator will use the adjectives 
MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the AE.  For 
purposes of 
consistency , these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function.
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE .  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAE s, listed above.
8.8.Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-
serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, and 
report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements if 
applicable.  An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility  that the investigational product caused or contrib uted to an 
AE; generally  the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be 
provided
.  If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused 
the event, then the event will be handled as “related to in vestigational product” for reporting 
purposes, as defined b y the Sponsor (see the Section on Reporting Requirements ).  If the 
investigator’s causalit y assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational product”, 
this should be clearl y documented on study records.
In addition, if the investigator determines thatanSAE is associated with study  procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable.

Page 548.9.Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  occurs if:
1.A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product; 
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact with 
a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has 
been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
2.A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy . 
If a stud y subject or study subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study subject’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this 
information to the Pfizer drug safet y unit on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) report f orm and 
Exposure During Pregnancy  (EDP) supplemental form, regardless of whether an SAE has 
occurred .  In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental 
exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject reports that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product b y inhalation or spil
lage) using the EDP 
supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and 
within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The information submitted should include the 
anticipated date of delivery  (see below for information rel ated to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  terminati on) and notify  Pfizer of the outcome as a follow-up 
to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity  of the 
neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for 
terminat ion should be specified and, if clinicall y possible, the structural integrity  of the 
terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless preprocedure test 
findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live born, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal dea th]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;

Page 55Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard 
to causality , as SAEs.  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as 
SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly  related to 
exposure to theinvestigational p roduct. 
Additional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy  may  be requested by  the 
investigator.  Further follow -
up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis 
(eg, follow -up on preterm infants to identify  developmental delay s). In the case of paternal 
exposure, the investigator will provide the study  subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of 
Information Form to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must document in the source 
documents that the subject was given the Pregn ant Partner Release of Information Form to 
provide to his partner.
8.10. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact w ith the 
product, which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.
An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safet y unitwithin 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness, using the SAE r eport form, regardless of whether there is an 
associated AE/SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , 
the information is not reported on a Case Report Form (CRF), however a copy  of the 
completed SAE r eport form is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See A lsotheSection 6.5 onSubject 
Withdrawal)
Withdrawal due to AE s should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AE CRF 
page.  
When a subject withdraws because of an SAE, the SAE must be reported in accordance with 
the reporting requirements defined below.
8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  reported b y 
the legally  acceptable representative of the study subject.  In addition, the study subject’s 
legally  acceptable representative will be questioned about AEs.
8.13. Reporting Requirements
Each AEis to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAE s.  If a nSAE occurs, 
expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.

Page 568.13.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If an SAE occurs, Pfizer is to be notified with in 24 hours of investigator awareness of the 
event.  
In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life-threatening, notification to Pfizer must be made 
immediately , irrespective of the extent of available AE information.  This timeframe also 
applies to additional new information (follow -up) on previously  forwarded SAE reports ,as 
well as to the initial and follow- up reporting of exposure during pregnancy ,exposure via 
breastfeeding ,and occupational exposure cases .  
In the rare event that the investigator does n ot become aware of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately  (eg, if an outpatient study  subject initially  seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time 
of his/her first awareness of the AE.
For all SAEs, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to Pfizer in 
accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an investigator 
may be requested by  Pfizer to obtain specific additional follo w-up information in an 
expedited fashion.  This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured 
on the AE CRF.  I n general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of 
possible causality .  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant 
medications, vaccines, and/or illnesses must be provided.  I n the case of a subject death, a 
summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its 
designated representative. 
8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF.  I t should be noted that the form for 
collection of SAE informat ion is not the same as the AECRF.  Where the same data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE
term should be used on both forms.  AEs should be reported using concise medical 
terminology  on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information.
8.13.3. Sponsor ’sReporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
Adverse event reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be 
carried out in accordance with applicable local re gulations.
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
A detailed methodolog y for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this trial 
will be documented in a Statistical Analy sis Plan, which will be dated and maintained by  the 
sponsor.  This documen t may  modify  the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any  major 
modifications of the primary  endpoint definition and/or its analy sis will also be reflected in a 
protocol amendment.

Page 579.1. Sample Size Determination
The primary statistical objective is to test for the superiority of iNO + sildenafil over iNO + 
placebo for time on iNO treatment after initiation of IV study drug treatment for subjects without treatment failures and for treatment failure rate.
Sample size for time on iNO for subjects without treatment failure is based on the  
 internal database (Feb 2012).  In the  database, there 
were 101-patients treated with iNO alone who were not treatment failures and met the following entry criteria of this proposed study: age ≤96 hours, gestational age ≥34 weeks, 
PPHN patients, 15 < OI <60 at baseline.  The mean (S.D.) time on iNO for those 101 patients was 3.4 (1.88) days.  It will be clinically relevant if subjects receiving iNO + Sildenafil have a 50% reduction in the time on iNO (ie, 1.7 days).
Sample size calculation for the treatment failure rate is based on the product label for 
iNOmax
®and the Pfizer PPHN study A1481157.  According to the product label of 
iNOmax®, the proportion of subjects who needed ECMO or died was 46% in the NINOS 
study and 33% in the CINRGI study.  Treatment failure rate of 40% for iNO alone is being used for sample size calculation for this study.
In Pfizer PPHN study A1481157, there were 29 subjects who were on iNO prior to study and 
had sildenafil added during the study.  Among the 29 subjects, 2 (7%) needed ECMO or died.  Treatment failure rate of 10% for iNO + sildenafil is being used for sample size calculation for this study.
Total of 64 subjects (32 for each arm) will be enrolled in the study.  Assuming 40% treatment 
failure rate in the iNO alone arm and 10% failure rate in the iNO+sildenafil arm:
•Time on iNO for subjects without treatment failure: 19 (59%) subjects in iNO alone 
vs. 29 (91%) subjects in iNO+ sildenafil will provide 85% power to detect a mean 
difference of 1.7 days for time on iNO, assuming mean of 3.4 days for iNO alone and population standard deviation of 1.88 days, at significance level of 0.05 from a 2-sided two sample t-test.
•Treatment failure rate: 32 subjects in each treatment will provide 80% power to detect 
an absolute difference of 30% (40% vs. 10%) at significance level of 0.05 (2-sided).
9.2. Efficacy Analysis
The intent-to-treat population (ITT) will consist of all randomized patients treated with study 
treatment.  Per-protocol population (PP) will consist of all randomized patients who complete the study according to the protocol without any major violations.  The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted using ITT population.  If PP population is <90% of the ITT population, then efficacy analyses will also be conducted using PP population as sensitivity analyses.
Efficacy analysis will only be conducted for Part A of the study.PPD

Page 58Analysis of the double-blind phase of the study (Part A) will be performed when all subjects 
have completed or discontinued from the double-blind phase, and a study report will be written.  Analysis of the non-interventional phase of the study (Part B) will be performed when all subjects have completed or discontinued from the 2-year follow-up visit, and a final study report will be written.
9.2.1. Analysis of Co-Primary Endpoint 
Time on iNO for subjects without treatment failures will be summarized for each treatment. 
If multiple iNO treatments are given to a subject, total time on iNO will be calculated for this endpoint for that subject.  Treatment comparison will be conducted using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for time on iNO treatment prior to randomization.  Mean treatment difference, its 95% confidence interval and p-value will be calculated.
Treatment failure rate and its 95% confidence interval will be calculated for each treatment 
group.  Treatment comparison will be conducted using either Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test whichever is appropriate.  Estimated treatment difference in rates, its 95% confidence interval and p-value will be calculated.
As the study will be conducted while subjects are treated in the hospitals, the chance of 
having missing data on primary endpoint is minimal.
9.2.2. Analysis of Secondary and 
For continuous endpoints, similar analyses (ANCOVA) conducted for time on iNO or 
2-sample t-test (no adjustment for baseline values) will be used.
For categorical endpoints, similar analyses conducted for treatment failure rate will be used. 
 
9.3. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic Analyses
A previously developed population PK model for sildenafil and its major metabolite 
UK-103,320 in PPHN patients
18will be applied to estimate the pharmacokinetic parameters,
using the plasma concentration time data of sildenafil and UK-103,320.  
 
  
The PK concentration-time data will be reported as part of the clinical study report (CSR).   
9.4. Safety Analysis
Safety analyses will be carried out for the ITT population only for both Part A and Part B of 
the study.  All adverse events will be coded and grouped by system organ class.  The incidence of each treatment emergent adverse event will be tabulated by treatment.  Tabulations by maximum severity and relationship to study treatment will also be included.CCI

9.6.Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)
This study  will use an External Data Mon itoring Committee (E -DMC ). 
The DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the efficacy  and safet y of subjects in 
the study  according to the Charter.  The recommendations made by  the E
-DMC to alter the 
conduct of the stud y will be forwarded to Pfize r for final decision.  Pfizer will forward such 
decisions, which may  include summaries of aggregate anal yses of endpoint events and of 
safet y data that are not endpoints, to regulatory  authorities, as appropriate.
The DMC will be independent of the study  team and will have no direct involvement in other
aspects of the trial.  The DMC will develop its own operation procedures in consultation with 
the sponsor which will be documented in the DMC charter.
Upon the completion of Part A of the stud y, the DMC will assess the need to continue to 
monitor the safet y data collected from Part B of the study .
The DMC will operate to the following rules:
The DMC will provide recommendations to the Pfizer project team .
The DMC will review unblinded critical efficacy  and sa fety data (adverse events, 
SAE reports) .
If the incidence and/or severity  of adverse events are clinicall y unacceptable then the 
DMC may  recommend the study  be terminated or a diffe rent dose of sildenafil be 
used.
If a significant modification to the study is recommended b y the DMC based on 
blinded data, the DMC Chair will request a confidential discussion with a Pfizer 
representative who is not part of the stud y team .
Details of possible stopping rules and operating procedures will be outlined in the DMC

Page 6010.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
During study  conduct, Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure 
that the protocol and Good Clinical Practices ( GCPs )are being followed.  The monitors may  
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate.  The 
investigator and institution will allow Pfizer monitors or its agents and appropriate regulatory  
authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.
The study  site may be subject to review b y the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/ Independent 
Ethics Committee (I EC), and/or to quality  assurance audits performed by  Pfizer, or 
companies working with or on behalf of Pfizer, and/or to inspection by  appropriate 
regulatory  authorities.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPING
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for ea ch included subject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from Pfizer.
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring that they  are accurate, authen tic / original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed by  the investigator or by  an authorized staff member to attest that the 
data contained on the CRFs 
aretrue. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source 
documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospital's or the ph ysician's subject chart.  In
these cases data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may  also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases, a document should be available at the investigator’s site as well as at Pfizer an d clearl y 
identify  those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document.

Page 6111.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory  authorities or Pfizer, the investigator 
agrees to keep records, in cluding the identity  of all participating subjects (sufficient 
information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed 
consent documents , copies of all CRFs, safety  reporting forms, source documents, and 
detailed records o f treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be 
retained b y the investigator according to International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH), 
local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study  Agreement (CSA) , whichever is 
longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospectiv ely notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer , such as another 
investigator, another institution, or to an independent third part y arranged by Pfizer. 
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 years af ter completion or 
discontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations. 
The investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.
12.ETHICS
12.1. Instit utional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, 
eg,recruitment ad vertisements, if applicable, from the I RB/IEC.  All correspondence with 
the IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File.  Copies of I RB/IEC approvals should 
be forwarded to Pfizer.
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/I EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/IEC and Pfizer in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirements, as well as 
the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical 
Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical 
Sciences 2002), Guidelines for GCP (ICH 1996), and the Declaration of Helsinki (World 
Medical Association 2008 and 1996 versions). 
In addition, the study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the ICHguideline 
on GCP , and applicabl e local regulatory  requirements and laws.

DRUG STORAGE INSTRUCTIONS
Investigat ional product must be stored between 15-250C under secure (locked) conditions.
The investigator, or an approved representative, eg, pharmacist, will ensure that all 
investigational products are stored in a secured area, under recommended storage condition s 
and in accordance with applicable regulatory  requirements.  Investigators and site staff are 
reminded to check and record temperatures daily  and ensure that thermometers are working 
correctly  as required for proper storage of investigational products.  T emperature Monitoring 
procedures and equipment should include the monitoring of minimum and maximum 
temperatures for awareness of potential temperature excursions at times when site staff are 
not actively  monitoring/recording temperatures.  If an excursion does occur please 
immediately  notify  the 
clinical research associate ( CRA )(unblinded CRA for unblinded 
investigational product and blinded CRA for blinded investigational product) todetermine 
the impact of the excursion.  The site should not use the supplies until a disposition is 
received from the CRA. The investigational product should continue to be stored in its 
appropriate location pending the disposition from Pfizer. If the materials are rejected, Pfizer 
will initiate a replacement shipment to th e site.
It is preferable that investigational product is destroy ed on -site following site documented 
standard operating procedure 
(SOP)/guidelines and according to local requirements.  
Destruction cannot take place before the CRA (unblinded CRA for unblind ed investigational 
product and blinded CRA for blinded investigational product)  performs reconciliation and 
has approved site destruction procedures.
Study  drug related to a product complaint must not be destroy ed locally  unless approval is 
given.

AUDIO LOGICAL EVALUATION
Audiological evaluations are to be conducted b y an audiologist and will include 
physiological tests of auditory  system function and behavioral tests of hearing sensitivity  
using developmentally appropriate methods suited to the individua lpatient and standardized
criteriafor the identification of auditory  system dysfunction and hearing loss .  Unless 
otherwise specified, all tests should be completed in both ears using the following specified 
procedures when possible; however, adjustments should be made for children that are unable 
to condition to or tolerate these procedures as defined.  All tests should be anal yzed using the 
following criteria. 
Physiological Tests
Tympanometry : tympanic membrane mobility , middle ear pressure, ear canal volume .
Acoustic (Stapedial) Reflex:  middle ear function, CNVIII and CNVII function .
Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE):  cochlear outer hair cell function .
Behavioral Test
Visual Reinforcement Audiometry  (VRA): hearing sensitivity .
Procedures
Tympanometry :  Performed using 226H ertz(Hz) probe tone .  
Acoustic (Stapedial) Reflex: Performed using 226Hz probe tone and 500Hz, 1000Hz, 
and 2000Hz ipsilateral stimulus .
Otoacoustic Emissions:  Performed using distortion product evoked emissions 
(DPOAE) in the 2000
-8000 Hz region or transient evoked emissions (TEOAE) in the 
1000-4000Hz region.
Behavioral Audiometry (VRA) :  Performed using air conduction pure tone or warble 
tone stimuli at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 and 8 .0 kHz under insert/ head phones or at 0.5, 1.0, 
2.0, and 4.0 k Hz in the soundfield and at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 k Hz under bone 
conduction when indicated.

Hypercompliant
ECV = ear canal volume;  daPa = dekapascal ;  mmho = millimho;  T PP = tympanometric peak pressure;  Ytm = 
static acoustic admittance;  
Acoustic (Stapedial) Reflex:  ≥ 0.03 ml deflection; reported presence or absence at 
each frequency  tested (Gelfand et al 1990)
Otoacoustic Emissions:  ≥ 6dB signal -to-noise ratio; reported presence or absence for 
each approximate F2 frequency region ( eg, 2000Hz) tested (Gorga et al 1997) 
Behavioral Audiometry (VRA) :  Reported in decibel hearing level (dB HL) and using 
the following criteria and hearing loss classifications  (modified, Clark 1981) 
A significant change in hearing or hearing loss is defined as: > 20 dB 
threshold shift at one frequency , >10 dB shift at two consecutive test 
frequencies, and/or a threshold shift to "no response" at three consecutive test 
frequencies. Change must be confirmed b y retest (ASHA 1994)
Definition Classification
≤ 20 dB HL Normal
21 -40 dB HL Mild
41 –70 dB HL Moderate
71 –90 dB HL Severe
≥ 90 dB HL  or no response Profound

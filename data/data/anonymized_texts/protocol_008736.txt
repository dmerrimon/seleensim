BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE: 39 
1. Achieving glycemic goals in type 2 diabetes has multiple beneficial health 40 
consequences. 41 
There are over 25 million patients with diabetes in the US [1], a disease with tremendous 42 
health, social, and economic implications. Studies like UKPDS [2, 3]  and Kumamoto [4, 43 
5] have established an undeniable link between hyperglycemia and micro- and even 44 
macrovascular complications. Such data serves as the background for the current 45 
glycemic targets recommended by the American Diabetes Association. Despite 46 
tremendous therapeutic advances and availability of numerous new classes of drugs in the 47 
past decade, more than a third of the population with diabetes, particularly in minority 48 
groups and those with lower level of education, still does not reach glycemic targets [6-49 
8]. Given the large epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes, our efforts to curb diabetes 50 
related morbidity and mortality have a whole new meaning and huge potential impact, 51 
both on patient related outcomes as well as cost of healthcare – a very timely concern for 52 
our healthcare system[9-11]. 53 
 54 
2. Treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes advocate insulin treatment for patients with a 55 
HbA1c>10%. 56 
Treatment guidelines for diabetes have been published by ADA/EASD [12] and AACE 57 
[13], with the purpose of providing guidance to healthcare providers caring for patients 58 
with type 2 diabetes and ensure best possible outcomes. Currently metformin is well 59 
accepted as the first line therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes in addition to lifestyle 60 
changes [2, 12-14]. There is no general agreement as to what is the best way to advance 61 
treatment in those who have not achieved target HbA1c levels with monotherapy [12, 62 
13]. The current ADA and AACE guidelines both recommend an individualized approach 63 
to treatment intensification which should take into consideration cost, patient’s 64 
preference, and profile of available medications [12, 13] It is generally accepted that 65 
patients with HbA1c level >10 % have a low probability of achieving ideal glycemic 66 
target of <7.0% with any of the traditional oral hypoglycemic agents, or even after basal 67 
insulin-only initiation. Therefore such patients will require prandial insulin, whether 68 
administered as a mixed formulation or basal-bolus regimen in order to archive glycemic 69 
goals [6, 12, 13, 15-26]. 70 
 71 
3. Insulin is a very effective glucose lowering agent, but it is associated with multiple 72 
side effects and shortcomings. 73 
Patients with a very elevated HbA1c (>10%) are traditionally thought to have more 74 
advanced disease [2, 6] as well as glucotoxicity [27, 28],  which coupled with the need to 75 
lower HbA1c by >3% to reach glycemic targets, make insulin an obvious treatment 76 
choice [15, 29]. Insulin is considered the most effective hypoglycemic agent and 77 
therefore capable of lowering HbA1c into target range regardless of baseline glycaemia 78 
[15]. Yet an insulin based treatment regimen, when implemented correctly and 79 
intensively, takes a significant toll on the patient’s lifestyle by requiring a higher 80 
commitment to disease management in the form of more frequent self-monitoring, 81 
multiple daily injections, requires more frequent dose adjustments, and a greater 82 
investment in insulin-related diabetes education [30, 31]. Furthermore, insulin treatment 83 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/2014 
 3is commonly associated with two most undesirable side effects: weight gain and 84 
hypoglycemia [30, 32]. 85 
 86 
4. Treatment-induced weight gain has a negative effect on the disease pathophysiology 87 
and fuels its progression. 88 
Most patients with diabetes are overweight and obese, development of which is often the 89 
initial event in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes [1, 33, 34]. Using therapeutic 90 
agents that focus primarily on blood glucose control but promote further weight gain 91 
seems counterintuitive, as this further worsens insulin resistance, which in turns results in 92 
an increase in insulin requirement, thus fueling a vicious cycle which promotes disease 93 
progression [35]. A Swedish study confirmed the deleterious effects of weight gain after 94 
diabetes diagnosis, as it demonstrated that patients with newly diagnosed diabetes who 95 
gain, rather than lose or maintain weight, are at a significantly increased risk of 96 
cardiovascular death [36]. 97 
 98 
5. Hypoglycemia is a common side effect of intensive insulin treatment and has far 99 
reaching consequences. 100 
Hypoglycemia has a greatly underestimated effect on patients’ life and beyond. Even 101 
seemingly minor hypoglycemic events create treatment related anxiety, heighten social 102 
anxiety, can limit or interfere with the patients’ professional and social life, and can lead 103 
to treatment noncompliance. Hypoglycemia, especially severe hypoglycemia, has also 104 
been associated with untoward medical consequences like dementia, cardiovascular risk, 105 
seizures, and even death [30]. It also carries a great financial burden both in direct cost 106 
related to the event, as well as indirect costs like lost wages and work absenteeism [31]. 107 
The effects of hypoglycemia reach beyond the patient, affecting the psychological, social, 108 
and financial well-being of the whole family [37]. 109 
 110 
6. We need treatment algorithms which are patient-centric and offer the best overall 111 
benefit, rather than a glucose-centric approach. 112 
With an ever increasing focus on personalized patient-centric treatment [12, 13], there is 113 
a renewed focus on patient-related outcomes, including treatment burden and quality of 114 
life. Insulin treatment requires an increased level of diabetes education, more intensive 115 
glycemic monitoring, a heightened awareness for potential side effects, a larger daily 116 
time commitment, all with potential negative effect on quality of life and treatment 117 
satisfaction [31, 37, 38]. The increase in treatment acuity related to insulin translates into 118 
higher healthcare related costs, a very timely concern for our economy [9-11, 31].  119 
 120 
7. GLP-1 agonist have pleiotropic effects which target the core pathophysiologic 121 
abnormalities in type 2 diabetes. 122 
GLP-1 agonists have been a relatively recent addition to our diabetes treatment 123 
armamentarium. They exert many beneficiary actions, counteracting many of the basic 124 
pathophysiologic determinants of diabetes: enhance glucose stimulated insulin secretion, 125 
suppress glucagon production, promotes satiety, decreases food intake, improves insulin 126 
sensitivity, lower ectopic fat deposition (i.e. liver steatosis, visceral fat), etc. GLP-1 127 
agonists lower HbA1c by 1.5-2%, have a very low risk of hypoglycemia, and promote 128 
weight loss – all very desirable effects in patients with type 2 diabetes [35]. While this 129 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/2014 
 4treatment does require an injection, it is very easy to use, does not require continuous 130 
treatment titration, and greatly reduces the need for frequent glucose self-monitoring. All 131 
these attributes make it quite an appealing treatment alternative for patients with type 2 132 
diabetes. In the current diabetes treatment guidelines it is recommended as a second or 133 
third line agent after metformin failure. 134 
 135 
8. The combination of basal insulin and GLP-1 agonists has been proven to be safe and 136 
very effective. 137 
A meta-analysis of pooled data from across the LEAD program demonstrated that in 138 
patients with baseline HbA1c of > 9%  liraglutide was better than glargine as an add on to 139 
oral hypoglycemic medications with average reduction in HbA1c of 1.9% [39]. Several 140 
other studies support equal or superior HbA1c reduction when a GLP-1 agonist is added 141 
to  background therapy and compared to basal insulin, with the additional benefit of 142 
weight loss and minimal hypoglycemia [40-43]. GLP-1 agonist has also demonstrated 143 
superiority when added to maximized basal insulin therapy and metformin, when 144 
compared to prandial insulin alone [40, 44-48]. Furthermore, treatment with GLP-1 145 
agonist in combination with basal insulin was shown to have a synergistic effect on 146 
glycemic control, with GLP-1 agonists exerting an insulin sparing effect, as well as 147 
ameliorating or eliminating the undesirable weigh gain associated with insulin therapy. 148 
 149 
The current evidence suggests the combination of metformin, GLP-1 agonist, and basal 150 
insulin to be the most effective and simple strategy to achieve near normal glycemia in 151 
patients with a baseline HbA1c < 10%, while avoiding the side effects of weight gain, 152 
complexity of care, and  hypoglycemia associated with insulin alone, or post-prandial 153 
hyperglycemia, weight gain, and hypoglycemia from the association of basal insulin to 154 
orals agents [40, 41, 43-48]. It is still not known whether these favorable effects extent to 155 
the more challenging group of patients with type 2 diabetes who have a baseline HbA1c 156 
>10%. Liraglutide reduces blood glucose by several mechanisms independent of insulin 157 
secretion and its superior effect on HbA1c and weight loss was found to be largely 158 
independent of diabetes duration and baseline HbA1c [39]. Treatment with GLP-1 159 
agonists has also been associated with low secondary failure rates, durable and sustained 160 
long term blood glucose control, and durability of the initial weight loss [39, 42, 49].  161 
 162 
Given all these distinct properties of GLP-1 agonists and simplicity of use, we 163 
propose they could represent a viable alternative to intensive insulinization in 164 
patients with very uncontrolled (HbA1c >10%) type 2 diabetes. 165 
 166 
The aim of this study is to compare a GLP-1 plus basal insulin treatment regimen to a 167 
basal-bolus treatment regimen in patients with very uncontrolled (HbA1c>10%) type 2 168 
diabetes. We will compare the two regimens with respect to efficacy in improving 169 
glycemic control, rate of hypoglycemia, change in weight, effect on patient quality of 170 
life, treatment burden, physician time, as well as healthcare related cost. We hypothesize 171 
that the two treatment regimens will have equal effectiveness, while the GLP-1 based 172 
regimen will be superior with respect to all other variables.  173 
 174 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/2014 
 5We chose to focus on a specific patient population which is generally considered to be 175 
most challenging to manage, use up greater heathcare resources, have higher potential for 176 
morbidity, and have traditionally been excluded from most clinical trials. Therefore this 177 
study will fill in an existing knowledge gap and provide high level evidence for future 178 
diabetes treatment guidelines pertaining to this patient population. We will obtain 179 
information not only in regards to the effectiveness of the treatment, but also safety and 180 
impact on healthcare cost beyond the cost of the drug.  181 
 182 
Our findings will have great impact on the way we treat this – unfortunately – significant 183 
segment of the diabetic population, with huge potential benefits beyond just glycemic 184 
control, including quality of life, other metabolic co-morbidities, healthcare cost, etc. 185 
Additionally, if our proposed alternative regimen proves to be superior, this would 186 
represent a simple treatment alternative that primary care physicians can easily initiate 187 
and manage in their office, mitigating the need for referral to the specialist – representing 188 
a further healthcare cost control in addition to that observed in our study and a small step 189 
in alleviating the huge shortage of endocrinologists nationwide. 190 
 191 
We are uniquely positioned to perform this study for multiple reasons: (1) we serve 192 
the largest county hospital in the US where this specific study population is greatly 193 
overrepresented; (2) our county hospital is a closed healthcare system, where all 194 
actual health-care related costs incurred by these patients can be readily captured; 195 
(3) the PI (and sub-I) have extensive clinical experience with this study population; 196 
(4) the PI has extensive clinical research experience, with proven track record of 197 
successfully designing clinically relevant studies and caring out to final completion 198 
even the most challenging research protocols. 199 
 200 
 201 
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES: 202 
We plan to evaluate a new GLP-1 based treatment strategy for patients with very 203 
uncontrolled (HbA1c>10%) type 2 diabetes and compare it to a standard basal-bolus 204 
insulin regimen. 205 
 206 
Primary Specific Aim: To determine the non-inferiority of the basal insulin-GLP-1 207 
agonist combination therapy to full basal-bolus insulin combination therapy in patients 208 
with very uncontrolled (HbA1c>10%) type 2 diabetes. 209 
 210 
Specific aims: 211 
1. Compare the two treatment regimens with respect to a disease and patient- 212 
relevant composite outcome of effectiveness (HbA1c <7%) and safety (no 213 
hypoglycemia and no weight gain); 214 
2. Compare the two treatment regimens with respect to treatment burden (number of 215 
daily shots, amount of glucose self-monitoring, need for treatment titration); 216 
3. Compare the two treatment regimens with respect to quality of life [as measured 217 
by a disease specific (DQOL) questionnaire and general heath (SF-36) 218 
questionnaire]; 219 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/2014 
 64. Compare the two treatment regimens with respect to all healthcare related costs: 220 
actual cost of the pharmacologic agents, glucose monitoring supplies, all other 221 
pharmacologic (non-study related) and non-pharmacologic healthcare related 222 
costs (outpatient and inpatient, diabetes related and non-diabetes related). We will 223 
also compare actual physician time spent during office visits and non-visit related 224 
care of these patients. While no actual dollar amount can be attached to this 225 
(phone visits and longer office visits required by the need for extra patient 226 
education are not customarily reimbursable) time commitment is of great 227 
relevance to our physicians who care for these very complex patients. 228 
 229

Change in HbA1c from randomization to 26 weeks of therapy. 231 
 232

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS 269 
Study type: 270 
 Single Center (UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, TX) 271 
 Randomized 272 
 Single blind (evaluator) 273 
 Two treatment arms (treatment and control) 274 
 Length of intervention: 6 months 275 
 Efficacy & safety trial 276 
 Non-inferiority trial for primary outcome 277 
 278 
Study Design:  279 
We will conduct a prospective, randomized, single blind, two-arm, parallel trial 280 
comparing two treatment regimens (liraglutide, detemir, and metformin versus aspart, 281 
detemir, and metformin) in patients with very uncontrolled (HbA1c>10%) type 2 282 
diabetes. The investigator performing the study related measurements will be blinded to 283 
the patients’ treatment assignment. 284

The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Institutional Review Board will 290 
review the study and approve all relevant documents. Furthermore, study approval will be 291 

U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/2014 
 8obtained from Parkland Health and Hospital System (PHHS), which represents the study 292 
site. 293 
 294 
Rationale for study Design  295 
 The randomized design, with stratification for pertinent variables, will allow us to 296 
fully compare the effects of the two treatment algorithms in this hard to treat 297 
patient population. 298 
 A 3-7 day run-in period was introduced in order to ensure patient compliance with 299 
study procedures prior to randomization. 300 
 The patient-guided titration schedule for basal insulin is well validated in the 301 
literature and should help to lower fasting glucose level within a shorter period of 302 
time. 303 
 A 6-month intervention period was chosen as nadir HbA1c after initiation of a 304 
treatment regimen is achieved by this time, therefore allowing us to evaluate the 305 
full effectiveness of these interventions.  306

 353 
Rationale for Study Population 354 
Patients who have a very elevated HbA1c (>10%) are thought to have significant glucose 355 
and lipotoxicity and the current guidelines recommend initiation of a full insulin regimen. 356 
This is a difficult to treat population, as they generally have more advanced disease, less 357 
beta-cell reserve, and, often time, poor compliance. Finding a simpler, safer, and effective 358 
treatment algorithm for these patients would have a great impact on the rate of 359 
comorbidities, as well as healthcare cost. This is also a population traditionally excluded 360 
from all regulatory studies, therefore little information is available on how to best 361 
approach their treatment. 362 
 363 
Rationale for Study Location 364 
Only patients from the PHHS system will be recruited. PHHS is a county hospital that 365 
provides comprehensive care (primary, specialty, inpatient and outpatient) to the indigent 366 
population of Dallas County. EPIC is the electronic medical record that is deployed at all 367 
sites and covers all aspects of care, including financial data. Therefore PHHS is the ideal 368 
location to conduct this study, as all patient-related information is captured and can be 369 
queried at multiple levels, including cost. 370 
 371 
Randomization Criteria 372 
1. Patient returned a fully completed 7-point glucose profile – suggesting likely 373 
compliance with proposed study procedures. 374 
 375 
Withdrawal Criteria 376 
1. The subject may withdraw consent at any time. 377 
2. Severe drug-related side effects including (but not limited to) acute pancreatitis, 378 
severe nausea and/or vomiting, renal failure, diagnosis of medullary thyroid 379 
cancer, or hypersensitive to any study drug.   380 
3. Pregnancy or intention of becoming pregnant. 381 
4. Subject’s diabetes control remains unchanged or becomes worse. 382 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/2014 
 105. Subject participation in the research is no longer safe 383 
6. The researchers believe that other treatment may be more helpful. 384 
7. The sponsor or the FDA stops the research for the safety of the participants. 385 
8. The sponsor cancels the research. 386 
9. Subject is unable to keep appointments or to follow the researcher’s instructions. 387 
 388 
Subject Replacement 389 
Subjects who withdraw or become ineligible will not be replaced. A drop-out rate of 12% 390 
is estimated and already calculated in the recruitment plan. 391 
 392 
Study Schedule 393 
Recruitment: 394 
We will recruit patients from the following locations within the PHHS: emergency room 395 
(only if discharged home after the evaluation), primary care clinics, any specialty clinic 396 
(including diabetes clinic). Eligible patients will be informed about the trial by their 397 
treating physician. If agreeable, they will be contacted by the study staff and a screening 398 
appointment scheduled as soon as feasible (within days).  399 
 400 
Screening Visit (visit 1): 401 
During the screening visit patients will complete the informed consent process and will 402 
undergo a complete assessment for all inclusion and exclusion criteria. A complete 403 
medical history and comprehensive physical examination will be performed. Blood will 404 
be drawn (if not done within the past 7 days) to assess for all eligibility criteria (HbA1c, 405 
creatinine, liver function tests and pregnancy test, if applicable). Patients will receive an 406 
identification card with information about participation in the study. Patients will be 407 
asked to complete a 7-point glucose profile on the day prior to their next visit. 408 
 409 
Randomization (visit 2):  410 
Randomization will occur at the second visit (3-7 days from visit 1-screening). The study 411 
statistician will generate a blocked randomization scheme (1:1) stratified by “any insulin 412 
treatment at time of screening” (yes/no) and BMI (cutoff 37 kg/m2 – the average BMI of 413 
this study population in our PHHS Diabetes Clinic). 414 
 415 
At this visit we will obtain a full baseline evaluation of all outcome parameters. All 416 
patients will meet with the dietician to received education regarding recommended 417 
lifestyle modifications. Patient will undergo diabetes education as well as teaching 418 
regarding insulin injection and titration. 419 
 420 
Phone follow-up/ Drug titration visit: 421 
At 2-wk from randomization (visit 3) a phone visit will take place to assess for safety 422 
parameters (particularly hypoglycemia) and perform protocol-driven treatment titration. 423 
 424 
Follow-up visits:  425 
At 1-, 3-, and 6-months (visits 4, 5, 6) patients will be followed-up in person for interim 426 
(and end of study, respectively) evaluations of all outcome parameters, as well as 427 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/2014 
 11protocol-driven treatment titration. A 7-point glucose profile will be repeated prior to the 428 
last visit in the study. 429 
 430 
Interventions: 431 
Both groups will either continue or initiate treatment with metformin. To minimize 432 
gastrointestinal side effects metformin will be initiated at 500 mg daily (or continued at 433 
current dose) and titrated weekly in 500 mg increments to the final dose of 1000 mg 434 
twice daily (or maximum tolerated dose which should be at least 500 mg BID). 435 
 436 
Both groups will be initiated on basal insulin detemir. If new to insulin, this will be 437 
started at 0.3 units/kg once daily at bedtime and self-titrated based on the study protocol 438 
(see detemir patient self-titration table). If already on basal insulin, will take the total 439 
daily dose of basal insulin and perform a 1:1 dose conversion  to insulin detemir, which 440 
will be administered once daily at bedtime, followed by the same titration. Additionally, 441 
physician-directed titration will occur, if needed, during the scheduled phone and/or 442 
office visits, as well as any unscheduled patient-initiated visits (phone/in person, if 443 
applicable). All patients new to insulin will be seen by the diabetes educator to receive 444 
instruction in insulin injection techniques. 445

 448 
Patients randomized to liraglutide will stop any insulin products besides detemir (if 449 
applicable), initiate liraglutide at 0.6 mg/day, and  dose escalate weekly to 1.2 mg/dl and 450 
final dose of 1.8 mg/dl. Patients who develop significant and persistent gastrointestinal 451 
side effects  are allowed to down-titrate  the dose of liraglutide to 1.2 mg/dl  for 1 week 452 
or until the side effect resolve.   453 
 454 
Patients randomized to meal-time insulin will initiate insulin aspart before each meal. 455 
Aspart insulin will be initiated at a dose of 0.3 units/kg/day divided among the number of 456 
meals taken daily. Meal-time insulin titration, if needed, can be either patient driven (see 457 
table below) or physician-directed during the scheduled follow-up visits (phone or in 458 
person), as well as any unscheduled patient-initiated visits (if applicable). 459

Should any patients randomized to liraglutide treatment experience persistent 464 
hyperglycemia (defined as a confirmed Hb1c>10%) at the 3-mo visit (visit 5), meal-time 465 
insulin aspart will be initiated per the same protocol as above. This is a pre-specified 466 
“treatment failure” end-point. Following initiation of rescue therapy patients will 467 
continue all scheduled visits and procedures through the end of the trial. 468 
 469 
Should any patients randomized to the “standard of care” group experience persistent 470 
hyperglycemia (defined as a confirmed HbA1c >10%) at the 3-mo visit (visit 5), 471 
treatment and insulin titration will continue as scheduled. This is also a pre-specified 472 
“treatment failure” end-point. 473

Dietary Modifications: 477 
Counseling regarding the type and amount of food consumed with strong encouragement 478 
to count carbohydrates and/or calories will be performed for all patients by the dietitian at 479 
visit 2 and investigator at visits 3-5. 480 
 481 
Lifestyle Modifications: 482 
All patients will receive recommendations regarding type/amount/intensity of physical 483 
activity and be provided future goals at visit 1. Reinforcement of these objectives will 484 
take place at visits 2-5.  485 
 486 
Assessments for Efficacy 487 
1. HbA1c – measured at screening, visit 5 (3-months) and end of study (6 months). 488 
Samples are processed immediately and stored at 0-5°C. It will be analysed within 24 489 
hrs at the UT Southwestern Medical Centre Diabetes laboratory using an HPLC 490 
technique. The laboratory is accredited by the National Glycohemoglobin 491 
Standardization Program. HbA1c interassay coefficient of variability is ≤2%, and the 492 
intra-assay variability is ≤0.3%.  493 
2. Weight - will be measured at each office visit using the same calibrated digital scale, 494 
while patients wearing no shoes and only light clothing. 495 
3. Total daily insulin dose – will be calculated in units/kg at each visit by summing all 496 
insulin shots of all types over a 24 hrs period. The average of the 3 most recent 24 hrs 497 
prior to each visit will be used. 498 
4. Number of daily injections – will be counted at each visit, by adding all shots 499 
regardless of the type of insulin. The average of the 3 most recent 24 hrs prior to each 500 
visit will be used. 501 
5. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure - will be measured in sitting position using an 502 
Omron digital manometer, on the right arm, after 5 minutes of rest. 503 
6. Lipid profile, liver function test, haemoglobin - will be collected at screening, 3- 504 
months, and end of study in fasting state. The blood will be processed and analysed 505 
immediately by PHHS Clinical Laboratory. 506 
7. 7-point glucose measurement – will be performed by the patient on the day prior to 507 
the randomization visit and prior to the end-of-study visit. 508 
8. Frequency of glucose monitoring – will be assessed by downloading the glucose 509 
monitor. Average number of readings/day will be recorded at each visit. 510 
  511 
Assessments for Safety 512 
All safety assessments are performed at each visit, in person or by phone. Any 513 
unanticipated or serious adverse events will be reported to the local IRB and  FDA in 514 
accordance with local guidelines. 515 
 516 
1. Hypoglycemia – All plasma glucose values ≤ 70 mg/dL, as well as values >70 517 
mg/dL when hypoglycemic symptoms have occurred, should be recorded by the 518 
subjects in the blood glucose diaries provided at each visit. The recording should 519 
include: 520 
• date of hypoglycemic episode 521 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/2014 
 14• time of hypoglycemic episode 522 
• time of last main meal prior to episode 523 
• whether the episode was symptomatic 524 
• whether the episode was in relation to exercise 525 
• whether seizure or coma developed 526 
•  whether the subject was able to treat him/herself 527 
• the plasma glucose level before treating the episode 528 
 529 
The following definitions for hypoglycemia will be used: 530 
• Mild- Symptomatic or asymptomatic hypoglycemia with blood glucose 56-69 531 
mg/dl and subject was able to treat him/herself 532 
• Moderate- Symptomatic or asymptomatic hypoglycemia with blood glucose <56 533 
mg/dl and subject was able to treat him/herself  534 
• Severe- Blood sugar <70 mg/dl or symptoms highly suggestive of hypoglycemia 535 
and the subject needed assistance to be treated with carbohydrates, glucagon, or 536 
other resuscitative actions 537 
• Nocturnal hypoglycaemia- blood glucose <70 with a time of onset between 00:01 538 
and 05:59 (both included) 539 
• Relative Hypoglycemia- Blood glucose >69 mg/dl with symptoms highly 540 
suggestive of hypoglycemia 541 
• Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia- Symptoms highly suggestive of 542 
hypoglycemia but subject did not measure blood glucose.  543 
 544 
2. Other treatment specific side effects 545 
• Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and headache; 546 
• Abdominal pain suspicious for pancreatitis would prompt immediate physician 547 
evaluation and laboratory testing for amylase and lipase measurement which 548 
would be processed immediately and analysed by PHHS Clinical Laboratory.  549 
3. Pregnancy Test- females of childbearing potential will have urine pregnancy test 550 
(human chorionic gonadotropin, hCG) performed if clinically indicated in the 551 
assessment of the investigator. Urine-stick pregnancy test will be performed for 552 
females of childbearing potential at any time during the trial, if a menstrual period is 553 
missed or if the participant voices concern. 554 
 555 
Other Assessments 556 
Treatment satisfaction and quality of life will be assessed at the randomization visit (Visit 557 
2) and end of study (Visit 6) using a modified DQoL and SF-36 questionnaires.  Total 558 
score as well as individual domain scores will be analysed and reported. 559 
 560 
Subject Compliance: Participants will bring all study medication to each appointment for 561 
review and study drug will be distributed at each appointment (visit 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). 562 
Percent compliance will be calculated and recorded at each visit. 563 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/2014 
 15 564 
Healthcare Cost Assessment: At the conclusion of the study, the EPIC integrated medical 565 
record system will be queried for the data regarding all healthcare related expenditures. 566 
From this information a data subset of diabetes-related expenditure will also be reported.  567 
 568 
Physician Time Assessment: Each physician interaction (office visit or phone visit) will 569 
be timed to compare the two treatment regimens with respect to burden on healthcare 570 
provider’s time. 571

 573 
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PARTICIPATION IN THE STUDY: 574 
Risks of Liraglutide: 575 
  576 
Very common (reported by more than 10 percent  of the patients): 577 
 -  Gastrointestinal adverse events are the most common side effect of liraglutide 578 
and reported in up to 41% of patients. Nausea is seen in approximately 13% of 579 
patients treated with liraglutide and is usually developed in the first 2 weeks. It 580 
tends to be mild, dose-related and decline over time. In some patients the nausea 581 
can be more severe and be associated with vomiting which is usually transient 582 
and self-resolving. 583 
 584 
Common (reported by 5-10 percent of the patients) 585 
 Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) - - The risk of having hypoglycemia with 586 
liraglutide is higher if taking it with another medicine that can cause 587 
hypoglycemia, such as a sulfonylurea or insulin. In some people, the blood 588 
glucose may get so low that they need another person to help them. The dose of 589 
your sulfonylurea medicine or insulin may need to be lowered while using 590 
liraglutide.  591 
 Headache and upper respiratory tract infections have been reported in 7-9% of 592 
patients treated with liraglutide. A similar percentage of patients developed 593 
headaches with placebo or comparator drug.  594 
 595 
Uncommon side effects (reported by 1-5 percent of the patients):  596 
 Injection site reactions (e.g., injection site rash, erythema) were reported in 597 
approximately 2% of liraglutide treated patients in the five clinical trials of at 598 
least 26 weeks duration. Less than 0.2% of liraglutide-treated patients 599 
discontinued due to injection site reactions. 600 
 601 
Very rare  side effects (affects less than 1 percent of patients)  602 
 Acute pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) - there have been few reported 603 
event of acute pancreatitis presenting with persistent severe abdominal pain 604 
(usually accompanied by vomiting). Patients  experiencing the above symptoms 605 
should contact the  study doctor who will decide on whether they should 606 
discontinue the trial medication and /or require additional diagnostic procedures. 607 
 Rarely, a severe form of allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction) with additional 608 
symptoms such as breathing problems, swelling of throat and face, fast heart beat 609 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/2014 
 16etc. has been reported with marketed use of Liraglutide. Patients experiencing 610 
these symptoms  should seek immediate medical help and inform the  trial doctor 611 
as soon as possible.  612 
 Kidney failure – Liraglutide may cause nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, leading to 613 
loss of fluids (dehydration). Dehydration may cause kidney failure which can 614 
lead to the need for dialysis. This can happen in people who have never had 615 
kidney problems before. Drinking plenty of fluids may reduce the risk of 616 
dehydration.  617 
 618 
Other potential risks related to liraglutide: 619 
 Hyperglycemia  (too high blood glucose) can occur, especially if there is 620 
insufficient treatment. . The symptoms of hyperglycemia include increased 621 
urination, feeling thirsty, losing appetite, feeling sick (nausea or vomiting), 622 
feeling drowsy or tired, flushed, dry skin, dry mouth and a fruity (acetone) smell 623 
of the breath. If not treated, these symptoms may develop into a serious condition 624 
called diabetic ketoacidosis which may even lead to death.  625 
 Thyroid tumors, including cancer -During the drug testing process, the medicine 626 
in Victoza caused rats and mice to develop tumors of the thyroid gland. Some of 627 
these tumors were cancers. It is not known if Victoza will cause thyroid tumors 628 
or a type of thyroid cancer called medullary thyroid cancer in people. If 629 
medullary thyroid cancer occurs, it may lead to death if not detected and treated 630 
early. If you develop tumors or cancer of the thyroid, your thyroid may have to 631 
be surgically removed. Fibrosarcomas (cancer underneath the skin) were seen at 632 
the point of injection (skin) in male mice that underwent a 2 year study of 633 
liraglutide. These fibrosarcomas were attributed to the high local concentration 634 
of drug near the injection site. The liraglutide concentration in the preparation 635 
used for humans is 10 times higher than the concentration used in mice. It is not 636 
known if liraglutide will cause fibrosarcomas in people. 637 
 638 
Risk of insulin detemir and aspart:  639 
 640 
Very common (1-10 in 100 patients): 641 
 Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is the most common adverse reaction of insulin 642 
therapy and may be life- threatening if severe and not treated appropriately. 643 
 Mild-moderate weight gain is expected with any insulin therapy 644 
 645 
Less common (less than 1 in 100 patients): 646 
 Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur 647 
with any insulin products, including detemir insulin or aspart insulin. 648 
 Other adverse reactions associated with detemir insulin and/or aspart insulin 649 
include injection site reactions, lipohypertrophy, rash, itching. 650 
 Needles and insulin pens should never be shared. 651 
 652 
Risk of Metformin:  653 
 654 
Very common (1-10 in 100 patients): 655 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/2014 
 17• Abdominal or stomach discomfort 656 
• Decreased appetite 657 
• Diarrhea 658 
• Bloating 659 
• Low serum Vitamin B12 levels without clinical manifestations 660 
 661 
Precautions:  662 
 Lactic Acidosis: Lactic acidosis is a very rare, but serious, metabolic complication 663 
that can occur due to Metformin accumulation during treatment with Metformin 664 
HCl; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis 665 
may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, 666 
including diabetes mellitus.  Metformin should be discontinued immediately and 667 
health care provider should be promptly notifed if unexplained increase in 668 
breathing rate, muscle aches, fatigue and unusual somnolence occur. 669 
 Patients with Renal disease or renal dysfunction (e.g., as suggested by eGRF <30 670 
ml/min) should not use metformin 671 
 Metformin should be temporarily discontinued 48h prior to radiologic studies 672 
involving intravascular administration of iodinated contrast materials 48h prior to 673 
procedure to avoid increased risk of development of lactic acidosis and restarted 674 
24h after the procedure. 675 
 Excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic should be avoided while 676 
receiving Metformin. 677 
 678 
SAFEGUARDS AND PRECAUTIONS TO MINIMIZE RISKS/HARMS: 679 
 Hypoglycaemia episodes will very closely monitored trough the study using self- 680 
glucose monitoring. Review of blood glucose diary and hypoglycaemic events 681 
will be discussed during office, phone visits and as needed. Patient will be 682 
instructed during randomization visit on how to proper handle mild, moderate and 683 
severe hypoglycemic episodes and how to reduce their basal insulin doses 684 
according to study protocol. Those instructions will be reinforced as needed 685 
during the study.  686 
 687 
 Should any patients randomized to liraglutide treatment experience persistent 688 
hyperglycemia (defined as Hb1c>10%) at the 3-mo visit (visit 5), meal-time 689 
insulin aspart will be initiated per the same protocol as the standard group 690 
 691 
 Should any patients randomized to the “standard of care” group  experience 692 
persistent hyperglycemia (defined as HbA1c>10%) at the 3-mo visit (visit 5), 693 
treatment and insulin titration will continue as scheduled.    694 
 695 
 Patients will be monitored closely for any drug-related side effects. They will be 696 
provided with instruction on when to call the PI and a direct phone line, so they 697 
can immediately report any problems or concerns. Instructions will be given on 698 
possible side effects and how to avert/minimize them. 699 
 700 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/2014 
 18 Only qualified personnel will perform blood draws to minimize the risk of 701 
complications. 702 
 703 
 Patients are allowed to skip questions on the questionnaire should they feel that 704 
the question might pose a psychological burden.      705 
 706 
 707 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS: 708 
Sample Size Calculation 709 
We propose to test a non-inferiority hypothesis comparing the 6-month change from 710 
baseline in HbA1c between the two treatment groups, with a non-inferiority margin of 711 
0.4%. We conservatively estimate the standard deviation of the difference at 0.5% based 712 
on results from reported studies with similar design[44, 45, 47]. Using a one-sided alpha 713 
of 0.025, we determine that 44 subjects per group completing 6 months will provide 714 
power 0.96 to test this non-inferiority hypothesis, shown below amongst with other 715 
scenarios (Hintze, J. (2011). PASS 11. NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, Utah, USA. 716 
www.ncss.com ). We will need to randomize 100 patients to test this hypothesis assuming 717 
a 12% drop-out rate (estimated drop-out rate based on our extensive prior experience 718 
with similar population and length of study). We plan to screen 120 patients to account 719 
for approximately 20% anticipated screen failures. 720

Further, this sample size will yield at least 80% power at two-sided alpha=0.05, 723 
superiority hypothesis, for the secondary composite outcome endpoint of HbA1c<7% 724 
with no hypoglycemia and no significant weight gain, expecting that 25% and 5% reach 725 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/2014 
 19this endpoint with liraglutide treatment and standard basal-bolus insulin treatment, 726 
respectively. 727 
 728 
Randomization  729 
Treatment assignment will occur at the second visit. The study statistician will generate a 730 
blocked randomization scheme (1:1) stratified by “any insulin treatment at time of 731 
screening” (yes/no) and BMI (cutoff 37 kg/m2 – the average BMI of this study 732 
population in our PHHS Diabetes Clinic), programmed using SAS Proc Plan. 733 
 734 
Statistical Analysis Plan 735 
All statistical analyses will be performed by the study statistician (Beverley Huet), who 736 
has extensive experience in clinical trials analysis.  737 
Primary analysis: The primary analysis will be intention-to-treat (ITT) which will include 738 
all randomized participants who receive at least one dose of a study medication.  The 739 
non-inferiority of liraglutide treatment strategy compared to standard basal-bolus insulin 740 
regimen will be assessed using a 95% confidence interval for the between treatment 741 
group net difference (month 6 minus month 0) in HbA1c at 6 months. This 95% 742 
confidence interval will be derived from the differences of least square means estimated 743 
from a mixed model repeated measures analysis. Non-inferiority of liraglutide treatment 744 
will be concluded if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval is less than the non-745 
inferiority margin of 0.4%.    746 
 747 
Secondary analyses:  We will also perform a per-protocol analysis comparing HbA1c 748 
response because, in non-inferiority hypothesis testing, the ITT analysis may be biased 749 
toward the null hypothesis. The per-protocol population is defined as the population who 750 
continued the assigned intervention as randomized for the duration of the study period. 751 
Secondary outcomes include the composite endpoint of HbA1c<7% with no 752 
hypoglycemia and no significant weight gain, a binary variable, which will be compared 753 
between the randomized study groups with a logistic regression model. The odds ratio 754 
and corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be reported.  From healthcare related 755 
cost data, cost-effectiveness ratios will be summarized as point estimates with 95% 756 
confidence intervals, accounting for the skewness in the distribution of the ratio[50]. 757 
Sensitivity cost analyses will be performed to further assess variables such as treatment 758 
failure and quality of life weights. Multiple logistic regression models will be constructed 759 
to evaluate any association of baseline covariates on treatment efficacy.   Binary 760 
secondary endpoints will also be assessed with logistic regression models. Group 761 
comparisons and changes from baseline over time (study visits) of continuous secondary 762 
outcome variables will be analysed with mixed model repeated analysis. The logrank test 763 
will be used to compare the pre-specified “treatment failure” end-point between groups.  764 
Safety endpoints and hypoglycemic and other adverse events will summarize in detail 765 
with descriptive statistics. The analysis of safety data will be performed for the ITT 766 
population. 767 
Model assumptions regarding normality and covariance structure will be carefully 768 
assessed. Nonparametric tests or data transformations will be used if necessary to meet 769 
assumptions. Statistical analysis will be performed with SAS software (SAS Institute, 770 
Cary NC), particularly Proc Mixed for linear models with both fixed and random effects. 771

Interim Analysis 774 
No interim analysis is planned. 775 
 776 
DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING: 777 
All data will be collected in strict compliance with the University’s HIPPA rules. 778 
Research records (source documents) will be kept in a double-locked filing system in a 779 
secure locked room.  Collected data will be stored in an electronic study database will be 780 
encrypted and password protected and saved on the University’s secure network.  Only 781 
study personnel will have access to these records. 782 
 783 
The institutional review board (IRB) governing this study may inspect the medical 784 
records of any patient involved in this study at any time. 785 
 786 
Laboratory specimens will be collected under standard of care protocol at Parkland 787 
hospital laboratory and handled in accordance with the hospital policy.  788 
 789 
The study blind will be maintained by the designated statistician and only broken by 790 
request from a treating physician in case of a medical emergency. 791 
 792 
ETHICS: 793 
Ethical Considerations: 794 
1. Exclusion of non-English speakers- while translators are available during working 795 
hours, the investigators are worried that no translator will be available to assure 796 
safety measures at all times. 797 
2. Compliance with Insulin Regimen- At times patients are not compliant with 798 
complicated insulin regimens and providers often continue to uptitrate insulin 799 
dosage when patients remain above HbA1c goal.  If patient compliance improves 800 
once enrolled in the study, there is a higher risk of hypoglycemia.  Every effort 801 
will be made at all visits to determine exactly what amount of insulin the patient 802 
is taking and the overall compliance. 803 
 804 
Informed Consent: 805 
Informed consent will be obtained during the first face-to-face contact.  Once a 806 
prospective subject is identified, we will explain the study details and preliminary 807 
eligibility is accessed either through phone or face-to-face interview.  If the prospective 808 
volunteer remains interested in the study and fulfils preliminary eligibility criteria, 809 
baseline studies are scheduled.  Only study personnel listed on the consent will be 810 
permitted to obtain consent.  The subject will be provided informed consent and it will be 811 
signed and witnessed.  The consent form will discuss the procedures to be performed at 812 
each visit, the number of visits, and what is expected of the patient, along with all 813 
possible side effects.  A copy will be given to the subject and the original will be kept on 814 
file.  Potential subjects may be screened for eligibility using a study-specific HIPAA 815 
waiver.  Volunteers who call to inquire about the study will have their demographic and 816 
contact information collected over the phone, and the study will be described to them.  817 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/2014 
 21Once the subject has agreed to participate and appears in person, a study specific HIPAA 818 
Authorization will be signed, along with the consent form document. 819 
 820 
Confidentiality/HIPAA: 821 
Every effort will be made to keep all information about the patient confidential. Consent 822 
forms will be placed in the patient charts.  Research records will be kept in a double-823 
locked filing system in a secure locked room.  The electronic study database will be 824 
encrypted and password protected and saved on the University’s secure network.  Only 825 
study personnel will have access to these records. 826 
 827 
The institutional review board (IRB) governing this study may inspect the medical 828 
records of any patient involved in this study.  829 
 830 
IRB Approval:  831 
The study is approved by the UT Southwestern IRB.   832 
 833 
FDA Approval: 834 
An IND/NDA exception was granted by the FDA for possible use of rescue therapy with 835 
prandial insulin add-on to detemir-liraglutide combination should patients in the 836 
liraglutide arm reach the pre-defined failure end-point. 837 
 838

Storage and Drug Accountability of Study Medication(s) 867 
Patients will be instructed as follows: 868 
-Store unused pens in a refrigerator at a temperature between +2°C and + 8°C 869 
(36°F to 46°F). Keep away from the cooling element. Do not freeze and do not 870 
use if it has been frozen. 871 
-Store pens in use for 30 days at room temperature (15°C to 30°C; 59°F to 86°F) 872 
or in a refrigerator (2°C-8°C; 36°F to 46°F). 873 
-Do not freeze and do not use if it has been frozen. 874 
-The pen must be protected from all sources of light, and the pen cap should be 875 
kept on when the pen is not in use. 876 
-Product should not be used if it does not appear clear and colorless. 877 
Investigator will ensure availability of proper storage conditions and record and evaluate 878 
the temperature. While at the site, drug will be stored in a temperature-monitored 879 
refrigerator at 4°C. 880 
There will be no trial medication dispensed to any person not enrolled in the study. 881 
Unused medication will be stored separately from used trial medication(s). 882 
Procedures for Drug Accountability: 883 
-At study site all trial products will be kept in locked refrigerator and counted at 884 
regular intervals 885 
-At study site only enough medication will be dispensed to reach next 886 
appointment.  All medication will be counted at visits and discussed at phone 887 
encounters. 888 
Procedure for return of used/unused trial products: 889 
-Unused product will be properly destroyed at the site or returned to sponsor if 890 
requested. 891 
 892 
Auxiliary Supply 893 
Subjects will use their own glucose monitors, lancet devices, and lancets. They will be 894 
provided with log books.  895 
Randomization 896 
Treatment assignment will be made using stratified blocked randomization at visit 2. The 897 
stratification variables will be prior insulin use and BMI (cut off 37 kg/m2).   The 898 
randomization code will be generated by the study statistician using SAS software, and 899 
consecutively numbered envelopes will be created. The investigator opens the next 900 
envelope at the randomization visit to determine the group assignment of the patient. 901 
 902 
Blinding 903 
This study is only blinded to the investigator performing the study assessments. The 904 
study is not blinded to the patient, nor the study doctor who will be providing diabetes 905 
care to the patient and aid in insulin titration. 906 
 907 
CONCOMITANT ILLNESSES AND MEDICATIONS: 908 
Definitions: 909 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/2014 
 23Concomitant illness: any illness that is present at the start of the trial (i.e. at the first 910 
visit). 911 
Concomitant medication: any medication other than the trial product(s) that is taken 912 
during the trial, including the screening and run-in periods. 913 
Details of all concomitant illnesses and medication will be recorded at trial entry (i.e. at 914 
the first visit). Any changes in concomitant medication will be recorded at each visit. If 915 
the change influences the subject’s eligibility to continue in the trial, the Sponsor will be 916 
informed. 917 
The information collected for each concomitant medication will include, at a minimum, 918 
start date, stop date or continuing, and indication. 919 
For each concomitant illness, date of onset, date of resolution or continuing, at a 920 
minimum, will be recorded. 921 
 922 
ADVERSE EVENTS AND PREGNANCY: 923 
During each contact (phone or face-to-face) the subject will be asked about adverse 924 
events.  All serious adverse events (SAE), suspected unexpected serious adverse 925 
reactions (SUSAR), and serious adverse drug reactions (SADR) will be evaluated by the 926 
investigator and recorded in the patients record.  Other adverse events (AE) will be 927 
evaluated and documented according to standard clinical practice 928 
The sponsor-investigator will collect the following information at minimum for each of 929 
these events: 930 
1. Study name 931 
2. Patient identification (e.g. initials, sex, age) 932 
3. Event (preferably a diagnosis) 933 
4. Drug  934 
5. Reporter identification (e.g. Name, or initials) 935 
6. Causality 936 
7. Outcome. 937 
 938 
Definitions 939 
 940 
Adverse Event (AE): 941 
An AE is any undesirable medical event occurring to a subject in a clinical trial, whether 942 
or not related to the trial product(s). This includes events reported from the first trial 943 
related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent and until post treatment 944 
follow-up period as defined in the protocol. The following should not be recorded as 945 
AEs, if recorded as medical history/concomitant illness on the CRF at screening: 946 
• Pre-planned procedure, unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has    947 
worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed 948 
consent 949 
• Pre-existing conditions found as a result of screening procedures 950 
 951 
Clinical Laboratory Adverse Event: 952 
A clinical laboratory AE is any clinical laboratory abnormality regarded as clinically 953 
significant i.e. an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a 954 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/2014 
 24severity, which requires active management, (i.e. change of dose, discontinuation of trial 955 
product, more frequent follow-up or diagnostic investigation). 956 
 957 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE): 958 
A serious AE is an experience that at any dose results in any of the following: 959 
• Death 960 
• A life-threatening* experience 961 
• In-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalization 962 
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity 963 
• • A congenital anomaly/birth defectSuspicion of transmission of infectious agents via 964 
the product.  965 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening*, or require 966 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 967 
judgement, they may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical 968 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition  969 
*The term life-threatening in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of 970 
death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if 971 
it was more severe. 972 
 973 
Serious Adverse Drug Reaction (SADR):  974 
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an adverse event for which a causal relationship 975 
(Possible/Probable relation) between the study drug and the occurrence of the event is 976 
suspected. The ADR should be classified as serious if it meets one or more of the 977 
seriousness criteria. Clinical judgement following thorough review of any event will be 978 
used to determine the relatedness of the event to the study drug. . 979 
 980 
 981 
Non-Serious Adverse Event: 982 
A non-serious AE is any AE which does not fulfil the definition of an SAE. 983 
 984 
Severity Assessment Definitions: 985 
• Mild: Transient symptoms, no interference with the subject’s daily activities 986 
• Moderate: Marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject’s daily activities 987 
• Severe: Considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities, unacceptable 988 
 989 
Relationship to study medication Assessment Definitions: 990 
• Probable: Good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship 991 
• Possible: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed 992 
• Unlikely: The event is most likely related to an etiology other than the trial product 993 
 994 
Outcome Categories and Definitions: 995 
• Recovered: Fully recovered or by medical or surgical treatment the condition has 996 
returned to the level observed at the first trial related activity after the subject signed the 997 
informed consent 998 
• Recovering: The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover from the 999 
event. This term should only be used when the subject has completed the trial 1000 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/2014 
 25• Recovered with sequelae: As a result of the AE, the subject suffered persistent and     1001 
significant disability/incapacity (e.g. became blind, deaf, paralysed). Any AE recovered 1002 
with sequelae should be rated as an SAE 1003 
• Not recovered 1004 
• Fatal 1005 
• Unknown 1006 
 1007 
Collection, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events 1008 
All events meeting the definition of an adverse event will be collected and reported from 1009 
the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent and until 1010 
the end of the study. This will be monitored by an independent committee (see below).  1011 
All serious and unexpected adverse events will be reported using FDA form 3500.  All 1012 
reports of SAEs/SAR/SUSARs or any events reported to the local health authorities must 1013 
be sent to Novo Nordisk A/Swithin the same timeline used for reporting to regulatory 1014 
authorities (see below). Further information about safety related events will be provided 1015 
to Novo Nordisk A/S if specific requests are received. 1016 
 1017 
Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) 1018 
An independent DSMB will be set up for the trial to oversee safety and perform ongoing 1019 
safety surveillance.  The DSMB will be composed of 3 members who cover the relevant 1020 
specialty as well as an independent statistician: 1021 
 Maria Ramos, MD (Endocrinology) 1022 
 Sumitha Hathiramani, MD (Endocrinology) 1023 
 Naim Maalouf, MD (Endocrinology) 1024 
 Song Zhang, PhD (Statistician) 1025 
The first meeting will occur after the enrolment of 15 subjects or three months after the 1026 
first patient is enrolled, whichever comes first.  The meetings will then occur on a 1027 
quarterly basis, although the board may request more frequent meetings as needed.  A 1028 
formal report approved by all DSMB members will be sent to the PI and study 1029 
coordinator within 3 weeks of the meeting and then forwarded to the IRB. 1030 
 1031 
All AEs will be presented at each meeting and will be available for informal review by 1032 
the DSMB at any time after study initiation.  All SAE and unanticipated but related AE 1033 
will be promptly reported to the IRB (within 2 working days of PI’s awareness for SAEs 1034 
and within 10 working days for other reportable AEs).  We intend to comply with all 1035 
local legal, regulatory, and IRB requirements. We will also report to Novo Nordisk all 1036 
SAEs, SUSARs, and SADRs at the same time such events are reported to regulatory 1037 
authorities or within 15 working days from the sponsor-investigator becoming aware of 1038 
such adverse events, whichever comes first. 1039 
 1040 
Follow-up of Adverse Events 1041 
During and following a subject’s participation in a clinical trial, the sponsor-investigator 1042 
and institution will provide adequate medical care to the study subject for any study-1043 
related adverse events, including clinically significant laboratory values related to the 1044 
study.  This medical care for study subjects will be provided regardless of their insurance 1045 
status.  1046 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/2014 
 26All adverse events classified as serious or severe or possibly/probably related to the trial 1047 
product must be followed until the subject has recovered and all queries have been 1048 
resolved. For cases of chronic conditions follow-up until the outcome category is 1049 
“recovered” is not required, as these cases can be closed with an outcome of “recovering” 1050 
or “not recovered”. 1051 
All other adverse events must be followed until the outcome of the event is “recovering” 1052 
(for chronic conditions), or “recovered” or until the end of study, whichever comes first, 1053 
and until all queries related to these AEs have been resolved. 1054 
 1055 
Pregnancy 1056 
Study subjects will be instructed to notify the sponsor-investigator immediately if they 1057 
become pregnant. If using liraglutide this medication will be discontinued immediately. 1058 
 1059 
The sponsor-investigator will report to Novo Nordisk any pregnancy occurring during the 1060 
trial period. Reporting of pregnancy by sponsor-investigator should occur within the 1061 
same timelines described above for reporting of Adverse Events .  1062 
  1063 
Pregnancy complications will be recorded as adverse event(s). If the infant has a 1064 
congenital anomaly/birth defect this must be reported and followed up as a serious 1065 
adverse event. 1066 
 1067 
Precautions/Over-dosage 1068 
The following precautions and procedures will be observed in the event of overdose by 1069 
any trial product provided during the study: if asymptomatic, the patient is instructed to 1070 
call the study doctor immediately after discovering the overdosage and obtain case-1071 
specific instructions; if symptomatic, the patient is instructed to call the EMS for 1072 
immediate treatment.  1073 
 1074 
LIABILITY AND SUBJECT INSURANCE: 1075 
During and following a subject’s participation in trial, the sponsor-investigator and 1076 
his/her institution will provide adequate medical care to the study subject for any study-1077 
related adverse events, including clinically significant laboratory values related to the 1078 
study. This medical care for study subjects will be provided regardless of their insurance 1079 
status. 1080 
 1081 
The sponsor-investigator will be responsible for the conduct of the study and that the 1082 
sponsor-investigator agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Novo Nordisk, any 1083 
of its parent companies, affiliates, or subsidiaries, and their respective officers, directors, 1084 
employees, agents, representatives, distributors, salespersons, customers, licensees, and 1085 
end-users from and against any claim, suit, demand, loss, damage, expense or liability 1086 
imposed by any third party arising from or related to: (a) any breach of sponsor-1087 
investigator's obligations; or (b) sponsor-investigator’s negligent or grossly negligent use 1088 
or willful misuse of the study drug, the results, or services derived therefrom.  This 1089 
indemnification shall not apply in the event and to the extent that a court of competent 1090 
jurisdiction or a duly appointed arbiter determines that such losses or liability arose as a 1091 
U1111-1145-7585      PROTOCOL VERSION 3.1       05/06/2014 
 27result of Novo Nordisk’s gross negligence, intentional misconduct, or material breach of 1092 
its responsibilities.  1093 
 1094 
EVALUABILITY OF SUBJECTS: 1095 
All patients and collected data will be included in the intention to treat analysis. 1096 
A secondary confirmatory analysis will be performed using only completers data, where 1097 
all data from patients with an overall compliance rate during the study period of <50% 1098 
will be excluded. The subjects and observations to be excluded, and the reasons for their 1099 
exclusion will be documented and signed by those responsible prior to database release. 1100 
The documentation must be stored together with the remaining trial documentation. 1101 
 1102 
PREMATURE TERMINATION OF STUDY: 1103 
Study can be discontinued if funding is withdrawn or by the Data Safety Monitoring 1104 
Board (DSMB) if there is evidence of futility or excess harm. The study statistician will 1105 
monitor the data quarterly and discuss any observed trends with the other members of the 1106 
DSMB who will make such decision following pre-established guidelines. 1107 
 1108 
PUBLICATION PLAN: 1109 
We plan to publish the data from this clinical trial in peer reviewed scientific journals 1110 
(i.e. Diabetes Care).  We anticipate at least two manuscripts to results from this work 1111 
(possibly one on clinical efficacy and safety, one on healthcare utilization and cost 1112 
data).We expect the final manuscripts to be completed around December 1st, 2016. All 1113 
manuscripts will be submitted to Novo Nordisk for review and commenting 1 month 1114 
before external submission. We also plan to present the data at the American Diabetes 1115 
Association and/or The Endocrine Society scientific meetings as poster or oral 1116 
presentations. 1117 
We have registered the study with clinicaltrials.gov. 1118

On completion of  subjects may enter the  
 provi ding they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the  and the Investigator deems they 
would benefit from continued treatment with tildrakizumab.  I n circumstances where the LTE study site activation 
has not occurred at the time the subject reaches the end of Part 2, they may enter from Part 3  if the required  
eligibility conditions are met.  
Randomization will be stratified by prior anti -tumor -necrosis factor (TNF) use and Baseli ne body weight 
  Subjects with prior anti -TNF use will be  of the total number of 
subjects.  
Subjects who fail to show minimal response to treatment  
 may have their background medications adjusted according to the 
maximum permitted daily dose  and continue in the study.  Any subject requiring 
these adjustments will be counted as a non- responder for the primary analysis .  Criteria for other endpoints are 
included in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) . 
Subjects who show clinical  response to treatment  
 
  Subjects receiving tildrakizumab  
during Part  1 who fail to show clinical  response to treatment at  will be 
discontinued from the study drug and will enter Part  3 to receive treatment according to the Investigators ’ discretion .

Investigator . 
Subjects discontinued from IMP at any time (a part from withdrawal of informed consent) will be required to 
complete the  assessment a  and e  
  Subjects who withdraw from the study during Part 3 will undergo the  
assessments . 
The primary endpoint is the ACR  response rate at   Secondary efficacy endpoints will include ACR , 
ACR  response rates, and the components of ACR response; propor tion of subjects who require adjustment of 
background therapy; proportion of subjects who achieve a DAS28- CRP  proportion of subjects who achieve 
MDA criteria; LDI and LEI change from Baseline; and HAQ -DI change from Baseline.  The PK and

observation.  Subjects may not use a combination of MTX and leflunomide.  
Tapering of any of these concomitant medications during the study is allowed only if there is toxicity (accompanied 
by recording of an adverse event [ AE] on the e lectronic Case Report For m); otherwise the dosage must remain the 
same throughout Part 1 of the study.  Adjustment of these concomitant medications is permitted throughout Part 2 
 as needed per Investigator  discretion and therapeutic needs of the subject , or if the  subject does not 
show minimal response to treatment  
 
For subjects receiving non -drug therapy  (including but not limited to physical therapy, massage, diet, ex ercise,

 7 INTRODUCTION 
7.1 Background 
Psoriasis (PsO) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder affecting approximately  of 
people worldwide.1  Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) has been defined as a unique inflammatory arthritis 
associated with PsO .  The precise prevalence is unknown, but estimates vary from 0.3% to 1% of 
the population; among patients with PsO  the observed prevalence of inflammatory arthritis varies 
from   The clini cal features typically present  as an oligoarticular and mild disease.  
However, with time PsA becomes polyarticular, and it is a severe disease in at least of 
patients.2  Symptoms include tenderness, pain and stiffness in and around the joints, dactylitis, 
spondylitis, pain and swelling in the heels, nail disfiguration (dis coloration, splitting , or pitting ), 
and generaliz ed fatigue   Patients with PsA who present with polyarticular disease are at risk 
f
or disease progression.  In addition to progression of clinical and radiological damage, health 
related quality of life is reduced among pat ients with PsA  
P
sA is classified with the s pondyloarthropathies because of the presence of spondylitis in up to 
, the occurrence of extra- articular features common to the  spondyloarthropathies 
(mucous membrane lesions, iritis,  urethritis, diarrhea, aortic root dilatation), and association with 
human leucocyte antigen [ HLA ]-B27.  PsA may be distinguished from the other  
spondyloarthropathies by the presence of peripheral arthritis, asymme trical distribution of  the 
spinal involvement (both sacroiliac joints and syndesmophytes), lower level of pain, and 
limitation of movement.   Several clinical features help distinguish PsA from rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA).  Although RA is more common in women, PsA occurs just as frequently in both sexes.  
The specific clinical features of PsA include the involve ment of distal joints.  Joint distribution  
tends to occur in a ray pattern so that all the joints of a single digit are more likely to get affected 
than the same joints on both sides (which is typical of RA).  The deformities that result from PsA lead to shortening of digits because of sever e joint or bone lysis, with the most severe form being 
the telescoping of digits.
2 
Current treatment choices for PsA include non- steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs  (NSAIDs ), 
corticosteroids, topical treatments  (for skin), light therapy  (for skin), physiotherapy, and 
disease -modifying anti-rheumatic  drug (DMARDs ).3,5   
 
 
 
 ethotrexate (MTX) is approved by the U.S. F ood 
and Drug Administration (FDA) for the skin condition PsO , but it is frequently used off -label for 
PsA.  M ethotrexate has been reported as providing  symptomatic relief to some patients with 
multiple joint involvement and PsO  but there is little scientif ic evidence to support the use as a 
disease-modifying agent for PsA.5

 From animal studies and human disease association studies, there is significant  evidence that 
IL-23 is a  key pro -inflammatory cytok ine in PsO  and some other inflammatory diseases.  Strong 
support for the relevance of the IL -23 pathway in PsO  and some other inflammatory diseases has 
come from recent  genome -wide association studies identifying a certain single nucleotide  
polymorphism in the gene coding for IL -23R to be less frequent in patients with PsO and some 
other inflammatory diseases.1 
 
 
 
 
7.2 Rationale 
Tildrakizumab is being developed for chronic plaque PsO , and Phase 3 studies have recently 
been unblinded, with subjects continuing in the long -term open -label extension .  In the Phase 2b 
study for PsO, all  
 were demonstrated to 
be safe and more efficacious than placebo  
  These data are considered relevant to the PsA development 
program considering PsO and PsA are highly related conditions with a shared pathophysiology, 
and the 2 conditions commonly present in the same patient.   
 
 Arthritis 
Screening and Evaluation (PASE), and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ).

The dosing regimens in this study cover approximately a  from a subopti mal dose 
 
 to the anticipated  maxi mally effective dose ) based 
on pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling. 
Data from Phase 1 studies and the Phase 2b study in PsO patients were incorporated into a 
population PK model.  The Phase 1 study ) had PK data available from  with 
  
   
  
Th
e PK model that describes tildrakizumab after SC  administration is 1- compartmental, with 
first-order absorption and elimination.  Significant covariates were an effect of weight on 
clearance and volume of distribution and an age effect on clearance. Usi ng the individual 
Bayesian estimates, the simulated mean plasma concentrations of tildrakizumab at the proposed 
doses were determined.  From t hese simulated profiles, a dose -dependent relationship with 
tildrakizumab exposure is anticipated.  Therefore, the  separation between each of 
the doses is anticipated to result in appropriate separation of the observed exposures. 
A PK- PD model was subsequently developed, incorporating an indirect -effect maximum drug 
effect ( Emax) model.  Sequential PK -PD analysis of the clinical response data from  
 yielded estimates of the PD parameters including the effective concentration at 
  U tilizing the individual subjec t PK parameters yielded the predicted  
  The 
longitudinal model of PASI reduction utilized an exposure -related suppression of plaque 
formation in an indirect -effect model, together with a placebo -effect on plaque degradation that 
represented the healing process.   
  The simulations incorporated PK variability, within - and 
between -subject variability in PASI response, and model uncertainty.  Per ar m, the percentage of 
PASI75 responders was tabulated.

Base d on the predicted ED 50, the proposed doses are selected to cover the relevant ran ge

onsidering the significant overlap in effective doses for PsO and PsA observed with 
tildrakizumab and related monoclonal antibodies (e.g., ustekinumab, secukinumab, etanercept, 
and adalimumab), these dose -response curves may be predictive of the clinical response in PsA 
subjects.   
 
 
 
.  Together, these doses cover a 
roughly  and are anticipated to define the critical areas of the dose- response curve, 
thereby enabling selection of a dose with the optimal benefit:risk profile to be carried into 
Phase 3 studies in subjects with PsA.

7.2.2 Rationale for Study 
The IL -23/IL- 17 axis has been studied in PsA  and both cytokines are implicated in PsA disease 
activity.  In view of the efficacy of ustekinumab  i n PsA  
 
 
 
  Furthermore, by not blocking 
IL-12, it is anticipated that tildrakizumab may potentiall y avoid adverse effects on cell -mediated 
immunity where IL -12 has an important role. 
This will be the first study conducted with tildrakizumab exclusively in subjects with PsA.  As 
tildrakizumab is in development (Phase 3 ongoing) for the related PsO indication, substantial PK 
and PD data exist that can inform dose selection in PsA, as described.  Under these 
circumstances, the next step for development is to confirm efficacy in the PsA population and 
understand the relationship between dose and clinical response.  Therefore, this Phase 2b study 
will .  The tildrakizumab arms and a placebo arm will be 
analyzed at  for the primary endpoint  (the proportion of subjects achieving a  
reduction from Baseline in American College of Rheumatology response criteria ).

subject’s eCRF.  During any unscheduled visits the Investigator will record any AEs and 
concomitant med ications as well as performing any assessments or collecting samples deemed 
necessary at the discretion of the Investigator. 
9.2 Discussion of Study Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, multiple -dose, P hase 2b study  to 
evaluate the ef ficacy of 4 dose groups of tildrakizumab administered by SC injection in subjects 
with active PsA.  The study has been developed based on design features used in the  completed 
 as well as  
  The primary efficacy endpoint is based on the proportion of subjects achieving ACR  
response criteria at  which has been well established for the evaluation of clinical 
outcome.  Secondary efficacy endpoints are based on evaluation of other measures of ACR  
(ACR  and ACR ) , the proportion of subjects requiring adjustment of background 
medication, DAS28 -CRP, MDA , dactylitis and en thesitis, and HAQ -DI, which are all accepted 
measures for the evaluation of clinical outcome.  
The st udy has been designed with 4 distinct phases ( Screening, double -blind treatment period, 
double- blind follow -up, and a wash-out period).  This enables scientific evaluation of efficacy at 
 longer term evaluation of efficacy and safety through   and ensures subject 
safety  via a monitored wash-out period for subjects who do not enter the LTE study.  All safety 
measures are consistent with evaluations used in clinical studie s and previous studies with 
tildrakizumab.  
9.2.1 Risk/Benefit and Ethical Asses sment  
Given that efficacy benefits were reported for subjects with concurrent PsA in the completed 
Phase 2b study in  there is an expectation that subjects treated with 
tildrakizumab  will improve PsA disease activity  and measures of q uality of life (HAQ)  at 
  However, the study design allows early identification of subjects who have not 
received a minimum level of improvement at  to enable the Investigator to remove IMP 
and initiate other treatment at their discretion.  
The study has also been designed to minimize potential risks to subjects; all subjects will 
undergo S creening procedures aimed at reducing the likelihood and impact of any such risks.  In 
addition, regular safety monitoring during the treatment period for a ll subjects will ensure that 
any unanticipated effects of study participation are identified promptly and managed 
appropriately.  In view of the long half -life (T1/2) of tildrakizumab at doses previously studied, 
subjects who do not enter the LTE study wil l continue  to be monitored throughout a  
following the EoT visit, during which no active IMP will be administered.

 In addition, an independent DSMB  will review selected dat a across the study.  The DSMB in 
conjunction with the Sponsor is empowered to make recommendations regarding continuation, 
termination or modification of the stud y, as appropriate.  
Overall, based on data from non- clinical and clinical studies of tildrakizumab  to date and the risk 
minimiz ation strategies discussed ab ove, the risk:benefit profile of the current study is 
considered acceptable.

9.3.3 Strategies for Subject Recruitmen t and Retention  
All recruitment material will be approved by an Independent Ethics C ommittee (IEC) or 
Institutional Review Board (IRB ) prior to implementation.  
Regular study monitoring will enable identification of any potential issues related to subject 
retention. 
9.3.4 Withdrawal of Subjects  
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw consent to participate in the study for any reason at any time.  
Withdrawal of consent occurs when a subject does not want to participate in the study anymore 
and does not want to attend any  further visits or assessments, have further study -related contact, 
or allow analysis of already obtained biologic material.  
If a subject withdraws consent, the Investigator must make every effort to determine the primary 
reason for this decision and recor d this information  on the treatment disposition eCRF  page.   If 
the subject decides to completely withdraw from the study (refuses any further study 
participation or contact), all study participation for that subject will cease and data to be collected 
at subsequent visits will be considered missing.  The IMP  must be discontinued and no further 
assessments conducted.  Further attempts to contact the subject are not allowed unless safety 
findings require communication or follow-up. 
However, for safety reasons ,  assessments should be conducted for subjects 
withdrawing during Part 1 or 2, if the withdrawn subject is willing to undergo the assessments.   
For subjects withdrawing  during Part  3 and willing to undergo final assessments, the 
 should be conducted at  after their last visit. 
The appropriate personnel from the site and  will assess whether IMP should be 
discontinued for any subject whose treatment code has been broken inadvertently for any reason. The Investigator must also contact the interactive response technology to register the subject’s 
discontinuation from IMP.

 9.3.5 Investigational Medicinal P roduct  Discontinuation 
Subjects may voluntarily discontinue IMP for any reason at any time  and enter the 20-w eek 
wash -out period, or completely withdraw from the study ).  Subjects who 
consent to enter the wash-out period will undergo the  
  
At any time during Part 1 or Part 2 of the study, t he Investigator should discontinue IMP  of a 
given subject if, on balance, he/she believes that continuation would be detrimental to the 
subject’s well -being.    
 
 
IMP must be discontinued under the following circumstances and the further steps need to be 
discussed with the medical monitor: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Note: the derivation of clinical response 
 will be made within the IVRS system using information provided by the site.  The 
IVRS system will determine the subject’s eligibility to continue  based on  treatment received 
during Part 1 of the study. 
 Reasons for Temporary Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug dosing may be temporarily suspended in the event of: 
1. Clinically important laboratory abnormalities  
2. Subjects who develop suicidal ideation

   of 98 
 3. Other intercurrent illnesses or major surgery  
4. Use of prohibited treatment 
5. Any other protocol deviation that results in a significant risk to the subject’s safety 
6. Sponsor decision 
After a laboratory abnormality leading to suspension of dosing normali zes sufficiently, study 
treatment may resume at the discretion of the PI in consultation with the medical monitor.  
Similarly, study treatment may resume after the medication leading to suspension of dosing is 
discontinued.  A decision to discontinue IMP  and/or to reinstitute study treatment should be 
discussed with the medical monitor.  The Investigator may suspend study treatment at any time, 
even without consultation with the medical monitor if the urgency of the situation requires immediate action and if this is determined to be in the subject’s best interest.  However, the 
medical monitor should be contacted as soon as possible in any case of IMP discontinuation.  
Resumption of study treatment after temporary discontinuation should always be discussed with the medical monitor.  
9.3.6 Continued Study Participation  
The Investigator  must determine the primary reason for the subject’s premature discontinuation 
of IMP and record this information on the treatment disposition eCRF  page.  The Investigator 
and study staff must discuss with the subject, the subject’s continued participation in the study 
and request subjects to continue attending study visits to  according to the study visit 
schedule.  
9.3.7 Lost to Follow- up 
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing 
status.  This includes follow -up with persons authorized  by the subject.  Lost to follow -up is 
defined by the inability to reach t he subject after a minimum of 3  documented phone calls, faxes 
or emails (not perform ed on the same day), as well as a lack of response by the subject to 
1 registered mail letter.  All attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical records.  If 
it is determined that the subject has died, the site will use permissible local methods to obtain the 
date and cause of death and as much other information as can be obtained, including 
post- mortem reports.  
Data to be collected at subsequent visits will be considered missing.  
9.3.8 Discontinuation of Study Sites  
Study site participation may be disc ontinued if Sun Pharma  Global FZE  or designee, the 
Investigator or IRB/IEC of the study site judges it necessary for medical or safety reasons 
consistent with applicable laws, regulations and GCP.

If a subject misses a visit and/or a scheduled dose of I MP, the site must reschedule a visit to 
ensure the dose of IMP is taken as soon as possible  within the visit window .  If  
to reschedule  or the visit window was missed  and the subject still is  not able to take the dose , the 
Sponsor should be contacted to determine if the subject should be discontinued from the study.

 10.2.2 Label ing 
Medication labels will comply with the legal requirements of each country and be printed in the 
local language. They will supply no information about the subjects. 
10.2.3 Storage 
All drug supplies for this study must be stored under  conditions  
according to labeled storage conditions.  Until dispensed for administration to subjects, the IMP 
will be stored in a securely locked area, accessible to authorized personnel only 
10.2.4 Blinding and Randomi zation of Study Treatment(s) 
This study  will be performed as a randomized, double -blind study including 2 stratification 
factors .  Subjects will be randomiz ed according to a list produced by  
Prior to production, the r andomiz ation specification will be reviewed and agreed 
by the study team ( Sponsor   As  is considered 
potentially unblinding information, it will be known to the Study Biostatistician  only. 
An IVRS  will be responsi ble for the allocation of randomization numbers to individual  subjects.  
Randomiz ation will take place at  after confirmation that the subject continues 
to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria    
  
 
 
   
 
A copy of the randomiz ation  code with true treatment allocations will be held by  
during the study.  Another randomization list ( containing kit number and 
treatment) will be provided to clinical supplies .  The randomization codes associated with each 
subjec t will be disclosed to PK analysts who will keep PK results confidential until database 
lock. Should a situation arise where unblinding is required, the Investigator at that site may perform 
immediate unblinding via the I VRS  without the need for communicat ion with the Sponsor.  This 
can only occur in emerg ency situations (  
Blinding of study medication and dose regimens will be maintained by using a double -dummy 
double- blind design, where all subjects  receive medication (active or placebo) at all scheduled 
dosing visits.  If a subject does not receive the scheduled dose, every effort should be made to 
administer the dose as soon as possible (

 To ensure validity of assessments, the following assessments will be performed by a n 
independent assessor: 
• Joint count 
• PASI  
• LDI/LEI  
The PGA of disease activity will be assessed  by the treating physician  (using the full 68/66 
tender/swollen joint count assessment ] performed by the independent assessor) .  
All other assessments will be administered  by the study co -ordinator or  PI/desi gnee  
  For the DAS28- CRP score   the subset of 28 joints (from the full 
counts) will be transcribed to the appropriate page of the eCRF by site staff, and the score will be 
calculated during data reporting using the eCRF data and the central CRP laboratory result. 
At the time of the IA , a specified team of personnel will be unblinded to allow reporting of the 
primary objective at  
10.3 Procedure for Breaking the Randomi zation Code 
Subjects, Investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, and data analysts will remain 
blind to the identity of the tre atment from the time of randomization until all subjects complete 
their double-bl ind treatment  and wash -out period. 
Following last subject completion of the  visit (or earlier withdrawal from study 
treatment), an IA  using unblinded data  will be performed for the placebo -controlled double -blind 
treatment period  
Emergency treatment code breaks should only be undertaken when it is essential to treat the subject safely and efficaciously.  Most often, IMP  discontinuation and knowledge of the possi ble 
treatment assignments are sufficient to treat a study subject who presents with an emergency 
condition.  Emergency code breaks are performed using the  IVRS .  When the Investigator  
contacts the system to break a treatment code for a subject, he/she must  provide the requested 
subject identifying information and confirm the necessity to break the treatment code for the subject.  The Investigator  will then receive details of the IMP for the specified subject and a fax 
or email confirming this information.  The system will automatically inform the  
the medical monitor, and the r that the code has been broken, but 
no treatment assignment will be communicated.  
It is the Investigator ’s responsibility to ensure that there is a  procedure in place to allow access to 
the IVRS  in case of emergency.  The Investigator  will inform the subject how to contact his/her 
backup in cases of emergency when he/she is unavailable.  The Investigator will provide the 
protocol number, IMP name if available, subject number, and instructions for contacting the 
local entity which has responsibility for emergency code breaks to the subject in case an

 emergency treatment code break is required at a time when the Investigator and backup are 
unavailable.  
10.4 Subject Compliance  
The dosage, timing and mode of administration of study medication may not be changed.  Any 
departures from the intended regimen must be recorded in the eCRF.  
Study medication accountability and subject compliance will be documented throughout the 
treatment periods (Part 1 and Part 2) using study -specific study medication dispensing record 
forms.   If a subject does not receive the scheduled dose, every effort should be made to 
administer the do se as soon as possible  
Deviations from the intended regimen could occur due to: (1) receiving unscheduled IMP 
injections, (2) missing an injection, and (3) receiving the incorrect IMP dose. 
10.5 Study Treatment Accountability  
Records shall be m aintained of the delivery of study treatment to the study cent ers, the inventory 
at the study center s, the use of each subject and the return to the Sponsor. 
These records shall include dates, quantities, batch numbers, expiry dates and the unique code 
numbers assigned to the study medication and to the study subjects. 
The Investigator shall be responsible for ensuring that the records adequately document that the 
subjects were provided the doses specified in the protocol and that all study medication recei ved 
from the Sponsor is reconciled.  All study medication  must be returned to the Sponsor at the end 
of the study. 10.6 Concomitant Therapy  
Concomitant Medications, Supportive Care, and Study Restrictions:  
The following restrictions will apply to all subjects d uring the study.  Subjects should abide by 
inclusion and exclus ion restrictions.  
Concomitant medications limited throughout the study  
• Analgesics: Acetaminophen may be used by the subject PRN  before a 
sched uled study efficacy evaluation. 
Concomitant medications  will be limited during Part 1 of the study  as 
follows: •

corticosteroids when they enrolled under  may continue using them in line 
with the inclusion and exclusion criteria in  
• DMARDs: Subjects  taking either MTX  
 dose, unless a decrease in dose is required 
because of toxicity or intolerance.  Oral MTX cannot be changed to parenteral dosing during 
the period of observation.  Subjects may not use a combination of MTX and leflunomide. 
Tapering of any of these concomitant medications during the study is allowed only if there is 
toxicity  (accompanied by recording of an AE on the eCRF) ; otherwise the dosage must remain 
the same throughout Part  1 of the study.  Adjustment of the se concomitant medication s is 
permitted throughout  per Investigator discretion and therapeutic needs of 
the subject , or if the subject does not show minimal response to treatment  
  
For subjects receiving non- drug therapy  (including but not limited to physical therapy, massage, 
diet, exercise, emollients. and joint taping) , this must be stable for the  prior to 
IMP initiation through to the end of Part 1.

 11 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY 
The following efficacy assessments will be undertaken, as outlined in the Schedule  of 
Assessments  
11.1 Efficacy Assessments  
11.1.1 Joint Counts 
Five clinical patterns have been described among patients with PsA: distal interphalangeal (DIP), 
asymmetrical oligoarticular, symmetric polyarticular, spondylitis, and arthritis mutilans .  
Peripheral joints are assessed for tenderness and swelling.  There is no validated measure to 
assess peripheral joint s in PsA; the measure used is the ACR  joint count initially developed for 
the assessment of patients with RA.   The ACR joint count ranges from  for 
tenderness, and  
he ACR joint count of  
count includes the  majority of joints affected in PsA, and it ca n be readily  performe d in a clinic 
visit.  It includes the temporomandibular, sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular, shoulder, elbow, 
wrist (including the carpometacarpal and intercarpal joints as 1  unit), metacarpophalangeal 
(MCP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP), DIP, hip, knee, talotibial, midtarsal (including subtalar), 
metatarsophalangeal, and interphalangeal joints of the toes (proximal and distal joints of each toe 
is counted as 1 unit). 
11.1.2 American College of Rheumatology  Response Criteria  
The AC R  response measures the percentage of subjects with at least a 
 improvement from Baseline in both tender joints  and swollen joints  along 
with associated percentage improvements in

 12 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
The timing and frequency of safety assessments are described in  and  
12.1 Adverse Events  
12.1.1 Definitions  
The d efinitions for AEs  and SAEs  are given below.  It is of the utmost importance that all staff 
involved in the study are familiar with the content of this section. The PI  is responsible for 
ensuring this. 
12.1.1.1 Adverse Event/Reaction  
An AE is defined as “any untowa rd medical occurrence in a subject, or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, 
symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigation) product, 
whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product”. 
Any relevant observations made at the Screening and Baseline visit (including Screening 
laboratory test results , and until the first dose of IMP ) are to be recorded on the AE eCRF , but 
will not be considered treatment- emergent AEs (TEAEs) and will be reported separately from 
TEAEs .  Any relevant observations following the first dose of IMP  will be recorded as an AE in 
the subject’s AE eCRF ; this includes physical examination findings, clinically relevant abnormal 
vital signs, clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities, and clinically relevant ECG findings .  An 
AE relating to a pre ‑existing condition will only be recorded if there is a worsening of the 
pre-existing condition during study conduct with regard to nature, severity or frequency. 
An adverse drug reaction is an “untoward and unintended response to an IMP related to any dose 
administered”.  
All AEs  judged by either the reporting Investigator  or the Sponsor as having a reasonable causal 
relationship to a medicinal product qualify as adverse drug reactions.  The expression of 
“reasonable causal relationship” means to convey in general that there are f acts or arguments 
which suggest a causal relationship. 
12.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as, but is not limited to, an event that: 
1. Results in death  
Death is not an AE in itself, but an outcome.  The cause of the death is the AE which resulted 
in deat h. 
2. Is life -threatening  

Sun Pharma Global FZE  CONFIDENTIAL  16 Mar 2018 
Tildrakizumab    
 
Protocol  CLR_16_23  
(Final)  Page 65 of 98 
 Life-threatening means that the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the 
SAE; it does not refer to an SAE that hypothetically might have caused death if it had been 
more severe.  
3. Requires in -patient hospitaliz ation  or prolongs existing hospitaliz ation  
Hospitaliz ation is defined as at least 1 overnight formal admission into hospital, usually in 
order to perform additional tests, provide treatment which it is not possible to provide at 
home and/or due to an unstable medical condition which requires specific monitoring of the  
subject.  Pre-planned hospitalizations (known already prior to signing the ICF) will not be 
considered an SAE, unless any of the above criteria are fulfilled over the course of the hospitaliz ation due  to unplanned complications. “Social” hospitali zation whereby it is 
administratively impossible to release the subject home is not necessarily an SAE. 
Complications that occur during hospitali zations are AEs unless they would qualify as an 
SAE for any of t he above criteria.   If the complication delays subject release from hospital 
then the AE becomes an SAE.  Hospitaliz ations which are not performed due to an AE are 
not regarded as SAE s. 
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
The term si gnificant disability refers to any condition that impairs physical/physiological 
well-being to the extent that the subject is unable to function normally.  Physical disability 
may include, but is not limited to, permanent disability of locomotion or motility, but also systemic permanent dysfunction including heart failure, liver insufficiency or pulmonary fibrosis.  
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
6. Is an important medical event 
Important medical events that my not result in death, be life -threatening or require 
hospitaliz ation may be considered a s an SAE when , based on appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject or the subject may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent  listed in this definition.

12.1.1.5 Treatment -Emergent Adverse Event  
TEAEs are defined as any AE occurring or worsening on or after the first dose of IMP. 
12.1.1.6 Overdose  
A drug overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional use of a drug or medicine or an 
administration error in an amount that is higher than is normally used.  Every overdose must be reported to  within , 
irrespective of whether the overdose was associated with an AE/SAE.  
Overdose in this study is specifically defined as any dose greater than the intended protocol dose 
  In case of overdose, it is recommended that the subject be monitored for any 
signs or symptoms of adverse reactions or effects and appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted immediately.  
12.1.1.7 Product Quality Complaint  
A product quality complaint ( PQC ) is related to a potential quality issue during manufacturing, 
release testing, stability monitoring, dose preparation, storage or distribution of the product or delivery system.  In addition, it includes any reports in which a suspicion of 
counterfeit/tampering exists.  It is important to note that not all PQCs involve a subject.  A PQC 
should be reported within 24 hours.

Protocol  CLR_16_23  
(Final)  Page 67 of 98 
 12.1.1.8 Planned Hospitalization  
A hospitalization planned by the subject prior to signing the ICF is considered a therapeutic 
intervention and not the result of a new SAE and should be recorded as medical history.  If the 
planned hospitalization or procedure is executed as planned, the record in the subject’s medical 
history is considered complete.  However, if the event/condition worsens during the study, it must be reported as an  AE. 
12.1.1.9 Incident  
A device- related incident is any product complaint that led to or might have led to death or 
serious deterioration of health/serious injury/serious illness for the user of the product or any 
other person. Note that "device" refers to the PFS  for this study.  The incident should be reported 
within 24 hours. 
12.1.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
Any relevant observations made before the end of the Screening and Baseline visit (prior to first 
dose of IMP) are to be recorded on the AE  eCRF , but will not be considered TEAEs and will be 
reported separately from TEAEs .  Any relevant observa tions made after the first dose of IMP  
will be recorded as an AE in the subject’s AE eCRF (  
In view of the l ong T
1/2 of tildrakizumab at doses previously studied, subjects will continue to be 
monitored throughout the  following the EoT visit.  For the purposes of 
this study, a ny detrimental change in the subject’s  condition, after the first dose of IMP  and up to 
completion of the EoS visit, should be considered an AE.  For those subjects who may withdraw 
during the wash-out period, at least 2  attempts should be m ade to collect AEs . 
The following variables will be recorded for each AE: verbatim/AE description and date for AE 
start and stop, severity, seriousness, causality rating, whether or not the AE caused the subject to discontinue, and the outcome.  A new AE must be recorded if the severity of the AE changes . 
All AEs/SAEs have to be repo rted to the Sponsor, whether or not considered causally related to 
the IMP or to the study procedure(s). 
All ongoing AEs/SAEs should be followed up until resolution or stabilization  or the last visit if 
in the Investigator's opinion, the AE is unlikely to resolve due to the subject's underlying disease. 
At any time after the subject has taken the first dose of IMP , if an Investigator learns of an SAE 
that can be reasonably related to IMP, he/she should promptly notify the Sponsor. 
The Investigator will asse ss the intensity of AEs base d on the following definitions: 
• Mild  
• Moderate
• Severe  

Sun Pharma Global FZE  CONFIDENTIAL  16 Mar 2018 
Tildrakizumab    
 
Protocol  CLR_16_23  
(Final)  Page 68 of 98 
 It is important to distinguish b etween serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in . 
An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that 
persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not an SAE.  On the other hand, 
a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be an SAE. 
For an AE to be a suspected drug -related event, there should be at least a reasonable possibility 
of a causal relationship between the IMP and the AE. 
12.1.3 Causal Assessment  
The relationship of AEs to study drug will be assessed by the Investigator  
 and will be a clinical decision based on all available information.

significant and any of the following criteria is met: 
• Result is associated with signs/symptoms

12.1.6 Pregnancy  
Pregnancy itself  is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that the IMP may have 
interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  If a pregnancy is reported for a 
subject, no further IMP will be administered to this subject and the outcome of all  pregnancies 
(spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital abnormality) must be 
followed up and documented.  Follow- up should be performed up to delivery and examination of 
the new -born, after which a follow -up report should be  sent with any new information regarding 
the pregnancy and the outcome of the birth. 
All congenital abnormalities/birth defects should be classified as SAEs.  Spontaneous 
miscarriages should also be reported and handled as SAEs.   Elective abortions without  
complications should not be handled as SAEs, but should be reported as a follow -up report for 
the pregnancy.  All outcomes of pregnancy must be reported to the Sponsor on a Pregnancy 
Outcomes Report F orm. 
Pregnancy outcomes must be collected for the femal e partners of any males who took study 
treatment in this study.  Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes 
should be obtained from the female partner.

There may be situations when an SAE  has occurred and the Investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial SAE report.   However, it is very important that the 
Investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every event pr ior to transmission of the 
SAE Report F orm.  Minimum criteria are identifiable subject (number), a suspect product 
(i.e., IMP or concomitant medication), an identifiable reporting source ( Investigator /study site 
identification), and an event or outcome that can be identified as serious.  The Investigator may 
change his/her opinion of causality in the light of follow -up information, amending the SA E 
report form accordingly.  The causality assessment is the criteria used when determining 
regulatory reporting requirements for SAEs. 12.1.7.1 Safety Reporting to Sponsor 
 will forward the SAE and Pregnancy report to the 
following Sponsor’s safety representative s  (whichever 
is earlier)  of becoming aware of it.

(Final)  Page 76 of 98 
 Pregnancy tests will also be performed whenever  during the 
treatment period ( or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected), to confirm the subject has 
not become pregnant  during the study.  Pregnancy tests may also be repeated as per request of 
IRB/IECs or if  required by local regulations. 
12.4 Assessment of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior 
Subjects will be assessed for suicidal ideation and behavior at Screening using the Baseline 
(Lifetime) C -SSRS, and each subsequent visit using the C -SSRS Since Last Visit version.  There 
are 5 questions relating to levels of suicidal ideation which prompt questioning about suicidal 
behavior or intensity of ideation, depending on response.  Subjects acknowledging active 
thoughts of self -harm but lacking an articulated plan for doing so are classified at the 
intermediate risk level; those presenting  a defined self -harm plan or lacking needed impulse 
control are judged to be at the high risk level.  Subjects who have high risk of suicidality at the 
Screening assessment based on Investigator’s judgment or, if appropriate, as indicated by a 
response of  in the suicidal ideation section, or 
any positive response in the behavioral section of the C -SSRS, should not be enrolled in the 
study.  Those who develop suicidal ideation during the study rated as high risk according to the 
above classification  must be temporarily discontinued from receiving IMP and referred promptly 
for psychiatric evaluation.  Subjects rated as displaying the intermediate level of suicidal ideation should receive psychological support  and be assessed on an individual basis.  All individuals 
assessed as exhibiting suicidal behavior, except preparatory acts, must discontinue IMP  
permanently .  The presence of non- suicidal self -injurious behavior should be assessed on an 
individual basis. 
12.5 Electrocardiogram Assessments  
Computerized 12- lead ECG recordings will be obtained at scheduled  study visits after the subject 
has rested for at least 5 m inutes in the supine position.  ECG data will be submitted to a central 
laboratory for measurement.  T he Investigator will document the occurrence of any clinically 
significant 12 -lead ECG abnormalities within the eCRF (AE module) based on correlation 
between the central reading report and clinical findings.  Repeat measurements will be performed 
if needed .

size is based on an assumed active treatment effect in ACR  of up to  (ACR  response 
rate under placebo , and  in each of the remaining groups); 
a , and a  dropout rate.  Results are based on simulations 
incorporating the use of the Simes method for testing the composite hypothesis that the response rate for all active treatment groups is not significantly different from placebo versus the 
alternative hypothesis that at least one of the active treatment groups has a response rate 
significantly greater than that of placebo.  This is the primary hypothesis test for this study.  Note that  per group also yields  power for t esting that an individual treatment group 
response rate exceeds that of the placebo group assuming the true ACR  rate is  for the active group and  for placebo.

 15 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
15.1 Conduct of the Study  
 Sun Pharma Global FZE s hall implement and maintain quality control and quality 
assurance procedures with written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to ensure that the 
study is conducted and data are generated, documented and reported in compliance with the 
protocol, ICH GCP and applicable regulatory requirements. 
This study shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki 
(October  2013)11, FDA (CFR, Sections  312.50 and 312.56), EU (Annex 1, Directive 
2001/83/EC) and UK regulations (The Medicines for Human Use [Clinical Trials] Regulations 
2004 [no.1031]), and with ICH GCP (CPMP  135/95). 
The Investigator may not deviate from the protocol without a formal protocol amendment having 
been established and approved by an appropriat e IEC/IRB, except when necessary to eliminate 
immediate hazards to the subject or when the change(s) involve(s) only logistical or 
administrative aspects of the study.  Any deviations may result in the subject having to be 
withdrawn from the study and render that subject non- evaluable.  
15.2 Study Monitoring  
The Investigator shall permit the  to review study data as frequently as 
deemed necessary to ensure that data are being recorded in an adequate manner and that protocol 
adherence is satisfact ory. 
The Investigator will provide access medical records for the m onitor in order that entries in the 
eCRF may be verified.  The Investigator , as part of his/her responsibilities, is expected to 
co-operate with n ensuring that the study adheres to GCP requirements. 
The Investigator may not recruit subjects into the study until such time that a visit, or with the 
agreement of the Sponsor , attendance at the Investigator meeting, has been made by a 
Sponsor/  to conduct a detailed review of the protocol and e CRF.

 16 ETHICS  
16.1 Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board 
Prior to the start of the study, the Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the protocol and 
consent form have been reviewed and approved by a relevant IEC/IRB.  The IEC/IRB shall be 
appropriately constituted and perform its functions in accordance with FDA , ICH GCP and local 
requirements as applicable.  
The IEC/IRB shall approve all protocol amendments (except for logistical or administrative 
changes), written informed consent documents and document updates, subject recrui tment 
procedures (e.g., advertisements), written information to be provided to the subjects, 
Investigator's Brochure, available safety information, information about payment and 
compensation available  to subjects, the Investigator 's curriculum vitae and/or other evidence of 
qualifications and any other documents requested by the IEC/IRB and Regulatory Authority (Competent Authority) as applicable. 
16.2 Written Informed Consent  
The nature and purpose of the study shall  be fully explained to each subject (or their legally 
responsible guardian).  
Written informed consent must be obtained from each subject (or guardian) prior to any study 
procedures being performed.   The process of obtaining informed consent must  be documented in 
the subject source documents. 
The consent documents to be used for the study shall include all the elements of informed 
consent as outlined in accordance with FDA, ICH GCP and local requirements as applicable an d 
be reviewed and approved by the appropriate IEC/IRB prior to use. 
16.2.1 Data Monitoring Committee 
An independent  DSMB  will be established to periodically review safety results.  The DSMB  will 
have access to unblinded data.  Based on the  results of the interim review the DSMB  will submit  
its recommendations in written form to the Sponsor who is responsible for responding to the 
recommendations of the DSMB  and to take appropriate action.  The Investigator s will only be 
informed by the Sponsor in case of stopping the study.  The DSMB  may ch oose to request 
additional evaluations at any time if they feel this is warranted from the standpoint of safety.  
The DSMB  will act according to its own written SOP  described in a charter and will prepare 
written minutes of its meetings.  
In order not to disseminate unblinded data and to ensure that all staff involved in the conduct and 
final analysis of the study remains blind to the  results of the safety review, only the members of 
the DSMB  and the unblinded statistician will have access to these data.

 At each planne d safety review , the randomization codes of the subjects to be included in the 
analysis will be unblinded.  Before unblinding, a SAP  will be prepared for the safety review and 
approved by the Sponsor.  The results will be sent confidentially to the DSMB  by the unblinded 
statistician.

 17 DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPING  
17.1 Case Report Forms/Source Data Handling  
All required study data must be entered in the eCRF created for the study.  This data collection 
tool is a validated electronic data capture (EDC ) system that contains a system generated audit 
trail.  Data required according to this protocol are recorded by investigational site personnel via 
data entry into the internet based EDC software system.  The Investigator shall ensure that all 
data from subject visits are promptly entered into the eCRFs in accordance with the specific 
instructions given.  The Investigator must sign each eCRF to verify the integrity of the data 
recorded.  All internal  and external investigational site personnel seeking access to the 
eCRF are supported by a Service Desk (if applicable).  At the end of the study all data captured 
electronically will be provided to the Investigator on CD -ROM for archiving at the 
investigational site.  
A list of the normal ranges for all labo ratory tests to be undertaken forms part of the 
documentation to be collated prior to study start.  If a central laboratory has been selected to 
conduct any or all tests, it is essential that all samples be analyzed  at that laboratory , unless 
otherwise spe cified (e.g., ESR) . 
The Investigator must maintain source documents, such as laboratory reports, X -rays, ECGs, 
consultation reports, and complete medical history and physical examination reports.  All 
information in the eCRF must be traceable to the source documents in the subject’s file. 
17.2 Retention of Essential Documents  
The Investigator /institution should maintain the study documents as specified in the ICH 
guidelines on GCP and as required by the applicable regulatory requirements.  The 
Investigator /institution should take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of 
these documents. 
Essential documents should be retained until  
  
 
  These documents should be retained for a 
longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement 
with the Sponsor.  It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the Investigator /institution as 
to when these documents no longer need to be retained.

 18 FINANCING AND INSURANCE  
The Sponsor shall carry an in surance policy to cover compensation of subjects’ health injuries 
arising from the study.  If a subject incurs a study -related injury, the subject may be treated (and 
other necessary measures taken) at the study site and/or another medical institution.  If it is 
necessary to compensate for the treatment, the Sponsor will cover the cost.  The Sponsor shall 
not impose on the subject the burden of proving the causal relation between the study and the 
injury. 
If any of the following is confirmed, the Sponsor may refuse or restrict the payment of the 
compensation: 
1. A serious GCP or protocol deviation by the Investigator or S ub-Investigator (except 
deviation medically necessary to avoid an immediate hazard to the study subjects)  
2. Intentional act or negligence on the  part of the Investigator or S ub-Investigator or 
malpractice thereby  
3. Injury caused by unlawful act or delinquency of a third party 
4. Injury caused by intentional a ct or negligence of the subject  
If compensation becomes necessary for a study -related injury, the site will promptly notify the 
Sponsor and will co -operate with the Sponsor and its insurer (or their legal representatives) in 
their handling thereof.

1.1 Study Title  
Non-pharmacological Options in postoperative Hospital -based And Rehabilitation 
pain Management: the NOHARM trial   
1.2 Objectives  
The study objectives are 1) to test the impact of the NOHARM intervention on pain 
and function  3 months following surgery, 2) test the impact of the NOHARM 
intervention on anxiety and opioid use during the 3 months following surgery.  
1.3 Design and Outcomes  
This is a pragmatic clinical trial using a cluster randomized stepped wedge design. 
Clusters are defined at the level of care teams and qualifying surgical procedures, 
and have been randomized to one of five different tranches to implement the 
intervention at staggered intervals . (See diagram in section 6 “ Study Design ”). 
1.4 Interventions and Duration  
The intervention being tested (i.e. compared to usual care/no intervention) is a 
bundled Healing after Surgery  Guide  + clinical decision support intervention 
embedded within the electronic health record. Participants undergoing qualifying 
surgeries at participating sites will be “on -study” beginning with their decision to 
have a surgical procedure and continuing until final outcomes are collected at 3 
months post -surgery.  
1.5 Sample Size and Population  
All Mayo Clinic patients receiving one of the surgical procedures included in the 
NOHARM study will be enrolled in the NOHARM trial.  Based on surgical 
volumes from 2018 and the number of patients required for sufficient statistical 
power, we plan to enroll 114,000  patients  into the NOHARM trial.

* For the purposes of the initial IRB approval, the study has received institutional 
approval from Dr. Amy Williams, Executive Dean of the Practice and Chair of the 
enterprise Mayo Clinic Clinical Practice Committee. This approval assumes that 
all Mayo Clini c surgical practices will participate in the study as an institutional 
priority, but provides that practice -level approvals will be formally solicited . To 
obtain these practice -level approvals, the principal investigators have been 
conducting metings wit h practice chairs, specialty councils, and allied health 
leadership. All IBR approvals have been obtained for clusters within tranche 1, and 
meetings have begun for subsequent tranches. Obtaining these approvals in 
advance will ensure that cascading commun ications can occur in a timely manner. 
Practice administration for specific surgical practices, providers, and allied health 
staff implicated in each wave of study implementation will be engaged generally no 
sooner than 3 months prior to the anticipated st art date of the implementation wave 
they have been randomized to. Engagement earlier than 3 months before study 
implementation will most likely be counterproductive.

NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  8 of 47 5 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
5.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
Prescriptions for narcotic pain relief after surgery result in unintended prolonged 
opioid use for hundreds  of thousands of Americans.1,2 That trend fuels an excess 
supply  of opioids that can lead to dependence, addiction, diversion, and overdoses 
on a national scale.3-10 Non-pharmacological pain care (NPPC) is effective and 
recommended by guidelines for perioperative pain while offering a more favorable 
risk-to-benefit ratio.11-14Additionally, patient and clinician decision support 
interventions are effective in encouraging  patient -centered and guideline -
concordant care in many other areas of medicine and hold great promise for 
promoting and facilitating  post-operative  non-pharmacologic  pain management .15,16  
5.2 Study Rationale  
Nonpharmacological pain care is rarely used as first or second -line therapy after 
surger y, despite guidelines to the contrary.  17,18  NPPC offers a more favorable risk -
to-benefit ratio than op ioid medications  which may play a critical role in acute 
post-operative management but should be tapered in favor of safer and more 
sustainable analgesic options as patients  transition  home and gradually resume their 
life roles . Additionally, patient and clinician support interventions  have not been 
tested pragmatically as a bundle in everyday postoperat ive care as a means of 
facilitating the uptake of non -pharmacological pain management  strategies  in the 
perioperative setting and in the post -acute recovery timeframe . This study will 
address this knowledge gap and test the impact of utili zing patient and clinician 
decision support tools to inform patients and facilitate their preference for non -
pharmacological  pain management modalities.  
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  9 of 47 6 STUDY DESIGN  
This study will utilize a cluster randomized stepped wedge design. Clusters are defined at 
the level of care teams and qualifying surgical procedures, and have been randomized to 
one of five different tranches to implement the intervention at staggered intervals  (one new 
cluster each wave, see diagram below).   
 
 
The primary outcome of the study is a composite of patient reported pain and function at 
three months  post-surgery . This will enable us to  determine the effectiveness of  a bundled 
NOHARM Healing after Surgery  Guide +  clinical decision support for promoting non -
pharmacological pain management strategies to patients  undergoing qualifying  surger ies, 
which may also  ultimately curb overall patient demand for opioid prescriptions in post -
acute post-surgical rehab  while optimizing functional recovery .  Thus, o ur secondary 
outcome(s) is  opioid use  at the 3 month point post -operatively . This will enable us to 
understand the impact of our EHR -embedded decision support intervention in an era where 
opioid prescribing is already be ing constrained . 
All patients  receiving common , pre-defined  procedures within 7 surgical practice areas  at 6 
Mayo Clinic locations  will receive the study intervention if their surgery date coincides 
with the stepped wedge implementation schedule. Study locations include Mayo Clinic 
Rochester, Mayo Clinic Florida, and Mayo Clinic Arizona, as well as three Mayo Clinic 
Health System site s (Mankato, MN; La  Crosse, WI; and Eau Claire, WI).   Surgical practice 
areas will include orthopedic surgery, colorectal surgery, gyn surgery,  obstetrics , 
pulmonary/thoracic surgery, liver and kidney transplant, and cardiac surgery.  Due to 
variable combining  of post -op unit care  areas , practice size, and related consideration s we 
have formed 22 clusters that will be randomized across 5 tranches .   
Enrollment in the intervention arm of the  trial will extend from March 2021  to 
approximately August  2023 . Participating practices will be enrolled in the study from the 
point in time the intervention is implemented in their practice and continuing through the 
end of the study . 

NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  10 of 47  
The intervention consists of enhanced electronic medical record fun ctionality that 
interfaces with a patient -facing Healing after Surgery  Guide  in Epic MyChart  patient 
portal . The Healing after Surgery  Guide encourages patients to make a plan for post -
operative pain management and to utilize NPPC techniques that appeal to them. The 
intervention also uses EHR tools that remind  and prompt clinician s to encourage  patients 
to use their selected NPPC techniques throughout the perioperative period. All study 
assessments will be extracted from the electronic health record . Patient reported outcome  
measure s will include those collected in routine peri -operative care, as well as a limited 
number specific to the NOHARM trial; self -reported opioid consumption and NPPC 
modality use after surgery.  
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  11 of 47 7 SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS  
7.1 Inclusion Criteria  
All patients 18 years of age and older undergoing qualifying surgeries  at 
participating sites  will be eligible.  
7.2 Exclusion  Criteria  
None.  
7.3 Study Enrollment Procedures  
All eligible patients at participating sites will be enrolled in this minimal risk, 
population -based study. An automated EHR -based algorithm  will identify patients 
meeting inclusion criteria for the NOHARM study  based on  age, surgical 
procedure, clinical department , and location .  
Eligible patients in not -yet activated clusters  will receive usual care; data collected 
from this group will serve as “control” data in this stepped wedge study.  Control  
state data will be collected prior to cluster activation.   
All patients  scheduled for surgery ; as well as their care  surgical  team s, physical and 
occupational therapists, and unit nurses,  in activated practice clusters will be 
exposed to the intervention  per the randomization scheme . Because the intervention 
is embedded in the EHR, patients who are unable to interact with the portal -based 
Healing After Surgery Guide will not provide the data needed to populate and drive 
the EHR -based algorithms and clinical decision support tools. Therefore, these 
individuals will be less exposed to the intervention. However, the patients who do 
not interact with the Healing after Surgery  Guide  via the EHR patient portal  prior 
to their hospital admission ` will have the opportunity to select NPPC modalities 
during their  hospital ization , both pre - and post -operatively . By communicat ing 
their NPPC  selections to their unit nurses , their preferences will be enter ed into the 
EHR via flowsheets.  Subsequently, all EHR clinical decision support 
functionalities to encourage NPPC use will be operational for these patients.  
Cognitive limitations, lack of English fluency, or psychiatric illness may result in  
an inability to use the Healing After Surgery Guide which may also result in 
reduced exposure to the intervention.  
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  12 of 47 8 STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
8.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration  
Once the NOHARM intervention is activated at a given participating site, patients 
undergoing qualifying surgical procedures will be exposed to the NOHARM  
intervention.  
The intervention includes:  
Healing after Surgery  Guide : 
The Healing after Surgery  Guide   is an interactive module in the Mayo Clinic 
patient portal (MyChart). Entry of an order for  their surgery will trigger  an EHR 
algorithm will automatically send a message to patients’ portals describing the need 
for an “individualized pain management plan to promote healing after surgery.” 
The portal message will provide a link allowing patients  to access  and engage with 
the HAS Guide  before their surgery. The HAS Guide  will encourage realistic 
expectations about post -surgica l pain, will educate patients on several evidence -
based, non -pharmacological pain management strategies (which are  robustly  
validated and endorsed in clinical guidelines), and will encourage patient s to select 
the NPPC modalities  that appeal to  them in managing post -acute pain during the 
months following their discharge. Patient selections elicited via the Healing After 
Surgery Guide  will prompt a follow -up portal message , acknowledging the 
patient’s NPPC selections and extend ing the opportunity for them to receive  a 
printed Healing After Surgery workbook  if they request  that such resources be 
mailed to them. Patients will have the opportunity to receive portal messages based 
on their responses to the Healing After Surgery Guide and PROMIS CAT (s tandard 
of care) as well as based on the length of time from surgery. These messages will 
include direction on how they can access the website, join Zoom support calls if 
desired or contact the NOHARM team. Section 8.1.1 gives a break down of the 
possible portal messages. The Zoom support calls referenced in the portal messages 
are to assist patients with their selected modalities if they so wish. Patients will log 
into these calls anonymously and PHI will not be discussed. There will be calls that 
center a round specific modalities as well as open Q&A style.  
 
EHR -based Clinical Decision Support:  
The NPPC selections  will be stored in the EHR  and used to prompt perioperative 
clinician interactions , direct education delivered by unit nurses, inform modality 
choices during physical and occupational therapy sessions,  and populate patients’ 
pain management plans for controlling  pain following hospital discharge . 
Additionally, patients’ NPPC selection will be visible to cl inical providers on the 
Epic inpatient Summary view.  These components are considered standard of care.   
Mayo Education Material:  
A suite of self -management educational materials will be available to support 
patients ’ use of NPPC modalities and to help them trouble shoot and refine the use 
of their selected modalities.  These print materials and videos provide information 
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  13 of 47 and instruction on the safe and appropriate use of NPPC strategies for addressing 
post-surgical, post -acute pain. The materials additionally clarify how patients may 
adapt NPPC modalities to derive optimal benefit given their unique requirements 
and post -surgical precautions. All education materials have been developed, vetted 
and approved through Mayo Clinic’s Office of Patient Education processes and 
reflect existing standard of care for patient education. These materials will be 
available to patients via the Healing After Surgery website  
(healingaftersurgery.mayoclinic.org )and on Mayo Clinic Television.   Brief video 
descriptions of the NPPC modalities are imbedded in the Healing After Surgery 
Guide. The materials  include video and print resources , with the latter being  
available in both electronic and paper form ats.  The materials offer informational, 
instructional, and guided experiencial content for all NOHARM NPPC modalities, 
as appropriate.    A Healing After Surgery Workbook is also available .  The 
workbook  offers patients a location to record their experiences, concerns, and 
successes, as well as providing motivational messages.  
Patients may view the self-management educational  materials during their hospital 
stays on Mayo Clinic television.  B ased on patients’ NPPC modality select ions, 
inpatient nurses will be prompted to  show patients how to navigate to the materials 
on Mayo Television , familiariz e them with the Healing After Surgery website , and 
provide them with print materials if desired .   Nurses will also use the educational 
materials to  discuss pain management planning with patients to refine their 
management plans following hospital dismissal .   
The materials will be available on a website, DVD, and Mayo Clinic TV.  Unit 
nurses will be able to give patients printed  PDFs, as required . Additionally, patients 
will receive a copy of the Healing After Surgery workbook via mail after they are 
enrolled onto the study . They will also have the ability to request from their portal 
messages that a print copy of the workbook be mailed to them .  
See Section 8.1.1 NOHARM Resource List  for a brief description of the 
NOHARM materials  
Perioperative live NPPC  Support Resources  
Patients have the opportunity to engage with Mayo Clinic specialists in NPPC 
modalities perioperatively  to support their selection, troubleshooting, and use of the 
modalities.  Patient are notified of live support resources through their patient 
portal upon completion of the Healing After Surgery guide and are given a RACK 
card distributed at the pre -operative consultation. This support is restricted to 
NPPC modalities and patients are clearly informed that any questions relating to 
medications and other an algesic approaches should be directed to their surgical care 
teams . This support is set up to maximize the patient’s successful self -management 
of the NPPC both pre and post operatively.NOHARM NPPC live  support will take 
to forms:  
 
1.  Toll free call for 1 -on-1 discussion of  individualized needs .1-833-919-1432   
2. Presentations and group discussions via a virtual platform (Zoom technology) .  
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  14 of 47 See Appendix B NOHARM Resource List  for a brief description of the NOHARM 
materials   
Clinical team decision support : 
Patient NPPC modality selection s elicited from the Healing After Surgery Guide  
will be converted to discrete data elements that will prompt clinician decision 
support (CDS)  after surgery . CDS tools that promote preference -sensitive, 
guideline -concordant NPPCs at defined touchpoints  on the perioperative care 
trajectory  will encourage clinicians , nurses , and physical/occupational therapists  to 
discuss NPPC modalities  with patients and pre -populate fields  and functionalities  
within Epic such as  the “After Visit Summary”.  
See Section 8.1.1 NOHARM Resource List  for a brief description of the 
NOHARM materials  
8.1.1 NOHARM Resource List  – Found in Appendix B  
 
 
8.2 Handling of Study Interventions  
The NOHARM intervention Healing after Surgery  will be assigned to patients using 
an EHR Boolean logic -based algorithm that includes  age, surgical procedure, 
clinical department, and location . The intervention  will be delivered to patients  and 
their care teams  via the patient porta l and EHR , respectively . For some patients , we 
may send paper versions of the pain and physical function PROs to the patients at 
the 1, 2, and 3  month  post-op point s. If the patient receives and comletes duplicate 
versions, the one time stamped earlier will be used for analysis.  
8.3 Concomitant Interventions  
This is a pragmatic, population -based clinical trial.  All eligible patients undergoing 
qualifying surgical procedures who receive care at the 6 participating sites will be 
enrolled, regardless of medications, treatment, supplements or other interventions 
they may be taking/receiving.   
8.3.1 Allowed Interventions  
The interventions in this study are a patient -facing “ Healing after Surgery  
Guide ” and a clinical team -facing clinical decision support augmented by 
existing, vetted patient education materials already consistent with the 
scope of work for perioperative care.  These interventions could prompt 
utilization of NPPC modalities prior to, during , and after the hospital stay.   
8.3.2 Required Interventions   
Among collaborating practices, Healing after Surgery  Guide  functionality 
and clinical decision support components of the intervention bundle will be 
turned on according to the pre-specified randomization scheme.  How or 
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  15 of 47 whether patients and care team s choose to interact with th e various  
intervention components and resources will be at their discretion .  The  
NOHARM  intervention is conceptual ly distinct from the index  surgical 
procedure s for which patients  are scheduled, which, though temporally 
associated, are not considered part of the research intervention.   
8.3.3 Prohibited Interventions  
None. We do not have the ability to individually turn off the intervention 
for individual patients, though records of patients who have previously 
indicated they do not want their medical record used for research purposes 
will have data associated with their car e redacted from final analytic 
datasets.   
8.4 Adherence Assessment  
Patients will be encouraged, but not required, to interact with the NOHARM 
Healing after Surgery  Guide   and to utilize suggested NPPC  modalities .  
Additionally, patients who are unable  or unwilling  to interact with the portal -based 
Healing After Surgery  will not provide the  NPPC selection  data needed to populate 
and drive the EHR -based algorithms and clinical decision support tools. Therefore, 
these individuals will be more limitedly exposed to the intervention. They will be 
encouraged to use the Healing After Surgery Guide  during day -of-surgery intake 
and post -operative care processes, but this may not occur due to many competing 
demands , or patient preferences.   
Cognitive limitations, lack of English fluency, or psychiatric illness may result in 
inability to use the HAS Guide  or complete the  electronic patient reported outcome 
measures  (ePRO Ms). 
Interaction with the NOHARM HAS Guide , completion of ePRO Ms and utilization 
of NPPC modalities will be assessed by  time-stamped links associated with the 
Healing after Surgery  Guide  while ePRO Ms and NPPC  modality  use will be 
extract ed from the medical record.

Page  16 of 47 9 STUDY PROCEDURES  
9.1 Perioperative Care Pathway/NOHARM Touchpoints  
The figure below briefly summarize s the perioperative care pathway along which 
our bundled, EHR -based intervention will be implemented.   
 
 
9.2 Description of Evaluations  
9.2.1 Choosing Surgery and Pre-Operative Planning Touchpoints  
Touchpoint 1 - Choosing Surgery  
Ambulatory care team members prepare patients to engage with the 
NOHARM intervention (portal -based Healing after Surgery  Guide ) at the 
time surgery is scheduled.   
Touchpoint 2 – Pre-operative Planning  
Patients interact with the Healing after Surgery  Guide  via their Epic EHR 
MyChart portals.  The Healing after Surgery  Guide  will allow patients to 
select NPPC techniques that appeal to them  and develop an individualized 
NPPC plan.   Patients will be encouraged to familiarize themselves  with and 
practice NPPC modalities prior to their hospital admissions .  Additionally, 
they will be encouraged to obtain needed supplie s, engage their caregivers, 
and even schedule appointments with NPPC practitioners prior to their 
hospitalizations so that their individualized pain management plan s may be 
seamlessly transitioned from the hospital  to the home or post-acute  care 
setting.  
9.2.2 Inpatient Stay  Touchpoints  
Touchpoint 3 – Acute Hospital Care  
Nursing and physical/occupational therapy staff will offer  patients the  
opportunity to receive preference -concordant NPPC modalities  during their 

NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  17 of 47 hospital stay . For self -administered practices, staff will validate patients ’ 
preferences  and ensure the availability of needed supplies, instruction and 
ambient conditions (e.g. privacy).  
If patients are not experiencing adequate pain relief, they will be prompted 
by nurses to try alternative NPPC modalities in order to raise awareness of 
opioid harms, and enhance clinician support for patients’ NPPC use.   
Additionally, NPPC nurse and physician specialists will be “on call” to 
assist unit nurse s, therapists , and members of the surgical care team in how 
to optimize the safety and effectiveness of NPPC modalities for specific 
patients.   
Touchpoint 4 – Hospital Discharge  
During the discharge process, patients will be asked to revise their NPPC 
plan, as needed  based on their preferences and responses to specific NPPC 
modalities , and provided with support and resources. Discharge planning 
will include facilitation of continuation of patients’ NPPC use in their post -
acute care settings (e.g. home, rehabilitation facility, etc.). Patients will be 
given prescriptions to receive local NPPC, if available  and/or appropriate . 
Patients’ discharge summaries will be auto -populated with selection -
concordant NPPC instruction s and resources to find local NPPC providers.    
9.2.3 Post-Hospital  Discharge  Recovery  Touchpoints  
Touchpoint 5 – Remote Healing After Surgery Guide  Use and Post 
Operative Follow -up 
Patients will be encouraged to use the Healing After Surgery  and follow 
their individualized pain management plans during their post-surgical 
recovery . They  will be asked to report on  their pain intensity, anxiety, and 
limitations in physical function  using PROMIS ePROs  via the Epic 
MyChart patient portal .  Patients will , at the same time  points,  be asked 
which, if any, of the NPPC techniques they have used and at what 
frequency .  These measures will be collected at 1 month, 2 month and 3 
months post surger y.  In addition, at the 3 month timepoint the patient will 
be asked to self-report  opioid use measures.     
Include here which responses will trigger which messages.   
Additional Triggered Touchpoints  
Opioid Refill Requests  
Opioid refill requests during the 3 -month postoperative interval will trigger  
messaging via the patient’s portal with  information regarding how to access  
resources to support their NPPC use.  Patients will be encouraged to utilize 
the live support resources, particularly the 1 -on-1 calls in order to select and 
adapt use of modalities for optimal benfit.  
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  18 of 47 10 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
This is a minimal risk study. Participants are considered “enrolled” as soon as they meet 
study inclusion criteria and are automatically assigned  to receive study interventions and/or 
measurements.    
10.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
There are no pre -specified safety parameters, as they are not -applicable to the 
intervention being studied. This study engage s patients in strategies for post -
surgery pain management  that conform to guideline -based care , all of which have 
far lower risk  profiles (almost zero risk) and greater benefit -to-risk ratio compared 
to usual  post-surgical pain management that involves opioid medications. Patients 
whose pain cannot be sufficiently managed with non -pharmacological  pain 
management strategies will be supported by their surgical team (with assistance 
from pain management  clinicians, as needed) using conventional pain management 
strategies.  
10.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety 
Parameters  
Our interventions are informational and logistical  and designed to enhance safe, 
patient -centered approaches to patient care.  If they were to prompt, for instance, 
less opioid use, in theory, that could lead to worse function or increase pain.  That 
is why we chose the composite outcome measure of pain and physical function .  
Whether it is accurate to associate that “risk” to our intervention itself, versus the 
treatments prompted by our intervention is a topic of debate.  Nevertheless, t his is a 
minimal r isk study. If we conservatively assume that downstream prescribing 
practices are attributable to our interventions, usual care (using opioid medications 
as a first line approach to pain management in the acute and post -acute recovery 
periods  following a surgical procedure s) introduces greater risk of dependency, 
addiction, and overdose, th an those posed by the  intervention we are providing in 
the NOHARM trial  which  is guideline concordant.  
10.3 Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence resulting 
unambiguously from the misuse or overuse of non -pharmacological pain 
management strategies facilitated by the intervention. All untoward or unfavorable 
medical occurrences will be first assumed to be  associated with the patient ’s 
surgery. Untoward or unfavorable medical occurrences will be deemed an adverse 
event only if they can be clearly associated with use of non -pharmacological pain 
management strategies recommended and/or fac ilitated by the intervention and 
could not, under any circumstances, have otherwise happened.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE ): Any adverse event unambiguously associated with 
the intervention that: 
• Results in death  
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  19 of 47 • Is life threatening, or places the participant at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred  
• Requires or prolongs hospitalization  
• Causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in congenital anomalies or birth defects  
• Is another condition which investigators judge to represent significant 
hazards  
There are no laboratory or other clinical values which may be used to assess safety 
concerns related to the intervention. Patient reported pain, requests for assistance 
with pain management, and other health outcomes, while measurable , are 
associated with the patient’s surgical procedure  and will be gather as part of the 
ultimate outcome data.  If patients were to experience a paradoxical response to a 
modality –massage , for example  – those effects would likely be transient and they 
would have access to all  the usual care resources of Mayo Clinic as any other 
patient should those symptoms persist.  
Adverse events that may be anticipated in the study involve any patient misuse or 
overuse of non -pharmacological pain management strategies. Patients who elect to 
incorporate non -pharmacological pain management strategies in their recovery 
from surgery will be instructed in the use of those strategies, including whether 
(and when) th e use of those strategies is appropriate in their situation.  
Because non -pharmacological pain management modalities recommended by the 
intervention are guideline concordant approaches to pain management under 
normal circumstances, they will be monitored by the patient’s surgical team as a 
part of usual post -acute ca re. Therefore , we will not actively review for potential  
events with scheduled promptings.  
Unprompted adverse events are possible, but not expected. Surgical teams will 
inform the study  team  if they are made aware of any untoward medical occurrence 
that could reasonably be attributed to a patient ’s misuse or overuse of non -
pharmacological pain strategies as a direct result of the facilitation provided by the 
NOHARM intervention.  Such events are highly unlikely, and the risks of such 
events leading to unfavorable outcomes is almost non -existent. Th e risks of 
participant cooperation in the NOHARM intervention is far less than the risks of 
usual care which  often  involve opioid medications alone in the acute and post -acute 
recovery periods.  
10.3.1  Reporting Procedures  
An AE or SAE will be suspected if a member of the patient’s surgical team 
or any member of the study team who interfaces with the patient for any 
reasons suspects that  a patient is experiencing a medical issue that is 
unambiguously related to the patient’s interaction with the NOHARM 
intervention.  
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  20 of 47 The principal investigator, relevant study team members, and any relevant 
members of the surgical team will adjudicate the relevance of the patient’s 
experience to the NOHARM intervention (versus an anticipated result of 
the patient’s surgical procedure).  
If a patient experience or outcome is determined to be an AE or SAE by 
protocol definition, then that patient’s experience will be documented and 
reported per institutional procedures. The surgical team and/or members of 
the study team with expertise in po st-surgical pain management will follow 
up with that patient to ensure that appropriate steps are taken to mitigate any 
negative outcomes and ensure that the patient is properly informed and 
educated about safe use of non -pharmacological pain management 
strategies for the remainder of their surgical recovery.  
Severity of the Event  
All AEs will be assessed by a qualified medical professional using a 
protocol defined grading system.   
Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the 
participant’s daily activities.  
Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with 
the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference 
with functioning.  
Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may 
require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually 
potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” 
does not necessarily equate to “s erious”.  
Relationship to the Study Intervention  
Because this is a minimal risk study  and the intervention may be construed 
as less risky than usual care, it would be inappropriate to regard the study 
intervention as suspect, by default, for all medical occurrences in the 
perioperative period. For this reason, the principal investigator, c linical 
experts on the study team, and the patient’s surgical team will adjudicate the 
relevance of patient events outcom es in a binary fashion:  
• Not related to the NOHARM intervention. This will be the 
presumption, unless proven otherwise. Patients may be expected to 
have many challenges to overcome following a surgical procedure. 
These challenges are unrelated to the intervention.  
• Related to the NOHARM intervention. The study team will evaluate 
all occurrences suspected of being associated unambiguously with the 
NOHARM intervention and adjudicate their relevance. We do not 
expect any AEs or SAEs to result from the NOHARM interventio n. 
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  21 of 47 10.3.2  Follow-up for Adverse Events  
Patient events suspected of being AEs or SAEs will be addressed 
immediately by the Principal Investigator, relevant experts on the study 
team, and/or the patient’s surgical team. Upon determination that an event is 
indeed an AE or SAE, appropriate actions will be taken, including 
contacting the patient and providing instructions.  
All events suspected of being AE will be documented, and documentation 
for recorded events subsequently determined to be an AE or SAE will be 
updated. All AEs and SAEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
The study coordinator will record all events reportable by the definitions 
above o ccurring any time following patient enrollment and limited to the 
last data collection point in the study.  All events are expected to occur in the 
acute or early post -acute periods of recovery.  
10.4 Safety Monitoring  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board and/or Safety Officer appointed by the NIA 
will monitor the conduct of the study.  
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  22 of 47 11 INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
This study is a pragmatic clinical trial, and as such, patients will not be individually 
consented. However, voluntariness is preserved as patients and surgical team s are not 
required to engage with any component of the intervention  they are not interested in or 
deem irrelevant to their care.  Additionally, as a pragmatic clinical trial, “the intervention” 
will be systematically implemented  at the surgical practice level , per the stepped -wedge 
schedule, as an element of usual care.  
Therefore, discontinuation of the study, whether for an individual participant                                                                                                                   
or for all participants at once is defined as the cessation of study measurement  prespecified 
by the study timeline .  The discontinuation of the study intervention components, if 
merited, will be at the discretion of the surgical specialties  in conjunction with the DSMB;  
discontinuation  is not anticipated.  
Removal individual  patient s from the trial will be functionally achieved  in the following 
situations:  
• The patient actively requests to have their records withdrawn  from the NOHARM 
study  dataset . This is unlikely, as patients will only know of NOHARM as a 
practice -based care initiative per the pragmatic design of the trial.  
• Patients previously indicating their unwillingness to have medical record data used 
for research purposes will have their records redacted from final study datasets prior 
to analysis.   
Cessation of study measurement will happen for the entire trial in the event that:  
• Institutional needs / priorities preclude our ability to conduct study procedures (e.g. 
in the case of institutional response to COVID -19).  
• The study funder requests that study activities cease.  
In the event that an individual patient withdraws from the study or the entire study ceases, 
patients will still be monitored by their surgical team per usual care practices for the 
duration of their post -acute recover y period. Cessation of study procedures will not impact 
patients ’ access to  standard  supportive care following surgery.  
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  23 of 47 12 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1 General Design Issues  
This study will address the primary objective using a cluster randomized stepped 
wedge design. Surgical practices, or clusters, will be randomized in 5 tranches to 
receive the NOHARM intervention; outcomes of patients treated by these teams 
will be compared by intervention status of the team. The primary statistical 
hypothesis is that pain and function measures will be lower and higher, 
respectively, in the patients treat ed under the intervention  conditions , when 
compared with non -intervention patients  in those same practices .  
The cluster randomized stepped -wedge design will allow us to stagger the 
NOHARM implementation while increasing statistical power. The alternative to 
staggering the implementation would be to implement at all sites at the same time, 
which is impractical fr om a resource  perspective. The stepped -wedge design allows 
each site to serve as its own control, reducing the bias due to imbalanced risk 
factors across clusters. Contamination does pose some threat to the internal validity 
of stepped wedge designs when, as here, the intervention rolls out sequentially in 
adjacent clusters.  The 22 NOHARM clusters will minimize potential 
contamination by capitalizing on geographical separations in the built environments 
used to deliver perioperative care including differen t buildings in some cases, as 
well as subspecialty -designated inpatient wards, office suites, etc.   
The primary hypothesis is that the NOHARM intervention will reduce patient 
reported pain and increase patient reported function following designated surgical 
procedures relative to patients treated under usual care. The primary outcome  – a 
composite of patient reported pain and function – 3 months post -operatively will be 
assessed using validated patient reported outcomes.  
12.2 Sample Size and Randomization  
Using pain data for 6,261 patients with these procedures at six sites, we estimated 
the intra-cluster correlation coefficient  (ICC) for the pain score to be  modest   = 
0.037.  To assess minimal detectable effects, we simulated a large number of  
randomizations and estimated the detectable effect for each. Specifically, for P = 
1,….,5000 permutations, the 22 clusters were randomly assigned to 5 waves. For 
each permutation, the closed form solution of Harrison et al (2019) was used to 
estimate SE(Q ) (derived from the formula of Hussey, Hughes (2008)) for true 
effect Q. We used the values 2 = 1 and 2 = 0.488 for the within and between 
variance components so that detectable effects would be in SDs, and assumed ICC 
would be 0.037.  Over  the 5,000 per mutations, the detectable effect ranged between 
0.048SD and 0.055SD.  
12.2.1  Treatment Assignment Procedures  
In order to balance cluster characteristics , we applied a constrained 
randomization  procedure. Constrained randomization allows us to balance a 
larger number of cluster characteristics than is possible through 
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  24 of 47 stratification. Here the key cluster characteristics to be balanced were: site 
(6 locations), volume (estimated using 2018 data), procedures (3 groups), 
and number of teams (1 -4). Given only 22 sites, it would not be practical to 
stratify or apply minimiza tion, while constrained randomization allows us 
to select an allocation of sites to waves from among a set of allocations that 
has better balance on these factors.  
Specifically, we generated 100,000 allocations of the 22 clusters to 5 waves. 
For each allocation, we then calculated a balance metric B as follows. For 
each characteristic c listed above, let X(c) i be the value of c for each cluster 
i=1,...,22. For categorical factors X is an indicator, for volume and number 
of teams X is a number, rescaled to range from 0 -1. Let w=0,...,5 be the 
baseline  (w=0) and 5 intervention waves; and for a given allocation, let S i = 
the first wave at which cluster i is allocated to  intervention. Then we 
calculate for each allocation the balance metric  
𝐵=∑ (𝑆𝑖̅−𝑤)|∑𝑋(𝑐)𝑖(𝑆𝑖≤𝑤)
𝑐−∑𝑋(𝑐)𝑖(𝑆𝑖>𝑤)
𝑐|
𝑤=0.,,5 
After generating 100,000 allocations, we constrained selection to those with 
values of B in the lowest decile; we then selected one allocation randomly 
from those 10,000 ‘acceptable’ allocations.  This process resulted in a full 
allocation of all 22 sites to waves 1 -5 prior to initial intervention.  
12.3 Interim analyses and Stopping Rules  
This is a minimal risk study for which there is no planned interim analysis.  Interim 
analysis may be conducted at the request of the DSMB or if necessitated by 
unforeseen changes in the study plan (e .g. loss of a study site). Similarly, there  are 
no pre -specified stopping rules as the probability and magnitude of adverse 
experiences are not greater than those ordinarily encountered  in daily life . 
12.4 Outcomes  
Outcomes will be collected via the Epic EHR . PROMs will be collected using 
interfaces available to patients in their MyChart patient portals  or the Welcome 
tablet functionality at point of care  as available .   Because outcomes will be either 
PROMs or data entered by providers during routine care delivery, requirements for 
adjudication will be minimal.  Health care utilization is an exception in that criteria 
for hospitalizations vary based on designations of observational status.  The 
NOHARM Data Management  working group will identify hospitalizations that 
may require adjudication, including ER stays that exceed 24 hours.  A  committee  
blinded to a patient’s affiliation with an activated  or control cluster will determine 
whether to design ate such instances as hospitalizations.  
The cadence and mode of  PROM data collection are outlined below .  PROMs 
comprise the NOHARM trial’s co-primary and a majority of its secondary 
outcomes .  PROMs will additionally be collected for use in describing  the study 
population and for analytic adjustment s. 
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  25 of 47  
12.4.1  Primary outcome   
Physical function and pain interference, as measured with the Patient 
Reported Outcome Measurement System (PROMIS) computer adaptive 
tests (CATs)  are the co -primary outcomes .  The CATs in the Mayo Clinic 
Epic EHR have been parameterized with stopping rules based on number of 
items administered rather than  a standard error of measurement -defined  
threshold.  IRT-based instruments have generally better discrimination 
across the entire trait range than legacy PRO Ms,19,20  and CAT 
administration  enhances measurement efficiency and precision.21,22 The 
PROMIS item banks have been validated in the target populations.23-25   The 
PROMIS physical function and pain interference CATs will be assigned via 
an automated Epic function precisely 3 months following each patient’s 
surgery.  Patients will receive an automated  reminder message  via their 
patient portals  prompting them  to complete the PROMs.  
Because post -operative visit requirements and sequences vary across 
surgical practices, administration of the PROMIS CATs will not be linked 
to a specific visit, but rather assigned automatically after 3 months have 
elapsed since surgery.  If this data coincides with a clinic visit, then patients 
will be encouraged to complete the PROMIS CATs  via the Epic Welcome 
interface  using a tablet in the waiting room prior to their clinic visit.   
12.4.2  Secondary outcomes   
Secondary outcome measures will include opioid consumption, NPPC use, 
healthcare utilization  and anxiety.  Anxiety will be measured in a manner 
similar to physical function and pain interference  with a PROMIS CAT 
administered via the Epic MyChart portal or the Welcome tablet interface 
prior to a clinic visit that coincides with the 3 -month post -surgical time 
point.  
Opioid consumption will be collected using three methods .  First, o pioid 
consumption  per hospital day, will be extract ed from the medication 
administration log in the EHR.  As in previous work,  26-28  parenteral, 
transdermal, and oral opioid consumption will be expressed as oral 
morphine equivalents (OMEs). Second, oral and transdermal o pioids 
prescribed by a Mayo Clinic provider at the time of hospital discharge and 
during the interval between hospital dismissal and the 3 month post -surgical 
assessment point will be extract ed from the EHR and converted to OMEs. 
Last, because outpatient prescriptions do not accurately capture opioid 
consumption, patients will be queried at the 3 month post -operative ti me 
point regarding their opioid use  using a subscale from a validated opioid 
consumption questionnaire.  28   
NPPC use will be collected using two methods.  First, the frequency with 
which patients use specific NPPCs during their hospital stays will be 
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  26 of 47 extract ed from Epic flowsheets .  Nurses, as well as occupational and 
physical therapists record delivery of modalities as well as education 
regarding modalities in Epic flowsheets.  This information will be 
electronically extract ed and expressed as count data.  Second, p atients ’ use 
of NPPC modalities will be assessed using self -report.  At the 1-, 2- and 3-
month  assessment point patients will be queried regarding which of the 
NOHARM NPPC modalities they have used since hospital discharge .  The 
will be presented with a list of the NOHARM m odalities and asked to 
indicate those that they have used .  Epic cascading logic will then present a 
second item for each modality that a patient has used which will ask them 
“How many times per week, on average, do you use modality ?” Healthcare 
utilization for NOHARM will consider hospitalizations, post -acute care, ED 
visits, surgery clinic outpatient visits, and calls to the surgery care team and 
post-acute care (PAC).  EHR entries and administrative billing data will be 
aggregated to  construct a comprehe nsive data set of all clinical encounters.  
Data collected for hospitalizations will include procedures and admission 
and discharge diagnoses.  For ED encounters, we will capture diagnoses and 
procedures.  Clinic visits will be captured using billing data which will 
include CPT codes, ICD -10 codes, location, and clinician NPI numbers.   
 
12.5 Data Analyses  
Because patients are randomized in clusters, all statistical methods will account for 
potential correlation of measures within clusters. Such methods include cluster 
adjusted standard errors for t -tests and χ2-tests, and mixed effects models.  Patient 
characteristics will be summarized by intervention status, and tested for difference 
between intervention groups; any factors which are imbalanced will be accounted 
for in the main analyses.  Factors assessed for balance and potential inclusion in 
pre-specified  analyses are those listed in Section 13.1 .1 and all baseline measures 
listed in 13.1.2.  
The primary and secondary outcomes will be compared between intervention 
groups using mixed effects generalized linear models. Each model will include an 
indicator for intervention group; a random intercept for cluster; cluster level factors 
that were used  to constrain randomization; calendar time; surgery type; and any 
patient factors that were imbalanced across groups.  
The model details for each outcome are as follows:  
1. PROMIS CATs (anxiety (1°), physical function (1°), pain  (1°)). These are 
continuous measures, collected at two time points, pre -operative and 3 months 
post-operative. To assess the impact of the intervention on these we will 
estimate three separate models. If Yijt is the measure at time t =1,2 of the ith 
patien t treated by the jth cluster, then we will estimate  
𝑌𝑖𝑗2=𝛽0+𝛽𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑗+𝛽𝐵𝑌𝑖𝑗0+𝛽𝑇𝑇+𝚩𝑿 𝑿𝒊𝒋+𝚩𝒁𝒁𝒋+𝑢𝑗+𝑒𝑖𝑗   (1) 
 
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  27 of 47 where Iij indicates the intervention status, T is calendar time, u j ~ N(0, 2) is a 
cluster level random effect, Xij is a vector of patient characteristics, including 
surgery type, Zj is a vector of cluster characteristics used for randomization, and 
eij is a residual error. By testing I = 0 we can assess whether the intervention is 
associated with changes in the corresponding measure.  
 
2. NPPC use. This is collected as a binary value for each of 14 modalities, 
collected at one time point, 3 months post -operative. We will sum these to 
create a score, and use a model similar to (1) but without a baseline value Y ij0:  
𝑌𝑖𝑗=𝛽0+𝛽𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑗+𝛽𝑇𝑇+𝚩𝑿 𝑿𝒊𝒋+𝚩𝒁𝒁𝒋+𝑢𝑗+𝑒𝑖𝑗   (2) 
Again by testing I = 0 we can assess whether the intervention is associated with 
changes in the corresponding measure.  
3.  Opioid use will be measured using 4 outcomes:   
a.      Hospital -based consumption, daily oral morphine equivalents (OMEs). 
This is a continuous measure for each day of hospitalization; we will 
assume that this depends in part on the day post surgery, D ij and model  
 
𝑌𝑖𝑗=𝛽0+𝛽𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑗+𝛽𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑗+𝛽𝑇𝑇+𝚩𝑿 𝑿𝒊𝒋+𝚩𝒁𝒁𝒋+𝑢𝑗+𝑒𝑖𝑗   (3) 
 
For this model we will consider D ij as first continuous and then as 
categorical.   
 
b.      Discharge and post -discharge prescriptions, daily oral morphine 
equivalents (OMEs). For this outcome, we will use a model analogous to 
(3), where D ij is replaced by number of days post discharge.  
 
c.      Number of post -discharge prescriptions. These are counts for the 3 month 
period following surgery. The impact of the intervention will be assessed 
using a model similar to (2) but with a Poisson link function:  
 
 
𝑙𝑛(𝐸(𝑌𝑖𝑗)) ~ 𝛽0+𝛽𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑗+𝛽𝑇𝑇+𝚩𝑿 𝑿𝒊𝒋+𝚩𝒁𝒁𝒋+𝑢𝑗+𝑒𝑖𝑗   (4) 
𝑌𝑖𝑗~ 𝑃𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑜𝑛 (𝜇) 
 
 We will assess the distribution first using an empty model, and potentially 
adopt a zero inflated Poisson, negative binomial, or zero inflated negative 
binomial according to the corresponding AIC values.  
 
d.      Daily use of opioids; this is binary outcome collected one time, at 3 
months post -surgery. To assess the impact of the intervention we will use a 
model similar to (4) but with a logit link:  
 
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  28 of 47 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡 (𝑌𝑖𝑗) ~ 𝛽0+𝛽𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑗+𝛽𝑇𝑇+𝚩𝑿 𝑿𝒊𝒋+𝚩𝒁𝒁𝒋+𝑢𝑗+𝑒𝑖𝑗   (5) 
 
For a -d we can again test I = 0 we can assess whether the intervention is 
associated with changes in the corresponding measure.  
4.  Healthcare utilization  
a.      Hospitalizations  
b.      ER visits  
c.      Calls to surgical practice  
 
All three of these are count outcomes, and so we will assess the impact of the 
intervention using a model similar to (4) above. As with (4), we will compare 
model specifications using an empty model first to determine the best count 
family (Poisson, negati ve binomial, zero inflated or not) using AIC, then apply 
that in the final model.  
12.6 Subgroup analyses  
12.6.1  Clinical and Demographic subgroups  
Subgroup analyses will be performed for a) separate procedures  b) separate age 
groups  c) separate genders and d) separate racial/ethnic groups.  Patients will be 
stratified using each classifier and the primary analyses replicated in each 
subgroup.  
12.6.2  Patients at risk of u nplanned prolonged opioid use (UPOU).   
Hypothesis: P atients at moderate to high risk for  UPOU , defined by score 
on the pain catastrophizing scale, pre-operative opioid use, and/or chronic 
pain will use NPPC modalities significantly less frequently than patients 
who are at low risk of UPOU.   
Self-reported use of NPPC, expressed as a binary (Yes/No) response and 
assessed at 3 month post -surgical time point, will be compared between 
patient subgroups stratified by UPOU risk.   
12.6.3  Patients who are r urally situated.  
Hypothesis. Patients who are rurally situated , as defined by US Census 
Bureau criteria, will use NPPC modalities significantly less frequently than 
patients who are situated in urbanized areas and urban clusters .   
Self-reported use of NPPC, expressed as a binary (Yes/No) response and 
assessed at 3 -month post -surgical time point, will be compared across  
patient subgroups defined by US Census Bureau urban/rural criteria . 
 
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  29 of 47 12.7 Supplementary Analyses  
12.7.1  Moderators  
In supplementary analyses we will assess whether procedure, age, sex, or 
race/ethnicity moderate the intervention effect. The models (1) -(5) used in the 
primary analysis will be expanded to include indictors for one of these subgroup 
classifiers, as well as the interaction with interventio n status. By testing whether the 
interaction effect differs from zero, we can assess whether these factors moderate 
the intervention.  
12.7.2  Mediators  
In related supplementary analyses, we will test whether interim patient measures 
mediate the effect of the intervention on the separate outcomes. We will adapt 
models (1) -(5) to path analysis, a type of structural equation model, which will 
allow us to spe cify an indirect effect (of the intervention through the potential 
mediator) and test whether it is non -zero.

including data managers, analysts, and/or statisticians. All data will exist prior to 
the time of access, and no further patient contact is needed for the above data 
points.  
Once extracted from the E HR, data will be maintained on secure, encrypted, 
password protected research servers at Mayo Clinic. Access to data files will be 
restricted to individuals listed in the protocol approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB.  
13.2 Data Management  
Individual sites in the NOHARM project (specifically MC Rochester, MC Arizona, 
MC Jacksonville, MC La  Crosse, MC Mankato,  and MC Eau Claire) will not be 
required to conduct any site - or study -specific, manual data collection. All study 
sites use a unified electronic medical record ( Epic) and programmatic data 
extract ion can be conducted by study team personnel at the coordinating center 
(MC Rochester).  
The coordinating center (MC Rochester) will extract  data from the electronic 
medical record as need ed to assess the fidelity of routine data collection activities, 
evaluate the completeness of data collection, and to conduct comprehensive data 
pulls for the final analysis.  
Data collection forms are not  applicable to our study design as all data will be 
recorded  as part of usual care and electronically retrieved from the medical record 
by study staff.  
13.3 Quality Assurance  
13.3.1  Training  
Data will be extract ed, compiled  and analyzed by personnel on the study 
team who have expertise in data management , informatics and statistical 
methods.  
13.3.2  Quality Control Committee  
Data will be electronically extracte d from the EHR and validated against the 
clinical record. Chart -audit will occur at 3 -month intervals, on 2 -5%, 
depending on capacity, of patients for each of the most recently activated 
clusters. These audits are intended to insure that data extraction pr ocedures 
are functioning as expected for each cluster.    
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  32 of 47 13.3.3  Metrics  
The study team will validate electronic data pulls against the EHR as 
needed.  
13.3.4  Protocol Deviations  
Protocol deviations will be reported promptly to the Mayo Clinic IRB  upon 
the study team being made aware of the deviations . The main opportunity 
for protocol deviation s is the mis -routing of patients to wrong study arm 
(intervention or control). Care will be taken to make sure the EHR 
assignment  algorithms are functioning properly. Protocol modifications will 
be made as new tranches are brought into the intervention arm of the study.  
The following are examples of potential protocol deviations which will be 
carefully avoided, but reported if they occur:  
1. Implementing the intervention without practice approvals.  
As indicated in the protocol and elsewhere , we will be engaging with 
practice leadership in advance of implementing the NOHARM intervention. 
Failure to duly engage practice leadership and obtain documented approval 
prior to implementing the intervention in specific surgical practices would 
violate expectations set in the protocol.  
2. Incorrect routing of patients to intervention/control arms.  
Patient assignment to either the treatment or control arm of the study  within 
the EHR  will be done via pre-specified algorithm s. Rigorous testing and 
validation will be done to ensure the algorithms are functioning as expected. 
Should th e algorithm s fail to properly assign patients to the treatment or 
control arm of the study , appropriate action will be taken to refine the 
algorithms to prevent further mis -assignment and  the affected patients will 
be accounted for , as appropriate , in the study analys es. 
3. Failure to monitor trial for data quality and patient safety.  
Per the protocol, we will monitor study implementation —particularly 
within the surgical practices in which the NOHARM intervention has been 
implemented —to ensure that the intervention is functioning as 
designed/intended and that critical data points are being captured. Further , 
the protocol assumes that data essential for monitoring patient safety and 
ensuring data quality will be abstracted as needed and made available to the 
data safety and monitoring board for review.  
4. Study staff not included in IRB documentation.  
All personnel on the study who will be involved with the conduct of the 
research  must be included in IRB documentation per Mayo Clinic policy. 
This excludes members who are involved with NOHARM as Standard of 
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  33 of 47 Care. Failure to disclose personnel actively involved in the study conduct 
will constitute a protocol  deviation . 
5. Failure to apprise the IRB of updated patient contact materials or study 
procedures.  
It is possible that some of the patient contact materials, including elements 
of the decision aid, after visit summaries, and resource materials provided to 
patients will be updated with alternate and or additional information 
throughout the course of the study. Failure to apprise the IRB of these 
modifications and/or to document these updates as potentially important 
covariates in analysis will be considered a deviation from protocol.  
13.3.5  Monitoring  
The study will be monitored by the DSMB in a manner and frequency 
prescribe d by NIA /NIH . 
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  34 of 47 14 PARTICIPANT  RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY   
14.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Review  
This protocol and any subsequent modifications will be reviewed and approved by 
the Mayo Clinic IRB.  
14.2 Informed Consent Forms  & Authorization Considerations  
A waiver of informed consent is being requested for this study, which presents no 
more than minimal risk of harm to subjects. Because this is a population -based, 
EHR -embedded study, it is not practical to conduct the research without the waiver 
of consent. We do not feel the w aiver of informed consent will adversely affect the 
rights or welfare of the subjects.    
In lieu of consent, we have sought out and confirmed Mayo Clinic Practice 
leadership support for the trial.  In the 3 -6 months prior to each wave of trial 
implementation we will confirm each individual practices ’ willingness to 
participate in the trial.  Because some practices will not be randomized until 2023, 
securing their endorsement now, did not make sense.   
See Section 1 5 – Ethical Considerations for more information.  
14.3 Participant Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential.  
Only NOHARM study team members (study investigators, project coordinators, 
research assistants, data managers, biostatisticians, etc.) who are IRB -approved 
study staff will have access to individually identifiable private information 
collected for study purposes, except as necessary for monitoring, audits and/or 
inspections by the IRB, the NIA, and/or government regulatory agencies.  
Data that are transferred outside of the M ayo Clinic firewall will be de -identified, 
stripped of personal health information, and encrypted.  
14.4 Study Discontinuation  
The study may be discontinued at any time by the principal investigators, the IRB, 
the NIA, the DSMB, or other government agencies as part of their duties to ensure 
that research participants are protected.  
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  35 of 47 15 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This is a population -based study, where all eligible patients undergoing qualifying 
surgeries at participating Mayo Clinic locations will be “enrolled .” Neither current 
regulations, nor the peer -reviewed literature explicitly defines when a formal patient 
consent process is required for pragmatic clinical trials, particularly when testing the 
implementation of proven -effective interventions at scale. This  type of research, sometimes 
referred to as “standard of care” research, in which the primary research o bjective is to 
implement and evaluate a strategy that better satisfies the existing clinical standard of care, 
has been debated in recent high -profile cases.70-72 Opinions from ethicists vary but all 
emphasize the vital importance of IRB engagement and assiduous efforts to foster 
disclosure and transparency across all relevant stakeholders.73-75 We believe, and in 
consultation with our local Research Ethics Consult Service have confirmed, that this study 
meets the criteria for being standard of care researc h in which the marginal incremental 
risks of the proposed interventions do not foreseeably introduce even incremental net risk 
to individuals in the participating practices being studied. The M ayo Clinic IRB has been 
an active partner in developing the NOHARM application and its involvement will 
continue.  Preliminary discussion s with  the M ayo Clinic IRB executive committee in 
January 2020 concluded this study is minimal risk and that waiver of consent was 
warranted so long as practice endorsement was secur ed.  
IRB members and the M ayo Clinic Family Advisory Council contributed to the current 
NOHARM “Transparency Promotion and Patient Preference Protection Plan.” The 
Transparency Promotion and Patient Preference Protection Plan is a multi -pronged 
approach that was in place prior to planning an d design of the NOHARM trial, but that has 
further matured as a consequence of these efforts. The M ayo Clinic Enterprise, in an effort 
to proactively anticipate ethics, human subject protections, and institutional oversight 
concerns related to the conduct of quality improvement, pragmatic, and “standard of care” 
trials convened a group of key stakeholders. These stakeholders include members of the 
Mayo Clinic IRB, M ayo Clinic Patient and Family Advisory Council, representatives from 
Enterprise Research Administration, and clinicians representing surgical specialties, pain 
management, pharmacy, rehabilitation medicine, and general internal medicine. This 
stakeholder group is en trusted to provide impartial oversight of trial activities that may 
challenge the g oal of complete pan -stakeholder transparency and prioritization of patient 
preference.

o Mayo Clinic Nursing Practice Council  
o EHR/RMC Oversight Committee  
o Surgical and Procedural Committee  
o Surgical Specialty Councils  
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  39 of 47 17 PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH FINDINGS  
The trial will be registered on ClinicalTrials.gov and the NOHARM investigative team will 
follow the requirements outlined in the NIH Policy on Dissemination of NIH -Funded 
Clinical Trial Information. Mayo Clinic has an established internal policy in place to 
ensure that clinical trials registration and results reporting occur in compliance with the 
policy requirements.  
Mayo Clinic strongly supports investigators to present at relevant regional, national, and 
international meetings. Opportunities such as these are both opportunities to share 
knowledge and also cultivate new ideas among colleagues. Given our expertise, div erse 
collaborators, and distinct focus in the project, we foresee a number of manuscript and 
presentation opportunities. We will publish rigorous visible results in quality journals.  
Mayo Clinic ’s office of Scientific Publications also supports investigators in developing 
journal articles, chapters, and complete books for academic publication. Additionally, the 
Mayo Clinic College of Medicine supports the development of educational content 
through out its five schools, ensuring that new, groundbreaking ideas are quickly spread to 
learners at nearly every level of medical education. Importantly, new education spreads 
beyond our own doors in numerous ways. Especially important is the Mayo School of 
Continuous Professional Development, accredited by the ACCME.

Clinician Participants  
The clinical practice s of care teams involved in the care of surgery patients targeted by the 
NOHARM intervention —including surgeons, nurses, physical therapists, pain management 
specialists —will be impacted by the bundled NOHARM intervention. In the course of providing 
care to surgical patients in active intervention clusters, clinicians will be alerted  to non-
pharmacological pain management strategies  (via CDS tools embedded in the EHR ) for which 
patients have expressed preference . Within their routine wo rkflows  (i.e. interface with patients) , 
clinicians will be prompted to engage patients about their preferred post-acute pain 
management strateg ies. 
 
Because of this practice impact, clinicians will be considered  “participants” in the NOHARM 
pragmatic trial (in the same way as they have been construed in the pilot application IRB# 20 -
001864).  This determination has  been affirmed by the Mayo Clinic IRB executive committee 
(January 2020 meeting) . 
 
Accrual  
Based on data from 2018 on the 22 surgery types targeted by the NOHARM trial (minus neuro / 
spine surgery which is the focus of the NOHARM pilot trial – IRB# 20-001864 ) we estimate 
there to be approximately 225 surgeons in the enterprise who are routinely performing surgery. 
We will inflate this number to 300 to account for physicians performing one of the target surgery 
types less frequently. To this figure, we will add 0.5 residents / and 0.5 physician assistants per 
surgeon (+300). Assuming a median hosp ital stay of 3 days (9 nursing shift changes), we will 
add 9 nurses X 300 surgeons (+2700). Finally, assuming 0.5 physical therapist per surgeon and 
0.2 integrative medicine specialist per surgeon, we will add 210 clinicians . This brings our total 
estimated clinician accrual to 3510 participants.  
 
Consent  and Data Collection  
 
1. Given the ubiquity of the intervention and the volume of clinicians touched by  the trial it 
will not be practicable to obtain individual consent for participation.  
2. Clinician “consent” will be granted in the form of “ whole practice  consent” granted by 
individual surgical practice leadership within the institution as a pre -requisite for 
implementation in specific surgical practices.  
3. It would be impracticable to  formal ly track  clinicians  as we are not documenting 
individual consent nor collecting data  from clinicians . Although we could potentially 
identify the number of clinicians who log into Epic to provide care for discreet surgery 
patients, this approach would be imprecise.  
4. No clinician variables —including clinician ordering or prescribing behaviors —are being 
assessed. All study outcomes are patient outcomes, as the intervention is intended to 
guide the patient’s surgical recovery experience.  
 
Risks and Benefits  
The risks to clinicians involved in the NOHARM  trial are minimal. Clinicians are  already 
motivated  to employ clinical guidelines for non -pharmacological pain management, and the 
NOHARM pilot study may  enhance their personal success that effort. Clinicians may find , 
perhaps at first,  that the EHR -based prompts interfere with the rhythms of their workflow, but 
NOHARM  Protocol , Version 5.0 
Page  44 of 47 great effort has been invested to ensure that the EHR-emedded clinical decision support tools 
integrate seamlessly into existing workflows. Further, the Mayo Clinic Clinical Practice 
Committee has endorsed the intervention as an appropriate element for institutional 
improvement in the management of post -surgical pain . Ongoing c are will be taken to minimize 
the workflow  burden while making the  EHR  prompts an effective tool in promoting institutional 
adherence to clinical guidelines.  Clinicians will always be  able to make professional judgments 
about the appropriateness of engaging patients in specific conversations about pain 
management throughout the patients ’ post-surgical recovery. Clinicians may freely disregard 
EHR -prompts as they deem appropriate in their professional judgment.  Clinicians will be amply 
supported by the study team by way of education and through access to study team members 
with expertise in non -pharmacological pain management modalities and in the management of 
complex pain management cases.

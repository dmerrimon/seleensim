Protocol  
Abstract  
Quantitative radiographic imaging holds promise as a novel and innovative strategy to assess ventral hernia 
patients. We will identify features of the abdominal wall that differ between healthy volunteers and subjects 
scheduled to have ventral hernia repair. We will assess abdominal wall  changes  surrounding ventral hernia 
using shear wave velocity values measured with ultr asound. Up to  25  subjects previously diagnosed with 
ventral hernia seeking surgical repair will receive ultrasound prior to repair and following repair and will 
be compared to up to 25 healthy  volunteers.  
 
Objectives  
Overall objectives  
Identify characte ristic changes in the abdominal wall associated with ventral hernia. Determine elasticy of 
the abdominal wall in subjects known to have a hernia defect to those who are determined to have normal 
abdominal wall anatomy.  
 
Primary outcome variable(s)  
Sheer wave velocity measurements in the abdominal wall.  
 
Secondary outcome variable(s)  
Identification of any association between muscular elasticity/stiffness of the abdominal and surgical 
data/outcomes of the hernia repair.  
 
Background  
Significance of hernia and magnitude of the problem: Two million abdominal surgeries are performed 
annually in the United States, and ventral hernia (VH) is among the most common and serious 
complications(1, 2). The incidence of VH is approximately 13%(3),  but as high as 70% in high- risk 
populations(1, 4- 8). Despite improving surgical treatment strategies and mesh technology, long -term 
success rates of VH repair remain unacceptably low. The 348,000 VH repairs performed in 2006 cost over 
$3 billion (2). As a  result of recurrence and morbidity, a disproportionately small subset (15%) of patients 
consumes more than 50% of expenditures(9), and become caught in the vicious cycle of hernia recurrence 
and morbidity. Failed repairs generate un -closable midline defects that require  mesh  bridging, meaning 
that native fascia cannot be closed and that mesh is bridged across  the  fascia. Bridging is a relevant and 
clinically meaningful outcome that occurs during the repair and has  significant implications since these 
repairs fail in 44 to 100% of cases and are associated  with  significant cost (8, 10 -13). Patients suffering 
from recurring hernia experience deterioration in quality - of-life, significant disability, and dysfunction; if 
un-closable defects can be identif ied using a point -of- care technology peri -operative decision -making 
could be substantially improved. Role of imaging in hernia care: There are currently no reliable data, 
standard imaging modalities, or guidelines available to predict successful fascial closure in hernia repair, 
which represents a substantial gap in knowledge and barrier to progress (4, 14 -16). Surgeons are unable to 
adequately counsel patients and preoperatively  plan complex VH repairs, which presents a clinical 
dilemma. The current stat e of hernia repair relies heavily on clinical evaluation of patients, which, as stated, 
is ultimately a poor predictor of patient outcome going into surgery for hernia repair. Additionally, there 
is a dearth of data regarding the use of various  imaging modalities  to diagnose  and predict  hernia  outcomes  
of any kind.  As of today,  the only 
Page 9 of 16   recommended radiologic technique for the evaluation of hernia is CT, a costly and ultimately ineffective 
measure (17). If a technique leveraging the strengths of ultrasound (US) could be developed, it would   be 
far superior to other modalities in terms of cost, time, and patient safety (Table 1) (18). There is little 
evidence regarding the role of ultrasound performed by surgeons in the diagnosis of hernias of any type 
Clearly, hernia ultrasound has the potential to be highly useful for surgical practice, however a well - 
designed trial needs to  be carried out(14). Hernia leads to abdominal wall muscle fibrosis and decreased 
compliance, which presents an opportunity to quantify this change using specialized  imaging  techniques. 
Muscle fibrosis impedes closure (leading to bridging), and unloaded skeletal muscle undergoes 
architectural atrophic changes such as altered fiber composition, diminished cross -sectional area, and 
fibrosis that has been shown to be detectable and quantifiable (19, 20). Quantitative imaging using 
Acoustic Radiation Forced I mpulse Shear Wave Velocity (ARFI -SWV) holds promise as a novel and 
innovative strategy to assess skeletal muscle pathology(21), and has already proven useful in evaluating 
fibromuscular disorders by quantitating stiffness and fibrosis (21, 22). Hernia  repair  outcomes are likely 
impacted by morphological changes that occur in the abdominal wall when significant fibrosis occurs. 
Clinically relevant target features include abdominal wall muscle thickness, pre- existing defects in the 
abdominal wall, or assess ment of mechanical characteristics of muscular  layers such as fibrosis or fatty 
infiltration (19, 20, 23). Clinical Implications and Future Directions: Completing this study will provide 
an opportunity to advance the applications of ARFI -SWV  US imaging m odalities for risk prediction of 
complex VH defects, translating this tool into the clinic as a point -of-care prognostic aid. The ability to 
preoperatively identify un- closable hernia defects represents an innovative strategy to an unmet clinical 
need with  the potential to greatly impact thousands of  patients. Following this critical, inter -disciplinary 
pilot, our team will have a reproducible and reliable quantitative tool. This translational research of proven 
concepts across multiple  medical  fields  r epresents a significant collaborative effort and is just the first 
step that will be the foundation for future studies. The results of this proposal will be used to refine a 
protocol for  preoperative  shear  wave velocity assessment in complex VH patients . The proposed 
translational research study represents a strong and promising collaborative effort between radiology, 
biomedical imaging, and surgery that will build upon recent work and cutting edge technology, setting in 
motion future research opportunit ies.   The NIH states, The success of a potential shift from curative 
medicine, to predictive, personalized, and preemptive medicine could rely on the development of portable 
diagnostic and monitoring devices for point -of-care testing(25). It is with this notion in mind that we 
propose this work. We hope to develop a point -of-care technique that will allow the surgeon to pre -
operatively assess the outcome of surgery at the bedside. Establishing a point -of-care test will allow 
surgeons to personalize their a pproach to each patient and avoid submitting patients to the spiral of hernia 
recurrence and morbidity. References 1. Candage R, Jones K, Luchette FA, Sinacore JM, Vandevender D,

Study Design 
Phase*  
Not applicable  
 
Design  
Proposed Study Aims: Creating a protocol and using an existing technology to enhance informed risk 
counseling at the point -of-care will empower surgeons to personalize their approach to each patient, 
enhancing the informed decision process, fostering great er patient autonomy, and improving quality of 
care (24). ARFI -SWV US holds promise as an inexpensive, noninvasive, point -of-care diagnostic tool  for 
pre-operatively predicting successful repair at the bedside. We will measure abdominal wall features 
suita ble for predicting successful closure of the midline fascia. To accomplish these goals, we propose  the 
following aims: Aim 1. To develop and refine a quantitative ultrasound protocol to  assess  mechanical 
changes in abdominal tissue. ARFI -SWV US represen ts a novel and intriguing modality   for 
Page 11 of 16   real time visualization and characterization of changes in the biomechanical properties of diseased 
musculoskeletal tissues. We hypothesize that ARFI -SWV US can be used preoperatively to measure the 
stiffness in the lateral abdominal wall as an estimation for mobility during hernia repair. Demonstrating 
the utility of a cheap, point -of-care test for preoperatively evaluating hernia severity will prove to be a 
valuable, novel tool in surgical assessment of ventral hernia patients. Aim 2. To perform a prospective pilot 
ARFI -SWV US assessment of abdominal wall characteristics that predicts success  of  midline fascial re-
approximation in hernia patients. A prospective comparative analysis of preoperative AR FI- SWV US 
exams in patients undergoing hernia repair (N=25) will be performed. We hypothesize that fibrosis and 
other identifiable mechanical characteristics of the abdominal wall musculature can predict ability to close 
fascia in VH patients. Preoperativ e identification of ultrasound features characteristic of severe hernia 
defects can be used to predict which hernias will be un -closable, resulting in poorer outcomes. The study 
proposes to compare ultrasound images and associated shear wave velocity measu rements between healthy 
subjects and subjects undergoing surgical repair for ventral hernia. We will compare up to 25 healthy 
volunteers with up to 25 ventral hernia subjects. Any female patients of child- bearing age will be asked to 
take a urine pregnancy  test prior to being included in the study at the time of consent. Subjects with ventral 
hernia will undergo imaging no earlier than two weeks prior to elective hernia repair and within six months 
following repair at a standard followup visit. Medical info rmation related to their hernia or hernia repair 
from these subjects will remain available for analysis for the duration of the study. Statistical analysis will 
determine if there is a significant difference in the abdominal wall stiffness, represented by the ultrasound 
shear wave velocity measurements, between the healthy subjects and the subjects with ventral hernia. 
Further analysis will determine if there is any statistically significant relationship between abdominal wall 
stiffness of subjects with ven tral hernia and surgical outcomes, including bridged repairs, as well as any 
change in abdominal wall stiffness  following ventral hernia  repair.  
 
Study duration 
All subjects will undergo about 40 minutes of ultrasound imaging. Subject who undergo hernia r epair will 
have the same ultrasound imaging done at a standard follow up visit, within six months from the repair 
itself. following Subjects who undergo surgical repair for ventral hernia will have relevant information 
from their medical records included i n the study for up to 1  year.  
 
Resources necessary for human research protection

research. Describe how you will ensure that all staff assisting  with the research are adequately informed 
about the protocol and their research related duties. Please allow adequate time for the researchers to 
conduct and complete the research. Please confirm that there are adequate facilities for   the  research.  
All members of the study team completed mandatory CITI research training and agree to follow 
established guidelines to ensure the privacy and respect for study participants. The PI will provide 
oversight for the study.  
 
 
 
Characteristics of the Study Population 
Target population  
Up to 25 healthy, adult volunteer subjects and 25 adult subjects seeking surgical repair for ventral   hernia 
between the ages of 20 and  70. 
 
Subjects enrolled by Penn Researchers

Accrual  
Patients of Dr. John Fischer, Dr. Sean Harbison, Dr. Noel Williams, Dr. Daniel Dempsey, or Dr. Stephen 
Kovach seeking surgical repair for ventral hernia will be invited to participate in the study b y members  of 
the study team through word of mouth. Healthy volunteers will be invited through word of mouth   by 
Page 12 of 16   study team members and will be composed for the most part, friends, family, and colleagues. It will be 
clearly stated that parti cipation is completely voluntary and that their participation is for the purpose of  
research. Because ultrasound is such a common diagnostic tool, it is anticipated that participants will  know 
what is involved and that it is a painless procedure that takes  less than an hour.  
 
Key inclusion criteria  
Adults between the ages of 20 and 70. Healthy volunteer (25) or subject seeking elective ventral hernia 
repair (25).  
 
Key exclusion criteria  
Pregnant women will not be included in the study. Although ultrasound is a common procedure during 
pregnancy, our results regarding abdominal wall stiffness as they relate to hernia repair would be 
compromised by not controlling for other factors that affe ct the abdominal wall, such as physiologic 
changes during pregnancy.

which may carry a potential for central nervous system (CNS) effect(s)? 
No 
 
Procedures  
First Encounter: After informed consent is obtained by a  member of the study team, each healthy volunteer 
and patient seeking ventral hernia repair will undergo ultrasound imaging for about  40  minutes as per the 
procedure outlined below. Any women of childbearing age will be asked to take a urine pregnancy test 
prior to enrollment. The ultrasound machine is the Siemens Acuson S3000 and our protocol is within its 
FDA  approved label. The ultrasound imaging will focus on the abdominal wall   and avoid areas with the 
potential for incidental findings, such as the  gall bladder.  Ultrasound   Protocol:  
1) Subject will be relaxed with shallow breathing and arm crossing over the chest. 2) Ultrasound transducer 
pressure will be minimal. 3) Ultrasound transducer will be perpendicular to the abdominal wall. 4) 
Transducer  to be used: Linear or curved. 5) Grayscale Parameters: Abdominal wall musculature thickness 
in lateral mid abdomen (internal oblique, external oblique and transverse abdominis and   rectus abdominis 
muscles. 6) Measurements will be in orthogonal planes 7)  Repeat same procedure on the contra- lateral 
side 8) Color Doppler: Color Doppler image with optimum sensitivity along with grayscale images. Shear 
Wave Measurements: 1) A total of 10 measurements  using  quantification  mode, with ROI  placed within 
the m usculature in lateral mid abdomen 2) Elastography using Color   Map generation (two times in same 
region) within the musculature in lateral mid abdomen 3) Same measurements to be obtained for rectus 
abdominis muscle 4) Same measurements to be obtained for contralateral side Healthy volunteers will be 
thanked for their participation and subjects seeking ventral hernia repair return to their day and will 
eventually undergo standard treatment they would have otherwise done if they were not included in the 
study. Subjects who undergo ventral hernia repair will have followup care as per their standard treatment 
and information obtained through chart review regarding their medical course and surgical outcome/data 
(such as hernia defect size, if repair required com ponents separation or mesh, complications ) will be 
included in the study analysis. Follow up Encounter: Subject who underwent surgical repair will also be 
asked to repeat the  exact  same  ultrasound evaluation at a standard follow up visit with their sur geon 
within six months of their hernia repair.

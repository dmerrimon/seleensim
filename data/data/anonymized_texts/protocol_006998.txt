Title of the Protocol:  
A MULTICENTER, RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE -BLIND, PARALLEL -GROUP, PLACEBO -
CONTROLL ED STUDY EVALUATING THE EFFICACY, SAFETY, AND 
PHARMACOKINETICS OF SAGE -217 IN THE TREATMENT OF ADULT FEMALE SUBJECTS 
WITH SEVERE POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION  
Study Sites: Approximately 60  sites in the United States  
Primary Efficacy Objective:  
To determine if tr eatment with SAGE -217 reduces depressive symptoms in subjects with severe  
postpartum depression (PPD) compared to placebo as assessed by the  change from baseline in the 
17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM -D) total score at D ay 15. 
Secondary Efficacy Objectives:  
• To determine if treatment with SAGE -217 Capsules 30 mg QD  reduces depressive 
symptoms in subjects with severe PPD  compared to placebo as assessed by the change 
from baseline in the HAM -D total score at all other time points .  
• To determi ne if treatment with SAGE -217 Capsules 30 mg QD  reduces depressive 
symptoms compared to placebo as assessed by HAM -D response, HAM -D remission, 
change from baseline in Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total 
score, Clinical Global Impressio n – Improvement (CGI -I) response, and changes from 
baseline in HAM -D subscales and individual item scores at Day 15 and all other time 
points .  
• To determine if treatment with SAGE -217 Capsules 30 mg QD  reduces anxiety symptoms 
compared to placebo as assess ed by changes from baseline in Hamilton Anxiety Rating 
Scale (HAM -A) total score Day 15 and all other time points .  
Safety Objective:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SAGE -217 compared to placebo as assessed by 
the incidence of adverse events, vi tal sign measurements, clinical laboratory evaluations, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
(C-SSRS) .

Study Design and Methodology:   
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo -controlled study of the 
efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of SAGE -217 in adult subjects diagnosed with severe PPD .  
The study will be conducted in 2 parts . One subject was enrolle d and dosed in Part A before it was 
closed to enrollment (see Protocol Amendment 2, Version 3.0); the current amendment describes 
Part B only.  
Screening Period:  
The Screening Period will begin with the signature of the informed consent form (ICF) . The dia gnosis 
of depression will be determined using the Structured Clinical  Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders -5 (DSM -5) Axis I Disorders (SCID -I). Eligibility will be determined by 
applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria . A full medical and family history will be taken including 
recording of all ma jor depression episodes, other Axis I and Axis II disorders, and postpartum 
depression episodes in immediate female family members .  
Treatment Period:   
Once subjects are confirmed as eligible for the study, they will be randomized to active study drug or 
placebo on a 1:1 basis .  
Randomized subjects will receive 30  mg QD of study drug (SAGE -217 Capsules or placebo). Those 
subjects who cannot tolerate 30 mg QD will receive 20 mg QD for t he remainder of the Treatment 
Period. Subjects who experience intolerable adverse events (AEs) at the 20 mg QD dose level may be 
discontinued from study treatment at the discretion of the Investigator. Subjects will be instructed to

Binary efficacy endpoints, including responder and remission endpoints, will be summarized and 
analyzed using the generalized estimating equation method .  
Adverse events wil l be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA™)  
Version 19.1 or higher. The overall incidence of adverse events will be displayed by System Organ 
Class, preferred term, and treatment . The incidence of adverse events will also be pre sented by 
maximum severity and relationship to study drug . Vital signs, clinical laboratory measures, ECG, 
concomitant medication usage, and C -SSRS data will be summarized by treatment, where applicable . 
Out-of-range safety endpoints may be categorized as low or high, where applicable . Safety data will be 
summarized and examined for possible  relationships between subject characteristics and plasma 
SAGE -217 concentrations, as appropriate . Suicidality data collected using the C -SSRS at baseline and 
at each vi sit during the active Treatment Period will be listed for all subjects . The C -SSRS listings will 
include behavior type and/or category for suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior of the C -SSRS.  
Sample Size Calculation:  
Assuming a 2 -sided test at an alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of approximately 65 subjects per 
treatment group would provide 90% power to detect a placebo -adjusted treatment difference of 
approximately 4 points in the primary endpoint, change from baseline in HAM -D total score at Day 15 
assuming standard deviation (SD) of 7 points.  
Assuming a 10% dropout and a 1:1 randomization ratio, approximately 72 randomized subjects per 
treatment group will be required to obtain 130 evaluable subjects. Evaluable subjects are defined as 
those randomiz ed subjects who received study drug and have a valid baseline and at least 1 post -
baseline HAM -D assessment. Additional subjects may be randomized if the dropout rate is higher than 
10%.

    5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1. Backgro und of Postpartum Depression and Unmet Medical Need  
Postpartum depression  (PPD)  is defined as the occurrence of major depressive episode  within 
4 weeks of delivery ( DSM -IV 1994 ) or up to a year after giving birth ( Okun 2013 ). In Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM -5), the onset specifier includes the entire 
pregnancy as well as 4 weeks following delivery  (DSM -5 2013 ). There are 2  entry criteria for the 
diagnosis of depression (depressed mood and/or loss of interest) and 7  associated s ymptoms of 
depression (appetite problems, sleep problems, motor problems, lack of concentration, loss of 
energy, poor self -esteem, and suicidality) . To be diagnosed with severe PPD, women must 
present at least 5  symptoms of depression ( DSM -5 2013 ). Most wo men experience onset of 
symptoms within the first 3 months following delivery, and PPD is most prevalent at 10 to 
14 weeks following childbirth ( Okun 2013 ). The o verall incidence  of PPD  is estimated at around 
15% to 20% , with up to 10% being considered sev ere (Edge  2007 ; O’Hara  2014 ). Although 
frequently recognized in the postpartum period, depressive episodes can also begin in the last 
trimester or earlier during pregnancy ( Meltzer -Brody 2011 ).  
Converging preclinical and clinical evidence ( Luscher  2011 ) implicates deficits in GABAergic 
neurotransmission in the pathophysiology of depressive disorders including PPD . Furthermore, 
several pieces of experimental data implicate deficiencies in the normal regulation of 
endogenous neuroactive steroid in depressive  disorders ( Maguire 2008 ; Mag uire 2009 ). It is 
thought that the large increase in progesterone -derived neurosteroids during pregnancy and their 
precipitous decrease at parturition may have considerable effects on γ-aminobutyric acid -gated 
chloride channel (GABA A) receptors during pregnancy and postpartum leading to PPD . The 
dynamic trafficking of extrasynaptic (δ -containing) GABA A receptors may be an important 
compensatory mechanism to changing neurosteroid levels during healthy pregnancies, and this 
trafficking pattern may be disrupted in PPD ( Maguire 2008 ; Maguire 2009 ). In a preclinical 
model of PPD, mice lacking GABA A receptor δ -subunits (Gabrd -/- mice) exhibit postpartum -
specific phenotypes including reduced t onic inhibition, neuronal hyperexcitability, depressive -
like behaviors, and profound deficits in maternal care ( Maguire 2008 ; Maguire 2009 ). In this 
model, the onset of depression -like behaviors occurred only in the postpartum period and 
included a signifi cant increase in pup mortality due to maternal neglect and cannibalism, 
analogous to the increase in infanticide observed in human women with PPD . These data suggest 
that augmenting extrasynaptic GABA A receptor function may provide a therapeutic benefit in  
PPD.  
Current standard of care for severe PPD comprises cautious use of pharmacological therapies in 
nursing mothers combined with other interventions . Evidence for efficacy of tricyclic 
antidepressants and/or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI s) is based on use in the 
general population rather than any extensive studies in PPD ( Austin 2013 ), and SSRIs tend to be 
preferred due to better data on safety while breastfeeding ( Altshuler 2001 ). Based on the level of 
evidence for antidepressants in maj or depressive disorder ( Kirsch 2008 ; Fournier 2010 ), there is 
a considerable need for improved pharmacological therapy for PPD .  
Drugs may be combined with a number of counseling, behavioral, and other nonpharmacological 
therapy approaches, which are gener ally used as the first -line therapy in less severe PPD 
(Altshuler 2001 ). Urgent referral and potentially admission are recommended for mothers at risk

 23  
    of self -harm, with their infants, if such facilities exist ( Austin 2013 ). Therapeutic options in 
severe P PD are currently limited, and it is not clear whether the current standard of care impacts 
the natural history of the disease, although most women recover within a year .  
5.2. SAGE -217 
SAGE -217 is a synthetic neuroactive steroid and a positive allosteric modula tor of GABA A 
receptors, the major class of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain and representing 
the most highly expressed synaptic and extrasynaptic inhibitory receptors in the mammalian 
brain. Consistent with the actions of other GABA A receptor potentiators 
(Rudolph  and Knoflach  2011 ), SAGE -217 exhibits potent anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and 
sedative activity when administered in vivo and pharmacological data provide evidence that 
SAGE -217 is a potent and efficacious neuroactive steroid and potentiator of multiple subtypes of 
GABA A receptors.  
To date, the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK)  of SAGE -217 (Oral 
Solution and Capsules) have been evaluated in Phase 1 studies and in Phase 2 studies (either 
complete or ongoing) in subjects with Essential Tremor,  Parkinson’s Disease , Postpartum 
Depression and Major Depressive Disorder. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD)  was 30 mg 
SAGE -217 Oral Solution in the Phase 1 multiple -ascending dose study and is the target 
therapeutic dose i n clinical development  with the capsule formulation . Based on a Phase  1 
relative bioavailability  study of SAGE -217 Oral Solution and Capsules, exposures with 
SAGE -217 Capsules were lower than or equal to exposures observed at the same dose with 
SAGE -217 Or al Solution.  
SAGE -217 has been generally well tolerated to date, based on available data from the Phase  1 
and 2 studies. The most common treatment -emergent adverse events were sedation, somnolence, 
and dizziness. Most adverse events were reported as mild or moderate in intensity  and resolved 
by the end of the study . A single suspected, unexpected, serious, adverse reaction (SUSAR)  has 
been reported to date: an event of transient confusion leading to discontinuation of study drug in 
a subject with essential  tremor who received the SAGE -217 Oral Solution.  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure  for detailed background information on SAGE -217. 
5.3. Potential Benefits  and Risks  
Protocol 217 -PPD-201 is the first clinical study of SAGE -217 evaluating the efficacy, safety , and 
pharmacokinetics in subjects with PPD . Thus, the potential benefits in this population are 
unknown, although the risks are likely to be similar to those noted  in the Investigator’s Brochure . 
Known risks of severe PPD include maternal suicide, infanti cide, decreased maternal bonding 
with the infant, resulting in poor attachment ( Lindahl 2005 ; McLearn 2006 ; Austin 2007 ; 
Meltzer -Brody 2014 ). It has also been demonstrated that effects of PPD extend to the paternal 
mood and , as a result , negatively impact the functioning of the entire family ( Paulson 2010 ).  
In order to mitigate risks associated with this study, dose adjustments based on tolerability are 
allowed in the protocol .  
In the 217 -CLP-103 study, SAGE -217 was found to be generally well -tolerated wi th no serious 
adverse events ( AEs) reported during the treatment and follow -up periods . The most frequent AE 
Protocol 217 -PPD-201 Sage Therapeutics  
Amendment # 8, Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 24  
    observed was sedation that was mild, transient, and occurred within 1 to 4 hours and generally 
dissipated by 8 hours .  
In conclusion, the known saf ety profile , coupled with exclusion of high -risk patients with 
attempted suicide associated with the current episode of depression, are expected to place this 
protocol at a favorable benefit to risk ratio .  
5.4. Dose Justification  
5.4.1.  Safety Measures  
SAGE -217 has b een generally well tolerated to date  (see Section  5.2). 
Dose reductions are permitted during the study . During the treatment period, subjects will 
receive study drug as long as there are no dose -limiting safety/t olerability concerns . Dose 
adjustments should be made according to the process outlined in Section  9.3. 
In addition, as SAGE -217 is a central nervous system -active compound, the Columbia Suicide 
Severity Rating S cale (C -SSRS) will be used to monitor emergence or regression of suicidal 
ideation as means of detecting adverse effects on mood .  
5.4.2.  Safety Instructions  
The study  will be conducted on an outpatient basis . All doses will be self -administered by the 
subject at  home . Adverse events will be collected throughout the subject’s participat ion. If safety 
concerns arise, the Investigator may hospitalize the subject s as clinically indicated.  
Instructions to the subject must include warnings about avoiding activities for  which sedative 
effects of the study drug may impair performance, such as interactions with the infant, driving a 
motor vehicle, and operating machinery .

    treatment  allocation. Randomization will be performed central ly via an interactive response 
technology (IRT) system .  
Randomization schedule s will be generated by an independent statistician. The allocation to 
treatment group (SAGE -217 or placebo) will be based on the randomization schedule. The 
randomization schedules will be kept strictly confidential, accessible only to authorized 
personnel until the time of unblinding.  
In the event of a medical emergency, the pharmacist  and/or designated pharmacy staff  may 
revea l actual study drug contents to the Investigator, who should also alert Sage of the 
emergency (see Section  13.6 for more details related to unblinding) . In all cases where the study 
drug allocation for a subject is unblinded, pertinent information (including the reason for 
unblinding) must be documented in the subject’s records and on the electronic case report form 
(eCRF) . If the subject or study center personnel (other than pharmacist  and/or designated 
pharmacy staff) have been unblinded, the subject will be terminated from the study .

    9. TREATMENT OF SUBJECT S 
9.1. Number of Subjects  
Approximately  140 subjects with severe PPD will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio for approximately  
70 subjects per treatment  group . Additional subjects may be enrolled in order to ensure there are 
130 evaluable subjects . Evaluable subjects are defined as those randomized subjects receiving 
study drug with valid baseline and at least 1 post-baseline HAM -D assessment.  
9.2. Treatment Assignment  
This is a double -blind study . Eligible s ubjects will be randomly ass igned to receive  SAGE -217 
or matched placebo on a 1:1 basis . Subjects , clinicians , and study team will be bl inded to 
treatment allocation .  
Dose adjustments will only be allowed as described in  Section  9.3.  
9.3. Dose  Adjustment Criteria  
During the Treatment Period, subjects will be able to receive study drug as long as there are no 
dose-limiting sa fety/tolerability concerns . Subjects who cannot tolerate 30 mg QD will receive 
20 mg QD for the remain der of the Treatment  Period. Subjects who experience intolerable AEs 
at the 20  mg QD dose level may be discontinued from study treatment at the discretion of the 
Investigator .  
Dose adjustments will be made based on tolerability as assessed by occurrence of a severe AE or 
a moderate AE of special interest (sedation, somnolence, dizziness, euphoric mood, confusion, 
drowsiness, inebriation (feeling drunk), or fatigue) judged by the investigator to be related to 
study drug. If a dose adjustment is deemed necessary by the Investig ator at any time during the 
treatment period, the subject will return to the site to return any remaining current dose and for 
the adjusted dose to be dispensed.  
9.4. Prior/Concomitant Medications and Restrictions  
9.4.1.  Prior/Concomitant Medications  
In this study, ps ychotropic medications refer to central nervous system active medications taken 
to help depressive symptoms, and include antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and hypnotic agents . 
Subjects presenting to the study on psychotropic me dications  may be eligible to participate if the 
same  dose of the medications ha s been taken  at least 30 da ys prior to Day 1 ; these subject s must 
remain at their same  dose until completion of the Day 15 assessments . Those subjects on 
benzodiazepines and hypnotic agents may be considere d for eligibility based on specific 
discussions between the Investigator and Sage to ensure safety . Subjects on other psychotropic 
medications, including stimulants, antipsychotics  (if used for the purpose of treating psychotic 
symptoms) , and mood stabiliz ers, are not eligible to participate in this study . Atypical 
antipsychotic use may be approved if it has been prescribed to augment the effects of 
antidepressants.  
Any concomitant medication determined necessary for the welfare of the subject may  be given at 
the discretion of the Investigator at any time during the study under the guidance outlined in

    Section  9.4.2 . All medications taken from 3 months prior to informed consent  through  the 
Day 45 visit should be recorded on the eCRF . Prior medications  (ie, those taken prior to signing 
of ICF) that required washout for study entry will also be documented .  
9.4.2.  Restricted  Medications  
Restrictions on specific classes of medications include the following:  
• Initiation of new antidepressant therapy is prohibited upon admission to the study 
center for those eligible subjects who desire study participation . Those subjects 
already taking an antidepressant at the time of study entry (and meeting all study 
inclusion criteria) will b e permitted to remain on the pre-existing antidepressant at 
their current dose if they were taking this dose at least 30 days prior to Day 1 .  
• Benzodiazepines are to be avoided as much as possible . Eligible subjects taking a 
stable dose of benzodiazepine at least 30 days prior to Day 1  will be discussed on a 
case-by-case basis with Sage to determine eligibility . Subjects may be permitted to 
continue to take their current dose of the benzodiazepine (to prevent acute 
withdrawal), but no new benzodiazepine use  will be permitted during the course of 
the study .  
• The use of hypnotics for sleep/insomnia such as Ambien® and trazodone is to be 
avoided ; use of hypnotic s will be discussed on a case -by-case basis with Sage .  
• Anticonvulsants are prohibited . Atypical anti psychotics are allowed only if the 
indication has been for the treatment of the depressive episode and not for treatment 
of psychotic symptoms.  
• Use of any known strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 within 14 days or 
5 half -lives (whichever is long er) prior to receiving the first dose of study drug and 
throughout the study.  
• Use of any CYP inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, ritonavir, enzalutamide, 
efavirenz, nevirapine, phenytoin, phenobarbital or St John’s Wort, within 14 days or 
5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study drug and throughout

    11. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY 
For all efficacy assessments, the baseline v alues will be calculated as the last recorded value 
prior to the start of randomized study drug administration . Change from baseline values will be 
calculated as the assessment score minus the baseline value . Change from baseline values will be 
calculated for each item and total score .  
Subject -rated and clinician -rated scales are to be completed according to the Schedule of Events 
(Table  2). 
11.1. Primary Efficacy Outcome Measure  - Hamilton Rating Scale for 
Depression ( HAM-D) 
The primary outcome measure will be the change from baseline in 17 -item HAM -D total score at 
the end of the Treatment Period (Day 15).  
The 17 -item HAM -D will be used to rate the severity of depression in subjects who are already 
diagnosed as depresse d (Hamilton 1960 ). The 17 -item HAM -D comprises  individual ratings 
related to the following symptoms: depressed mood (sadness, hopeless, helpless, worthless), 
feelings of guilt, suicide, insomnia (early, middle, late), work and activities, retardation 
(slow ness of thought and speech; impaired ability to concentrate; decreased motor activity), 
agitation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and general), 
genital symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of weight, and insight . The HAM -D assessments are to 
be completed at the scheduled clinic visits 12 hours ±1 hour following the evening dose . Every 
effort should be made for the same rater to perform all HAM -D assessments for a n individual 
subject .  
The HAM -D total score will be calculated as  the sum of the 17 individual item scores .  
In addition to the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in HAM -D total score, 
several secondary efficacy endpoints will be derived for the HAM -D. Hamilton Rating Scale for 
Depression subscale scores will be calculated as the sum of the items comprising each subscale . 
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression response will be defined as having a 50% or greater 
reduction from baseline in HAM -D total score . Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression remission 
will be defined as having a HAM -D total score of  ≤7.  
11.2. Secondary  Efficacy Outcome Measure s 
Secondary efficacy assessments include evaluation of depressive and anxiety symptom severity 
by the MADRS ( Section  11.2.1 ), CGI ( Section  11.2.2  ), and HAM -A (Section  11.2.3 ).  
11.2.1.  Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)  
The MADRS is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire that psychiatrists use to measure the severity 
of depressive ep isodes in subject s with mood disorders . It was designed as an adjunct to the 
HAM -D that would be more sensitive to the changes brought on by antidepressants and other 
forms of treatment than the Hamilton Scale .  
Higher MADRS scores indicate more severe dep ression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6 . 
The overall score ranges from 0 to 60 ( McDowell 2006 ; Müller -Thomsen 2005 ).

    13. ASSESSMENT  OF SAFETY  
The study will be conducted on an outpatient basis . Subjects will be instructed to self -administer 
the study drug with food each evening . Adverse events will be collected throughout the subject’s 
participat ion. If safety concerns arise, the Inve stigator may hospitalize the patients as clinically 
indicated . Instructions to the subject must include warnings about avoiding activities for which 
sedative effects of the study drug may impair performance, such as interactions with the infant, 
driving a motor vehicle, and operating machinery.  
If daily monitoring calls reveal AEs, the PI will be notified and the subjects may be brought in 
for evaluation at the PI’s discretion . During these visits, if the PI determines that dose adjustment 
is needed, subjec ts will be dispensed the lower dose (20  mg) for the remaining dosing period.  
13.1. Safety and Tolerability Parameters  
Safety and tolerability of study drug will be evaluated by vital signs  measurement s, clinical 
laboratory measures, physical examination, ECGs, c oncomitant medication usage, C -SSRS, and 
adverse event reporting . All safety and tolerability parameters will be assessed according to the 
Schedule of Events  (Table  2). 
13.1.1.  Demographic/Medical History  
Age, race, and eth nic origin will be recorded at the Screening visit . The diagnosis of depression  
will be determined using the SCID -I. A full medical and family history, including recording of 
depression and anxiety diagnoses and all  major depression episodes (and for the s ubject, 
depression and anxiety treatment history [medication, hospitalization]), other Axis I and Axis II 
disorders, and postpartum depression episodes in immediate female family members  (siblings, 
parents, and grandparents) , will be recorded at the Screen ing visit . Subjects will be specifically 
asked about the depression or anxiety diagnoses  listed  in Appendix  1 and use of antidepressants 
listed in Appendi x 2. 
13.1.2.  Vital Sig ns 
Vital signs include  respiratory rate , oral temperature , and supine (for at least 5 minutes prior to 
the measurement) and standing systolic and diastoli c blood pressure and heart rate . Vital signs 
may be repeated at the discretion of the Investigator as clinically indicated .  
13.1.3.  Weight and Height  
Body weight and height will be measured at the Screening  visit; weight will also be measured on 
Days 15 and 21 .  
13.1.4.  Physical Examination  
A physical examination of all major body systems will be undertaken and recorded .  
13.1.5.  Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
A 12 -lead ECG will be assessed ; the standard intervals as well as any abnormalities  will be 
recorded .  
Protocol 217 -PPD-201 Sage Therapeutics  
Amendment # 8, Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 42  
    13.1.6.  Laboratory Assessments  
Blood and urine samples will be collected for hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, select 
hormone p arameters, and urinalysis . Where consent is given, an optional blood sample for 
hormone and exploratory biochemistry testing and optional genetic sample for biomarker testing 
will be collected at the Screening visit , Day 8 and Day 15 .  
Serum and urine samp les for pregnancy tests will also be collected . These assessments should be 
performed as outlined below .  
All samples will be analyzed at the central laboratory . Subjects may be considered eligible for 
the study based on local laboratory results; however, screening samples must also be sent to the 
central laboratory . Both local and central screening labs must adhere to the visit window 
provided in the Schedule of Events .  
All clinical laboratory test results outside the reference range will be interpreted b y the 
Investigator as abnormal, not clinically significant (NCS) or abnormal, clinically significant 
(CS) . Screening results considered abnormal, CS recorded at the Screening visit may make the 
subject ineligible for the study pending review by the Medical  Monitor . Clinical laboratory 
results that are abnormal, CS during the study but within normal range at baseline and/or indicate 
a worsening from baseline will be considered adverse events, assessed according to 
Section  13.2.1 , and recorded in the eCRF .  
13.1.6.1.  Hematology  
Hematology tests will include complete blood count , including red blood cells, white blood cells 
with differentiation, hemoglobin, hematocrit, reticulocytes, and platelets . The coagulation panel 
will in clude activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and international 
normalized ratio .  
13.1.6.2.  Blood Chemistry  
Serum chemistry tests will include serum electrolytes ; glucose; renal function tests , including 
creatinine, blood urea nitrogen , bicarbonate  or total carbon dioxide ; liver function tests , 
including alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase , and alanine 
aminotransferase ; total protein ; albumin ; and thyroid stimulating hormone .  
13.1.6.3.  Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will include assessme nt of protein, hemoglobin , glucose, ketones, bilirubin, 
urobilinogen, leukocyte esterase, nitrites, color, turbidity, pH, and specific gravity .  
13.1.6.4.  Virus Serology  
Subjects will be screened for hepatitis (HBsAg and anti -HCV) and HIV prior to being enrolled in 
the study . If subjects are positive for anti -HCV, reflex RNA testing (viral load) for HCV  should 
be conducted; t hose subjects with positive anti -HCV may be enrolled only if the viral load is 
negative.

Amendment # 8, Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 43  
    13.1.6.5.  Hormones and Exploratory Biochemistry  
Optional b lood sa mples will be collected and may be analyzed for stress hormone levels, 
kynurenine biochemistry, and markers of inflammation . Future research may suggest other 
biochemical pathways as candidates for influe ncing not only response to SAGE -217 but also 
suscept ibility to disorders for which SAGE -217 may be evaluated . Thus, the exploratory 
biochemistry may involve study of additional unnamed molecular pathways, but only as related 
to disease susceptibility and drug action .  
13.1.6.6.  Pregnancy Test 
Women of childbearing po tential will be tested for pregnancy by serum pregnancy test at the 
Screening visit and by urine pregnancy test on Day 1 ( predose ), and at the follow -up visit . A 
urine pregnancy test will also be performed as part of the early termination assessments for 
subjects who discontinue the study early . If a subject becomes pregnant during the study, the 
process for reporting the pregnancy and guidance for collection of information related to the 
pregnancy is outlined in the Safety Management Plan .  
13.1.6.7.  Genetic Testing  
Where consent is given , an optional genetic sample for biomarker testing will be collected at the 
Screening visit .  
The objective of this research is to collect and store blood samples for possible DNA extraction 
and exploratory research into how genes or  specific genetic variation may influence response (ie, 
distribution, safety, tolerability, and efficacy) to SAGE -217. Specific genetic variations of 
interest include but are not limited to: classes of metabolizing enzymes (eg, cytochrome P450 
supra -family  genes), genes encoding enzymes involved in the production and metabolism of 
SAGE -217 (eg, AKR1C4 [3 α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]), genes associated with the GABA 
receptor (eg, GABRA1 -A6, GABRB1 -B3, GABRD, GABRE, GABRG1 -3), and genes 
associated with the production and degradation of GABA .  
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as c andidates for influencing not 
only response to SAGE -217 but also susceptibility to disorders for which SAGE -217 may be 
evaluated . Thus, the genetic research may involve study of additional unnamed genes or gene 
categories, but only as related to disease su sceptibility and drug action .  
13.1.6.8.  Drugs of Abuse and Alcohol  
A urine sample  for assessment of selected drugs of abuse (including amphetamines, barbiturates, 
benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, opiates, and phencyclidine)  and a serum (screening) or 
breath sample (predose on Day 1) for alcohol screen  will be collected . Use of benzodiazepines at 
screening is not necessarily exclusionary , as subjects will be allowed to take psychotropics at a 
stable dose that have been initiated within  30 days prior  to informe d consent  (see Section  9.4).  
13.1.7.  Columbi a-Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ) 
Suicidality will be monitored during the study using the C -SSRS ( Posner 2011 ). This scale 
consists of a baseline evaluation that asses ses the lifetime experience of the subject with suicidal 
ideation and behavior, and a post -baseline evaluation that focuses on suicidality since the last 
Protocol 217 -PPD-201 Sage Therapeutics  
Amendment # 8, Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 44  
    study visit . The C -SSRS includes ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses for assessment of suicidal ideation and 
behav ior as well as numeric ratings for severity of ideation, if present (from 1 to 5, with 5 being 
the most severe) .  
The “Baseline/Screening” C -SSRS form will be completed at screening  (lifetime history and past 
24 months) . The “Since Last Visit” C -SSRS form will be completed at all subsequent time  
points, as outlined in  Table  2.  
13.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
13.2.1.  Definition of Adverse Events  
13.2.1.1.  Adverse Event  
An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical c ondition or the deterioration of 
a pre -existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, 
whether or not considered causally  related to the product . In clinical studies, an adverse event 
can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including baseline or 
washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.  
13.2.1.2.  Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug  caused the adverse event . For the purposes of Investigational New Drug safety 
reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the adverse event . Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of 
certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug .  
13.2.1.3.  Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring during any study phase  and at any dose of 
the investigational product, c omparator or placebo, that fulfil ls 1 or more of the following:  
• It results in death  
• It is immediately life -threatening  
• It requires inpatient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• It results in persistent or significant disability or i ncapacity  
• It results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
• It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject  or may require 
medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above.  
All serious adverse event s that occur after any  subject has been enrolled, whether or not they are 
related to the study, must be recorded for the duration of the study  on the SAE form provided by 
Sage Therapeutics or designee .  
Protocol 217 -PPD-201 Sage Therapeutics  
Amendment # 8, Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 45  
    13.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
An Investigator  who is qualified in medicine mus t make the determination of relationship to the 
investigational product for each adverse event (not related , possibly related or probably related) . 
The Investigator  should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable 
possibility th at the event may have been caused by the investigational product . If no valid reason 
exists for suggesting a relationship, then the adverse event should be classified as “ not related.”  
If there is any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a po ssible cause -and-effect 
relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the adverse event , then the 
adverse event should be considered “related.”   
Not Related:  No relationship between  the experience  and the administration of study  drug; related to other  
etiologies  such as concomitant medications or subject’s clinical state.  
Possibly 
Related:  A reaction that follows a  plausible temporal sequence from  administration of the study  drug and 
follows a  known response pattern to the suspecte d study  drug.  
The reaction might have  been produced by the subject’s clinical state or other modes of therapy  
administered to the subject, but  this is not known for sure.  
Probably 
Related:  A reaction that follows a  plausible temporal sequence from  admini stration of the study  drug and 
follows a  known response pattern to the suspected study  drug.  
The reaction cannot be  reasonably  explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical 
state or  other modes of therapy  administered to the subject.  
If the relationship between the adverse event /serious adverse event  and the investigational 
product is determined to be “possible” or “probable” , the event will be considered to be related 
to the investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulat ory reporting .  
13.4. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by the subject and/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at the 
investigational site . Clinical ly significant changes in laboratory values, blood pressure, and pulse 
need not be reported as adverse event s unless they prompt corrective medical action by the 
Investigator, constitute a  serious adverse event , or lead to discontinuation of administration  of 
study drug .  
Information about adverse events will be collected from the signing of the ICF until the final 
visit of the study for that subject . Adverse events that occur after the first administration of study 
drug will be denoted  as treatment -emergen t adverse events  (TEAE s).  
All adverse events  regardless of Investigator -determined causality, should  be followed until the 
event is resolved or  the Investigator determines the event is stable or no longer clinically 
significant .  
The adverse event term sh ould be reported in standard medical terminology when possible . For 
each adverse event , the Investigator  will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), resolution 
or clinical plateau (date and time), severity , causality, action taken, outcome, and whe ther or not 
it caused the subject  to discontinue the study .  
Severity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)  
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
Protocol 217 -PPD-201 Sage Therapeutics  
Amendment # 8, Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 46  
    • Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
13.5. Reporting Adverse Events  
All serious adverse events (regardless of causality) will be recorded from the signing of the ICF 
until the Day 45 Follow -up visit . Any serious adverse events co nsidered possibly or probably 
related to the investigational product and discovered by the Investigator at any time after the 
study should be reported . All serious adverse events must be reported to Sage or Sage ’s designee 
immediately in writing within 24  hours of the first awareness of the event . The Investigator must 
complete, sign and date the serious adverse event form , verify the accuracy of the information 
recorded on the serious adverse event form  with the corresponding source documents, and send a 
copy to Sage Therapeutics or designee .  
Additional follow -up information, if required or available, should be sent to Sage Therapeutics 
or designee within 24 hours of receipt ; a follow -up serious adverse event  form should be 
completed and placed with the or iginal serious adverse event  information and kept with the 
appropriate section of the eCRF and/or study file .  
Sage Therapeutics or designee is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of 
certain events . It is the Principal Investigato r’s responsibility to notify the IRB of all serious 
adverse event s that occur at his or her site  if applicable per the IRB’s requirements . Investigator s 
will also be notified of all unexpected, serious, drug -related events (7 -/15-Day Safety Reports) 
that o ccur during the clinical study . Each site is responsible for notifying its IRB of these 
additional serious adverse event s.  
13.6. Emergency Identification of Study Drug  
During the study, the blind is to be broken only when the safety of a subject is at risk and the 
treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment received . Unless a subject is at immediate 
risk, the Investigator must make diligent attempts to contact Sage prior to unblinding the study 
treatment administered to a subject . Any request from the Inv estigator about the treatment 
administered to study subjects must be discussed with Sage . If the unblinding occurs without 
Sage ’s knowledge, the Investigator must notify Sage  as soon as possible and no later than the 
next business morning . All circumstance s surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly 
documented in the source records . Unless a subject is at immediate risk, any request for the 
unblinding of individual subjects must be made in writing to Sage  and approved by the 
appropriate Sage  personn el, according to standard operating procedures . The blinding of the 
study will be broken after the database has been locked . Electronic copies of the randomization 
code will be made available to the laboratory performing the bioanalytical analyses in order  to 
allow for limited analysis of samples from subjects receiving placebo .  
In the event of a medical emergency or pregnancy, the Investigator will discuss with the Medical 
Monitor if unblinding is warranted for medical management of the subject. If there is agreement 
to unblind treatment assignment, the unblinding procedure described in the Safety Management 
Plan for the study will be followed. If the Investigator is unable to contact the Medical Monitor 
in a medical emergency, and it is deemed clinically necessary by the Investigator, the treatment 
group for that subject may be unblinded in the interactive response technology system.  
Protocol 217 -PPD-201 Sage Therapeutics  
Amendment # 8, Version 9.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 47  
    In all cases where the study drug allocation for a subject is unblinded, pertinent information must 
be documented in the sub ject’s records and on the eCRF . If the subject or study center personnel 
(other than unblinded personnel designated to dispense  the study drug ) have been unblinded, the 
subject will be permanently discontinued from the study .

    fixed effects . All post -baseline time points will be included in the model . The primary 
comparison will be between SAGE -217 Capsule and placebo at the 1 5-day time point . Model -
based point estimates (ie, least squares [LS] means), 95% confidence intervals, and p -values) 
will be reported where applicable . An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model 
the within -subject errors . Compound symmetry covariance struc ture will be used if there is a 
convergence issue with the unstructured covariance model .  
14.6. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
14.6.1.  Efficacy Analyses  
Similar to those methods described for the primary endpoint in Section  14.5, MMRM will be 
used for the analysis of the following variables:  changes from baseline in MADRS total score, 
HAM -A total score, , and select individual item and subscale 
scores . For each model, the c omparison o f interest  will be between SAGE -217 capsule and 
placebo at the 15-day time point . Model -based point estimates (ie,  LS means), 95% confidence 
intervals, and p -values will be reported .  
Generalized estimating equation (GEE)  methods will be used for the analysis of the  following 
binary variables: HAM -D response (define as ≥50% reduction from baseline in HAM -D total 
score), HAM -D remission (defined as ≤7.0 HAM -D total score), and CGI -I response . 
Generalized estimating equation  models will include terms for center, treatm ent, baseline score , 
assessment time point, and time point -by-treatment as explanatory variables . The comparison of 
interest will be the difference between SAGE -217 Capsules and placebo at the 1 5-day time point . 
Model -based point estimates (ie, odds ratios ), 95% confidence intervals, and p -values will be 
reported . For the CGI -I response analysis, baseline CGI -S score will be included in the model .  
Descriptive statistics for all scores, change from baseline values, and response variables will be 
presented b y treatment and assessment time point . Summaries will include n, mean, SD, median, 
minimum, and maximum .  
14.6.2.  Safety Analyses  
Safety and tolerability of SAGE -217 will be evaluated by adverse events , concomitant 
medication usage , changes from baseline in vital signs, clinical laboratory evaluations , and 12 -
lead ECG . Suicidality will be monitored by the C -SSRS . Safety data will be listed by subject and 
summarized by treat ment group . All safety summaries will be performed on the Safety Set.  
14.6.2.1.  Adverse E vents  
The ana lysis of adverse events will be based on the concept of TEAEs . A TEAE is defined as an 
adverse event with onset after the start of study drug , or any worsening of a pre -existing medical 
condition/ adverse event with onset after the start of study drug and u ntil 7 days after the last 
dose. The incidence of TEAEs will be summarized  overall and by Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) Version 1 9.1 or higher System Organ Class (SOC) and 
preferred term . Incidences will be presented in order of dec reasing frequency  for the SAGE -217 
treatment group . In addition, summaries will be provided by severity (mild, moderate, severe) 
and by causality (related, not related) to study drug (see Section  13.3).

    Treatmen t-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation and serious adverse events (see 
Section  13.2.1.3  for definition) with onset after the start of randomized study drug will also be 
summarized .  
All adverse even ts and serious adverse events (including those with onset or worsening before 
the start of randomized study drug ) through the Day 45 Follow -up visit  will be listed.  
14.6.2.2.  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Clinical laboratory results will be listed by subject  and t iming of collection . Mean changes from 
baseline in clinical laboratory measures  will be summarized .  
14.6.2.3.  Physical Examinations  
Any clinically significant change in physical examination compared to those observed at 
screening should be noted as an adverse event .  
14.6.2.4.  Vital Signs  
Vital sign results will be listed by subject and timing of collection . Mean changes from 
randomization in vital signs will be summarized by time point .  
14.6.2.5.  12-Lead E lectrocardiogram  
The following ECG parameters will be listed for each subject : heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, QTc , 
and QT interval calculated using the Fridericia method (QTcF ). Any clinically significant 
abnormalities or changes in ECGs should be listed as an adverse event . Electrocardiogram 
findings will be listed by subject and visit .  
14.6.2.6.  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications will be recorded at each study visit during the study and will be coded using World 
Health Organization -Drug dictionary (WHO -DD) September 201 6, or later .  
Medications will be presented according to whether the y are being taken prior to and/or during 
the study (concomitant) . Prior medications are defined as those taken prior to the first dose of 
study drug . Concomitant medications are defined as those with a start date on or after the first 
dose of study drug, o r those with a start date before the first dose of study drug that are ongoing 
or with a stop date on or after the first dose of study drug . If medication dates are incomplete and 
it is not clear whether the medication was concomitant, it will be assumed t o be concomitant .  
Details of prior and concomitant medications will be listed by subject, start date, and verbatim 
term.  
14.6.2.7.  Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
Suicidality data collected on the C -SSRS at baseline and by visit during the Treatment P eriod

    15. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOU RCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
15.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a subject  into the study, a representative of Sage 
Thera peutics or designee will visit the investigational study site to:   
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities ; and  
• Discuss with the Investigator (s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard 
to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Sage  Therapeutics or designee or its 
representatives . This will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between 
Sage Therapeutics and the Investigator .  
During the study, a monitor from Sage Therapeutics or designee will have regular contacts with 
the inve stigational site for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the Investigator (s); 
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable ; 
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the eCRF s, and that investigational product accountability 
checks are being performed ; 
• Perform source data verification . This includes a comparison of the data in the eCRF s 
with the subject ’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records 
relevant to the study . This will require direct access to all original records for each 
subject (eg, clinic charts);  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Sage Therapeutics or 
designee ; and  
• Confirm adverse event s and serious adverse event s have been properly documented 
on eCRFs and confirm any serious adverse event s have been forwarded to Sage 
Therapeutics or designee and those serious adverse event s that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB .  
The monitor will be availabl e between visits if the Investigator (s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
15.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of Sage Therapeutics, a regulatory authority, an Independent Ethics 
Committee  (IEC) or an IRB may visit the site to perfor m audits or inspections, including source 
data verification . The purpose of a Sage Therapeutics or designee audit or inspection is to 
systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and documents to 
determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and 
accurately reported according to the protocol, GCP guidelines of the International Council  on 
Harmoni sation  of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) , and any 
applicable regulato ry requirements . The Investigator  should contact Sage Therapeutics

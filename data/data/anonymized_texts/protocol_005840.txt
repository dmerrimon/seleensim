Revised 
Protocol 0106-Dec-2013 Incorporates Amendment(s) 02 and Administrative Letter 01
Amendment 02 06- Dec-2013 The main objective of this amendment is to imp lement a mandatory 
recommendation received from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) as follows:
The exclusion criterion has been added to exclude the subjects 
who received chest radiation 24 weeks prior to first dose of 
the study drug.
Justificat ion for this exclusion criterion is that pneumonitis has been 
noted in the current Investigator Brochure as a treatment -related serious 
adverse event (SAE). The FDA notes that “Radiation pneumonitis can 
occur in patients who have received chest radiation up to 24 weeks after 
radiation therapy.” Chest radiation is not commonly used in the subjects 
eligible for this protocol, and this amendment will comply with the FDA 
recommendation without altering the basic study population or trial 
design.
Additional upd ates were also made to the protocol including items such 
as clarifying the schedule of tumor assessment, correcting typographical 
and formatting errors,

SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol CA209140
Protocol Title: A Single -Arm, Open -Label Phase 2 Study of Nivolumab (BMS -936558) in Subjects with Relapsed 
or Refractory Follicular Lymphoma (FL)
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Adm inistration, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s): Nivolumab (BMS -936558) administered IV over 60 minutes at 3mg/kg every 2weeks until 
progression or unacceptable toxicity
Study Phase: 2b
Research Hypothesis: Treatment with nivolumab will lead to clinical benefit, as demonstrated by an improved 
clinically meaningful objective response rate, including durable responses with substantial magnitude of tumor 
reduction in subjects with refractory FL who have failed therapy with both rituximab and an alkylating agent.
Prim ary Objective: To assess the clinical benefit of nivolumab, as measured by independent radiologic review 
committee (IRRC) assessed objective response rate (ORR) in subjects with FL who have failed therapy with both 
rituximab and an alkylating agent.
Secondary Objectives:
To assess the duration of response (DOR) based on IRRC assessments
To assess the complete r emission rate (CRR) and the duration of CR based on IRRC assessment
To assess the PR rate and the duration of PR based on IRRC assessment
To assess the progression free survival (PFS) based on IRRC assessment
To assess the ORR, based on investigator assess ments.

BMS -936558 nivolumab
Study Design: This is a single arm phase 2 study in subjects 18 years old with relapsed or refractory follicular 
lymphoma after failure of at least two prior lines of therapy. Approximately 90 subjects will be treated with 
nivolumab 3mg/kg IV every 2 weeks. Subjects will undergo screening evaluations to determ ine eligibility within 
28days prior to first dose. Each 14 -day dosing period w ill constitute a cycle. Tumor assessments will begin 8 weeks 
after the start of therapy and follow  the schedule shown in Table 5.4.1 -1. An independent radiology revie w 
committee (IRRC) will also be utilized. The prim ary endpoint of this study is IRRC -assessed ORR, using 
2007 International Working Group (IWG) Resp onse Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma. Secondary endpoints 
include IRRC -assessed DOR, as well as CRR, duration of CR, PR rate, duration of PR, and PFS as determined by 
IRRC and ORR based on investigator assessment. Collect ion of fresh tumor tissue (FFPE tumor tissue block or 
10unstained slides from a biopsy  perform ed during the screening phase or collected as a standard of care procedure 
within 90 days prior to obtaining informed consent for determ ination of PD-L1 expression status) is mandatory. 
Archival t issue should be submitted for all subjects if available.

It is anticipated that accrual will last 18 months, with approximately 115 subjects enrolled.
Study Population: Male and female, ages 18 and above, with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphom a after 
failure of at least two prior lines of therapies (each containing CD20 antibody and/or an alkylating agent ) will be 
eligible to participate in the study. Other key inclusion criteria include ECOG PS 0 -1, at least one measurable lesion 
15mm (1.5 cm) in the longest diameter. (See protocol Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 for full list of criteria.)
Study Assessments: The primary endpoint is ORR as determ ined by an IRRC according to the 2007 IWG criteria. 
Subjects will be assessed for response by imaging (spiral CT/MRI) beginning at Week 8 and follow the schedule 
shown in Table 5.4.1 -1. A PET scan is required to confirm CR.
Subjects that discontinue study treatment to receive an allogeneic SCT or ASCT will have tumor assessment and 
GVHD evaluat ions performed as described in Sections 5.3 and 5.4.
Statistical Considerations:
Sample Size: The planned sample size for this study will be approximately 90 treated subjects.
The sample size was determined based on two considerations: the ability to produce a CI which would exclude an 
ORR of 20%, which is not considered clinically relevant and provide sufficient inform ation for a reliable 
understanding of the safety profile.
Assuming the true ORR is 35%, the study has approximately 87% power to reject the null hypoth esis that the true 
ORR is ≤20%, considering a 2 -sided alpha of 5%. In addition, Table xx summarizes the 95% exact CI for the target 
ORRs ranging from 30% to 44% with sample size of 90. At observed ORR ≥30%, the lower bound of the 95% CI 
excludes 20%.

Endpoints: The primary endpoint is IRRC -assessed ORR. The secondary endpoints are duration of ORR 
(DOR) based on IRRC assessments, IRRC -assessed complete remission rate and duration of CR, IRRC -assessed PR 
rate and duration of PR, IRRC -assessed progression f ree survival (PFS), and investigator -assessed ORR.
Analyses: The IRRC -assessed ORR will be summarized by binomial response rates and their 
corresponding two-sided 95% exact CIs using the Clopper- Pearson method. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 
the 2-sided 95% CI low er bound is greater than 20%.
The IRRC -assessed DOR will be summarized for subjects who achieve PR or CR using the Kaplan -Meier (KM) 
product -limit method. Median values of DOR, along with the two-sided 95% CIs using a method based on the log-
log transformation, will also be calculated.
IRRC -assessed CR and PR rates and investigator -assessed ORR will be summarized similarly to the prim ary 
endpoint. Duration of CR and PR will be summarized similarly to DOR. IRRC -assessed PFS will be summariz ed 
descriptively using the Kaplan -Meier (KM) product -limit method. Median values of PFS, along with the two-sided 
95% CIs using a method based on the log -log transformation, will also be calculated.

BMS will provide the investigator with an appropriate (ie, Global or Local) sample informed 
consent form which will include all elements required by ICH, GCP and applicable regulatory 
requirements. The sample infor med consent form will adhere to the ethical principles that have 
their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Investigators must:
1)Provide a copy  of the consent form and written information about the study  in the language 
in which the subject is most profic ient prior to clinical study  participation. The language 
must be non- technical and easily  understood. 
2) Allow time necessary  for subject or subject's legally  acceptable representative to inquire 
about the details of the study .
3)Obtain an informed consent signed and personally  dated by the subject or the subject's 
legally  acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the informed consent 
discussion. 
4)Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opinion of the written informed consent 
form and any other information to be provided to the subjects, prior to the beginning of the 
study , and after any  revisions are completed for new information.
5)If informed consent is initially  given by a subject’s legall y acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the subject subsequently  becomes capable of making and communicating his 
or her informed consent during the study , consent must additionally  be obtained from the 
subject.
6)Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is 
relevant to the subject's consent. The investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, 
should fully inform the subject or the subject's legall y acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, of all pertinent aspects of the study  and of any new information relevant to the 
subject's willingness to continue participation in the study . This communication should be 
documented. 
The confidentiality  of records that could identify  subjects must be protected, respecting the 
privacy  and confidentialit y rules applicable to regulatory  requirements, the subjects' signed ICF 
and, in the US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Authorization.
The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and regulatory  authorities have direct 
access to subject records. 
Subjects unable to give their written consent (eg, stroke or subjects with or severe dementia) may  
only be enrolled in the study  with the consent of a legally  acceptable representative. The subject 
must also be informed about the nature of the study  to the extent compatible with his or her 
understanding, and should this subject become capable, he or she should personall y sign and date 
the consent form as soon as possible. The explicit wish of a subject who is unable to give his or 
her written consent, but who is capable of forming an opinion and assessing information to 
refuse participation in, or to be withdrawn from, the clinical study  at any time should be 
considered b y the investigator.

3 INVESTIGA TIONA L PLA N
3.1 Study Design and Duration
This is a single -arm Phase 2 study  in subjects 18years old with relapsed FL after failure of at 
least two prior lines of therap y, (each containing rituximab and/or an alkylating agent). 
Approximately  90subjects will be treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks. 
Subjects will undergo screeni ng evaluations to determine eligibility  within 28days prior to first
dose. Each 14-day dosing period will constitute a cycle. Tumor assessments by spiral CT/MRI 
will begin 8 weeks after the start of therapy  and will continue every  8weeks through the first 
8months, every 12 weeks Months 9 - 24, and then every  6  m onths thereafter until disease 
progression. An IRRC will also be utilized. The primary  endpoint of this study  is IRRC -assessed 
objective response rate, using 2007 International Working Group (IWG) Response Criteria for 
Malignant Lym phoma criteria (Appendix 2). Secondary  endpoints include IRRC -assessed 
duration of objective response, as well as complete remission rate, duration of CR, PR rate, 
duration of PR and PFS as determined by IRRC assessment and ORR based on investigator 
assessment.

Screening :
Begins by establishing subject’s initial eligibility  and signing of the informed consent form 
(ICF)
Subject is enrolled using the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) to obtain a subject 
ID
Confirm that documentati on of relapsed or refractory  FL is present in the subject’s medical 
record;
Submission of tumor tissue (FFPE tumor tissue block or 10 unstained slides) from a 
biopsy  performed within 90 days prior to obtaining informed consent is mandatory  for 
determinatio n of PD-L1 expression status. If tissue taken as part of a standard of care 
procedure within 90 days prior to obtaining informed consent is not available, then a 
biopsy  must be performed during the screening period and submitted accordingl y.
Biopsy  samples should be excisional, incisional or core needle.
Subjects may initiate the study  drug before the outcome of PD-L1 expression status 
become available.
NOTE: In rare cases where tumor tissue, obtained during screening or within 90 days prior to 
obtaining informed consent, cannot be provided, the reason must be clearly documented in the 
medical record AND the BMS Medical Monitor must be contacted. Archival tissue, if available, 
should be submitted for these subjects. Submission of archival tissue is also enco uraged for all 
subjects, irrespective of whether tumor biops y tissue is available as specified.
Confirm that a bone marrow biopsy /aspirate was performed within 90 day s prior to obtaining  
informed consent in the subject’s medical record;
If a bone marrow biopsy /aspirate was not performed within 90 days prior to obtaining 
informed consent , a bone marrow biops y/aspirate must be performed during the screening 
period.
If a bone marrow biopsy /aspirate needs to be performed during the screening period, 
submission of an aspirate sample for biomarker analyses is optional as per Table 5.1-1
Subjects can start the study  drug before bone marrow biops y results become available; 
results need to be documented in the subject’s medical record later
The Follicular Lym phoma International Prognostic Index (FLIP I) as determined at the time 
of initial disease diagnosis must be reported in the eCRF. (See Appendix 3 )
Baseline disease or tumor assessments should be performed within 28days of first dose of 
study  drug, according to Table 5.1-1
Subject is assessed for study  eligibility  within the required timeframe found in Table 5.1-1
The screening phase either ends with confirmation of full eligibility  and treatment of the 
subject or with the confirmation that the subject is a screen failure.

Treatment :
Treatment begins with the call to the IVRS to obtain vial assignments. A negative pregnancy  
test should be documented within 24 hours prior to the start of investigational product.
Subsequently , women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a pregnancy  test every 
4weeks (± 7 day s) regardless of dosing schedule.
The subject should receive the dose of stud y medication within 1 day of vial assignment.
Subjects may  be dosed no less than 12 day s between doses and no more than 3 days after the 
scheduled dosing date. Dose given after the 3-day window is considered a dose delay . 
Amaximum delay  of 42 day s between doses is allowed.
All of the vital signs starting after C ycle 1 will be collected within 72 hours prior to dosing. 
Adverse event assessments should be documented at each clinic visit. 
Biomarker, PK and immunogenicit y samples will be done according to the schedules in 
Sections 5.5, 5.6, and 5.8.1.
Study  drug is administered as an IV infusion over 60 minutes on Treatment Day 1 of each 
cycle until disease progression or discontinuation due to toxicity , withdrawal of study  
consent, or the study  ends. Treatment beyond progression is allowed in certain instances as 
described in Section 4.3.8
Study  drug dosing may  be delay ed for toxicity . See Section 4.3.2.
Subjects will be evaluated for response according to revised International Working Group 
Criteria beginning at Week 9 and continuing every  8  w eeks (1week) for the first eight 
months of treatment, then every  12 weeks (2weeks) up to 2 years of treatment, continuing 
every  6 months (3 weeks) beyond 2years of treatment, until disease progression is 
documented or until the subject initiates a preparative regimen for allogeneic SCT or ASCT, 
whichever occurs earlier. If the subject discontinues treatment prior to disease progression, 
tumor assessment will continue in the follow- up phase.
Screening/Baseline and all subsequent scans will be submitted to an IRRC, once the subject 
has been enrolled and throughout the stud y period.
Quality  of Life (QoL) tools must be completed at Treatment Day 1 prior to the first dose of 
study  drug. Following that, QoL tools will be completed according to the schedule in Table 
5.1-2 and Table 5.1 -3.
This phase ends when the subject is discontinued from study therapy . For a complete list of 
reasons for treatment discontinuation, refer to Sections 3.5and 4.3.5.
Follow -up:
Begins when the decision to discontinue a subject from study  therap y is made (no further 
treatment with study  therapy ).
Subjects will have two follow -up visits for safet y. Follow -up visit 1(X01), 35 day s (±7 day s) 
from the last dose of study  therap y and Follow -up visit 2 (X02), 80 days (±7days) from 
X01. After X02, subjects will be followed every  3 months for ongoing drug -related AEs until
resolved, return to baseline or deemed irreversible, or until lost to follow -up or withdrawal of 
study  consent.

Eligi bility  criteria for this study  have been carefully  considered to ensure the safet y of the study 
subjects and that the results of the study  can be used. It is imperative that subjects fully  meet all 
eligibility  criteria.
3.3.3 Women of Childbearing Potential
A Woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has experienced 
menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy  or bilateral 
oophorectom y) and is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in 
a woman over age 45years in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. 
Inaddition, women under the age of 55years must have a serum follicle stimulating hormone, 
(FSH) level > 40mIU/mL to confirm menopause.*
*Women treated with hormone replacement therapy , (HRT) are likely  to have artificiall y 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the investigators should use their 
judgment in checking serum FSH levels. If the serum FSH level is >40mIU/mL at any time 
during the washout period, the woman can be considered postmenopausal:
1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
4 week minimum for transdermal products
8 week minimum for oral products.
Other parenteral products may  require washout periods as long as 6 months.
3.4 Concomitant Treatments
3.4.1 Prohibited and/or Restricted Tr eatments
The following medications are prohibited during the study :
Immunosuppressive agents (except to treat a drug- related adverse event)
Systemic corticosteroids > 10 mg daily  prednisone equivalent (except as stated in 
Section 3.3.2 or to treat a drug -related adverse event). 
Any concurrent antineoplastic therapy  (ie, chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , immunotherapy , 
radiation therap y except for palliative radiation therap y, or standard or investigational agents 
for treatment of cancer).
Supportive care fo r disease -related s ymptoms may be offered to all subjects on the trial.
3.4.2 Other Restrictions and Precautions
3.4.2.1 Permitted Therapy
Subjects are permitted to use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Physiologic replacement doses of systemic 
corticosteroids are permitted, even if > 10 mg/day  prednisone equivalents. A brief course of

corticosteroids for prophy laxis (eg, contrast dye allergy ) or for treatment of non-autoimmune 
conditions (e g, delay ed-type hy persensitivity reaction caused by  contact allergen) is permitted.
Concomitant medications are recorded at baseline and throughout the treatment phase of the 
study  in the appropriate section of the case report form (CRF). All medications (prescriptions or 
over the counter medications) continued at the start of the study  or started during the study  and 
different from the study drug must be documented in the concomitant therapy  section of the 
CRF.
3.5 Discontinuation of Subjects from Treatment
Subjects MUST discontinue investigational product (and non-investigational product at the 
discretion of the investigator) for an y of the following reasons:
Disease progression as determined by investigator assessment following the guidelines 
given in Section 5.4except as outlined in Section 4.3.8 Treatment Beyond Disease 
Progression.
Subject’s request to stop study  treatment
Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory  abnormality  or intercurrent illness which, in 
the opinion of the investigator, indicates th at continued participation in the study  is not in 
the best interest of the subject
Termination of the stud y by Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS)
Loss of abilit y to freely  provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily 
incarceration for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious disease) 
illness
Additional protocol -specific reasons for discontinuation (See Section 4.3.5 ).
In the case of pregnancy , the investigator must immediately  notify  the BMS Medical 
Monitor/designee of this event. In most cases, the study  drug will be permanently  discontinued in 
an appropriate manner. If the investigator determines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio that 
warrants continuation of study  drug, a discussion between the investigator and the BMS Medical
Monitor/designee must occur.
All subjects who discontinue investigational product should compl y with protocol specified 
follow -up procedures as outlined in Section 5. The only exception to this requirement is when a 
subject withdraws consent for all study procedures including post-treatment study  follow -up or 
loses the ability  to consent freel y (ie,is imprisoned or involuntaril y incarcerated for the treatment 
of either a ps ychiatric or phy sical illness ).
If study  treatment is discontinued prior to the subject’s completion of the study , the reason for 
the discontinuation must be documented in the subject’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate CRF page.

3.6 Post Treatment Study Follow  up
In this study , ORR and DOR are key endpoints of the study . Post t reatment study  follow -up is of 
critical importance and is essential to preserving subject safet y and the integrit y of the study . 
Subjects who discontinue study  treatment must continue to be followed for collection of outcome 
and/or survival follow -up data as required and in line with Section 5until death or the conclusion 
of the study .
In addition, subjects who discontinue study  therapy  by proceeding to allogeneic SCT or ASCT 
will require tumor assessment (CR or non-CR) by the investigators according to the 2007 IWG 
criteria on Day 100, at 6 months, 1 year and every  year thereafter from the date of stem cell 
infusion until the first non-CR after SCT is documented (see Section 5.4). For the subjects who 
discontinue study  therapy  by proceeding to allogeneic SCT, documentation of acute and chronic 
GVHD will be simultaneously  collected (see Section 5.3).
3.6.1 Withdrawal of Consent
Subjects who request to discontinue study  treatment will remain in the study  and must continue 
to be followed for protocol specified follow-up procedures. The only exception to this is when a 
subject specifically  withdraws consent for any  further contact with him/her or persons previously 
authorized by subject to provide this information. Subjects should notify  the investigator of the 
decisi on to withdraw consent from future follow -up in writing , whenever possible. The 
withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by  the investigator, as 
to whether the withdrawal is from further treatment with study  drug only or also from study  
procedures and/or post treatment study  follow -up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In 
the event that vital status (whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly  
available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriatel y directed in 
accordance with local law.
3.6.2 Lost to Follow -Up
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing 
status. This includes follow -up with persons authorized by the subject asnoted above. Lost to 
follow -up is defined by the inability  to reach the subject after a minimum of three documented 
phone calls, faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by subject to one registered mail letter. 
All attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical records. If it is determined that the 
subject has died, the site will use permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of death.
If investigator’s use of third- party representative to assist in the follow -up portion of the study 
has been included in the subject’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a Sponsor -
retained third- party representative to assist site staff with obtaining subject’s contact information 
or other public vital status data necessary  to complete th e follow -up portion of the study .The site 
staff and representative will consult publicly  available sources, such as public health registries 
and databases, in order to obtain updated contact information. If after all attempts, the subject 
remains lost to follow -up, then the last known alive date as determined by  the investigator should 
be reported and documented in the subject’s medical records.

4.1.1 Investigational Product
An investigational product, also known as investigational medicinal product in some regions, is 
defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a 
reference in a clinical study , including products alread y with a marketing authorization but used 
or assembled (formulated or packaged) differently  than the authorized form, or used for an 
unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information ab out the authorized form.
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is 
the responsibility  of the investigator to ensure that investigational product is only dispensed to 
study  subjects. The investigatio nal product must be dispensed only from official study  sites by 
authorized personnel according to local regulations. 
In this protocol, investigational product(s) is/are: BMS -936558 (nivolumab).

Clinical Protocol CA209140
BMS -936558 nivolumab
Nivolumab is to be administered as a 60-minute IV infusion, using a volumetric pump with a 
0.2/0.22 micron in-line filter at the protocol -specified dose. The drug can be diluted with 
0.9% normal saline for delivery  but the total drug concentration of the solution cannot be below 
0.35 mg/mL . It is not to be administered as an IV push or bolus injection. At the end of the 
infusion, flush the line with a sufficient quantity of normal saline.
4.2 Method of Assigning Su bject Identification
After the subject’s initial eligibility  is established and informed consent has been obtained, the 
subject must be enrolled into the study  by calling an IVRS to obtain the subject number. Every 
subject that signs the informed consent form must be assigned a subject number in IVRS. 
Specific instructions for using IVRS will be provided to the investigational site in a separate 
document. 
The investigator (or designee) will register the subject for enrollment by following the 
enrollment procedures established by BMS. The following information is required for 
enrollment:
Date of informed consent
Date of birth
Gender at birth.
4.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Eligible subjects will receive treatment with nivolumab at a dose of 3mg/kg, as a 60-minute 
IVinfusion, on Day 1 of a treatment cycle every  2 weeks. Subjects must be treated within one 
day after study  drug vial assignment. Dosing calculations should be based on the body  weight 
assessed as per Table 5.1-2. If the subject’s weight on the day of dosing differs by >10% from 
the weight used to calculate the dose, the dose must be recalculated. All doses should be rounded 
to the nearest milligram. There will be no dose escalations or reductions of nivolumab allowed. 
Subjects may be dosed no less than 12 days between doses and no more than 3days after the 
scheduled dosing date. There are no premedications recommended for nivolumab on the first 
cycle. If an acute infusion reaction is noted, subjects should be managed according to 
Section 4.3.6.
Treatment may be delay ed for up to a maximum of 6 weeks from the previous dose 
(See Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.4 ).
Tumor assessments by spiral CT/MRI  for allsubjects should continue as per protocol even if 
dosing is delay ed.
Subjects will be monitored continuously  for AEs while on study . Treatment modifications 
(eg,dose delay  or discontinuation) will be based on specific laboratory  and adverse event 
criteria.

delay  dosing for drug- related Grade 3 toxicity
Any adverse event, laboratory  abnormality , or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of 
the investi gator, warrants delay ing the dose of study  medication.
4.3.2.1 Management Algorithms for Immuno -Oncology Agents
Immuno -oncology  (I-O) agents are associated with adverse events that can differ in severit y and 
duration than adverse events caused by other therapeuti c classes. Nivolumab is considered an 
immuno -oncology  agent in this protocol. Early  recognition and management of adverse events 
associated with immuno -oncology  agents may mitigate severe toxicity . Management algorithms 
have been developed to assist invest igators in assessing and managing the following groups of 
adverse events:
Gastrointestinal
Renal
Pulmonary
Hepatic
Endocrinopathies
Skin

4.3.6 Treatment of Nivolumab Related Infusion Reactions
Since nivolumab contains only human immunoglobulin protein seque nces, it is unlikely  to be 
immunogenic and induce an infusion or hypersensitivity  reaction. However, if such a reaction 
were to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruritis, arthralgias, 
hypo-or hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms. All Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions 
should be reported within 24 hours to the BMS Medical Monitor and reported as an SAE if 
criteria are met. Infusion reactions should be graded according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE) (Version 4.0) guidelines.
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptoms : (Mild reaction; infusion interrupt ion not indicated; intervention not 
indicated)
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery  from symptoms. The following 
prophy lactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhy dramine 50mg 
(orequivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) at least 30minutes before 
additional nivolumab administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms : (Moderate reaction requires therap y or infusion interruption but 
responds promptly  to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihistamines, non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory  drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophy lactic 
medications indicated for 24 hours).
Stop the nivolumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the subject with 
diphenhy dramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen); 
remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid or 
bronchodilator therapy  may also be administered as appropriate. If the infusion is interrupted, 
restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate when symptoms resolve; if no further 
complications ensue after 30 minute s, the rate may be increased to 100% of the original infusion 
rate. Monitor subject closely . If symptoms recur then no further nivolumab will be administered 
at that visit. Administer diphenhy dramine 50 mg IV, and remain at bedside and monitor the 
subject until resolution of symptoms. The amount of study  drug infused must be recorded on the 
electronic case report form (eCRF). The following proph ylactic premedications are 
recommended for future infusions: diphenhy dramine 50 mg (orequivalent) and/or 
paraceta mol325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) should be administered at least 30minutes before

additional nivolumab administrations. If necessary , corticosteroids (recommended dose: up to 
25mg of IV h ydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used.
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms: (Severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [ie, not rapidly  
responsive to symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of 
symptoms following initial improvement; hospitalization indicated for other clinical sequelae 
[eg,renal impairment, pulmonary  infiltrates]). Grade 4: (life-threatening; pressor or ventilatory 
support indicated).
Immediately  discontinue infusion of nivolumab. Begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat 
the subject as follows. Recommend bronchodilator s, epinephrine 0.2 to 1mg of a 
1:1,000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution 
injected slowly  for IV administration, and/or diphenh ydramine 50mg IV with 
methy lprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subject should be monitored until the 
investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab will be permanentl y 
discontinued. Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the treatment of 
anaph ylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery  from symptoms. In the case 
of late -occurring hy persensitivity  symptoms (eg, appearance of a localized or generalized pruritis 
within 1week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (eg,oral antihistamine, or 
corticosteroids).
4.3.7 Guidelines for Assessment and Man agement of Tumor Lysis Syndrome
The possibility  of tumor lysis syndrome cannot be ruled out for the subjects with lymphoma. 
Therefore, adequate management such as hydration and/or the use of allopurinol is 
recommended in the subjects who have risk factor of potential tumor lysis syndrome, for 
example the subjects with high tumor burden, reflected by high serum LDH levels, or bulky 
disease, or those with preexisting renal failure.
4.3.8 Treatment Beyond Disease Progression
4.3.8.1 Circumstances in which Post-progression Treatment is Permitted
Subjects meeting progression defined by  relapsed disease (after CR) or progressive disease (after 
PR, SD) per 2007 IWG criteria may continue receiving study medication beyond 
investigat or-assessed progression as long as they  meet the following criteria:
Continue to meet all other study  protocol eligibility  criteria
Investigator -assessed clinical benefit , and do not have rapid disease progression 
Stable performance status 
Treatment beyond progression will not delay  an imminent intervention to prevent serious 
complications of disease progression 
Patients will be re-consented with an informed consent document describing any reasonabl y 
foreseeable risks or discomfort and other alternative treatment options 
Tolerance of stud y drug

The decision to continue treatment bey ond investigator -assessed progression should be discussed 
with the BMS Medical Monitor and documented in the study  records. The assessment of clinical 
benefit should take into account whether the subject is clinically  deteriorating and unlikely  to 
receive further benefit from continued treatment.
4.3.8.2 Assessment schedule for the subjects with post -progression treatment
The subject should continue to receive monitoring according tothe On-Treatment Assessments 
onTable 5.1-2 except for FDG -PET scans. Radiographic assessment by CT (preferred) or MRI 
described in the section 5.4.1 and Table 5.4.1-1 are required when subjects continue post-
progression treatment. FDG -PET scans are not m andated after investigator -assessed progression
4.3.8.3 Discontinuation due to F urther Progression
Subjects should discontinue study  therap y upon evidence of further progression, defined as an 
additional 10% or greater increase in tumor burden volume from time of initial progression 
(including all target lesions and new measurable lesions). 
Further progression is evaluated by a  subsequent CT or MRI which is performed at least 
8weeks from previous CT or MRI .
The tumor burden volume from time of initial progression should be used as the reference 
baseline for comparison with the post -progression assessment.
New lesions are considered measurable at the time of initial progression if the long axis is 
more than 15 mm regardless of the short axis. If a lymph node has a long axis of 11 to 
15mm, it should only  be considered measurable if its short axis is more than 10 mm.
Any new lesion considered non-measurable at the time of or after initial progression may 
become measurable and therefore included in the tumor burden de termination.
4.3.8.4 Radiographic Assessment for Subjects who Discontinue Study Drug 
during P ost-progression Treatment
For subjects that discontinue post-progression treatment, no additional radiographic assessments 
will be required. Upon treatment discontinuatio n, these subjects will continue in the follow -up 
phase of the study  (see Section 5.1). Subjects who proceed to allogeneic SCT or ASCT will be 
followed as described in Section 5.4.
4.4 Blinding/Unblinding
Not applicable.
4.5 Treatment Compliance
Treatment complianc e will be monitored by drug accountability  as well as the subject’s medical 
record and CRF.

EORTC QL Q-C30 and EQ -5D questionnaires
Pregnancy  Surveillance Forms
IRRC manual.
5.3 Safety  Assessments
At baseline, a medical history  will be obtained to capture relevant underly ing conditions. The 
baseline examinations should include weight, height, ECOG Performance Status, BP, HR, 
temperature and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry  at rest and after exertion and should be 
performed within 28 days prior to first dose as described in Table 5.1-1 Notes. Baseline signs 
and symptoms are those that are assessed within 14 days prior to first dose. Concomitant 
medications will be collected from within 14days prior to first dose through the study  treatment 
period.
Baseline local laboratory  assessments should be done within 14 days prior tofirst dose to 
include: CBC w/differential, LFTs (ALT, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase), uric acid, 
BUN or serum urea level, creatinine, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, P, LDH, glucose, urinaly sis, TSH, and 
Hep B and C testing (HBV sAg, HCV Ab or HCV RNA) (s ee Table 5.1-1). Pregnancy  testing for 
WOCBP (done locally ) must be performed at baseline (within 28days prior to first dose) and 
repeated within 24hours prior to the initial administration of study  drug, then every  4  w eeks 
(±7days) regardless of dosin g schedule.
Subjects will be evaluated for safety  if they have received any study  drug. Toxicity  assessments 
will be continuous during the treatment phase. During the safet y follow -up phase (Follow -up 
visits X01 and X02, Table 5.1-3) toxicity  assessments should be done in person. Once subjects 
reach the survival follow -up phase either in person or documented telephone calls/emails to 
assess the subject’s status are acceptable.
Adverse events and laboratory  values will be graded according to the NCI -CTCAE ve rsion 4.0.
Performance status and body  weight should be assessed at each on study visit prior to nivolumab 
dosing and at Cy cle 1 Day  8. Vital signs should also be taken as per institutional standard of care 
prior to, during, and after dosing. Oxygen satura tion by pulse oximetry  at rest and after exertion

should be assessed at each on-study  visit prior to nivolumab dosing. The start and stop time of 
the nivolumab infusion should be documented. Physical examinations are to be performed as 
clinically  indicated . If there are any  new or worsening clinically  significant changes since the last 
exam, report changes on the appropriate non -serious or serious adverse event page.
On treatments local laboratory  assessments should be done within 72 hours prior to dosing;
Extended on-treatment local laboratory assessments : Cycle 1 through Cycle 5 and every 
alternate dose thereafter (Cycle 7, 9, 11, 13, etc) and include: CBC with differential, uric 
acid, serum urea level, serum creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesi um, 
phosphorus, chloride, amylase, lipase, glucose, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphatase, LDH.
Limited on-study treatment laboratory assessment : beginning at Cycle 6 and every 
alternate dose thereafter (Cycle 8, 10, 12, 14, etc) and include: CBC , LFTs (ALT, AST, total 
bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase) and creatinine.
In addition, TSH (with reflexive Free T4 and Free T3) should be performed every  6  w eeks 
(±7days) regardless of dosing schedule.
Additional measures, including non-study  required laboratory  tests, should be performed as 
clinically  indicated or to comply  with local regulations. Laboratory toxicities (eg, suspected drug 
induced liver enzyme elevations) will be monitored during the follow -up phase via on site/local 
labs until all study  drug related toxicities resolve, return to baseline or are deemed irreversible.
Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry  should be obtained prior to each dose of nivolumab and at 
any time a subject has any new or worsening respiratory  symptoms. A reading at rest and on 
exertion should be obtained at each time point. The extent of the exertion should be based on the 
judgment of the investigator, but should remain consistent for each individual subject throughout 
the study . If the patient’s subject’s status change s, the investigator can alter the extent of exertion 
based on their medical judgment. If a subject shows changes on pulse oximetry  or other 
pulmonary -related signs (eg, hypoxia, fever) or symptoms (eg, dyspnea, cough) consistent with 
possible pulmonary  adverse events, the patient subject should be immediately  evaluated to rule 
out pulmonary  toxicity . An algorithm for the management of suspected pulmonary  toxicity  can 
be found in the BMS -936558 (nivolumab) Investigator Brochure.
Some of the previously  referr ed to assessments may not be captured as data in the eCRF. They  
are intended to be used as safet y monitoring by the treating physician. Additional testing or 
assessments may be performed as clinically  necessary  or where required by institutional or local 
regulations.
For subjects who discontinue study  therap y by proceeding to allogeneic SCT, documentation of 
acute and chronic GVHD will be captured on Day 100, at 6 months, 1 year and every year 
thereafter from the date of stem cell infusion until the first non-CR after SCT is documented 
Appendix 5. Investigators will make telephone contact with the subject’s 
hematologist /oncologist /transplant physician to obtain this information if the subject is being 
followed b y another ph ysician.

5.3.1 Imaging Assessment for t he Study
Images will be submitted to an imaging corelab for central review. Sites will be trained prior to 
scanning the first study  subject. Image acquisition guidelines and submission process will be 
outlined in the CA209140 I maging Manual to be provided by the corelab.
Any incidental findings of potential clinical relevance that are not directly  associated with the 
objectives of the protocol should be evaluated and handled by the Study  Investigator as per 
standard medical/clinical judgment.
5.4 Efficacy  Asses sments
The primary  efficacy  assessment is ORR, defined as a subject achieving either a PR or CR 
according to the 2007 IWG criteria (Appendix 2). The primary  efficacy assessment, along with 
the secondary  endpoints of DOR, CRR, CR duration, PRR, PR duration and PFS will be based 
on IRRC assessments. Assessment of ORR, based on investigator assessments, will be examined 
as a secondary  endpoint. Sites are required to send all on-study  disease assessments to the IRRC 
for review.
Once subjects discontinue study  therap y by proceeding to allogeneic SCT or ASCT, they  will not 
undergo IRRC -radiographic assessments as described in Section 5.4.1. Instead, they will be 
evaluated using the following schedule . Tum or assessment (CR or non-CR) will be assessed 
by the invest igator according to the 2007 IWG criteria and will be required on Day 100, at 
6 months, 1 year and every year thereafter from the date of stem cell infusion until the first 
non-CR after SCT is documented. Investigators will make telephone contacts with thesubject’s 
referring hematologist/oncologist/transplant physician to obtain CR or non-CR status and 
document the status if subject is being followed by another ph ysician.
5.4.1 Radiographic Assessments
Radiographic study  evaluations will take place in accordance with the flow charts in 
Section 5.1 and Table 5.4.1-1. Baseline assessments should be performed within 28days prior to 
the first dose, utilizing spiral CT or MRI. In addition to chest, abdomen, and pelvis, all known 
sites of disease (including CNS) shoul d be assessed at baseline. A PET scan is required at 
baseline for all subjects, and to confirm a complete response (CR).
On-study  assessments should include chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and all known sites of disease 
(including CNS) and should use the same imaging method as was used at baseline. 
Subjects will be evaluated for tumor response by spiral CT/MRI  beginning at Week 9 and 
continuing every  8weeks (1 week) through the first 8months, every  12weeks (2weeks) 
Months 9 - 24, and then every  6month s (3weeks) thereafter until disease progression is 
documented or until the subject initiates a preparative regimen for allogeneic SCT or ASCT, 
whichever occurs earlier . 
Tumor assessments for ongoing study  treatment decisions will be completed by the investigator 
using 2007 I WG criteria (Appendix 2).

5.4.2 Assessment of Overall Tumor Burden and Measurable Disease
To serially  evaluate tumor response to therapy, it is necessary  to estimate the overall tumor 
burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. Measurable 
disease is defined by the presence of at least one measurable tumor lesion. When CT scans have 
slice thickness greater than 5mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion shoul d be twice the 
slice thickness.
At baseline, tumor lesions/ly mph nodes will be categorized as measurable or nonmeasurable as 
follows in Sections 5.4.2.1 and 5.4.2.2.
5.4.2.1 Measurable Lesions
Measurable lesions must be accuratel y measured in at least two perpendi cular dimensions based 
on Cheson 2007 criteria.95In order to meet eligibility criteria, subjects must have at least 
one lymph node or extra -nodal node with long axis measurement > 15 mm, regardless of 
the short axis measurement . Additional lymph nodes are considered to be measurable for 
purposes of efficacy  assessments if the longest axis is 11 to 15mm AND the short axis is 
> 10 mm. Ly mph nodes 10mm x 10mm will not be considered as measurable
If possible, nodes or masses should be from disparate regions of the body  and they should 
include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are involved.
5.4.2.2 Non- Measurable Lesions
All other lesions, including small lymph nodes (longest diameter < 10 mm) as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions.
Lesions considered truly  non-measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or 
pericardial effusion, inflammatory  breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, 
abdominal masses/abdominal organomegal y identified by physical exam that is not measurable 
by reproducible imaging techniques.

5.4.3 Specifications by Method of Assessment
5.4.3.1 Measurement of Lesions
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (cm). All baseline evaluations should be 
performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 28days before the 
beginning of treatment.
5.4.3.2 Method of Assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.Imaging based evaluation should 
alway s be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by  clinical 
5.4.3.3 Spiral CT/MRI Scan
Spiral CT/MRI  is the best currentl y available and reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment. Measurability  of lesions on Spiral CT/MRI  scan is based on 
the assumption that CT/MRI  slice thickness is 5 mm or less. When CT scans have slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurab le lesion should be twice the slice thickness. 
NOTE: PET/CT hybrid scanners may be used for the acquisition of required CT images only if 
the CT is of diagnostic quality  and adheres to protocol- specified scan parameters. Also, the CT 
images must be separa ted from the PET data prior to submitting the data, and cannot be 
transmitted as fused CT/PET images.
Note on PET/CT scans: Combined modality  scanning such as with PET/CT is increasingl y used 
in clinical care. Low dose or attenuation correction CT portions of a combined PET/CT are of 
limited use in anatomically  based efficacy  assessments and it is therefore suggested that they 
should not be substituted for dedicated diagnostic contrast enhanced CT scans for anatomicall y 
based measurements. However, if a site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET/CT is of identical diagnostic quality  to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast) then the 
CT portion of the PET/CT can be used for measurements.
5.4.3.4 Clinical Lesions
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and 10mm 
diameter as assessed using calipers. As previously  noted, when lesions can be evaluated both by 
clinical exam and imaging, imaging evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective 
and may  also be reviewed by  the IRRC.
5.4.3.5 PET scan
A baseline PET scan is required for each treated subject. An additional PET scan is required to 
confirm a CR.

5.4.4 Baseline Documentation of “Target” and “Non- Target” Lesions
5.4.4.1 Target Lesions
At baseline, up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses meeting the criteria for 
measurable lesions given in Section 5.4.2.1 should be identified as target lesions and their 
measurements recorded. Other measurable lesions will be designated as non -target lesions.
A sum of the prod uct of the diameters (SPD) will be calculated for all target lesions and recorded 
as the baseline SPD. The baseline SPD will be used as reference to further characterize any 
objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.
5.4.4.2 Non- Target Lesions
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including non- measurable l ymph nodes should be identified 
as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absen t’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal 
progression’. In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same 
organ as a single item on the case report form (eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or 
multiple liver nodules’).
5.4.5 Bone Marrow Assessments
To determine the extent of disease involvement in the bone marrow, biopsy /aspirate performed 
within 90 days prior to obtaining informed consent must be documented at screening or a bone 
marrow biops y/aspirate must be performed during the screening period. If a bone marrow 
biopsy /aspirate is performed during the screening period, consider submitting a bone marrow 
aspirate sample for biomarker anal yses.
For subjects with marrow involvement at screening, a bone marrow biopsy  and aspirate will be 
required to confirm a CR,  
.
5.4.6 Disease Response Evaluation
The determination of disease response to study  treatment will be made using 2007 IWG criteria 
(Appendix 2).
Note: 2007 IWG criteria define relapsed disease or progressive disease based largel y on the 
evaluation of nodal masses, spleen/liver, and bone marrow (Appendix 2). The criteria also 
stipulate that disease that is only assessable but not measureable (eg, pleural effusion or bone 
lesion) will be recorded as “present” or “absent”, unless such an assessable abnormalit y, noted 
by imaging studies or physical examination, is confirmed to be histologically  negative. For 
purposes of protocol -defined disease progress ion, the appearance of new sites of assessable but 
not measureable disease while on treatment meets protocol criteria for progression if histological 
results are documented (eg, the presence of ly mphoma cells in a pleural effusion or spinal fluid).
5.5 Pharmac okinetic A ssessments
Samples for pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity  assessment will be collected for all subjects 
receiving nivolumab. Table 5.5-1 lists the sampling schedule to be followed for

pharmacokinetics and immunogenicit y. All timepoints are relati ve to the start of study  drug 
administration. All on treatment PK timepoints are intended to align with days on which study 
drug is administered. If it is known that a dose is going to be delay ed, then the predose sample 
should be collected just prior to the delay ed dose. However, if a predose sample is collected, but 
the dose is subsequently  delayed, an additional predose sample should not be collected. Further 
details of blood collection and processing will be provided in the procedure manual.

aPredose samples should be taken just prior to the administration (preferably within 30 minutes, however predose 
collection up to 4 hours before study drug administration would be acceptable).If the infusion is delayed and a 
predose sample was already colle cted, there is no need to collect an additional predose sample.
bEOI = end of infusion . This sample should be taken immediately prior to stopping the infusion of nivolumab 
(preferably within 2 minutes prior to the end of infusion). If the end of infusion is delay ed to beyond the nominal 
infusion duration, the collection of this sample should also be delayed accordingly. EOI samples may not be 
collected from the same IV access as drug was administered; refer to the lab manual for additional restrictions.
5.5.1 Pharmacokinetic Sample Analysis
Serum samples will be analyzed for nivolumab by a validated method. In addition, selected 
serum samples may be analy zed by an explorat ory analytical method that measures nivolumab 
for technology  exploration purposes; exploratory  results will not be reported.

Tumor Biopsy:
Minimum of 1 FFPE tumor tissue block (preferred) OR minimum of 10 FFPE unstained sections 
are required for assessment of PD -L1 status and other biomarker evaluations.
Tumor samples obtained from bone metastases are not considered acceptable for PD-L1 testing 
because the PD-L1 assay  does not include a decalcification step. For any cases where the only 
tumor tissue available is from a bone metastasis lesion, please discuss further with the study  
Medical Monitor.
Bone Marrow Aspirates
Submission of samples from bone marrow aspirates that may be performed at screening and 
during CR evaluation (only  for subjects who had marrow involvement at study  entry) is optional 
but strongly  encouraged for biomarker assessment. These will be utilized to assess the 
phenoty pic and functional status of immune cells and tumor cells.
All subjects may volunteer to undergo bone marrow biopsy  and aspirate at any time during 
therap y if clinicall y indicat ed. When bone marrow biopsy  is done, submission of bone marrow 
aspirate is strongly  encouraged
Bone marrow aspirates will be obtained using institutional standards for these procedures.

5.7 Outcomes Research A ssessments
Outcomes research data including health related quality  of life and patient reported symptom 
burden provide a more complete understanding of the impact of treatment by incorpora ting the 
patients’ perspective. These data offer insights into the patient experience that may not be 
captured through physician reporting. Generic health related qualit y of life scales provide data 
necessary  in calculating utility  values for health econom ic models. The EQ-5D will be collected 
in order to assess the impact of nivolumab on generic health related quality  of life and the data 
will be used for populating health economic models most notably , cost effectiveness analysis. 
The EORTC -QLQ C-30 will be collected in order to assess cancer specific health related qualit y 
of life. The combination of the generic scale for general health status and economic evaluation 
and the cancer specific scale will provide a robust outcomes research package. 
The EORTC QLQ -C30 is one the most commonly  used QoL instrument in oncology  studies. The 
EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item instrument comprising six functional scales 
(physical functioning, cognitive functioning, emotional functioning, role functioning, social 
functioning and global quality  of life) as well as nine symptom scales 
(fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and 
financial difficulties). Except for the overall health status and global quality  of life items, 
respons es for all items are 4-point categorical scales ranging from 1 (Not at all) to 
4(Very much). The overall health status/quality  of life responses are 7 -point L ikert scales. 
General health status will be measured using the EQ-5D. The EQ-5D is a standardize d 
instrument for use as a measure of self-reported general health status. The EQ-5D comprises 
5dimensions (mobility , self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety ) and a visual 
analog rating scale (VAS). The utility  data generated from the EQ-5D is recommended for and 
commonly  used in cost effectiveness anal ysis.
All QoL  assessments will be administered as outlined in Table 5.1-2 and Table 5.1 -3.
5.8 Other A ssessments 
5.8.1 Immunogenicity Assessments
Serum samples collected at timepoints identified in Table 5.5-1 will be analy zed by a validated 
immunogenicit y assay . All on-treatment timepoints are intended to align with days on which 
study  drug is administered, if dosing occurs on a different day, the immunogenicity  sampling 
should be adjusted accordingl y.  
 
In addition, serum samples designated for PK or biomarker assessments may also be used for 
immunogenicit y analysis if required (eg, insufficient volume for complete immunogenicity 
assessment or to follow up on suspected immunogenicity  related AE).

5.9 Results of Central A ssessments
The primary  endpoint is ORR, as determined by  the IRRC. 
Site will be informed of quality  issues or needs for repeat scanning via queries from the corelab. 
Results of central Imaging anal ysis will not be returned to the site.
6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subject administered an investigational 
(medicinal) product and that does not necessaril y have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporall y associated with the use of investigational product, 
whether or not considered related to the investigational product.
The causal relationship to study  drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess 
all adverse events (AE). The casual relationship can be one of the following:
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between study  drug administration and 
the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study  drug 
administration and the AE. 
The term "reasonable causal relationship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship. 
Adverse events can be spontaneously  reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
6.1 Serious A dverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any  untoward medical occurrence that at an y dose: 
results in death
is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically  might have caused death if it 
were more seve re)
requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization 
(seeNOTE below)
results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
is a congenital anomal y/birth defect 
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediatel y 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.)

Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospitalizat ion.) Potential drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an 
important medical event. (See Section 6.6for the definition of potential DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study  
drug is a n SAE. 
Although pregnancy , overdose, cancer, and potential drug induced liver injury  (DILI) are not 
alway s serious by regulatory  definition, these events must be handled as SAEs. 
(See Section 6.1.1 for reporting pregnancies).
Any component of a study  endpoint that is considered related to study  therap y (eg, death is an 
endpoint, if death occurred due to anaphy laxis, anaphy laxis must be reported) should be reported 
as SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
NOTE : 
The following hospitalizations are n ot considered SAEs in BMS clinical studies: 
a visit to the emergency  room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not 
result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)
elective surgery , planned prior to sign ing consent
admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status 
(eg,routine colonoscop y)
medical/surgical admission other than to remedy  ill health and pl anned prior to entry  into 
the study . Appropriate documentation is required in these cases
admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, econo mic 
inadequacy , caregiver respite, family  circumstances, administrative reason).
admission for administration of anti- cancer therapy  in the absence of any  other SAEs
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Following the subject’s written consent toparticipate in the study , all SAEs, whether related or 
not related to study  drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with 
protocol -specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period 
and within 100 days of discontinuation of dosing. If applicable, SAEs must be collected that 
relate to an y later protocol -specified procedure (eg, a follow -up skin biopsy ). 
The investigator should report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is belie ved
 
to be related to stud y drug or protocol -specified procedure. 
An SAE report should be completed for an y event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness.

If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study  drug, but is potentially  related to 
the conditions of the study  (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complication of a study  
procedure ), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study  drug, andpregnancies must be reported to BMS 
(ordesignee) within 24 hours. SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report Form; pregnancies on 
a Pregnancy  Surveillance Form (electronic or paper forms). When using paper forms, the reports 
are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact Information list.
SAE Facsimile Number: Refer to Contact Information list.
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC), electronic submission is the 
required method for reporting. The paper forms should be used and submitted immediately , only 
in the event the electronic system is unavailable for transmission. When paper forms are used, 
the original paper forms are to remain on site.
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy  reporting): Refer to Contact 
Information list.
If only  limited information is initially  available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow -up 
SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially  reported.)
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity  or relationship to study  drug or if new information 
becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to the BMS 
(ordesignee) u sing the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SA E report.
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.
6.2 Nonserious A dverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collection of nonserious AE information sh ould begin at initiation of study  drug. Nonserious 
AE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead-in period or other 
observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects. 
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1). Follow -up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study  drug and for those present at the end of study  treatment 
as appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious 
AE page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
All nonserious adverse events (not only those deemed to be treatment -related) should be 
collected continuously  during the treatment period and for a minimum of 100 day s following the 
last dose of study  treatment.
Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory  abnormalities 
that are reported/identified during the course of the study.

6.3 Laboratory  Test Result A bnormalities
The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be captured on the nonserious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
Any laboratory  test result that is clinically  significant or meets the defini tion of an SAE 
Any laboratory  test result abnormality  that required the subject to have study  drug 
discontinued or interrupted
Any laboratory  test result abnormality  that required the subject to receive specific corrective 
therap y
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory  term would be used by 
the reporting investigator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).
6.4 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequently  discovered that a study 
subject is pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study  exposure, including during at 
least 5 half lives after product administration, the investigator must immediately  notify  the BMS 
(or designee) Medical Monitor of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy  Surveillance 
Form to BMS (or designee) within 24 hours and in accordance with the SAE reporting 
procedures described in Section 6.1.1. 
In most cases, the study  drug will be permanently  discontinued in an appropriate manner 
(eg,dose taper ing if necessary  for subject safet y).
In the rare event that the benefit of continuing study  drug is thought to outweigh the risk, after 
consultation with BMS, the pregnant subject may continue study  drug, after a thorough 
discussion of benefits and risk with the subject.
Protocol required procedures for study  discontinuation and follow -up must be performed on the 
subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy  (eg, x-ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy 
follow -up procedures should be considered if indicat ed.
Follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy , including perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance form .
Any pregnancy  that occurs in a female partner of a male study  participant should be reported to 
BMS. Information on this pregnancy  will be collected on the Pregnancy  Surveillance Form.
6.5 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product 
that is considered both excessive and medically  important. All occurrences of overdose must be 
reported as an SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details.).

6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injur y (DILI)
Wherever possible, timely  confirmation of initial liver-related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, 
meeting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
Potential drug induced liver injury  is defin ed as: 
1. AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)
AND 
2.Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),
AND 
3.No other immediatel y apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre -existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic. 
6.7 Other Safety  Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, 
electrocardiogram, x-ray filming, any other potential safet y assessment required or not required 
by protocol should also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported 
accordingl y. 
7 DATA MONITORING C OMMITTEE A ND OTHER E XTERNA L 
COMMITTEES
An IRRC will be utilized in this study  for determination of IRRC-assessed primary  (ORR) and 
secondary  (DOR, CRR, PFS) endpoints. The IRRC will review all available tumor assessment 
scans for all treated subjects. Deta ils of IRRC responsibilities and procedures will be specified in 
the IRRC charter.
8 STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
The planned sample size for this study  will be approximately  90 treated subjects.
The sample size was determined based on two considerations: the ability  to produce a CI which 
would exclude an ORR of 20%, which is not considered clinically  relevant and provide sufficient 
information for a reliable understanding of the safety  profile.
Assuming the true ORR is 35%, the study  has approximately  87% power to reject the null 
hypothesis that the true ORR is 20%, considering a 2-sided alpha of 5%. In addition, Table 
8.1-1 summarizes the 95% exact CI for the target ORRs ranging from 30% to 44% with sample 
size of 90. At observed OR R 30%, the lower bound of the 95% CI excludes 20%.

8.3 Endpoint s
8.3.1 Primary Endpoint(s)
The primary  objective will be measured by the primary  endpoint of IRRC-assessed ORR. It is 
defined as the number of subjects with a best overall response (BOR) of CR or PR, according to 
the 2007 IWG criteria, divided by the number of treated subjects. The final analysis of the 
primar y endpoint will occur at least 12 months after the last enrolled subject’s first dose of study 
therap y. The BOR is defined as the best response designation recorded between the date of first 
dose and the date of initial objectively  documented progression per the 2007 IWG criteria or the 
date of subsequent therapy , whichever occurs first. Stem Cell Transplant will be considered as 
subsequent therap y. For subjects without documented progression or subsequent therap y, all 
available response designations will contribute to the BOR determination. For purposes of 
analysis, if a subject receives one dose and discontinues the study  without assessment or receives

subsequent therap y prior to assessment, this subject will be counted in the denominator (as non-
responder ).
8.3.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)
The first secondary  objective will be measured by the DOR based on IRRC assessment. DOR is 
defined as the time from first remission (CR or PR) to the date of initial objectively  documented 
progression as determined using the 2007 I WG criteria or death due to any cause, whichever 
occurs first. For subjects who neither progress nor die, the DOR will be censored on the date of 
their last evaluable tumor assessment. Subjects who start subsequent therap y without a prior 
reported progress ion will be censored at the last evaluable tumor assessments prior to initiation 
of the subsequent anticancer therapy . This endpoint will only be evaluated in subjects with 
objective response of CR or PR. 
The second secondary  objective will be measured bythe CRR based on IRRC assessment. The 
CRR is defined as the number of subjects with a BOR of CR according to the 2007 I WG criteria, 
divided by the number of treated subjects. The BOR is defined similarly  as above. The duration 
of CR will only be evaluated in subjects with BOR of CR and is defined as the time from first 
documentation of CR (the date of first negative FDG -PET scan or the date of first documentation 
of no disease involvement in the bone marrow (if required), whichever occurs later) to the date 
of initial objectivel y documented progression as determined using the revised 2007 IWG criteria 
for malignant lymphoma or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Censoring will be 
applied as per DOR definition.
The third secondary  objective will be measured by PR rate based on IRRC assessment. It is 
defined as the number of subjects with a BOR of PR according to the 2007 IWG criteria, based 
on IRRC assessment, divided by the number of treated subjects. The duration of PR will only be 
evaluated in subjects with BOR of PR and is defined as the time from first documentation of PR 
to the date of initial objectivel y documented progression as determined using the 2007 IWG 
criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Censoring willbe appli ed as per DOR 
definition.
The fourth secondary  objective will be measured by  IRRC- assessed PFS. It is defined as the time 
from first dosing date to the date of the first documented progression, as determined by  an IRRC, 
or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Subjects who die without a reported 
progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Subjects who did 
not progress or die will be censored on the date of their last evaluable assessment. Subjects who 
did not have any on study  assessments and did not die will be censored on the first dosing date. 
Subjects who started any subsequent anti-cancer therapy  without a prior reported progression 
will be censored at the last evaluable assessment prior to initiation of the subsequent anti -cancer 
therap y.
The fifth secondary  objective will be measured by investigator- assessed ORR. Investigator -
assessed ORR is defined similarly  as described for the primary  endpoint above.

8.4.2.3 Exploratory Endpoint Methods
8.4.3 Safety Analyses
Safety  analyses will be performed in all treated subjects. Descriptive statistics of safet y will be 
presented using NCI CTCAE version 4.0. All on-study  AEs, drug-related AEs, SAEs, and 
drug-related SAEs will be tabulated using worst grade per NCI CTCAE v4.0 criteria by system 
organ class and MedDRA preferred term. On-study  lab parameters including hematology , 
chemistry , liver function, thyroid function, and renal function will be summarized using worst 
grade per NCI CTCAE v4.0 criteria.
8.4.4 Pharmacokinetic Analyses
The nivolumab concentration data obtained in this study  may be combined with data from other 
studies in the clinical development program to develop or refine a population PK model. This 
model may be used to evaluate the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic covariates on the PK of 
nivolumab to determine measures of individual exposure (such as steady -state peak, trough, and 
time-averaged concentration). Model determined exposures may be used for exposure -response 
analyses. Results of population PK and exposure -response anal yses will be reported separatel y.
8.4.5 Biomarker Analyses
Methodology  for explo ratory  biomarker anal yses is described in the statistical anal ysis plan.
8.4.6 Outcomes Research Analyses
The analysis of EORTC QLQ-C30 will be performed in all treated subjects who have an 
assessment at baseline (Visit 1 assessment prior to administration of drug) and at least 
1subsequent assessment.
All scales and single items are scored on categorical scales and linearl y transformed to 
0-to-100 scales with higher scores for a functional scale representing higher levels of 
functioning, higher scores for the global health status/quality  of life representing higher levels of 
global health status/quality  of life and higher scores for a symptom scale representing higher 
level of symptoms. Data will be analy zed as change from baseline scores. Baseline and change 
from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status/QoL  composite scale data and the 
remaining EORTC QLQ -C30 scale data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (N, 
mean, standard deviation, median, first and third quartiles, minimum, maximum) at each of the 
assessment time points. In addition, the percentage of subjects demonstrating a clinicall y

meaningful deterioration (defined as a 10 point change from baseline) will be presented for each 
scale at each assessment timepoint. Percentages will be based on number subjects assessed at 
assessment time point.
As previously  mentioned in Section 5.1, the EQ-5D comprises 5 dimensions (mobility , self-care, 
usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety ) and a VAS. EQ-5D data will be described in the 
following t hree way s:
Subject’s overall health state on a visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) at each assessment time 
point will be summarized using descriptive statistics. (N, mean, standard deviation, median, 
first and third quartiles, minimum, maximum) .
Proportion of subjects reporting problems for the 5 EQ-5D dimensions at each assessment 
time point will be summarized by level of problem. Percentages will be based on number 
subjects assessed at assessment time point
A by-subject listing of EQ-5D with the problem levels for each of the 5dimensions 
(mobility , self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety /depression), health state 
(5dimensions digits combined in a 5 -digit number) and EQ -VAS will be provided.
8.4.7 Other Analyses 
8.4.7.1 Immunogenicity Analyses
Immunogenicit y may be reported for ADA positive status (such as persistent positive, 
neutralizing positive, only last sample positive, baseline positive) and ADA negative status, 
relative to baseline. Effect of immunogenicit y on safety , efficacy , biomarkers and PK may be 
explored. Additional details will be descri bed in the SAP .

even t which h ypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe), requires inpatient hospitalization or 
causes prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in 
persistent or significant disability /incapacit y, is a congenital 
anomaly /birth defect; is an important medical event (defined 
as a medical event(s) that may  not be immediatel y life 
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based 
upon appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may

APPENDIX 1 MANAGEMENT ALGORITHMS FOR IMMUN O-ONCOLOGY 
AGENTS
These general guidelines constitute guidance to the Investigator and may be supplemented by 
discussions with the Medical Monitor representing the Sponsor. The guidance applies to all 
immuno -oncology  agents a nd regimens.
A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be diligently evaluated according to 
standard medical practice. Non-inflammatory  etiologies should be considered and appropriatel y 
treated.
Corticosteroids are a primary  therap y for immuno -oncology  drug-related adverse events. The 
oral equivalent of the recommended IV doses may be considered for ambulatory  patients with 
low-grade toxicity . The lower bioavailability  of oral corticosteroids should be taken into account 
when switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids. 
Consultation with a medical or surgical specialist, especially  prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedure, is recommended.
The frequency  and severity  of the related adverse events covered by  these a lgorithms will depend 
on the immuno-oncology agent or regimen being used.

CR (Complete Remission)
The designation of CR requires the following:
1.Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease -related 
symptoms, if present before therapy .
2.a.Typically  [18F] fluorodeox yglucose (FDG) -avid lymphoma: in patients with no 
pretreatment positron emission tomograph y (PET) scan or when the PET scan was positive 
before therapy , a post-treatment residual mass of any size is permitted as long as it is PET 
negative.
3. b. Variabl y FDG -avid l ymphomas/FDG avidity  unknown: in patients without a pretreatment 
PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, all lymph nodes and nodal masses 
must have regressed on computed tomograph y (CT) scan to normal size (1.5 cm in their 
greatest transverse diameter for nodes > 1.5 cm before therapy ). Previously  involved nodes 
thatwere 1.1to 1.5 cm in their long axis and > 1.0 cm in their short axis before treatment 
must have decreased to 1.0 cm in their short axis after treatment.
4.The spleen and/or liver, if considered enlarged before therapy  on the basis of a physical 
examinat ion or CT scan, should not be palpable on physical examination and should be 
considered normal size by imaging studies, and nodules related to lymphoma should 
disappear. However, determination of splenic involvement is not alway s reliable because a 
spleen considered normal in size may still contain lymphoma, whereas an enlarged spleen 
may reflect variations in anatomy , blood volume, the use of hematopoietic growth factors, or 
causes other than ly mphoma.
5.If the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma before treatment, the infiltrate must have 
cleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy . The biopsy  sample on which this determination is 
made must be adequate (with a goal of > 20 mm unilateral core). If the sample is 
indeterminate b y morphology , it should be negative by  immunohistochemistry . A sample that 
is negative by immunohistochemistry  but demonstrates a small population of clonal 
lymphocy tes by flow cytometry  will be considered a CR until data become available 
demonstrating a clear difference in patient outcome.
PR (Partial Remission)
The designation of PR requires all of the following:
1. At least a 50% decrease in the sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the 
largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. These nodes or masses should be selected according 
to all of the following: they should be clearl y measurable in at least 2 perpendicular 
dimensions; if possible they should be from disparate regions of the body ; and they should 
include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites a re involved.
2. No increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen.
3.Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by  50% in their SPD or, for single nodules, in the 
greatest transverse diameter.
4.With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is usually  
assessable and no measurable disease should be present.

5.Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR, if the sample was positive 
before treatment. However, if positive, the cell type should be specified 
(eg,large -celllymphoma or small neoplastic B cells). Patients who achieve a CR by the 
above criteria but have persistent morphologic bone marrow involvement will be considered 
partial responders. When the bone marrow was involved before therapy and a clinical CR 
was achieved but with no bone marrow assessment after treatment, patients should be 
considered partial responders.
6.No new sites of disease should be observed.
7.FDG:
a)Typically  FDG -avid lymphoma: for patients with no pretreatment PET sca n or if the PET 
scan was positive before therap y, the post-treatment PET should be positive in at least 
1previously involved site.
b)Variabl y FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG -avidit y unknown: for patients without a 
pretreatment PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, CT criteria should be 
used. In patients with follicular lymphoma or mantle -cell lymphoma, a PET scan is only 
indicated with 1 or at most 2 residual masses that have regressed by > 50% on CT; those 
with more than 2 residual lesions are unlike ly to be PET negative and should be 
considered partial responders.
SD (Stable Disease)
SD is defined as the following:
1.A patient is considered to have SD when he or she fails to attain the criteria needed for a CR 
or PR but does not fulfill those for progressive disease (see Relapsed Disease [after 
CR]/Progressive Disease [after PR, SD]).
2.Typically  FGD-avid lymphomas: the PET should be positive at prior sites of disease with no 
new areas of involvement on the post- treatment CT or PET scan.
3.Variabl y FDG -avid lymphomas/FDG -avidity  unknown: for patients without a pretreatment 
PET scan or if the pretreatment PET was negative, there must be no change in the size of the 
previous lesions on the post -treatment CT scan.
PD: Relapsed Disease (after CR)/Progressive Disease (after PR, SD)
Lym ph nodes should be considered abnormal if the long axis is > 1.5 cm regardless of the short 
axis. If a lymph node has a long axis of 1.1 to 1.5 cm, it should only be considered abnormal if 
its short axis is > 1.0. Lymph nodes 1.0x 1.0 cm will not be considered abnormal for relapse 
or progressive disease.
1.Appearance of any new lesion > 1.5 cm in any axis during or at the end of therap y, even if 
other lesions are decreasing in size. Increased FDG uptake in a previously  unaffected site 
should only be considered relapsed or PD after confirmation with other modalities. In 
patients with no prior history  of pulmonary  lymphoma, new lung nodules identified by CT 
are mostly  benign. Thus, a therapeutic decision should not be made solely  onthe basis of the 
PET without histologic confirmation.

2. At least a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously  involved nodes, or in a 
single involved node, or the size of other lesions (eg, splenic or hepatic nodules). To be 
considered PD, a lymph node with a diameter of the short axis of < 1.0 cm must increase by 
50% and to a size of 1.5 x 1.5 cm or > 1.5 cm in the long axis.
3. At least a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single previously  identified node 
> 1cm in its short axis.
4.Lesion s should be PET positive if observed in a typical FDG -avid lymphoma or the lesion 
was PET positive before therap y unless the lesion is too small to be detected with current 
PET sy stems (< 1.5 cm in its long axis by  CT).
Measurable extranodal disease shoul d be assessed in a manner similar to that for nodal disease. 
For these recommendations, the spleen is considered nodal disease. Disease that is only 
assessable (eg, pleural effusions, bone lesions) will be recorded as present or absent only , unless, 
while an abnormality  is still noted by imaging studies or physical examination, it is found to be 
histologically  negative.
In clinical trials where PET is unavailable to the vast majority  of participants, or where PET is 
not deemed necessary  or appropriate for use (eg, a trial in patients with MAL T lymphoma), 
response should be assessed as above, but onl y using CT scans. However, residual masses should 
not be assigned CRu status, but should be considered partial responses.

Protocol Amendment 02 CA209140
BMS -936558 nivolumab
2Amendment Rationale:
The main objective of this amendment is to implement a mandatory  recommendation received 
from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as follows:
The exclusion criterion has been added to exclude the subjects who received chest radiation 
24 weeks prior to first dose of the stud y drug.
Justification for this exclusion criterion is that pneumonitis has been noted in the current 
Investigator Brochure as a treatment -related serious adverse event (SAE). The FDA notes that 
“Radiation pneumonitis can occur in patients who have received chest radiation up to 24 weeks 
after radiation therap y.”  Chest radiation is not commonly  used in the subjects eligible for this 
protocol, and this amendment will comply  with the FDA recommendation without altering the 
basic study  population or trial design.
Additional updates were also made to the protocol including items such as clarify ing the 
schedule of tumor assessment, correcting t ypographical and formatting errors,  
.
Changes to the Protocol:
1.Section 3.1, Study  Design and Duration, Treatment
a)Bullet point 8: Corrected “Subjects will be evaluated for response according to revised 
Inter national Working Group Criteria beginning at Week 9 (Day  1of Cycle 5) and 
continuing every  8 weeks (7days) for the first eight months of treatment, then every 
12weeks up to 2 years of treatment, continuing every  6  m onths beyond 2 years of 
treatment, until disease progression. If the subject discontinues treatment prior to disease 
progression, tumor assessment will continue in the follow -up phase
2. Section 3.3.2 Exclusion Criteria:
a)Added Criterion 
5e): Chest radiation 24 weeks prior to first dose of the study  drug. 
4. Section 5.3.1, Imaging Assessment for the Study : Corrected typo in “Image acquisition 
guidelines and submission process will be outlined in the CA209140 Imaging Manual to be 
provided b y the corelab.
Please maintain a copy of this amendment with your protocol. Please provide a copy to 
your Investigational Review Board / Ethics Committee, unless agreed otherwise with BMS.

Protocol Amendment 03 CA209140
BMS -936558 nivolumab
2Amendment Rationale:
One of the main purposes of this global amendment is to modify  a few eligibility  criteria to 
facilitate subject enrollment: 
Rationale to authorize subject population with prior autologous SCT outside a window of 
12weeks prior to first dose of study  therapy .
Recent evide nce indicates that Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT) may provide 
clinical benefits for patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL).1,2A European 
randomized study  has confirmed the superiorit y of the ASCT arm over the standard 
therap y arm in relap sed FL.3Additional retrospective studies provide further evidence 
supporting the clinical benefits of using ASCT for relapsed FL patients.1,4The optimal 
timing for ASCT remains uncertain, however, as the clinical benefits from ASCT have 
been limited to alarge extent to patients with relapsed FL. A similar benefit, however, 
has not been observed in the front -line setting.2Therefore, the current use of ASCT in 
relapsed FL can vary depending on each country  or on each transplant center.5
Nevertheless, the current ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines recognizes that high-dose 
chemotherap y with ASCT prolongs PFS and OS and should be specifically  considered in 
patients with short -lived first remissions after failure of rituximab -containing regimens.6
The present NCCN guideline for NHL also lists high-dose therap y with ASCT as one of 
the second -line consolidation or extended dosing options. Thus, based on these data, it is 
appropriate to enroll patients who have had previous ASCT for BMS -sponsored 
CA209140 study .
Rationale to modify  exclusion criterion 4b
A randomized study  testing R-CHOP (n=202) vs CHOP (n=197) shows that Grade 3 
or 4 adverse events related to the infusion of rituximab were observed in 19 patients in 
the CHOP -plus- rituximab group (9%); the most frequent of these were respiratory 
symptoms (with or without bronchospasm), chills, fever, and hypotension. In all cases, 
the symptoms disappeared after the infusion was slowed or stopped, and no patient died 
as a result of such an adverse event. All patients were able to receive further cycles of 
CHOP plus rituximab without recurrence of Grade 3 or 4 infusion-related reactions. 
Exclusion criteria of history  of severe hypersensitivity  reaction to any monoclonal 
antibody  is reworded to allow for subjects who experienced Grade 3 - 4 infusion -related 
reaction with the first dose of rituximab, but who were able to receive subsequent 
rituximab without recurrence of Grade 3 or 4 infusion- related reaction to be eligible.

BMS -936558 nivolumab
3Another objective of this amendment is toremove the interim analysis and extend the 
duration of follow -up required for all subjects prior to performing the final analy sis of the 
primary  endpoint:
Rationale to remove the Interim Anal yses
In the original protocol, an interim analysis of independent radiologic review 
(IRRC) -assessed ORR is planned to be performed after the first 37 subjects have been 
treated and those subjects who remain on treatment have completed a minimum of 
8weeks follow -up. Updated results from the FL cohort (n=10) in the ongoing Phase 1 
study  (CA209039) indicate that the time to response may be longer than the protocol 
assumptions for both the interim and final analy ses with late responses observed 
10months after the administration of the first dose of nivolumab . In particu lar, two out of 
four responders with FL achieved the first OR at Week 39. Consequently , the estimated 
cumulative response rate at 8, 
16, 24 and 48 weeks are 10, 20, 20, 40%, respectivel y
Thus, the planned interim analy sis at 8 weeks after the first dose da te of the subjects who 
remain on treatment in the original protocol is not expected to adequately  evaluate the 
clinical efficacy  of nivolumab. Furthermore, since the observed response rate for 
nivolumab from the updated Phase 1 data shows a higher response rate (40%) than the 
preliminary  data (25%) supporting the original protocol assumptions, an interim analy sis 
for futility  should be removed from the stud y.
Rationale for extending the timing of the final analysis of the primary  endpoint from 
6months to 1 year after the last enrolled subject’s first dose of study therapy
Late responses, occurring up to 39 weeks from the initial dose, were observed in the FL 
cohort of the Phase 1 study  (CA209039) in recently  updated results. In the original 
protocol, the primary  endpoint analy sis is planned to be performed after six months 
follow -up for the last patient enrolled in this study . Thus, subjects enrolled late in the 
study  and experiencing late response will have insufficient follow -up time after the first 
respon se to adequately  characterize the duration of response. Taking the late responses 
observed in the CA209039 study  into consideration, extending the evaluation of DOR 
with longer follow -up, until 1 year after the last enrolled subject’s first dose of study  
therap y, is likely to provide more scientifically meaningful clinical outcome.
This global amendment will also clarify  that subject may start study  drug before Bone 
Marrow biops y results become available:
The purpose of abone marrow biops y/aspirate is to determine the extent of disease 
(lymphoma) involvement in the bone marrow before starting study  drug treatment. 
Results of a bone marrow biopsy  (pathological reports) may not be able to be confirmed 
before the first dose of study  drug. Because bone marrow biops y results will not change 
eligibility , it is acceptable 
that sites cannot confirm the results of abone marrow biops y as 
long as sites can verify  the documentation that a bone marrow biopsy  was performed. The 
results of a bone marrow biopsy  can be con firmed later.

4The last main objective of this amendment is to authorize subject to continue study  treatment 
beyond progression:
Immunotherapeutic agents produce atypical clinical response patterns, which are not usually 
observed in conventional chemotherap y. Two distinct non-conventional patterns have been 
reported: 1) a reduction in total tumor burden despite of the appearance of new lesion(s), 
and2)responses after a transit increase in total tumor burden in an initial phase, followed by 
subsequent tumor shrinkage. Therefore, it is important to avoid 
premature discontinuation of 
the study  drug as nivolumab might induce non-conventional response patterns in some 
patients. Under the current discontinuation criteria (Section 3.5), subjects must stop the stud y 
drug when investigator assessment determines disease progression using the 2007 Revised 
IWG Response Criteria. The change in this amendment will permit the subjects to continue 
on the study  drug bey ond investigator -assessed disease progression in certain cases.
Additional modifications are as described below:

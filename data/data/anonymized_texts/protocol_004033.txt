SUBJECT: Amendment 4 to NCI p rotocol number 10050 entitled, “A Phase II Study 
of Selumetinib (AZD6244) for the Treatment of Advanced Pancreas Cancer harboring KRAS G12R Mutations ” 
The primary purpose of t his amendment is to update protocol CAEPR and consent Selumetinib  
risk language.  Additionally, please, note , as part of the implementation of version 5.0 of the 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), the CAEPR list for selumetinib, which was previously in CTCAE 4.0 language, has been migrated to CTCAE 5.0 language.  
Patients and their providers are able to send their tumor tissue for somatic gene mutation profiling to Foundation Medicine which performs rapid genotyping on multiple NGS platforms. It issues a 
CLIA report which is in line with study guidelines and makes the patients, without the need for 
further screening, immediately eligible for starting treatment with selumetinib. In this regard, we 
clarified in the protocol that test result from CLIA certified laboratory, confirming somatic KRAS G12R mutation can be used for confirmation of patient ’s eligibility  and to decrease  the number  of 
patients  screened . 
We also have updated dosing delays/dose modifications of selumetinib for the management of 
grade 2 AST/ALT elevations to give patients who only have a transient brief AST/ALT under 
appropriate lab monitoring the possibility to return to DL 0. However, should a grade 2 or greater AST/ALT elevation again occur after restarting selumetinib or return to DL 0, the patient can only continue on DL -1. The AST/ALT elevations we observed were very transient.  To eliminate 
ambiguity as to how often patients can return to higher dose levels after resolution of low grade 
ALT/AST elevations or other related lab abnormalities, we amended Section 6: Upon two recurrences of DLT necessitating dose reduction, no further attempts to return to higher dose level after resolution to ≤Grade 1 will be made.  
Finally, we simplified eligibility criteria with regard to total bilirubin levels now using cutoff elevated versus not elevated above institutional normal (different institutions have different 
definitions and cutoffs), and  defining AEs as elevated above institutional accepted normal levels.  
Editorial changes have been made throughout the document for clarity.

 I. Comments Requiring a Response – Major Issues:  
# Section  Comments  
1 Stats  The trial has expected outcome data for many of the first 7 patients.  Changing the 
statistical plan at this point decreases the statistical rigor of the final analysis.  This 
has been discussed several times with CTEP biostatisticians and CTEP leadership and we do not favor any changes to the 2-stage design for the trial.  If there is not 
an objective response in the first 7 patients, the trial should not proceed to a second 
stage.  If there appears later to be a signal for prolonged stable disease in these 
first-stage patients, this can be discu ssed with CTEP and AstraZeneca.  
Response: We agreed not to change statistical plan.    
 
II. Comments Requiring a Response – Administrative & Editorial Issues:  
# Section  Comments  
2 4.2.2  Specimen Tracking Training: According to section 9.1.1 all sample tracking will 
be managed at NCI.  Please confirm, and if this text is unnecessary, please delete.  
Response: Samples collected at NCI only will be additionally tracked in NCI as described in section 9.1.1 .  Procedures described in Section 4.2.2      will be 
also followed.  
3 Table 9  ctDNA  Blood Collection:  the link should be labeled Appendix H rather than 
Appendix G.  It does jump to the correct section.   
Response: This has been corrected in Section 9  
III. Recommendations:

reported as Grade 5 “Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) – Other (Progressive Disease)” under the system organ class (SOC) of the 
same name.” with the following: 
 
“Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Disease 
progression” in the system organ class (S OC) “General disorders and 
administration site conditions.”

• An active status on a participating roster at the registering site  
 
Sites participating on the NCI CIRB initiative that are approved by the CIRB for 
this stu dy are not required to submit IRB approval documentation to the CTSU 
Regulatory Office. For sites using the CIRB, IRB approval information is received 
from the CIRB and applied to the RSS in an automated process.   Signatory 
Institutions must submit a Study  Specific Worksheet for Local Context (SSW) to 
the CIRB via IRBManager to indicate their intent to open the study locally.   The 
CIRB’s approval of the SSW is then communicated to the CTSU Regulatory Office.   In order for the SSW approval to be processed, t he Signatory Institution 
must inform the CTSU which CIRB -approved institutions aligned with the

 # Section  Comments  
Agent Ordering and Agent Accountability  
 
NCI-supplied agents may be requested by eligible participating Investigators (or 
their authorized designee) at each participating institution.  The CTEP -assigned 
protocol number must be used for ordering all CTEP -supplied investigational 
agents.  The eligible participating investigators at each participating institution 
must be registered with CTEP, DCTD through an annual submission of FDA Form 
1572 (Statement of Investigator), NCI Biosketch, Agent Shipment Form, and 
Financial Disclosure Form (FDF).  If the re are several participating investigators at 
one institution, CTEP -supplied investigational agents for the study should be 
ordered under the name of one lead participating investigator at that institution.  
 
Study agent must be ordered after patient is reg istered to the treatment arm as no 
starter supplies are being provided for this study.  
 
Submit agent requests through the PMB Online Agent Order Processing (OAOP) application.  Access to OAOP requires the establishment of a CTEP Identity and Access Management (IAM) account and the maintenance of an “active” account 
status, a “current” password, and active person registration status.  For questions 
about drug orders, transfers, returns, or accountability, call or email PMB any 
time.  Refer to the PMB’s webs ite for specific policies and guidelines related to 
agent management.

• It is expected that in 2020 pancreas cancer will rank 2nd in cancer -related deaths in the 
U.S. having sur passed colon and breast cancer.  
• Patients with advanced pancreas cancer have few available treatment options and an 
overall poor prognosis.  
• The vast majority of pancreatic cancers (up to ≥94%) harbor mutations of the KRAS 
gene, and there is ample preclinical evidence that KRAS mutations are an essential driver of pancreas cancer development and progression, essential for the unique metabolomic 
and transcriptomic landscape of pancreatic cancers, involved in pancreatic cancer stem 
cell formation, as well as in mediation of resistance to che mo- and molecular therapy.  
• KRAS mutational isoforms and regulators of MAPK signaling are a prognostic 
biomarker for outcome in pancreas cance r. KRAS G12R mutation status predicts 
response to selumetinib inhibition in a large panel of pancreas cancer cell line s. 
• Pre-clinical evidence, both in a large panel of cell lines and in patient -derived 
xenotransplantation models, suggests that selumetinib (AZD6244) has activity against 
pancreas cancers harboring KRAS G12R mutations.  
• This study tests the hypothesis if  patients with advanced pancreas cancer with a unique 
KRAS mutational isoform respond to the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244) and if 
genetic or protein expression information derived from treated patients distinguishes 
patients responding to the drug fr om patients progressing under treatment.  
Objectives : 
• Determine the objective response rate to selumetinib administered as 75 mg orally twice 
daily on a continuous schedule in patients with advanced pancreas cancer harboring KRAS 
G12R mutations.  
Eligibility : 
• Patients must have histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic pancreas 
cancer  
• Patients must have confirmed somatic KRAS G12R mutation as determined by sequence 
analysis of matched normal DNA from any specimen obtained from the individual (pr ior 
CLIA genotyping results from surgical resection specimens are acceptable).  
• Patients must not have had chemotherapy, molecular therapy with erlotinib, radiation therapy, or experimental biological or molecular therapy for at least 4 weeks prior to 
starting study medication.  Patients who received FOLFIRINOX must be 6 weeks from 
the last administration of therapy. Patients must have recovered from any acute toxicity 
related to prior therapy or surgery, to a grade 1 or less unless specified.  
• Age ≥18 years .

 Design : 
• Patients will be screened for the presence of KRAS gene mutations in their tumor and 
only patients who harbor KRAS G12R mutations will be enrolled in the treatment phase of the study.  
• Selumetinib (AZD6244) will be administered as an oral dose of selumetinib sulfate  75 
mg twice daily (in the morning and evening) taken two hours after a meal  and one hour 
before  the next meal .  Selumetinib will be given continuously; one cycle equals 28 +/ - 2 
days.   
• Up to 25 eligible patients (allowing for a staged accrual of initially 10 patients who will 
receive selumetinib and are evaluable after the 1st cycle) will be treated  over 3-4 years 
and the trial will be completed over 4 to 5 years, allowing for completion of follow -up.

2 BACKGROUND 
2.1 Study Disease  
2.1.1 Pancreas cancer –  a disease with dire need for im proved treatments  
The grave unmet medical need for improved treatments in pancreas cancer is well documented by  
A. a 5-year overall survival rate of 7% which has not substantially changed over the last 3 decades  
B. regulatory approval of only 2 cytotoxic chemotherapy combination regimens (FOLFIRINOX 
and gemcitabine+abraxane) since the approval of gemcitabine in 1996 extending overall 
survival by a few months in the combination treatment arms  
C. a current lack of any eff ective precision medicine molecular therapy options  
It is expected that in 2020 pancreas cancer will rank 2
nd in cancer -related deaths in the U.S. having 
surpa ssed colon and breast cancer. [1] Following a U.S. Congressional request, NCI has responded 
in 2010 with a NCI National Pancreas Cancer Action Plan detailing, among other priorities and 
updates, the development of novel innovative therapy options tailored to the unique biolog y of 
pancreas cancer as priorities in the futur e fight against this disease. [2] 
There are no effective molecular therapy options available in pancreas cancer . The anti-EGFR 
small molecule inhibitor erlotinib (Tarceva) received regulatory approval in 2007 fol lowing the 
large phase III Canadian NCIC CTG PA.3 trial. [3]  This study randomized patients afflicted by 
advanced p ancreas cancer (23.5% locally advanced; 76.5% stage IV) to either gemcitabine vs 
gemcitabine plus erlotinib. An increase in OS and PFS of 14 days (2 weeks) in the 
gemcitabine+erlotinib group was observed. While statistically significant, actual prescribing  of 
erlotinib by practicing physicians has declined due to skepticism of its clinical relevance. However, 
considering the positive signal in this large trial it is likely that there is a subset of patients which 
may benefit from anti -EGFR therapy. Consecut ive biomarker studies however, in particular KRAS 
wild type mutation status (following the strong predictive value of KRAS wt status for anti-EGFR 
therapy by cetuximab or panatumumuab in colorectal cancer) or EGFR amplification status failed 
to predict a s ubset of patients with a robust response or improved outcome r eceiving erlotinib

15 
 treatment. [4] These results are mirrored by the large phase III Southwest Oncology Group –
Directed Intergroup Trial S0205 trial of gemcitabine vs gemcitabine+cetuximab in advanced 
pancreas cancer patients: there was a trend towards an improvement of quality -of-life indicators 
at early measurement points in the gemcitabine+cetuximab arm, however no correlative biomarker studies are available to identify a subset e nriched for improved outcome. [
5] Thus,  findings in 
NCIC CTG PA.3 and SWOG Intergroup S0205 on a total of 1,335 patients suggest that there may 
be a subset(s) of patients who may benefit from an anti -EGFR, or a similar molecular therapy 
approach, but that the lack of an accurate biomarker, or understanding of aberrant EGFR signaling , including its effector MAPK pathway, currently prevents these patients from receiving improved 
therapy options, and possibly better outcome, in this rapidly fatal disease.  
Some of the currently most promising molecular, or precision medicine, therapy approaches 
pursued in pancreas cancer to date include, for example, the administration PARP inhibitors in 
BRCA -mutant pancreas cancer (the DNA damage repair genes BRCA1 and 2 are affected by 
somatic variants in 5 -7% of pancreas cancers), the administration of the chemotherapy agent 
oxaliplatinum to patients selected based on a recent genomic DNA damage repair response 
signature, [6] or the 5-hyaluranic acid inhibitor PEGPH20 in combination with gemcitabine to 
increase delivery of gemcitabine to the tumor following lowering of interstitial pressur es and 
‘break of the stromal barrier’. [7] 
In this regard, and as a landmark study in the field, pancreas cancer clinical research has 
spearheaded a first -in-time first-in -human effort of genotype -directed molecular therapy using 
whole genome sequencing (WGS). [8] Investigators of the recently released Precision Medicine 
for Advanced Pancreas Cancer: The Individualized Molecular Pancreatic Cancer Therapy 
(IMPaCT) Trial attem pted to identify druggable mutations in pancreas cancer tumor genomes by 
WGS and treat patients with small molecule inhibitors based on these findings. This study initially raised concerns about the feasibility of acquiring suitable tumor specimens for mol ecular analysis 
and returning high-quality actionable genomic data within a clinically acceptable timeframe: an inability to obtain a biopsy or insufficient tumor content in the available specimen were common 
reasons for patient exclusion from molecular analysis while deteriorating performance status 
prohibited a number of patients from proceeding in the study. However, a number of somatic 
variants which triggered a pre-determined signal for molecular therapy were identified including KRAS wild type mutatio n status, HER2 amplifications, BRCA1 or 2 mutations or somatic variants 
in ATM1 or other rare variants attesting to the feasibility of this strategy. [
8] No clinical outcome 
data are currently available.  This precision medicine concept even now extends onto selecting 
patients with BRCA variants or ‘BRCA -like’ variant signatures or with immunogenic signatures 
based on large -scale gene expression profiling for immunotherapies like immune checkpoint

The vast majority of pancreatic cancers (up to ≥94%) harbor mutations of the KRAS gene, and there is ample preclinical evidence that KRAS mutations are a n essential driver of pancreas cancer 
development and progression, essential for the unique metabolomic and transcriptomic landscape 
of pancreatic cancers, involved in pancreatic cancer stem cell formation, as well as in mediation 
of resistance to chemo - and molecular therapy. [9-11
] That there is considerable heterogen eity 
within KRAS mutant pancreas cancers, with substantial implications for guiding therapy, has been

 shown in vitro in elegant synthetic lethality studies, and in correlative tissue studies defining 
classical and quasi -mesenchymal subtypes guiding respons e to gemcit abine or erlotinib 
therapy. [12, 13] 
KRAS mutations affecting codon 12 comprise of nearly all KRAS mutations in pancreas cancer. KRAS G12R mutations are  after KRAS G12D and G12V the 3
rd most common KRAS isoform 
mutations in pancreas cancer comprising of up to 20% of KRAS m utations in some studies. [14] 
Overall both, affected codons, namely codon 12, 13, and 61 of the KRAS oncogene, and nucleotide substitutions of affected codons are highly specific and differ between the three ‘KRAS cancers’ pancreas cancer, colon cancers, and NSCLC. 
Figure 1  shows distribution of KRAS mutational 
isoforms derived from large -scale genotyping efforts including NCIs TCGA initiative across 
pancreas, colon, and non-small cell lung cancer. KRAS G12R mutations (highlighted in orange, lower p anel) are highly unique for pancreas cancer as they are exceedingly rare, or non -existent, 
in other cancers (1% in thyroid cancers, <2% in NSCLC, <2% in colon cancers of all KRAS mutant 
cancers).

2.1.3 KRAS mutational isoforms and regulators of MAPK signaling  are a prognostic 
biomarker for outcome in pancreas cancer  
KRAS mutational status per see (KRAS wild type versus KRAS mutant) as well as KRAS 
mutational isoform status are associated with different clinical outcomes in pancreas cancer. [11, 
15] Figure 3  shows the improved outcome, including overall survival, of stage IV pancreas cancer 
patients with KRAS G12V mutations compared to G12D and G12R mutations measured in biopsy 
specimens, Figure 4  shows the improved overall survival of KRAS Q61 mutations to non- Q61 
mutations in surgical resection specimens of a recent large exomic sequencing study of >100 
pancreatic cancer specimens. [11, 15] These studies showed tha t patients affected by tumors 
without KRAS mutations have better outcomes compared to patients afflicted by pancreas cancers 
harboring KRAS mutations and that different Kras mutational isoforms are associated with 
different effector states of MAPK signalin g. These observations are affirmed by findings in our 
laboratory: using the SEER Pancreas Cancer Tissue Microarray (TMA) and a TMA with pancreas cancer biospecimens constructed from NIH patients, we identified the scaffolding kinase 
“connective tissue enhancer of KSR” (CNKSR1), a major regulator of MAPK pathway signaling  
- identified within a large RNAi kinome screen as a major mediator of resistance to MEK inhibition 
in the MEK -resistant cell line YAPC -, as a novel prognostic biomarker. Pancreas cancer patients 
with high CNKSR1 expression (measured as 2+ or 3+) versus patients with low CNKSR1 expression (0 or 1+) had significantly improved overall survival following resection of their 
tumors. Thus, KRAS mutational isoforms likely vary in their impact on pa ncreas cancer biology 
and pancreas cancer progression due to different mechanisms of action and signal transduction dependencies.

2.1.4 KRAS G12R mutation status predicts response to selumetinib inhibition in a large panel 
of pancreas cancer cell lines  
Figure 7  shows waterfall plots of response to selumetinib in a panel of 52 authenticated pancreatic 
cell lines as measured by activity area and IC50. KRAS mutation status is shown for each cell line, 
cell lines harboring KRAS G12R mutations are highlighted in red. To demonstrate a ‘class -effect’ 
and to exclude that observed profile is unique to selumetinib, cell lines were also treated with 
MEK162 (Novartis) and the ERK inhibitor VTX -11e yielding a sim ilar sensitivity profile (data 
not shown). Figure 7  shows the summary of comparisons of sensitivity profiles of KRAS G12R 
versus non-G12R pancreas cancer cell lines as scatter plots using activity area (measure of efficacy and potency, or 1-AUC, left) and IC50 (potency, right): pancreas cancer cell lines harboring KRAS G12R mutations are 3 – 10 times more sensitive than cell lines harboring other KRAS mutational 
isoforms. To validate these findings in an independent set of cell lines, the cell line encyclopedia 
panel from the Broad Institute was interrogated for cell lines with known RAS  mutation status and 
data on  treatment with selumetinib. [16
] All pancreas cancer cell lines  treated in the discovery panel 
were removed. Due to the paucity of cell lines with KRAS G12R mutations in non-PDAC histologies , the G12R group comprised of 4 cell lines (thyroid cancer, NSCLC). When compared 
to non-KRAS G12R mutant KRAS cell lines from a diverse group of different non-PDAC histologies, cell lines harboring KRAS G12R mutations were again more sensitive than non-KRAS G12R lines (
Figure 8 , right). [16] To confirm the validity of our act ivity area measurements in the 

Abbreviated Title : Ph II AZD6244 pancreatic ca  NCI Protocol #:  10050  
Version Date:  May 1 9, 2018  
20 
 pancreas cancer panel, similar scatter plots were derived from the Broad Institute pancreas cancer 
cell line panel treated with selumetinib. KRAS G12R harboring cell lines, like in our panel (92% 
overlap of used cell lines; only 3 KRAS G12R lines), were again the most sensitive subgroup (data 
not shown).  
These in vitro findings in PDAC are further affirmed by a recent study with the MEK inhibitor MEK162 in 29 pancreatic cancer lines, some of them also present in our larger panel: cell lines 
with the electrically charged amino acid substitution aspartic acid for glycin at codon 12 (KRAS G12D) were statistically significantly more sensitive compared to cell lines harboring KRAS 
codon mutations leading to the hydrophobic insertion of valine for g lycin (KRAS G12V) ( Figure 
9). While this panel only contained two KRAS G12R mutant cell lines (introducing an arginine 
(ARG) at codon 12), which precluded a statistical comparison, their median IC50 was equally low 
than the one of the KRAS  G12D -mutant cell lines ( Figure 9 ).[17
] These, and above finding s 
suggest that the electrically charged arginine or aspartate introduced by the G12R and G12D 
variant triggers unique pertubations in the interactions with RAS binding partners like other 
kinases or regulatory proteins like scaffolding proteins or phosphatases which govern select responses to small molecule inhibition. Signa l transduction pertubations unique to KRAS 
mutational isoforms have recently been shown in a detailed phosphoproteomic analysis of KRAS -
isogenic cell lines. [

a rea  capturing maximum response for each cell line (red bar, top), KRAS mutation status (mid, KRAS G12R mutations 
highlighted in red), and comparison to potency measurements (IC50, blue bars, bottom) are shown.  
 
Furthermore, data from isogenic SW48 colon cancer cell lines show that cells with a KRAS G12R 
allele are highly sensitive to selumetinib compared to SW48 cells with hemialle lic KRAS G12D 
mutations ( Figure 10 ).[19 ] In this colon cancer model, isogenic KRAS G12V mutations displa yed 
similar sensitivity to selumetinib as KRAS G12R mutations, and a detailed recent phosphoproteomic analysis of these isogenic SW48 cell lines has yielded unique signatures associated wit h individual KRAS mutations. [

In summary, irrespective of source pancreas cancer panel (Rudloff lab vs [16 ]), activity measure 
(activity area vs IC50), pancreas cancer vs non -pancreas cancer histology, or type of MEK 
inhibitor (selumetinib vs MEK162) KRAS G12R mutation status consistently identified most 
sensitive group of cell lines.

2.1.5 Decreased WNT and RhoGTPase signaling component expression in KRAS G12R -
mutant cells compared to KRAS non-G12R cells  
Extensive phospho -immunoblotting failed to identif y pathways selectively up - or downregulated 
in the KRAS G12R cell lines (data not shown). Pathways not altered in KRAS G12R compared to 
KRAS non -G12R lines include the MAPK pathway measured by phospho-RSK, ERK, and MEK, 
the PI3K -AKT pathway measured by pAKT, pS6, and p4E -BP1, as well as EGFR and HER3 
signaling. RAS activation measured by GTP loading did also not differ significantly between the

 isoforms. To probe into transcriptional differences between the KRAS isoforms, gene expression 
profiles of the thr ee cohorts (at least >6 cell lines per mutational  isoform) were compared. Figure 
11 shows supervised cluster analysis of 208 differentially expressed g enes (DEGs) between the 3 
groups. Using these 208 DEGs RNASeq data from TCGA Pancreas Cancer specimens showed weak separation on Principal Component Analysis suggesting DEG set is associated with KRAS isoform mutation status also in patient tissues  (Figure 12 ). Gene set enrichment analysis on DEGs 
identified components of WNT signaling, including the novel KRAS effector Yes - associated 
protein 1 (YAP1) shown to be able to bypass KRAS oncogene addiction in pancreas cancer, as well as RhoGTPase signaling (Table 1; adjusted p values by multiple comparisons are shown) to be reduced in KRAS G12R harboring pa ncreas cancer cell lines .[20, 21

These find ings were validated using  a novel technique made available by NCIs R as Program  to 
my laborat ory: siREN screening silences signaling nodes in cancer cell lines and assesses loss -of-
function on cell biology. A large siREN screen was carried out in >20 of our cell lines with the 
three different KRAS mutational isoforms , which  showed different signal  transduction 
dependencies in the KRAS G12R vs non KRAS G12R lines: KRAS G12R -harboring cell line s 
showed different  dependency  on RhoGTPase signaling, previously identified by compa rative gene 
expression analysis ( Figu re 13). Another vulnerability in KRAS G12D/V and not G12R cells 
includes regulation of metabolism, in particular  glycolysis and hexokinase  metabolism, with 
KRAS G12R able to tolerate loss of these metabolic pathways.

response testing; x -axis) correlates with redundancy of metabolic programs (baseline z score; siREN screen; y -a xis);  
Pearson’s coefficient test).  
Correlating drug response with lethality upon loss -of-function of 48 individual signaling hubs  
during siREN screening revealed, among others, strong correlations between dependency on 
glycolytic function and resistance to MEK inhibition in non-KRAS G12R cell lines and 
redundancy of glycolysis and sensitivity upon MAPK inhibition ( Figure 13). Indeed, baseline 
metabolic profiling of KRAS G12R vs non-G12R cell lines using the XF Extracellular Flux 
Analyzer  (SeaHorse XF® Analyzer) revealed greater glycolytic plasticity upon glycolytic stress 
in KRAS G1R vs non-KRAS G12R cells ( Figure 14) as well as increased glucose uptake and 
lactate production (data not shown). Upon MAPK inhibition, KRAS G12R cell lines do develop metabolic survival dependencies, in particular dependencies on glutamine metabolism ( Figure 
14). These findings, overall, suggest that non-KRAS G12R cell lines derive survival cues from 
metabolic programs including glycolysis, small GTPase signaling, and others whereas cells with 
KRAS G12R isoform mutations, to a larger degree, depend on intact MAPK pathway signal 
transduction cues ( Figure 14).

2.1.6 Patient-derived xenotransplants from human pancreatic tumors harboring KRAS G12R 
mutations are selectively sensitive to MEK inhibition with selume tinib (AZD6244)  
PDX models derived from human cancers have distinct advantages over other advanced preclinical model like the more commonly used xenotransplantation of human cancer cell lines or genetically 
engineered mouse models (GEMM) of cancer. These i nclude, among others, the inherent clonal 
heterogeneity of human cancers as well as the inclusion of tumor -educated stroma into the model, 
both major determining factors of cancer biology and drug response. Figure 15 shows selective 
reduction of tumor growth in a PDX model of pancreas cancer harboring a KRAS G12R mutation (left) compared to KRAS G12D mutation shown on the right. Analysis of downstream effe ctor 
pathways in PDX models both at baseline and after treatment with selumetinib by reverse phase 
protein microarray (RPMA) shows increased induction of the cell cycle inhibitor p27kip in the KRAS G12R model compared to the KRAS G12D tumors (Figure 16). ().

2.1.7 How does this study impact future t rials/practice of molecular therapy in pancreas cancer  
Similar to tram etinib in BRAF -mutant metastatic cutaneous melanoma or selumetinib in ongoing 
trials of ocular melanoma, KRAS -mutant thyroid cancers, or selumetinib in combination with 
chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer, the proposed study aims to establish a role for this 
class of agents in pancreas cancer as well as a role for a precision medicine approach guided by different KRAS -mutational isoforms both in pancreas cancers, and possibly other  KRAS -driven 
cancers . For example, it would support a general more differentiated approach to KRAS -driven 
cancers selecting patients by KRAS mutational isoform status. In this regard, it would support signals from a retrospective pooled analysis of randomi zed trials in colorectal cancer or a 
prospective randomized phase II study in non-small cell lung cancer. In a pooled retrospective 
analysis of 579 chemotherapy -refractory colorectal cancer patients randomized in the clinical trials 
NCIC CTG/AGITG CO.17, BOND, MABEL, EMR202600, EVEREST, or SALVAGE to the addition of the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab, De Rook and colleagues examined the impact of KRAS mutation status, including isoforms affected KRAS codon 12 versus 13, on overall survival and 
response to cetuxim ab. Figure 17 shows improvement in OS in patients randomized to receive 
cetuximab in the KRAS G13 but not in the more common KRAS G12D group. Response to 
cetuximab in colorectal cancer patients harboring KRAS G13 mutations was similar to response 
in KRAS wild type patients, the currently used biomarker to select patients for anti-EGFR therapy 
in stage IV disease .

Figure 17. Retrospective correlative tissue analysis of RCTs NCIC CTG and AGITG  CO.17 Tria l in colorectal 
cancer patients randomized to anti -EGFR treatment with cetuximab vs supportive care shows improved outcome in 
KRAS G13 -mutant tumors  similar to KRAS wild type cancers (from DeRook W, 2010, JAMA).  
Similarly , to the above study, the impact of KRAS codon G12 isoform mutation status on res ponse 
to MEK inhibition has  been studied retrospectively in a large randomized phase II study of KRAS -
mutant non-small cell lung cancer patients randomized to second line docetaxol vs  docetaxol plus 
selumetinib. There was a trend, statistically significant for progression -free survival and objective 
response rates, towards improved clinical outcome in KRAS  G12C and G12V -mutant lung cancer 
patients  which was not observed in lung cancer patients harboring other KRA S mutational 
isoforms like KRAS G12A. Figure 18 shows impact of the addition of selumetinib to docetaxol  
on overall survival and progression -free survival in chemotherapy-refractory lung cancer patients 
stratified by KRAS isoform mutation status .

Selumetinib has been compared in a randomized phase II study in unselected pancreas cancer to 
the 2nd-line chemotherapy agent capecitabine and shown not to have a ny advantage over 
capecitabine. [22] Similar to the Canadian NCIC CTG PA.3 phase III study with erlotinib these 
had been unselected patients and patients which had received at least gemcitabine and often 
additional chemotherapy therapy before. Furthermore, in the above randomized phase II clinical 
trial of advanced pancreas cancer patients (n=37 selumetinib; n=32 capecitabine ) overall survival 
(OS) was chosen as primary endpoint with no capture of response rates. [22] No retrospective 
genotyping on tissues was performed.  
The weak positive signal with the anti-EGFR inhibitor in the NCIC CTG PA.3 trial, the early data with se lumetinib in NSCLC patients, [23
] our preclinical studies as well preclinical studies from 
other investigators now suggest a previously underappreciated heterogeneity of KRAS mutational isoform signaling which drives cancer biology and might harbor important information for clinical decision making. Thus, this study, in case positive, would 
(1) add a possibly novel treatment option in a diseas e void of effective therapies and patients 
desperate for treatments,  
(2) support enhanced efforts into KRAS mutational isoform -directed molecular therapy, both 
in pancreas and other cancers with frequent KRAS mutations. Considering the high 
prevalence of KRAS  mutations in common cancers like NSCLC, colon, thyroid, or triple 

Abbreviated Title : Ph II AZD6244 pancreatic ca  NCI Protocol #:  10050

 negative breast cancer, a positive finding might trigger a number of studies on KRAS -
mutatio nal genotype directed therapies, [14] 
(3) support future molecula r therapy studies in pancreas cancer attempting to exploit less 
common low -frequency somatic mutations in this disease like BRAF (3%; vemurafenib), 
PI3KCA (1%; GDC -0941, BKM120), CDK4 (4%; PD -0332991), or BRCA gene family 
mutations (3%; mitomycin -C, olapar ib).[11]  
2.2 CTEP IND Agent  
2.2.1 AZD6244 (selumeti nib) 
AZD6244 (ARRY -142886; selumetinib) is a potent, selective, orally (PO)  available, and non-ATP 
competitive small molecule inhibitor of the mitogen -activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase, 
MEK1/2 ( AZD62 44 Investigator's Brochure, Edition #15 (March 30, 2015). [24]  AZD6244 
inhibits the activ ity of purified MEK by 50% at 10-14 nmol/L (IC 50), and is inactive or only 
minimally active at 10  mcmol/L against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), ERB B2, p38α, 
ERK2, and MAPKK 6 kinases.  AZD6244 is metabolized to biologically active N -desmethyl 
AZD6244, which is approximately 3- to 5-fold more active than the parent compound.   
The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway plays a central role in the regulation of many cellular 
processes including proliferation, survival, differentiation, apoptosis, m otility, and 
metabolism .[25, 26]  This pathway is one of the most important and best understood MAP kinase 
signal transduction pathways, activated by a diverse group of extracellular signals including 
integrins, growth factor receptors ( i.e., EGFR, platelet-derived growth factor receptor [PDGFR ], 
and insulin-like growth fac tor-1 receptor), and cytokines .  Activated RAS triggers the 
phosphorylation and activation of RAF kinase, which then phosphorylates MEK1 and MEK2 on 
two s erine residues . Activated MEK phosphorylates its only known substrates, ERK1 and ERK2.  
Phosphorylated ERK (pERK) dimerizes and translocat es to the nucleus where it is involved in 
several important cellular functions, including cell proliferation. [27] 
Overex pression of growth factors or growth factor receptors involved in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK 
pathway and activating genetic mutations of the signaling proteins may lead to uncontrolled 
proliferation and tumor formation.  For example, RAS  genes are the most frequently mutated 
oncogenes detected in human tumors ).  RAS proteins are guanine nucleotide binding proteins that 
activate RAF proteins when bound to GTP.  Cancer -associated mutations in RAS proteins stabilize 
the GTP -bound form of RAS, thereby providing a cons titutive signal downstream in the cascade.  
In addition to being found in almost all pancreatic adenocarcinomas, RAS  mutations are found in 
~40% of colorectal carcinomas (CRC), 20 -25% of lung adenocarcinomas, and also in some breast 
or ovarian cancers.  BRAF mutations have also been observed in many human cancers, particularly 
melanoma (30 -60%), thyroid cancer (30-50%), CRC (5 -20%), and ovarian cancer (~30%) .[24, 26] 
These mutations in BRAF usually involve gain-of -function substitutions that render the kinases 
constitutively active.  Also, studies of primary tumor samples and cell lines have shown 
constitutive activation or overactivation of the MAP kinase pathways in cancers of the pancreas, 
colon, lung, ovary, bilia ry tract, and kidney. [28] Therefore, agents targeting the

 Efficacy  
In vitro  studies have shown that AZD6244 is a potent and selective inhibitor of MEK with IC 50 of 
10-14 nM (AZD62 44 Investigator's Brochure, Edition #15 (March 30, 2015). Significant 
biochemical activity has not been detected when tested at 10 mcmol/L against a diverse panel of 
>300 other molecules, including enzymes, receptors, kinases, transporters, and ion channels.  The 
effects of AZD6244 on ERK phosphorylation and cell viability were determined in a panel of cell 
lines with known RAF and RAS mutant status.  AZD6244 inhibited ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation with IC
50 0.0018-0.0408  mcmol/L.  In cell viability assays, IC 50 values ranged 
from <10 nM to >10 μM and most of the cell lines that w ere sensitive to selumetinib contained 
either a BRAF or RAS gene mutation.  Two metabolites of AZD6244 (N -desmethyl AZD6244 
and an amide AZD6244) have been identified.  The N -desmethyl metabolite was found to be 3 -to 
5-fold more potent inhibitor than the parent compound in cellular ERK phosphorylation and cell 
viability inhibition assays.  In contrast, the AZD6244 amide metabolite was up to 50-fold less 
active than AZD6244 and therefore is unlikely to significantly contribute to biological activity of 
AZD62 44.  In tumor cell viability inhibition assays, N -desmethyl metabolite was ≥5 -fold more 
potent than AZD6244 in inhibiting cell viability.   
Significant suppression of tumor growth in response to AZD6244 treatment was observed in 
several xenograft mouse models derived from a range of tumor types including melanoma, breast, 
pancreatic, lung, colon, and hepatocellular carcinomas. [29-32] In papillary thyroid cancer models, 
AZD6244 effectively inhibited tumor growth, both in vitro  and in vivo , particularly in tumor cells 
carrying activating BRAF gene mutations .[33] In the Calu -6 lung cancer xenograft model, 
AZD6244 suppressed tumor growth at doses of 10, 25, or 100 mg/kg given twice daily (BID), and the minimal effective dose was identified as 0.75 mg/kg administered BID. [
30]  In this model, 
MEK activity was inhibited as assessed by determination of pERK levels in tumor.   Studies using 
human CRC xenograft models demonstrated that AZD6244 inhibited tumor growth by inhibition 
of cell proliferation in SW620 model and by induction of apoptosis in Colo205 model.   In vivo  
studies with mutant KRAS positive ( KRAS+) human cancer x enografts have demonstrated the 
potential for using AZD 6244 in combination with a number of cytotoxic and targeted agents, 
including docetaxel, irinotecan, gemcitabine, pemetrexed, gefitinib, cediranib, rapamycin, 
cisplatin, and temozolomide  (AZD62 44 Inves tigator's Brochure, Edition #15 (March 30, 2015).  
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Studies  
Two oral formulations of AZD6244 have been tested in preclinical pharmacology studies:  the 
original mix -and-drink formulation (AZD6244 free -base), and the AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate salt 
(capsule) formulation (AZD6244 Hyd-Sulfate) (AZD62 44 Investigator's Brochure, Edition #15 
(March 30, 2015). The former requires reconstitution of the AZD6244 free -base crystalline powder 
in the 25% (w/v) Aqueous Captisol® (sulfobutyl ether β -cyclodextrin) (SBE -CD) solution.  While 
systemic exposure was demonstrated in the rat and monkey studies with AZD6244 free -base, the 
exposure was not dose -proportional; bioavailability was decreasing with increasing dose.  This is 
likely  a reflection of dose -limited absorption due to limited solubility  of AZD6244 free -base.   
However, AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate  produced approximately proportion al exposure s with dose 
in the mouse and monkey, and allowed hi gher exposures than AZD6244 free -base .  There was 
no/minimal accumulation of AZD6244, whether dosed with AZD6244 free -base or AZD6244 
hydrogen sulfate on multiple dosing in the mouse, rat, or monkey.  N -desmethyl metabolite was 
not detectable in rat and at only trace levels in the monkey, but  was produced in mouse at 
Abbreviated Title : Ph II AZD6244 pancreatic ca  NCI Protocol #:  10050  
Version Date:  May 1 9, 2018  
32 
 circulating levels around 2-12% of parent compound.  Studies in rats and mice indicate that 
AZD6244 is widely distributed, although concentrations were generally lower in tissue than blood.  
High levels of protein binding (93.7% -99.7%) were observed in all preclinical species tested and 
in humans (98.4%).   There was no evidence of AZD6244 -related material binding to melanin and 
minimal penetration into the central nervous system (CNS).   
AZD6244 is metabolized in human hepatocytes by cytochrome P450 (CYP enzymes) 1A2, 2C19 
and 3A4, with CYP1A2 being the enzyme primarily responsible for the formation of the N -
desmethyl metabolite.  Glucuronidation appears to be a significant clearance mechanism for 
AZD6244 and the N -desmethyl metabol ite.  It is a weak in ducer  of CYP 3A, 1A, and 2C9 .  
AZD6244 does not inhibit CYP 1A2, 2C8, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4.  It was a weak  inhibitor of 
CYP2C9 (IC 50 44.7 mcM).  N-desmethyl AZD6244 does not inhibit CYP 2A6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 
2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, but is a wea k inhibitor of 1A2 (IC 50 of 18.9 mcM).  In the rat, mouse, and 
monkey, fecal excretion was the predominant route after oral and intravenous dosing.  
Toxicologic Studies  
Toxicity of AZD6244 was evaluated in the acute dos ing (one or two doses on a single day) and 
continuous daily dosing studies (for a 1 month and 6 months) in Sprague -Dawley rats and 
cynomolgus monkeys (AZD62 44 Investigator's Brochure, Edition #15 (March 30, 2015). The 
repeat -dose study in rats indicated that the agent was well tolerated but produced soft stools and 
gastrointestinal mucosal mineralization associated with increased serum phosphorus and 
decreased albumin.  Tissue mineralisation was not apparent in cynomolgus monkeys when dosed 
for up to 1 month w ith AZD6244 free -base or for up to 6 months with AZD6244 hydrogen 
sulfate.  However, mineralization was seen in multiple tissues (cornea, kidney, liver, 
myocardium, skeletal muscle, and glandular stomach) in mice dosed with AZD6244 hydrogen 
sulfate for up to 1 month, and in the liver of a small number of mice dosed up to 6 months.   
Twice daily (BID) oral dosing with AZD6244 free -base for 1 month in monkeys produced 
diarrhea, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance, in some animals associated with renal toxi city.  
Dosing with AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate (0.5, 1.5, and 4 mg/kg BID) for up to 6 months in 
monkeys was also associated with fluid and/or red-colored feces, but with no notable 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract or renal pathology.  
AZD6244 and its N -desmethyl m etabolite showed no evidence of mutagenic potential, but 
AZD6244 produced an increase in micronucleated immature erythrocytes in mice, predominantly 
via an aneugenic mode of action.  AZD6244 showed enhanced cytotoxicity in the presence of 
ultraviolet (UV) light.  Reproductive toxicology data in mice indicate that AZD6244 can have 
adverse effects on embryofetal development and survival at dose levels that were not toxic to 
mothers.  
In summary, preclinical studies demonstrated that AZD6244 exposures can be significantly enhanced by using AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate, compared to AZD6244 free -base.  In 6-month 
toxicology studies, AZD6244 exposures , expressed as area under the concentration -time curve 
from time 0 h to 12 h (AUC
0-12), achieved with AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate at high dose levels (4 
mg/kg BID in monkeys and 20 mg/kg BID in mice) were approximately 3 -fold and 15 -fold higher 
in primates and mice, respectively, when compared with th ose achieved in man at 75 mg BID 
AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate.  At the NOAEL of 1.5 mg/kg BID from 1 -month and 6-month studies 
in primates, exposures were generally similar to those seen in man after dosing at 75 mg BID 
AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate.  Exposure achi eved in the 6-month mouse study at the low dose level 
Abbreviated Title : Ph II AZD6244 pancreatic ca  NCI Protocol #:  10050  
Version Date:  May 1 9, 2018  
33 
 of 1 mg/kg BID was slightly below that seen to date in man after dosing with AZD6244 hydrog en 
sulfate (75 mg BID).  Preclinical pharmacology studies suggest an acceptable safety profile for 
administerin g AZD6244 free -base or AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate to cancer patients.  
 
Clinical Experience  
Pharmacokinetics  
AZD6244 plasma PK parameters of AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate were similar after single and 
multiple dosing, suggesting a minimal accumulation over time a fter BID dosing (AZD62 44 
Investigator's Brochure, Edition #15 (March 30, 2015).   The AZD6244 exposure parameters, i.e.,  
the maximum plasma concentration (C max) and the AUC were approximately dose -proportional 
across the 25 - to 100-mg BID dose range after single (day 1) or multiple dosing studied on days 
1, 8, 15, and 22.  T he geometric mean values of exposure parameters were:  C max=369-1483 ng/mL 
and AUC 0-12=1361-7055 ng∙h/mL on day 1, and C max=458-1365 ng/mL and AUC 0-12=1515- 4758 
ng∙h/mL on day 8.  AZD6244 was absorbed relatively quickly across all dose levels, with a median 
time-to-reach C max (tmax) of 1.5 hours.  Following the peak, AZD6244 concentration declined 
multi-exponentially with a mean terminal elimination half -life (t 1/2) ranging from 5 to 7 hours, 
which was consistent across dose levels.  The apparent volume of distribution at steady state 
(Vss/F) and apparent clearance (CL/F) also remained largely consistent across the dose range, with 
mean values ranging from 87 to 126 L and 12 to 19 L/h, respectively.  The plasma PK profile of  
the AZD6244 active metabolite, N -desmethyl AZD6244, was similar to that of AZD6244, 
although exposure was much lower, achieving C max and AUC values generally <15% of the parent 
compound, in each patient.  The m edian t max was approximately 1.5 hours and t 1/2 ranged from 9-
13 hours.  The AZD6244 amide metabolite showed increased exposure on multiple dosing 
indicating some accumulation.  Given the 3-to 5 -fold greater potency of the N -desmethyl 
metabolite compared t o AZD6244 shown by the in vitro  cell-based ERK phosphorylation assay, 
the N -desmethyl AZD6244 is likely to contribute to pharmacodynamic effects.  In contrast, 
AZD6244 amide, which was approximately 40- to 50 -fold less active than AZD6244 in this assay, 
is unlikely to contribute significantly to AZD6244 biological activity.  Nevertheless, both 
metabolites will be measured in all future AstraZeneca -sponsored clinical studies of AZD6244 
hydrogen sulfate.  
The capsule formulation significantly improved oral bioavailability compared the free-base 
formulation, although large inter -patient variability was noted.  The estimated oral bioavailability 
of capsule relative to the free-base suspension based on a dose -normalized AUC 0-24 was 263% 
(90% confidence interval [C I]=214% -322%).  The geometric mean values of exposure s obtained 
for AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 75 mg BID (AUC 0-
24=6335 and 5448 ng∙h/mL on day 1 and 8, respectively, and C max=1207 and 1439 ng/mL on day 
1 and 8, respecti vely) were  statistically significantly higher than those obtained at the MTD of 
AZD6244 free -base (100 mg BID);  the relative estimated exposures by hydrogen sulfate  vs.  f ree-
base were  197% (90% CI=161 to 242%) for AUC 0–24 and 252% (90% CI=182 to 348%) for Cmax. 
A food effect study involving administration of AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate to patients with 
advanced solid malignancies under fasting conditions and with a high-fat meal indicated a 
statistically significant effect of food on the exposure of AZD6244.  Geometric mean C max and 
AUC values were reduced by approximately 62% and 19%, respectively, under fed conditions.

Version Date:  May 1 9, 2018  
34 
 Therefore,  for further clinical studies , it is recommended that AZD6244 be taken on an empty 
stomach ( i.e., no food other than water can be taken) at least 2 hours after a meal and 1 hour before 
the next meal.   AZD6244 capsule should be taken with water.    
At a population level, plasma exposure of AZD6244 (C max and AUC) appeared to be increased in 
healthy volunteers of Asian descent by approximately 1.5 - to 2-fold, in non-Japanese Asians and 
Japanese Asians, respectively, compared with Western healthy volunteers.  However, the 
AZD6244 PK was highly variable and there was overlap in the range of exposure experie nced by 
Asian and Western subjects.  
There is no evidence of PK interactions between docetaxel, dacarbazine, temsirolimus, or erlotinib and AZD6244.  
Efficacy   
Four  randomized phase 2 monotherapy studies comparing efficacy of AZD6244 free -base 
formulation (100mg BID) to standard chemotherapy regimens in patients with solid tumors 
(melanoma, pancreatic cancer, CRC, and NSCLC) did not demonstrate superior efficacy of AZD6244 over standard chemotherapy agents (AZD62 44 Investigator's Brochure, Edition #15 
(March 30, 2015) .  Several objective responses were observed in melanoma patients with mutant 
BRAF tumors and in patients with mutant KRAS NSCLC.  
Although statistical significance in overall survival (OS) was not achie ved, a statistically 
significant improvement was seen in progression-free survival (PFS) for AZD6244 in combination 
with docetaxel in patients with mutant KRAS NSCLC ( P=0.014) [34
] and for AZD6244 in 
combination with dacarbazine in patients with mutant BRAF cutaneous melanoma ( P=0.021), [35] 
when compared to the respective chemotherapy/placebo groups.  Clinical activity of AZD6244 
hydrogen sulfate monotherapy was demonstrated in uveal melanoma. [36] 
Safety  
The tolerability profile of AZD6244 free -base at 100 mg BID was similar to that of AZD6 244 
hydrogen sulfate at 75 mg BI D (AZD62 44 Investigator's Brochure,  Edition #15 (March 30, 2015). 
The most common AEs associated with AZD6244 are acneiform rash, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting , 
peripheral edema, and fatigue.  Stomatitis, dry skin, and pyrexia have also been  commonly 
reported in the AZD6244 studies. Dose escalation of selumetinib was limited mainly by the 
occurrence of rash and diarrh ea. 
Events consistent with central serous retinopathy/retinal pigment epithelial detachment have been 
reported in a small number of patients receiving treatment with AZD6244, generally in 
combination with other novel targeted anticancer agents.  
Mild (generally grade 1) elevations in serum liver transaminases have been recorded within the first week of starting treatm ent with AZD6244 and levels tend not to increase further beyond the 
first month of continued dosing.  Mild increases in serum phosphate and in calcium phosphate product have been reported.   
Dyspnea and exertional dyspnea have been reported in patients rec eiving AZD6244.  The majority 
of these events have occurred in patients with lung or pleural disease due to their underlying malignancy. There have been reports of pneumonitis -type events, including symptoms of shortness 
of breath, fatigue, cough and/or fe ver, in a small number of patients receiving AZD6244, but 
Abbreviated Title : Ph II AZD6244 pancreatic ca  NCI Protocol #:  10050  
Version Date:  May 1 9, 2018  
35 
 pneumonitis -AZD6244 association has not been established.  Studies of AZD6244 should include 
guidance for the management and investigation of new or worsening dyspnea or symptoms of 
pneumonitis -type  events that are not attributed to the patient’s underlying cancer.  
Increases in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, sometimes exceeding the threshold for therapeutic intervention, have been observed in studies with AZD6244.  Asymptomatic reductions in l eft 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below 55% have been observed in a small number of patients during AZD6244 treatment and evidence of reversibility while on continuous dosing was demonstrated in some patients.  Studies of AZD6244 should include baseline and symptom -
triggered echocardiography assessments and guidance for the management and investigation of 
decreases of LVEF.  Review of electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters has shown no evidence of 
QT interval corrected according to Fridericia’s formul a (QTcF) prolongation during treatment with 
AZD6244.   
Increased creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels have been reported in a small number of patients with advanced cancer receiving AZD6244 .  A relationship between selumetinib  and increased CK 
levels has not  been established.  
2.3 Rationale  
Patients with advanced pancreas cancer have few available treatment options and an overall poor 
prognosis. Pre -clinical evidence, both in a large panel of cell lines and in patient -derived 
xenotransplantation models, suggests that selumetinib (AZD6244) has  activity against pancreas 
cancers harboring KRAS G12R mutations.  
This study tests the hypothesis  
(1) if patients with advanced pancreas cancer with a unique KRAS mutational isoform respond 
to the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244) and  
(2) if genetic or protein  expression information derived from treated patients distinguishes 
patients responding to the drug from patients progressing under treatment  
2.4 Correlative Studies Background  
The rationale for the chosen correlative tissue is derived from the observation tha t (1) additional 
inherent somatic gene perturbations, either within the targeted signal transduction pathway or 
affecting other pro -survival cell functions, frequently mediate resistance to targeted agents. 
Examples of relevance to the MEK inhibition in KR AS G12R mutant pancreas cancer are for 
example concomitant mutations of the PI3K -AKT -mTOR pathway or gene amplifications in the 
cyclin  or cyclin kinase regulating genes. The immediately available information on variant status 
in 50 additional common known cancer genes as part of the applied gene panel allows immediate 
correlation and possible identification of common genetic mechanisms of resistance. The 
correlation of CNKSR1 expression status, measured by IHC, with response to selumetinib is a 
direct trans lation of our laboratory efforts; we have shown that CNKSR1, a scaffolding kinase 
and regulator of MAPK kinase signaling, mediates in preclinical models resistance to MAPK 
pathway inhibition.  Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis is capable of accurately 
determining  tumor progression, prognosis, and assisting in targeted therapy development via 
prediction of response when applied prospectively in later studies.

37 
 3.1.10  The effects of AZD6244 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic 
dose are unknown. For this reason,  women of child -bearing potential must agree to use 
adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to 
study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 4 weeks aft er dosing with 
AZD6244 ceases. Women of c hild-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test 
within 14 days prior to study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she 
is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, the patient should 
inform her treating physician immediately. Please note that the AZD6244 manufacturer 
recommends that adequate contraception for male patients should be used for 1 2 weeks 
post-last dose due to sperm life cycle.  
Note: Selumetinib  is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or 
abortifacient effects.  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in 
nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with selumetinib, breastfeeding should be  discontinued if the mother is treated with selumetinib.   
3.1.11  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document  or

make the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the interpretation of adverse 
events  
3.2.6 Patients who are  receiving any other investigational agents.  
3.2.7 Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.   
No additional workup is needed to exclude brain metastases if the patient is asymptomatic or has no history of brain metastases.

3.2.13  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the 
potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with AZD6244.  HIV -positive patients not on 
antiviral therapy with undetectable viral loads and CD4 counts >300, and after 
confirmation of eligibility after discussing with the Study chair are eligible . 
3.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
NIH policy requires that women and members of minority groups and their subpopulations be 
included in all NIH -supported biomedical and behavioral research projects involving NIH -defined 
clinical research unless a clear and compelling rationale and justification establishes to the 
satisfaction of the funding  Institute & Center  (IC) Director that inclusion is inappropriate with 
respect to the health of the subjects or the purpose of the research.  Exclusion under other 
circumstances must be designated by the Director, NIH, upon the recommendation of an IC 
Director based on a comp elling rationale and justification.  Cost is not an acceptable reason for 
exclusion except when the study would duplicate data from other sources.  Women of childbearing 
potential should not be routinely excluded from participation in clinical research.  Please see 
http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/phs398/phs398.pdf . 
4 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES  
4.1 Investigator and Research Associate Registration with CTEP  
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations require IND sponsors to select qualified 
investigators.  NCI policy requires all persons participating in any NCI -sponsored clinical trial to 
register and renew  their registration annually.  To register, all individuals must obtain a CTEP 
Identity and Access Management (IAM) account ( https://ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/iam ).  In addition, 
persons with a registration type of Investigator (IVR), Non -Physician Investigator (NPIVR), or 
Associate Plus (AP) (i.e., clinical site staff requiring write access to OPEN or RAVE or acting as 
a primary site contact) must complete their annual registration using CTEP’s web -based 
Registra tion and Credential Repository (RCR) ( https://ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/rcr ).  Documentation 
requirements per registration type are outlined in the table below.

4.2 Site Registration  
This study is supported by the NCI Cancer Trials Support Unit (CTSU).  
Each investigator or group of investigators at a clinical site must obtain IRB approval for this 
protocol and submit IRB approval and supporting documentation to the CTSU Regulatory Office 
before they can be approved to enroll patients.  Assignment of site  registration status in the CTSU 
Regulatory Support System (RSS) uses extensive data to make a determination of whether a site 
has fulfilled all regulatory criteria including but not limited to the following:  
• An active Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) number  
• An active roster affiliation with the Lead Network or a participating organization  
• A valid IRB approval  
• Compliance with all protocol specific requirements . 
In addition, the site -protocol Principal Investigator (PI) must meet the following criteria: 
• Active registration status  
Abbreviated Title : Ph II AZD6244 pancreatic ca  NCI Protocol #:  10050  
Version Date:  May 1 9, 2018  
41 
 • The IRB number of the site IRB of record listed on their Form FDA 1572 
• An active status on a participating roster at the registering site  
. 
Sites participating on the NCI CIRB initiative that are approved by the CIRB for this study are not 
required to submit IRB approval documentation to the CTSU Regulatory Office. For sites using 
the CIRB, IRB approval information is received from the CIRB and applied to the RSS in an automated process.  Signatory Institutions must submit a Study Specif ic Worksheet for Local 
Context (SSW) to the CIRB via IRBManager to indicate their intent to open the study locally.  The 
CIRB’s approval of the SSW is then communicated to the CTSU Regulatory Office.  In order for 
the SSW approval to be processed, the Signatory Institution must inform the CTSU which CIRB -
approved institutions aligned with the Signatory Institution are participating in the study.  
4.2.1 Downloading Regulatory Documents

Help Desk at 1 -888-823-5923 or ctsucontact@westat.com .  
4.4 General Guidelines  
Following registration, patients should begin protocol  KRAS G12R mutation testing  within 5 
days. Issues that would cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Principal 
Investigator.  If a patient does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the patient’s 
Abbreviated Title : Ph II AZD6244 pancreatic ca  NCI Protocol #:  10050  
Version Date:  May 1 9, 2018  
44 
 registration on the study may be canceled.  The Study Coordinator should be notified of 
cancellations as soon as possible.  
5 TREATMENT PLAN  
Patients will be screened for the presence of KRAS gene mutations in their tumor and only patients who harbor KRAS G12R mutations will continue onto the treatment phase of the study.   Please 
see section 10 for screening procedures.  
Selumetinib (AZD6244) will be administered as an oral dose of  selumetinib sulfate  75 mg twice 
daily (in the m orning and evening) taken two hours after  a meal  and one hour before the next meal .  
Selumetinib will be given continuously; one cycle equals 28 +/- 2 days.   
Up to 24 evaluable patients (allowing for a staged accrual of initially 7 patients who will receive 
selumetinib and are evaluable after the 1st cycle) will be treated over 2 years and the trial will be 
completed over 2( -4) years, allowing for completion of follow -up. 
The pri mary objective of the trial will be to determine whether selumetinib (AZD6244) 
monotherapy in advanced pancreas cancer patients harboring KRAS G12R mutations is able to be associated with a response rate (PR +CR) that can rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in favor of an improved 
response rate of 30% (p1=0.30).

 5.1 Agent Administration 
Treatment will be administered on an  outpatient basis .  Reported adverse events and potential 
risks are described in Section 7 .  Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 6 .  No 
investigational or commercial agents or therapies other than those described below may be 
administered with the intent to treat the patient's malignancy.  
5.1.1 AZD6244 Hydrogen Sulfate Administration  
All new NCI -sponsored trials with AZD6244 will use the hydrogen sulfate salt (capsule) 
formulation.  Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.  Reported adverse events 
(AEs) and potential risks are describ ed in Section 7 .  Appropriate dose modifications for 
AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate are described in Section 6 .  No investigational or commercial agents 
or therapies ot her than those described below may be administered with the intent to treat the 
patient’s malignancy.  
5.1.1.1  AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate will  be administered at a dose of 75  mg orally twice a day , 
approximately 12 hours apart.  For the evaluation purposes , a cycle w ill be defined as 
28 +/- 2 days.  Detailed instructions for storage and handling are provided in Section 8  
(Pharmaceutical Information) of the protocol.  
• Patients will be provided with a Medication Diary for AZD6244 ( Appendix 
D), instructed in its use, and asked to bring the diary with them to each 
appointment.  A new copy of the Medication Diary will be given to patients 
whose dose is reduced due to adverse events ( AEs). 
• AZD6244 capsules should be swallowed whole  with a glassful of water  twice 
a day , approximately 12 h apart,  on an empty stomac h – no food or drink 
other than water for 2 hrs  prior to dosing and 1 h after dosing (i.e ., AZD6244 
should be taken at least 2 h after a meal  and 1 h before the next meal ). 
5.1.1.2  Follow up for certain AEs should be performed to better characterize the effects of 
AZD6244 therapy:  
• Patients experiencing edema  should have cardiac ejection fraction (EF) 
measurements, serum chemistry (including electrolytes and albumin), and 
routine uri nalysis.  
• Patients with symptoms consistent with cardiac impairment ( e.g., congestive 
cardiac failure, edema, or dyspnea) should have EF measurements (MUGA 
scan or echocardiography) at the time of the event as well as other routine 
investigations.  Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from 
baseline (if known) m ay be investigated according to the algorithm described 
in Appendix E. 
• Respiratory  events (pulmonary edema) should be followed up with an 
electrocardio gram, EF measurement, and chest X -ray.  All new dyspnea AEs 
or worsening of pre -existing dyspnea AEs should be followed according to the 
dyspnea management algorithm ( Appendix F).  
Abbreviated Title : Ph II AZD6244 pancreatic ca  NCI Protocol #:  10050  
Version Date:  May 1 9, 2018  
46 
 • Oxygen saturation will be measured at baseline and again following any 
respiratory event . 
• Patients experiencing visual disturbances  should undergo a complete 
ophthalmologic examination, including a slit lamp examination.  
5.2 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
• Because there is the  potential for drug -drug interaction through the cytochrome P450 
enzyme system  (CYP), the case report form (CRF) must capture the concurrent use of all 
other drugs, over -the-counter medications, or alternative therapies.  The Principal 
Investigator should be alerted if the patient is taking any agent known to affect or with the potential for drug interactions.  The enzymes in question are CYP 1A2/3, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4/5, and UGT1A1.   AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate (selumetinib) is metabolized by these 
enzymes and may be affected by other drugs that inhibit or induce these enzymes.  The 
proteins in question are P -gp and BCRP . AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate (selumetinib) is a 
substrate of BCRP and P -gp transporters and may be affected by other drugs that inhibit 
or induce these transporters. The study team should check a frequently-updated medical reference for a list of drugs to avoid or minimize use of.  Appendix C (Patient Drug 
Information Handout and Wallet Card) should be provided to patients and their caregivers.  
• The patient’s smoking history should be documented in the CRF, including the number of  
packs smoked/day (if a smoker).  
• Diarrhea can generally be controlled with the following regimen:  loperamide (4 mg orally 
[PO]) at onset of symptoms, followed by 2 mg loperamide every 2 hours while awake (or 4 
mg PO every 4 hours while sleeping) up to a m aximum of 16 mg loperamide per day.  
• The nausea and vomiting that may occur with AZD6244 administration can generally be 
managed through the use of appropriate simple supportive measures ( e.g., 
prochlorperazine).  To date, 5 HT
3 antagonists have not been routinely required.  
• Patients should avoid excessive sun exposure and use adequate sunscreen protection if 
sun exposure is anticipated.  
• Because AZD6244 capsules contain significant amounts of vitamin E, the following 
precautions apply:  
o Patients should not take supplemental vitamin E.  High doses of vitamin E have been 
reported to cause bleeding and interrupt blood coagulation processes.  
o High doses of vitamin E have been reported to potentiate the anticoagulant activity of 
coumadins such as warfarin.  Patien ts who are taking concomitant coumarin 
anticoagulant  medication s should have their INR or anticoagulant assessment 
conducted more frequently after starting AZD6244 therapy.  The dose of 
anticoagulant should be adjusted according  to these anticoagulant measu rements . 
• Reproductive toxicology data indicate that AZD6244 has the potential for adverse effects 
on embryofetal development and survival.  Therefore , AZD6244 should not be 
Abbreviated Title : Ph II AZD6244 pancreatic ca  NCI Protocol #:  10050  
Version Date:  May 1 9, 2018  
47 
 administered to pregnant or breast -feeding women and conception while on treatment 
must be avoided.  Female patients of child -bearing potential will be required to use 
reliable methods of contraception for the duration of the study and until 4 weeks after the 
last dose of AZD6244.  Male patients with sexual partners who could become preg nant 
(i.e., women of child-bearing potential) should use acceptable methods of contraception 
for 12 weeks after completing the study to avoid pregnancy and/or potential adverse 
effects.  
5.3 Duration of Therapy  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event (s), treatment may continue  until one of 
the following criteria applies: 
• Completion of 27 cycles of study therapy  
• Disease progression  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
• Patient decides to withdraw from study therapy  
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable 
for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  (patient non -compliance ) 
• Pregnancy  
o All women of child bearing potential should be instructed to contact the investigator immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period) at any time during study participation.  
o The investigator must immediately notify CTEP in the event of a confirmed pregnancy in a patient participating in the study.  
• Termination of the study by sponsor  
• The drug manufacturer can no longer provide the study agent  
The reason(s) for protocol therapy discontinuation, the reason(s) for study removal, and the 
corresponding dates must be documented in the Case Report Form (CRF).  
 
5.4 Duration of Follow Up  
Patients will be followed for  52 weeks through a telephone interview every 2 months  after 
removal from study therapy or until death, whichever occurs first.  Patie nts removed from study 
for unacceptable adverse event (s) will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse 
event.  Progression Free Survival (PFS) will be captured as the duration of time from start of 
treatment to time of progression or dea th, whichever occurs first. After progression and coming 
off treatment , patients will be followed for 52 weeks through a telephone interview every 2 
months or until death, whichever occurs first.

 6 DOSING DELAYS/DOSE M ODIFICATIONS  
General guidelines for treatment modifications at the time of re -treatment:  
Adverse Events: All adverse events in this trial will be graded using the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0  - a complete listing is available 
at the CTEP website: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
Dose adjustments will be made according to the guidelines below, wit h dose levels defined as 
follows: 
Dose Level (DL)  Agent   Dose  
0 Selumetinib 75 mg twice daily  
-1* Selumetinib 50 mg twice  daily  
-2* Selumetinib  75 mg once daily  
Summary of dose holding/interruptions and dose de -escalation recommendations for selumetinib 
in case of selumetinib -related adverse events (graded according to NCI -CTCAE v5.0) 
General Adverse Events  Action  
Non-hematological, Grade 1 or 2  Continue selumetinib  therapy at full dose prescribed. 
Apply maximum supportive care recommendations.  
If prolonged duration of Grade 2 adverse event (≥7 
days) is affecting quality of life, decrease dose to DL 
-1, if symptoms persist and continue to affect quality 
of life for ≥ 7 more days, a second dose reduction to DL -2 will be allowed.  
Non-hematological, Grade 3 or 4  
(excluding cardiac and hepatobiliary 
events)  Apply maximum supportive care  recommendations. 
Hold selumetinib  therapy until recovery to Grade ≤  1 
(up to 14 days).  
For NCI-CTCAE v5.0 Grade 3 or 4 interstitial 
pneumonitis or Grade 4 rash manifested as toxic 
epidermal necrolysis (e.g. Stevens -Johnson 
Syndrome etc.) selumetinib  must be permanently 
discontinued 
If recurrence of adverse event after drug hold/ 
interruptions is observed, and maximum supportive 
care measures applied, hold drug once again until 
recovery to Grade ≤  1 (up to 14 days) and restart 
drug at DL -1.  If adverse event recurs, a second dose 
reduction to DL -2 will be allowed after symptoms 
recover to Grade ≤  1. 
Non-hematological, Grad e 3 or 4 
adverse events NOT resolved to Action (discontinue or resume selumetinib  therapy) 
in individual cases after discussions with the 
Abbreviated Title : Ph II AZD6244 pancreatic ca  NCI Protocol #:  10050  
Version Date:  May 1 9, 2018  
49 
 Grade ≤ 1 within a maximum of 2 
weeks from last planned 
administration  Sponsor.  
Up to 2 reductions (DL -1 and DL -2) wi ll be 
considered after maximum supportive care recommendations are introduced.  
Cardiac Adverse Events   
Cardiac (Severity corresponding to 
NYHA criteria)  Selumetinib  therapy to be discontinued permanently 
in case of symptomatic NYHA class III and IV CHF. 
Selumetinib  therapy to be held, continued, or 
resumed accordingly  for patients with NYHA class I 
or II CHF.  
Hepatobiliary Adverse Events   
Grade 3 AST/ALT* and  
Grade 2 total bilirubin elevation  Hold selumetinib for 2 weeks; restart drug at DL -1 if 
events resolved to ≤Grade 1.  
If Grade 3 events recur after dose reduction, then 
discontinue selumetinib.  
Grade 2 AST/ALT or  
Grade 1 total bilirubin elevation  Reduce selumetinib by one dose level for 2 weeks. 
Labs should be  done every we ek until resolution of 
AST/ALT elevations to ≤Grade 1  and elevated 
bilirubin levels to normal . At the end of the 2 weeks 
the dose level  may be  increased if the toxicity 
resolves to ≤Grade 1  for AST/ALT elevations or to 
normal for bilirubin. If toxicity doe sn’t resolve to 
≤Grade 1  for AST/ALT elevations or to normal for 
bilirubin , then  continue with the reduced dose . Upon 
two recurrences of these adverse events,  
necessitating dose reduction, no further attempts to return to higher  dose level after resolution to ≤ Grade 
1 will be made.  
Grade 4 events  Discontinue selumetinib  
* retest within 3 days from the first occurrence and then weekly to determine if ALT 
elevation    persists  
 
Note: In case of multiple short interruptions of dose due to either adverse events or drug 
supply or other reasons the sum of days without selumetinib  treatment should not exceed 21 
days in any 90 day treatment period.  
 
7 ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIS T AND REPORTING REQ UIREMENTS  
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of AEs (Section 7.1 ) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section 7.2  and 
Abbreviated Title : Ph II AZD6244 pancreatic ca  NCI Protocol #:  10050  
Version Date:  May 1 9, 2018  
50 
 7.3) will determine whether the event requires expedited  reporting via the CTEP Adverse Event 
Reporting System (CTEP -AERS ) in addition to routine  reporting.  
7.1 Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks List  (CAEPR ) for Selumetinib 
(AZD6244 hydrogen sulfat e [NSC 748727]), AZD6244 (NSC 741078)  
The Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of 
reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform 
presentation of events by body system.  In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset, the 
Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and 
is identified with bold and italicized text. This subset of AEs  (SPEER ) is a list of events that are 
protocol -specific exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI (except as noted below).  Refer to the 
'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements'  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf  for 
further clarification. Frequency is provided based on 969 patients.  Below is the CAEPR for 
Selumetinib (AZD6244).  
NOTE:  Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in 
parentheses next to the AE in the SPEER. If this CAEPR is part of a combination 
protocol using multiple investigational agents and has an AE listed on different 
SPEERs, use the lower of the gra des to determine if expedited reporting is required.

 7.2 Adverse Event Characteristics  
• CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
5.0 will b e utilized for AE reporting.  All appropriate treatment areas should have access 
to a copy of the CTCAE version 5 .0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 5 .0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP web site http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
. 
• For expedited reporting purposes only:   
- AEs for the agent  that are bold and italicized  in the CAEPR ( i.e., those listed in the 
SPEER column, Section 7.1.1 ) should be reported through CTEP -AERS only if the 
grade is above the grade provided in the SPEER . 
• Attribution  of the AE: 
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
7.3 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting   
7.3.1 Expedited AE reporting for this study must use CTEP -AERS  (CTEP Adverse Event 
Reporting System), accessed via the CTEP Web site  (https://eapps -
ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers ).   
The reporting procedures to be followed are presented in the “ NCI G uidelines  for Investigators: 
Adverse  Event Reporting  Requirements  for DCTD (CTEP and  CIP) and DCP INDs and IDEs ” 
which can be downloaded from the CTEP Web site  
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_events.htm ).  
These requirements are briefly outlined in the table s below (Section  7.3.3 ). 
In the rare occurrence when Internet connectivity is lost, a 24-hour notification is to be made to 
CTEP by telephone at 301-897 -7497 .  Once Internet connectivity is restored, the  24-hour 
notification phoned in must be entered electronically into CTEP -AERS  by the original submitter 
at the site.  
7.3.2 Distribution of Adverse Event Reports  
CTEP -AER S is programmed for automatic electronic distribution of reports to the 
following individuals:  Principal Investigator and Adverse Event Coordinator (s) (if 
applicable) of the Corresponding Organization  or Lead Organization , the local treating 
physician, and the Reporter and Submitter .  CTEP -AERS  provides a copy feature for 
other e -mail recipients.  
7.3.3 Expedited Reporting Guidelines  
Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID assigned during trial 
registration on all reports.  
Note:  A death on study requires both routine and expedited reporting , regardless of 
Abbreviated Title : Ph II AZD6244 pancreatic ca  NCI Protocol #:  10050  
Version Date:  May 1 9, 2018

Investigational Agent/Intervention1, 2 
FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:  Investigators MUST immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not they are 
considered related to the i nvestigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY of the following outcomes:   
1) Death 
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation  of existing hospitalization for ≥ 24 hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A 
and ICH E6).  
 
ALL SERIOUS adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST be immediately reported to the NCI via electronic submission within the timeframes detailed in the table below.

 1Serious adverse events that occur more than 30 days after the last administration of investigational 
agent/intervention and have an attribution of possible, probable, or definite require reporting as follows:  
Expedited 24- hour notification followed by com plete report within 5 calendar days for:  
• All Grade 4, and Grade 5 AEs  
Expedited 10 calendar day reports for:  
• Grade 2 adverse events resulting in hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
• Grade 3 adverse events  
2For studies using PET or SPECT IND agents, the AE reporting period is limited to 10 radioactive half -lives, 
rounded UP to the nearest whole day, after the agent/intervention was last administered.  Footnote “1” above 
applies after this reporting period.  
Effective Date:  May 5, 2011 
 
7.4 Routine Adverse Event Reporting  
All Adverse Events must  be reported in routine study data submissions.  AEs reported 
expeditiously through CTEP -AERS  must also be reported in routine study data 
submissions.  
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are 
done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in 
future studies using similar agents.  AEs are reported in  a routine manner at scheduled times 
during the trial using Medidata Rave.  For this trial the  Adverse Event CRF  is used for  routine 
AE reporting in Rave.  
7.5 Secondary Malignancy 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous malignancy  (e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent unde r an 
NCI IND/IDE be reported  expeditiously  via CTEP -AERS .  Three options are available to 
describe the event:  
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy ( e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia 
[AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
• Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be 
reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
7.6 Second Malignancy  
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy ( and is NOT a 
metastasis from the initial malignancy).   Second malignancies require ONLY routine AE 
reporting unless otherwise specified .

A list of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the investigational agent  
administered in this study can be found in Section 7.1 . 
8.1 CTEP Agent 
8.1.1 AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate (NSC 748727)  
Abbreviated Title : Ph II AZD6244 pancreatic ca  NCI Protocol #:  10050  
Version Date:  May 1 9, 2018  
58 
 8.1.1.1  Chemical Name:  5-[(4-bromo-2 -chlorophenyl)amino] -4-fluoro -6-[(2-
hydroxyethoxy)carbamoyl] -1-methyl -1H-benzimidazol -3-ium hydrogen sulfate  
8.1.1.2  Other Names:  Selumetinib hydrogen sulfate; ARRY -142886  
8.1.1.3  Classification:  Mitogen -activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor  
8.1.1.4  CAS R egistry Number:  606143 -52-6 
8.1.1.5  Molecular Formula:  C 17H15BrClFN 4O3• H 2SO 4  M.W.:  555.76 
8.1.1.6  Solubility:   Very low aqueous solubility (3.4 mcg/mL at pH 7.4)  
8.1.1.7  Mode of Action:  AZD6244 is a selective mitogen -activated protein kinase (MEK) 
inhibitor.  By inhibitin g MEK, AZD6244 inhibits ERK phosphorylation, which may 
inhibit oncogenic growth signaling in tumor cells by targeting the 
RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is an important 
mediator of many cellular processes including proliferation, survival, differentiation, 
apoptosis, motility, and metabolism.   
8.1.1.8  How Supplied:  Astra Zeneca supplies and CTEP , DCTD, NCI  distributes AZD6244 
hydrogen sulfate. The agent is supplied as size 4 hydroxypropylmethylcell ulose 
(HPMC) capsules available in 25 mg (bl ue) strengths. Capsules are packaged in white, 
high density polyethylene (HDPE) containers with induction -seals and child -resistant 
closures.  Each bottle contains 60 capsules.  
AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate capsules contain a dispersion of drug in d-α -tocopher yl 
polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS; a water soluble form of vitamin E). Each 
25 mg capsule contains 35.9 mg TPGS.  
 
Daily Vitamin E intake based on the daily adult dose of AZD6244 
Dose  Vitamin E amount  
75 mg twice a day ( 3 x 25 mg x 2)  215.4  mg 
 
8.1.1.9  Storage:  Store the AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate capsules at controlled room temperature (20°C-25°C). Brief excursions are permitted between 15°C and 30°C.    
8.1.1.10  Stability:  Stability studies are ongoing.  
If a storage temperature excursion is identified, promptly return AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate to controlled room temperature and quarantine the supplies.  Provide a detailed 
report of the excursion (including documentation of temperature monitoring and 
durati on of the excursion) to PMBAfterHours@mail.nih.gov for determination of 
suitability.

Version Date:  May 1 9, 2018  
59 
 8.1.1.11  Route of Administration:   Oral.  Do not eat or drink (except water only) for 2 hours 
prior to dosing and 1 hour after dosing selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) 
capsules.  AZD6244 capsules should be taken with water only.        
8.1.1.12  Potential Drug Interactions:  High vitamin E doses may potentiate warfarin’s 
anticoagulant activity.  Monitor PT/INR more frequently in patients receiving both 
warfarin and AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate capsules.   
Avoid concomitant intake of supplemental vitamin E.  
AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate is primarily metabolized by CYP 1A2 to form the active N-desmethyl metabolite; in addition, CYP 1A3 and UGT1A1 form glucuronide 
conjugates. CYP 2C9, 2C19, 3A4/5 can also metabolize the parent agent; however, as observed during in vitro studies using a pan-CYP inhibitor, other available pathways 
contribute to AZD6244 metabolism. Use caution in patients who are taking strong 
inducers or inhibitors  of these CYP or UG T enzymes.  
AZD6244 is also a substrate of BCRP and P -gp transporters.  Use caution in patients 
who are taking strong inducers or inhibitors of either transport protein.  
AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate is a weak inducer of CYP enzymes 3A, 1A and 2C9 and a 
weak inh ibitor of CYP2C9 and both BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein) and 
OATP1B1 transporters. It did not inhibit OCT1 or P -glycoprotein. The N -desmethyl 
metabolite is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2. In vitro data suggest that AZD6244 
hydrogen sulfate is unlikely to cause clinically relevant drug -drug interactions by these 
mechanisms.  
8.1.1.13  Patient Care Implications: Study participants should be counseled to avoid excessive 
sun exposure and use adequate sun protection measures if sun exposure is anticipated during the s tudy.  
 
Availability  
AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate  is an investigational agent supplied to investigators by the Division 
of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), NCI.  
AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate  is provided to the NCI under a Collaborative Agreement between the 
Pharmaceutical Collaborator and the DCTD, NCI (see Section 12.4).  
8.1.2 Agent Ordering and Agent Accountability 
8.1.2.1  NCI-supplied agents may be requested by eligible participating Investigators (or their 
authorized designee) at each participating institution.  The CTEP -assigned protocol 
number must be used for ordering all CTEP -supplied investigational agents.  The 
eligible participating investigators at each participating institution must be registered 
with CTEP, DCTD through an annual submission of FDA Form 1572 (Statement of 
Investigator), NCI Biosketch, Agent Shipment Form, and Financial Disclosure Form 
(FDF).  If the re are several participating investigators at one institution, CTEP -supplied 
investigational agents for the study should be ordered under the name of one lead 
participating investigator at that institutio n.  
Study agent must be ordered after patient is reg istered to the treatment arm as no starter 
supplies are being provided for this study.

9.1 Sample Storage, Tracking and Disposition  
9.1.1 NCI Site Only  
Samples will be ordered  in CRIS  and tracked through a Clinical Trial Data Management system .  
Should a CRIS screen not be available, the CRIS downtime procedures will be followed .  
Samples will not be sent outside NIH without IRB notification and an executed MTA.  
All samples initially will be sent to Blood Processing Core (BPC) for processing and storage until 
they are distributed to Dr. Rudlof f’s lab sample analysis as described  in the protocol.   
9.1.2 Samples Managed by Dr. Figg’s Blood Processing Core (BPC)  
9.1.2.1  BPC contact information  
Please e-mail Julie Barnes at Julie.barnes@nih.gov and Paula Carter pcartera@mail.nih.gov at 
least 24 hours before transporting samples (the Friday befo re is preferred).  
For sample pickup, page 102-11964.  
For immediate help, call 240 -760-6180 (main blood processing core number) or, if no answer, 
240-760-6190 (main clinical pharmacology lab number).  
For questions regarding sample processing, contact Julie Barnes by e -mail or at 240 -760-6044.  
9.1.2.2  Sample Data Collection  
All samples sent to the Blood Processing Core (BPC) will be barcoded, with data entered and 
stored in the LABrador (aka LabSamples) utilized by the BPC . This is a secure program, with 
access to LABrador limited to defined Figg lab personnel, who are issued individual user 
accounts. Installation of LABrador is limited to computers specified by Dr. Figg. These 
computers all have a password restricted login  screen. All Figg lab  personnel with access to 
patient information annually complete the NIH online Protection of Human Subjects course.  
LABrador creates a unique barcode ID for every sample and sample box, which cannot be traced 
Abbreviated Title : Ph II AZD6244 pancreatic ca  NCI Protocol #:  10050  
Version Date:  May 1 9, 2018  
64 
 back to patients without LABrador access. The data recorded for each sample includes the 
patient ID, name, trial name/protocol number, time drawn, cycle time point, dose, material type, 
as well as box and freezer location. Patient demographics associated with the Clinical Center 
patient number are provided in the system. For each sample, there are notes associated with the 
processing method (delay in sample processing, storage conditions on the ward, etc.).  
9.1.2.3  Sample Storage  
Barcoded samples are stored in barcoded boxes in a locked f reezer at either -20 or -80°C 
according to stability requirements.  These freezers are located onsite in the BPC  and offsite at 
NCI Frederick Central Repository Services in Frederick, MD. Visitors to the laboratory are required to be accompanied by laborat ory staff at all times.  
Access to stored clinical samples is restricted. Samples will be stored until requested by a researcher named on the protocol. All requests are monitored and tracked in LABrador. All 
researchers are required to sign a form stating that the samples are only to be used for research 
purposes associated with this trial (as per the IRB approved protocol) and that any unused 
samples must be returned to the BPC . It is the responsibility of the NCI Principal Investigator to 
ensure that the samples requested are being used in a manner consistent with IRB approval.  
9.1.3 Procedures for Storage of Tissue Specimens in the Laboratory of Pathology 
Tissues designated for clinical diagnostics are transported to the Laboratory of Pathology (LP) where they are examined grossly and relevant portions are fixed, embedded in paraffin and 
sectioned and stained for diagnostic interpretation.  Unutilized excess tissues are stored for up to 
three months, in accordance with College of American Pathologists/Joint Comm ission on 
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (CAP/JCAHO) guidelines, and then discarded.  
Following completion of the diagnostic workup, the slides and tissue blocks are stored 
indefinitely in the LP’s clinical archives.  All specimens are catalogue d and retrieved utilizing 
the clinical laboratory information systems, in accordance with CAP/JCAHO regulations.  The 
use of any stored specimens for research purposes is only allowed for research conducted in 
relation to this protocol.  
9.1.4 Protocol Completion/Sample Destruction  
All specimens obtained in the protocol are used as defined in the protocol. Any specimens that are remaining at the completion of the protocol will be stored in the conditions described in Secti on above . The study will remain open so long as  sample or data analysis continues.  
Samples from consenting subjects will be stored until they are no longer of scientific value or if a subject withdraws consent for their continued use, at which time they will be destroyed. The PI 
will report any  loss or destruction of samples to the NCI IRB as soon as he is made aware of 
such loss.  If the patient withdraws consent the participant’s data will be excluded from future 
distributions, but data that have already been distributed for approved research use will not be 
able to be retrieved.  
The PI will report destroyed samples to the IRB if samples become unsalvageable because of 
environmental factors (ex. broken freezer or lack of dry ice in a shipping container) or if a patient 
withdraws consent. Samples  will also be reported as lost if they are lost in transit between 
facilities or misplaced by a researcher.  Freezer problems, lost samples or other problems 
associated with samples will also be reported to the IRB, the NCI Clinical Director, and the

11 MEASUREMENT OF EFFEC T 
11.1 Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evalua ted for response after the first 4 
weeks, then every 8 weeks thereafter .  In addition to a baseline scan, confirmator y scans should 
also be obtained 4 we eks following initial documentation of objective response.  
Response and progression will be evaluated i n this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228-247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph 
nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
11.1.1  Definitions  
Abbreviated Title : Ph II AZD6244 pancreatic ca  NCI Protocol #:  10050  
Version Date:  May 1 9, 2018  
68 
 Evaluable for toxicity .  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first 
treatment with AZD6244.  
Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response .  Patients who have lesions present at baseline that are 
evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disea se, have received at least one cycle 
of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for non -target 
disease.  The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression 
of the lesions.  
11.1.2  Disease Pa rameters  
Measurable disease.  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in 
at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 20 mm (≥2 c m) by chest x-ray  or as 
≥10 mm  (≥1 c m) with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinic al exam.  All tumor measurements 
must be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be 
considered measurable.   
Malignant lymph nodes.   To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be ≥ 15 mm  (≥1.5 c m) in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm  [0.5 cm] ).  At baseline and in follow -up, 
only the short  axis will be measured and followed.  
Non-measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm  [<1 cm]  or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm  [≥1 to <1. 5 cm] 
short axis), are considered non-m easurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, 
ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non-measurable.  
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by 
definition, simple cysts.  
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metasta ses can be considered as measurable lesions, 
if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are 
present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded 
and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesio ns 
with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproduci ble measurement in which 
circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A 
sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reporte d as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters 
will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable 
dimension of the disease.  
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over 
Abbreviated Title : Ph II AZD6244 pancreatic ca  NCI Protocol #:  10050  
Version Date:  May 1 9, 2018  
69 
 and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, 
or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up.  
11.1.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation  using a ruler or calipers.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be  used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging-based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by clinical exam . 
Clinical lesions :  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm  (≥1 cm)  diameter as assessed using 
calipers ( e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, 
including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
define d and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI :  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan 
based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm  (0.5 cm)  or less.  If CT scans have slice 
thickn ess greater than 5 mm  (0.5 cm) , the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice 
the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body scans).   
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly 
impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of 
MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is perf ormed, the technical specifications of the 
scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  
Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should be the same as was used at 
baseline and the lesions s hould be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond 
the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans 
should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
PET-CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined P ET-CT 
is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if 
the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic 
quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be 
used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in 
accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT 
introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially 
performed.   
Ultrasound:   Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for 
independe nt review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
Abbreviated Title : Ph II AZD6244 pancreatic ca  NCI Protocol #:  10050  
Version Date:  May 1 9, 2018  
70 
 guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the 
next.  If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, con firmation by CT 
or MRI is advised.  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead 
of CT in selected instances.  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy : The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised.  However , such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological 
response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following 
complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
Tumor markers :  Tumor markers alo ne cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are initially 
above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered a complete biochemical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent ovarian 
cancer) an d PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published [ JNCI 96:487 -488, 
2004; J Clin Oncol  17, 3461-3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  26:1148-1159, 2008].  In addition, the 
Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -125 progression criteria which ar e to be 
integrated with objective tumor assessment for use in first-line trials in ovarian cancer [ JNCI 
92:1534-1535, 2000].  
Cytology, Histology:   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses 
(PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as 
germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable t umor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
FDG -PET :  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the follo wing algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  
b. No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive FDG -
PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of diseas e confirmed by CT, this is PD.  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow -up CT scans  are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing 
site of disease on CT that is n ot progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this 
is not PD.  
c. FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy 
in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or 
scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be prospectively 
described in the protocol and supported by disease -specific medical literature for the 
indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false 
positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.

 Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
11.1.4  Response Criteria  
11.1.4.1  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must hav e reduction in short axis to <10 
mm (<1 cm) . 
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the  diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm  (0.5 cm) .  
(Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters w hile on 
study.  
11.1.4.2  Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm  
[<1 cm]  short axis).  
Note:  If tumor markers  are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status c hange, not a single lesion increase.  
Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion 
of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time by the  review panel (or Principal 
Investigator).  
11.1.4.3  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.

 11.1.5  Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first 
date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
for CR until the first date that pr ogressive disease is objectively documented.   
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
11.1.6  Progression -Free Survival  
PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.

12.2.1  Method 
For studies assigned for CTMS Routine  Monitoring : 
This study will be monitored by the Clinical Trials Monitoring Service (CTMS).   Data 
will be submitted to CTMS at least once every two weeks via Medidata Rave (or other 
modality if approved by CTEP).  Information on CTMS reporting is available at:  
http://theradex.com/clinicalTechnologies/?National-Cancer -Institute -NCI-11 .  On -site 
audits will be conducted on a n 18-36 month basis as part of routine cancer center site 
visits. More frequent audits may be conducted if warranted by accrual or due to concerns 
regarding data quality or timely submission.   For CTMS monitored studies, after users 
have activated their accounts, please contact the Theradex Help Desk at (609) 799 -7580 
or by email at CTMSSupport@theradex.com  for additional support with Rave and 
comple tion of CRFs.  
12.2.2  Responsibility for Data Submission  
For ETCTN trials, it is the responsibility of the PI(s) at the site to ensure that all 
investigators at the ETCTN Sites understand the procedures for data submission for each 
ETCTN protocol and that protocol specified data are submitted accurately and in a timely 
manner to t he CTMS via the electronic data capture system, Medidata Rave.   
Data are to be submitted via Medidata Rave to CTMS on a real -time basis, but no less 
Abbreviated Title : Ph II AZD6244 pancreatic ca  NCI Protocol #:  10050  
Version Date:  May 1 9, 2018  
75 
 than once every 2 weeks.   The timeliness of data submissions and timeliness in resolving 
data queries will be tracked by CTMS.  Metrics for timeliness will be followed and 
assessed on a quarterly basis.  For the purpose of Institutional Performance Monitoring, 
data will be considered delinquent if it is greater than 4 weeks past due.  
Data from Medidata Rave an d CTEP -AERS  is reviewed by the CTMS on an ongoing 
basis as data is received.  Queries will be issued by CTMS directly within Rave.  The 
queries will appear on the Task Summary Tab within Rave for the CRA at the ETCTN to 
resolve.   Monthly web-based reports are posted for review by the Drug Monitors in the 
IDB, CTEP.  Onsite audits will be conducted by the CTMS to ensure compliance with 
regulatory requirements, GCP, and NCI policies and procedures with the overarching goal of ensuring the integrity of data ge nerated from NCI-sponsored clinical trials , as 
described in the ETCTN Program Guidelines, which may be found on the CTEP 
(
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolD evelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_events.htm
)  and CTSU websites.  
An End of Study CRF  is to be completed by the PI , and is  to include a summary of study 
endpoints not otherwise captured in the database, such as (for phase 1 trials)  the 
recommended  phase 2 dose (RP2D), and a description of any dose -limiting toxicities  
(DLTs) .  CTMS  will utilize a core set of eCRFs that are Cancer Data Standards Registry 
and Repository (caDSR) compliant  (http://cbiit.nci.nih.gov/ncip/biomedical-informatics -
resources/interoperability -and-semantics/metadata -and-models ).  Customized eCRFs will 
be included when appropriate to meet unique study requirements.  The PI is encouraged 
to review the eCRFs , working closely with CTMS to ensure prospectively that all 
required items are appropriate ly captured in the eCRFs prior to study activatio n.  CTMS 
will prepare the eCRFs with built-in edit checks to the extent possible to promote data 
integrity.  
CDUS data submissions for ETCTN trials activated after March 1, 2014, will be carried out by the CTMS contractor, Theradex.  CDUS submissions are pe rformed by Theradex 
on a monthly basis.  The trial’s lead institution is responsible for timely submission to CTMS via Rave, as above.

 13 HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTE CTIONS  
13.1 Rationale For Subject Selection  
The patients to be en tered in this protocol have advanced pancreatic cancer , either locally 
advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer or stage IV disease with metastatic disease 
dissemination, and hence  have limited life expectancies.  
Subjects from both genders and all racial/ethnic groups are eligible for this study if they meet the eligibility criteria.  To da te, there is no information that suggests that differences in drug 
metabolism or disease response would be expected in one group compared to another.  Efforts 
will be made to extend accrual to a representative population, but in this preliminary study, a 
balance must be struck between patient safety considerations and limitations on the number of 
individuals exposed to potentially toxic and/or ineff ective treatments on the one hand and the 
need to explore gender and ethnic aspects of clinical research on the other hand.  If differences in 
outcome that correlate to gender or to ethnic identity are noted, accrual may be expanded or a 
follow -up study ma y be written to investigate those differences more fully.  
13.2 Participation of Children  
Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of AZD6244  in patients 
<18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligi ble for future pediatric 
trials.  
13.3 Participation of Subjects Unable to Give Consent  (NCI Site Only)  
Adults unable to give consent are excluded from enrolling in the protocol.  However re -consent 
may be necessary and there is a possibility, though unlikely, t hat subjects could become 
decisionally impaired. For this rea son and because there is a prospect of direct benefit from 
research participation (section  13.4), all subjects  ≥ age 18  will be offered the opportunity to fill 
in their wishes for research and care,  and assign a substitute decision maker on the “NIH 
Advance Directive for Health Care and Medical Research Participation” form so that another 
person can make decisions about their medical care in the event that they become incapacitated 
or cognitively impaired during the course of the study.  Note: The PI or AI will contact the NIH 
Ability to Consent Assessment Team for evaluation.  For those subje cts that become 
incapacitated and do not have pre -determined substitute decision maker, the p rocedures 
described in MEC  Policy 87-4 for appointing a surrogate decision maker for adult subjects who 
are (a) decisionally impaired, and (b) who do not have a legal guardian or durable power of 
attorney, will be followed.  
13.4 Evaluation of Benefits and Risks/Discomforts  
Potential ben efits to subjects expected from the trial: As a result of participating in this trial, 
patients will receive evaluation and treatment of their tumor.  This protocol may or may not be 
helpful for a specific patient, but the results may help the investigator s learn about the 
administration of AZD6244  on a continuing basis.  The potential for this research treatment to 
offer control of the disease is unknown; however, based on information to date, the possibility of 
an effect on the progression of disease exis ts.  Benefit cannot be promised nor can the chance of 
benefit be accurately predicted.  
Potential risks of selumetinib  include the range of side effects outlined in S ection  8.1.1
. 
Abbreviated Title : Ph II AZD6244 pancreatic ca  NCI Protocol #:  10050  
Version Date:  May 1 9, 2018  
79 
 13.4.1  Alternative Approaches or Treatments  
Patients will be advised verbally and in writing regarding the risks and benefits of this trial, 
treatment requirements, and alternative approaches to entering the trial. Written consents will be 
obtaine d. 
13.4.2  Procedures to Eliminate or Minimize Potential Risks  
This study may involve unforeseeable risks for patients, such as side effects whose exact nature 
and severity are unpredictable. Scrupulous care will be taken to minimize such side effects. All patients will be given blood tests, physical examinations, and scans, as described in the 
monitoring schedule , and must have a local physician to provide long -term care and monitoring 
for complications. Immediate medical treatment is available at the enrollment s ite for any 
patients who suffer physical injury as a result of participation in this study. No compensation is 
available, but any injury will be evaluated and treated in keeping with the benefits or care to 
which patients are entitled under applicable regu lations.  
13.4.3  Provisions for Monitoring Data Collection to Ensure Subject Safety  
As information is gathered from this trial, clinical results will be shared with patients.  
Laboratory and clinical data will be frequently gathered and any new significant findin g(s) found 
during the course of the research, which may affect a patient’s willingness to participate further, will be explained.  
Confidentiality of information concerning participants will be maintained, including in all publications and presentations resulting from this study.  Names of participants or material 
identifying participants will not be released without permission, except as such release is 
required by law.  Records at the National Cancer Institute are maintained according to current 
legal requirements, and are made available for review, as required by the Food and Drug 
Administration or other authorized users, only under the guidelines established by the Federal 
Privacy Act.  
13.4.4  Biopsies  
All care will be taken to minimize risks tha t may be incurred by tumor sampling. However, there 
are procedure-related risks (such as bleeding, infection and visceral injury) that will be explained 
fully during informed consent. If patients suffer any physical injury as a result of the biopsies, 
imme diate medical treatment is available at the enrollment site .  Although no compensation is 
available, any injury will be fully evaluated and treated in keeping with the benefits or care to 
which patients are entitled under applicable regulations.  
13.4.5  Radiation risks  
The optional biopsy collected at 2 weeks is for research purposes only and will be done under CT guidance.  Subjects undergoing optional biopsy collection will be exposed to 0.80  rem.  This 
amount of radiation is below the guideline of 5 rem per year allowed for adult research subjects 
by the NIH Radiation Safety Committee.  
13.4.6  Non-Physical Risks of Genetic Research  
13.4.6.1  Risk of receiving unwanted information 
Anxiety and stress may arise as a result of the anticipation that unwanted information regarding diseas e related DNA sequencing or disease tendencies, or misattributed paternity. Patients will 
Abbreviated Title : Ph II AZD6244 pancreatic ca  NCI Protocol #:  10050  
Version Date:  May 1 9, 2018  
80 
 be clearly informed that the data related to DNA sequencing and genetic analysis is coded, 
investigational and will not be shared with patients, family members or hea lth care providers.  
13.4.6.2  Risk related to possibility that information may be released  
This includes the risk that data related to genotype, DNA sequencing or risk for disease tendency or trait can be released to members of the public, insurers, employers, or law enforcement 
agencies. Although there are no plans to release results to the patients, family members or health 
care providers, this risk will be included in the informed consent document.  
13.4.6.3  Risk to family or relatives  
Family members or relatives may or may  not want to be aware of familial tendencies or genetic 
risks of disease which may cause anxiety about possible future health problems.  
13.5 Risks/Benefits Analysis 
Considering that the drug has been administered to thousands of patients  already and has been 
found safe, the preclinical efficacy data including patient -derived xenotransplanation models and 
considering that pancreatic cancer is a rapidly fatal disease with few effective treatment option, a 
gross risk/benefit analysis appears  to be in overwhelming favor for potential benefit . 
13.6 Consent Process and Documentation 
The investigational nature and objectives of this trial, the procedures and treatments involved and 
their attendant risks and discomforts, potential benefits and potentia l alternative therapies will be 
carefully explained to the patient or the patient’s surrogate, and a signed informed consent 
document will be obtained by the PI, AI or clinical staff fellow.  Moreover, any experimental 
invasive procedure will require a sep arate consent form.  
13.6.1  Telephone Reconsent Procedure  (NCI Site Only)  
The informed consent document will be sent to the subject.  An explanation of the study will be provided over the telephone after the subject has had the opportunity to read the consent form.  
The subject will sign and date t he informed consent. A witness to the subject’s signature will 
sign and date the consent.  
The original informed consent document will be sent back to the consenting investigator who 
will sign and date the consent form with the  date the consent was obtained via telephone.   
A fully execu ted copy will be returned via ma il for the subject’s records.  
The informed consent process will be documented on a progress note by the consenting  
investigator and a copy of the informed consent document and note will be kept  in the subject’s 
research reco rd. 
14 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
14.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
This is a phase 2 trial in patients with measurable locally advanced or stage IV pancreas cancer patients harboring KRAS G12R mutations are treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor selumetinib (AZD624 4).  All patients eligible for treatment will undergo formal response 
evaluation after 1 and 3 cycles of therapy and every 2 cycles after that.  
Abbreviated Title : Ph II AZD6244 pancreatic ca  NCI Protocol #:  10050  
Version Date:  May 1 9, 2018  
81 
 14.1.1  Screening  
The prevalence of advanced pancreas cancer patients harboring KRAS G12R mutations is 15%. 
Using an out side organization, Foundation Medicine, potential participants for this trial may be 
pre-screened for the presence of the KRAS G12R mutation prior to enrolling on this trial. As a 
result, it is expected that greater than 50% of subjects who are pre -screened and then enrolled onto 
this trial for further evaluation will be able to be treated on this trial. If this were to apply to the 
screening population and if 155 patients were screened, there is a 73% probability of identifying 
at least 21 patients with a KRAS G12R mutation.  The primary objective of this trial is to determine 
if selumetinib monotherapy is able to produce adequate numbers of clinical responses in patients 
with locally advanced or stage IV metastatic pancreas cancer with KRAS G12R mutations. If so, 
this regimen will be considered for use in subsequent studies, to determine its role in this disease. 
Evaluable patients are patients whose response to a treatment can be measured because enough 
information has been collected (e.g. patients who come  off study due to progression of disease, 
either by RECIST or clinically, due to toxicity, or patient’s withdrawal). Inevaluable patients are 
patients who are lacking this information.  
14.1.2  Treatment  
The primary objective of this trial is to determine if selume tinib monotherapy is able to produce 
adequate numbers of clinical responses in patients with locally advanced or stage IV metastatic 
pancreas cancer with KRAS G12R mutations.  If so, this regimen will be considered for use in 
subsequent studies, to determi ne its role in this disease.  
The study will be conducted using a phase 2 optimal design.  The objective of the trial will be to determine whether this novel agent is able to be associated with a response rate (PR + CR) that 
can rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in favor of an improved response rate of 30% (p1=0.30). Using 
alpha=0.10 (probability of accepting a poor agent) and beta=0.10 (probability of rejecting a good 
agent), initially 7 evaluable patients will be enrolled in the study. If after accrual of patient #7 n o 
patient has responded, accrual will be halted until patient #7 becomes evaluable.  If 0 of 7 patients 
respond, then no further patients will be enrolled.  If 1 or more of the first 7 evaluable patients 
enrolled have a clinical response, then accrual will continue until a total of 21 evaluable patients 
have been enrolled. If 1 to 2 of the 21 has a clinical response, then this will be considered 
inadequate for further investigation of this regimen. If 3 or more of 21 respond, then this will 
warrant further i nvestigation in a subsequent trial.  Under the null hypothesis (5% response rate), 
the probability of early termination is 70%.   
14.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate 
The accrual ceiling will be set at 60 patients to be screened for the presence of KRAS G12R 
mutations to allow for treatment of up to 25 patients, which would include up to 3 inevaluable 
patients.  It is expected that 1 -2 patients per month will be treated on this trial.  Allowing for 
treatmen t with this agent over a two year period with follow up, it is expected that the trial will be 
completed in approximately 3 years.  
14.3 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Progression -free survival will be calculated using the Kaplan -Meier method.  
Toxicity data will be obtained and presented by type and grade of toxicity. Toxicities may be 
informally compared within patient subsets to estimate the toxicity rate in those subsets .

 The association of response to selumetinib (PR as defined by RECIST) and presence of 
concomitant activating oncogene mutations or loss of tumor suppressor function will be presented 
descriptively to estimate the response rates according to those characteristics . 
Comparisons between the semi -quantitative measurements of CNKSR1 will be made descriptively 
to estimate the  difference s of the expression level in pancreas cancer tissues and clinical outcome 
variables. Similarly, ctDNA levels , and alterations in somatic v ariants between baseline and repeat 
profiling (integrated biomarker; voluntary)  will be evaluated for change from baseline levels  and 
the estimated changes will be reported .  
A variety of other secondary evaluations will be performed. In all cases, the evaluations will be 
done with exploratory intent, and results will be presented descriptively.  
Priority #1 –  predictive biomarkers for response to selumetinib in KRAS G12R pancreas cancer 
patients: 
1. Pre-treatment variant profile and response. Presence of variants identified in the 50 -cancer 
gene panel will be compared with response , presenting the results in a 2 x2 table with findings 
reported descriptively . 
2. Pre-treatment ctDNA levels will be divided into  groups to separate aberrant values from the 
rest. The cutoffs will be  > and <2 standard deviations of the mean , with  the cutoffs a pplied to both 
ctDNA levels. Based on these groups, resulting in patients with cfDNA transcripts levels >2 SD 
above  the mean, patients with cfDNA transcripts levels <2SD below the mean, and the rest in 
between, the categorical results will be evaluated and reported relative to response vs. non -
response in a descriptive manner.  
3. Pre-treatment CNKSR1 staining (scored semi -quantitatively as 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+, per number 
of treated  patients) vs. response  or not will be reported in a table.  
Priority #2 – longitudinal biomarker measuring response to treatment  
1. cfDNA transcript levels will be followed from the  start of treatment q2 weeks and  the change 
to pre -treatment will be plotte d for each timepoint in a spider plot format. This will be a descriptive 
presentation only.  
2. Variant profile derived from voluntary repeat biopsies will be compared to pre -treatment 
variant profile and gain of variants (adjusted for similar sequencing de pth) will be recorded.  This 
will be a descriptive presentation only .

14.4 Reporting and Exclusions  
14.4.1  Evaluation of Toxicity  
All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment with AZD6244.  
14.4.2  Evaluation of Response  
All patients included in the study must be assessed for response to treatment, even if there are 
major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible.  Each patient will be assigned one of 
the following categories:  1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) 
progressive disease, 5) early deat h from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early 
death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data).  [Note:  By 
arbitrary convention, category 9 usually designates the “unknown” status of any type of data in a 
clinical database.]  
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of those who 
received no study medication) should be included in the main analysis of the response rate.  
Patients in response categories 4 -9 should be considered to have a treatment failure (disease 
progression).  Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate.  Precise definitions for categories 4 -9 will be 
protocol specific .  
All conclusions should be based on all eligible patients.  Sub analyses may then be performed on 
the basis of a subset of patients, excluding those for whom major protocol deviations have been identified ( e.g., early death due to other reasons, early di scontinuation of treatment, major 
protocol violations, etc.).  However, these sub analyses may not serve as the basis for drawing 
Abbreviated Title : Ph II AZD6244 pancreatic ca  NCI Protocol #:  10050  
Version Date:  May 1 9, 2018  
84 
 conclusions concerning treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the 
analysis should be clearly reported .  The 95% confidence intervals should also be provided.

Information for Patients, Their Caregivers and Non -Study Healthcare Team  on Possible 
Interactions with Other Drugs and Herbal Supplements  
 
The patient ____________________________ is enrolled on a clinical trial using the 
experimental study drug,  selumetinib ( AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) .  This clinical trial is 
sponsored by the National Cancer Institute  (NCI).  This form is addressed to the patient, but 
includes important information for others who care for this patient.  
 
These are the things that you as a prescriber need to know:  
  
Selumetinib ( AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate)  interacts with certain specific enzymes  in the liver and 
certain transport proteins that help move drugs in and out of cells . 
 
• The enzymes in question are CYP 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4/5 and UGT  1A1 and 1A3.  
Selumetinib ( AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate ) is metabo lized by these enzymes and may be 
affected by other drugs that inhibit or induce these enzymes.  
• The proteins in question are P -gp and BCRP.  Selumetinib ( AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate)  is a 
substrate of BCRP and P -gp transporters and may be affected by other dr ugs that inhibit 
or induce these  transporters.  
             
          March 2016  
 To the patient: Take  this paper with you to your medical appointments and keep the 
attached information card in your wallet .   
 
Selumetinib ( AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate ) interacts with many drugs  which can cause side 
effects. Because of this, it is very important to tell your study doctors about all of your medicine s 
before you enroll on this clinical trial.  It is also very important to tell them if you  stop taking any 
regular medicines , or if you start taking a new medicine while you take part in this study.  W hen 
you talk about your medications with your doctor s, include medicine you buy without a  
prescription (over -the-counter remedy), or any herbal supplements such as St. John’s W ort. It is 
helpful to bring your medication bottles or an updated medication list with you.  
 
Many health care prescribers can write prescriptions.  You must also tell your health care 
providers  (doctors, physician assistants,  nurse practitioners , pharmacists ) you are taking part in a 
clinical trial.

These are the things that you and they need to know:  
 
Selumetinib ( AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate ) must be used very carefully with other medicines that 
need certain liver enzymes and transport proteins to be effective or to be cleared from your 
system.  Before you enroll onto the clinical trial, your study doctor will work with your regular 
health care providers  to review  any medicines  and herbal supplements  that are considered 
“strong in ducers/inhibitors of CYP 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 3A/5, UGT  1A1 and 1A3, P -gp and 
BCRP.”  
• Please be very careful!  Over -the-counter drugs  (including herbal supplements)  may 
contain ingredients that could interact with your study drug.  Speak to your doctor or 
pharmacist to determine if there could be any side effects.   
• Avoid taking extra vitamin E found in vitamins or supplements.  
• Your regular health care provider  should check a frequently updated m edical reference or 
call your study doctor before prescribing any new medicine or discontinuing any medicine .  Your study doctor’s name is  
__________________________________________                and he or she can be contacted at

 16.8 Appendix H Plasma preparation for cell free (cf) DNA extraction using EDTA 
collection tubes.   
 
10/15/2016  
1. Collect up to 5 ml Peripheral Blood in standard EDTA (purple top) collection tube .  
Record time of blood draw on tube.  
 
2.  Bring to lab stat for processing* 
 
3. Centrifuge at 1500 x g for 10 minutes to remove blood cells at 4°C . 
 
4. Transfer supernatant to new nuclease free conical tube carefully taking care not to disturb 
buffy coat ** 
 
5. Centrifuge a second time at 10,000 x g at 4°C to remove any remaining cells and 
debris. ** 
 
6. Carefully transfer supernatant without disturbing the pellet into nuclease free cryotubes (2 ml size) and store at -80°C until DNA extraction.  
  
*processing should occur within 2 hours at room temperature of blood draw or stored at 4°C for 
up to 24 hours to prevent lysing of blood cells  
 
**It is extremely important, not to  disturb the buffy coat after the first spin, and any pellet af ter 
the second spin.

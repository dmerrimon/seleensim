 1.0 BACKGROUND, RATIONALE  
 
Cardiac transplantation  is currently the procedure of choice for selected patients with end -stage 
heart disease that is not amenable  to further medical intervention or conventional cardiac 
procedures.  Successful organ preservation is an important component of transplantation and 
ensures the maintenance of organ viability until implantation into the recipient.  Currently, heart 
preservation for transplantation is limited to 4 to 6 hours of cold ischemic storage.  Longer periods 
of ischemia are associated with poor outcomes post transplantation.  In heart transplantation, 
preservation injury and ischemic reperfusion injury contribute to microvascular dysfunction and myocardial injury leading to primary graft dysfunction or to the activ ation of pro- inflammatory and 
pro-fibrotic processes, and the development of cardiac fibrosis and allograft vasculopathy.   
 
In general, instructions for the use of organ preservation solutions state a temperature range of 2 -
8°C or 4 -8°C, balancing the ris k of cold injury at lower temperatures against the risk of hypoxic 
injury at higher temperatures.  The standard method of storing donor hearts in preservation fluid within sequential bags that are then placed on ice and transported in a cooler does not all ow for 
exact temperature control.  The SherpaPak ™ Cardiac Transport System has been developed to 
provide a safe, consistent method for cold ischemic storage of donor hearts for transplantation.  
Successful use of this device may decrease cold injury of don or hearts by maintaining the 
temperature consistently during transport and therefore may decrease primary graft dysfunction after transplantation.  
2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
Primary Objective  
To compare the SherpaPak ™ Cardiac Transport System to standard of care cold storage of donor 
hearts for transplantation.  
 Secondary Objective  
To assess for a decrease in cold injury of donor hearts and therefore a decrease in primary graft dysfunction.  To assess for events between study groups.   
 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint will be a composite endpoint of:  Absence of moderate to severe primary graft dysfunction per ISHLT grading scale  (left or right ventricle) in the first 24 hours post 
transplantation, and 30 -day patient survival, 30- day incidence of ischemi c reperfusion injury on 
endomyocardial biopsies and changes in mitochondria function and quality ( at donor heart 
harvesting, at the time just prior to donor heart implantation and at one -week post - heart

3.0 STUDY POPULATION   
3.1 SELECTION OF THE STUDY POPULATION  
• Study subjects will be drawn from  patients listed for heart transplant at Cedars -Sinai 
Medical Center.  
3.2 INCLUSION CRITERIA  
• Any sex/gender, 18 years of age or older  listed for  heart transplant.  
• Subjects must be willing and be capable of understanding the purpose and risks of 
the study and must sign a statement of informed consent  OR consent of a legally 
authorized representative of a cognitively impaired individual will be obtained before the cognitively impaired individual may be included in research.  
• Signed: 1) written informed consent document and 2) authorization to use and 
disclose protected health information  
• Subjects must receive and accept a non -local donor offer (from Northern California, 
Arizona, Nevada or farther geographies)  
3.3 EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
Not Applicable  
3.4 SUBJECT SCREENI NG AND ENROLLMENT  
All patients on the  heart transplant waiting list at Cedars -Sinai will be identified by trial 
investigators and screened for trial eligibility . Those patients who initially appear eligible for 
the trial will have the trial thoroughly expl ained to them by a trial investigator, be invited to 
participate, and will be asked to sign an informed consent . Consent of a legally authorized 
representative of a cognitively impaired individual will be obtained before the cognitively 
impaired individual  may be included in research.   
 When a matching donor heart becomes available, the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be 
re-verified by the study team. If the recipient is no longer eligible for the trial, they will be 
considered a screen failure and th ey will exit the study and no information will be collected 
for these patients.  
 If the subject is matched with a donor heart from a local donor (Southern California), the 
Page 6  of 13  
HRP -652-Protocol Template_Investigator -Initiated Clinical Research_ 09/25/2020 
 
 subject will be considered a screen failure and they will exit the study and no information will 
be collected for these patients.  
 When a matching donor heart  from a non- local donor offer (from Northern California, 
Arizona, Nevada or farther geographies)  becomes available  the recipient will be assigned a 
subject identification number  and randomized 1:1 to receive a heart transported using either 
standard of care cold storage or the SherpaPak ™ Cardiac Transport System . REDCap will 
be used for randomization.  
3.5 SUBJECT RECRUITMENT  
All subjects will be patients of the principal investigator and co- investigators, managed as 
part of the Cedars -Sinai Advanced Heart Failure/Heart Transplant Program.  Subjects will 
be approached in person during clinic visits or upon hospital admission by investigators or study coordinat ors after confirming eligibility.  No advertising will be used for recruitment 
purposes.  
4.0 STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
This study is designed to be conducted as a single -center randomized prospective trial to compare 
the SherpaPak ™ Cardiac Transport System to standard of care cold storage for donor hearts in 
transplantation.  Approximately 20 consented subjects will receive a donor heart transported using either cold storage or the SherpaPak ™ Cardiac Transport System, respectively. Both methods are 
FDA approved.  
 
Donor hearts  will be screened for eligibility based on current standard of care criteria.  Heart 
transplant candidates will be screened for trial eligibility.  Every eligible candidate will be asked to participate. Eligible and consented transplant candidates will receive donor hearts transported using 
standard of care cold storage or the SherpaPak ™ Cardiac Transport System, that have been deemed 
clinically acceptable for transplantation by the treating transplant clinical team.  
 
The study will be evaluating the comparative use of two FDA -approved methods for organ 
procurement . The research  procedures  will be randomization, data collection/analysis , and tissue 
collection from standard of care biopsies for mitochondrial testing.  
 Mitochondrial Testing  
Biopsy tissue from donor hearts will be collected prior to transport, prior to transplant and at one -
week post -transplant. The tissue will be evaluated to detect changes in mitochondrial function and 
regulation.  
 
Biopsy tissue will be processed and stored by the Gottlieb Laboratory at Cedars -Sinai.  The Gottlieb 
Laboratory, led by Roberta A. Gottlieb, MD, is studying the molecular mechanisms regulating mitochondria in the heart’s response to ischemic injury.

6.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING   
6.1 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
Safety will be analyzed principally by examination of the frequency of adverse events. In 
particular, the number of donor heart graft -related serious adverse events (SAEs) up to the 
30-day follow -up after transplantation per subject will be analyzed. This endpoint is defined 
to consist of the following adverse events (at most one per type), if they are serious adverse 
events:  
• Primary heart graft dysfunction (not including rejection or cardiac tamponade):  
o Use of ECMO, RVAD, LVAD, BiVAD  or insertion of a new IABP for >12 
hours post TX.  
o Use of ≥ 2 inotropic agents/vasopressors including high- dose epinephrine or 
norepinephrine for >7 days post heart TX.  
o Open chest post heart TX. due to compromised heart function  
• Primary graft failure requiring re -transplantation  
 
Subjects will be monitored before, during and after the operative procedure to help ensure 
their safety. The investigators are members of transplant teams who have extensive 
experience with heart transplants and who wi ll be trained to use the SherpaPak Cardiac 
Transport System to further minimize risk.  
 
Subjects in the trial will undergo frequent visits and routine monitoring to help detect any 
abnormal changes and to provide appropriate treatment as necessary.  
 An inde pendent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) comprised of two expert heart 
failure physicians and one cardiothoracic surgeon not participating in the trial, will perform 
Page 11 of 13  
HRP -652-Protocol Template_Investigator -Initiated Clinical Research_ 09/25/2020 
 
 monitoring activities to ensure the identification, documentation, and analysis of adverse 
events; and to ensure compliance with the protocol and procedures that are in place for 
conducting research to protect the safety and well -being of all subjects.  The DSMB will 
have a formal meeting  at least once  annually. Frequency of the meetings  may be changed by 
the DSMB in consultation with the Principal Investigator based on need. An ad hoc meeting 
may be called at any time by the Chairperson or by the PI and research staff should ethical 
or patient safety issues arise.  
 
A status update will also be provided to the DSMB on a quarterly basis via email 
correspondence by the DSMB Coordinator.  
 
The criteria below provide guidance for suspending trial enrollment/randomization until 
review by the DSMB . Selected serious adverse events  (SAEs)  of concer n and their 
thresholds are:  
• Two (2) episodes of severe primary graft dysfunction (PGD) per ISHLT grading 
criteria (left or right ventricle, not including rejection or cardiac tamponade)  
requiring use of a mechanical circulatory support (MCS) device within 24 hours after 
transplant in subjects randomized to the SherpaPak method of transport.  
• Two (2) deaths occur in subjects randomized to the SherpaPak method of transport 
within 7 days after transplant.  
 
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to report all of the above SAEs to the 
DSMB within 24 hours of discovering the event.  
 In the event that the study is suspended, no new subjects will be consented or randomized 
to the trial. Subjects a lready in follow -up on the study will continue to be followed as 
outlined in the protocol unless the appointed Chair provides further recommendations . 
 
All heart graft -related adverse events and serious adverse events are to be recorded on the 
electronic c ase report forms until post -transplant day 30. The description of the adverse 
event will include: the date of onset, duration, severity, seriousness, the relationship of the 
event to the trial treatment, anticipated or not, and any treatment required. All serious 
adverse events occurring during the course of the first 30 days post -transplant will be 
documented on the appropriate electronic case report form(s) in REDCap. Heart graft -
related AEs will be recorded up to the 30 -day follow -up or through hospital discharge if 
longer than 30 days. The principal investigator is responsible for the classification and 
reporting of heart graft -related adverse events to the appropriate regulatory authorities.  
 
A SAE is any AE that in the view of the Investigator r esults in death, i s life-threatening , 
requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization.  In the 
interest of patient safety, and in order to fulfill regulatory require ments, all SAEs  (regardless 
of their relationship to the study procedures ) will be documented and reported per IRB 
guidelines.  In the interest of this study, the SAEs that meet the stopping rule criteria within 
the DSMB Charter, will be submitted to the DSMB for review.  
 
Page 12 of 13  
HRP -652-Protocol Template_Investigator -Initiated Clinical Research_ 09/25/2020 
 
 Heart -graft related -AEs will be captured in this study . The investigator will assess the 
relationship of the AE to the SherpaPak Cardiac Transport System or to the standard of care 
methods of preservation. The relationship will be assesse d using the following categories:  
• Definitely Related: There is a reasonable causal and temporal relationship between preservation with the SherpaPak Cardiac Transport System and the adverse event.  
• Probably Related: It is more likely than not that there is a reasonable causal 
relationship between preservation with the SherpaPak Cardiac Transport System and 
the adverse event.  
• Possibly Related: There is a reasonable relationship with preservation with the 
SherpaPak Cardiac Transport System and the adverse even t, but the causal 
relationship is unclear or lacking.  
• Unlikely Related: There is a temporal relationship with preservation with the 
SherpaPak Cardiac Transport System and the adverse event, but there is not a 
reasonable causal relationship between the trial device and the event.  
• Unrelated: There is no relationship between preservation with the SherpaPak Cardiac 
Transport System and the adverse event.  
 The investigator will rate the severity of the adverse event using the following categories:  
• Mild: The adve rse event is transient and/or easily tolerated by the subject.  
• Moderate: The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the 
subject's usual activities.  
• Severe: The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's usual 
activities.  
 During the trial, investigators will be responsible for complete and accurate entry of data 
into the trial’s REDCap database, and will maintain on file the following accurate, complete 
and current records relating to this trial:  
• All relevant corre spondences and required reports that pertain to the trial  
• Records of receipt, use or disposition of the investigational device, including the type 
and quantity of the device; the dates of receipt; the lot number; the names of all 
persons who received, used or disposed of each device; and why and how any units 
of the device have been returned to the Sponsor, repaired, or otherwise disposed  
• Records of each subject’s case history and exposure to the device  
• Signed and dated consent forms  
• Protocol, and any amend ments  
• Investigator curricul um vitae  
6.2 QUALITY CONTROL AND Q UALITY ASSURANCE  
• The investigator is required to keep accurate records to ensure that the conduct of the study is fully documented. An internal auditor will regularly review the conduct 
of the trial, verify adherence to the protocol, and confirm the completeness, 
consistency, and accuracy of all documented data.

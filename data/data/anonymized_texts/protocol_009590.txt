Stage 2 Study Design:  
This is a randomized, double-blind Phase 2 study to determine the efficacy and safety of three 
different does of PRM -151 in subjects with PMF and post ET/PV MF.  Subjects will be 
randomized to one of three doses: 0.3 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of PRM-151.  This is the second stage of an adaptive design study as defined in FDA Draft Guidance for Industry: Adaptive Design Clinical Trials for Drugs and Biologics, February 2010.  Modifications to 
dose levels, schedule, and regimen have been made in Stage 2 based on data from Stage 1.  
Approximately 84 subjects with intermediate -1, intermediate -2, or high risk MF who meet 
study eligibility requirements will be enrolled and randomized to treatment with single agent PRM -151 at doses of 0.3, 3, or 10 mg/kg IV on Days 1, 3, and 5 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of each 
subsequent 28 day cycle for nine cycles.  The randomization will be stratified according to type of subject (subjects with Hgb < 100 g/L and having received > 2 units PRBC in the 12 
weeks prior to study entry OR subjects with platelet count < 50 x 109/L) and will ensure that 
the final study population will include at least 50% of subjects from the second stratum (platelet count < 50 x 10
9/L).  As outlined in APPENDIX J , all subjects completing 9 cycles of 
the originally assigned treatment may switch to an open label extension and receive PRM -151 
10 mg/kg every 4 weeks.    
• Muta tional Status and Cytogenetics  
 
o Association of baseline mutational status of JAK2V617F, MPLW515, Calreticulin, ASXLI, EZH2, SRSF2, IDH1/2 with selected primary and secondary endpoints  
 
o Changes in allele burden of JAK2V617F at week 36.  Changes in allele burden of MPLW515, Calreticulin, ASXLI, EZH2, SRSF2, IDH1/2 at week 36 will be measured as commercially available assays become available  
 
o Association of baseline cytogenetic abnormalitie s and selected primary 
and secondary endpoints  
• Association of baseline PTX-2 levels with selected primary and secondary endpoints 
 
• Evaluation of potential biomarkers of PRM-151 activity in bone marrow biopsies taken at baseline, weeks 12, 24, and 36 
 
• Meas urement of progression-free and overall survival

 The first cycle of the open label phase contains a loading dose of 10 mg/kg on days 1, 3, and 5. 
This will allow for subjects  from all three dosing cohorts to receive a loading dose of 10 mg/kg 
while maintaining the blind. Additionally, subjects who have entered the open label extension 
study prior to the approval of this amendment may receive a loading dose (10 mg/kg on days 1, 3, and 5), to be administered on their next scheduled cycle after approval of this protocol amendment. This will allow for these s ubjects to receive any potential pharmacologic benefit 
of the loading dose.  
As of 14-Nov 16, w e have blinded safety data, although limited, on 21 subjects receiving a 
similar 10 mg/kg loading dose in the open label of the PRM-151-202 IPF study after 24 weeks 
of exposure to PRM-151 or placebo in 2:1 ratio. No incremental risk has been reported in these subject s.  
 Subjects enrolled in the open-label phase extension protocol of Stage 1 should continue to 
follow the study procedures outlined in APPENDIX L
.  
Enrolled subjects will be considered evaluable for response if they are on study drug for at 
least twelve weeks.  
Study Duration:  
Each subject will participate in the study for approximately 44 weeks.  Participation will 
include a screening evaluation within four weeks prior to the first PRM-151 administration, nine study cycles of four weeks each, and an end of study visit four weeks after the end of the last cycle.  After completion of 9 cycles, subjects may continue with PRM-151 dosing in the open label extension in the absence of disease progression or toxicity warranting discontinuation of therapy. 
It is estimated that the study will be compl eted in approximately 18 months.

 Efficacy Assessments:  
Efficacy will be assessed by evaluation of WHO bone marrow fibrosis grade, changes in 
hemoglobin, platelets, peripheral blood blasts, disease related symptoms, and spleen size. 
 
Safety Assessments:  
Safety will be evaluated from reported adverse events, scheduled physical examinations, vital signs, and clinical laboratory test results.  
 A blinded DMC will be established to review safety data fro m this study, thereby better 
ensuring the safety of study participants. Consistent with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations (FDA Guidance for Industry, Establishment and Operation of 
Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees, 2006), the DMC will be constituted of independent clinicians expert in the field of MF and clinical research.  A formal charter will be established for the conduct of the DMC.  
• The committee is planned to review the safety data in a blinded manner, but a 
procedure wil l be in place to allow the committee an immediate unblinding of either 
specific cases or of the whole study in case of detection of a potential safety signal 
necessitating an unbl inded review of some (or all) subjects.  
Statistical Methods:  
 
General considerations:  
Continuous variables will be summarized by dose group with descriptive statistics  (e.g., 
number of observations, number of missing observations, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, interquartile range , maximum, and minimum).  Categorical variables will be tabulated 
by frequency of subjects per dose group, and percentages will be calculated using the number of available observations as the denominator (i.e. excluding missing values).  
Determination of Sample Size  
The chosen sample size of 7 2 subjects (i.e. 24 subjects per dose arm) is deemed sufficient to 
provide adequate precision to the estimation of the response rate in each treatment arm.  The 
trial will enroll 84 subjects to allow for a discontinuation rate of 15%.  Considerations on the precision of estimate and the power for comparisons planned as secondary analyses are provided in the body of the protocol.  
Randomization and Stratification 
 
This study is randomized with a 1:1:1 randomization ratio.  A central randomization system 
will be used.  The randomization will be stratified according to the subject s’ baseline 
haematologic status: baseline anemia alone or baseline thrombocytopenia or baseline anemia 
associated with baseline thrombocytopenia.  The randomization system will also ensure that at least 50% of the subjects in the final study population will have baseline thrombocytopenia.  
 
Missing values:  
PRM -151 
Study Protocol PRM-151G-101             Protocol Version 6.0 15Dec2016  
12 
 All available efficacy and safety data will be included in data listings and tabulations.  
 
For the primary efficacy criterion, subjects with a reduction in bone marrow fibrosis score by at least one grade according to WHO criteria (central adjudication) at any post baseline visit will be considered as responders.  Subjects without any central assessment of bone marrow fibrosis will be considered as non-responders.  In addition, subjects who discontinue due to 
toxicity prior to completion of one cycle of study drug will be also considered non-responders 
for the efficacy analyses.  
 All other analyses will be based on observed data only; no missing data will be imputed.   
 Efficacy analysis populations: 
The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted on the Full Analysis Set (FAS; all randomized 
subjects having received at least one administration of the study medication with at least one post- baseline assessment of BMRR (primary efficacy criterion) available.  Subjects who 
discontinue due to toxicity prior to completion of one cycle of study drug will also be kept in the FAS and considered non-responders for the efficacy analysis).  A per-protocol analysis will also be carried out on the Per Protocol (PP) set, a subset of the FAS composed of all subjects treated with the investigational medicinal product (IMP), having received at least the planned IMP infusions on days 1, 3, 5, and weeks 4 ,8, and 12 and who did not present any major protocol deviations.  The per -protocol set will be used for secondary analyses of the primary efficacy criterion and 
for the analysis of some selected secondary efficacy criteria.  
 
Primary analysis of efficacy 
The primary efficacy analysis will consist in computing the bone marrow response rate 
(percent of subjects with a reduction in bone marrow fibrosis score by at least one grade) and 
its 97.5% two-sided confidence interval within each treatment arm.  This anal ysis will be 
conducted on the FAS analysis set.  Inferential interpretation: for the 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg arms, the lower limit of the 97.5% two-sided confidence interval will be compared to 10%, a threshold assumed to define the 
minimal clinically relevan t effect.  If the lower limit of the confidence interval is above 10%, 
the corresponding dose will be claimed to have demonstrated clinically relevant efficacy.  
 The confidence intervals computation will use a method consistent with the stratified design.  
 
Comparison of PRR between treatment arms at week 36  
Pairwise comparisons between the three dose groups will be performed using the Cochran-
Mantel -Haenszel (general association) statistic in the SAS Freq  procedure, to take into account 
the stratified design.  
 
Two pairwise comparisons (3 mg/kg versus 0.3 mg/day and 10 mg/kg versus 0.3 mg/day) will be computed with the aim to demonstrating superiority and, consequently, will use an adjusted 
a two -sided 0.02 5 level of significance.

13 
  
The third comparison (10 mg/kg versus 3 mg/kg) is not expected to have enough power to 
demonstrate any difference with the planned sample size.  This comparison is considered exploratory and will be conducted using an unadjusted 0.05 level of significance.  Other efficacy analyses: Sensitivity efficacy analysis, secondary efficacy analyses and 
exploratory efficacy analyses: see body of the protocol.  Safety analyses: see body of the protocol.

 1.  INTROD UCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE  
  1.1. Overview  
Pentraxin -2 (PTX -2), also called Serum Amyloid Protein (SAP) is an endogenous protein that 
circulates in the bloodstream.  Recent discoveries about the biology of tissue repair and fibrosis 
have elucidated the imp ortant role that PTX -2 plays biologically in regulating processes that 
relate to scar prevention and healing.  PTX-2 is an agonist that binds to Fc gamma receptors on monocytes and promotes their differentiation into regulatory macrophages (Mreg), which function to promote epithelial healing and resolution of inflammation and scarring. PTX- 2 also 
prevents the differentiation of monocytes into M2 pro-fibrotic macrophages and fibrocytes, 
preventing the formation of fibrosis. PRM -151 is a recombinant human PTX -2. Pre -clinical and 
clinical data exist to support the investigation of PRM -151 in the treatment of fibrotic diseases. 
Myelofibrosis [including Primary Myelofibrosis (MF), Post- Polycythemia Vera (PV) MF and 
Post- Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) MF] is a clonal myeloprolilferative neoplasm, 
characterized by progressive bone marrow fibrosis and subsequent ineffective erythropoiesis, 
dysplastic megakaryocyte hyperplasia, and extramedullary hematopoiesis. The typical clinical presentation includes marked splenomegaly, progressive anemia, and constitutional symptoms. Bone marrow transplant is the only treatment that can cure subjects with MF, but is associated with high morbidity and mortality (Stewart, Pearce et al. 2010); (Ballen 2012). Bone marrow fibrosis resolves in subjects after successful transplant as early as one month (Przepiorka, Giralt 
et al. 1998). 
Until recently, there was no approved medical therapy for MF and most subjects were managed 
with various combinations of growth factors, immunomodulatory agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and steroids.  None of these therapies produced significant responses in the 
majo rity of subjects.  For this reason, no medication has been approved for MF until recently. 
Ruxolitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor, recently approved in the US and EU for the treatment of 
subjects with intermediate or high -risk myelofibrosis, including primary myelofibrosis (PMF), 
post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (post-PV MF) and post- essential thrombocythemia (post-
ET MF) (JAKAFI® Full Pre scribing Information 2011). Treatment with ruxolitinib results in 
reduction in spleen volume and improvement in constitutional symptoms, but does not appear to have an effect on bone marrow fibrosis, and symptoms return within one week of discontinuing 
the drug. (Verstovsek 2012). Other Janus kinase inhibitors are in clinical development.  There is 
a clear unmet medical need for new therapies that could improve bone marrow fibrosis in subjects with myelofibrosis with a resultant improvement in blood counts and other disease-
related factors .

   1.2.  Preclinical Experience 
    1.2.1. Pharmacology 
Following the initial in vitro  discovery by Gomer and Pilling suggesting that PTX -2 may 
regulate monocyte differentiation into spindle shaped fibrocytes (Pilling, Buckley et al. 2003), 
they, with others, published several studies on the activity of species- specific serum -derived 
PTX -2 in preventing fibrosis in models of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in rats and mice and 
also in a model of i schemia reper fusion injury to mouse heart (Pilling, Roife et al. 2007), 
(Haudek, Xia et al. 2006).  Promedior and its collaborators have expanded the animal fibrosis model data using human serum- derived PTX -2 and PRM-151 to demonstrate potent anti- fibrotic 
activity in models of lung injury, skin injury, kidney injury, liver injury, radiation-induced injury, 
and a rabbit trabeculectomy model of eye injury. 
    1.2.2 Nonclinical Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics  
Promedior, Inc. has used species- specific analytical methods to study the pharmacokinetics of 
human serum-derived PTX-2 and PRM-151 in mice, rats, rabbits, and cynomolgus monkeys by 
different routes of administration.  Dose-proportional increases in systemic exposure of human PTX -2 have been observed in rats following IV dosing.  Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of 
PTX -2 and PRM-151 in rats were compared and found to be equivalent.  In multiple—dose 
studies, no differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were observed between the first and last dose following two doses of PTX-2 in rats and five doses of PRM-151 in rabbits.  Further, the pharmacokinetics  of IV -dosed PRM-151 in monkeys was shown to be comparable to other 
mammalian species.  
The t
1/2 of IV -dosed PTX-2/PRM-151 (2- 7 mg/kg) has been calculated for multiple species, with 
the following results: mouse (4 -8 hr) < rabbit (7.3 hr) < monkey (6- 15 hr) < rat (13 -23 hr) < 
human (30 hr, [human t 1/2 from Promedior single, ascending dose study, PRM151A-11EU; 10 
mg/kg dose in healthy volunteers]) (Hawkins and Pepys 1990). 
    1.2.3. Toxicology 
PRM -151 has been tested in an in vitro  blood compatibility study and found to be non-hemolytic.  
No dose- limiting toxicity was observed following single – or 5 -day repeated -dosing of PRM-151 
in rats or mice up to the limit dose of 200 mg/kg.  Intravenous dosing of PRM-151 to CD- 1 mice 
produced a strong immunogenic response following the third weekly dose.  As a result of this immunogenicity, rats were used as the rodent species for subsequent repeated-dosing toxicity studies.  In a cynomolgus monkey dose range- finding study, renal toxicity was identified in one 
out of four animals at the end of the single, escalating dose portion of the study.  Due to the design of the study, a definitive no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) could not be determined. Based on findings from the dose range-finding study, the top dose for the definitive 
repeat -dose study in monkeys was reduced to 120 mg/kg. 
A definitive 14-day intravenous dose study in Sprague Dawley rats demonstrated no adverse 
toxicological effects at doses ranging from 10 to 200 mg/kg/day. Neurobehavioral evaluations (functional observational battery) conducted during this study identified no treatment- related 
PRM -151

26 
 findings.  No adverse toxicological effects were identified in a definitive 14 -day intravenous 
dose study in cynomolgus monkeys at doses ranging from 12 to 120 mg/kg/day.  Histological 
examination of the kidneys identified no renal toxicity in any of the 28 study animals dosed for 14 days with PRM-151.  Electrocardiography measurements collected during this study were 
qualitatively and quantitatively normal with no abnormalities in rhythm.   
In chronic toxicology studies in Sprague Dawley rats (1368-010) and cynomolgus monkeys 
(1368-011), PRM-151 was initially dosed at 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg IV bolus on Days 1, 3, 5, 8 and weekly thereaft er for 26 weeks. Findings from the rat study (1368-010) and the monkey 
study (1368-011) included signs and symptoms in both rats and monkeys consistent with acute infusion reactions at 50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg dose levels.  These reactions were observed at all time points in the rat, with deaths occurring on days 15 and 22.  Following a modification of the protocol to reduce the highest dose to 150 mg/kg and to lengthen the infusion time from 5 minutes to 30 minutes, infusion reactions were signifi cantly decreased and no 
further deaths occurred. 
Acute reactions in the monkey chronic toxicology study (1368-011) were first observed at the 
200 mg/kg dose level on day 15, with continued occurrence on Days 15, 22, and 29.  Most reactions resolved within ten minutes with therapeutic diphenhydramine, but deaths of two monkeys, one at 50 and one at 100 mg/kg, resulted in termination of the study. 
These findings were unexpected because no acute infusion reactions, dose limiting toxicities, or 
deaths occurred in two prior GLP studies of 14 consecutive daily doses of PRM-151 in rats and 
monkeys, and because PRM- 151 has already been administered safely to humans (as a single 
dose to 18 healthy volunteers and 3 subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and for multiple doses on days 1, 3, 5, 8 and 15 to 15 subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis). In studies 1368-010 and 1368-011, PRM-151 manufactured at CMC Biologics at the 2500 L scale and formulated at the testing site was administered to rats and mo nkeys on days 1, 3, 5, 8 and 
weekly thereafter.  In prior GLP toxicology studies, PRM-151 DS manufactured at Catalent Biosciences at the 200 L scale with no additional formulation was administered to rats and monkeys on days 1-14. Both prior clinical studies utilized GMP drug product manufactured at Catalent Biosciences at the 200 L scale.   To determine if the unexpected findings in studies 
1368-010 and 1368-011 were due to differences in drug product or to differences in dosing schedule, and to explore mitigation of acute reactions by slower infusion rates, study 1368-012 was conducted. 
Study 1368-012 in rats, assessed the frequency and severity of acute infusion reactions to both 
formulations of PRM-151 on both daily and weekly dosing schedules, and invest igated the 
benefit of slower infusion rates in mitigation of acute toxicity.  Animals in all arms received 200 mg/kg of PRM -151.  Severe acute infusion reactions and deaths identical to the events in study 
1368-010 occurred only on the intermittent bolus schedules and with all forms of PRM-151, indicating that the unexpected acute infusion reactions and deaths observed in studies 1368-010 and 1368-011 were due to intermittent dosing rather than product differences.  Prolonging the rate of infusion to 60 minutes significantly reduced the frequency and severity of infusion

27 
 reactions and no deaths occurred in animals receiving PRM -151 at the 60 minute infusion rate.  
The increased toxicity with intermittent dosing is most likely due to enhanced immunogenicity in 
the context of cross-species reactivity to a foreign protein.  Immunogenicity of human proteins in 
animals is generally not predictive of reactions in humans. 
In the Phase 1 ascending, single IV -dose study in humans (described in 1.3.1), a 10 mg/kg dose 
produced a mean AUC 0-∞ 3,005 µg*/hr/mL. Following the first IV dose in the 14- day 
toxicology studies, AUC 0-24 was 16,237 µg*/hr/mL in rats and 8,081 µg*hr/mL in monkeys, 
establishing safety margins of 5.4-fold and 2.7-fold, respectively.  Due to the design of the 14-
day toxicology studies (daily dosing), AUC 0-∞ could not be calculated, and the AUC  0-24 is an 
underestimation of total systemic exposure.  Therefore, these calculated safety margins are 
expected to be conservative estimates.  
 1.3. Clinical Experience 
PRM -151 has been evaluated in humans by intravenous administration in a Phase 1, single-
ascending dose study in healthy subjects and subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF; 
PRM151A-11EU) and in a Phase 1, Multiple Ascending Dose Study in subjects with IPF (PRM151F-12GL) and in Stage 1 of PRM-151G-101, PRM-151 has also been evaluated in 
humans as a sub-conjunctival injection in a randomized, double- masked, placebo -controlled 
study of PRM-151 in the Prevention of Postoperative Scarring in Glaucoma Subjects Following 
Primary Trabeculectomy (PRM151B-21GL). The relevance to humans of acute infusion reactions observed in ongoing non-clinical toxicology studies is unknown; the reactions occurred at doses significantly higher than the dose intended in this study, and in vivo studies of recombinant human proteins in conventional animals are not particularly useful to access the immunogenicity and risk of hypersensitivity reactions in humans since they are foreign to the animals.  In Stage 1 of PRM-151G-101, two subjects each experienced a single, non-serious, Grade 2 hypersensitivity event, related to PRM -151.  Both events were managed with 
medication.  One subject developed the infusion reaction on Day 58 and continued to be treated with PRM -151.  The other subject developed the infusion reaction on day 225 during the 
extension study.  The hypersensitivity reactions to date have occurred as isolated events and have 
been manageable (refer to Investigator’ s Brochure for details). 
    1.3.1 Single Asc ending Dose Study  
The results of the single -ascending dose study indicate that single doses of PRM-151 
administered intravenously at doses of 0.1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg are safe and well tolerated.  In this 
study, the plasma concentrations of PRM- 151 were measu rable only above 0.5 mg/kg dose.  The 
exposure to PRM-151 increased with dose and its half- life was 3 0 hours in healthy subjects.  
PRM -151 showed limited volume of distribution in healthy subjects.  Pharmacokinetics of PRM-
151 were similar in healthy subje cts and IPF subjects following the 10 mg/kg dose. 
    1.3.2 Multiple Ascending Dose Study  
The results of multiple -ascending dose study indicate that doses of PRM-151 administered by 
intravenous infusion over 30 minutes at doses of 1.0 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg on days 1, 3, 5, 8 and 15 are safe and well-tolerated.  The most common AEs in the PRM -151 treated subjects 
PRM -151 
Study Protocol PRM-151G-101             Protocol Version 6.0 15Dec2016  
28 
 were cough (n=7; 47%), productive cough (n=4; 27%) and dizziness (n=4; 27%), followed by 
fatigue (n=3; 20%) and headache (n=3; 20%).  The incidences of these events were similar in the placebo group (cough, 33%, productive cough, 33%; dizziness, 17%, fatigue, 17% and headache, 17%).  Treatment emergent events of cough, dysphonia and hypotension were numerically more frequent in test article -treated subjects than in placebo- treated subjects . They occurred in PRM-
151 treated subjects with the following frequencies: cough 40% (n=6), dysphonia 13% (n=2), hypotension 13% (n=2).  No placebo treated subjects reported a treatment emergent adverse event of dysphonia or hypotension, and the frequency of cough was 17% (n=1).  Frequency of treatment emergent productive cough was 33% (n=2) in the placebo treated subjects and 27% (n=4) in PRM-151 treated subjects. 
    1.3.3. Phase 2 Glaucoma Study  
The results of the randomized study of PRM-151 in glaucoma following trabeculectomy indicate that PRM -151 administered as a subconjunctival injection post-operatively on Days 1, 2, 3, 5 and 
9 is safe and well -tolerated.  The majority of adverse events that occurred were ocular events that 
were reported at similar rates for placebo and PRM-151 treated subjects. The most common AE 
reported was intraocular pressure increased occurring in 15 subjects (24.2%) in the PRM-151 group and 13 subjects (21.0%) in the placebo group.  The majority of adverse events were mild to moderate in severity, and most were not considered related to study drug.  A total of 20 serious adverse events have been reported in 14 subjects; none of the SAEs were considered 
related to study drug.

Brochure for PRM -151. 
 
1.4. Study Rationale  
PTX -2 and PRM-151 have demonstrated the ability to reduce pre- existing fibrosis in multiple 
pre-clinical models in different fibrotic diseases, including TGF -β1 and bleomycin-induced lung 
fibrosis, unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) induced 
renal fibrosis, and radiation induced oral mucositis.  The pathogenesis of fibrosis in 
myelofibrosis is not well understood, but preliminary data suggests that, similar to other fibrotic 
diseases, insufficient production of PTX-2 may play a role.  In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), for example, studies have shown that subjects with IPF have lower levels of PTX-2 than healthy volunteers, and lower levels of PTX- 2 are associated wit h poorer lung function in IPF 
subjects (Murray, Chen et al.2011). 
Until recently, the fibrosis in myelofibrosis was thought to be “reactive;” with overproduction of 
cytokines by malignant cells stimulating fibroblast-like cells derived from non- malignant 
mesenchymal stromal cells.  This hypothesis has been weakened by the fact that ruxolitinib, which causes significant reduction of PMF-associated cytokine levels, does not appear to affe ct 
bone marrow fibrosis (Verstovsek, Kantarjian et al. 2010). Verstovsek et al  (Verstovsek 2013, 
manuscript in preparation) have recently reported findings that suggest that bone marrow derived fibrocytes from subjects with myelofibrosis come from the malignant clone rather than from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs).  Clonal n eoplastic fibrocytes were identified in bone 
PRM -151 
Study Protocol PRM-151G-101             Protocol Version 6.0 15Dec2016  
29 
 marrows of subjects with PMF, and Jak2 mutations and chromosomal abnormalities present in 
the malignant clones in several subjects were present in the bone marrow derived fibrocytes but not in the MSCs. Furthermore, serum PTX- 2 levels were significantly lower in subjects with 
PMF than healthy volunteers, and PTX-2 inhibited differentiation of monocytes from PMF bone marrows into fibroc ytes in vitro.  Data with PRM -151 in other fibrotic disease models combined 
with these findings in PMF subject bone marrows support investigation of PRM-151 in subjects 
with PMF.  
PRM -151 differs from traditional mAb-based antagonist drugs.  Preclinical pharmacology and in 
vitro  cell biology indicate that PTX -2 acts as a partial agoni st of Fc yR signal ing in 
monocytes/macrophages, stimulating their differentiation into a protective regulatory state (Mreg ); these cells then secrete IL -10 locally in the tissues. For this reason, it is likely that the 
optimal dose scheduling of PRM- 151 will not follow a direct PK/PD relationship that is typical 
of mAb -based antagonists.  Instead, our data indicate that a threshold dosing interval must be 
achieved for PRM -151 in order to effectively modulate the monocyte/macrophage populations in 
tissues, but once modulated, the biologic activity is long lasting.  This suggests that intermittent dosing of PRM-151 will be effec tive to produce the desired pharmacologic effect.  In preclinical 
models of lung fibrosis, efficacy was seen at 1.6 mg/kg of mouse PTX-2 in mice, at 1.6 mg/kg of rat PTX -2 in rats and at 6-10 mg/kg of human PTX- 2 in mice.  Efficacy was also observed 
follow ing abbreviated therapeutic dose schedules of PTX -2 in both the mouse TGF-β1 lung 
fibrosis model and in the mouse bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model, further supporting the hypothesis that intermittent dosing of PRM -151 may be feasible.  Importantly, the beneficial 
effects of PTX -2 appear to last well beyond the period of treatment.  In a study of PRM-151 in 
TGFβ1 continuous lung injury model of pulmonary fibrosis, mice were treated with vehicle or PRM -151 10 mg/kg on days 10, 11, and 12 and sacrificed on either Day 21 or Day 42; vehicle 
treated mice had progressive increase in lung collagen from Day 10 through Day 42, whereas PRM -151 treated mice had only a modest increase in lung collagen on Day 21, which remained 
stable through Day 42, resulting in a s tatistically significant difference in lung collagen between 
vehicle and PR M-151 treated mice at Day 42  (Study 11-014, 2012). 
Nonclinical studies have been conducted to gain an understanding of the relationship between a minimal effective dose, dose schedule and PRM -151’s pharmacodynamics effects.  Study 06-
002, “Effect of hSAP on TGF-β1 Induced Lung Fibrosis in Mice,” dosed h PTX-2 every 2 days from day -1 to day 13.  The TGF-β1 induced increase in total lung collagen was reduced by 
greater than 50% at the 6 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg dose groups.  The 2 mg/kg dose group had no effect in this model, suggesting that the minimal efficacious h PTX -2 dose level in this model 
was 2 -6 mg/kg. Study 08-042, “Effects of delayed dosing of hSAP on TGF-β1-induced 
pulmonary fibrosis in mice” dosed h PTX-2 at 6 mg/kg every 2 days from day 4 to day 10.  The TGF -β1-induced increase in total lung collagen was again reduced by greater than 50%, and the 
durability of effect lasted through the end of study at Day 21, 11 days after dosing was stopped.  
Similarly, PRM -151 was dosed for 3 consecutive days starting on Day 11 in Study 08-034, 
“Local Delivery and Altered PRM -151 Dose Schedules in a Bleomycin Model”.  In this model of 
established lung disease, lung collagen levels were reduced in all dose groups; however, the 
group dosed with PRM-151 daily on days 11-13 showed the most pronounced reduction in 
PRM -151 
Study Protocol PRM-151G-101             Protocol Version 6.0 15Dec2016  
30 
 collagen deposition.  The durability of the effect of human PTX-2 following dosing in this model 
was also demonstrated to last through end of study at day 21.  These data support PRM-151 
dosing frequencies of every two weeks at a dose level of 2 -6 mg/kg.  
Dose ranging studies in the bleomycin lung model in rats and mice have recently been 
completed, and indicate that doses of PRM-151 higher than 10 mg/kg are less effective than doses in the 2-10 mg/kg range, and that doses < 0.5 mg/kg are ineffective in these species.  In an 
in vitro  assessment of PRM-151 in mouse and human fibrocyte assays, the IC 50 of PRM -151 is 
2.0 µg/ml for mouse fibrocytes and 0.2 µg/ml for human fibrocytes, indicating that PRM-151 is more potent in humans than in mice.  PRM-151 is also more potent in human fibrocytes than endogenous human PTX- 2.  Preclinical and clinical data suggest a potentially effective dose 
range of  PRM -151 in humans of 0.2 to 10 mg/kg. 
In a recently completed Phase 1, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study of PRM -151 in subjects with IPF (PRM151F-12GL), PRM- 151 was well tolerated at 
all doses tested.  Subjects in all three PRM -151 dose groups demonstrated improvement in 
Percent Predicted Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) at Day 57 after receiving PRM -151 on Days 1, 3, 
5, 8 and 15.  Mean change from baseline in Percent Predicted FVC at Day 57 was + 2.4 (SD 3.8) for all PRM -151 treated subjects and -1.5 (SD 3) for placebo treated subjects (p=0.0524) 
(PRM151F-12GL Draft Clinical Study Report, 2012). 
The PRM -151 dose and administration schedule for Stage 1 was chosen based upon the Phase 1 
multiple ascending dose study in IPF, in which subjects received up to 10 mg/kg PRM-151 on 
days 1, 3, 5, 8 and 15.  Preclinical data supports dosing at two week intervals after an initial 
“loading” period.  In the multiple-ascending dose study, PRM- 151 was safe and well -tolerated, 
with no increase in toxicity with increasing dose levels and no acute infusion reactions.  Vertsovsek et al (manuscript in preparation) have demonstrated that bone marrow derived fibrocytes from PMF subjects are less sensitive to PTX -2 than fibrocytes from normal bone 
marrow, suggesting that more intense dosing may be required for a disease modifying effect.  
This study will evaluate an every four week dosing schedule, following a loading period.

1.5  Rationale for Stage 2 Changes  
All treatment arms in Stage 1 of PRM -151G-101 met the pre- specified efficacy criteria of > 1 
response to be considered for continued evaluation in Stage 2. Key findings from Stage 1 that led 
to the changes for Stage 2 are list ed below. 
• Overall response rate was 43% at 24 weeks and 50% at 36 weeks 
o At 36 weeks of treatment  
 10 Bone Marrow responses 
 4 IWG Symptom responses 
PRM -151

31 
  10/17 subjects with baseline Hgb < 10 g/L and/or PLT < 50 x 109/L 
showed improvement in Hgb and/or PLT 
• There was no apparent difference in efficacy or safety between PRM -151 administered 
once a week or every four weeks  
• Hematologic improvements were more common with PRM -151 alone 
• Most subjects had improvements in symptoms and modest reductions in splenomegaly, 
although not meeting IWG response criteria 
• PRM -151 was very well tolerated both as a single agent and added to ruxolitinib, 
although adverse events were more common in the subjects also receiving ruxolitinib 
Based on these results, the following changes have been made for Stage 2:  
Design element  Stage 1  Stage 2  Rationale  
Primary Objective  Evaluate the efficacy 
of two different dose 
schedules of PRM-151 in intermediate-1, intermediate -2, or 
high risk subjects with PMF, post- PV

who are not receiving therapy for MF, and in subjects with PMF, post-PV MF, or post ET-MF on a sta ble 
dose of ruxolitinib for at least three months.  To determine the

high risk subjects with PMF, post- PV

who are anemic or thrombocytopenic and who are ineligible for, intolerant of, or have had an inadequate response to 
ruxolitinib.  Single agent efficacy 
at 10 mg/kg every 4 weeks supports continued evaluation

 Subjects with 
clinically significant anemia or thrombocytopenia had the greatest benefit in Stage 1, and will provide the best opportunity to define the clinical benefit of PRM-151

Duration  24 weeks  36 weeks  Improvements in 
bone marrow fibrosis, hemoglobin, and platelets were all greater at 36 weeks than at 24 weeks, suggesting that PRM -
151 effects improve over time and that clinical benefit may 
be underestimated at

for independent 
assessment of anemic and thrombocytopenic 
subjects.

The remainder of this protocol amendment applies only to Stage 2. Please refer to APPENDIX K  
for more information on Stage 1and APPENDIX L  for Stage 1 Open Label Extension . 
In the stage 2 study, all subjects completing 9 cycles of the originally assigned treatment may 
switch to an open label extension and receive PRM-151 10 mg/kg every 4 weeks.  The first cycle 
of the open label phase contains a loading dose of 10 mg/kg on days 1, 3 and 5.  This will allow 
for subject s from all three dosing cohorts to receive a loading dose of 10 m g/kg  while 
maintaining the blind.  Additionally, subjects who have entered the open label extension study 
prior to the approval of this amendment may receive a loading dose (10 mg/kg on days 1, 3, and 5), to be administered on their next scheduled cycle after approval of this protocol amendment. This will allow for these subjects to receive any potential pharmacologic benefit of the loading dose. As of 14-Nov 16, w e have blinded safety data, although limited, on 21 patients receiving a 
similar 10 mg/kg loading dose in the open label of the PRM -151-202 IPF study after 24 weeks of 
exposure to PRM-151 or placebo in 2:1 ratio. No incremental risk has been reported in these 
subjects.

 4.  OVERALL STAGE 2 STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN 
   4.1.1. Study Design:  
 
Stage 2: This is a randomized, double-blind Phase 2 study to determine the efficacy and safety of 
three different does of PRM -151 in subjects with PMF and post ET/PV MF.  Subjects will be 
randomized to one of three doses: 0.3 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of PRM-151.  This is the second stage o f an adaptive design study as defined in FDA Draft Guidance for Industry: 
Adaptive Design Clinical Trials for Drugs and Biologics, February 2010.  Modifications to dose 
levels, schedule, and regimen have been made in Stage 2 based on data from Stage 1. 
Approximately 84 subjects with intermediate -1, and intermediate -2, or high risk MF who meet 
study eligibility requirements will be enrolled and randomized to treatment with single agent 
PRM -151 at doses of 0.3, 3, or 10 mg/kg IV on Days 1, 3, 5 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of each 
subsequent 28 day cycle for nine cycles. 
All subjects  completing 9 cycles of the originally assigned treatment may switch to an open label 
extension and receive PRM -151 10 mg/kg every 4 weeks.  The first cycle of the open label phase 
contai ns a loading dose of 10 mg/kg on days 1, 3 and 5. This will allow for subjects from all 
three dosing cohorts to receive a loading dose of 10 mg/kg while maintaining the blind. 
Additionally, subjects who have entered the open label extension study prior to the approval of this amendment may receive a loading dose (10 mg/kg on days 1, 3, and 5), to be administered on their next scheduled cycle after approval of this protocol amendment. This will allow for these subjects to receive any potential pharmacologic benefit of the loading dose.    
Enrolled subjects will be considered evaluable for response if they are on study drug for at least 
twelve weeks.  
The Schedule of Events can be found in APPENDIX A
. 
   4.1.2. Subject Assignment to  Treatment Groups  
Subjects will be randomized to one of three doses of PRM-151.  The randomization will be 
stratified according to type of baseline hematologic abnormality (subjects with Hgb < 100g/L 
and having received > 2 units PRBC in the 12 weeks prior to study entry OR subjects with 
platelet count < 50 X 109/L) and will ensure that the final study population will include at least 
50% of subjects from the second stratum (platelet count < 50 X 109/L).

42 
     
   4.1.3. Study Duration  
 
Each subject will participate in the study for approximately 44 weeks.  Participation will include 
a screening evaluation within four weeks prior to the first PRM-151 administration, nine study 
cycles of four weeks each, and an end of study visit four weeks after the end of the last cycle.  
All subjects may switch to a n open label extension utilizing the 10 mg/kg dose after completing 
9 cycles of the originally assigned treatment.  Subjects may continue with PRM-151 dosing in 
the absence of disease progression or toxicity warranting discontinuation of therapy. Please see APPENDIX J
 for details.  
It is estimated that the study will be completed in approximately 18 months.

6. STAGE 2 STUDY TREATMENT(S)  
 6.1.  Investigational Product  
PRM -151 will be supplied by Promedior as a solution for Injection. 
 6.2. Treatment(s) Administered  
All subjects will receive intravenous (IV) infusions of 0.3 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg PRM -
151, with dose based on the subject’s weight on Day 1 for Days 1, 3 and 5 of Cycle 1, and all 
subsequent doses based on the subjects’ weight on the first day of each cycle. Subjects will be observed for one hour after each dose.  Refer to the Pharmacy Manual and the Investigator’s 
Brochure for detailed instruct ions on special precautions and handling. 
PRM -151 
Study Protocol PRM-151G-101             Protocol Version 6.0 15Dec2016  
45 
 PRM -151 will be held for any treatment emergent Grade 3 non- hematologic or any Grade 4 
adverse event and resumed when adverse event has resolved to Grade 1 or baseline.  
6.3. Dose for Each Subject  
Subjects will be randomized to treatment with single agent PRM -151 at doses 0.3, 3, or 10 mg/kg 
IV administered as a 60 minute intravenous infusion on Days 1, 3, and 5 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of 
each subsequent 28 day cycle for nine cycles. 
For OLE dosing ref er to Appendix J.  
 
 6.4. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects will be randomized to treatment cohorts in a double -blind fashion.  Randomization will 
be accomplished using an interactive response system (IRS). The IRS will contain the 
randomization schedule.  At the screening visit, the investigative site will contact IRS.  The site will enroll the subject into the IRS by indicating minimal information to sufficiently distinguish one subject from another and will receive the subject ID number. At the Cycle 1, Day 1 visit, the unblinded pharmacist (or designee)  will access IRS to randomize the subject.  The system will 
associate that subject with the next available treatment on the randomization schedule.  IRS will 
inform the unblinded pharmacist (or designee) to which PRM -151 dose the subject has been 
assigned.  
The unblinded pharmacist will contact IRS at each dosing visit.  The randomization schedule 
allows for overage, such as enrollment, which will be controlled by IRS and when a sufficient 
number of subjects have been enrolled, the randomization part of the system will be stopped.  The 
portion of the system that manages re -supply will remain active until the last subject completes 
the study. 
 
6.5. Blinding  
This study will be Subject, Investigator, Assessor (central adjudication panel of expert 
hematopathologi sts) and Sponsor -blinded.  The site Pharmacist will be unbl inded to the dose 
assignment.  Additional details regarding procedures for maintaining the blind can be found in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
   6.5.1. Breaking the Blind  
Blinding should only be broken in emergency situations for reasons of subject safety.  Whenever 
possible, the Investigator should attempt to contact the Promedior Medical Monitor before breaking the blind.  When the blind is broken, the reason must be fully documented in the source documents and entered into the eCRF as applicable.  At all other times treatment and randomization information will be kept confidential and will not be release to the Investigator/blinded study staff until conclusion of the stud y.

7.13.1 Definitions of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
PRM -151 
Study Protocol PRM-151G-101             Protocol Version 6.0 15Dec2016  
53 
  
7.13.1.1 Adverse Event  
An AE is any noxious, pathologic, or unintended change in anatomical, physiologic, or metabolic 
function as indicated by physical signs, symptoms, or laboratory changes occurr ing in any phase 
of a clinical study, whether or not considered investigational product -related.  This includes an 
exacerbation of a pre -existing condition. 
 Adverse events include:  
• Worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of conditions present at the onset of the study; 
• Intercurrent illnesses;  
• Drug interactions; 
• Events related to or possibly related to concomitant medications; 
• Abnormal laboratory values (this includes significant shifts from baseline within 
the range of normal that the Investi gator considers to be clinically important); 
• Clinically significant abnormalities in physical examination, vital signs, and 
weight.  
Throughout the study, the Investigator must record all AEs on the AE eCRF, regardless of the severity or relationship to investigational product.  The Investigator should treat subjects with AEs appropriately and observe them at suitable intervals until the events stabilize or resolve.  Adverse events may be discovered through observation or examination of the subject, questioning of the 
subject, complaint by the subject, or by abnormal clinical laboratory values. 
In addition, AEs may also include laboratory values that become significantly out of range.  In the 
event of an out -of-range value, the laboratory test should be repea ted until it returns to normal or 
can be explained and the subject’s safety is not at risk.  
Additional illnesses present at the time when informed consent is obtained are regarded as concomitant illnesses and will be documented on the appropriate pages of the eCRF.  Illnesses 
first occurring or detected during the study, and worsening of a concomitant illness during the 
study, are to be regarded as AEs and must be documented as such in the CRF. 
Infusion reactions were reported in two subjects in Stage 1 of this study. In the event of acute 
hypersensitivity or other infusion reaction, institutional protocol should be initiated and a blood sample drawn for anti -PTX -2 antibodies and cytokines.  Signs and symptoms of an infusion 
reaction may include the followin g: headache, fever, facial flushing, pruritus, myalgia, nausea, 
chest tightness, dyspnea, vomiting, erythema, abdominal discomfort, diaphoresis, shivers, hypertension, hypotension, lightheadedness, palpitations, urticaria and somnolence. Although 
unlikely, serious allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) may occur at any time during the infusion. 
In the case of Grade 2 occurrence of signs and symptoms consistent with infusion related reaction, 
follow institutional protocol and reduce the rate of infusion of P RM-151 to half the initial rate; 
consider discontinue infusion of PRM -151 if symptoms do not respond to medical intervention. If 
PRM -151 
Study Protocol PRM-151G-101             Protocol Version 6.0 15Dec2016  
54 
 signs and symptoms resolve with intervention including discontinuation of PRM -151, PRM -151 
infusion may be restarted at half the initial rate.  
In the case of Grade 3 or greater occurrence of signs and symptoms consistent with infusion related 
reaction, discontinue infusion of PRM-151. 
If PRM -151 resulted in signs and symptoms consistent with Grade 2 or 3 Infusion related reaction, 
infuse PRM -151 over 1 hour and use the following premedication for all subsequent PRM -151 
administration: 
a. Diphenhydramine 50 mg IV or clemastine 2 mg IV or an equivalent dose of an 
antihistaminic drug   
b. Dexamethasone 10 mg IV or an equivalent corticosteroid  
Infusion related reactions must be reported to Promedior as described in section 7.13.2.1.1, 
Reporting of Adverse Events of Special Interest. 
7.13.1.2. Serious Adverse Event  
A serious AE (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death;  
• Is life -threatening; 
• Requires hospitalization; 
• Requires prolongation of existing hospitalization; 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions; 
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect;  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize 
the subject and may require medical or s urgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
in this definition.  A life -threatening AE is defined as an AE that placed the subject, in the view of 
the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred (i.e., it does not  include 
an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death).  
7.13.1.3. Classification of Adverse Events and Serious 
Adverse Events  
The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE) 
Version 4.0  grading scale ( APPENDIX I ) should be referenced when assessing the intensity of an 
AE.  If an AE is not described in the NCI CTCAE v 4.0, the severity should be recorded based on 
the scale below.  The severity of all AEs/SAEs should be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page 
as Grade 1, 2, 3, or 4 corresponding, respectively, to a severity of mild, moderate, severe, or life 
threatening as outlined in Table 3 .

55 
 Table 3: Adverse Event Grading
Severity      Definition
 
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or  
diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive 
intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental ADL.  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of 
hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care 
ADL.   
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention 
indicated.  
Grade 5  Death related to AE.  
     
Clarification between Serious and Severe: The term “severe” is often used to describe the 
intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the 
event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical signif icance (such as severe headache).  
This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on the outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) and 
causality serve as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
7.13.1.4. Data Monitoring Committee  
A DMC  will be established to review safety data from this study, thereby better ensuring the safety 
of study participants.  Consistent with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  recommendations 
(FDA Guidance for Industry, Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring 
Committees, 2006), the DMC will be constituted of independent clinicians expert in the field of MF and clinical research.  A formal charter will be established for the conduct of the DMC. 
The committee is planned to review  unblinded safety data at periodic intervals. The DMC may ask 
to schedule ad -hoc meetings as needed. No interim efficacy data are planned to be reviewed by the 
DMC.  Details of safety review are provided in the DMC Charter.  
7.13.1.5. Relatedness of Adverse Events and Serious 
Adverse Events  
Relationship of an AE or SAE to investigational product is to be determined by the Investigator 
based on the definitions in Table 4
. 
PRM -151 
Study Protocol PRM-151G-101             Protocol Version 6.0 15Dec2016  
56 
 Table 4:  Adverse Event Relatedness  
Relationship to Product(s)  Definition
 
Not Related    Unrelated to investigational product. 
 
Possibly Related  A clinical event or laboratory abnormality with a reasonable time 
sequence to administration of investigational product, but which  could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or 
chemicals.  
Probably Related  A clinical event or laboratory abnormality with a reasonable time 
sequence to  admi nistration of investigational product, unlikely to be 
attributable to concurrent  disease or other drugs and chemicals and 
which follows a clinically reasonable response on de -challenge.  The 
association of the clinical event or laboratory abnormality must  
also have some biologic plausibility, at least on theoretical grounds.  
 
 
7.13.2. Procedures for Recording and Reporting Adverse 
Events  
 
7.13.2.1. Adverse Event Monitoring and Period of  
Observation  
Adverse events (AEs) will be monitored continuously throughout the study. 
 
For the purposes of this study, the period of observation extends from the time at which the subject 
or the subject’s legally authorized representative gives informed consent until the subject’s final evaluation of the study.  If the Investigator considers  it necessary to report an AE in a study subject 
after the end of the safety observation period, he or she should contact the Sponsor to determine how the AE should be documented and reported. 
 
 
 
7.13.2.1.1. Reporting of Adverse Events of Special 
Interest  
The Investigator must report suspected Infusion Related Reaction, regardless of severity, on an 
Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI) form.  This form must be completed and submitted, either by e -mail or fax, immediately but no later than 24 hours of the Investigator’s learning of the 
event to Pivotal’s Safety Unit:  
• e-mail: drugsafety@pivotal.es
 
PRM -151

 • Fax (US SAEs): +1 877 853 3275 
• Fax (non-US SAEs): +34 91 307 60 47 
7.13.2.2. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The I nvestigator must report all SAEs to the Safety Unit of Pivotal S.L. within 24 hours of 
discovery either by e- mail or fax to:  
• e-mail: drugsafety@pivotal.es  
• Fax (US SAEs): +1 877 853 3275 
• Fax (non- US SAEs): +34 91  307 60 47 
A completed SAE report is to be sent to Pivotal’s Safety Unit within 24 hours of discovering the 
event.  The initial report should include at least the following information: 
• Subject’s Study Number; 
• Description and date of the event; 
• Criterion f or serious; and 
• Preliminary assignment of causality to study drug.  
The Safety unit will contact the Investigator either by email or telephone for follow -up information 
regarding the SAE, as appropriate.  
The Investigator must promptly report all required information to the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC )/Research Ethics Boards (REB).  It is the responsibility 
of the Sponsor to ensure that each Investigator receives a copy of any CIOMS I/MedWatch report that has been submitted to the appropriate regulatory agencies notifying them of an unexpected related SAE.  The Investigator or Sponsor must ensure that the IRB/IEC/REB receives a copy of the report and that a copy is also filed within their study files.  
    7.13.3 Reporting Pregnancies  
Pregnancy itself is not considered an AE. If a subject becomes pregnant or the partner of a subject participating in the study becomes pregnant during the study or within 3 months of discontinuing any study drug, the Investigator should report the pregnancy on a separate pregnancy report form provided to the sites.  Only pregnancies occurring from the time of first study treatment dose administered to the subject will be reported and documented. The study treatment will be immediately discontinued for any female subject who becomes pregnant during study participation, if study treatment is ongoing at that time.  The subject/partner should be followed by the Investigator until completion of the pregnancy.  If the pregnancy ends for any reason before 
the anticipated date, the Investigator should notify the Sponsor.  At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy. This pregnancy report form must be completed and submitted, either by e -mail or fax, immediately but no later than 24 
hours of the Investigator’s learning of the event to Pivotal’s Safety Unit: 
 
• e-mail: drugsafety@pivotal.es

 • Fax (US SAEs): + 1 877 853 3275 
• Fax (non-US SAEs): +34 91 307 60 47 
Any pregnancy complication, spontaneous or elective abortion, still birth, neonatal death, or 
congenital anomaly will be recorded as an AE or SAE, and reported, as applicable.  
    7.13.4. Medication Error 
A medication error is defined as a mistake made in prescribing, dispensing, administration and/or 
use of the investigational medicinal product.  All medication errors must be recorded in the eCRF. 
7.14. Removal of Subjects from the Trial or Investigational Produ ct 
A subject’s participation in the study may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the 
Investigator. The following may be justifiable reasons for the Investigator to remove a subject 
from the study: 
• Non-compliance, including failure to appear at one or more study visits; 
• The subject withdraws consent; 
• The subject was erroneously included in the study; 
• The subject develops an exclusion criterion; 
• The subject suffers an intolerable adverse event;  
• The subject becomes pregnant; 
• The study is terminated by the Sponsor. 
The subject is free to withdraw consent and discontinue participation in the study at any time 
without prejudice to further treatment.  If a subject discontinues participation in the study, or the subject is discontinued by the I nvestigator, the Investigator will notify the Sponsor and, when 
possible, will perform the procedures indicated for the final visit.  Follow -up information will be 
obtained during the final telephone contact, if possible, for subjects who discontinue their  
participation in or are withdrawn from the study. 
Any adverse events (AEs) experienced up to the point of discontinuation must be documented on 
the AE eCRF.  If AE’s are present when the subject withdraws from the study, the subject will be re-evaluated w ithin 30 days of withdrawal.  All ongoing SAEs at the time of withdrawal will be 
followed until resolution. 
Subjects withdrawn from the study will be replaced at the discretion of the medical monitor and 
the Investigator.  A replacement subject will be randomized to treatment with single agent PRM -
151 at doses of 0.3, 3, or 10 mg/kg IV.

PRM -151 
Study Protocol PRM-151G-101             Protocol Version 6.0 15Dec2016  
59 
 Subjects will be assessed for safety at all visits based on history, physical examination, and 
laboratory values.  Subjects will be assessed for efficacy every four weeks by hematologic parameters (Hgb, WBC with differential, ANC, and platelet count), measurement of splenomegaly, and symptom assessment, and at Weeks 12, 24, and 36 by bone marrow biopsy to assess change in fibrosis.  Global assessment of fibrosis will be assessed at Baseline, Weeks 12, 
24, and 36 by FDG or FLT PET- CT. 
 
8.0 STAGE 2 STUDY ACTIVITIES  
The Schedules of Events can be found in APPENDIX A . Quality of Life assessments (MPN -SAF 
and EORTC QLQ -C30) should be done as early in the visit as possible and prior to phlebotomy, 
bone marrow biopsy  or any other procedure that may affect subject responses.  In the event the 
central lab cannot be used to get a rel iable result for a laboratory test, local laboratory tests may be 
used after this has been agreed upon by the Medical Monitor.

 9. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND CONTROL  
Training will occur at the site initiation visit; instruction manuals will be provided to aid 
consistency in data collection and reporting across sites.  
Clinical sites will be monitored by the Sponsor or its designee to ensure the accuracy of data against source documents. 
The required data will be captured in a validated clinical data management system that is compliant 
with the FDA 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 11 Guidance.  The clinical trial database 
will include an audit trail to document any evidence of data processing or activity on each data field by each user.  Users will be trained and given restricted access,  based on their role(s) in the 
study, through a password- protected environment.  
Data entered in the system will be reviewed manually for validity and completeness against the source documents by a clinical monitor from the Sponsor or its designee.  If necessary, the study 
site will be contacted for corrections or clarifications; all missing data will be accounted for.

 10. STAGE 2 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
 10.1 Determination of Sample Size  
The chosen sample size of 72 subjects (i.e. 24 subjects per dose arm) is deemed sufficient to 
provide adequate precision to the estimation of the response rate in each treatment arm. The trial 
will enroll 84 subjects to allow for a discontinuation rate of 15%. 
On the basis of the available data, it is assumed that the response rate on the primary endpoint 
will be 5% in the 0.3 mg/kg arm, 46% in the 10 mg/kg arm and at least 46% in the 3 mg/kg arm.  
A sample size of 24 subjects will ensure an absolute precision of +/- 8% to the evaluation of the response rate in the 0.3 mg/kg arm (assuming the response rate is 5%) and an absolute precision 
of +/ - 20% of the response rate in the 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg arms (assuming the response rate is 
46%). 
In addition, with 24 subjects in each arm, the probability to demonstrate that the observed 
response rate in the 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg arms is larger than 10% by comparing the lower limit of the exact 97.5% two-sided confidence interval of the observed rate to 10% is larger than 0.999 
(assuming the response rate is 46%) 
In addition, it is planned to perform pairwise comparisons between dose arms as part of the 
secondary efficacy analysis. A sample size of 24 subjects per arm will ensure a power of 82% to detect a difference of 39% between two treatment arms (assuming the best response rate is 46%) with a two -sided type one error of 0.025. Consequently if the assumption of response rates of 5% 
in the 0.3 mg/kg arm and 46% in the 3 and 10 mg/kg arm is true, the study will be sufficiently 
powered (power = 82%) to demonstrate a significant superiority of any of the higher doses over 
the smallest dose, using an adjusted two-sided 0.025 type- one error rate.  
 
 10.2.  Randomization and Stratification  
This study is randomized with a 1:1:1 randomization ratio.  A central randomization system will 
be used. The randomization will be stratified according to the subje ct’s baseline hematologic 
status : baseline anemia (Hgb < 100 g/L and having received > 2 units PRBC in 12 weeks prior to 
study entry) alone or baseline thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50 x 109/L) alone ; or baseline 
anemia associated with baseline thrombocytopenia.  The randomization system will also ensure that at least 50% of the subjects in the final study population will have baseline 
thrombocytopenia. 
 
10.3.  General considerations for statistical analysis 
   10.3.1 Statistical Analysis Plan  
The statistical section of the protocol presents the main features of the planned statistical 
analysis.  A detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared by the Venn Life Sciences 
PRM -151 
Study Protocol PRM-151G-101             Protocol Version 6.0 15Dec2016  
65 
 statistician, validated by the sponsor and signed before the database lock prior to any unblinded 
statistical analysis.  
Any change to the planned statistical methods will be documented in the clinical study report.  
   10.3.2  Descriptive statistics  
Quantit ative variables will be described by treatment group using the following statistics: 
number of available data, number of missing values, mean, standard deviation, median, Q1, Q3, minimum and maximum values.  When relevant, confidence intervals will also be computed. 
Qualitative variables will be described by treatment group using number of available data, 
number of missing values, frequency counts for each category and corresponding percentage. Percentages will be calculated using the number of available data as the denominator (i.e. not 
including missing values). When relevant, confidence intervals will also be computed. 
 
   10.3.3. Inferential statistics  
The primary efficacy analysis is both descriptive and inferential.  The exact confidence interval 
for the response rate in each arm will be computed and its lower bound will be compared to 10%. 
In addition, one secondary objective of the study is to determine if there is a difference in 
efficacy between the three doses of PRM -151 used in the study. These comparisons will be done 
only if at least one dose arm is demonstrated to have a response rate superior to 10% in the primary analysis. The comparison between the 3 mg/kg arm and 10 mg/kg arm is not expected to be sufficiently powered to detect any statistic ally significant difference. The two main 
comparisons (3 mg/kg arm versus 0.3 mg/kg arm and 10 mg/kg arm versus 0.3 mg/kg) will use an adjusted type-one error rate of 0.025 to control the overall type- one error rate.  The 3 mg/kg 
versus 10 mg/kg comparison will only be provided with an exploratory purpose and will be done 
without correction of the type- one error.  
For all the other secondary efficacy analyses involving formal statistical comparisons, no 
adjustment of the type- one error rate will be conducted. As a consequence, the results of these 
tests will have to be interpreted bearing in mind the issue of multiplicity and the increased risk of erroneously obtaining statistically significant results.  
   10.3.4. Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data  
All available efficacy and safety data will be included in data listings and tabulations. For the 
primary efficacy criterion analysis, subjects with a reduction in bone marrow fibrosis score by at least one grade according to WHO criteria (central adjudication ) at any post baseline visit will be 
considered as responders. Subjects without any central assessment of bone marrow fibrosis will be considered as non-responders.  In addition, subjects who discontinue due to toxicity prior to completion of one cycle of study drug will also be considered non- responders for the efficacy 
analyses.  
PRM -151 
Study Protocol PRM-151G-101             Protocol Version 6.0 15Dec2016  
66 
 Except for the imputation of missing values for the analysis of the primary criterion as described 
above, all other analyses will be based on observed data only; no missing data w ill be imputed.  
   10.3.5. Interim Analyses  
 
There is no interim analysis planned. 
   10.3.6. Software used for statistical analyses 
 The < SAS software, version 9.2 or higher >, will be used for the statistical analysis. 
 
10.4 Protocol deviations  
Major protocol deviations are defined as deviations liable to prevent or change the interpretation 
of the results of the primary efficacy analysis of the study. The following deviations will be 
considered as major (this list is not exhaustive and will be reviewed at the time of the blind review meeting):  
• non compliance with the inclusion or non inclusion criteria 
• non compliance with study treatment 
• no post- baseline data for the primary efficacy endpoint  
• intake of forbidden medication 
 
All other deviations will, a priori, be considered as minor deviations. However, all deviations 
will be reviewed and adjudicated as either major or minor during the blind review meeting before database lock and code break.

67 
  10.5.  Analysis datasets  
The statistical analysis will be conducted on the following subject data sets: 
   10.5.1. Efficacy Analysis Sets: 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will consist in all randomized subjects having received at least one 
administration of the study medication with at least one post- baseline assessment of BMRR 
(primary efficacy criterion) available.  Subjects who discontinue due to toxicity prior to 
completion of one cycle of study drug will also be kept in the FAS and considered non-
responders for the efficacy analysis.  
The full analysis set will be the primary population for the efficacy analyses in this trial.  
The Per Protocol (PP) set:  a subset of the FAS consisting of all subjects who are randomized, 
and who did not present any major protocol deviations, who are evaluable based on having 
received at least 3 cycles of study drug, and who have an ORR measurement. The per -protocol 
set will be used for secondary analyses of the primary efficacy criterion and for the analysis of 
some selected secondary efficacy criteria.  
   10.5.2. Safety Analys is Sets:  
The Safety (SAF) dataset: composed of all randomized subjects having received at least one 
dose of study drug and having a post-baseline safety observation. This data set will be used to 
perform the analysis of safety.  
 10.6.  Planned Statistical Analyses and Methods 
   10.6.1 Efficacy Analyses 
 
10.6.1.1. Primary analysis of efficacy  
The primary efficacy analysis will consist in computing the bone marrow response rate (percent 
of subjects with a reduction in bone marrow fibrosis score by at least one grade, see Section 3.1) and its 95% (unadjusted) and 97.5% (adjusted) two- sided confidence intervals within each 
treatment arm.  This analysis will be conducted on the FAS analysis set.  
Inferenti al interpretation: for the 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg arms, the lower limit of the 97.5% two-
sided confidence interval will be compared to 10%, a threshold assumed to define the minimal clinically relevant effect. If the lower limit of the confidence interval is  above 10%, the 
corresponding dose will be claimed to have demonstrated clinically relevant efficacy.  
The confidence intervals computation will use a method consistent with the stratified design.  
 
10.6.1.2. Sensitivity analyses on the primary endpoint:  
Sensitivity analyses on the FAS: 
PRM -151 
Study Protocol PRM-151G-101             Protocol Version 6.0 15Dec2016  
68 
 To further examine a potential stratum effect, the BMRR and its confidence interval will be 
computed for each dose arm within each stratum, at least for the dose by stratum combination 
cells with sufficiently large sample size s (i.e. greater than 10). 
Sensitivity analyses on the PP set: 
The analysis described above in Section 10.6.1.1. for the primary analysis on the FAS will be 
repeated on the PP analysis.  
10.6.1.3. Secondary and exploratory efficacy analyses:  
 
10.6.1.3.1. Comparison of PRR between 
treatment arms  
Pairwise comparisons between the three dose groups will be performed using the Cochran-
Mantel -Haenszel  (general association) statistic in the SAS Freq procedure, to take into account 
the stratified design, using the following statement: 
   tables Stratum*Treatment*Response / cmh; 
The Breslow -Day Test for Homogeneity of the Odds Ratios will be examined to detect a 
potential significant stratum difference in the odds ratios.   
Two pairwise comparisons (3 mg/kg versus 0.3 mg/day and 10 mg/kg versus 0.3 mg/day) will be 
computed with the aim to demonstrating superiority and, consequently, will use an adjusted a 
two-sided 0.025 level of significance. 
The third comparison (10  mg/kg versus 3 mg/kg) is not expected to have enough power to 
demonstrate any difference with the planned sample size.  This comparison is considered exploratory and will be conducted using an unadjusted 0.05 level of significance. 
These analyses will be computed on both the FAS (primary analysis set) and PP analysis sets.  
10.6.1.3.2. Analyses of categorical secondary and 
exploratory efficacy endpoints:  
Percentages and or rates will be computed, together with their 95% confidence intervals, within 
each treatment arm.  
 
10.6.1.3.3. Analyses of quantitative secondary 
and exploratory efficacy endpoints:  
Descriptive statistics for quantitative variables (see Section 10.3.2) will be computed, together with the 95% CI of the mean (or median depending on the variable) 
PRM -151 
Study Protocol PRM-151G-101             Protocol Version 6.0 15Dec2016  
69 
 10.6.1.3.4. Inferential analyses for secondary and 
exploratory efficacy endpoints:  
For all categorical or quantitative secondary efficacy endpoints, formal pairwise between arms 
comparisons will be computed. These comparisons will use a two-sided 0.05 level of significance, hence without any correction for multiplicity (See section 10.3.3). The results of these tests will have to be interpreted cautiously bearing in mind the issue of multiplicity and the 
increased risk of erroneously obtaining statistically significant results.  
No between arms comparisons will be computed for the exploratory efficacy endpoints, only descriptive analyses will be computed.  
 
   10.6.2. Safety Analysis 
 
Safety evaluations will be based on the incidence, intensity, and type of adverse events , and 
clinically significant changes in the subject’s physical examination, vital signs and clinical 
laboratory results.  Safety variables will be tabulated and presented for all subjects who receive any amount of study medication.  Exposure to study drug and reasons for discontinuation of 
study treatment will be tabulated.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
adverse event coding system for purposes of summarization.  All adverse events occurring on study will be listed in by -subject data listings.  Treatment- emergent events (TEAEs) will be 
tabulated, where treatment -emergent is defined as any adverse event that occurs after 
administration of any amount of study drug, or any event that is present at baseline but worsens in intensity or is subsequently considered drug- related by the Investigator.  By treatment 
tabulations will be performed by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) for deaths if any, serious adverse events; all treatment -emergent adverse events ; TEAEs leading 
to discontinuation of study therapy due to adverse event or toxicity and TEAEs resulting in study 
discontinuation. Events that are considered related to treatment (possibly or probably drug-
related) will also be tabu lated.  Tabulation will also be provided that enumerates adverse events 
by maximum severity.  
Laboratory evaluations will be summarized by time of collection and by treatment group. In 
addition, change from baseline to any post- dose values will be summarize d for vital signs and 
clinical laboratory results.  
The frequency of subjects with abnormal safety laboratory results will be tabulated by treatment. Shift tables for each cycle will be produced for selected laboratory parameters, to include at least 
hemoglobin, WBC count, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets, AST, ALT, bilirubin, LDH, 
creatin ine, alkaline phosphatase and electrolytes. These tables will summarize by cycle and dose 
level the number of subjects with each baseline CTC grade and changes to the maximum CTC 
grade in the cycle.  
PRM -151 
Study Protocol PRM-151G-101             Protocol Version 6.0 15Dec2016  
70 
 Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities will be tabulated or presented in individual data 
listings, depending on their number. 
Vital signs assessments will be summarized over time in a similar fashion to laboratory 
parameters, and any abnormal values will be tabulated.  
   10.6.3. Other Analyses  
 
10.6.3.1. Subject Disposition  
A listing and table of proportions of subjects discontinuing the study for each reason will be provided by treatment / dose group.  Details will be included in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
10.6.3.2. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Summary statistics will be provided for the demographic and baseline characteristics; details will be in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
10.6.3.3. Subject Adher ence and Extent of Exposure 
Compliance with study drug will be computed for each subject as proportion of prescribed study drug actually taken.  Details will be included in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
Extend of exposure: Summary statistics will be provided for overall duration of study treatment, number of injections received and cumulative dose of IP received. 
10.6.3.4. Concomitant Medications  
A listing of table of proportions of subjects taking each concomitant medication will be provided. Details will be included in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

separately from this protocol. 
 
 11.5.   Subject Confidentiality  
Subject names will not be supplied to the Sponsor.  Only the subject number and subject initials 
will be recorded in the eCRF,  and if the subject name appears on any other document, it must be 
obliterated before a copy of the document is supplied to the Sponsor. Study findings stored on a computer will be stored in accordance with local data protection laws. The subjects will be told 
that representatives of the Sponsor, a designated CRO, the IRB/IEC/REB, or regulatory 
authorities may inspect their medical records to verify the information collected, and that all 
personal information made available for inspection will be handled in strictest confidence and in accordance with local data protection laws. The Investigator will maintain a personal subject identification list (subject numbers with the corresponding subject names) to enable records to be 
identified.  
 11.6.   Study Monitori ng 
Monitoring procedures that comply with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will be 
followed. Review of the eCRFs for completeness and clarity, cross-checking with source 
documents, and clarification of administrative matters will be performe d. 
The study will be monitored by the Sponsor or its designee.  Monitoring will be performed by a 
representative of the Sponsor (Clinical Study Monitor) who will review the eCRFs and source documents. The site monitor will ensure that the investigation is conducted according to protocol 
design and GCP guidelines by frequent site visits and communications (e.g., email, letter, 
telephone, and facsimile).

assessment of safety during study conduct, as described in Section 7.13.1.4. 
 11.9.   Central Bone Marrow Review Committee  
All bone marrow assessments will be performed by a committee of expert hematopathologists, 
who will be blinded to subject, dose, and time of biopsy. The rules for assessment and 
adjudication will be defined in the Central Bone Marrow Review Committee charter. 
 11.10   Protocol Violations/Deviations  
The Investigator will conduct the study in compliance with the protocol. The protocol will not be 
initiated until the IRB/IEC/REB and the appropriate regulatory authorities have given 
approval/favorable opinion. Modifications to the protocol will not be made without agreement of the Sponsor. Changes to the protocol will require written IRB/IEC/REB approval/favorable opinion prior to implementation, except when the modification is needed to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to subjects. The IRB/IEC/REB may provide, if applicable regulatory authorities permit, expedite d review and approval/favorable opinion for minor change(s) in 
ongoing studies that have the approval/favorable opinion of the IRB/IEC/REB. The sponsor will submit all protocol modifications to the regulatory authorities in accordance with the governing 
regulations. 
A record of subjects screened, but not entered into the study, is also to be maintained. For any 
subject who does not meet the inclusion or exclusion criteria, a protocol exception may be requested by the Investigator. This exception may be approved by the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor prior to enrollment and the protocol exception must be fully documented in the source 
documents and on the appropriate page of the eCRF.  
When immediate deviation from the protocol is required to eliminate an immediate  hazard(s) to 
subjects, the Investigator will contact the Sponsor or its designee, if circumstances permit, to 
discuss the planned course of action.  Any departures form the protocol must be fully documented as a protocol deviation.  Protocol deviations may be required to be submitted to the IRB/IEC/REB in accordance with local requirements.  
Protocol modifications will only be initiated by the Sponsor and must be approved by the IRB/IEC/REB and submitted to FDA or other applicable international regulatory authority before initiation.   
11.11.   Premature Closure of the Study  
If the Sponsor, Investigator, or regulatory authorities discover conditions arising during the study which indicate that the clinical investigation should be halted due to an unacceptable subject risk, 
the study may be terminated after appropriate consultation between the Sponsor and the 
Investigator(s). In addition, a decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue development of the investigational product may be made at any time. Conditions that may 
warrant termination of the study or site include, but are not limited to: 
PRM -151 
Study Protocol PRM-151G-101             Protocol Version 6.0 15Dec2016

 • The discovery of an unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to the subjects enrolled 
in the study; 
• Failure of the Investigator to comply with pertinent global regulations; 
• Submission of knowingly false information from the study site to the Sponsor or other 
pertinent regulatory authorities; 
• Insufficient adherence by the Investigator to protocol requirements;  
• Administrative reasons as determined by the Sponsor. 
 
11.12.   Access to Source Documentation  
Regulatory authorities, the IRB/IEC/REB, or the Sponsor or its designee may request access to 
all source documents, eCRFs, and other study documentation for on-site audit or inspection.  Direct access  to these documents must be guaranteed by the Investigator, who must provide 
support at all times for these activities. Monitoring and auditing procedures that comply with current GCP guidelines will be followed.  On- site review of the eCRFs for completeness and 
clarity, cross -checking with source documents, and clarification of administrative matters may be 
performed.  
 11.13.   Data Generation and Analysis  
The clinical database will be developed and maintained by the Sponsor or designee (CRO) or an 
electron ic data capture technology provider as designated by the Sponsor. 
Adverse events will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
Version 12.0 or later. Concomitant medication will be coded using WHO- Drug Dictionary 
(WHO -DD). Centr alized laboratories may be employed as described in the study manual to aid 
in consistent measurement of efficacy and safety parameters.  
 11.14.   Retention of Data 
Essential documents should be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. The Sponsor will notify the Investigator if these documents must be 
retained for a longer period of time. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the 
Investigator or institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. 
Records will be maintained by the Sponsor for a period of 25 years and will be accessible for 
onsite inspection by regulatory agency inspectors. 
 
11.15.   Financial Disclosure  
The Investigator should disclose any financial interests in the Sponsor as described in 21 CFR 
Part 54 prior to beginning this study. The appropriate form will be provided to the Investigator

 APPENDIX C:  Proposed Revised World Health Organization Criteria for Primary 
Myelofibrosis  
Major criteria  
1.  Presence of megakaryocyte proliferation and atypia1, usually accompanied by either 
reticulin and/or collagen fibrosis, or, in the absence of significant reticulin fibrosis, the megakaryocyte changes must be accompanied by an increased bone marrow cellularity characterized by granulocytic proliferation and often decreased erythropoiesis (ie, prefibrotic cellular -phase disease)  
2. Not meeting WHO criteria for PV
2, CML3, MDS4, or other myeloid neoplasm 
3. Demonstration of JAK2 617V_F or other clonal marker (eg, MPL 515W_L/K), or in the 
absence of a clonal marker, no evidence of bone marrow fibrosis due to underlying inflammatory or other neoplastic diseases  
Minor criteria  
1.  Leukoerythroblastosis 2.  Increase in serum lactate dehydrogenase level
5 
3.  Anemia  
4.  Palpable splenomegaly  
Diagnosis requires meeting all 3 major criteria and 2 minor criteria.  
1Small to large megakaryocytes with an aberrant nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio and hyperchromatic, bulbous, or 
irregularly folded nuclei and dense clustering.  
2Requires the failure of iron replacement therapy to increase hemoglobin level to the polycythemia vera range in the 
presence of decreased serum ferritin. Exclusion of  polycythemia vera is based on hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. 
Red cell mass measurement is not required.  
3Requires the absence of BCR -ABL. 
4Requires the absence of dyserythropoiesis and dysgranulopoiesis.  
5Degree of abnormality could be borderline or marked.¶  
 Secondary to infection, autoimmune disorder or other chronic inflammatory condition, hairy cell leukemia or other lymphoid neoplasm, metastatic malignancy, or toxic (chronic) myelopathies. It should be noted that subjects with conditions associated with r eactive myelofibrosis are not immune to primary myelofibrosis and the diagnosis should 
be considered in such cases if other criteria are met,

 APPENDIX G:  Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form(MPN -SAF)  
Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom  
Assessment Form (MPN -SAF)  
and 
Myelolproliferative Neoplasms Symptom  
Assessment Form Total Symptom Score (MPN -SAF TSS)  
 
Symptoms among the Myeloroliferative  Neoplasms (MPNs) are severe and are correlated with 
poor prognosis. The Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN- SAF) and 
Myelolproliferative Neoplasms Symptom Assessment Form Total Symptom Score (MPN -SAF 
TSS) are currently the only two validated measures symptom burden specific to the 
Myeloproliferative Neoplasms. The MPN -SAF is a 27 -item measure that utilizes the 10 -item 
Brief Fatigue Inventory in conjunction with a 17- item assessment of disease symptoms specific 
to the Myeloproliferative  Neoplasms.  
 In order to ease survey administration, the 10- MPN -SAF total symptom score (MPN -SAF TSS), 
was created which includes a one- item assessment of worst fatigue from the BFI and 9 items 
from the original MPN-SAF. This abbreviated measure only includes the most pertinent and representative of the MPN symptoms and is intended to be used either as a one- time assessment 
or as a 7 -day diary. Both surveys have been validated in clinical setting to be administered 
during a routine office visit (see references and articles below).

weeks.  The first cycle of the open label phase contains a loading dose of 10mg/kg on days 1,3 
and 5. This will allow for subjects from all three dosing cohorts to receive a loading dose of 10mg/kg while maintaining the blind. 
Additionally, subjects who have entered the open label 
extension study prior to the approval of this amendment may receive a loading dose (10 mg/kg on days 1, 3, and 5), to be administered on their next scheduled cycle after approval of this protocol amendment . This will allow for these subjects to receive any potential pharmacologic 
benefit of the loading dose.   
Study Duration:  
 
Subjects may continue with PRM-151 dosing in the absence of disease progression or toxicity 
warranting discontinuation of therapy until drug is made available in another way. Cycle 
numbers will continue from the parent protocol, with cycle 9 Day 29 of the parent protocol 
becoming Cycle 10 Day 1 of the extension study. 
Response Assessments:  
In addition to the schedule of assessments listed below, response assessments will be done on 
Day 1 of every third cycle (every 12 weeks) beginning on Day 1 of Cycle 13 and may include the following, as described below: 
Bone Marrow Biopsies:  
An optional bone marrow biopsy will be performed every 12 weeks. 
MPN SAF and EORTC QLQ -C30:

 This is an open -label, Simon two stage, Phase 2 study to determine the efficacy an d 
safety of two different dose schedules of PRM-151 in subjects with PMF and post 
ET/PV MF. There are two treatment cohorts, each assigned to one of two dose schedules of PRM-151. Subjects will be assigned to a weekly or every four week dosing schedule by the investigator based on their ability to visit the study site on a weekly basis. This is an adaptive design as defined in FDA Draft guidance for Industry: Adaptive Design Clinical Trials for Drugs and Biologics, February 2010. Modifications to dose levels, schedule, or regimen may be made in Stage 2 based on data from Stage 1.  
 
Stage 1:  
 
Cohort 1: Approximately 12 subjects with intermediate - 1, intermediate -2, or high risk 
MF who have received no treatment for MF in at least two weeks will be enrolled and 
assigned to treatment with single agent PRM -151 at a dose of 10 mg/kg IV on Days 1, 
3, 5, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1 and Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each subsequent 28 day cycle 
for six cycles, OR single agent PRM -151 at a dose of 10 mg/kg administered IV on 
Days 1, 3, and 5 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of each subsequent 28 day cycle for six cycles. Subjects responding to therapy may continue receiving it as long as there is a benefit.  Cohort 2: Approximately 12 subjects with intermediate - 1, intermediate -2, or high risk 
MF on a stable dose of ruxolitinib for at least 12 weeks, with no improvement in spleen during the last four weeks will be enrolled. Subjects will be assigned to receive PRM-151 in combination with ruxolitinib either at a dose of 10 mg/kg administered IV on Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1 and Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each subsequent 28 day cycle for six cycles, OR in combination with ruxolitinib at a dose of 10 mg/kg administered IV on Days 1, 3, 5 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of each subsequent 28 da y cycle 
for six cycles. Subjects responding to therapy may continue receiving it as long as there is a benefit.  
 
Stage 2: 
 
If at least one response is seen in any arm of either cohort in Stage 1, an additional 20 
subjects may be enrolled and treated on that dosing schedule.  All non-responding arms 
will be closed. Subjects responding to therapy may continue receiving it as long as there is a benefit.  
 
Enrolled subjects will be considered evaluable for response if they are on study drug 
for at least four wee ks. 
Study Duration:  
 
Each subject will participate in the study for approximately 32 weeks. Participation will include a screening evaluation within four weeks before the first PRM-151 administration, six study cycles of four weeks each, and an end of study visit four 
weeks after the end of the last cycle. Subjects may continue with PRM -151 dosing in 
PRM -151 
Study Protocol PRM-151G-101             Protocol Version 6.0 15Dec2016

 the absence of disease progression or toxicity warranting discontinuation of therapy, as 
long as there is evidence of clinical benefit, as judged by the Inves tigator.  
 
Subjects who have no benefit in the parent study may switch to a schedule in which responses occur after completing 6 cycles of the originally assigned treatment.  
It is estimated that the study will be completed in approximately 18 months.

Safety Assessments:  
 
Safety will be evaluated from reported adverse events, scheduled physical 
examinations, vital signs, and clinical laboratory test results.  
 This Phase 2 clinical trial will have an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) to conduct interim reviews of safety data, and provide an independent evaluation on a predetermined and ad- hoc basis of accumulating safety data.  All 
adverse events repor ted to Promedior will be considered by Promedior and the DMC 
regardless of the reported causality by the study site. In assessing adverse events, Promedior and the DMC will consider only treatment emergent adverse events, defined as adverse events that occur after at least one exposure to study drug. The DMC will review all safety data at the following pre -determined times: 
 
• when the first 12 subjects reach Cycle 4, Day 1 
 
• when the first 24 subjects have completed the study  
The DMC will review the followin g events immediately on an ad -hoc basis and will 
make a recommendation about whether the study may proceed: 
 
• any death  
 
• any event of anaphylaxis  
 
• any SAEs  
 
• any treatment emergent Grade 3 non -hematologic toxicity  
 
• any treatment emergent grade 4 hematological adverse event or a treatment 
emergent grade 3 hematologic adverse event that represents a change of 2 
grades from grade 1, or a doubling of transfusion frequency.  
 
Statistical Methods:  
 
The objective is to demonstrate superiority within each  cohort and dose schedule, 
comparing observed ORR in each arm to a fixed uninteresting level ORR of 0.1. Let π 
denote population expected value of the primary parameter ORR. The objective of the trial is to reject the null-hypothesis  
Ho: π < 0.1  Efficacy will be assessed by evaluation of the overall response rate (ORR) categorized 
according to the International Working Group (IWG) Criteria ( APPENDIX B ) 
modified to include stable disease with improvement in bone marrow fibrosis by at 
least one grade.

in favor of the alternative hypothesis 
 
HA: π > 0.4 
 
The design will be two-staged within each arm based on Simon (Simon 1989) as shown in the figure below:  
  
 
 
 
The design maintains the type I error probability at 3.4 % which is less than 5 %.  
Furthermore, for π > 0.4, there is a high probability of at least 94 % to demonstrate superiority. The probability under H_0 to stop after stage 1 is 53 %, which implicit consequence that the expected number of subjects is 15, compared to a maximum number 
of subjects of 2 6.

Primary Objective(s):  
 To provide subjects achieving clinical benefit as determined by the investigator in the parent study an opportunity to remain on treatment and to allow subjects not achieving a benefit to 
switch to a potentially more effective schedule of PRM -151 
 
Secondary Objective(s):  
 To collect long term safety data of subjects receiving PRM -151 
 To collect add itional efficacy data on duration of response beyond 6 months of treatment 
 
To collect efficacy data on the change of PRM -151 schedule in subjects not achieving a 
response  
Study Design:  
This is an open-label, extension of study PRM-151G-101 to provide access to subjects in the parent study who have achieved benefit in the parent study. Additionally, subjects who have no benefit in the parent study may switch to a schedule of PRM-151 in which responses have occurred after completing 6 cycles of the originally assigned treatment. Subjects may switch schedules of PRM-151 and/or drop ruxolitinib in the extension but subjects are not allowed to add ruxolitinib if they were in Cohort 1. After st udy completion and data analysis, all subjects 
remaining on PRM-151 in this extension will switch to the dose selected for future clinical development. 
Study Duration:  
Subjects may continue with PRM-151 dosing in the absence of disease progression or toxi city 
warranting discontinuation of therapy, as long as there i s evidence of clinical benefit or until

with Cycle 6 Day 29 of the parent protocol becoming Cycle 7 Day 1 of the extension study. 
Response Assessments:  
In addition to the schedule of assessments listed below, response assessments will be done on 
Day 1 of every third cycle (every 3 months) beginning on Day 1 of Cycle 10 and may include the following, as described below:  
 Bone Marrow Biopsies: A bone marrow biopsy will be performed only to determine or confirm a change in response category. This will be done at the following time points depending on the subjects’ response category at the time of the most recent bone marrow biopsy: 
 
• CR: Bone marrow biopsy will be done only if there is a change in status indicating 
potential disease progression. 
 
• PR: For subjects with bone marrow histological remission, bone marrow biopsy 
(BMB) will be done only if there is a change in status indicating disease progression. For subjects without bone marrow histological remission BMB will be done every 6 months until CR is documented or until indication of potential disease progression. 
 
• CI: BMB will be done if the clinical status changes from CI to PR or PD 
 
• Stable disease with improvement in bone marrow fibrosis: BMB will be done if the 
clinical status changes from SD to CI, PR, or PD. 
 
MPN SAF Score:  
The subjects MPN symptoms will be assessed using the MPN SAF every 3 months.  Physical Exam and Spleen Measurement:  
An abbreviated physical exam and spleen measurement by palpation will be done every 3 
months.

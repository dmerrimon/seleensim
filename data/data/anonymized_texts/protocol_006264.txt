Sustained-release Tablets i n Adults with 
Attention- deficit/ Hyperactivity  Disorder
(Trial 405-201-00014)
Clinical Phase/Trial 
Type:3
Treatment Indication: Adult Attention- deficit/ Hyperactivit y Disorder (ADHD)
Objective(s): Primary : To confirm the efficacy  of centanafadine 
sustained -release ( SR)tablets administered twice -daily  (BID; 
200 mg or 400 mg total daily  doses [ TDDs ]) compared to 
placebo in the treatment of adults with ADHD
Secondary :To confirm the safet y and tolerability  of 
centanafadine SR tablets ad ministered BID (200 mg or 
400mg TDDs) compared to placebo in the treatment of adults 
with ADHD
Trial Design: This trial is a phase 3, randomized, double -blind, multicenter, 
placebo- controlled, parallel -group trial to confirm the efficacy , 
safet y, and tolerability of centanafadine SR (200 mg TDD or 
400 mg TDD ) compared to placebo for the treatment of adults 
with A DHD.
The trial will have 4 periods: (1) screening and washout; 
(2)1-week single -blind placebo run -in; (3) 6 -week 
double -
blind treatment; and (4) 7- dayfollow -up period 
(follow -up telephone calls at 1, 3, and 5 day
s after the last 
dose of investigational medicinal product ( IMP), and in -clinic 
visits 2 and 7 day s after the last dose of IMP) for subjects who 
complete the trial, and decide to enroll in 
Trial 405-201-00015. For subjects who terminate earl y, decide

Protocol 405 -201-00014
Confidential -Proprietary Information 3 Version 4.0, 1 5Jan 2020Subjects randomized to receive 400 mg TDD centanafadine 
SR will start the double -blind treatment period at the TDD of 
200 mg centanafadine SR for 7days, before they  are escalated 
to their target TDD of 400 mg for a total of approximately  
42days of treatment. Subjects will be required to visit the site 
up to 12 times over the trial.
Subjects who complete both the 6- week double -blind 
treatment per iod and the 7-dayfollow up (follow -up telephone 
calls at 1, 3, and 5 day
s after the last dose of IMP, and in-
clinic visits 2 and 7 day s after the last dose of IMP), and 
refrain from using prohibited medications after the I MP is 
stopped may  be eligible to enroll into Trial 405-201- 00015, 
which is a 12 -month, observational, open -label trial to 
evaluate the long term safety  and tolerability  of subjects with 
ADHD who previously  participated in Trials 405-201-00013 
or 405
-201-00014. Subjects who terminate earl y, decide to not 
enroll in Trial 405-201- 00015, or who are not eligible to enroll 
in Trial 405-201-00015, will be required to participate in the 
7-day follow -up period as well as participate in an additional 
follow -up telephone call 10 day s after the last dose of IMP
. 
For s ubjects who earl y terminate or decline participation in the 
open -label trial, they  will be instructed to refrain from utilizing 
prohibited concomitant medications (Section 4.1 ), including 
ADHD treatments, until after the follow -up telephone call 
10days after the last dose of IMP.
Subject Population: A total of up to 1150 male and female subjects with current 
diagnos is ADHD and between the ages of 18 and 55 years, 
inclusive, are planned to be screened in order to randomize 
approximately  450 subjects to y ield 292+ completers.
Subjects must meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM -5) criteria for ADHD 
(including predominantly inattentive presentation, hy peractive 
presentation, or combined presentation) as confirmed by  the 
Adult ADHD Clinical Diagnostic Scale (ACDS) Version 1.2
. 
To confirm that ADHD is the primary diagnosis, the Mini 
International Neurops ychiatric Interview (MINI) will be used 
to identify  and exclude other ps ychiatric conditions which 
would preclude enrollment.Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Day 28 and Day 42 in the AIM- A and the ASRS total score 
and subscale scores.
Safety Endpoints:
Standard safet y variables will include AEs (including 
evaluations for rash, AEs related to abuse potential, and AEs 
involving medication handling irregularities), clinical 
laboratory  tests (hematology , serum chemistry , and 
urinaly sis), phy sical examinations, vital sign measurements, 
ECGs, assessments of withdrawal (SMWQ), and suicidality  
(C-SSRS).

Protocol 405 -201-00014
Confidential -Proprietary Information 9 Version 4.0, 1 5Jan 2020Statistical Methods: A sufficient number of subjects will be enr olled and 
randomized to achieve approximately  405 evaluable subjects 
in the double -blind treatment period (ie, subjects with an 
AISRS total score at baseline and at least 1 subsequent AI SRS 
total score in the double -blind treatment period). After 
allowance of 10% nonevaluable subjects in the double -blind 
treatment period, the total number of subjects to be 
randomized is 450 subjects (150 subjects in each treatment 
arm). In order to ensure 405 evaluable subjects, the number of 
nonevaluable subjects will be m onitored in a blinded manner 
on an ongoing basis during the trial. The power and sample 
size were obtained using the PASS 14 (2015) statistical 
computing software.
The primary  efficacy  endpoint is the change from baseline to 
Day 42 in AISRS total score. T he estimand for the primary  
efficacy  anal ysis is the difference in outcome improvement if 
all subjects tolerated and adhered to their treatment. This 
approach is Estimand #3 ,recommended b y the 2010 National 
Academ y of Sciences’ National Research Council report on 
prevention and treatment of missing data and International 
Council for Harmonisation E9 (R1) “Addendum to Statistical 
Principles for Clinical Trials on Choosing Appr opriate 
Estimands and Defining Sensitivity  Anal yses in Clinical 
Trials”. This estimand focuses on the efficacy  of 
centanafadine (SR 200mg TDD or SR 400mg TDD) in change 
from the baseline in AISRS total score. The objective of this 
trial is consistent with the election of an efficacy  rather than 
effectiveness estimand.
The primary  efficacy  analy sis will be performed by  fitting a 
mixed -effect model repeated measures anal ysis with an 
unstructured variance covariance structure in which the 
change from baseline in AI SRS total score at the scheduled 
double -blind treatment period visits will be the dependent 
variable based on the observed -case data set. The model will 
include fixed class effect terms for treatment, trial center, visit 
day, and an interaction term of treatment b y visit day. The 
model will also include baseline values of AISRS total score 
and the interaction term of baseline values of AISRS total 
score b y visit day  as covariates. The primary  comparison 
between the centanafadine (200 mg TDD or 400 mg TDD 
group) and the placebo group at Day  42 in the double -blind 
treatment phase will be estimated as the difference between 
Least Squares means utilizing the computing software SAS 
procedure PROC MI XED.Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 405 -201-00014
Confidential -Proprietary Information 10 Version 4.0, 1 5Jan 2020The comparison between centanafadine 200 mg TDD or 
400mg TDD group and placebo group will be tested at a 
significance level of 0.05 (2
-sided) in the order of 1) 400 mg 
versus placebo, and 2) 200 mg versus placebo. Additional 
details will be provided in the statistical analy sis plan (SAP). 
Based on the resu lts at various dose strengths from phase 2 
centanafadine trials, it is reasonable to expect a treatment 
difference of 5 points with a 
standard deviation ( SD)of 12.5 in 
the mean change from baseline to Day  42 on AISRS total 
score in either the 200 mg TDD or 400 mg TDD arms . The 
planned sample size of 405 evaluable subjects (135 in each 
treatment arm) will y ield at least 90% power to detect the 
treatment effects at a 2 -tailed significance level of 0.05. The 2 -
sided alpha level for the final anal ysis is 0.05.
Descriptive statistics will be provided for all efficacy  and 
safet y variables in general. Continuous variables will be 
summarized by  tabulations of mean, median, range, and SD. 
Tabulations of frequency distributions will be provided for 
categorical varia bles.
Trial Duration: A total of up to 1150 male and female subjects are planned to 
be screened in order to randomize approximately  450 subjects 
to yield approximately  292 completers. Individual 
participation for all subjects in the trial is 12 to 13 weeks, 
consisting of an up to 28 -day screening period, a 1 -week 
single -blind placebo run- in period, a 6 -week double blind 
treatment period, and a 7-dayfollow -up period (follow -up 
telephone calls at 1, 3, and 5 day s after the last dose of IMP, 
and in- clinic visits 2 and 7 day s after the last dose of IMP) for 
all subjects. For subjects who earl y terminate or decline 
participation in the open -label trial, they  will be required to 
participate in an additional follow- up telephone call 10 day s 
after the last dose of IMP.Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 405 -201-00014
Confidential -Proprietary Information 21 Version 4.0, 1 5Jan 20201 Introduction
Attention- deficit/ hyperactivity  disorder (ADHD) is an increasingl y recognized and 
heterogeneous disorder characterized by  3 core s ymptoms of hy peractivity , 
inattentiveness, an d impulsivity .1Depending on the ADHD subt ype, sex, and presence of 
comorbid disorders, individuals with ADHD may display  considerabl y different 
symptomatology , even within a particular age cohort.2
Although ADHD is still considered primarily  a childhood disorder, the advent of 
consensus diagnostic criteria for ADHD in conjunction with more rigorous prospective 
research has documented the persistence of this disorder into adolescence in up to 70% 
and into adulthood in up to 66% of childhood cases.3,4More recently, 2 follow -up trials 
of children with ADHD from child mental health clinics in southeast England and the 
Netherlands showed persistence of ADHD into y oung adulthood in 79% to 86.5% of 
individuals, respectivel y.5,6Long-term follow -up trials report the persistence of this 
disorder into adulthood in as man y as 65% of childhood cases.7,8There is mounting 
evidence that supports adult ADHD is a combination of both childhood ADHD persisting 
into adulthood and adult-onset ADHD without childhood diagnosis.9Fayyad et al (2007) 
estimated adult (18 to 44 years) ADHD prevalence determined b y Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition ( DSM -IV)criteria to be 3.4%.10
Kessler et al (2006) determined adult ADH D prevalence to be 4.4% using the National 
Comorbidity  Survey  Replication, a lay -administered household survey .11
The exact pathoph ysiology  of ADHD remains uncertain although it is believed that a 
dysregulation of neurotransmitters, specificall y dopamine and norepinephrine, in the 
frontostriatal region of the brain are involved.12,13This hy pothesis is based primarily  on 
knowledge of the mechanism of action of drugs found to be effective in treating ADHD 
and further supported b y molecular genetics and neuroimaging studies.12,14
Environmental and perinata l complications may  also be contributing factors.15,16
The pharmacotherap y of ADHD consequentl y relies on 2 major classes of drugs: 
(1)stimulants, such as methy lphenidate and am phetamines, and (2) non stimulants, such 
as atomoxetine17and alpha -adrenergic agonists such as guanfacine and clonidine.18
Stimulants have a rapid onset of action in ADHD, are e ffective in all 3 core deficits of the 
disorder17, and have a response rate of about 70%.19However, their usefulness is limited 
by adverse reactions, by  lack of effect on or exacerbation of comorbidities, and by  abuse Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Confidential -Proprietary Information 22 Version 4.0, 1 5Jan 2020liability  (ie, risks of abuse, dependence, and diversion) with resultant drug prescribing 
restrictions.17
The first nonstimulant drug approved in the United States ( US)was atomoxetine. 
Although atomoxetine is an acceptable option for some patients with ADHD, it is 
generall y less effective than treatment with stimulant therap y. In an 
atomoxetine/methy lphenidate comparison trial, the response rate for atomoxetine was 
superior to placebo, 45% to 24%, respectively . However, the response rate for 
methy lphenidate was superior to atomoxetine (56% to 45%).20Inaddition, atomoxetine 
is associated with cardiovascular and nervous s ystem adverse events (AEs) and has a 
boxed warning from the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )for increased risk of 
suicidal ideation in children or adolescents.21
Immediate -release clonidine and guanfacine have been evaluated as monotherap y in 
ADHD, however rapid clearance and absorption, negative side effects, and reduced 
efficacy  compared with sti mulants has limited their usage .22In addition, patient 
responses to alpha -2adrenergic agonists have been shown to be not as strong as 
stimulants. An effect size of 0.58 for clonidine was seen compared t o 0.82 for stimulants 
in a meta -analy sis of ADHD treatment trials. Therefore, as a first line treatment 
immediate release alpha -2 adrenergic agonists are usually not considered for ADHD .23,24
Clinical data available to date suggest tha t centanafadine sustained release (SR) has the 
potential to be more effective than nonstimulant therapies, with a better side -effect 
profile, and lower abuse potential than currently  available stimulant therapies. In the 
current trial a 200 mg and a 400 mg total dail y dose (TDD) of centanafadine SR will be 
evaluated against placebo .

A complete description of the available efficacy  and safet y pharmacology data from 
nonclinical studies, including pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicology  studies in different 
animal species can be found in the current IB.25Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 405 -201-00014
Confidential -Proprietary Information 23 Version 4.0, 1 5Jan 20201.2 Clinical Data
As of the IB data cutoff of 1 Apr 2017, 7 clinical trials in 260 subjects have been 
conducted with centanafadine. A total of 140 healthy  subjects or recreational stimulant 
users received centanafadine in five phase 1 trials and 120 subjects with ADHD received 
centanafadine in two
phase 2 trials.
Data from the 2 completed phase 2 trials ( EB-
1020- SR-ADHD -201 and 
NVI-EB-1020-202 ) demonstrated the efficacy  of centanafadin e SR in the treatment of 
adult subjects with ADHD. Trial EB -1020- SR- A DHD-201 was an exploratory , 
single -blind pilot trial to evaluate flexible doses (100 to 500 mg) of centanafadine SR. 
Trial NVI-EB-1020- 202 was a randomized, double - blind, multicenter, 2- period, 
2-treatment, crossover trial. Due to tolerability  issues obser ved at high doses of 
centanafadine SR (800 and 600 mg), the trial was amended to the maximum TDD
of 
400 mg for further evaluation. For both trials, there was a statisticall y significant 
difference in the primary  endpoint using the adult ADHD Rating Scale Version I V 
(ADHD -RS-IV) for subjects that received centanafadine SR compared to placebo 
(p<0.001). Safet y data collected from the complete phase 2 trials indicated that 
centanafadine SR is well tolerated up to 400 mg in subjects with ADHD.
Please refer t o the IB for a detailed summary  of available clinical data.25
1.3 Know n and Potential Risks and Benefits
Based on the IB, data from the completed phase 1 and 2 trials indicate that centanafadine 
is safe and well -tolerated in healthy  adult subjects and adult 
subjects with ADHD. Data 
from the completed phase 2 trials demonstrate that centanafadine is effective in treating 
symptoms of ADHD ; based on the positive effect of centanafadine SR on the primary  
efficacy  measure, the adu lt ADHD -RS-IV. Preliminary  data suggest centanafadine may  
also confer an improved safet y profile and a lower potential for abuse compared to 
currentl y approved Schedule II stimulant treatments for ADHD. The abuse potential for 
centanafadine is continuing t o be evaluated.
Seven clinical trials in 260 healthy  adult subjects and adult subjects with ADHD have 
been conducted with centanafadine. A total of 140 healthy  adult subjects received 
centanafadine in 5 phase 1 trials and 120 adult subjects with ADHD recei ved 
centanafadine in 2 phase 2 trials. The most common AEs reported in trials with 
centanafadine SR at TDDs ranging from 
25to 800 mg were gastrointestinal (nausea, 
diarrhea, and dry  mouth), metabolism/nutrition -related (decreased appetite), and nervous 
system disorders (headache, dizziness, and insomnia). In general, these AEs were mild 
and resolved. To date, 1 serious AE(SAE) (ischemic cardiovascular accident) occurred in Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 405 -201-00014
Confidential -Proprietary Information 24 Version 4.0, 1 5Jan 2020a subject with ADHD (initial dosage of centanafadine SR 100 mg, titrated to 500 mg)
6days after completing treatment, but it was not considered related to centanafadine 
treatment.
Based on the outcome of the phase 2 trials, t reatment with centanafadine may  be 
associated with increases in blood pressure, heart rate and orthostatic blood pressure 
changes. Increases in blood pressure and heart rate were usuall y modest and 
asymptomatic; however, hy pertension, tach ycardia, and orthostasis have occurred. 
During clinical trials, heart rate and blood pressure willbe measured prior to initiation of 
therap y, and periodicall y while on therap y. Subjects will also be monitored for 
tachycardia or h ypertension. Centanafadine should be used with caution in subjects with 
hypertension, tach ycardia, or cerebrovascular disease or cardiovascular disease (eg,
known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomy opath y, serious heart rh ythm 
abnormalities, or other serious cardiac problems that may  place a subject at increased 
vulnerability  to noradrenergic effects).
Rash has been observed in subjects who rec eived centanafadine . One subject experienced 
mild rash that was considered related to treatment after taking 500 mg centanafadine SR 
TDD for 4 days(Trial NVI -EB-1020- 201). The rash resolved in 8 day s with no change in 
the dose and the subject completed th e trial. Eight subjects reported rash after multiple 
doses of 
centanafadine SRin Trial NVI -EB-1020-202 . Rashes resulted in discontinuation 
of dosing for 5 subjects and dose interruption or dose reduction for 3 subjects. The 
severit y of the rash in subject s who discontinued IMP ranged from moderate to severe. 
The majority  of subjects who experienced rash were exposed to doses greater than 
400mg/day  (2 subjects received 800 mg/day; 4 subjects received 600 mg/day ; 2 subjects 
received 400 mg/ day). Neither sub ject who received 400 mg/day  discontinued dosing due 
to the rash nor were the rashes in these subjects consistent with the drug eruptions seen in 
subjects who received 600 mg or 800 mg. All of the rashes were nonserious and all but 
one resolved within 12 d ays of treatment with IMP withdrawal or dose reduction. The 
one exception was a severe rash lasting over 2 months that was considered likely  due to 
an existing cutaneous condition and exacerbated by  the drug eruption. The dermatologic 
experts who reviewed these AEs concluded that none exhibited a profile consistent with a 
rash that would progress to a serious or otherwise life- threatening AE.
Considering that rash can be a sign of an allergic reaction, subjects willbe monitored 
closely  for other s ymptoms o f allergic reaction, including shortness of breath, itching and 
swelling of the throat or mouth, or difficulty breathing (see Section 5.4). A 
comprehensive rash monitoring plan will be followed.Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

2 Trial Rationale and Objectives
2.1 Trial Rationale
This phase 3 registrational trial, in conjunction with other registrational trials, is part of 
the centanafadine clinical development program that has been designed to confirm the 
efficacy  and safet y of centanafadine for the treatment of adults experiencin g ADHD 
symptoms. As efficacy  is dependent on both treatment duration and dose, a fixed -dose, 
parallel -group approach represents the optimal trialdesign to evaluate efficacy .
This trial is being conducted to obtain information on the efficacy , safet y, and tolerability  
of TDDs of 200 mg and 400 mg centanafadine SR compared to placebo in adults with 
ADHD. A double -blind, randomized design will be used to minimize bias while 
collecting data and when interpreting the results. A single- blind placebo run -in will also 
be used to exclude likely placebo responders before randomization to minimize the 
impact of a placebo -effect on determining the efficacy  of centanafadine SR on ADHD 
symptoms during the double -blind treatment period.
2.2 Dosing Rationale
In the current tri al, centanafadine will be administered twice dail y (BID) as multiple 
100mg SR tablets to achieve TDDs of 200 mg or 400 mg.
In the phase 2 NVI -EB-1020 - 202trial, centanafadine SR was initially  administered at a
target dose of 800 mg/day . This dose was revised down to 600 mg/day  given the 
incidence of gastrointestinal AEs and 3 reported cases of rash. After an additional 5 case s
of rash were reported at the revised maximal dose of 600 mg/day  centanafadine SR , the 
dose was further reduced to 400 mg/day . The primary  endpoint, ADHD -RS-IV total 
score, was met in subjects that received 400 mg TDD centanafadine compared to those 
that received placebo (p < 0.001). Given the separation of 400 mg centanafadine from 
placebo, and the positive benefit/risk profile, it was concluded that the maximum 
tolerated dose is400 mg/day . A TDD of 400 mg centana fadine will be included in this 
trialto further confirm the efficacy , safet y, and tolerability of the previously -established 
maximum tolerated dose.
During the NVI -EB-1020 -202 trial, subjects that received 100 to 200 mg/day  while 
titrating up to the maximum dose of centanafadine exhibited a statistically  significant 
separation from placebo at Day 7
(p < 0.001), suggesting a TDD of 200 mg centanafadine 
may also be effective for the treatment of ADHD sy mptoms. A TDD of 200 mg Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

2.3 Trial Objectives
Primary : To confirm the efficacy  of centanafadine SR tablets administered BID
(200 mg or 400 mg TDDs ) compared to placebo in the treatment of adults 
with ADHD
Secondary :To confirm the safet y and tolerability of centanafadine SR tablets 
administered BID (200 mg or 400 mg TDDs ) compared to placebo in the 
treatment of adults with ADHD
3 Trial Design
3.1 Type/Design of Trial
This trial is a phase 3, randomized, double -blind, multicenter, pla cebo -controlled, 
parallel -group trial to confirm the efficacy , safet y, and tolerability of centanafadine SR 
(200 mg TDD or 400 mg TDD ) compared to placebo for the treatment of adults with 
ADHD. The trial population will include male and female subjects 18 to 55 y ears of age 
(inclusive) with a current diagnosis of ADHD as confirmed by  the Adult ADHD Clinical 
Diagnostic Scale (ACDS )Version 1.2 
at screening.
The trial will have 4 periods: (1) screening and washout; (2) 1 week single -blind placebo 
run-in; (3) 6-week double blind treatment; and (4) 7-dayfollow -up period (follow - up 
telephone calls at 1, 3, and 5 day s after the last dose of IMP, and in- clinic visits 2 and 
7days after the last dose of IMP) for subjects who complete the trial, and decide to enroll
in Trial 405 -201-00015. For subjects who terminate earl y, decide to not enroll in 
Trial 405-201- 00015, or who are not eligible to enroll in Trial 405 - 201-00015, they  will 
be required to participate in the 7
-day follow -up period as well as participate in a n 
additional follow -up telephone call 10 day s after the last dose of IMP. Subjects 
randomized to receive a TDD of 200 mg centanafadine SR will start at their target dose at 
the start of the double -blind treatment period. Subjects randomized to receive a TD D of 
400 mg centanafadine SR will start the double -blind treatment period at the TDD of 
200 mg centanafadine SR for 7 days, before they  are escalated to their target TDD of 
400mg for a total of approximately  42days of treatment. Subjects will be required to 
visit the site up to 12 times over the trial . See Figure 3.1-1 for a schematic of the trial 
design.Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

3.2.1 Single -blind Placebo Run -inPeriod
All subjects will begin BID dosing with single -blind matching placebo on Visit 2 
(Day −7)and continue through Visit 3 (baseline) (Section 3.7.1.2) .Two tablets of 
matching placebo should be taken orally  in the morning followed by  an additional 
2
tablets 4 to 6 hours later .The m orning and subsequent dose of matching placebo should 
be taken at approximately  the same time each day. All subjects must be unaware of the 
single -blind placebo run-in period so that it is indistinguishable from the double- blind 
treatment period.
3.2.2 Double -blind Treatment Period
Trial assignments for the double- blind treatment period wil l be made once eligibility  is 
confirmed. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio at baseline (Visit 3) to 
one of the following 3 treatment groups :
Centanafadine SR 200 mg TDD
Centanafadine SR 400 mg TDD
Matching placebo
Neither the investigat or nor the subject will be aware of the treatment assignment after 
randomization. All doses of centanafadine SR and matching placebo should be taken 
orally  BID and can be administered without regard to meals, and should be taken at 
approximately  the same t ime each day , with the first dose taken in the morning. The 
second dose should be taken 4 to 6 hours after the morning dose is administered.
Subjects randomized to receive the target TDD of 200 mg centanafadine SR will start at 
thetarget dose on Day  1 of the double- blind treatment period and remain at that dose for 
the duration of the trial (Table 3.2.2-1). Subjects randomized to receive a TDD of 400 mg 
centanafadine SR will receive a TDD of 200 mg centanafadine SR on Day  1 of the 
double -blind treatment period for 7 day s before they  are escalated to their target TDD of 
400 mg on Day  8 for the duration of the trial ( Table 3.2.2-1 ).Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

3.6.1 Randomization
During the trial, administration of the IMP will be double -blind. I n other words, neither 
the investigator nor the subject will have knowledge of the treatment assignment 
(eg,centanafadine SR 200 mg, 400 mg, or placebo). Treatment assignments will be based 
on a computer -generated randomization code provided by  the Otsuka Pharmaceutical 
Development & Commercialization, I nc (OPDC) Biometrics Depar tment. Sponsor 
personnel, including those involved in monitoring, data management, and data anal ysis, 
will not have access to the treatment code during the trial. The bioanaly tical laboratory  
will also be sent the randomization code. Access to the treatmen t codes will be restricted 
to personnel charged with generating and maintaining randomization files, packaging 
trial medication, operating electronic case report form ( eCRF ), and reporting SAEs to 
regulatory  agencies. The randomization will be stratified b y trial site and designed to 
allocate subjects in a 1:1:1 ratio to centanafadine SR 200 mg/day  or 400 mg/day  or 
placebo.
3.7 Trial Procedures
The time from enrollment of the first subject to the last subject’s last trial visit will be 
approximately  12 months. Individual participation for subjects who complete the trial 
will be approximately  12 weeks, consisting of a 28 -day screening and washout period, a 
1-week single -blind placebo run -in period, a baseline day , a 6-week double -blind 
treatment period, and a 7-day follow -up period (follow -up telephone calls at 1, 3, and 
5days after the last dose of IMP, and in
-clinic visits 2 and 7 days after the last dose of 
IMP). For subjects who terminate earl y, decide to not enroll in Trial 405 -201-00015, or 
who are not elig ible to enroll in Trial 405 -201- 00015, they  will be required to participate 
in the 7 -day follow -up period as well as participate in an additional follow -up telephone 
call 10 day s after the last dose of IMP.
When Trial 405 -201- 00014 reaches its conclusion, all subjects participating in the trial, 
regardless of trial period, may  be eligible to enroll into Trial 405-201- 00015, which is a 
12-month, observational, open -label trial (Section 3.1). All subjects will be required to 
comply  with the appropriate follow -up procedures described in Section 3.7.1.5 and 
Section
3.7.1.6.

3.7.1.1 Visit 1 (Screening)
The screening period begins after consent is obtained and will take place between 
Day −35 and Day  −8prior to the initiation of the single -blind placebo run -in period . 
Completion of screening activities may  require more than 1 visit. All procedures outlined 
for screening in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3.7-1) will be performed. The 
following should also be noted:
The investigator or his/her designee must obtain informed consent from the subject 
prior to an y trial -related procedures being performed.
A urine drug screen will be collected and sent to the central lab for evaluation. If 
subjects are taking disallowed medications and they  are able to taper appropriately  
and safel y, they will do so duri ng the screening period. If medication taken is for 
ADHD, a minimum of 7 day s off stimulants and 21 day s off nonstimulants will be 
required before the single
-blind placebo run-in period. A complete washout schedule, 
including common excluded medications an d herbal preparations, is provided in 
Section 4.1. A subject who tested positive for an y prohibited medications at the 
screening visit must have a repeat urine drug screen that is confirmed as negative 
prior to performing Visit 2.
An assessment of all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be made to determine the 
subject’s eligibility  for the trial.
Medical and ps ychiatric history  will be recorded, including the DSM -
5 diagnosis of 
ADHD using the ACDS Version 1.2.
Subjects will be ad ministered the ASRS .
A urine pregnancy  test will be performed for all females of childbearing potential 
(FOCBP). If the urine pregnancy  test is positive, the result should be confirmed with 
a serum pregnancy  test. Subjects with a positive serum test result will be excluded 
from the trial.
External quality  oversight methods will be used by  Clinical Surveillance & Training 
(CST) to promote a ppropriate subject enrollment. Such methods will require sites to 
communicate certain aspects of subject data during the screening period to CST as 
detailed in the Operations Manual. Subjects cannot be randomized until approv al from 
CST has been received. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects are 
eligible for enrollment into the trial and for assessing subject safet y throughout the trial.Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

3.7.5.2 Clinical Laboratory  Assessments
A central laboratory  designated by  the sponsor will be used for all laboratory testing 
required during the trial. The central laboratory  should be used for all laboratory  testing 
whenever possible (including unscheduled and follow up, if needed). In cases where an 
immediate result is required for a particular laboratory  test, the sample should be divided 
and sent to both a local laboratory  and the designated central laboratory . Urine will be 
collected and blood will be drawn from each subject during screening prior to treatment 
with the I MP. Subjects should be fasting for a minimum of 8 hours prior to the blood 
draws, if possible. If fasting blood samples are not feasible at screening, nonfasting blood 
samples may  be obtained initially  for determining eligibility  for the trial. If a fasting 
blood sample was obtained at the screening visit and less than 14 day s have elapsed since 
the screening visit, clinical laboratory  tests (hematology , serum chemistry , and urinal ysis) 
do not need to be rep eated at the baseline visit. The results of these tests must be 
reviewed b y the investigator prior to initiation of the administration of the IMP. Clinical 
laboratory  tests at other visits should be drawn fasting, if possible, but must be drawn 
after a min imum 8 -hour fast at Day 42/ET. All blood collections must occur after the Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

ECGs, medication withdrawal scales, and suicidality ) at any  given visit.
3.7.6.1 Pharmacokinetic A ssessments
3.7.6.1.1 Pharmacokinetic Blood Samples
Five sparse PK samples will be taken for determination of concentrations of 
centanafadine and metabolite (s) in plasma. Blood samples will be collected by  trial 
centers that have appropriate facilities. A 2-mL sample will be collected at the time 
points presented in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3.7-1) . Samples collected at 
Day 14and Day 42/ET should be taken concurrently  with the serum chemistry  sample. 
The actual date and time of the PK sample collection must be recorded on the eCRF . The 
exact timing of sampling relative to previous dose is not critical and can vary as much as 
is operationally  practical. Preferentially , 3 of the 4 PK samples taken during the treatment 
period per subject should be taken as follows:
At leas t 1 sample should be taken prior to the first morning dose (trough 
concentration) at either Day 7, Day  14, or Day 28

If the sponsor terminates or suspends the trial f or any  reason, prompt notification will be 
given to investigators, IRBs, and regulatory  authorities in accordance with regulatory  
requirements. Subjects who remain in the trial when the trial reaches its conclusion may  
be eligible to enter an open -label rollover trial (Trial 405-201- 00015) if they  meet all of 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria for that trial.
3.8.2 Individual Site
Individual trial site participation may  be discontinued by  the sponsor, the investigator, or 
the IRB if judged to be necessary  for medic al, safety , regulatory , ethical or other reasons 
consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and GCP. The investigator will notify  the 
sponsor promptly  if the trial is terminated by  the investigator or the IRB at the site.
3.8.3 Individual Subject Discontinuat ion
3.8.3.1 Treatment Discontinuation
After randomization, a subject may  stop treatment permanentl y for a variet y of reasons. 
Treatment discontinuations may  be initiated by  a subject who is not satisfied with 
treatment or may  become medically  necessary  due to AEs, required treatment with a 
disallowed medication or therap y, or other issues, as determined b y the investigator. 
However, each investigator must comprehensivel y review the circumstances and offer the 
subject options for continued treatment to the degree po ssible as described in 
Section 3.8.3.4. Refer to Table 3.7-2 for a description of follow -up procedures.
A urine drug screen willbe collected and sent to the central lab at the time points 
described 
Table 3.7-1 and Table 3.7-2. At the start of the single -blind placebo run -in 
period through the Day  42/ET visit , if the subject is tests positive for any  prohibited 
medications (including medications for the treatment of ADHD, see Section 4.1 ), the 
subject will be earl y terminated, and the procedures outlined in Section 3.7.1.4.2 will be 
completed.
At the baseline visit only, if subjects have a ≥ 30% improvement in the ASRS (18 item) 
ADHD S ymptoms score compared to the score at the start of the single -blind placebo 
run-in, they  will be early  terminated.Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 405 -201-00014
Confidential -Proprietary Information 54 Version 4.0, 15 Jan 20203.8.3.2 Documenting Reasons for Treatment Discontinuation
A subject may  discontinue IMP for a number of reasons including those listed below:
Reasons related to AE:
Subject decides to discontinue because of anno yance or discomfort due to a 
non-serious AE which is not otherwise determined to be an undue hazard
Continuing I MP places the subject at undue risk as determined by  the investigator 
(eg, a safet y concern that is possibly , probabl y, or likely related to IMP)
SAE
Death
Reasons unrelated to medical condition (provide detail and review AE history  with 
subject)
Withdrawal of informed consent (complete written withdrawal of consent form)
Lost to follow -up
Rash (regardless of severity  orseriousness) (see Section 5.4)
Pregnancy  (see Section 5.7)
Termination of all or part of the trial b y the sponsor
Lack of efficacy (LOE)
Subjects withdrawn prior to 
Day 42must complete the Day 42/ET evaluations at the time 
of withdrawal. In addition, all subjects who withdraw prematurel y from the trial will be 
assessed by telephone 1, 3, and 5 day s after the last dose of IMP, in the clinic 
2 and 
7days after the last dose of the IMP, and 10days via telephone after the last dose of the 
IMP. Three attempts will be made to contact the subject by  telephone; in the event the 
site i
s unable to reach the subject by  telephone, the site will attempt to contact the subject 
via certified mail or an alternative similar method where appropriate.
Meeting a screening exclusion criterion post- randomization does not require an automatic 
discont inuation of the subject. The investigator should assess the change for clinical 
significance, determine if an AE should be reported, and make a determination of subject 
continuation based on subject safety. The investigator will consult with the medical 
monitor to determine subject continuation in the trial.
If the subject discontinues I MP due to an AE, the investigator, or other trial personnel, 
will make every  effort to follow the event until it has resolved or stabilized. Follow -up 
procedures in Section 5.9 must be followed.Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

54
Protocol 405 -201-00014
Confidential -Proprietary Information 55 Version 4.0, 15 Jan 20203.8.3.3 Withdrawal of Consent
All subjects have the right to withdraw their consent from further part icipation in the trial 
at an y time without prejudice. Subjects cannot withdraw consent for use of data alread y 
collected as part of the trial, but only  for future participation. The investigator can also 
discontinue a subject’s participation in the trial a t any  time if medicall y necessary. Unless 
the subject provides their written withdrawal of consent or there is other written 
documentation by  the investigator confirming the subject’s verbal intent to completely  
withdraw from the trial, subjects should be followed for all protocol -specified evaluations 
and assessments, if possible.
Complete withdrawal of consent requires a subject’s refusal of ALL of the following 
methods of follow up (these methods of follow up will also be noted in the trial eI CF):
Participation in all follow -up procedures specified in the protocol (whether in- clinic, 
by telephone, or by  an in -home visit).
Participation in a subset of protocol specified follow -up procedures (by  a frequency  
schedule and method, as agreed b y subject and staff).
Contact of the subject b y trial personnel, even if only  by telephone, to assess current 
medical condition, and obtain necessary  medical or laboratory  reports relevant to the 
trial’s objectives.
Contact of alternative person(s) who have been designa ted in source records as being 
available to discuss the subject’s medical condition, even if onl y by telephone, mail, 
or e-mail (eg, famil y, spouse, partner, legal representative, friend, neighbor, or 
physician).
Access to medical information from alternative sources (eg, hospital/clinic medical 
records, referring doctor’s notes, public records, dialy sis, transplantation or vital 
registries, social media sources).
Withdrawal of consent is a critical trial event and therefore should be approached with 
the sa me degree of importance and care as is used in initially  obtaining informed consent. 
The reasons for a subject’s intended withdrawal need to be completely  understood, 
documented, and managed to protect the rights of the subject and the integrity  of the trial. 
A subject may  initially  express their desire to discontinue I MP administration, which is 
not equivalent to a complete withdrawal of consent for further participation (see 
Section 3.8.3.1). A subject may , however, indicate that further trial participation is 
creating a burden on their work or social schedule. Therefore, the investigator should 
follow the procedures outlined in Section
3.8.3.4 to determine if the subject can continue 
participation in the trial if modifications to his/her treat ment or schedule of assessments 
can be accommodated. Only  subjects who withdraw their permission for all of the above Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

3.8.3.4 Procedures to Encourage Contin ued Trial Participation
In all cases of impending I MP discontinuation or consent withdrawal, investigators will 
meet and discuss with the subject their options of continuing in the trial, preferabl y on 
therap y. The investigator should ensure understanding and documentation of the reasons 
for the subject’s desire to withdraw consent.
3.9 Screen Failures
A screen failure subject is one from whom informed consent is obtained and is 
documented in writing (ie, subject signs an eICF), but who is not randomized or ass igned 
to trial treatment.
For this trial, treatment begins with the first dose of the IMP in the single -blind placebo 
run-in period . Subjects that have a positive alcohol test ( via breathaly zer or blood ), or 
positive drug screen for cocaine, or other illic it drugs (excluding marijuana) are not 
eligible to be retested or rescreened, and will be considered screen failures. Subjects that 
test positive for marijuana may  be permitted to be enrolled if they  have no evidence of a 
substance use disorder, and if the y agree to refrain from use for the duration of the trial. 
Allowance for subjects testing positive for marijuana at screening require explicit 
approval from the medical monitor. Subjects that test positive for confirmed prescription 
use of ADHD medications at screening will be required to undergo a washout period 
(Section
4.1). If after the allotted washout period, a subject tests positive for ADHD 
medications prior to the start of the single blind placebo run -in period, subjects will be 
screen failed, and not permitted to rescreen. Screen failures previously  excluded for a 
positive urine drug screen due to use of prescription or over -the-counter (OTC) 
medications or products not used for the treatment of ADHD, may
 be retested or 
rescreened for participation in the trial only  with the explicit consent of the medical 
monitor. Subjects will be administered the ASRS prior to the start of the single -blind 
placebo run -in period, and those with a ≥ 30% improvement in the (18 - item) ADHD 
Symptoms score compared to the score at screening will be screen failed, and not eligible 
for rescre ening. Screen failures excluded for any  other reasons may  be rescreened at an y 
time if the exclusion characteristic has changed. In the event that a screen failure is 
rescreened a new eICF must be signed, a new screening number assigned, and all 
screening procedures repeated.Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 405 -201-00014
Confidential -Proprietary Information 57 Version 4.0, 15 Jan 20203.10 Definition of Completed Subjects
The treatment period is defined as the time period during which subjects are evaluated for 
primary  and secondary  objectives of the trial irrespective of whether or not the subject 
actuall y consumed all doses of the IMP. Subjects who are evaluated at the last scheduled 
visit during the treatment period will be defined as trial completers. For purposes of this 
trial, subjects who complete the Day 42/ET visit will be defined as trial completers.
3.11 Definition of Subjects Lost to Follow -up
Subjects who cannot be contacted on or before Day 42/ET during the treatment period, 
who do not have a known reason for discontinuation (eg, withdrew consent or AE), and 
for whom a survival status at the end of the trial canno t be determined will be classified 
as “lost to follow -up” as the reason for discontinuation. Survival status can be determined 
from a variety  of sources, either by  obtaining acceptable documentation for death (ie, 
death certificate, medical records, public records, statement by  a famil y member or 
primary  care ph ysician) or acceptable documentation for life (ie, direct contact with the 
subject, medical records, successful telephone contact with the subject, statement by  a 
family  member or primary  care phy sician, or public records).
The site will make 3 documented attempts to contact the subject b y telephone and in the 
event the site is unable to reach the subject b y telephone, the site will attempt to contact 
the subject via certified mail or an alternative s imilar method, where appropriate, before 
assigning a “lost to follow -up” status.
3.12 Subject Compliance
Responsible trial personnel will dispense the IMP according to the visits outlined in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3.7-1 ). Accountability  and compliance verification will 
be monitored with a medication adherence monitoring platform, a
nd results should be 
documented in the subject’s trial records. Su bjects must be counseled on the importance 
of taking the IMP as directed at all trial visits. If poor compliance continues (eg, multiple 
missed doses resulting in less than 80% overall compliance), discontinuation of the 
subject from the trial should be co nsidered.
Details on the AiCure technology  to be used in this trial to assess I MP compliance are 
provided below.Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

confirm IMP ingestion. In addition, built- in reminders and a communication sy stem 
allow real time intervention in case of IMP interruptions.
Use of th is AiCure Platform will in no way  supersede or replace the phy sician or 
prescribed IMP protocol of the subjects. Because the AiCure Platform does not change 
the IMP protocol of the subjects, but rather encourages adherence to the predefined 
protocol, use o f this AiCure Platform presents minimal risk to the subjects. Use of the 
AiCure Platform will be required for all subjects in the trial.
The monitoring AiCure Platform requires that all subjects take each dose of the IMP 
while using a smartphone. The AiCur e Platform will be provided to subjects preloaded on 
a smartphone, or subjects will download the AiCure Platform onto their own mobile 
device at the start of the single -blind placebo run- in period (Day  −7).
When at home, subjects will receive an IMP 
reminder at a time within a predefined 
window. This notification reminds subjects to take their IMP dose while using the AiCure 
Platform. Subjects will follow a series of prescribed steps in front of the front facing 
webcam to visuall y confirm their ingestion of the IMP. The application on the 
smartphone will make an automated determination of whether the subject has properl y 
taken their IMP at the prescribed time. There is no need for the trial site staff to review 
the administration, nor would the trial s ite staff need to be available at the time the 
subject takes their IMP. The amount of guidance that the device provides to the subjects 
is automatically  reduced as the subject becomes more proficient at using the application.
After the device confirms proper IMP ingestion, video recordings will be encry pted and 
transmitted to a secure centralized location for further anal ysis, including testing for 
duplicate enrollment. The captured data and video are reviewable through a roles and 
rules restricted s ystem e nsuring privacy  of the information. The sy stem is compliant with 
the Health Insurance Portability  and Accountability  Act (HIPAA), which protects the 
privacy  and securit y of healthcare information.
Phone numbers of the subjects may  also be collected and sto red in an encry pted manner. 
Storing the phone numbers will allow for direct communication with subjects, including 
automated messaging from the AiCure Platform device and contact b y the trial site staff 
or other monitoring personnel. At no time is the phon e number visible to the trial site 
staff or monitoring personnel on the AiCure Platform. I ndividuals outside the trial site Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

3.12.2 AiCure Subject Risk
The AiCure Pl atform provides no more than minimal risk to subjects. This protocol only  
introduces a smartphone- based monitoring application that prompts the user to take their 
IMP, verifies ingestion, and stores encry pted data securel y for analysis. When 
functioning pr operl y, use of the AiCure Platform does not affect titration, dosage, route 
of administration, or treatment duration, conforming to an y trial requirements as noted by  
trial site staff. 
It is possible, though very unlikel y, that the AiCure application can fail to remind 
subjects to take the IMP or tell them to take their IMP when not required. To date, 
AiCure has not encountered such a malfunction.
All trial data, including any  identifiable subject information, will be obtained and 
encry pted b y the applicat ion. Subjects will be coded according to the protocol and their 
identity  will not be stored with the trial data obtained. After the subject has taken the IMP 
and confirmation of proper ingestion has been completed, the encry pted data will be 
automatically  forwarded to a secure server. The server is compliant with the HIPAA, 
which protects the privacy and security of healthcare information. The data will be 
securel y stored and onl y accessible to the trial site staff and other authorized personnel 
through two -way authentication.
The data may  also be retained in a secure manner beyond the term of the trial and utilized 
to improve the operation of the AiCure Platform, categorize adherence activity  by disease 
state or other useful categories, or for regulatory  filings by  the AiCure Platform Provider 
to support future applications for the AiCure Platform Provider’s product. Individuals 
who are not associated with the care and treatment of subjects will not have access to 
subject identity  or any  medical records.
3.12.3 AiCure Subject Confidentiality
The AiCure Platform Provider will protect subjects’ personal information to the full 
extent required by law. However, information from this trial, including de -identified 
video recording(s) of subject performance of various acti ons, may  be submitted to the 
trial site, and potentially  to the FDA. Both information obtained by the application, and 
information in the subject Informed Consent, may be examined by  the trial site or the trial 
site’s representatives, and may  also be reviewed by  the FDA and other regulatory  
agencies, IRBs, or Ethics Committee(s). All of these parties are bound to safeguard the Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

In the event of a significant deviation from the protocol due to an emergency , accident, or 
mistake (eg, violation of informed consent process, I MP dispensing or subject dosing 
error, treatment assignment error, subject enrolled in violation of eligibility  criteria or 
concomitant medication criteria) , the investigator or designee will contact the sponsor or 
designee at the earliest possible time by  telephone. The investigator and sponsor will 
come as quickl y as possible to a joint decision regarding the subject’s continuation in the 
trial. This decision will be documented by the investigator and the sponsor, and reviewed 
by the site monitor.

consumption of caffeine is permitted.
The subject’s best medical interests should guide the investigator in the management of 
conditions that are pre -existing or that develop during the trial (intercurrent illness or 
AEs) . The investigator should examine the acceptability of all concomitant medications 
not explicitly  prohibited. In order to ensure that appropriate concomitant therap y is 
administered, it is essential that subjects be instructed not to take an y medications ( either 
self-administered non -prescription drugs or prescription therapy  prescribed by  another 
physician) without prior consultation with the investigator. All trial personnel should be 
familiar with the content of the centanafadine IB in order to manage th e subject’s

Protocol 405 -201-00014
Confidential -Proprietary Information 63 Version 4.0, 15 Jan 20205 Reporting of A dverse Events
5.1 Definitions
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinic al trial subject 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessaril y have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. A dverse events would not include information recorded 
as medic al history  at screening for pre planned procedures for which the u nderly ing 
condition was known and no worsening occurred. An adverse reaction is any  untoward 
and unintended response to an I MP related to any  dose administered.
A suspected adverse reaction is any  AE for which there is a reasonable possibility  that the 
IMP caused the AE. For the purpose of Investigational New Drug (IND) safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility ” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between 
the IMP and the AE. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certaint y about 
causality .
An SAE includes an y event that results in any of the following outcomes:
Death
Life-threatening; ie, the subject was, in the opinion of the investigator, at immediate 
risk of death from the event as it occurred. It does not include an ev ent that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.
Persistent or significant incapacity /disability  or substantial disruption of the ability  to 
conduct normal life functions.
Requires in- patient hospitalization or prolongs hospitaliza tion.
Hospitalization itself should not be reported as an SAE; whenever possible the 
reason for the hospitalization should be reported.
Hospitalizations or prolonged hospitalizations for social admissions (ie, those 
required for reasons of convenience or o ther non- medical need) are not 
considered SAEs.
Congenital anomal y/birth defect.
Other medicall y significant events that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject and may  require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above; eg, allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency  room or home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.
Nonserious adverse events are all AEs that do not meet the criteria for a "serious" AE.Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

63
Protocol 405 -201-00014
Confidential -Proprietary Information 64 Version 4.0, 15 Jan 2020Immediately  Reportable Event (IRE):
Any SAE.
Any AESI  (see Section 5.4).
Any AE related to occupational exposure.
Potential serious hepatotoxicity  (see Section 5.6).
Pregnancies are also defined as IREs. Although normal pregnancy  is not an AE, it 
will mandate IMP discontinuation and must be reported on an IRE form to the 
sponsor. Pregnancy  will only  be documented on the AE eCRF if there is an 
abnormality  or complication.
Clinical L aboratory  Test Value Changes : It is the investigator’s responsibility  to review 
the results of all laboratory  tests as they  become available. This review will be 
documented b y the investigator’s dated signature on the laboratory  report. For each 
abnormal laboratory  test result, the investigator needs to ascertain if this is an abnormal 
(ie, clinicall y significant) change from baseline for that individual subject. This 
determination, however, does not necessarily  need to be made the first time an abnormal 
value is observed. The investigator may  repeat the laboratory  test or request additional 
tests to verify  the results of the original laboratory tests. I f this laboratory  value is 
considered medicall y relevant by  the investigator (subject is sy mptomatic, requiring 
corrective treatment or further evaluation), or if the laboratory  value leads to 
discontinuation, or fulfills a seriousness criterion, this is considered an AE.
Severity :Adverse events will be graded on a 3 -point scale and reported as indicated on 
the eCRF . The intensit y of an adverse experience is defined as follows:
1 = Mild: Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily  activity .
2 = Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect nor mal daily  activit y.
3 = Severe: Inability  to work or perform normal daily  activity .
IMP Causalit y:Assessment of causal relationship of an AE to the use of the IMP is 
defined as follows:
Related : There is a reasonable possibility  of a temporal and causal 
relationship between the IMP and the AE.
Not Related : There is no temporal or causal relationship between the I MP and 
the AE.Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 405 -201-00014
Confidential -Proprietary Information 65 Version 4.0, 15 Jan 20205.2 Eliciting and Reporting A dverse Events
The investigator will periodically  assess subjects for the occurrence of AEs. To avoid 
bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked the non- leading question: “How have you 
felt since your last visit?” AllAEs (serious and nonserious) reported b y the subject must 
be recorded on the source documents and eCRF provided by  the sponsor. Serious AE
collection is to begin after a subject has signed the eI CF.
Use medical terminology in AE reporting. Adverse events should be reported as a single 
unify ing diagnosis whenever possible or, in the absence of a unify ing diagnosis, as 
individual signs or sy mptoms. Exacerbation or disease progression should be reported as 
an AE onl y if there are unusual or severe clinical features that were not present, or 
experienced earlier, or not expected based on the course of the condition.
In addition, the sponsor must b e notified immediately b y telephone, fax, or e- mail of an y 
IREs according to the procedure outlined below, in Section 5.3. Special attention should 
be paid to recording hospitalization and concomitant medications.
5.3 Immediately  Reportable Events
The investigator must immediately  report after either the investigator or site personnel 
become aware of an y SAE, AE related to occupational exposure, AESI , potential serious 
hepatotoxicity , or confirmed pregnancy , by telephone, fax, or e -mail to the spons or or 
designee using the contact information on the cover page of this protocol. An I RE form 
must be completed and sent by  e-mail, fax, or overnight courier to the sponsor or 
designee . (Please note that the I RE form is NOT the AE eCRF .)
Subjects experienci ng SAEs should be followed clinically  until their health has returned 
to baseline status, or until all parameters have returned to normal or have otherwise been 
explained. I t is expected that the investigator will provide or arrange appropriate 
supportive care for the subject and will provide prompt updates on the subject’s status to 
the sponsor or designee .
5.4 Adverse Events of Special Interest
Newl y acquired skin eruptions that are non -traumatic will be considered AESI s. These 
may include, but are not limite d to eruptions such as skin rashes, skin irritations, skin 
reactions, or acneiform lesions. This does not include localized contact irritation at ECG 
lead sites due to application or removal of lead adhesive.Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

acquired skin eruption that is non- traumatic. The trial site will have a local designated 
dermatologist available for immediate cons ultation during the trial for these AESIs.
All AESI s should be reported as IREs ( Section 5.3).
5.5 Abuse Potential Monitoring Plan, Events Subject to Additional 
Monitoring, and Medication Handling Irregularities
A key  objective of the Abuse Potential Monitoring Plan (APMP) is to monitor for 
instances of abuse or diversion of the trial medication and other psy choactive substances. 
In addition to monitoring for irregularities in medication handling, AEs that may  be 
suggestive of a developing abuse issue will also receive special attention. As part of the 
APMP, medication handling irregularities (MHIs) must be reported, an d AEs related to 
abuse potential and AEs involving MHIs must be reported as Events Subject to 
Additional Monitoring (ESAMs) with detailed narratives. 
Investigators and site staff at each trial site will be trained on reporting potentially  abuse -
related AE s (eg, recording a description of the event in the subject’s own words in the 
source documents as well as the eCRF, in addition to the clinical term, and to be aware 
that a subject’s report may  encompass more than one event and that these should be 
recorde d separatel y). The investigators will be provided with examples of potentially  
abuse -related AEs, and trained on how to handle such events (eg, additional monitoring). 
While the investigators will be provided with examples of AE terms as a guide during 
trial conduct, the analy sis of potentially abuse -related AEs will be based on a search of all 
Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities ( MedDRA ) preferred terms, all verbatim 
terms, and an y open text fields within the AE data to identify text strings sugge stive of 
abuse potential, in line with the 2017 FDA guidance (Assessment of Abuse Potential of 
Drugs).40Refer to the separate APMP documentation for complete details on MHI s and 
ESAMs, including documenting and report ing procedures, examples of potentially  abuse -
related AE terms that meet the criteria for ESAM reporting, and guidance for the training 
of investigators and trial site staff.
5.6 Potential Serious Hepatotoxicity
For a subject who experiences an elevation in aspartate aminotransferase ( AST )or 
alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) that is  3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) , a total 
bilirubin level should also be evaluated. If the total bilirubin is 2 times the ULN, 
complete an IRE form with all values listed and also report as an AE on the eCRF .Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 405 -201-00014
Confidential -Proprietary Information 67 Version 4.0, 15 Jan 20205.7 Pregnancy
Females of childbearing potential are defined as female subjects for whom menstruation 
has started and who are not documented as sterile (ie, have had a bilateral oophorectom y 
or hy sterectom y or who have been postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months).
For FOCBP and for males who are sexually  active, there must be a documented 
agreement that the subject and their partner will take effective measures 
(ie,double -barrier method) to prevent pregnancy  durin g the course of the trial and for 
30days after the last dose of IMP for female subjects, and 90 days after the last dose of 
IMP for male subjects and their partners who are FOCBP. Unless the subject is sterile (ie, 
women who have had a bilateral oophorectomy  or hy sterectom y or who have been 
postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months; or men who have had a bilateral 
orchidectom y) or remains abstinent, 2 of the following preca utions must be used: 
vasectom y, tubal ligation, vaginal diaphragm, intrauterine device, birth control pills, birth 
control injection, birth control implant, birth control patch, condom with spermicide, or 
sponge with spermicide. Any  single method of birth control, including vasectomy  and 
tubal ligation, may  fail, leading to pregnancy . The contraceptive method will be 
documented at each trial visit. Male subjects must also agree not to donate sperm from 
screening through 90 days after the last dose of IMP.
Before enrolling FOCBP in this clinical trial, investigators must review the below 
guidelines about trial participation with all FOCBP . The topics should generall y include:
General information
Informed consent form
Pregnancy  prevention information
Drug inte ractions with hormonal contraceptives
Contraceptives in current use
Guidelines for the follow -up of a reported pregnancy
Before trial enrollment, FOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding 
pregnancy  during trial participation and the potential ris k factors for an unintentional 
pregnancy . The subject must sign an informed consent form stating that the 
abovementioned risk factors and the consequences were discussed with her.
A urine or serum pregnancy  test for human chorionic gonadotropin will be per formed at 
screening on all subjects that are FOCBP . If a urine test is performed and is positive, the 
investigator will follow up with a confirmatory  serum test.Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

67
Protocol 405 -201-00014
Confidential -Proprietary Information 68 Version 4.0, 15 Jan 2020During the trial, all FOCBP should be instructed to contact the investigator immediately  
if they  suspect they  might be pregnant (eg, missed or late menstrual cy cle).
If a subject is suspected to be pregnant before she receives IMP, the IMP administration 
must be withheld until the results of serum pregnancy  tests are available. If the pregnancy  
is confirmed, the subject must not receive the IMP and must not be enrolled in the trial. If 
pregnancy  is suspected while the subject is taking IMP, the IMP must be withheld 
immediately  (if reasonable, taking into consideration any  potential withdrawal risks) until 
the result of the pregnancy test is known. If pregnancy  is confirmed, the I MP will be 
permanentl y discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary for 
subject safet y) and the subject will be withdrawn from the trial.
The inves tigator must immediately  notify  the sponsor of any  pregnancy  associated with 
IMP exposure during the trial and for 30 day s after the last dose of IMP for female 
subjects, and for 90 day s after the last dose of IMP for partners of male subjects , and 
record the event on the IRE form and forward it to the sponsor. The sponsor will forward 
Pregnancy  Surveillance Form(s) for monitoring the outcome of the pregnancy .
Protocol -required procedures for trial discontinuation and follow- up must be performed 
on the subj ect unless contraindicated b y pregnancy (eg, x -ray studies). Other appropriate 
pregnancy  follow -up procedures should be considered, if indicated. In addition, the 
investigator must report to the sponsor, on appropriate Pregnancy Surveillance Form(s), 
follow- up information regarding the course of the pregnancy , including perinatal and 
neonatal outcome. Infants will be followed for a minimum of 6 months from the date of 
birth.
5.8 Procedure for Breaking the Blind
The investigator is encouraged to contact the spon sor/clinical research organization 
(CRO) medical monitor to discuss their rationale for unblinding. However, to prevent 
delay s to the investigator or medical personnel responding to a potentiall y emergent 
situation, unblinding of IMP will not be dependent upon the investigator receiving 
approval from the sponsor/CRO medical advisor (ie, the investigator will be able to 
obtain the code break information independent of the sponsor/CRO medical advisor). The 
investigator must contact the sponsor/CRO medical adv isor by  telephone or e- mail with 
an explanation of the need for opening the treatment assignment code within 24 hours of 
opening the code. If the blind is broken, the Clinical Safet y and Pharmacovigilance 
department must be notified immediately (see the cover page of this protocol for contact 
information). Documentation of breaking the blind should be recorded in the subject’s 
medical record with the date and time the blind was broken and the names of the Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

treatment with the IMP.
5.9 Follow -up of A dverse Events
5.9.1 Follow -up of Nonserious A dverse Events
Nonserious AEs that are identified at an y time during the trial must be recorded on the 
AE eCRF with the current status (ongo ing or resolved/recovered) noted. All nonserious 
events (that are not IREs) that are ongoing at the last scheduled contact will be recorded 
as ongoing on the eCRF . For an y AE having been identified throughout the trial, during 
analysis, additional relevant medical history  information may  be requested by  the sponsor 
to further ascertain causality  (including, but not limited to, information such as 
risk-related behavior, family  history  and occupation).
5.9.2 Follow -up of Serious A dverse Events and Immediately  
Repor table Events
This trial requires that subjects that complete the trial be activel y monitored for SAEs and 
IREs up to 7 day s after the last dose of IMP is administered. Subjects that decide to not 
enroll in Trial 405 -
201-00015, or for subjects that do not c omplete Trial 405 -201-00014, 
will be activel y monitored for SAEs and IREs up to 10days after the last dose of IMP is 
administered.
Serious AEs and nonserious I REs that are 
identified or ongoing at the last scheduled 
contact must be recorded as such on the AE eCRF page. If updated information (eg, 
resolved status) on SAE or I RE status becomes available after a subject’s last scheduled 
contact (up to last in -clinic visit for the entire trial), this must be reported to the sponsor 
according to the appro priate reporting procedures. The investigator will follow SAEs 
until the events are resolved, stabilized, or the subject is lost to follow -up or has died. 
Resolution means that the subject has returned to the baseline state of health and 
stabilized means t hat the investigator does not expect an y further improvement or

6 Pharmacokinetic/pharmacogenomic A nalysis
The PK samples will be anal yzed for centanafadine (EB -1020) and its metabolite(s)
concentrations . Times postdose will be determined from the date and t ime of first pill 
captured b y AiCure for the dose prior to the PK sample and the sampling date and time 
captured in the eCRF; for the sample taken 7 day s after the last dose of IMP (Day 49 for 
completers), the date and time of the first pill from last dose taken (on Day 42 for 
completers) will be used as the date and time of the dose prior to the sample. No formal 
statistical comparisons are planned. A separate population or PK/pharmacogenomic 
modeling may  be performed using the data from this trial and other trials.
7 Statistical A nalysis
7.1 Sample Size
The p rimary  efficacy  endpoint is the change from baseline atDay 42 in AISRS total 
score. The trial will compare the placebo arm to the centanafadine dose arms, randomized 
at a ratio of 1:1:1, with an overall alpha of 0.05 for the primary  endpoint.
Based on the results at various dose strengths from phase 2 centanafadine trials, it is 
reasonable to expect a treatment difference of 5 points with a standard deviation (SD) of 
12.5 in the mean change from baseline to Day  42 on AI SRS total score in either the 
200mg TDD or 400 mg TDD arms . The planned sample size of 405 evaluable subjects 
(135 in each treatment arm) will y ield at least 90% power to detect the treatment effects 
at a 2
-tailed significance level of 0.05. The 2 -sided alpha level for the final anal ysis is 
0.05.
A sufficient number of subjects will be enrolled and randomized to achieve 
approximately  405 evaluable subjects in the double -
blind treatment period (ie, subjects 
with a nAISRS total score at baseline and at least 1 subsequent AISRS total score in the Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

double -blind treatment period, the total number of subjects to be randomized is 
450subjects (150 subjects in each treatment arm). In order to ensure 405 evaluable 
subjec ts, the number of nonevaluable subjects will be monitored in a blinded manner on 
an ongoing basis during the trial. The power and sample size were obtained using the 
PASS 14 (2015) statistical computing software.
7.1.1 Datasets for A nalysis
The following samples are defined for this trial:
Enrolled Sample: comprises all subjects who signed an eICF for the trial and enrolled 
into the single -blind placebo run- in period
Randomized Sample: comprises of all subjects who were randomized in the 
double -blind treatment pe riod. Subjects are considered randomized when they  are 
assigned a treatment group by eCRF at the end of the single -blind placebo run -in 
period. A subject receiving IMP outside of the eCRF will not be considered 
randomized, but safet y will be reported.
Safety Sample: comprises those randomized subjects in the double -blind treatment 
period who receive at least 1 dose of double -blind IMP as indicated on the dosing 
record. Subjects will only  be excluded from this population if there is documented 
evidence (ie, drug dispensed = drug returned or no I MP dispensed) that the subject 
did not take I MP. If a subject is dispensed IMP and is lost to follow -up, he/she will be 
considered exposed.
Efficacy  Sample: the Full Analy sis Set (FAS) comprises all subjects in the Saf ety 
Sample who have a baseline value and at least 1 valid post -randomization efficacy  
evaluation for AI SRS total score in the double -blind treatment period.
The core dataset for all efficacy  anal yses is the FAS, which is created based on the 
intent -to-treat (ITT) principle. However, as will be described below, in order to handle 
missing data and restrictions imposed by  different ty pes of anal yses (eg, change from 
baseline anal ysis), datasets derived from the FAS dataset will be used for the efficacy  
analysis.
7.2 Handling of Missing Data
The AISRS is utilized as the primary  efficacy  assessment of a subject’s level of ADHD 
symptoms. This 18 -item scale directly  corresponds to the 18 DSM -5symptoms of ADHD 
where 9 Inattentiveness items alternate with 9 Hy peractivit y/Impulsivity items. Each item 
is scored as follows: 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), 3 (severe). For all items, 0 is the 
“best” rating and 3 is the “ worst ”rating. The maximum total score for the scale is 
54points, with 27 points for each subscale. The AISRS total score is the sum of the 
Inattentiveness and Hyperactivity /Impulsivity subscale scores. The range o f the AISRS Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 405 -201-00014
Confidential -Proprietary Information 72 Version 4.0, 15 Jan 2020total score is from 0 to 54. The AISRS I nattentive subscale score and 
Hyperactivity /Impulsivity subscale score, as well as the AISRS total score is set to be 
missing if more than one item of a subscale is missing for Inattentiveness subscale or 
Hyperactivity /Impulsivity subscale, separatel y. If one item is missing for a given subscale 
(Inattentiveness or Hyperactivity /Impulsivity ), then the subscale score will be derived as 
the mean of scores for non -missing items multip liedby 9. All imputed scores are rounded 
to the first decimal place.
The mixed -effect model repeated measures ( MMRM )assumes data are missing at 
random (MAR), whi ch is a reasonable assumption in longitudinal clinical trials in 
ADHD. However, the possibility  of “missing not at random” (MNAR) data can never be 
ruled out. As sensitivity  anal yses, either selection model41pattern-mixture 
model42,43,44,45or shared parameter model46will be used to explore data missing 
mechanisms of MNAR and investigate the response profile of dropout reason. Pattern 
Mixture Models based on Multiple I mputation (MI) with mixed missing data mechanisms 
will be used to investigate the response profile of dropout subjects by last dropout reason 
under MNAR mechanism for the following 3 scenarios: 1) Dropout reasons due to either 
AE or lack of efficacy  
as MNAR, 2) Dropout reasons due to either AE or lack of efficacy  
or subject withdrew consent as MNAR, 3) All dropout s as MNAR using both 1) Delta 
adjustment imputation method which is to departure from MAR assumption by  
progressivel y increasing the delta until conclusion from the primary anal ysis is 
overturned, and 2) Placebo based imputation methods in which missing da ta for both 
placebo and drug group are imputed based on the imputation model derived from placebo 
data. If drug improved outcomes prior to dropout, this benefit is carried into subsequent 
imputed values, but will diminish over time in accordance with the c orrelation structure. 
Details of these exploratory  analyses will be provided in the s tatistical analysis plan 
(SAP).
7.3 Primary , 
Secondary , and Exploratory Endpoint A nalyses
7.3.1 Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint A nalysis
The objective of the primary  efficacy  anal ysis is to compare the efficacy  between 
centanafadine (SR 200 mg TDD or SR 400 mg TDD )and placebo. The primary  efficacy  
endpoint is the change from baseline to Day  42in AI SRS total score. For analy sis of the 
double -blind treatment period data, baseline is defined as the last available measurement 
prior to the first dose of double
-blind I MP in the double -blind treatment period.
The estimand for the primary  efficacy  anal ysis is the difference in outcome improvement 
if all subjects tolerated and adhered to the ir treatment. This approach is Estimand #3,Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

report on prevention and treatment of missing data and I CH E9 (R1) “Addendum to 
Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials on Choosi ng Appropriate Estimands and Defining 
Sensitivity  Anal yses in Clinical Trials”.
This estimand focuses on the efficacy  of centanafadine (SR 200 mg TDD or SR 400 mg 
TDD) in cha nge from the baseline in AISRS t otal s core. The objective of this trial is 
consist ent with the election of an efficacy rather than effectiveness estimand.
The primary  anal ysis will be performed on the Efficacy  Sample which includes all 
randomized subjects who took at least 1 dose of IMP in the double -blind treatment period 
and who have both baseline and at least 1 post -randomization AI SRS total score during 
the double- blind treatment period. The primary  efficacy  anal ysis will be performed b y 
fitting a MMRM anal ysis with an unstructured variance covariance structure in which the 
change fr om baseline in AI SRS total score at the scheduled double -blind treatment period 
visits will be the dependent variable based on the observed cases ( OC)data set. The 
model will include fixed class effect terms for treatment, trial center, visit day, and an 
interaction term of treatment by  visit day. The model will also include baseline values for 
the double
-blind treatment period of AISRS t otal score and the interaction term of 
baseline values of AISRS total score by  visit dayas covariates. The primary  comp arison 
between the centanafadine (400 mg TDD group or 200 mg TDD group )and the placebo 
group at Day  42in the double -blind treatment phase will be estimated as the difference 
between Least Squares means utilizing the computing software SAS procedure PROC 
MIXED. The comparison between the centanafadine (400 mg TDD group or the 200 mg 
TDD group )and the plac ebo group will be tested at a significance level of 0.05 (2 -sided)
in the order of 1) 400 mg versus placebo, and 2) 200 mg versus placebo .If there is a 
convergence problem with the unstructured variance covariance matrix of the MMRM 
model , the following structures other than unstructured will be used in order of 
1) heterogeneous toeplitz, 2) heterogeneous autoregressive of order 1, and 
3)heterogeneous compound sy mmetry  and the first (co)variance structure converging to 
the best fit will be used as the pri mary  anal ysis. If a structured covariance has to be used, 
the “sandwich” estimator of the standard error of the fixed effects parameters will be used 
in order to deal with possible model misspecification of the covariance matrix. Details of 
this analy sis w ill be provided in the SAP.
Small centers will be defined as centers that do not have at least 1 evaluable subject 
(evaluable with regard to the primary  efficacy  variable) in each treatment arm in the 
double -blind treatment period . All small centers will b e pooled to form “pseudo centers”

subjects who have baseline and at least 1 post -baseline value for the primary  endpoint in 
the double- blind treatment period ). The process will start by  pooling the largest of the 
small centers with the smallest of the small centers until a non -small center is formed. 
This process will be repeated usin g the centers left out of the previous pass. I n case of ties 
in center size, the center with the smallest center code will be selected. If any centers are 
left out at the end of this process, they  will be pooled with the smallest pseudo centers, or 
if no pseudo centers exist, they  will be pooled with the smallest non -small center.
In the case of gross violations of the linear model assumptions, nonparametric van 
Elteren test will be performed to compare the treatment effect at Day 42in the 
double -blind treatment period on both last-observation -carried- forward ( LOCF) and MI 
data. Detail swill be provided in the SAP.
7.3.1.1 Sensitivity Analyses
7.3.1.1.1 Sensitivity Analyses for Missing at Random A ssumption
Traditionally  the dropout mechanisms are divided into 3types43: (1) missing c ompletely  
at random (MCAR), in which the probability  of dropout doesn’t depend on the observed 
data and the missing data; (2) MAR, in which the probability of dropout depends on the 
observed data, and (3) MNAR, where the probability  of dropout depends on the missing 
data and possibly  the observed data.
Most of MNAR methods41have treated all observations with dropout as if they fall 
within the same dropout typ e. In practice, we would find that different dropout reasons 
may be related to the outcomes in different way s, for example, detailed dropout reasons 
for this trial are: AE, lack of efficacy , death, reasons unrelated to medical condition, 
withdrawal of info rmed consent, lost to follow -up, rash, pregnancy, and termination of all 
or part of the trial by  sponsor . Dropout due to an AE , rash, and LOE ma y lead to MNAR 
dropout. Subjects that withdr ew consent may  also lead to MNAR dropout. However, it is 
debatable w hether a dropout caused by  subjects 
that withdrew consent areMAR or 
MNAR. Except AE, rash, LOE, and subject s that withdrew consent, all the other dropout 
reasons may  be assumed as either MCAR or MAR dropout.
As sensitivity  anal yses for MAR assumptions , analyses for MNAR will be carried out. 
Pattern Mixture Models based on MI with mixed missing data mechanisms will be used 
to investigate the response profile of dropout subjects by last dropout reason under the 
MNAR mechanism for the following 3scenarios:
1) Dropout reasons due to either AE , rash, or LOE as MNARClinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

3)All dropouts as MNAR
Delta Adjustment Imputation Methods
This MNAR sensitivity  analy sis will be performed to address a departure from the MAR 
assumptions by progressively  increasing the delta until the conclusion from the p rimary  
analysis is overturned. The delta is 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, .., 100% of the expected 
treatment difference of 5 points and/or the observed treatment difference between 
centanafadine and placebo from the primary  anal ysis of MMRM model until the 
conclusion of the primary anal ysis is overturned. When delta=0 it is MAR. When delta 
>0 it is MNAR.
1)Using Monte Carlo Markov Chain methodology  from PROC MI  to impute the 
intermittent missing data to a monotone missing pattern;
2)Using a standard MAR -based multiple imputation approach from PROC MI to 
impute the monotone missingne ss data
3)For subjects in the treated group and with a dropout reason of AE or LOE or 
subject withdrew consent, a delta will be added for all the values after the dropout 
time. 
4)Using MMRM model in the primary  analy sis to analy zed the completed data 
using PR OC MI XED on the multiple imputed data
5)Obtaining the overal l results using PROC MI ANALYZE
Placebo Based Imputation Methods
The placebo -based imputation methods will be similar to the “Standard” multiple 
imputations method , except the parameters for the impu tation model will only  be 
obtained from the placebo (control) group. Missing data for both the placebo and drug
group sare imputed based on the imputation model derived from placebo data. If drug 
improved the outcomes prior to dropout, this benefit is carr ied into subsequent imputed 
values, but will diminish over time in accordance with the correlation structure.
In addition, model based MNAR methods such as the shared parameter model46and 
random coefficient pattern mixture mode l44will be also performed.
7.3.1.1.2 Sensitivity Analyses for Violation of Normality  Assumption
The primary  endpoint MMRM analy sis is a maximum likelihood method that relies on 
the normality  assumption. Residual anal yses will be carried o ut to examine model

test47will be performed to compare treatment effect at Day 42on both LOCF dataset and 
MI data. The van Elteren test is a generalized Cochran Mantel Haenszel ( CMH )
procedure useful for stratified continuous data in non -normal setting. It belongs to a 
general family  of Mantel -Haenszel mean score tests. The test is pe rformed via SAS 
procedure PROC FREQ, by  including CMH2 and SCORES=MODRI DIT options in the 
TABLE statement. The stratifi cation factor is trial center.
In addition, other methods that are robust to distributional assumption will also be 
performed to provide different views on the primary  efficacy  result, these include 
generalized estimating equations (GEE), weighted GEE, and MI-robust regression.48
For MI -van Elteren test and MI -robust regression, imputation datasets will be generated 
with SAS MI  procedure, each dataset will be analy zed, and then an overall estimate is 
derived with SAS MIANALYZE procedure.
7.3.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses
7.3.2.1 Key Secondary  Efficacy  Endpoint Analysis
The key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint is the change from baseline to Day 42between 
treatment groups using the CGI -S. The estimand for the key  secondary  efficacy  anal ysis 
is also the difference in outcome improvement if all subjects tolerated and adhered to 
their treatment. This approach is Es timand #3 recommended by  the 2010 National 
Academ y of Sciences’ National Research Council report on prevention and treatment of 
missing data and ICH E9 (R1) Addendum. This key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint will be 
analyzed by fitting the same MMRM model desc ribed in the primary anal ysis.
To control the overall experiment- wise t ype I error at 0.05 level, a fixed -sequence testing 
approach will be applied. 
The statistical test will be performed in the following order:
1)Change from baseline to Day 42 in the double- blind treatment period in AISRS total 
score between centanafadine 400 mg TDD and placebo;
2)Change from baseline to Day 42in CGI -S score between centanafadine 400 mg TDD

Confidential -Proprietary Information 82 Version 4.0, 15 Jan 20209 Records Management
9.1 Source Documents
Source documents are defined as the results of original observations and activities of a 
clinical investigation. Source documents will include but are not limited to pr ogress 
notes, electronic data, screening logs, and recorded data from automated instruments. All 
source documents pertaining to this trial will be maintained b y the investigators and made 
available for direct inspection by  authorized persons.
Investigator( s)/institution(s) will permit trial -related monitoring, audits, I RBreview, and 
regulatory  inspection(s) by  providing direct access to source data/documents by  
authorized persons as defined in the eICF. In all cases, subject confidentiality  must be 
maintai ned in accordance with local regulatory  requirements.
9.2 Data Collection
During each subject’s visit to the clinic, a clinician participating in the trial will record 
progress notes to document all significant observations. At a minimum, these notes will 
contain:
Documentation of the informed consent process, including an y revised consents;
Documentation of the investigator’s decision to enroll the subject into the trial, the 
review of all inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to IMP administration, and 
confirmat ion of the subject’s actual participation in the trial;
The date of the visit and the corresponding Visit or Day  in the trial schedule;
General subject status remarks, including an y significant medical findings. The 
severit y, frequency, duration, action taken, and outcome of an y AEs and the 
investigator's assessment of relationship to IMP must also be recorded;
Any changes in concomitant medications or dosages;
A general reference to the procedures completed;
The signature (or initials) and date of each clinician (or designee) who made an entry  
in the progress notes.
In addition, any  contact with the subject via telephone or other means that provides 
significant clinical information will also be documented in the progress notes as 
described above.
Source documents and source data will be captured electronically in this trial, and will 
meet the same fundamental elements of data quality  (eg, attributable, legible, 
contemporaneous, original, and accurate) as paper records. These data will be collected Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

82
Protocol 405 -201-00014
Confidential -Proprietary Information 83 Version 4.0, 15 Jan 2020into a sy stem that is fully validated. Changes to the data will be captured by  an automatic 
audit trail.
The trial site will be given a tablet to directl y record subject data and clinical 
observations on electronic forms. Designated trial site staff will not be g iven access to the 
system until they  have been appropriatel y trained. Information to be originally captured 
and reviewed electronically  shall include details of the subject visit and the protocol 
required assessments performed as a part of these visits, me dical history , AEs, and 
concomitant medications. Because this trial is using an electronic source record as the 
original point of data capture, there is no additional data entry  step for the trial site for 
data collected directl y into the application –rather, the electronic source record directly  
populates the trial database.
Some data may  be captured via paper and then entered into the eSource s ystem. These 
and an y other data treated in this manner will be source data verified b y the trial clinical 
resear ch associate, and the location of the source data (ie, eSource, paper, or a local 
electronic s ystem) will be documented before the trial start. Any  changes to information 
in paper source documents will be initialed and dated on the day  the change is made b y a 
trial site staff member authorized to make the change. Changes will be made by  striking a 
single line through erroneous data (so as not to obliterate the original data), and clearly  
entering the correct data (eg, wrong data right data). If the reason for the change is not 
apparent, a brief explanation for the change will be written in the source documentation 
by the clinician.
Another exception will be safet y laboratory or central ECG data, where the official 
source document ation will be considered the report issued by  the anal yzing laboratory .
Remote monitoring of the original electronic source records will take place, however 
on-site monitoring inspections will continue to take place in order to review data entry  of 
source documentation directly  captured on paper and transcribed into the s ystem, to 
ensure protocol adherence, to assess trial site operational capabilities and to perform 
other monitoring activities that cannot be performed remotely
.
At the end of the trial, the investigator must certify  that the data entered into the eSource 
application are complete and accurate. After database lock, the investigator will receive 
an electronic copy of the subject data.
9.3 File Management at the Trial Site
The investigator will ensure that the trial site file is maintained in accordance with 
Section 8 of the I CH GCP Guideline E626and as required b y applicable local regulations. Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

destruction of these documents.
9.4 Records Retention at the Trial Site
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations require all investigators participating in 
clinical drug trials to maintain detailed clinical data for one of the following perio ds:
A period of at least 2 y ears after the date on which a New Drug Application is 
approved b y the FDA;
A period of 2 years after the sponsor has notified the FDA that investigation with this 
drug is discontinued.
The investigator must not dispose of an y records relevant to this trial without either 
(1)written permission from the sponsor or (2) provision of an opportunity  for the sponsor 
to collect such records. The investigator will be responsible to maintain adequate and 
accurate electronic or hard copy  source documents of all observations and data generated 
during this trial including any  data clarification forms received from the sponsor. Such 
documentation is subject to inspection by  the sponsor and relevant regulatory  authorities. 
If the investigator withdraws from the trial (eg, due to relocation or retirement), all trial -
related records should be transferred to a mutuall y agreed -upon designee within a 
sponsor -
specified timeframe. Notice of such transfer will be given to the sponsor in 
writing.
10 Qualit y Control and Quality  Assurance 
10.1 Monitoring
The sponsor has ethical, legal, and scientific obligations to follow this trial in accordance 
with established research principles, the ICH E6 GCP: Consolidated Guidance, and 
applicable regulatory  requirements and local laws. As part of a concerted effort to fulfill 
these obligations (maintain current personal knowledge of the progress of the trial), the 
sponsor's monitors will visit the site during the trial, as well as communicate frequently  
via telephone, e -mail, and written communications. I n addition, all investigators and 
clinical site personnel will undergo initial and ongoing training for this particular trial, 
and this training will be clearl y documented.
10.2 Auditing
The sponsor's Qualit y Assurance Unit (or r epresentative) may  conduct trial site audits. 
Audits will include, but are not limited to, I MP supply , presence of required documents, Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

investigator agrees to participate wi th audits.
Regulatory  authorities may  inspect the investigator site during or after the trial. The 
investigator will cooperate with such inspections and will contact the sponsor 
immediately  if such an inspection occurs.
11 Ethics and Responsibility
This trial must be conducted in compliance with the protocol, FDA regulations, I CH GCP 
Guideline (E6), international ethical principles derived from the Declaration of Helsinki 
and Council for International Organizations of Medical Science (CIOMS) guidelines, and 
applicable local laws and regulations. Each trial site will seek approval/favorable opinion 
by an IRB according to regional requirements, and the investigator will provide that 
documentation to the sponsor. The IRB will evaluate the ethical, scientific and m edical 
appropriateness of the trial. Further, in preparing and handling the eCRF , the investigator, 
sub-investigator and their staff will take measures to ensure adequate care in protecting 
subject privacy . To this end, a subject number and subject IDcode will be used to 
identify  each subject.
Financial aspects, subject insurance and the publication policy  for the trial will be 
documented in the agreement between the sponsor and the investigator.
12 Confidentiality
All information generated in this trial will be considered confidential and will not be 
disclosed to any one not directly  concerned with the trial without the sponsor’s prior 
written permission. Subject confidentiality requirements of the region(s) where the trial is 
conducted will be met. However, a uthorized regulatory  officials and sponsor personnel 
(or their representatives) may  be allowed full access to inspect and copy  the records, 
consistent with local requirements. All I MPs, subject bodily  fluids, or other materials 
collected shall be used sole ly in accordance with this protocol, unless otherwise agreed to 
in writing b y the sponsor.
Subjects will be identified only  by unique subject numbers in eCRF . If further subject ID
is required, subjects’ full names may  be made known to a regulatory  agency  or other 
authorized officials if necessary , subject to local regulations.
13 Amendment Policy
The investigator will not make an y changes to this protocol without the sponsor’s prior 
written consent and subsequent approval/favorable opinion by  the IRB. Any  permanent Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

Protocol 405 -201-00014
Confidential -Proprietary Information 86 Version 4.0, 15 Jan 2020change to the protocol, whether an overall change or a change for specific trial site(s), 
must be handled as a protocol amendment. An y amendment will be written by the 
sponsor. Each amendment will be submitted to the I RB, as required by  local regula tions. 
Except for “administrative” or “non -substantial” amendments, investigators will wait for 
IRB approval/favorable opinion of the amended protocol before implementing the 
change(s). Administrative amendments are defined as having no effect on the safet y of 
subjects, conduct or management of the trial, trial design, or the quality or safet y of 
IMP(s) used in the trial. A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate 
hazard to subjects should be implemented immediately  after agreement by  thesponsor 
and investigator, followed by  IRB notification within local applicable timelines. The 
sponsor will submit protocol amendments to the applicable regulatory  agencies within 
local applicable timelines.
When the I RB, investigators, or the sponsor conc lude that the protocol amendment 
substantially  alters the trial design or increases the potential risk to the subject, the 
currentl y approved eI CF will require similar modification. In such cases, after 
approval/favorable opinion of the new eICF b y the I RB, repeat written informed consent 
will be obtained from subjects enrolled in the trial before expecting continued 
participation and before the amendment -specified changes in the trial are implemented.

Confidential -Proprietary Information 92 Version 4.0, 15 Jan 2020Appendix 1 Collection, Handling, and Shipment of Bioanalytical Samples
Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection
Blood ( 2mL) will be coll ected for the determination of plasma concentr ations of 
centanafadine (EB-1020) and itsmetabolite(s).
The PKsamples will be collected into 2-mL Vacutainer®tubes containing potassium 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K 2EDTA) . Each tube must be gentl y inverted at least 
8times
. Within 60 minutes of collection, the blood tubes must be centrifuged at 2000 to 
3000 rpm for 10 to 15 minutes at 4°C (± 3°C ). The rpm, time and temperature should 
remain the same throughout the trial. Within 90 minutes of collection, the separated 
plasma from the tube should then be transferred to the bar-code labeled transfer or plasma
tube.
All tubes must be labeled using the labels provided by the sponsor or sponsor designee .If 
information needs to be written on the tube label, then the pen will need to use 
waterproof ink and the label must be covered with transparent tape, or other means, in 
order to prevent damage to the label during freeze/thaw cy cles. An electronic manifest 
must be provided with all sample shipme nts and must be approved b y the sponsor prior to 
sample shipment.
The sample must be stored at −70°C (±10°C). If a −70°C freezer is not available, the PK
samples must be shipped on dry  ice to the central laboratory  on the day  of collection , 
otherwise samples should be shipped on dry  ice within 1 month of collection.
Pharmacogenomic Sample Collection
A 4-mL whole blood sample for the pharmacogenomic determination of drug 
metabolizing enzy mes and transporters will be collected b y venipuncture into one 4-mL 
K2EDTA Vacutainer tube. Each tube should be gently  inverted 10 times to ensure proper 
mixing with the anticoagulant. Refrigerate the whole blood samples at 4 C (±3°C) for at 
least 1 day  (but no longer than 4 day s). Then, the samples should be stored upright at 
−
20C (±10°C) or below. If refrigerating is not possible, samples can be frozen directly  
from ambient. The tube will be shipped on dr y ice to the central laboratory .
Blood Samples for Future Biospecimen Research
Blood ( approximately 10 mL ) will be collected into an evacuated 
collection tube (s). The 
trial site isexpected to follow the instructions for collection, processing, storage, and 
shipment of blood samples. The FBR samples will be shipped to the central laboratory .Clinical Study Report 405-201-00014 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

The specimens will be stored under strict supervision in a limited access facility  which 
operates to ensure the integrity  of the specimens.
Sample Shipment
Plasma samples must be neatly  packed in a Sty rofoam container which should be 
completely  filled with dry
 ice to avoid air spaces that allow evaporation of the dry  ice. 
The Sty rofoam container should be sealed with tape and placed in a cardboard box. The 
recipient of the samples must be alerted of sample shipment. Packages will be shipped 
via an overnight carrier and must not be shipped on Thursday s, Friday s, Saturday s, or an y 
day prior to a holiday  without the expressed consent of the sponsor . The names and 
addresses of the labora tories for shipping purposes will be provided in the Operations

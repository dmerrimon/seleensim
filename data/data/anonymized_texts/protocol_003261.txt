
 
After a 
subject has completed 6
 
months of nivolumab 
(regardless of arm assignment)
, they 
can receive nivolumab every 4 weeks instead of every 2 weeks. 
 
 
The goal of this study is to assess whether 
6 cycles of concurrent 
epigenetic therapy consisting 
of azacitidine and entinostat 
in combination 
with nivolumab can increase response 
compared to 
nivolumab single agent in patients who are immunotherapy naïve
 
(Arm D),
 
or in pati
e
nts whose 
disease has progressed on immunotherapy
 
when 
compared to historical single agent docetaxel
 
(Arms E & F)
.
 
 
 
Primary 
endpoint
 
is the 
response rate by treatment Arm
.  
R
esponse will be assessed from 
first 
dose of trial therapy. 
  
 
 
 
 
Patients experiencing 
significant t
oxicities
 
on Arm D 
during
 
cycle
s
 
1
-
6 of combination therapy
 
of 
azacitidine
, 
entinostat
 
and Nivolumab
 
may proceed to 
Nivolumab
 
only
.
  
Otherwise, p
atients 
who
se disease is
 
responding
,
 
progressing
, or stable
 
on 
combination therapy with Nivolumab, 
azacitadine and entinostat 
will 
proceed to Nivolumab
 
monotherapy after 6 cycles
.
  
Patients 
experiencing significant toxicities 
due to nivolumab 
or documented disease progression (see 
Section 
9
) 
on
 
Arm E or Arm F during cycles 1
-
6 of combination therapy of azacitidine, entinostat 
and Nivolumab must come off study treatment.  Patients whose disease is responding or stable 
on combination therapy with
 
Nivolumab, azacitadine and entinostat will proceed to Nivolumab 
monotherapy after 6 cycles on Arms E and F.

BACKGROUND
 
 
2.1
 
Lung cancer
 
 
Lung cancer is the most common cause of death 
from malignancy in both men and wome
n
1
. 
Most non
-
small cell lung cancer patients present with advanced disease. Metastatic disease 
was
 
typically treated with chemotherapy alone and is considered incurable with 
this 
therapy. 
Recently, immunotherapy has been approved in a variety of ways for the treatment of 
advanced lung cancer; however, many patients who receive this therapy either don’t respond 
or develop resistance. 
Immunotherapy either alone or in combination with chemothe
rapy in 
the front
-
line treatment setting is now dominating the treatment landscape for advanced 
disease.  Fewer and fewer patients are now receiving single agent immunotherapy in the 
second
-
line treatment setting due to the rapidly evolving treatment lands
cape.  
New, effective

therapies and strategies for lung cancer are a critical need
 
in the immunotherapy era
 
particularly after disease progression on first

line immunotherapy containing treatment
.

Agents used
 
 
2.2
.1
 
Azacitidine
 
 
DNA methyltransferase inhibitors have been under investigation for over 25 years.  
The most widely used DNA methyltransferase inhibitor is azacitidine
 
2
.
 
Azacitidine
 
is a 
cytidine analogue that functions as a mechanism
-
dependent suicide inhibitor of 
the 
DNA methyltransferase DNMT1
.  DNA methyltransferases recognize azacitidine as 
a 
natural cytosine. However, the azacitidine pr
events the completion of the methylation 
reaction
, leading to trapping and degradation of the
 
DNMT1 enzyme 
3
. 
Azacitidine
 
is 
approved by the
 
US 
Food
 
and Drug Administration for the treatment of myelodysplastic 
syndrome
4
.  
 
 
 
2.2

Entinostat
 
 
Histone dea
cetylases (HDACs), like DNA methyltransferases, are important negative 
regulators 
of gene expression
5
-

. 
Several
 
HDAC
 
inhibitors 
are in active clinical 
development, including entinostat. 
In a
 
phase I clinical trial 
of
 
entinostat in 
31 patients 
with 
advanced solid tumors

side effects included hematologic and 
gastrointestinal toxicities.
 
 
2.2.3
 
Nivolumab
 
 
Nivolumab (
BMS
-
936558 (MDX
-
1106)
)
 
is a fully human IgG4:

 
monoclonal antibody 
that 
blocks

.  P

or nontransformed cells in the tumor microenvironment 
can bind to PD
-
1 on the surface of 
CD4 hel
per and CD8 
cyto
toxic
 
T cells, suppressing 
anti
-
tumor cytolytic responses
9
.  
P
hase I testing of 
Nivolumab
 
has been 
associated 
with
 
objective responses
 
in multiple 
solid tumors 
including 
non
-
small cell 
lung cancer

generally 
well tolerated, with 
a grade 3

in

4
%
 
of patients
 
treated biweekly
.
 
Based on two Phase III trials showing improved overall survival when 
compared to single agent chemotherapy, Nivolumab has been FDA approved in the 
second line treatment setting
 
of me
tastatic squamous and non

squamous NSCLC 
patients
18,19

Azacitidine
 
and

non

hypothesis
 
 
We have completed 
a
 
combination study of azacitidine and entinostat in patients with 
extensively pretreated 
metastatic lung cancer
13
.
 
This study defined a regimen of

azacit
i
dine 40 mg/m

days 1
-
6 and 8
-
10 and entinostat
 
7 mg PO on days 3 and 10 on 
a 28
-
day schedule as safe and well
-
tolerated. 
Major objective responses were 
observed in 2 patients. 
 
 
 
Mo
re surprising 
than the responses 
observed
 
was that several patients 
treated on this protocol experienced 
major objective 
responses to the 
subsequent
 
line of therapy, despite 
being heavily pretreated.  
Of 28 patients 
who received a subsequent line of 
therapy, the response rate was 29%, 
higher than for any agent for recurrent 
lung cancer (reported response rates to 
erlotinib, 
docetaxel, or pemetrexed are 
approximately 9%). Although the extent 
of data are limited, m
ost notable of all 
has been the response to subsequent 
immunotherapy targeting the PD
-
1/PD
-
L1 pathway.  Of f
ive
 
patients with 
progressive lung cancer after multiple 
p
rior therapies who were treated with 
azacitidine and entinostat, and who 
received 
Nivolumab
 
or 
a similarly 
targeted 
anti
-
PD
-
L1 antibody
(BMS
-
936559)
 
as the 
immediate subsequent therapy, 
t
hree
 
have experienced major
 
objective responses, 
a
 
fourth
 
has had disease stabilization
 
beyond 6 months after initiation of
 
Nivolumab
, and 
the fifth has stable disease beyond 6 months but required palliative radiation to a mass 
eroding into the chest wall from the right lung.  Of the 5 patients, two had prior radiation 
with concurrent chemotherapy followed by one platinum doublet, 
o
ne h
ad one prior 
platinum doublet, and 
one had two prior th
erapies for metastatic disease.  The last 
patient had 4 prior therapies as well as radiation. 
 
These responses and stable disease 
at 24 weeks compare favorably to the 18% NSCLC response rate and a 7% s
table 
disease rate at 24 weeks
 
reported in the multi
-
dose Phase I trial of Nivolumab and 
10% NSCLC response rate and 12% stable disease rate at 24 weeks reported in the 
multi
-
dose Phase I trial of BMS
-
936559
14
,
15
.
 
 
T
hese responses have been quite impressive, and are ongoing; one example is shown 
in the f
igure 
to the
 
right
.  
Only one
 
of th
e 5
 
patients 
was
 
a 
responder
 
to epigenetic 
therapy, and in fact 3 progressed at the very first time
 
point assessed.  Such major 
objective responses in rapidly progressing 
non
-
small cell 
lung cancer after multiple 
prior therapies are rarely observed.

epigenetic silencing can be reversed, using DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (suc
h as 
azacitidine) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (such as entinostat).  Our group has 
led efforts to define the biology and therapeutic implications of epigenetic gene 
silencing in cancer, including demonstration of synergistic re
-
expression of silence
d 
tumor suppressor genes using these classes of drugs 
16
,
17
.
 
 
Beyond cell
-
autonomous effects, a
 
combination of published and unpublished data 
offers three 
non
-
mutually exclusive mechanisms by which epigenetic modulation of 
tumors can enhance anti
-
tumor immunity. First, epigenetic modulation induces a vast 
array of new antigens b
y the tumor
s
 
that 
are
 
potential targets for T cell and antibody 
responses. Second, 
re
-
expression
 
is induced
 
at silenced
 
promoters of key cytokine 
genes in T cells, such as interferon
-
gamma and IL
-
2 
–
 
critical effector cytokines in anti
-
tumor responses. Thi
rd, global demethylation of DNA in tumor cells induces a 
“pathogen response” pattern of gene expression, characterized in part by a type I 
interferon response.
  
Specifically, 
i
n cultured NSCLC 
and other human 
cells, low doses 
of the DNA 
demethylating agent 5
-
azacitidine (5
-
Aza
-
CR) up
-
regulated pro
-
inflammatory, viral defense, and tumor antigen presentation pathways while increasing

Thus, combining epigenetic therapy with immune

The very latest pre
-
clinical data from our group
, 
in mouse model studies of NSCLC 
and serous ovarian cancer
, identify
 
that the epigenetic therapy agents  generate anti
-
tumor responses and these, importantly are associated with immune cell infiltration, 
and notably acti
vated CD8 T
-
cells into tumors
20, 21
.  This is all associated, as outlined 
in the correlative science sec
tion, with an upregulation of ERV transcripts and the viral 
defense gene stimulation of Type 1 interferon signaling including for levels of the 
immune inhibitory ligand, PD
-
L1. These drug effects also contribute to, in tumor 
associated CD8 T
-
cells, reversi
on of a transcriptional
 
profile for immune exhaustion
20
. 
All of these epigenetic therapy effects will predictably sensitize tumors for response to  
antibodies 
that block the PD
-
1 inhibitory pathway 
and
 
unleash the anti
-
tumor immune 
response. Therefore, a s
cientific rationale underpins the combination proposed herein.

Rationale for

.1
 
Clinical Rationale for combination epigenetic and immunotherapies
 
Due to 2015 FDA
-
approval of nivolumab in the 2nd line treatment setting of advanced or 
 
metastatic NSCLC
22,23
, this protoco
l 
was previously
 
amended to update 
nivolumab
 
 
administration 
to be
 
given
 
concurrently 
start
ing
 
at the initiation of 
combination 
study
 
 
treatment. Therefore, for those patients randomized to combination therapy, nivolumab 
 
will be given in combination with epigenetic therapy for 6 cycles, followed by nivolumab 
 
monotherapy
 
until disease
 
progression
. This will provide patients treated with 
maximal 
 
exposure to both 
epigenetic therapy 
and
 
the immune checkpoint inhibitor, in keeping 
 
with standard of care practice.  
In this manner, p
atients will have longer exposure to the

potential benefits of both e
pigenetic therapy and immune checkpoint inhibition. This 
 
update in therapy is further supported by data indicating that 58.3% (14/24) patients 
 
were unable to receive two months of epigenetic therapy alone ("priming") prior to 
 
initiation of nivolumab in 
an earlier therapeutic intervention in this trial (Arm A), due to 
 
both symptoms (nausea, vomiting, fatigue, pain) and subsequent rapid disease 
 
progression
 
on epigenetic therapy alone
.
 
 
Importantly, the concurrent administration of epigenetic therapy and 
immune checkpoint 
 
inhibition is hypothesized to quickly combine the immune attraction signals from 
 
epigenetic therapy with the initial immune
-
tolerance inhibiting activity of immune 
 
checkpoint blockade, and allow the patient's tumor to be exposed to thi
s interaction for a 
 
longer and perhaps more significant length of time than in the previous treatment arm. 
 
This is supported by pre
-
clinical data for the combination of these 
agents’ 
mechanisms 
 
of action on efficacy and 
overall tolerability as detailed 
below
.
 
 
 
2.4
.2
 
Biological rationale
 
The question of whether epigenetic therapy may be able to increase the efficacy of 
 
immune checkpoint therapy by priming or sensitizing patients remains an area of active 
 
clinical and pre
-
clinical investigation
 
across a variety of tumor types
. The early clinical 
 
data for the value of an epigenetic priming paradigm
 
(combination epigeneti
c therapy 
 
followed by immune checkpoint inhibition monotherapy)
, and which guided the initial 
 
design of this trial 
for advanced NSCLC, suggested priming could be operative 
–
 
and it 
 
may be. However, for those patients with advanced NSCLC treated on the o
riginal 
 
epigenetic priming arm of this study, it is clear that any long priming phase will not be 
 
clinically tolerated by the majority of patients with advanced NSCLC because of the 
 
aggressiveness of the disease, and dictates a need to 
move
 
the epigenetic therapy 
 
concurrent with immune checkpoint therapy. We have found success in treating
 
 
aggressive malignant
 
mouse models concurrently with epigenetic therapy and 
 
checkpoint inhibitors
 
at the initiation of therapy.
 
 
 
Pre
-
clinical data from t
he Baylin and Zahnow laboratories at JHH, summarized below, 
 
shows that this is a potentially relevant area of clinical therapy across multiple tumor 
 
types and is 
an area of ongoing active investigation
.  To date, numerous mouse models 
 
in 
their 
laborator
ies have been treated with concurrent Azac
i
tidine and checkpoint 
 
inhibitors with
out
 
significant adverse events
 
being noted
. On the contrary, overall 
 
survival was 
optimized
 
when using combination therapy consisting of epigenetic agents 
 
and immune checkpo
int inhibitors.

across numerous animal models that

observed in mice receiving epigeneti

giving the anti

this novel combinatorial approach 
 
may
 
be able to slow rapid tumor progression and thus give the epigenetic therapy more 
 
time to effectively incre

to immune 
 
checkpoint inhibition
. This concurrent

also affords the ability to 
 
expose the tumor to epigenetic therapy for a longer period of time

as well

24
. Also, due to recent results of 
 
 
 
 
 
KEYNOTE189, 
as well as previous results of 
KEYNOTE021 cohort G, the combination 
 
 
 
of pembrolizumab with carboplatin and pemetrexed chemotherapies is now considered 
 
 
 
standard of care for first line treatment of advanced or metastatic non
-
squamous NSCLC 
 
 
patients with good performance status, regardless of PD
-
L1 status
25,26
. While the 
 
 
 
 
response rates and overall survival are significantly better than chemotherapy alone, the 
 
 
 
majority of patients will either not respond or eventually develop PD
-
1 resistance. 
 
 
 
Therefore, further evaluation for therapeutic options that will reignite
 
the ability for 
 
 
 
PD
-
1 to initiate a robust 
anti
-
tumor 
immune response are needed.   
This is especially 
 
 
 
true in KRAS mutated NSCLC, as many have co

g

Recent data 
was 
released from Syndax regarding the ENCORE 601 trial, whose NSCLC 
 
 
 
patient cohort that enrolled patients with disease progression on or after anti

therapy
. The company reported that they had met their
 
pre

objective response 
 
 
 
 
threshold to advance into the second stage of the Phase 2 trial
2

. This tr

combination of entinostat plus pembrolizumab in two NSCLC patient cohorts: those who 
 
 
 
 
had 
previously
 
progressed on PD
1/L1 therapy, and those patients that are anti

PD

1/L1 
 
 
 
 
 
 
naïve. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Although trial data is not yet publishe
d, Mirati’s class I HDACi mocetinostat has been 
 
 
 
 
combined with the anti

PD

in advanced renal cell carcinoma

hypermethylation of CXCL9/10, important tumor microenvironment chemoattractants for

r
efractory or resistant
 
disease
 
 
 
The application of epigenetic therapy to PD
-
1 refractory or resistant disease represents 
 
 
 
an emerging area of inquiry with some preclinical data indicating efficac
y
. A recent 
 
 
 
publication by Youngblood and colleagues suggests that CD8 tumor infiltrating 
 
 
 
 
lymphocytes can become PD
-
1 refractory in the presence of continuous antigen 
 
 
 
 
exposure through the development of a fully exhausted population
31
. Therapeutic 
 
 
 
interventi
on with a demethylating agent prevented the
 
emergence of this fully exhausted 
 
 
 
CD8 T cell population and thus enabled response to
 
PD
-
1 in the Tramp
-
C2 murine 
 
 
 
model, which is endogenously refractory to
 
immunotherapy. Additionally, a study by 
 
 
 
Baylin 
and colleagues
 
demonstrated that combination epigenetic therapy 
 
 
 
 
 
(DNMTi+HDACi) can alter the CD8 T cell transcriptome, skewing from an exhausted to 
 
 
 
an effector/memory like population in a Kras driven murine NSCLC model
20
. These

studies suggest th
at epigenetic therapy can both modulate the T cell exhausted state 
 
 
 
and drive responses to immunotherapy in the setting of PD

Entinostat 
 
 
 
Entinostat is an oral agent. Entinostat should be taken 
on an empty stomach (fasting) 
either at least 1 hour prior to a meal or at least 2 hours after 
a meal. The tablets should 
be taken one at a time. 
The tablets should not be split, crushed or chewed.  
Entinostat 
is known to cause nausea and vomiting. To redu
ce the incidence of nausea and 
vomiting associated with entinostat administration, patients will be instructed to take a 
5
-
HT3 antagonist orally or IV 30
-
60 minutes prior to taking the dose of entinostat.

Azacitidine
 
 
 
Azacitidine 
is supplied as 100 mg of white, lyophilized powder with 100 mg of mannitol, 
USP in 30 ml flint vials. The contents of each vial should be dissolved in 4mL of sterile 
water or 0.9% sodium chloride to provide a 25 mg/ml slurry. 
 
A
zacitidine
 
does not go 
into 
solution but forms a loose slurry when reconstituted in this fashion. Reconstituted 
solutions of 
azacitidine
 
are unstable. Upon reconstitution, the material should be 
injected within 60 minutes. The slurry should be injected subcutaneously. The slurry 
SHOU
LD NOT be injected intravenously. Doses may be split into multiple injection 
sites if volume to be administered is too large. Injection sites should be rotated on a 
daily basis.

Management of 
Nivolumab
-
related infusion reactions
 
 
Since 
Nivolumab
 
contains only human immunogl
obulin protein sequences, 
i
t 
has a low 
incidence of
 
infusion or hyper
sensitivity reactions. However, 
if such a reaction were to occur, 
it might manifest with fever, chills,
 
rigors, headache, rash, pruritus, arth
r
algias, 
hypotension, 
hypertension, bronc
hospasm, or other allergic
-
like 
reactions. All Grade 3 or 4 infusion 
reac
tions 
must
 
be 
reported 
as an SAE if it meets t
he criteria. Infusion reactions 
must 
be 
graded according to NCI CTCAE (Version 4.0) guidelines.
 
 
Treatment recommendations are provided below:
 
 
For Grade 1 symptoms: (Mild reaction; infusion interruption not in
dicated; intervention not 
indicated).
 
 
•
 
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. The following 
prophylactic premedications
 
are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 
mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg at least 30 minutes 
before additional 
Nivolumab
 
administrations.
 
 
For Grade 2 symptoms: (Moderate reaction requires therapy or infu
sion interruption but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihistamines, non
-
steroidal anti
-
inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, IV fluids]; prophylactic medications indicated 
for 
≤ 
24 hours).
 
 
• 
 
Stop the 
Nivolumab
 
infusion, begin an IV infusion 
of normal saline, and treat the 
subject 
with diphenhydramine 
50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or 
acetaminophen
/paracetamol
 
325 
to 1000 mg; remain
 
at bedside and monitor subject 
until resolution of symptoms. 
Corticosteroid ther
apy
 
may also be administered as 
appropriate. If the infusion is 
interrupted, then res
tart the infusion at 50% of the 
original infusion rate when symptoms 
resolve; if no further complications ensue after
 
30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 
100% of the 
ori
ginal infusion rate. Monitor 
subject closely. If symptoms recur, then no 
further 
Nivolumab
 
will be administered 
at that visit.
 
•
 
For future infusions, the following prophylactic premedications are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or a
ce
taminophen 325 to 1000 mg 
should be 
administered at least 30 minutes 
before 
Nivolumab
 
infusions. If 
necessary, corticosteroids 
(up to 25 mg of SoluCortef or equivalent) may be used.
 
 
For Grade 3 or 4 symptoms: (Severe reaction, Grad
e 3: prolonged [ie
, not rapidly 
responsive 
to symptomatic medication and/or b
rief interruption of infusion]; recurrence 
of symptoms 
following initial improvement
; hospitalization indicated for 
other clinical sequelae [eg, renal 
impairment, pulmonary infiltra
tes]. Grade 4: L
ife
-
threatening; 
pressor or ventilatory support 
indicated).
 
 
•
 
Immediately discontinue infusion of
 
Nivolumab
.
 
Begin an IV infusion of normal 
saline
 
and treat the subject as follows: Recommend b
ronchodilators, epinephrine 0.2 
to 1 mg of 
a 1:1000 
solution for subcutaneous admini
stration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 
1:10,000 solution

injected slowly for IV adminis
tration, and/or diphenhydramine 
50 mg IV with 
methylprednisolone 100 mg IV or 
equivalent), as needed. Subject 
must
 
be monitored until 
the Invest
igator is comfort
able that the symptoms will not 
recur. 
Nivolumab
 
will be 
permanently discontinu
ed. Investigators 
must
 
follow 
their institutional guidelines for the 
treatment of ana
phylaxis. Remain at bedside and 
monitor subject until recovery of the 
sympt
oms.
 
 
In case of late
-
occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (e
g, appearance of a localized or 
generalized pruritus within 1 week after treatment), sym
ptomatic treatment may be given 
(eg, 
oral antihistamine or corticosteroids).

continued treatment with nivolumab.
 
 
If the investigator feels that the 
patient receiving 
nivolumab 
monotherapy 
continues to 
achieve clinical benefit by continuing treatment, the subject 
may 
remai
n on the 
trial
 
and 
continue
 
to receive monitoring
 
according to the Study calendar. 
 
 
New lesions are considered measurable at the time of initial progression if the longest 
diameter is at least 10mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a 
shor

axis of at least 15 mm).  Any
 
new lesion considered non
-
measurable
 
at the time of initial 
progression may become measurable and therefore included in the tumor burden volume 
if the longest diameter increases to at least 10 mm (except for pathological
 
lymph nodes 
which must have a short axis of at least 15 mm).

Duration of Follow Up
 
 
Once treatment has been discontinued, patients will be 
followed with phone calls every 3 
months until death
 
or 
for 
5 years
, whichever occurs first. We will collect data on development 
of additional cancers, subsequent therapy (chemotherapy, radiation or surgery) for their 
cancer, and survival. Medical records 
including laboratory, pathology, operative, and radiology 
reports will be obtained at the discretion of the principal investigator with permission from the

Criteria for Removal from Study
 
Treatment
 
 
A patient will be withdrawn from the study
 
treatment
 
if any of the following events occur while 
on therapy: 
 

 
Interruption of scheduled therapy for greater than 
6
 
weeks
 
except as noted above in 
section 4.4
.
 

 
Intolerable adverse effects
, laboratory abnormality or intercurrent
 
illness
 
that 
is
 
judged by 
the investigator to be either physically or psychologically detrimental to the patient. 
 

 
Pregnancy. 
 

 
Patient non
-
compliance. 
 

 
Unresolved or recurrent Grade 3 or
 
4 toxicities
 
except as noted above in section 4.4
. 
 

 
Treatment with other 
anti
-
cancer
 
drugs. 
 

 
Confirmed d
isease progression
 
on 
therapy as outlined in Section 4.4 and Section 4.4.1
.
 

 
Withdrawal of informed consent (subject’s decision to withdraw for any reason)
. 
 

 
Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or 
involuntary incarceration 
for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious disease) illness.
 

 
All subjects who discontinue
 
study 
treatment 
should
 
comply with protocol specified follow
-
up and survival 
procedures as outlined in Section 
4.5
.
  
The ONLY exception to this 
requirement is when a 
subject withdraws consent
 
for all study procedures 
or loses the 
ability to consent freely
 
(i.e., is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the tre
atment
 
of either a p
sychiatric or physical illness)
; 
in this case they will be deemed off study and 
no further follow up will be performed.

DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS
 
 
Dosing delays and dose modifications on this study will be made at the discretion of the treating 
physician.  
No dose modifications will be allowed for nivolumab.  
Advers
e symptoms prompting 
dose delay
 
of greater than 
6
 
weeks in any phase of the study will
 
result in study discontinuation
 
except as noted in section 4.4
.

Dose Modifications/Treatment Delays for A
zaci
tidine
 
and
 
Entinostat Only
 
 
In order to maintain dose 
–
intensity and cumulative dose
-
delivery on this study, reasonable 
efforts will be made to minimize dose reduction and treatment delays as specified below. In 
case of toxicity, appropriate medical treatment should be used (includin
g anti
-
emetics for 
nausea/vomiting, etc.) No dose escalation is planned for this study. For any event which is 
apparent at baseline, the dose modifications will apply according to the corresponding shift 
in toxicity grade, if the investigator feels it is a
ppropriate. (e.g. if a patient has a grade 1 
asthenia at baseline which increases to grade 2 during treatment, this will be considered as 
a shift of 1 grade and treated as a grade 1 toxicity for dose modification purposes). Where 
several toxicities with di
fferent grades or severity occur at the same time, the dose 
modifications applied should be the greatest reduction applicable. 
 
 
Treatment will be modified based on treatment
-
related toxicity as described below for all 
patients receiving 
azacitidine
 
and 
entinostat
 
on Arm D
, Arm E and Arm F

Adverse Event Reporting
 
 
The principal investigator will notify the appropriate regulatory agencies of any serious 
adverse event due to any cause during the course of this investigation. These include the 
Johns Hopkins Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee, and the Jo
hns Hopkins 
Medical Institutional Review Board (JHM
-
IRB) of The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions. The 
required reporting time period is 3 days for fatal events, and 10 days for all other events. 
 
 
Adverse event information will be collected for the durat
ion of the study. Patients will be 
instructed to notify investigators of any symptoms, and investigators will assess patients for 
adverse events at each visit. All toxicity and adverse events will be recorded on Case Report 
Forms, graded as to the severity
 
and relationship to the study drug, and reported within the 
required time frame.

or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of 
the trial. 
 
 
6.6.3
 
Case Report Forms 
 
 
The study case report forms (CRFs) are the primary data collection instrument for the 
study. All data requested on the CRF will be recorded for each subject. If a procedure 
was not done or a question was not asked, this will be recorded as “N/D”. If the it
em 
is not applicable to the individual case, this will be recorded as “N/A”. 
CRFs will be 
built electronically in CRMS.  All data will be entered electronically onto the electronic 
CRF through CRMS by the Study Coordinator and/ or Data Manager from each si
te.
 
RedCap will be used for Data Analysis purposes by the Johns Hopkins Biostats team, 
but it will not contain CRFs.


 
Classification: Antineoplastic; entinostat is an inhibitor of histone deacetylase 
 
7
.2.2 
 
How Supplied: entinostat is supplied by 
Syndax
 
as 
a 
1 mg (
pink to light red, in bottles 
of 40
), or 5 mg (yellow, in bottles of 40) film
-
coated tablets 
(round
-
biconvex). Each 
tablet also contains mannitol, sodium starch glycolate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, 
potassium bicarbonate, and magnesium stearate
.  The film coating consists of 
hypromellose, tal
c
, titanium dioxide and ferric oxide pgments (red and yell
ow) as 
colorants.
 
 
7
.2.3 
 
Mechanism of Action: entinostat is a 
histone deacetylases (HDACs) which is a family 
of enzymes that regulates chromating
 
remodeling and gene transcription via the 
dynamic process of acetylation and deacetylation of core histones.  Entinostat inhibits 
histone deacetylases, changes chromatin configuration, and induces differentiation 
and apoptosis of cancer cells through an e
pigenetic mechanism.  
Among the genes 
whose expression is induced by entinostat is p21WAF
-
1/CIP
-
1, independent of p53 
activity. The induction of p21, in turn, is thought to be responsible for the cell cycle 
arrest (at least in part through reduction of ret
inoblastoma protein phosphorylation) 
and antiproliferative activities of entinostat seen in multiple malignant cell types. In 
addition to its ability to bypass p53
-
dependent pathways, entinostat also appears to 
be independent of the presence and magnitude 
of multidrug resistance
–
1 (MDR) 
gene/protein expression. 
 
7
.2.4
 
 
Route of Administration: Oral. Entinostat should be taken 
fasting either at least 1 hour 
prior to or at least 2 hours 
after 
a
 
meal
.
 
If the patient’s dose requires more than one 
tablet, the ta
blets should be taken one at a time.
  
Entinostat tablets should not be split, 
crushed or chewed.
 
 
7
.2.5 
 
Storage and Stability: Store the bottles at room temperature (15
-
25
°C)
 
and protect 
from light.  Entinostat is not to be exposed to extremes of temperat
ure (greater than 
30ºC or less than 5ºC)
. 
 
Shelf life stability studies of the intact bottles are on
-
going. 
 
7
.2.6 
 
Potential Drug Interactions: Studies examining interactions between entinostat
 
and 
other agents have not been conducted.

can be infused
 
undiluted (10 mg/mL) or 
diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 5% dextrose injection to
 
protein 
concentrations as low as 0.35 mg/mL. When the dose is fixed (eg, 240 mg, 360 mg, 
or
 
480 mg flat dose), nivolumab injection can be infused
 
undiluted or diluted so as 
not to exceed a
 
total infusion volume of 160 mL. For patients weighing less than 40 
kg, the total volume of
 
infusion must not exceed 4 mL per kg of patient weight.

MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT

.1
 
 
Antitumor Effect 
–
 
Solid Tumors
 
 
On
 
this study, 
planned radiologic evaluations will be
 
performed 
at baseline
 
(within 4 weeks 
prior to starting study therapy)
 
and then every 8 weeks
.
  
For all Arms, c
onfirmatory scans 
should be obtained 
not less than 4
 
weeks following initial docu
mentation of objective 
response, and will typically be obtained at the time of the next planned evaluation (i.e. 
8
 
weeks 
following).
 
 
 
Response and progression will be 
evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline 
(version 1.1) [
Eur J Ca
 
45:228
-
247, 2009], 
Changes in the 
longest
 
diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of 
the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph 
nodes are used in the RECIST
v1.1
 
criteria.
 
RECIST readers will be blinded to the treatm
ent 
assignment of all subjects
. 
 
 
Accumulating evidence indicates that the emergence of object
ive responses to
 
agents that 
activate anti
-
tumor immune responses 
may 
follow delayed kinetics of weeks
 
or months, and 
can be preceded by initial apparent radiological progression, or the appearance of new lesions 
or some enlarging lesion
s 
while certain tar
get lesions are regressing (“mixed response”). It is 
thus reasonable, in
 
the absence of clinical deterioration, to continue to treat these subjects 
until radiologic
 
progression is 
both 
confirmed 
and 
found to have worsened at a subsequent 
imaging
 
evaluation. Evidence of PD will be based on a comparison with baseline (or nadir)
 
scans, in which there is either an increase of 20% or more in the sum of the longest
 
diameters 
(SLD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest
 
dia
meters (nadir) 
recorded since 
starting nivolumab treatment
, and/or unequivocal progression of
 
non
-
target 
lesions, with or without the development of 1 or more new lesions
. 
 
PD should be confirmed 
by repeat scans at the next
 
scheduled imaging evaluation 
8
 
w
eeks later (but no sooner than 
4 weeks).
 
 
Subjects with PD should be managed in the study as 
per Section 4.4.1.

Evaluable for objective response.
  
Response to azacitidine/entinostat
 
and to
 
Nivolumab
, will be assessed separately.  For each, o
nly those patients who have 
measurable disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, 
and have had their disease re
-
evaluated will be considered evaluable for response.  
These patients will have their response classified accordin
g to the definitions stated 
below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of 
the first cycle of either therapy
 
will also be considered evaluable.)
 
 
Evaluable Non
-
Target Disease Response
.  Patients who have lesions pres
ent at 
baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, 
have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re
-
evaluated 
will be considered evaluable for non
-
target disease.  The response assessment is 
based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions. 
 
 
9
.1.2
 
      
Disease Parameters
 
 
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the 
overall tumor burden at baseline and use this as a 
comparator for subsequent 
measurements.  Measurable disease is defined by the presence of at least one 
measurable lesion.
 
 
Measurable disease
.  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diame
ter to be recorded) as 
>
20 mm by chest x
-
ray
 
or
 
as 
>
10 mm with CT scan, 
MRI, 
or calipers by clinical 
exam.  All tumor measurements must be recorded in 
millimeters
 
(or decimal fractions 
of centimeters).
 
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previousl
y irradiated area 
are
 
not 
considered measurable
 
unless there has been demonstrated progression in the 
lesion
.
 
 
Malignant lymph nodes.
  
To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, 
a lymph node must be 
>
15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan 
slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in 
follow
-
up, only the short axis will be measu
red and followed.
 
 
Non
-
measurable disease
.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with 
≥
10 to <15 mm 
short axis), are considered non
-
measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomen
ingeal 
disease, ascites, pleural/per
icardial effusions, lymphangitic involvement of the skin or 
lung
, inflammatory breas
t disease, and abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly 
(not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non
-
measurable.
 
 
Note:  Cystic les
ions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non
-
measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts.

:
 
August 9, 2022

‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastase
s can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. 
However, if non
-
cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions.
 
 
Target lesions.
  
All measurable l
esions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 
5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as 
target 
lesions
 
and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected 
on the basis of their size (lesion
s with the longest diameter), be representative of all 
involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible 
repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion 
does not lend itself to reproducib
le measurement in which circumstance the next 
largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the 
diameters (longest for non
-
nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported
 
as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph 
nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  
The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any 
objective tumor regression in the measurable di
mension of the disease.
 
 
Non
-
target lesions
.  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as 
non
-
target 
lesions 
and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of 
these lesions 
are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal 
progression of each should be noted throughout follow
-
up. 
 
 
9
.1.3
 
      
Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease
 
 
All measurements should be taken and 
recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment.
 
 
The same method of assessment and 
the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow
-
up. 
Imaging
-
based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless 
the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are
 
assessable by clinical exam.
 
 
Clinical lesions
  
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (
e.g.
, skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 

10 mm diameter as 
assessed using calipers (
e.g.
, skin nodules).  In the case o
f skin lesions, 
documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the 
lesion, is recommended. 
 
 
 
Chest x
-
ray
  
Lesions on chest x
-
ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they 
are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lu
ng.  However, CT is preferable. 
 
 
Conventional CT and MRI
  
This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
 
 
Protocol Version
 
15

40
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  If CT scans 
have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size
 
for a measurable lesion 
should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (
e.g.
 
for body scans).  
 
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and 
temporal resolution; however, there are many
 
image acquisition variables involved in 
MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement.  
Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is 
performed, the technical specifications of the scan
ning sequences used should be 
optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with 
CT, the modality used at follow
-
up should be the same as was used at baseline and 
the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse se
quence.  It is beyond 
the scope of the RECIST
v1.1
 
guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence 
parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of 
scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be foll
owed as 
closely as possible to prior scans.  Body
 
scans should be performed with breath
-
hold 
scanning techniques, if possible.
 
 
PET
-
CT
  
At
 
present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET
-
CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
v1.1 
measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of 
a PET
-
CT is of identi
cal diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral 
contrast), then the CT portion of the PET
-
CT can be used for RECIST 
v1.1 
measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately 
measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, 
however, that the PET portion of the CT 
introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or 
serially performed.  
 
 
Ultrasound
  
Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be 
used as a method of measu
rement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced 
in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator 
dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will 
be taken from one assessment to t
he next.  If new lesions are identified by 
ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised.  If there 
is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in 
selected instances.
 
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy
  
The u
tilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm 
complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse 
in trials where recurrence following complete
 
response (CR) or surgical resection is 
an endpoint.
 
 
Tumor markers
  
Tumor
 
markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient 
to be considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA
-
125 
response (in recurrent ovarian 
cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate

Intergroup has developed CA

a which are to be integrated with 
objective tumor assessment for use in first
-
line trials in ovarian cancer [
JNCI
 
92:1534
-
1535, 2000].
 
 
Cytology, Histology
  
These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses
 
(CR) in rare cases (
e.g.
, residual lesions in 
tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can 
remain).
 
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the m
easurable tumor has met criteria for response 
or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease 
(an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.
 
 
FDG
-
PET
  
While FDG
-
PET response assessments 
relat
ed to NSCLC management 
and to immunotherapy 
need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable to 
incorporate the use of FDG
-
PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of 
tumor 
progression (particularly possible 'new' disease)
 
or regression 
(evalu
ation of potential CR)
.  
Lesions can be assessed on FDG
-
PET imaging 
according to the following algorithm: 
 
Negative FDG
-
PET at baseline, with a positive FDG
-
PET at follow
-
up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion.
 
No FDG
-
PET at baseline and a positive FDG
-
P
ET at follow
-
up:  If the positive FDG
-
PET at follow
-
up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD.  If 
the positive FDG
-
PET at follow
-
up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow
-
up CT  scans are needed to det
ermine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal 
FDG
-
PET scan).  If the positive FDG
-
PET at follow
-
up corresponds to a pre
-
existing 
site of disease on CT that is not progressing on 
the basis of the anatomic images, 
this is not PD.
 
FDG
-
PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent 
fibrosis or scarring.  However, it must be acknow
ledged that both approaches may 
lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG
-
PET and biopsy 
resolution/sensitivity.
 
 
 
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG
-
PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an 
uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissu
e on the attenuation corrected 
image.

Complete Response (CR)
:
 
Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any 
pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non

target) must have reduction in 
short 
axis to <10 mm.
 
 
Partial Response (PR)
:  
 
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
 
 
Progressive Disease (PD)
:
 
At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters 
of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  
the appear
ance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).
 
 
Stable Disease (SD)
:
 
Neither sufficient 
shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.
 
 
Special notes 
on the assessment of target lesions:
 
Lymph nodes
:  Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the 
actual short axis measurement recorded and should be measured in the same 
anatomical plane as the baseline examination, even if the nodes reg
ress to below 
10mm on study.  This means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, 
the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if com
plete response criteria are met, 
since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10 mm.
 
Target l
esions that become ‘too small to measure’:  
All lesions (nodal and non

nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each 
subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2mm).  If the radiologist is able to 
provide an actua
l measure, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5mm.  When 
such a lesion becomes difficult to assign an exact measurement, it is recommended 
to:  If it is in the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the 
measurement sho
uld be recorded as 0 mm.  If the lesion is believed to be present 
and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be 
assigned (note: in case of a lymph node believed to be present and faintly seen but 
too small to measure, a de
fault value of 5 mm should be assigned in this 
circumstance as well).  This default value is derived from the 5 mm CT slice 
thickness (but should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness).
 
Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment:
  
When non
-
nodal 
lesions ‘fragment’, 
the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to 
calculate the 
target
 
lesion sum.  Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between 
them may be maintained that would aid in 
obtaining
 
maximal diameter 
measurements
 
of each individual lesion.  If the lesions have coalesced such that 
they are no longer separable, the 
vector of the longest diameter in this instance 
should be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.

Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or

of existing non

Unequivocal progression
 
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall 
disease status change, not a single l
esion increase.    
 
 
Although a clear progression of “non
-
target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion 
of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (o
r Principal 
Investigator).
  
When the patient also has measurable disease:  
To achieve 
‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non

target disease, there must be an 
overall level of substantial worsening in non
-
target disease such that, even in 
presenc
e of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased 
sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest ‘increase’ in size of one or 
more non

target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression 
status

When the patients has only non

To achieve 
‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non
-
target disease, there must be an 
overall level of substantial worsening such that the overall tumor burden has 
increased sufficiently to mer
it discontinuation of therapy.  A modest ‘increase’ in the 
size of one or more non
-
target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for 
unequivocal progression status.  Because worsening in non
-
target disease cannot be 
easily quantified (by definition: 
if all lesions are non
-
measurable) a useful test that 
can be applied when assessing patients for unequivocal progression is to consider if 
the increase in overall disease burden based on the change in non
-
measurable 
disease is comparable in magnitude to th
e increase that would be required to declare 
PD for measurable disease: i.e., an increase in tumor burden representing an 
additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter 
in a measurable lesion).  Examples include an incr
ease in a pleural effusion from 
‘trace’ to ‘large’, an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to 
widespread
, or 
may be described in protocols as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’.  If 
‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the 
patient
 
should
 
be considered to have had 
overall PD at that point.

Evaluation of Best Overall Response
 
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for 
progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The 
patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria.

of nivolumab 
with 
concurrent epigenetic 
therapy (consisting of azacitidine and entinostat)
 
for 6 cycles

The study will enroll up to 
20
 
patients on Arm 
D, 2
0 patients on Arm 
E and 20 
patients on Arm 
F
. 
With this amendment, there will be no further 
enrollment for treatment
 
on Arm 
C, although 
these patients will be allowed to cross over to Arms E or F 
if they progress and are otherwise 
eligible
.
 
The sample size is driven by what we think
 
is feasible for enrollment over a 
reasonable period of time (e.g., a few years). We are including futility analyses within each 
Arm to allow us to stop a treatment arm if it appears not to have enough activity to warrant 
further investigation. Additionall
y, we have interim analyses to assess the feasibility of 
continuing an arm, with feasibility defined in the previous subsection.
 
 
The final analysis for each arm will be descriptive, consisting of summary statistics and 
confidence intervals. We will use survival analysis methods (e.g., the Kaplan
-
Meier survival 
estimation) for time
-
to
-
event data. 
We will not adjust for multiple compa
risons; the futility 
analyses do not inflate the type I error, as seen in the simulation results (see section 10.4)
.
  
Allowing for up to 10% inevaluable patients, we will enroll up to 
22
 
patients
 
on each Arm, 
or a 
total of 
66
.  Anticipated accrual rate is 
5 patients per month.

Stratification Factors
 
There are no stratification factors in this study. Patients will be assigned treatment
 
Arm 
based on prior therapeutic regimen and disease response to that regimen.

Interim Analyses
 
The study design calls for interim futility 
analysis by arm
.  These analyses will occur 
separately by arm once 
10 patients are on an arm and have eithe
r received at least 6 cycles 
of therapy or experienced a PFS event. Subsequent analyses will occur after 15 patients 
have either received at least 6 cycles of therapy or experienced a PFS event.
 
The final 
analysis will occur after 20 patients have 
entered and received full therapy (6 cycles).
 
The 
futility analysis 
is based on Bayesian hypothesis testing
32
. 
 
 
For Arm D, we take the expected ORR to be 20% if epigenetic therapy does not increase 
the clinical effectiveness of nivolumab alone. This estim
ate is based on results of the 
Checkmate studies (
CheckMate 057 (non

RR 
 
= 
19%;
 
CheckMate017 
(sq

). We would consider the addition of epigenetic therapy 
encouraging if the ORR is 35% or higher. The study will sto
p for futility if we see 0 
responses among the first 10 patients or no more than 1 response in the first 15 patients. 
We will 
not consider this Arm
 
promising if we see 3 or fewer responders out of 20 patients.

racteristics for Arm D based on 5000

Feasibility monitoring
 
 
We will use separate Bayesian calculations to monitor the feasibility of each treatment. We 
define feasibility as the ability for a patient to take their full course of their assigned treatment 
(minimum of six cycles) through 
24
 
weeks, except for progressi
on or death. If there is 
considerable probability (
≥
 
67%) that the regimen is feasible for less than half of the patients, 
we will consider stopping the study.  
We will base the decision on
 
the posterior probability
 
that
 
the treatment is not feasible (> 50% of patients who do not progress or die before 
24
 
weeks 
do not make it to 
24
 
weeks). The prior distribution for this calculation is Uniform
 
(0,1). 
We will 
apply the monitoring rule separately by treatment group
, and the
 
analysis will occur at the time 
of each interim analysis
.  For each treatment 
Arm
, though, we will apply the rules to all patients 
pooled together, rather than separately within each subtype, since we do not expect one group 
to be at greater risk of toxic
ity than the other.  We will consider stopping the study if the data 
indicate that the treatment regimen is feasible for less than half of all patients, where we 
quantify certainty as two thirds or greater (i.e., 2:1 odds it is not feasible).
 
 
Rule: Stop i
f there is two
-
thirds (2:1 odds) or greater probability that 50% or more patients 
cannot complete at least 6 cycles of therapy 
(
24
 
weeks
),
 
unless the patient’s disease 
progressed or the patient died.

Baseline tumor
 
biopsy is required and
 
will be analyzed in all subjects. 
Tumor 
biop
sy
 
while 
on epigenetic therapy
 
and at progression are required
 
for
 
all Arms. 
These are detailed in the 
patient calendars found in 
Section 8
. 
 
 
As many of the following studies will be 
performed as tissue availability allows:
 

 
I
mmunohistochemi
cal 
(IHC) 
staining of tumor samples for PD
-
L1 
infiltrating immune
 
 
cell subsets (CD3, 4, 8, 20, 68)
, as well as other immune markers
 
using both IHC or
 
 
ISH
.
 

 
Laser capture microdissection, or macrodissection, followed by qRT
-
PCR and whole
-
 
 
genome microarray for pre
-
 
and post
-
treatment gene expression profiles related to
 
 
immunological pathways.
 

 
Quantitative candidate promoter methylation analysis: 
APC

Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs)
 
 
       
 
Baseline PBMCs will be analyzed as well as PBMCs 
following two 
cycles of therapy
, 
prior to the third 
cycle 
(ie/between week 4 of
 
Cycle 2 and week 1 of cycle 3
)
.
 
 
 
Pre
-
 
and post
-
epigenetic therapy PBMCs will be evaluated for 
C
ytokine
 
expression, 
 
 
epigenetic status of cytokine promoters, and induction of
 
responses to tumor antigens as 
 
well as other immunologic evaluations.

Analysis
 
 
To assess pharmacodynamic effects in samples obtained from subjects on each 
treatment arm, summary statistics for biomarkers of immunoregulatory activity and their 
corresponding changes (or percen
t changes) from baseline will be tabulated.  Possible 
associations between changes in biomarker measures of interest and exposure to drug 
will be explored graphically.  The frequency of significant demethylation and acetylation 
will be summarized in both t
reatment arms.  The difference between the methylation 
indices post
-
 
and pre
-
treatment will be compared using paired Student’s t
-
test.  Similar 
analyses will be performed for other biomarker parameters.  Relationships between 
changes in gene re
-
expression 
and other correlates with clinical response will be 
assessed using 
t
he Mantel
-
Haenszel test
.  In addition, estimates of the variance in the 
biological correlative parameters will be made in this group to be used in planning the 
integration of these 
studies in future trials.

Study Drug Dose, Mode of Administration, and Administration Rate:   
Investigational Product:  
The dose levels of laquinimod are 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mg  qd. Every patient will take 3 capsules once daily, 
at the same time of day, during the entire study period.  
• Patients randomized to the laquinimod 1.5 mg  qd treatment arm will receive 3 capsules of 
0.5 mg  laquinimod. (Note: the treatment of this high dose  arm was discontinued as of 10 
January 2016) 
• Patients randomized to the laquinimod 1.0 mg  qd treatment arm will receive 2 capsules of 
0.5 mg  laquinimod and 1 capsules of matching placebo. 
• Patients randomized to the laquinimod 0.5 mg  qd treatment arm will receive 1 capsule of 
0.5 mg  laquinimod, and 2 capsules of matching placebo. 
Placebo: Patients randomized to the placebo treatment arm will receive 3 capsules of matching placebo.  
The capsules will be taken orally and must be swallowed whole with a glass of water. The capsule should 
not be opened. Laquinimod can be taken with or without food. 
Method of Blinding and Randomization:  
Prior to 10 January 2016, patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment with laquinimod at a 
dosage of 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 mg qd or a matching placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio.  
As of 10 January  2016, following the decision to discontinue treatment of the laquinimod 1.5 mg dose 
arm, additional eligible patients who are enrolled will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive treatment with laquinimod at a dosage of 0.5, 1.0 mg qd or a matching placebo. No change was performed to the 
original randomization list except that the patient numbers assigned to laquinimod 1.5 mg/day were 
removed from the list by the 
interactive response t echnology (IRT) vendor. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4  Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
13 Patients and investigators will remain blinded to treatment assignment during the study.  
The randomization code will be generated by the Clinical Supply Chain (CSC) department following 
specifications from the Biostatistics Departm ent.  
In addition, the sponsor’s clinical personnel involved in the study will be blinded to the study drug identity until the database has been  locked for analysis and the treatment assignment revealed.  
Duration of Participation:  
Total study participatio n will be up to 14 months:  
• Screening period of 2 weeks up to 5 weeks  
• 12 months double-blind, placebo- controlled treatment period  
• Safety follow-up period 1 month following the last dose of study medication. 
General Design and Methodology:   
This is a mult inational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study, 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of daily oral administration of laquinimod (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg ) in 
patients with HD.  Prior to 10 January  2016, eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment 
with laquinimod at a dosage of 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, or 1.5 mg/day or a matching placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio . 
As of 10 January 2016, treatment with laquinimod was discontinued for all patients in the 1.5 mg dose 
group, and future patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive laquinimod 0.5 mg/day or 1.0 
mg/day or matching placebo for 52 weeks.  
It is planned to randomize a total of 300 patients (100 patients within each study arm), plus the 30 patients 
that wer e already randomized to the laquinimod 1.5 mg treatment arm.  Patients will be treated with 
investigational product or matching placebo for 12 months, and efficacy and safety will be assessed after 
1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of treatment. 
The following assessments will be performed at the specified time points:  
• Eligibility criteria will be reviewed and confirmed at screening and baseline.  
• Vital signs will be measured at each study visit.  
• A physical examination will be performed at each study visit (including weight) .  
• Cardiovascular risk assessment and management (including smoking history) at screening 
and as soon as possible for patients already in the study, following approval of Global 
Amendment 04. 
• The following safety clinical laboratory tests will be performed:  
○ When applicable per local requirements, patients will undergo an HIV test at screening.  
○ Complete blood count (CBC) with differential at each study visit.  
○ Anemia panel (blood smear, serum iron, ferritin, total iron binding capacity, folic acid, haptoglobin, interleukin [IL] -1, IL -6, interferon [IFN] -γ, tumor necrosis factor [TNF] -α, 
and hepcidin) and B12 at baseline.  
○ Serum chemistry (including electrolytes, liver enzymes, urea, creatinine, glucose, total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, Creatine phosphokinase (CPK), serum conventional C -
reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen and pancreatic amylase) – at all scheduled visits. 
Estimated  creatinine clearance will be  calculated  at all study visits .  
○ Lipid profile [total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides] – at baseline and Month 12.  
○ Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), T3 and Free T4 at baseline (Month 0), Month 
6 and Month 12  
○ Urinalysis at the screening visit.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4  Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
14 ○ Serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( β-hCG) in women of child-bearing potential 
will be performed at each scheduled study visit.  
○ Urine β-hCG test will be performed in women of child-bearing potential at baseline and 
at each scheduled study visit thereafter .  
○ Starting after visit Month 3 a urine β -hCG test will be performed at home in women of 
child -bearing potential every 28 (±2) days. The patient will be contacted by telephone 
within 72 hours after the scheduled test is to be performed and asked specific questions 
regarding the test. In case of suspected pregnancy (positive urine β-hCG test result), the 
caller will make sure that the study drug has been discontinued and the subject will be instructed to arrive to the site as soon as possible (within 10 days) with all remaining 
study drugs caps ules.  
• When applicable, patients will be screened  for drug substances in urine and/or CDT level in 
blood at screening  to confirm abstinence in former (more than 12 months from screening) 
alcohol and/or drug abusers.  
• Blood for analysis of cytokines and other soluble proteins will be collected at baseline, and at Months 6 and 12, concomitant with other blood draw procedures. 
• ECG will be performed at screening, baseline, and at Months 1, 3, 6, and 12, and will be 
centrally evaluated.  
• Blood sample for genomic analysis and CAG repeat length determination will be drawn at screening.  
• Adverse Events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study. 
• Suicidality will be monitored throughout the study through administration of the C- SSRS  
• Concomitant medications will be m onitored throughout the study. 
• All subjects will undergo MRI scans at baseline and Month 12.  
• Motor function evaluations (UHDRS -TMS and Q -Motor) will be performed at screening, 
baseline and at Months 1 , 3, 6 and 12. 
• Functional capacity evaluations (UHDRS- TFC and mPPT) will be performed at baseline and 
at Months 6 and 12. The UHDRS -TFC is also performed at screening.  
• Clinical global impression will be evaluated by an independent rater using the Clinician's

17 Statistical Considerations:   
Sample Size 
The study aims to detect potential beneficial effects in deteriorating clinical signs and symptoms. Based 
on previous studies in patients with HD, the UHDRS- TMS has been shown to be one of the more 
sensitive clinical measures to detect decline in symptoms of HD. I t is estimated that approximately 100 
patients per arm will enable a power of 80% to detect a beneficial effect of 2.5 points or more in the 
change from baseline in UHDRS -TMS of an active laquinimod arm compared to placebo, assuming 
standard deviation (SD)  of 6.2 and type I error of 5%. 
As the intention is to investigate laquinimod as a treatment with the potential to slow disease progression 
and prohibit neuronal death in the CNS, the study should also be sized to be able to detect changes in brain atrophy rate after treatment with laquinimod. One of the most sensitive measures to detect brain 
atrophy over time in patients with HD is change in the caudate volume. It is estimated that approximately 
100 patients per arm will also enable a power of 80% to detect a beneficial effect of 0.95 (30% of the estimated decline in placebo) or more in the percent change from baseline in caudate brain atrophy of an active laquinimod arm compared to placebo, assuming SD of 2.36 and type I error of 5%. 
Statistical Analyses   
Due to the decision from 10 January  2016 to discontinue treatment of the laquinimod 1.5 mg dose arm, 
and the  low number of enrolled patients compared to the target  at this time, data from the laquinimod 
1.5 mg treatment  arm will be presented descriptively  only, and will not be included in any inferential 
analyses  for efficacy or safety . 
Control of Type I Error Rate 
The Hochberg’s Step-Up method for multiple comparisons between treatment arms in combination with 
the hierarchical method between the primary efficacy endpoint and the secondary efficacy endpoints, will be used to maintain the experiment wise type I error of 5% level.  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis 
The change from baseline in UHDRS- TMS will be analyzed using a Repeated Measures model (SAS® 
MIXED procedure with REPEATED sub-command). The model will include the following fixed effects: 
categorical week in trial by treatment interaction, center, and UHDRS-TMS at baseline. The unstructured 
covariance matrix for repeated observations within patients will be used. In case that the model will not 
converge, the Maximum -Likelihood (ML) estimation method will be used instead of the default 
Restricted ML (REML). If the model still does not converge then a simpler covariance structures with less parameters  will be used, according to the following order: Heterogeneous Autoregressive(1) 
[ARH(1)], Heterogeneous Compound Symmetry (CSH), Autoregressive(1) [AR(1)], and Compound 
Symmetry (CS). The estimated means at the Month 12 visit will be compared between the active 
treatment arms and the placebo arm.  
The Hochberg’s Step-Up method for multiple comparisons between treatment arms will be used to control inflation in type I error rate. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints Analyses  
According to the hierarchical method to control inflation in type I error rate for multiple endpoints, any statistically significant dose that will be observed in the primary analysis will continue to be tested for the 
secondary endpoints at an alpha level of 5%, according to the secondary endpoi nts order.  
The secondary efficacy  endpoints: change from baseline in HD- CAB total score and change from baseline 
in UHDRS - TFC, will be analyzed in the same way as the primary efficacy endpoint except that the 
efficacy endpoint evaluation at baseline will be included in the model instead of baseline UHDRS- TMS.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4  Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
18 The CIBIC -Plus will be analyzed in the same way as the primary efficacy endpoint except that the 
baseline CIBIS (Clinician’s Interview -Based Impression of Severity) will be included in the model as t he 
efficacy measure at baseline.  
The percent change from baseline to Month 12/Early Termination in caudate volume will be analyzed 
using an Analysis Of Covariance (ANCOVA) model (SAS® MIXED procedure). The model will include 
the following fixed effects: tr eatment, center, and caudate volume at baseline. The estimated means at the 
Month 12 visit will be compared between the active treatment arms and the placebo arm. Early terminated patient observation will have their Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF).  
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints Analyses 
The exploratory efficacy  endpoints will be analyzed in the same way as the primary efficacy endpoint 
except that the efficacy endpoint evaluation at baseline will be included in the model instead of baseline UHDRS -TMS. 
The change from baseline to Month 12/Early Termination of continuous efficacy endpoints that are 
measured at baseline and at month 12 only, will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model (SAS® MIXED 
procedure). The model will include the following fixed effect s: treatment, center, and the efficacy 
measure at baseline. The estimated means at the Month 12 visit will be compared between the active 
treatment arms and the placebo arm. Early terminated patient observation will have their Last Observation 
Carried Forw ard (LOCF).  
Safety Analyses 
All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Each patient will be counted only once in each preferred term (PT) or system organ class (SOC) category for the analyses of safety. Summaries will be presented for all AEs, AEs determined by the investigator to be 
related to study treatment, serious AEs, and AEs causing withdrawal from the study. Summaries will be 
presented by treatment group and for all patients. Patient listings of SAEs and A Es leading to withdrawal 
will be presented.  
Changes in laboratory and vital signs measurement data will be summarized descriptively. All values will be compared with prespecified boundaries to identify potentially clinically significant changes or values, and such values will be listed.  
The use of concomitant medications will be summarized by therapeutic class using descriptive statistics. 
Concomitant medications will include all medications taken while the patient is treated with study drug.  
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, standard error, median, minimum, and 
maximum) will be provided for actual values and changes from baseline to each time point. For 
categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will be provided. Descriptive summaries of SAEs, patient withdrawals due to AEs, and potentially clinically significant abnormal values (clinical laboratory or vital signs) based on predefined criteria will also be provided.

34 1. BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
1.1. Introduction   
The aim of this clinical study is investigate the efficacy and safety of laquinimod as a potential 
treatment for patients with Huntington’s disease (HD).  
Laquinimod is developed by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. for Multiple Sclerosis (MS)  
and HD. The mechanism of action (MoA) of laquinimod includes modulation of the peripheral 
inflammation and central nervous system (CNS)- resident inflammatory response resultin g in 
down regulation of myelin and axonal damage. These effects are compatible with interference of NF-κB activation and may represent a novel protective mechanism which down regulates 
peripheral inflammation, CNS inflammation, tissue damage , and neurodegeneration in CNS 
diseases that involve microglia and astrocytic activation, like MS and HD. Recently performed studies show that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway is involved in the efficacy of laquinimod in the experimental autoimmune encephalomy elitis (EAE) model. Further 
investigations are ongoing, assessing the role of AhR in the MoA of laquinimod.  
Further, laquinimod was shown to cause a weak decrease of CYP3A4 activity and is a strong 
inducer of CYP1A enzymes. CYP1A induction is a biomarker of activation of the AhR 
transcription factor; activation of this pathway by laquinimod has been demonstrated. 
Given laquinimod’s suggested mode of action as an immunomodulator, its penetrance to the 
CNS in animals with an intact blood -brain -barrier, and i ts downregulation of activated microglia 
and astrocytes in the cuprizone induced demyelination model, its potential as a drug slowing disease progression in HD is being explored by Teva. 
Huntington 's disease is a hereditary disorder causing degeneration of neurons in the brain leading 
to uncontrolled movements, progressive loss of controlled motor function, cognitive decline, and 
emotional disturbance. The onset and progression varies but the most common age of onset is 
between 30 and 40 years. The illness generally lasts 15 -20 years, and has fatal outcome. 
HD manifests in 4 domains; motor impairment, cognitive decline, psychiatric problems, and loss 
of function, all as sessed by various rating scales . A number of medications are used off- label to 
control motor and emotional problems arising from HD. The scientific evidence for these drugs 
in HD is poor and most of these drugs have significant side effects. None of the drugs used today 
has an effect on disease progression. One drug, tetrabenazine, is approved to treat chorea 
associated with HD.  
It is believed that inflammatory processes in the CNS contribute to the pathogenesis of HD, via 
neuronal disturbances and cell death. Microglia, the major intrinsic immunocompetent cell in the 
CNS, are normally present in a quiescent state. Upon exposure to neuronal insults such as infection, ischaemia or the presence of abnormal protein aggregations (including mutant 
huntingtin aggregation), microglia become activated and release pro-inflammatory cytokines and 
cytotoxic  mediators. In addition, it has been shown that microglia hyperreactivity is an 
autonomous feature in HD, as the expression of mutant Huntingtin in microglia promotes pro-
inflamma tory transcriptional activity in the absence of proinflammatory stimuli. ( Crotti et al, 
2014) . This inflammatory activation may contribute to neuronal death. Microglia activation was 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4  Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
35 evident post- mortem in HD patients ( Sapp et al, 2001) as well as in -vivo in pre- symptomatic and 
symptomatic HD gene carriers, demonstrated by positron emission tomography (PET) tracer 
ligands to activation markers on microglia ( Tai et al, 2007). In -vivo microglia activation was 
shown in correlation with striatal neuronal dysfunction. These findings indicate that microglial 
activation is an early event in the pathogenic processes of HD and is associated with subclinical 
progression of disease. Elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines have been detected both in serum and cerebral spinal fluid in patients with HD. Specifically interleukin (IL) -6 levels were 
increased in the plasma of premanifest HD gene carriers. In addition, monocytes from HD patients as well as macrophages and microglia from the YAC128 HD model, were hyperactive in response to stimulation. In in vitro  experiments , utilizing monocytes from patients with HD and 
microglia cells from YAC128 mice, reduced levels of this aberrant IL-6 production was observed after incubation with laquinimod.  
Moreover, in a post- mortem analysis of HD patients striatum, RNA Levels of IL -6, IL -8, and 
tumor necrosis factor α  (TNF -α) were significantly increased ( Björkqvist et al, 2008). IL- 6 
release is triggered by activation of the NF -κB pathway. The increased cytokine release, in 
particular IL -6, correlates with the interesting finding that the N F-κB activity is upregulated in 
several HD cell models and transgenic mouse models, possibly by direct interaction of mutant htt 
and IKK ( Khoshnan et al, 2004).  
Further, cleavage of the mutant huntingtin protein by caspase-6 is believed  to contribute to the 
pathogenesis of HD ( Graham et al, 2011). In vitro studies have indicated that primary cortical 
neurons show reduced caspase 6 activity when treated with laquinimod, and laquinimod showed protective eff ects on axonal degeneration driven by caspase 6 activity. 
In human HD studies, astrocytosis is observed in affected regions of the brain of patients with HD. The mutated huntingtin protein co- localizes with these reactive astrocytes in specific 
regions ( Singhrao et al, 1998). Astrocytes from HD mice has been shown to have an aberrant 
activation of NF- κB, and peripheral monocytes from HD patients express a hyper- reactive 
phenotype. Investigation on the effect of laquinimod on human activated astrocytes demonstrates that laquinimod inhibits astrocyte morphological changes in response to inflammatory cytokines and decreases their production of pro- inflammatory compounds.  
No clinical studies with laquinimod in patients with HD have bee n performed, and the potential 
benefits of laquinimod treatment for individual patients participating in this study is not known. 
The study is designed to investigate pote ntial beneficial effects after treatment with laquinimod 
in patients with HD. The rationale for this is based on the immunomodulatory effects in CNS 
associated with treatment with laquinimod, findings indicating that laquinimod downregulates 
aberrant  cytok ine production from HD monocytes and microglia, and reports in the scientific 
literature that aberrant  inflammatory phenotypic changes are an intrinsic feature  in patients with 
HD and animal models for HD.   
1.2. Name and Description of Investigational Product   
Laquinimod (International Non-proprietary Name), also known by the laboratory code TV-5600 
or ABR -215062 sodium salt, is a quinoline-3- carboxamide derivative. It is a novel chemical 
compound with the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry name sodium 5-chloro-3-(ethyl(phenyl)carbamoyl) -1-methyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-4- olate.

36 The laquinimod investigational medicinal product is available as capsules containin g laquinimod 
sodium equivalent to 0.5 mg  laquinimod.  
Laquinimod capsules and corresponding placebo are supplied as white opaque cap and body, 
hard gelatine capsules filled with white to off- white granulate. The capsules are packed in high -
density polyethylene ( HDPE ) bottles equipped with child- resistant caps  and should be stored at 
room temperature (+15 °C to +25°C ). 
A more detailed description of the product is given in Se ction  3.4. 
1.3. Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies   
1.3.1. Nonclinical Studies   
Laquinimod is rapidly absorbed resulting in high oral bioavailability of 80- 90% in all animal 
species tested and its exposure was sh own to increase proportionally with dose without major sex 
differences. Low or n o accumulation of parent drug and/or metabolites in tissues was observed. 
Laquinimod does not preferentially distribute to skin and eyes, and no uptake of radioactivity 
was reg istered in melanin -containing structures in either skin or eye. Laquinimod- related 
radioactivity was shown to be covalently bound to plasma and liver proteins in vitro however no adduct was found in human in-vivo.  
Laquinimod metabolism is mostly Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4- mediated biotransformations 
resulting in a few hydroxylated and dealkylated minor metabolites which could undergo further 
glucuronidation. A ll circulating plasma human metabolites were formed in animal test species at  
adequate exposure levels . Laquinimod was shown to cause a weak decrease of CYP3A4 activity 
and is a strong inducer of CYP1A enzymes. CYP1A induction is a biomarker of activation of the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) transcription factor; activation of this pathway by laquinimod 
has been demonstrated. 
For a complete overview of the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME)-
pharmacokinetic (PK) program of laquinimod, please refer to the Laquinimod Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB).  
The nonclinical safety program of laquinimod has encompassed separate investigations on vital 
organ systems, single and repeat dose toxicity in mice (duration up to 13 weeks), rats (duration 
up to 26 weeks), and dogs (duration up to 52 weeks), genotoxicity, carcinogenicity studies in p53+/- transgenic mice and in rats, toxicity to reproduction, photosafety testing, immunotoxicity evaluation, and local tolerance. 
Safety pharmacology studies in the rat and dog did not demonstrate significant effects of 
laquinimod on the function of cardiovascular, respiratory, central nervous, renal and 
gastrointestinal systems providing safety margins in the range of 32 to 257-fold above the 
originally intended clinical dose of 1.5 mg /day based on maximal plasma concentrations.  
Overall, the non- clinical safet y program identified several safety issues. Specifically, the 
toxicities identified are pro -inflammatory effects (including thyroiditis), mild liver toxicity, and 
mild reductions of red blood cell indices. In general, the severity of these effects was dose-related and toxicity was mostly reversible upon drug discontinuation. The nature of these toxic

Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4  Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
37 events allows adequate monitoring in the clinical setting (for details please refer to current 
edition of the laquinimod Investigator’s Brochure).  
Laquinimod was neither mutagenic nor clastogenic in in vitro and in vivo assays. Laquinimod 
treatment resulted in the  formation of micronuclei in vitro and in vivo through an aneugenic 
mechanism, with broad safety margin (>32) above the originally intended clinical d ose of 
1.5 mg /day.  
The carcinogenicity program consisted of a 26-week study in transgenic p53+/- mice and a 2 -
year rat study. The study in transgenic p53+/- mice did not show an increase in treatment- related 
neoplastic findings at any tested dose. In the 2- year rat carcinogenicity study, increased 
incidence of uterine adenocarcinomas was observed in high dose female rats. It is the sponsor’s 
position that this finding is likely due to a decrease in the incidence of prolactin secreting 
pituitary adenomas th at was observed in this study. In contrast to rodents, in humans, prolactin is 
not a luteinizing hormone and does not affect the estrogen/ progesterone ratio; therefore the 
mechanism proposed by the sponsor is not considered relevant to humans. A higher incidence of thyroid follicular cell adenomas was observed in high dose male rats. This lesion is considered to be related to laquinimod’s induction of liver enzymes and consequently enhanced clearance of 
thyroid hormones in rats, a well- characterized rat -specific mechanism proposed by the sponsor, 
that is not considered relevant to humans.  
In addition, an increase in the incidence of oral cavity tumors was noted in mid and high dose females (2/60 in each group). The oral effects may relate to the AhR activat ion properties of 
laquinimod since similar lesions were seen  following lifelong exposure of rats to other AhR 
activators . However , the incidence of oral cavity tumors in rats treated with laquinimod was 
lower than that seen with industrial chemicals such a s 2,3,7,8- tetrachloro -p-dibenzodioxin 
(TCDD) (NTP TR -521
1) and dioxin-like compounds (DLCs), and was more similar to the 
incidence seen with the dietary ingredient indole-3-carbinol (I3C) found in cruciferous vegetables. Of note, the oral tumors seen with I3C were considered by the US National 
Toxicology Program as irrelevant for I3C risk assessment (NTP TR -584
2). No increased 
incidence of oral tumors was seen in humans exposed to TCDD, indicating a species specific response in rats. Therefore, oral cavity tumors induced by laquinimod in rats after a lifelong 
exposure do not imply an elevated carcinogenicity risk in humans. Humans, in general, also seem to be less sensitive to AhR activation by laquinimod than rats, as shown by the differential gene expressi on profiles discussed in the IB.  
A standard pre- and post- natal toxicity study and a follow -up investigational study in rats 
demonstrated urogenital malformations in female rat offspring exposed in utero to laquinimod at 
doses similar to the clinical dose of 0.5 mg/day based on exposure. A slight delay in puberty and 
reduction in fertility were noted in rat offspring exposed in utero to laquinimod at doses slightly

38 higher than the originally intended clinical dose of 1.5 mg /day in humans . The mechanism 
leading to the malformations in rats is unknown. Induction of urogenital malformations in 
rodents has been reported for a variety of agents including sex hormones and the AhR agonist 
TCDD. Several studies were performed to investigate the potential hormonal modulating activity 
of laquinimod, but no such effects were demonstrated at clinically relevant levels. In a pre- and 
post-natal toxicity study in monkeys, the high dose level was associated with higher incidence of prenatal loss which limited the number of monkeys that could be evaluated, but there were no 
treatment -related malformations at doses up to 9 -fold the expected plasma exposure at the 
originally intended clinical dose of 1.5 mg/day.  
Based on the above, humans should not be exposed to laquinimod during pregnancy. 
A complete overview of the safety pharmacology and non-clinical safety program of laquinimod 
is presented in Laquinimod IB. 
In the planned clinical study, potential risks will be mitigated by careful screening of patients and  
monitoring of patients and appropriate stopping rules for certain potential AEs related to the 
toxicology target organs. Furthermore, an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be assigned to assess the data in an unblinded manner (see Section 7). The body of existing 
clinical safety data for the doses studied to date suggests that laquinimod is safe and well -
tolerated.  
1.3.2. Clinical Studies  
1.3.2.1. Clinical Pharmacology Studies  
Laquinimod is considered to have high oral bioav ailability with linear, time independent and 
predictable PK that is characterized by high plasma protein binding (>98%), high oral 
bioavailability (~90%), low oral clearance (~0.09 L/h), low apparent volume of distribution (~10 L), and long half- life (~80 h). Absorption under fasting conditions is rapid and maximal plasma 
levels attained generally within 1 hour after laquinimod administration. Concomitant administration with a high -fat high -calorie meal results in reduction of the absorption rate 
reflected by prolongation of the time to maximal plasma drug concentration (T
max) to 
approximately 5 hours and reduction of the maximum plasma concentration (C max) by 30%. Food 
however did not significantly affect the overall extent of absorption AUC. 
Laquinimod is extensively metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4. Laquinimod metabolites 
levels in plasma are very low and parent laquinimod is the main systemically circulating entity. 
Laquinimod PK is affected by moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (2.5- and 3.1-fold increase in laquinimod systemic exposure, respectively) and strong CYP3A4 inducers and 
moderate hepatic impairment. Studies have shown that laquinimod is a strong inducer of 
CYP1A2 and a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4. Therefore, co-administration of laquinimod m ay 
affect the systemic exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP450 1A2 or CYP3A4. 
Plasma levels of drugs that are CYP1A2 substrates may decrease when combined with 
laquinimod and within 30 days after the last laquinimod dose, rendering these drugs less effecti ve.  
In general, it is recommended to avoid the use of CYP1A2 substrates in clinical trials of laquinimod. Therapeutic alternatives may be considered in context.

Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4  Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
39 For additional information  on concomitant use of laquinimod with CYP1A2 substrates , please 
refer to Section  5.3.2.  
Studies in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment resulted in an increase of  
laquinimod exposure by approximately 1.3- and 2.3-fold, respectively. In subjects with moderate 
renal impairment, laquinimod exposure was increased by 1.4-fold. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was further used to predict the effect of hepatic impairment and renal  
impairment on the pharmacokinetics of laquinimod after single and multiple doses of 0.6 to 1.5 mg in comparison with  healthy subjects (Study DP-2015-017). The model predictions 
indicated  that mild hepatic impairment and moderate renal impairment would result in further 
modest increases in exposure to laquinimod following multiple 0.6mg dose administration based on unbound drug concentration (1.71-fold and 1.65- fold, respectively). More significant 
increases in laquinimod exposure, in particular in terms of unbound drug fraction, are predicted in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (3.41- and 6.51- fold, respectively) or  
severe renal impairment (1.86-fold). The model predictions indicate d similar increases in 
systemic laquinimod exposure with a given stage of organ impairment across the 0.6- to 1.5mg dose range following s ingle - or multipledose administration, demonstrating that the 
doseproportional pharmacokinetics of laquinimod is maintained in subjects with hepatic impairment (mild to severe) and renal impairment (moderate to severe) across this dose range.  
1.3.2.2. Clinical Safe ty and Efficacy Studies   
No clinical data on the effects of laquinimod in patients with HD is available. However, clinical 
data from patients with relapsing remitting MS show a benefit of laquinimod treatment on brain 
atrophy and disability progression after 1 year of treatment, also in patients without relapses 
during this period. A disproportionally large effect on disability compared to relapses was also observed. The results suggest that in addition to peripheral inflammatory modulating effects, 
laquinimod could also have neuroprotective effects, and a mode of affecting CNS inflammatory 
processes beyond the classical MS dogma of active T cell driven lesions.  
Detailed information concerning all clinical studies with laquinimod is presented in the IB. For a 
brief overview on these studies, see also Section  1.5. 
1.4. Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects   
1.4.1. Known and Potential Risks and Benefits for Laquinimod  
1.4.1.1. Potential Risk Based on Non Clinical Safet y Findings  
Laquinimod has been extensively studied in a battery of non clinical safety studies. The data and major findings have been described in Section  1.3.1, and in the current IB. The toxicities 
identified a re pro -inflammatory effects (including thyroiditis), mild liver toxicity, and mild 
reductions of red blood cell indices. The severity of these effects was dose- related and toxicity 
was mostly reversible upon drug discontinuation.  
As these events are addre ssed in the clinical setting by frequent monitoring of relevant clinical 
laboratory assessments (described in  Section  7.3), and were all reversible, it is judged that these 
non-clinical findings should not preclude administration of laquinimod to patients with HD as 
described in this protocol. Careful screening of patients and appropriate stopping rules for 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4  Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
40 specific AEs related to the toxicology target organs, as described in  Appendix A , will further 
minimize any potential risk.  
1.4.1.2. Potential Risk Based on Clinical Safety Findings  
This is the first clinical study with laquinimod in HD. Therefore, no clinical data on the effects of 
laquinimod in patients with Huntington’s dis ease is available, and a wide dose range exploration 
is warranted.  
Unless noted otherwise, characterization of the safety profile (important risks and ADRs) of 
laquinimod is based on the pivotal MS studies, in which laquinimod was administered to a total of 983 MS patients at a dose of 0.6 mg /day for up to 2 years. 
Very common or important adverse reactions include headache, abdominal pain, back and neck 
pain and appendicitis. Mild liver enzyme elevations [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine 
aminotran sferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)] have been reported 
commonly, but Hy’s law criteria have not been met and there have been no cases of liver failure. 
Treatment with laquinimod may be associated with some additional laboratory abnormali ties, 
including haematological changes [Hemoglobin (Hgb) decreased/anaemia, white blood cells (WBC) increased, platelets decreased] and elevation of blood C-reactive protein (CRP) or fibrinogen levels; these laboratory changes are generally mild and asympt omatic.  
The safety profile of laquinimod is provided in detail below:

Description of selected adverse drug reactions:  
1.4.1.2.1. Liver enzyme elevations:  
Treatment with laquinimod has been associated with mostly mild, reversible, asymptomatic liver 
enzyme elevations that generally occur within 6 months after initiation of treatment (see 
Table 2) . 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4  Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
42 In clinical trials, laquinimod was discontinued if elevation of liver enzymes exceeded 5 times the 
upper l imit of the normal range (ULN) for more than two weeks in the absence of a clear 
alternative explanation; if the elevation exceeded 8 times the ULN laquinimod was discontinued 
without further delay.

1.4.1.2.2. Elevated blood fibri nogen level  
Treatment with laquinimod has been associated with an increased incidence (43% vs. 34%; 
laquinimod vs. placebo) of shifts of blood fibrinogen to levels that are above normal, without clinical manifestations. M aximal fibrinogen did not exceed 2.5x> ULN; maximal fibrinogen was 
9.0 g/l in the laquinimod group and 8.4 g/l in the placebo group until month 24 of the pivotal MS studies. 
1.4.1.2.3. Elevated blood CRP level  
An increase in blood CRP level has not been found in clinical studies in subjects treated w ith 
laquinimod at a dose of 0.6 mg /day. In the phase III trials, until month 15, the proportion of 
patients with elevations in both CRP and fibrinogen was slightly higher in the laquinimod group 
compared to placebo. An increase of CRP and fibrinogen was seen in the dose- escalating studies 
with higher doses than 0.6 mg .  
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4  Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
43 1.4.1.2.4. Back and neck pain  
Treatment with laquinimod has been associated with an increased incidence of back and neck 
pain. Back and neck pains usually occur during the first three months of treatm ent, are generally 
of mild severity, but may sometimes occur at a later time point, be of longer duration or require 
symptomatic treatment.  
1.4.1.2.5. Appendicitis  
Treatment with laquinimod has been associated with an increased incidence of appendicitis. There is no characteristic pattern for this risk in terms of duration of treatment and no predisposing factors were identified. This diagnosis should be considered in patients with typical symptoms.  
1.4.1.2.6. Haematological changes 
Hgb decrease/Anaemia:   
Treatment with laquinimod has been associated with a mild, asymptomatic, non -progressive 
decrease of the haemoglobin level, which occurs early after initiation of treatment and is usually transient without cessation of therapy or need for anti- anaemic therapy.  
Decreased platelet s: 
Treatment with laquinimod has been associated with a generally mild decrease of the platelet count, without clinical manifestations.  
Increased white blood cells:  
Treatment with laquinimod has been associated with a generally mild increase of the total  white 
blood cell count that is consistent across white blood cell subtypes, without clinical manifestations.  
As per the current protocol, regular monitoring of liver enzymes, complete blood count ( CBC ), 
blood fibrinogen and CRP levels will be performed ( described in  Section  7.3), and patients will 
be followed regularly for adverse events. The sponsor considers these means as adequate to 
address laquinimod- related safety concerns. To further mitigate any potential risks, patients with 
unstable medical conditions will be excluded from the study. In addition, an independent DSMB 
will be assigned to assess the data in unblinded manner (see Section  7). 
1.4.1.2.7. Cardiovascular Events (in the high-dose treatment arms of the ongoing MS 
studies)  
In December 2015, the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) for the Teva-sponsored MS studies, 
LAQ -MS-305 (CONCERTO) and TV5600- CNS -20006 (ARPEGGIO) , found an imbalance in 
serious cardiovascular events  in the high-dose treatment arms of these studies (1.2 mg in 
CONCERTO, 1.5  mg in ARPEGGIO) . Six cases of myocardial infarction occurred in the 
CONCERTO 1.2 mg treatment arm, compared with  no events in the 0.6 mg or placebo treatment 
arms, along with a cerebral infarction in a 31-yearold man in the 1.2 mg treatment arm. In the 
ARPEGGIO study,  1 myocardial infarction event was identified in the laquinimod 1.5 mg 
treatment arm.  The decisions were largely based on data from  15 November 2015 when total 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4  Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
44 exposure in CONCERTO was 3070 patient-years in 2199 individuals, and total exposure in 
ARPEGGIO was 35 patient -years in 191 individuals.  
Due to these events, the DMC recommended stopping the high- dose treatment arms  (1.2 mg/day 
and 1.5 mg/day) in the laquinimod MS trials. The DMC did not identify any overt cardiovascular 
risk in the 0.6 mg treatment arm, but felt that long  term monitoring for emergence of any signal 
was necessary. The DMC also recommended  that study subjects continuing on laquinimod 
0.6 mg be recon sented with information about the cardiovascular risk seen at higher doses.  
On 07 January 2016, the LEGATO- HD Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) was called by 
Teva to review and discuss the recommendations of the DMC for the CONCERTO and ARPEGGIO MS trials  and their implications on LEGATO -HD. The DSMB confirmed that no 
cardiovascular events had been observed to date for any dose of the LEGATO- HD trial and 
concurred with the Sponsor’s recommendation that the high- dose ( ie, 1.5 mg) arm in this trial be 
discontinued as a proactive safety measure. The DSMB approved the continuation of the 0.5 mg/day and 1.0 mg/day arms with enhanced monitoring and safety precautions.  
Teva notified LEGATO-HD investigators on 10 January 2016 to immediately contact patients 
randomized to the high dose of 1.5 mg laquinimod and instruct them to discontinue study 
medication as a proactive measure to protect the safety of patients (endorsed by DSMB as noted above).  
Currently , the mechanism of the cardiovascular events remains unknown. Although no specific 
time-to-event patterns have been identified  in the MS studies, cardiovascular risk factors and 
demographics may play a role. Different pre-existing risk factors were noted, including 
hypertension, high cholesterol, and/or smoking hi story. While all cases exhibited signs of 
myocardial tissue injury, the cardiac work- up in these cases revealed heterogeneous etiologies. 
Of note, the cases all had some established cardiovascular risk factors, including patients with probable myocarditis or with probable familial hypercholesterolemia. Further investigation s into 
potential predictors and the potential causality are ongoing. 
1.4.1.3. Other Potential Safety Issues with Laquinimod  
1.4.1.3.1. Pregnancy  
Studies in rats have shown reproductive toxicity including te ratogenicity (urogenital 
malformations) at doses similar to the clinical dose of 0.5  mg/day in humans. Delay in puberty 
and reduced fertility were noted in rat offspring exposed to laquinimod in utero at doses slightly 
higher than the originally intended clinical dose of 1.5 mg /day in humans (see Section  1.3.1). 
The relevance to humans of these findings is not known, but cannot be excluded.  
Exposure to laquinimod during pregnancy must be avoided.  
To prevent such exposure, female patients who are of child -bearing potential (for example 
women who are not postmenopausal or surgically sterilized) must practice an acceptable method 
of birth control (see Section  7.2) for 30 days before initiation of treatment, and 2 acceptable 
methods of birth control throughout treatment and for 30 days after cessation of treatment. Use 
of acceptable contraception will be ascertained at every study visit.   
In addition, regular pregnancy testing is required during the study. If pregnancy is suspected despite all recommended precautions (based on a positive pregnancy test, delay in menses or any 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4  Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
45 other reason to suspect pregnancy), treatment should be discontinued immediately. The patient 
will be reminded of the potential risk to the fetus, and all options, including discontinuation of 
pregnancy, should be discussed.  
All female patients should be counseled by the investigator about the potential risks of exposure 
to laquinimod during pregnancy and the need to use acceptable contraception and avoid 
pregnancy throughout treatment with laquinimod and for 30 days after cessation of treatment. 
1.4.1.3.2. Cancer  
An increase in the incidence of uterine and oral cancers was observed in rats (see Section  1.3.1). 
It is the sponsor’s position that these findings are likely related to species- specific mechanisms. 
While a connection to humans cannot be entirely excluded, these mechanisms are likely not 
relevant to humans. Currently available clinical data does not suggest that laquinimod at a dose of 0.6 mg /day is associated with an increased risk of cancer.   
1.4.1.3.3. Cardiotoxicity and Systemic Inflammation 
In clinical studies performed with laquinimod's predecessor, roquinimex, pericarditis/pleuritis and ischaemic heart disorders were identified as important safety concerns. S erious toxicities  that 
occurred during Phase 3 trials led to discontinuation of these trials. Roquinimex demonstrated serious toxicities incuding increased r ates of  myocardial infarction, pericarditis and pleuritis that 
were observed in three Phase 3, placebo-controlled studies in MS patients. The mechanism by 
which roquinimex caused these events was not identified, but they were considered to be possible manifestatio ns of a systemic inflammatory response, an assessment which was also 
supported by roquinimex non- clinical findings.  
A thorough analysis was done on the laquinimod safety data (which is mostly reflective of the 0.6 mg /day dose) to evaluate similar potential safety issues. Based on 2347 patients exposed to 
laquinimod 0.6 mg for over 10,000 MS  patient -years , as well as the patients exposed to 0.6 mg in 
the CONCERTO and ARPEGGIO stud ies, analyses showed that these safety issues do not 
constitute a signal for laquinimod in doses up to 0.6 mg/day. However, at doses of 1.2 and 1.5 mg, laquinimod manifested a potential clinical signal  of myocardial infarction  in the MS 
trials . 
1.4.1.3.4. QT Prolongation 
Even though laquinimod in doses up to 1.2 mg  once daily ( qd) did not prolong the QTcF 
interval, (based on the thorough QT study TQT- LAQ-122), and pre -clinical data do not indicate 
a potential for laquinimod to influence the QT interval, higher doses of laquinimod have not been studied for potential QT prolongation effects. ECG monitoring is implemented in this protocol, as described in  Section  7.5.  
1.4.1.4. Justification for Using Placebo 
There are no standard treatments in HD, and no registered drugs known to slow disease progression are avai lable for patients with HD. The only approved drug for treatment of HD is 
Tetrabenazine, which is indicated for treatment of chorea in patients with HD. A number of 
medications are used off -label to control motor and emotional problems arising from HD. All of 
these drugs are symptomatic, and the scientific evidence for their use in patients with HD is poor. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4  Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
46 In addition, many of the drugs that have been used are fraught with significant side effects, 
including worsening of parkinsonian symptoms, and cognitive decline. No drugs are available 
that target the underlying pathogenesis of HD. In this context, a placebo controlled study to investigate laquinimod’s potential benefits in patients with HD is deemed acceptable.  
1.4.1.5. Potential Benefits  
No clinical studies with laquinimod in patients with HD have been performed, and the potential benefits of laquinimod treatment for individual patients participating in this study is not known. The study is designed to investigate potential beneficial effects after treatment with laquinimod 
in patients with HD. The rationale for this is based on the immunomodulatory effects in CNS 
associated with treatment with laquinimod, and reports in scientific literature  that aberrant  
inflammatory phenotypic changes are an intrinsic feature in patients with HD and animal models for HD (see  Section  1.1).  
1.4.1.6. Overall Benefit -Risk Assessment  
An imbalance in serious cardiovascular events in the high- dose treatment arms  (1.2 mg/day and 
1.5 mg/day)  in the Tev a-sponsored CONCERTO and ARPEGGIO studies in MS  was identified  
(6 cases of myocardial infarction in the CONCERTO 1.2  mg treatment arm, compared with  no 
events in the 0.6 mg or placebo treatment arms, along with a cerebral infarction in a 31 -year-old 
man in the 1.2 mg treatment arm. In the ARPEGGIO study, 1  myocardial infarction event was 
identified in the laquinimod 1.5 mg treatment arm. Due to these events, the DMC recommended stopping higher-dose laquinimod treatment (1.2 and 1.5 mg) in the laquinimod MS trials  (see 
Section  1.4.1.2.7). 
No cardiovascular events have been observed to date for any dose in  the LEGATO -HD trial.  
On 07 January 2016, the LEGATO-HD DSMB met and approved the Sponsor's proposal to discontinue the 1.5 mg arm of the study as a proactive safety measure, and approved the 
continuation of the 0.5 mg/day and 1.0 mg/day arms with enhanced monitoring and safety 
precautions.  
Teva notified LEGATO-HD investigators on 10 January 2016 to immediately cont act patients 
randomized to the high dose of 1.5 mg laquinimod and instruct them to discontinue study 
medication as a proactive measure to protect the safety of patients currently participating in the LEGATO -HD study . This action was endorsed by the DSMB  as noted above . Patients in the 1.5 
mg/day (high dose) treatment arm, whose treatment with laquinimod was discontinued, were asked to continue all scheduled visits for safety assessment after study drug discontinuation. 
Appropriate risk mitigation procedures have been implemented via this protocol amendment to 
restrict excess drug exposure due to impairment of liver or kidney function , as well as to assure 
evaluation and management of cardiovascular risk factors.  
LEGATO -HD is the first "proof of concept" study in th e HD  patient population, which 
represen ts a disease with a fatal outcome and a severe unmet medical need  (no current available 
medications). Based on data accumulated to date, t he LEGATO -HD study aims  for disease 
modification beyond symptomatic tre atment . 
Thus, the LEGATO study in the HD patient population represents different benefit/risk 
considerations. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4  Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
47 Based on the above described risks and means for their mitigation, it is judged that potential 
benefit from administration of laquinimod to patients with HD outweighs the risks based on 
currently available information , supporting investigation of its role in the Huntington’s disease 
patient population. 
For an overall risk benefit assessment  of laquinimod treatment in human patients, additional 
information may be found in the current Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.5. Selection of Drugs and Dosages  
The dosages of laquinimod to be evaluated in this double-blind study (i.e. 0.5, 1.0 and 
1.5 mg/day) were selected on the basis of an extensive clinical program eval uating 
pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and efficacy in healthy volunteers, and patients with MS, 
Crohn’s Disease ( CD) and systemic lupus erythematos us (SLE).  
Two studies to evaluate the MTD of laquinimod in healthy volunteers and MS patients have been performed. One early ascending-dose study in healthy volunteers and MS patients (Study 99506202) established the dose of 1.2 mg /day as the MTD in MS patients, based solely on 
laboratory findings that were predefined in the protocol as dose limiting tox icity [increased 
levels of CRP and fibrinogen]. A subsequent ascending dose study in MS patients (Study MS-LAQ -101), in which a safety committee recommended dose escalation following data 
availability for each dosing cohort, did not reproduce study 99506202 results and did not reveal dose-dependent AEs, laboratory or electrocardiography (ECG) findings up to and including the dose of 2.7 mg/day. The sample size, treatment duration (4 weeks) and overall exposure were 
greater in study MS -LAQ -101 compared to Study 99506202, and assessment of tolerability of 
dose was based on a combination of clinical evaluation and laboratory parameters. Hence, the 
sponsor considers study MS- LAQ -101 as more adequately representing the safety profile of 
higher doses of laquinimod. The last cohort of patients received 2.7 mg laquinimod with no dose limiting adverse events (AEs) or laboratory findings (see Section  1.5). The study’s safety 
committee recommended further dose escalation; however the sponsor has instead decided to 
perform dose escalation above 2.7 mg  laquinimod, if needed, under a new, more comprehensive 
protocol. Hence, 2.7 mg /day is the highest multiple dose administered to humans to date. 
Laquinimod 1.5 mg  was selected as th e maximal dose to be tested for the current study based on 
the existing MTD study (up to 2.7 mg ).  
Daily doses of 0.1 mg  and 0.3 mg  were originally assessed in MS patients in a phase II study 
(01506203), which showed that laquinimod 0.3 mg  reduced the cumu lative number of active 
lesions at week 24 while laquinimod 0.1 mg  did not demonstrate an effect. A new phase II study 
(LAQ/5062) assessed the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of 0.3 mg /day and 0.6 mg /day of 
laquinimod in MS patients, and demonstrated a statistically significant effect on the primary endpoint for the laquinimod 0.6 mg  dose. However, in contrast to study 01506203, a significant 
effect on the primary endpoint could not be demonstrated after treatment with laquinimod 
0.3 mg . This discrepancy is considered by the sponsor to be likely explained by methodological 
differences in measuring the MS lesions. None of the studies identified significant safety or tolerability concerns.  
Two Phase III studies with laquinimod 0.6 mg  dose/day have been completed in patients with 
MS (ALLEGRO and BRAVO). Both studies used annualized relapse rate as the primary 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4  Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
48 endpoint. In ALLEGRO, significant effect of laquinimod treatment was shown on the primary 
endpoint and 3 key secondary endpoints. The BRAVO study did not show a statistically 
significant effect on the  primary endpoint, but a post hoc corrected analysis showed that results 
were comparable to those of ALLEGRO. In addition, it was demonstrated that the suggested 
effect of laquinimod on disease progression and brain atrophy is consistent and robust. Both 
studies showed a benign safety profile of laquinimod at the dose tested. 
In light of the dose- dependent clinical effect detailed above and absence of safety concerns in the 
MS-LAQ -101 study, the sponsor has initiated a clinical program in MS patients to investigate 
whether a 1.2 mg  qd dose of laquinimod is associated with greater efficacy while retaining the 
adequate safety and tolerability profile that was evident for the 0.6 mg  qd dose. This program is 
curren tly ongoing.  
The safety and efficacy of laquinimod given 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 mg /day have been investigated 
in 180 patients with CD for 8 weeks (study CD- LAQ-201). Significant effect on the primary 
endpoint (Crohn’s Disease Activity Index) was seen after treatment with laquinimod 0.5  mg/day; 
laquinimod 1 mg  had a lower magnitude effect that was also less robust than the effect of 
laquinimod 0.5 mg . Laquinimod 1.5 mg  and 2.0 mg  did not have an overall clinical effect 
compared to the pooled placebo. However, when evaluating reduction in calprotectin levels, an 
objective marker of disease activity, similar efficacy was observed across the laquinimod doses. Laquinimod showed an overall favorable safety and tolerability profile in this study. Laquinimod is no longer being developed as a treatment for CD.  
The safety and efficacy of laquinimod given 0.5 or 1.0 mg /day have also been investigated in 
two studies in SLE patients [with lupus nephritis (LN -LAQ -201) and with lupus arthritis 
(LA-LAQ -202)] for 24 and 12 wee ks, respectively. In LN -LAQ -201, 46 patients were enrolled: 
15 received placebo, 16 received laquinimod 0.5 mg  and 15 received laquinimod 1 mg . In 
LA-LAQ -202, 82 patients were enrolled: 26 were randomized to receive placebo, and 28 patients 
were randomized  to each of the laquinimod arms (0.5 mg , and 1 mg ). Overall laquinimod was 
safe and well tolerated in these studies. No clinically meaningful effect of laquinimod treatment could be seen in patients with LA. Beneficial effect of laquinimod was seen in pati ents with LN 
with both doses investigated, with the 0.5 mg  dose showing a greater improvement in several 
efficacy variables.  Laquinimod is no longer being developed as a treatment for SLE. 
The described data indicates that 0.6  mg/day is the minimal clinica lly effective dose in MS 
patients, whereas  data from patients with CD and lupus nephritis indicated that also 0.5 mg /day 
is efficacious in treating the inflammatory condition in these diseases. The maximal tolerated dose has not formally been established, but the maximum tested repeated dosing is 2.7 mg /day in 
humans. Data from animal models for CNS inflamma tion, show a clear  dose response of 
laquinimod's inhibition of disease (for additional information, please refer to the IB) . Hence, 
3 doses of laquinimod, ranging from 0.5 mg /day, believed to be a minimal effective dose, to 
1.5 mg /day, providing a reasonable margin to the highest dose tested in humans over a short time 
period, were chosen for investigation. Also, given the available data on the 0.5 and 1.0 mg  doses 
of laquinimod, a parallel (rather than sequential) design was deemed appropriate.  
Note: On 30 December 2015, the DMC for the LAQ- MS-305 (CONCERTO) and TV5600- CNS -
20006 (ARPEGGIO) studies held an unscheduled meeting to review cardiovascular events. The DMC found an imbalance in serious cardiovascular events in the high- dose treatment arms 
(1.2 mg in CONCERTO, 1.5  mg in ARPEGGIO) . Iin CONCERTO there were 6  such cases in 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4  Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
49 the 1.2 mg arm but none in the 0.6 mg or placebo arms, along with a myocardial infarction in the 
ARPEGGIO 1.5 mg dose group and a cerebral infarction in a 31- year-old patient in the 1.2 mg 
arm of CONCERTO. Due to these events and the DMC recommendation to stop all high -dose 
laquinimod treatment arms (1.2 mg/day and 1.5 mg/day)  in the MS trials ; accordingly,  the high-
dose arms were discontinued in both trials as of 01 January 2016. 
On 07 January 2016, the LEGATO -HD DSMB was called urgently by Teva to review and 
discuss new information regarding the occurrence of an imbalance in cardiovascular events from 
the high- dose laquinimod arms in the multiple sclerosis trials CONCERTO and ARPEGGIO 
(1.2 mg in CONCERTO, 1.5  mg in ARPEGGIO).  
The most recent study data for LEGATO-HD were also reviewed in open and closed sessions. No cardiovascular  signal was detected from the LEGATO -HD study as of 10 January 2016. The 
DSMB agreed with the plan to discontinue the 1.5 mg arm of the LEGATO -HD study as a 
proactive safety measure, and  approved the continuation of the 0.5 mg/day and 1.0 mg/day arms 
with en hanced monitoring and safety precautions. Therefore, these treatment arms will be 
continued with updated informed consent and an amended protocol while the sponsor closely 
monitors cardiovascular events in all laquinimod studies for emergence of any potent ial 
cardiovascular  signal . 
A more detailed description of study drug administration is presented in Section 5.1.

50 1.7. Population To Be Studied  
Based on the anticipated mode of action (MoA) of laquinimod in HD, an intervention to reduce 
CNS inflammation as early as possible would be desirable to prevent further neuronal 
dysfunction and death. However, the rate of progression in signs and symptoms makes it difficult to detect slowing of disease in a feasible way in terms of treatment length in patients without 
signs of disease. Therefore, patients with clinical symptoms that are measurable, but with a 
retained functional capacity will b e selected. Further, concomitant medications with 
antipsychotic drugs may confound the data due to side effects in the motor and cognitive domain, 
and thus these drugs will be disallowed in the study. It is also known that cytosine-adenosine-
guanine (CAG) repeat length in the mutant huntingtin gene influence disease progression and 
course. To reduce variability in the study, patients will be selected from a pre- defined range of 
CAG repeat lengths frequently observed in the clinic.
 
Thus, the target patient population will be adult patients, with a CAG repeat length between 36 and 49, and the basic eligibility criteria will select a patient population with symptoms of HD, as 
assessed by a Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale Total Motor Score ( UHDRS -TMS) >5, 
but with a largely retained functional capacity, as assessed with a HDRS -Total Functional 
Capacity  (UHDRS -TFC) score ≥8. This will recruit a symptomatic early HD patient population. 
The criteria for study eligibility  are described in Section  4.1 and  Section  4.2, respectively.  
1.8. Relevant Literature and Data  
Relevant literature is cited above. Further literature and data may be found in the current 
Investigator’s Brochure.

51 2. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  AND STUDY OBJECTIVE S 
2.1. Purpose of the Study   
The purpose of this Phase II clinical stu dy is to investigate the efficacy and safet y of multiple 
doses of laquinimod (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mg /day)  as a potential treatment for patients with 
Huntington 's disease (HD).  
As no drug is currently available to treat HD disease progression, the study will b e placebo 
controlled. 
Prior to 10 January  2016, a total of 400 patients were planned to be equally randomized in a 
1:1:1:1 ratio (100 patients within each treatment arm) to receive laquinimod 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 mg/day, 
or matching placebo for 52 weeks.  
As of 1 0 January 2016, following the decision to discontinue treatment of the laquinimod 1.5 mg 
dose arm, additional eligible patients who are enrolled will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 
receive laquinimod 0.5 mg/day, 1.0 mg/day, or matching placebo for 52 weeks. Approximately 300 patients (100 patients within each study arm), plus the 30 patients who were already randomized to the laquinimod 1.5 mg treatment arm, are planned to be enrolled in the study.  
This is the first clinical study with laquinimod in HD. Therefore, no clinical data on the effects of 
laquinimod in patients with Huntington’s disease is available, and a wide dose range exploration is warranted.  
Clinical data from patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) show a benefit of laquinimod treatment of 0.6 mg /day on brain atrophy and disability progression after 1 year of 
treatment, also in patients without relapses during this period. A disproportionally large effect on 
disability compared to relapses was also observed. The results suggest that in addition to 
peripheral inflammatory modulating effects, laquinimod could also have neuroprotective effects, and a mode of affecting central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory processes beyond the 
classical MS dogma of active T -cell driven lesions. This is important in Huntington’s disease 
where intrinsic CNS inflammatory phenotypes are observed to correlate with disease 
progression. 
The study aims to detect potential beneficial effects in deteriorating clinical signs and symptoms 
of HD. Bas ed on previous studies in patients with HD, the UHDRS-TMS has been shown to be 
one of the more sensitive clinical measures to detect decline in symptoms of HD, and hence TMS has been chosen as primary endpoint. 
2.2. Study Objectives   
2.2.1. Primary Study Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of laquinimod 0.5 and 1.0 mg  qd in

Due to the decision from 10 J anuary  2016 to discontinue treatment of the laquinimod 1.5 mg 
dose arm, and the low number of enrolled patients  compared to the target
 at this time, data from

54 3. STUDY DESIGN 
3.1. General Design and Study Schema   
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of laquinimod treatment at dosages of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mg /day in 
adults with Huntington’s Disease.  
The study will consist of a screening period (2 weeks up to 5 weeks ), followed by a 52- week 
double-blind treatment period and a follow -up visit (one month after end of treatment ). Prior to 
10 January  2016, a total of 400 patients were planned to be equally randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio 
(100 patients within each treatment arm) to receive laquinimod 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 mg /day, or matching 
placebo for 52 weeks. A total of 123 patients were randomized prior to  10 January 2016. 
As of 10 January 2016, following the decision to discontinue treatment of the laquinimod 1.5 mg 
dose arm, additional eligible patients who are enrolled will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 
receive laquinimod 0.5 mg/day, 1.0 mg/day, or matching placebo for 52 weeks. Approximately 300 patients (100 patients within each study arm), plus the 30 patients who  were already 
randomized to the laquinimod 1.5 mg treatment arm, are planned to be enrolled in the study. 
After signing the informed consent, including consent to provide a blood sample for genetic 
analyses including CAG repeat length analysis, patients will be screened for a period of 2 weeks  
up to 5 weeks  in order to determine whether they are eligible to participate in the study. Patients 
with a legal guardian should be consented according to local requirements. 
The procedures and assessments performed during each of the study visits are detailed in 
Section  3.11.  
During the visits, vital sign measurements, physical examinations and ECG should preferably be performed prior to the blood draw for clinical laboratory tests and pharmacokinetic sampling. Further, the efficacy asse ssment s (TMS, HD- CAB, CIBIC-plus and TFC) should be done prior to 
the exploratory assessments.  
Patients who complete all scheduled visits will have final procedures and assessments performed at the final visit (Visit 8, Month 12). Patients who withdraw from the study before completing 
the 52-week evaluation period will have Visit 8 procedures and assessments performed at their 
last visit.  
An independent DSMB will oversee the study. The DSMB will review unblinded accumulating 
safety data on a regular basis  to ensure the continuing safety of the study patients and study 
conduct issues. 
The study schema is presented in Figure  1 (prior to 10 January  2016) and in Figure  2 (from 10  
January 2016) .

58 3.2.4. Safety Measures and Endpoints  
The safety of laquinim od will be assessed throughout the study by evaluating adverse events, 
clinical laboratory test results, vital signs measurements, electrocardiography (ECG), physical 
examination results, and suicidality (as assessed by changes from baseline in C -SSRS scor es).  
3.2.5. Tolerability Measures and Endpoints  
Tolerability variables and endpoints will include the following:  
• Proportion of subjects (%) who prematurely discontinued from the study, reason of 
discontinuation and the time to ET 
• Proportion of subjects (%) who prematurely discontinued from the study due to AEs 
and the time to ET   
3.2.6. Pharmacokinetic Measures and Endpoints   
3.2.6.1. Pharmacokinetics (PK) Ancillary Study  
 
PK samples of laquinimod and its metabolites will be collected from approximately 15 patients per each of t he three continuing treatment groups (at selected sites at Month 1), for a total of 
approximately 45 patients. Additionally, PK samples were collected from 2 patients in the laquinimod 1.5 mg/day treatment group when the treatment was stopped; no further P K samples 
will be collected from the laquinimod 1.5 mg/day treat ment group.  
The time of the previous dose as well as deviations from the blood sampling times will be 
recorded in the appropriate eCRF. Patients performing the 24- hour PK profile will come to the 
clinic after an overnight fast (minimum of 8 hours) and will be given breakfast 4 hours after drug 
administration.  
Samples will be collected at pre -dose, 15, 30 min and 1, 2, 3, 6 and 24 hours post dose.  
Steady state pharmacokinetic parameters for laq uinimod (AUC
tau, Cmax and C min, tmax), will be 
calculated for each patient.  Additional parameters for laquinimod and pharmacokinetic 
parameters for its metabolites may be calculated if data permit.  
For patients participating in this ancillary study, the mo rning dose and the 24 hours dose 
administration (the day after) will take place at the clinic.  
3.2.6.2. Population PK (PPK) Study  
A single blood sample will be collected from all patients at Months 1, 3, 6 and 12 for evaluation of laquinimod and its metabolites.  
Pharmacokinetics of laquinimod will be evaluated using a Population PK approach. The effect of 
covariates on the PK of laquinimod will be evaluated. Possible covariates will include demographic variables (e.g., age, gender, body weight and ethnicity), clinic al variables ( e.g. 
CAG repeat length), concomitant medications, blood and urine chemistry variables and markers 
of renal (creatinine clearance and serum creatinine) or hepatic function.Pharmacokinetic 
parameters for laquinimod metabolites may be calculated  if data permit.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 04 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
59 The date and time of the blood sample, as well as the date and time of the last study drug dose 
prior to the sample will be recorded on the eCRF. 
The PPK model may also include any unscheduled pharmacokinetic samples collected to assist 
with further investigations of cardiovascular events or other clinical event of interest for safety  
(see Section  8.1).  
3.2.7. Pharmacodynamic Measures and Endpoints  
Biomarker assessment will include the following:  
• Cytok ines, Soluble protein (or any other soluble marker) levels will be determined at 
baseline, Months 6 and 12.  
• Monocyte gene expression and/or protein profile will be explored at baseline and 
Month 12. This study will be performed only at selected sites in a subgroup of patients.  
• PET scans and imaging analysis of microglial activation marker TSPO will be performed at baseline and Month 12. This study will be performed only in a subgroup 
of patients. 
• MRI scans for MRS to explore the potential effect on metabol ic changes in the 
putamen and frontal white matter will be done in a subgroup of patients at baseline and Month 12. 
3.2.8.  Pharmacogenomic Measures and Endpoints  
Pharmacogenomic (PGx) assessment will include CAG repeats analysis in the h untingtin gene 
and might include other DNA variations and RNA expression patterns potentially associated 
with clinical treatment responses to laquinimod (e.g. clinical effect, pharmacokinetics, 
tolerability, and safety features or disease susceptibility and severity features). The final list of genes that might be investigated will be selected in a later stage before the analysis so as to allow 
updating with new scientific information. Genomic analysis could also include a sequencing of 
the whole genome if required. 
The CAG repeat length in the huntingtin gene will be established by a central laboratory for all 
patients, as part of the screening process to determine eligibility for the study. This will be done 
also for patients where a historical CAG repeat length result is availabl e. If during this screening 
process a CAG repeat length result that differs from the patient ’s historical result is obtained, the 
central laboratory results should be used for determining eligibility. The exact CAG repeat length will not be available to th e sites, only to the Sponsor. The central laboratory report will only note 
if the patient is within the eligibility criteria range (36 -49 inclusive) or not. This will be explicitly 
explained and noted in the ICF of the patient. In either case, the investigator should review the CAG repeat results with the patient at the baseline visit, or at an unscheduled visit if a baseline visit will not take place.   
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 04 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
60 3.3. Randomization and Blinding   
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Prior to 10 January  2016, eligible 
patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment with laquinimod at a dosage of 0.5, 1.0 or 
1.5 mg qd or a matching placebo in a 1:1:1:1  ratio.  
As of 10 January 2016, following a decision to discontinue treatment of the laquinimod 1.5 mg 
dose arm, future eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive laquinimod 0.5 
mg/day  or 1.0 mg/day or matching placebo for 52 weeks. No change was performed to the 
original randomization list except that the patient numbers assigned to laquinimod 1.5 mg/day were removed from the list by the interactive response technology (IRT)  vendor.  
All patients who  discontinued the 1.5 mg/day dose have been unblinded. No attempts will be 
made to re-randomize patients whose 1.5 mg treatment was stopped to a lower dose of 
laquinimod. The remaining ongoing patients retained their originally randomized treatment assignments.  
Patients and investigators will remain blinded to treatment assignment during the study.  
The randomization code will be generated by the Clinical Supply Chain (CSC) department following specifications from the Biostatistics Department.  
In addition, the sponsor’s clinical personnel involved in the study will be blinded to the study 
drug identity until the database is locked for analysis and the treatment assignment revealed. 
However, in case a prioritized sample analysis is needed, bioanalytical personnel may not be blinded. A statistician not assigned to the study will be responsible for reviewing the 
randomization code, and the final randomization code will be maintained by the CSC 
department.  
Patients will be randomly assigned to treatment through a qualified randomization service 
provider ( e.g., IRT). This system is used to ensure a balance across treatment groups.  
3.4. Study Dru gs and Dosage   
Patients will be randomized to receive laquinimod 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 mg  qd or matching placebo 
(prior to 10 January 2016), or randomly assigned to receive treatment with laquinimod at a 
dosage of 0.5 mg/day, 1.0 mg/day or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio (from 10  January  2016) . Every 
patient will take 3 capsules once daily, at the same time of the day, during the entire study 
period. Study drug will be administered as described in Section  3.4.1 and Section  3.4.2 below. 
The capsules will be taken orally and must be swallowed whole with a glass of water. The capsule should not be opened. Laquinimod can be taken with or without food. 
3.4.1. Investigational Product and Dosage 
Laquinimod will be provided as off-white, opaque, hard gelatin capsules. The capsules should be 
swallowed whole with water.   
• Patients randomized to the laquinimod 1.5 mg  qd treatment arm received 3 capsules 
of 0.5 mg  laquinimod ( Note: 
The treatment of this high dose  arm was discontinued as of 
10 January 2016). 
• Patients randomized to the laquinimod 1.0 mg  qd treatment arm will receive 2 
capsules of 0.5 mg  laquinimod and 1 capsule of matching placebo. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 04 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
61 • Patients randomized to the laquinimod 0.5 mg  qd treatment arm will receive 1 capsule 
of 0.5 mg  laquinimod and 2 capsules of matching placebo. 
A more detailed description of administration procedures is given in Section 5.1.  
3.4.2. Other Study Drugs and Dosage - Placebo  
Matchin g placebo for laquinimod capsules will be provided as off -white opaque, hard gelatin 
capsules . Patients randomized to the placebo treatment arm will receive 3 capsules of matching 
placebo capsules.  
A more detailed description of administration procedures i s given in Section  5.1.  
3.5. Duration of Patient Participation   
Subjects are expected to participate in this study for approximately 14 months, consisting of a 
screening period of 2 weeks up to 5 weeks , a double- blind treatment period of 12 months and a 1 
month follow-up period.  
3.6. Stopping Rules and Discontinuation Criteria  
Safety stopping rules are detailed in  Appendix A  (Guidance on Safety Monitoring).  
These include:  
• Elevated liver enzymes (as detailed in  Appendix A ) 
• Pregnancy  
• Need for concomitant treatment with moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
• Patients that are diagnosed with a malignant solid or liquid tumor  while participating in 
the study  
• Acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction or any major cardiovascular event  
Female subjects  will be reminded to continue using 2 methods of acceptable contraception 
throughout treatment duration, and up to 30 days from the date from the last dose of the study 
drug, and about the need to stop treatment immediately if pregnancy is suspected. During the 
conduct of the study, serious adverse events will be reviewed (see Section 7.1.5) as they are 
reported from the investigational center  to identify safety concerns. The study may be terminated 
by the sponsor at any time. 
A patient may discontinue participation in the study at any time for any reason (e.g., lack of 
efficacy, consent withdrawn, an d adverse event). The investigator and/or sponsor can withdraw a 
patient from the study at any time for any reason (e.g., protocol violation or deviation as defined in Section  11.1.1, noncompliance, adverse event ). 
Liver Impairment  
To avoid exposures to higher levels of laquinimod (see Section  1.3.2.1), a stopping rule related 
to liver impairment has been introduced. Patients who develop any chronic liver disease associated with hepatic function impairment while participating in the study should stop study medication.  
Renal Impairment  
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 04 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
62 To avoid exposures to higher levels of laquinimod (see Section 1.3.2.1), a stopping rule related 
to renal impairment has been introduced. Patients who develop chronic renal disease associated 
with moderate or severe functional impairment, defined as estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl)  
<60 mL/min/1.73 m2, while participating in the study should stop study medication temporarily , 
and the assessment of estimated CrCl should be repeated. If the development of renal impairment is confirmed ( estimated CrCl <60 mL/min/1.73 m
2), the patient should stop study medication 
permanently.  
3.6.1. Temporary Discontinuatio n of Study Drug Treatment  
Temporary discontinuation is defined as missing of more than 3 consecutive doses of the study drug. Skipping 14 or more consecutive doses of study drug will be considered a major protocol violation. 
The reasons for temporary study drug discontinuation should be recorded in the appropriate 
section of the study drug dispensing and compliance log in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) .  
The subject will report any temporary discontinuation to the investigator and will be instructed  
by the investigator regarding continuation of treatment. 
3.6.2. Early Termination (ET) 
An ET visit should be completed for all patients who prematurely terminate treatment or who 
become pregnant (see Section  3.11.4 for details of procedures). 
Early termination r efers to the study drug termination and not termination of the patient from the 
study. Patients will be asked to continue all scheduled visits and safety asessements after study 
drug discontinuation (with the exception of drug dispensing and accountability, pregnancy 
testing, and pharmacokinetic sampling). 
Patients in the 1.5 mg/day (high dose) treatment arm, whose treatment with laquinimod was 
discontinued, were invited to attend an early termination  visit (to return study medication and 
perform drug accou ntability). At this visit, only safety assessments were to be completed . These 
included vital signs, clinical laboratory tests , pregnancy test, adverse event inquiry, drug 
accountability , review of concomitant medication, and C- SSRS (see also Section  3.11.3.1.5). 
Patients  were asked  to continue scheduled follow up safety visits per the current schedule.  
Women of child bearing potential should continue using 2 acceptable contraception methods up 
to 30 days after the last dose of study medication  has been  administered.  
Moderate/strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are disallowed during the 30 days after the last laquinimod dose has been administered (see Appendix B ).  
Plasma levels of drugs that are CYP1A2 substrates may decrease when combined with laquinimod and within 30 days after the last laquinimod dose, rendering these drugs less effective (see Appendix C ). 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 04 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
63 3.7. Study Drug Supply and Accounta bility   
3.7.1. Study Drug Storage and Security  
Laquinimod and matching placebo capsules must be stored at room temperature (15-25°C), in a 
dry place, and in a securely locked, substantially constructed cabinet or enclosure. Only 
authorized personnel will have acc ess to the study drug. The study site personnel at each site will 
be responsible for correct storage and handling of the study drug. Maintenance of a temperature 
log (manual or automated) is required and should be available for review by the monitor for th e 
duration of the study. The temperature shall be recorded daily and the max/min thermometer 
reset after each reading. Complete instructions on receipt, storage, and handling of study drugs will be detailed in the Pharmacy M anual . 
3.7.2. Study Drug Accountability   
Each study drug shipment will include a packing slip, listing the contents of the shipment and any applicable forms.  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that deliveries of study drug and other study materials from the sponsor are correctly recei ved and recorded, handled and stored safely and 
properly in accordance with the local regulations, and used in accordance with this protocol. Study drugs accountability records must be maintained at the site at all times.  
During the study, all used and unused study drugs and the corresponding accountability forms 
must be returned by the monitor to the sponsor or sponsor’s designee on an on- going basis for 
reconciliation and destruction , with account given for any discrepancies . A photocopy of these 
records  must be kept at the study sites.  
The accountability of the returned study drugs should be performed and recorded by the 
sponsor’s assigned monitor. The Subject Number, the date, batch code/batch number, pack 
number and quantity of study drugs returned by the subject will be checked for correctness and recorded on the appropriate accountability forms, to be provided by the sponsor.  
The monitor will use the IRT to record the returns. 
3.8. Maintenance of Randomization and Blinding  
The randomization code will be maintained by the CSC department. At the time of analysis, 
when treatment codes are revealed, the CSC department will provide the randomization code to 
the statistician assigned to this study.  
Staff responsible for bioanalysis and pharmacokinetic data analysis will not have access to any 
clinical data and will provide concentration data to other staff members in a blinded manner (i.e., 
a dummy subject identifier will be linked to an individual subject’ s concentration data).  
For information about personnel w ho may be aware of treatment assignments, see Section  3.3. 
These individuals will not be involved in conduct of any study procedures or assessment of any adverse events.  
For a serious adverse event considered rel ated and unexpected (ie, reasonable possibility; see 
Section  7.1.4) to the study drug, the sponsor’ s Global Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 04 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
64 Department may independently request that the treatment code be revealed (on a case- by-case 
basis). If this occurs, the investigator will remain blinded to treatment.  
In case of a serious adverse event, pregnancy, or in cases when knowledge of the study drug 
assignment is needed to make treatment decisions, the investigato r may unblind the patient’s 
drug assignment as deemed necessary, mainly in emergency situations. Individual treatment codes, indicating the treatment randomization for each randomized patient, will be available to the investigator(s) and/ or pharmacist (s) at the study center via the IRT , both via telephone and  
internet .  
If possible, the sponsor should be notified of the event prior to breaking of the code. If this is not possible, the sponsor should be notified immediately afterwards, and the patient’s drug code assignment should not be revealed. Breaking of the treatment code can always be performed by the site without prior approval by the sponsor. 
The circumstances leading to the breaking of the code should be fully documented, in the 
investigator’s study  files and in the patient’s source documentation. Treatment assignment 
should not be recorded in any study documents or source document. 
In blinded studies, for adverse events that are defined as: Suspected, Unexpected, Serious, 
Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) (i e, reasonable possibility; see Section  7.1.4), Global Patient Safety 
and Pharmacovigilance may  independently request that the treatment code be revealed (on a 
case- by-case basis) to comply with regulatory requirements.  If this occurs, the investigator will 
remain blinded to treatment.  
As of 10 January 2016, treatment with laquinimod was discontinued for all patients in the 1.5 mg dose group; all these discontinued patients have been unblinded. No attempts will be made to re-randomize patients whose 1.5 mg treatment was stopped to a lower dose of laquinimod.  
However, the blinding was maintained for the patients in the remaining ongoing 3 treatment 
arms (0.5 mg/day, 1.0 mg/day , and placebo). 
3.9. Source Data Recorded on the Case Report Form   
All patient data must have supportive original source documentation in the medical records, or 
equivalent, before they are transcribed onto the CRF. Data may not be recorded directly onto the 
CRF and will not be considered as source d ata unless the study center obtains written 
documentation from the sponsor , prior to the beginning of the study, indicating which data are 
permitted to be recorded directly on to the CRF.  
Source data, including test results and/or assessments ( e.g., clini cal laboratory test results, ECG 
data, diary data, safety and efficacy measurements) collected by institutions outside of the study 
center are sent to the study center, where they are retained but not entered into the CRF. These 
results may be sent directl y to the sponsor for entry i nto the clinical database (see S ection  13.1).  
The CRFs are filed in the sponsor’s central file.  
3.10. Time Schedule   
The study start ed in Q4 2014 (first patient randomized) and is expected to be completed in Q1 
2018 (last patient last visit).  
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 04 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
65 As of 10 January 2016, treatment with laquinimod was discontinued for all patients in the 1.5 
mg/day dose arm.  
Approximately 300 patients (100 patients within each study arm), plus the 30 patients who were already randomized to the laquinimod 1.5 mg dose arm,  from ~ 51 investigational center s in 
North America , Europe and Russia are planned to be enrolled in the study.

Concomitant Medication Inquiry   Concomitant medication will be monitored throughout the treatment and follow -up periods.  
Adverse events inquiry   Adverse events will be monitored throughout the treatment and follow -up periods.  
a For patients in the high dose group (1.5 mg/day) who were discontinued, only safety and no efficacy assessments had to be performed at the Early  Termination 
visit. The patients will be asked to continue all scheduled visits for safety assessment only after study drug discontnuation . 
b Patients with a legal guardian should be consented according to local requirements.  
c Inclusion/exclusion criteria should be met at screening and reviewed at baseline (Visit 2) before the patient is randomized.  
d Including smoking history. In addition, an evaluation of cardiovascular risk factors should take place as soon as possible for patients already in the study, 
following approval of Global Amendment 04.  
e Assessment of changes in cardiovascular risk and appropriate cardiovascular risk management with appropriate medical follow -up, if clinically indicated, 
should be performed during the scheduled and unscheduled visits.  
f When applicable, patients will be screened for drug substances in urine and/or CDT level in blood at screening to confirm abstinence in former (more than 12 
months from screening) alcohol and/or drug abusers.  
g For visits 2 through 9,  Patients must have fasted no less than 8 hours prior to the blood draw.  
h When applicable per local requirements, patients will undergo an HIV test at screening.  
i Unscheduled urgent safety laboratory samples, pharmacokinetic blood samples, and/or samples for potential biomarker analysis  may be collected at the 
discretion of the investigator or medical monitor at any time to assist with further investigations of cardiovascular events or other clinical event of interest. The samples should be collected as soon as possible in association wi th the event.  
j Anemia panel includes B12, blood smear, serum iron, ferritin, total iron binding capacity, folic acid, haptoglobin, IL -1, IL- 6, IFN -γ, TNF -α, and hepcidin. 
Assessed at baseline and also at 1 subsequent time point with B12 if hemoglobin decrease of >1 g/dL  from the patient’s hemoglobin level at baseline and the 
decrease is confirmed.  
k Only at selected sites in a subgroup of patients  
l Blood sample for monocyte collection and analysis has to be done in accordance with the laboratory manual.  For UK patients, the sample can be drawn prior to 
the baseline or Month 12 visit, as it coincides with the PET scan visits  
m Height will be assessed during the physical exam at screening (Visit 1)  
n ECG will be performed in triplicate at baseline (approximately 10± 5 minutes apart ). All other visits will have a single ECG performed.  
o At the screening visit, only ser um β -HCG test will be performed. For the baseline visit - urine pregnancy test (beta human chorionic gonadotropin [β -hCG]) 
result is required for women of child -bearing potential prior to randomization. The urine test should be conducted at the site to allow randomization. A serum β -
HCG test should also be used to confirm the urine test; however, the randomization should be performed based on the results of the urine pregnancy test.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
70 p An addition al urine β -HCG test will be performed at the PET facilities at Imperial College in London at the Baseline visit and at Visit 8 for women  of child -
bearing potential participating in the PET substudy. Its result will be available on site prior to any procedures involving ionizing radiation and will be 
considered accordingly.  
q If anxiolysis i s required in order to perform the MRI scan, the scan should be performed at the end of the study visit day.  
r The baseline MRI can be performed at the screening visit, but no later than 7 days prior to baseline. If performed at the scr eening visit, as many screening 
assessements as possible should be c onducted prior to the MRI scan in order to assess eligibility .  
s If a patient terminates within 3 months of the baseline visit, they will not undergo an Early Termination scan. If a patient term inates prior to Month 12, the 
Early termination scans should be performed as soon as possible, but not more than 7 days after discontinuation of study drug. Month 12 scans should be performed 7 days prior to the Termination Visit. The early termination MRI  scan was not to be done for the patients in the discontinued 1.5 mg/day treatment 
arm .  
t Estimated creatinine clearance will be calculated at all in clinic study visits. Patients who develop chronic renal disease associated with moderate or severe 
functional impairment, defined as estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, while participating in the study should stop study medication 
temporarily and the creatinine clearance assessment should be repeated. If the renal impairment is confirmed (estimated CrCl <60 mL/min/1.73 m2), the patient 
should stop study medication permanently.  
u The PET scan can be done at any time prior to the date of the baseline visit, after eligibility of the patient has been confirmed. It can also be done 2 to 5 weeks 
prior to the Month 12 visit.  
v Patients taking benzodiazepines should be instructed  to stop taking them for 3 days prior to having the PET scan.  
w UHDRS -TMS>5 and UHDRS -TFC≥8 are required for study eligibility  
x Where possible, the same person should act as a patient’s caregiver/informant throughout the study. If this is not possible, a patient should have no more than 2 
caregivers throughout the study. All possible attempts should be made to assure that c aregiver will attend the clinical visits in person together with the patient. 
If the caregiver/informant is not available to attend the clinic visit, the interview can be done over phone.  
y HD-Q oL will be assessed by both caregiver/informant and patient. All possible attempts should be made to assure that caregiver/in formant will attend the 
clinical visits in person together with the patient. If the caregiver/informant is not available to attend the clinic visit, the caregiver/informant form should be omitted.  
z The WLQ/EQ -5D-5L could be completed by the patients with caregiver/informant assistance if needed.

71 3.11.1. Procedures for Screening and Enrollment (Visit 1)   
A signed and dated informed consent form will be obtained before screening procedures 
commence. Evaluations obtained as part of routine medical care and performed during the 
screening period may be used in place of the protocol- specific evaluations. Patients will 
acknowledge and agree to the possible use of this information for the study by giving informed consent. Pa tients with a legal guardian should be consented according to local requirements. 
After informed consent is obtained, patients who are screened will be assigned an 8- digit 
permanent identification number such that all patients from each investigational center  are given 
consecutive identification numbers in successive order of inclusion. The first 2 digits of the screening number will be the number assigned to the country where the investigational center is located, the next 3  digits will be the designated investigator center number, and the last 3 digits 
will be assigned at the investigator center ( e.g., if the number assigned to the country is 01, the 
3
rd patient screened at center  5 would be given the number of 01005003). 
For patients for whom a unique HD- ID number is available, this identification number will be 
collected in the CRF.  
The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) will also be administered at screening as part of a panel of demographic measures including date of birth and gender. The 
ISCED is a scale that ranges from 0 to 8 (pre-primary school to doctoral level) that is used to establish education level equivalence across different countries/educational systems. Education levels are determined by using informal questioning of the patient, and then scores on the 0-6 
scale are assigned using country -specific tables that establish international education level 
equivalence ( UNESCO, 2012).  
A patient who is screened but not randomized, e.g., because entry c riteria were not met or 
enrollment did not occur within the specified time, may be considered for screening again if, e.g. , 
there is a change in the patient’s medical background or a modification of study entry criteria.  
Re-screening will be permitted on a case by case basis. A new informed consent form should be 
signed in any case of re -screening. A new Subject Number will be assigned to the subject.  
The screening visit (Visit 1) will take place up to 5 weeks before the baseline visit. The 
following procedures will be performed at V isit 1: 
• obtain written informed consent before any other study- related procedures are 
performed  
• review inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• review medical and psychiatric history /demographics   
• evaluation and management of major modifia ble cardiac risk factors (eg, diabetes,

78 Moderate/strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are disallowed during the 30 days after the last laquinimod  
dose has been administered  (see Appendix B ).  
Plasma levels of drugs that are CYP1A2 substrates may decrease when combined with 
laquinimod and within 30 days after the last laquinimod dose, rendering these drugs less effective ( see Appendix C ).  
Early termination refers to the study drug termination and not termination of the patient from the 
study. Patients in the 1.5 mg/day (high dose) treatment arm, whose treatment with laquinimod was discontinued, were invited to at tend an early termination  safety visit to return study 
medication and perform drug accountability. At this visit, only safety assessments (vital signs , 
clinical laboratory tests , pregnancy test, adverse event inquiry, drug accountability , review of 
concomitant medication, and C- SSRS) were to be conducted (see Section  3.6.2)
, and none of the 
efficacy assessments. Patients were asked  to continue all scheduled visits for safety assessment 
after study drug discontinua tion. 
Patients in the high dose group (1.5mg/day) who were requested to discontinue study drug before 
week 52 , but who continue to attend scheduled study visits for safety assessment, are not 
considered to have completed the study.

In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (in accordance with the applicable country’s 
acceptance), each patient is free to withdraw from the study at any time. The investigator also 
has the right to withdraw a patient from the study in the event of intercurrent illness, adverse 
events, pregnancy (see Section  7.3.3), or other reasons concerning the health or well-being of the 
patient, or in the event  of lack of cooperation. In addition, a patient may be withdrawn from the 
study as described in Sections 3.6, 3.8, 3.11.4, 5.4, and 7.1.7.  
Specific safety reasons for withdrawing a patient from the study are described in detail in  
Appendix A  and Section  3.6. Th ese include:  
• Elevated liver enzymes (as detailed in  Appendix A )  
• Pregnancy  
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease

83 • Need for concomitant treatment with moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
• Patients that are diagnosed with  a malignant solid or liquid tu mor 
• Acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction or any major cardiovascular event  
 
Should a patient decide to withdraw after administration of study drug(s), or should the 
investigator decide to withdraw the patient, all efforts will be made to complete  and report all 
observations up to the time of withdrawal. A complete final evaluation at the time of the patient’s withdrawal (including all Visit 8 procedures) should be made and an explanation given as to why the patient is withdrawing or being withdraw n from the study. 
The reason for and date of withdrawal from the study must be recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF. If a patient withdraws consent, every attempt will be made to determine the reason. If the reason for withdraw al is an adverse event or a clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory test result, monitoring will be continued at the discretion of the investigator ( e.g., until the event has resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care 
of a health care professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug or 
study procedure is made). The specific event or test result(s) must be recorded on the source 
documentation and transcribed onto the CRF.  
All evaluations should be performed according to the protocol on the last day the patient takes 
study drug, or as soon as possible thereafter. If it is not possible to schedule the ET visit within 2 
weeks after end of treatment, only the safety evaluations for that visit need to be performed.  
For patients in the 1.5 mg arm who were withdrawn from study treatment, the reason will be 
recorded as ‘sponsor requested patient to be withdrawn’.

84 5. TREATMENT OF PATIENTS 
5.1. Study Drugs Administered   
Until 10  January 2016, at the baseline visit, patien ts were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 
1 of 3 laquinimod treatment groups or to the placebo treatment group. Three capsules will be 
administered orally once each day, at the same time of the day, as follows:  
• Oral laquinimod 0.5 mg : 3 capsules, 1 c ontaining 0.5 mg  laquinimod and 2 capsules 
containing matching placebo, to be administered orally qd.  
• Oral laquinimod 1.0 mg : 3 capsules, 2 containing 0.5 mg  laquinimod and 1 capsule 
containing matching placebo, to be administered orally qd.  
• Oral laquinimod 1.5 mg : 3 capsules containing 0.5 mg  laquinimod (Note: T he treatment 
of this high dose arm was discontinued as of 10 January 2016) 
• Matching placebo: 3 capsules, containing 0.5 mg  matching placebo, to be administered 
orally qd. 
As of 10 January 2016, following the decision to discontinue treatment of  the laquinimod 1.5 mg 
dose arm, additional eligible patients who are enrolled will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive laquinimod 0.5 mg/day, 1.0 mg/day, or matching placebo for 52 weeks. 
The capsules will be taken orally and must be swallowed whole with a glass of water. The 
capsule should not be opened. Laquinimod can be taken with or without food. 
The time of the dosing will be recorded on the CRF. 
Compliance to study drug administration will be monitored. See Section  5.4 for additional 
information. 
Study drug will be packaged in bottles and provided for patients to take at home (see 
Section  3.4). Study drug exposure will be measured and compliance to study drug administration 
will be monitored.  
5.2. Restrictions   
There are no restrictions in this study. 
However, regarding fasting prior to in- clinic visits that will require fasting blood draws: 
For visits 2 through 9,  patients must have fasted (no food or beverages) no less than 8 hours prior 
to each morning visit that will require fasting blood draws  (i.e. a blood draw for the lipid profile, 
or for the safety laboratory panels which include clinical chemistries and hormone 
concentrations). 
Patients will be permitted to have water up until 1 hour before blood draws. 
For patients participating in the PK -profiling ancillary study, the fasting conditions will be held 
up to 4 hours after the dosing. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
85 5.3. Prior and Concomitant Therap y or Medication   
Any prior or concomitant therapy, medication, or procedure  a patient has had within 3 months 
before study drug administration and up to the end of the study period, including follow-up, will 
be recorded on the CRF. Generic or trade name, i ndication, and dosage will be recorded. The 
sponsor will encode all therapy and medication according to the World Health Organization (WHO) drug dictionary (WHO Drug).  
At each clinic visit after the screening visit, the investigator will ask patients wheth er they have 
taken any medications (other than study drug), including over-the-counter (OTC) medications, 
vitamins, or herbal or nutritional supplements, since the previous visit. Indication, dosage, and 
start and end dates should be entered on the CRF. 
5.3.1. Disallowed Previous Medications/Therapies Prior to and During the Study  
The following medications will not be allowed prior to and during this study: 
• Use of tetrabenazine wit hin 30 days prior to baseline and during the study; 
• Use of antipsychotic medication wit hin 30 days prior to baseline and during the 
study;  
• Use of moderate/strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as erythromycin and 
ketoconazole (more examples listed in  Appendix B ), within 2 weeks prior to 
randomizatio n, during the study and until 30 days after the last study dose has been 
administered.  Laquinimod is extensively metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4, 
and ketoconazole and fluconazole, strong and moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, were found to inhibit the metabolism, leading to 2.5- and 3.1-fold increases in laquinimod exposure, respectively.  
• Use of inducers of CYP3A4 within 2 weeks prior to randomization and during the 
study;   
• Immunosuppressive or immunomodulating agents, or cytotoxic agents, including 
cyclophosphamide and azathioprine within 12 months prior to screening and during 
the study; 
• Use of experimental or investigational drugs and/or participation in drug clinical 
studies within 30 days of screening  and during the study. 
For patients taking antidepressant medication, the dose has to be kept constant for at least 
30 days prior to randomization and during the whole study period. 
Appendix B  provides a list of medications disallowed prior to and during the study. 
Patients who for their safety and well -being, according to the treating physician, are in need of 
antipsychotic medication or changed dose of antidepressant medication during the study, will be 
allowed to continue in the study, and the change in concomita nt medication will be recorded in 
the CRF.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
86 5.3.2.  Other Concomitant Medications/Therapies  
Studies have shown that laquinimod is a strong inducer of CYP1A2 and a weak inhibitor of 
CYP3A4. Therefore, co- administration of laquinimod may affect the systemic exposure  of drugs 
metab olized by CYP450 1A2 or CYP3A4. 
5.3.2.1. CYP1A2  
Laquinimod 0.6 mg/day reduced the systemic exposure of caffeine (a compound mainly metabolized by CYP1A2) 5-fold. Laquinimod doses higher than 0.6 mg/day may further increase 
CYP1A2 induction and decrease exposure of CYP1A2 substrates.  
Plasma levels of drugs that are CYP1A2 substrates may decrease when combined with 
laquinimod. Also, during a period of 30 days following the last laquinimod dose these CYP1A2 
substrates are potentially less effective due to decreased plasma levels.  
Table 7 ( Appendix C ) presents a partial list of drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP1A2, 
i.e. CYP1A2 plays a major role in their biotransformation. The systemic exposure of these drugs 
is expected to be significantly reduced by laquinimod co- administration. Drugs that are mainly 
metabolized by CYP1A2 and have a narrow therapeutic index are of special concern and appear in bolded text.  
In general, as a precautionary measure, it is recommended to avoid the use of CYP1A2 
substrates in clinical trials of laquinimod. Therapeutic alternatives may be considered in the appropriate clinical context.  
5.3.2.2. CYP3A4  
Laquinimod 0.6 mg/day increases the systemic exposure of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) 1.5-fold and for the 1.2 mg/day dose 1.7 fold. Therefore, plasma levels of drugs that 
are CYP3A4 substrates may increase when combined with laquinimod. Patients taking drugs that 
are metabolized by CYP3A 4, specifically those with a Narrow Therapeutic Index ( Table 6, 
Appendix C ) should be advised that plasma levels of these drugs could increase when combined 
with laquinimo d.  
5.4. Procedures for Monitoring Patient Compliance   
Each investigator will be responsible for monitoring patient compliance. A check of study drug compliance will be performed during each visit after the initial dispensation of study drug, and 
study drug accountability records will be completed. If the investigator or the sponsor determines 
that the patient is not in compliance with the study protocol, the investigator and the sponsor should determine whether the patient should be withdrawn. The IEC/IRB should be notified. 
5.5. Total Blood Volume   
The total amount of blood to be drawn throughout the entire study for serum chemistry, 
hematology, pharmacokinetic, biomarker and pharmacogenomic measurements is approximately 
350 mL /patient.  
Patients who will participate in the PK profiling ancillary study will have approximately 32  mL 
extra blood drawn throughout the study.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
87 Patients who will participate in the monocyte ancillary study will have approximately 50  mL 
extra blood drawn throughout the entire study.

88 6. ASSESSM ENT OF EFFICACY  
6.1. Primary Efficacy Variables  
The primary efficacy variable and endpoint for this study is the change from baseline in the 
UHDRS -TMS (defined as the sum of the scores of all UHDRS-TMS subitems) at Month 12/ ET 
(evaluated at baseline and Mont hs 1, 3, 6 and 12). 
The TMS component of UHDRS comprises 31 assessments of different motor signs, including 
eye movements, hand motor coordination, speech, involuntary movements, gait and posture. 
Each assessment is rated on a 5 -point scale from 0 (normal) to 4 (maximally abnormal). All 
UHDRS -TMS raters have to be certified by the European Huntington's Disease Network 
(EHDN) UHDRS -TMS online certification ( Reilmann et al, 2009).   
6.2. Secondary Efficacy Variables  
6.2.1. Percent Change from Baseline in Caudate Volume at Month 12/ET (Evaluated 
at Baseline and Month 12) 
Participants will undergo 3T MRI at baseline and Month 12 following unaccelerated volumetric 
T1-weighted acquisition protocols developed during the ADNI study (www.adni-info.org). 
Change in caudate volume over the scanning interval will be calculated using the Boundary Shift 
Integral (BSI) technique ( Hobbs et al, 2009; Freeborough and Fox, 1997; Leung et al,  2010). 
Change in whole brain and ventricular vol ume will also be calculated using this approach (see 
Section  6.3.1).  The BSI is an intensity-driven technique within the MIDAS software 
(Freeborough et al, 1997) which measures change ov er time in the brain directly from within -
subject registered (aligned) MR scan pairs. This technique has been optimised to provide robust 
measures of brain -volume change from multi- site data  (Leung et al, 2010) and has been shown to 
be sensitive to HD-related pathology over a 12- month interval in the multi -site TRACK -HD 
study ( Tabrizi et al, 2011). Details of how the BSI has been implemented  for this study are 
described in the Imaging Review Charter.  
White -matter volume change (see Section  6.3.1) will be estimated using a non -linear registration 
approach.Voxel- level volume change derived from within -subject non- linear registration will be 
summed over an automated baseline white -matter mask, to estimate within -subject volume 
change over the interval.  This analysis is detailed in the Imaging Review Charter.  
End-point quality control will be performed by trained analysts to ensure accuracy.  
Longitudinal change in caudate,  whole- brain and white -matter volume will be measured in mls 
and converted to a percentage of their baseline value for subsequent analysis . Longitudinal 
change in ventricular volume will be measured and analysed in absolute terms (ml).  
MRI scans may b e evaluated locally for any incidental pathology (ie, pathology unrelated to, or 
inconsistent with, the subject’s known HD) according to locally determined procedures. If such pathology is found, the Treating Neurologist/Physician should be notified. The M RI reading 
center will evaluate the scans only for the purpose of performing quantitative measurements. In 
order not to compromise blinding of the study, the MRI Reading Center will not report 
quantitative MRI findings back to the clinical site.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
89 Patients who develop unsuitability for MRI measures after baseline visit, will be allowed to 
continue in the study without performing the MRI assessment . 
6.2.2. Change from Baseline in HD -CAB Total Score (Sum of the Standardized Sub-
Components) at Month 12/ET (Evaluated at Baseline and Months 6 and 12) 
The following sections describe the tests that will are included in the HD -CAB.  
The CAB assessments will be performed only in those sites that have access to the devices 
needed to perform the assessments and, where this is the case, only in those patients who are 
capable of performing the assessments.  
To avoid variability due to different operating systems, hardware and computer accessories (i.e. 
mouse), sites will be provided with standardized equipment (tablets) to perform t he 
computerized cognitive assessments.  
6.2.2.1. Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)  
The SDMT is a paper -and-pencil test of attention, psychomotor speed and working memory. 
Participants view a ‘key’ at the top of the page containing symbols paired with numbers. The 
remainder of the page displays rows of symbols, and the participant has 90 seconds to write in the corresponding number that matches each symbol. 
6.2.2.2. Emotion Recognition 
Recognition of facial expressions of emotions is examined using computerized images of fac es 
depicting 6 basic emotions or a neutral expression. Participants are asked to indicate the emotion 
expressed in each photograph by selecting from the words fear, disgust, happy, sad, surprise, angry, and neutral (10 stimuli per emotion). 
6.2.2.3. Trail Making Te st 
Visual attention and task switching are assessed using the Trail Making test, which consists of 
25 circles on a standard sheet of paper. For Trails A, participants are required to connect, as 
quickly as possible, circles containing numbers in ascending numerical order. For Trails B, 
participants are to connect, as quickly as possible, circles containing numbers and letters, alternating between numbers and letters in ascending order ( e.g., 1, A, 2, B, 3, C, etc.) ( Bowie 
and Harvey , 2006)  Trail A is administered first, followed by Trail B to ensure preparedness for 
Trail B; however, only the Trail B score is  used as an outcome measure in the HD -CAB.  
6.2.2.4. Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, revised (HVLT -R) 
The HVLT -R is a paper -based instrume nt that offers a brief assessment of verbal learning and 
memory (recall). It is easy to administer and score and is well tolerated even by significantly impaired individuals. 
Its use has been validated with brain -disordered populations ( e.g., Alzheimer's d isease, HD,  
amnestic disorders) as a measure of verbal learning and memory. There are six alternate forms 
available, but 3 of the 6 forms, which have relatively greater equivalence with each other (Forms 4, 5, and 6) will be used, in randomized order. Each form consists of a list of 12 nouns (targets) with 4 words drawn from each of 3 semantic categories. The semantic categories differ across 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
90 the 6 forms, but the forms are very similar in their psychometric properties. Only the three 
learning trials (Trials  1-3) and the delayed recall trial (Trial 4) will be administered as part of the 
HD-CAB. The primary scores that will be examined as part of the HD -CAB is the sum of Trials 
1-4; however, the sum of Trials 1- 3 and separately Trial 4 will also be examined in  exploratory 
analyses. The HVLT -R has high test -retest reliability, and its construct, concurrent, and 
discriminant validity have been well established.  
6.2.2.5. Paced Tapping at 3 Hz 
Psychomotor function is assessed in a computerized Paced Tapping test. Participants tap on left 
and right mouse buttons, alternating between thumbs, at 3.0 Hz. They first listen to a tone 
presented at the 3.0 Hz rate, and then begin tapping in time with the tone. After 11 taps with the tone, the repetition tone is discontinued, and par ticipants attempt to continue tapping at the same 
rate until the  end of the trial (31 taps later). Four trials are administered.  
6.2.2.6. One Touch Stockings of Cambridge (OTS)  
OTS is a computerized spatial planning task which gives a measure of frontal lobe function. OTS is a variant of the Stockings of Cambridge task, and places greater demands on working memory 
as the participant has to visualize the solution. As with Stockings of Cambridge, the participant is 
shown 2 displays containing 3 colored balls. The displays are presented in such a way that they can easily be perceived as stacks of colored balls held in stockings or socks suspended from a beam.  
Along the bottom of the screen, there is a row of numbered boxes. The test administrator first demonstrates to the participant how to use the balls in the lower display to copy the pattern in the 
upper display, and completes 1 demonstration problem, where the solution requires 1 move. The 
participant must then complete 3 further problems, 1 each of 2 moves, 3 moves, and 4 moves. 
Next, the participant is shown further problems, and must work out in their head how many 
moves the solutions to these problems require, then select the appropriate box at the bottom of 
the screen to indicate their response.  
6.2.3. CIBIC -Plus Globa l Score at Month 12/ET (Evaluated at Months 6 and 12) as 
Compared to Baseline (Rated by an Independent Rater ) 
Global change in HD will be measured using the CIBIS scale at baseline and the CIBIC -Plus 
scale at subsequent time points. The CIBIC-Plus (version ADCS -CGIC) was developed, 
validated, and is commonly used in studies of anti- dementia drugs in Alzheimer’s disease 
(Joffres et al, 2000).  
An independent rater whose only role in the study is to conduct these global assessments wi ll 
evaluate the patient’s overall disease severity during the baseline visit (Visit 2) prior to the administration of study drug. This assessment, known as the CIBIS, rates the patient on a 7-point Likert scale from extremely severe HD to no symptoms of HD . 
At each subsequent visit in which the evaluation is performed (Months 6 and 12; Visits 6 and 8), the CIBIC -Plus will be preferentially administered by the same independent rater, but without 
knowledge of other endpoint assessments or the AEs experienced by the patient during the study (so as not to confound the rating of CIBIC-Plus as an efficacy measure or to unblind the study). 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
91 The independent rater is not permitted to discuss the medical condition of the patient with the 
treating physician. Instead, the independent rater exclusively will consider observations of the 
patient’s cognitive, functional, and behavioral performance obtained through interviewing the patient and the caregiver. The rater then compares those findings to the baseline assessment. The 
overall impression of change from baseline (CIBIC-Plus) is rated on a 7- point scale: 1 = marked 
improvement; 2 = moderate improvement; 3 = minimal improvement; 4 = no change; 
5 = minimal worsening; 6 = moderate worsening; 7 = marked worsening; all assess ments were 
relative to baseline. A higher score indicates a worsening of global function. 
In HD, the inclusion of caregiver input is particularly critical for a global assessment as previous 
studies have demonstrated that patients have limited awareness an d recognition of their deficits.  
Where possible, the same person should act as a patient’s caregiver/informant throughout the study. If this is not possible, a patient should have no more than 2 caregivers throughout the study. All possible attempts should  be made to assure that caregiver will attend the clinical visits 
in person together with the patient. If the caregiver/informant is not available to attend the clinic visit, the interview can be done over phone. 
6.2.4. Change from Baseline in UHDRS - TFC at Month  12/ET ( Evaluated at Baseline 
and Months 6 and 12) 
The Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) motor section (see  Section  6.1) and 
Total Functional Capacity will be used as measures of disease severity.  The UHDRS is a 
research tool, which has been developed by the Huntington Study Group to provide a uniform 
measure of clinical performance and course of HD. The UHDRS has undergone extensive 
reliability and validity testing and has been used in many research studies as a primary outcome 
measure ( Huntington Study Group, 1996).  
The TFC scale of the UHDRS assesses 5 functional domains associated with disability 
(occupation, finances, domestic chores, activities of daily living, and c are level) and is rated from 
0-13 (maximum functionality).

92 6.3. Exploratory Variables 
6.3.1. Change from Baseline in Brain Atrophy as Defined by the Percentage Change in 
Volume In: Whole Brain Volume and White -Matter Volume at Month 12/ET 
and Absolute Change in Ventri cular Volume at Month 12/ET (Evaluated at 
Baseline and Month 12) 
For a description of the MRI procedure and analysis, see Section  6.2.1.  
6.3.2. Change from baseline in UHDRS- FA at Month 12/ET (evaluated at baseline 
and Months 6 and 12)  
The FA scale of the UHDRS assesses several functional domains associated with disability 
(occupation, finances, capability to drive a car, ability  to take care of children, ability to make a 
phone call, etc. ) and is rated from 0 -25 (max imum functionality).  
6.3.3. Change from baseline in Q -Motor assessments at Month 12/ET (evaluated at 
baseline and Months 1, 3, 6 and 12) 
Motor deficits can be objectively assessed using different Q -Motor assessments ( Reilmann, 
2012) . All Q-Motor assessments are based on the application of precalibrated and temperature 
controlled force transducers and 3-dimensional position sensors with very high sensitivity and 
test-retest reliability across sessions and sites in a multicenter clinical study. Q- Motor measures 
thus aim to reduce the limited sensitivity of categorical clinical rating scales, the intra - and inter-
rater variability, and placebo effects observed in scales such as UHDRS -TMS. In addition, Q-
Motor assessments allow for the objective monitoring of unintended motor side- effects in 
clinical studies.  
Tasks detailed in the sections below have been selected for use in the current study. Data transfer will be performed using a secure web based platform, allowing continuous centralized dat a 
monitoring and quality control. Data analysis will be performed blinded and automated as 
described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
Q-Motor assessments will be performed only in those sites that have access to the devices 
needed to perform the assessments and, where this is the case, only in those patients who are capable of performing the assessments.  
6.3.3.1. Digitomotography (Speeded Index Finger Tapping)  
The patient will place their hand on a hand rest with their index finger positioned above a force-transducer. Recordings will start after practice runs. The patient will be instructed to finger tap as 
fast as possible between 2 auditory cues. The beginning of a tap is defined as a rise of the force 
by 0.05 N above maximal baseline level. The tap ends when it drops to 0.05 N before the 
maximal baseline level is reached again. The duration and variability of tap durations (TD), inter-onset intervals (IOI), inter peak intervals (IPI), and inter tap intervals (ITI) are the 
exploratory outcome measures for speeded tapping. In addition, variability of peak tapping forces (TF) will be calculated, and the tapping frequency (Freq), ie, the number of taps between the onsets of the first and the last tap divided by the time in between, will be determined. Five trials  of 10 seconds duration are performed with each hand ( Bechtel et al, 2010 ).  
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
93 6.3.3.2. Dysdiadochomotography (Pronation/Supination Hand Tapping) 
This task assesses the regularity of hand taps performed when alternating between the palm and 
dorsal surface of the hand performing a repetitive pronation/supination movement. The force and 
duration of the hand taps are recorded similarly to the speeded tapping task. A tone cues the start and end of an assessment. Five trials of 10 seconds duration are performed with each hand.  
6.3.3.3. Manumotography and Choreomotography (Grip Force and Chorea Analysis) 
This task assesses the coordination of isometric grip forces in the precision grip between the thumb and index finger ( Reilmann et al, 2001, Reilmann et al, 2010). Grip forces are assessed 
during grip initiation, object transport, and in a static holding phase. Patients are instructed to 
grasp and lift a device equipped with a force transducer and 3-dimensional position sensor in the 
precision grip between thumb and index finger and hold it stable adjacent to a marker 10- cm 
high. Grip forces and 3-dimensional position and orientation of the object are recorded. Mean 
isometric grip forces and grip force variability in the static phase (expressed as coefficient of 
variation = standard deviation [SD]/mean × 100) (GFV- C) are calculated during a 15 -second 
period prior to the second cueing tone. 
Five trials of 20 seconds duration are performed with each hand. Chorea is assessed calculating a 
“position-index” and “orientation- index” ( Reilmann et al, 2011). Start and end of assessment are 
signaled by a cueing tone.  
6.3.3.4. Pedomotography (Speeded Foot Tapping)  
The patient will place a foot on the foot device such that the ball of the foot is positioned above a force -transducer. Recordings will start after practice runs. The patient will be instructed to tap 
with the foot as fast as possible between 2 auditory cues. The beginning of a tap is defined as a 
rise of the force by 0.05 N above maximal baseline level. The tap ends when it dropped to 0.05 N 
before the maximal baseline level is reached again. The duration and variability of TD, IOI, IPI, and ITI are the exploratory outcome measures for speeded foot tapping. In addition, variability of 
peak TF will be calculated , and the tapping Freq, ie, the number of taps between the onsets of 
the first and the last tap divided by the time in between, will be determined. Five trials of 10 seconds duration are performed with each foot. 
6.3.4. Change from baseline in mPPT at Month 12/ET (evaluated at baseline and 
Months 6 and 12) 
The modified PPT quantifies the patient’s performance in physical tasks ( Brown et al, 2000). It 
is a standardized 9 -item test that measures the patient’s performance on functional tasks. 
Assistive devices are permitted for the tasks that require a standing position. Both the speed and 
accuracy at which the patients complete the items are taken into account during scoring. The 
maximum score of the test is 36, with higher scores indicating better performance.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
94 6.3.5. Change from baseline in HD QoL and EQ-5D-5L at Month 12/ET (evaluated at 
baseline and Month 12)  
6.3.5.1. HD-QoL 
The HD -QoL is a standardized instrument for measuring health- related quality of life ( Hocaoglu 
et al, 2012). It is a validated disease- specific measure designed for HD, and can provide a 
summary score of overall health -related quality of life, as well as scores on several discrete 
scales. HD -QoL is for people who are living with HD; this includes people who are at risk for 
HD, people who have tested positive for the huntingtin gene but do not have symptoms, and also 
for people at early through to late stages of disease. HD-QoL can be used across the full spectrum of HD. 
HD-QoL will be assessed by both caregiver/informant and patient. All possible attempts should 
be made to assure that caregiver/informant will attend the clinical visits in person together with the patient. If the caregiver/informant is not available to attend the clinic visit, the caregiver/informant form should be omitted. 
6.3.5.2. EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ -5D 3 level version (EQ-5D-3L) was introduced in 1990 ( EuroQoL Group, 1990). It 
essentially consists of the EQ -5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ 
VAS). The EQ- 5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self -
care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. In developing the 5L, the 5-
dimensional structure of the original EQ-5D- 3L w as retained but the levels on each dimension 
were expanded to 5 -levels based on qualitative and quantitative studies conducted by the 
EuroQol Group. The labels for each of the dimensions are: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and unable to/extreme problems. The EQ- VAS is still an 
integral part of the EQ -5D-5L but has been adapted to make it more user friendly. The 
respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most a ppropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. The EQ VAS records the 
respondent’s self- rated health on a vertical, visual analogue scale where the endpoints are 
labelled ‘Best imaginable health state’ and ‘Worst imaginable health state’. This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by the individual respondents. It 
should be noted that the numerals 1-5 have no arithmetic properties and should not be used as a 
cardinal score.  
The EQ -5D- 5L could be completed by the pa tients with caregiver assistance if needed.  
6.3.6. Change from baseline in WLQ at Month 12/ET (evaluated at baseline and 
Month 12) 
Huntington’s Disease imposes a substantial burden on patients in the form of impaired ability to 
perform productive activity such as paid employment, domestic household activity, or schooling. The WLQ captures a multidimensional look at work productivity. It is designed to measure 
productivity among workers who are employed, but may be performing at less than full capacity. 
It measures  the degree to which health problems interfere with specific aspects of job 
performance and the productivity impact of these work limitations. The eight- item version will 
be used to reduce respondent burden ( Lerner et al, 2001).  
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
95 The work productivity will be assessed in all patients, also those with milder disease.  
However, if the patient is unemployed, this questionnaire will not be completed.  
The WLQ could be completed by the patients with caregiver assistance if needed.  
6.3.7. Chang e from baseline in HD -CAB sub -components at Month 12/ET (evaluated 
at baseline and Months 6 and 12) 
For a description of the HD- CAB sub -components, see Section  6.2.2. 
6.3.8. Change from baseline in CDR -SB at Month 12/ET (evaluated at baseline and 
Month 12) 
The Clinical Dementia Rating – Sum of Boxes (CDR- SB) is a widely used scale that has 
demonstrated validity and reliability in the longitudinal assessment of patients with cognitive and 
functional deficits that do not rise to the level of a diagnosis of overt dementia3. 
The utilization of CDR -SB scores for staging dementia severity offers several advantages over 
the global score because the optimal characteristics of both scores can be combined into a single score. First , CDR -SB scores are much simpler to calculate than the global score and they do not 
require an algorithm for computation, which will ultimately result in fewer calculation errors for those not using the online system. Second, CDR- SB scores can be treated as interval data in 
statistical analyses, whereas global CDR scores are ordinal by the nature of the algorithm 
approach to condensing the data. Finally, the most significant advantage to using CDR- SB scores 
for staging of dementia severity is the increased precision afforded for tracking changes across 
time ( O'Bryant et al, 2008). 
The CDR is obtained through semistructured interviews of patients and informants, and cognitive functioning is rated in 6 domains of functioning: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. Each domain is rated 
on a 5-point scale of functioning as follows: 0, no impairment; 0.5, questionable impairment; 1, 
mild impairment; 2, moderate impairment; and 3, severe impairment (personal care is scored on a 4-point scale without a 0.5 rating available). The global CDR score is computed via an 
algorithm ( Morris, 1993). The CDR -SB score is obtained by summing each of the domain box 
scores, with scores ranging from 0 to 18. 
Where possible, the same person should act as a patient’s caregiver/informant throughout the 
study. If this is not possible, a patient should have no more than 2 caregivers throughout the 
study. All possible attempts should be made to assure that caregiver/informant will attend the clinical visits in person together with the patient. If the caregiver/informant is not available to attend the clinic visit, the interview can be done over phone.

96 6.3.9. Change from baseline in HADS at Month 12/ET (evaluated at baseline and 
Month 12) 
The HADS ( Zigmond and Snaith, 1983)  is a 14 item (each item scored 0 -3), self -administered 
rating scale that consists of two subscales assessing the presence and severity  of depression (0–
21) and anxiety (0–21), with a global score of 0–42. It was designed to diminish the influence of 
somatic symptoms and consequently does not include items relating to the physical symptoms of 
depression and has a medium overall cognitive complexity. Completion time: 5 –10 min. It has 
been validated in a study comprised of 50 patients with HD ( De Souza et al, 2001).  
6.3.10. Change from Baseline in Problem Behaviors Assessment -Short Form (PBA -s) at 
Month 12/ET (Evaluated at Baseline and Month 12) 
Because of the prominence of psychiatric symptoms in HD, it is recommended that the PBA- s 
form be used in all HD studies with any need for behavioral assessment as a comprehensive 
screen for the most common psychiatric symptoms in H D (Craufurd et al, 2001; Kingma et al, 
2008). The PBA -s also includes questions concerning suicidal behavior, a particular concern in 
HD. The PBA -s is based on the same set of core behavioral symptoms as the UHDRS Behavioral 
questions, which were used previously as the global psychiatric measure in most HD studies. The PBA -s has more detailed questions and more specific guidance on administration and scoring. 
The PBA -s is a brief semi -structured interview with both the patient and the informant covering 
the most common behavioral and psychiatric manifestations of HD. The interview is not restricted to a single construct, but rather covers several broad symptom domains relevant to HD, 
comprising 11 items: low mood, suicidal ideation, anxiety, irritability, anger/aggressive 
behavior, loss of motivation, perseverative thinking or behavior, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, paranoid thinking, hallucinations, behavior suggestive of disorientation.  
Each symptom is rated for severity on a 5 -point scale according to detailed scoring criteria which 
roughly correspond to the following: 0 = “not at all”; 1 = trivial; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate 
(disrupting everyday activities) and 4 = severe or intolerable. 
Each symptom is also scored for frequency on a 5-point scale as follows: 0 = symptom absent; 1 
= less than once weekly; 2 = at least once a week; 3 = most days (up to and including some part 
of every day); and 4 = all day, every day. Severity and frequency scores are multiplied to produce an overall  ‘PBA score’ for each symptom.  
Where possible, the same person should act as a patient’s caregiver/informant throughout the study. If this is not possible, a patient should have no more than 2 caregivers throughout the 
study. All possible attempts should be made to assure that caregiver/informant will attend the 
clinical visits in person together with the patient. If the caregiver is not available to attend the clinic visit, the interview can be done over phone. 
6.4. Methods and Timing of Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing 
Efficacy Data  
Methods and timing of assessing efficacy data are discussed in Section  3.11. Procedures for 
recording efficacy data are discussed in Section  13.1, and methods of analyses are discussed in 
Section  9.6.2.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
97 7. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY   
In this study, safety will be assessed by qualified study staff by evaluating the following: 
reported adverse events, clinical laboratory test results, vital signs measurements, ECG findings, 
physical examination findings (including body weight and height measurements), and suicidality 
(as assessed by changes from baseline in C -SSRS scores ) and premature discontinuations from 
the study.  
During the conduct of the study, an independent DSMB will review unblinded accumulating safety data on a regular basis to ensure the continuing safety of the study patients and study conduct issues. 
The DSMB will meet monthly until 40 patients from each study group (i.e. a total of 160 
patients) will have been exposed to their respective full dose for at least 3 months. Conditional 
on the absence of significant emerging safety concerns, enrolment in all the study arms will be 
approved to continue by the DSMB.  The DSMB will then continue to meet at least bi-monthly, 
or as decided by the DSMB, throughout the study. The DSMB can call a meeting at any time 
based on safety concerns, and decisions about discontinuing patients, should that happen, will be 
explained in a report to all sites and patients.   
The DSMB will be composed of independent physicians with expertise in the relevant 
therapeutic field and other relevant experts, such as a statistician. The DSMB will receive safety 
data periodically in an unblinded fashion. They will have the right to recommend discontinuation of the study for safety reasons.  
DSMB sessions can be open or closed. During open sessions, representatives of the sponsor and 
the Steering Committee may be present and information is provided and discussed in a blinded fashion. During closed sessions, the only participants are members of the DSMB and the designated unblinded statistician (if approved to be present).  
The DSMB chairperson will communicate with the sponsor in regard to issues resulting from the 
conduct and clinical aspects of the study. The sponsor will work closely with the committee to provide the necessary data for review.  
7.1. Adverse Events  
7.1.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of whether it has a causal relationship with this treatment.  
In this study, any adverse event occurring after the clinical study patient has signed the informed 
consent form should be recorded and reported as an adverse event.  
An adverse event can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, or 
laboratory parameter that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study, or 
significant worsening of the d isease under study or of any concurrent disease, whether or not 
considered related to the study drug. A new condition or the worsening of a pre- existing 
condition will be considered an adverse event. Stable chronic conditions (such as arthritis) that 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
98 are p resent before study entry and do not worsen during the study will not be considered adverse 
events.  
New symptoms of HD or deterioration of previously existing symptoms should be recorded as an 
adverse event only if the presentation and/or outcome is more severe than would normally be expected from the normal course of the disease in a particular subject. 
Accordingly, an adverse event can include any of the following: 
• intercurrent illnesses  
• physical injuries  
• events possibly related to concomitant medication  
• significant worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of the disease under 
study or other pre- existing conditions . (Note: A condition recorded as pre- existing 
that is intermittently symptomatic [e .g., headache] and which occurs during the study 
should be recorded as an adverse event.) 
• drug interactions 
• events occurring during diagnostic procedures or during any washout phase of the 
study 
• laboratory or diagnostic test abnormalities that result in the withdrawal of the patient from the study, are associated with clinical signs and symptoms or a serious adverse 
event , or require medical treatment or further diagnostic work-up, or are considered 
by the investigator to be clinically significant. Note : Abnormal laboratory test results 
at the screening visit that preclude a patient from entering the study or receiving study 
treatment are not considered adverse events, but will be evaluated to monitor data 
from patients who do not meet screening criteria.  
• all events of possible drug-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinemia (defined as AST or ALT ≥ 3 times the ULN, plus either bilirubin ≥ 2 times the ULN or 
International Normalized Ratio [ INR] >1.5) or Hy’s Law events require immediate 
study treatment cessation and reporting as a serious adverse event.  
7.1.2. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events   
For adverse event recording, the study period is defined for each patient as that time period from 
signature of the informed consent form through the end of the follow-up period. For this study, 
the follow-up period i s defined as 1 month following the last dose of study medication 
All adverse events that occur during the defined study period must be recorded on the source 
documentation and transcribed onto the CRF, regardless of the severity of the event or judged 
relationship to the study drug. For serious adverse events, the Serious Adverse Event Form must also be completed and the serious adverse event must be reported immediately (see Section  7.1.5.3.1).   
At each contact w ith the patient, the investigator or designee must query the patient for adverse 
events by asking an open-ended question such as, “Have you had any unusual symptoms or 
medical problems since the last visit? If yes, please describe.” All reported or observed signs and 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
99 symptoms will be recorded individually, except when considered manifestations of a medical 
condition or disease state. A precise diagnosis will be recorded whenever possible. When such a 
diagnosis is made, all related signs, symptoms, and any t est findings will be recorded collectively 
as a single diagnosis on the CRF and, if it is a serious adverse event, on the Serious Adverse Event Form. 
The clinical course of each adverse event will be monitored at suitable intervals until resolved or 
stabilized or returned to baseline, or until the patient is referred to the care of a health care 
professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug or study procedure is 
made.  
The onset and end dates, duration (in case of adverse even t duration of less than 24 hours), action 
taken regarding study drug, treatment administered, and outcome for each adverse event must be recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF.  
The relationship of each adverse event to study drug treatment and study procedures, and the 
severity and seriousness of each adverse event, as judged by the investigator, must be recorded 
as described below.  
 
7.1.3. Severity of an Adverse Event   
The severity of each adverse event must be recorded as 1 of the cho ices on the following scale: 
Mild:  No limitation of usual activities  
Moderate:  Some limitation of usual activities  
Severe:  Inability to carry out usual activities  
 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
100 7.1.4. Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Study Drug  
The relationship of an adverse event to the study drug is characterized as follows:  
Term  Definition  Clarification 
No 
reasonable possibility 
(not related)  This category applies to 
adverse events which, after careful consideration, are 
clearly due to extraneous 
causes (disease, 
environment, etc .) or to 
adverse events, which, after 
careful medical 
consideration at the time 
they are evaluated, are 
judged to be unrelated to the study drug. The relationship of a n adverse event  may be considered 
“no reasonable possibility ” if it is clearly du e to 
extraneous causes or if at least 2 of the following apply: 
it does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from 
the administration of the test drug. 
it could readily have been produced by the patient’s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or othe r 
modes of therapy administered to the patient. 
it does not follow a known pattern of response to the test 
drug.  
it does not reappear or worsen when the drug is 
re-administered.  
Reasonable 
possibility 
(related)  This category applies to 
adverse events for  which, 
after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, a 
connection with t he test 
drug administration cannot be ruled out with certainty 
nor felt with a high degree of certainty to be related to 
the study drug. The relationship of an a dverse event  may be considered 
“reasonable possibility ” if at least 2 of the following  
apply: 
it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the drug. 
it cannot be reasonably explained by the known 
characteristics of the patient’s clinica l state, environmental 
or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to 
the patient.  
it disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose. There are important exceptions when an adverse 
event does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, 
yet drug- relatedness clearly exists.  
it follows a known pattern of response to the test drug. 
7.1.5. Serious Adverse Events   
7.1.5.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes or actions: 
• death  
• a life -threatening adverse event (ie, the patient was at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred); does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death  
• inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization means that 
hospital inpatient admission and/or prolongation of hospital stay were required for 
treatment of an adverse event, or that they occurred as a consequence of the event. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
101 Hospitalizations  scheduled for an elective procedure or for treatment of a pre- existing 
condition that has not worsened during participation in the study will not be 
considered serious adverse events.  
• persistent or significant disability or incapacity (refers to a substa ntial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Note : Any suspected transmission of 
an infectious agent via a medicinal product is considered an important medical event. 
An adverse event that does not meet any of the criteria for seriousness listed ab ove will be 
regarded as a nonserious adverse event.  
7.1.5.2. Expectedness   
A serious adverse event that is not included in the Adverse Reaction section of the relevant reference safety information by its specificity, severity, outcome, or frequency is considered an 
unexpected adverse event.  The reference safety information for this study is the laquinimod 
Investigator’s Brochure . 
The sponsor’s Global Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Department  will determine the 
expectedness for all serious adverse events.  
7.1.5.3. Reporting a Serious Adverse Event   
7.1.5.3.1. Investigator Responsibility 
To satisfy regulatory requirements, a ll serious adverse events (as described in Section  7.1.5.1) 
that occur during the study period (including the protocol-defined follow-up period), regardless of judged relationship to treatment with the study drug, must be reported to the sponsor by the 
investigator within 24 hours of becoming aware of  it. Completing the serious adverse event form 
and reporting the event must not be delayed, even if not all the information is available. The 
investigator does not need to actively monitor subjects for adverse events once the study has 
ended. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient after the defined study period should be reported to the sponsor only if the investigator becomes aware of them . 
The serious adverse event form should be sent to the Teva local safety officer (LSO) or other designated personnel (a contract research organization [CRO] in a country without a Teva L SO) 
Contact  information is in the Clinical Study Personnel Contact Information sectio n. The LSO 
will forward the report to the sponsor’s Global Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Department.  
The following information should be provided to record the event accurately and completely:  
• study number TV5600- CNS -20007 (LEGATO -HD) 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
102 • investigator and investigational center  identification  
• patient number 
• onset date and detailed description of adverse event 
• investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to the study drug 
(no reasonable possibility, reasonable possibility) 
Additional information may include the following:  
• age and sex of patient  
• date of first dose of study drug 
• date and amount of last administered dose of study drug 
• action taken  
• outcome, if known 
• severity  
• explanation of assessment of relatedness  
• concomitant therapy (including doses, routes, and regimens) and treatment of the event  
• pertinent laboratory or other diagnostic test data  
• medical history  
• results of dechallenge/rechallenge, if kn own 
• for an adverse event resulting in death:  
− cause of death (whether or not the death was related to study drug) 
− autopsy findings (if available) 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the IEC/IRB is also informed of the event, in accordance wit h local regulations.  
Each report of a serious adverse event will be reviewed and evaluated by the investigator and the sponsor to assess the nature of the event and the relationship of the event to the study drug, study procedures, and to underlying diseas e.  
Additional information (follow-up) about any serious adverse event unavailable at the initial reporting should be forwarded by the investigational center within 24 hours of when it becomes known to the same address as the initial report.  
For all count ries, The sponsor’s Global Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Department will 
distribute the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) form/XML 
file to the LSO/CRO for local submission to the regulatory authorities and IEC/IRBs an d 
investigators, according to regulations.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
103 The blinding will be maintained for the people who are involved directly in the study. Therefore, 
in case of a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR), only the LSO/CRO will 
receive the unblinded report for regulatory submission; the others will receive a blinded report .  
Note: Although pregnancy is not a serious adverse event, the process for reporting a pregnancy is similar to that for reporting a serious adverse event (see Section  7.2).  
7.1.5.3.2. Sponsor Responsibility   
If a serious unexpected adverse event is believed to be related to the study drug or study procedures, the sponsor will take appropriate steps to notify all investigators participating in 
sponsored clinical studies of laquinimod and the appropriate regulatory authorities (and 
IEC/IRB, if appropriate) .  
In addition to notifying the investigators and regulatory authorities  (and IEC/IRB, if appropriate) , 
other measures may be required, including the following:  
• altering existing research by modifying the protocol 
• discontinuing or suspending the study 
• altering the process of informed consent by modifying the existing consent form and informing current study participants of new findings 
• modifying listings  of expected toxicities to include adverse events newly identified as 
related to laquinimod 
7.1.6. Protocol -Defined Adverse Events for Expedited Reporting   
 
Ischemic cardiac events (such as myocardial infarction, unstable angina, acute coronary syndrome, etc), cerebrovascular events (such as cerebral arterial occlusion, cerebral ischemia, 
etc), and deaths should be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours, including completion of the 
corresponding dedicated CRF. 
7.1.7. Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event  
Any patient who e xperiences an adverse event may discontinue treatment at any time at the 
discretion of the investigator. If a patient discontinues treatment wholly or in part because of an 
adverse event, both the adverse events page and termination page of the CRF will be completed 
at that time.  
A complete final evaluation at the time of the patient’s withdrawal (Visit 8 procedures) should be 
made. In addition, a blood sample will be obtained for the measurement of study drug 
concentrations. The patient will be monitored at the discretion of the investigator ( e.g., until the 
event has resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a health care professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug or study procedure is 
made) . The investigator must inform the clinical project physician/clinical leader (CPP/CL) as 
soon as possible of all patients who are being considered for withdrawal due to adverse events. Additional reports must be provided when requested. 
If a patient discontinues treatment for multiple reasons that include adverse events, the 
termination page of the CRF should indicate that the withdrawal was related to an adverse event. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
104 An exception to this requirement will be the occurrence of an adverse event which in the opinion 
of the investigator is not severe enough to warrant discontinuation but which requires the use of a 
prohibited medication, thereby requiring discontinuation of the patient. In such a case, the reason for discontinuation would be need to take a prohibited medication, not the adverse event. 
7.1.8. Medical Emergencies   
Medical emergencies must be reported to the individual identified in the clinical study person nel 
contact information section of this protocol. 
Equipment, supplies, and properly skilled medical personnel must be accessible for an adverse 
event requiring immediate treatment.  
Any dose of study drug (whether laquinimod or placebo), whether taken intentionally or 
unintentionally, in excess of that prescribed must be immediately reported to the sponsor. When 
the identification of the study drug must be known, the investigator must follow the procedures 
outlined in Section 3.8.  
7.1.9. Medication Error and Special Situations  
Any administration of study medication th at is not in accordance with the study protocol should 
be reported on the CRF either as a violation, if it meets the violation criteria according to the 
protocol ( Section  11.1.2), or as a deviation in the patients source documents, regardless of 
whether an adverse event occurs as a result. All instances of incorrect medication administration should be categorized as 'Non-Compliance to IMP'. 
Types of Medication Errors and/or special situations: 
1. Medication error - Any unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, or 
administration of a medicinal product while in the control of the healthcare professional, 
patient or consumer. 
2. Overdose - Administration of a quantity of a medicinal product given per administration 
or cumulatively which is above the maximum recommended dose according to the 
authorized product information. Clinical judgment should always be applied. 
3. Misuse - Situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately used not in acco rdance with the authorized product information. 
4. Abuse - Persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of medicinal products which is accompanied by harmful physical or psychological effects.  
5. Off-label use - Situations where a medicinal product is inten tionally used for a medical 
purpose not in accordance with the authorized product information. 
6. Occupational exposure - Exposure to a medicinal product, as a result of one’s professional 
or non-professional occupation. 
7.1.10. Protocol Deviations Because of an Adver se Event   
If a patient experiences an adverse event or medical emergency, departures from the protocol may be allowed on a case- by-case basis. After stabilization and/or treatmen t has been 
administered to ensure patient safety, the investigator or other ph ysician in attendance must 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
105 contact the individual identified in the Clinical Study Person nel Contact Information section of 
this protocol as soon as possible to discuss the situation. The investigator, in consultation with 
the sponsor, will decide whether the patient should continue to participate in the study. Any departures from the proto col because of adverse events mus t be noted on the CRF and in source 
documents, along with the reason for such departures.  
7.2. Pregnancy   
To further emphasize the importance of use of acceptable contraception and avoidance of pregnancy under laquinimod exposure, and to reduce as much as possible the exposure to 
laquinimod if a pregnancy occurs despite all recommended measures, all women of child- bearing 
potential ( for example women who are not postmenopausal or have not undergone surgical 
sterilization)  and not using acceptable methods of contraception, will be instructed about the 
teratogenicity and potential delayed risks for a child exposed in utero to laquinimod. These 
subjects will be counseled about the importance of using 2 acceptable methods of contraception throughout the entire study duration and until 30 days after the last dose of treatment was 
administered and about the need to stop treatment immediately if pregnancy is suspected . 
Patients who are women of child-bearing potential must use 2 acceptable methods of 
contraception for 30 days prior to initiation of treatment, throughout treatment duration and until 30 days after the last dose of treatment.  
Acceptable met hods of birth control include : Intrauterine devices, barrier methods (condom or 
diaphragm with spermicide) and hormonal methods of birth control (oral contraceptive, contraceptive patch, long- acting injectable contraceptive) .  
The patients' understanding of the importance of preventive pregnancy measures and their ability to follow the required instructions will be ensured by the investigator. 
Additionally, monthly pregnancy tests (urine dipstick and/or serum pregnancy β -hCG test, as 
applicable per the relevant time point) will be performed. Early terminated subjects who are in 
the study for the purpose of follow- up will not be required to take the pregnancy tests if the last 
study drug dose was taken more than 30 days prior to the visit. 
All pregnancies of women participating in study and that occur during the study, or within 
30 days after the last dose of treatment was administered , are to be reported immediately to the 
individual identified in the clinical study personnel contact information section of th is protocol, 
and the investigator must provide the LSO/CRO with the pregnancy form. The process for reporting a pregnancy is the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event (see Section  7.1.5.3).  
Any woman  who becomes pregnant during the study will discontinue treatment. Subjects who 
become pregnant will be monitored for the outcome of the pregnancy (including spontaneous or 
voluntary termination . If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of the infant up to 
8 weeks of age),  details of birth, and presence or absence of any birth defect, congenital 
abnormalities, or maternal and newborn complications, will be reported to the sponsor. Any complication of pregnancy during the study and any complication of pregnancy that the 
investigator becomes aware of after termination from the study will be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event, as appropriate. 
If the pregnancy does not continue to term, 1 of the following actions will be taken: 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
106 • For a spontaneous abortion, report as a serious adverse event.  
• For an elective abortion due to developmental anomalies, report as a serious adverse 
event.  
• For an elective abortion not  due to developmental anomalies, report on the pregnancy 
form.  
7.3. Clinical Laboratory Tests  
All clinical laboratory test results outside of the reference range will be interpreted by the 
investigator as belonging to 1 of the following categories: 
• abnormal but not a clinically significant worsening  
• abnormal and a clinically significant worsening  
A laboratory test result that has significantly worsened (according to medical judgment) from the baseline result will be recorded on the source documentation, transcribed onto the CRF as an 
adverse event, and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2. An adverse event includes a

○ Additional investigations and follow-up per the investigator's discretion or Sponsor's request. 
7.3.4. Urgent Safety Laboratory Panel 
Unscheduled urgent safety laboratory samples may be collected at the discretion of the investigator or medical monitor at any time to assist with further investigations of cardio vascular 
events or other clinical event of interest. The samples should be collected as soon as possible in association with the event.  
The following tests will be performed on these samples:

7.3.6. Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin Tests  
Human chorionic gonadotropin ( β-hCG) serum test will be performed for all women of child-
bearing potential (women who are not post menopausal or who have not undergone surgical 
sterilization) at screening (Visit 1) and at all subsequent study visits. Age -appropriate normal 
ranges for H CG should be used. If the reading for the serum pregnancy test is indeterminate, the 
test should be repeated after 3 -4 days to see whether there is an increase in β -hCG or whether it 
is a stable elevation. If no increase is observed, the patient will not be considered to be pregnant. 
However,  no study drug will be administered until this is resolved.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
109 Urine β -hCG tests will be performed for all women of child -bearing potential at baseline (Visit 
2), and at all subsequent visits, and if clinically indicated at any other time.  
In addition, starting after Visit 3, a urine β -hCG test will be performed in women of child-
bearing potential every 28 (±2) days, by the patient at home, and recorded in the patient's 
medical records. The patient will be contacted by tel ephone within 72 hours after the scheduled 
test is to be performed and asked specific questions regarding the test. In case of suspected 
pregnancy (positive urine β -hCG test result), absence of menstruation or any other reason 
suggesting pregnancy) , the caller will make sure that the study drug has been discontinued and 
the subject will be instructed to arrive to the site as soon as possible (within 10 days) with all remaining study drugs capsules. 
Any patient who becomes pregnant during the study will be withdrawn. Procedures for reporting the pregnancy are provided in Section 7.2.  
7.4. Vital Signs   
Vital signs will be measured at all in -clinic visits (Visits 1 -4 and 6-9). Vital signs include the 
following: 
• pulse 
• blood pressure  
• body temperature 
Before pulse and blood pressure are measured, the patient must be in a supine position and 
resting for at least 5  minutes. The same position and arm should be used each time vital signs are 
measured for a given patient. For any  abnormal vital sign finding, the measurement should be 
repeated as soon as possible. Any vital sign value that is judged by the investigator as a clinically significant change (worsening) from a baseline value will be considered an adverse event, 
recorded  on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF, and monitored as described 
in Section  7.1.2. 
7.5. Electrocardiography   
A single 12-lead ECG will be conducted at screening (Visit 1), and at the following in- clinic 
visits: Week 4, Week 13, Week 26, Week 52 and follow-up (Visits 3, 4, 6, 8 and 9). During the baseline visit (Visit 2) a 12-lead ECG will be conducted in triplicate  (approximately 10±5 
minutes apart ). A qualified physician at a central diagnostic center will be responsible for 
interpreting the ECG. Any ECG finding that is judged by the site investigator as a clinically significant change (worsening) compared with a baseline value will be considered an adverse 
event, recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF, and monitored as 
described in Section  7.1.2. 
7.6. Physical Examinations  
Physical examinations, including height (to be obtained at the screening visit only) and weight will be perform ed at all in -clinic visits (Visits 1 -4 and 6-9). Any physical examination finding 
that is judged by the investigator as a clinically significant change (worsening) compared with a 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
110 baseline value will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the CRF, and monitored as 
described in Section  7.1.2.  
7.7. Estimated Creatinine Clearance Calculation  
Significant changes in laquinimod exposure, in particular in terms of unbound drug fraction, are predicted in patients with renal impairment (see Section  1.3.2.1). Consequently, estimated CrCl 
will be calculated at all visits to monitor chronic renal function in the study in order to identify patients with potentially impaired laquinimo d clearance. Patients with a confirmed CrCl 
<60 mL/min/1.73 m
2 should stop study medication temporarily, and the CrCl assessment should 
be repeated. If the renal impairment is confirmed ( estimated CrCl <60 mL/min/1.73 m2), the 
patient should stop study medication permanently  (see Section  3.6).  
Following recent findings connecting Gd- based contrast agents and nephrogenic systemic 
fibrosis, the estimated  CrCl result should be available prior to the baseline MRI scan. Estimated 
CrCl calculation will be done in accordance with the central laboratory creatinine value measurement performed at the screening visit. The central laboratory will report calculated 
estimated CrCl; however, if the result is not available prior to the baseline MRI scan, estimated 
CrCl may be calculated  using the Cockcroft-Gault equation ( eg, available online CrCl calculator: 
http://reference.medscape.com/calculator/creatinine -clearance- cockcroft -gault ). 
7.8. Cardiovascular Risk Assessment and Managemen t 
Evaluation of major modifiable cardiac risk factors (eg, body mass index [ BMI], diabetes, high 
blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, tobacco smoking) will be performed at the time points indicated in Table 3. In addition, an evaluation of cardiovascular risk factors should take place as soon as possible for patients already in the study, following approval of Global Amendment 04. 
Assessment of changes in cardiovascular risk and appropriate cardiovascular risk management 
with appropriate medical follow-up, if clinically indicated, should be performed during the scheduled and unscheduled visits. 
Cardiovascular risk management should be conducted according to evidence- based, local 
standard -of-care procedures.  Patients will u ndergo referral to a suitable clinic if needed.  
7.9. Other Safety Measures and Variables  
7.9.1. Concomitant Therapy or Medication  
Concomitant therapy or medication usage will be monitored throughout the study. Details of 
prohibited medications are found in Section  5.3. 
7.9.2. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The C -SSRS will be used to rate the patient’s degree of suicidal ideation on a scale ranging from 
“no suicidal ideation” to “active suicidal ideation with specif ic plan and intent” ( Posner et al, 
2011). The baseline screening version of the C- SSRS will be completed at screening (Visit 1).  
On subsequent visits (Visits 2-4 and Visits 6-9) The C- SSRS since last visit version will be 
complete d. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
111 Patients with active suicidal ideation, as measured by a score of 4 or 5 on the C -SSRS at the 
screening visit, will not be eligible for the study.  
A referral for psychiatric evaluation is required for any increase in the scale from baseline.  
In any event of suspected active suicidality (e.g. active suicidal ideation or intent, significant 
suicidal behavior) or clinical findings suggesting that the patient is dangerous to himself or 
herself, the patient should be referred  for immediate psychiatric evaluation.  
7.9.3. Abdominal Computed Tomography Scan 
In case of pancreatitis or suspected pancreatitis, an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan 
should be performed as soon as possible in order to clarify the diagnosis and enable assessment 
of severity of this condition.  
For complete guidance on monitoring subjects with elevated pancreatic amylase levels, see 
Appendix A  (Section 7). 
7.10. Methods and Timing of Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety 
Data   
Methods and timing of assessing safety data are discussed in  Section  3.11. Procedures for 
recording safety data are discussed in Section  13.1 and methods of analyses are discussed in 
Secti on 9.8.2.  
Furthermore, all adverse events will be reviewed on a periodic basis (e.g., scheduled safety 
reviews for laquinimod) as safety data becomes available (see Section  7).

112 8. ASSESSMENT OF PHARMACOKINETICS/ 
PHARMACOGENOMICS/OTH ER ANCILLARY STUDIES   
8.1. Pharmacokinetic Variables  
Samples will be analyzed for laquinimod and  its metabolites using appropriate validated 
methods. Incurred sample reanalysis may be performed.   
8.1.1. Blood Sampling and Handling  
Whole blood samples (4 mL ) will be collected via venipuncture in the morning f or plasma 
concentration measurements of laquinimod and its metabolites as follows: 
PPK samples will be collected at visits at Months  1, 3, 6 and 12 from all subjects.  
PK samples of laquinimod and its metabolites will be collected from approximately 15 patients 
per each of the three continuing treatment groups (at selected sites at Month 1), for a total of approximately 45 patients, at the following timepoints – pre -dose, 15, 30 min and 1, 2, 3, 6 and 
24 hours post dose. Additionally, PK samples were collected from 2 patients in the laquinimod 1.5 mg/day treatment group when the treatment was stopped; no further PK samples will be collected from the laquinimod 1.5 mg/day treat ment group. 
Unscheduled pharmacokinetic blood samples may be collected at the discretion of the investigator or medical monitor at any time to assist with further investigations of cardiovascular  
events or other clinical event of intere st for safety . The samples should be collected as soon as 
possible in association with the event. 
The dates and times of study drug administration and the date and time of each pharmacokinetic 
sample will be recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF.  
Samples will be collected into disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate (Na
2EDTA) Vacutainer 
tubes, inverted slowly 6 to  8 times to  mix the contents, and placed on water/ice (~0- 5°C). Blood 
samples will be centrifuged (2000g, ~10 minutes, 0°C-5°C) between 5 minutes and 1 hour after 
sampling. If a refrigerated centrifuge is not available, samples should be chilled before 
centrifugation. Other measures should be taken as appropriate to prevent samples from any heating  during centrifugation. S eparated plasma will be placed on water/ice (~0 -5°C) and 
transferred in 3 portions (1  aliquot of 300 uL for laquinimod analysis and 2 approximately equal  
portions of ~750 uL for metabolite analysis) into 3 opaque, labeled, polypropylene tubes (sets A , B, and C respectively) . Tubes will be placed in an upright position into frozen storage at nominal 
-70ºC (if -70ºC storage is not possible at the site, store at -20ºC) within 1 hour from the start of the centrifugation.  
Sample labels should include the study number, patient randomization number, period, nominal 
collection time, set (A B, or C), indication that they are pharmacokinetic samples, and an 
indication of storage conditions at the site ( -70ºC or -20ºC).  
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
113 8.1.2. Shipment of Samples  
Plasma samples for all patients will be shipped from the investigational center to the central 
coordinating laboratory, where they will be stored at nominal -70°C until shipped to 
Bioanalytical Laboratory of Teva Pharmaceutical Works Private Ltd. Co., Debrecen, Hungary for analysis . The bioanalytical laboratory will be notified before the shipment of the samples. 
Shipping information will be sent when the samples are shipped. 
Set A and B samples will be transported, frozen with sufficient dry ice for 4 days, by next -day 
courier to the bioanalytical laboratory.  Set C samples will be sent to the same laboratory as that for sets A and B on subsequent days by 
next-day courier,.  
Sample shipments should be sent no later in the week than Wednesday morning for next- day 
delivery. Samples ar e not to arrive on the weekend. 
8.2. Pharmacodynamic Variables  
Biomarker assessment will include the following:  
Cytokines, and other soluble proteins (or any other soluble marker) levels will be determined in 
plasma in order to better understand laquinimod mechanism of action and explore response 
predictive markers.  
Monocytes, which were shown to play an important role in laquinimod mechanism of action in 
preclinical studies, will be isolated from patients’  blood using cell separation method. Monocyte 
gene expression and/or protein profile will be explored. This experiment will help us understand 
the molecular mechanism of laquinimod in patients. This study will be performed only at selected sites in a subgroup of patients.  
TSPO is highly expressed in activated microglia which have been found to contribute to neuroinflammation in many types of CNS disorders. Change in microglial activation state, will 
be investigated. PET scans and imaging analysis of microglial activation marker TSPO will be 
performed. This study will be performed only at selected sites in a subgroup of patients. 
MRS will be performed in order to explore the potential effect on metabolic changes in the 
putamen and frontal white matter that are associated with the earliest stages of Huntington’s 
Disease.  This study will be performed only at selected sites in a subgroup of patients. 
The above biological markers will also be used to aim to identify responders to laquinimod 
treatment, and explore response predictive markers, to potentially identify pat ients  in which 
clinical benefits could be further investigated . 
Unscheduled samples for potential biomarker assessments may be collected at the discretion of 
the investigator or medical monitor at any time to assist with further investigations of cardiovas cular events or other clinical event of interest. The samples should be collected as soon 
as possible in association with the event. 
8.2.1. Sampling and Handling  
Blood samples for Biomarker assessment:  
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
114 • 8.5 mL  blood samples for plasma cytokine and protein analysi s will be collected from all 
subjects at Baseline, Months 6 and 12. 
• 50 mL whole blood samples for monocyte isolation will be collected at baseline and 
Month 12 only at selected sites in a subgroup of patients (aiming at 25 per treatment arm) . The sample co llection has to be done in accordance with the laboratory manual . For 
UK patients, the sample can be drawn prior to the baseline or Month 12 visit, as it coincides with the PET scan  visits . 
Biomarker samples will be stored for a period of up to 15 years and then destroyed. 
8.2.2. Shipment and Analysis of Samples  
Plasma samples will be collected in BD P800 tubes (or equivalent) and will be transferred to -
70ºC within maximum 4 hours (if -70ºC storage is not possible at the site, store at -20ºC). Tubes 
will be sent to the central laboratory on dry ice. 
Analysis will be performed if and when required. Since new biomarker techniques continue to be 
developed, the method and laboratory that will be recommended for cytokine and protein 
analysis will be determined at a lat er stage.  
For monocyte isolation experiments - whole blood samples will be sent at ambient temperature as specified in the laboratory manual to the CRO.  
8.2.3. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)  
The principal motivation for including MRS as an endpoint in thi s study will be to assess the 
potential effect of Laquinimod on metabolic changes in the putamen and frontal white matter that 
are associated with the earliest stages of Huntington’s Disease. The biochemical changes 
measured by MRS may be reversible and responsive to pharmacological intervention, making them a promising biomarker in HD.  
Previous studies by the Vancouver site investigators have demonstrated that the neuronal marker 
metabolite NAA exhibited significantly decreased concentrations in the putam en between 
controls and pre-HD, and between pre- HD and early -HD, and that these changes were robust, 
consistent, and had a low degree of variability when followed longitudinally over 24 months. The concentration of Myo- inositol (MI), a glial cell marker in  the putamen was substantially 
increased in early HD vs pre-HD and controls ( Sturrock et al, 2010) .  
At selected sites, the MRS analysis will add two single voxel acquisitions to the MRI protocol in this study. The putamen and frontal white matter voxels will be collected using the same protocol that was used in the MRS study for the TRACK-HD study and will be described in detail in a 
separate imaging manual. The magnetic resonance (MR) spectra will be obtained using a single-
voxel PRESS localization sequence with a Repetition time (TR) of 2000ms, an Echo time (TE) of 35ms and 1024 points will be acquired. Sites with 3.0T Philips MRI scanners will be provided 
with a standardized ‘Exam Card’ (a precise specification of MR pulse sequence parameters). 
Two MRS voxels will be acquired. The first voxel will be the previous in the left putamen with a voxel size of 35 mm x 10  mm x 15  mm (5250 mm
3). The second voxel will be placed in frontal 
white matter and will have a voxel size of 15  mm x 15 mm x 10  mm (2250 mm3).  
The MRS results will be analysed using LCModel, which is the most commonly used MRS data analysis package. Its advantages include the fact it is almost completely objective, it provides a 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
115 measure of confidence in the resulting co ncentrations and because it is used by so many groups 
worldwide, the analysed results are easier to compare with results from other MRS studies.  
Metabolite concentrations will be normalized to the unsuppressed water spectrum. Where 
possible, results will be corrected for T 1 and T 2 (uncoupled spins) relaxation using published 
times from the literature on normal brain, although at TE 35ms and TR 2000ms, these corrections are small. LCModel estimates the reliability of a “concentration” measurement and return s a standard deviation (%SD) for each metabolite. Standard deviations less than 20% are 
considered reliable and therefore any metabolite with a %SD greater than 20% will be excluded from further analysis. From the MR spectra, at least five metabolites of interest will examined: N-acetyl aspartate (NAA, a marker of neuronal integrity), Creatine (Cr, a marker of brain energy 
metabolism), total Choline (tCho, a marker for neuronal membrane turnover), Glutamate (Glu, a major CNS excitatory neurotransmitter) and  Myo -inositol (MI, an astrocyte marker).  
Mean metabolite concentrations will be compared between treatment groups.  
8.2.4. PET Scan  
At selected sites, patients will be referred to the Imperial College in London, where PET Imaging will be performed at the Imanova Imaging Centre on the Hammersmith Hospital site. The PET 
imaging will be performed at baseline and after treatment with laquinimod over a 12–month period of time. 
All patients participating in the PET arm of the study will be exposed to additional ionizing 
radiation due to the PET/CT scans. There are no alternatives methods available to explore 
neuroinflammation in vivo. While any ionizing radiation exposure increases the risk of future 
malignancy, for the radiation exposure in this study such exposure is s mall and the increased risk 
is minimal. Patients who recently took part in clinical studies or underwent medical procedures 
involving ionizing radiation, such that participation in this study would lead to an exposure of 
>10mSv in the last 12 months, will be excluded from participation in this ancillary study.  This 
will not affect the patient's participation in the main study.  
The 18-kDa TSPO is expressed within microglia and macrophages and has been used as a target for PET ligands to study neurodegenerative disease processes that involve microglial activation, such as HD, Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) ( Politis et al, 2012 ). The 
PET radioligand 
11C-PK11195 has been used most frequently for this purpose, but signal 
quantification is limited by poor specific signal- to-background ratio.  
11C-PBR28 is a second generation radioligand with high affinity to TSPO, favourable in vivo 
kinetics, and greater signal -to-noise ratio than 11C-(R)-PK 11195 ( Fujita et al, 2008; Imaizumi et 
al, 2008; Kreisl  et al, 2010; Kreisl  et al, 2013) . 
One limitation of 11C-PBR28, shared by all tested second generation TSPO radioligands 
(including 11C-DAA1106), is differential affinity for the target protein ( Owen et al, 2011). This 
differential affinity is caused by the rs6971 polymorphism on the TSPO gene that causes a non-conservative amino acid substitution, resulting in three patterns of TSPO binding ( Owen et al, 
2012). Subjects without the polymorphism (HH) have high affinity binding for PBR28, homozygotes (LL) have low affinity binding, and heterozygotes (HL) express both high and low affinity TSPO (mixed -affinity binding). Low affinity subjects are easily id entified by PET due to 
negligible 
11C-PBR28 binding in vivo; however, PET cannot easily resolve the difference 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
116 between high and mixed-affinity subjects. Previous work demonstrated that correcting in vitro 
binding data for rs6971 genotype improves the abili ty of 3H -PBR28 to detect differences in 
TSPO density ( Kreisl  et al, 2013). This simple strategy of TSPO genotype correction to PET 
imaging will be used in the present study.  
This will be the first trial to assess in vivo changes in TSPO following a treatment aimed to 
reduce microglia activation. As such it will be an exploratory, ancillary, study. Previous PET studies looking at baseline increases of microglia activation in HD patients compared to normal 
volunteers have found significant differences even in small groups of patients (11 HD vs 10 
normal volunteers, striatal differences in TSPO binding p=0.001). 
Not all benzodiazepines have been tested for TSPO binding. Patients taking benzodiazepines 
should be instructed to stop taking them for 3 days prior to having the PET scan. 
8.2.4.1. Collection  of Genotyping Samples 
Genomic DNA will be collected at the screening visit as described in Section  8.3.1 and used to 
genotype the rs6971 polymorphism within the TSPO gene on chromosome 22q13.2 ( Owen et al, 
2011; Kreisl  et al, 2013) . 
Patients who have A/A genotype for rs6971 polymorphism on the TSPO gene, which has been 
shown to result in low affinity binding (LAB) of the 
11C-PBR28  radioligand, will be excluded 
from the PET ancillary study. Patients with LAB for TSPO can participate in the main study even if they are excluded from the PET ancillary study. Patients with G/G and A/G rs6971 genotype have been shown to have high (HAB) and mixed (MAB) affinity binding, respectively, and will be included in the PET ancillary study. 
8.2.4.2. Scanning Procedures  
For women of child -bearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed on the same day, 
and prior to, the PET scan at Imperial Colle ge in London. If the result of thi s test is positive, the 
PET procedure will not be performed and the patient will be monitored as outlined in 
Section  7.2.  
Specific activity, chemical purity, and radiochemical p urity of 
11C-PBR28 will be determined by 
radio high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with a gamma detector. Specific activity will be determined by counting an aliquot in a dose calibrator and determining the mass by HPLC against a calibrat ion curve of the cold standard. Identity will be confirmed by co-
injecting the standard.  
Approximately 400 MBq of 
11C-PBR28 as intravenous bolus will be injected, and an 
approximately 90 minutes emission PET- CT scan will be acquired on a Siemens HiRez 6 
PET/CTI scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlanger, Germany). A low dose CT scan of the head 
will be performed immediately before each PET study for subsequent attenuation and scatter 
correction  of PET signal . Imaging data will be reconstructed with filter backprojection (direct 
inversion Fourier transform) with a 128 matrix, a zoom of 2.6, a transaxial Gaussian filter of 5 mm, scatter correction and attenuation correction. All subjects will have a volumetric T1 -
weighted MR sequence for co -registration purpose wi th PET images.  
Patients will be advised that they should not participate in further research studies involving ionizing radiation for a year following the last performed scan.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
117 8.3. Pharmacogenomic Variables  
It is recognized that genomic variation within the po pulation can be an important contributory 
factor to inter -individual differences in drug response. Pharmacogenomic (PGx) studies 
investigate the association between genetic sequence polymorphisms and/or gene expression 
signatures and clinical response to a certain therapeutic intervention. It may help explaining 
inter-individual variability and subsequently identify population subgroups that respond 
differently to the drug. Furthermore, regulatory guidance and white papers indicate that PGx 
analyses employi ng DNA collected from all study participants may support investigation of 
unexpected adverse events.  
In order to allow any subsequent analyses, appropriate samples will be requested from all patients in the study. PGx assessment will include CAG repeats an alysis in huntingtin gene and 
might also include other DNA variations and RNA expression patterns potentially associated with clinical treatment responses to laquinimod (e.g. clinical effect, pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety features or disease s usceptibility and severity features). The final list of 
genes that might be investigated will be selected in a later stage before the analysis so as to allow updating with new scientific information. Genomic analysis could also include a sequencing of the whole genome if required. 
PGx assessment will be performed if variability in response measurements is observed and 
attributable to genomic parameters. Samples might be used for investigations related to CNS disorders diseases and/or response to laquinimod or related investigational drugs.  
8.3.1. Methods and Timing of Pharmacogenomic Blood Sampling  
PGx assessment will be performed using blood samples.  
• Blood samples for DNA extraction will be collected at screening  (or if not possible, at 
the next possible visit) in two  5.0 mL  K3 EDTA Vacutainer plastic tubes  (or 
equivalent).  
• Blood samples for gene expression analysis (RNA extraction)  will be collected at 
baseline, Month 6 and Month 12 from all subjects in PAXgene RNA 10  mL tubes (or 
equivalent). 
PGx samples will b e stored for a period of up to 15 years from patient last visit in the main study 
and then destroyed. 
8.3.2. Shipment of Samples  
PGx samples will be stored at -70ºC (if -70ºC storage is not possible at the site, store at -20ºC) 
and sent to the central laboratory on dry ice. Following DNA and RNA extractions, the samples will be stored at–70ºC and labeled with a new code, so genomic data will not be recorded with subject number or initials. Data will be kept confidential and stored separately. 
The PGx sample analys es will be performed if and when required. Since new PGx techniques 
continue to be developed, we cannot anticipate the method and laboratory that will be 
recommended for the DNA/RNA analysis.

118 9. STATISTICS  
9.1. Study Design and Randomization  
This is a double- blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of laquinimod (0.5 mg  and 1.0 mg qd) treatment in patients with HD. Prior to 
10 January  2016, eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment with laq uinimod 
at a dosage of 0.5 mg , 1.0 mg , or 1.5 mg /day or a matching placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio . 
Randomization will be as described in Section  3.3. 
As of 10 January 2016, following a decision to discontinue treatme nt of the laquinimod 1.5 mg 
dose arm, future eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive laquinimod 0.5 
mg/day  or 1.0 mg/day or matching placebo for 52 weeks.  
No change was performed to the original randomization list except that the patient numbers assigned to laquinimod 1.5 mg/day were removed from the list by the IRT vendor. Patients and 
investigators will remain blinded to treatment assignment during the study.  
All patients who  discontinued the 1.5 mg/day dose have been unblinded. No attempts will be 
made to re-randomize patients whose 1.5 mg treatment was stopped to a lower dose of 
laquinimod. The remaining ongoing patients retained their originally randomized treatment assignments . 
9.2. Sample Size and Power Considerations  
The study a ims to detect potential beneficial effects in deteriorating  clinical signs and symptoms. 
Based on previous studies in patients with HD, the UHDRS-TMS has been shown to be one of 
the more sensitive clinical measures to detect decline in symptoms of HD. It is estimated that 
approximately 100 patients per arm will enable a power of 80% to detect a beneficial effect 
compared to placebo, of 2.5 points or more in the change from baseline in UHDRS-TMS of an active laquinimod arm, assuming SD of 6.2 and type I error of 5%.  
As the intention is to investigate laquinimod as a treatment with the potential to slow disease progression and prohibit neuronal death in the CNS, the study should also be sized to be able to 
detect changes in brain atrophy rate after treatment w ith laquinimod. One of the most sensitive 
measures to detect brain atrophy over time in patients with HD is change in the caudate volume.  
It is estimated that approximately 100 patients per arm will enable a power of 80% to detect a 
beneficial effect of 0 .95 (30% of the estimated decline in placebo) or more in the percent change 
from baseline in caudate brain atrophy of an active laquinimod arm compared to placebo, 
assuming SD of 2.36 and type I error of 5%. 
9.3. Analysis Sets/Populations  
Due to the decision f rom 10 January  2016 to discontinue treatment of the laquinimod 1.5 mg 
dose arm, and the low number of enrolled patients  compared to the target  at this time, data from 
the laquinimod 1.5 mg dose arm will be presented descriptively only and will not be included in 
any inferential analyses for efficacy or safety.

9.6.2. Planned Method of Analysis  
The full analysis set (see Section  9.3) will be used for all efficacy analyses. Summaries will be 
presented by treatment group .  
9.6.2.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis 
The change from baseline in UHDRS -TMS , will be analyzed using a Repeated Measures model 
(SAS® MIXED procedure with REPEATED sub -command). The model will include the 
following fixed effects: categorical week in trial by treatment interaction, center, and 
UHDRS -TMS  at baseline. The unstructured covariance matrix for repeated observations within 
patients will be used. In case that the model will not converge, the Maximum-Likelihood (ML) estimation  method will be used instead of the default Restricted ML (REML). If the model still 
does not converge then a simpler covariance structures with less parameters will be used, 
according to the following order: Heterogeneous Autoregressive(1) [ARH(1)], Heter ogeneous 
Compound Symmetry (CSH), Autoregressive(1) [AR(1)], and Compound Symmetry (CS). The 
estimated mean  changes from baseline at the Month 12//Early Termination  visit will be 
compared between the active treatment arms and the placebo arm.  
The Hochberg’ s Step -Up method for multiple comparisons between treatment arms will be used 
to control inflation in type I error rate. 
9.6.2.2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints Analyses 
According to the hierarchical method to control inflation in type I error rate for multiple 
endpoints, a ny statistically significant dose that will be observed in the primary analysis will 
continue to be tested for the secondary endpoints at an alpha level of 5%, according to the secondary endpoints order. 
The secondary efficacy  endpoints: change from  baseline in HD- CAB total score and change 
from baseline in UHDRS- TFC, will be analyzed in the same way as the primary efficacy 
endpoint except that the efficacy endpoint evaluation at baseline will be included in the model 
instead of baseline UHDRS -TMS.   
The CIBIC -Plus will be analyzed in the same way as the primary efficacy endpoint except that 
the baseline CI BIS ( Clinician’s Interview -Based Impression of Severity) will be included in the 
model as the efficacy measure at baseline.  
The percent change from  baseline to Month 12/Early Termination  in caudate volume will be 
analyzed using an Analysis Of Covariance (ANCOVA) model (SAS® MIXED procedure). The model will include the following fixed effects: treatment, center, and caudate volume at baseline. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
122 The est imated means at the Month 12 visit will be compared between the active treatment arms 
and the placebo arm. Early terminated patient observation will have their Last Observation 
Carried Forward (LOCF).  
9.6.2.3. Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints Analyses 
The exploratory efficacy  endpoints will be analyzed in the same way as the primary efficacy 
endpoint except that the efficacy endpoint evaluation at baseline will be included in the model instead of baseline UHDRS -TMS . 
The change from baseline to Month 12/Early Termination of continuous efficacy endpoints that 
are measured at baseline and at month 12 only, will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model 
(SAS® MIXED procedure). The model will include the following fixed effects: treatment, center, and the efficacy measure at baseli ne. The estimated means at the Month 12 visit will be 
compared between the active treatment arms and the placebo arm. Early terminated patient observation will have their Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF). 
9.6.2.4. Sensitivity Analysis  
No sensitivity analyses  are planned for this study.  
9.6.2.5. Pooling of Small Centers 
Centers with low number of patients will be pooled according to geographical region. 
Details will be provided in the Statistical Analyses Plan (SAP).  
The pooled center variable will be used in all statistical models that include center as covariate.  
9.7. Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity  
The Hochberg’s Step- Up method for multiple comparisons between treatment arms in 
combination with the hierarchical method between the primary efficacy endpoint and the 
secondary efficacy endpoints, will be used to maintain the experiment wise type I error of 5% 
level.  First, the Hochberg method will be applied for the comparisons of the 2 active doses  to 
placebo in the primary endpoint analysis. Then, using the hierarchic al method, any statistically 
significant dose will continue to be tested for the secondary endpoints at an alpha level of 5% 
and according to the order of the secondary endpoints. 
9.8. Safety Variables and Analysis  
9.8.1. Safety Variables

Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
123 Tolerability variables:  
• Proportion of subjects (%) who prematurely discontinued from the study, reason of 
discontinuation and the time to ET 
• Proportion of subjects (%) who prematurely discontinued from the study due to AEs 
and the time to ET  
9.8.2. Safety Analysis 
All adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) . Each patient will be counted only once in each preferred term or system organ cl ass 
(SOC) category for the analyses of safety . Summaries will be presented for all adverse events 
(overall and by severity), adverse events determined by the investigator to be related to study treatment (ie, reasonable possibility; see Section  7.1.4) (defined as related or with missing 
relationship) (overall and by severity), serious adverse events, and adverse events causing 
withdrawal from the study. Summaries will be presented by treatment group and for all pa tients . 
Patient listings of serious adverse events and adverse events leading to withdrawal will be presented . 
Changes in laboratory and vital signs measurement data will be summarized descriptively . All 
values will be compared with  prespecified boundaries to identify potentially clinically significant 
changes or values, and such values will be listed.  
The use of concomitant medications will be summarized by therapeutic class using descriptive 
statistics . Concomitant medications will include all medications  taken while the patient is treated 
with study drug. 
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, standard error, 
median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided for actual values and changes from baseline 
to each time poin t. For categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will be provided. 
Descriptive summaries of serious adverse events, patient withdrawals due to adverse events, and 
potentially clinically significant abnormal values (clinical laboratory or vital signs) based on 
predefined criteria will also be provided. 
If any patient dies during the study, a listing of deaths will be provided and all relevant 
information will be discussed in the patient narrative included in the clinical study report.  
9.9. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analysis 
9.9.1. Pharmacokinetics (PK) Ancillary Study  
 
PK samples of laquinimod and its metabolites will be collected from approximately 15 patients per each of the three continuing treatment groups (at selected sites at Month 1), for a total of approximately 45 patients. Additionally, PK samples were collected from 2 patients in the laquinimod 1.5 mg/day treatment group when the treatment was stopped; no further PK samples will be collected from the laquinimod 1.5 mg/day treat ment group.  
Samples will be collected at pre -dose, 15, 30 min and 1, 2, 3, 6 and 24 hours post dose.  
Steady state pharmacokinetic parameters  for laquinimod  (AUC
tau, Cmax and C min, tmax), will be 
calculated for each patient.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
124 Additional parameters for laquinimod and pharmacokinetic parameters for its metabolites may 
be calculated if data permit.  
The time of the previous dose as well as deviations from the blood sampling times will be 
recorded in the appropriate eCRF. Patients  performing the 24 hours PK profile will com e to the 
clinic after an overnight fast (minimum of 8 hours) and will be given breakfast 4 hours after drug administration.  
The morning dose and the 24 hours dose administration (the day after) will take place at the clinic.  
9.9.2. Population PK (PPK) Study  
A sin gle blood sample will be collected from all patients at months 1 , 3, 6 and 12 for evaluation 
of laquinimod and its metabolites .  
Pharmacokinetics of laquinimod will be evaluated using a Population PK approach. The effect of covariates on the PK of laquinimod will be evaluated. Possible covariates will include demographic variables ( e.g. age, gender, body weight and ethnicity), clinical variables ( e.g. CAG 
repeat length ), concomitant medications, blood and urine chemistry variables and markers of 
renal function (creatinine clearance and serum creatinine).  
Pharmacokinetic parameters for laquinimod metabolites may be calculated if data permit.  
The PPK model may also include any unscheduled pharmacokinetic samples collected to assist with further investigations of cardiovascular events or other clinical event of interest  for safety  
(see Section 8.1). 
The date and time of the blood sample, as well as the date and time of the last study drug dose 
prior to the sample will be recorded on the eCRF. 
9.10. Planned Interim Ana lysis 
No interim analysis is planned for this study. 
9.11. Reporting Deviations from the Statistical Plan  
Deviations from the statistical plan, along with the reasons for the deviations, will be described 
in protocol amendments, the complete statistical plan, th e clinical study report, or any 
combination of these, as appropriate. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
125 10. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS   
The medical experts, study monitors, auditors, IEC/IRB, and health authority inspectors (or their 
agents) will be given direct access to source data and documentation ( e.g., medical 
charts/records, laboratory test results, printouts, videotapes) for source data verification, provided 
that patient confidentiality is maintained in accordance with local requirements.  
Each  investigator must maintain , at all times,  the original records (ie, source documents) of each 
patient’s dat a. Examples of source documents are hospital records, office visit records, 
examining physician’s finding or notes, consultant’s written opinion or notes, laboratory reports, 
drug inventory, study drug label records, diary data, protocol required worksheets, and CRFs that 
are used as the source (see Section  3.9).  
Each  investigator will maintain a confidential patient identification list that allows the 
unambiguous identification of each patient. All study -related documents must be kept until 
notification by the sponsor.

Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
126 11. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE   
11.1. Protocol Amendments and Protocol Deviations and Violations  
11.1.1. Protocol Amendments   
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written 
approval or favorable opinion of a written amendment by the IEC/IRB and local competent  
authorities as applicable , except when necessary to address immediate safety concerns to the 
patients or when the change involves only logistics or administration. The principal investigator and the sponsor will sign the protocol amendment .  
11.1.2. Protocol Deviations  
Any significant deviation from the protocol will be considered a protocol violation. Protocol violation s include nonadherence on the part of the patient, the investigator, or the sponsor to 
protocol- specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary objective variable criteria, or GCP 
guidelines; noncompliance to study drug administration; use of prohibited medications; or any other deviations that may have an impact on the processes put in place for the care and safety of the patients . Protocol violations will be identified and recorded by investigational center  
personnel on the CRF. All protocol violations will be reported to the responsible IEC/IRB , as 
required. 
When a protocol violation is reported, the sponsor will determine whether to discontinue the 
patient from the study or permit the patient to continue in the study,  with documented approval 
from the medical representative . The decision will be based on ensuring the safety of the patient 
and preserving the integrity of the study.  
Deviations from the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the protocol are not prospectively granted by 
the sponsor. If investigational center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol 
eligibility criteria was entered into a study, they must immediately inform the sponsor of the 
protocol violation. If such patient has already complet ed the study or has withdrawn early, no 
action will be taken but the violation will be recorded. 
11.2. Information to Study Personnel  
The investigator is responsible for giving information about the study to all staff members involved in the study or in any element of patient management, both before starting the study and 
during the course of the study ( e.g., when new staff become involved). The investigator must 
assure that all study staff members are qualified by education, experience, and training to 
perform their specific responsibilities . These study staff members must be listed on the 
investigational center  authorization form, which includes a clear description of each staff 
member’s responsibilities . This list must be updated throughout the study, as neces sary.  
The study monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to all study staff, including the 
investigator, and for ensuring they comply with the protocol. Additional information will be made available during the study when new staff become involved  in the study and as otherwise 
agreed upon with either the investigator or the study monitor. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
127 11.3. Study Monitoring  
To ensure compliance with GCP guidelines, the study monitor or representative is responsible 
for ensuring that patients have signed the informed consent form and the study is conducted 
according to applicable SOPs, the protocol, and other written instructions and regulatory guidelines. 
The study monitor is the primary association between the sponsor and the investigator. The main 
responsibilities of the study monitor are to visit the  investigator before, during, and after the 
study to ensure adherence to the protocol, that all data are correctly and completely recorded and 
reported, and that informed consent is obtained and recorded for all patients before they 
participate in the study and when changes to the consent form are warranted, in accordance with IEC/IRB  approvals. 
The study monitor will contact the  investigator and visit the investigational center  at regular 
intervals throughout the study. The study monitor will be permitted to check and verify the various records (CRFs and other pertinent source data records, to include specific electronic 
source documentation [see Section  3.9]) relating to the s tudy to verify adherence to the protocol 
and to ensure the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data being recorded. If 
electronic CRFs are used for the study, the study monitor will indicate verification by electronically applying source documen t verification (SDV) flags to the CRF and will ensure that 
all required electronic signatures are being implemented accordingly.  
As part of the supervision of study progress, other sponsor personnel may, on request, accompany the study monitor on visits to  the investigational center . The investigator  and 
assisting staff must agree to cooperate with the study monitor to resolve any problems, errors, or 
possible misunderstandings concerning the findings detected in the course of these monitoring visits and/or provided in follow-up written communication. 
11.4. Clinical Product Complaints  
A clinical product complaint is defined as a problem or potential problem with the physical quality or characteristics of clinical drug supplies and/or clinical device supplies used in a clinical research study sponsored by Teva. Examples of a product complaint include but are not limited to the following:  
• suspected contamination 
• questionable stability (eg, color change, flaking, crumbling, etc.) 
• defective components  
• missing or extra  units (eg, primary container is received at the site with more or less 
than the designated number of units inside) 
• incorrect packaging or incorrect or missing labeling/labels  
• unexpected or unanticipated taste or odor or both 
• device not working correctly or appears defective in some manner  
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
128 Each investigational center will be responsible for reporting a possible clinical product complaint 
by completing the Product Complaint Form provided by Teva and emailing it to 
 within 48 hours of becoming aware of the issue. 
For complaints involving a device or other retrievable item, it is required that the device (or item) be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. For complaints 
involving a drug product, all relevant samples (eg, the remainder of the patient’s drug supply) should be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible.  
11.4.1. Product Complaint Information Needed from the Investigational Center  
In the event that the Product C omplaint Form cannot be completed, the investigator will obtain 
the following information, as available: 
• investigational center number and principal investigator name  
• name, phone number, and address of the source of the complaint  
• clinical protocol number 
• patient identifier (patient study number) and corresponding visit numbers, if 
applicable  
• product name and strength for open- label studies  
• patient number, bottle, and kit numbers (if applicable) for double-blind or open- label 
studies 
• product available for r eturn Yes/No  
• product was taken or used according to protocol Yes/No 
• description or nature of complaint 
• associated serious adverse event Yes/No  
• clinical supplies unblinded (for blinded studies) Yes/No 
• date and name of person receiving the complaint  
Note: R eporting a complaint must not be delayed because not all the required information can be 
immediately obtained. Known information must be immediately reported. The sponsor will 
collaborate with the investigator to obtain any outstanding information. 
11.4.2. Handlin g the Study Drug at the Investigational Center 
The investigator is responsible for retaining the product in question in a location separate from 
the investigator’s clinical study supplies. The sponsor may request that the investigator return the 
product for further evaluation and/or analysis. If this is necessary, the clinical study monitor or 
designee will provide the information needed for returning the study drug. 
If it is determined that the investigational center must return all of the study drug, the sponsor 
will provide the information needed to handle the return. 
The integrity of the randomization code and corresponding blinded clinical supplies will be 
maintained whenever possible. A serious adverse event or the potential for a product quality 

 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 0 4 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
129 problem existing beyond the scope of the complaint may be a reason to unblind the clinical 
supplies for an affected patient. 
11.4.3. Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Associated with a Product Complaint  
If there is an adverse event or serious adverse event, the protocol should be followed. 
11.4.4. Documenting a Product Complaint  
The investigator will record a description of the product complaint in the source documentation 
as well as any actions taken to resolve the complaint and to preserve the safety of the patient. 
Once the complaint has been investigated by the sponsor and the investigator, if necessary, an 
event closure letter may be sent to the investigational center where the complaint originated or to all investigational centers using the product.  
11.5. Audit and Inspec tion  
The sponsor may audit the investigational center  to evaluate study conduct and compliance with 
protocols, SOPs, GCPs, and applicable regulatory requirements. The sponsor Global Clinical 
Quality Assurance department, independent of t he Global Clinical Development department , is 
responsible for determining the need for (and timing of) an investigational center  audit. 
Each investigator must accept that regulatory authorities and sponsor representatives may 
conduct inspections to verify compliance with GCP guidelines.

130 12. ETHICS  
12.1. Informed Consent  
The investigator, or a qualified person designated by the investigator, should fully inform the 
patient of all pertinent aspects of the study, including the written information approved by the 
IEC/IRB . Written informe d consent will be obtained from each patient before any study -specific 
procedures or assessments are done and after the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and 
potential hazards are explained, according to the IEC/IRB requirements . The patient’s 
willingness to participate in the study will be documented in writing in a consent form, which will be signed and personally dated by the patient. Patients  with a legal guardian should be 
consented  according to local requirements.  
Patients participating in ancillary studies will provide written informed consent specific to that study.  
The investigator will keep the original consent forms, and copies will be given to the patients . It 
will also be explained to the patients that they are free to refuse entry into the s tudy and free to 
withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to future treatment.  
Written and/or oral information about the study in a language understood by the patient will be given to all patients.  
12.2. Health Authorities and Independent Ethics Com mittees/Institutional 
Review Boards  
Before this study starts, the protocol will be submitted to the national/local health authorities and to each IEC/IRB for review . As required, the study will not start at a given investigational center  
before the IEC/IR B and health authority (where applicable) for the center give written approval 
or a favorable opinion. 
12.3. Confidentiality Regarding Study Patients  
The investigator must assure that the privacy of the patients, including their personal identity and all person al medical information, will be maintained at all times . In CRFs and other documents 
or image material submitted to the sponsor, patients will be identified not by their names, but by an identification code (eg, initials and identification number). 
Personal medical information may be reviewed for the purpose of patient safety and/or verifying 
data recorded on the CRF . This review may be conducted by the study monitor, properly 
authorized persons on behalf of the sponsor, the quality assurance unit, and/or regulatory 
authorities . Personal medical information will always be treated as confidential.

132 13. DATA HANDLING, DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE, AND 
RECORD KEEPING   
13.1. Data Collection   
Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically designed for this study.  The data collected 
on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management system (CDMS) that meets the 
technical requirements described in 21 CFR part 11. Before used to capture data from this study, 
the CDMS will be fully validated to ensure that it meets the scientific, regulatory, and logistical requirements of the study. Before using the CDMS, all users will receive training on the system 
and any study- specific training.  Subsequent to the training, the users will be provided with 
individual system access rights. 
Data will be collected at the study center by appropriately designated and trained personnel, and 
CRFs must be completed for each patient who provided informed consent according to the data 
source.  The patient’s identity should not be discernible from the data provided on the CRF. Data 
will be verified using the data source by the study monitor, and reviewed for consistency by Data 
Management using both automated logical checks and manual review. All data collected will be 
approved by the investigator at the study center.  This approval acknowledges the investigator’s 
review and acceptance of the data as being complete and accurate.   
If data are processed from other institutions ( e.g., central laboratory, central image center, 
electronic diary data),  the results should be sent to the study center , where they are retained but 
not entered into the CRF. T hese results may also be sent electronically to the sponsor (or 
organization performing data management) for direct entry into the clinical database (see Section  3.9). Laboratory test results will not be added to the CRF unless otherwise noted in the 
protocol.  
For patients who enter a study but do not meet screening criteria, at a minimum, data for screen 
failure reason , demography, and adverse events from the time of informed consent will be 
entered into the CRF.  
13.2. Data Quality Assurance   
Data Management is responsible for the accuracy, quality, completeness, and internal 
consistency of the data from this study. Data han dling, including data quality assurance, will 
comply with worldwide regulatory guidelines (e.g. , ICH, GCP).  Data management and control 
processes specific to this study, along with all steps and actions taken regarding data 
management and data quality assurance, will be described in a data management plan.  
CRFs received will be processed and reviewed for completeness, consistency, and the presence of mandatory values. Applicable terms will be coded according to the coding conventions for 
this study.  Logical  checks will be implemented to ensure data quality and accuracy.  Any 
necessary changes will be made in the clinical database, and data review and validation 
procedures will be repeated ad needed.  Data from external sources will be compared with the 
informa tion available in the CDMS. Discrepancies found will be queried.

133 Data corrections in the CDMS will be made using the CDMS update function. For each instance 
of data modifications, the system requires a reason for the change.  The system keeps a complete 
audit trail of the data values, dates and times of modifications, and authorized electronic 
approvals of the changes. 
At the conclusion of the study, the CDMS and all other study data will be locked to further 
additions or corrections. Locking the study data represents the acknowledgement that all data have been captured and confirmed as accurate.  
13.3. Archiving of Case Report Forms and Source Documents   
13.3.1. Investigator Responsibilities   
All records related to the study (ie, source data, source documents, CRFs [ Sectio n 3.9] , data 
results from other institutions [see  Section  13.1] , copies of protocols and protocol amendments, 
drug accountability forms, correspondence, patient identification lists, signed informed consent 
forms, and other essential documents) must be retained until the sponsor notifies the institution, 
in writing, that records may be destroyed.  
If the sponsor has not provided written notification of records destruction after 10 years from 
study completion (or earlier in the case of an institution closing), and the institution determines 
the study record retention is unduly burdensome, the institution may submit a written request to the sponsor at least 60 days before the planned disposition of the study records. No study 
document or image ( e.g., scan, radiograph, ECG tracing) should be destroyed without prior 
written agreement between the sponsor and each investigator. Should an investigator wish to 
assign the study records to another party or move them to another location, advance written notice will be given to the sponsor. 
13.3.2. Sponsor Responsibilities   
The sponsor will be responsible for the processing and quality control of the data. Data 
management and filing will be ca rried out as described in the sponsor’s SOPs for clinical studies. 
If data management and filing of documents for this study are delegated to a contract organization, these functions will be carried out as described in the SOPs for clinical studies at that organization. These SOPs will be reviewed by the sponsor prior to the start of data 
management and filing activities.  The original CRFs will be archived by the sponsor. 
Center -specific CRFs will be provided to the respective study centers for archiving.

136 16. SUMMARY OF CHANGES FOR PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS  
16.1. GLOBAL PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 04 DATED 16 FEBRUARY 
2016 
The primary reason for this global amendment was to discontinue treatment for patients 
receiving 1.5  mg laquinimod as a proactive safety measure, and to implement additional saf ety 
measures to help ensure the safety of patients  (both ongoing patients  and those still to be 
enrolled) receiving 0.5 mg/day or 1.0 mg/day laquinimod or placebo. To avoid increased exposure to laquinimod, stopping rules have been introduced for renal impairment and hepatic 
impairment, with additional assessments of estimated creatinine clearance introduced for 
increased monitoring of renal function.  
Table 3 (Study Procedures and Assessments) has  been revised to re flect changes described 
below. An additional study schema ( Figure  2) has been included to reflect the amended study 
design. 
The statistical analysis sections were updated accordingly, and the risks and benefits sect ions of 
the protocol have also be en updated to reflect the new findings observed in the MS trials.  
Additional clarifications related to study conduct were implemented  in this amendment. These 
include (not all  inclusive) clarification s regarding determination of eligibility of patients with 
exclusionary variance from historical CAG repeat result s, testing of both troponin and CK- MB in 
case of creatine phosphokinase levels above the upper limit of the normal range to provide 
additional cardiovascular assessm ent, and adjustment of blood volume collected to allow for 
unscheduled visits. 
The revisions listed below have been made to the protocol (and protocol synopsis, as 
appropriate). A determination of which changes are considered to be substantial by the spons or’s 
Authorized Representative will be dependent on the region and will be indicated in the covering letter or application form that accompanies the amendment in that region.  
A comparison table showing substantive changes from Amendment 03 to Amendment 04 is 
provided below. Previous text is presented in the column titled “Original text with changes 
shown", and the revised or new text is presented in the column titled "New wording". Revised or new text is shown in bold italics  and deletions are shown in strikethrough. A few  formatting and 
editing changes have also been made but are not detailed below.  
Where appropriate, the informed consent form will be  amended to reflect the changes introduced 
into the protocol. 
The administrative letters #6 (dated 22 October 2015) and #7 (dated 05 November 2015) have 
also been added to the summary of changes section. The content of the administrative letters has 
been implemented in protocol Amendment 03 as applicable.

1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
Section 1. 1 
Laquinimod is developed by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. for 
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) , Crohn’s Disease (CD), and Systemic Lupus 
Erythematosus (SLE) and HD . The precise mechanism of action of 
laquinimod in MS is still under investigation. Available data support that 
laquinimod, is an immunomodulator that acts both on the peripheral immune 
system and within the central nervous system (CNS) on resident 
immunocompetent cells.  The data collected to date suggests that laquinimod 
(i) reduces the levels of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα; (ii) 
reduces inflammation within the CNS; (iii) down regulates genes involved 
in inflammation and antigen presentation; and (iv) modulates T cell 
responses via a direct effect on antigen presenting cells, and skews Laquinimod is de veloped by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, 
Ltd. for Multiple Sclerosis (MS)  and HD . The mechanism of 
action (MoA) of laquinimod includes modulation of the 
peripheral inflammation and central nervous system (CNS) -
resident inflammatory response resulting in down regulation 
of myelin and axonal damage. These effects are compatible 
with interference of NF -κB activation and may represent a 
novel protective mechanism which down regulates peripheral inflammation, CNS inflammation, tissue damage , and 
neurodegenerat ion in CNS diseases that involve microglia 
and astrocytic activation, like MS and HD. Recently The CD and SLE 
indications are no longer pursued.

mono cytes to a regulatory phenotype. The presumed mechanism by which 
laquinimod exerts this effect is down regulation of both astrocytic and 
microglial pro inflammatory response mediated by interference with the 
NFκB pathway, investigated in experimental auto immune 
encephalomyelitis (EAE) and the Cuprizone models of demyelination 
(Wegner et al, 201045; Bruck et al, 201246; Aharoni et al, 201247). The 
mechanism of action (MoA) of laquinimod includes modulation of the 
peripheral inflammation and central nervous system (CNS) -resident 
inflammatory response resulting in down regulation of myelin and axonal damage. These effects are compatible with interference of NF -κB 
activation and may represent a novel protective mechanism which down regulates peripheral inflammation, CNS inflammation, tissue damage , 
and neurodegeneration in CNS diseases that involve microglia and astrocytic activation, like MS and HD. Recently performed studies show 
that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway is involved in the 
efficacy of l aquinimod in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis 
(EAE) model. Further investigations are ongoing, assessing the role of AhR in the MoA of laquinimod.  
Further, laquinimod was shown to cause a weak decrease of CYP3A4 
activity and is a strong induce r of CYP1A enzymes. CYP1A induction is a 
biomarker of activation of the AhR transcription factor; activation of this pathway by laquinimod has been demonstrated.  
Studies investigating laquinimod’s mode of action have suggested that 
treatment with laquinimo d interferes with the NF kB pathway results in 
immunomodulation, including modulation of the cytokine balance and 
reduction of inflammation. Laquinimod is not a general immunosupressor, 
nor immunotoxic, but treatment with laquinimod results in a shift in t he 
cytokine balance towards reduced pro inflammatory cytokine production, 
induction of regulatory monocytes, reduced astrogliosis, and reduced 
infiltration to inflammatory target tissues, as demonstrated in animal models 
of MS and CD.  
... performed studies show that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor 
(AhR) pathway is involved in the efficacy of laquinimod in 
the experimental autoimmune encephalomyeliti s (EAE) 
model. Further investigations are ongoing, assessing the role 
of AhR in the MoA of laquinimod.  
Further, laquinimod was shown to cause a weak  decrease of 
CYP3A4 activity and is a strong inducer of CYP1A enzymes. CYP1A induction is a biomarker of act ivation of the AhR 
transcription factor; activation of this pathway by laquinimod has been demonstrated.

In addition, an increase in the incidence of oral cavity tumors was noted in 
mid and high dose females (2/60 in each group). The oral effects may relate 
to the AhR activation properties of laquinimod since similar lesions were seen 
following lifelong exposur e of rats to  with other AhR activators.  
However , the incidence of oral cavity tumors in rats treated with 
laquinimod was lower than that seen with industrial chemicals such as 
2,3,7,8- tetrachloro -p-dibenzodioxin (TCDD) (NTP TR -5211) and dioxin -
like compoun ds (DLCs), and was more similar to the incidence seen with 
the dietary ingredient indole -3-carbinol (I3C) found in cruciferous 
vegetables. Of note, the oral tumors seen with I3C were considered by the 
US National Toxicology Program as irrelevant for I3C ri sk assessment 
(NTP TR -5842). No increased incidence of oral tumors was seen in 
humans exposed to TCDD, indicating a species specific response in rats. Therefore, oral cavity tumors induced by laquinimod in rats after a lifelong exposure do not imply an ele vated carcinogenicity risk in humans. 
Humans, in general, also seem to be less sensitive to AhR activation by laquinimod than rats, as shown by the differential gene expression profiles 
discussed in the IB. , including industrial chemicals (such as 
2,3,7,8
tetrachlorodibenzo pdioxin  [TCDD] and dioxin like compounds [DLCs]) 
and the dietary ingredient indole 3carbinol (I3C) found in cruciferous 
vegetables. However, the incidence of oral cavity tumors in rats treated with 
laquinimod was lower than that seen with TCDD and DLCs, and was more 
similar to the incidence seen with I3C. Importantly, the oral cavity tumors 
seen with TCDD in rats did not translate into increased incidence of oral 
tumors in exposed humans, indicating a species difference in this response 
between rats and humans. It should be noted that several lines of evidence 
suggest that the oral lesions seen in rats are mediated by direct contact of the 
rat oral mucosa with high concentrations of laquinimod in the dosing 
solution during the gavage pro cedure. An effect on the oral mucosa in rats is 
not considered relevant to humans, who take laquinimod as a capsule that 
dissolves in the stomach. Based on sponsor’s calculations, in the human 
stomach, the local concentration of laquinimod is expected to be low, and 
the type of epithelium exposed is not considered sensitive to the effects of 
laquinimod, with safety margins greater than 13 (dogs), 20 (rats) and 1000 
(mice) for exposure in the stomach.  In addition, an increase in the incidence of oral cavity tumors 
was noted in mid and high dose females (2/60 in each group). 
The oral effects may relate to the AhR activation properties of laquinimod since similar lesions were seen 
following lifelong 
exposure  of rats to  other AhR activators. However , the 
inciden ce of oral cavity  tumors in rats treated with 
laquinimod was lower than that seen with industrial chemicals such as 2,3,7,8 -tetrachloro -p-dibenzodioxin (TCDD) (NTP

tumors was seen in humans exposed to TCDD, indicating a species specific response in rats. Therefore, oral cavity tumors induced by laquinimod in rats after a lifelong exposure do not

affected by moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (2.5 - and 3.1- fold 
increase in laquinimod systemic exposure, respectively,) and  strong 
CYP3A4 inducers and moderate hepatic impairment. Studies have shown that laquinimod is a strong inducer of CYP1A2 and a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4. Therefore, co -administration of laquinimod may affect the 
systemic exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP450 1A2 or CYP3A4.

Studies in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment resulted in an inc rease of laquinimod exposure by approximately 1.3 - and 2.3 -fold,

exposure was increased by 1.4- fold. A physiologically based 
pharmacokinetic model was further used to predict the effect of hepatic impairment and renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of laquinimod 
after single and multiple doses of 0.6 to 1.5 mg in comparison with healthy 
subjects (Study DP -2015 -017). The model predictions indicated that mild 
hepatic impairment and moder ate renal impairment would result in 
further modest increases in exposure to laquinimod following multiple 0.6 
mg dose administration based on unbound drug concentration (1.71 -fold 
and 1.65- fold, respectively). More significant increases in laquinimod 
exposure, in particular in terms of unbound drug fraction, are predicted in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (3.41 - and 6.51 -

(DSMB) was called by Teva to review and discuss the recommendations of 
the DMC for the CONCERTO and  ARPEGGIO MS trials and their 
implications on LEGATO -HD. The DSMB confirmed that no 
cardiovascular events had been observed to date for any dose of the 
LEGATO -HD trial and  concurred with the Sponsor’s recommendation 
that the high- dose ( ie, 1.5 mg) arm in t his trial be discontinued as a 
proactive safety measure. The DSMB approved the continuation of the 0.5 
mg/day and 1.0  mg/day arms with enhanced monitoring and safety

Section 2.1  
The purpose  of this Phase II clinical study is to investigate the efficacy and 
safety of multiple doses of laquinimod (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5  mg/day) as a 
potential treatment for patients with Huntington's disease (HD).  
As no drug is currently available to treat HD disease  progression, the st udy 
will be placebo controlled.  
Prior to 10 January  2016, a total of 400 patients were planned to be 
equally randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio (100 patients within each treatment arm) to receive laquinimod 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 mg/day, or matching placebo for 
52 weeks.  As of 10 January 2016, following the decision to discontinue treatment of  
the laquinimod 1.5 mg dose arm, additional eligible patients who are enrolled will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive laquinimod 0.5 mg/day, 1.0 mg/day,  or matching placebo for 52 weeks.  Approximately 300 
patients (100 patients within each study arm), plus the 30 patients who 
were already randomized to the laquinimod 1.5 mg treatment arm, are 
planned to be enrolled in the study.

3 STUDY DESIGN  
Section 3. 1 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
parallel -group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of laquinimod 
treatment at dosages of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mg/day in adults with Huntington’s 
Disease.  
The study will c onsist of a screening period (2 week s up to 5 weeks), 
followed by a 52- week double -blind treatment period and a follow -up visit 
(one month after end of treatment). Prior to 10 January  2016 , A a total of 
400 patients are were  planned to be equally randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio 
(100 patients within each treatment arm) to receive laquinimod 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 mg/day, or matching placebo for 52 weeks. A total of 123 patients were 
randomized prior to 10 January 2016.  
As of 10 January 2016, following the decision to discontinue treatment of  
the laquinimod 1.5 mg dose arm, additional eligible patients who are 
enrolled will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive laquinimod 0.5 
mg/day, 1.0 mg/day, or matching placebo for 52 weeks.  Approximately 300 This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled, parallel- group study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of laquinimod treatment at dosages of 0.5,

DATED 24 SEPTEMBER 2015 
The primary reason for this amendment is to update study eligibility requirements (i.e. shorter 
washout period from previous investigational product ) and clarify various aspects of study 
conduct (i.e. option of MRI scan at screening was introducted and frequency of several scales was reduced to lessen patient burden, etc.) . 
The revisions listed below have been made to the protocol, as appropriate, and are considered 
substantial by the sponsor’s Authorized Representative.   
A comparison table showing substantive changes from Amendment 02 to Amendment 03 is 
provided below. Previous text is presented in the column titled “Original text with changes 
shown",” and the revised or new text is presented in the column titled "new wording". Revised or new text is shown in bold italics  and deletions are shown in strikethrough. Few formatting 
changes have also been made but are not detailed below.  
Changes to the synopsis are not detailed in the table but have been made according to the corresponding changes in the body of the protocol. 
Where appropriate, the informed consent form will be amended to reflect the changes introduced 
into the protocol. 
The administrative letters issued since the release of Amendment 02 have been added to the 
summary of changes section. Also, although already mentioned in the amendment history page, 
the administrative letters preceding Amendment 02 have also been added for revision history tracking purposes, in line with current Teva standards.

Human chorionic gonadotropin (β -hCG) serum test will be performed 
for all women of childbearing potential (women who are not post 
menopausal  or who have not undergone surgical sterilization) at 
screening (Visit 1) and at all subsequent study visits. An 
indeterminate reading for the serum pregnancy test should be checked 
twice (urine test) and the patient referred to a gynecologist if 
required;  Age-appropriate normal ranges for HCG should be used.  
If the reading for the serum pregnancy test is indeterminate,  the test 
should be repeated after 3- 4 days to see whether there is  an increase 
in β-hCG or whether it is a stable elevation. If no increase is 
observed, the patient will not be considered to be pregnant. 
However,  no study drug will be administered until this is resolved.  
 
Urine β -hCG tests will be performed for all wome n of childbearing 
potential at baseline (Visit 2), and at all subsequent visits, and if

191 16.8. SUMMARY OF CHANGES FOR PROTOCOL AMENDMENT 02  
DATED 16 FEBRUARY 2015 
 
The revisions listed below have been made to the protocol, as appropriate, and are considered substantial by the sponsor’s Authorized Representative.  
The primary reason for this amendment is to  update study eligibility requirements  and clarify 
various aspects of study conduct. An inclusion criterion requiring documentation of prior 
positive genetic testing for HD, or a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic HD (Diagnostic 
Confidence Level 4), was introduced. Also, the range of the CAG repeat length required for study eligibility  was expanded  (lower cut- off of 36 instead of 40).  
During the IND process of Laquinimod for Huntington’s disease trial, the FDA commented that given that laquinimod 0.6 mg/day leads to a 5 - fold reduction in the systemic concentration of 
caffeine, a cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 1A2 probe substrate, an even larger effect on CYP1A2 may 
be observed when the higher doses of 1.0 mg and 1.5 mg planned in the H untington's Disease 
trial are administered. The FDA recommended that in view of this potential increased effect of laquinimod on the pharmacokinetics of CYP1A2 substrates, use of drugs metabolized by 
CYP1A2 should be avoided during the trial. Based on this recommendation, Teva has decided to 
modify all laquinimod protocols in which higher doses of laquinimod than 0.6 mg/day are administered and updated the guidance regarding the co -administration of laquinimod and drugs 
that are mainly metabolized by CYP1A2. 
In addition, following the LAQ- MS-305 (CONCERTO) Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) 
recommendation, this amendment includes a requirement to perform abdominal computed 
tomography (CT) as soon as possible when pancreatitis is suspected. Evaluation of pancrea titis is 
important in order to enable adequate or better medical treatment/care.  The complete guidance 
for monitoring subjects with elevated pancreatic amylase levels were added to Appendix A. 
Typographical errors have been corrected throughout the protocol.  
Previous changes to the protocol include the Global Amendment 01 following VHP assessment 
and the local UK amendment s for the PET sub-stud y. 
Substantive changes from the Local UK Amendment 01 to the Global Amendment 02 are provided below.

1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
Section 1. 1 (Other sections affected by this change: 1.3.1)  
Further, laquinimod was shown to cause a marked dec rease 
of CYP3A4 activity and is a potent inducer of CYP1A 
enzymes. CYP1A induction is a biomarker of activation of the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) transcription factor; 
activation of this pathway by laquinimod has been 
demonstrated.  Further, laquinimod  was shown to cause a marked  decrease of 
CYP3A4 activity and is a potent inducer of CYP1A enzymes. CYP1A induction is a biomarker of activation of the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) transcription factor; activation of this 
pathway by laquinimod has been demonstrated.  Laquinimod 0.6  mg/day and 
1.2 mg/day increased the 
systemic exposure of midazolam (a sensitive 
CYP3A4 substrate) by 1.5 
and 1.7 fold, respectively ; 
therefore laquinimod is considered a weak CYP3A4 
inhibitor . 
Section 1.3.1  
Finally, a small in crease in the incidence of oral cavity 
squamous cell carcinomas was noted in mid and high dose female rats (2/60 in each group). It is the sponsor’s position that this finding is likely a result of direct contact of the rat oral mucosa with high concentrations of laquinimod in the dosing solution.  
Although the mechanism leading to the local effect is 
unknown, the possibility that the local effect may relate to the AhR activation by laquinimod cannot be excluded. Oral cavity tumors have been observed in rat  carcinogenicity 
studies for some AhR agonists, but the incidence rate of these tumors was higher than the incidence rate observed 
for laquinimod. Regardless of the mechanism underlying Finally, a small increase in the incidence of oral cavity squamous 
cell carcinomas was noted in mid and high dose female rats (2/6 0 in 
each group). It is the sponsor’s position that this finding is likely a 
result of direct contact of the rat oral mucosa with high 
concentrations of laquinimod in the dosing solution.  
Although the mechanism leading to the local effect is unknown , the 
possibility that the local effect may relate to the AhR activation by 
laquinimod cannot be excluded. Oral cavity tumors have been 
observed in rat carcinogenicity studies for some AhR agonists, but 
the incidence rate of these tumors was higher than the incidence rate 
observed for laquinimod. Regardless of the mechanism underlying

activation, a local effect on the rat oral mucosa is not considered Clarification regarding oral

this local effect, whether non -specific cytotoxicity or local 
AhR activation, a local effect on the rat oral mucosa is not 
considered relevant to humans who take laquinimod as a 
capsule that dissolves in the stomach . Based on sponsor’s 
calculations, in the human stomach, the local concentration 
of laquinimod is expected to b e low and the type of 
epithelium exposed is not considered sensitive to the effects of laquinimod, with large safety margins . relevant to humans who take laquinimod as a cap sule that dissolves 
in the stomach . Based on sponsor’s calculations, in the human 
stomach, the local concentration of laquinimod is expected to be low 
and the type of epithelium exposed is not considered sensitive to the 
effects of laquinimod, with large s afety margins . 
In addition, an increase in the incidence of oral cavity tumors was noted in mid and high dose females (2/60 in each group). The oral effects may relate to the AhR activation properties of laquinimod 
since similar lesions were seen with other AhR activators, 
including industrial chemicals (such as 2,3,7,8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-
p-dioxin
 [TCDD]  and dioxin -like compounds [DLCs]) and the 
dietary ingredient indole -3-carbinol (I3C) found in cruciferous 
vegetables. However, the incidence of oral cavity tumors in rats treated with laquinimod was lower than that seen with TCDD and 
DLCs, and was more similar to the incidence seen with I3C. 
Importantly, the oral cavity tumors seen with TCDD in rats did not translate into increased incidence of oral tumors in exposed humans, indicating a species difference in this response between rats and humans. It should be noted that several lines of evidence 
suggest that the oral lesions seen in rats are mediated by direct 
contact of the rat oral mucosa with high concentrations of laquinimod in the dosing solution during the gavage procedure. An effect on the oral mucosa in rats is not considered relevant to 
humans, who take laquinimod as a capsule that dissolves in the stomach . Based on sponsor’s calculations, in the human stomach, 
the local concentration of laquinimod is expected to be low, and the type of epithelium exposed is not considered sensitive to the effects of laquinimod, with safety margins greater than 13 (dogs), 
20 (rats) and 1000 (mice) for exposure in the stomach.  
Section 1.3.2.1  
Laquinimod is considered to have high oral bioavailability 
with linear, time independent and predictable PK that is characterized by high plasma protein binding (>98%), high 
oral bioavailability (~90%), low oral clearance (~0.09 L/h), 
low apparent volume of distribution (~10 L), and long half -
life (~80 h). Absorption under fasting conditions is rapid and maximal plasma levels attained generally within 1 
hour after  laquinimod administration. Concomitant Laquinimod is considered to have high oral bioavailability with 
linear, time independent and predictable PK that is characterized by high plasma protein binding (>98%), high oral bioav ailability 
(~90%), low oral clearance (~0.09 L/h), low apparent volume of distribution (~10 L), and long half -life (~80 h). Absorption under 
fasting conditions is rapid and maximal plasma levels attained generally within 1 hour after laquinimod administrat ion.

approximately 5 hours and reduction of  the maximum 
plasma concentration (C max) by 30%. Food however did not 
significantly affect the overall extent of absorption AUC.  
 
Laquinimod is extensively metabolized predominantly by 
CYP3A4. Laquinimod metabolites levels in plasma are 
very low and parent  laquinimod is the main systemically 
circulating entity. Laquinimod PK is affected by moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, strong CYP3A4 inducers and moderate hepatic impairment. Laquinimod 0.6 and 1.2 mg dose is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a strong 
inducer of CYP1A2.

Plasma levels of drugs that are CYP1A2 substrates may decrease 
when combined with laquinimod and within 30 days after the last 
laquinimod dose, rendering these drugs less effective.   In general, it is recommended to avoid the use of CYP1A2 subst rates in clinical trials of laquinimod. Therapeutic alternatives

5.3.2 Allowed Medications/Therapies During Study  
Clinical studies have shown laquinimod 0.6  mg/day to be a 
potent inducer of CYP1A2. Subjects taking drugs that are metabolized by CYP1A2 (examples listed in Appendix C ) shoul d be advised that plasma levels of these drugs may 
need dose adjustment and more frequent clinical monitoring when treatment with laquinimod is initiated or 
stopped.  
 
Drug -Drug interaction studies have been performed with 
the laquinimod doses of 0.6 mg/day  and 1.2 mg/day dose. 
These studies show that laquinimod at both doses is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4. Subjects taking drugs that are 
metabolized by CYP3A4 (specifically those with a Narrow 
Therapeutic Index (listed in Appendix C) should be advised that pla sma levels of these drugs could increase 
when combined with laquinimod.  5.3.2 Allowed Medications/Therapies During Study  Other 
Concomitant Medications  
Clinical studies have shown laquinimod 0.6  mg/day to be a potent 
inducer of CYP1A2. Subjects taking drug s that are metabolized by 
CYP1A2 (examples listed in Appendix C) should be advised that 
plasma levels of these drugs may need dose adjustment and more 
frequent clinical monitoring when treatment with laquinimod is 
initiated or stopped.  
 
Drug Drug interacti on studies have been performed with the 
laquinimod doses of 0.6 mg/day and 1.2  mg/day dose. These studies 
show that laquinimod at both doses is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4. 
Subjects taking drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4 (specifically 
those with a Narrow Therapeutic Index (listed in Appendix C) 
should be advised that plasma levels of these drugs could increase 
when combined with laquinimod.  
 Studies have shown that laquinimod is a strong inducer of CYP1A2 and a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4. Therefore, co-
administration of laquinimod may affect the systemic exposure of 
drugs metabolized by CYP450 1A2 or CYP3A4.  
5.3.2.1 CYP1A2  
Laquinimod 0.6 mg/day reduces the systemic exposure of caffeine 
(a compound mainly metabolized by CYP1A2) 5- fold.  Laquinimod 
doses high er than 0.6 mg/day may further increase CYP1A2 
induction and decrease exposure of CYP1A2 substrates.  
Plasma levels of drugs that are CYP1A2 substrates may decrease when combined with laquinimod. Also, during a period of 30 days following the last laquinim od dose these CYP1A2 substrates are 
potentially less effective due to decreased plasma levels.  Revised subsection 
regarding laquinimod possible effect on CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 substrates and partial lists of such drugs .

Table 7, appendix C presents a partial list of drugs that are mainly 
metabolized by CYP1A2, i.e. CYP1A2 plays a major role in their 
biotransformation. The syst emic exposure of these drugs is 
expected to be significantly reduced by laquinimod co-administration. Drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP1A2 and have a narrow therapeutic index are of special concern and appear in bolded text.  
In general, as a precau tionary measure, it is recommended to 
avoid the use of CYP1A2 substrates in clinical trials of laquinimod. Therapeutic alternatives may be considered in the appropriate clinical context.  
 5.3.2.2. CYP3A4  
Laquinimod 0.6 mg/day increases the systemic exposure of 
midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) 1.5 -fold and for the 1.2 
mg/day dose 1.7 fold.  Therefore, plasma levels of drugs that are 
CYP3A4 substrates may increase when combined with laquinimod.  
Patients taking drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4, spec ifically 
those with a Narrow Therapeutic Index (Appendix C) should be advised that plasma levels of these drugs could increase when 
combined with laquinimod.   
6 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
Section 6.2.1 (Other sections affected by this change: 17)  
Participants will undergo MRI at baselin e and Month 12.  
Change in whole -brain, caudate and ventricular volume 
over the scanning interval will be calculated using the Boundary Shift Integral (BSI) technique (Freeborough
 and 
Fox, 1997, Leung et al, 2010). This is an intensity -driven 
technique wit hin the MIDAS software (Freeborough et al, 
1997) which measures change over time in the brain directly from within -subject registered (aligned) MR scan 
pairs. This technique has been optimised to provide robust measures of brain -volume change from multi -site data  
(Freeborough
 and Fox, 1997) and has been shown to be 
sensitive to HD -related pathology over a 12- month interval 
in the multi -site TRACK -HD study (Tabrizi et al, 2011). 
Imaging methods will follow those described within the Participants will undergo  3T MRI at baseline and Month 12 
following unaccelerated volumetric T1 -weighted acquisition 
protocols developed during the ADNI study (www.adni -info.org) .  
Change in whole brain,  caudate and ventricular  volume over the 
scanning interval will be calculated using the Boundary Shift 
Integral (BSI) technique ( Hobbs et al, 2009,  Freeborough and Fox, 
1997 Leung et al, 2010). Change in whole brain and ventricular volume will also be calculated using this approach (see section 6.3.1). This The BSI  is an intensity -
driven technique within the 
MIDAS so ftware (Freeborough et al, 1997) which measures change

provide robust measures of brain -volume change from multi -site 
data (Freebor ough and Fox, 1997 Leung et al, 2010 ) and has been Updated text to reflect use of 
ADNI parameters instead of the TRACK -HD parameters.

and will be described in detail in a separate imaging 
manual. In brief, all images will undergo intensity 
normalisation using the N3 software (Sled et al, 1998, Boyes et al, 2008). The brain will be delineated at baseline and follow -up using MIDAS software (Freeborough et al, 
1997 ). Within -subject scan pairs will be registered with 12 
degrees -of-freedom and change in whole -brain volume 
estimated using the Brain BSI (BBSI). Change in caudate volume will be estimated using the  caudate BSI (CBSI) 
(Hobbs et al, 2009) which involves delineation of the baseline caudates and an additional local rigid registration of the baseline and follow -up scans to achieve more 
accurate alignment of the caudates, prior to application of 
the BSI a lgorithm. The ventricles will be delineated at 
baseline and follow -up, after which the Ventricular BSI 
(VBSI) will be applied to estimate change in ventricular 
volume (Freeborough and Fox, 1997).  
White -matter volume change will be computed using 
methods de scribed within the TRACK -HD study (Tabrizi 
et al, 2011 Tabrizi et al, 2012) and will be described in 
detail in a separate imaging manual. In brief, voxel -level 
volume change will be estimated using a fluid registration approach, which generates voxel -compr ession maps for 
each participant. These maps will be convolved with the 
native -space baseline white -matter segmentation generated 
using unified segmentation within SPM8 
(www fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), to provide an estimate of white -matter volume change.  
All segmentations and registrations will be visually 
checked by trained analysts to ensure accuracy. 
Longitudinal change in caudate, whole -brain and white -
matter volume will be expressed as a percentage of their 
baseline value. Longitudinal change in ventricular volume will be expressed in absolute terms (ml).  
MRI scans may be evaluated locally for any incidental pathology (ie, pathology unrelated to, or inconsistent with, 
the subject’s known HD) according to locally determined shown to be sensitive to HD -related pathology over a 12 -month 
interval in the multi -site TRACK -HD study (Tabrizi et al, 2011). 
Details of how the BSI has been implemented for this study are described in the  Imaging Review Charter.

but are not limited to the following:  
• suspected contamination  
• questionable stability (eg, color change, flaking, crumbling, etc.)  
• defective components  
• missing or extra units (eg, primary container is 
received at the site with more or less than the designate d number of units inside)

labeling/labels  
• unexpected or unanticipated taste or odor or both  
• device not working correctly or appears defective in 
some manner  
Each investigational center will be responsible for rep orting a 
possible clinical product complaint by completing the Product Complaint Form provided by Teva and emailing it to 
 within 48 hours of 
becoming aware of the issue. For complaints involving a device or other re trievable item, it is 
required that the device (or item) be sent back to the sponsor for 
investigative testing whenever possible. For complaints involving a 
drug product, all relevant samples (eg, the remainder of the patient’s drug supply) should be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible.  11.4.1. Product Complaint Information Needed from the 
Investigational Center  
In the event that the Product Complaint Form cannot be 
completed, the investigator will obtain the following info rmation, 
as available:  
• investigational center number and principal 
investigator name  
• name, phone number, and address of the source of 
the complaint  
• clinical protocol number  
• patient identifier (patient study number) and corresponding visit numbers, if appl icable  
• product name and strength for open -label studies  
• patient number, bottle, and kit numbers (if applicable) for double -blind or open -label studies  
• product available for return Yes/No 
• product was taken or used according to protocol Yes/No  
• description or  nature of complaint  
• associated serious adverse event Yes/No

the required information can be immediately obtained. Known 
information must be immediately reported. The sponsor will 
collaborate with the investigator to obtain any outstanding information.  
11.4.2 Handling the Study Drug at the Investigational Center  
The investigator is responsi ble for retaining the product in 
question in a location separate from the investigator’s clinical 
study supplies. The sponsor may request that the investigator 
return the product for further evaluation and/or analysis. If this is necessary, the clinical st udy monitor or designee will provide the 
information needed for returning the study drug.  
If it is determined that the investigational center must return all of 
the study drug, the sponsor will provide the information needed to 
handle the return.  
The integ rity of the randomization code and corresponding blinded 
clinical supplies will be maintained whenever possible. A serious adverse event or the potential for a product quality problem existing beyond the scope of the complaint may be a reason to 
unblind the clinical supplies for an affected patient.  
 
11.4.3. Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Associated with a Product Complaint  
If there is an adverse event or serious adverse event, the protocol should be followed.  
 11.4.4. Documenting a Product Complaint  
The investigator will record a description of the product complaint in the source documentation as well as any actions taken to resolve the complaint and to preserve the safety of the patient. Once the complaint has been investigated by the sponsor and the 
investigator, if necessary, an event closure letter may be sent to the investigational center where the complaint originated or to all 
investigational centers using the product.

The patients will undergo MRI scans at Baseline and Month 12 or 
Early Termination.  The scans will be obtained according to a 
standard protocol that will be provided by the Imaging CRO 
(iCRO).  The scans wi ll be sent to the iCRO for approval and 
processing.   
MRI scan will be performed using the following schedule:  
• Month 0/Baseline:  as soon as possible after eligibility has 
been confirmed but not less than 7 days prior to baseline.  
• Month 12: up to 7 days prior to the Month 12 visit.  
• Early Termination: as soon as possible, but not more than 
7 days after discontinuation of study drug.   
Note that the first MRI scan will be performed at least 7 days prior to the baseline visit to enable image approval and to set the reference for comparison to subsequent MRIs.  
If a patient terminates within 3 months of the baseline visit, they will not undergo an Early Termination scan.   
MRI facilities will undergo a qualification procedure, which will include the acquisition of a healthy volunteer dummy run to ensure that the implementation of the standard sequences on their system produces appropriate images for measuring the endpoints 
specified in the protocol.  The healthy volunteer must sign an ethics 
committee -approved informed consent.  The scans will be reviewed 
by the MRI facility and a report will be given to the healthy 
volunteer.  Qualification of sites will be formally indicated by an Addition of appendix  
detailing MRI procedures.

approval certification.  Sites must be qualified prior to the first 
patient inclusion.   
Detailed instructions are provided in the Site Operations Guide.  
Confidential patient information such as patient full name must be 
omitted from the scan header, the compact disc labels, and any accompanying documentation.  MRI scans will be transferred to 
the iCRO in electronic format, or when not possible, by courier.  
The procedure for sending electronic data and accompanying 
documentations is specified in the Site Operations Guide.  
The iCRO will perform quality control checks of all images 
received. If both  scans from one visit fail QC, the scan will need to 
be repeated. If the baseline scan fails QC, rescanning of the 
patient should be performed as soon as possible, prior to randomization . In case s of a failed QC at all other visits, the 
window for rescanni ng will be no longer than 2 weeks . Images 
should be reviewed, by the site, at the time of acquisition so that any sequences affected by obvious artifacts can be repeated immediately.   
MRI scans are to be evaluated locally for any incidental pathology 
(ie, pathology unrelated to, or inconsistent with, the patient’s 
known HD) according to locally determined procedures.  If such 
pathology is found, the Treating Neurologist should be notified.  
The iCRO will evaluate the scans for the purposes of performing 
quant itative analyses.  In order not to compromise the blinding of 
the study, the iCRO will not report results from the quantitative 
analyses back to the clinical site.

The 18 -kDa TSPO is expressed within microglia and 
macrophages and has been used as a target for PET 
ligands to study neurodegenerative disease processes 
that involve microglial activation, such as HD, Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Politis et al, 2012)
41 The PET radioligand 11C-PK11195 
has been used most frequently for this purpose, but signal quantification is limited by poor specific signal-
to-background ratio.  At sel ected sites, patients will be referred to the Imperial College 
in London, where PET Imaging will be performed at the 
Imanova Imaging Centre on the Hammersmith Hospital site. 
The PET imaging will be performed at baseline and after 
treatment with laquinimod over a 12– month period of time.  
 All patients participating in the PET arm of the study will be exposed to additional ionizing radiation due to the PET/CT scans. There are no alternatives methods available to explore 
neuroinflammtion in vivo. While any ion izing radiation 
exposure increases the risk of future malignancy, for the 
radiation exposure in this study such exposure is small and the increased risk is minimal. Patients who recently took part in clinical studies or underwent medical procedures involving ionizing radiation, such that participation in this study would 
lead to an exposure of >10mSv in the last 12 months, will be 
excluded from participation in this ancillary study. This will not affect the patient's participation in the main study.

  Specific activity, chemical purity, and radiochemical purity of 
11C-PBR28 will be determined by radio high 
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled 
with a gamma detector. Specific activity will be 
determined by counting an aliquot in a dose c alibrator 
and determining the mass by HPLC against a calibration curve of the cold standard. Identity will be confirmed by co-injecting the standard.  
 
Approximately 600 MBq of 
11C-PBR28 as intravenous 
bolus will be injected, and a two -hour emission scan w ill 
be acquired on a Siemens HiRez 6 PET/CTI scanner 
(Siemens Healthcare, Erlanger, Germany). A low dose CTI scan will be performed immediately before each 
PET study for subsequent attenuation and scatter 
correction. Imaging data will be reconstructed with  filter 
backprojection (direct inversion Fourier transform) with a 128 matrix, a zoom of 2.6, a transaxial Gaussian filter of 5 mm, scatter correction and attenuation correction. All subjects will have a volumetric T1 -weighted MR 
sequence for co -registration purpose with PET images.  For women of child bearing potential, a urine pregnancy test 
will be performed on the same day, and prior to, the PET scan  
at Imperial College in London. If the result of this test is positive, the PET procedure will not be perf ormed and the 
patient will be monitored as outlined in Section 7.2 .

The sponsor should be notified of the event prior  
to breaking of the code , if possible. If this is not 
possible, the sponsor should be notified immediately afterwards, and the patient’s drug 
code assignment should not be revealed.  In case of a serious adverse event, pregnancy, or in cases when 
knowledge  of the study drug assignment is needed to make treatment 
decisions, the investigator may unblind the patient’s drug assignment as deemed necessary, mainly in emergency situations. Individual treatment 
codes, indicating the treatment randomization for each  randomized 
patient, will be available to the investigator(s) or pharmacist(s) at the 
study center via the IR T, both via telephone and  internet .  
If possible , the sponsor should be notified of the event prior to breaking

study visit.  
In any case of elevated ALT or AST to a level exceeding of  ≥2xULN (including subjects whose 
baseline ALT or AST levels are ≥2x and ≤3x the ULN, who may be enrolled in the study), a 
thorough medical history and physical examination with a focus on liver disease should be undertaken
5. In addition, the subject should be instructed to refrain from alcoholic beverages.  
In case of symptoms compatible with drug-induced liver injury, the subject should be invited for an unscheduled visit to measure liver enzymes as soon as possible. 
Solitary elevations of total bilirubin , not accompanied by elevations of ALT or AST should be 
managed according to the discretion of the Treating Physician.  
1.1. Elevation of Either ALT or AST to ≥3 x ULN:  
Confirmation of the abnormality (in case the abnormality is of ALT or AST ≥ 8 times the ULN, 
no confirmation is required prior to study drug discontinuation, but the assessments below should 
be performed):  
• The day in which the abnormal value is received from the laboratory will be 
considered as Day  0. 
• The Investigator should repeat the test before Day 2, for confirmation purposes (this may be performed in a local laboratory along with CBC and differential to assess for eosinophilia. In general, in case a blood sample is sent to a local laboratory, the following assessments [and reference ranges] are mandatory: ALT [serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase;  SGPT], AST [serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase; 
SGOT], ALP, total bilirubin, CBC [with differential for eosinophil count, separate tube], and INR [separate tube; not to be sent in a confirmatory test]). The investigator should also question the subject regarding symptoms. 
The abnormality will be regarded as confirmed in each of the following scenarios: 
1. In case baseline value was within normal range and ALT or AST is still ≥3xULN  
2. In case baseline value was above ULN and ALT or AST is ≥2 times the baseline value.  
Upon confirmation of the abnormality as noted above, the following additional evaluations 
should be performed and results should be recorded in the eCRF. 
 
                                                 
4 In case total bilirubin is >ULN, then direct bilirubin will be checked.  
5 Thorough medical history with a focus on l iver disease: Personal or family history of liver disease; personal history 
of a systemic disease with potential liver involvement; exposure to alcohol, medications (prescription or OTC), 
herbal preparations, dietary supplements, recreational drugs, special diets or environmental chemical agents; 
potential exposure to infectious agents (eg, travel to developing countries, history of potential exposure to blood or 
blood products, high -risk sexual relations) and any additional information deemed relevant by t he investigator.  
Physical examination – including signs of chronic liver diseas e. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 04 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
237 Additional Tests/Evaluations  
• Serology for Hepatitis A  (antibody, immunoglobulin M and G), B (core antibody 
total, core immunoglobulin M, and surface antigen), and C viruses (central 
laboratory).  
• Serology for autoimmune hepatitis: anti-nuclear antibodies (titer) , ASMA (Anti 
Smooth Muscle Antibodies), anti- LKM (Liver Kidney Microsomal) antibodies 
(central laboratory).  Further testing may be required in case of a positive result for 
Hepatitis B or C.  
• An ultrasound examination of the liver and biliary tract. 
• Other diagnostic tests/consultations, as deemed necessary by the investigator e.g. 
serology for hepatitis E virus in case of travel to endemic geography)  
Observation and Follow-Up (to be performed after the abnormality was confirmed as above)  
1.1.1. ALT or AST ≥3x (>3.5x ULN if baseline value is >2.5xULN) but less than 
5xULN  
In addition to the above procedures required for any elevation to levels >3xULN: 
• ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, total and direct bilirubin, CBC and differential (to assess for 
eosinophilia) and INR should be monitored on days 5 (±2), 8 (±2), 14 (±3), and 28 
(±3). On at least 1 of these days, the test should be performed centrally. (INR should 
be sent to a local laboratory only.) 
• In cases where a local laboratory is used, the results should be recorded in the eCRF, 
accompanied by the reference range of the relevant measurements.  
• Should the abnormality (≥3xULN in case baseline within normal range or ≥2xULN in 
case the baseline value was above ULN, but still <5xULN) persist further, the subject will be followed according to the investigator's discretion, but at least once a month a blood sample for ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, and total and direct bilirubin should be sent to the central laboratory.  
1.1.2. ALT or AST ≥5x but less than 8xULN  
In addition to the above procedures required for any elevation to levels >3xULN:  
• ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, total and direct bilirubin, CBC and differential count (to 
assess for eosinophilia), and INR should be monitored twice a week. 
• At least for every other measurement, the tests should be sent to the central 
laboratory. The rest of the tests may be sent to a local labo ratory. INR should always 
be sent to a local laboratory.  
1.1.3. ALT or AST ≥8xULN  
In addition to the above procedures required for any elevation to levels >3xULN:  
• The study drug should be discontinued immediately and the ETD visit should be 
performed.  
• For follow-up guidance, please see below section "Follow-Up of Liver Enzymes 
After Stopping- Rules Are Met ". 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 04 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
238 1.2.  Stopping Rules:  
In the following circumstances, the study drug will be discontinued immediately: 
• Any increase in ALT or AST to ≥3xULN, combined with INR >1.5 or total bilirubin 
>2xULN  
• Any increase in ALT or AST to ≥ 3xULN, which is accompanied by nausea, 
vomiting, fever, rash, or eosinophilia 
• Any increase in ALT or AST to levels ≥5x but <8xULN, which is persistent for 
≥2 weeks of repeated measurements  
• Any increase in ALT or AST to levels ≥8xULN  
• In any case where monit oring of liver enzymes cannot be performed according to the 
protocol guidance 
1.2.1. Follow- Up of Liver Enzymes After Stopping -Rules Are Met:  
• A subject who meets the above criteria for discontinuation of the study drug should 
be invited to the site to return the study drug. ETD visit activities should be 
performed as soon as possible. 
• Liver enzymes should be monitored until normalization or stabilization of the 
abnormality, according to the discretion of the investigator. 
• In any case, following ETD, the minimal follow -up period will be 30 days and will 
include measurement of liver enzymes at least once weekly (may be performed in a local laboratory, with at least 1 test being sent to the central laboratory).  
• Every effort should be made to complete the additional tests/ evaluations, as 
described above.  
2. Use of Moderate/Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors   
Laquinimod PK is affected by moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors; therefore, 
moderate/strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are disallowed during study and 30 days after the last dose 
has been administered. A partial list of commonly used CYP3A4 inhibitors is presented in 
Appendix B .  
3. Use of CYP3A4 Substrates with Narrow Therapeutic Index  
Plasma levels of drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates may incr ease when combined with 
laquinimod. Patients taking drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4, specifically those with a Narrow Therapeutic Index  (Table 6 in Appendix C )should be advised that plasma levels of these 
drugs could increase when combined with laquinimod.  
4. Use of CYP1A2 Substrates  
Plasma levels of drugs that are CYP1A2 substrates may decrease when combined with 
laquinimod and within 30 days after the last laquinimod dose, rendering these drugs less effective.  
In general, it is recommended to avoid the use of CYP1A2 substrates in clinical trials of laquinimod. Therapeutic alternatives may be considered in context. 
For additional information  on concomitant use of laquinimod with CYP1A2 substrates , please 
refer to Section 5.3.2.  
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 04 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
239 5. Management of Pregnancy and Pregnancy Testing During the Study  
Exposure to laquinimod during pregnancy should be avoided.  
Women of child- bearing potential (women who are not post menopausal or who have not 
undergone surgical sterilization) must practice an acceptable method of birth control for 30 days 
before taking the study treatment, and 2 acceptable methods of birth control during all study 
duration and until 30 days after the last dose of tr eatment was administered .  
Acceptable methods of birth control in this study include: Intrauterine device, barrier method 
(condom or diaphragm with spermicide) and hormonal methods of birth control (e.g. oral 
contraceptive, contraceptive patch, long- acting  injectable contraceptive).   
The patients' understanding of the importance of preventive pregnancy measures and their ability 
to follow the required instructions will be ascertained by the investigator and recorded in source 
documents at every visit. Any female patient who becomes pregnant during the study will discontinue her participation in the study and will not perform the activities described for scheduled follow-up visits. 
To further emphasize the importance of use of acceptable contraception and avoidance of 
pregnancy under laquinimod exposure, and to reduce as much as possible the exposure to 
laquinimod if a pregnancy occurs despite all recommended measures, the following measures 
will be taken: 
1. Female subjects of child -bearing potential (women who are not post menopausal or 
who have not undergone surgical sterilization) will be reminded at each study visit 
about: 
a. The importance of using acceptable contraception. 
The importance of immediately stopping the study drug and informing the site in any case of suspected pregnancy (following a positive urine test, absence of menstruation or any other reason suggesting pregnancy ). 
2. At each scheduled visit, female subjects of childbearing potential (women who are 
not post menopausal or who have not undergone sur gical sterilization)  will undergo a 
urine β -hCG test. In addition, a serum pregnancy β-hCG test will be performed at 
each visit.  
a. In case the the urine test is negative, study drugs will be dispensed according 
to planned visit tasks (see Table 3).  
i.  If the blood test is positive the subject will be contacted immediately 
and instructed to stop taking the study drug. The subject should be invited to attend an ETD visit.  
ii. If the blood test is negative – study procedures wi ll be undertaken as 
planned. 
b. In case the urine test is positive – the study drug will not be dispensed (if this 
occurs at baseline visit, the subject will not be eligible to participate in the study and will be considered as a screening failure)  
iii. If the blood test is positive, the subject will be invited to the site for an 
ETD visit  
iv. If the blood test is negative, the subject will be contacted and informed 
about the test result and the study drugs will be sent to her by courier as soon as possible. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 04 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
240 In case o f an established diagnosis of pregnancy, the Treating Physician/Neurologist should 
discuss with the subject the possible risk to the fetus, including the possibility of termination of 
the pregnancy. Subjects who become pregnant will be monitored for the ou tcome of the 
pregnancy (including spontaneous or voluntary termination). If the pregnancy continues to term, 
the outcome (health of the infant up to 8 weeks of age),  details of birth, and presence or absence 
of any birth defect, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and newborn complications, will be 
reported to the sponsor. Any complication of pregnancy during the study and any complication 
of pregnancy that the investigator becomes aware of after termination from the study will be 
reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event, as appropriate.  
1. Starting from Visit 3 (Month 1), the following actions will be taken: 
a. The subject will be provided with home pregnancy urine β -hCG test kits and will be 
guided how to perform the test.  
b. The subject will be instructed to perform the test in monthly intervals (every 28 (±2) days) from the visit date. These dates should be recorded by the study coordinator and a telephone call, will be scheduled to be performed within 72 hours of the urine test date.  
c. A mandatory phone call will be performed by the Treating Neurologist/ Physician or by the site’s nurse/ study coordinator every month in order to verify whether the test has been performed and to record the result of the test in the subject’s file. In case of a suspected pregnancy, the subject will be instructed to stop taking the study drug and arrive to the site as soon as possible for an unscheduled visit, with the remaining study medications. In the site, a quantitative urine β-hCG pregnancy test should be 
perform ed and the rest of the activities will be as in 2b.  
6. Cancer  
Patients who are diagnosed with malignant solid or liquid tumor while participating in the study 
should be discontinued from the study.  
7. Guidance on monitoring subjects with elevated pancreatic amylase levels  
Amylase and pancreatic amylase will be measured at each study visit.  
In any case of abnormal pancreatic amylase results to a level exceeding of ≥1×ULN the subject 
will be invited to an unscheduled visit to test lipase levels. Lipase will be tested on all follow up visits until normalization of pancreatic amylase levels.  
In case of suspected pancreatitis, the subject should undergo a thorough clinical evaluation 
including an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan as soon as possible in order to clarify 
the diagnosis and enable assessment of  severity of this condition. 
Neces sary medical procedures including repeat labs will be performed based on clinical needs 
determined by the treating physician’s judgement. 
8. Guidance on monitoring subjects with hemoglobin decrease  
The anemia panel is assessed at baseline and also at 1 sub sequent time point (with B12) if 
hemoglobin decrease of >1 g/dL from the patient’s hemoglobin level at baseline and the decrease 
is confirmed. 
 Placebo -Controlled Study – Huntington's Disease  
Clinical Study Protocol with Am 04 Study TV5600- CNS -20007 
241 • At baseline: B12, blood smear, serum iron, ferritin, total iron binding capacity, folic 
acid,  haptoglobin, IL -1, IL-6, interferon IFN- γ, TNF -α, and hepcidin. 
• In case of hemoglobin decrease of >1 g/dL from the patient’s hemoglobin level at baseline:  
− patient will be re -tested to confirm decrease  
− if decrease confirmed, a thorough anemia work -up will be done including: 
○ directed medical history and physical examination  
○ anemia panel (blood smear, serum iron, ferritin, total iron binding capacity, folic acid, haptoglobin, IL- 1, IL -6, IFN -γ, TNF -α, and hepcidin)  and B12  
○ additional investigations and follow-up per the investigator’s discretion or sponsor’s request 
Necessary medical procedures including repeat labs will be performed based on clinical needs determined by the treating physician’s judgement.  
9. Guidance on monitoring subjects with CPK increase  
• In case of CPK resul ts >ULN, troponin and creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CK -MB) 
will be tested by the central laboratory.  
• In case of CPK >10×ULN, an unscheduled visit to assess urine myoglobin will be required. The following blood tests will be repeated at the unscheduled visi t: CPK, 
blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, electrolytes including potassium, calcium, phosphate. 
10. Acute Coronary Syndrome, Myocardial Infarction or Any Major Cardiovascular Event 
Patients who experience acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction  or an y major 
cardiovascular event will permanently discontinue treatment with study medication.  Patients will 
be asked to continue all scheduled visits for safety assessment . 
11. Liver Impairment  
Patients who develop liver disease associated with liver functional impairment while 
participating in the study should stop study medication.  
12. Renal Impairment 
Patients who develop chronic renal disease associated with moderate -severe functional 
impairment, defined as estimated CrCl <60 mL/min/1.73 m
2, while participating in the study 
should stop study medication temporarily until normalization of renal function or confirmation of 
renal impairment diagnosis. In case moderate- severe renal impairment is diagnosed, the patient 
will permanently discontinue treatment with  study medication .

242 APPENDIX B.  LIST OF DISALLOWED M EDICATIONS PRIOR TO AND 
DURING STUDY  
Laquinimod pharmacokinetics are affected by moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors; 
moderate/strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are disallowed within 2 weeks of baseline until 30 days after the last dose has been administered.  
Moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are prohibited because concomitant administration is 
predicted to increase laquinimod exposure and may increase the likelihood of adverse events.

246 APPENDIX D. MAG NETIC RESONANCE IMAG ING  
The patients will undergo MRI scans at Baseline and Month 12 or Early Termination. The scans 
will be obtained according to a standard protocol that will be provided by the Imaging CRO 
(iCRO).  The scans will be sent to the iCRO for a pproval and processing.  
MRI scan will be performed using the following schedule: 
• Month 0/Baseline: as soon as possible after eligibility has been confirmed but not less than 7 days prior to baseline. 
• Month 12: up to 7 days prior to the Month 12 visit. 
• Early Termination: as soon as possible, but not more than 7 days after discontinuation of 
study drug .  
Note that the first MRI scan will be performed at least 7 days prior to the baseline visit to enable image approval and to set the reference for comparison to subsequent MRIs. 
If a patient terminates within 3 months of the baseline visit, they will not under go an Early 
Termination scan.  
MRI facilities will undergo a qualification procedure, which will include the acquisition of a 
healthy volunteer dummy run to ensure that the implementation of the standard sequences on 
their system produces appropriate images for measuring the endpoints specified in the protocol. 
The healthy volunteer must sign an ethics committee -approved informed consent. The scans will 
be reviewed by the MRI facility and a report will be given to the healthy volunteer.  Qualification 
of sites will be formally indicated by an approval certification.  Sites must be qualified prior to 
the first patient inclusion.   
Detailed instructions are provided in the Site Operations Guide.  
Confidential patient information such as patient full name must be omitted from the scan header, 
the compact disc labels, and any accompanying documentation.  MRI scans will be transferred to 
the iCRO in electronic format,  or when not possible, by courier. The procedure for sending 
electronic data and accompanying documentations is specified in the Site Operations Guide.  
The iCRO will perform quality control checks of all images received.  If both scans from one 
visit fail Q C, the scan will need to be repeated.  If the baseline scan fails QC, rescanning of the 
patient should be performed as soon as possible prior to randomization . In cases of failed QC at 
all other visits, the window for rescanning will be no longer than 2 we eks. Images should be 
reviewed, by the site, at the time of acquisition so that any sequences affected by obvious artifacts can be repeated immediately.   
MRI scans are to be evaluated locally for any incidental pathology (ie, pathology unrelated to, or inconsistent with, the patient’s known HD) according to locally determined procedures. If such 
pathology is found, the Treating Neurologist should be notified. The iCRO will evaluate the scans for the purposes of performing quantitative analyses. In order not to compromise the blinding of the study, the iCRO will not report results from the quantitative analyses back to the clinical site.

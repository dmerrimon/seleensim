INTRODUCTION
 
 
Transbronchial Lung Biopsy 
 
General Considerations
 
Transbronchial Lung Biopsy (TBLB) is one of the most important applications of flexible 
bronchoscopy. The procedure, initially introduced by Andersen in 1965 for use via a rigid 
bronchoscope 
(1)
, became more widely performed after it was adapted for use with the flexible 
bronchoscope in the early 1970s 
(2)
 
for the evaluation of localized as well as diffuse pulmonary 
disease. Today, TBLB is regularly performed by 69% of practicing physicians documented in a 
survey of 1,700 North American pulmonary and critical care physicians 
(3)
. This indispensable 
procedure, which may be performed under fluoroscopic guidance, constitutes a diagnostic 
alternative to percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy, thoracoscopy with forceps lung biopsy, 
and thoracotomy with open lung biopsy. Apart from m
astering the technique, the bronchoscopist 
must have a thorough understanding of indications, limitations, and immediate complications of 
the TBLB. When properly performed, several studies have established the safety of TBLB in an 
outpatient setting under 
moderate sedation 
(4,5)
. 
 
Biopsy forceps commonly used for TBLB via the flexible bronchoscope are generally of the order 
of 3 mm or smaller in any given dimension. Because of this restriction in size, tissue samples 
obtained via the transbronchial approach are generally 2
–
3 mm in a
ny dimension. Despite the 
small size, TBLB provides information regarding pathology that is located beyond the 
cartilaginous airways that may include elements of the small airways of the distal bronchial tree, 
the alveolar space, the vasculature, and lymph
atic structures immediately surrounding the alveoli 
(6)
. Pulmonary diseases that require examination of larger pieces of lung tissue to assess 
heterogeneity or homogeneity of different regions of the involved lung, such as many of the 
idiopathic interstitial lung diseases, are generally not amenable to diagnos
is by TBLB and 
consideration of video
-
assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy ,which has been shown to have a 
greater diagnostic yield 
(7,8)
, should be pursued. With these limitations in mind, TBLB is useful 
for the diagnosis of a variety of infectious, interstitial, and malignant pulmonary diseases, 
including pulmonary infiltrates in the immunocompromised host 
(9,10)
, sarcoidosis 
(11,12)
, 
eosinophilic lung disease 
(13,14)
, drug
-
induced pneumonitis 
(15)
, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis 
(16)
, lung cancer 
(17)
, pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis 
(18,19)
, and acute allograft 
rejection in lung transplant recipients 
(20,21)
. Absolute contraindications for TBLB include 
inability to obtain informed consent, severe or refractory hypoxemia, uncontrolled 
bronchospasm, and unstable cardiovascular condition, including active ischemia and 
uncontrolled arrhythmia. Relative contraindi
cations include uncorrected coagulopathy, platelet 
count of less than 50 K/μL, severe pulmonary hypertension, uncooperative patient, inability to 
control cough, and lack of resuscitation facilities 
(22,23)
. 
 
 
Technique
 
A thorough airway examination usually precedes the TBLB because bleeding after lung biopsy 
may preclude its performance. Adequate control of cough with topical application of lidocaine 
5
 
 
and systemic administration of opiates is recommended for optimal biopsy procedure and to 
reduce the risk of pneumothorax 
(24)
.
 
The choice of biopsy site depends on radiological and fluoroscopic findings. Generally, TBLB is 
not attempted from both lungs during the same bronchoscopic procedure on the same date due 
to risk of bilateral pneumothorax. For selection of the site for the 
TBLB in the case of diffuse lung 
disease, some providers prefer to perform the biopsy from the dependent parts of the lungs; 
right and left lower lobes 
(23)
. In an event of bleeding, the blood is more likely to remain 
contained in this area before spilling into the adjacent lobes 
(25)
. The procedure can be 
performed “blindly” or under fluoroscopic guidance when available. 
 
There is limited information on the optimal number of transbronchial biopsies in various lung 
disease. In general, four to six biopsy specimens are adequate in a majority of patients with 
diffuse lung disease 
(26)
. For acute graft rejection surveillance in lung and lung
-
heart transplant 
recipients, most transplant centers will obtain at least 5 and up to 10 biopsies per procedure 
(20,27)
.
 
 
Hemorrhagic Complications
 
TBLB is generally safe, although severe and life threatening procedure
-
related complications are 
occasionally encountered, most common among them are pneumothorax and procedure
-
related 
hemorrhage. Significant bleeding related to TBLB has been traditionally
 
attributed to laceration 
of a bronchial artery 
(28)
. Established risk factors for clinically significant bleeding following TBLB 
include bleeding diathesis including thrombocytopenia 
(29)
, use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant 
medications 
(30,31)
, pulmonary hypertension 
(32)
, advanced renal failure 
(33)
, and immune 
compromised state 
(34)
. The propensity to bleed following TBLB was also shown to be related to 
the type of forceps used with some evidence suggesting that bleeding complications are less 
common with alligator forceps as opposed to cup forceps 
(35,36)
. According to a recent 
retrospective population
-
based study from the USA incorporating data from almost 100,000 
patient visits involving TBLB, the overall rate for procedure
-
related clinically significant 
hemorrhage was 0.58% 
(37)
. Another survey from Japan reviewing over 100,000 procedures, 
among them 57,199 forceps biopsies, recorded a bleeding rate of 0.73% 
(38)
. Death related to 
airway bleeding in association with bronchoscopic procedures is exceedingly rare 
(39,40)
.
 
Quantification of TBLB
-
related bleeding is difficult, subjective, and prone to observer bias. 
Although not formally adopted, several grading systems have been suggested for the purpose of 
quantification of procedure
-
related hemorrhage. Most published studi
es use grading systems 
that rely on the amount of mixed blood and bronchial wash fluid in the vacuum suction system 
at the end of the procedure 
(5,38,41,42)
. This method may be prone to measurement errors in 
estimation of the actual extent of blood loss during the procedure due to dilution of blood with 
other airway secretions as well as fluid administered via the bronchoscope working channel such 
as saline. 
A recently published study exploring the safety of percutaneous bronchoscopy
-
guided 
tracheostomy in thoracic transplantation patients suggested a grading system that classifies 
endobronchial hemorrhage as mild, moderate, or severe based on the most proxima
l bronchus 
in the bronchial tree obstructed by the bleeding 
(43)
. Among the other grading scales described 
in the literature thus far, the one suggested by Herth et al. 
(44)
 
may have to most clinical 
relevance. This scale grades airway bleeding according to the action implemented by the 
6
 
 
operator in order to achieve hemostasis. Despite being the only scale to be implemented in a 
subsequent study 
(45)
, it seems that a bias may be introduced into this system by the fact that 
different operators may have different thresholds for implementation of various interventions in 
order to control hemorrhage. Indeed, there is lack of agreement in currently availab
le literature 
as to the best approach to achieve control over the bleeding lung. In general, one school of 
thought supports the wedging technique, first described by Zavala in 1975 
(46)
, where the 
bronchoscope is wedged into the bleeding bronchus in effort to allow enough time for a clot to 
form and at the same time prevent spillage of blood into the rest of the bronchial tree 
(23)
. The 
other main school of thought argues for a “back and forth” or “in and out” maneuver that 
includes positioning of the bronchoscope proximal to the bleeding bronchus and suctioning of 
blood as it emerges from the airway in order to avoid coagulation in
 
the airway, which can block 
the suctioning channel and also obscure vision 
(47)
. 
 
As mentioned above, the main danger of TBLB
-
related bleeding is aspiration of the blood into the 
non
-
involved bronchial tree rather than exsanguination. Therefore, priority should be given to 
prevention of flooding of the airways with blood. Fortunately, m
ost cases of major airway 
bleeding following TBLB can be managed in the bronchoscopy suite. Apart from positioning the 
bronchoscope in the airway as mentioned above, other measures to achieve hemostasis. These 
include placing the patient in a lateral decub
itus position with the bleeding lung in the dependent 
position and application of topical application of 4°C saline 
(48)
 
and/or vasopressors such as 
cocaine or diluted epinephrine 
(49,50)
. The dosing of topical epinephrine for the treatment of 
airway bleeding lacks standardization in terms of dilution and volume of instillation and is based 
mainly on individual operator experience and institutional protocols. Review of the literature 
revea
ls epinephrine dilution recommendations range from 1:10,000 to 1:100,000 and the volume 
of instillation ranges of 0.5 and up to 20 mL 
(22,50
–
52)
. The British Thoracic Society guidelines 
on diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy suggest small aliquots of 1:10,000 diluted epinephrine 
(49)
. 
Topical administration of tranexamic acid as a measure of achieving hemostasis was also 
previously described in case series 
(53,54)
. Bleeding refractory to conservative therapies may 
require balloon tamponade with application of an embolectomy balloon catheter via the 
bronchoscope’s working channel 
(23,49)
. Inability to control bleeding with those interventions 
should prompt securing the airway with endotracheal intubation. Additionally, selective 
intubation of the non
-
bleeding lung and application of an endobronchial blocker may be 
considered along with ad
vanced interventions such as selective bronchial artery embolization 
(55,56)
. 
 
Local practices in University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) for the initial treatment of 
endobronchial bleeding in the bronchoscopy suite includes administration of iced saline in 
aliquots of 5
-
10 mL followed by 1
-
2 mL aliquots of 1:10,000 topical epin
ephrine (0.1
-
0.2 mg) to a 
maximum of 6 mL (0.6 mg). Additional suggested measures include positioning the patient with 
the bleeding lung in the dependent position and balloon tamponade of the bleeding airway with 
application of a 2
-
4 FR embolectomy balloon
 
catheter (Edwards Lifesciences®) via the 
bronchoscope’s working channel before attempting more advanced methods to allow 
hemostasis.

The Role of Transbronchial Lung Biopsies in Lung Transplant Recipients
 
Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with multiple TBLB has become the “gold standard” diagnostic modality 
for the assessment of lung allograft function and specifically acute cellular rejection (ACR) 
following lung transplantation. Most lung transplant programs now pe
rform TBLB for graft 
function surveillance, new onset symptoms, ≥10% decrease in FEV1, assessment of a new lung 
infiltrate on chest imaging, or as a follow
-
up for acute rejection or CMV pneumonitis 
(57)
. Acute 
rejection is an established risk factor for the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome 
(BOS), and therefore it has been proposed that early detection and treatment is of paramount 
importance 
(58)
. The relatively high incidence of silent rejection or infection in asymptomatic 
patients has lent support for routine surveillance protocols 
(59,60)
. Surveillance protocols vary 
widely between transplantation centers since there is little data to guide the frequency of 
surveillance biopsies. The ACR surveillance protocol in UMMC includes routine bronchoscopy 
with TBLB at one
-
month post
-
transplant and 
then every three months for one year. Additional 
bronchoscopies with TBLB are performed based on surveillance TBLB findings, symptoms, or 
results of pulmonary function tests (PFT) 
(61)
. As in the general population, the most common 
complications of TBLB in lung transplant recipients are bleeding and pneumothorax. Generally, 
there is evidence that shows a higher propensity for procedure
-
related bleeding in the post lung 
and heart
-
lung tr
ansplant population. Once again, the recorded rate of clinically significant lung 
hemorrhage is highly dependent of the system adopted for grading of the amount of bleeding. 
In an early study by Chan et al., bronchoscopy data from 83 lung transplant recipi
ents was 
reviewed retrospectively. The rate of clinically significant procedure
-
related bleeding, defined 
arbitrarily as >50 mL blood loss was 1.9% 
(62)
. Scott et al. prospectively evaluated the yield and 
complications of TBLB in 219 procedures on combined heart
-
lung transplant patients. Blood was 
recovered by suctioning in approximately 44% of procedures, while the rate of >100 mL 
procedure related bleed
ing was recorded at 12.3% 
(20)
. Bjørtuft et al. studied the rate of TBLB
-
related bleeding in 104 procedures in 51 patients, 29 of whom were post lung or heart
-
lung 
transplantation. The rate of clinically significant bleeding, arbitrarily defined is more than 20 mL, 
was 7.7%. No differe
nce in the rate or volume of clinically significant bleeding was observed 
between transplant and non
-
transplant patients. Interestingly, screening platelet count and 
coagulation tests did not predict bleeding risk in this study 
(63)
. A prospective cohort study 
performed at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions between 1996 and 1997 evaluated bleeding 
complications among 38 bronchoscopies in 15 lung transplant recipients and compared them to 
659 bronchoscopies in 423 non
-
transplant p
atients. In this cohort, lung transplant recipients 
were shown to bleed significantly more, report post
-
procedure hemoptysis, and have their 
procedure terminated prematurely due to bleeding in comparison to the non
-
transplant patients. 
Bronchoscopy procedu
res, including those where TBLB was performed, were significantly longer 
in transplant recipients. In a logistic regression analysis, worse hemoptysis was associated with 
lung transplant status, older age, and longer procedure time. As in prior studies, bl
eeding risk 
was independent of platelet count, coagulation studies, use of aspirin, and use of 
immunosuppressive medications 
(64)
. The relation between risk of bleeding and procedure time 
might reflect a technically challenging procedure or in some cases prolongation of the procedure 
by attempt to control bleeding. Other possible explanations for the increased propensity to bleed 
am
ong lung transplant recipients include an already inflamed lung tissue from infection, ACR, or 
BOS or an increase in blood flow to the transplanted lung, particularly in recipients of single lung 
8
 
 
transplants. Evidence from transplantation centers outside the USA correlates with USA reported 
numbers. For example, a study in performed in a single institution in Japan recorded a bleeding 
rate of 11% among 206 procedures on 28 lung transplant recipient
s 
(65)
. Additional relevant 
studies include McWilliams, 2008 (includes additional citations: 1
-
5) and Smith, 2012.
 
 
Topical Epinephrine for Bleeding Prophylaxis
 
Epinephrine, also known as
 
adrenalin
 
or
 
adrenaline, is a non
-
selective agonist of all adrenergic 
receptors, including the major subtypes α1,
 
α2,
 
β1,
 
β2, and
 
β3. β
-
Adrenergic effects are more 
pronounced at low doses and α1
-
adrenergic effects at higher doses
. The rationale for the use of 
epinephrine for prevention, minimization, and control of superficial bleeding is derived from its 
vasoconstrictive effect on arterioles and capillaries, mediated via activation of α1 receptors on 
blood vessel smooth muscle 
(66)
.
 
Although adopted by some providers as means to reduced TBLB
-
related hemorrhage, the use of 
prophylactic instillation of diluted epinephrine into the target bronchus before attempting TBLB 
as means to reduce to occurrence of biopsy
-
associated bleeding is no
t established in the medical 
literature. Limited evidence from case series performed in a single institution suggest a beneficial 
effect of prophylactic injection of tranexamic acid into bleeding
-
prone endobronchial lesions 
such as tumors before attempting
 
endobronchial biopsies 
(67,68)
. 
 
The main body of evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of prophylactic topical epinephrine 
for the prevention of superficial hemorrhage is 
derived from the surgical literature, specifically 
endoscopic endonasal and sinus surgery, rhinoplasty, and surgical management of burn injuries. 
During functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) and rhinoplasy, common practice involves 
administration of t
opical vasoconstrictor in the form of 1:1,000 epinephrine
-
soaked neuropatties 
as well as intranasal injection of a mixed solution of local anesthetic and 1:100,000 epinephrine 
(69)
. A recent randomized controlled trial comparing cocaine
-
 
and epinephrine
-
soaked 
neuropatties in 37 patients found no significant difference in blood loss with cocaine as compared 
to epinephrine. In this study, no adverse effects associated with cocaine or
 
epinephrine were 
documented 
(70)
. A non
-
randomized trial comparing cocaine with epinephrine in 65 patients 
undergoing rhinoplasty showed similar results 
(71)
. The reported rate of cardiovascular 
complications associated with topical epinephrine in this patient population is 0.1% or less 
(72,73)
 
with no deaths reported. In a series of 1,998 patients undergoing endoscopic sinus 
surgery in which 1:1000 diluted topical epinephrine was used for hemostatic purposes, Orlandi 
et al.
 
reported two complications likely associated with the use of topical epinephrine (<0.1%). 
Once case involved ECG changes and the other case involved intraoperative hypertension due to 
inadvertent submucosal injection of the epinephrine solution 
(73)
. In a more recent prospective 
series of 19 patients undergoing the same surgery using epinephrine at the same dilution of 
1:1000, there were no documented cases of altered hemodynamics related to topical application 
of epinephrine 
(74)
. A study in 10 burn patients undergoing burn wound excision using 1:10000 
diluted epinephrine
-
soaked gauze wrappings, did not show a significant increase in 
intraoperative serum concentration of epinephrine to indicate systemic absorption 
(75)
. 
Nonetheless, a different study in burn patients has demonstrated that tachycardia was more 
common in burn patients undergoing surgery where 1:10,000 epinephrine
-
soaked gauzes were 
used 
(76)
. This finding can be related to the relatively large interface between the applied 
9
 
 
epinephrine and inflamed and injured vasculature in the surgical field of burn patients. One study 
reported benefit and a favorable side
-
effect profile of 1:10,000 epinephrine
-
soaked gauzes 
applied prophylactically  for hemostasis during laparoscopic chole
cystectomy 
(77)
.
 
 
Potential Adverse effects of Endotracheally
-
 
and Endobronchially
-
Administered Topical 
Epinephrine
 
Data concerning the systemic effects of endobronchially administered epinephrine are limited. 
Adverse hemodynamic effects of topical epinephrine are attributed to systemic absorption of 
epinephrine from the airways into the pulmonary and bronchial circulat
ory systems. Two 
pharmacokinetic studies in a canine model explored blood concentrations of epinephrine after 
administration through the airways. Roberts et al. compared blood concentrations and 
hemodynamic effect of intravenous (IV) versus endotracheal (E
T) instillation of epinephrine 
administered in doses of 0.005, 0.03, 0.06, and 0.09 mg/kg diluted in 5 mL of normal saline. The 
authors reported that following ET installation, maximum blood concentrations of epinephrine 
were approximately one
-
tenth of tho
se achieved with an equal dose administered IV. 
Interestingly, while IV administered epinephrine was rapidly metabolized and cleared, ET 
administration was characterized by a more sustained blood concentration. The same 
relationship between IV and ET admin
istration was observed when comparing pharmacological 
effects with the ET route requiring ten times the IV dose in order to result in a significant increase 
in blood pressure 
(78)
. Mazkereth et al. demonstrated significant measurable systemic levels 
when epinephrine in a dose of 0.02 mg/kg diluted in 2 mL of saline was administered into the 
airways using a catheter. More than a 4
-
fold increase in systemic levels was achieved when 
e
pinephrine was installed into the distal airways via a catheter as compared with when it was 
administered into the trachea (maximal concentration 8.9±3.2 vs. 2.0±0.4 ng/mL).
 
However, 
neither group demonstrated any significant change in the heart rate, and 
both had similar, minor 
decreases in blood pressure for 2 to 5 minutes with no significant differences in arterial blood 
gases 
(79)
. It is noteworthy that the dose range of epinephrine utilized in the aforementioned 
studies exceeds the dose used for achievement of hemostasis in TBLB
-
related hemorrhage by a 
factor of 4 to 10.
 
The potential of endobronchially administered epinephrine to result in adverse hemodynamic 
effects is well
-
recognized and dosing recommendations have been made since the 1970s 
(80)
. 
Nevertheless, evidence of such adverse effects are scarce and the currently available data are 
mostly derived from cases where epinephrine was administered following iatrogenic bleeding, 
potentially resulting in direct contact of the administered epineph
rine with injured blood vessels 
and hence introduction of epinephrine into the systemic circulation. Janjua et al. reported a case 
of coronary vasospasm manifesting as chest pain, ST
-
segment elevation, and ectopy induced by 
topical administration of 3 mL o
f 1:10,000 diluted epinephrine during bronchoscopy. It is 
noteworthy that epinephrine was administered into inflamed and friable airways of a lung cancer 
patient for the treatment of bleeding related to endobronchial brushing, potentially augmenting 
the su
rface area of contact between epinephrine and injured blood vessels. Left heart 
catheterization in this patient revealed mild coronary atherosclerosis and he was discharged 5 
days later following an uneventful hospital course 
(81)
. A recent report of two cases implicating 
bronchoscopic administration of epinephrine for TBLB
-
associated bleeding as the trigger for 
10
 
 
ventricular fibrillation has generated discussion regarding the safety of this technique 
(82
–
84)
. It 
is worth noting that these episodes of arrhythmias occurred with bronchoscopic instillation of 
epinephrine by a catheter which was positioned in close proximity to a bleeding vessel as well as 
the thin alveolar
-
capillary interface which allows more sy
stemic absorption than the more 
proximal airways. It seems that the volume of diluents used has as much of a significant role on 
determining the magnitude of systemic absorption of epinephrine as the absolute dose 
administered. In one interesting canine st
udy, 1 mg of epinephrine diluted in 10 mL of normal 
saline administered endotracheally, resulted in higher mean plasma epinephrine concentrations 
when compared with the same dose administered in 1 mL of saline 
(85)
. These results lend 
support to the theory maintaining that a more distal delivery of epinephrine results in more 
systemic absorption with a larger volume of instillation likely resulting in carriage of more 
epinephrine into the pulmonary absorption areas.
 
Unfortunately, there is no study comparing 
different concentrations and/or volumes of installation for bronchoscopic administration of 
epinephrine for hemostatic control following TBLB, let alone prophylactic use of topical 
epinephrine for bleeding preven
tion or minimization. It is possible that bronchoscopically 
delivered epinephrine after the onset of bleeding would not reach the source of bleeding due to 
dilutional effect and therefore would be of limited or no benefit. However, as pulmonary 
organogenes
is occurs by branching morphogenesis, proximal administration may vasoconstrict 
the vessels feeding the injured vasculature, thus decreasing flow and promoting hemostasis.
 
 
STUDY 
IMPLICATIONS
 
The role of prophylactic topical epinephrine in improving hemostasis and prevention of clinically
-
significant pulmonary hemorrhage has never been studied formally in the past, despite its 
common use by pulmonologists performing bronchoscopic TBLB. Lung tra
nsplant recipients 
undergo multiple bronchoscopies and TBLBs for surveillance and evaluation of ACR as well as 
lung infection, especially during the first year post
-
transplantation. This population may have a 
predilection to TBLB
-
related bleeding and may b
enefit from measures to reduce the frequency 
and magnitude of this relatively common complication.
 
 
In the PROPHET trial, we intend to assess the degree of biopsy
-
related bleeding, measures taken 
to control bleeding, and potential effects of bleeding on completion of the intended procedure 
in 100 bronchoscopy procedures performed on single and double lun
g transplant recipients, 
randomized to prophylactic topical epinephrine versus placebo (normal saline). The study 
participant, physician performing the TBLB, and independent observer reviewing the procedure 
recording will all be blinded to the randomizatio
n. Further use of measures to control bleeding 
that occurs during the procedure as well as the decision to complete the procedure as planned 
or to abort it prematurely will be left to the discretion of the performer. In this way, we aim to 
elucidate a pote
ntial role of topical epinephrine in the prevention of TBLB
-
related airway 
bleeding in lung transplant recipients and assess whether the dose and volume of instillation 
used in our institution comprises an effective means to prevent hemorrhagic complicatio
ns of 
TBLB.
 
11
 
 
 
HYPOTHESIS
 
We hypothesize that prophylactic instillation of topical epinephrine prior to performance of TBLB 
will decrease the frequency and extent of biopsy
-
related hemorrhage as well as result in fewer 
procedures being aborted earlier than intended due to bleeding 
complications as well as shorter 
overall procedure time due to the preventive effect on bleeding. Concomitantly, we hypothesize 
that the instillation of topical epinephrine will not be associated with a serious adverse event 
profile in comparison to placeb
o.

STUDY PROTOCOL 
 
Overview
 
The PROPHET trial is a prospective randomized double
-
blind placebo
-
controlled pilot study. 
During the study period, we intend to recruit post single or double lung transplantation patients 
expected to undergo bronchoscopy with TBLB as a part of their routi
ne post
-
transplantation care. 
Study participants who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to receive 
prophylactic endobronchial topical epinephrine or placebo in a blinded manner prior to 
performance of TBLB. Bleeding complications of T
BLB will then be assessed by the bronchoscopist 
at the time of the procedure and subsequently by two independents reviewers who will observe 
a video recording of the procedure. The bronchoscopist as well as the reviewers will be blinded 
to the study drug a
ssignment. Additionally, patients will be monitored for potential adverse 
events associated with topical epinephrine instillation. In this trial, we intend to include a total 
of 100 procedures in the final analysis. The first 40 procedures will serve as a 
pilot for proof of 
concept, refinement of the protocol, and interim analysis of data for safety outcomes.

Recruitment Strategy
 
Recruitment for the proposed clinical trial will follow the well
-
established procedures at UMMC. 
Patients will be recruited from the daily clinical practice of the study investigators as well as the 
patient cohort being followed and treated by the lung tra
nsplantation service in our institution. 
As a referral center for lung transplantation in the state of Maryland as well as the surrounding 
states, UMMC care for a large number of post
-
lung transplantation patients who are likely to 
meet inclusion and exclu
sion criteria. Based on our experience with regard to our local practice 
over past years, we are fairly confident we have access to adequate numbers of patients and 
procedures in order to complete recruitment. This provides reasonable assurance that a 
suff
icient number of participants should be able to be recruited and a sufficient number of 
procedures should be able to be recorded for this trial as well as speaks to its clinical and scientific 
relevance as its conduct will provide important information in 
the role of prophylactic 
epinephrine as means to prevent pulmonary and airway bleeding in lung transplant recipients 
undergoing bronchoscopic TBLB.
 
 
15
 
 
Potential PROPHET Trial participants will be screened from the pool of post
-
lung transplantation 
patients followed in UMMC and requiring TBLB, based on standards of care at our institution. 
Common indications for bronchoscopy with random TBLB sampling of t
he lung allograft include 
surveillance for acute graft rejection over the first post
-
transplantation year; evaluation of 
potential graft dysfunction based on clinical judgment (increased shortness of breath, worsening 
cough, decline in pulse oximetry), dec
line in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 
or average forced expiratory flow at 25
-
75 percent of the forced vital capacity (FEF25
-
75%) as 
demonstrated by serial standardized spirometry, or radiological evidence; and tissue acquisition 
for su
spected chronic graft rejection or bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome when the patient is a 
non
-
surgical candidate or a less invasive modality for tissue acquisition is desired before the 
decision regarding more invasive surgical modalities is made. A commo
n indication for 
bronchoscopy with targeted TBLB sampling of the lung allograft or the native lung in single
-
lung 
transplant recipients is evaluation of focal parenchymal lung findings observed in radiologic 
studies and suspected for infectious, inflammato
ry, toxic, or a malignant process.
 
 
Patient Evaluation
 
Patients will undergo all study related procedures, including screening, informed consent, initial 
evaluation, and study intervention, during the hospital encounter scheduled for their 
bronchoscopy and TBLB. 
 
 
Process of Obtaining Informed Consent
 
Informed Consent will be performed on the day of study recruitment. Eligible PROPHET Study 
patients will be discretely approached by one of the study investigators who will explain in 
layman’s language the aims, methods, potential benefits, and hazards ass
ociated with 
participation in the PROPHET trial. Details of the protocol will be discussed with the potential 
participant at the time of scheduling the bronchoscopy procedure, ensuring adequate time for 
consideration of the protocol (>24 hours from initial
 
discussion). These individuals will then be 
approached with the informed consent form. Whenever possible, the informed consent form will 
be given to the potential participants in advance. The risks, benefits, and alternative will be 
discussed so that the 
decision to participate in the study will be made independently by the 
candidate. Only a well
-
trained clinical coordinator, the principal investigator, or an associate 
investigator from the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine in UMMC will obta
in 
consent. The consent will be obtained using and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved 
consent document. 
 
Any potential participants who cannot consent for themselves will be excluded from the study, 
as defined by the exclusion criteria (see above). This includes anyone who will be, or will have 
been, in a stressful, painful, or drugged condition before or dur
ing the consent process or 
otherwise lacks the mental capacity to consent for themselves. We will not obtain consent from 
Legally Authorized Representatives (LARs). We will not enroll minors.
 
Lung transplantation recipients undergo multiple bronchoscopic procedures in the post
-
transplantation period. Hence, it is very likely that a patient who is eligible for participation in the 
16
 
 
study will undergo more than one bronchoscopy with TBLB during the study period. In this 
instance, a separate informed consent will be obtained for each individual procedure. 
 
 
Initial Evaluation
 
Any potential PROPHET participants who meet initial screening criteria and are anticipated to 
undergo bronchoscopy with TBLB will undergo a thorough chart review conducted by a member 
of the research team. Demographics, past medical history and comorbid co
nditions, indication 
for lung transplant, indication for bronchoscopy with TBLB and possible concurrent procedure(s), 
prior complications related to bronchoscopy or TBLB, current and active medications, most 
recent pulmonary function tests, and most recent
 
report of echocardiogram will be reviewed to 
ensure inclusion and exclusion criteria are met. Recent laboratory data including complete blood 
count, comprehensive metabolic panel, coagulation studies, and 12
-
lead electrocardiogram will 
be reviewed followi
ng our institutional standard protocol for bronchoscopy. 
 
On the day of procedure, as per our institutional procedural protocol, participants will have 
intake vital signs obtained. Recent history and physical examinations dated within 30 days of 
procedure will be reviewed or obtained if not available. Participant
s will be monitored under 
telemetry starting with this intake period, during and approximately an hour after conclusion of 
procedure unless procedural complication merit additional closer monitoring. 
 
 
Monitoring Subjects and Criteria for Withdrawal of Subjects from the Study
 
Before and after the procedure, on the procedure day, study participants will be monitored in 
the 
UMMC endoscopy peri
-
procedure suite (for outpatients) or in the admitting unit (for 
inpatients). An on
-
call pulmonary physician will be available to assist with any immediate issues.
 
During the procedure, study participants will be monitored by the UMMC bronchoscopy suite 
nursing staff, the performing bronchoscopist, and any additional physicians participating in the 
procedure. We do not anticipate problems requiring withdrawal of pati
ents from the PROPHET 
study once enrolled, other than by the patient’s request. In the event a study subject elects to be 
withdrawn from the study and requests their data to be withdrawn as well, we will comply.
 
 
Study Drug and Placebo Preparation, Packaging, and Randomized Assignment
 
The dosing of topical epinephrine for the purpose of airway bleeding prophylaxis is not 
standardized and based mainly on operator preference and in some cases local policies. The 
UMMC does not have a formal policy regarding the prophylactic use of epinephr
ine in TBLB. 
Treatment of airway bleeding with topical epinephrine once it has occurred is also controversial 
in terms of dilution and volume of instillation and, again, is based mainly on individual operator 
practice and institutional protocols. Dilution 
ratio ranges from 1:1,000 to 1:100,000 and volume 
of instillation ranges from 1 to 20 mL in different reports published across the medical literature 
(22,50
–
52)
. The only guidelines addressing this practice are the British Thoracic Society (BTS) 
guidelines on Diagnostic Flexible Bronchoscopy, which suggest using “small aliquots of 1:10,000 
diluted epinephrine” 
(49)
. 
 
17
 
 
For the PROPHET study, we decided to adopt the recommendation made by the BTS regarding 
the dilution. Regarding the volume of instillation, we chose a volume of 2 mL based on the 
common local practice in UMMC. It is standard practice during a bronchoscopy 
for a cup of saline 
and a cup of 1:10,000 diluted epinephrine to be prepared by the bronchoscopy suite
 
support 
staff. Syringes for administration of both are included with the cups so to permit administration. 
Our plan for randomization simply takes these 
syringes that are already available and on the 
bronchoscopy cart as standard practice and applies a two
-
step randomization process to ensure 
team blinding. 
 
On day of procedure, a diluted 1:10,000 epinephrine syringe will be prepared by a member of 
the research team who will not be involved in the allocation of the study drug. To allow for the 
possibility that biopsies possibly will be performed from separate 
airways, two milliliters of 
1:10,000 concentration of epinephrine along with 8 ml of ambient air will be drawn into a two 
syringes (“study drug”). Two separate syringes will be made with 2 ml of sterile saline and 8 ml 
of ambient air (“placebo”). The two s
ets of syringes will be labeled “A” or “B” based on an electric 
coin toss for randomization. A record of the coded syringes and their content will be documented 
in a unique database separate from the study database. In order not to breach blinding, lot 
num
bers for both Epinephrine and saline aliquots will be documented in each study participant’s 
CRF without disclosing which letter was assigned to each aliquot.
 
As described below, the next step is for a second team member to randomly select one set of 
labeled syringes without the first study team member knowing which was selected, and then log 
the selection. As such, the team remains blinded and only when the two
 
logs are later merged 
will drug assignment be unblinded.
 
 
 
Study Group Randomized Assignment
 
To eliminate bias, two randomization and blinding processes will be employed: in preparing and 
labeling the sets syringes (as described above) and in choosing of the set of syringes at the time 
of the procedure. Those two separate processes will be perform
ed by different members of the 
research team, each of them blinded to the results of the other procedure: 
 
 
1.
 
Two syringes will be prepared with the study drug (1:10,000 dilution of epinephrine) and 
two will be prepared with placebo (sterile saline). The syringes will be randomly labeled 
“A” and “B” based on a computerized electric coin toss and documented in a se
parate 
database as described above. This will be done by a member of the research team who 
will not be participating in the procedure and therefore blinded to the second 
randomization (syringe selection). 
 
2.
 
The syringes will be delivered to the procedure room prior to the procedure. At this time, 
the research team member who is responsible for the syringes will leave the room prior 
to the second randomization point. 
 
3.
 
The bronchoscopist or his/her assistant who is blinded to the drug and placebo 
preparation process will randomly choose “A” or “B” based again on a computerized 
electric coin toss. 
 
4.
 
The chosen set of syringes will be recorded as part of the study database. 
 
18
 
 
 
Procedure Performance
 
1.
 
Bronchoscopy will be performed in the controlled environment of the UMMC dedicated 
bronchoscopy suite under moderate sedation. The bronchoscopy suite in UMMC is routinely 
staffed by a nurse and a respiratory therapist in addition to the bronchoscopist and 
any 
trainees assisting with the procedure. 
 
2.
 
In addition to informed consent for participation in the study protocol, a formal UMMC 
informed consent for the performance of fiberoptic bronchoscopy, bronchoscopy
-
related 
procedures, and use of moderate sedatio
n will be obtained. 
 
3.
 
Per local protocol, peri
-
procedurally and during the procedure, the patient’s heart rate, 
electrocardiography rhythm strip, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation will be monitored 
continuously. Blood pressure will be repeatedly measured every 3 minutes. 
Up to 6 liters of 
supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula will be given in order to maintain an oxygen saturation 
of >92%. A defibrillator as well as a resuscitation drugs and equipment are available at all 
times in the bronchoscopy suite. 
 
4.
 
Patient will undergo the procedure in the supine position on an adjustable bed. 
Premedication will be performed per local protocol, including inhalation of 5 mL of 4% 
lidocaine via a nebulizer. Gurgling of 2 to 4 mL of 2% liquid lidocaine (20
-
40 mg) for up
per 
airway anesthesia may also be applied depending on the performing bronchoscopist’s 
preference. Moderate sedation will be achieved with a combination of midazolam (maximal 
dose of 6 mg per procedure) and fentanyl (maximal dose of 300 mcg per procedure).
 
Laryngeal and lower airway anesthesia during the procedure will be obtained with the use of 
2 mL aliquots of 2% liquid lidocaine up to a cumulative liquid lidocaine dose of 400 mg. A bite 
block will be used for procedures performed through the transoral a
pproach. For the 
transnasal approach, 2% viscous lidocaine will be applied with a cotton swab to the chosen 
nostril and nasal passage to allow easy advancement of the bronchoscope. 
 
5.
 
Bronchoscopy will be performed with an Olympus BF
-
1T160 or BF
-
1TH190 (Olympus, Tokyo, 
Japan) video bronchoscope under fluoroscopic guidance (OEC 9900 Elite Mobile C
-
arm, GE 
Healthcare, Chicago, Illinois, United States). 
 
6.
 
For the purpose of
 
independent post
-
procedure analysis, the entire procedure from insertion 
of the bronchoscope into the airways until its final retraction will be video
-
recorded on DVD 
media and individually labeled without disclosing study arm assignment. DVDs will be sto
red 
with other individual patient study documents for later review. Access to the stored DVDs will 
be provided only to the PROPHET study research team.
 
7.
 
Prior to biopsy performance 2 mL of 1:10,000 diluted epinephrine followed by 8 mL of 
ambient room air or 2 mL of sterile saline solution followed by 8 mL of ambient room air as 
described in “Study Drug and Placebo Preparation” will be instilled into the ta
rget airway by 
the bronchoscopist. This process may be repeated once, should the performing 
bronchoscopist choose to perform additional biopsy passes through a different airway. If 
choose to do so, the same study drug will be instilled into both airways. A
ny additional 
biopsies performed, will be done without airway instillation of study drug.
 
8.
 
Biopsies will be performed using brand bronchoscopic biopsy forceps as preferred by the 
procedure performer. For ACR, aim will be to obtain 5 to 8 adequate biopsies, preferably from 
19
 
 
the lateral subsegment of either the right or left lower lobes to allow optimal visualization 
and minimize forshortening under fluoroscopy as well as to avoid as much as possible spillage 
of blood into uninvolved lung segments in the event of biopsy
-
relate
d hemorrhage as 
described above. For the evaluation of radiological findings, aim will be to obtain 4 to 8 
adequate biopsy specimens from an involved segment in one of the lungs based on imaging. 
All bronchoscopies will be performed by an experienced bronc
hoscopist.
 
9.
 
The following data will be recorded with regard to the performance of the procedure:

Immediate Post
-
Procedure Surveillance
 
Following retraction of the bronchoscope, fluoroscopy will be performed while the patient is still 
on the bronchoscopy bed in order to try and identify early pneumothorax. The patient will then 
be transferred for recovery in the UMMC endoscopy peri
-
procedu
re suite or in the admitting 
unit. A chest radiograph will be obtained to identify late pneumothorax within two hours of the 
termination of the procedure or later if late symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax appear. Also, 
a repeat ECG will be obtained withi
n two hours of the termination of the procedure or earlier if 
symptoms suggestive of cardiac arrhythmia, ischemia, or conduction abnormality appear. The 
patient will also be assessed by a clinician to evaluate for signs and symptoms of pneumothorax 
or sign
ificant pulmonary hemorrhage on the same day of the procedure. Patients will be 
instructed not the drink or eat in the 2 hours following the procedure and if stable for discharge 
from the hospital on the same day of the procedure, to be driven to their pla
ce of residence by 
an escort. Patients will also be instructed to call if they had any hemoptysis, dyspnea, chest pain, 
or wished to ask questions. 
 
 
Long
-
Term Post
-
Procedure Surveillance
 
A follow
-
up telephone call will be performed by one of the study investigators 24 to 48 hours 
following the bronchoscopic procedure. Patients will be requested to report any ill
-
effects of the 
procedure and will be specifically asked about sore throat, fev
er, chills, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and 
chest pain. Symptomatic patients will be managed as deemed appropriate according to clinical 
judgment and the UMMC bronchoscopy suite guidelines. Management options include 
reassurance, prescription of appropriate medic
ation, referral to the primary care physician, 
referral to the lung transplantation clinic, or referral to a local or the UMMC emergency room.
 
Emergency situations may arise in which it is necessary to unmask treating physicians, emergency 
department personnel, clinic personnel, or the patient to the assigned treatment. Situations that 
require unmasking are expected to be rare. Since epinephrine 
has a short half
-
life it will probably 
be already eliminated from the study participant’s circulation by the time they are seen by a 
provider for possible study drug
-
related side effect. It is possible, however, that emergency 
personnel or treating physici
ans might feel it is necessary to know the medication that participant 
was taking to decide upon a rational course of treatment, or to ensure that other medications 
are not given that might adversely interact with epinephrine. In such cases the treating me
dical 
personnel should call the PI for study unmasking. In that event, an Unmasking Report for the 
event must be completed.

Data Analysis
 
Sample Size and Power Calculations
 
Formal power calculations are not possible as studies of this kind have not been previously 
performed and an aim of the study is to 
develop new bleeding assessment tools.  As such, the 
first 40 procedures will provide data intended to show feasibility as well as to inform more refined 
power calculations. Numbers are based primarily on feasibility. 
 
Limitation of study participants to transplant recipients is anticipated to improve study power.  
In a relatively recent population
-
based study performed in the USA, Tukey et al. reviewed almost 
100,000 patient visits involving TBLB and reported an overall
 
rate for procedure
-
related clinically 
significant hemorrhage of 0.58% 
(37)
. In a second large survey from Japan, Asano et al. reviewed 
over 100,000 procedures, among them 57,199 forceps biopsies, and recorded a bleeding rate of 
0.73% 
(38)
.  These low rates of bleeding likely reflect both insensitive thresholds to define 
bleeding as well as a lower risk population than that of lung transplant recipients.
 
Bleeding risk in lung transplantation patients seems to be higher than that of the general 
population, although one must bear in mind the following caveats: (1) most of the currently 
published literature is retrospective and observational in nature; (2) lu
ng transplant recipients 
studies mostly involve small patient populations; and (3) in most studies to date, the definition 
of clinically
-
significant bleeding was based on the amount of bloody fluid collected in the suction 
container during the procedure. T
his quantification method is prone to much bias since this fluid 
is a mixture of blood, airway secretions, and lavage fluid, and thus may over
-
estimated the true 
volume of blood loss. Also, the volume of blood loss considered clinically relevant varies acr
oss 
published studies and affects to a great extent on the reported rate of clinically
-
significant 
bleeding. The most prominent lung transplant studies examining the prevalence of TBLB
-
related 
bleeding are summarized in the table below:

Data are expressed as means with standard deviations, medians with interquartile 
range, percentages, and proportions as appropriate. Continuous outcome variables 
were visually examined for normality and outliers using histograms and scatter plots. 
The normal distribution was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Continuous variables 
were compared with the Student’s t-test for normally distributed data with similar 
variance and the Mann-Whitney tests for non-normally distributed data. Proportions 
were compared using Chi-squared or Fisher’s exact tests as appropriate. Statistical 
significance was set at P<0.05. All statistical analyses were performed based on original
assigned groups and using Stata software, version 14 (Stata Corp LLC).
Potential Benefits
We 
hypothesize that prophylactic instillation of topical epinephrine prior 
to TBLB will
reduced
procedure-related hemorrhage, leading to lower rate of prematurely aborted procedure due to
bleeding complications and higher yield of intended biopsies. The participants may, therefore,
have 
direct 
benefit 
from 
participation 
if 
prophylactic 
topical 
epinephrine 
reduces 
the 
rate 
of
procedure related hemorrhage in TBLB therefore avoiding early termination of procedure and
more intended biopsies taken providing a higher diagnostic yield.
No financial reimbursements or incentive for participating in the PROPHET study will be provided.
Potential Risks and Discomforts
The decision to perform bronchoscopy with TBLB will be based on clinical indications as a part of
each 
study 
participant 
standard 
of 
care 
and 
not 
as 
a 
part 
of 
the 
research. 
Potential 
risks 
and
discomfort 
of 
the 
bronchoscopy 
and 
TBLB 
themselves 
are 
no 
more
than 
what 
the 
participant
would 
undergo 
as 
a 
part 
of 
their 
post-transplantation 
bronchoscopy. 
These 
risks 
include
hemorrhage 
related 
to 
the 
procedural 
maneuvers, 
respiratory 
distress, 
pneumothorax 
(i.e.
collapsed lung). These complications are rare (less than <1% of all bronchoscopies) and can be
expected in any bronchoscopy and TBLB. An experienced bronchoscopist and a well-trained staff
such 
as 
ours 
are 
well 
trained 
to 
handle 
these 
potential 
complications 
in 
the 
controlled
environment 
of 
the 
bronchoscopy
suite. 
Bronchoscopic 
procedures 
performed 
in 
the 
UMMC
bronchoscopy 
suite 
are 
usually 
performed 
under 
conscious 
sedation. 
Potential 
risks 
and
discomforts 
of 
conscious 
sedation 
for 
our 
study 
participants 
are 
no 
more 
than 
what 
the
participant 
would 
undergo 
for 
their 
post-transplantation 
bronchoscopy. 
Conscious 
sedation 
is
generally safe, but can cause nausea and vomiting, ineffective ventilation resulting from airway
obstruction 
or 
respiratory 
depression, 
causing 
hypoxia, 
hypercarbia, 
or 
aspiration 
associated
with 
loss 
of 
protective 
airway 
reflexes, 
as 
well 
as 
cardiovascular 
complications 
including
hypotension 
and 
arrhythmia. 
Drug 
overdose 
and 
drug 
reactions 
are 
a 
constant 
possibility 
in
patients undergoing conscious sedation.
The potential risks of epinephrine are well described in cases of sufficient systemic absorption of
the drug. Most serious complications are arrhythmias and hemodynamic compromise and tend
to 
occur 
in 
a 
dose 
dependent 
manner. 
Most 
complications 
seen 
are 
in
the 
setting 
of 
existing
bleeding 
from 
procedural 
maneuvers. 
Topical 
epinephrine, 
in 
these 
situations, 
is 
instilled 
in
airways with damaged mucosa and blood vessels. There is direct communication between the
airway and blood vessels allowing for more direct absorption of epinephrine leading to higher
concentration of epinephrine in the blood stream and therefore systemic complications. There is
no reported data of the incidence rate of complications arising from epinephrine in the setting
of topical prophylactic use, but it is expected to have lower rate of systemic absorption. In rare
27
 
 
cases of complications, our staff is well trained and the procedure room is equipped to treat these 
potential complications of epinephrine.
 
Research related risk to the patient will also be loss of confidentiality. Loss of confidentiality is 
unlikely to occur as all data will be accessed and stored securely only by members of the research 
team. All patient data will be incorporated into a cent
ral database. Patients will be assigned with 
a unique identification number. The database will be maintained behind University of Maryland 
firewall in a password
-
protected folder on the I: drive. The database file will also be password 
protected. Any limit
ed physical data will be kept in a locked cabinet with only keys available to 
research team members. Confidential data will not be shared.
 
 
 
Adverse Events Reporting to the IRB 
 
All adverse events occurring during the study, including those observed by or reported to the 
research team, will be recorded. Serious unanticipated problems, defined as complications 
thought to be likely related to the study drug administration and requir
e some intervention, will 
be reported to the IRB as soon as possible but not more than 5 business days after the PI first 
learns of the event. For example, a brief arrhythmia that requires no intervention will not be 
reported within 5 business days, while 
an arrhythmia requiring drug or electrical shock 
administration will be reported within 5 business days. Likewise, any serious protocol deviations 
will be reported to the IRB as soon as possible but not more than 7 business days after the PI first 
learns o
f the event. Not serious unanticipated problems will be reported to the IRB as soon as 
possible but not more than 14 business days after the PI first learns of the event. Not serious 
protocol deviations will only be reported to the IRB (within 14 business 
days after the PI first 
learns of the deviation) if they represent a departure from UMMC policies for the conduct of 
human subject research, adversely affect the health care of subject(s), or compromise the 
interpretation or integrity of the research. Not 
serious protocol deviations that result from 
normal subject scheduling variations or technical issues associated with sampling that do not 
impact the health of the subject or interpretation of the study data will not be reported.
 
Adverse events that are clearly not related to the study procedures, such as those that occur 
prior to initiation of study
-
related procedures, will not be reported to the IRB. Adverse events 
that are expected and thought to be related to the natural histor
y of lung transplantation and its 
comorbidities will not be reported to the IRB.
 
Expected adverse events (sore throat, cough, mild hemoptysis, low
-
grade fever, non
-
life
-
threatening allergic reactions) that do not require intervention will not be reported to the IRB. 
All other adverse events will be reported in aggregate at the time of 
continuing review.
 
Deaths will be reported to the IRB within 7 business days after the PI first learns of the event. 
 
 
Data Monitoring
 
There will be interim analysis of data for safety and all adverse events. These analyses will be 
done by an independent physician reviewer after a pilot period of 40 procedures or 10 major 
bleeding events, whichever occurs first. Thereafter, safety analysi
s will be performed and 
reviewed at a minimum of every 6 months. 
 
28
 
 
All adverse events including known complications and unexpected adverse events of the 
bronchoscopy and TBLB and medications administered will be recorded as part of our data 
monitoring. Reportable event including but not limited to unanticipated problems, 
protocol 
deviation, any change in subject’s status will generate a report. The report will include subject 
identification, date of event, date the PI became aware of the event, description of event, date 
the event resolved if applicable, type of harm if an
y experienced by the participant, relationship 
harm to the event and date the report was submitted to the IRB and other regulatory authorities.

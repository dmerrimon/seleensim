2. BACKGROUND  
Prevalence and importance of female sexual health as a survivorship issue . 
According to the American Cancer Society, as of January, 2014, there were 14.5 million 
cancer survivors  (Cancer Facts & Figures  2015). Of the female survivors (7,607,230), 55% of 
those have been diagnosed with breast or some form of gynecologic cancer  (Cancer 
Treatment a nd Survivorship Facts & Figures  2014 -2015).  By 2024, t he number of survivors 
is expected to grow to 19 million, with over half of those, 9.6 million, being female. 
Therefore, addressing chronic negative sequelae for women in the aftermath of a cancer 
diagnosis and its treatments becomes a health imperative.  
 
One prevalent consequence of treatment in some types of cancer is decreased sexual health, 
particularly for women with estrogen sensitive tumors due to estrogen deprivation. Sexual 
health can be defined as well being in relation to sexuality, whi ch is a c ore aspect of 
humanity (WHO Reproductive Health Topics: Sexual Health 2015)  The prevalence of sexual 
health concerns for female cancer survivors in published data ranges from 30 to 100%  (Speer  
et al. 2015, Gilbert et al. 2011, Andersen et al. 2007, Burwell  et al. 2006, Krychman and 
Millheiser 2013, Biglia et al. 2010)  and the descriptive literature is fairly consistent 
demonstrating specific problems that comprise the concept of sexual health as including 
lubrication, dyspareunia, desire, body image, increa sed fati gue, and relationship concerns 
(Ganz et al. 1998, Carmack Taylor et al. 2004). Changes in sexual health are common after 
surgery , chemotherapy, radiation therapy,  and endocrine therapy ( estrogen inhibition) , and 
although some studies demonstrate im provement over time, other studies reveal that negative 
sexual health can persist over many years  (Burwell et al. 2006).  The issues related to sexual 
health and functioning may be slightly different for survivors of breast versus gynecologic 
cancer, but ex isting litera ture demonstrates much overlap and almost identical importance 
with sexual changes being one of the most commonly reported after treatment for both 
groups (Burwell et al. 2006, Ganz and Green dale 2007). Perhaps most importantly, sexual 
functio n is important enough for female cancer survivors that they continue to be sexually 
active despite significant discomfort. A 5 -year longitudinal study by Malinovszky showed 
that women with breast cancer note continued decline in pleasure and increase in pa in with 
NRG -CC004  9  Version Date:  June 07, 2019  intercourse over 5 years despite a return to u sual sexual activity by 2 years (Malinovszky et 
al. 2006).  These data provide support for the idea that sexual behavior is a necessary part of 
life that women may engage in despite pain and reduced plea sure. Efforts to improve this 
scenario are needed.  
 
The Principal Investigator of this concept has a program of research to improve sexual health 
outcomes in female survivors of breast and gynecologic cancer, as sexual related issues are 
similar in these t wo female cancer groups. Since female sexual health is a multi -component 
concept that is influenced by the various specific symptoms reviewed in the paragraph above 
(self-image, vaginal atrophy, desire, relationships and fatigue), a multi -faceted approach is 
warranted. This is supported by an inspirational early editorial by Dr. Ganz (Ganz and 
Greendale 2007)  stating that as sexual desire, responsiveness and satisfaction, in essence 
sexual health, can be affected by numerous things, when attempting to evalu ate treatment, 
several issues must be considered. Therefore, the study represented in this proposal is one of 
4 interventions being tested for related components of sexual health that together will 
comprise a multi -component intervention targeted toward 4 known prevalent predictors of 
sexual health in female cancer survivors: vaginal atrophy, self -image, sexual desire and 
partner concerns. Dr. Barton already completed a study addressing vaginal atrophy (Alliance 
N10C1) and is currently recruiting women for a randomized phase II study evaluating 
hypnosis for self -image. The study proposed in this concept addresses the construct of sexual 
desire and if this study is positive, it will be added to other effective treatments for the above 
mentioned predictors to provide a comprehensive approach to sexual health that can be 
individualized to meet a woman’s needs.  
 
What is sexual desire?   
There is a lot of controversy in the literature about what constitutes female sexual desire, 
often called libido  (Bancroft 2005 , van Anders 2012).  It is clear that sexual desire/libido in 
women is multifactorial and more complex than the similar concept in men, where there is 
more of a linear relationship between arousal and desire. In women, the relationship is not 
linear and it is confounded by re lationships and self -image (Basson, 2004).  It is also likely 
true that sexual desire may be a bit more complex in women with a cancer history compared 
to women without cancer. Specifically, in the cancer literature when exploring female sexual 
health, ther e is, conceptually, support that energy (perhaps fatigue) plays a role in sexual 
health and declines as a result of a  cancer diagnosis and treatment (Wilmoth et al. 2004).   
Data from our recent vaginal Dehydroepiandrosterone  (DHEA ) study demonstrate that a t 
baseline, vitality explained 13% of overall sexual function (unpublished data). In addition, at  
baseline, women in our vaginal DHEA study reported v igor/energy levels right around the 
50% point (53 out of 100 with higher numbers being better) on the vita lity subscale of the 
Medical Outcomes Scale Short Form -36. Further, linear regression modeling of overall 
sexual function at baseline found vitality to be a significant predictor (p=.001) in addition to 
the variables of relationship, severity and bother of  vaginal symptoms, and chemically 
induced menopause (unpublished data).       
 
Other studies repor t findings consistent with ours ( WHO Reproductive Health Topics: 
Sexual Health 20015, Ganz 1998, Carmack Taylor 2004, Ganz and Greendale 2007).   In 
another investigation  evaluating sexual outcomes in women with a history of gynecologic 
NRG -CC004  10  Version Date:  June 07, 2019  cancer, fatigue (measured with the Fatigue Symptom Inventory -revised) was significantly 
correlated with both sexual responsiveness and global satisfaction as measured by the Fe male 
Sexual Function Index and the Global Sexual Satisfaction Scale, respective ly, all well 
validated measures (Carpenter et al. 2009).  Based on the aforementioned data, we are 
conceptualizing sexual desire as a term that incorporates having the motivation  and necessary 
energy to want to engage in sexual intimacy activity, not only intercourse.  
 
There is also controversy about the role of testosterone in female sexual desire.  (Bancroft 
2005, van Anders 2012).  The most commonly studied intervention that has  been found 
effective in women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) without cancer has been 
transdermal testosterone. However, this intervention has not been effective in improving 
sexual desire/libido in women with a history of cancer  (Barton et al. 2007). In research 
performed  by Dr. Barton, testosterone was not found to be effective in improving libido in 
female cancer survivors  (Barton et al. 2007)  despite significant increases in testosterone 
concentrations and contrary to evidence of its bene fit in women with hypoactive sexual 
desire disorder  (HSDD ) or women post menopause  (Braunstein et al. 2005, Buster et al. 
2005, Chudakov et al. 2007, Davis et al. 2008, Davis et al. 2006, Goldstat et al. 2003, 
Nathorrst -Boos et al. 2006, Shifren et al. 200 0, Shifren et al. 2006, Simon et al. 2005).  In 
addition, translational data from that clinical trial demonstrated a lack of significant 
association between testoste rone and sexual health outcomes (Barton, Loprinzi et al. 2007).   
 
However, the neurotransmitter, dopamine, has been better characterized than testosterone as 
potentially having a role in sexual motivation or desire in women  (Bancroft 2005, Frohlich et 
al. 1999, Hull et al. 1999).   Specific areas of the brain have been found to be ass ociated with 
sexual desire, including the medial preoptic nucleus, nucleus accumbens, and the ventral 
tegmental area. This has been substantiated in f unctional MRI studies evaluating brain 
function in HSDD compared to women with no such histor y (Bianchi -Demicheli 2011, 
Arnow et al. 2009).  The neurotransmitters that are active in these areas and believed to be 
important in reward -motivation and pleasure are dopamine, norepineph rine, oxytocin and 
melanocortin (Versace et al. 2013).  In fact, dopamine is though t to be essential in order to 
promote excitatory neural inputs that are needed for behavior involving motivation. 
Therefore, sexual desire is not simply a response to being aroused; it is embedded in a neural 
response that involves memory, pleasure and emo tion and is influenced by positive cues as 
well as inhibition of nonsexual cues (Brom et al. 2014).    
 
2.1 Preliminary data supporting dopamine reduction with estrogen deprivation . 
Animal and human data provide evidence that estrogen deprivation is associated with a loss 
of dopamine. In one study, after 30 days, estrogen deprivation per ovariectomy in primates 
resulted in over a 30% decrease in dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra  (Hull et al. 
1999).  In a study comparing ovariectomized rats with and witho ut estrogen replacement, 
estrogen deprivation reduced striatal dopamine release and locomotor activity while estrogen 
replacement improved both locomotor activity and dopamine release  (Bianchi -Demicheli 
2011).  Finally, a study in postmenopausal women was c onducted to evaluate the impact of 
estrogen therapy on dopaminergic activity. Investigators evaluated dopaminergic tone using a 
measured response of growth hormone to apomorphine, which is a validated measure of 
dopamine tone. Women receiving estrogen ther apy had a higher dopaminergic response 
NRG -CC004  11  Version Date:  June 07, 2019  compared to women who were not receiving estrogen  (Arnow et al. 2009).   
 
There are further data to support that inflammatory conditions may have overlap with 
neurologic processes that involve dopamine  (Dantzer et al. 2014).  The relationship is 
complex, but simply put, areas of the brain that are rich with dopaminergic neurons have also 
been found to be impacted by inflammation  (Felger and Miller 2012).  Hence, dopamine 
function can be impacted by inflammation  (Felger an d Miller 2012).  Interferon alpha therapy 
is used in these studies to simulate inflammatory processes. In a study in rhesus monkeys, 
after 4 weeks of interferon therapy, dopamine release was reduced when measured by both in 
vivo microdialysis and PET neuroi maging  (Felger et al. 2013).  An investigation performed  
by Capuron and colleagues demonstrated the same results after 6 weeks of interferon alpha 
administration given to medically stabl e adults with hepatitis C virus (Capuron et al. 2012).  
Hence, investig ators successfully linked pro -inflammatory cytokine activity (a biomarker 
profile associated with fatigue which has also been associated with women diagnosed with 
breast cancer who have fatigue) with decreased activation of brain areas associated with 
rewa rd and decreased dopamine.  
 
In summary , these data support the hypothesis that women post cancer treatment who are 
estrogen deficient may have reduced dopaminergic activity that negatively impacts their 
sexual desire. This situation may be compounded by persistent fatigue that is also associated 
with increased inflammation , which may also be impacting dopaminergic areas of the brain. 
Treatment with a dopaminergic agent may improve sexual motivation outcomes and may 
also, secondarily, improve fatigue. Our working hypothesis is that fatigue may mediate 
sexual desire, however, the mechanism of interest is dopamine, not inflammation , and the 
primary outcome of interest is sexual desire, not fatigue.  
        
2.2 Preliminary data with dopaminergic agents.  
Despite co mpelling physiologic data linking dopamine to reward stimuli, motivation and 
reward centers that are critical to sexual desire and data associating estrogen depletion with 
reduced dopamine activity, dopaminergic agents have not been rigorously studied for sexual 
desire in female cancer survivors. In fact, one concern is that few dopaminergic agents have a 
side effect profile conducive to use in a supportive care trial.   
 
Bupropion is a dopaminergic agent worth evaluating  with promise to improve sexual desire 
in women with a history of  cancer . It is an antidepressant that is chemically distinct  as an 
inhibitor of dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake  (GlaxoSmithKline 2011).   Bupropion is 
approved for seasonal affective diso rder, major depressive disorder (Micr omedex Healthcare 
Series 2008),   and smoking cessation. (GlaxoSmithKline 2015 ). It has been  available in the 
US since 1989 as an immediate release formulation, with the sustained release formulation 
becoming available  2003  (Fava et al. 2005).  Bupropion has been used in sexual medicine 
clinics to reverse the lack of libido instigated with the use of selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. There are limited, but promising, data to support rigorous 
phase II trials to evalua te whether a dose of bupropion would be beneficial to women with a 
history of cancer in boosting sexual desire/energy/motivation without causing intolerable or  
undesirable side effects (Clayton et al. 2006, Croft et al. 1999, Gitlin et al. 2002, Safarineja d 
2011, Segraves et al. 2004, Mathias et al. 2004, Moss et al. 2006).   
NRG -CC004  12  Version Date:  June 07, 2019   
There have been several studies of bupropion in women without cancer with decreases in 
sexual desire. At least four of these studies were randomized placebo controlled trials and all 
demonstrated positive effects of bupropion on sexual desire and o ther domains of sexual 
function (Clayton et al. 2006, Croft et al. 1999, Gitlin et al. 2002, Safarinejad 2011, Segraves 
et al. 2004).  One well -designed double blind trial recruited patients wi th depression and 
randomized them to bupropion plus sertraline placebo, sertraline plus bupro pion placebo or 
double placebos (Croft et al. 1999).  The bupropion dose used was 150  mg to 400  mg per day 
of the slow release formula. About 40% of the patients in  each arm also had sexual desire 
disorder, but normal sexual functioning. By day 42, significantly fewer patients on bupropion 
still had sexual desire disorder compared to both the sertraline and placebo, despite both 
antidepressant groups experiencing sig nificant and clinically meaningful i mprovements in 
their depression (Croft et al. 1999).  Of note, there was also significantly less orgasmic 
dysfunction in the group receiving bupropion, similar to that in the placebo group, and 
significantly less than the  sertraline group. In a  randomized placebo -controlled trial of 218 
women who were premenopausal and experiencing decreased libido from treatment with 
SSRI’s , bupropion susta ined relaease ( SR) 150 mg BID versus placebo was evaluated over 12 
weeks, as adjunc tive treatment to their current SSRI antidepressant. The Female Sexual 
Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire was used as the primary endpoint. Statistically significant 
improvements in every domain of sexual function were seen in this study  compared to place bo, 
with the exception of pain  (Safarinejad 2011),  with sexual desire improving the most of all 
domains . The sexual desire subscale improved from 2.2 (below the cut off indicating 
dysfunction) to 4.1 (above the cut off indicating normal desire). Significant improvement in 
the FSFI desire subscale began at the 4 week data point , improved further at 8 weeks and 
improved slightly more at 12 weeks.  In this study, depression was already managed with the 
SSRI, so the bupropion/placebo was intended to t arget the physiological changes caused by 
the SSRI that negatively impacted sexual desire.  
 
Two studies have been completed in a cancer population. In 20 women with breast cancer, an 
open label trial evaluated 150 mg daily of bupropion for 8 weeks for impr ovement in sexual 
function. By 4 weeks, women had a mean score on the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale that 
was below the cut off for dysfunction, despite baseline values being above the dysfunction 
cutoff. This improvement was maintained at week 8. The ove rall improvement on the measure 
was 20%  (Mathias et al. 2006).  The second study in 21 breast cancer survivors evaluated 
bupropion at a dose of 150 to 300 mg per day for fatigue, depression and quality of life  (Moss 
et al. 2006).  Bupropion significantly imp roved fatigue and depression after 4 weeks of a stable 
dose of bupropion. The study did divide the sample into depressed versus non -depressed 
participants using a cut -off score of >17 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. When they 
examined fatigue impr ovement in this non -depressed group (N=12), there were still significant 
improvements on the total Brief Fatigue Inventory ( BFI)  and interference subscales (total 
score at baseline 6.5, at 4 weeks 4.5, p=.03). Therefore, the impact of fatigue in this stud y does 
not appear to be secondary to improvement in depression.  
 
Recently, a new dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, flibanserin, was approved 
by the FDA to improve hypoactive sexual desire disorder in premenopausal women , but has 
not been stu died in female cancer survivors (Sprout Pharmaceuticals 2015).   Flibanserin was 
NRG -CC004  13  Version Date:  June 07, 2019  however studied in preclinical models and several human clinical trials that began to be 
published in 2012. It gained FDA approval in early summer of 2015 based on three phase I II 
randomized controlled trials  (Katz et al. 2013, Thorp et al. 2012, Derogatis et al. 2012)  with 
co-primary endpoints of sexually satisfying events and the desire subscale of the FSFI.  
 
The positive results and subsequent FDA approval of flibanserin supports the proof of 
concept that dopaminergic agents may improve sexual desire. However, flibanserin was only 
studied in premenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder, which is likely 
physiologically and psychosocially , a very different situ ation than women with a history of 
cancer who are postmenopausal and severely estrogen deficient. There are a few other 
reasons why flibanserin is not being suggested as the dopaminergic agent to be studied in this 
proposal.  
 
First, the approved dose had a  withdrawal rate in all three studies of 25 -30%, half due to 
adverse events  (Sprout Pharmaceuticals  2015).  The most common adverse events were 
dizziness, somnolence, nausea, fatigue and insomnia. This would be a particularly unwanted 
side effect profile in  women with a history of cancer who already likely have fatigue that is 
contributing to their lack of sexual desire. To use an agent that can cause somnolence or 
fatigue is in direct contradiction to our hypothesis that fatigue is the mediating factor for 
sexual desire in a population of female cancer survivors. Second, there appears to be 
theoretically, one key difference in the mechanism of flibanserin and bupropion. That 
difference is that flibanserin is believed to increase dopamine and norepinephrine, but also to 
decrease serotonin  (Sprout Pharmaceuticals 2015),  whereas bupropion is not thought to affect 
serotonin ( GlaxoSmithKline 2015 , Fava et al. 2005).  This difference may contribute to the 
undesirable side effect profile of flibanserin related to fat igue and somnolence (as these are 
symptoms of low serotonin). This may also be important in a population of estrogen deficient 
female cancer survivors as low serotonin may also be the etiology behind hot flashes and 
therefore, this population may already b e serotonin deficient. Therefore, evaluating a drug 
with the intended mechanism of action (dopamine and norepinephrine inhibitor) but without 
additional unwanted activity (decreasing serotonin), a drug without sedating properties that is 
FDA approved for o ther indications, a drug with a long history of use without significant 
problems, and a drug that is available generically and thus more cost effective , would be of 
more interest.  
 
To this end, we plan to evaluate two doses of bupropion versus a placebo in postmenopausal 
women with a history of breast or gynecologic cancer and low desire to see if there are 
positive effects in these populations without unwanted side effects. As demonstrated in the 
trials with flibanserin (listed in the section “sample and  power analysis”) and Dr. Barton’s 
earlier trial evaluating transdermal testosterone for sexual desire  (Barton et al. 2004)  there is 
a placebo effect present in this research.  Therefore, in order to evaluate whether a phase III 
trial is warranted, it is c ritical that this phase II dose finding study include a placebo arm in 
order to better determine the estimated effect of both doses of bupropion. This study is 
seeking a positive risk/benefit balance for women struggling with decreased sexual desire 
and wi ll evaluate an effect size, dose, and the best primary endpoint to guide a larger 
definitive phase III clinical trial.

5. TREATMENT PLAN /REGIMEN  DESCRIPTION  
Two doses of bupropion XL, 150 and 300 mg, will be tested over 8 weeks at the target dose 
as a response has been seen within that time frame; however, we will evaluate effects at 5 
weeks (4 weeks at the target dose) as a secondary outcome to evaluate time to benefit for a 
larger, well powered study.  
 
The drug will be titrated and taken as described below. There will be a one week titration, 8 
weeks at the target dose, and one week titration off of the dru g.  Patients should be instructed 
that the study drug needs to be increased and decreased slowly, over one week, and therefore 
doses should not be skipped nor should their assigned treatment be stopped abruptly.  Any 
issues with tolerating or staying on th e study drug should be discussed with their study 
doctor .   
 
5.1 Study agent  (08-Jun-2018)  
Protocol treatment must begin within 21 days after randomization.  
 
5.1.1 Study drug and placebo will be identical looking capsules.  Patients will be randomized 
to treatment arm, A, B, or C.  Each arm will have a designated study treatment kit that 
will contain 4 bottles labeled 1, 2A and 2B, and 3.   All patients in each arm will follow 
the exact same procedure for taking their assigned treatmen t.  A patien t instruction sheet 
will be included in each kit.  Instruct patients to read and follow the directions carefully.  
Patients should also be instructed to call the research personnel if they have any 
intolerance and wish to stop the study drug. Pa tients should not stop the medication on 
their own and they should not alter the number of pills taken.  
NRG -CC004  19  Version Date:  June 07, 2019    
 The study agent will be taken orally for a total of 10 weeks according to the treatment 
arm assignment below. Do not chew, cut or crush the tablets.  
            Arm A  
 Days 1 -7 (1 week) : Bupropion 150 mg XL every  morning . Patients will take one 
capsulefrom bottle marked 1.  
 
Days 8 -63 (8 weeks) : Bupropion 150 mg XL and one placebo capsule every  
morning .Patients will take one capsule from the bottle marked 2A and one capsule from 
the bottle marked 2B.  
  
 Days 64-70 (1 week) : Placebo capsule  every  morning  (tritration off week) . Patients  will 
take one capsule every morning from the bottle marked 3.  
           
            Arm B

every morning from the bottle marked 1.  
             
 Days 8 -63 (8 weeks) : Bupropion 300mg XL every morning.  Patients  will take one 
capsule form the bottle marked 2A and one capsule from the bottle marked 2B  for a daily 
dose of 300mg . 
 
            Days 64-70 (1 week) : Bupropion 150 XL every morning  (titration off week) . Patients  will 
take one capsule every morning from the bottle marked 3.  
 
            Arm C 
 Days 1 -7 (1 week) : One placebo capsule every  morning . Patients  will take one capsule 
from the bottle marked 1.  
             
 Days 8 -63 (8 weeks) : Two placebo capsules  every morning . Patients  will take one 
capsule from the bottle marked 2A and one capsule from the bottle marked 2B.  
 
Days 64-70 (1 week) : One p lacebo capusule every morning  (titration off week) . Patients  
will take one capsule every morning from the bottle marked 3.  
 
Patients  who have been on the placebo arm can be offered the opportunity to receive 
bupropion 150 or 300 mg XL for a total of 8 weeks.  This includes a week to titrate up 
and a week to titrate down if the desired dose is 300 mg XL.  See Appendix II  for further 
details.  
 
5.2 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  (08-Jun-2018)  
5.2.1 Prohibited Therapies  
 Oral or transdermal estrogen.  
 Medications metabolized b y CYP 2D6 as in Appendix I, such as tamoxifen , other 
SSRIs . 
 Flibanserin  
NRG -CC004  20  Version Date:  June 07, 2019  5.2.2 Participation in Other Trials  
Participation in other symptom trials is allowed as long as the trial does not focus on the 
management of sexual h ealth or fatigue in any way.  
 
5.3 Emergency Unblinding Procedure  (08-Jun-2018)  
The decision to break the unblinding code must be based on a serious adverse event 
unexpected for the study drug and related to the study drug  or extraordinary clinical 
circumstance for which knowledge of drug assignment will affect clinical judgment.  The 
blind  ordinarily should be broken for unexpected adverse events related to the study drug  
(e.g., safety reports submitted to the FDA and all p articipating  investigators ). All cases 
that are emergently unblinded must be reported to the NCI Central IRB (CIRB).  
 
Sites can call NRG Headquarters during business hours (8:30 AM to 5 PM ET), at 215-
574-3150  and ask to speak to the Supporting Study Stati stician. For after hours, weekends, 
and holidays, call 215-940-8902 . 
 
Optional Open Label Phase  
Patients who have been on the placebo arm can be offered the opportunity to receive 
bupropion 150 or 300 mg XL for a total of 8 weeks.  This includes a week to titrate up and 
a week to titrate down if the desired dose is 300 mg XL.  NRG Headquarters will unblind 
patients on the placbo arm only once all study data has been submitted.  Patients who were 
randomized to the placebo arm will have a new form located in the week 10 folder in Rave 
called “Patient Crossover”  once all data has been submitted for all nine weeks.   If the 
patient decides to crossover and has previously consented to participate in VisionTree, the 
RA must go back into the patient’s Vision Tree account and activate the  placebo template  
See Appendix II  for further deta ils. 
 
5.4 Duration of Therapy  
For the double -blind portion of the study i n the absence of treatment delays due to 
adverse event(s), treatment may continue as specified , over 10 weeks,  or until one of the 
following criteria applies:  
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
 Unacceptable adverse event(s),  as described in Section 7 
 Patient decides to withdraw consent for participation in the study, or  
 General or specific changes in the pati ent's condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
 
5.5 Drug Discontinuation  (08-Jun-2018)  
Drug must be discontinued for patients who have documented allergic reaction at any 
grade.  Due to the nature  of the blinding, drug cannot be dose reduced and due to the 
nature of bupropion and the need to titrate, drug cannot be stopped and restarted.  Hence,  
participants who experience any grade 1, 2 or 3 (expected) event that is not tolerable  
will have study drug discontinued  upon discussion between the provider and participant.  
Grade 3 unexpected events attributable to the study drug will result in permanent study 
drug discontinuation.  Any grade 4 event will result in permanent study drug 
discontinuation.  
NRG -CC004  21  Version Date:  June 07, 2019   
Patients who wish to stop therapy due to intolerable side effects or any other desire to 
withdraw early from the study will need to titrate off of the study drug. For instances of 
early treatment discontinuation, NRG will not reveal treatment assignment bu t will require 
all patients taper off study drug by one capsule from bottle 3 for one week and then can 
stop the study drug.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6. TREATMENT MODIFICATI ONS /MANAG EMENT  (08-JUN -2018)  
Due to the nature of the blinding, patien ts will not be allowed to modify their dose.  If 
patients  are experiencing unwanted side effects, they may discontinue  study drug as outlined 
in Section 5.5 .   
 
If a patient forgets to take their morning dose, but remembers within 6 hours, they can still 
take their assigned dose.  If it is over 6 hours, they should wait until the next day.  Patients 
should NOT take extra doses.  
 
During the phone contact time points described in section 7.3.1 , assess the tolerability of any 
reported adverse events. Discontinue the study drug per section 5.5 .

have access to a copy of CTCAE versions 4.0 and 5.0, which can be downloaded from 
the CTEP web site 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/e lectronic_applications/ctc.htm.  
 
7.2.2 Definition of an Adverse Event (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not consider ed drug related.  Therefore, an AE can be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product (attribution of unrelated, 
unlikely, possible, probable, or definite). (International Conference on Harmonisation 
[ICH], E2A, E6).  
 
7.3 Adverse Events for Commercial Study Agents (08-Jun-2018)  
Refer to the package insert for detailed pharmacologic and safety information  
Side effects at doses of 300 mg/day (XL or SR formulation) with a prevalence of 5% or 
greater are listed: headache (XL 34%, SR 26%, plac 23%), nausea (XL & SR 13%, plac 
8%), dry mouth (XL 26%, SR 17% , plac 7%), constipation (XL 9%, SR 10%, plac 7%), 
insomnia (SR 11%, plac 6%), infection (plac 6%, SR 8%, XL 9%)  and diarrhea (plac 
6%, SR 5%, XL 7%)  and dizziness (XL 6%, SR 7%, plac 5%)  (GlaxoSmithKine 2011, 
Micromedex Healthcare Series 2008, GlaxoSmith Kline 2015, Fava et al. 2005 , 
Dailymed ). In addition, bupropion can be associated with anorexia, resulting in 5 pound 
weight loss in studies for about 23% of participants versus 11% on placebo, the XL is 
associated with nasopharyngeal effects (13% versus 1 2% placebo) and the SR 
formulation is associated with tremors (6% versus 1% in placebo).  
 
Note the black box warning for suicidal thoughts and behaviors in patients being treated 
for depression and neuropsychiatric reactions in patients taking bupropion s ustained 
release for smoking cessation. Please see the package insert for a detailed discussion of 
the black box warning.   
 
The following adverse events must be reported expeditiously:  any grade psychiatric 
serious adverse events   
 
7.3.1  Solicited Advers e Events and PRO -CTCAE   
Clinician graded CTCAE is the AE (adverse event) safety standard.  PRO -CTCAE items 
are to complement CTCAE reporting.  Patients will respond to PRO -CTCAE items but no 
protocol directed action will be taken. The specific PRO -CTCAE item s for this protocol 
NRG -CC004  23  Version Date:  June 07, 2019  can be found on the forms section of the CTSU protocol webpage and is titled “NRG -
CC004 NCI PRO -CTCAE Item Library. ” PRO -CTCAE is not intended for expedited 
reporting, real time review or safety reporting. PRO -CTCAE data are exploratory  and not 
currently intended for use in data safety monitoring or adverse event stopping rules . 
 NOTE:  PRO -CTCAE data should not be used for determining dose delays or dose 
modifications or any other protocol directed action   
  
 Collect the following  solicited  adverse events (CTCAE v.4):   tremor, dizziness, 
insomnia, headache, dry mouth, anorexia, nausea, constipation, nasal congestion and 
pharyng olaryngeal  pain.  
 
The patient will complete the PRO -CTCAE items  dizziness, insomnia, headache, dry 
mouth, decreased appe tite, nausea, constipation and the RA will assess for the solicited 
AEs ( CTCAE v. 4 items ) at phone contact points with the patient. This will include at the 
end of weeks 1, 2, 5, 7 and 9. These phon e call points are associated with key events in 
the study. The end of week 1 is to evaluate the ability to titrate to the assigned dose. Even 
though the CRA  will be blinded, it will be important for study personnel to contact 
patients at the end of week 1  to evaluate whether they experienced any unwanted effects 
that would result in their unwillingness to continue with the study. The end of week 2 
coincides with being at the target dose and this contact is again to evaluate whether there 
are tolerance issu es. The end of week 5 is a time when some secondary endpoints need to 
be completed so this contact will serve as that reminder as well as AE evaluation. The 
end of week 7 contact will encourage continued engagement in the study and the end of 
week 9 is the  end of the study when the measures will also need to be completed.

7.4 Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events  (08-Jun-2018)  
All serious adverse events that meet expedited reporting criteria de fined in the reporting 
table below will be reported via the CTEP Adverse Event Reporting System, CTEP -
AERS , accessed via the CTEP web site,  
https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers/pages/task?rand=1390853489613  
 
Submitting a report via CTEP -AERS  serves as notification to the NRG 
Biostatistical/Data Management Center and satisfies NRG requirements for expedited 
NRG -CC004  24  Version Date:  June 07, 2019  adverse event reporting.  
 
In the rare event when Internet connectivity is disrupted, a 24 -hour notification must be 
made to the NRG Biostatistical/Data Management Center  by phone, (number to be 
provided). An electronic report must be submitted immediately upon re -establishment of 
the Internet connection.  
 
7.4.1 Expedited Reporting Methods  
 CTEP -AERS -24 Hour Notification requires that a CTEP -AERS  24-hour notification 
is ele ctronically submitted within 24 hours of learning of the adverse event. Each 
CTEP -AERS 24-hour notification must be followed by a complete report within 5 
days. Supporting source document ation  is requested by NRG as needed to complete 
adverse event review . Supporting  source documentation  should  include the protocol 
number, patient ID number, and CTEP -AERS  ticket number on each page . For 
instructions to submit  supporting documentation to the NRG Oncology at 1 -215-574-
3191.   
 A serious adverse event that meets expedited reporting criteria outlined in the AE 
Reporting Tables  but is assessed by the CTEP -AERS  as “an action not 
recommended ” must still be reported to fulfill NRG safety reporting obligations. Sites 
must bypass the “NOT recommended ” assessment; the CTE P-AERS  allows 
submission of all reports regardless of the results of the assessment.  
 
7.4.2 Expedited Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events   
  
Any Phase Study Utilizing a Commercial Agent1 
 
FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR  Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not they are considered 
related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
 An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in i npatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization for ≥ 24 hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalizati on may be considered 
serious when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).

2019 ) 
8.1  Registration and Study Entry Procedures   
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
policy require all individuals contributing to NCI -sponsored trials to register and to renew 
their registration annually. To register, all individuals must obtain a Cancer T herapy 
Evaluation Program (CTEP) Identity and Access Management (IAM) account at 
https:// ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/iam . In addition, persons with a registration ty pe of 
Investigator (IVR), Non -Physician Investigator (NPIVR), or Associate Plus (AP) (i.e., 
clinical site staff requiring write access to OPEN, Rave, or acting as a primary site 
contact) must complete their annual registration using CTEP’s web -based Regist ration 
and Credential Repository (RCR) at https://ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/rcr.    
RCR utilizes five person registration types.  
 IVR — MD, DO, or international equivalent;  
 NPIVR — advanced practice providers (e.g., NP or PA) or graduate level researchers 
(e.g.,  PhD);  
 AP — clinical site staff (e.g., RN or CRA) with data entry access to CTSU 
applications (e.g., Roster Update Management System ( RUMS), OPEN, Rave,);  
 Associate (A) — other clinical site staff involved in the conduct of NCI -sponsored 
trials; and  
 Associ ate Basic (AB) — individuals (e.g., pharmaceutical company employees) with 
limited access to NCI -supported systems.  
RCR requires the following registration documents:

Female Sexual Function Index  (Weigel, Meston and Rosen 2005)   
The Female Sexual Function Index is a relatively brief measure (19 items) that has been 
developed and validated to be used across the age range of women, including 
postmenopausal women. Its conceptualization came out of an evolving understanding of 
female sexual functioning in recent years. It is a multi -dimensional measure that covers 
the major domains of female sexual functioning including desire, arousal, satisfaction and 
orgasm. Additionally, it addresses lubrication and pain. Its discriminate validity is based 
NRG -CC004  32  Version Date:  June 07, 2019  on its ability to differentiate women diagnosed with female sexual arousal disorder from 
normal controls. The FSFI looks at measures of both frequency and desire in each 
domain as well as satisfaction in most domains. The desire subscale consists of two items 
and has a range of 1.2 to 6 when scored. A cut off for less than normal desire has been 
determined to be less than 3.3. The FSFI has been used in both intervention and 
epidemiologic studies. The FSFI has been validated across a wide range of s exual 
problems, with the most recent Cronbach alpha’s being over 0.9 for internal reliability. A 
score of 26.55 (from a range of 2 to 36) was found to be the cut point to distinguish 
women with and without sexual dysfunction (lower scores indicating sexual  dysfunction). 
The FSFI has also been used with female gynecologic cancer survivors and was used in 
the Alliance N10C1 study that accrued mostly women with breast cancer  (Carpenter et al. 
2009).  This measure will be completed at baseline, 5 and 9 weeks.  For open label patient s 
it will be completed in weeks 4 and 8.  
 
PROMIS Sexual Health Measure  (Flynn et al. 2013)  
The PROMIS initiative or Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
is a large effort supported by the National Institute of Health  to improve measurement 
science related to self -reported health measures. There are numerous PROMIS measures 
in various stages of development and psychometric testing. To the extent possible, 
investigators are urged to use PROMIS measures to have some capa bility to compare 
across trials. The sexual function and satisfaction measure is one PROMIS tool that has 
good content, face, discriminant, and convergent validity, and is, therefore, ready to be 
incorporated into clinical trials. In particular, for women,  it demonstrates good 
convergent validity with the FSFI, which is considered the gold standard measure in 
sexual function. However, PROMIS is shorter and easier to score. In this study, the 
following will be used: the global satisfaction domain with 6 item s (correlation of 0.76 
with the FSFI satisfaction subscale) and interest domain with 4 items (correlation of 0.84 
with the FSFI desire subscale) with one question about interfering factors; fatigue, for a 
total of 11 items. PROMIS was created in such a way  that investigators can use items that 
are relevant to the population and the research question while maintaining validity.  This 
measure will be completed at baseline, 5 and 9 weeks.For open label p atient s it will be 
completed in weeks 4 and 8.  
 
PROMIS Fatigue 8  
Fatigue will be measured with the PROMIS short form 8a. This questionnaire contains 8 
questions related to severity, bother and activity interference related to fatigue.  
Responses are “not at all” to “very much” for 6 questions; and “never” to “al ways” for 
two questions. The perspective is in the last 7 days. The PROMIS measures have 
demonstrated good reliability and validity with a subset of 7 items correlating with the 
full fatigue item bank (95 items), with a correlation coefficient of r=0.76 an d correlations 
with the FACIT -F of 0.95. Even though the vitality subscale of the SF -36 was used in the 
previous vaginal symptom study and shown to significant predict variance in sexual 
health, the PROMIS fatigue correlated with the vitality subscale of t he SF -36 with a 
correlation coefficient of r=0.89, so this scale should be able to capture what is needed 
for this study  (Cell a et al. 2010).  This will be completed at baseline, 5 and 9 weeks. For 
open label patients  it will be completed in weeks 4 and 8.  
NRG -CC004  33  Version Date:  June 07, 2019   
PHQ -4  
The PHQ 4 was developed from the PHQ -9 and GAD -7 to be an ultra -brief screening 
tool for depression and anxiety disorders  (Kroenke 2009).  It has been validated in the 
general population and foun d to be comparable to the PHQ -8 (Lowe 2010). Scores on  the 
PHQ -4 range from 0 to 12, with scores 0 -2 being normal, 3 -5 indicating mild symptoms, 
6-8 moderate symptoms and 9 -12 severe.  Cronbach’s alpha for the 4 items was 0.85.  
The PHQ -4 was strongly correlated with the mental health subscale of the SF 20 (r =.80) 
and social functioning (r=.52).  These correlation coefficients were nearly identical to 
those of the PHQ -8 (Kroenke 2009).  This will be completed at baseline, 5 and 9 weeks. 
For open label p atients it will be completed in weeks 4 and 8.  
 
Global Impr ession of Change  (Sloan et al. 2002, Sloan et al. 2006)  
The Subject Global Impression of Change is a 7 -point item in which the participant rates 
the change in the sexual desire since beginning the study (ranging from “very much 
better,” “moderately better, ” “a little better,” “about the same,” “a little worse,” 
“moderately worse,” to “very much worse”). It has been used extensively for 
determination of minimally clinically significant differences in numerous oncology 
clinical trials. Two questions will be a sked using the 7 -point response scale, one on 
overall sexual desire and the other on energy/fatigue level.  
 
Additional risk/benefit investigator developed questions  will be included . The first is 
“How satisfied are you with the impact of the study drug on  your sexual desire? “not at 
all,” “a little ,” “somewhat ,” “quite a bit ,” “very much” and the second question will be, 
“Were the benefits of this treatment greater than any side effects you may have 
experienced?” (yes or no).  This form will ONLY be completed at the end of the study, at 
9 weeks.  
 
Side effect measures  
Patients will complete PRO -CTCAE items and the Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) 
will complete CTCAE items  plus the PRO -CTCAE items  at phone contact points with  
the patients . This will include at the end of weeks 1, 2, 5, 7 and 9. These phone call points 
are associated with key events in the study. The end of week 1 is to evaluate the ability to 
titrate to the assigned dose. Even though the CRA will be blinded, it will be imp ortant for 
study personnel to contact patients at the end of week 1 to evaluate whether they 
experienced any unwanted effects that would result in their unwillingness to continue 
with the study. The end of week 2 coincides with being at the target dose and  this contact 
is again to evaluate whether there are tolerance issues. The end of week 5 is a time when 
the primary endpoint and some secondary endpoints need to be completed so this contact 
will serve as that reminder as well as AE evaluation. The end of week 7 contact will 
encourage continued engagement in the study and the end of week 9 is the end of the 
study when the measures will also need to be completed.  
 
Impact of Treatment Scale   
This scale is a measure of body change stress and was developed by i nvestigators at The 
Ohio State University. It was developed and tested specifically in women with breast 
NRG -CC004  34  Version Date:  June 07, 2019  cancer and then edited and tested in women with gynecologic cancer. It has demonstrated 
good reliability and validity in both samples,  with Cronbach al phas over .90 (Frierson, 
Thiel and Andersen 2006). It was able to discriminate between women with lower and 
higher satisfaction with their sexual life  (Frierson, Thiel and Andersen 2006).  This 
measure is being included only at baseline, as body image is o ne of the known predictors 
of sexual health.  
 
Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale   
This is a 14 -item scale that measures relationship functioning and has been recently used 
in a study of breast cancer survivors. The instrument provides an overall adjustment sc ore 
as well as subscale scores for cohesion, consensus and satisfaction. Overall scores range 
from 0 to 69, with lower scores indicating more relationship problems. Work has been 
accomplished to establish a cut off score of <41 to screen for poor relations hips (Rowland 
et al. 2009).  The scale has demonstrated good validity confirmed through factor analysis 
and reliability. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients are .81 for the consensus subscale, .85 for 
satisfaction and .80 for cohesion. The total scale score has a  Cronbach’s alpha coefficient 
of .90  (Busby et al. 1995).  The Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale will be completed  at 
baseline  only. 
 
11.2 Optional Online Completion of Patient -Reported QOL Assessments  (9/8/17) 
Missing data are a significant problem, particul arly for QOL assessments. Unlike data for 
traditional endpoints, such as survival, QOL data can never be obtained retrospectively if 
it is not provided by the patient at the appropriate time point. This limits researchers’ 
ability to accurately perform QOL  statistical analyses and negatively impacts the clinical 
relevance of this effort. Typically, QOL forms are filled out in hardcopy (paper). To 
provide a more convenient method of completing QOL assessments, NRG Oncology is 
working with VisionTree Software , Inc., San Diego, CA. VisionTree offers patients on 
this study the option of completing their QOL forms online from any location that has a 
computer with Internet access, including the patient’s home, and provides reminders to 
patients to complete the ass essments.  
 
VisionTree has developed a tool, VisionTree Optimal Care (VTOC), a HIPAA -secure, 
user friendly, web -based software system (Gorgulho 2005; Gorgulho 2007; Pedroso 
2006). The VTOC tool contains a web -based system for global patient and trial 
admin istration access, which allows improved compliance and accuracy of data 
collection, validation, and reporting. It is compliant with the Title 21, Code of Federal 
Regulations, Part 11 statistical process control system and provides a mobile solution for 
clinical trials. QOL data are collected with Microsoft Excel and PDF export of reports. 
VTOC also has mobile messaging and e -mail reminders. Surveys can be “pushed” to 
patients for completion at timed intervals (see http://www.visiontree.com  for details). 
This technology allows consenting patients on this study to fill out their QOL forms 
online from any location and to receive e -mail reminders to complete assessments. E -
mail reminders also can be sent to research associates (RAs) at the appr opriate 
institutions to remind them that a QOL time point window is about to close so that a 
patient can be contacted to fill out QOL information on time, before it becomes “missing 
data.”  
NRG -CC004  35  Version Date:  June 07, 2019   
In a pilot RTOG study (RTOG 0828), the compliance rate of patients  completing QOL 
assessments at 6 months significantly improved using electronic technology. Based on 
this pilot data, NRG Oncology is offering VisionTree as an option in other studies, 
including this one. Patients preferring to complete hardcopy QOL assess ments can do so. 
The QOL forms completed via VTOC are identical to the hardcopy forms; this 
technology does not add to or change the QOL assessments in this study.  
 
For this trial, the baseline QOL forms must be completed in hardcopy  (on paper)  prior to 
the start of tre atment. In addition, should the patient cross over and continue to weeks 14 
and 18, then the Female Sexual Function Index, the PHQ -4, the pROMIS fatigue short 
form 8a, the PROMIS sexual function and satisfaction must be completed in hardcopy 
(on paper). To complete subsequent QOL forms online, patients will be asked for an e -
mail address that they consent to use so that e -mail reminders may be sent to them. The 
patient’s e -mail address also will be used for password -protected access to VTOC. 
Patients who are interested in participating but do not yet have an e -mail address can 
obtain one for free from a number of sources (e.g. Yahoo!, Hotmail, or AOL). Note: The 
site RA is responsible for setting up the patient’s account on VTOC. The RA may do so 
by logging on the VTOC portal at the following link: https://rtog.optimalcare.com - 
medical team.  RA login information will be provided by VTOC after the patient is 
randomized to the study. The patient’s VTOC account must be set up within 14 days after  
randomization.   
 
Patients will receive a login card (either printed or sent via e -mail) with which to log in 
using the secure, web -based VTOC portal. VTOC meets all HIPAA guidelines and is 
encrypted (via 128 -bit SSL) for the security, privacy, and confide ntiality of QOL 
information. It is similar to the secure login commonly used when performing online 
banking. The login card can then be kept and maintained by the patient.  
 
The patient’s e -mail address only will be used by NRG Oncology for this purpose. 
Patients will be sent e -mail reminders to complete QOL forms. A typical e -mail reminder 
would read: “ Your Quality of Life forms for the study, NRG -xxxxx, are now due. Please 
go to http://www.optimalcare.com , use y our secure login, and complete the online forms. 
If any questions make you feel uncomfortable, you may skip those questions and not give 
an answer. If you have any questions, please e -mail or call your research associate at 
[insert RA e -mail address] or [i nsert RA telephone number]. Thank you for participating 
in this study.” The reminders will be created by NRG Oncology and placed into a study 
template that will be sent to patients at customized intervals (at the time points when 
QOL forms are due). The fi rst reminder will be sent at the beginning of the “window” to 
complete a QOL form, with a second reminder halfway through the window period if the 
QOL forms are not yet completed at that time point. A maximum of 3 reminders will be 
sent for each of the 7 QOL time points (following the baseline QOL forms, which are 
completed in hardcopy , and including the optional open label portion for women 
receiving placebo ). After a patient has completed all forms in the VTOC portal, a 
dialogue box will appear that says “Thank you for completing your Quality of Life 
forms,” and the patient will no longer receive any remaining notices for that time point. 
NRG -CC004  36  Version Date:  June 07, 2019  The site RA or study administrator will be informed through the VTOC “At -A-Glance” 
form management system when QOL form s have been completed.  
 
12. DATA AND RECORDS  
12.1 Data Management/Collection  (07-JUN -2019)  
Medidata Rave is a clinical data management system being used for data collection for 
this trial/study. Access to the trial in Rave is controlled through the CTEP -IAM system 
and role assignments. To access Rave via iMedidata:  
 Site staff will need to be registered with CTEP and have a valid and active CTEP -
IAM account; and  
 Assigned one of the following Rave roles on the relevant Lead Protocol 
Organization (LPO) or Participating Organization roster at the enrolling site: Rave 
CRA, Rave Read Only, Rave CRA (LabAdmin), Rave SLA, or Rave Investigator. 
Refer to https://ctep.cancer.gov/investigatorResources/default.htm  for registration 
types and documentation required.  
o To hold Rave CRA or Rave CRA (Lab Admin) role, site staff must hold a 
minimum of an AP regi stration type;  
o To hold Rave Investigator role, the individual must be registered as an 
NPIVR or IVR; and  
o To hold Rave Read Only role, site staff must hold an Associates (A) 
registration type.  
Upon initial site registration approval for the study in Regulat ory Support System (RSS), 
all persons with Rave roles assigned on the appropriate roster will be sent a study 
invitation e -mail from iMedidata.  To accept the invitation, site staff must log in to the 
Select Login ( https://login.imedidata.com/selectlogin ) using their CTEP -IAM username 
and password, and click on the accept  link in the upper right -corner of the iMedidata 
page.  Site staff will not be able to access the study in Rave until all r equired Medidata 
and study specific trainings are completed.  Trainings will be in the form of electronic 
learnings (eLearnings), and can be accessed by clicking on the link in the upper right 
pane of the iMedidata screen. If an eLearning is required and ha s not yet been taken, the 
link to the eLearning will appear under the study name in iMedidata instead of the Rave 
EDC  link; once the successful completion of the eLearning has been recorded, access to 
the study in Rave will be granted, and a Rave EDC  link will display under the study 
name.  
Site staff that have not previously activated their iMedidata/Rave account at the time of 
initial site registration approval for the study in RSS will also receive a separate invitation 
from iMedidata to activate their a ccount.  Account activation instructions are located on 
the CTSU website in the Rave section under the Rave resource materials (Medidata 
Account Activation and Study Invitation Acceptance). Additional information on 
iMedidata/Rave is available on the CTSU m embers’ website in the Data Management >  
Rave section at www.ctsu.org/RAVE/  or by contacting the CTSU Help Desk at 1 -888-
823-5923 or by e -mail at ctsucontact@westat.com .   
NRG -CC004  37  Version Date:  June 07, 2019  Collection of Quality of Life Questionnaires  
Patient s will be permitted to complete questionnaires at the study site or at home.  For 
convenience, patients  can be given stamped, self -addressed envelopes in which to mail 
completed questionnaires back at 5 and 9 weeks.  
 
12.2 Summary of Data Submission  
Patients will complete PRO -CTCAE items and the Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) 
will complete CTCAE items at pho ne contact points with patients . This will include at 
the end of weeks 1, 2, 5, 7 and 9. These phone call points are associated with key events 
in the study. The end of week 1 is to evaluate the ability to titrate to the assigned dose. 
Even though provider s will be blinded, it will be important for study personnel to contact 
patients at the end of week 1 to evaluate whether they experienced any unwanted effects 
that would result in their unwillingness to continue with the study. The end of week 2 
coincides with being at the target dose and this contact is again to evaluate whether there 
are tolerance issues. The end of week 5 is a time some secondary endpoints need to be 
completed so this contact will serve as that reminder as well as AE evaluation. The end of 
week 7 contact will encourage continued engagement in the study and the end of week 9 
is the end of the study when the measures will also need to be completed  including the 
primary endpoint . 
 
The AE data will be entered into the RAVE using the standard RAVE AE form.  Keep a 
source documentation for the AE collection in the patient’s record.  
Summary of Data Submission : Refer to the NRG website  
 
12.3 Data Quality Portal (07-JUN -2019)  
The Data Quality Portal (DQP) provides a central location for site staff to m anage 
unanswered queries and form delinquencies, monitor data quality and timeliness, 
generate reports, and review metrics.  
The DQP is located on the CTSU members’ website under Data Management. 
The Rave Home section displays a table providing summary cou nts of Total 
Delinquencies and Total Queries. DQP Queries, DQP Delinquent Forms and the 
DQP Reports modules are available to access details and reports of unanswered 
queries, delinquent forms, and timeliness reports. Review the DQP modules on a 
regular bas is to manage specified queries and delinquent forms.  
The DQP is accessible by site staff that are rostered to a site and have access to 
the CTSU website.  Staff that have Rave study access can access the Rave study 
data using a direct link on the DQP.  
To le arn more about DQP use and access, click on the Help icon displayed on the 
Rave Home, DQP Queries, and DQP Delinquent Forms modules.  
Note: Some Rave protocols may not have delinquent form details or reports specified on 
the DQP.  A protocol must have the Ca lendar functionality implemented in Rave by the 
Lead Protocol Organization (LPO) for delinquent form details and reports to be available 
on the DQP.  Site staff should contact the LPO Data Manager for their protocol regarding 
questions about Rave Calendarin g functionality.   
NRG -CC004  38  Version Date:  June 07, 2019   
12.4 Global Reporting/Monitoring  
This study will be monitored by the Clinical Data Update System (CDUS) version 3.0. 
Cumulative CDUS data will be submitted quarterly to CTEP by electronic means. 
Reports are due January 31, April 30, July 31,  and October 31.  
 
13. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
13.1 Study Design  
 This is  a prospective, randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled phase II trial will 
determine which Bupropion dose, if any, will move to a phase III trial.  Patients will be 
stratified b y current SSRI use (yes vs. no), prior pelvic treatment (none vs. pelvic surgery 
and/or pelvic RT), and aromatase inhibitor use (yes vs. no) and then randomized 1:1:1 to 
receive a150XL target dose of Bupropion, a 300 XL target dose of Buproprion, or 
placeb o.  The target accrual is 234 patients and patients will be analyzed according to the 
intent -to-treat principle  using all enrolled at -risk patients . 
13.2 Study Endpoints  
13.2.1  Primary Endpoint  
 Change in sexual desire, as measured by the desire subscale of the Female FSFI, from 
baseline to 9 weeks  
13.2.2  Secondary Endpoints  
 Adverse events , including PRO -CTCAE  
 Fatigue, as measured by PROMIS fatigue scale  
 Sexual desire, as measured by the desire subscale of the FSFI  at 5 weeks  and 
PROMIS sexual desire and s atisfaction measure  at 5 and 9 weeks  
 Sexual functioning, as measured by the FSFI total score  
 Depressive mood, as measured by the PHQ -4 
 Patient’s perception of change, as measured by the Global Impression of Change 
scale, and risk vs. benefit  
 
13.3 Primary Objectives Study Design  
13.3.1 Primary Hypothesis and Endpoints  
The primary hypothesis is the intervention (Bupropion 150 XL or 300XL ) will result in 
improved sexual desire, as measured by the sexual desire subscale of the FSFI , greater 
than that of the placebo . 
13.3.2 How  Primary Endpoints Will Be Analyzed  
The primary endpoint, change from baseline to 9 weeks  in FSFI desire subscale (sum of 
questions 1 and 2 on the FSFI), will be tested between both bupropion arms and the 
control arm using a t-test with each comparison having a  1-sided  significance level of 
0.05.   Effect sizes between placebo and each treatment arm will be reported.  The desire 
subscale will be scored at each data point according to the scoring guidelines.  The 
change score  will be calculated  as baseline subtracted from follow -up score .  
Longitudinal trends in FSFI desire subscalewill be assessed using a mixed effects model 
with maximum likelihood estimation  on the mean scores with treatment arm , treatment 
by time interaction, baseli ne FSFI desire subscale score,   and PROMIS fatigue score as 
covariates to assess the impact of treatment and fatigue. Other covariates of interest are 
stratification factors (SSRI use , prior pelvic treatment  and aromatase inhibitor use ), 
NRG -CC004  39  Version Date:  June 07, 2019  sociodemographic v ariables [age, race, disease type, current treatment, partner status, 
time since diagnosis, (<5 years, 5 -10 years, >1 year) and BMI ], baseline impact of 
treatment scale score, and baseline revised dyadic adjustment scale score.  Since the 
revised dyadic ad justment scale is to be completed only by patients with a partner, 
separate models will be run with and without this covariate as the sample size will be 
decreased when this variable is included.  Inclusion of the impact of treatment scale 
allows for contr olling the influence of body image on sexual desire.  Inclusion of the 
revised dyadic adjustment scale score will allow control of potential confounding of 
effect of partner issues.   
 
Each FSFI subscale score will be assessed for confounding the treatment effect of on 
desire.  General linear models (GLMs) will be used to assess this with FSFI desire 
subscale change score as the dependent variable separately at 5 and 9 weeks with  other 
relevant  subscale score s (arousal, lubrication, orgasm, and pain) at the corresponding 
time point as an independent variable along with baseline FSFI desire subscale score and 
treatment arm.  For the model with pain, whether the patient has clitoral and labial pain 
and an interaction between clitoral or labial pain and FSFI pai n subscale score will also 
be included as independent variables.  If any of these subscales shows evidence of 
confounding, they will be incorporated into the main FSFI desire subscale model 
described above.  
 
Missing data will be assessed. If ≥15% of the da ta is missing at any time point for the 
FSFI desire subscale score, patient characteristics will be compared between patients with 
completed assessments and those with missing assessments. Graphical methods may also 
be used to determine the type of missing ness.  If the missingness is determined to be 
ignorable, no additional analyses need to occur. If the missingness is determined to be 
non-ignorable, other methods, such as imputation and pattern mixture models, may be 
performed.   
 
Since the FSFI desire su bscale consists of only 2 items, an assessment of floor and effects 
will be performed.  Counts and frequencies of patients who experienced floor effects will 
be provided by arm for each time point of FSFI collection.  This will be done to inform 
the phase III trial if bupropion appears to be helpful. Due to the eligibility criteria of 
patients scoring < 3.3 on the desire subscale at baseline, ceiling effects will not occur.  
 
In order to move forward with a phase III study evaluating bupropion for sexual des ire, at 
least one dose of bupropion would need to result in statistically significant improvement  
over placebo as measured by the desire subscale of FSFI. This bupropion dose would 
need to meet the following criteria:  
 be absent of grade 4+ SAE’s attributab le to treatment  
 ≤ 20% of patients on the bupropion arm of interest would not have stopped 
protocol treatment based on AE’s  
If both doses equally improve sexual desire as measured by the FSFI desire subscale, the 
dose that meets the above criteria would move forward. If both doses meet the above 
criteria, then the lower dose  will move  forward  to the phase III trial .  
 
NRG -CC004  40  Version Date:  June 07, 2019  If neither dose meets the desired effect size but less than or equal to 20% of patients have 
not terminated treatment early  and there are n o grade 4 SAE’s attributable to study 
treatment, then a n analysis will be conducted to determine  the effect of the assigned 
treatment in those patients who score in the “normal” range  of the dyspareunia subscale , 
dyspareunia subscale score > 3 .  Specifical ly, a general linear model will be performed 
with desire subscale change score at 9 weeks as the dependent variable and treatment 
arm, dyspareunia (as a binary variable) at 9 weeks, and a treatment by dyspareunia 
interaction as independent variables.   If there is a clear signal that a bupropion dose has a 
positive impact when vaginal atrophy symptoms are less severe , it can be  argue d that 
bupropion should be studied further.  In other words, a lack of effect in the entire 
population could be confounded too much by vaginal atrophy symptoms.  To make 
vaginal atrophy an exclusion, however, would make the study nearly impossible to recruit 
to.  The overall plan for this research is to identify effective interventions for various 
components of sexual health.  In clinical practice, as these treatments are implemented, it 
would be expected that if a woman had low desire and vaginal atrophy symptoms, that 
both would be treated , which would be the plan for the phase III trial .     
 
13.3.3 Sample Size and Power Calcula tions  
The primary endpoint of this trial is the change in FSFI desire subscale score from 
baseline to 9 weeks.  The FSFI is the current gold standard for the measurement of 
female sexual health and it contains a validated subscale specific to sexual desire . This 
was one of the outcomes used in the FDA approved drug , flibanserin, for Hypoactive 
Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD) . Since there is limited data using this drug in this patient 
population, an effect size will be used to calculate the sample size.  Cohe n’s widely used 
guidelines for interpreting the magnitude of difference define 0.8 standard deviation (SD) 
as a “large” effect size, 0.5 SD as a “medium” effect size, and 0.2 SD as a “ small” effect 
size (Cohen 1988).  In this trial looking for a signal to  move forward to a phase III trial, a 
small to moderate effect size of 0.4 5 will be used.  Studies in different patient populations 
and those using different interventions, such as flibanserin, have shown similar effect 
sizes  (DeRogatis 2012)  with recent meta -analysis demonstrating an effect size of 0.4 
(Jaspers 2016) .  Using a two sample t -test with a one -sided type I error of 0. 05 (overall 
type I error of 0. 1 after a Bonferroni correction) and an effect size of 0.4 5, 62 
patients/arm will be needed to achieve 80% statistical power.  After adjusting for 20% 
non-compliance, 234 patients will be enrolled in this trial.  
 
13.4 Study Monitoring of Primary Objectives  
Interim Analysis for the DMC  
The NRG Oncology Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review the study twice a 
year with respect to patient accrual and morbidity. The DMC also will review the study 
on an “as needed” basis.  
 
13.5 Accrual /Study Duration Considerations   
 This study will on ly be open to NRG Oncology NCORP sites. Previous randomized 
controlled trials for vaginal symptoms and sexual desire have been completed in a timely 
fashion in the NCORP mechanism [NCCTG now Alliance ] trials N10C1 DHEA for 
vaginal symptoms and N02C3 Evalua tion of transdermal testosterone for libido). The 
NRG -CC004  41  Version Date:  June 07, 2019  DHEA study recruited 464 women from 82 NCORP sites between July, 2011 and May, 
2013. The transdermal testosterone for libido study recruited 150 women in just 8 
months.  
     
 It is expected that due to regu latory processes at the site, the first 6 months after study 
activation will result in negligible accrual. Once sites have the study active, it is projected 
to accrue 10 patients/month after the initial 6 month period which results in a total study 
duratio n of approximately 2 years. During months 6 -8 after activation, accrual will be 
monitored. If the accrual rate during this period is < 50% of the expected monthly accrual 
rate, the study team, with input from the NRG Oncology, DMC will evaluate whether the  
trial should be opened to the entire NRG Oncology membership.  
 
13.6 Secondary or Exploratory Endpoints  (including correlative science aims)  
13.6.1 Secondary Hypotheses and Endpoints :  
 Evaluation of adverse events, including PRO -CTCAE, specifically it is hypothesized 
that there will not be any grade 4+ AEs related to treatment  
 Comparison of fatigue, as measured by the PROMIS fatigue at baseline, 5 and 9 
weeks, between the placebo and each intervention arm and determine it’s impact and 
association on sexual  desire and sexual functioning  
 Comparison of sexual desire, as measured by the desire subscale of the FSFI  at 
baseline and 5 weeks and PROMIS sexual desire and satisfaction measure at baseline, 
5 and 9 weeks, between the placebo and each intervention arm  
 Comparison of sexual functioning, as measured by the FSFI total score  at baseline, 5 
and 9 weeks, between the placebo and each intervention arm  
 Evaluation of depressive mood, as measured by the PHQ -4 at baseline, 5 and 9 weeks  
 Patient’s perception of chang e, as measured by the Global Impression of Change 
scale  at 9 weeks,  and risk vs. benefit, measured at 9 weeks, between the placebo and 
each intervention arm  
13.6.2 Definitions of Secondary Endpoints and How These Will Be Analyzed  
  Adverse events  
 Adverse  events (AEs) will be graded according to the NCI’s Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events  (CTCAE) v. 5.0.  Adverse events will also be assessed using 
PRO -CTCAE items.  PRO -CTCAE items of I nterest  that are associated with potential 
drug side effec ts, based on the well -documented AEs of bupropion, include: tremors, 
dizziness, insomnia, headache, dry mouth, decreased appetite, nausea, and constipation. 
Counts of all AEs by grade will be provided by treatment arm. Nasopharyngeal effects will 
be graded using the CTCAE, two items from the Respiratory category: nasal congestion 
and pharyngeal pain (dryness). Patients will complete PRO -CTCAE items and providers 
will complete CTCAE items at the end of weeks 1, 2, 5, 7 an d 9.   
 
 Counts and frequencies will be provided for the worst grade AE experienced by the patient 
by treatment arm.  The distribution of AE grade and PRO -CTCAE score in each 
intervention  arm will be compared to the placebo arm using a chi -square test , or Fisher’s 
exact test if cell frequencies are < 5,  at the one -sided 0.05 significance level . Missing data 
will be assessed as described in Section 13.3.2.  
 
NRG -CC004  42  Version Date:  June 07, 2019    Fatigue  
Fatigue,  which is believed to be a potential med iator,  will be measured by the PROMIS 
fatigue at baseline and 5 and 9 weeks from the start of treatment.  The change from 
baseline to 5 and 9 weeks will be compared between the placebo and each intervention 
arm using a t -test, or Wilcoxon test if the data  is non -normal,  and compared at the one -
sided 0.05 significance level.  Spearman correlation coefficients will be used to assess the 
association between fatigue and sexual desire, as measured by both the sexual desire 
subscale of the FSFI and the PROMIS sexual desire and satisfaction measure,  and sexual 
functioning, as measured by the FSFI total score,  at each time point.   Missing data will be 
assessed as described in Section 13.3.2.   
 
 Dyspareunia  
Dyspareunia  will be measured using the FSFI d yspareunia subscale score at baseline, 5 
and 9 weeks.  It will be assessed using a cutpoint of ≤3 (painful intercourse) vs. >3 (not 
painful intercourse; Wiegel 2005).  The percent of patients with and without painful 
intercourse at each follow -up time point will be compared between the placebo and each 
intervention arm using a chi -square test, or Fisher’s exact test if cell frequencies are < 5.  
In order to also assess the effect clitoral or labial pain have on painful inte rcourse, logistic 
regression will be used at each follow -up time point (ref).  If one of the groups has a very 
small frequency of events (<5%), Firth’s penalized likliehood will be used as maximum 
likelihood estimation may be biased (Firth 1993).  Stratifi cation factors, baseline 
dyspareunia (defined using the cutpoint), and other sociodemographic variables may also 
be considered for inclusion in the model.  Missing data will be assessed as described in 
Section 13.3.2.   
 
  Sexual Desire  
 Sexual desire will be measured by the sexual desire subscale of the FSFI and the 
PROMIS sexual desire and satisfaction measure at baseline, 5 and 9 weeks from the start 
of treatment.  The primary endpoint compares the change from baseline to 9 weeks using 
the sexual desire subscale of the FSFI.  The PROMIS sexual desire and satisfaction 
measure was chosen to be a secondary endpoint, as it is a relatively newly validated 
measure for sexual health.  This endpoint will include compari son of the placebo and 
intervention arms of the change from baseline to 5 weeks for both sexual desire tools as 
well as the change from baseline to 9 weeks using the PROMIS sexual desire and 
satisfaction measure using a t -test, or Wilcoxon test if the data  is non -normal,  and 
compared at the one -sided 0.05 significance level.  A longitudinal model for the FSFI 
desire subscale is described in Section 13.3.2.  Similarly, l ongitudinal trends in PROMIS 
sexual desire an d satisfaction measure  will be assessed using a mixed effects model with 
maximum likelihood estimation  on the mean scores with treatment arm , baseline 
PROMIS sexual desire score,  and PROMIS fatigue score as covariates to assess the 
impact of treatment and fatigue. Other covariates of interest are stratification factors 
(SSRI use and aromatase inhibitor use ), sociodemographic variables (age, race, disease 
type, current treatment, p artner status, and BMI), baseline impact of treatment scale 
score, and baseline revised dyadic adjustment scale score.  Inclusion of the impact of 
treatment scale allows for controlling the influence of body image on sexual desire.  
Inclusion of the revise d dyadic adjustment scale score will allow control of potential 
NRG -CC004  43  Version Date:  June 07, 2019  confounding of effect of partner issues.  Missing data will be assessed as described in 
13.3.2.   
 
  Sexual Functioning  
 Sexual functioning will be m easured using the FSFI total score at baseline, 5 and 9 
weeks.  The change from baseline to 5 and 9 weeks will be compared between the placebo 
and each intervention arm using a t -test, or Wilcoxon test if the data is non -normal,  and 
compared at the one -sided 0.05 significance level. L ongitudinal trends in FSFI total score  
will be assessed using a mixed effects model with maximum likelihood estimation  on the 
mean scores with treatment arm and PROMIS fatigue score as covariates to assess the 
impact of treatmen t and fatigue. Other covariates of interest are stratification factors 
(SSRI use and aromatase inhibitor use ), sociodemographic variables (age, race, disease 
type, current treatment, partner status, and BMI), baseline impact of treatment scale 
score, and b aseline revised dyadic adjustment scale score.  Inclusion of the impact of 
treatment scale allows for controlling the influence of body image on sexual desire.  
Inclusion of the revised dyadic adjustment scale score will allow control of potential 
confound ing of effect of partner issues.  Missing data will be assessed as described in 
Section 13.3.2.   
 
Depressive Mood  
Depressive mood will be measured using the PHQ -4 at baseline, 5 and 9 weeks.  
Depressive mood at each time point will be compared between the placebo and each 
intervention arm using a t -test, or Wilcoxon test if the data is non -normal,  and compared 
at the one -sided 0.05 significance level.  Since bupropion is an anti -depressant, it is 
expected that pa tients on the bupropion arms will have improved mood as compared to 
those on placebo.  Spearman correlation coefficients will be used to assess the association 
between depressive mood and sexual desire, as measured by both the sexual desire 
subscale of the  FSFI and the PROMIS sexual desire and satisfaction measure,  sexual 
functioning, as measured by the FSFI total score,  and fatigue, as measured by the 
PROMIS fatigue, at each time point.   If depressive mood is found to be associated with 
sexual desire, it w ill be considered in the longitudinal model for sexual desire using the 
FSFI desire subscale.  Missing data will be assessed as described in Section 13.3.2.   
 
  Patient’s perception of change and risk vs. benefi t 
The Global Impression of Change will be asses sed by dividing responses into two  
categories: positive response (patients reporting “a little better to very much better”) and 
negative response (patients reporting “the same to very much worse”).  This is me asure 
will be used assess the degree of perceived benefit patients had from the study agent. This 
will help to explore the clinical significance of the statistical changes on the primary and 
secondary endpoints such as sexual desire and sexual functioning.  Assessment of the 
patient’s perception of risk vs. benefit will be performed after determining the percentage 
of women responding “yes” to the question about benefits being greater than the side 
effects and the percentage responding “somewhat” or better t o the question about 
satisfaction with treatment.   These questions will be used in the decision rule for a phase 
III trial. Differences between treatment arms will be tested using the chi -square test , or 
Fisher’s exact test if cell frequencies are < 5,  for these comparisons  at the one -sided 0.05 
NRG -CC004  44  Version Date:  June 07, 2019  significance level .

Bupropion is a strong CYP 2D6 inhibito r.  That means that if another drug is primarily metabolized by 
CYP2D6 (called a CYP2D6 substrate) then taking that drug with bupropion may impact the effect or 
toxicity of the drug.  Therefore, it is important that you look up each participant’s usual dru gs to make sure 
they are not taking any CYP2D6 substrates.   Some of the main ones are listed below but this is not a all -
inclusive or comprehensive list.   If you don’t see a drug, nutrition or herbal supplement on this list, that 
doesn’t mean it is ok to take with bupropion.

SAFETY PLAN  
 
PHQ -4 Assessment of Depression/Anxiety  
The PHQ -4 is a  screening questionnaire evaluating depression and anxiety and is  included in this 
protocol related to eligibility, and is  repeated at weeks 5 and 9.  The Stage I Screening 
assessment will be done in person and the Stage II Follow -Up assessment will be done according 
to site procedures , either by phone or in person.  This Safety Plan provides detailed instructions 
on reporting severe depression or anxiety  based on the PHQ -4 screening tool. The healthcare 
team  will be required to respond in accordance with this Safety Plan in the event that the 
participant scores either 6 to 8 or 9 or higher.  
 
PHQ -4 Emergent Risk :  further assessment for elevated anxiety or  depression requiring 
intervention will be presumed with a score of 9 or higher.  
 
PHQ -4 Non -emergent risk :  Participants who score 6 to 8 will be offered a referral for further 
assessment and help.  
 
Emergent Risk Policy  
Participants who score 9 or higher on the PHQ -4 are required to undergo evaluation by a 
clinician in the patient’s cancer care setting to assess degree of risk. If a participant meets criteria 
for this, notify clinical staff immediately that the patient requires a risk assessment prior to 
leaving the clinic.  
 
Inform the participant that you are required by protocol to request further assessment based on 
the total score on the questionnaire.  
 
If the participant refuses or denies acute distress, suicidality or acute anxiety, let the particip ant 
know you are required to complete a report and to notify their health care provider about the 
assessment result.  Council the patient to contact their health care provider if they feel acute 
distress and to call 911.  
 
The Informed Consent gives us permission and it is  not a breech of confide ntialit . Once clinical 
staff have been notified, your responsibility has been discharged.

Study Rationale
There i s little published research on Juvenile Primary  Fibromyalgia Syndrome (JPFS), yet 
available literature suggests this condit ion is associated with significant morbidit y and di sabili ty 
in adolescents. Prevalence rates in so me countries are estimated fro m 1.2% to 6.2%, with the 
rate in the United States not known.  To date, there are no published drug efficacy studies in this 
popul ation, nor i s there a drug approved for FM or JPFS in the adolescent age range.  
Duloxetine is approved for the management of fibro myalgia (FM) in adults . Upon approval of 
that indication, the US Food and Drug Administratio n (FDA), under the Pediatric Research 
Equity Act (PREA), required Lilly  to conduct a deferred study  to assess safet y and effect iveness 
of duloxetinein pediatric patients with FM aged 13 to 17 years. Specific facets of this protocol 
and study  design were em ployed to address the requi rements of that deferred research.

Entered:  300
Enrolled/Randomized:  210
Completed (Acute P eriod ):  163Phase of Development: Phase 3b 
Length of Study:   
Planned first patient visit:  February 2011                
Planned last patient visit (Acute P eriod):  September 2014
Planned last patient visit (Extension P eriod):  April 2015
Objectives:   
The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of duloxetine 30/60 mg once daily (QD) compared with 
placebo on the reduction of average pain severity as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) –
Modified Short Form : Adolescent Version 24-hour average pain severity rating (for simplicity, it is 
referred to as the BPI average pain severity here after) during a 13 -
week, double -blind treatment phase in 
adolescents (aged 13 to 17 years) with Juvenile Primary Fibromyalgia Syndrome (JPFS).
The secondary obj ectives of the study are:
To evaluate the efficacy of duloxetine 30/60 mg QD compared with placebo forthe treatment of 
JPFS in adolescents during a 13 -week, double -blind treatment phase , as assessed by the change 
from baseline on the following measures:
oBrief Pain Inventory (BPI) Modified Short Form : Adolescent Version severity (worst pain, 
least pain, pain right now) and interference.
oResponse to treatment, as defined by a 30% and 50% reduction in the BPI average pain 
severity .
oPediatric Pain Questionnai re (PPQ) pain right now, and worst pain and average pain items.
oClinical Global Impression of Severity, Overall (CGI-Severity: Overall) scale.

oFunctional Disability Inventory -child version scale (FDI -child).
oFunctional Disability Inventory -parent versio n scale (FDI -parent).
oChildren's Depression Inventory (CDI).
oMultidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC).
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of d uloxetine 30/60 mg QD compared with placebo for the 
treatment of JPFS in adolescents during a 13 -week, double -blind treatment phase .
To evaluate the efficacy and safety  of duloxetine 30/60 mg QD during a 26 -week, open -label, 
extension treatment phase , as a ssessed by the following :
oMaintenance effect of duloxetine 30/6 0 mg QD during the open -label extension treatment 
phase. Maintenance effect will be assessed using the BPI average pain severity in only  the 
acute phase responders (defined as those patients with ≥30% pain reduction from baseline on 
the BPI average pain severity measure) .
oEffect of duloxetine 30/60 mg QD during extension treatment p hase as measured by the 
following: BPI, PPQ, CGI -Severity: Overall, CGI -Severity: Mental Illness, FDI-ch ild, FDI -
parent, CDI, and MASC.
oSafety of duloxetine 30/60 mg QD during extension treatment p hase.
The exploratory objectives of the study are:
To evaluate the correlation between BPI severity pain items and PPQ pain items.
To evaluate the appropriateness of the American College of Rheumatology ( ACR )fibrom yalgia 
(FM) criteria in an adolescent population.

LY248686Statistical Methods:   
This is a randomized, double -blind, parallel, placebo -controlled comparison trial with 4 study periods 
(screening period , double -blind treatment perio d, open-label extension period , drug ta per period ) to assess 
the efficacy and safety of duloxetine 30/60 mg QDin this adolescent population.  Approximately 210 
patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the duloxetine and placebo treatment groups. This study will
assess the difference of the mean change in BPI average pain severity from baseline to the last time point
(Visit 8, Week 13) in Study Period II between treatment groups. Assuming that there will be some 
missing post -baseline data, this sa mple size will provide at least 80% power to detect the treatment 
difference with α=.05. All the parameters used in the sample size calculations were based on the mixed 
model repeated measures (MMRM )analy sis of data from 3- month, placebo -controlled, acut e treatment 
period in 2adult FM studies: Study F1J -MC -HMCA and Study F1J -MC -HMCJ.
All analyses will be conducted on an intent -to-treat basis.  Treatment and interaction effects will be 
evaluated based on a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05.  No adjustme nts for multiple comparisons will be 
made.  Unless otherwise specified, when a total score is calculated from individual items, it will be 
considered missing if any of the individual items are missing.  When an average score is computed from 
individual ite ms, it is calculated from nonmissing values.
A restricted maximum likelihood-based, MMRM analysis will be used to analy ze the primary  efficacy 
variable (change from baseline in BPI average pain rating).   An analy sis of covariance (ANCOVA) model 
with terms for treatment, investigator, and continuous covariate of baseline BPI average pain severity will 
also be used to test treatment difference for the primary efficacy variable (using last -observation -carried -
forward [LOCF] approach and baseline -observation -carried -forward [B OCF] approach ).  The significance 
of treatment -by-investigator interaction will be evaluated in a separate model when it is necessary.  Type 
III sum of squares from least -squares means wil l be used for statistical comparison using analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) or ANCOVA models when no interaction terms are involved.  Type II sum of squares 
will be used for the LSMeans when an interaction term is included.  
ANCOVA and MMRM models similar to those described above will be used to analyze change from 
baseline for continuous secondary efficacy meas ures.  Treatment differences for categorical efficacy 
variables will be evaluated using Fisher’s exact test.
Analy ses of categorical safety variables (adverse events, treatment -emergent changes in vital signs, and 
labs) will be conducted using Fisher’s exact test.  Continuous safety data will be analyzed using ANOVA
or ANCOVA model.
In the d ouble -blind treatment period , duloxetine will be compared with placebo using statistical inference. 
In the o pen-label extensio n per iod, descriptive statistics will be used to summarize data for patien ts who 
entered the open-
label p eriod .

Adolescents with Juvenile Primary  Fibromy algia Sy ndrome
5.Introduction
Fibro myalgia (FM) is a co mmo n condit ion in adult s that is often challenging to treat.  It is 
defined by the American College of Rheumatology  (ACR) as wi despread pain, with a duration of 
at least 3 m onths, in combinat ion with tenderness at 11 or more of 18 speci fic sites on the body  
(Wolfe et al. 1990).  
Fibro myalgia can also be observed in ado lescents.  Some authors have published specific 
diagnosti c criteria f or Juvenile Primary  Fibromyalgi a Syndro me (JPFS) that are derived fro m the 
ACR cri teria but requi re fewer tender point sites (at least 4 out of the 18).  These criteria also 
include other features such as chronic anxiet y, fatigue, and sleep troubles (Yunus and Masi 
1985).  
Current ly, there is very litt le published research on JPFS, but available scie ntific literature 
suggests that JPFS often leads to substantial morbidit y and disabilit y.  For example, adolescents 
with JPFS report si gnificant ly greater funct ional disabilit y and a greater number of school 
absences than those with other rheumat ic disease s, such as juvenile rheumatoid arthrit is (RA) or 
lupus (Varni et al. 2002).  The presence of high levels of pain and disabilit y at this cri tical 
developmental stage places adolescents with JPFS at a greater risk for long -term social and 
occupational diffic ulties.  
Small, uncontrolled studi es from Israel , Mexico, and Italy have est imated that the prevalence rate 
of JPFS in school  children ranges from 1.24% to 6.20%, with girls making up the majorit y of 
cases, but those data are only indicative and need to b e confirmed by larger adequate studies 
(Buskila et al. 1993 ;Clark et al . 1998 ;Sardini et al. 1996).  Informat ion from a nat ional registry  
in the United States indicates that JPFS accounts for about 7.7% of new patient diagnoses in 
pediatric rheumatol ogy settings (Si egel et al . 1998).  However, the prevalence of JPFS in 
children and ado lescents in the general population of the United States is still not available.  The 
mean age of onset of JPFS is 12 y ears.  To date, there is no published clinical trial th at studi ed 
drug efficacy in this populat ion, nor i s there a drug approved or marketed for FM in this 
popul ation. 
As in adults, children and ado lescents wi th FM commo nly report depressive symptom s, and 
depressio n and anxiet y disorders are commo n comorbid d isorders (Gedalia et al. 2000, 
Mikkelsson 1999).  The duloxet ine studies in adults with FM allowed major depressive disorder 
(MDD) com orbidity because of i ts high prevalence (26% to 31% of adult FM patients suffer also 
from MDD [Russell et al. 2008]).  In adolescents, em pirical  experi ence suggests the high 
prevalence o f the MDD and the anxiet y disorders com orbidity.  Dul oxetine has demo nstrated 
efficacy  in FM, MDD, and general anxiet y disorder (GAD) in adults.  No study  has been 
conducted with duloxet ine inchildren or adol escents wi th GAD.  There i s 1 com pleted open -
label dulo xetine study  in children and adolescents with MDD, and it suggests clinical benefit of 
F1J-MC-HMGW Clinical Protocol Page 16
LY248686duloxetine in those patients (March et al. 2009).  The current duloxet ine study  will enroll patie nts 
with JPFS, including those with comorbid primary diagnoses of MDD and/or GAD.
At the time of approval o f duloxetine for the m anagem ent of  FM, the US Food and Drug 
Administrati on (FDA), under the Pediatric Research Equit y Act (PREA), required Lilly to 
conduct a deferred FM study to assess safety  and effectiveness of duloxet ine in pediatric pat ients 
with FM aged 13 to 17 years.  Based on the above considerations, Lilly  has designed this 
rando mized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study to assess the effi cacy, safety , and tol erabili ty 
of duloxetine in this populat ion.  Safet y/tolerabilit y will be assessed based on clinical judgment 
and co mpar ison to the known safet y profile of duloxetine that has been observed in adult patients 
with FM and ado lescents wi thother condit ions such as MDD.  
More detailed informat ion about the known benefits and risks of duloxetine may be found in the 
Invest igator’s Brochure (IB).

7.1. Summary of Study Design
Study  F1J-MC-HMGW (HMGW) is a Phase 3b, multicenter, randomized clinical trial of 
duloxetine versus placebo for the treatment of JPFS in ado lescents. The study  design include s
4study  periods.  Foll owing Study  Period I (screening phase), eligible patients enter Study  Period 
II, the acute 13-week parallel, rando mized, double -blind, pl acebo -controlled treatment period of 
duloxetine 30/60 mg QD.  Upon completion o f the 13-week dou ble- blind period, patients enter 
Study  Period III, a 26 -week, open -label extensio n  phase of duloxetine 30/60 mg QD.  A 1- week 
drug taper period (Study  Period IV) is requi red for all  patients who di scontinue for any  reason 
between Visit 4 to Vi sit 8 during Study  Period II, or who complete/discont inue Study  Period III 
on duloxetine 60 mg QD. .
Figure HMGW. 1illustrates the study  design.
Abbreviations:   DB = double -blind; DLX = duloxetine; OL = open -label; QD = once -daily
aAfter Visit 3, patients increased to 60 mg duloxetine can have their dose decreased 1 time, at a scheduled or 
unscheduled Visit. Once 60 mg dose is decreased to 30 mg, it cannot be i ncreased again during Study Period II. 
bAt Visits 4 through 8, patients randomized to placebo or DLX 30 mg who  discontinue prior to entering the 
open -label extension treatment p eriod(Study Period III) will receive placebo in the drug taper p eriod.
cAt Visits 9 through 14 in Study Period III, dose increases are permitted at scheduled visits (to a maximum dose 
of 60 mg QD) and dose decreases are permitted at scheduled or unscheduled visits (to a minimum dose of 
30mg QD). 
dPatients who complete/discon tinue Study P eriod III on DLX 30 mg do not need to enter the drug taper period .

LY2486867.1.1. Study Period I –Screening Phase 
Study  Period I (Vi sit 1 to Vi sit 2) is a screening phase in which patients will be screened for 
study  entry  eligibilit y.
At or before Visit 1, the study  and i ts potenti al risks will  be explained to patients and 
parents/legal representatives.  The parent/legal representative will then sign and dat e the 
inform ed consent form  (ICF), and the patient will sign and date the assent document .  The ICF 
must be signed before any  study  procedures are conducted and before patients discont inue any 
excluded medicat ions.  Patients will then be assigned a patient number and undergo screening.  
Visit 1 procedures ty pically  require m ore than 1 day  to com plete.  At Visit 1, patients will be 
evaluated by the investigator to determine if they meet the diagnost ic criteria for JPFS, based 
upon Yunus and Masi’s criteria.   Pati ents will undergo a phy sical examinat ion and m ultiple 
screening procedures that need to be assessed prior to init iating a “washout period” for any  
excluded medicat ions.  This information will be evaluated to ensure consistency wit h study  
inclusio n and exclusio n criteria. See Attachm ent 1 for a com plete list of Visit 1 procedures.
If a study  patient is taking m edicat ion(s) at Visit 1 that are excluded by this protocol, the patient 
must com plete a washout period for the excluded medicat ions.  The length of the washout period 
must allow adequate  time for the medicat ion(s) to be elimi nated f rom the patient's body  
(generally  about 5 half -lives), and may range fro m 2 to 28 day s.  The m edicat ion washout period 
must be completed before performing 3 specific Visit 1 procedures: 1) blood chemistries, 2) 
electrocardi ogram  (ECG), and 3) urine drug screen (UDS).  The overall period of time to 
complete all  Visit 1 procedures, including medicat ion washout, should not exceed 30 days.  The 
day on which the l ast Visi t 1 procedure i s completed (for example, scheduled laboratory  tests and 
ECG) will be considered the date of Visit 1.  All criteria for enrollment, including the results of 
ECG, safet y, and l aboratory  analyses, m ust be reviewed by  the principal  invest igator (PI) prior to 
enrollment at Visit 2.  Patients who do not meet entry  criteria (inclu sion and excl usion criteria) at 
Visit 2 will  not be enrolled into the study .  Visit 2 shoul d be scheduled 5 to 9 days after 
completion of Visit 1 procedures.
7.1.2. Study Period II –Double -Blind Treatment Phase
Study  Period II (Vi sit 2 to Visi t 8) i s a 13 -week, rando mized, double -blind treatment phase.  
During Study  Period II, pati ents will init ially have visit s weekly (Visits 3 and 4), then biweekly 
(Visit 5), and then every  3 weeks (Visits 6 to 8).  
At Visit 2, patients who met entry  criteria in Study Peri od I will be rando mized in a 1:1 ratio to 
duloxetine or placebo by a co mputer -generated random sequence using an interactive vo ice 
response system (IVRS).  All pat ients will receive investigat ional product beginning at Visit 2 
and will be instructed to start t aking their invest igational product the morning after Visit 2.  
Patients randomly assigned to placebo will remain on placebo throughout Study  Period II.
F1J-MC-HMGW Clinical Protocol Page 21
LY248686Patients randomly assigned to the duloxetine treatment group will remain on dulo xetine 
throughout Stud y Period II.  Dul oxetine patients will init ially take a 30 m g QD dose of 
duloxetine for 1 week.  Starting at Visit 3 through Visit 6, the dose can be increased  fro m 30 m g 
QD to 60 m g QD.  By  Visi t 4, com orbid MDD and/or GAD patients receiving a 30- mg QD d ose 
shoul d be increased to a 60 -mg QD dose, unless the patient is experiencing significant 
intolerance to the 30 -mg dose.  Beginning at Visit 7, no dose increases can be made.
Dose -escalat ion criteria for all  patients is based on investigator’s clinical ju dgment of the 
following:  
1)Patient has inadequate treatment response to the 30 -mg dose
2)Patient has adequate tol erabilit y to 30 -mg dose.  
3)For pati ents di agnosed wi th com orbid MDD and/or GAD at baseline, the 30 -mg dose 
shoul d be increased to 60 m g, unless t he pat ient is experiencing significant 
intolerance to the 30 -mg dose.
Dose adjust ments are to be performed through dispensing the appropriate invest igational product 
packaging at the site.  Dose increases can only  occur at scheduled study  visits.  The m aximum 
dose l evel permitted for this study  is 60 mg QD.  If necessary  due to intol erabili ty, for those 
patients on a 60 -mg QD dose, a one -time dose decrease to 30 mg may occur at a scheduled or 
unscheduled visit.  In order to determine whether a dose decrease is needed, the patient must 
return to the study  site for assessment.  If a determinat ion is made at the si te to decrease the 
patient’s dose, then a new invest igational product package will be dispensed using the IVRS.  
Once the 60- mg dose is decreased to 30 m g, it cannot be increased again during Study  Period II. 
At the unscheduled visits, procedures are to be performed as indicated in the Study  Schedule 
(Attachm ent 1 ).  All dosing modificat ions in this Study  Period are implemented in a blinded 
manner using IVRS.
If the patient has already had their 1 dose decrease, and at a subsequent time cannot tolerate the 
investigat ional product dose well enoug h to rem ain com pliant, the patient should be 
discontinued. 
It is unknown if dulo xetine i s efficaci ous in treating MDD or GAD in this adolescent populat ion.  
The invest igator is responsible for assessing the patient’s mental status at each visit.  The CGI -
Severit y of Mental  Illness will be administered at every  visit during Study  Period II.
See Attachm ent 1 for the timing of events and the measures to be assessed.
7.1.3. Study Period III –Open -Label Extension Treatment Phase
Study  Period III i s a 26 -week, open -label extensio n treatment phase.  Patient s init ially have visits 
weekly (Visits 8 to 9), then biweekly (Visits 9 to 10), then every 3 to 6 weeks (Visits 10 to 15).   
Patients randomized to either the duloxetine or placebo treatment groups during Study  Period II 
will enter Study  Period III on a 3 0-mg dose of duloxetine for 1 week.  The duloxet ine dose may 
be increased to 60 mg QD only at a scheduled Visit starting at Visit 9 (Week 14).  As in Study  
Period II, addit ional dose -escalat ion considerat ion should be given to all pat ients with com orbid 
F1J-MC-HMGW Clinical Protocol Page 22
LY248686MDD and/or GAD at study  entry .  At Visi t 9, the com orbid MDD and/or GAD patients should 
have their 30 -mg dose increased to 60 mg, unless the pat ient is experiencing significant 
intolerance to the 30 -mg dose.  
From  Visi t 9 to Visi t 14, dose m odificat ions are allowed, and patients must return to the study  
site for assessment of all dose changes.  Dose increases (up to 60 mg QD) are only  permi tted at 
scheduled visits.  Dose decreases (down to 30 mg QD) are permitted at either scheduled or 
unscheduled visits.  D ose adjust ments are to be based on the invest igator’s clinical judgment of 
treatm ent response and tolerabilit y at the patient’s current dose.  Procedures will be performed as 
indicated in the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).
7.1.4. Study Period IV –Taper/Discontinuation Phase
Study  Period IV is a 1 -week taper phase to minimize the occurrence of discont inuat ion-emergent 
adverse events (AEs).   Patients who com plete Study Period III or discontinue after Visit 9 of 
Study  Period III while on duloxetine 60 mg QD, will receive dul oxetine 30 mg QD for 1 week.  
The 1 -week taper is not required for patients in Study  Period III who com plete or discont inue 
early  on a 30 -
mg QD dose of duloxetine .
Patients who discont inue between Visits 4 to 8 of Study Period II should enter into the 1 -week 
drug taper period .  Ho wever, tapering of IP should be based on the investigator’s determination 
of safet y for his or her pati ent.  Patients on dul oxetine 60 m g QD will receive 30 mg QD for 
1week.  Patients on duloxet ine 30 mg QD will receive placebo for 1 week.  Patients on placebo 
will receive placebo for 1 week.  The 1 -week taper is implemented in a blinded manner using the 
IVRS.  The taper period is not required for patients who discontinue at Visit 3 and therefore have 
not received 2 weeks of treatment.
See Attachm ent 1 for the timing of events and the measures to be assessed.
7.2. Discussion of Design and Control
The study  is desi gned based on the current knowledge of duloxet inesafet y and efficacy  in FM 
and relevant clinical pract ice. 
The screening periodis intended for di agnosing and assessing the patient for possible inclusio n 
in the study  and f or provi ding an adequate washout period for excluded medications, which is 
consis tent wi th periods typical  of clinical pract ice.
Doubl e-blind, placebo -controlled studies are the standard used to assess efficacy in rando mized 
clinical studies.  The 13 -week treatm ent peri od allows a sufficient amount of time to demonstrate 
efficacy  of treatment, while keeping pat ients on placebo for as short a time as possible.
The 26- week, open -label period will allow for patients init ially randomized to pl acebo during 
Study  Period II to have the opportunit y to receive benefit from treatment.
A 1-week ta pering period will allow adequate time to gradually decrease the dose and minimize 
discontinuat ion symptom s.

Exclusio n Cri terion [11] eliminates drugs that cannot be mapped to a standard drug dict ionary, or 
for which litt le data are known to analyze the potent ial relationship o f AEs or drug interactions.  
Exclusio n Cri teria [16] and [17] are intended to avoid other confounding pain condit ions or 
rheumatol ogic diagnoses and exclude patients with rheumatologic dis orders.  
Exclusio n Cri teria [18], [20], [21], and [24] are intended to avoid confounding psychiatric 
diagnoses and exclude patients with serious mental diseases.  
F1J-MC-HMGW Clinical Protocol Page 27
LY248686Exclusio n Cri terion [15] is intended to avoid enrolling patients with a history  of JPFS who have 
been nonresponsive to drug treatment or are unable to tolerate drug treatment.  
Exclusio n Cri terion [27] is intended to avoid other therapy  that can confound the evaluat ion of 
treatm ent response.  
Exclusio n Cri teria [30] and [31] are intended to pr event the development of serotonin syndro me.  
Exclusio n Cri teria [12], [14] and [15] reduce potential bias in pat ients who have been exposed to 
duloxetine. 
Exclusio n Cri teria [22] and [23] are intended to exclude pat ient that are likely to use central 
nervous system -active drugs that might confound efficacy  and safet y assessments.  Exclusio n 
Criteria [19] and [29] eliminates patients likely to use central nervous system (CNS) -active drugs 
that might adversely affect the safet y assessments of duloxet ine or place pat ients at an increased 
risk of AEs due to drug -drug interactions.  
Exclusio n Cri teria [13], [25], [26], [28], [33], [34], and [37] are intended to avoid any potential 
safet y issues.  Exclusio n Cri terion [35] excl udes pati ents who have significant medical 
condi tions or di seases that are unrelated to therapy but may  need to be treated duri ng the course 
of the study  by an excluded medicat ion or procedure.  
Exclusio n Cri terion [32] is intended to exclude patients with thy roid disease, which may 
confo und symptom atology.  
Exclusio n Cri terion [36] is intended to prevent patients enro lling in the study who present with 
potenti ally confounding symptom s resul ting from hormone imbalance.
8.3. Discontinuations
8.3.1. Discontinuation of Patients
The cri teria for enrollment must be fo llowed explici tly.  If a pati ent who does not meet 
enrollment criteria is inadvertent ly enro lled, that patient is discont inued fro m the study , and Lilly  
or its desi gnee m ust be contacted.
In addit ion, pati ents will  be discont inued fro mthe investigat ional product and/or from the study  
in the fo llowing circumstances.
Enrollment in any other clinical trial invo lving an investigational product or enrollment in 
any other ty pe of medical research judged not to be scient ifically or medically compat ible 
with this study
The invest igator decides that the patient should be withdrawn.  If this decisio n is 
made because of a serious adverse event or a clinically significant laboratory 
value, the invest igational product is to be discont inued and app ropri ate measures 
are to be taken.  Lilly  or its desi gnee is to be al erted immediately.  Refer to 
Secti on 10.2 Safet y Evaluat ions.
F1J-MC-HMGW Clinical Protocol Page 28
LY248686The patient, pa tient’s parent/l egal representative, or attending physician requests 
that the patient be withdrawn fro m the study .
The patient for any  reason, requi res treatm ent wi th another therapeutic agent that 
has been demonstrated to be effect ive for treatm ent of t he study indicat ion.  In 
this case, di scont inuat ion from the study  occurs prior to i ntroducti on of  the new 
agent.
The invest igator or Lilly stops the study or stops the patient’s participat ion in the 
study  for medical, safet y, regul atory , or other reason s consistent with applicable 
laws, regulations, and good clinical practice .
If the patient becomes pregnant.
If the patient’s body  weight decreases to <20 kg.
In addit ion, pati ents m ay be discont inued in the fo llowing ci rcumstances:
If an exclusio n criterion devel ops af ter invest igational product init iation, Lilly or 
its designee will be contacted to determine the appropriate evaluat ion and fo llow-
up, whi ch may  include discont inuat ion of the patient.
If the patient is unable to tolera te the invest igational product as j udged by the 
investigator, the invest igators should use clinical judgment on whether to continue 
or decrease invest igational product dose, or discontinue the patient’s participation 
in the study .
If the patient is signifi cantly nonco mpliant wi th investigational product or study  
procedures, they  shoul d be discont inued fro m the study .
The patient, for any  reason, requi res treatm ent wi th another therapeuti c excluded 
of concomitant use with duloxet ine for the tri al.  In this c ase, Lilly or i ts desi gnee
shoul d be contacted and the patient may be discontinued.
Patients who discont inue the invest igational product and/or study  early  will have end -of-therapy  
and/or end- of-study  procedures performed as shown in the Study  Schedule ( Attachm ent 1 ).
8.3.2. Discontinuation of Study Sites
Study  site parti cipat ion may be discont inued if Lilly, t he invest igator, or the ethical review board 
(ERB) of the study  sitejudges it necessary for medical, safet y, regul atory , or other reasons 
consistent with applicable laws, regulat ions, and GCP.
8.3.3. Discontinuation of the Study
The study  will be di scontinued if Lilly judges it necessary for medical, safet y, regul atory , or 
other reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulat ions, and GCP.
F1J-MC-HMGW Clinical Protocol Page 29
LY2486869.Treatment 
9.1. Treatments Administered
During Study  Period II (Doubl e-Blind Treatm ent Period), patients will be rando mly assigned to 
duloxetineor placebo to be taken once daily (QD), preferably  in the m orning.  Pati ents assigned 
to dul oxetine will begin at 30 mg QD for 1 week.  Starting at Visit 3, through Visit 6, the dose 
may be increased to 60 mg QD.  Dose escalat ion shoul d follow GCP.  Dose increases can only 
occur at scheduled study  visits (Vi sits 3, 4, 5, or 6).  Addit ional dose -escalat ion considerat ion 
shoul d be given to all pat ients with com orbid MDD/GAD at study  entry .  At Vi sit 4, pati ents 
with com orbid MDD/GAD on a 30- mg QD dose should have thei r dose increased to 60 mg QD, 
unless the patient is experiencing significant intolerance to the 30 -mg dose.  If necessary, due to 
intolerabilit y, a one -time dose decrease (down to 30 mg QD) may occur at scheduled or 
unscheduled visits.  To determ ine whether a dose decrease is needed, the patient must return to 
the study  site for assessment.  If a determinat ion is made at the site to decrease the patient’s dose, 
a new invest igational product package will be dispensed using the IVRS.  A dose decreas e can 
occur any time throughout the course of Study  Period II (to a minimum dose of 30 mg QD).  
Once a pat ient’s dose has been decreased, it cannot be increased again in Study  Period II.
During Study  Period III (Open -Label Extensio n Treatment Period), pati ents who were 
rando mized to either the duloxet ine or placebo treatment groups during Study Period II will 
receive a 30 -mg QD dose of duloxetine for 1 week.  The duloxet ine dose may be increased to 
60mg QD only at scheduled Visit s starting at Visit 9  As in Study  Period II, addit ional dose -
escalat ion considerat ion shoul d be given to all pat ients with comorbid MDD/GAD at study  entry .  
At Visit 9, patients with co morbid MDD/GAD shoul d have thei r 30-mg dose increased to 60 mg, 
unless the patient is experiencing significant intol erance to the 30 -mg dose.  From Visit 9 to Visit 
14, dose modificat ions are allowed, and pat ients must return to the study  site for assessment of 
all dose changes.  Dose increases (up to 60 mg QD) are only  permi tted at scheduled visit s.  Dose 
decreases (down to 30 mg QD) are permitted at either scheduled or unscheduled visit s.  Dose 
increases or decreases are to be based on the investigator’s clinical judgment of treatment 
response and tolerabilit y at the pati ent’s current dose.  Patients unable to tolerate a 30 -mg dose 
shoul d be discont inued fro m this study .  Pati ents discontinuing the study  between Visits 9 to 15 
on duloxetine 30 mg QD do not need to enter the drug taper period .
The invest igator or his/her designee is responsible for expl aining the correct use of the 
investigat ional product(s) to the patient and patient’s parent/legal representative, verifying that 
instructi ons are fo llowed properly , maintaining accurate records of investigational product 
dispensing and collect ion, and ret urning all unused medicat ion to Lilly or its designee at the end 
of the study .
Patients and patient’s parent/legal representative will be instructed to contact the invest igator as 
soon as possible if he or she has a complaint or problem with the invest igational product, so that 
the situation can be assessed.
F1J-MC-HMGW Clinical Protocol Page 30
LY2486869.2. Materials and Supplies
Lilly will provide the fo llowing invest igational products:
30-mg capsules o f duloxetine hydrochloride
placebo capsules ident ical in appearance to duloxetine capsules
Invest igational product will be dispensed to patients at the study  site.  Investi gational product 
will be labeled wit h a unique ident ifier for drug accountabilit y.  Investi gational product 
packaging will contain a sufficient quant ity of investigat ional product to last to the next visit and 
additional capsules to all ow for sufficient invest igational product in case of a longer visit 
window.
9.3. Method of Assignment to Treatment
After the informed consent form (ICF) is signed and dated, a patient is considered to be 
“entered” into the study  and will be assigned a pat ient number.  Patients who meet all criteria for 
enrollment will be rando mized to double -
blind treatment at Visit 2.  Assignment to treatment 
groups will be determined by a computer -generated random sequence using an IVRS.  The IVRS 
will be used to assign invest igational product packages containing double -blind invest igational 
product to each patient during Study  Period II, and open -label invest igational product during 
Study  Period III.  Si te personnel will confirm that they have located the correct invest igational 
product packages by entering a confirmat ion number found on the invest igational product 
packages into the IVRS.
To achieve between -group com parabilit y for site factor, the randomizat ion will be stratified by 
site.
9.4. Rationale for Selection of Doses in the Study
The two doses of duloxetine, 30 mg and 60 mg QD, administered orally, were selected based on 
the recommended adult dose and current clinical and pharmacokinetic data.  For adults, t he 
recommended dose of duloxetine is 60 mg administered QD, with treatment init iating at a 30 -mg 
QD dose for 1 week. Some adults respond to the 30- mg starting dose. 
Study  F1J-MC-HMFN (HMFN) is an open -label study  of duloxetine safet y and 
pharmacokinet ics in children and ado lescents with MDD.  The pharmacokinetic result s from 
Study  HMFN suggest that different ial dosing based on age or body  weight i s not warranted.  The 
range of dulo xetine concentrations in children (7 through 11 y ears) and ado lescents (12 through 
17 years) are similar to those observed in adults, wit h median values being lower in pediatric 
patients than in adults.  Therefore, different ial dosing in the pediatric populat ion compared wit h 
the adul t popul ation may not be warranted.
9.5. Selection and Timing of Doses
AtVisit 2, patients will be instructed to take the investigational product starting the day after 
Visit 2.  The invest igational product should be taken QD, preferably in the morning.  Patients 
will take a 30 -mg dose QD fro m the day  after Vi sit 2 to Visi t 3;and ei ther a 30 -mg or a 60- mg 
F1J-MC-HMGW Clinical Protocol Page 31
LY248686dose QD from Visit 3 to Visit 8 during Study  Period II.  Dose changes will occur as described in 
Secti on7.1.
Starti ng at Visit 8, patients complet ing Study Period II will be allowed to enter the open -label 
extensio n treatment period (Study  Period  III) and will begin receiving duloxet ine 30 mg QD f or 
1 week, preferably in the morning.  The duloxet ine dose may be increased to 60 mg QD starting 
at Vi sit 9.  From  Visi t 9 to Visi t 14, dose increases are permitted at scheduled visit s (to a 
maximum dose of 60 mg QD) and dose decreases are permitted at sch eduled or unscheduled 
visits (to a minimum dose of 30 mg QD).  Dose adjust ments are to be based on the investigator’s 
clinical judgment of treatment response and tolerabilit y at the pati ent’s current dose. 
9.6. Continued Access to Investigational Product
Invest igational product will not be provided after the conclusio n of the study  as it is 
commercially  available in the countries where this study  will be conducted.
9.7. Blinding
This is a double -blind study .
To preserve the blinding of the study , a minimum numb er of Lilly  personnel  will see the 
rando mizat ion table and treatment assignments before the study  is complete.
Emergency  unblinding for adverse events may be performed through an IVRS, which may 
supplement or take the place of emergency codes generated by  a com puter drug -labeling system.  
This option may  be used ONLY if the pat ient’s well -being requires knowledge of the pati ent’s 
treatm ent assi gnment.  All  calls result ing in an unblinding event are recorded and reported by  the 
IVRS.
The invest igator should make every  effort to contact the Lilly clinical research physician (CRP) 
prior to unblinding a patient’s treatment assignment.  If a patient’s treatment assignment is 
unblinded, Lilly must be notified immediately by telephone.
If an invest igator, site pers onnel performing assessments, or patient is unblinded, the patient 
must be discont inued fro m the study .  In cases where there are ethical reasons to have the patient 
remain in the study , the investigator must obtain specific approval fro m a Lilly CRP for t he 
patient to continue in the study .
9.8. Concomitant Therapy
In general, concomitant medicat ions wit h primarily CNS activit y are not allowed in this study .  
Ongo ing use of nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs) i s allowed during the study , in 
accordance with the gui delines specified on the HMGW List of Concomitant Medicat ions that is 
provi ded wi th this protocol .  Site personnel shoul d call a designated representative with any 
questions regarding medicat ions not specifically cited in the list of excluded medications.  
Patient’s parent/l egal representative must sign the ICF before patients stop any  excluded 
medicat ions.  Any changes in the list of allowed/not allowed medicat ions will be communicated 
to invest igators and will not constitute a protocol amendm ent.
F1J-MC-HMGW Clinical Protocol Page 32
LY248686All nonstudy  medicati ons taken during the study  will be recorded on the case report form (CRF), 
including the administration date and dosage.  Patients will be instructed to consult with the 
investigator or study  coordinator at the site before taking any new prescribed medicat ions, over -
the-counter (OTC) medicat ions, or supplements/herbal preparat ions.  
For a detailed list of specifically excluded medicat ions, see the HMGW List of Conco mitant 
Medicat ions that is provided to the sites with the protocol and is updated as necessary  by Lilly.  
If any changes to the list are made after the protocol has been approved by Lilly, an ERB, or a 
regul atory  agency, these changes will not be considered modificat ions to the protocol, but the 
HMGW List of Concomitant Medi cations will be updated to provide this informat ion.
Patients who are taking any  disall owed m edicat ions at the time of screening will need to undergo 
a washout period prior to complet ing Visit 1.  Ongoing use of NSAIDs is allowed during the 
study , in accordance wit h the gui delines specified on the HMGW List of Concomitant 
Medicat ions that is provided with this protocol.  After Visit 2, episodic use of so me analgesics is 
allowed for break- through pain, acute injury , or surgery .  Episodi c use is defined as no m ore than 
3consecutive days andno more than 20 cum ulative day s during Study  Period II (Visit 2 to Visit 
8), and 3 consecut ive days andno more than 40 cumulat ive days during Study Period III.  
Analgesics, including acetaminophen and herbal remedies /medicines, are not provided by the 
sponsor.
9.9. Treatment Compliance
Each patient and parent/legal representative should be instructed to return all invest igational 
product packaging and material to the study  site at each visit.  The study  site will keep a re cord 
of all drug di spensed and returned throughout the study .  The study  site will return all  
investigat ional product packaging and unused investigat ional product for all pat ients, following 
completion of drug accountabilit y procedures by Lilly  or desi gnee .  Pati ent com pliance wi th 
investigat ional product will be assessed at each visit after Visit 2.  Compliance will be assessed 
by direct questioning and counting returned capsules.  Compliance with the prescribed regimen 
will be recorded in the CRF.
During Study  Periods II and III, compliance for each visit interval is defined as taking between 
80% and 120% of the prescribed capsules of investigat ional product.  If a patient is not 
compliant during an interval, the patient and parent/legal representative wil l be counseled 
regarding the importance of compliance in this study .  The pati ent m ay be discont inued at this 
time if, in the opinio n of the invest igator, the patient is deemed unlikely to become co mpliant 
and data obtained from the patient will be unrelia ble.  The second time that a patient is 
nonco mpliant with his or her dosage schedule; he or she must be discont inued fro m the study  
unless nonco mpliance results fro m unforeseen circumstances (for example, a blizzard or illness).  
In such instances, the Lilly CRP or designee who is responsible for monitoring the study  may 
grant permissio n for the pati ent to con tinue.
In addit ion, pati ents who are consistent ly noncom pliant wi th having thei r laboratory  tests done or 
their procedures com pleted as indicated in t he Study Schedule ( Attachm ent 1 ), or who do not 
F1J-MC-HMGW Clinical Protocol Page 33

LY24868610.Efficacy , Health Outcome/Quality  of Life Measures, and 
Safety  Evaluations, and A ppropriateness of 
Measurements
Study  procedures and their timing (including tolerance limits for timing) are summarized in the 
Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).
10.1. Efficacy Measures
10.1.1. Primary Efficacy Measure
The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) –Modified Short Form: Adolescent Version.   The primary 
efficacy  measure for this study  is the BPI “24- hour average pain seve rity” item (Questi on 3) of 
the BPI (Cl eeland and Ryan 1994), while the other 3 BPI pain severit y items and the interference 
items will  be considered secondary  efficacy  measures (see Secti on 10.1.2 below).  The BPI is a 
self-reported scal e that m easures the severit yof pain and the interference of pain on funct ion.  
For the BPI 24 -hour average pain item, the ratings range fro m 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain a s severe as 
you can imagine).  The BPI average pain severit y item was selected as the primary outcome 
measure based on past experience wit h this measure in adult duloxetine FM clinical trials.
10.1.2. Secondary Efficacy Measures
The fo llowing secondary  efficacy me asures will be collected at the times shown in the Study  
Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).
The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) -Modified Short Form: Adolescent Version 
(Severit y and Interference ) is a self -reported scal e that m easures the severit y of 
pain and the interference o f pain on funct ion (Cleeland and Ryan 1994) .  The 
Severit y scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as y ou can imagine).  
There are 4 questions assessing the severit y for worst pain, least pain, average 
pain in the past 24 hours (which is the primary  efficacy  measure), and the pain 
right no w.  The Interference scores range fro m 0 (does not interfere) to 10 
(com pletely  interferes).  There are 7 original quest ions assessing the interference 
of pain in the past 24 hours on the fo llowing:  general  activit y, mood, wal king 
abilit y, normal work, re lations wi th other peopl e, sleep, and enjo yment of life. 
The BPI: Adolescent Version added an eighth interference quest ion to assess 
interference of pain on school work.  This scale has  not been formally  validated 
in adolescents.
The Pediatric Pain Questionnaire (PPQ) is a self -reported scal e that m easures 
the severit y for “pain now,” worst pain, and average pain in the past week with 
100mm VAS (Visual Analog Scale) (Varni et al. 1987).  The severit y scores 
range fro m 0 (no hurting, no disco mfort, no pain ) to 100 (hurting a who le lot, very  
unco mfortable, severe pain).  The PPQ has been formally validated in 
adolescents.
F1J-MC-HMGW Clinical Protocol Page 35
LY248686The Clinical Global Impression of Severity: Overall (CGI -Severity: Overall) scale 
evaluates the severit y of overall  illness at the time of assessment (Guy  1976).  The score 
ranges fro m 1 (normal , not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill pat ients).  The 
CGI-Severit y:  Overall must be administered by  a study  physician in the presence of the 
patient or after having been in the presenc e of the pati ent.  
The Clinical Global Impression of Severity:  Mental Illness (CGI -Severity:  
Mental) scale evaluates the severit y of mental  illness at the time of assessment 
(Guy  1976).  The score ranges fro m 1 (norm al, not at all ill) to 7 (am ong the m ost 
extrem ely ill patients).  The CGI -Severit y:  Mental must be administered by  a 
study  physician in the presence of the patient or after having been in the presence 
of the pati ent
Functional Disability Inventory- child form (FDI -child) is a self -reported s cale to 
assess the physical trouble or difficult y the child has doing regular act ivities (Walker and 
Greene 1991).  This scale contains 15 items.  Each item is scored on a 0 -to-4-point scale 
(0 = no trouble, 1 = a little trouble, 2 = some trouble, 3 = a l ot of troubl e, 4 = impossible).  
The total score ranges fro m 0to60.  The higher the score, the more physical trouble or 
difficult y the child has do ing regular activit ies.
Functional Disability Inventory- parent form (FDI -parent) contains the same items as
FDI-child, but is reported by  parent/l egal representative (Walker and Greene 1991).  The 
total score range fro m 0 to 60.  The higher the score, the more phy sical trouble or 
difficult y the child has do ing regular activit ies.
Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) is modeled after the Beck Depression 
Inventory  and is a 27 -item self-reported, symptom -oriented scal e designed for school -
aged children and ado lescents (Kovacs 1985).  Each item is scored on a 0 -to-2-point scale 
(in increasing severit y) and thus the total score ranges from  0 to 54.  The hi gher the score, 
the more severe the depression.
Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) is a self -
reported scale 
developed to assess anxiet y in children and adolescents (March et al. 1997).  The MASC 
consists of 39 items that comprise 4 factors, 3 of which can be separated into 2 subfactors 
each.  Main factors (subfactors) include:  1) phy sical symptom s (tense/rest less and 
somati c/autonomic); 2) social anxiet y (humiliation/reject ion and public performance 
fears); 3) harm avo idance (perfect ionism and anxious coping); and 4) separation anxiet y.  
Each i tem is scored on a 0 -to-3-point scale.  Total score range fro m 0 to 117.  The higher 
the total score, the more severe the anxiet y.
10.2. Safety Evaluations
Invest igators are responsible for monitoring the safety  of patients who have entered this study  
and for al erting Lilly  or its designee to any  event that seems unusual, even if this event may be 
considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient.
The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of pat ients during the study
.
The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate health care option, 
AEs that are serious or that caused the patient to discontinue before complet ing the s tudy.  The 
F1J-MC-HMGW Clinical Protocol Page 36
LY248686patient shoul d be f ollowed unt il the event is reso lved or explained.  Frequency o f follow-up 
evaluat ion is left to the discret ion of the investigator.
Patients wi th clinically relevant abnormal ECGs or laboratory  findings should be fo llowed at t he 
discreti on of  the invest igator until reso lved or explained.  Weight and vital signs will be 
measured at each visit throughout the study , pref erably at the same t ime each visit.  Height will 
be measured by stadio meter three times during the study  as indi cated in the Study  Schedule 
(Attachm ent 1 ).  All measurements will be made wit hout shoes and after the removal o f any 
heavy personal items (such as large jewelry, wallets, or coats).  Preferably, the same observer 
shoul d measure the pati ents throughout the study  using the same instruments.
Instrum ents used for measuring height and weight must be in co mpliance wit h the study  sites’ 
institutional calib ration standards.  Compliance wit h institutional calibrat ion(s) guidelines must 
be appropriately documented.
If a suicide -related event i s ident ified at any t ime during the study, a thorough evaluat ion shoul d 
be perform ed by a study  physician and appropria te medical  care shoul d be provi ded.  In som e 
patients taking antidepressants, worsening of depressio n, suicidal events (suicidal thinking and/or 
behavior), or unusual changes in behavior have been reported, especially at the beginning of the 
drug therapy , at the time of dose changes, or early after treatment discont inuat ion.  It is important 
that parent/legal representatives and pat ients are instructed to notify their doctor immediately if 
the pati ent has any distressing thoughts or feelings at any  time.
10.2.1. Adverse Events
Lilly has standards for reporting AEs that are to be fo llowed regardl ess of applicable regulatory  
requi rements that m ay be less stringent.
Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study is to 
establish drug effect.
Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposures to invest igational product 
or drug delivery system should be reported.  Data on fetal outcome and breast -feeding are 
collected for regulatory  reporting and drug safet yevaluat ion.
Study  site personnel  will record the occurrence and nature of each patient’s preexist ing 
condi tions, including clinically  significant si gns and symptom s of the disease under treatment in 
the study .
After the informed consent form (ICF) is signed, site personnel will record any  change in the 
condi tion(s) and the occurrence and nature of any AEs.  All AEs related to protocol procedures 
are reported to Lilly or designee.
In addit ion, all AEs occurring after the patient receives the first dose of invest igational product 
must be reported to Lilly or its designee via CRF.
Any clinically  significant findings from ECGs, labs, vital sign measurements, and other 
procedures that result in a diagnosis should be reported to Lilly  or its designee.
F1J-MC-HMGW Clinical Protocol Page 37
LY248686Invest igators will  be instructed to report to Lilly or its designee their assessment of the potential 
relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure and/or investigational product via CRF.
Study  site personnel  must al ert Lilly or i ts desi gnee wi thin 24 hours of the invest igator 
unblinding a patient’s treatment group assignment for any reason.
If a patient’s dosage is reduced or treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study  site 
personnel must clearly  report to Lilly  or its desi gnee via CRF the circumstances and data l eading 
to any  such dosage reduction or discont inuat ion of treatm ent.
10.2.1.1. Serious Adverse Events
Serious adverse event (SAE) collect ion begins after the patient has signed informed consent and 
has received invest igational product.  If a patient experi ences an SAE after signing informed 
consent, but prior to receiving invest igational product, the event will NOT be co llected unless the 
investigator feels the event may  have been caused by  a protocol  procedure.
Previously  planned (pri or to si gning the ICF) surgeri es shoul d not be reported as SAEs unless the 
underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study .
Study  site personnel  must al ert Lilly or i ts desi gnee of  any serious adverse event (SAE) within 
24 hours of invest igator awarenes s of the event via a Sponsor -approved method.  Alerts issued 
via tel ephone are to be immediately  followed wi th official notification on study -specific SAE 
forms.  An SAE i s any  AE from this study  that resul ts in one of the fo llowing outcomes:
death
initial or prol onged inpatient hospitalizat ion
a life- threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)
persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y
congenital ano maly/birth defect
considered significant by  the invest igator for any other re ason.
Important m edical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi talizati on may  be considered seri ous adverse drug events when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they  may jeopardize the patient or subject and may req uire medical or 
surgi cal interventi on to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definit ion.
Serious adverse events occurring after a patient has taken the last dose of invest igational product 
will be co llected for 30 days after the last dose of investi gational product, regardl ess of the 
investigator’s opinion o f causat ion.  Thereafter, SAEs are not required to be reported unless the 
investigator feels the events were related to either investigational product, or drug delivery 
system , or a protocol proce dure.

LY24868610.2.2. Other Safety Measures
10.2.2.1. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale and Self -Harm Follow -up Form
The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) captures the occurrence, severit y, and 
frequency  of suicide -related thoughts and behaviors during the assess ment period.  The scale 
includes suggested questions to solicit the ty pe of informat ion needed to determine if a suicide -
related thought or behavior occurred.  The tool was developed by  the Col umbia group (Posner 
2007) to prospectively  categorize suicide r elated events.  
Suicide-related events (behavior and/or ideat ions) will be assessed and evaluated at every visit 
with the administrati on of  the C -SSRS.  The Self -Harm  Follow-up Form  will be com pleted at 
any visit, including baseline visit, when a suicidal or nonsuicidal self -injuri ous behavi or is 
ident ified.  If a suicide -related event i s ident ified at any t ime during the study, a thorough 
evaluat ion shoul d be perform ed by  a study  physician and appropriate medical care should be 
provi ded.  
10.2.2.2. Clinical Labora tory Tests
Standard clinical laboratory  tests will  be perf ormed at times specified in the Study  Schedule 
(Attachm ent 1 ).
Invest igators must document their review of each laborator y report.  To ensure patient safet y 
during thi s study , laboratory  values that fall outside a clinically accepted reference range, o r 
values that differ significant ly from previous values, must be evaluated and co mmented on by 
the invest igator by marking each value clinically significant (CS) or not clinically significant 
(NCS). 
10.2.2.3. Vital Signs Data
A co mprehensive physical examinat ion will be performed at Visit 1.
Blood pressure and pulse will be collected in triplicate at every  visit, wi th readings at l east 
3minutes apart.  Prior to taking the blood pressure reading, the patient should be seated in a 
calm, quiet locat ion for at least 5 minutes or until the invest igator believes the patient is 
sufficient ly relaxed.
Invest igators will use the fo llowing gui delines when measuring vital signs:
Use the same arm for blood pressure collect ion throughout the study .
Measure blood pressure and puls e before any blood draws.
Support arm  with cuff at approximately  the heart level.
Ensure blood pressure cuff length is >2/3 circumference of arm size.  (Note: a larger or 
smaller cuff may  be requi red for larger and smaller patients).
10.2.2.4. Electrocardiograms
Twelve-lead ECGs will be obtained according to the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).  Triplicate 
ECGs will be co llected approximately 1 minute apart as sp ecified in Attachm ent 1 .  Subj ects 
F1J-MC-HMGW Clinical Protocol Page 39
LY248686must be supine for approximately 5 to 10 minutes before ECG collect ion and remain supine but 
awake during ECG co llection.
The ECGs will be interpreted by  a qualified physician ( the invest igator or qualified designee) at 
the site as soon after the time of ECG collection as possible, and ideally while the pat ient is still 
present, for immediate patient management and to determine whether the patient meets entry  
criteria.  If a clinically significant increase in the corrected QT (QTc) interval fro m baseline is 
present, then the invest igator should assess the patient for symptoms (such as palpitat ions, nea r 
syncope, syncope).
The ECGs will subsequently be electroni cally  transmi tted via m odem to the centralized ECG 
vendor designated by  Lilly.  The centralized ECG vendor’s cardio logist will then co mplete the 
ECG overread.  The central ECG vendor’s overread wi ll be used for data analysis and report 
writing purposes.
After the overread ECG is returned from the centralized ECG vendor, the invest igator or 
qualified designee is responsible for determining if any change to the patient management i s 
needed and must d ocum ent hi s/her review.
If there are differences in ECG interpretation between the invest igator or qualified designee and 
the ECG vendor cardio logist, the invest igator or qualified designee’s interpretation will prevail 
for study  entry  and immediate patientmanagement purposes, and the ECG vendor cardio logist’s 
interpretati onwill prevail  for data analysis purposes.
The invest igator (or qualified designee) must document his/her review of one of the replicate 
ECGs printed at the time of co llection, the final overread ECG report issued by the central ECG 
laboratory , and any alert reports.
10.2.3. Safety Monitoring
The Lilly CRP will mo nitor safet y data throughout the course of the study .
Lilly will review SAEs wit hin time frames mandated by co mpany procedures.  The Li lly CRP, 
will, as is appropriate, consult with the funct ionally  independent Gl obal Pat ient Safet y 
therapeuti c area physician or clinical scient ist, and review trends and laboratory  analy tes.
In the event that safet y monitoring uncovers a potent ial safet y signal, experts outside of the study
team  will be asked to evaluate the data.
10.2.4. Complaint Handling
Lilly co llects product complaints on invest igational products and drug delivery systems used in 
clinical trials i n order to ensure the safet y of study  participants, m onitor quali ty, and to facili tate 
process and product improvements.
Com plaint s related to unblinded comparator drugs are reported directly to the manufacturers of 
those drugs/devices in accordance with the package insert.
For blinded studies , all product com plaints associ ated wi th material packaged, l abeled, and 
released by Lilly  or del egate will be reported.
F1J-MC-HMGW Clinical Protocol Page 40
LY248686The invest igator or his/her designee is responsible for handling the fo llowing aspects of the 
product complaint process in accordance w ith the instructions provided for this study :
recording a complete descript ion of the product complaint reported and any 
associ ated AEs using the study -specifi c com plaint forms provided for this purpose
faxing the com pleted product complaint form wit hin 24 hours to Lilly or its 
designee.
If the invest igator is asked to return the product for invest igation, he/she will return a copy  of the 
product complaint form with the product.
10.3. Sample Collection and Testing
Attachm ent 1 lists the schedule for sample collect ions in this study.
Attachm ent 2 lists the specific tests that wi ll be performed for this study .
Attachm ent 3 provides a summary of the maximum number and vo lume of invasive samples, for
all sampling, during the study .  Fewer invasive sampling may actually  occur, but thi s will not 
requi re a protocol amendment.   
10.3.1. Samples for Standard Laboratory Testing
Blood and urine samples will be collected at the times specified in the Study  Schedule 
(Attachm ent 1 ).  Standard laboratory  tests, i ncluding chemistry , hematol ogy, and urinalysis 
panels ,will be collected non -fasting and analyzed. A serum pregnancy test will be performed (if 
applicable).  All clinical laboratory  tests will  be analyzed by  a central  laboratory .  Attachment 2
lists the specific tests that will be performed for this study .  
Invest igators must document their review of each laboratory  safety  report.
Samples co llected for specified laboratory tests will be destroyed wit hin 60 days of receipt of 
confirmed test results.  Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if n ecessary , to 
comply with applicable laws, regulat ions, or l aboratory  certificat ion standards.
Approximately  5 to 10 mL of blood for serum and plasma will be collected by venipuncture per 
the Study  Schedule (Attachm ent 1 ).  See Attachment 3 for the summary  of sample am ounts.
Approximately  40 mL of urine will  be collected.
Supplies required for the collect ion and shipment of the pat ients’ stored samples will be supplied 
by the sponsor.  Sample handling and shipment to the central laboratory  will occur per 
instructi ons given to the study  site.
10.3.2. Exploratory Work
10.3.2.1. Pharmacogenetic Evaluations
There i s growing evidence that genetic variat ion may impact a pati ent’s response to therapy .  
Variable response to therapy  may be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, 
distribut ion, metabo lism, and excretion, the mechanism of act ion of t he drug, the disease 
F1J-MC-HMGW Clinical Protocol Page 41
LY248686etiology and/or the m olecular subt ype of the disease being treated.  Therefore, where local 
regul ations allow, a 10-mL blood sam ple will be collected for poten tial pharmacogenet ic 
analysis.  It is a one -time collection, as noted in the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 )
.
Samples will  be stored and analysis may  be performed on genet ic variants though t to pl ay a rol e
in catecho lamine si gnaling including, but not limit ed to, catechol -O-methyltransferase to
evaluate their associat ion with observed clinical outcomes to duloxetine.
In the event of an unexpected AE or the observat ion of unusual response, the samples may be 
genoty ped and analy sis may be performed to evaluate a genet ic association wit h response to 
LY248686 .  These investigat ions m ay be limited to a focused candidate gene study  or, if 
appropriate, genome wide associat ion studi es may be perform ed to i dentify regions of the 
geno me associ ated wi th the variabilit y observed in drug response.  Samples will only be used for 
investigat ions rel ated to di sease and drug or class of drugs under study  in the context of this 
clinical program.  They will not be used for broad exploratory  unspeci fied disease or populat ion 
genet ic analysis.
Samples will  be ident ified by the pat ient number (coded) and stored for up to 15 y ears after the 
last pati ent visi t for the study  at a f acilit y selected by the sponsor.  The sample and any data 
generated fro m itcan only be linked back to the patient by invest igator site personnel.
10.4. Appropriateness of Measurements
All safet y and efficacy  assessments have been well docume nted and are generally  regarded as 
reliable, accurate, and relevant in this pat ient population.
F1J-MC-HMGW Clinical Protocol Page 42
LY24868611.Data Quality  Assurance
To ensure accurate, complete, and reliable data, Lilly or its representatives will do the fo llowing:
provi de instructi onal materi al to the study  sites, as appropriate
sponsor a start- up training sessio n to instruct the investiga tors and study  
coordinators.  Thi s sessio n will give instruction on the protocol, the complet ion of 
the CRFs, and study  procedures
make periodic visit s to the study  site
be available for consultation and stay  in contact with the study  site personnel by
mail, tel ephone, and/or fax
review and evaluate CRF data and use standard computer edits to detect errors in 
data collect ion
conduct a qualit y review of the database
In addit ion, Lilly or its representatives may periodically check a sample of the pati ent data 
recorded against source documents at the study  site.  The study  may be audi ted by  Lilly or i ts 
representatives, and/or regulatory  agencies at any  time.  Invest igators will be given notice before 
an audit occurs.
To ensure the safet y of parti cipant s in the study , and to ensure accurate, complete, and reliable 
data, the invest igator will keep records of laboratory tests, clinical notes, and patient medical 
records in the patient files as original source documents for the study .  If requested, the 
investigator will provi de the sponsor, applicable regulatory  agencies, and applicable ERBs wit h 
direct access t o original source docum ents.
11.1. Data Capture S ystem
An electronic data capture sy stem  will be used in this trial.  The site maintains a separate source
for the data entered by  the si te into the sponsor -provided electronic data capture system.
Case report form data will be encoded and stored in a clinical trial database.  Data managed by a 
central  vendor, such as laboratory  test data or ECG data, will be stored electronically in the 
central  vendor’s database system.  Data will subsequent ly be transferred from the central vendor 
to the Lilly generic labs system.
Any data for which the CRF or paper documentation provided by the patient or parent/legal 
repres entative will serve as the source document will be ident ified and documented by each site 
in that site’s study  file.  Paper documentation provided by  the patient or parent/legal 
representative may include, for example, a rating scale to collect patient -reported outcome (PRO) 
measures.
Data from co mplaint forms submitted to Lilly will be encoded and stored in the global product 
complaint m anagement sy stem .
F1J-MC-HMGW Clinical Protocol Page 43
LY24868612.Sample Size and Statistical Methods
12.1. Determination of Sample Size
Approximately  210 pati ents will be rando mized in a 1:1 ratio to the duloxet ine and placebo 
treatm ent groups. This study  is to assess the difference of the mean change in BPI average pain 
severit y from baseline to the last time po int(Visit 8, Week 13) in Study  Period II between 
treatm ent groups. Assuming that there will be so me missing post -baseline data, this sample size 
will provide at least 80% power to detect the treatment difference with α=.05. All the parameters 
used in the sample size calculat ionswere based on the MMRM analysis o f data from  3-month, 
placebo -controlled, acute treatment period in 2adult FM studies: Study  F1J-MC-HMCA and 
Study  F1J-MC-HMCJ.
12.2. Statistical and Analytical Plans
12.2.1. General Considerations
All analys es will be conducted on an intent-to-treat basis, meaning that data will be analyzed by 
the treatment groups to which patients are randomly assigned, even if the patient does not take 
the assigned treatment, does not receive the correct treatment, or does not comply wit h the 
protoco l.
Treatment effects and interaction effects will be evaluated based on a 2 -sided significance l evel 
of 0.05.  No adj ustments for multiple com parisons will be made.
A repeated measures analysis refers to a restricted maximum likelihood -based, mixed -effects
repeated m easures analysis, using all the longitudinal observat ions at each post -baseline visit.
Unless otherwise specified, when an ANOVA model is used to analyze a continuous variable, 
the model will contain the terms of treatment and investigator.  The significance of treatm ent-by-
investigator interaction will be evaluated in a separated model when it is necessary.  Similar 
logic is applied to an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, which in general refers to the 
ANOVA model with baseline values added as a covariate.  Ty pe III sum -of-squares for the least -
squares means (LSMeans) will be used for the statistical co mpar isons using ANOVA or 
ANCOVA when there is no interaction term invo lved.  For the ANOVA or ANCOVA models 
where the interaction term is inc luded, the Ty pe II sum -of-squares for the LSMeans will be 
employed. 
Unless otherwise specified, when a total score is calculated from individual items, it will be 
considered missing if any of the individual items are missing; when an average score is 
computed from  individual items, it is calculated from nonmissing values. 
Unless otherwise spec ified, for all analyses for Study  PeriodII, baseline is defined as the last 
nonmissing observation at or before the randomization visit (Visit 2).  For analyses usi ng the 
last-observation -carried -forward (LOCF) approach, endpoint is defined as the last nonmissing 
observat ion obtained fro m Visit 3 through Visi t 8.
F1J-MC-HMGW Clinical Protocol Page 44
LY248686In some analyses for Study  Period II, the baseline -observat ion-carried -forward (BOCF) endpoint 
is specif ied.  The BOCF endpo int is defined as fo llows:
For randomized patients who complete the treatment period (that is, complete the 
scheduled Visit 8), the BOCF endpoint is defined as the last nonmissing observat ion, or 
for rando mized patients who di scont inue early  (that is, do not com plete the scheduled 
Visit 8)but with at least one non -missing baseline value , the BOCF endpoint is defined 
as the baseline value.
In Study  Period II, all pat ients who randomized to duloxet ine will be considered as being in 
duloxetine treatment group, and duloxetinewill be com pared wi th placebo using stati stical 
inference .In Study  Period III, descri ptive statist ics will be used to summarize for patients who 
entered Study  Period III. The treatment groups for Study  Period III wil l be defined as fo llows: 
placebo/dul oxetine (PLA /DLX )for those who are rando mized to placebo during Study Period II 
and who enter Study  Period III taking dulo xetine, and DLX/DLX for those who are randomized 
to dul oxetine during Study  Period II and who ent er Study Period III taking duloxetine.
When invest igator sites are used in an analysis, investigators with fewer than 2 pati ents 
rando mized to placebo and 2 patients rando mized to duloxetine (each pat ients has nonmissing 
BPI average pain severit y score) will be pool ed within countri es for statistical analysis purposes.  
If the poo led site st ill has fewer than 2 patients randomized to placebo and 2 patients rando mized 
to dul oxetine, these sites will be pool ed wi th the next smallest site in the same countr y, or if there 
are none, then the next smallest site in the study  overall in another co untry.
Categorical com parisons between treatment groups will be performed using Fisher’s exact test.
Any changes to the analysis plan, both those prior to unblinding the data and those subsequent to 
unblinding, will be documented and just ified in the final study  report.  Expl oratory  analyses of 
the data will be conducted as deemed appropriate.
SAS software will be used to perform all statist ical analyses . Statist ical analysis of this study  
will be the responsibilit y of Eli Lilly and Com pany or desi gnee.
12.2.2. Patient Disposition
Patient disposi tion (reasons for discontinuation from the study ) will be summarized overall and 
by visit for each treatm ent group.  The reasons for dis continuat ion will  be com pared between 
treatm ent groups using Fisher’s exact test in Study Period II .Reasons for discont inuat ion in 
Study  Period III will be summarized by treatment groups.
12.2.3. Patient Characteristics
Patient dem ographics (age, gender, racial origin, country , 
body  mass index [BMI], height, and 
weight), d uration of fibro myalgia and baseline efficacy measures ( BPI average pain severit y, 
PPQ average pain rating, CGI -Severit y, FDI -child, FDI -parent) will be summarized for all 
rando mized patients fo r Study  Period II and all patients who entered the extensio n periodfor 
Study  Period III .  In addit ion, baseline assessment for depressio n (CDI) will be summarized by 
MDD and non -MDD status , and baseline assessment for anxiet y (MASC) will be summarized by 
F1J-MC-HMGW Clinical Protocol Page 45
LY248686GAD and non -GAD status for all rando mized patients for Study  Period II and all pat ients who 
entered extensio n periodfor Study  Period III .  For Study  Period II, the baseline comparabilit y 
among treatm ent groups will be examined using an ANOVA model wit h the term s of treatment 
and invest igator for continuous measures, and using Fisher’s exact test for categorical data. 
Patient characterist ics in Study  Period III will  be summarized by treatment groups without 
statis tical comparison.
12.2.4. Concomitant Therapy 
Previous medicat ions for the treatm ent of FM, MDD , and GAD will be summarized by treatment 
group.  The frequency of conco mitant medicat ion usage during the double -blind t reatm entperiod
will also be summarized by  treatm ent group and the comparison will be conducted using Fisher’s 
exact test for Study  Period II. Concomitant therapy in Study III will be summarized by 
treatm ents groups without any  stati stical co mpar ison.
12.2.5. Treatment Compliance 
A pat ient will be considered to be compliant with investigational p roduct for each visit interval if 
theytake between 80 % and 120% of invest igational product capsules prescribed for that i nterval.
Overall com pliance is defined as having been compliant at all visits.  The percentage of patients 
who are compliant at each visit and overall will be sum marized by  treatm ent group for Study  
Period II and III .
12.2.6. Primary Outcome and Methodology
The primary  object ive of this study  is to assess the efficacy  of duloxetine 30/60 mg QD versus 
placebo in the treatm ent of adolescents with JPFS .
The primary  efficacy  measure is the BPI average pain severit y in Study  Period II .  The primary 
efficacy  analysis will be the contrast between duloxet ine and placebo at the last visit in Study 
Period II ( Visit 8, Week 13 ) from a MMRM analysis on chan ge from baseline in the BPI aver age 
pain severit y. The m odel for this analysis will include the fixed class effects of treatment, 
investigat ive site, visit, and treatment -
by-visit interaction, as well as the cont inuous, fixed 
covari ates of baseline value a nd baseline value -by-visit interaction.  The Kenward- Roger 
(Kenward and Roger, 1997) approximat ion will be used to estimate denominator degrees of 
freedo m.  An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within -patient errors.  
If the defau lt Newton -Raphson algorithm used by SAS PROC MIXED does not converge, then 
the Fisher scoring algorithm will be applied. If the model with unstructured covariance structure 
fails to converge, the sandwich estimator ( Diggle et al. 1994; Lu and Mehrotra, 20 10) will be 
used to estimate the standard errors of the fixed effects parameters and the model will be fit 
using covariance structures of the fo llowing order unt il convergence is met: 
1.heterogeneous toeplitz type = toeph
2.heterogeneous autoregressive (1st order) type = arh(1)
3.heterogeneous compound symmetric type = cs(h)
4.toeplitz type = toep
5.autoregressive (1st order) type = ar(1)
6.compound symmetric type = cs
F1J-MC-HMGW Clinical Protocol Page 46
LY248686When the sandwich est imator is used, the Kenward -Roger approximat ion for denominator 
degre es of freedo m cannot be used.  Instead, the deno minator degrees of freedo m will be 
partitioned into between -subject and within -subject portions.  SAS ®PROC MIXED will be used 
to perform the analysis. In addit ion, sensitivity analysis will also be performe d to address the 
impact of missing data on the primary efficacy analysis.  The intent of this sensit ivity analysis is 
to com pare the resul ts from assuming Missing at Rando m (MAR) versus Missing Not at Rando m 
(MNAR) and to check for consistency o f treatm entcontrasts.  More details will be described in 
the Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP).
12.2.7. Efficacy Analyses 
Table HMGW. 1presents the addit ional analyses fo r the primary efficacy variable and the 
analyses for the secondary  efficacy variables in Study  Period II , eithercollected direct ly from 
CRFs or derived fro m raw observations.
Descript ive statistics will be used to summarize these variables, as applicable, bytreatm ent 
group (PLA/DLX and DLX/DLX) during Study  Peri od III. The details of baseline definit ion of 
the secondary  efficacy  measures for Study  Period III will  be discussed in SAP. Maintenance 
effect of duloxetine 30/60 mg QD during Study  Peri od III wil l be assessed using the BPI average 
pain severit y in only  the acute phase responders (defined as those patients with ≥30% pain 
reducti on from baseline on the BPI average pain severit y measure). The null hypothesis that the 
treatm ent effect of dul oxetine wa s not m aintained during the extensio n treatment phase was 
tested using T -test by  evaluat ing if upper bound of the 97.5% CI of the change fro m baseline to 
endpo int for pati ents in the extensio
n treatment phase who responded to duloxet ine 30 mg QD to 
60 m g QD in Study  Period II (acute phase duloxet ine responders) is less than or equal to the pre-
specified margin o f 1.5. In thi s analysis, baseline was defined as the last non -missing observat ion 
during Visit 3 to Visit 8, and endpo int was defined as the last no n-missing observat ion in the 
Study  Period III. The non -inferiorit y margin o f 1.5 is chosen based on past experience fro m 
duloxetine Diabet ic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain ( DPNP ) study  F1J-MC-HMEM and Chronic 
Low Back Pain ( CLBP ) study  F1J-MC-HMEN, both of th ose studi es used 1.5 as margin to 
assess maintenance of effect under dul oxetine 60/120 m g treatm ent as m easured by 24 -hour 
average pain in 0 -10 scale.

Van der Waerden test.
6.  Time to event variable:
a. Time to first 30% reduction in 
BPI average pain score
b. Time to first 50% reduction in 
BPI average pain score
c. Time to sustained responsea. For the patients with a 30% reduction 
at a visit in the treatment phase, time = 
days from the date of the visit that the 
earliest 30% reduction is observed to 
the random ization date.
b. For the patients with a 50% 
reductio n at a visit in the treatment 
phase, time = days from the date of the 
visit that the earliest 30% reduction is 
observed to the randomization date.
c. For the sustained responders defined 
above, time = th e days from the date of 
the visit which is the earlier visit from 
which the sustained response is 
observed to the randomization dateFor Variables 6.a to 6.c, the 
Kaplan -Meier survival 
curves of time to event will 
be calculated by treatment 
group. In the c alculatio n, 
patients who do not have 
the event will be 
considered as right -
censored observation. The 
comparison of the survival 
curves between treatment 
groups will be conducted 
by a log -rank test and 
stratified log -rank test 
controlling for pooled 
investi gator.

12.2.8. Safety Analyses
Safety will be assessed by summarizing and analyzing treatment -emergent AEs, SAEs, death, 
rates and reasons for discont inuat ion, laboratory  measurements, vi tal signs, height, weight, and 
F1J-MC-HMGW Clinical Protocol Page 49
LY248686ECGs. In addit ion, suicide risk and suicide -related events (behavior and/or ideat ion) will be 
assessed by  the C -SSRS. The safet y analyses w ill be conducted for both Study  Period II and 
Study  Period III. In Study  Period II, dul oxetine will be co mpared with placebo using statist ical 
inference. In Study  Period III, descri ptive statist ics will be used to summarize for patients who 
entered Study Period III. The details of baseline definit ionof the safet y measures for Study  
Period III will be discussed in SAP.
Categorical Safety Variables
Com parisons between treatment groups for all categorical safet y measures will be made by 
Fisher’s exact test.
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are the reported events that first occurred or 
worsened during the treatment period.  For each AE, the severit y level is recorded according to 
the pati ent’s or invest igator’s perceived severit y of the event (mild, moderate, severe , or m ore 
severe than baseline), the category  of ‘more severe than baseline’ only  applies to the AE wi th 
baseline severit y of severe and worsened during the study .  The incidence rates of TEAEs will be 
analyzed by Fisher’s exact test.  Mor eover, TEAEs will be summarized by their maximum 
severit y and system  organ cl ass and analyzed by  Fisher’s exact test.
The death, SAEs, and AEs reported as reasons for discontinuat ion (DCAE) will be summarized 
by treatment group and compared among the treatment groups using Fisher's exact tests.
For l aboratory  measurements, t he incidence rates of treatment -emergent abnorm ally high or l ow 
laboratory  values at endpoint will be assessed using Fisher’s exact test.  A “treatm ent-emergent 
high value at endpoint” is defined as a change from a value less than or equal to the high limit at 
all baseline visits to a value greater than the high limit at endpoint.  A “treatm ent-emergent low 
value at endpoint” is defined as a change from a value greater than or equal  to the l ow limi t at all 
baseline visits to a value less than the low limit at endpo int.
Categorical analysis of weight will be performed and treatment difference will be assessed using 
Fisher's exact test.
The incidence of patients meeting criteri a for potent ially clinically significant (PCS) changes in 
vital signs, and incidence of pat ients with sustained el evation in blood pressure, as defined in the 
SAP, will be co mpared between treatment groups. Patients with abnormal vital signs baseline 
assessment will be excluded fro m the analysis o f that measure.
The incidence of patients meeting criteria for PCS changes in ECG intervals and heart rate, as 
defined in the SAP, will also be compared between treatment groups.
Suicide-related thoughts and behav iors based on the C -SSRS will be summarized by treatment.  
In parti cular, for each of the fo llowing suicide -related events, the number and percent of patients 
with the event will be enumerated by  treatm ent:  com pleted sui cide, nonfatal  suicide attem pt, 
interrupted attem pt, aborted attempt, preparatory  acts or behavi or, active suicidal ideat ion with 
specific plan and intent, active suicidal ideat ion with some intent to act without specific plan, 
active suicidal ideat ion with any methods (no plan) without int ent to act, nonspecific act ive 
suicidal thoughts, and wi sh to be dead. In addit ion, the number and percent of patients who 
F1J-MC-HMGW Clinical Protocol Page 50
LY248686experienced at least one of various composite measure swill be presented.  These include suicidal 
acts (com pleted sui cide and nonfat al suicidal attempts), suicidal behavior (suicidal acts, 
interrupted attem pts, aborted attem pts, and preparatory  acts or behavior), treatment -emergent 
suicidal ideation, or treatment -emergent suicidal behavior.  Fisher’s exact test will be used for 
treatm ent comparisons. For each event, p -values will only be displayed if at least 4 events 
occurred in at least 1 treatm ent group.
Continuous Safety Measures
Mean change fro m baseline to endpoint in laboratory  analy tes will be assessed using the 
ANOVA model (see Secti on 12.2.1 ). Rank -transform ed data will be used for the laboratory  
analysis.
Change from baseline to endpoint in vital signs , ECG s,and weight/height will be analyzed using 
the ANCOVA model wit h baseline safety  value as covari ate.
Time to Event
Time to event data for important safet y endpoints (such as DCAE, onset of the important 
TEAE s) will be analyzed combining data fro m Study  Period II and Study  Period III for patients 
who received duloxet ine at anyt ime during the ent ire study .  Details o f the analysis will be 
provi ded in the SAP.
Analysis of Drug Taper Period
Similar to the Double -Blind Treatm ent Peri od, pati ent disposit ion, death s, SAEs, and taper-
emergent AEs will be summarized by  treatm ent groups  and analyzed using Fisher’s exact test.
Taper -emergent AEs are defined as the new or worsened events reported at Visit 301 compared 
with events reported at baseline (baseline is the la st 2 vi sits bef ore Visi t 301). 
Suicide-related thoughts and behaviors based on the C -SSRS will be summarized by treatment 
group.
Change from baseline (last nonmissing value before Visit 301) to endpoint in vital signs and 
weight in the taper peri od will be analyzed using the AN COVA m odel (see Secti on 12.2.1 ).

8. Country  name
Abbreviations: BPI = Brief Pain Inventory; MDD = major depressive disorder; GAD = generalized anxiety disorder; 
vs. = versus.
To analyze a specific subgroup’s impact, change from baseline to endpoint (LOCF and BOCF) 
in BPI average pain will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model with all the terms described 
generally in Section 12.2.1 with addit ional terms of the subgroup and the subgroup -by-treatm ent 
interact ion.  The primary statist ical test will be for the treatment -by-subgroup interaction, which 
will be tested at the signifi cance l evel of  0.05.
Furtherm ore, treatm ent group differences will be evaluated within each category  of a subgroup 
regardl ess of the significance level of the treatment -by-subgroup interaction.  For the subgroup 
of Race Ori gin, all the categories that have <10% of  the pati ents in the study  will be combined in 
the analysis.
Subgroup analysis for other efficacy and safet y variables will be conducted as deemed 
appropriate and necessary.
12.2.10. Interim Analyses
An analysis o f data will be performed when all patients have co mpleted or di scont inued early 
from Study  Period II.  F or this analysis, the database will be locked and unblinded data fro m 
Study  Period I Study  Period II will be analyzed and reported.  This is considered the final data 
lock for the Study  Period II , and  will not be considered an interim analysis that requires a formal 
F1J-MC-HMGW Clinical Protocol Page 52
LY248686data m onitoring committee (DMC )and no further adjustment to the final analysis significance 
level is needed.
The rem ainder of the analyses will be performed when all pat ients have co mpleted Study  Period 
IV or have been discontinued from the study .
If an unplanned interim analysis is deemed necessary , the appropri ate Lilly  regulatory  scientist 
will be consulted to determine whether it is necessary  to am end the protocol .

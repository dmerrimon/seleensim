Page 7 of 104 Study Design:  This is a Phase 3 , multicenter, 52-week, outpati ent, open -label  study to 
evaluate the long -term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of KarXT in 
de novo subjects , defined as those who did not have prior exposure to 
KarXT , who meet DSM -5 criteria for schizophrenia. The study consists of a 
screening phase of up to 14 days  (up to a 7 -day screening extension is 
permitted with medical monitor approval ), a baseline phase of up to 5 days, 
a 52-week open- label treatment phase , and a 7 -day safety follow -up/end of 
study (EOS) visit following the last dose of KarXT for subjects who  
complete the treatment phase and those who prematurely discontinue from 
the study 
Screening Phase: 
A suitable number of subjects will be screened to enroll approximately 
600 subjects (aged 18 to 65 years) with schizophrenia who are 
psychiatrically stable and can be adequately managed in an outpatient 
setting across approximately 60 study sites in the United States.  The 
screening phase will last up to 14 days (up to a 7 -day screening extension is 
permitted with medical monitor approval ). 
Baseline Phase:  
Subjects who meet the screening criteria will participate in a baseline 
period  consisting of two separate visits . The start of the baseline period, 
Baseline Visit A, must be at least 3 days (and no more than 5 days) prior to 
Baseline Visit B.  Subjec ts must continue to meet eligibility criteria 
throughout the baseline period to remain in the study.  
Treatment Phase : 
In this open -label  study , all subjects will receive KarXT for up to 52  weeks. 
All subjects will start on a lead -in dose of KarXT 50/20 (50 mg 
xanomeline/20 mg trospium  chloride ) twice daily (BID) for the first 2 days 
(Days 1 and 2), followed by KarXT 100/20 BID for the remainder of 
Week  1 (Days 3 to 7). At Visit 3 (Day 8), dosing will be titrated upwards to 
KarXT 125/30 BID unless t he subject is continuing to experience adverse 
events (AEs) from the previous dose of KarXT 100/20 BID. All subjects who are increased to KarXT 125/30 BID, depending on tolerability, will 
have the option to return to KarXT 100/20 BID.

5.1 Background on Schizophrenia  
Schizophrenia is a long-term mental disorder involving a breakdown in the relation between 
thought, emotion, and behavior, and leads to faulty perception, inappropriate actions and 
feelings, withdrawal from reality and personal relationships into fantasy and delusion, and a 
sense of mental fragmentation. Symptoms include delusions, hallucination, disorganized speech or behavior, and impaired cognitive ability.[ 1] The prevalence of schizophrenia is between 0.6% 
and 1.9% in the United States (US) population.[ 2] Moreover, a claims analysis has estimated that 
the annual prevalence of diagnosed schizophrenia in the United States is 5.1 per 1000 lives.[ 3] It 
is found equally in males and females, with males usually having an earlier onset of symptoms.[ 4]  
Antipsychotic drugs (APDs)  are the mainstay o f treatment for schizophrenia .[5] All currently 
available APDs act through blockage of all or subsets of dopamine receptors in the brain. First-
gener ation APDs include chlorpromazine and haloperidol; treatment with these agents is marked 
by high rates of parkinsonian extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and tardive dyskinesia and they 
consequently have limited use today. The second- generation agents, which in clude risperidone, 
olanzapine, quetiapine, lurasidone, aripiprazole , and lumateperone, tend to have lower levels of 
EPS or tardive dyskinesia and are currently the most commonly prescribed APD class. However, 
the second -generation drugs also have problemat ic side effects that include significant weight 
gain, metabolic disturbances, sedation , and akathisia.[ 6, 7, 8] These side effects contribute to 
poor medication adherence resulting in frequent relapses and hospitalizations.[ 9, 10] Thus, there 
is a need for medications for schizophrenia that act through alternative mechanisms.  
Central muscarinic receptors have been hypothesized to be therapeutic treatments for schizophrenia based on several converging lines of evidence including both animal and human studies.[ 11, 12] There are 5 subtypes of muscarinic receptors (M1 -M5). The therapeutic effect of 
central muscarinic receptor agonism is thought to be due to agonism of M1 and M4 receptors in 
the central nerv ous system (CNS).[ 13] However, compounds that agonize M1 and M4 receptors 
are often not specific enough not to also agonize M2 and M3 receptors outside of the CNS due to the highly conserved allosteric binding sites that the receptors share, leading to adverse events 
(AEs) related to activation of these peripheral receptors. Thus, any potential benefit of 
muscarinic agonists in schizophrenia (or other indications such as Alzheimer’s disease [AD] ) has 
been outweighed by the occurrence of AEs associated with peripheral cholinergic side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, and excess salivation). 
5.2 Background on KarXT (Xanomeline Tartrate and Tros pium Chloride)  
Xanomeline tartrate is a muscarinic -cholinergic receptor agonist. It has agonistic activity at all 
5 muscarinic receptors, but preferentially stimulates M 1 and M 4 receptors and binding to M1 
and M4 receptors in the CNS , which is thought to be responsible for the drug’s potential

Page 23 of 104 therapeutic effects (Roth, unpublished data). A recent study reports that xanomeline is a very 
potent M4 muscarinic agonist in vivo, measured by various second messenger assays.[ 14] 
Xanomeline also enters the brain rapidly achieving a brain to plasma ratio of greater than 10 making it an attractive CNS drug candidate.[ 15]  
Xanomeline does not have any direct binding activity on dopaminergic receptors, suggesting that its mechanism of action is unrelated to direct dopamine involvement.  
Previous double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials have provided strong evidence that xanomeline has clinically relevant antipsychotic efficacy. In a multicenter outpatient trial in AD 
(N = 343), 3 doses of xanomeline (up to 225 mg/day) and placebo were assess ed for 
26 weeks.[ 16, 17] Significant dose -dependent improvement s in psychotic symptoms relative to 
placebo were observed. Moreover, psychotic symptoms resolved quite rapidly in subjects who were symptomatic at baseline and a dose-dependent reduction in the emergence of psychotic 
symptoms versus (vs) placebo was also observed. In a completer analysis, cognitive 
improvement was also found suggesting longer treatment intervals may be necessary for cognitive enhancement.[ 16, 17] In a subsequent small (N = 20) double-blind, placebo-controlled 
inpatient trial in treatment- resistant subjects with schizophrenia, xanomeline (225 mg/day) 
demonstrated robust and relatively rapid improvement in psychosis compared to placebo. In 
addition, improvement in both negative symptoms and cogniti ve impairment was observed.[ 18] 
In both the AD and schizophrenia trials, as well as in previous healthy volunteer studies, dose-dependent “cholinergi c” AEs were also reported, namely vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, 
sweating , and hypersalivation. These side effects were frequent and, at the higher doses of 
xanomeline, led  to significant rates of discontinuation in the AD studies. This “cholinergic” AE 
profi le curtailed further development of xanomeline as a single agent.  
It is believed that the procholinergic AEs associated with xanomeline are mediated by xanomeline’s stimulation of peripheral  rather than central muscarinic receptors, which would 
make these AEs theoretically amenable to counteracting peripheral anticholinergic treatment. Trospium chloride is a peripherally acting muscarinic antagonist that binds to and antagonizes all 
5 muscarinic receptor subtypes.[ 19] It is a commonly used generic drug approved for over 
10 years by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) and by European authorities to treat 
overactive bladder and is generally well tolerated.[19] Several human subject studies have demonstrated that trospium does not appreciably cross the blood- brain barrier, consistent with 
the drug’s quaternary ammonium structure.[ 20]  
KarXT is a novel combination of xanomeline tartrate and trospium c hloride. Karuna 
Therapeutics (hereafter, Karuna) hypothesized that the addition of trospium would mitigate 
peripheral procholinergic side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, and excess 
salivation) and thus provide a strategy to allow xanomeline to be administered and stimulate 
brain muscarinic receptors with a decreased side effect burden. Phase 1 studies in healthy 
volunteers of this combination demonstrated that KarXT reduced these side effects by 46% 
compared to xanomeline alone.[ 21] Moreover, the remaining cholinergic AEs were generally

and were generally single episode. In general, KarXT was well tolerated in healthy adult 
volunteers. These encouraging safety data prompted further work to assess KarXT for the 
treatment of schizophrenia and potentially other CNS disorders. 
Karuna has recently completed an adequate and well -controlled, randomized, multicenter 
Phase 2, placebo- controlled, inpatient clinical trial of acute psychosis with schizophrenia in 
182 adult subjects (KAR-004). KarXT demonstrated a statistically significant and c linically 
meaningful 11.6 point mean reduction in total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) 
at 5 weeks compared to placebo (p <0.0001), with statistical separation at each time point 
assessed (2, 4 , and 5 weeks), and also demonstrated good overall safety and tolerability. 
The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the long- term safety , tolerability , and efficacy  of 
KarXT (xanomeline 125 mg/trospium chloride  30 mg) administered twice daily (BID) in adult 
outpatients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual‒Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnosis of schizophrenia.   
Xanomeline is currently not approved or marketed in any country. Trospium is marketed in the 
United S tates and other regions of the world for the treatment of overactive bladder.

the cognitive test battery, subjects in the xanomeline group showed impro vements relative to 
placebo in some of the cognitive domain s of verbal learning and short-term memory function. 
These studies demonstrated the potential for xanomeline as a treatment for psychosis and 
cognition across multiple subject populations.  
Study H2Q- EW-E001, conducted by Eli Lilly, had 36 male healthy volunteers in 4 groups of 9, 
who were administered escalating single doses of xanomeline tartrate in increments of 1, 5, 10, 
25, 50, 75, 100, and 150 mg. Each group took 2 ascending doses of xanomeline tartrate and 
1 dose of placebo in a single subject blind manner. There were no serious AEs (SAEs). A Es 
included watery diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, sweating, shivering, mild disorientation, increased blood pressure (BP), increase (s) in sitting and standing heart rate, slight increase in supine 
systolic BP, and postural hypotension. 
The clinical experience with KarXT initiated by Karuna to date includes 3  completed Phase 1, 
clinical pharmacology studies in healthy volunteers (KAR-001, KAR-002, and KAR-003) and 1 
completed Phase 2 study (KAR-004) in adult inpatients with DSM-5 schizophrenia. 
The first study conducted by Karuna ( KAR-001) was a Phase 1, double -blind, randomized, 
multiple -dose, pilot study comparing xanomeline administered alone to xanomeline administered  
in combination with trospium chloride in normal healthy volunteers. This study consisted of 
2 arms, in which xanomeline was administered 3 times daily ( TID), alone, at a total daily dose of 
225 mg in 1 arm; the second arm received the same dose of xanomeline in combination with 
trospium chloride 20 mg administered BID, a total daily dose of 40 mg. Subjects were treated for 
7 days. The goal was to determine if this dosing regimen would reduce the cholinergic side 
effects of xanomeline by coadministration of the muscarinic antagonist, trospium. 
Overall, treatment with xanomeline 225 mg daily + trospium 40  mg daily administered over 
7 days was considered safe and well tolerated. The results of key and supportive endpoints 
showed a numerical reduction (although not statistically significant) in visual analog scale ( VAS ) 
scores for cholinergic events for the xanomeline + trospium treatment arm compared to the xanomeline- alone treatment arm. Specifically, consistent  numerical reductions in VAS scores for 
the xanomeline + trospium treatment arm w ere observed for the supportive endpoints of 
maximum weekly individual VAS scores and mean daily maximum composite VAS scores.  
Results of the clinician -administered scales we re supportive of a reduction in vomiting, feelings 
of nausea, excess salivation, and sweating that interfered with daily activities in the 
xanomeline + trospium treatment arm compared to the xanomeline -alone treatment arm.  
There were no meaningful differences between treatment groups in heart rate, resting BP, orthostatic BP , or any electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters including QT. A small subset of 
subjects in both treatment arms had transient increases in heart rate and orthostatic BP changes, which may ha ve contributed to syncope and postural dizziness in those subjects. Two subjects

Page 29 of 104 (both in the xanomeline -alone arm) experienced syncope. The incidence of orthostatic AEs in the 
KarXT group was approximately one-half that of subjects in the xanomeline-alone group. 
The most commonly reported treatment- emergent AEs (TEAEs) in KAR -001 (≥20% of subjects 
in either treatment arm) were hyperhidrosis, salivary hypersecretion, nausea, dizziness postural, 
and diarrhea. Subject incidences of these 5 TEAEs was higher in  the xanomeline- alone treatment 
arm (61.8%) compared to the xanomeline + trospium treatment arm (34.3%).  
Overall, treatment with xanomeline 225 mg combined with trospium chloride 40  mg 
administered over 7 days was considered safe and well  tolerated. The o bserved side effect profile 
was consistent with the known safety profile of xanomeline and trospium chloride. The incidence 
of TEAEs and cholinergic TEAEs was lower in the xanomeline + trospium treatment arm 
compared to the xanomeline- alone treatment arm.

 TEAEs were mild or moderate in 
severity, and there were no SAEs or deaths. TE AEs were primarily cholinergic or orthostatic 
(and a few anticholinergic). Doses of 100 mg and 125 mg BID of xanomeline were well t olerated 
when paired with 20 mg and 40 mg BID of trospium chloride , respectively. The safety and 
tolerability profile of KarXT 100/20 BID and KarXT 125/40 BID was acceptable and supports 
further evaluation at similar doses in future studies. Doses of KarXT  150/20 BID and 150/40 
BID were not well tolerated in this study. A pairing of 150 mg xanomeline with 40 mg trospium chloride appeared to be better tolerated than 150/20, but some subjects still experienced 
tolerability issues.  
Study KAR- 004 was a Phase 2 randomized, double- blinded study to assess the safety , 
tolerability, and efficacy of KarXT in adults with DSM -5 schizophrenia, hospitalized with acute 
psychosis. The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of KarXT (125/30 BID) vs placebo  in reducing PANSS total scores in adult inpatients with a DSM -5 diagnosis of 
schizophrenia. Subjects received either KarXT or placebo (1:1 ratio) for a treatment period of 5 weeks. All subjects on KarXT received a lead -in dose of KarXT 50/20 BID for the first 2  days 
followed by KarXT 100/20 BID on Days 3 to 7. On Day 8, dosing was titrated upwards to KarXT 125/30 BID unless the subject was continuing to experience AEs from a previous dose 
increase of 100/20 BID. A total of 182 subjects were enrolled a nd randomized (92 placebo; 
90 KarXT). Of these subjects, 170 (87 [94.6%] placebo; 83 [92.2%] KarXT) received at least 
1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 postbaseline PANSS assessment ( modified intent -to-treat 
[mITT] population used for the efficacy analyses) . Discontinuation rates were similar between 
the 2 treatment groups; 37 subjects discontinued the study early (19 [20.7%] placebo; 18 [20.0%] 
KarXT). The most common reason for early discontinuation was consent withdrawn (14 [15.2%] placebo; 14 [15.6%] KarXT) followed by AE (2 [2.2%] placebo; 3 [3.3%] KarXT). 
TEAEs were reported in 43.3% of subjects in the placebo group and 53.9% of subjects in the 
KarXT group. The most commonly reported TEAEs were constipation, nausea, dry mouth,

KarXT group than in the placebo group.   
There were 27.8% and 42.7% of subjects in the placebo and KarXT groups, respectively, who 
experienced at least 1 TEAE related to study drug. The most commonly reported study drug 
related TEAEs for the placebo and KarXT total groups were nausea, constipation, dry mouth, 
dyspepsia, and vomiting and were more common (≥5% higher or twice that of placebo) in the 
KarXT group than in the placebo group. The majority of the reported TEAEs were mild (27.8% 
placebo; 36.0% KarXT) or moderate (14.4% placebo; 16.9% KarXT) in severity. Two severe 
TEAEs were reported during the study. One subject in the placebo group had a severe TEAE of 
worsening schizophrenia symptoms, and 1 subject in the KarXT high dose group had a severe 
event of increased psychosis which was reported as an SAE possibly related  to KarXT by the 
investigator. There were no other SAEs reported during the study and there were no deaths 
during the study. 
The pattern and course of safety findings in KAR-004 were consistent with the known safety 
profile from earlier studies of both xanomeline monotherapy and xanomeline combined with 
trospium (KarXT). Even though the qualitative AE profile was consist ent with earlier Phase 1 
PK/safety studies in healthy volunteers, the relative tolerability burden was lower in th is study of 
subjects with schizophrenia receiving KarXT t han in the healthy volunteers. In addition, the 
safety and tolerability of KarXT was favorable and notably free of many common side effects 
associated with current APDs . 
KarXT demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in total PANSS score at all time points over 5 weeks compared to placebo (Figure 1). The primary efficacy 
endpoint result for the study (change from baseline in PANSS total score between the placebo group and the KarXT group at Visit 9/Week 5) showed a statistically signific ant decrease in 
PANSS total score (p <0.0001). The statistically significant difference in change from baseline 
between the treatment groups was there at Visit 6/Week 2 (p <0.0001) and continued to 
Visit 8/Week 4 and Visit 9/Week 5. Overall, the decrease f rom baseline in PANSS total score for 
the KarXT group was statistically significantly greater compared to the placebo group by 
treatment group for Visits 6, 8, and 9 (p <0.0001).

The overall safety/tolerability data were also fairly unambiguous; among the highlights:  
• The overall discontinuation rate on KarXT was 20%, similar to placebo (21%). The 
number of discontinuations due to TEAEs was equal in the KarXT and placebo arms 
(N = 2 in each group) 
• The dose escalation rate on KarXT was high and similar to placebo : 
o 91% of KarXT subjects escalated to 125/30 KarXT ( vs 97% on placebo) 
o 4% percent de-escalated back to 100/20 KarXT dose (vs 1% on placebo)  
• The overall TEAE rate on KarXT was 54% vs 43% on placebo: 
o The m ost common TEAE s were constipation, nausea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, and 
vomiting. None of these TEAEs were sever e and none led to discont inuations 
o One SAE  occurred in the study (the subject was on KarXT): the subject discontinued 
treatment and subsequently sought hospital care for worsening psychosis, meeting the 
regulatory definition of an SAE   
o No syncope or mean changes in BP were seen

• KarXT did not show evidence of many of the kinds of AEs that often occur in currently 
available APDs for the treatment of schizophrenia  
• The rates of the f ollowing AEs were similar for KarXT and placebo: somnolence, weight 
gain, and EPS  
• Overall, the KAR -004 study results confirm and extend the antipsychotic benefit of 
xanomeline observed in past studies of xanomeline alone and the well -tolerated nature of 
KarXT. KAR-004 results support the continued development of KarXT into Phase 3 trials. 
KAR-007 and KAR -009 had similar study designs and were modelled from the first pivot al 
study, KAR-004. Both KAR-007 and KAR- 009 were  Phase 3 , randomized, double- blind , 
placebo -controlled trials to assess the efficacy, safety,  and tolerability of KarXT in adults with 
DSM -5 schizophrenia, hospitalized with acute psychosis. Both KAR-007 and KAR-009 were 
ident ical, except KAR -007 enrolled subjects in the US only whereas KAR-009 enrolled subjects 
in Ukraine and the US. The primary objective of the studies was  to assess the efficacy of KarXT 
(125/30 BID) vs placebo in reducing PANSS total scores in adult inpatien ts with a DSM -5 
diagnosis of schizophrenia. Subjects aged 18 to 65 years old received either KarXT or placebo 
(1:1 ratio) for a treatment period of 5 weeks.  
Both pivotal, Phase 3 studies met their primary endpoint. The primary endpoint in KAR-007 and KAR-009 was the change from baseline (CFB) in PANSS total score at week 5. In each of the 
studies,  treatment with KarXT led to statistically significant improvements in PANSS total score 
at Week 5 compared with placebo (p < 0.0001 in each study). Cohen’s d effe ct size was 0.61 in 
KAR-007 and 0.60 in KAR-009. 
Secondary endpoints were analyzed based on a planned hierarchy in a fixed sequence and  were 
typically in favor of KarXT. Treatment  with KarXT led to  statistically significant improvements 
relative to placebo  in PANSS positive score at Week 5 in both studies ( p < 0.0001 in each study). 
In KAR-007, the improvements in PANSS negative and PANSS Marder factor negative 
subscales were statistically significant in favor of KarXT versus placebo at Week 5  (p ≤ 0.0055 
and p = 0.0022, respectively).  In KAR -009, the improvements in PANSS negative and PANSS 
Marder factor negative score at Week 5 was greater in KarXT than placebo but did not reach statistical signifi cance at the 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05 (p  = 0.1224 and p = 0.1957, 
respectively).  Analysis of the CFB in CGI -S in both studies demonstrated improvements in CGI-
S scores at Week 5 in favor of KarXT versus placebo  (statistically significant over placebo  for 
KAR-007, and nominally significant over placebo albeit not formally tested in KAR-009). KAR-
007 and KAR- 009 included a Week 5 PANSS responder analysis as a secondary efficacy

Page 37 of 104 endpoint (defined as an improvement from baseline of at least 30% at Week 5 in PANSS total 
score). The PANSS responder analysis showed that a greater proportion of subjects on KarXT 
achieved ≥ 30% improvement in PANSS total score at Week 5 compared to those on placebo in 
both KAR-007 (54.8% versus 28.3%, p < 0.0001) and KAR-009 (50.6% versus 25.3%, p = 0.0056). 
KarXT was well -tolerated and safe in the Phase 3 studies, with the pattern and course of safety 
findings largely consistent with the known safety profile of KarXT. The most common TEAEs 
were associated with the procho linergic or anticholinergic effects of KarXT . The administration 
of KarXT was notably free of many common side effects associated with currently approved 
antipsychotic drugs. 
KAR-008 is an ongoing Phase 3, multicenter, outpatient, open label extension ( OLE ) study 
designed to evaluate the long- term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of KarXT in adults with 
DSM -5 schizophrenia, which includes subjects who completed KAR-007 or KAR-009. Eligible 
subjects receive KarXT for up to 52 weeks. Enrollment in this stud y is complete (N=156).  
5.3 Clinical Risks/Benefits of KarXT and Study Rationale  
The risks and benefits of KarXT in humans are not fully known. KarXT is a fixed dose 
combination of xanomeline and trospium.  
The available clinical trial data indicate that KarXT has robust efficacy and a favorable safety 
profile that appears unique compa red to all available APDs. Most of these  clinical data were 
generated by subjects who were either “institutionalized” or studied in an “inpatient” hospital setting. Treatment with KarXT is not associated with weight gain, sedation, or meaningful EPS 
changes. In contrast, these serious side effects pose a significant risk with other APD treatments for schizophrenia and can lead to discontinuation of treatment and significant morbidity. A 
Phase 2 registration quality pivotal trial in 182 subjects met the primary endpoint with the 
PANSS total score showing a 11.6 point mean improvement compared to placebo with a highly 
significant (p  < 0.0001) separation from placebo ( -17.4 KarXT vs -5.9 placebo) at Week 5. 
KarXT, as compared to placebo, demonstrated highly sig nificant reduction in PANSS total 
scores (p  < 0.0001) at all postrandomization time points (Weeks 2, 4, and, 5) with a calculated 
effects size (Cohen’s d) of 0.75. KarXT, as compared to placebo, demonstrated significant improvement at all postrandomization  time points for PANSS positive symptom subscores, 
PANSS negative symptom subscores, PANSS Marder Factor negative symptom subscores, and CGI-S scores.  
 
 
 These early clinical studies, as well as nonclinical pharmacology and 
toxicology studies, have not revealed any specific contraindications to the use of xanomeline. The most common side effects/symptoms are the cholinergic -related effects: nausea, vomiting, 
excess salivation, excess sweating, and diarrhea. In addition, subjects treated with xanomeline alone have reported both syncope and orthostatic dizziness. The addition of trospium decreases

Page 38 of 104 the peripheral cholinergic effect of xanomeline creating a better tolerated therapy. In addition, a 
titration phase also increases the tolerability of KarXT.  
Trospium chloride has been marketed in the U nited S tates for 1 9 years. The most frequently 
reported AEs reported in pivotal trials were dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, headache, 
urinary retention, and abnormal vision and accommodation. For additional information, the 
package insert for trospium ch loride tablets for oral use can be found in the IB.  
Findings from one P hase 2 (KAR-004) and two Phase 3 (KAR-007 and KAR-009) pivota l 
placebo -controlled  studies were similar. In all three clinical  studies, a dministration of KarXT  
(100/20 and 125/30)  for 5 weeks resulted in consistent, significant reductions in symptoms of 
schizophrenia in subjects with acute psychosis and CGI -S compared with placebo. T he safety 
and tolerability of KarXT was consistent in 3 successive pivotal placebo-controlled studies (KAR-004, KAR-007 and KAR-009). The most common treatment- emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) by preferred term in the KarXT treatment arm included nausea , dyspepsia, vomiting, 
constipation, headache, hypertension, diarrhea, and insomnia. KarXT was generally well  
tolerated and found to be safe in this patient population. KarXT represents a novel approach to the treatment of patients with schizophrenia that will provide an important and meaningful 
alternative to current therapies.  
KAR-008 is an ongoing Phase 3, multicenter, outpatient, OLE study designed to evaluate the long- term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of KarXT in adults with DSM -5 schizophrenia, which 
includes subjects who completed KAR-007 or KAR-009.  
In the current study, all subjects will receive KarXT for a period of approximately 52 weeks with 
the primary objective of assessing the long- term safety and tolerability profile of KarXT  in an 
outpatient setting . All subjects wi ll start with a  lead -in dose of KarXT 50/ 20 (50 mg 
xanomeline/20 mg trospium chloride) BID for Day s 1 to 2 and then the dose will be titrated to 
100/20 BID for Days 3 to 7, allowing the subject to adjust to K arXT  before receiving a higher 
dose of 125/30 BID starting on Visit 3 (Day  8), unless the subject is continuing to experience 
AEs from the previous dose increase of KarXT 100/20 BID. All subjects who are increased to 
KarXT 125/30 BID, depending on tolerability, will have the option to return to KarXT 100/20 
BID.  
 
Dosing will occur every 12± 4.5 hours each day, during waking hours. KarXT  should be dosed on 
an empty stomach : ie, at least 1 hour before a meal or 2 to 3 hours after a meal.  
The current study is designed to demonstrate that long- term treatment with KarXT in adult 
subjects with schizophrenia is  safe and tolerable .

7.1 Description of Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a Phase 3 , multicenter, 52week , outpatient, open- label  study to evaluat e the long -term 
safety , tolerability , and efficacy  of KarXT in de novo subjects, defined as not previously 
participated in a study of KarXT, who meet DSM -5 criteria for schizophrenia. The study consists 
of a screening phase of up to 14 days (up to a 7-day screening extension is permitted with 
medical monitor approval), a baseline phase of up to 5 days, a 52- week open -label  treatment 
phase, and a 7-day safety follow -up/end of study (EOS)  visit following the last dose of KarXT 
for subjects who complete the treatment phase and those who prematurely discontinue from the 
study. 
Screening Phase: 
A suitable number of subjects will be screened to enroll approximately 600 subjects (aged 18 to 
65 years)  with schizophrenia who are psychiatrically stable and can be adequately managed in an 
outpatient setting across approximately 60 study sites in the United States . The screening phase 
will last up to 14 days (up to a 7- day screening extension is permitted w ith medical monitor 
approval). 
Baseline Phase: 
Subjects who meet the screening criteria will participate in a baseline period consisting of two 
separate visits. The start of the baseline period, Baseline Visit A, must be at least 3 days (and no 
more than 5 days) prior to Baseline Visit B. Subjects must continue to meet eligibility criteria 
throughout the baseline period to remain in the study.  
Treatment Phase: 
In this open -label study, all subjects will receive KarXT for up to 52 weeks. A ll subjects will 
start on a lead -in dose of KarXT 50/20 (50 mg xanomeline/20 mg trospium chloride ) BID for the 
first 2  days (Days 1 and 2), followed by KarXT 100/20 BID for the remainder of Week 1 (Days 3 
to 7). At Visit 3 (Day 8), dosing will be titrated upwards to Ka rXT 125/30 BID unless the subject 
is continuing to experience AEs from the previous dose of KarXT 100/20 BID. All subjects who are increased to KarXT 125/30 BID, depending on tolerability, will have the option to return to 
KarXT 100/20 BID.  
 Additional changes to KarXT dosing (eg, 
temporary d ose reductions) may be permitted as clinically indicated upon approval by the 
medical monitor.  
Interim visits, which can be conducted in- clinic or by telemedicine  per investigator discretion , 
will occur between required in -clinic visits (see Schedule of Assessments Table  2). Additional 
Unscheduled study visits should be utilized as necessary to facilitate subject retention and ensure compliance with study objectives.

Page 45 of 104 7.2 Discussion of Study Design  
The KarXT clinical development program includes this open -label  study to evaluate the 
long- term safety , tolerability , and efficacy  data for KarXT in  de novo subjects, defined as those 
who did not have prior exposure to  KarXT, who meet the DSM- 5 criteria fo r schizophrenia. 
The dosing plan for this study has been established and follows the earlier studies. All eligible 
subjects will receive the same lead -in doses of KarXT (KarXT 50/20 BID). Dosing will be 
titrated to 100/20 BID on Visit 2 (Day 3 ) and further titrated to 125/30 BID on Visit 3 (Day 8 ), 
unless the subject continues to experience AE (s) from the previous dose increase of KarXT .  
During the study, all subjects who are  increased to the highest dose of KarXT, depending on 
tolerability, will have the option to return to the next lower dose of KarXT (100/20 BID). 
 
 
Interim visits, which can be conducted in- clinic or by telemedicine per investigator discretion, 
will occur between required in -clinic visits (see Schedule of Assessments Table  2). Additional 
Unscheduled study visits should be utilized as necessary to facilitate subject retention and ensure 
compliance with study objectives.  
A 52-week treatment phase is considered to be sufficient to demonstrate the long -term safety and 
tolerability of KarXT. A sample size of approximately 600 subjects is also determined to be an 
appropriate number of evaluable subjects to assess the long- term safety of KarXT administration. 
Section 5.2 details the nonclinical and clinical background information available on KarXT, 
including dose rationale.  
7.3 End of Study  
A subject  will have fulfilled the requirements for study completion if/when the  subject  has 
completed the study treatment, including the EOS visit or the last scheduled visit as indicated in 
the Schedule of Assessments (Table  2) in accordance with the protocol. 
7.4 Independent Safety Monitoring Committee  
For the purpose of this study, the ISMC is an independent group of individuals with pertinent 
expertise that reviews on a regular basis accumulating safety and tolerability data from the 
clinical study. . This committee 
will be responsible, on a periodic basis, for confirming the safety and tolerability of KarXT 
throughout the study, with particular focus on assessing for any new or long- term toxicities that 
might be involved with KarXT.  
The reviews will allow a comparison of event rates and detection of safety signals , and  to 
identify important safety information. The ISMC charter will contain the details of the types of

Page 50 of 104 8.4 Study Withdrawal, Removal, and Replacement of Subjects  
If a subject  discontinues study treatment and is withdrawn from the study for any reason, the 
study site must immediately notify the medical monitor. The date and the reason for study 
discontinuation must be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF ). Subjects who 
complete or discontinue early (after receiving at least 1 dose of the study drug) from the study 
will be asked to return to the study site within 7 (±3) days of the EOT or ET visit  to complete 
EOS assessments as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2). 
In the event that a subject discontinues prematurely from the study because of a TEAE or serious 
TEAE, the TEAE or serious TEAE will be followed up until it resolves (returns to normal or baseline values) or stabilizes, or until it is judged by the investigator to no longer be clini cally 
significant.  
Once a subject is withdrawn from the study, the subject may not re -enter the study.  
A subject  may voluntarily withdraw or be withdrawn from the study at any time for reasons 
including, but not limited to, the following: 
• progressive disease  
• unacceptable toxicity or AE  
• subject withdrawal of consent: at any time, a subject ’s participation in the study may be 
terminate d at his/her request  or on the basis of investigator’s clinical judgement; the 
reason for subject withdrawal will be noted on the eCRF  
• intercurrent illness:  a condition, injury, or disease unrelated to the primary diagnosis that 
became apparent during treatment and necessitated the subject ’s termination from the 
study 
• general or specific changes in the subject's condition that renders them  ineligible for 
further treatment according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria  (eg, subject has need for a 
medication prohibited by the protocol) 
• subject fails to adhere to the protocol requirements (eg, drug noncompliance [if a subject 
is off KarXT  for > 7 consecutive days])  
• violation of entry criteria (ie, enrolled subjects who are later discovered not to meet 
eligibility criteria ) 
• development of suicidal or assaultive behavior 
• alcohol abuse or illegal drug use 
• pregnancy, as indicated in Section 11.7.8.  
• Sponsor’s decision to discontinue study

Page 51 of 104 Subject s who withdraw  from the study will be encouraged to complete the same final evaluations 
as subjects completing the study according to this protocol, particularly safety evaluations. The 
aim is to record data in the same way as for subject s who completed the study. 
Reasonable efforts will be made to contact subject s who are lost to follow -up. A subject will be 
considered lost to follow-up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and is 
unable to be contacted by the study center. These efforts must be documented in the subject’s 
file. Subjects with AEs ongoing at EOS  will be followed until the AE is resolved or the subject is 
considered to be in stable condition. 
The Sponsor has the right to terminate the study at any time in case of SAEs or if special 
circumstances concerning KarXT  become known, making further treatment of subjects 
impossible. In this event, the investigator(s) will be informed of the reason for study termination. 
 Pregnancy  
No evidence of mutagenicity, or treatment effects on reproduction, fertility, or fetal parameters 
have been demonstrated in animals following administration of xanomeline, but there are no 
adequate and well -controlled studies in pregnant women (FDA Pregnancy Category B). Animal 
reproduction studies of trospium chloride have shown an adverse effect on the fetus, but potential benefits may warrant the use of the drug in pregnant women despite the risk (FDA 
Pregnancy Category C). 
Therefore, WOCBP in this study must be willing to use a highly effective method of birth 
control (see APPENDIX  1 for a list of acceptable highly effective methods of contraception) 
during the study and for 30 days after the last dose of KarXT . WOCBP  will have a urine  
pregnancy test at Screening,  Baselin e Visit B  (Day 0) and thereafter, as designated at other 
scheduled visits ( Table  2). In case of positive urine pregnancy test result, a serum sample should 
be sent to the central laboratory to confirm the result.  
Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of KarXT on the developing 
human fetus are unknown with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.  
Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment 
of the mother with KarXT, women who become pregnant must discontinue KarXT immediately . 
The effects of KarXT  on sperm are unknown. M ale subjects whose sexual partners are WOCBP 
must agree to use a highly effective method of birth control (see APPENDIX  1 for a list of 
acceptable highly effective methods of contracept ion) and must not impregnate a sexual partner 
during treatment with or for 30 days after the last dose of KarXT . They must also agree to refrain 
from sperm donation for 30 days after the last dose of KarXT . 
WOCBP  will be instructed that known or suspected pregnancy occurring during the study should 
be confirmed and reported to the investigator. If a female subject  becomes pregnant, the 
investigator must withdraw her from the study without delay. The subject must not receive any 
further doses of KarXT . The investigator must notify the Sponsor or their  designee of any female

those procedures that would not expose the pregnant female patient to undue risk will be 
performed. See Section  11.7.8 for further reporting and monitoring details.  
Full details of the pregnancy will be recorded on the withdrawal page (exit form) of the eCRF, or a Pregnancy Reporting Form will be completed if the subject has completed the study. 
Notification of the pregnancy should be submitted via the Pregnancy Reporting Form within 24 hours of knowledge of the pregnancy. Pregnancy is not to be considered an AE; however, it 
must be reported using the same procedure as described for reporting SAEs (Section 11.7.4). 
8.5 Completion of the Study or Lost to Follow -up 
The study will be completed when all subjects have completed their study- related procedures in 
accordance with the protocol.  
Every reasonable eff ort will be made to contact subject s who are lost to follow -up to obtain EOS  
information. Details regarding follow -up efforts are to  be documented in the subject’s medical 
records/source documentation. 
8.6 Study Termination  
The availability of any new adverse safety information related to KarXT may result in stopping 
the study. An investigator, Sponsor, or Institutional Review Board (IRB) may take such actions. 
If the study is terminated for safety reasons, subjects will be notified immediately and assured 
that appropriate treatment and follow -up will be available. If an investigator terminates the study, 
the Sponsor, subject s, and IRB will be informed about the reason for such action. Similarly, if 
the Sponsor terminates the study, it will inform the investigat ors, the IRB, and the subject s of the 
reason for such an action. Similar notifications will be sent by the IRB if it takes such an action.

9.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Study Treatment  Assignment  
 Method of Study Treatment Assignment  
At screening, the interactive web response system (IWRS) will assign a unique subject 
identification number to the subject known as the Subject Number. This number will be 
associated with the subject throughout the study. Every subject who signs an ICF must be 
entered into the IWRS regardless of eligibility in order to obtain a Subject Number. This 9- digit 
number will consist of a 3 -digit study code and a 3- digit site identification , followed by a 3- digit 
number assigned sequentially within each site, starting at . 
 Blinding  
This is an open -label study; therefore, blinding is not applicable. 
9.4 Dosage Modification 
Subject s will self-administer KarXT  as described in Section  7.1 and in accordance with the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2). The KarXT  doses were selected based on the previous 
preclinical and clinical studies (see Section 5.2). Per the protocol, subject s will be evaluated for 
dose adjustments starting at Visit 3 through the remainder of the treatment period  (see 
Section  9.1.1).  
Additional changes to KarXT dosing (eg, temporary dose reductions) may be permitted as clinically indicated upon approval by the medical monitor.

atment Accountability and Compliance  
The pharmacist or other designated individual will maintain records of study treatment delivered 
to the study site, the inventory at the study site, the distribution to each subject , and the return of 
materials to the Sponsor or designee for storage or disposal. These records should include dates, 
quantities, batch/serial numbers, expiration dates, temperature log, and unique code numbers 
assigned to the product and study subjects.  
Administration of KarXT  will be supervised by study site personnel (during in- clinic visits) and 
 monitor administration of KarXT in between clinic visits  to ensure 
compliance . KarXT will be dispensed in prepackaged blister card w allets. 
The titration wallet will contain 10 days of dosing with 2  days of 50/20 KarXT BID and 8 days 
of 100/20 KarXT BID. After titration, subjects will receive 1 or more wallets each  containing 8 
days of BID doses of 125/30 or 100/20 KarXT based on the investigator -confirmed dose. 
Subjects will be advised to return the blister card wallets  to the site staff at each in-clinic visit for 
drug accountability. 
Investigators will maintain records that adequately document that the subject s were provided 
with the correct study treatment supply and reconcile the usage of the study drug. Investigational 
product will not be destroyed or returned to the Sponsor or designee until accountability has been 
fully monitored  through the end of the study. KarXT  accountability will be assessed periodically

a. At Visit 2/Day 3, and beginning again on Visit 10/Day 98 and every 4 weeks thereafter, interim visits will be completed between the required in- clinic 
visits. Interim visits will be conducted by site staff and can be completed using telemedicine (audio only, or audio + video)  or in-c linic, per investigator 
discretion.  
b. This procedure may be completed at either Baseline Visit A or Baseline Visit B.  
c. A urine pregnancy test for WOCBP should be performed at scheduled visits. In case of positive urine pregnancy test result, a serum sample sh ould be sent 
to central laboratory for confirmation of the result.  
d. A National Institute on Drug Abuse -5 (NIDA -5) urine drug screen (cannabinoids or marijuana, phencyclidine, amphetamines, opiates, and cocaine) and test 
for alcohol (breathalyzer or urine alcohol level) will be performed locally at scheduled visits. A sample should be sent to the central lab at screening. 
Thereafter, if positive, with the exception of cannabinoids or marijuana, a sample should be sent to the central laboratory f or confirmation of the result.  
e. Height is recorded at screening only.  
f. A complete physical examination includes body temperature (°C), general appearance, head/eyes/ears/nose/throat (HEENT), exami nation of thorax and 
abdomen, assessment of cardiac, musculoskeletal, and circulatory systems, palpations for lymphadenopathy, and limited neurological examination.  
g. A targeted physical examination includes at a minimum body temperature, a check of general appearance, as well as examination  of organ systems that are 
relevant to th e investigator based on review of the subject’s reported AEs, review of systems, or concomitant medication use. These also include symptom -
driven physical examinations, which will be performed as clinically indicated at any study visit.  
h. AEs as reported by subjects or observed by clinical staff and occurs after dosing. For interim visits, spontaneous AEs will be collected by tele medicine.  
i. For interim visits, concomitant medications will be collected by telemedicine.  
j. Vital signs measurements should be taken at scheduled in -clinic visits, while the subject is supine and standing after 2 minutes. Includes systolic and 
diastolic BP and is to be taken in the same arm for the duration of the study. During clinic visits, orthostatic vital signs should occur 2 (±1) hours after 
morning dosing whenever possible.  
k. ECG should be obtained within 1 to 2 hours after the morning dose and before blood withdrawal for any safety laboratory tests  whenever possible. During 
the ECG, ventricular rate (bpm), PR (msec), QRS (msec), Q T (msec), and QTcF (msec) measurements should be obtained.  
l. Refer to Section  11.6 for individual laboratory tests. For urinalysis, a urine dipstick will be performed locally. In the event of abnormalities, the sample will 
be sent to the central laboratory for full microscopic urinalysis.  
m. All subjects must have the following viral serolog y tests completed at Screening: anti- HCV antibody, HBV surface antigen, HBV core antibody, HIV- 1 
antibody, and HIV- 2 antibody. If the subject tests positive for anti- HCV antibody, then HCV RNA via polymerase chain reaction should be performed to 
confirm or  rule out active infection.  
n. Functional constipation inquiry: At specified visit, subjects will be asked whether they have experienced constipation (per t he ROME III criteria and Bristol 
Stool Form Scale; see  APPENDIX 2 ) since the last visit and if yes, whether the constipation required intervention. If the subject answers yes, sites are 
instructed to ask subjects to provide event date and ensure the event is documented as an AE and treatment is documented as c oncomitant medication.  
o. PK blood samples will be collected on Days 8, 14, 84, 168, and 280. On Day 8 the PK sample should be drawn within 1 to 2 hour s post- dose whenever 
possible. Note: In cases of dose reduction, re -escalation, or re- titration, an additional PK sam ple may be collected per investigator discretion in consultation

symptoms, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation of KarXT, SAS , BARS , AIMS , body 
weight, BMI , waist circumference, orthostatic vital signs , 12-lead ECG, IPSS,  clinical laboratory 
assessments [ hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis, and drug screen], physical 
examination , and C- SSRS) will be performed at protocol- specified - visits,  as specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table  2).  
11.1 Demographics, Medical History, and Psychiatric History  
Demographic data will be collected for all subjects at screening. The information to be captured 
includes date of birth (alternatively year of birth if full date of birth is not allowed to be collected 
for legal reasons), age, sex, race and ethnicity, which will be obtained from the subject and 
recorded in the eCRF.  
Medical, psychiatric , and medication  history will be recorded at screening. Investigators should 
document the occurrence, signs, and symptoms of the subject’s preexisting conditions, including 
all baseline symptoms, ongoing illnesses, other chronic conditions, and surgical history at 
screening. Medical history will also include history of drug, substance, or alcohol 
abuse/dependence within 1 year before Screening.  
Illnesses first occurring or detected during the study and/or worsening of a concomitant illness during the study are to be documented as AEs on the eCRF in accordance with Section 11.7. All 
changes not present at the time of consent  or described in the past medical history and identified 
as clinically significant  must be recorded as AEs.  
11.2 Vital Signs  
Orthostatic v ital signs (systolic and diastolic BP and heart rate measurements) will be evaluated 
at the in-clinic visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2). All vital signs will be 
measured supine and standing after 2 minutes. BP measurements are to be taken in the same arm for the duration of the study. During treatment orthostatic vital signs should occur 2 (±1) hours 
after morning dosing , whenever possible. 
Vital sign measurements will be repeated if clinically significant or machine/equipment errors occur. Out- of-range BP, or heart rate measurements will be repeated at the investigator’s 
discretion. Any confirmed, clinically significant vital sign measurements must be recorded as AEs.

examinations will be performed by a physician  or qualified designee. 
A targeted physical examination includes at a minimum body temperature, a check of general 
appearance, as well as examination of organ systems that are relevant to the investigator based 
on review of the subject’s reported AEs, review of systems, or concomit ant medication use. 
These also include symptom -driven physical examinations which will be performed as clinically 
indicated at any study visit. 
11.4 Weight, Height, Body Mass Index, and Waist Circumference 
Height (screening only), weight, and waist circumference measurements will be obtained at visits 
as specified in Table  2. BMI  should be calculated at these visits. All findings should be recorded 
in the eCRF.  
11.5 Electrocardiograms  
A 12 -lead, resting ECG should be obtained whenever possible within 1 to 2 hours post morning 
dose at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table  2). ECG at all scheduled visits 
should be performed before blood withdrawal for any safety laboratory tests and/or PK analysis 
whenever possible. 
ECGs will be transmitted electronically to a central reader at the central reading facility for 
determination of ventricular rate (bpm), PR (msec), QRS (msec), QT (msec), QTcF  (msec) 
measurements, and any other results. An assessment of normal or abnormal will be recorded; if 
the ECG is considered abnormal, the abnormality will be documented in the eCRF. ECGs will be 
repeated if clinically significant abnormalities are observed or artifacts are present.  
At screening, the investigator will examine the ECG traces for signs of cardiac disease that could exclude the subject from the study. An assessment of normal or abnormal will be recorded; if the 
ECG is considered abnormal, the abnormality will be documented in the eCRF. ECGs will be 
repeated if clinically significant abnormalities are observed or artifacts are present.

schedule d time points as per Table  2.  
A minimum volume of 10 mL  of urine will be obtained to perform urinalysis  (if abnormalities 
observed on dipstick)  and urine drug screen at scheduled time points as per Table  2.  
Blood and urine samples (microscopic analysis, when indicated) will be analyzed at a central laboratory facility. Urine samples will first be analyzed at investigator site by dipstick. If the 
results of the dipstick indicates abnormalit ies to be further investigated , the sample will be sent 
to the central laboratory and a microscopic analysis will be performed . All laboratory reports 
must be reviewed, signed, and dated by the investigator. A legible copy of all reports must be filed in the medical record (source document) for that visit. Any laboratory test result considered 
by the investigator to be clinically significant should be considered an AE (clinically significant AEs include those that require an intervention). Clinically significant abnormal values occurring 
during the study will be followed up until repeat test results return to normal, stabilize, or are no 
longer clinically significant.  
All the study subjects will be closely monitored for the drug-induced liver toxicity (detailed in  
Section 11.7.5), during the study. 
Other Laboratory Assessments : 
• A National Institute on Drug Abuse-5 ( NIDA-5) urine drug screen (cannabinoids or 
marijuana, phencyclidine, amphetamines, opiates, and cocaine) will be performed using a 
dipstick at the scheduled visits.  A sample should be sent to the central lab at screening. 
Thereafter, if positive, with the exception of cannabinoids or marijuana, a sample should be 
sent to the central laboratory for confirmation of the result. 
• Alcohol testing will be  performed using a breathalyzer or urine  alcohol test.

 Adverse Events  
An AE is any symptom, physical sign, syndrome, or disease that either emerges during the study 
or, if present at the time of consent , worsens during the study, regardless of the suspected cause 
of the event. All medical and psychiatric conditions (except those related to the indication under study) present at the time of consent will be documented in the medical history eCRF. Changes 
in these conditions and new symptoms, physical signs, syndromes, or diseases should be noted in the AE eCRF during the rest of the study. Clinically significant vital signs and laboratory 
abnormalities should also be recorded as AEs. Surgical procedures that were planned before the subject enrolled in the study are not considered AEs if the conditions were known before study 
inclusion; the medical condition should be reported in the subject’s medical history.  
In accordance with the protocol, t he investigator and/or study staff will elicit AEs and 
intercurrent illness during and at the end of the study period and these will be recorded in the 
appropriate page of the eCRF. AEs will be elicited by asking the subject a nonleading question, 
for exam ple, “Have you experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked?” The 
eCRF will be completed at the end of the study as soon as the results of the final lab tests are available.  
Each AE is to be documented i n the e CRF with reference to date of o nset, duration, frequency, 
severity, relationship to KarXT , action taken with KarXT , treatment of event, and outcome. 
Furthermore, each AE is to be classified as being serious or nonserious. Changes in AEs and resolution dates are to be documented in the e CRF.  
For the purposes of this study, the period of observation for collection of AEs extends from the time of consent until EOS . Follow-up of the AE, even after the date of therapy discontinuation, is 
required if the AE persists until the event resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the 
investigator.  
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the event should be noted. If the intensity category changes over a number of days, 
then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates). 
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (NCI CTCAE) , version 5.0 (Grades 1 through 5). 
Specific guidelines for classifying AEs by intensity and relationship to KarXT  are given in 
Table  4 and Table  5.

Page 75 of 104 Table  4. Classification of Adverse Events by Intensity  
MILD : An event that is easily tolerated by the subject , causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with 
everyday activities.  
MODERATE : An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities.  
SEVERE: An event that prevents normal everyday activities.  
 
Table  5. Classification of Adverse Events by Relationship to KarXT  
UNRELATED : This category applies to those AEs that are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous 
causes (disease, environment, etc).  
UNLIKELY : This category applies to those AEs that are judg ed to be unrelated to the test drug but for which 
no extraneous cause may be found. An AE may be considered unlikely to be related to KarXT  if or when it 
meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the test drug; (2) it could readily have been produced by the subject’s  clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; (3) it does not follow a known pattern of 
response to the test drug; or (4) it does not reappear or worsen when the drug is readministered.  
POSSIBLY : This category applies to those AEs for which a connection with the test drug administration 
appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty. An AE may be considered possibly related if or when it meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; (2) it could n ot readily have been produced by the subject’s  clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; or (3) it follows a known pattern of response to the test 
drug. 
PROBABLY : This category applies to those  AEs that the investigator feels with a high degree of certainty are 
related to the test drug. An AE may be considered probably related if or when it meets 3 of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of th e drug; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s  clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or 
reduction in dose (note that there are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet drug -relatedness clearly exists; for example, as in bone marrow depression, fixed drug eruptions, or 
tardive dyskinesia); or (4) it follows a known p attern of response to the test drug. 
DEFINITELY : This category applies to those AEs that the investigator feels are incontrovertibly related to test 
drug. An AE may be assigned an attribution of definitely related if or when it meets all of the following  
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s  clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or 
reduction in dose and recurs with re -exposure to drug (if rechallenge occurs); and (4) it follows a known 
pattern of response to the test drug.

 Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, 
that: 
• results in death,  
• is life -threatening, 
• results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  (however, 
hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing non-worsening condition is not 
considered an SAE ; the details of such hospitalizations must be recorded in the medical 
history or physical examination page of the eCRF), 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, and/or  
• is a congenital anomaly /birth defect. 
Other important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospitalization, based upon appropriate medical judgment, are considered SAEs if they are thought to jeopardize the subject and/or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of 
the outcomes defining an SAE. SAEs are critically important for the identification of significant safety problems; therefore, it is important to take into account both the investigator’s and the 
Sponsor’s assessment. If either the Sponsor or the investigator believes that an event is serious, 
the event must be considered serious and evaluated by the Sponsor for expedited reporting. 
 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
An SAE occurring from the time of informed consent  until EOS  must be reported to the Catalyst 
Clinical Research Pharmacovigilance group and will be communicated to the Sponsor. Any such 
SAE due to any cause, whether or not related to KarXT , must be reported within 24 hours of 
occurrence or when the investigator becomes aware of the event . Notification can be made 
using email.  
Catalyst Clinical Research Pharmacovigilance email address : Safety@catalystcr.com  
The event must be recorded in the standard AE eCRF. Preliminary reports of SAEs must be 
followed up by detailed descriptions later on, including clear and anonymized photocopies of 
hospital case reports,  consultant reports, autopsy reports, and other documents when requested 
and applicable. SAE reports must be made whether or not the investigator considers the event to be related to the investigational drug.  
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken t o treat the SAE, and the response should be 
recorded. Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed as needed in order to 
determine the etiology of the problem. The investigator must report all additional follow -up 
evaluations to the Cat alyst Clinical Research Pharmacovigilance group within 24 hours of

followed up until the investigator and Sponsor agree the event is satisfactorily resolved.  
Any SAE that is not resolved by the end of the study or upon discontinuation of the subject’s 
participation in the study is to be followed up until it either resolves, stabilizes, returns to 
baseline values (if a baseline value is available), or is shown to not be attributable to KarXT  or 
procedures.

 Trial Discontinuation Criteria Other than DILI and Pregnancy  
11.7.6.1 Individual Stopping Criteria  
Based on NCI CTCAE v5.0, study drug will be discontinued in any subject who has a ≥ Grade 4 
AE. Discontinuation or reduction in the dosage of the study drug for Grade 3 AEs other than 
DILI AEs (see Section 11.7.5) will be at the discretion of the investigator.  
11.7.6.2 Trial Stopping Rules  
The safety and tolerability aspects of KarXT will be overseen by an ISMC. The ISMC will meet periodically and review the unblinded data and will be responsible for advising the sponsor on 
ways to safeguard the interests of the clinical study  subjects. The committee is expected to 
recommend sponsor whether to:  
a. Continue the clinical study without modification; or  
b. Continue the clinical study with modification (listing the specific modifications recommended); or 
c. Terminate the study.

 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
AEs that meet all of the following criteria will be classified as suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (SUSARs) and reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities in accordance 
with applicable re gulatory requirements for expedited reporting:  
• serious 
• unexpected (ie, the event is not consistent with the safety information in the IB  or 
package insert of generic trospium ) 
• there is at least a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the 
event and the study treatment 
The investigator will assess whether an event is causally related to study treatment. The Sponsor 
(or Syneos Health) will consider the investigator’s assessment and determine whether the event 
meets the criteria for being reportable as a 7 -day or 15- day safety report. SUSARs that are fatal 
or life -threatening must be reported to the regulatory authorities and the Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC)/IRBs (where required) within 7 days after the Sponsor (o r Syneos Health) has 
first knowledge of them, with a follow -up report submitted within a further 8 calendar days. 
Other SUSARs must be reported to the relevant regulatory authorities and the IEC/IRBs within 
15 calendar days after the Sponsor (or Syneos Hea lth) first has knowledge of them.  
The Sponsor (or Syneos Health) is responsible for reporting SUSARs and any other events required to be reported in an expedited manner to the regulatory authorities and for informing 
investigators of reportable events, in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements within 
specific timeframes. Investigators will notify the relevant IEC/IRBs of reportable events within 
the applicable timeframes.  
Warnings and Precautions  
Risk of Urinary Retention : 
Trospium chloride tablets should be administered with caution to subjects with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. 
Angioedema: 
Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with trospium chloride, the 
active ingredient in trospium chloride tablets. In one case, angioedema occurred after the first 
dose of trospium chloride. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be 
life--threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, trospium chloride 
should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided.

Page 80 of 104 Trospium should be administered with caution to subjects with GI obstructive disorders because 
of the risk of gastric retention. Trospium chloride, like other antimuscarinic agents, may decrease 
GI motility and should be used with caution in subjects with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, 
intestinal atony, and myasthenia gravis.  
Controlled Narrow -angle Glaucoma: 
In subjects being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma, trospium chloride should only be used if 
the potential benefits outweigh the risks and in that circumstance only, with careful monitoring.  
Central Nervous System Effects : 
Trospium chloride is associated with anticholinergic CNS effects. A variety of CNS 
anticholinergic effects have been reported, including dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, and 
somnolence. Subjects should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly 
after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise subjects not to drive or operate heavy 
machinery until they know how trospium chloride affects them. If a subject experiences 
anticholinergic CNS effects,  dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 
Anticholinergic Adverse Reactions in Subjects with Moderate Renal Impairment : 
Trospium is substantially excreted by the kidney. The effects of moderate renal impairment on 
systemic exposure are not known but systemic exposure is likely increased. Therefore, 
anticholinergic adverse reactions (including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, and urinary retention) are expected to be greater in subjects with moderate renal 
impairment.  
Elevation of liver enzymes: 
Elevated liver enzymes have been reported in previous studies of xanomeline alone in AD 
patients. It is notable, however, that the hepatic enzyme elevations were not observed in the 
Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers and that the LFT elevations observed in the Phase 2 
schizophrenia study (KAR- 004) with KarXT (a combination of xanomeline and trospium) were 
quite limited in contrast to the effects observed with xanomeline in the elderly Alzheimer’s population. Moreover, even in the AD patients who experienced more hepatic enzyme 
elevations, the data demonstrate reversibility even with continued xanomeline treatment in those 
patien ts where there was sufficient follow -up data. Importantly, there were no Hy’s law cases or 
elevations in total bilirubin to a value of >2  × upper limit of reference range in either the 
xanomeline or KarXT datasets.  
 Pregnancy  
WOCBP  must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and Baseline Visit B (Day 0).  
The investigator must notify the Sponsor (or designee) of any female subject or female partner of 
a male subject that becomes pregnant while participating in the study. Any known cases of 
pregnancy will be reported until the subject completes or withdraws from the study.

Page 81 of 104 The pregnancy will be reported immediately by faxing/emailing a completed pregnancy report to 
the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. The pregnancy will not be 
processed as an SAE; however, the investigator will follow -up with the subject until completion 
of the pregnancy and must assess the outcome in the shortest possible time, but not more than 30 days after completion of the pregnancy.  
If a female subject becomes pregnant, the investigator must withdraw her from the study without 
delay. The subject must not receive any further doses of KarXT. Upon discontinuation from the 
study, only those procedures that would not expose the sub ject to undue risk will be performed. 
If the female subject or the female partner of the male subject is willing and able to consent to pregnancy follow -up, she will be followed until her pregnancy reaches term. Information 
regarding the pregnancy must onl y be submitted after obtaining written consent from the 
pregnant partner. The investigator will arrange counseling for the pregnant partner by a specialist 
to discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. 
The investigator should notify the Sponsor (or designee) of the pregnancy outcome by 
submitting a follow -up pregnancy report. If the outcome of the pregnancy involved spontaneous 
or therapeutic abortion (any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented), stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly, the investigator will report the 
event by faxing/emailing a completed pregnancy report form to the Sponsor (or designee) within 
24 hours of knowledge of the event. This event is considered a s an SAE.  
The investigator should also be notified of pregnancy occurring during the study but confirmed after completion of the study. In the event that a subject is subsequently found to be pregnant 
after inclusion in the study, any pregnancy will be followed to term, and the status of mother and 
child will be reported to the Sponsor after delivery. 
 Overdose  
The investigator must immediately notify the Sponsor of any occurrence of overdose with 
KarXT  (total daily dose greater than 250/60 mg). 
Signs and symptoms of overdose may vary considerably. They are usually manifested by 
increasing GI stimulation with epigastric distress, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and vomiting, 
excessive salivation, pallor, cold sweating, urinary urgency, blurring of vision, and eventually 
fasciculation and paralysis of voluntary muscles. Miosis, increases or decreases in BP with or 
without bradycardia, and severe anxiety and panic may occur. 
Supportive treatment should be used as indicated (artificial respiration, mainten ance of airway, 
oxygen, etc). Epinephrine 0.1 to 1.0 mg subcutaneous may be of value in overcoming severe 
cardiovascular  or bronchoconstrictor responses.  
AEs associated with overdoses should be reported in the eCRF.

Page 82 of 104 11.8 Simpson- Angus Rating Scale  
The SAS is an  established instrument to measure drug -related extrapyramidal syndromes. It is a 
10-item testing instrument used to assess gait, arm dropping, shoulder shaking, elbow rigidity, 
wrist rigidity, leg pendulousness, head dropping, glabella tap, tremor, and sa livation. The range 
of scores is from 0 to 40 with increased scores indicating increased severity.  
11.9 Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale  
The B ARS  is a rating scale used to assess the severity of drug -induced akathisia, or restlessness, 
involuntary movements and i nability to sit still. The range of scores is 0 to 14, with higher scores 
indicating greater severity.[23] 
11.10 Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale 
The AIM S is a rating scale that is used to measure involuntary movements known as tardive 
dyskinesia, which can sometimes develop as a side effect of long -term treatment with 
antipsychotic medications. It is a 12 -item scale to assess orofacial, extremity, and truncal 
movements as well as the overall severity, incapacitation, and the subject’s level of awareness of 
the movements. Items are scored from 0 (none) to 4 (severe). A higher score indicates more 
severe dyskinesia.  
11.11 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C-SSRS is a tool designed to systematically assess and track suicidal AEs (suicidal behavior 
and suicidal ideation) throughout the study.[ 24] The strength of this suicide classification system 
is in its ability to comprehensively identify suicidal events while limiting the over- identification 
of suicidal behavior. The scale takes approximately 5 minutes to administer. The C -SSRS will be 
administered  by a trained rater at the site.  
This study will utilize 2  versions of the C- SSRS. At the screening visit, the baseline/screening 
version will be completed; for all subsequent visits the “Since Last Visit” version of the C -SSRS 
will be administered.  
11.12 Functi onal Constipation Inquiry  
Constipation refers to bowel movements that are infrequent or hard to pass.[25] The stool is 
often hard and dry.[ 26] Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, and feeling as if 
one has not completely passed the bowel movement.[ 27] The normal frequency of bowel 
movements in adults is between 3 per day and 3 per week.[ 25] Constipation will be defined per 
the Rome III criteria, as less than 3 bowel movements per week, APPENDIX 2 .[28] 
The Bristol Stool Form Scale has been correlated with a change in intestinal function, and has 
been shown to be a useful tool in clinical practice and research.[ 29] A sample Bristol Stool Form 
Scale is located in APPENDIX  2.

Page 83 of 104 As a measure of anticholinergic effects, at all in -clinic visits , subjects will be asked whether they 
have experienced constipation per the ROME III criteria since the last visit, and if yes, whe ther 
the constipation required intervention. If the subject answers yes, sites are instructed to ask 
subjects to provide event date and ensure event is documented as an AE and treatment is 
documented as concomitant medication. Subjects will not be required to collect and present their 
stool sample, nor will clinic staff be required to corroborate the subject assessment.  
Additional attention can be given to other complaints as well including: straining with bowel movements, excessive time needed to pass a bo wel movement, hard stools, pain with bowel 
movements secondary to straining, abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, and the sensation of incomplete bowel evacuation.[ 27, 30 ] 
Treatment of constipation depends on the underlying cause and the duration that it has been present. For the purposes of constipation complaints during a clinical trial, the use of laxatives of 
a bulk forming agent, osmotic agent, stool softener, or lubricant type may be used. 
As definitions of constipation are typically based on a history of at least a week, site physician 
discretion will be allowed for initiation of such treatments.  
11.13 International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)  
The Internal Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) is administered by a clinician  [38]. The IPSS is 
based on the answers to seven questions concerning urinary symptoms and one question 
concerning quality of life. Each question concerning urinary symptoms allows the patient to 
choose one out of six answers indicating  increasin g severity of the particular symptom. The 
answers are assigned points from 0 (not at all) to 5 (almost always). The total score can therefore 
range from 0 to 35 (asymptomatic to very symptomatic)[ 39]. 
The questions assess following urinary symptoms: (1) Incomplete emptying, (2) f requency , (3) 
intermittency , (4) urgency, (5) weak stream , (6) strainin g and (7) Nocturia. 
Question 8 of the IPSS refers to the patient’s perceived quality of life. The score on question 8 is 
not included in the total score calculation.  
If a subject has an IPSS score of 5 (almost always) on items 1, 3, 5, or 6, OR a sum of scores on IPSS items 1 , 3, 5, and 6 of ≥ 9 during the treatment period, the subject should be referred to a 
urologist. The urologist, in collaboration with the study Investigator and the medical  monitor, 
should determine whether the subject should be discontinued from study tre atment and/or the 
study. Study drug should be temporarily interrupted until the subject is seen by the urologist.

Page 84 of 104 12 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
The Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2) outlines the efficacy assessments to be performed 
throughout the study and their timing. 
12.1 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 
The PANSS is a clinician -administered scale used for measuring symptom severity of subjects 
with schizophrenia and is widely used in the study of antipsychotic therapy.[ 31] The PANSS 
rating form contains 7 positive  symptom scales, 7  negative system scales, and 16 general 
psychopathology symptom scales. Subjects are rated from 1 to 7 on each symptom scale. The 
positive symptoms in schizophrenia are the excess or distortion of normal function such as 
hallucinations, delusions, grandiosity, and hostility, and the negative symptoms in schizophrenia 
are the diminution or loss of normal functions. It takes approximately 45 to 50 minutes to 
administer. PANSS total score is the sum of all scales  with a minimum score of 30 and a 
maximum score of 210.  
It is recommended, if at all possible, that the PANSS assessment should be performed before all 
the other scheduled assessments for all visits at which it is performed , except during screening 
when the MINI should be conducted fi rst. 
12.2 Clinical Global Impression -Severity  
The CGI -S is a rating scale, completed independently by a clinician that is used to measure 
illness and symptom severity in subjects with mental disorders. It is used to rate the severity of a 
subject’s illness at the time of assessment. The CGI -S modified asks the clinician 1 question: 
“Considering your total clinical experience, how mentally ill is the subject at this time?”  The 
clinician’s answer is rated on the following 7 -point scale: 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2  = borderline 
mentally ill; 3  = mildly ill; 4  = moderately ill; 5  = markedly ill; 6  = severely ill; 7  = among the 
most extremely ill subjects.[32] 
This rating is based upon observed and reported symptoms, behavior, and function in the past 
7 days. As symptoms and behavior can fluctuate over a week, the score should reflect the 
average severity level across the 7  days.

13.1 Pharmacokinetic Sampling  
 Blood Samples  
On Days 8, 14, 84, 168, and 280, a single sample will be collected during the subject’s regularly 
scheduled study visit (see Table 2 ).  On Day 8 the PK sample should be drawn within 1 to 2 
hours post- dose whenever possible.  
Approximately 4 mL of blood will be collected at each scheduled time point. The actual date and 
time of each blood sample collect ion will be recorded.   
A single PK sample may  be drawn if a relevant/significant  AE is reported  or if there is a dose 
adjustment . For ET that is related to an AE, collection of PK blood sample at the ET visit is 
recommended.   
Details of PK blood sample collection, processing, storage, and shipping procedures will be 
provided in a separate laboratory manual.  
13.2 Bioanalysis of Trospium and Xanomeline 
The plasma concentration of trospium and xanomeline in PK samples will be measured  using a 
validated bio analytical method. Details of the method validation and sample analysis will be 
included with the final clinical study report.

An SAP will be prepared  after the protocol is approved. This document will provide further 
details regarding the definition of analysis variables and analysis methodology to address all 
study objectives. The SAP will serve as a compl ement to the protocol and supersedes it in cas e of 
differences.  
The statistical evaluation will be performed using Statistical Analysis System  ® software  version 
9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All data will be listed, and summary tables will be provided. Summary statistics will be presented by dose group.  
Descriptive statistics will be used to provide an overview of the safety and efficacy results. For 
continuous parameters, descriptive statistics will include n, mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum, and maximum. For categoric al parameters, the number and percentage of subjects in 
each category will be presented. The denominator for percentages will be based on the number of 
subjects appropriate for the purposes of analysis. No statistical hypothesis testing will be 
performed. 
15.1 Determination of Sample Size 
No formal sample size calculations were done. A sample size of up to 600 was deemed sufficient 
to provide 6- and 12-month safety data on subjects exposed to KarXT. 15.2 Analysis Populations  
Enrolled population: All subjects who have given informed consent for KAR -011 will be 
included in the Enrolled population.  
Safety population : All subjects who recei ve at least 1 dose of KarXT during the current study 
will be included in the safety population and will be used in the safety analysis. mITT population : All subjects who are enrolled, received at least 1 dose of KarXT during the 
current study, have a valid PANSS assessment at baseline, and at least 1 postbaseline time point 
will be included in the mITT population and will be used in the efficacy analysis. PK population: All subjects who have received at least 1 dose of KarXT and have at least 1

Orthostatic vital signs, clinical laboratory data, , ECG parameters, and physical 
examinations will be summarized using descriptive statistics, including observed and change 
from baseline values, as well as numbers of subjects with  values outside limits of the normal 
range at each time point . Similar descriptive summaries will be provided for C -SSRS, SAS, 
BARS, AIMS, IPSS,  body weight, BMI, and waist circumference. 
15.4 Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy analyses will be summarized based on the mITT population. The summaries described 
in this section will provide data on maintenance of effect of open -label KarXT over 52 weeks. 
Tabular presentations will display descriptive statistics for b aseline and change from baseline 
study results by schedule d visit.  
Responder efficacy variables (PANSS responders) will be summarized descriptively.  
Continuous efficacy variables based on the change from baseline (PANSS, CGI- S) will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics by scheduled visit. Tabular presentat ions will display 
descriptive statistics for the baseline and change from baseline results by scheduled visit. Figures 
for selected variables will also be generated in order to demonstrate the kinetics of response over time.  
15.5 Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
The PK  evaluation will rely on an existing population PK model for KarXT in subjects with 
schizophrenia. The plasma concentrations of xanomeline and trospium measured in this study 
will be overlaid onto distributions of concentrations predicted  by the population PK model  
developed from KAR -007 and KAR-009 data . Percentages of measured concentrations in the 
current study that lie within, above, and below the 90% prediction  interval of concentrations 
predicted by the model will be calculated.   
Details of the PK an alysis will be described in the SAP .

16.1 Approval and Consent  
 Regulatory Guidelines  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the accepted version of the Declaration of 
Helsinki and/or all relevant regulations, as set forth in Parts 50, 56, 312, Subpart D, of Title 21 of 
the US  Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), in compliance with I nternational Council for 
Harmonisation (ICH) and Good C linical Practice (GCP) guidelines, and all applicable local, state 
and federal government regulations and laws.  
 Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
Conduct of the study must be approved by an appropriately constituted IEC/IRB. Approval is required for the study protocol, protocol amendments (if applicable), IB, ICFs, recruitment 
material and subject information sheets , and other subject facing material.  
 Informed Consent  
For each stud y subject, written informed consent will be obtained before any protocol- related 
activities. As part of this procedure, the PI or designee must explain orally and in writing the 
nature of the study, its purpose, procedures, expected duration, alternative therapy available, and the benefits and risks involved in study participation. The subject should be informed that they 
may withdraw from the study at any time, and the subject will receive all information that is 
required by local regulations and guidelines for ICH. The PI  will provide the Sponsor or its 
representative with a copy of the IEC -/IRB -approved ICF before the start of the study. 
The ICF should be revised whenever there are substantial changes to procedures or when new 
information becomes availabl e that may affect the willingness of the subject to participate. 
Revisions to the consent form required during the study must be approved by the Sponsor and 
IEC/IRB, and a copy of the revised consent form is provided to the Sponsor. For any updated or 
revised consent forms, the subjects must be re -consented for continued participation in the study. 
A pregnant partner consent form should be obtained before collecting any data from a female 
pregnant partner of a male subject, if she becomes pregnant during the course of the study or 
within 7 days of the last dose of KarXT . 
Subject Registry : 
Clinical trial registries, such as clinical trial subject (CTS) database ( CTS database) and Verified 
Clinical Trials (VCT), seek to reduce duplicate enrollment by identifying potential protocol 
violations and duplicate subjects before randomization. At the time of providing the informed consent for the study, the investigator or designee will explain the IRB-approved Subject 
Database Authorization to the subject and witness the signature.

Page 94 of 104 At the beginning of screening visit, following consent execution and subject number assignment 
and before other study procedures , site staff that have received training and login information 
access (www. subjectregistry .com ) to the database will enter the subject study ID number and 
authorized subject identifi ers. Two reports, one from CTS and one from VCT, detailing any 
potential protocol violations or dual enrollment attempts will be generate d and should be printed 
for source documentation. The report will detail each protocol violation detected and specific 
washout period dates where applicable.   
Throughout the study, tracking of actively enrolled subjects will continue based on updates by 
coordinators in the interactive response system. At the last subject contact, CTS database and 
VCT  staff will automatically close out the subject  (safety follow -up, ET, or completer) based on 
IWRS . 
16.2 Data Handling  
Any data to be recorded directly in the eCRFs (to be considered as source data) will be identified at the start of the study. Data reported in the eCRF that are derived from source documents 
should be consistent with the source documents, or the discrepancies must be explained. See also Section 16.3 .  
Clinical data will be entered by site personnel in eCRFs for transmission to the Sponsor. Data in 
eCRFs transmitted via the web -based data system must correspond to and be supported by source 
documentation maintained at the study site, unless the study site makes direct data entry to the 
databases for which no other original or source documentation is maintained. In such cases, the 
study site should document which eCRFs are subject to direct data entry and should have in 
place procedures to obt ain and retain copies of the information submitted by direct data entry. 
All study forms and records transmitted to the Sponsor must only include coded identifiers such 
that directly identifying personal information is not transmitted. The primary method o f data 
transmittal is via the secure, internet -based electronic data capture (EDC) system maintained by 
Syneos Health. Access to the EDC system is available to only authorized users via the study’s 
secure internet website, where a user unique assigned user name and password are required for 
access.  
Any changes made to data after collection will be made through the use of the EDC system. 
eCRFs will be considered complete when all missing and/or incorrect data have been resolved. 
16.3 Source Documents  
Source docume nts are considered to be all information in original records and certified copies of 
original records of clinical findings, observations, data, or other activities in a clinical study 
necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study. The invest igator will provide direct 
access to source documents and/or source data in the facilitation of trial -related monitoring, 
audits, review by IECs/IRBs, and regulatory inspections.

records that include all pertinent observations on each of the site’s trial subjects. Source data 
should be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete. Changes to source data should be traceable, not obscure t he original entry, and be explained if necessary.  
Data recorded on source documents will be transcribed into eCRFs. Copies of completed eCRFs 
will be provided to the Sponsor and the sites at the end of the study. The completed eCRFs will 
be retained by the investigator.  
16.4 Record Retention  
Study records and source documents must be preserved for at least 15 years after the completion or discontinuation of/withdrawal from the study, at least 2 years after the drug being studied has 
received its last approval fo r sale, or at least 2 years after the drug development has stopped, and 
in accordance with the applicable local privacy laws, whichever is the longer time period.  
The investigator agrees to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and 
regulations relating to the privacy of subject health information, including, but not limited to, the 
Standards for Individually Identifiable Health Information, 45 CFR, Parts 160 and 164 (the HIPAA of 1996 Privacy Regulation). The investigator shall ensure that study subjects authorize 
the use and disclosure of protected health information in accordance with HIPAA Privacy 
Regulation and in a form satisfactory to the Sponsor. 
16.5 Monitoring  
The study will be monitored according to the KAR-011 monitoring plan to ens ure that it is 
conducted and documented properly according to the protocol, GCP, and all applicable 
regulatory requirements. 
Monitoring visits  may include  on-site or remote visits and may also utilize periodic telephone 
contacts. The investigators will assure them and adequate site personnel are available throughout 
the study to collaborate with clinical monitors. Clinical monitors must have direct access to 
source documentation in order to check the completeness, clarity, and consistency of the data 
recorded in the eCRFs for each subject.  
The investigator will make available to the clinical monitor all source documents and medical records necessary to review protocol adherence and eCRFs. In addition, the investi gator will 
work closely with the clinical monitor and, as needed, provide them appropriate evidence that the study is being conducted in accordance with the protocol, applicable regulations, and GCP 
guidelines. 
16.6 Quality Control and Quality Assurance

independent of and separate from the routine monitoring and quality control functions. Quality assurance procedures will be performed at study sites and during data management to assure that 
safety and efficacy data are ad equate and well documented. 
16.7 Protocol Amendment and Protocol Deviation 
 Protocol Amendment  
Amendments to the protocol that entail corrections of typographical errors, clarifications of confusing wording, changes in study personnel, and minor modifications that have no effect on 
the safety of subjects or the conduct of the study will be classed as administrative amendments 
and will be submitted to the IEC/IRB for information only. Syneos Health  will ensure that 
acknowledgement is received and filed. Amendments that are classed as substantial amendments 
must be submitted to the appropriate regulatory authorities and the IECs/IRBs for approval and will not be implemented at sites until such approvals are received , other than in the case of an 
urgent safety measur e. 
 Protocol Deviations 
Should a protocol deviation occur, the Sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. Protocol 
deviations and/or violations and the reasons they occurred will be included in the clinical study 
report. Reporting of protocol deviations to the IEC/IRB and in accordance with applicable 
regulatory authority mandates is an investigator’s responsibility. 
• All protocol deviations will be tracked in the Clinical Trial Management System. 
Deviations considered major will be identified as such before study unblinding during 
medical monitor periodic review . 
Major protocol deviations will be tabulated including the frequency and percentage of subjects with each type of deviation by treatment group. 
16.8 Ethical Considerations  
This study will be conducted in accordance with this protocol, the accepted version of the 
Declaration of Helsinki and/or all relevant federal regulations, as set forth in Parts 50, 56, 312,

Page 102 of 104 APPENDIX 1. CONTRACEPTION GUIDELINES  
Female subjects of childbearing potential with a non -sterilized male sexual partner must agree to 
use at least 1 highly effective method of contraception (eg, hormonal or double barrier method of 
birth control, or intrauterine device) beginning >30 days before receiving study drug on Day 1 and continuing until 30 days after the last dose of study drug. If oral contraceptives are used, the 
subject must have been on a stable dose for ≥6 months. 
 
A woman of child -bearing potential (WOCBP) is any woman who has e xperienced menarche 
and is not yet postmenopausal unless she is permanently sterile (i.e. hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy). Women who have experienced menarche but are not yet postmenopausal, and who are permanently sterile by one of the methods described above are not required to undergo pregnancy testing at study visits, and it is not considered a protocol deviation to skip pregnancy testing for these individuals.  A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy.  
Highly effective methods of contraception are those which have a failure rate of <1% (when 
implemented consistently and correctly) and include: 
• combined (containing estrogen and progestogen) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (administration  may be ora l, intravaginal, or transdermal)  
• progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
(administration  may be o ral, injectable, or implantable ) 
• intrauterine device  
• intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
• bilateral tubal ligation or occlusion  
• vasectomy (provided that the male has a medical assessment of surgical success)  
• double barrier method consisting of a physical (e.g., condom, diaphragm) and c hemical 
barrier (e.g., spermicide)  
All subjects will be strongly advised that they (or the female partners of male subjects) should 
not become pregnant wh ile on study treatment or for 30 days after the last dose. A female  subject  
will be advised that she must report immediately to the study site for pregnancy testing and 
appropriate management in the event that she may be pregnant.

Section 5.2.2  Two randomized, double -blind, placebo -
controlled Phase 3 trials (KAR -007 and KAR -
009) are planned in which the subjects will be 
exposed to either KarXT or placebo (1:1) for a 
period of up to 5 weeks. Also, a Phase 3 open -
label, roll -over trial (KAR -008) is  planned in 
which the subjects rolled -over from KAR- 007 
and KAR -009 will be treated with KarXT for 
a period of up to 52 weeks in an outpatient 
setting.  
 KAR -007 and KAR -009 had similar study 
designs and were modelled from the first 
pivotal study, KAR -004. Both KAR -007 and 
KAR -009 were Phase 3, randomized, double -
blind, placebo -controlled trials to assess the 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability of KarXT in 
adults with DSM -5 schizophrenia, 
hospitalized with acute psychosis. Both KAR -
007 and KAR -009 were identical, except 
KAR -007 enrolled subjects in the US only 
whereas KAR -009 enrolled subjects in 
Ukraine and the US. The primary objective 
of the studies was t o assess the efficacy of 
KarXT (125/30 BID) vs placebo in reducing 
PANSS total scores in adult inpatients with a Added KAR -007

DSM -5 diagnosis of schizophrenia. Subjects 
aged 18 to 65 years old received either 
KarXT or placebo (1:1 ratio) for a treatment 
period of 5 weeks.  
Both pivotal, Phase 3 studies met their 
primary endpoint. The primary endpoint in 
KAR -007 and KAR -009 was the change from 
baseline (CFB) in PANSS total score at week 
5. In each of the studies, treatment with 
KarXT led to statistically significant 
improveme nts in PANSS total score at Week 
5 compared with placebo (p < 0.0001 in each 
study). Cohen’s d effect size was 0.61 in 
KAR -007 and 0.60 in KAR -009.  
Secondary endpoints were analyzed based on 
a planned hierarchy in a fixed sequence and 
were typically in favor of KarXT. Treatment 
with KarXT led to statistically significant 
improvements relative to placebo in PANSS 
positive score at Week 5 in both studie s (p < 
0.0001 in each study). In KAR -007, the 
improvements in PANSS negative and 
PANSS Marder factor negative subscales 
were statistically significant in favor of 
KarXT versus placebo at Week 5 (p ≤ 0.0055 
and p = 0.0022, respectively). In KAR -009, 
the imp rovements in PANSS negative and 
PANSS Marder factor negative score at 
Week 5 was greater in KarXT than placebo 
but did not reach statistical significance at the 
2-sided alpha level of 0.05 (p = 0.1224 and p = 
0.1957, respectively). Analysis of the CFB in 
CGI-S in both studies demonstrated 
improvements in CGI -S scores at Week 5 in

favor of KarXT versus placebo (statistically 
significant over placebo for KAR 007, and 
nominally significant over placebo albeit not 
formally tested in KAR -009). KAR -007 and 
KAR -009 included a Week 5 PANSS 
responder analysis as a secondary efficacy 
endpoin t (defined as an improvement from 
baseline of at least 30% at Week 5 in PANSS 
total score). The PANSS responder analysis 
showed that a greater proportion of subjects 
on KarXT achieved ≥ 30% improvement in 
PANSS total score at Week 5 compared to 
those on pl acebo in both KAR-007 (54.8% 
versus 28.3%, p < 0.0001) and KAR 009 
(50.6% versus 25.3%, p = 0.0056).  
KarXT was well -tolerated and safe in the 
Phase 3 studies, with the pattern and course 
of safety findings largely consistent with the 
known safety profile of KarXT. The most 
common TEAEs were associated with the 
procholinergic or anticholinergic effects of 
KarXT. The administration of KarXT was 
notably free of many common side effects 
associated with currently approved 
antipsychotic drugs.  
KAR -008 is an ongoing Phase 3, multicenter, 
outpatient, open label extension (OLE) study 
designed to evaluate the long -term safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of KarXT in adults 
with DSM -5 schizophrenia, which includes 
subjects who completed KAR -007 or KAR -
009. Eligible subjects receive KarXT for up to 
52 weeks. Enrollment in this study is

In a Phase 2 (KAR -004) clinical study, KarXT  
(100/20 and 125/30) significantly reduced the 
symptoms of schizophrenia in subjects with 
acute psychosis after treatment for 28  days. 
KarXT also showed an acceptable safety 
profile with the most common TEAEs being 
constipation, nausea, dry mouth, dyspepsi a, 
and vomiting. All the reported TEAEs were 
mild or moderate in intensity. One SAE 
(psychotic disorder) was reported by a single 
subject and no deaths were reported in the 
study. KarXT was generally well -tolerated and 
found to be safe in this patient popu lation.

Findings from one Phase 2 (KAR -004) and 
two Phase 3 (KAR -007 and KAR -009) pivotal 
placebo -controlled studies were similar. In all 
three clinical studies, administration of 
KarXT (100/20 and 125/30) for 5 weeks 
resulted in consistent, significant reductions  
in symptoms of schizophrenia in subjects 
with acute psychosis and CGI -S compared 
with placebo. The safety and tolerability of 
KarXT was consistent in 3 successive pivotal 
placebo -controlled studies (KAR-004, KAR -
007 and KAR -009). The most common 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
by preferred term in the KarXT treatment 
arm included nausea, dyspepsia, vomiting, 
constipation, headache, hypertension,

Section 11. 13  The Internal Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) is 
administered by a clinician [38].  The IPSS is 
based on the answers to seven questions 
concerning urinary symptoms and one question 
concerning quality of of life. Each question 
concerning urinary symptoms allows the patient 
to choose one out of six answers indicating 
increasing severity of the particular symptom. 
The answers are assigned points from 0 (not at all) 
to 5 (almost always). The total score can t herefore 
range from 0 to 35 (asymptomatic to very 
symptomatic) [39].  
The questions assess following urinary symptoms: 
(1) Incomplete emptying, (2) frequency, (3) 
intermittency, (4) urgency, (5) weak stream, (6) 
straining and (7) Nocturia.  
Question 8 of the IPSS refers to the patient’s 
perceived quality of life. The score on question 8 is 
not included in the total score calculation.

Appendix 1  A woman is considered to be WOCBP 
following menarche and until becoming 
postmenopausal, unless she is permanently 
sterile. Permanent sterilization methods 
include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, 
and bilateral oophorectomy [ 22]. Female 
subjects who are postmenopausal, which is 
defined as 12 consecutive months with no 
menses without an alternative medical cause, 
must have been postmenopausal for >1  year if 
they wish to not use contraceptives. 
Postmenopausal status must be confir med by a 
test of the subject’s follicle -stimulating 
hormone (FSH) level which must be elevated 
and consistent with postmenopausal levels (ie, 
>40 IU/L); otherwise, these subjects must 
agree to use contraceptives listed below. A woman of child -bearing potential (WOCBP) is 
any woman who has experienced menarche and is 
not yet postmenopausal unless she is permanently 
sterile (i.e. hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, 
bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral 
oophorectomy). Women wh o have experienced 
menarche but are not yet postmenopausal, and 
who are permanently sterile by one of the 
methods described above are not required to 
undergo pregnancy testing at study visits, and it is 
not considered a protocol deviation to skip 
pregnancy  testing for these individuals.  Updated language

Updat e
d Language to define “de novo” and extend screening period: 
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, 52 week, outpatient, open-label study to evaluate the long term safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of KarXT in de novo subjects, defined as not previously participated in a study 
of KarXT, who meet DSM-5 criteria for schizophrenia. The study consists of a screening phase of up to 
14 days (up to a 7-day screening extension is permitted with medical monitor approval), a baseline phase 
of up to 5 days, a 52-week open-label treatment phase, and a 7-day safety follow-up/end of study (EOS) 
visit following the last dose of KarXT for subjects who complete the treatment phase and those who 
prematurely discontinue from the study.  
Screening Phase: 
A suitable number of subjects will be screened to enroll approximately 400 subjects (aged 18 to 65 years) 
with schizophrenia who are psychiatrically stable and can be adequately managed in an outpatient setting 
across approximately 40 study sites in the United States. The screening phase will last up to 14 days (up 
to a 7-day screening extension is permitted with medical monitor approval) and will end upon the start of 
the study baseline phase.

schizophrenia. The plasma concentrations of xanomeline and trospium measured in this study will be 
overlaid onto distributions of concentrations predicted by the population PK model developed from KAR-
007 and KAR-009 data. Percentages of measured concentrations in the current study that lie within, 
above, and below the 90% prediction interval of concentrations predicted by the model will be calculated.  
Details of the PK analysis will be described in the SAP.   
APPENDIX 1. CONTRACEPTION GUIDELINES 
Updated language for clarity 
Female subjects of childbearing potential with a non-sterilized male sexual partner must agree to use at 
least 1 highly effective method of contraception (eg, hormonal or double barrier method of birth control, 
or intrauterine device) beginning >30 days before receiving study drug on Day 1 and continuing until 30 
days after the End of Study (EOS) Visit. If oral contraceptives are used, the subject must have been on a 
stable dose for >/= 6 months. 
A woman is considered to be WOCBP following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal, unless 
she is permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, 
and bilateral oophorectomy [22]. Female subjects who are postmenopausal, which is defined as 12 
consecutive months with no menses without an alternative medical cause, must have been 
postmenopausal for >1 year if they wish to not use contraceptives. Postmenopausal status must be 
confirmed by a test of the subject’s follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level which must be elevated and 
consistent with postmenopausal levels (ie, >40 IU/L); otherwise, these subjects must agree to use 
contraceptives listed below. Female subjects who are surgically sterile (ie, hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy) will not need to undergo the FSH level test.

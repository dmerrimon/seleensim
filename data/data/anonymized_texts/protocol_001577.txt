Study Title: A multicenter  phase I/II trial of vorinostat in combination with cyclophosphamide, 
etoposide, prednisone and rituximab for elderly patients with relapsed diffuse large B -cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL) 
 
Patient Population: Relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients ≥60 years of age and not candidates for autologous stem cell transplantation  
 Design: This is a phase I/II, open- label, single arm trial. The goals are to determine the optimal 
dose of vorinostat when given in combination to rituximab, cyclophosphamide, etoposide and prednisone. In addition, we hypothesize that this regimen will  increase the response rate and one -year progression free survival for elderly patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who are 
not candidates for autologous stem cell transplantation with the addition of a new chemotherapeutic agent, vorinostat, to rituximab, cyclophosphamide, etoposide and prednisone. As this is a palliative regimen, quality of life measurements will be another important endpoint.  
 
Rituximab 375 mg/m
2  intravenously day one. Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 intravenously days 
1 and 8, etoposide 70 mg/m2 day 1 intravenously, then 140 mg/m2 days 2 and 3 orally, vorinostat 
orally days 1-10 (see below), prednisone 60 mg/m2 days 1-10. The regimen will be repeated 
every 4 weeks for 6 cycles unless there is disease progression or intolerance of the regimen due to toxicity.  The starting dose of vorinostat will be 300 mg orally days 1-10. All other agents will be held constant at the above doses. Three patients will be enrolled at this dose. If 0/3 experience DLT then the dose will be increased to 400 mg orally days 1-10. If 1/3 patient experiences a DLT then 3 more patients will be added at the 300 mg dose. If ≥2 patients experience DLT at 300 mg, the trial will be discontinued because of excessive toxicity. If ≤1 out of 6 patients experience a DLT at 300 mg then we will escalate to 400 mg and follow the same scheme. If 2 or more experience a DLT at 400 mg and only 3 patients were treated at 300 mg, then we will de-escalate to 300 mg and 3 additional patients will be added. If ≤1 out of 6 patients experience a DLT at 400 mg, then 400 mg will be the MTD for the Phase II part of the study. DLT is defined as any grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicity or grade 4 thrombocytopenia seen in the first cycle of treatment.   FACT-Lym will be administered at baseline, on first da y of each treatment cycle and at all 
followup visits in first year of followup.

- 8 - 2.0 OBJECTIVES AND SCIENTIFIC AIMS  
Phase I: 
1. To determine the maximum tolerated  dose (MTD)  of vorinostat given orally for 10 
days in combination with cyclophosphamide, etoposide, prednisone and rituximab for elderly patients with relapsed diffuse large B -cell lymphoma  
Phase II: 
1. To determine the complete response rate to rituximab and a combination of vorinostat with cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and prednisone in elderly patients with relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who are not candidates for autologous stem cell transplantation. 
2. To determine the overall response rate (complete and partial).   
3. To estimate the one-year progression- free and overall survival  
4. To estimate the quality of life for these patients at baseline, during and at completion of 
treatment.  
 
3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Diffuse large B -cell lymphoma comprises 30 -40% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas in adults. The 
median age is in the seventh decade. Approximately 50% of newly-diagnosed patients ages 60 years and older will achieve durable un -maintained remissions following treatment with 
rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and prednisone (R- CHOP)
1. The standard 
treatment for relapsed and refractory patients is salvage chemotherapy and high -dose 
chemotherapy with peripheral stem c ell support. This results in durable remissions in 
approximately 30-40% of patients2. Some patients in their 60s and most patients above age 70 
are not candidates for this type of program. These patients are treated for palliation and not with the goal of durable remissions or cures. There are few clinical trials that have addressed the treatment of this population of patients for whom tolerance of treatment and quality of life during treatment are as important issues as tumor response. Effective treatment of this population can thus be considered an unmet need and an opportunity for clinical research. 
 A combination of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, procarbazine and prednisone (CEPP) is used by many clinicians for palliative treatment of relapsed DLBCL, although there is little published literature on its efficacy. An overall response rate of 77% (17/22) and CR rate of 36 % (8/22) was reported with CEPP in a small number of patients with recurrent diffuse large cell lymphoma
3.  
 
Remission durations with salvage chemotherapy alone without consolidation autologous stem cell transplantation for relapsed and refractory aggressive lymphomas have been short. The median time to progression following CEPP was 7 months
3. The median duration of response in 
a phase II trial in a similar patient population with a combination of pixantrone with 
cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone was 10.3 months4. The one-year progression- free 
survival of patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL treated w ith gemcitabine, cisplatin and

- 9 - methylprednisolone (GEM -P) was 27%. The addition of rituximab to combination chemotherapy 
may increase remission duration. The one-year progression- free survival of patients treated with 
GEM-P with rituximab was 51%. Only a mi nority of these patients received consolidation 
autologous stem cell transplants5. 
  
Vorinostat or suberorylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) was synthesized in the laboratory of Dr. 
Ronald Breslow at Columbia University and developed in the laboratory of Dr. Paul Marks at Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center. Vorinostat was approved by the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) on 6 -Oct-2006 for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations in patients 
with cutaneous T -cell lymphoma (CTCL) who have progressive, persistent or recurrent disease 
on or following two sys temic therapies. Phase I studies demonstrated a signal of activity of the 
drug in patients with relapsed/refractory non- Hodgkin lymphomas. The proto- oncogene BCL -6, 
which is constitutively expressed in many B -cell lymphomas, suppresses genes involved in the 
control of lymphocyte activation, differentiation and apoptosis. Promotion of acetylation of BCL-6 by vorinostat could result in inactivation of this suppressive effect and reactivation of 
genes involved with these desirable cellular activities in the tumor cells
6,7. A preclinical study 
demonstrated enhanced cell death with combination of vorinostat and etoposide in the MCF -7 
breast cancer cell line8.  
Convenience of drug dosing, tolerance of treatment and overall quality of life are important issues in the treatment of elderly patients with relapsed DLBCL. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Lymphoma (FACT -Lym) is an instrument that has been recently developed for 
assessment of quality of life in patients receiving chemotherapy for lymphoma and is now 
available for clinical chemotherapy trials
9. 
 In this study, vorinostat, the novel oral histone deacetylase inhibitor, will be substituted for procarbazine in the CEPP regimen. Procarbazine is associated with significant toxicity including 
carcinogenesis in animal and in humans in the MOPP combination, nausea and vomiting, pancytopenia, neurologic symptoms including neuropathy and confusion, hypersensitivity reactions and stomatitis. The toxicity of vorinostat is described in Section 11.1. Rituximab, an important agent with little toxicity will also be added.  Its toxicity is described in Section 11.3. 
 
Quality of Life Component  
 
Quality of life is an important consideration in the treatment of these patients with the most 
likely expectation of palliation  rather than  cure. With this goal, it is important that this regimen 
will be associated with reasonably mild side effects that will not severely affect comfort or 
ability to function . To measure quality of life in this study we will use the Functional Assessment 
of Cancer Therapy – Lymphoma (FACT -Lym) questionnaire. The FACT- Lym was developed as 
part of the FACIT Measurement System to meet the growing need for a disease-specific quality of life (QOL) questionnaire for patients with non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma
10 (www.facit.org).  .  The 
15-item Lymphoma subscale was constructed to complement the existing subscales of the 
FACT-G questionnaire11 . The FACT -Lym (FACT -G + lymphoma subscale) is formatted for

- 10 - self-administration and utilizes  a 5-point Likert rating scales (0= Not at all; 1= A little bit; 2=  
Somewhat; 3= Quite a bit; 4=  Very Much). Subscale scores are calculated by reversing 
negatively stated items and then summing individual item scores. A total score is derived by summing subscale scores. A Trial Outcome Index (TOI) can be calculated by summing the PWB, FWB, and Lymphoma subscale scores. The TOI is an efficient summary index of 
physical/functional outcomes and a common endpoint used in clinical trials because it is 
responsive to change in physical/functional outcomes, sometimes more than a total (overall) multidimensional aggregated score that  includes social and emotional well-being. 
 The FACT -Lymphoma was developed with input from experts and the literature. An extensive 
item-generation and scale construction process generated 176 candidate items from interviews 
and item ratings on frequency and relevancy from 17 expert healthcare providers and the published literature describing quality of life in NHL. Data summaries, including median NHL symptom relevancy ratings ≥ 2, disease- specificity, and clinical relevance were used to support 
retention of 22 items for testing. Cognitive debriefing with 75 NHL patients ensured content validity of the final scale 
9,12. 
 The 22-item subscale was validated on a sample of 84 NHL patients. Patients completed the 
FACT-Lym and other measures at baseline (T1), 3 -7 days (T2), and 8- 12 weeks (T3).   Item 
correlations, expert relevancy ratings, and patient input on content helped shorten the lymphoma subscale from 22 to 15 items. Patient interviews confirmed item relevance and comprehensiveness. The validation sample included 44% male, 60% with indolent disease, and 85% currently receiving treatment. Internal consistency coefficients (alpha) for the 15- item 
subscale (.79, .85, .84) and test- retest stability (.84) indicate good reliability at each assessment. 
Correlations between the subscale and the SF -36 physical (r=.62) and mental (r=.48) summary 
scores reflect concurrent validity. Responsive ness to ECOG performance status rating and 
treatment status (on vs. off) equaled or exceeded that of the more established FACT subscale scores. From T1 to T3, subscale scores declined ( -6.8, effect size= -0.87) in 14 patients who 
reported themselves as wor sened, increased (4.5, effect size= 0.58) in 35 patients who reported 
themselves as improved, and did not change (- 0.1, effect size= -0.01) in 21 patients who reported 
themselves as unchanged
9,12. These results support the validity of the lymphoma subscale and 
suggest that it will be a useful targeted endpoint in trials where lympho ma-specific concerns are 
paramount.  
Global Rating of Change Scale (adapted from Jaeschke et al, 1989):   
The global rating of change scale (GRC) is a patient -reported measure used as the criterion 
against which actual change scores could be compared and calibrated.  To align GRC ratings to 
the subscales of the FACT -Lym, each FACT dimension (PWB, SWB, EWB, FWB, the 
“additional concerns”, and total HRQL) was briefly summarized, and then patients rated whether they experienced no change, a worsening, or an im provement in that area.  If they experienced a 
worsening or improvement, they rated the degree of change on a 7 point scale ranging from –3 (a great deal worse) through 0 (no change) to +3 (a great deal better).  Patients will complete this at every first year visit other than baseline.

3.1.1 Histone deacetylases and HDAC Inhibitors  
 
Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are enzymes that catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from the 
lysine residues of proteins, including histones and transcription factors.  HDAC inhibitors can 
induce tumor cell growth arrest, differentiation, or apoptosis in vitro and inhibit tumo r growth in 
animals13,14.  The transcription of genes is regulated at least in part by acetylation of nucleosomal 
histones15.  The core nucleosomal histones are the most widely studied of the proteins that 
become acetylated following inhibition of HDAC activity15.  In some can cer cells, there is an 
over expression of HDACs, or an aberrant recruitment of HDACs to oncogenic transcription 
factors causing hypo acetylation of core nucleosomal histones.  Hypo acetylation of histones is 
associated with a condensed chromatin structure and repression of gene transcription.  Inhibition 
of HDAC activity allows for the accumulation of acetyl groups on the histone lysine residues 
resulting in an open chromatin structure and transcriptional activation.  
3.1.2  Mechanism of Action of Vorinostat  
Vorinostat is a potent inhibitor of HDAC activity and binds directly to the catalytic pocket of HDAC enzymes.  Vorinostat, at low nanomolar concentrations, inhibits the enzymatic activity of HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC3 (Class I) and HDAC6 (Class II)
14,16,17. Concentrations of 
vorinostat that cause the accumulation of acetylated histones also induces cell cycle arrest, differentiation or apoptosis of transformed cells
16. 
Vorinostat induces apoptosis in a wide variety of transformed cells in culture, including cutaneous T -cell lymphoma (CTCL) cell lines, circulating atypical T -cells derived from patients 
with CTCL, human lymphoma cell lines and murine erythroleukemia ( MEL) cells.  Vorinostat 
also inhibits proliferation of cultured transformed human cells derived from leukemias, non-small cell lung carcinomas, colon carcinomas, central nervous system tumors, melanomas, ovarian carcinomas, renal cell carcinomas, prostate and breast cancers.   In cultured human transformed cell lines, vorinostat has synergistic or additive activity in combination with other cancer therapies, includin g radiation, kinase inhibitors, cytotoxic  agents and differentiating 
agents
16,18-24 . 
In vivo, vorinostat demonstrates anti -neoplastic activity in a variety of rodent tumor models 
including xenograft models of human prostate, breast and colon carcinoma. 
While it has been assumed that the effects of vorinostat on histone  acetylation underpin its 
biological activities, a number of other proteins are regulated by histone acetyltransferases 
(HATs) and HDACs and may be targeted by vorinostat25. Several non -histone proteins, (e.g., 
tubulin, Hsp90 and p53) are known to be reversibly acetylated on lysine residues and undergo hyper acetylation  following exposure to vorinostat
26-28. Acetylation of these proteins may also 
contribute to the antitumor activity of vorinostat.

3.1.3 Non Clinical Pharmacology of Vorinostat 
 
Vorinostat is app roximately 71% bound to human plasma proteins over the range of 
concentrations of 0.5 to 50 µg/mL.  
Vorinostat has a low propensity to cause or be affected by drug- drug interactions.  In animal 
models and in vitro human systems, the major pathways of metabolism of vorinostat involve 
glucuronidation and hydrolysis followed by β- oxidation.  Additionally, the glucuronidation of 
vorinostat is mediated by multiple uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase isozymes (UGTs), making it less susceptible to drug interactions through modulation of UGTs. V orinostat 
is not recovered intact in urine to any appreciable extent.  Therefore, compounds known to affect renal elimination are not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of vorinostat.  
Vorinostat is not an inhibitor of CYP drug metabolizing enzymes in human liver microsomes at steady state C
max of the 400 mg dose (C max of 1.2 µM vs. IC 50 of  >75 µM). Gene expression 
studies in human hepatocytes detected some potential for suppression of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 activities by vorinostat at concentrations higher (≥ 10 µM) than pharmacologically relevant. 
Thus, vorinostat is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of other agents metabolized by CYP enzymes. As vorinostat is not eliminated via the CYP pathways, it is anticipated that vorinostat will not be subject to drug -drug interactions when co- administered with drugs that are 
known CYP inhibitors or inducers. However, no formal clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate drug interactions with vorinostat.   
Please refer to the vorinostat CIB for detailed information.  
3.1.4  Non Clinical Toxicology of Vorinostat 
 
Vorinostat has been investigated in non-clinical acute and oral repeated -dose toxicity studies, 
reproductive, developmental toxicity studies, and genetic toxicity studies to support oral 
administration of this compound to humans.  
The main toxicities observed in animal models were weight loss and inappe tence, apparent 
hemolytic anemia (rats only at 3.8 times the equivalent 400 mg human dose), leukopenia (rats 
only at 1.3 times the equivalent 400 mg human dose), thrombocytopenia (male rats only, statistically significant change at 0.5 times the equivalent 400 mg clinically effective human 
dose, but within normal range at all doses), and gastrointestinal tract irritation (dogs only, at 8.5 times the equivalent 400 mg human dose). Although statistically significant and dose -dependent, 
many of the clinical pathology findings were within normal historical ranges indicating that they should not have major toxicological consequences. The toxicities appeared to be rapidly reversible within 12 to 14 days. There has been no evidence of cardiac toxicity based on

creatinine kinase, organ weight, gross pathology, or histopathology assessments in studies up to one month duration. No serious, irreversible damage to any vital organ has been observed. Importantly, toxicities in rats and dogs were predictive of adverse effects in humans (anorexia, weight loss, fatigue). Toxicities present in animals would be manageable in the clinic, and the 
onset of serious toxicity is readily forecast by  prodromal symptoms. The non clinical toxicity 
profile of vorinostat is acceptable for an oncology drug. 
Vorinostat rapidly crossed the placenta in both the rat and rabbit, following administration of a 
dose of 15 mg/kg/day and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively (<1 times the human exposure based on 
AUC
0-24) and reached transplacental equilibrium within 30 minutes post-dose. 
Vorinostat was evaluated in a panel of genetic toxicity assays; in vivo and in vitro assays were found to be positive. No human safety data for the use of vorinos tat during pregnancy are 
available.  
Please refer to the vorinostat CIB for detailed information.  
3.1.5. Clinical Pharmacokinetics of Vorinostat  
 
The pharmacokinetics of vorinostat following 400- mg single -dose in a fasted state; and 4 00 mg 
single- and multiple-doses in a fed (high- fat meal) state were evaluated in 23 patients in a Phase I 
study with relapsed or refractory advanced cancer using a validated assay. See Table A.

 Vorinostat is eliminated predominantly through metabolism with less than 1% of the dose recovered as unchanged drug in urine, indicating that renal excretion does not play a role in the elimination of vorinostat. Recovery of two pharmacologically inactive metabolites, 
O-glucuronide of vorinostat (OG -V) and 4-anilino-4- oxobutanoic acid (4A4OA), in urine was 
more substantial.

3.1.6 Summary of Clinical Experience with Vorinostat  
Vorinostat has been  studied in Merck Research Labs (MRL) sponsored studies, Investigator 
Initiated Study Protocols (IISP) and National Cancer Institute (NCI) sponsored studies.  
Vorinostat has been orally administered in Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical studies in 
patients with advanced solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Vorinostat has been studied 
both alone and in combination with other chemotherapy agents.   
Please refer to the vorinostat CIB for detailed information  
3.1.7 Safety of Vorinostat   
The types of adverse experiences observed in clinical trials of vorinostat were those usually 
associated with chemotherapy.  The most common drug- related adverse experiences in patients 
treated with vorinostat could be classified into four symptom complexe s: gastrointestinal 
symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, anorexia, weight decrease, vomiting, and constipation ), 
constitutional symptoms (fatigue, chills), hematologic abnormalities (thrombocytopenia, anemia) 
and taste disorders (dysgeusia, dry mouth). Most of the adverse experiences were manageable. In 
fact, most of the very common adverse experiences were reversible and could be managed using 
conventional supportive care for chemotherapy. Overall, treatment with oral vorinostat was well 
tolerated. 

Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Protocol 
IRB#: 08- 045A(6) 
 
Amended: 12/13/11 
- 15 - Adverse experiences considered by the Investigators to be at least possibly related to vorinostat 
in ≥10 % of patients across all Merck & Co., Inc. sponsored vorinostat clinical studies include 
(in descending frequency): fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, blood creatinine 
increased, hyperglycemia, weight decreased, thrombocytopenia, dysgeusia, constipation, 
dehydration, hemoglobin decreased, platelet count decreased, anemia, hypocalcemia, alanine 
aminotransferase increased, white blood cell count decreased, dys pnea, hyponatremia, aspartate 
aminotransferase increased, hypokalemia, dry mouth, alopecia, and muscle spasms. 
The tolerability of vorinostat appears to be determined by total daily dose, frequency and the 
number of consecutive days of dosing.  The results  of an initial Phase I study of vorinostat in 
patients with advanced solid tumors and hematologic malignancies determined that the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for continuous daily dosing without a rest period is 400 mg 
daily (q.d.) or 200 mg twice daily (b.i.d.). The MTD for intermittent dosing has been established 
as 300 mg b.i.d. x 3 consecutive days per week, or 250 mg 3  times daily (t.i.d.) x 14 consecutive 
days followed by a 7- day rest period29.  Therefore, the maximum tolerable total daily dose may 
range as high as 750 mg (250 mg P.O. t.i.d.) x 14 consecutive days followed by a 7- day rest 
period rather than 400 mg (given as q.d. or 200 mg b.i.d.) with continuous daily dosing or 600 
mg when given as 300 mg b.i.d. for 3 consecutive days each week followed by a 4- day rest 
period. In a Phase I study in Japanese patients with solid tumors, MTD was established as 200 
mg b.i.d. and 500 mg q.d. for 14 consecutive days followed by a 7-day rest. 
Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) have been mainly non- hematologic.  The majority of these DLTs 
occurred within the first month on vorinostat.  At continuous daily dosing of 600 mg q.d., 300 
mg b.i.d., and 400 mg b.i.d., doses that exceeded the established MTD, the pa ttern and severity 
of DLTs were similar.  The DLTs were manageable because these toxicities resolved quickly 
after drug administration was interrupted. Hematologic events were primarily anemia, 
leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Generally, these events were  rapidly reversible after study 
drug interruption. 
Serious clinical adverse experiences (SAEs) regardless of causality have been reported in 
approximately 39% of the first 350 patients treated with vorinostat in Merck & Co., Inc. 
sponsored studies.  This overall high incidence may reflect the underlying conditions of patients 
in this group.  Of the patients who had a serious adverse experience, approximately 16% were 
considered by the Investigator to be related to study medication.  Serious laboratory adver se 
experiences were uncommon, occurring in 3% or fewer of patients in the various populations. By 
contrast, to patients with solid tumors, the incidence of serious adverse experiences was higher in 
patients with hematologic malignancies.  
Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis have been reported.   
QT prolongation has been observed.

4.0 OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
4.1 Design 
This is a phase I/II, open-label, single arm trial. The goals are to determine the optimal dose of 
vorinostat when given in combination to rituximab, cyclophosphamide, etoposide and 
prednisone. In addition, we hypothesize that this regimen will  increase the response rate and one 
-year progression free survival for elderly patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who are 
not candidates for autologous stem cell transplantation with the addition of a new 
chemotherapeutic agent, vorinostat, to rituximab, cyclophosphamide, etoposide and prednisone. As this is a palliative regimen, quality of life measurements will be another important endpoint.  
 
Rituximab 375 mg/m

1 and 8, etoposide 70 mg/m2 day 1 intravenously, then 140 mg/m2 days 2 and 3 orally, vorinostat 
orally days 1-10 (see below), prednisone 60 mg/m2 days 1-10. The regimen will be repeated 
every 4 weeks for 6 cycles unless there is disease progression or intolerance of the regimen due 
to toxicity.

 The starting dose of vorinostat will be 300 mg orally days 1-10. All other agents will be held constant at the above doses. Three patients will be enrolled at this dose. If 0/3 experience DLT then the dose will be increased to 400 mg orally days 1-10. If 1/3 patient experiences a DLT then 3 more patients will be added at the 300 mg dose. If ≥2 patients experience DLT at 300 mg, the trial will be discontinued because of excessive toxicity. If ≤1 out of 6 patients experience a DLT at 300 mg then we will escalate to 400 mg and follow the same scheme. If 2 or more experience a DLT at 400 mg and only 3 patients were treated at 300 mg, then we will de-escalate to 300 mg

- 17 - and 3 additional patients will be added. If ≤1 out of 6 patients experience a DLT at 400 mg, then 
400 mg will be the MTD for the Phase II part of the study. DLT is defined as any grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicity or grade 4 thrombocytopenia seen in the first cycle of treatment .  
Once the patient has been assigned a dose level, that dose will not change for that patient’s treatment on protocol. If another cohort is opened, new patients may be accrued to a new dose 
level. However, previous patients will remain at their assigned dose level. 
 Growth factor support will start on day 11  (+/- 2 days) with either peg -filgrastim or filgrastim for 
at least 5 days. On day 1 of each cycle, drugs will be held for at least 1 week if absolute neutrophil count <1000 /mm, platelet count < 50000/mm or for any other non-hematological grade 3 or 4 toxicity. On day 8 of each cycle, vorinostat will be discontinued and the cyclophosphamide dose held for 1 week if absolute neutrophil count <1000 /mm, platelet count < 50000/mm or for any other non-hematological grade 3 or 4 toxicity. The subsequent cycle will begin 3 weeks after the second cyclophosphamide dose. In the phase II portion, the following dose modifications will be permitted if patients require admission for fever and with or without documented infection in the previous cycle of chemotherapy: reduction of cyclophosphamide dose by 25% on days 1 and 8 and omission of oral etoposide in subsequent cycles.If delays greater than 1 week are required, the Principal Investigator should be notified. 
 
FACT-Lym will be administered at baseline, on first day of each treatment cycle and at all 
followup visits in first year of followup. 
 
Estimated duration of accrual:  
Three years  
4.2 Intervention  
Patients will be treated with 6 cycles of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, etopside, prednisone and vorinostat every 4 weeks. Quality of life determinations will be obtained at the beginning of each cycle of chemotherapy and at each visit during the first year of followup.

Phase I: 
The starting dose of vorinostat will be 300 mg orally days 1-10. All other agents will be held constant at the above doses. Three patients will be enrolled at this dose. If 0/3 experience DLT then the dose will be increased to 400 mg orally days 1-10. If 1/3 patient experiences a DLT then 3 more patients will be added at the 300 mg dose. If ≥ 2 patients experience DLT at 300 mg, the trial will be discontinued because of excessive toxicity. If ≤ 1 out of 6 patients experience a DLT at 300 mg then we will escalate to 400 mg and follow the same scheme. If 2 or more experience a DLT at 400 mg and only 3 patients were treated at 300 mg, then we will de-escalate to 300 mg and 3 additional patients will be added. If ≤1 out of 6 patients experience a DLT at 400 mg, then 
400 mg will be the MTD for the Phase II part of the study. DLT is defined as any grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicity or grade 4 thrombocytopenia seen in the first cycle of treatment.

In the phase II portion, the following dose modifications will be permitted if patients require admission for fever and with or without documented infection in the previous cycle of chemotherapy: reduction of cyclophosphamide dose by 25% on days 1 and 8 and omission of oral etoposide in subsequent cycles.  If de lays 
greater than 1 week are required, the Principal Investigator should be notified.  FACT-Lym will be administered at baseline and on first day of each treatment cycle and at all 
followup visits in first year of followup. The Patient Global Rating of Change will be administered at all assessments other than baseline, anchoring patient ratings to the previous visit in that first year.  
 
Adverse experiences will be graded and recorded throughout the study according to NCI -
CTCAE, version 3.0.  Toxicities will be characterized in terms including duration, intensity, and time to onset.  
9.1 Concomitant and Prohibited Medications/Treatments  
The major pathway(s) for metabolism of vorinostat involves glucuronidation and hydrolysis followed by β-oxidation. Therefore, it is anticipated that vorinostat will not be subject to drug-drug interactions when co-administered with drugs that are known to be CYP enzyme inhibitors.  Formal drug-drug interaction studies have not been performed with vorinostat.  All concomitant medications received within 14 days before the first dose of study medication and 30 days after the last dose of study medication must be recorded in the source document and on the case report form. 
The concomitant use of other medications/therapies is allowed unless specifically prohibited in the protocol.  Patients should be stabilized prior to study entry on all medications.   
• Prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) have 
been observed in patients receiving vorinostat concomitantly with coumarin -derivative 
anticoagulants. Physicians should carefully monitor PT and INR in patients concurrently 
administered vorinostat and coumarin derivatives.  
• Patients may not receive chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biological therapy or 
investigational anticancer therapy during the study. Patients who require these therapies should be considered to have progressive disease and be withdrawn from the study.

- 23 - • Vorinostat should not be administered concomit antly with other HDAC inhibitors (e.g., 
valproic acid) as class- specific adverse reactions may be additive.   
9.2 Diet 
Vorinostat should be taken approximately 30 minutes after a meal whenever possible. 
Altered taste and decreased food and liquid intake ar e associated with vorinostat 
administration.  These toxicities can be actively managed with fluid management and 
nutritional consult.   
During the period of vorinostat administration, patients should consume at least 2 liters of 
fluid orally, daily, to pre vent dehydration.  Patient may require electrolyte replacement.  
If  patients are experiencing dysgeusia, popsicles or Gatorade may be successful in 
maintaining oral intake.  Early use of anti -emetics should be encouraged. 
 
 9.3 Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Supportive treatment may include anti -emetics, antidiarrheal medications, anti -pyretics, 
anti-histamines, analgesics, antibiotics, and others, such as blood products.  Patients who 
experience indigestion or gastroesophageal reflux symptoms on vorinostat may be treated with Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) as well as H2 blockers as clinically indicated.  
Growth factor support will start on day 11 with either peg -filgrastim or filgrastim for at 
least 5 days. On day 1 or 8 of each cycle, drugs will be held for a t least 1 week if absolute 
neutrophil count <1000 /mm, platelet count < 50000/mm or for any grade 3 or 4 toxicity. 
Patients will be permitted to receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed 
necessary by the treating physician including but not li mited to the items outlined below:   
• Diarrhea:  Diarrhea should be treated promptly with appropriate supportive care, 
including loperamide.  Loperamide should not be taken prophylactically. Patients should be instructed to begin taking loperamide at the first sign of: 1) poorly formed or loose stool, 2) occurrence of more bowel movements than usual in one day or 3) unusually high volume of stool.  Loperamide should be taken in the following manner: 4 mg at first onset of diarrhea, then 2 mg after each unformed stool.  The daily dose of loperamide should not exceed 16 mg/day.  Loperamide should be deferred if blood or mucus is present in the stool or if diarrhea is accompanied by fever. In this setting, appropriate diagnostic microbiologic specimens should be obtained to exclude an infectious etiology. Patients should also be advised to drink liberal quantities of clear fluids as detailed in Section [3.2.X]  to help prevent dehydration.

Amended: 12/13/11 
- 24 - • Nausea/vomiting:   Nausea and vomiting should be treated aggressively, and strong 
consideration should be given to the administration of prophylactic antiemetic therapy according to standard institutional practice. In particular, the use of antiemetics including 5HT3 antagonists and/or a prepatent  plus dexamethasone is encouraged. Patients should 
be strongly encouraged to maintain liberal oral fluid intake (as detailed in Section [3.2.X]) during therapy, especially during the initial 14 days of each treatment cycle. 
• Anemia: Treatment with vorinostat can cause dose- related anemia. If appropriate, the 
dose of vorinostat may be modified or therapy discontinued.  (see Section 9 for dose 
modification guidelines ). Transfusions [and/or erythropoietin if not AML/MDS]  may be 
utilized as clinically indicated for the treatment of anemia, but should be clearly noted as 
concurrent medications.  
• Thrombocytopenia:  Treatment with vorinostat can cause dose -related 
thrombocytopenia. If platelet counts are reduced during treatment with vorinostat, the vorinostat dose may be modified or therapy discontinued.  Transfusion of platelets may be used if clinically indicated .  
• Neutropenia:  Prophylactic use of colony- stimulating factors including G -CSF, pegylated 
G-CSF or GM -CSF should not be utilized during the first cycle of therapy. These factors 
may be utilized if clinically indicated in subsequent cycles as outlined in the guidelines for dose modification (see Section 9 ). 
• Hyperglycemia has been observed in patients receiving vorinostat.  Serum glucose 
should be monitored.  Adjustment of diet and/or anti -hyperglycemic therapy may be 
necessary.  
• Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia should be corrected prior to administration of 
vorinostat, and consideration should be given to monitoring potassium and magnesium in symptomatic patients (e.g. patients with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fluid imbalance or cardiac symptoms.)  
• Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis  have been reported.  Investigators 
should be alert to the signs and symptoms of these events.  Physicians should be alert to 
the signs and symptoms of these events, particularly in patients with a prior history of thromboembolic events. If a pulmonary embolism is documented, subsequent vorin ostat 
doses should not be administered, and the Principal  Investigator should be notified. 
• QTc prolongation  has been observed.  Baseline and periodic ECGs should be performed 
during treatment.  Vorinostat should be administered with particular caution in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and patients taking anti -arrhythmic medicines or other 
medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation.  If significant new QTc prolongation is

evaluated according to criteria outlined in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0.    
3. CBC and platelet count on days 1 and 8 of every 28-day cycle. 
4. Creatinine, BUN, AST/ALT, calcium, electrolytes, uric acid, LDH, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase on day 1 of every 28- day cycle.  
5. CT scan of chest abdomen and pelvis at the end of cycle 4 and cycle 6 .  
6. PET scan at the end  of cycle 6. 
7. End of Cycle 6 (+/- 1 week): History and physical examination including tumor measurements, Toxicity,  FACT- Lym assessment, Global rating of Change assessment, 
CBC, Creatinine, BUN, AST/ALT, calcium, electrolytes, uric acid, LDH, total bilirubin, alkaline phos phatase.  Bone marrow biopsy (if bone marrow involved prior to treatment) 
at completion of treatment.. 
8. FACT-Lym will be administered at baseline, on first day of each treatment cycle and at 
all followup visits in first year of follow up. The Global rating of Change will be 
administered at all first year visits other than baseline, and each rating will be anchored to the previous assessment.  
9. Patients will be followed for five years after completing treatment or until relapse. Followup visits will include CBC, chemistry studies including serum LDH, and CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. FACT- Lym will be administered during followup visits 
during the first year. Starting from the End of Cycle 6 visit, the frequency of visits will be 
every 3 months (year 1), every 4 months (years 2 and 3) and every 6 months (years 5). Annual telephone calls will be made to patients who are not continuing in followup with the treating physician after 5 years to check on their health status. 
11.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE EFFECTS  
Toxicity will be described according the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (Version 3.0). Doses of vorinostat will be either 300 mg or 400 mg daily according to a dose escalation/de- escalation 
scheme described in Section 9.0. Dose and schedule adjustments for the other agents will also be made according to the scheme described in Section 9.0. 
 
11.1 Vorinostat 
 
Adverse experiences (Section 9.3) considered by the Investigators to be at least possibly related to vorinostat in ≥10 % of patients across all Merck & Co., Inc. sponsored vorinostat clinical studies include (in descending frequency): fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, blood

Pregnancy an d Contraception  
Vorinostat can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate 
and well-controlled studies of vorinostat in pregnant women.   
Results of animal studies indicate that vorinostat crosses the placenta and is foun d in fetal 
plasma. Doses up to 50 and 150 mg/kg/day were tested in rats and rabbits,   respectively (~0.5 
times the human exposure based on AUC
0-24). Treatment -related developmental effects including 
decreased mean live fetal weights, incomplete ossificati ons of the skull, thoracic vertebra, 
sternebra, metacarpals and skeletal variations (cervical ribs, supernumerary ribs, vertebral count 
and sacral arch variations) in rats and rabbits at the highest doses of vorinostat tested. The no observed effect level (NOEL) for these effects was 15 and 50 mg/kg/day (<0.1 times the human 
exposure based on AUC) in rats and rabbits. If the drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potent ial 
hazard to the fetus.  
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with vorinostat. Female patients  enrolled in this study should either be  post 
menopausal, free from menses for > 2 years, surgi cally sterilized or willing to use 2 adequate 
barrier methods of contraception to prevent pregnancy or agree to abstain from heterosexual activity throughout the study, starting with visit 1.  Female patients of childbearing potential 
must have a negative serum pregnancy test (β- hCG) within 72 hours prior to receiving the first 
dose of vorinostat. Male patients enrolled in this study should also agree to use an adequate method of contraception for the duration of the study. Patients should be advised to dis cuss 
adequate birth control options with their physician.  
If a patient or their partner inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with vorinostat, the patient will immediately be removed from the study.  The site will contact the patient at least monthly and document the patient’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated.  
The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the SPONSOR without delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life -threatening complication to the mother or newborn).  If a male patient’s 
partner becomes pregnant on study the pregnancy must be reported to the SPONSOR.  The study investigator will make every effort to  obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy 
and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the SPONSOR.  
Should a patient become pregnant refer to Safety Section for reporting instructions.

- 27 - Use in nursing women 
It is unknown whether vorinostat is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from vorinostat, breast feeding must be discontinued for the duration of therapy with vorinostat and the concomitantly used chemotherapy, if applicable.

13.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
If at anytime the patient develops progressive disease he/she will be taken off study and referred 
for alternative therapy.  If at anytime the patient develops unacceptable toxicity he/she will be removed from study.  If at anytime the patient is found to be ineligible for the protocol as designated in the section on Criteria for Patient/Subject Eligibility (i.e., a change in diagnosis), the patient will be removed from the study. 
 
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS  
This is a phase I/II, open -label, multicenter, single arm trial. The goals are to determine the 
optimal dose of vorinostat when given in combination to rituximab, cyclophosphamide, etoposide and prednisone for elderly patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who are not candidates for autologous stem cell transplantation. The primary efficacy endp oint is complete 
response rate. Secondary efficacy endpoints include overall response rate (CR+PR) and one -year progression free and overall survivals. Quality of life endpoints are described in Section 
14.1. Criteria of response are defined in section  12.0. The maximum n umber of assessable 
patients entered into the phase I and phase II components is 5 3 as described below.

IRB Protocol 
IRB#: 08- 045A(6) 
 
Amended: 12/13/11 
- 30 - Phase I: 
The starting dose of vorinostat will be 300 mg orally days 1-10. All other agents will be as described in Section 4.1. Three patients will be enrolled at this dose. If 0/3 experience DLT then 
the dose will be increased to 400 mg orally days 1-10. If 1/3 patient experiences a DLT then 3 more patients will be added at the 300 mg dose. If ≥2 patients experience DLT at 300 mg, the 
trial will be disc ontinued because of excessive toxicity. If ≤ 1 out of 6 patients experience a DLT 
at 300 mg then we will escalate to 400 mg and follow the same scheme. If two or more 
experience a DLT at 400 mg and only three  patients were treated at 300 mg, then we will de -
escalate to 300 mg and 3 additional pts will be added. If ≤1 out of 6 patients experience a DLT at 
400 mg, then 400 mg will be the MTD for the Phase II part of the study. DLT is defined as any grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicity or grade 4 thrombocytopenia as evaluated in the first cycle of treatment.  The Phase I part of the study will accrue a maximum of 12. The six patients 
treated at the MTD will be included in the Phase II part of the study. 
 Phase II statistical design:  
With type I and type II errors of 0.1, based on a Simon two -stage design, the sample size needed 
to show a clinically significant improvement in complete response rate (CR) from 35% to 55% is 47 patients. If at least 8 patients out o f 20 patients respond at the first stage, then the study will 
accrue 27 more patients at the second stage. If 7 or less patients respond at the first stage then the study will stop and conclude that this regimen has a CR lower or equal that 35%.  If at least 21 patients respond at the end of the trial then this study will conclude that this regimen is promising in this patient population.  
 
For the secondary endpoint of progression- free survival  (PFS) it will be assumed that 47 patients 
will be followed up for at least one year as for the primary endpoint.  
 The overall response rate (CR+PR) and its 90% confidence interval will be estimated via 
binomial proportions.  Frequency of toxicity will be tabulated according to the NCI common toxicity criteria.  Assuming accrual rate of 1 -2 patients per month, this trial will take approximately 26- 53 months 
to complete. We expect to complete accrual within 3 years  
 
14.1 Quality of life as measured by the FACT -Lym instrument.  
 
FACT-Lym, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Lymphoma, a validated QOL tool to 
evaluate quality of life in lymphoma clinical research, adds to the 27 -item FACT -G a list of 15 
lymphoma-specific questions
9 (www.facit.org).  
 FACT-Lym will be administered at baseline, on first day of each treatment cycle and at all 
follow-up visits in the first year of follow -up which will be every 3 months for the first year. The 

Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Protocol 
IRB#: 08- 045A(6) 
 
Amended: 12/13/11 
- 31 - FACT-Lym questionnaire will be administered to patients registered on the phase I and phase  II 
portions of the trial. 
The following FACT-Lym endpoints will be evaluated: Physical Well- being scale (raw scores), 
Functional Well -being scale (raw scores), Social/family Well -being scale (ra w scores), 
Emotional Well- being scale (raw scores), Lymphoma scale (raw scores), Total score composed 
of all five scales (raw scores), Trial Outcome Index (TOI) composed of the physical well-being 
scale, functional well-being scale and the lymphoma specific scales (raw scores). Scoring of the 
FACT-Lym (version 4) will be done in accordance with the FACT -Lym as described in the 
Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) manual36 . For each endpoint, 
summary raw scores will be summarized using means and medians at each assessment point 
along with standard deviations and interquartile range s.  
The aim is to evaluate whether FACT -Lym scores improve across time, especially among 
responding patients. A general class of models for the analysis of longitudinal data is that of mixed models
37.  For this study, a mixed -effects longitudinal model to evaluate selected FACT -
Lym endpoints over time will be implemented.  Each patient will be scheduled to complete up to 
fourteen assessments: Week 0  (Baseline), 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and then every 3 months for the 
first year of followup . For each post- Baseline assessment, we will use the date of questionnaire 
completion to compute the amount of time in months from baseline.  The time variable will be set to zero for all Baseline questionnaires. An unstructured covariance pattern will be used to account for the correlations within patients, unless an alternative covariance structure better fits the data.  The unstructured covariance pattern provides ma ximum flexibility and allows the 
variance of the endpoint to be different at each visit, and the covariance of each pair of visits to be different.  We will attempt to use an unstructured covariance pattern to account for the 
correlations within patients. The unstructured covariance pattern, when viable, provides 
maximum flexibility and allows the variance of the endpoint to be different at each visit, and the covariance of each pair of visits to be different. Due to small sample size and potentially missin g 
data, it is anticipated that less flexible covariance structures may need to be investigated.  The 
basic analytical model will include fixed effects (time) and random effects (patient, patient*time).  A quadratic effect (time
2) may be included to evaluate  the possibility of nonlinear 
change over time.  Piece wise linear regression models may also be used to separately model the changes during the first month and the changes during subsequent months.  Patient age and gender will be added to the basic model to determine if these variables have any independent effect on the FACT- Lym scores.  A likelihood ratio test will be used to assess the contributions 
of these variables. The model parameter estimates, standard errors and p-values will be 
summarized . (Table 1). The effect of baseline characteristics on QOL will be evaluated in 
exploratory analyses.   
A potential problem in QOL studies is that missing data are often not missing at random, e.g., patients who experience increased toxicity, disease progression or death are more likely to miss one or more assessments.  If the probability of missingness depends on the unobserved QOL scores, then missing data are considered non ignorable, or missing not at random
38 (MNAR ; 
Little & Rubin, 1987).  Formally distinguishing between missing at random (MAR) and MNAR is not trivial and relies on assumptions that are themselves untestable
38,39.  Therefore, a pattern-

Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Protocol 
IRB#: 08- 045A(6) 
 
Amended: 12/13/11 
- 32 - mixture model to assist in the analysis of potentially non ignorable  missing data will be 
implemented40 .  For this method, patients will be stratified into grou ps defined  as “dropouts” 
and “completers”, the cut -off time mark of assessment completion will depend on the 
missingness pattern at each assessment. Mixed -effects repeated measures models will be created 
within each stratum and parameter estimates for each stratum w ill then be combined into a 
weighted average for the entire study population.  Estimated means at each time point will be calculated using the parameter estimates and standard errors from the final models. The parameters estimates from the pattern -mixture model will be compared to those from the naïve 
mixed-effects model.  
On the other hand, an exploratory method of analysis, a joint model of FACT- Lym scores and 
time-to-progression will be also fit. This model is based on an extension of the two- stage linea r 
random effects model, where each subjects’ random intercept and slope are allowed to be associated with the underlying time to event
41,42 . The joint distribution of the continuous 
responses and the time- to-event variable are then estimated via m aximum likelihood using the 
EM algorithm. The parameters estimates from the joint model of longitudinal measures and time -
to-progression will be also compared to those from the naïve mixed- effects model.  
 SAS v9.1 will be used for all analyses. As these h ealth-related quality of life analyses are 
considered exploratory, there is no need to adjust the significance level for multiple comparisons.

Anchoring interpretation of change to a subjective global rating from the patient . As this is an 
uncontrolled Phase I/II study, with FACT-Lymphoma measures periodically on the phase II 
portion, interpretation of any detected change will be aided by also asking patients to provide an 
estimate of the degree to which they have changed (improved or worsened), if at all, since 
baseline. We will use a 7 -point patient global rating of change, adapted from Jaeschke et al 
(1989), to classify patients into those who have improved, worsened or not changed. These three 
distinct groups will then be compared on the FACT-Lymphoma subscales to provide some 
interpretation as to the meaningfulness of the noted change in terms of FACT -Lymphoma scores. W e 
will evaluate general linear models using each patient's change score.  Changes in patient - and provider -
rated performance status, as well as patient -rated perceptions of QOL change, will be used to form three 
independent groups (better, no change , worse).  We will look for confirmation that the FACT -Lymphoma

- 33 - measures provide clinically meaningful estimates of change.  No imputation of missing data will be done 
for patients who fail to participate after baseline evaluation; however, we will prospec tively monitor the 
reasons for missing data (e.g., refusal, disease progression, death) and will compare characteristics of 
patients who do and do not participate in the longitudinal study.

- 37 -  16.0.4 Data Review and Queries for Participating Site Data  
 
Research staff at MSKCC will review data and source documentation as it is submitted. Data will be monitored against source documentation and discrepancies will be sent as queries to  the 
participating sites. Queries will be sent by MSKCC Research staff twice a month.  
 
Participating sites should respond to data queries within 14 days of receipt. 
  
16.1 Quality Assurance  
Registration reports will be generated to monitor patient’s accrua ls and completeness of 
registration data. Routine data quality reports will be generated to assess missing data and inconsistencies. Accrual rates and extent and accuracy of evaluations and follow -up will be 
monitored periodically throughout the study and potential problems will be brought to the attention of the study team for discussion and action.   Random-Sample data quality and protocol compliance audits will be conducted by the study team, at a minimum of once a year or more frequently if indicated.  
 
16.1.1 Quality Assurance for Participating Sites  
Each site participating in the accrual of participants to this protocol will be audited by the staff of the MSKCC study team for protocol and regulatory compliance, data verification and source documentation.  Audits may be accomplished in one of two ways:  (1) selected participant 
records can be audited on -site at participating sites or (2) source documents for selected 
participants will be sent to MSKCC for audit. Audits will usually be determined by participant accrual numbers and rate of accrual, but can  also be prompted by reported SAEs or request of 
MSKCC PI.  
 Audits will be conducted at least once shortly after initiation of participant recruitment at a site, annually during the study (or more frequently if indicated), and at the end or closeout of the trial. The number of participants audited will be determined by available time and the complexity of the protocol.    The audit will include a review of source documentation to evaluate compliance for:  
• Informed consent documents and procedures 
• Adherence to eligibility criteria  
• Protocol defined treatment 
• Required baseline, on study and follow-up protocol testing 
• IRB documents (submitted amendments, annual continuing review reports, SAEs) 
• Required specimen submission

 A wrap-up session will be conducted at the participating site and preliminary findings will be 
discussed with the participating site PI and research team. The preliminary results will be sent to the MSKCC PI.   
 Each audit will be summarized and a final report will be sent to the PI at the audited participating site within 30 days of the audit. The report will include a summary of findings, participant by participant case review, specific recommendations on any performance and/or sho rtcomings and 
request for corrective action, when necessary. When corrective action is required, the participating site must reply within 45 days of receipt of audit report with their corrective action plan.   
 
A copy of the audit report and corrective action plan (if applicable) submitted by the 
participating site must be sent to the MSKCC IRB/PB, CRQA and maintained in the department’s protocol regulatory binder.    
 
16.1.2 Response Review  
 
 Since therapeutic efficacy is a stated primary objective, all sites participant’s responses are subject to review by MSKCC’s Therapeutic Response Review Committee (TRRC).  Radiology, additional lab reports and possibly bone marrow biopsies and/or aspirates will need to be obtained from the participating sites for MSKCC  TRRC review and confirmation of response 
assessment. These materials must be sent to MSKCC promptly upon request.           
 
16.2 Data and Safety Monitoring 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center were 
approved by the National Cancer Institute in September 2001.  The plans address the new policies set forth by the NCI in the document entitled “Policy of the National Cancer Institute for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials” which can be found at  http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html
.   The DSM Plans at MSKCC were 
established and are monitored by the Office of Clinical Research.  The MSKCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plans can be found on the MSKCC Intranet at: 
http://inside2/clinresearch/Documents/MSKCC Data  and Safety  Monitoring Plan.pdf  
 
There are several different mechanisms by which clinical trials are monitored for data, safety and 
quality.  There are institutional processes in place for quality assurance (e.g., protocol monitoring, compliance and data verification audits, therapeutic response, and staff education on clinical research QA) and departmental procedures for quality control, plus there are two institutional committees that are responsible for monitoring the activities of our clinical trials programs.  The committees: Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)  for Phase I and II

report to the Center’s Research Council and Institutional Review Board.    During the protocol development and review process, each protocol will be assessed for its level 
of risk and degree of monitoring required.  Every type of protocol (e.g., NIH sponsored, in-house 
sponsored, industrial sponsored, NCI cooperative group, etc.) Will be addressed and the 
monitoring procedures will be established at the time of protocol activation  
 
16.3 Regulatory Documentation  
 
Prior to implementing this protocol at MSKCC, the protocol, informed consent form, HIPAA authorization and any other information pertaining to participants must be approved by the MSKCC Institutional Review Board/Privacy Board (IRB/PB). Prior to implementing this protocol at the participating sites, approval for the MSKCC IRB/PB approved protocol must be obtained from the participating site’s IRB.    
The following documents must be provided to MSKCC before the participating site can be 
initiated and begin enrolling participants:  
• Participating Site IRB approval(s) for the protocol, appendices, informed consent form and HIPAA authorization 
• Participating Site IRB approved consent form 
• Participating Site IRB membership list  
• Participating Site IRB’s Federal Wide Assurance number and OHRP Registration number  
• Curriculum vitae and medical license for each investigator and consenting professional 
• Documentation of Human Subject Research Certification training for investigators and 
key staff members at the Participating Site  
• Participating site laboratory certifications and normals  
 
Upon receipt of the required documents, MSKCC will formally contact the site and grant permission to proceed with enrollment.   
 16.3.1 Amendments  
 
Each change to the protocol document must be organized and documented by MSKCC and first 
approved by the MSKCC IRB/PB. Upon receipt of MSKCC IRB/PB approval, MSKCC will immediately distribute all non expedited amendments to the participating sites, for submission to 
their local IRBs.  
 
Participating sites must obtain approval for amendments from their IRB within 90 calendar days  
of MSKCC IRB/PB approval. If the amendment is the result of a safety issue or makes eligibility criteria more restrictive , sites will not be permitted to continuing enrolling new participants until 
the participating site IRB approval has been granted.

The Continuing Review Approval letter from the pa rticipating site’s IRB and the most current 
approved version of the informed consent form should be submitted to MSKCC within 7 days of 
expiration. Failure to submit the re -approval in the stated timeline will result in suspension of 
study activities. 
 
Deviations and Violations  
A protocol deviation on this study is defined as a request to treat a research participant who does not meet all the eligibility criteria, pretreatment evaluation, or who requires alteration in their study plan. If a deviation from this protocol is proposed for a potential or existing participant at MSKCC or a participating site, approval from the MSKCC IRB/PB is required prior to the action. Participating sites should contact the MSKCC PI who will in turn seek approval from the MSKCC IRB/PB.  
 
A protocol violation is anything that occurs with a participant, which deviated from the protocol without prior approval from the MSKCC IRB/PB. For protocol violations that are identified after they occur, the participating site should report to MSKCC as soon as possible. The MSKCC PI will in turn report the violation to the MSKCC IRB/PB.  
 
Participating sites should report deviations and violations to their institution’s IRBs as soon as possible per that site’s institutional guidelines. Approv als/acknowledgments from the 
participating site IRB for protocol deviations and violations should be submitted to MSKCC as received.  
 
Other correspondence Participating sites should submit other correspondence to their institution’s IRB according to local guidelines, and submit copies of that correspondence to MSKCC. 
 
16.3.3 Document maintenance  
 
The MSKCC PI and the Participating Site PI will maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the implementation of the protocol to be fully documented and the data to be subsequently verified.

  17.3 Regulatory And Reporting Requirements  
   17.3.1 Recording Adverse Experiences 
An adverse experience is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, 
function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR’s product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR’s product, is also an adverse experience.  
Changes resulting from normal growth and development which do not vary significantly in frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse experiences. Examples of this may include, but are not limited to, teething, typical crying in infants and children, and onset of menses or menopause occurring at a physiologically appropriate time. Adverse experiences may occur in the course of the use of a Merck product in clinical studies or within the follow -up period specified by the protocol, or prescribed in clinical practice, from 
overdose (whether accidental or intentional), from abuse, and from withdrawal.  
Adverse experiences may  also occur in screened subjects/patients during any pre allocation 
baseline period as a result of a protocol -specified intervention including washout or 
discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment, or a procedure.

PI and participating investigators need to provide Merck & Co., Inc. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215-993- 1220) with copies of all serious and/or unexpected adverse experiences, 
within two working days.  PI and participating investigators also agree to establish and maintain records and make reports to the FDA with copies, as described above, to Merck for the following 
Adverse Experiences: (1) all serious, unexpected, adverse events, (2) any significant increase in 
the frequency of serious expecte d adverse events, and (3) any significant increase in the 
frequency of therapeutic failures.  Additionally, PI and participating investigators  must  report 
any pregnancy occurring in association with use of a Merck Product to Merck & Co., Inc. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215-993-1220).  For any serious thromboembolic Adverse 
Experiences, PI and participating investigators must fax, at the same time as the submission to Merck of the original report, the additional information set forth on the Zolinza Thromboembolic 
Event Questionnaire  In addition, if the PI or participa ting investigator become s aware of any 
new information regarding any Adverse Experience, he/she must submit that new information to Worldwide Product Safety within two working days. 
 
17.3.3   Determination of reporting requirements  
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient has 
received an investigational or commercial agent; 2) the characteristics of the adverse event including the grade (severity), the relationship to the study therapy ( attribution), and the prior 
experience (expectedness) of the adverse event; 3) the phase (1, 2, or 3) of the trial; and 4) whether or not hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization was associated with the event. An investigational agent is a protoc ol drug administered under an Investigational New Drug 
Application (IND) (vorinostat, bevacizumab). In some instances, the investigational agent may be available commercially, but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved package label. Commercial agents are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from a commercial source (paclitaxel, trastuzumab).  
 When a study arm includes both investigational and commercial agents, the following rules apply: 
 
Concurrent administration: When an investigational agent(s) is used in combination with a 
commercial agent(s), the combination is considered to be investigational and expedited reporting 
of adverse events would follow the guidelines for investigational agents.  Sequential administration: When a study includes an investigational agent(s) and a commercial 
agent(s) on the same study arm, but the commercial agent(s) is given for a period of time prior to starting the investigational agent(s), expedited reporting of adverse events which occur prior to starting the investigational agent(s) would follow the guidelines for commercial agents. Once therapy with the investigational agent(s) is initiated, all expedited reporting of adverse events should follow the investigational guidelines.

- 44 - 17.3.4 Steps to determine if an adverse event is to be reported in an expedited manner: 
 
Step 1: Identify the type of event using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0. The CTCAE provides descriptive terminology and a grading scale 
for each adverse event listed. A copy of the CTCAE can be downloaded from the CTEP home 
page (http://ctep.cancer.gov). Additionally, if assistance is needed, the NCl has an Index to the CTCAE that provides help for classifying and locating terms. All appropriate treatment locations should have access to a copy of the CTCAE.  Step 2: Grade the event using the NCI CTCAE . 
 Step 3: Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy (investigational or commercial). Attribution categories are as follows: Unrelated, Unlikely , Possible, Probable, and 
Definite. 
 Step 4: Determine the prior experience of the adverse event. Expected events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from administration of the agent. An adverse event is considered unexpected , for expedited reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or 
the severity of the event i s NOT listed in the current NCI Agent- Specific Adverse Event Lis t for 
the investigational agent.  
 Step 5: Review the Additional instructions, requirements, and exceptions for this protocol specific requirements for expedited reporting of specific adverse events that require special monitoring.  Step 6: Determine if the protocol treatment given prior to the adverse event included investigational agent(s), a commercial agent(s), or a combination of investigational and commercial agents.  NOTE: If the patient received at least one dose of investigational agent, follow the guidelines for 
investigation agents. If no investigational agent was administered, follow the guidelines for non-investigational agents.  
            
17.4 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting  for Participating Sites

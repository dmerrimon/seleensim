NexDoc Template Version 1.471.   INTRODUCTION
In general, the purpose of the statistical analysis plan (SAP) is to provide a framework that 
addresses the protocol objectives in a statistically rigorous fashion, with minimized bias or 
analytical deficiencies.  Specifically, this plan has the following purpose:
To prospectively (a priori) outline the types of analyses and data presentations that will 
address the study objectives outlined in the protocol, and to explain in detail how the data 
will be handled and analyzed, adhering to commonly accepted standards and practices of 
biostatistical analysis in the pharmaceu tical i ndustry.
1.1   Study Design
This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1b, dose-escalation study of MLN4924 in 
combination with docetaxel, paclitaxel and ca rboplatin, or gemcitabine in adult patients with 
solid tumors.  The study includes a carboplatin lead-in phase where subjects receive MLN4924 + carboplatin only.   The patient population will consist of patients 18 years of age or older with nonhematologic malignanc ies who, according to the investigator’s medical 
judgment, could potentially benefit from treatment with any of the 3 standard of care
therapies being studied.
It is expected that approximately 69 patients will be enrolled in this study.  During the dose 
escalation portion of this  study, the following dose levels of intravenous (IV) MLN4924 are 
planned to be studied in combination with  docetaxel (Arm 1), paclitaxel + carboplatin (Arm 
2), or gemcitabine (Arm 3).
MLN4924 + Docetaxel (Arm 1)
:  A total of 4 dose levels of IV MLN4924 (15, 25, 37, and 
50 mg/m2) are planned to be studied in combination with 75 mg/m2of docetaxel.  On Day 1 
of each cycle when both drugs are administered, docetaxel will be administered first at a 
dose of 75 mg/m2IV over 1 hour.  After a mandatory approximately15-minute time out
(MLN4924-free period), MLN4924 will be admin istered IV.   On Days 3 and 5, only 
MLN4924 will be given.  The duration of each cycle will be 21 days.  No dose reduction of 
MLN4924 below 15 mg/m2is allowed.
MLN4924 + Carboplatin Lead-in Phase (before Arm 2) :  Before patients are enrolled in 
Arm 2 with paclitaxel + carboplatin, a cohort of approximately 3 to 6 patients will be treated with AUC6 dose of carboplatin in combin ation with MLN4924 at a dose of 15 mg/m

NexDoc Template Version 1.48be given.  The duration of each cycle will be 21 days.  If 1 dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is 
seen in this cohort, 3 additional patients will be treated with the same combination regimen.  
The carboplatin dose may be reduced to AUC5 for safety as needed.  No dose reduction of 
MLN4924 below 15 mg/m2is allowed.  No dose escalation of MLN4924 is planned in this 
cohort.  The only chemotherapy agent that patien ts in this lead-in cohort will receive is 
carboplatin; these patients will not enroll on the MLN4924 + paclitaxel + carboplatin phase 
(Arm 2).
Observing no more than 1 DLT in this lead-in cohort will trigger enrollment in Arm 2 at 
AUC6 (MLN4924 [15 mg/m2] + paclitaxel [200 mg/m2] + carboplatin [AUC6]), and 
patients will be treated as described below for Arm 2.
If a total of 2 or more DLTs are observed in this cohort, enrollment on Arm 2 will open at
reduced paclitaxel and carboplatin doses (MLN4924 [15 mg/m2] + paclitaxel [175 mg/m2] + 
carboplatin [AUC5]), and patients will be treated as described below for Arm 2.
MLN4924 + Paclitaxel + Carboplatin (Arm 2) :  During the dose escalation phase, a total of 
4 dose levels of IV MLN4924 (15, 25, 37, and 50 mg/m2) are planned to be studied in 
combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin.  On Day 1 of each cycle when all 3 drugs are 
administered, paclitaxel is given first at a dose of 200 mg/m2(or 175 mg/m2, if the dose was 
reduced in the carboplatin lead-in c ohort) IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin AUC6 
(or AUC5 if the dose was reduced in the car boplatin lead-in cohort) over 30 minutes.  After 
a mandatory approximately 15-minute time out (MLN4924-free period) after carboplatin administration, MLN4924 will be administered IV. On Days 3 and 5, only MLN4924 willbe given. The duration of each cycle will be 21 days.  
MLN4924 + Gemcitabine (Arm 3)
:  A total of 4 dose levels of IV MLN4924 (25, 50, 75, 
and 100 mg/m2) are planned to be studied in combination with 1000 mg/m2of gemcitabine.  
Gemcitabine will be administered IV at a dose of 1000 mg/m2over 30 to 60 minutes, or as 
per current prescribing guidelines.  After a 15-minute time out, MLN4924 will be 
administered.  Patients will receive both agents on Days 1, 8, and 15, and the duration of 
each cycle will be 28 days.
After the determination of the maximum to lerated dose (MTD) of MLN4924 with docetaxel 
(Arm 1), paclitaxel + carboplatin (Arm 2) , and gemcitabine (Arm 3), approximately 6 
additional patients will be enrolled to each arm for a total of approximately 12 patients 
treated in each arm at the MTD to more fully characterize the safety, tolerability, and Property of Takeda: For non-commercial use only and subject to the applicable Terms of Usehase ase

NexDoc Template Version 1.49pharmacokinetics (PK) of MLN4924 in combinat ion with each standard  of care regimen and 
to evaluate disease response.
An adaptive approach using a continual reassessment method (CRM) w ill be used for dose 
escalation (not including the Carboplatin lead-in). The CRM models the relationship between toxicities and dose level, which yields accurate and precise estimates of the MTD
(1, 
2, 3). The dose toxicity relationship and the predicted MTD (PMTD) level will be updated as 
new data become available. The recommendation to escalate, de-escalate, or expand at the 
same dose level will be determined by comparing the PMTD level from the dose toxicity model to the prespecified dose levels. From the starting dose, subsequent increases in dose 
will be made according to the dose levels indicated for each arm; however, for safety 
reasons, no dose level will be skipped, and a minimum of 3 patients is required before 
escalating to the next dose level. Once at least 6 patients are treated at any dose level and the algorithm does not reco mmend escalation or de-escalation, this dose level may be 
considered the MTD.
Toxicity will be evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.03, effective date 14 June 2010 
(4).  
DLTs are defined in Section 6.3.
Throughout the study, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 
and adverse events (AEs) will be assessed, and laboratory values, vital signs, and 
electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be obtained and assessed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MLN4924 in combination with docetaxel, paclitaxel + ca rboplatin, and 
gemcitabine (patients in the carbop latin lead -in cohort will receive MLN 4924 + carboplatin 
only).
Blood samples (sparse samp ling) for the determination of MLN4924 plasma concentrations 
and, if appropriate, its metabolites will be collected from each patient during Cycle 1 of 
treatment to contribute to a population PK an alysis of MLN4924 co-administered with 
docetaxel, or paclitaxel + carboplatin, or gemcitabine. 
Computed tomography (CT) scans with IV contra st of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis will 
be performed during screening. CT scans with IV contrast encompassing the known sites of disease will be performed at the end of Cycle 2 and then every other cycle thereafter, and at 
the End of Study (EOS) visit. If CT scan does not provide adequate imaging, magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to evaluate sites of disease. Tumor response will be

The DLT-Evaluable population is defined as all patients who either experience DLT during 
Cycle 1 or receive all scheduled doses of st udy drug on sc heduled days during Cycle 1 
without DLT. Patients in Arm 3 will st ill be considered DLT evaluable if they r eceive all 
doses of MLN4924 and receive gemcitabine on Days 1 and 8 only or on Days 1 and 15 only. 
3.   HYPOTHESES AND DECISION RULES
Not applicable for a phase I study.
4.   INTERIM ANALYSIS
As this is a phase I study there is no formal interim analysis.  There will be an ongoing 
review of safety data with the medical monitor and study investigators, as well as within an 
internal Safety Working Group and the Independent Data Monitor Committee (IDMC).   
5.   STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY
Analyses will be primarily descriptive in nature. No formal statistical tests will be 
performed. Summary tabulations will be presented that display the number of observations, 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables, and 
the number and percent (calculated using non-missing values) per category for categorical data, unless specified otherwise.
Due to the use of the CRM methodology for dose escalation, at a minimum, three patients 
will be dosed at any given dose level.  D ata may be pooled across dose levels for summary 
purposes.   When appropriate, data will be summarized for the pooled dose levels below the MTD, at MTD, and for all patients.   Data from each drug may be summarized separately.  Patients will be analyzed at the dose level to  which they were originally assigned, including 
those who receive subsequent treatment at a lower dose level.
5.1   Sample Size Justification
It is anticipated that approximately 69 patients will be enrolled combining the dose
escalation for the determination of MTD for each combination, the cohort expansion at each
MTD, and estimating approximately 6 patients enrolled in the carboplatin lead-in cohort.

5.15.1  
MLN4924
Statistical Analysis Plan, Study C15010
NexDoc Template Version 1.413Based on an estimated toxicity r ate of 25% at 50 mg/m2in Arms 1 and 2 and at 100 mg/m2
in Arm 3, computer simulations estimate that approximately 15 patients will be enrolled in 
each arm to determine the MTD o f MLN4924 with standard of care.
Once each MTD is determined, approximately 6 additional patients (MTD expansion
cohort) will be enrolled in each arm such that a total of approximately 12 patients will beenrolled and treated at each MTD to more fully characterize the safety, tolerability, and PK
of MLN4924 with standard of care. These enrollment rules are based on th e binomial 
probability assumption that if a particular toxicity occurs in 12.5% of the entire patient population, there is an 80% probability of observing at least 1 occurrence of that toxicity in 
12 patients.
5.2   Randomization and Stratification
As this is a phase 1 study using a CRM algorithm to allo cate patients to each dose level, 
there is no randomization in this study.  Patients will be assigned to a treatment arm based on investigator judgment.
5.3   Unblinding
As this is an open-label study, no unblinding methodology is required.
5.4   Data Handling
5.4.1    Methods for Handling Missing Data
All available efficacy and safety data will be included in data listings and tabulations.  No 
imputation of values for missing efficacy and safety data will be performed.  Data that are potentially spurious or erroneous will be examined according to standard data management 
operating procedures. MLN4924 concentration values missing the corresponding sampling 
date and time records will be excluded from PK analysis.
5.4.2    Definition of Baseline Values
Unless otherwise specified, for each safety parameter, the baseline value is defined as the 
value collected at the time closest to, but prior to, the start of study drug administration.  For 
the analysis of ECG data and urine safety data (e.g. Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (KIM-1)), the baseline value is the average of the screening and Cycle 1 Day 1 predose values, if both are

dose.
5.4.3    Windowing of Visits
All data w ill be categorized based on the scheduled visit at which they were collected.    The 
analysis of PK data and determination of PK parameters will be based on the actual elapsed time post dose.
5.4.4    Justification of Pooling
All data from all sites will be pooled.  Study center or treatment-by-center interaction will 
not be included in any statistical analysis.
5.4.5    Withdrawals, Dropouts, Loss to Follow-up
Patients in the escalation phase who are withdrawn from treatment during Cycle 1 for 
reasons other than DLT will be replaced. Generally no additional patients will be enrolled due to withdrawals, dropouts, or loss to follow-up.    
5.5   Patient Disposition
A tabulation of patient disposition data will include the number of patients for the following 
categories: patients treated (safety population), patients in the DLT-evaluable population, patients in the response-evaluable population, and patients discontinued from the study. The 
primary reason for study treatment discontinuation  will also be summarized in this table.  
All data w ill be summar ized by each arm and MLN4924 dose le vel.  Percentages will be 
based on the number of patients in the sa fety population, and they will be calculated for 
MTD, and the study total.
Data concerning patient disposition (eg reas on for study termination, patient population) will 
be presented in by-patient listings.  
5.6   Demographics and Baseline Disease Characteristics
5.6.1    Demographics
Baseline demographics will be summarized separ ately for patients in the safety population

in each arm.  Concomitant procedures will not be coded.
Concomitant medications and procedures will be presented in separate by-patient listings.
5.7.2    Study Treatments
For Arm 1 (MLN4924 + Docetaxel), patients will be administered docetaxel at a dose of 
75 mg/m2IV over 1 hour on Day 1 of each cycle. After a mandatory approximately15-
minute time out, MLN4924 will be administered IV.   On Days 3 and 5, only MLN4924 will 
be given.  The duration of each cycle will be 21 days.  
For the Arm 2 Lead-In Phase (MLN4924 + Carboplatin), patients will be treated with AUC6 
dose of carboplatin in combination with MLN4924.  On Day 1 of each cycle, both 
compounds will be given.  On Days 3 and 5, only MLN4924 will be given.  The duration of 
each cycle will be 21 days.  
For Arm 2 (MLN4924 + Paclitaxel + Carboplatin), patients will be administered all three 
drugs on Day 1 of each cycle. Paclitaxel is given first at a dose of 200 mg/m2(or 175 
mg/m2, if the dose was reduced in the carbop latin lead-i n cohort) IV over 3 hours followed 
by carboplatin AUC6 (or AUC5 if the dose was reduced in the carboplatin lead-in c ohort)
over 30 minutes.  After a mandatory approximately 15-minute time out after carboplatin administration, MLN4924 will be administered IV. On Days 3 and 5, only MLN4924 will 
be given. The duration of each cycle will be 21 days.  
For Arm 3 (MLN4924 + Gemcitabine), patients will be administered gemcitibine at a dose 
of 1000 mg/m
2IV over 30-60 minutes.  After a mandatory approximately15-minute time 
out, MLN4924 will be administered.  Patients will receive both agents on Days 1, 8, and 15, 
and the duration of each cycle will be 28 days.
All dosing information for each visit will be presented in a by-patient listing.
5.7.2.1    Extent of Exposure
The extent of exposure to MLN4924 will be ba sed on the number of cycles received and the 
mean number of doses administere d per cycle.  The distribution of the number of cycles 
received will be presented by dose level to which patients were initially assigned, as w ell as

Daily Expected Dose and Daily Prepared Dose may differ if there are dose decreases.  The 
scheduled dose level will be collected on the electronic case report form (eCRF) for each dosing day.  Body surface area (BSA) will be calculated on Cycle 1, Day 1, and at subsequent visits if the patient e xperiences a >5% change in body weight from the weight 
used for the most recent BSA calculation.  
Total Dose Received, Total Dose Expected, and Dosing Intensity for MLN4924 will be 
based on the following formulas:

Total dose expected will be calculated based on the BSA measured at baseline.  If there are 
dose increases, the Dosing Intensity may exceed 100%.  The number of patients with 100% 
intensity, 80% - < 100%, 50 - <80, and <50% intensity w ill be su mmarized by dose level, as 
well as for all patients.
For each of the standa rd of care drugs, the extent of exposure w ill be su mmarized in a 
similar manner as MLN4924.  A separate column w ill be generated for each dose level of 
MLN4924, and the number of cycles of st andard of care drug administered will be 
summarized.

5.7.2.2    Treatment Compliance and Modifications
The actions on study drugs (Dose Held, Dose Reduced, Dose Interrupted, Dose Delayed, 
Dose Incomplete, or Discontinued) will be summarized by MLN4924 dose level for 
MLN4924 and each standard of care drug.  Data will be summarized for Cycle 1 only as 
well as all cycles combined.  A patient will count only once for each type of action.  
5.8   Efficacy Analyses
Since this is a phase I study, efficacy is not a primary endpoint.  A summary of the best 
overall response as determined by the investigator using the RECIST version 1.1 guidelines 
will be presented as a measure of antitumor activity of MLN4924 in combination with standard of care drugs.  The number and percentage of patients in each disease response category (e.g. complete response [CR], par tial res ponse [PR], stable disease [SD], and 
progressive disease [PD]) will be presented  for each dose le vel.  Percentages will be 
calculated for all patients, and those at the MTD. All evaluations of response will be conducted using the response-evaluable population.ds∗∗∗

NexDoc Template Version 1.423For each patient in the expansion cohorts, the best percent change (ie, largest reduction) 
from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter will be calculated and displayed in a 
waterfall plot to show the distribution of response across MTD expansion patients in each 
arm.  Unscheduled visits will also be included in such displays.
The duration of disease response (CR or PR) and th e duration of CR will be presented in a 
by-patient listing for all response-evaluable patients with CR or PR.  Duration of response 
(or duration of CR) are the time, in both days and months, from the date of first documented 
response (or CR) per the investigator response a ssessment to the date of first documentation 
of PD after the first documented response (or CR), or the date of last disease assessment if the patient discontinues treatment before PD. In addition, the date of fi rst response, the date 
of first CR, the date of first documentation of PD after the first response, the number of 
cycles of response, and the number of cycles of CR w ill be shown. The duration of response
(in months), the duration of CR (in months), the number of cycles of response, and the number of cycles of CR will also be summarized descriptively at each dose level of 
MLN4924 for all response-evaluable patients. The same table will also summarize the time 
to first response and time to first CR.  Separate summaries will be generated for each arm of the study.  
The duration of SD or better will be presented in a by-patient listing for all response-
evaluable patients.  Duration of SD or better is the time from the date of first dose to the date 
of first documentation of PD, or the date of last disease assessment if the patient discontinues treatment before PD. In addition, the date of first dose, the date of first SD or better, the date of first documentation of PD, and the number of cycles with SD or better w ill 
be shown. The duration of SD or better (in months) and the number of cycles with SD or 
better will also be summarized descriptively at each dose level of MLN4924 for all response-evaluable patients. Separate summaries will be generated for each arm of the study.  
A separate listing will be generated for patients who are on treatment for at least 5 cycles. 
This listing should include disease type, number of cycles on treatment, duration of stable 
disease or better,  and prior therapies.
Results from all disease response assessments and whether there was symptomatic 
deterioration will be presented in by-patient listings.

The exact date and time of each sample collection, as well as the actual start and stop times 
of the infusion, should be recorded accurately, and particular care should be given to the 
recording of blood sampling times that occur close to the infusion.
All individual MLN4924 concentration-time data will be pooled to describe the population 
PK of MLN4924. As data permit, a nonlinear regression mixed effects model (NONMEM
software) will be used to assess MLN4924 exposure when administered in combination with 
docetaxel, or carboplatin/paclitaxel, or gemcitabine. Individual metabolite data may also be assessed, as deemed appropriate. If appropriate, historical data may be used in this analysis to increase the robustness of the model and precision of estimated PK parameters and 
compare with single agent data. Details of the modeling approach will be provided in a 
separate analysis plan, and the results of these analyses will be reported separately.
Plasma concentration values below the lower limit of quantification (<LLQ) of the 
bioanalytical assay will be set to zero for analysis. Actual PK sampling co llection 
dates/times will be used in the analysis. Actual time after dosing (TAD) will be set to zero 
for pre-infusion s amples and calculated as the difference between the sample collection 
date/time and the start date/time of the IV infusion.

NexDoc Template Version 1.427As data permit, individual and mean MLN4924 plasma concentration-time data will be 
tabulated and plotted for each combination therapy.
5.9.2    Biomarker Analysis
5.9.2.1 Candidate Tumor Biomarkers and Tumor Biomarkers of Response
Any biomarker related analysis including ERCC1 in Arm 2 of MLN4924 in combination 
with Paclitaxel and Carbophatin, PSMB1, NGS w ill be included in a separ ate biomarker 
analysis plan if appropriate.  
5.10   Safety Analyses
Safety evaluations will be based on the incidence, severity, type of AEs, clinically
significant changes or abnormalities in the patient’s physical examination, vital signs, ECG, 
and clinical laboratory results.
The following analyses will be performed using the safety population.  
5.10.1    Adverse Events
5.10.1.1    Adverse Events
AEs will be coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). Treatment-emergent is defined as an y AE that occurs after administration of the 
first dose of study treatment and up through 30 days after the last dose of study drug, any 
event that is considered drug-related regardless of the start date of the event, or any event 
that is present at baseline but worsens in severity after baseline. 
AEs will be tabulated by system organ class (SOC), high level term (HLT), and preferred 
term (PT).  Summary tabulations include the following subsets:
!Treatment-emergent AEs
!Drug-related treatment-emergent AEs  
!Grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent AEs 
!Grade 3 or higher drug-related treatment-emergent AEs 
!Grade 4 or higher treatment-emergent AEsProperty of Takeda: For non-commercial use only and subject to the applicable Terms of Useatioion n

!Drug-related SAEs
Treatment-emergent AEs will be tabulated by SOC, HLT, PT, and highest intensity.  Most 
commonly reported (at least 10% of all patients ) treatment-emergent AEs will be presented 
by preferred term.  Most commonly re ported (at least 10% of all patients) 
treatment-emergent AEs by preferred term w ill also be summarized by treatment cy cle of 
onset (Cycle 1, Cycle 2-3, Cycle 4-5, Cycle 6+). A dditionally, for patients dosed at MTD, a 
tabulation of AE (by SOC, HLT, and PT) vs grade intensity will be made.  Separate 
summaries will be generated for each arm.  All adverse events will also be reported in by-
patient listings.
All adverse events for patients who have dose modification in standard of cares will also be 
included in a by-patient listing. This listing shoul d additionally include reduced doses during 
AE occurrence and omitted doses durign AE occurrence. Reduced doses during AE 
occurrence refer to any dose level, administered during the period of AE onset date to AE ending date, which is lower than the dose closest but prior to AE onset date. Omitted doses during AE occurrence refer to any scheduled dose which is omitted during the period of AE 
onset date to AE ending date.
Adverse events with start dates that are completely or partially missing will be analyzed as 
follows:   
!If the start date has month and year but da y is missing, the event will be considered 
treatment emergent if both the month and year of the start date of the event are on or 
after the month and year of the date of the first dose of MLN4924 and on or before 
the month and year of the date of the last dose of MLN4924 plus 30 days.

5.10.2    Laboratory Data
For the purposes of summarization, all laboratory values will be converted to standardized 
units.  If a lab value is reported using a non-numeric qualifier (eg, less than (<) a certain 
value, or greater than (>) a certain value), the given numeric value will be used in the summarization, ignoring the non-numeric qualifier.  
If a subject has repeated laboratory values for a given time point, the value from the last 
evaluation will be used.
Shift tables of the change in  NCI CTC from  baseline to the post baseline worst CTC grade 
will be generated for relevan t measurements.  Graphical disp lays will be used to show 
changes in laboratory measures over time for patients:
1) Box graphs of individual tests over time for patients at MTD.  
2) Scatter plots of baseline versus worst post-baseline values for all patients.  Separ ate 
plotting characters w ill be used for each dose.  These will be gener ated for only 
selected labs (see table below).

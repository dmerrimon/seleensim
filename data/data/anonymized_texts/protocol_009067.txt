Study Number and Title: 
SGI-110-04: A Phase 3, Multicenter, Open-label, Randomized Study of SGI-110 versus Treatment Choice (TC) in 
Adults with Previously Untreate d Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Who Are Not Considered Candidates for 
Intensive Remission Induction Chemotherapy 
Investigational Drug:  SGI-110 for subcutaneous (SC) injection 
Clinical Phase:  3 
Study Centers Planned/Country: Multicenter global study (approximately 100-160 centers)  
Study Objectives:  
Primary Objective 
•To assess and compare efficacy (complete response [CR] rate and overall survival [OS]) betwee n SGI-110
and TC in adults with previously untreated AML who are not considered candidates for intensive remission
induction chemotherapy.
Secondary Objectives 
•To assess and compare effects of SGI-110 and TC in adults with previously untreated AML who are no t
considered candidates for intensive re mission induction chemotherapy with respect to the following variables:
-Composite CR (CRc = CR + Complete response with incomplete blood count recovery [CRi] + Complete
response with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp]) rate.
-Number of days alive and out of the hospital.
-Progression-free survival (PFS).
-Transfusion needs.
-Health-related quality of life (QOL).
-Duration of CR.
-Safety.
Exploratory Objectives 
• .
•
Study Design and Investigational Plan:   
Multicenter, randomized, open-lab el study of SGI-110 versus TC. Blinde d central reading of bone marrow and 
disease response will be performed. Subjects will be ad ults with previously untreated AML who are unfit to 
receive and not considered candidates for intensive remission induction chemotherapy. Approximately 
800 subjects will be randomly assi gned (1:1) to 1 of 2 groups:  
•SGI-110: 60 mg/m2 SGI-110 given SC daily for 5 days  (Days 1-5) in 28-day cycles.
•TC: subjects will be assigned (before randomization) by the investigator to 1 of the following treatment
regimens:
-20 mg cytarabine given SC twice daily  (BID) on Days 1-10 every 28 days.
-20 mg/m2 decitabine given intravenously (IV) daily on Days 1-5 every 28 days.
-75 mg/m2 azacitidine given IV or SC daily on Days 1-7 every 28 days.
Data will be reviewed by an indepe ndent Data Monitoring Committee (DM C) at regular intervals primarily to 
evaluate safety during study conduct. The co-primary endp oints are CR rate and OS. If either of the co-primary 
efficacy endpoints reaches statistical significance in favor of SGI-110 at either the interim analysis (OS only) or 
final analysis (CR and OS), then the study will be considered positive in efficacy. Randomization and analyses will be stratified by age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance st atus, study center region, 
and secondary AML or poor-risk cytogenetics.

Clinical Protocol SGI-110-04    EUDRACT 2014-001233-89 
Confidential Information 6 6 March 2015  Study Treatment: 
•SGI-110: 60 mg/m2 SGI-110 given SC daily on Days 1-5 in 28-d ay cycles. Treatment s hould be given for at 
least 6 cycles in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression requiring alternative therapy. 
Beyond 6 cycles, treatment should continue as long as the subject continues to benefit based on investigator 
judgment. 
•TC: before randomization, subjects w ill be assigned by the investigator to 1 of the following treatment 
regimens (dose, schedule, and administration route; othe r treatment parameters, such as duration of treatment 
and dose adjustment guidelines, should follow locally approved presc ribing information and institutional 
standard practice): 
-20 mg cytarabine given SC BID on Days 1-10 every 28 days. 
-20 mg/m2 decitabine given IV daily on Days 1-5 every 28 days. 
-75 mg/m2 azacitidine given IV or SC daily on Days 1-7 every 28 days. 
Study Endpoints: Co-primary Endpoints 
•CR rate based on modified International Working  Group (IWG) 2003 AML Response Criteria. 
•OS, defined as the number of days  from randomization to death. 
Secondary Endpoints •CRc (CR+CRi+CRp) rate. 
•Number of days alive and out of the hospital. 
•PFS, defined as the number of days from randomization to disease progression or death, whichever occurs 
first. 
•Number of red blood cell (RBC) or platelet transfusi ons (units) over the duration of the study treatment. 
•Health-related QOL by EQ-5D (consisting of the EQ-5D-5L  descriptive system and the EQ Visual Analogue 
Scale [EQ VAS]). 
•Duration of CR, defined as the time from first CR to time of relapse. 
•Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs). 
•30- and 60-day all-cause early mortality. 
Study Assessments and Procedures: 
A 14-day screening period is allowed (unless otherwise spe cified). After randomization, visits will occur on every 
treatment day. In addition, visits will occur on Days 8, 15 , and 22 of the first 2 cycles  of therapy and only on 
Day 15 in Cycles 3-6. In Cycles >6, only the treatment day vi sits are required, with he matology blood draws only 
on Day 1. Additional visits based on treatment effect  and blood counts may be done at the investigator’s 
discretion. Subjects will attend a safety follow-up visit after  the last study treatment. For subjects who discontinue 
study treatment before Cycle 6, long-term follow-up visits  will occur monthly until 6 months after the start of 
study treatment and then every 3 months thereafter. Fo r subjects who discontinue st udy treatment after Cycle 6, 
long-term follow-up will be every 3 months. 
Efficacy Assessments:  
Peripheral blood (PB) will be assessed at baseline and on Day 1 of each cycle for response evaluation. Bone 
marrow (BM) aspirate/biopsy will be performed at screenin g and then at the end of Cycles 2, 4, and 6 unless PB 
shows persistence of leukemic blasts that excludes th e possibility of a marrow response. After Cycle 6 BM 
assessment, BM aspirate/biopsy will be repeated every 3 months for the first year on study and then every 
6 months thereafter until PB or BM assessment shows dise ase progression or relapse. Response evaluation will be 
based on BM blinded assessment and the most concomitant PB counts. After blinded BM response is confirmed, 
assessment of normal count recovery will be done based initially on the most concomitant PB and in later cycles on PB counts from Day 1 of each cycle to avoid tr ansient treatment-induced normal count suppression. 
Pharmacokinetic Assessments:  
Sparse PK samples (as specified by the collection schedul e) will be collected at selected centers for subjects 
receiving SGI-110 and for subjects in the TC group who receive decitabine IV. Blood samples will be collected 
after drug administration in Cycle 1 (SGI-110 and decitabine IV). 
Biomarker Assessments:  
Blood and BM samples will be collected at screening for AML verification, molecular genetics, and cytogenetics. 
Health-related QOL Assessment: 
EQ-5D 5 level (EQ-5D-5L) will be administered before treatment on Day 1 of each cycle and, for subjects who 
discontinue study treatment before Cycle 6, monthly until 6 months after the start of study treatment.

Clinical Protocol SGI-110-04    EUDRACT 2014-001233-89 
Confidential Information 7 6 March 2015  Safety Assessments: 
Documented safety assessments will include AEs, c oncomitant medications, physical examination results, vital 
signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), ECOG performance status, hematology, and chemistry, according to the schedule 
of events. ECGs in triplicate will be  conducted predose, 1-2 hours after Cycle 1 Day 1 dosing, and at study 
treatment discontinuation. Clinically significant abnormal EC G at study treatment discontinuation as compared to 
the predose ECG should be followed for recovery or stabilization. 
Sample Size and Statistical Analyses: Sample Size Calculation: 
Assuming a CR rate of approximately 0.20 for subjects treated in the TC group and 0.30 or higher for subjects 
treated with SGI-110, 800 subjects (400 per treatment group) will have appr oximately 89% power to detect the 
overall difference of 0.10 at an alpha level of 0. 04 using a 2-sided Cochran Mantel-Haenszel test. 
For survival, an analysis at 670 death events will provide 90% power to detect a hazard ratio of approximately 
0.78 (a difference in median survival of 7 months in the TC group versus 9 months  in the SGI-110 group when 
using a 2-sided stratified log-rank test at a 0.05 alpha le vel. Accrual is expected to be uniform over a 21 month 
enrollment period (with an additional follow-up of 12 mont hs), so the assessment of survival needs approximately 
the same sample size of 800 subjects. Primary response and survival analyses will be performed after 670 death 
events have occurred.  
Efficacy: 
The primary endpoint of CR rate will be compared between the 2 treatm ent groups using a Cochran Mantel-
Haenszel test at an alpha level of 0.04 stratified by age (<75 or 75 years), ECOG performan ce status (0-1 or 2-3), 
study center region (North Am erica, Europe, rest of world), and secondary AML or poor-risk cytogenetics (either, 
neither). The co-primary endpoint of OS  will be displayed using a stratifie d Kaplan-Meier estimate and will be 
compared between the 2 treatment groups using a stratified log-rank statistic at an alpha level of 0.05 or 0.01 
(depending on the CR test result), in cluding the same stratification variable s used for analysis of CR rate. If 
statistical significance is achieved for both CR rate and OS at targeted levels of significance, hierarchically the 
CRc rate, the number of days alive and out of the hospital (NDAOH), and PFS will be assessed. The CRc rate will 
be compared between the 2 treatment groups using the same method as for CR. The NDAOH will be evaluated 
using a 2-sample t-test. PFS will be evaluated using the same method as for OS. 
Safety: 
Safety will be assessed by subject-reported and investigator-observed AEs, physical examination, laboratory tests 
(hematology and chemistry), vital signs, and ECG. AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) with severity categorization base d on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) v4.03. Treatment exposure, AE s including relatedness and severity, serious AEs (SAEs), and reasons 
for treatment discontinuation will be tabulated and presented for all subjects who receive any amount of study 
treatment. Concomitant medication will be coded using WHO Drug Dictionary. 
Formal Interim Analysis for Efficacy: 
One interim analysis of OS is planned after approximately half of the required death events have occurred. This 
interim analysis will be conducte d by an independent DMC, using th e Lan-DeMets implementation of an 
O’Brien-Fleming boundary that will preserve an overall 2-sided 0.01 al pha level. The DMC will also perform 
regular data reviews with the main purpose of ensuring sa fety of study subjects and quality of trial conduct. 
Study Duration: 
The expected study duration is appr oximately 36 months including 21 months for completing enrollment and 
approximately 12-15 months follow-up before final anal yses. The study is expected to start in Q1 2015.  
Compliance Statement: 
The study will be conducted in acco rdance with the International Confere nce on Harmonisation (ICH) Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, US Title 21 CFR Parts 11 , 50, 54, 56, and 312; the EU Clinical Trials 
Directive and its successor; principles enunciated in the Declaration of Helsinki; and all human clinical research 
regulations in countries wh ere the study is conducted.

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
1.1 Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in Patients Who Are Not Considered Candidates 
for Intensive Remission Induction Therapy and the Elderly 
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a genetically heterogeneous group of cancers that have in 
common clonal proliferation and arrested differentiation of myeloid precursors. Incidence increases with age and is about 12 cases per 100,000 for those at and above the median age at diagnosis of 65 years ( Schiffer and Anastasi 2014 ). Overall 5-year survival is 15% and varies 
substantially with age ( Shah et al 2013 ). Patients age 70-79 years and over age 79 years have 
5-year survival rates of 3% and 0%, respectively.  
In a recent analysis of US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data, trends in 
relative survival by age were compared over 3 successive decades from 1977 through 2006 for 19,000 patients at least 65 years of age with AML ( Thein et al 2013 ). Overall, survival improved 
for each successive decade in patients from 65-74 years old. In this age range, 12-month survival increased from 20% to 25% to 30% in the 3 successive cohorts. However, survival rates did not significantly improve in patients at least 75 years of age. The oldest old, at least 85 years of age, had the lowest survival, with no improvement. Thus, despite ongoing incremental improvements in both AML chemotherapy and supportive care since the mid-1970s, mortality following an AML diagnosis remains persistently high and without improvement in patients 75 years of age. 
In addition to age, other adverse prognostic indicators in AML include poor performance status, adverse cytogenetic or molecular genetic findings, past exposure to cytotoxic or radiation therapy, and history of myelodysplasia or another hematologic disorder ( Schiffer et al 2014 ). 
There is a correlation between age at diagnosis of AML and complex cytogenetic disease characteristics. Complex karyotype also correlates with disease resistance to therapy ( Grimwade 
et al 2001 ). In summary, AML in patients who are not considered candidates for intensive 
remission induction chemotherapy, particularly elderly patients, remains a persistent unmet medical need. 
For young patients, an AML diagnosis necessitates immediate intensive remission induction 
therapy. The goal is complete and prolonged disease remission. Yet for elderly patients with AML, intensive chemotherapy is often inappropriate due to adverse disease factors that cause chemo-resistance and comorbidities that exacerbate therapy-induced toxicity. Multivariate analyses in 2 retrospective series confirm that an unfavorable karyotype is an independent negative prognostic indicator in adults receiving induction chemotherapy ( Kantarjian et al 2006 ; 
Kantarjian et al 2010 ). 
Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  IND No. 102743 
Clinical Protocol SGI-110-04    EUDRACT 2014-001233-89 
Confidential Information 17 6 March 2015  Among 998 subjects age 65 years or older with AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome 
(MDS) who received intensive chemotherapy between 1980 and 2004, independent negative prognostic indicators for complete response (CR), induction (8-week) mortality, and survival included age 75 years, unfavorable karyotype, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status (PS) 3 or 4, longer duration of antecedent hematologic disorder, treatment outside a laminar airflow room, and abnormal organ function ( Kantarjian et al 2006 ). 
A subsequent analysis focused on 446 subjects 70 years of age with AML (>20% blasts) treated 
with cytarabine-based intensive chemotherapy between 1990 and 2008 to identify risk groups for high induction (8-week) mortality. By multivariate analysis, risk factors for 8-week mortality (36%) after intensive chemotherapy included age 80 years,  3 cytogenetic abnormalities, 
ECOG PS 2, and serum creatinine >1.3 mg/dL ( Kantarjian et al 2010 ). Additional series 
support these conclusions ( Grimwade et al 2001, Appelbaum et al 2006, Knipp et al 2007 ). Thus, 
factors predicting failure of intensive induction chemotherapy in AML include elderly age, complex karyotype, and patient characteristics including performance status and organ function. 
Recently, the Italian hematology groups published a consensus-based definition of unfitness for 
intensive chemotherapy that includes age >75 years, cardiac or pulmonary comorbidity, low performance status, and any other comorbidity judged by the physician to be incompatible with intensive chemotherapy ( Ferrara et al 2013 ). 
1.2 Treatment Options for Patients with AML Who Are Not Considered Candidates for 
Intensive Remission Induction Therapy 
No standard therapy exists for patients with previously untreated AML who are not candidates for intensive remission induction chemotherapy. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), European Leukemia Net, and European Society for Medical Oncology all recommend possible treatments with low-dose Ara-C (LDAC), azacitidine, or decitabine in addition to enrolling patients in experimental treatment clinical trials.  
Median overall survival in trials of these therapies varies from 5 to 25 months after initial 
diagnosis, depending on baseline subject features and therapy received ( Fenaux et al 2010 ; 
Dombret et al 2014; Kantarjian, Thomas et al. 2012 ; Estey 2007 ). The most common Grade 3 
AEs in all these trials are hematologic, including febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, with incidence from 20% to 94%. Thirty-day all-cause mortality ranged from 8% to 26%, and 60-day all-cause mortality ranged from 18% to 23%. Studies from which these results were derived are described individually below.  
In a Phase 3 trial comparing LDAC to hydroxyurea in subjects with AML or high-risk MDS not 
considered fit for intensive treatment, LDAC led to an AML CR rate of 18% (compared with 1% for hydroxyurea) and improved survival (odds ratio 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.44–0.81; p=.0009) (Burnett et al 2007). Similarly, a Phase 3 trial comparing azacitidine to 
conventional care in MDS subjects using French-American-British (FAB) criteria led to a CR rate of 18% in the subset of MDS subjects re-categorized as AML by World Health Organization 
Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  IND No. 102743 
Clinical Protocol SGI-110-04    EUDRACT 2014-001233-89 
Confidential Information 18 6 March 2015  (WHO) criteria (blasts 20% to 30%; Swerdlow et al 2008 ) with azacitidine (compared with a CR 
rate of 16% with conventional care) and improved survival (median 24.5 months compared with 
16.0 months, respectively) ( Fenaux et al 2010 ). A more recent phase 3 study of azacitidine 
versus conventional care regimens (best supportive care, LDAC, or intensive chemotherapy 7+3 treatment) in 488 subjects showed no difference in CR rate and no statistically significant difference in overall survival (OS), although a trend toward OS improvement was evident for azacitidine (median survival of 10.4 months for azacitidine versus 6.5 months for conventional care regimens with a hazard ratio of 0.85, p=0.10) ( Dombret et al 2014 ). Similarly, in a Phase 3 
trial comparing decitabine to LDAC or best supportive care in 485 subjects 65 years of age with 
AML, decitabine in a 5-day regimen led to a CR rate of 16% (compared with 8% for LDAC) and improved survival at the final analysis (median 7.7 months compared with 5.0 months, respectively; nominal p=.037) ( Kantarjian, Thomas et al 2012 ).  
After the randomized study of the 5-day decitabine regimen in subjects with AML who were 65 years of age, multivariate analysis was performed to investigate effects of baseline 
characteristics on survival ( Mayer et al 2014 ). Results were in general similar to those of 
retrospective series assessing factors predicting survival in elderly subjects undergoing intensive induction therapy for AML. Independent negative prognostic indicators included age 75 years, 
ECOG PS >1, poor cytogenetics, baseline blasts >50%, low baseline platelets, and high baseline white blood cell (WBC) counts. However, in contrast to results observed in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy, decitabine responses occurred across all risk groups. The authors conclude that response to decitabine was better than response to cytarabine or best supportive care and most clearly demonstrated in patients 75 years of age. 
Health-related quality of life (QOL) evaluation is sparse in patients with AML. A 2008 review of QOL assessed in randomized, controlled trials in leukemia identified only 4 trials in AML that measured QOL and called for more QOL research ( Efficace et al 2008 ). A recently published 
single-center trial evaluating QOL concluded th at, in 92 AML survivors, QOL was worse than 
the QOL in the general population ( Leunis 2014 ). Another trial evaluating QOL in 20 adults 
60 years of age with AML suggested that complete remission was associated with improved 
global health, physical function, and role function ( Alibhai 2009 ).  
In AML, supportive care is also often used to maximize quality of life, while not necessarily prolonging life. Supportive care for AML is imprecisely defined and “generally refers to treatment with antibiotics, transfusions of blood and blood products, hydroxyurea, and hematapoietic growth factors” (Ritchie and Roboz 2010 ). 
A recent retrospective report described the outcomes of 43 elderly patients with AML who were referred to palliative care ( Cheng et al 2015 ). Of these 43 patients, about half received only 
supportive care after their AML diagnosis. Approximately half died in acute hospital settings, while about 30% died in palliative care settings. Over half spent their entire final month of life in a hospital, and infections accounted for more than half of the deaths overall. Median time from diagnosis to death was 9 months. Thus, life expectancy, harm, and quality of life appear to be similar to or worse with supportive care only, as compared with therapy. A separate review

2014). 
1.3 Summary of Nonclinical and Clinical Data for SGI-110 
Please refer to the most recent Investigator Brochure (IB) for the complete and most up-to-date 
information. 
1.3.1 SGI-110 Nonclinical Data Summary 
1.3.1.1 Activity 
SGI-110 is a dinucleotide of decitabine and deoxyguanosine, designed to protect the active 
decitabine moiety from inactivation by cytidine deaminase ( Griffiths, Choy 2013). In vitro 
evidence suggests that SGI-110 has a longer half-life than decitabine in the presence of cytidine deaminase ( Yoo et al 2007 ). SGI-110 has been investigated in a number of nonclinical studies 
for its pharmacodynamic effects on global DNA methylation and on the re-expression of specific genes that are silenced in cancer cells due to an altered methylation status of their DNA sequence. SGI-110 induced a dose-dependent decrease of proliferation and clonogenic survival in many different human cancer cell lines, including AML cell lines ( Jueliger et al 2014 , 
Srivastava et al 2014 ). These effects were associated with a decrease of global DNA and gene 
specific methylation. Re-expression of tumor suppressor genes like p16, p15, MLH1 and RASSF1A was also observed in xenografts at tolerated and efficacious regimens ( Fang et al 
2014). 
1.3.1.2 Pharmacokinetics and Toxicology 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in nonclinical species showed that upon subcutaneous (SC) 
administration, SGI-110 converts to decitabine with species differences in conversion rates (slower in primates and faster in rodents). Conversion appears to occur in blood and plasma but may also occur intracellularly in tissues. SGI-110 is stable in hepatic microsomes and in incubations with hepatocytes. In the presence of cytosolic fractions, SGI-110 converted to decitabine. SGI-110 did not inhibit CYP 450 enzymes and is unlikely to cause drug-drug interactions mediated by CYPs. SGI-110 did not inhibit hERG channel activity in vitro at up to 300 ȝ M. 
Nonclinical toxicology of SGI-110 was evaluated initially over one 28-day cycle (plus recovery) in rats and rabbits. To support the intended Phase 3 regimen in the clinic, 3-cycle studies used the Daily×5 dosing schedule in rats and monkeys. 
SGI-110 toxicity findings in rat and rabbit studies are similar to the nonclinical study findings of 
decitabine. Myelosuppression, thymus weight reduction, and testicular atrophy were the main study findings, similar to results in repeat-dose toxicity studies with decitabine in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs. Myelosuppression and thymus toxicities were reversible during recovery periods, whereas testicular atrophy persisted for both SGI-110 and decitabine.

Clinical Protocol SGI-110-04    EUDRACT 2014-001233-89 
Confidential Information 20 6 March 2015  Myelosuppression, particularly neutropenia, has been reported as a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) 
for decitabine in human clinical studies. 
Additional non-GLP studies in cynomolgus monkeys showed that PKs of SGI-110 and 
decitabine were most representative of human PK data. Hematologic parameters from the 2-cycle non-GLP study in monkeys confirmed a profile consistent with the pharmacological action of SGI-110 in humans.  
In the 3-cycle GLP toxicology study in rats, mortalities occurred at the higher dose levels of 
40 mg/kg starting later in the second cycle and for 20 mg/kg later in the third cycle. The cause of these mortalities appeared to be opportunistic infections secondary to severe neutropenia. Decitabine exposures at SGI-110 dose levels of 20 and 40 mg/kg in rats were greater than 340- and 600-fold higher, respectively, than human clinical exposures after the 60 mg/m
2 dose. STD 10 
in rats was 20 mg/kg over 2 cycles and between 10 and 20 mg/kg over 3 cycles. Hematologic changes at all SGI-110 dose levels were reversible and consistent with the expected pharmacodynamic effect of SGI-110. Organ weight changes and/or other reversible microscopic changes were noted in the low-dose animals, including effects on testes, epididymides, thymus, spleen, and adrenal glands at dose levels of 5 mg/kg. Histologic changes were completely or 
partially reversible for all organs within a 28-day recovery period. Toxicokinetic exposures of decitabine observed in rats offer considerable margins relative to exposures at the proposed clinical Phase 3 dose of 60 mg/m
2. Relative to clinical exposures, the area under the curve 
(AUC) exposures in rats were ~90-fold higher at 5 mg/kg and more than 300-fold higher at the 2-cycle STD
10 dose of 20 mg/kg. 
In monkeys, the highest tested dose over 3 cycles was 4.5 mg/kg/dose (human equivalent dose [HED] 54 mg/m
2), which was found to be the no observed adverse event level (NOAEL). H ighest 
non-severely toxic dose  (HNSTD) was not identified in this study. Dose-dependent bone marrow 
(BM) hypocellularity was the main finding, which correlated with hematological changes. There were no clinical signs or macroscopic findings; no effects on body weight or food consumption; and no effects on ophthalmologic, electrocardiographic, serum chemistry, and urinalysis parameters. Hematologic and histologic changes in BM at all SGI-110 dose levels were reversible and consistent with the expected pharmacologic effect of SGI-110. Possible SGI-110-related injection site changes of hyperkeratosi s at Day 85 and residual inflammation following a 
28-day dose-free recovery were noted for individual animals at the highest dose tested (4.5 mg/kg). Toxicokinetic exposures (AUC) in monkeys at the NOAEL dose of 4.5 mg/kg/dose were in the range of AUCs observed in the clinic after 60 mg/m
2, the recommended Phase 3 
dose. 
In summary, the main effect observed in nonclinical toxicology evaluation of SGI-110 was BM 
suppression, consistent with its intended pharmacological action.

Study SGI-110-01 was a first-in-human (FIH) study in subjects with MDS or AML. It was 
conducted in 2 phases and enrolled approximately 400 subjects:  
•Phase 1 Dose Escalation in 93 subjects established the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and 
biologically effective dose (BED) based on long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) demethylation. LINE-1 demethylation relative to baseline in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) provides a reliable surrogate of global hypomethylation by hypomethylating agents (HMAs). Phase 1 tested 28-day regimens of SGI-110 of (1) once daily for the first 5 days (Daily×5) or (2) once weekly for 3 weeks. LINE-1 demethylation was greater for the Daily×5 regimen. Subsequently, a third 28-day regimen was studied: twice weekly SGI-110 for 3 weeks.  
•Phase 2 Dose Expansion in over 300 subjects established response rate and safety in different subject populations of MDS and AML using 3 different doses/regimens. Five-day regimens of 60 and 90 mg/m
2/day were tested in both AML and MDS subjects. After safety and 
activity were established with the 5-day regimen, a single-arm 10-day regimen with 60 mg/m
2/day was studied in AML subjects. 
1.3.2.1 Phase 1 (SGI-110-01 Dose Escalation) 
Dose escalation was in subjects with refractory or relapsed MDS or AML who had ECOG 
PS 0-2 and acceptable liver and kidney function ( Kantarjian, Roboz et al 2012 ). Co-primary 
endpoints were MTD and BED; results are described below.  
•MTD 
•Daily×5 MTD was reached for MDS subjects at 90 mg/m2/day but was not reached for 
AML subjects up to 125 mg/m2. Of 12 subjects enrolled at the 125 mg/m2 dose level, 
3 had MDS, and 9 had AML. Although none of the subjects with AML experienced DLT, 
2 of 3 subjects with MDS treated at 125 mg/m2 Daily×5 experienced DLTs (febrile 
neutropenia + bacteremia in 1 subject, and febrile neutropenia + thrombocytopenia + fatal sepsis in another subject). 
•The MTD was not reached for the once weekly (up to 125 mg/m
2/dose) or the twice 
weekly (up to 90 mg/m2/dose) regimens. 
•BED (defined as the minimum dose that achieves maximal demethylation of LINE-1 from 3 successive cohorts) 
•The Daily×5 regimen had the greatest effect on LINE-1 demethylation, and the BED was 
60 mg/m
2/day ( Figure 1 ). Similar LINE-1 demethylation occurred at 60, 90, and 
125 mg/m2.  
•Less demethylation was observed with the Once Weekly regimen; the Twice Weekly regimen did not lead to better LINE-1 demethylation than the Daily×5 regimen.

A total of 74 subjects with relapsed/refractory AML were treated with SGI-110 in the Phase 1 
dose escalation segment. Responses were observed starting at the 36 mg/m2 dose level ( Table 1 ). 
Of 49 subjects treated at 36 mg/m2 or higher in the daily and weekly regimens, 5 CRc (CR + 
complete response with incomplete blood count recovery [CRi] + complete response with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp]), including 2 CRs, were observed. Three of 5 responses occurred with the 60 mg/m

In summary, Phase 1 showed that the Daily×5 regimen induced maximal DNA demethylation, 
and the dose of 60 mg/m2/day Daily×5 was the BED. The 90 mg/m2/day Daily×5 regimen was 
the highest well-tolerated dose for both MDS and AML subjects. Once weekly and twice weekly regimens were well tolerated at all doses but did not improve biological or clinical activity relative to the Daily×5 regimen. 
1.3.2.2 Phase 2 (SGI-110-01 Dose Expansion) 
Phase 2 dose expansion was opened as a multicenter, open-label, randomized dose-response 
comparison of 60 vs 90 mg/m
2 SGI-110 SC Daily×5. Subjects were stratified by disease type 
(treatment-naïve elderly AML, relapsed/refractory AML, treatment-naïve MDS, and relapsed/refractory MDS). Approximately 50 subjects were enrolled for each disease cohort. The 60 mg/m
2 Daily×5 dose was chosen because it represented the BED from Phase 1, while 
90 mg/m2 was chosen to explore benefit from a higher dose that was still well tolerated in both 
MDS and AML subjects. After safety and preliminary efficacy were established with the Daily×5 regimen, a 10-day regimen with 60 mg/m
2/day was studied in AML, first in 
relapsed/refractory subjects and then in treatment-naïve elderly subjects. 
1.3.2.2.1 Treatment-naïve Elderly AML 
Eligibility for treatment-naïve elderly subjects with AML in Study SGI-110-01 Phase 2 is 
defined below. Each eligibility criterion is recognized as high risk for more intensive therapy (Estey 2007 ). In addition to being 65 years of age, study subjects must have met at least one of 
these criteria:

•Poor-risk cytogenetics (monosomies or partial deletions of chromosome 5 or 7, abnormalities 
of 3q or 11q, translocation (6p23;9q34) or (9q34;22q11.2), or at least 3 unrelated cytogenetic abnormalities of any kind). 
•Pre-existing clinically significant dysfunction of the heart (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] <50%) or lung (diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide [DLCO] or forced expiratory volume in the first second [FEV
1] <50% of expected), unrelated to 
leukemia. 
•Poor ECOG PS of 2. 
Subjects were first randomly assigned to either 60 or 90 mg/m2/day SGI-110 Daily×5. The 
primary endpoint for AML subject cohorts was CRc (CR+CRi+CRp) rate at any time based on International Working Group (IWG) criteria ( Cheson et al 2003 ). Adverse events (AEs) and 
LINE-1 DNA methylation pharmacodynamics were secondary endpoints for safety and biological activity. 
Table 2  presents subject and disease characteristics of previously untreated elderly ( 65 years) 
subjects with AML enrolled in the study. Of 51 subjects enrolled in this cohort, 24 and 27 were 
randomized to dose levels of 60 mg/m
2/day and 90 mg/m2/day, respectively. The deleterious 
effect of advanced age generally remains after accounting for other covariates ( Appelbaum et al 
2006). Subjects with advanced age 75 years represented 73% of subjects in the study. In 
addition 47%, 45%, and 35% had poor-risk cytogenetics, secondary AML, and ECOG PS 2, respectively. Subject characteristics were generally balanced between the 2 dose groups with few exceptions. Median age was 78 and 77 years; ECOG PS 2 was 46% and 26%; 58% and 59% were male; and 50% and 44% had poor-risk cytogenetics in the 60 and 90 mg/m
2/day dose 
groups, respectively. The proportion of subjects with poor PS and/or poor-risk cytogenetics was higher in the 60 mg/m
2 dose group. Overall, 31% of subjects had multiple criteria beyond 
advanced age that excluded them from candidacy for intensive induction chemotherapy. These criteria are established risk factors for more intensive induction chemotherapy for AML ( Estey 
2007).

subjects with AML from the Phase 2 study after SGI-110 treatment. The 30- and 60-day all-cause mortality rates were low (5.9% and 15.7%, respectively) when compared with intensive induction even though most intensive induction studies in the elderly reported only treatment-induced mortality rather than all-cause mortality (Estey 2007 ).

SGI-110 showed clinical activity, but complete responses with SGI-110 in relapsed/refractory 
AML (CRc rate of 16% and 30% for the Daily×5 and 10-day regimens, respectively; Table 6 ) 
were lower than what was observed in treatment-naïve elderly subjects with AML (CRc rate of 55% for the Daily×5 regimen; Table 3 ). In relapsed/refractory AML, the 10-day regimen showed 
a trend of higher response rate and higher Grade 3 myelosuppression, with no difference in 
early all-cause mortality.  
1.4 Summary of Data for Treatment Choice (TC) 
Treatment choice (TC) will be compared with SGI-110 therapy in this study because no standard 
therapy exists for patients with previously untreated AML who are not considered candidates for intensive remission induction therapy. Available local TCs will depend on which TCs are approved locally. TC includes any of the following: 
•20 mg cytarabine given SC twice daily (BID) on Days 1-10 every 28 days. 
•20 mg/m
2 decitabine given intravenously (IV) daily on Days 1-5 every 28 days. 
•75 mg/m2 azacitidine given IV or SC daily on Days 1-7 every 28 days. 
As detailed in Section 1.2, each of these choices is supported by data from randomized clinical 
multicenter trials ( Burnett et al 2007 ; Fenaux et al 2010 ; Kantarjian, Thomas et al 2012 ; Dombret 
et al. 2014 ). They are used as standard of care and/or recommended by the NCCN, European 
Leukemia Net, and European Society for Medical Oncology. There have been no direct 
comparisons among them, and regional treatment standards vary. 
1.5 Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects 
Commonly observed AEs in Study SGI-110-01 in subjects with AML or MDS include injection 
site AEs, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, diarrhea, fatigue, and nausea. All these AEs are expected risks of SGI-110 in this Phase 3 trial in AML. These and additional risks in humans are described further in Section 8.0, Risks/Precautions. For more detailed information, 
please refer to the IB for SGI-110.  
Potential benefits of SGI-110 include symptom improvement, achieving leukemia disease 
remission, delayed disease progression, delayed need for subsequent anticancer therapy, and prolongation of survival.

Confidential Information 29 6 March 2015  For risks and benefits of TC therapies, refer to the latest locally-approved Prescribing 
Information for each therapy (USA examples: Cytarabine 2008 , Dacogen 2010, Vidaza 2014 ). 
Risk-benefit considerations favor performance of this trial. This study population has limited therapeutic options, and available therapies are of limited utility. SGI-110 has demonstrated clinical activity and the potential to generate improved benefit over TC in AML. 
2.0 RATIONALE 
2.1 Rationale for the Study 
Rationale for this study comes from SGI-110's molecular structure, PK, pharmacodynamic (PD), 
and clinical data.  
SGI-110's dinucleotide structure protects the active decitabine moiety from inactivation by 
cytidine deaminase (CDA). Human PK data confirms that gradual in vivo dinucleotide cleavage increases decitabine exposure time and effective half-life relative to decitabine IV infusion. Prolonged exposure time is predicted to increase efficacy because decitabine activity is dependent on its incorporation into DNA during DNA synthesis, ie, S-phase of the cell cycle (Griffiths, Choy et al 2013; Karahoca and Momparler 2013 ). Prolonged exposure results in more 
cancer cells susceptible to decitabine activity as they enter into S-phase. Also, a lower decitabine C
max after SGI-110 relative to decitabine IV infusion might improve safety for toxicities 
associated with peak decitabine concentrations.  
During the FIH Phase 1 SGI-110-01 Dose Escalation, potent DNA demethylation, CR and other 
clinical responses were observed in heavily pretreated subjects with AML and MDS, including those previously treated with other existing HMAs (decitabine and azacitidine). 
In the Phase 2 SGI-110-01 Dose Expansion, 51 elderly subjects with AML who had other poor 
prognostic features and were not eligible for intensive chemotherapy received SGI-110. The observed CR rate of 33% and CRc rate of 55% exceeded those observed for currently available therapies in randomized, multicenter studies (see Table 9 ). Due to heterogeneity of subjects in 
single-center, nonrandomized studies with the consequent risk of selection bias, we selected recently published, randomized, multicenter studies of agents commonly used as standard of care for elderly patients with AML. Data in Table 9  indicate that SGI-110 may improve efficacy over 
other therapies for this AML patient population.

2.2 Rationale for SGI-110 Dose and Regimen 
The dose and regimen of SGI-110 proposed for this Phase 3 study is based on dose-response data 
evaluated from all PK, PD, efficacy, and safety information available from Phase 1 and 2 investigations. 
2.2.1 PK Dose Assessment 
PK profiles from 85 subjects who received doses ranging from 3 to 125 mg/m
2 showed that the 
dose levels of 60 and 90 mg/m2 bracket the AUC expected from active metabolite decitabine at 
the FDA-approved dose of 20 mg/m2 of decitabine IV. Decitabine AUCs resulting from

2.2.2 PD Dose Assessment: LINE-1 DNA Methylation 
In the SGI-110-01 Dose Escalation study, we assessed weekly LINE-1 DNA methylation in 
Cycle 1 as a surrogate of global DNA methylation and biological activity in 65 subjects on either the Daily×5 schedule (35 subjects) or the Once Weekly schedule (30 subjects) over a range of 8 dose levels: 3, 9, 18, 36, 60, 90, or 125 mg/m
2/day). Data showed superior dose-
dependent-biological activity of the Daily×5 schedule over the Once Weekly schedule (Figure 1 ). Of 35 subjects on the Daily×5 schedule, dose-dependent increase in demethylation 
occurred up to 60 mg/m
2/day with no further demethylation at higher doses. These data support 
an increase in DNA demethylation up to 60 mg/m2/day on Days 1-5 ( Figure 1 ). 
Maximum demethylation at 60 mg/m2/day for 5 days met the prospectively defined BED 
endpoint in the Phase 1 study. This observation was later confirmed in the Phase 2 randomization between 60 and 90 mg/m
2/day on Days 1-5, where in 93 AML patients (49 with 
treatment-naïve elderly AML and 44 with relapse d/refractory AML), there was no significant 
difference in LINE-1 demethylation between 60 and 90 mg/m2 Daily×5 ( Figure 2 ).

2.2.3.1 Daily×5 Regimen in AML 
We conducted a randomized, dose-response, Phase 2 study in 101 subjects with AML 
(51 treatment-naïve elderly and 50 relapsed/refractory) that compared therapy with 60 versus 90 mg/m
2/day SGI-110 on Days 1-5 (see also Section 1.3.2.2). While the CR rate differed 
between the 2 different AML subject populations, efficacy of the 2 doses was remarkably similar (Table 12 ). Compared with the 60 mg/m
2/day dose, the 90 mg/m2/day dose showed increased 
Grade 3 febrile neutropenia and pneumonia in relapsed/refractory AML subjects, and increased 
Grade 3 neutropenia in treatment-naïve AML subjects ( Table 13 ). Overall, the incidence of 
AEs Grade 3 was similar between the doses. Mortality rates were low overall at both dose 
levels ( Table 14 ). In conclusion, with the Daily×5 regimen, the dose of 60 mg/m2/day is selected 
based on similar efficacy to the higher dose of 90 mg/m2/day and potential for lower toxicity.

2.2.3.2 10-day Regimen in AML 
The results of the 10-day regimen using 60 mg/m2/day in relapsed/refractory AML are 
presented in Section 1.3.2.2.2  (Table 6 , Table 7 , and Table 8 ). While the 10-day regimen 
showed a trend toward improved response rate in relapsed/refractory AML, it also resulted in 
more myelosuppression. Study of treatment-naïve elderly AML subjects with the 10-day regimen of SGI-110 is ongoing, but emerging preliminary data suggest that response rates are unlikely to be significantly higher than those observed with the Daily×5 regimen (CRc of 55%) and that the toxicity of the 10-day regimen in these older subjects could be more pronounced. The results of the 10-day regimen in these subjects after at least 3 months follow-up showed a CRc and CR of only 44% and 25%, respectively (compared with 55% and 33%, respectively, for the 5-day regimen) with higher 60-day all-cause mortality of 19.2% (compared with 15.7% for the 5-day regimen). In addition, the safety database at the time of analysis shows drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs) of 42% (compared to 16% for the 5-day regimen). Based on absence of higher response rate and the trend of higher early mortality and drug-related SAEs with the 10-day regimen in elderly subjects who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy, the 5-day regimen is selected as the one associated with the best benefit-risk in this population. Higher response rates and favorable safety for the SGI-110 Daily×5 regimen compared with other treatments have already been observed in the proposed study population (Section 2.1, 
Table 9 ), so it is reasonable to propose this regimen in the phase 3 study. 
2.2.4 Dose Selection Conclusion from Phase 1 and 2 Study 
The SGI-110 Daily×5 regimen at 60 mg/m
2/day provides the best benefit-risk ratio for the 
treatment of treatment-naïve elderly AML s ubjects based on available data. This regimen is 
supported by PK, PD, efficacy, and safety data from Study SGI-110-01. Results were similar 
but not demonstrably better at the 90 mg/m2 dose level, and based on potential dose-limiting 
myelosuppression, the 60 mg/m2 dose level is likely to be better tolerated over time.

Data will be reviewed by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) at regular intervals 
primarily to evaluate safety during study conduct. Refer to Section 4.4. 
The co-primary endpoints will be CR rate and OS. If either of the co-primary efficacy endpoints reaches statistical significance in favor of SGI-110 at either the interim analysis (OS only) or final analysis (CR and OS), then the study will be considered positive in efficacy. Randomization and analyses will be stratified by age, ECOG performance status (see Appendix 1 ), study center 
region, and secondary AML or poor-risk cytogenetics (see Appendix 2 ).

Confidential Information 37 6 March 2015  4.2 Discussion of Study Design 
This trial compares SGI-110 and TC for treatment of subjects with AML who are not considered 
candidates for intensive remission induction chemotherapy at the time of enrollment. While the 7+3 intensive chemotherapy for remission induction with potential for hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) has been an established standard of care for decades in patients who are fit to receive this intensive treatment, there is no standard of care or universally approved therapies for treatment of AML patients who are not candidates for standard intensive remission induction chemotherapy. For these patients, goals of therapy are to prolong and improve quality of life by inducing complete remission for as long as possible, as well as to avoid treatment-induced early mortality.  
Eligibility for this trial is based on precedented criteria of unsuitability for intensive remission 
induction chemotherapy ( Ferrara et al 2013 ; Kantarjian et al 2006 ; Kantarjian et al 2010 ) and 
other randomized trials in a similar patient population ( Burnett et al 2007; Kantarjian, Thomas et 
al 2012 ; Dombret et al 2014 ). The co-primary endpoints for this trial are CR rate and OS.  
FDA has accepted durable CR in hematological malignancies as an established surrogate for 
clinical benefit because patients who achieve durable CR have been shown to survive longer than those who do not ( Appelbaum et al 2007 ). Numerous studies have demonstrated that subjects 
achieving CR survive longer than subjects not achieving CR ( Sievers et al 2001 ; Larson et al 
2005; de Greef et al 2005 ; Kantarjian et al 2003 ). FDA has also granted regular approval for 
treatment of hematologic malignancies on the basis of durable CR. In these settings, durable CRs 
were considered an established surrogate for a better life and possibly a longer life ( Johnson et al 
2003).  
The trial includes a co-primary endpoint of OS to confirm no decrement in survival from severe 
toxicity. Secondary endpoints include CRc (CR+CRi+CRp) rate, NDAOH, PFS, number of transfusions, health-related QOL, duration of CR, and safety.  
TC, the control therapy for this study, includes treatments listed in Section 4.1. These therapies 
have not been compared directly, and regional treatment standards vary. Hence, all of these are 
allowed. All TC comparators are approved regimens for these agents mainly for other indications but have shown evidence of efficacy and safety from randomized trials in AML patient populations similar to the study population ( Burnett et al 2007 ; Kantarjian, Thomas et al 2012 ; 
Dombret et al 2014 ). Each country will use the TC option(s) that are locally approved. 
This study is open-label. It is difficult to conduct such a trial in a blinded fashion because of the significant differences in the treatment schedules and the multiple treatment choices. The risk of observer bias can be controlled effectively by a central pathologist and a central response reviewer, who will be blinded to treatment assignment and independent (Section 6.2). OS 
endpoint is not prone to observer bias.

The DMC will independently analyze accumulating data and make recommendations to the sponsor and the Study Steering Committee (SSC), as needed, to modify or discontinue the trial. DMC reviews will occur approximately each 6 months and as needed following study initiation until the final analyses. The DMC will also conduct independent interim analysis of OS as detailed in Section 11.0 and in a separate DMC Charter. 
The DMC will not stop the trial early based on the observed difference in CR. 
Details of DMC membership, responsibilities, meeting frequency and format, review materials, 
and communication plan will also be described in the DMC Charter. 
4.5 Study Steering Committee (SSC) 
An SSC composed of the lead investigators in the different study center regions, and sponsor

It is important to obtain protocol-specified follow-up information on any subject discontinued 
from study treatment. Section 10.0 describes follow-up for AEs. At minimum, subjects should be 
followed up for safety until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment (ie, discontinuation of treatment in the study) (see Section 10.2). 
5.4.2 Withdrawal from the Study 
Subjects may withdraw consent for the study at any time, or subjects may be lost to follow-up. It 
is important to obtain follow-up information, according to standard medical practice, on any subject withdrawn prematurely from the study. Every effort must be made to undertake at least standard assessments that are critical for efficacy or safety evaluation, such as disease progression (if the subject did not withdraw because of disease progression), subsequent anti-leukemia treatment, survival information, and safety data. 
The investigator must also ensure the subject understands that his or her medical records will 
continue to be available for the follow-up period as described in the approved informed consent form (ICF) for the entire study period. 
5.4.3 Replacement of Subjects 
Subjects will not be replaced in this study.

Confidential Information 42 6 March 2015  6.0 ENROLLMENT, RANDOMIZATION, AND BLINDING PROCEDURES 
Subjects will be screened at each study center for assessment of eligibility for the study. Each 
subject will be assigned a unique number (subject number) which will comprise the center number and the assigned subject number within the center. This number will be used to identify the subject throughout the study. 
6.1 Randomization 
Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to study treatment. Treatment assignments for the 
individual subjects will be determined through a computer generated randomization scheme and accessed through an interactive response system. Instructions for access and use of the interactive response system for randomization will be provided to participating study centers separately. Randomization will be 1:1 between SGI-110 and TC groups, and will be stratified by age (<75 or 75 years), ECOG performance status (0-1 or 2-3; see Appendix 1  for the ECOG 
criteria), study center region (North America, Europe, rest of world [ROW]), and secondary AML (secondary to MDS or other antecedent hematologic disorder) or poor-risk cytogenetics (either, neither; see Appendix 2 ). Selection of 1 of the TCs must be made prior to the 
randomization of each subject. Subjects should receive study treatment as soon as possible after randomization (maximum of 1 week between randomization and treatment). 
6.2 Blinding 
The sponsor, investigators and study subjects are not blinded in this study. However, to minimize 
the potential bias associated with assessment of treatment outcome, response will be determined by a blinded independent central response reviewer, based on assessment by a blinded independent central pathologist. Refer to Section 11.6. The specific process used for handling 
test samples and reports will be described separately.  
7.0 STUDY TREATMENTS 
SGI-110 is the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) (Section 7.1), and Treatment Choice 
(TC) is the active comparator (Section 7.2). 
7.1 Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP): SGI-110 SGI-110 chemical name: Sodium ( 2R,3S,5R )-5-(4-amino-2-oxo-1,3,5-triazin-1(2 H)-yl)-2 
(hydroxymethyl) tetrahydrofuran-3-yl (( 2R,3S,5R )-5-(2-amino-6-oxo-1 H-purin-9(6 H)-yl)-3-
hydroxytetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methyl phosphate 
7.1.1 IMP Information 
SGI-110 product is supplied in a two-vial configuration.

Confidential Information 43 6 March 2015  SGI-110 for Injection, 100 mg is a glass vial containing lyophilized SGI-110 drug powder for 
reconstitution and SC injection using the custom diluent supplied in a separate vial. Each vial is 
stoppered and sealed with a flip-off cap.  
SGI-110 Diluent for Reconstitution, 3 mL is a glass vial with 3 mL of custom diluent. Each vial 
is stoppered and sealed with a flip-off cap. The diluent comprises 3 commonly used excipients, 
propylene glycol, glycerin, and ethanol, that are generally recognized as safe. 
Store the SGI-110 for Injection, 100 mg vial, in the original packaging, refrigerated (2°C to 8°C) 
in a secure, locked facility accessible only to authorized study personnel until use. Store SGI-110 
Diluent for Reconstitution, 3 mL at 2°C to 30°C in the upright position until use. Both vials are 
preservative free and for single use only. The sponsor will retest the SGI-110 at regular intervals, 
according to ICH guidelines, and if warranted, the expiration date will be extended and 
documented accordingly. 
The sponsor recommends following Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 
Guidelines for handling cytotoxic drugs outlined in Yodaiken and Bennett 1986  or similar 
institutional or country-specific guidelines. Preparation should occur according to institutional practice. For skin contact or spillage, refer to the material safety data sheet (MSDS) for treatment options. 
Reconstituted drug product is intended for SC administration at a recommended concentration of 
100 mg/mL.  
7.1.2 SGI-110 Regimens and Administration 
The SGI-110 regimen for this study is 60 mg/m
2 given Daily×5 (Days 1-5 in a 28-day cycle) for 
at least 6 cycles in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or AML progression for which the 
investigator intends to offer an alternative therapy. Beyond 6 cycles, treatment should continue as long as the subject continues to benefit based on investigator judgment. In the ongoing phase 2 dose expansion study (Section 1.3.2.2), some subjects responded late to treatment: of 
51 treatment-naïve elderly AML subjects, 2 subjects responded, and another 2 subjects improved their response status from CRi or CRp to CR, after more than 6 treatment cycles with SGI-110. 
Administer SGI-110 by SC injection, preferably in the abdominal area, upper thigh, or arm. The 
total amount (in mg) of SGI-110 to be administered is determined by body surface area (BSA). In calculating BSA, use actual heights and weights. Do not adjust to "ideal" body weight. The institutional standard for calculating BSA is acceptable.  
Take care to avoid intradermal injection, as  this may result in injection site pain  
(see Section 8.0).  
Additional guidelines regarding SC injection will be detailed in the study procedures manual.

Clinical Protocol SGI-110-04    EUDRACT 2014-001233-89 
Confidential Information 44 6 March 2015  Investigators are prohibited from supplying SGI-110 to any subject not enrolled in this study or 
to any physicians or scientists except those designated as sub-investigators. The investigator must ensure that subjects receive SGI-110 only from personnel who fully understand the procedures for administering the study treatment. 
7.2 Treatment Choice (TC) Active Comparator  
TC will be one of the following treatment regimens (dose, schedule, and administration route) 
based on regimens approved by regulatory agencies, on published randomized studies, and on recommendations by the NCCN, European Leukemia Net, and European Society for Medical Oncology: 
•20 mg cytarabine given SC twice daily (BID) on Days 1-10 every 28 days. 
•20 mg/m
2 decitabine given IV daily on Days 1-5 every 28 days. 
•75 mg/m2 azacitidine given IV or SC daily on Days 1-7 every 28 days. 
Other use and treatment parameters of TC drugs (such as duration of treatment and dose 
adjustment guidelines) should follow locally approved prescribing information and institutional standard practice. 
Examples of locally approved prescribing information are the following: Cytarabine 2008 , 
Dacogen 2010, Vidaza 2014  (USA); and Cytarabine 20mg/ml 2014 , Dacogen 50 mg powder for 
concentrate for solution for infusion 2014 , Vidaza 25 mg/ml powder for suspension for injection 
2014 (UK). If a subject must discontinue TC study treatment, alternative therapy should be determined by 
the physician or institutional standard practice. Subjects randomly assigned to TC study treatment will not be allowed to receive SGI-110 as alternative therapy. 
7.3 Guidelines for Adjusting or Withholding Study Treatment 
7.3.1 Guidelines for SGI-110 
SGI-110 study therapy is intended to be administered for a minimum of 6 total cycles.  
It is recommended that the initial dose of SGI-110 is given on schedule (every 28 days) for the 
first 2 cycles without dose modification regardless of blood counts recovery to ensure initial dose intensity. Timing of cycle initiation and dose level of SGI-110 starting Cycle 3 will be guided by peripheral blood (PB) blast and neutrophil/platelet counts after the prior cycle, as indicated in Table 15 , which describes dose modification based on Day 29 or later PB counts.

For subjects with CRi or CRp for at least 2 cycles, SGI-110 treatment should be reduced 1 dose 
level at a time in each subsequent cycle until normal counts recover to levels of full CR (neutrophils 1000/ȝL and platelets 100,000/ȝL). The highest dose level that achieves normal 
counts recovery should be kept for subsequent cycles. Recommended reduced SGI-110 dose levels should be from 60 mg/m
2/day to 45 mg/m2/day, then to 30 mg/m2/day, and then to 
15 mg/m2/day with the Daily×5 regimen. 
Beyond 6 cycles, treatment should continue at the dose level reached as long as the subject continues to benefit based on investigator judgment and subject response and tolerability.  
7.3.2 Guidelines for TC 
For dose adjustment of TC therapies, refer to the latest locally-approved Prescribing Information 
for each therapy (USA examples: Cytarabine 2008 , Dacogen 2010, Vidaza 2014 ) in the relevant 
region. Dose adjustments should be made according to institutional standards and relevant locally approved Prescribing Information. 
7.4 Emergency Treatment for Subjects with Highly Proliferative Progressive AML 
This study allows enrollment of subjects with proliferative AML (total WBC count 20,000). 
For those subjects, pretreatment with hydroxyurea or leukapheresis before randomization may be 
warranted to decrease total WBC count. However, hydroxyurea, leukapheresis, or other anti-leukemia therapy is not allowed after subjects are randomly assigned to study treatment. After the first cycle of study treatment, subjects who continue to have rapidly increasing total WBC counts with increasing PB blasts % are allowed to start the next study treatment cycle earlier than Day 29. Early administration of study treatment allows such subjects to remain on study and potentially benefit from treatment. Benefit may require multiple cycles given the lower intensity treatments in this study (as compared with intensive remission induction therapy).  
Any deviation from the study schedule should be clearly explained and documented in the eCRF. 
After the proliferative phase subsides and the subject responds to treatment, the standard treatment cycle duration of 28 days should be resumed and maintained.

Clinical Protocol SGI-110-04    EUDRACT 2014-001233-89 
Confidential Information 46 6 March 2015  7.5 Concomitant Treatment 
On the concomitant medication CRF/eCRF, document all medications a subject takes, starting 
from 14 days before randomization and ending 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. Include supportive or palliative treatment (see below), whether prescription or nonprescription, and medications taken for procedures (eg, biopsy). Include start and stop dates and indication.  
7.5.1 Supportive, Prophylactic, or Other Treatments 
The investigator is permitted to prescribe supportive treatment(s) at his or her discretion. 
Appropriate hydration and supportive care, including blood and platelet transfusions, may be administered according to study-center standards. Aggressive surveillance, prophylaxis, and/or treatment of bacterial, fungal, viral, and opportunistic infections are essential to prevent morbidity and mortality. Any supportive treatment or infusion should be documented in the provided CRFs/eCRFs. 
7.5.1.1 Antibiotics or Anti-fungals 
Antibiotics and/or anti-fungals may be used to manage febrile neutropenia based on institutional 
standard practice.  
7.5.1.2 Hematopoietic Growth Factors 
Use is permitted if deemed to be medically necessary by the treating physician and should be 
guided by accepted practice or institutional guidelines. 
7.5.1.3 Hydroxyurea and/or Leukapheresis 
Hydroxyurea and/or leukapheresis will be allowed for all subjects before randomization to 
reduce WBC counts in subjects with highly proliferative disease. Hydroxyurea and leukapheresis are prohibited after randomization. If, after initiation of study treatment, a subject's disease remains highly proliferative, where WBC counts and blast % are high and start to rise again before Day 28, the investigator may administer the subsequent treatment cycle earlier than Day 28 as described in Section 7.4. This should be documented in the eCRF. 
7.5.2 Prohibited Concomitant Treatment 
Other anticancer therapies, unless specified in the protocol, are not to be used. Cytotoxic 
chemotherapy and investigational treatments are prohibited for as long as subjects remain on study treatment. 
Vaccination with live vaccines is prohibited while subjects remain on study treatment.

Confidential Information 47 6 March 2015  7.6 Overdose Instructions 
Record the actual dose of study drug administered in the source document and on the Dosing 
CRF/eCRF. Record any adverse clinical signs and symptoms associated with a potential overdose on the AE CRF/eCRFs. Report signs and symptoms of a potential overdose that meet serious adverse event (SAE) criteria (defined in Section 10.1.2) to Astex on the SAE form within 
24 hours (see Section 10.3). Treat any AE (including SAE) based on standard care for the 
specific signs and symptoms.  
8.0 RISKS/PRECAUTIONS 
Refer to the SGI-110 IB for the most current risks and precautions, as well as a complete list of 
AEs considered expected with SGI-110 therapy. 
Common AEs observed in the AML/MDS population treated with SGI-110 include injection site 
AEs, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, diarrhea, fatigue, and nausea. The most common SAEs were febrile neutropenia and pneumonia. MDS and AML subjects commonly have severely compromised BM and blood counts. Severe or prolonged myelosuppression have been reported as related to SGI-110, particularly on high doses (ie, 125 mg/m
2). Two 
AML/MDS subjects (1 MDS and 1 AML of 357 subjects total) treated with SGI-110 had drug-related SAEs of sepsis with an outcome of death at doses of 125 mg/m
2/day for 5 days (MDS) 
and 18 mg/m2/day for 5 days (AML). 
Refer to Section 7.3 for guidelines to adjust study treatment dose. 
Injection site reactions, such as pain, irritation, inflammation, erythema, and burning have been reported in the AML/MDS population and in subjects with solid tumors. Injection site reactions are related to SGI-110 SC administration. Care must be taken to avoid intradermal injection. Administer SGI-110 by slow SC injection. If injection site pain is reported upon injection, apply ice packs to the injection site both before and after injection. If injection site AEs are reported at subsequent injections despite slow injection and use of ice packs, pretreatment with topical or systemic analgesics can be considered. 
Use of decitabine, the active metabolite of SGI-110, alters fertility and is mutagenic. Because of 
the possibility of infertility, men should seek advice on conservation of sperm, and women of child-bearing potential should seek consultation regarding oocyte cryopreservation before study treatment is started. 
For risks and benefits of TC therapies, refer to the latest locally-approved Prescribing 
Information for each therapy (USA examples: Cytarabine 2008 , Dacogen 2010, Vidaza 2014 ).

Confidential Information 48 6 March 2015  9.0 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 
9.1 Eligibility 
Eligibility will be assessed by the investigator for the purpose of randomization and study entry; 
however, AML diagnosis will be confirmed by the central pathologist. Investigators are encouraged to request central pathologist confirmation of eligibility before randomization if they believe the AML diagnosis would be in doubt. Such confirmation will minimize the number of subjects the central pathologist may deem as having unconfirmed AML. 
9.2 Efficacy 
PB will be assessed at screening and on Day 1 of each cycle for response evaluation. BM 
aspirate or biopsy will be performed at screening then at the end of Cycles 2, 4, and 6 (Day 1 of Cycles 3, 5, and 7) unless PB shows persistence of leukemic blasts that excludes the possibility of a marrow response. After Cycle 6 BM assessment (Day 1 of Cycle 7), BM aspirate/biopsy will be repeated every 3 months for the first year on study and then every 6 months thereafter until PB or BM assessment shows disease progression or relapse. 
CR will be assessed by modified IWG 2003 AML Response Criteria (see Section 11.6), 
based on blood sampling and BM aspirate/biopsy. Response assessment will be based on BM 
blinded review and the most concomitant PB counts. After blinded BM response is confirmed, assessment of normal count recovery will be done based initially on the most concomitant PB counts and in later cycles on PB counts from Day 1 of each cycle to avoid transient treatment-induced normal count suppression. The central pathologist who evaluates BM and PB counts for response assessment, as well as the central response reviewer, will be blinded to treatment assignment (Section 6.2).  
9.3 Pharmacokinetics 
PK parameters will be assessed using population PK analysis. At selected study centers, sparse 
PK samples will be collected within windows at the time points specified below (with time of sampling recorded). 
For subjects who receive SGI-110, blood sample collection will be assigned to the following 
time points:  
•Cycle 1, Day 1, at 1.5 hours (±30 minutes) and 3 hours (±1 hour) postdose.  
(1.5-hours sample is intended to be time-matched with the on-treatment ECG evaluation.) 
AND 
•Cycle 1, Day 5, at 1 hour (±30 minutes) and 5 hours (±2 hours) postdose. 
For subjects in the TC group receiving decitabine IV, blood sample collection will be assigned to 
one of the following time points:

OR 
•Cycle 1, Day 5, immediately before the end of infusion (at 1 hour); and at 5 minutes 
(±2 minutes) and 3 hours (±1 hour) after the end of infusion. 
9.4 Safety 
Safety assessments will be based on AEs, concomitant medications, physical examination, vital 
signs, ECOG status, electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements, and clinical laboratory parameters (hematology and chemistry). 
9.5 Study Procedures 
9.5.1 Schedule of Events 
Table 16 presents the complete schedule of events for the study, with details following in text. 
Additional information on the study procedures is provided in the study procedures manual.  
Clinical and diagnostic laboratory evaluations are detailed before study entry, throughout the 
study, and at the follow-up evaluation. The purpose of obtaining these detailed measurements is to ensure adequate assessments of efficacy, safety, and tolerability. Repeat clinical evaluations and laboratory studies more frequently if clinically indicated. 
Note any deviation from protocol procedures. Investigators are responsible for implementing 
appropriate measures to prevent the recurrence of vio lations and deviations and to report to their 
Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) according to policy.

a. Screening (and Randomization):  Screening must occur within 14 days of randomization, except that BM aspirate/bi opsy and molecular genetics/cytogenetics will be 
collected within 28 days before Cycle 1 Day 1. Randomization should occur as close as possible to Cycle 1 Day 1 and may occur o n Cycle 1 Day 1. A maximum of 1 week 
between randomization and treatment is allowed. 
b. Study Treatment : Dosing days are consecutive according to approved prescribing information.  
c. Treatment discontinuation and safety  follow-up (Tx Dsc Safety FU) visit:  Must occur 30 (+7) calendar days after the last  dose of study treatment. If the subject cannot 
attend the clinic, the visit may be conducted by telephone to collect, at minimum, AE information. 
d. Long-term follow-up visits:  Start after treatment discontinuation. Monthly (±7 days) visits  are required for subjects who discontinue study treatment befo re Cycle 6, until 
6 months after the start of study treatment . After monthly visits for at least 6 mont hs, long-term follow-up visits will be eve ry 3 months (±2 weeks) until death. Health-related 
QOL, hospitalizations, and transfusions are d one only at monthly visits. Hematology, BM  aspirate or biopsy, and disease progres sion assessment are done only for subjects 
who have not progressed at treatment discontinua tion. Visits may be conducted by telephone. 
e. Physical examination:  Complete physical examination includes weight and examination of body systems according to institutional standards. A complete physical 
examination is required. Day 1 physical  examination does not need to be repeated if it was done within 4 days.

QT correction method should be the same for all ECGs for a give n subject. Clinically significant abnormal ECG at study treatmen t discontinuation as compared to the predose 
ECG should be followed fo r recovery or stabilization. 
h. Health-related QOL : Administer EQ-5D-5L (see Appendix 4 ) before treatment on Day 1 of each cycle. For subjects who discontinue treatment before Cycle 6, administer 
EQ-5D-5L at monthly visits until 6 months after the start of study treatment. Not required for visits every 3 months in long-te rm follow-up. 
i. Weight and  BSA (body surface area) calculation:  Weigh subjects on Day 1 of each cycle. BSA recalculation is only required if weight changes ±10% or more from 
screening. 
j. Concomitant medications:  Document all concomitant medications within 14 days before ran domization to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. 
k. Hematology:  Include complete blood count w ith manual differential. Day 1 hematology for all cy cles does not need to be  repeated if done wi thin 4 days of Day 1. For 
Cycles >6, hematology will be required only on Day 1. Additional hematology assessment may be done for safety or for subject ma nagement at the inves tigator’s discretion. 
Collection, analysis, and reporting informati on are described in the Study Lab Manual. 
l. Serum chemistry:  Refer to Table 17 . Day 1 chemistry for all cycles does not need to be repeated if done within 4 days of  Day 1. Additional chemistry assessment m ay be 
done for safety or for subject management  at the investigator’s d iscretion. Collection, analysis, an d reporting information are  described in the Study Lab Manual. 
m. Pregnancy test:  Women of child-bearing potential only. The screening test must be done within 7 days of Cycle 1 Day 1 (ie, Day -7 to -1); test  not required on Cycle 1 Day 1 
if done at screening. 
n. PK: At selected study centers: Subjects receiving SGI-110 and subjects in the TC group who receive decitabine IV in Cycle 1 only. Refer to Section 9.3 for details. 
o. Molecular genetics and cytogenetics: BM and blood samples will be collected with in 28 days before starting study treatme nt to evaluate cytogenetics (chromosome 
abnormalities) and gene mutations (such as FLT3-ITD, NPM1, CEBPA).  
p. BM aspirate or biopsy:  BM aspirate and/or biopsy differential count will be performed according to local standard practice. The screening aspirate mu st be collected within 
28 days before starting study treatment. If BM aspirate/biopsy was completed before consent for this study, center must be able  to obtain slides for central reader and samples 
for screening cytogenetic assessments. A biopsy  should be done if no spicules are observed in the aspirate. Marrow aspirate or biopsy differential may include the following: 
•Total cells counted 
•Blasts 
•Prom yelocytes  
•Myelocytes
 •Metamyelocytes 
•Segmented neutrophils 
•Eosinophils 
•Basophils •Lymphocytes 
•Plasma cells 
•Monocytes 
•Pronormoblasts •Normoblasts 
•M:E ratio

 •Megakaryocytes: increased, normal, decreased, absent 
•Presence of dysplasia: dysE, dysG, dysM 
•Cellularity: % cellularity: hypocellula r, hypercellular, normocellular  
•Other 
 Slides should be Wright Giemsa or May Grunwald Giemsa stained. Send 1 or 2 PB and BM slides for each subject at each time poin t. Detailed instructions on collection, 
labeling and shipping are described in the St udy Lab Manual. A BM sample adequate for an alysis must be obtained. Repeat the BM sample if not interpretable. 
 Response assessment is done on Day 1 of Cycles 2 based on BM aspirate/biopsy and the most concomitant PB. Assess PB at screening and on Day 1 of each cycle. Perform 
BM aspirate/biopsy at screening and then at the end of Cycles 2, 4, and 6 (ie, Day 1 of Cycles 3, 5, and 7 [±7-day window]) unl ess PB shows persistence of leukemic blasts 
that excludes the possibility of a marrow response. After blinded BM response is confirmed, assessment of normal count recovery  is done based initially on the most 
concomitant PB counts and in later cycles on PB counts from Day 1 of each cycle to avoid transient treatment-induced normal cou nt suppression. Subjects who discontinue 
treatment before Cycle 6 Day 1 before documented disease prog ression must undergo response assessment until disease progression  or relapse is confirmed. After Cycle 6,

Confidential Information 60 6 March 2015 10.0 EVALUATION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS 
10.1 Definitions 10.1.1 Adverse Event (AE) 
Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal finding in laboratory tests or other diagnostic procedures), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An AE can arise from any use of the drug and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
Disease progression is not considered to be an AE or SAE. If there are specific AEs that are 
always part of disease progression, these do not need to be reported as AEs or SAEs. Pre-existing medical conditions (other than natural progression of the disease being studied) judged by the investigator or subject to have worsened in severity or frequency or changed in character during the protocol-specified AE reporting period will be reported as AEs or SAEs as appropriate. 
An AE or SAE can also be a complication that occurs as a result of protocol mandated 
procedures (eg, invasive procedures such as biopsies). 
10.1.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
An AE is considered serious, if in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any 
of the following outcomes: 
•Death. 
•A life-threatening AE. An AE is considered "life-threatening" if in  the view of either the investigator, or sponsor, its 
occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had 
it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
•Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization.  
•A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions. 
•A congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based on the appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition of SAE. Examples of such medical events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. For clarification, Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias that are not associated with a life-threatening or otherwise medically

Clinical Protocol SGI-110- 04  EUDRACT 2014-001233-89 
Confidential Information 61 6 March 2015 significant clinical AE as defined above, and do not result in hospitalization, are not considered 
SAEs. 
10.2 Adverse Event Reporting and Descriptions 
Record new AEs from the start of study treatment until 30 days after the last dose of study 
treatment (ie, discontinuation of treatment in the study) or until the subject starts new anti-leukemic treatment, including new investigational treatment. Also record screening procedure-related AEs that occur before the start of study treatment. 
Record all treatment-emergent AEs (AEs occurring after the start of study treatment) either 
observed by the investigator or one of his or her medical collaborators, or reported by the subject spontaneously, or in response to the direct question below, in the AEs section of the subject's CRF/eCRF, in the source document, and if applicable, record on the SAE form. Whenever possible, the investigator should group signs and symptoms (including laboratory tests or other results of diagnostic procedures) into a single diagnosis under a single term. For example, cough, rhinitis, and sneezing might be reported as "upper respiratory infection" or a pulmonary infiltrate, positive sputum culture and fever might be reported as "pneumonia." 
To optimize consistency of AE reporting across centers, ask the subject a standard, general, non-
leading question to elicit any AEs (such as "Have you had any new symptoms, injuries, illnesses since your last visit?").  
Death is an outcome of an SAE and usually not itself an SAE, unless it is death with no 
identifiable cause or event. In all other cases, record the cause of death as the SAE. Investigators will assess the status of previously reported, and occurrence of new, AEs and SAEs at all subject evaluation time points during the study. 
10.2.1 Severity 
Use the definitions found in the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
v4.03 for grading the severity (intensity) of AEs ( Appendix 3). The CTCAE v4.03 displays 
Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each referenced AE. Should a subject experience any AE not listed in the CTCAE v4.03, use the following grading system to assess severity: 
•Grade 1 – Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated. 
•Grade 2 – Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL), such as preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc.

Clinical Protocol SGI-110- 04  EUDRACT 2014-001233-89 
Confidential Information 62 6 March 2015 •Grade 3 – Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADL, such as bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. 
•Grade 4 – Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
•Grade 5 – Death related to AE. 
10.2.2 Relationship to Study Treatment (Suspected Adverse Reactions) 
Assess all AEs/SAEs for relationship to study treatment or if applicable, to study procedure. 
If an AE/SAE occurs before the first dose of study treatment, report it only if it is considered 
related to a study-specific procedure (eg, bleeding or local infection after skin punch biopsy). Those events will be recorded in the study database but will not be part of the treatment- emergent AE analysis.  
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should apply the 
general guideline shown below. Multi-drug regimens should have a causality assessment of each component to aid in analysis. 
Related  (Suspected Adverse Reaction) A suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE such as a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and administration of the drug; and/or the AE follows a known pattern of response to the drug; and/or the AE abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the drug or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon rechallenge. Further examples of type of evidence that would suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE: 
•A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be 
strongly associated with drug exposure (eg, angioedema, hepatic injury, 
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome), 
•One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (eg, acute myocardial infarction in a young woman), 
•An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical study 
(such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition 
under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group that in a concurrent or historical control group.

10.2.3 Pregnancy and Abortion 
Report any pregnancy that occurs in a subject or male subject's female partner during the time 
between the first study-specific procedure and 60 days after the last dose of study treatment. Record any occurrence of pregnancy on the Pregnancy Report Form Part I and send to Astex Pharmaceuticals Drug Safety within 24 hours of learning of the event. After the birth of the baby, collect additional information on the baby until the baby is 1 year old by completing the Pregnancy Report Form Part II.  
A subject must immediately inform the investigator if the subject or subject's partner becomes 
pregnant during the time between the first study-specific procedure and 60 days after the last dose of study treatment. Any female subjects receiving study treatment who become pregnant must immediately discontinue study treatment. The investigator should counsel the subject, discussing any risks of continuing the pregnancy and any possible effects on the fetus. 
Report any abortion and the reason for it, whether therapeutic, elective, or spontaneous, to Astex 
Pharmaceuticals Drug Safety within 24 hours, through the SAE reporting process (Section 10.3). 
10.3 Reporting and Evaluation of Serious Adverse Events 
10.3.1 Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
All SAEs regardless of causality will be reported by the investigator to Astex Pharmaceuticals 
through the 30-day period after the last dose of study treatment. Deaths and SAEs occurring after the 30-day safety follow-up period AND considered related to study treatment or study procedures must also be reported. 
Report all SAEs (initial and follow-up information) on an SAE form and send the form to Astex 
Pharmaceuticals Drug Safety, or designee, within 24 hours of the discovery of the event or information (see below). Astex Pharmaceuticals may request follow-up and other additional information from the investigator (eg, hospital admission or discharge notes, laboratory results).

Confidential Information 64 6 March 2015 If study treatment is discontinued, temporarily suspended, or dose reduced because of an SAE, 
include this information in the SAE report. 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) are SAEs that qualify for 
mandatory expedited reporting to regulatory authorities where the SAE is suspected to be caused by the study treatment and is considered unexpected (ie, not defined as expected in the current IB, clinical study protocol, or approved labeling for marketed drugs). In this case, Astex Pharmaceuticals Drug Safety or designee will report to the relevant regulatory authorities and forward a formal notification describing the SUSAR to investigators, according to regulatory requirements. Each investigator must then notify his or her IRB/IEC of the SUSAR as required by local regulatory authorities and in accordance with IRB/IEC policy. 
10.4 Follow-up for Adverse Events 
Follow-up all AEs and SAEs assessed as related to study treatment or study procedures that are 
encountered during the protocol-specified AE reporting period (1) to resolution, (2) until the investigator assesses the subject as stable and the event is following a clinically expected outcome, or (3) until the subject is lost to follow-up or withdraws consent. 
11.0 STATISTICS 
Statistical analyses will be performed by Astex Pharmaceuticals or its designee. 
Data summaries and listings will be generated using SAS version 9.3 or a more recent version 
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). 
The statistical analysis plan and/or the clinical study report will provide additional details of the 
analysis, which may include details of missing and, if applicable, unused data, as well as additional sensitivity analyses of the primary and secondary variables. The clinical study report will describe deviations from the statistical analysis plan, if any. 
11.1 Sample Size 
By trial design, the overall (2-sided) alpha level of 0.05 is split between the co-primary endpoints 
of CR (0.04) and OS (0.01). A formal interim analysis will be performed only for OS using a group sequential boundary preserving an overall (2-sided) 0.01 alpha level. The sample size calculation for the primary analysis of CR is based on testing at the 0.04 nominal alpha level. If statistical significance is achieved for CR, hierarchically, the final analysis of OS will be conducted to preserve an overall 2-sided 0.05 alpha level, accounting for alpha spent at the interim analysis of OS, as described in Section 11.6.7 and Section 11.9. The sample size 
calculation for OS will be shown for the setting of a 2-sided 0.05 alpha level. 
Assuming a CR rate of approximately 0.20 ( Kantarjian, Thomas et al 2012 ; Fenaux et al 2010 ; 
Burnett et al 2007 ) for subjects treated in the TC group (all TC therapies combined) and 
assuming an increase in CR rate to 0.30 or higher can be achieved by treating subjects with

Confidential Information 65 6 March 2015 SGI-110, 800 subjects (400 per treatment group) will provide approximately 89% power to 
detect the overall difference of 0.10 when using a 2-sided Cochran Mantel-Haenszel test having 2-sided alpha level of 0.04. For the purpose of this sample size calculation, the constant CR rates of 0.20 and 0.30 for the TC and SGI-110 groups, respectively, are assumed for each stratum. 
For survival, an analysis at 670 death events will provide 90% power to detect a hazard ratio of 
approximately 0.78 (a difference in median survival of 7 months in the TC group versus 9 months in the SGI-110 group), when using a 2-sided stratified log-rank test at an 0.05 alpha level. Accrual is expected to be uniform over a 21 month enrollment period, with an additional follow-up of 12 months. Hence, the assessment of survival needs approximately the same sample size of 800 subjects. Primary response and survival analyses will be performed after 670 death events have occurred. For the purpose of this samp le size calculation, a c onstant hazard ratio of 
approximately 0.78 was assumed for all strata defined by the stratification factors. 
11.2 Data Sets to be Analyzed 
11.2.1 Efficacy 
Efficacy analyses will be based on intent-to-treat (ITT) principle. The efficacy data set will 
include data from all subjects randomly assigned to study treatment. All data will be included and no subjects excluded because of protocol violations. For the analysis of efficacy data, subjects will be included in the treatment group according to their randomly assigned treatment. A secondary efficacy dataset will be analyzed for the co-primary endpoints of CR and OS based on treatment actually received. 
For NDAOH, transfusions, and health-related QOL by EQ-5D-5L datasets, the primary analysis 
will include only the data collected during the first 6 months of the study because, during this study period, subjects are assessed whether or not they are still on study treatment. Secondary analysis datasets may also be analyzed (eg, over the period of study treatment). 
11.2.2 Safety 
The safety data set will include data from all subjects randomly assigned to study treatment who 
receive any amount of study treatment or any component of a multi-dose study treatment regimen. All data will be included and no subjects excluded because of protocol violations. 
For safety data analysis, subjects will be included in the treatment group according to the 
treatment they actually receive. 
11.2.3 Pharmacokinetics 
The PK data set will include all available plasma concentrations and PK parameters for SGI-110 
and decitabine from subjects at selected centers who have received SGI-110 or decitabine IV and for whom PK samples were collected and successfully analyzed. PK data will be analyzed using the PK data set.

Confidential Information 66 6 March 2015 11.2.4 Pharmacodynamics Analyses 
Pharmacodynamics analyses are not applicable to this study. 
11.3 Schedule of Analyses 
Data listings and summary tables will be reviewed by the DMC approximately every 6 months to 
ensure the safety of study subjects and to enhance the quality of trial conduct (refer to Section 4.4). An interim analysis of OS will also be conducted by the DMC when approximately half of the required death events have occurred. All available study data will be analyzed after 670 death events have occurred to achieve a mature analysis of OS. 
11.4 Disposition 
The number and percentage (n, %) of subjects enrolled, treated, lost to follow-up, and withdrawn 
(with reason) will be summarized. Sample size for efficacy and safety analysis data sets will be clearly identified for each treatment group. All screened subjects will be included in the disposition analysis. 
11.5 Analysis of Demographic and Baseline Data 
Subject demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables; and by counts and percentages for categorical variables. The Efficacy and Safety datasets will be used for the summaries. The summaries will be done for each treatment group and both treatment groups combined. 
11.6 Efficacy Analyses 
Efficacy analyses will be based on the Efficacy dataset. Unless otherwise specified, this section 
describes the analyses conducted at the primary analysis time point when 670 death events have occurred, assuming that the study continued after the planned interim analysis. The alpha levels referenced in this section are nominal alpha levels for judging statistical significance, taking into consideration the planned interim analysis and the hierarchical testing order of the (final) primary analysis. The overall experimental alpha error is controlled at the 2-sided 0.05 level. 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints are  •CR rate by modified IWG 2003 AML Response Criteria ( Cheson et al 2003 ) as described in 
Section 11.6.1. Assessments will be blinded as described in Section 11.6.1. 
•OS, defined as the number of days from randomization to death.  
If either of the co-primary efficacy endpoints reaches statistical significance in favor of SGI-110 
at either the interim analysis (OS only) or final analysis (CR and OS), then the study will be considered positive in efficacy.

Confidential Information 67 6 March 2015 Secondary efficacy endpoints are the following and will be defined in more detail in the 
statistical analysis plan: 
•CRc (CR+CRi+CRp) rate. 
•NDAOH. 
•PFS, defined as the number of days from randomization to disease progression or death, 
whichever occurs first. 
•Number of RBC or platelet transfusions (units) over the duration of the study treatment. 
•Health-related QOL by EQ-5D-5L (consisting of the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ Visual Analogue Scale [EQ VAS]). 
•Duration of CR, defined as the time from first CR to time of relapse. 
11.6.1 Criteria for Response Assessment 
Modified IWG 2003 Response Criteria ( Table 18 ) will be used by an independent blinded reader 
to identify AML subjects with CR, CRp, CRi, or partial response. BM biopsy/aspirate and 
corresponding concomitant PB counts will be assessed by a blinded central pathologist, and all assessments of response will be reviewed and confirmed by an independent blinded central reviewer (either the same person who assessed pathology or a different blinded independent reviewer).

Confidential Information 68 6 March 2015 •CR, CRp, CRi, partial response.  
•Composite CR (CRc=CR+CRp+CRi). 
Subjects who did not have a post-treatment efficacy assessment (ie, no BM or PB assessment) 
will be classified as nonevaluable for response presentations. These subjects will be included in the denominator of the ITT analysis for calculation of different response rates. Subjects who cannot be classified into a response category (CR, CRp, CRi, partial response) or the nonevaluable category will be classified as nonresponders. 
11.6.2 Complete Response (CR) 
The primary endpoint of CR rate will be calculated as the number of subjects with a best 
response of CR divided by the total number of subjects included in the efficacy analysis. The CR rate will be compared between the 2 treatment groups using a Cochran Mantel-Haenszel test at an alpha level of 0.04 stratified by age (<75 or 75 years), ECOG performance status (0-1 or 
2-3), study center region (North America, Europe, ROW), and secondary AML (secondary to MDS or other antecedent hematologic disorder) or poor-risk cytogenetics (either, neither). A 2-sided p value of 0.04 will be judged as statistically significant. In addition, the Mantel-
Haenszel weighted difference in CR rate between the 2 treatment groups and its 2-sided 96% CI will be provided.  
11.6.3 Overall Survival (OS) 
OS is defined as the number of days from the day the subject was randomly assigned to study 
treatment to the date of death (regardless of ca use). Survival time will be censored on the last 
date the subject is known alive or lost to follow-up before reaching the event of death. As a separate sensitivity analysis, survival time will also be censored on the date the subject receives other anti-leukemia therapy such as chemotherapy or HCT. 
OS will be estimated by a stratified Kaplan-Meier method and compared between the 2 treatment 
groups using a stratified log-rank test. If the CR rate analysis is significant, OS will be tested at an alpha level of 0.05; without a significant CR rate test result, OS will be tested at an alpha level of 0.01, as described in Section 11.6.7. The stratification variables will include age (<75 or 75 
years), ECOG performance status (0-1 or 2-3), study center region (North America, Europe, ROW), and secondary AML or poor-risk cytogenetics (either, neither). The medians and quartiles of OS will be summarized. 
In addition, the hazard ratio (HR) and the 95% (or 99%, as appropriate) CI will be estimated 
using a Cox proportional-hazard model with treatment group as the independent variable and stratified by the same randomization stratifica tion factors as used for the log-rank test. 
For the planned interim analysis, OS will be compared between the 2 treatment groups using a stratified log-rank test at an alpha level provide d by the Lan-DeMets implementation of the 
O’Brien-Fleming monitoring guideline, as described in Section 11.9.

Confidential Information 69 6 March 2015 11.6.4 Composite CR (CRc) 
The CRc rate is calculated as the number of subjects with a best response of CR, CRp, or CRi 
divided by the total number of subjects included in the efficacy analysis. The CRc rate will be compared between the 2 treatment groups using a Cochran Mantel-Haenszel test with the stratification variables the same as for CR and OS. If CR rate analysis and OS analysis are both significant, the CRc rate will be tested at an alpha level of 0.05; with a nonsignificant CR rate result (p >0.04) and a significant OS result at the 0.01 level, the CRc rate will be tested at an 
alpha level of 0.01. In addition, the 2-sided 95% (or 99%, as appropriate) CI for the Mantel-Haenszel weighted difference in CRc rate between the 2 treatment groups will be provided. 
11.6.5 Number of Days Alive and Out of the Hospital (NDAOH) 
The date of each hospital admission and discharge will be collected for each subject. The average 
NDAOH will be summarized by treatment group and compared between the 2 treatment groups using a 2-sample t-test at an alpha level of 0.05 or 0.01 as appropriate, if the CRc test result is significant at that required level. 
11.6.6 Progression-free Survival (PFS) 
Progression is defined as the earliest occurrence of one of the following: 
•For subjects with CR, CRi, or CRp, the confirmed (at least 2 PB samples at least 1 week 
apart) appearance of leukemic blasts in PB by investigator or central assessment, OR 5% 
leukemic blasts in the BM by blinded central pathologist assessment. 
•For all other subjects, when PB or BM shows evidence of continued increase in blasts % that necessitates alternative therapy. 
•Death. 
PFS is defined as the number of days from randomization to the earliest date of investigator's assessment of disease progression or relapse by PB assessment or blinded BM assessment, whichever occurs first, or death (regardless of cause). PFS time will be censored on the last date the subject is known to be alive without a relapse/disease progression. Subjects receiving other anti-leukemia therapy before occurrence of a relapse/ disease progression will also be censored at the date of the start of other anti-leukemia therapy. 
PFS will be compared between the 2 treatment groups using a stratified log-rank test at an alpha 
level of 0.05, or 0.01, as appropriate, if CRc and NDAOH test results are significant at that required level. The medians and quartiles of PFS will be summarized.

Confidential Information 70 6 March 2015 11.6.7 Test Sequence and Procedures of Statistical Tests for Efficacy Endpoints 
To control the alpha errors associated with testing the multiple endpoints of CR rate, OS, CRc 
rate, NDAOH, and PFS, the following test sequence and procedures will be followed, assuming that the study continues after the planned interim analysis. 
The primary efficacy variable CR rate will be tested first in the sequence at an alpha level of 
0.04. If this test is positive (ie, p0.04), then analysis will proceed to the test for the co-primary 
efficacy variable of OS at the 0.05 alpha level. A positive CR analysis ( p0.04) serves as a 
gatekeeper ( Westfall and Krishen 2001 ) for proceeding to the analysis of OS at the 0.05 level. If 
the test for CR is not significant at the 0.04 level, the co-primary efficacy variable of OS will be tested at an alpha level of 0.01.  
If the test for OS is positive at the 0.05 level, analysis will proceed to the test for the secondary 
efficacy variables of CRc rate, NDAOH, and PFS (in that order) at an alpha value of 0.05. For testing the secondary efficacy variables, CRc rate will be tested first. If the test for CRc rate is positive, then analysis will proceed to the test for NDAOH at the 0.05 alpha level; if the test for NDAOH is positive, then analysis will proceed to the test for PFS at a 0.05 alpha level. Similar to the primary endpoint analyses, a positive (ie, p<0.05) test result of a secondary endpoint tested 
earlier in the sequence serves as a gatekeeper for proceeding to the subsequent secondary analyses. If the test for CR is not significant at the 0.04 level, but the test for OS is significant at the 0.01 level, the secondary efficacy variables of CRc, NDAOH, and PFS will be tested hierarchically at an alpha level of 0.01. The hierarchical test order and alpha value to be used for each test at the primary analysis time point are further described in Figure 4 .

One transfusion is defined as 1 unit of RBC or 1 unit of platelets. Dates and the number of RBC 
or platelet transfusions will be collected for each subject. The average number of RBC or separately platelet transfusions per month will be summarized by treatment group. In addition, the number of RBC or platelet transfusions will also be summarized as a per-patient-year rate for each treatment group. The RR of these 2 per-patient-year rates (SGI-110 versus TC) and the associated 95% CI will be provided. 
11.6.9 EQ-5D-5L 
The calculation for EQ-5D-5L (EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and EQ VAS; Appendix 4) scores 
(health profile, self-rated health status, and index value) will be performed according to EuroQol 
group (http://www.euroqol.org/about-eq-5d.html; 2009). Change from baseline in EQ-5D-5L scores will be summarized by visit. A repeated measures analysis of variance model will be used to compare the groups for change from baseline in EQ-5D-5L scores.  
11.6.10 Duration of CR 
Duration of CR (in number of days) will be calculated from the first time a CR is observed to 
time of relapse (defined as the earliest time point whereby BM assessment or PB assessment [see Section 11.6.6] indicate relapse/disease progression due to reappearance of leukemic blasts in PB 
or 5% leukemic blasts in BM). The duration of CR will be censored at the last available time 
point at which a relapse/disease progression was not observed. Duration of CR will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method for subjects who achieved a CR during the study. To take the proportion of responders into consideration when analyzing duration of CR, a separate analysis including all subjects will be conducted with a 0-day event duration assigned to subjects who did not achieve a CR, with the 2 groups compared using a log-rank test. 
11.6.11 Subgroup Analyses 
Subgroup analyses will be performed to explore the influence of baseline variables, and the 
individual TC therapy administered, on the efficacy outcome of CR rate and OS, and to evaluate the treatment effect at different levels of each baseline variable. The analyses described in previous sections for these 2 outcome variables will be repeated for each level of the baseline variables and each TC therapy listed below: 
•Age (<75,  75). 
•AML category (primary, secondary). 
•Baseline cytogenetic risk (poor-risk, others). 
•Baseline ECOG PS (0-1 and 2-3). 
•Baseline BM blasts ( 30%, >30%). 
•Baseline total WBC counts (<20,000/ ȝL, 20,000/ȝL).

gene: yes, no). 
•Individual TC (cytarabine, decitabine, azacitidine) compared with SGI-110 treatment. 
•Additional subgroups may also be further described in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
11.7 Safety Analyses 
Safety will be assessed by subject-reported and investigator-observed AEs and 30- and 60-day 
all-cause mortality, along with physical examination, clinical laboratory tests (hematology, chemistries), and ECGs. Safety variables will be tabulated and presented for all subjects who receive any amount of study treatment (SGI-110 or TC). Exposure to study treatment, reasons for discontinuation, deaths and causes of deaths will be tabulated. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as events that first occurred or worsened after the first dose of study drug given on Cycle 1 Day 1. TEAEs will be mapped to the appropriate System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Severity of AEs will be graded using CTCAE version 4.03.  
Summaries will be provided for all AEs, AEs considered related to study treatment, SAEs, and 
related SAEs as follows: 
•By maximum severity.  
•Incidence by SOC (by severity grade and overall). 
•Incidence by PT (by severity grade and overall) within each SOC. 
The percentage of 30- and 60-day all-cause mortality will be calculated based on each subject's 
date of death relative to Course 1 Day 1 (C1D1; ie, date of death minus date of C1D1) and compared between the 2 treatment groups using a Chi-square test. 
Laboratory values reported by different local labs will be listed. Laboratory values will also be 
graded, if possible, by CTCAE in conjunction with the Harrison (18
th edition) lab book normals  
(Longo 2011). Shift tables will display (1) shift from baseline grade to the worst grade, and 
(2) shift from baseline grade to the last grade.  
Concomitant medication will be coded by the WHO Drug Dictionary and summarized by 
Therapeutic subgroup (ATC level 2) and PT, sorted alphabetically, using counts and percentages. Concomitant medications are the medications taken with a start date on or after the start of the administration of study treatment (C1D1), or those with a start date before the start of the administration of study treatment (C1D1) and a stop date on or after the start of the administration of study treatment (C1D1).

11.8 Pharmacokinetic Analyses 
PK parameters will be derived using noncompartmental analyses for each subject for whom 
sparse PK samples were collected and successfully analyzed. Descriptive statistics will include mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum for SGI-110 and decitabine PK parameters.
The relationship between  will be assessed based on the PK data and 
efficacy/safety data collected in this study. The methods will include a population PK modeling 
approach using the sparse data collected. The details of population PK modeling and full results of the  analyses will be reported in a separate document, and the summary of 
key findings will be included in the clinical study report. 
11.9 Interim Analysis 
One formal interim analysis of OS is planned. This interim analysis will be conducted by the 
independent DMC after approximately half (ie, approximately 335) of the required death events have occurred. The nominal alpha value for the interim and final OS analyses is based on Lan-DeMets implementation of the O’Brien-Fleming boundary ( Lan and DeMets 1983; O’Brien 
and Fleming 1979 ). With one interim analysis at 50% information time point plus one final 
analysis, the 2-sided alpha-boundaries are 0.00014 and 0.00995, respectively. If the trial continues after the interim analysis, and if the primary analysis of CR rate is significant at the 0.04 level, the alpha level for the primary analysis of OS will be 0.04+0.00995=0.04995 §0.05. If 
the trial continues after the interim analysis, and if the primary analysis of CR rate is not significant at the 0.04 level, the alpha value for the primary analysis of OS will be 0.00995 §0.01. 
The overall alpha error is controlled at the 0.05 level. 
Refer to Section 11.3 for further details on the schedule of analyses.

Confidential Information 77 6 March 2015 •Review the CRF/eCRFs and source documents to ensure that reported study data are 
accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents. 
•Verify that study treatments are stored properly and under the proper conditions, that they are in sufficient supply, and that receipt, use, and return of SGI-110 at the study centers are controlled and documented adequately. 
•Verify that the investigator and study center personnel remain adequately qualified throughout the study. 
•Verify that the research facilities, including laboratories and equipment, are maintained adequately to safely and properly conduct the study. 
14.1.5 Study Auditing and Inspecting 
The sponsor may audit the study conduct, compliance with the protocol and accuracy of the data 
in one or more centers.  
The investigator(s)/institution(s) will permit study-related monitoring, audits, and inspections by 
the sponsor, IRB/IEC, government regulatory bodies and Astex Pharmaceuticals Quality Assurance personnel or its designees by providing direct access to source data/documents after appropriate notification from sponsor. 
14.2 Investigator Responsibilities 
14.2.1 Subject Screening Log 
The investigator must keep a record that lists all subjects who signed an informed consent and 
the reason for non-inclusion if they were not ultimately randomized or treated. 
14.2.2 Study Treatment Accountability 
An initial supply of SGI-110 will be shipped to each study center's pharmacy when all the 
initiation documents, including IRB/IEC approvals, IRB/IEC approved ICF, and business agreements, have been received and reviewed by Astex Pharmaceuticals and upon activation of the study center by Astex Pharmaceuticals.  
Keep study treatment in a locked, limited-access room. The study treatment must not be used 
outside the context of the protocol. Under no circumstances should the investigator or other study center personnel supply study treatment to other investigators, subjects, or clinics or allow supplies to be used other than as directed by this protocol without prior authorization from Astex Pharmaceuticals.  
The monitor will regularly review and verify all study treatment supplies and associated 
documentation. 
Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  IND 102743 
Clinical Protocol SGI-110- 04  EUDRACT 2014-001233-89 
Confidential Information 78 6 March 2015 Maintain an accurate accounting of the study treatments. These records must show dates, lot 
numbers, quantities received, dispensed, and returned and must be available for monitoring by the sponsor. The investigator will ensure that any used and unused study treatment and other study material is destroyed or returned to the sponsor on completion of the study. If the study treatment is destroyed at the study center, there should be documentation of destruction at the study center. The sponsor and/or their representatives will verify final drug accountability. Study treatment accountability records must be maintained and readily available for inspection by representatives of Astex Pharmaceuticals and are open to inspections by regulatory authorities at any time. 
14.2.3 Reporting and Recording of Study Data 
Data will be captured and compiled using procedures developed by the sponsor or their 
representatives. Clearly record all requested study data on the CRF/eCRF and other study forms as required. Whenever possible, record the reason for missing data in the source document. Only individuals who are identified on the study personnel responsibility/signature log may enter or correct data in the CRF/eCRF. Incomplete or inconsistent data on the CRF/eCRFs will result in data queries that require resolution by the investigator or designee. 
The investigator must assure subject anonymity and protection of identities from unauthorized 
parties. On CRF/eCRFs or other documents or subject records provided to Astex Pharmaceuticals, identify subjects by code (subject number, initials, date of birth) and not by names. The principal investigator should maintain documents not for submission to Astex Pharmaceuticals (eg, subjects' signed informed consent) in strict confidence. 
14.2.4 Source Documentation 
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate source documents upon which 
CRF/eCRFs for each subject are based. They are to be separate and distinct from CRF/eCRFs, except for cases in which the sponsor has predetermined that direct data entry into specified pages of the subject's CRF/eCRF is appropriate. These records should include detailed notes on: 
•The oral and written communication with the subject regarding the study treatment 
(including the risks and benefits of the study). Record the date of informed consent in the source documentation. 
•The subject's medical history before participation in the study. 
•The subject's basic identifying information, such as demographics, that links the subject's source documents with the CRF/eCRFs. 
•The results of all diagnostic tests performed, diagnoses made, therapy provided, and any other data on the condition of the subject. 
•The subject's exposure to study treatment. 
•All AEs.

Clinical Protocol SGI-110- 04  EUDRACT 2014-001233-89 
Confidential Information 79 6 March 2015 •The subject's exposure to any concomitant therapy (including start and stop dates, route of 
administration, and dosage). 
•All relevant observations and data on the condition of the subject throughout the study. 
14.2.5 Tissue and Blood Sample Collection/Storage 
Tissue and blood components samples which are collected as part of routine medical care or as 
part of protocol procedures may be stored and analyzed for PK or pharmacodynamic analyses.  
After the study, samples may be used for additional investigation to help identify factors that 
may influence response to therapy. Such samples will be used in compliance with guidelines defined by FDA Guidance on Informed Consent for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover Human Specimens that are Not Individually Identifiable (issued 25 April 2006) and European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA)'s Reflection Paper on Pharmacogenomic Samples, Testing and Data Handling ( EMEA 2007 ).  
14.2.6 Records Retention 
The investigator must ensure that clinical study records are retained according to national 
regulations, as documented in the clinical trial agreement entered into with the sponsor in connection with this study. The investigator will maintain all records and documents pertaining to the study including, but not limited to, those outlined above (see Section 14.2.4) for a period 
of: at least 2 years after FDA approval of the drug or at least 2 years after withdrawal of the IND under which this study was conducted, whichever is longer. In countries outside the US, records must be kept for the period of time required by the US FDA as a minimum, and record retention should also comply with the local country regulatory requirements, if longer retention times are required than in the US. Mandatory documentation includes copies of study protocols and amendments, financial disclosures, each FDA Form 1572, IRB/IEC approval letters, signed ICFs, drug accountability records, SAE forms transmitted to Astex Pharmaceuticals, subject files (source documentation) that substantiate entries in  CRF/eCRFs, all relevant correspondence, and 
other documents pertaining to the conduct of the study. These records must remain in each subject's study file and be available for verification by study monitors at any time. 
The investigator must inform the sponsor immediately if any documents are to be destroyed, 
transferred to a different facility, or transferred to a different owner. The sponsor should be given the option of collecting the documents before destruction. 
14.3 Clinical Trial Insurance 
Clinical trial insurance has been undertaken according to the laws of the countries where the 
study will be conducted. An insurance certificate will be made available to the participating study centers upon request.

Confidential Information 80 6 March 2015 14.4 Study Administrative Letters and Protocol Amendments 
Astex Pharmaceuticals may issue Study Administrative Letters (1) to clarify certain statements or 
correct obvious errors/typos/inconsistencies in the study protocol, (2) to change the logistical or administrative aspects of the study, such as study personnel or contact information, or (3) to instruct investigators of DMC safety decisions for immediate implementation for safety reasons (Section 4.4).  
For all other changes, Astex Pharmaceuticals will initiate any change to the protocol in a protocol amendment document. Astex Pharmaceuticals will submit the amendment together with a revised model ICF (if applicable), to regulatory authorities for approval before implementation, as required. The study center will submit the amendment to the IRB/IEC together with, if applicable, a revised model ICF. If the change in any way increases the risk to the subject, information on the increased risk must be provided to subjects already actively participating in the study, and they must read, understand and sign any revised ICF confirming willingness to remain in the study. 
The investigator must obtain IRB/IEC approval before any protocol amendment can be 
implemented, except for administrative changes or changes necessary to eliminate an immediate risk to study subjects, as outlined above. 
15.0 POLICY FOR PUBLICATION AND PRESENTATION OF DATA 
The sponsor encourages the scientific publication of data from clinical research studies. 
However, investigators may not present or publish partial or complete study results individually without review by the sponsor. The principal investigators and the sponsor may propose appropriate scientific manuscripts or abstracts from the study data. The sponsor must review and comment on all proposed publications before submission for publication. The detailed procedures for the review of publications are set out in the clinical trial agreement entered into with the sponsor in connection with this study. These procedures are in place to ensure coordination of study data publication and adequate review of data for publication against the validated study database for accuracy. Names of all investigators and sponsor representatives responsible for designing the study and analyzing the results will be included in the publication(s). 
Qualification of authorship will follow the requirements of the International Committee of 
Medical Journal Editors (www.icmje.org). In most cases, the principal investigators at the 
centers with the highest participation and accruals of eligible subjects and data in the study shall be listed as lead authors on manuscripts and reports of study results. The sponsor's medical monitor, study director and/or lead statistician may also be included in the list of authors. This custom can be adjusted upon mutual agreement of the authors and Astex Pharmaceuticals. In addition, other than clinical pharmacology studies in healthy volunteers or Phase 1 studies, all clinical studies must be registered with ClinicalTrials.gov.

Confidential Information 94 6 March 2015 APPENDIX 5: SUMMARY OF CHANGES, AMENDMENT 1 
Protocol: SGI-110-04 
Amendment Date: 6 March 2015 Amendment 1 incorporates changes required by the Voluntary Harmonization Procedure (VHP) 
assessment of the protocol after clinical trial application in Europe.  
Rationale for Amendment 1: VHP-required changes and sponsor administrative changes. 
Summary of Changes:  
1. Requirements were incorporated to specify use of 2 highly effective contraceptive 
measures during the study and for at least 3 months after completing treatment. Highly 
effective contraceptive measures are defined. Monthly pregnancy testing for women of child-bearing potential and pregnancy as a reason for discontinuation from study treatment were also incorporated (Synopsis and Sections 5.2, 5.4.1, 9.5.1, 9.5.3.1, and 
9.5.4.1) . 
2. Description is added that the use of decitabine, the active metabolite of SGI-110, alters 
fertility and is mutagenic. Recommendation is added to seek advice about preserving oocytes and sperm before the start of study treatment for men and women of child-bearing potential (Section 8.0) . 
3. The timing of the screening pregnancy test was changed so that it must be done within 
7 days of the start of study treatment (Sections 9.5.1 and 9.5.2) . 
4. Prohibition of vaccination with live vaccines was added (Section 7.5.2) . 
5. A statement was added that the sponsor will submit a protocol amendment and a revised 
model ICF to regulatory authorities for approval before implementation (Section 14.4) . 
6. More information about life expectancy, harm, and quality of life for the TCs was added. 
Information on supportive care was also added (Sections 1.2 and 16.0) .  
7. Two additional collection time-points for PK an alysis were added (for a total of 4 sparse 
samples from 2 collection days) from SGI-110-treated subjects to enable more robust exposure-response analyses using a Population PK modeling approach (Section 9.3) . 
8. A description was added to address alternative therapy upon progression or toxicity in the 
TC group (Section 7.2) . 
9. A description of results from the 10-day regimen in previously untreated subjects with 
AML was added, based on preliminary data from Study SGI-110-01 Phase 2 Dose Expansion (Section 2.2.3.2) . 
10. Rationale was added for the recommendation that SGI-110 study treatment should 
continue for at least 6 cycles (Section 7.1.2) .

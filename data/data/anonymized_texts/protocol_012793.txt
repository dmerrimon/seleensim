Statistical Analysis Plan : Final Version 1 .0, 03 March 2022  Page | 8 3 INTRODUCTION 
This statistical analysis plan (SAP) describes the planned statistical analys is for the 
study entitled “A Randomized, Double- Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study t o Evaluate 
the Safety a nd Efficacy of Staccato® Granisetron (A Z- 010) for the Acute Treatment 
of Moderate t o Severe Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome” (Amendment 2 dated 2 8 APR 
2021). M ock shells will be  produced as a separate working document  to facilitate 
programming of Tables, Figures, and Listings (TFLs) according to the SAP. The 
SAP is to be interpreted in conjunction with the protocol , and supersedes the 
statistical considerations identified in the protocol . If the final clinical study report 
contains changes to any  planned statistical analyses , the justification for any such 
differences will be fully documented in the clinical study report ( CSR). 
4 STUDY OBJECTIVE S 
The primary objectives for this study are to: 
• Assess the efficacy of AZ -010 as an acute treatment for moderate to 
severe cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) in adult patients  
• Assess the safety of AZ -010 in adult patients  with moderate to severe 
CVS.  
5 STUDY DESIGN  
5.1 DURATION OF STUDY  
The total period of the study will be up to approximately 15 weeks, including up to 2 
weeks for Screening, 12 weeks for the home treatment period, and a post -dose visit 
3-5 days following the last dose of the home treatment period.  
5.2 NUMBER OF PARTI CIPANTS  
Approximately 150 participant s are planned to be randomized at approximately 15 
study centers.  
5.3 DESIGN  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double- blind, parallel group, placebo- controlled, 
efficacy and safety study of adult outpatients diagnosed with CVS and experiencing 
recurring episodes of stereotypical vomiting. Participants  meeting all inclusion 
criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized to treatment with either 1 mg AZ -010, 3 mg AZ -010, or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio (active:active:placebo). Each 
randomized participant  will receive training in the use of the Staccato device and 
detailed instructions for the use of the ePD in the clinic as well as undergo a pre- test 
self-administration of their randomized study medication. Each participant  will be 
monitored during a 2 hr . observation period and have 12- lead ECG (triplicate) 
assessments at pre- dose and 2, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post dose. If there are 
no clinically -significant observations or abnormalities on the ECG, including QT 
prolongation, the participant  will be provided with their Patient Kit that contains the 
remaining 5 unused Staccato devices in addition to the 1 Staccato device that they

Statistical Analysis Plan : Final Version 1 .0, 03 March 2022  Page | 9 used in the clinic. Up to 5 administrations of study medication will be allowed in an At 
Home environment. CVS patients  between 18 and 60 years of age who have 
experienced at least 3 episodes of recurrent vomiting in the last 12 months and 2 episodes in the last 6 months ( with stereotypical episodes of acute onset vomiting 
lasting <1 w eek and absence of vomiting between episodes) are eligible for 
participation. Approximately 50 participant s will be randomized to each of 3 
treatment groups: 1 mg AZ -010, 3 mg AZ -010, or matching Staccato Placebo 
(Staccato device without drug coating). Randomization will be stratified by duration of the participant ’s typical CVS episode into one of the following two categories: 1) 
Typical episode of CVS lasts 24 hrs . or less from the first vomiting/retching event; 2) 
Typical episode of CVS lasts greater tha n 24 hrs . from the first vomiting/retching 
event.  
There will be 3 Research Clinic visits and a home treatment period, as indicated in the Study Schema (5.4). 
Participant s will be screened at the Research Clinic to determine if they are eligible 
for study participation no more than 14 days prior to Visit 2. After the study is explained to the participant  and the participant  has signed an informed consent form 
(ICF), the investigator will establish the participant ’s eligibility according to the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria via the following assessments: Medical history (with particular reference to history of vomiting symptoms, CVS diagnosis, typical duration of CVS episode (hrs . vs days), average number of vomiting/retching events in typical 
CVS episode, frequency of CVS episodes per year, any triggers for CVS episode, other GI conditions that may cause similar symptoms, treatment history, and current medications); full physical examination (including height, weight); vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure while sitting, respiratory rate, temperature); 12- lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG); blood draw and urine sample for routine clinical labs (chemistry, hematology, urinalysis); and serum pregnancy test (in female participants of child- bearing potential). In light of the COVID -19 pandemic, 
participant s will also be screened for COVID -19 infection and appropriate social 
distancing and contact procedures should be taken to ensure participant  safety 
when in the clinic.  
Participant s who continue to be eligible for the study will be asked to return to the 
Research Clinic for Visit 2. Participant s meeting all inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria will be randomized to treatment with either 1mg AZ -010, 3 mg AZ -
010, or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio (active:active:placebo). Each randomized participant  
will be provided with a Patient  Kit that contains 6 Staccato devices, other study 
materials, and an electronic Patient Diary (ePD) to be used for at -home treatment. 
They will also  receive training in the use of the Staccato device and detailed 
instructions for the use of the ePD in the clinic as well as undergo a pre- test self- 
administration of their randomized study medication. Each participant  will be 
monitored during a 2 hr . observation period and have 12- lead ECG (triplicate) 
assessments at pre- dose and 2, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post dose. If there are 
no clinically -significant observations or abnormalities on the ECG, including QT 
prolongation, the participant  will continue in the study.

Statistical Analysis Plan : Final Version 1 .0, 03 March 2022  Page | 10  Randomized participant s without clinical observations in the 2- hour observation 
period will be asked to treat a subsequent CVS episode (with single daily dosing up 
to 5 consecutive days) within 12 weeks after the randomization date.  Enroll ed 
participant s will self -administer the study medication when they know their CVS 
episode is imminent or as soon as possible after a CVS -related vomiting episode 
has begun. Participant s will interact with their ePD prior to initiation of treatment (if 
possible) and to capture the study data. The ePD will be used to record the date and 
time of study medication administration, the number of vomiting and retching events, 
and the participant  reported outcome measures (including the intensity and duration 
of the CVS episode, severity of abdominal pain, nausea, and anxiety/panic, and 
characteristics of the nausea, vomiting and retching over defined time periods)  
(section 5.8) . Participants will also record the number of vomiting and retching 
events in the 24 hours after dosing on a paper questionnaire.  
Participants will be instructed to contact the Research Clinic at the earliest possible 
time after initiation of dosing and at any time should they require rescue medication, medical assistance or experience an intolerable AE at home during the treatment period. Participants will record rescue medications taken after administration of 
study medication in their ePD and on a paper concomitant medications form . 
Rescue medication may include any agent(s) from the list described in Section 9. 8 of 
the protocol . Participant s are encouraged to avoid rescue medication for the first 2 
hrs. following treatment with the study medication.  
Participant s will be required to return to the Research Clinic (Visit 3) within 3- 5 days 
from the last study medication administration for final in- clinic assessments, to return 
the Patient Kit containing the used and unused study medication, ePD, and any other unused supplies. Conversely, participant s will be asked to return to the 
Research Clin ic after 12 weeks with their unused Patient Kit if they did not treat a 
CVS episode within this time period.  
Visit 3 will include the following assessments: Vital signs; full physical examination; assessment for treatment emergent adverse events; 12- lead ECG, concomitant 
medications (including rescue medication taken), and clinical labs.

Statistical Analysis Plan: Final Version 1 .0, 03 March 2022  Page | 14  5.6 TREATMENT  
Participant s will be allocated to each treatment group according to the randomization 
scheme.  
5.7 RANDOMIZATION  
Participant s will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 mg AZ -010, 3 mg AZ -010, or 
matching Staccato Placebo (Staccato device without drug coating). Randomization will 
be stratified by duration of the participant ’s typical CVS episode into one of the following 
two categories:  
1. Typical episode of CVS lasts 24 hrs . or less from the first vomiting/retching event  
2. Typical episode of CVS lasts greater than 24 hrs . from the first vomiting/retching 
event.  
The randomization schedule will be generated prior to study start. All study participant s, 
Investigators, and site study staff will be blinded to study medication assignment. Devices and packaging of AZ -010 and placebo are  identical in appearance.  
5.8 EFFICACY  
5.8.1  EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS 
5.8.1.1  NUMBER OF VOMITING AND RETCHING EVENTS IN THE FIRST 2 
HOURS AFTER TREATMENT  
The primary endpoint in the study is the number of vomiting and retching events in the first 2 hours following treatment based on patient -reported data entered into the ePD. 
Participants will record the number of vomiting and retching events that they experience 
within the first 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes on the ePD.  Each of these entries in the ePD 
are cumulative from the time of treatment, so the primary endpoint is the assessment at 120 minutes.  
5.8.1.2  24 HOUR VOMITING AND RETCHING QUESTIONNAIRE  
The 24 hour vomiting and retching questionnaire is a paper questionnaire on which participant s will record the date of dosing with study medication and the total number 
vomiting and retching  events that occurred within the first 24 hours after dosing. A 
vomiting or retching event is  defined as one or more continuous episodes of vomiting 
(expulsion of stomach contents through the mouth) or retching/dry heaves (an attempt 
to vomit that is not productive of stomach contents). If there is a break of at least 1 
minute between vomiting and retching events, those should be considered two different 
events.  
5.8.1.3  VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS)  
The visual analog scale is a scale of continuous measure initially developed for pain that has  been used in a variety of clinical settings where the endpoint of interest is 
based on a subjective perception. The visual analog scale is a distinct 100- millimeter 
line anchored on the left end (0)  at no degree of impairment and on the right end (100) 
at full degree of impairment, where indication of the degree of impairment perceived at 
the time of assessment is captured by  marking the appropriate position on the line

Statistical Analysis Plan: Final Version 1 .0, 03 March 2022  Page | 15  between the anchor points. The measured distance  of the mark from the left anchor is  
recorded in millimeters and this scal e is adapted for  the ePD.  
There are 3 different VAS scales assessed in the study. In each case the participant  is 
asked to rate the appropriate variable in relation to their last vomiting/retching episode:  
• The assessment of abdominal pain whereby 0 = no pain and 100 = worst 
possible pain;  
• The assessment of nausea whereby 0 = no nausea and 100 = worst possible nausea;  
• The assessment of anxiety/panic whereby 0 = no anxiety/panic and 100 = worst possible  anxiety/panic.  
5.8.1.4  RHO DES INDEX OF NAUSEA, VOMITING, AND RETCHING (RINVR)  
The RINVR is designed to assess the degree of nausea distress and vomiting distress in patients.  It is composed of 8 questions and each question has 5 choices (see protocol 
Appendix, Section 17.4) . Questi ons 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8 deal with symptom occurrence and 
Questions 2, 3, 5 deal with degree of discomfort of the individual symptoms. Individual 
questions can be tracked over time,  or a composite score can be formed by adding the 
total of the symptom occurrence and degree of  discomfort questions together. This 
scale is adapted for the ePD and participant s are prompted to answer the questions 
according to the Schedule of Events.  
5.8.1.5  INTENSITY OF ATTACK SCALE  
The Intensity of Attack scale is designed to assess the severity of the last vomiting/retching episode at the time of assessment. Severity ranges from Mild to 
Excruciating on a 4 point scale.  This scale is  administered on  the ePD and participant s 
are prompted to answer the questions  according to the Schedule of Events.  
5.8.1.6  P RIOR EPISODE QUESTIONNAIRE  
The Prior Episode Questionnaire is designed to compare the overall intensity and duration of the current CVS episode with CVS episodes that the participant  has typically 
experienced in the past.  For both Intensit y and Duration, the participant  responds 
whether the current episode overall was  Less than, the Same as, or Greater than their 
typical previous CVS episodes. The questions are  prompted approximately 24 hours 
after each dose of study medication is administered.  
 
5.8.2  PRIMARY ENDPOINT  
Number of vomiting/retching episodes within two hours following initial treatment, during the Home Treatment Period.  
5.8.3  SECONDARY ENDPOINTS

• The assessment of nausea at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours following treatment (VAS 1-100; 0 = no nausea and 100 = worst possible nausea)  
• The assessment of anxiety/panic at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours following treatment (VAS 1 -100; 0 = no anxiety/panic and 100 = worst possible anxiety/panic)  
• The duration of the CVS episode at 24 hours in relation to their typical CVS episodes (Prior Episode Questionnaire)  
• The intensity of the CVS episode at 24 hours in relation to their typical CVS 
episodes (Prior Episode Questionnaire)  
• Use of rescue medication within the 24 hours following treatment with the study medication  
• Visit to urgent care, emergency department, or physician’s office for care related to the treated episode of CVS within the 24 hours following treatment with the study medication  
5.9 SAFETY  
Safety and tolerability of AZ -010 will be assessed by evaluating adverse events, vital 
signs, clinical laboratories, ECG  results, as well as physical examinations.  
5.9.1  ADVERSE EVENTS  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a participant  during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a 
worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant ’s health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology. Any 
worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a pre- existing condition) should be considered an adverse event.  
All participant s will be monitored for adverse events during the study. Assessments may 
include monitoring of the following parameters: the participant ’s clinical symptoms, 
laboratory, physical examination findings, or findings from other tests and/or procedures.

Vital signs will include blood pressure, pulse rate, pulse oximetry, respiratory rate, and 
temperature.   
5.9.4  ELECTROCARDIOGRAM  
Twelve -lead electrocardiograms will be performed after the participant  has rested in a 
supine or semi -supine position for at least 5 minutes. Individual parameters including 
heart rate, PR, QT, QTcF, QRS, and RR intervals will be collected. Repeat electroc ardiograms (if deemed necessary) should be performed at least 5 minutes 
apart. ECGs performed on Day 1 for pre -test assessment  will be collected in triplicate 
for the pre- dose and post -dose collection times.  
5.9.5  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  
A complete physical examination will include an examination of all major organ systems to include, but not be limited to, chest auscultation, abdominal auscultation and palpation, head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, and will exclude urinary and reproductive systems. A brief physical examination will be symptom directed.  
5.10 COVID TESTING AND IMPACT  
COVID testing, including date and time of test, will be administered per participant , with 
results reported as positive or negative.  
Information regarding the impact of COVID on visits, assessments, or participant  
participation will also be collected.  
6 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
6.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS  
All analysis dataset preparations and statistical analyses will be performed using SAS
® 
version 9.4 or higher. No imputation will be performed for missing data unless stated otherwise.  
Data will be summarized by dosing group (1 mg AZ -010, 3 mg AZ -010, placebo). All 
data for analysis will be listed by participant . 
The same number of decimal places as in the raw data will be presented when reporting minimum and maximum, 1 more decimal place than in the raw data will be presented when reporting mean and standard deviation.  
Continuous variables will be summarized by treatment using descriptive s tatistics (n, 
mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum). For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages will be presented by treatment. Baseline is defined as the last observation prior to initiation of Study Medication.  
Listings for  CSR Appendix 16.2 will include all the participant  data points being collected 
or derived for analyses. Data listings will be provided for all participant s up to the point 
of study completion or withdrawal.  
All statistical tests will be 2 -sided with a sig nificance value of 0.05. Participant s will 
generally be summarized by actual treatment received.  
CONFIDENTIAL   Alexza Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Protocol AMDC 010- 201 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan: Final Version 1 .0, 03 March 2022  Page | 19  If the 12 -week treatment period has expired and participant s have not yet treated a CVS 
episode, they will be excluded from efficacy analyses since they did not receive any 
study medication specifically in anticipation of a CVS episode. 
6.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION 
This is a proof -of-concept  study. There are no studies in the literature to provide reliable 
estimates of active treatment or placebo response rates us ing vomiting/retching events, 
or the estimate of variances around these measures, in participant s with CVS being 
treated acutely with an abortive therapy. Consequently, sample size was not based on power calculations.  
Approximately 150 participant s will be  randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups. An N of 
50 per group should be sufficient to describe and compare across the efficacy parameters.  
6.3 STUDY DATA  
The study data to be analyzed include all clinical data captured by the case report form (eCRF)  or otherwise centrally, including safety lab data  and ECGs . The  database will be 
locked for the final analyses.  
6.4 ANALYSIS SETS 
The following analysis populations  are defined.     
• Efficacy Population - All participant s who receive study medication and treated at 
least 1 episode of vomiting/retching due to their CVS, analyzed according to randomized treatment  
• Safety Population - All participant s who receive study drug  
• Per Protocol (PP) Population – A PP population (subset of the Efficacy 
Population) may be decided upon which will exclude participants with important 
protocol deviations thought to potentially impact conclusions , if a sufficient  
number of participants with such deviations exist . If so, this population will be 
defined prior to breaking the blind.       
6.5 TREATMENT GROUPS  
The analyses will be conducted by treatment group:  
• 1 mg AZ -010 
• 3 mg AZ -010 
• matching Staccato Placebo (Staccato device without drug coating)  
6.6 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESIS TESTS  
H
0: There will be no difference between AZ -010 (1 mg or 3 mg) and placebo in the 
mean number of vomiting/retching events in the 2 hours following treatment.

Protocol AMDC 010- 201 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan: Final Version 1 .0, 03 March 2022  Page | 20  H1: Treatment with AZ -010 (1 mg or 3 mg) will result in a statistically significant different 
mean number of vomiting/retching events versus placebo in the 2 hours following 
treatment.  
6.7 MULTIPLICITY ADJUSTMENT  
No adjustments will be made for multiple comparisons  for this proof -of-concept  study . 
6.8 DEFINITION OF SUBGROUPS  
No subgroup analyses are planned.  
6.9 ENDPOINTS AND ESTIMANDS  
6.9.1  PRIMARY ENDPOINT AND ESTIMAND  
The mean number of vomiting/retching events in the 2 hours following treatment among 
those treated for a CVS episode (imminent or otherwise).  
6.9.1.1  TARGET POPULATION 
The target populations are given by the Effic acy Population  which include all 
participant s treated during the Home Treatment Period for a CVS episode (imminent or 
otherwise).  If a PP Population is defined, the primary analysis will be repeated for the 
PP Population.  
6.9.1.2  PRIMARY ENDPOINT  
Number of vomiting/retching episodes within two hours following initial treatment, during the Home Treatment Period as assessed at the designated planned two- hour timepoint . 
6.9.1.3  HANDLING OF INTERCURRENT EVENTS  
1. Clinically significant ECG abnormality during the pre- test s elf-administration 
which preclude further participation - Princip al Stratum Strategy:  
 
• Participant s who are excluded from further participation are not included in 
efficacy analyses, with the population for anticipated use consistent with 
this exclusion.  An underlying assumption is that potential treatment 
benefit is independent of the likelihood of exclusion for this reason.  
 
2. Participant  experiences a CVS episode (imminent or otherwise) requiring 
treatment during the home treatment period - Principal Stratum Strategy:  
 
• The princip al stratum of interest is restricted to those participant s 
experiencing at least one episode of CVS (imminent or otherwise) requiring 
treatment. An underlying assumption is  that likelihood of experiencing at 
least one episode during the Home Treatment Period and severity of CVS 
CONFIDENTIAL   Alexza Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Protocol AMDC 010- 201 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan: Final Version 1 .0, 03 March 2022  Page | 21  episodes  is independent of randomized treatment as signment (and 
subsequent qualification for the Home Treatment Period) . 
 
3. Use of rescue medication prior to 2 hours - Treatment Policy Strategy:  
 
• P articipant s are encouraged not to use rescue prior to 2 hours, however 
vomiting retching episodes prior to 2 hours will be counted, irrespective of 
the use of rescue.  
6.9.1.4  POPULATION- LEVEL SUMMARY 
Mean number of vomiting retching events in the first 2 hours fol lowing the initial 
treatment (during the Home Treatment Period) from an analysis of variance model, with treatment group and randomization strata in the model.  
6.9.1.5  MISSING DATA  
The necessity and approach to handling missing data for the primary endpoint is 
dependent upon the extent of missing data and potential reasons  for missingness  as 
well as imbalance which may be observed with respect to missing data across treatment groups .  A such , post-hoc exploratory analyses may be conducted for this 
proof -of-concep t study  to address missing data, including the use of non- missing data 
from CVS episodes after the first episode to assess treatment benefit .  
     
6.9.2  SECONDARY ENDPOINTS AND ESTIMANDS  
Secondary endpoints and associated estimands  target the Efficacy Population  and PP 
Population (if defined) and handle intercurrent events 1 and 2 as for the primary estimand and intercurrent event number 3 as for primary (except as noted). Secondary endpoints are described in section 5.8, and population- level s ummaries are as noted 
below.   
6.9.2.1  POPULATION- LEVEL SUMMARY 
The population- level summary for secondary endpoints are defined as follows:  
• The intensity of the vomiting/retching attack (Intensity of Attack Scale [IAS]) at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours following treatment. Participant s rate the intensity of their last 
vomiting/retching episode on a scale of 1 (mild) to 4 (excruciating).  
• The Rhodes Index of nausea, vomiting, and retching (RINVR) total score at 6, 12, and 24 hours following treatment.  
• The assessment of abdominal pain at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours following treatment (visual analog scale [VAS] 1- 100; 0 = no pain and 100 = worst possible pain).  
• The assessment of nausea at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours following treatment (VAS 1-100; 0 = no nausea and 100 = worst possible nausea).  
• The assessment of anxiety/panic at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours following treatment (VAS 1 -100; 0 = no anxiety/panic and 100 = worst possible anxiety/panic).  
• The duration of the CVS episode at 24 hours in relation to their typical CVS episodes (Prior Episode Questionnaire [PES]), on a scale where 1=shorter, 2=same duration, and 3=longer.  
CONFIDENTIAL   Alexza Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Protocol AMDC 010- 201 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan: Final Version 1 .0, 03 March 2022  Page | 22  • The intensity of the CVS episode at 24 hours  in relation to their typical CVS 
episodes (Prior Episode Questionnaire), on a scale where 1=less intense, 
2=same intensity, and 3=more intense.  
• The proportion of participant s requiring rescue medication (anti-emetics, 
benzodiazapines and triptans)  within the 24 hours following treatment with the 
study medication, as reported either in the ePD or as a concomitant medication.  
• The proportion of participant s requiring a visit to urgent care, emergency 
department, or physician’s office for care related to the treated episode of CVS within the 24 hours following treatment with the study medication.  
6.10 MAIN ANALYTICAL APPROACH  
Data from the RINVR, IAS, VAS, and PES will be analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM). Fixed effects will include treatment group, timepoint , 
randomization strata, and a treatment -by-timepoint  interaction. Timepoint  will be fit as a 
repeated effect using the repeated statement in SAS. An unstructured covariance structure and Kenward -Roger degrees of freedom will be used. In t he event an 
unstructured covariance structure fails to converge, a Toeplitz structure will be used.  
Least squares means will be presented for treatment* timepoint , with the significance 
level of the treatment -by-timepoint  interaction presented in summary t ables. Pair -wise 
comparisons of differences in LS means, two -sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on 
differences, and p- values will be provided for each active treatment versus placebo for 
each timepoint . 
Proportion data (ie, rescue medication or visits to urgent care/ER/doctor will be 
analyzed using a Mantel -Haenszel  test, stratifying on randomization strata, in a pairwise 
fashion of each dose versus placebo .

9.1 ADVERSE EVENTS  
An adverse event reported after informed consent, but before the first dose of study 
medication,  will be considered a pre- treatment adverse event (or interim medical event). 
Treatment -emergent  adverse events (TEAEs) will be defined as any adverse event that 
occurs after administration of  the first dose of study medication until the Follow Up Visit 
or the Early Termination Visit. The number and percentage of participant s who report 
TEAEs will be summarized by system organ class  and preferred term.  
Treatment emergent adverse events will also be summarized by intensity as well as

system organ class and  preferred term. 
9.2 CLINICAL LABORATORY EVALUATIONS  
Laboratory values will be converted to the project -defined unit of measurement, as 
applicable, before analysis. Abnormal, clinically significant laboratory values will be reported and summarized as adverse events. Clinical laboratory  tests (including re-
check values if present) will be listed chronologically. ‘H’ and ‘L’, denoting values above or below the reference range (when present), will flag out -of-range results. At each time 
point, absolute values and change from baseline of the hematology and chemistry 
variables will be summarized by treatment and time with n, mean, SD, SEM, median, Min, and Max values. The categorical data of the urinalysis will be summarized by treatment and time in frequency tables by variable.  Note, in some  cases, baseline (the

Title of Study: A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study to Evaluate the 
Safety  and E fficacy of Staccato G ranisetron (AZ -010) for the A cute T reatment of Moderate to 
Severe Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome  
Study Center(s): Multicenter study; approximately 15 sites; US  
Study Period (years):  
Estimated Date of First Subject Enrollment: February 202 1 
Estimated Date of Last Subject Completed:  December 2021 Phase of Development: 2 
Objectives:  
The primary objectives of the study are to assess:  
• The efficacy of AZ -010 as an acute treatment for moderate to severe cyclic vomiting 
syndrome (CVS) in adult patients.  
• The safety of AZ -010 in adult patients with moderate to severe CVS.  
Methodology:  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, efficacy 
and safety study of adult outpatients diagnosed with CVS and experiencing recurring episodes 
of stereotypical vomiting.  Up to 5 administrations of study medication will be studied in an At 
Home environment . CVS patients between 18 and 60 years of age who have experienced at 
least 3 episodes of recurrent vomiting in the last 12 months are eligible for participation. Approximately 50 patients will be randomized to each of 3 treatment groups: 1 mg AZ-010, 3 mg AZ -010, or matching Staccato Placebo ( Staccato  device without drug coating).  
Randomization will be stratified by duration of the patient’s typical CVS episode into one of the following two categories: 1) Typical episode of CVS lasts 24 hrs or less from the first vomiting/retching event; 2) Typical episode of CVS lasts greater than 24 hrs from the first vomiting/retching event.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 5 There will be 3 Research Clinic visits and a home treatment period:  
 
 
Patients will be screened at the Research Clinic to determine if they are eligible for study 
participation no more than 14 days pr ior to Visit 2. After the study is explained to the patient 
and the patient has signed an informed consent form (ICF), the investigator will establish the patient’s eligibility according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria via the following assessments : Medical history (with particular reference to history of vomiting symptoms, CVS 
diagnosis, typical duration of CVS episode (hrs, days, etc), average number of vomiting/retching events in typical CVS episode, frequency of CVS episodes per year, any trigge rs for CVS episode,  other GI conditions that may cause similar symptoms, treatment 
history, and current medications); full physical examination (including height, weight); vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure while sitting, respiratory rate, temperature); 12 -lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG); blood draw and urine sample for routine clinical labs (chemistry, hematology, urinalysis); and serum pregnancy test (in female participants of child -bearing 
potential). In light of the COVID -19 pandemic, patients will also be screened for COVID -19 
infection and appropriate social distancing and cont act procedures should be taken to ensure 
patient safety when  in the clinic.  
Patients who continue to be eligible to participate in the study will be asked to return to the Research Clinic for Visit 2.  Patients meeting all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria will be randomized to treatment with either 1mg AZ -010, 3 mg AZ-010, or placebo in 
a 1:1:1 ratio (active:active:placebo). Each randomized patient will rece ive training in the use 
of the Staccato device and detailed instructions for the use of the ePD in the clinic as well as undergo a pre- test self -administration of their randomized study medication. Each patient will 
be monitored during a 2 hr observation period and have 12- lead ECG (triplicate) assessments 
at pre -dose and 2, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post dose. If there are no clinically- significant 
observations or abnormalities on the ECG, including QT prolongation, the patient will be 
provided with their  Patient Kit that contains the remaining 5 unused Staccato devices in 
addition to the 1 Staccato device that they used in the clinic.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 6 Randomized patients will be asked to treat a subsequent CVS episode (with single daily 
dosing up to 5 consecutive days) within 12 weeks after the randomization date. Enrolled 
patients will self -administer the study medication when they know their CVS episode is 
imminent or as soon as possible after a CVS -related vomiting episode has begun. Patients will 
interact with their ePD  prior to initiation of treatment (if possible) and to capture the study 
data. The ePD will be used to record the date and time of study medication administration, the number of vomiting and retching events, and the patient reported outcom e measures 
(including the intensity and duration of the CVS episode, severity of abdominal pain, nausea, 
and anxiety/panic, and characteristics of the nausea, vomiting and retching over defined time periods). In addition, patients will complete a paper que stionnaire to record the total number 
of vomiting and retching events within the first 24 hours after dosing. Patients will be instructed to contact the Research Clinic at the earliest possible time after initiation of dosing and any time should they requi re rescue medication, medical assistance or experience an 
intolerable AE at home during the treatment period. If the number of vomiting and retching 
events are not recorded on the ePD or the 24 hour vomiting and retching questionnaire and the patient has u nused study medication, that patient may be allowed to continue participation in 
the 12- week Home Treatment Period in order to treat a second CVS episode during this time . 
Patients will also record in a paper diary  the use of any medications taken during the Home 
Treatment period. Rescue medication s may include any of the agent(s) from the list described 
in Section  
9.8; however for the purpose of defining the responder endpoint, only anti -emetic 
medications , benzodiazepines, and triptans will be considered rescue medication s. Patients are 
encouraged to avoid rescue medication use for the first 2 hrs following treatment with the 
study medication .  
Patient s will be required to return to the Research Clinic (Visit 3) within 3–5 days from the 
last study medication administration for final in -clinic assessments, to return the Patient Kit 
containing the used and unused study medication, ePD, and any other unused supplies. Conversely, patients will be asked to return to the Research Clinic after 12 weeks with their unused Patient Kit if they did not treat a CVS episode within this time period. Visit 3 will include the following assessments: Vital signs; full physical examination; assessment for treatment emergent adverse events; 12 -lead ECG, concomitant medications (inc luding rescue 
medication taken) , and clinical labs.  
Number of Subjects (planned):  
Approximately 150 patients are planned to be randomized in the study. Patients will be randomized to treatment with either 1mg AZ -010, 3 mg AZ-010, or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio 
(active:active:placebo).

requirements.  
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Any significant medical or psychiatric condition that could, in the Investigator’s opinion, 
compromise the subject’s safety or interfere with the completion of this protocol.  
2. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities or pulmonary condition, which according to the Investigator places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study. 
3. A diagnosis of any gastrointestinal disorder other than CVS that in the judgement of the Investigator could compromise the subject’s safety or interfere with the interpretation of 
safety or efficacy data.  
4. Current history of clinically significant neurologic (e.g., seizures), cardiac, pulmonary (e.g., asthma, COPD), metabolic, renal, or hepatic conditions.

Protocol AMDC 010 -201 Amendment 2 Alexza Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 9 Investigational Product, Dosage and Mode of Administration:  
AZ-010 ( Staccato granisetron) is a hand -held, single dose, single-use drug-device 
combination product using the Staccato delivery system. Oral inhalation through the product 
is detected by the breath sensor, which in turn results in rapid heating of a thin film of granisetron causing the formation of a thermally generated drug vapor. The vapor condenses into aerosol particles with a particle size distribution appropriate for efficient delivery to the deep lung. The rapid absorption of the drug provides peak plasma levels in the system ic 
circulation within minutes after administration.  
Each product is packaged inside a sealed foil pouch. Upon removing the product from the pouch, pulling the tab connected to the device renders it ready for use, as indicated by 
illumination of a green lig ht on top of the device. Successful dosing is signaled by the 
extinguishing of the green light. 
AZ-010 is administered as a single dose via inhalation, available as 1 mg or 3 mg per device.  
Reference Therapy, Dosage and Mode of Administration:  
Matching placebo which is the same Staccato inhalation device without coated granisetron 
film 
Duration of Study Participation:  
The Screening phase will last up to 14  days. Eligible subjects will be provided with a 
multipack of study medication and instructed to se lf-medicate upon occurrence of their next 
CVS episode within the next 12-week period. Up to 5 daily doses will be administered when a 
CVS episode occurs. Consequently, subject participation will range from approximately 
1−4 months, depending on the timing of the Screening visit in relation to treatment.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
• The number of vomiting/retching events in the 2 hours following treatment. 
 
Secondary Endpoints  
• The percentage of patients with no vomiting or retching events and no anti -emetic , 
benzodiazepine, or triptan rescue medication use in the first 24 hours following treatment.  
• The intensity of the vomiting/retching  attack (Intensity of A ttack S cale) at 2, 6 , 12, and 
24 hours following treatment. 
• The Rhodes Index of nausea, vomiting, and retching (RINVR) at 6, 12, and 24 hours 
following treatment.  
• The assessment of abdominal pain at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours following treatment (VAS  1−100; 0 = no pain  and 100 = worst possible pain)  
• The assessment of nausea at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours following treatment (VAS 1–100; 0 = no nausea and 100 = worst possible nausea)  
• The assessment of anxiety/panic at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours following treatment 
(VAS  1−100; 0 = no anxiety /panic  and 100 = worst possible anxiety/panic)

(Prior Episode Questionnaire)  
• The intensity of the CVS episode at 24 hours in relation to their typical CVS episodes (Prior Episode Questionnaire ) 
• Use of rescue medication within the 24 hours following treatment with the study 
medication  
• Visit to urgent care, emergency department, or p hysician’s office for care related to the 
treated episode of CVS within the 24 hours following treatment with the study medication  
 
All statistical tests will be 2 -sided with a significance value of ≤ 0.05. There is no control for 
Type-1 error for the anal yses.  
Additional exploratory statistical analyses to further assess for treatment effect will be 
outlined in the Statistical Analysis Plan finalized prior to database lock.  
Safety  
Safety and tolerability of AZ -010 will be assessed by evaluating adverse events, vital signs,  
12-lead ECG, clinical laboratory results, and physical examination.

4.1 Background Information 
Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is an idiopathic chronic disorder characterized by sudden 
episodes of nausea and rapid -fire vomiting lasting for 1 –5 days followed by symptom- free 
periods ( Hayes et al, 2018).  This alternating pattern of disease and disease- free periods 
distinguishes CVS from other gastrointestinal disorders.  There is no current drug therapy 
approved for treatment of CVS.  
CVS is generally described as consisting of four phases. The inter -episodic phase  occurs 
between attacks and patients remain relatively asymptomatic. This phase can last for several months. During the prodromal phase , some patients describe an ‘aura’ that lasts for minutes to 
hours. This phase usually consists of lethargy, anorexia, pallor or abdominal pain or autonomic symptoms such as sweating or salivation. The hyperemesis phase usually starts from the early hours of the morning to noon, and is characterized by intense persistent nausea and repeated vomiting. Typically, vomiting peaks in the first hour and then declines lasting at least 24 hours with episodes commonly occurring in the early morning or upon awakening. The vomiting frequency can be up to eight times every hour ( Fleisher et al, 2005 ). This  can last for 1 –7 days. 
Finally, the recovery phase begins with the cessation of vomiting and ends when energy levels and appetite recover. Antiemetic agents have been reported to be a key component of support care for acute abortive treatment during the p rodromal and emetic phases of CVS in adults 
(Abell et al, 2008) . Abortive IV antiemetic agents such as the 5 -HT
3 antagonist ondansetron at 
high doses and granisetron were reported for supportive treatment of acute vomiting episodes in CVS patients ( Li and Misiewicz et al, 2003; Yang, 2010; Venkatasubramani, 2007) .  
Treatment of CVS remains largely based on real -world clinical experience . There is no current 
drug therapy approved for treatment of CVS. According to guidelines on management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults by the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society and the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association ( Venkatesan et al , 2019), treatment of CVS should 
be based on a biopsychosocial care model, integrating lifestyle modification, prophylactic and/or abortive medications, and evidenced-based psychotherapy to address psychiatric comorbidity. The guideline recommends using prophylactic medications in moderate -to-severe CVS and 
offering abortive medications to all patients to terminate an acute attack. For acute attacks, the committee conditionally recommends using serotonin antagonists, such as ondansetron, and/or triptans, such as sumatriptan or aprepitant to abort symptoms. Antiemetic intravenous therapy was reported to be effective for treatment of nausea and vomiting for CVS acute episodes (Jensen, 2015; Moses et al, 2014) . Granisetron was reported to be an effective pharmacologic 
approach used for abortive and supportive care in CVS ( Li and Balint, 2000; Li et al, 2008;  
Li and Misiewicz, 2003).  
Granisetron is a highly selective and potent 5- hydroxyltryptamine type 3 (5- HT3) receptor 
antagonist widely used for over twenty years as an effective antiemetic treatment (Blower,  2003).  The efficacy of granisetron in the prevention of nausea and vomiting has been 
extensively studied in clinical trials and is approved for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), radiation -induced nausea and vomiting (RINV), and for postoperative nausea 
and vomiting (PONV) ( Kytril (granisetron hydrochloride) Prescribing Information 2011 ,

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17 Aapro, 2004; Spart inou et al, 2017 ; Gilmore et al, 2018 ). Granisetron has also been shown to be 
effective and well tolerated in special populations, such as patients refractory to antiemetic 
treatment for gastroparesis (Simmons and Parkman, 2014) , bulimia nervosa, cyclic vomiting 
syndrome, HIV (Evans, 2016) and patients with hepatic or renal impairment with minimal 
potential for drug- drug interactions (Aapro, 2004).  
Antiemetic agents have been reported to be a key component of support care for acute abortive treatment during the prodromal and emetic phases of CVS in adults (Abell et al, 2008).  Abortive 
IV antiemetic agents such as the 5 -HT3 antagonist ondansetron at high doses (0.3–0.4 mg/kg up 
to 24 mg, q. 4–6 hours) and granisetron (10 µg/kg, q 4–6 hours) were reported for supportive treatment of acute vomiting episodes in CVS patients ( Li and Mis iewicz et al, 2003 ; Yang, 2010;  
Venkatasubramani, 2007 ). Despite the widespread use of 5 -HT3 antagonists in the treatment of 
CVS, there have been no definitive clinical trials conducted to  date.  
Alexza Pharmaceuticals (Alexza) is currently developing  Staccato® Granisetron for Inhalation 
(Staccato Granisetron ; AZ-010) as an acute treatment of CVS.  Staccato Granisetron represents a 
new dosage form of granisetron. It is a single-use, hand-hel d, drug- device combination product 
that delivers aerosolized granisetron.  From a drug development perspective, one of the most 
compelling characteristics of Staccato Granisetron is that the drug can be delivered 
non-invasively with rapid IV -like pharmacokinetics to individuals. In previous clinical studies 
with Staccato G ranisetron  and a number of drugs using the Staccato technology, mean peak 
plasma concentration was achieved within  minutes following inhalation.  In a first -in-human, 
single ascend ing dose study with Staccato Granisetron  (AMDC 010 -101; refer to CSR: 
IND 145,487 SN 0009), the median time to maximum plasma concentration was approximately 2 minutes for doses ranging from 0.5–3 mg.  
Staccato Granisetron may provide significant benefit f or the treatment of CVS  since it has rapid 
pharmacokinetics and bypasses GI absorption of the drug. Because of the simplicity of the 
delivery, the patient is only required to take a normal breath for delivery of the aerosolized drug . 
Consequently, inhalation via Staccato delivery could provide a non-invasive, rapid delivery  of 
granisetron and lead to a more rapid and effective control of acute vomiting episodes , 
represent ing an improvement to existing patient care . Consequently, this study (AMDC 010-201) 
is designed to assess the effects of Staccato G ranisetron as an acute treatment during an episode 
of CVS in patients with moderate to severe disease.  
4.2 Study Medication  Description  
4.2.1 Staccato Granisetron  for Inhalation  
Staccato granisetron  is a hand -held, single dose, single-use drug- device combination product 
using Alexza’s proprietary Staccato delivery system. Oral inhalation through the product initiates 
the controlled rapid heating of a thin film of excipient- free granisetron to form a thermally 
generated, highly pure drug vapor. The vapor condenses into aerosol particles with a particle size 
distribution appropriate for efficient delivery to the deep lung. The rapid absorption of the drug provides pea k plasma levels in the systemic circulation within minutes after administration.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 18 The principal components of Staccato G ranisetron  (shown schematically below) are as follows:  
• Breath sensor: The breath -activation mechanism that initiates actuation of the hea t source  
• Heat source ( i.e., heat package): The mechanism comprised of a reactant coating on the 
interior surface of a stainless -steel substrate that generates heat to vaporize the drug and 
produce the aerosol  
• Drug coating: The thin film of excipient- free granisetron  on the exterior surface of the 
stainless -steel substrate  
• Airway: The medical-grade plastic housing surrounding the heat package; it controls and 
directs the airflow over the vaporizing drug.  
 
Schematic Side -View of Staccato  Granisetron  
  
 The interior surface of the stainless -steel substrate of the heat package is coated with a mixture of 
zirconium and molybdenum trioxide powder with a clay binder. When activated, this undergoes 
a controlled, gasless, oxidation -reduction (redox) reaction that liberates heat. The redox reaction 
is initiated by a battery -activated starter inserted into the heat package. Inhalation through the 
product is detected by the breath sensor, causing the starter to initiate the redox reaction and subsequent rapid heating of the substrate to approximately 400°C. Heat then transfers into the 
film of granisetron  that is coated on the exterior surface of the substrate. The granisetron 
vaporizes in <  1 second, thereby limiting thermal decomposition. The vapor cools in the airfl ow 
and condenses to form aerosol particles that are characterized by a mass median aerodynamic diameter in the range of 1.0 to 3.5μm. The aerosolized granisetron is delivered to the lung within seconds of inhalation through the device. 
Each product is packaged inside a sealed foil pouch. Removal of a pull tab from the product 
renders it ready for use, as indicated by illumination of a green light. Successful dosing is signaled by the extinguishing of the green light.

4.4 Clinical Information for Staccato Granisetron  
While granisetron  has been available worldwide in various formulations for many years, AZ -010 
has been administered to healthy volunteers in a single ascending dose Phase 1 study 
(AMDC 010-101) and a multiple ascending dose study (AMDC 010-102). Study 
AMDC 010-101 was desi gned in 2 parts in separate cohorts of healthy volunteers. The primary 
objectives for each part are as follows.  For Part A  the purpose was t o examine the tolerability , 
safety , and pharmacokinetics of single ascending doses of 0.5, 1, and 3 mg of AZ 010 in healthy 
volunteers. The purpose of Part B  was to compare the pharmacokinetics and safety of a single 
dose of 1 mg of AZ-010 with that of 1 mg granisetron hydrochloride intravenous (IV) injection in healthy volunteers. The study was conducted in a total of 36 subjects at a single clinical research unit. Across the 3 doses of Part A, the drug was generally well tolerated with 3 of 8 subjects (6 AEs in total) in the 0.5 mg cohort, 3 of 8 subjects (6 AEs in total) in the 1 mg cohort, and 0 of 8 subjects in the 3 mg cohort reporting at least 1 adverse event. All adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and there were no serious adverse events (SAE).  
Study AMDC 010-102 was designed to examine the tolerability , safety , and pharmacokinetics 
(PK)  of AZ -010 following 7 days of dosing (up to 3 mg) in healthy volunteers. The data obtained 
from this study were  intended to guide selection of s afe and tolerable doses for the Phase 2 
clinical trial. The study was conducted in a total of 30 subjects (8 fo r each of the AZ-010 dose 
groups and 6 for placebo) at a single clinical research unit. Across the 3 doses the drug was generally well tolerated with a total of 13 of 30 subjects (43%) experiencing an AE (7 of 8 subjects for 0.5 mg; 0 of 8 subjects for 1.0 mg; 4  of 8 subjects for 3.0 mg of AZ-010 and 
2 of 6 subjects for p lacebo ) There were a total of 30 AEs reported with the most reported for 
Gastrointestinal diso rders (n  = 9) and Nervous System disorders (n  = 9). There were no clinical 
laboratory changes for serum chemistry or hematology or any changes in urinalysis between baseline and discharge that were notable. There were no serious adverse events (SAE) .

7.1 Study Design 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, efficacy and 
safety study of adult outpatients diagnosed with CVS and experiencing recurring episodes of 
stereotypical vomiting. Up to 5 administrations of study medication will be allowed  in an At 
Home environment . CVS patients between 18 and 60 years of age who have experienced at least 
3 episodes of recurrent vomiting in the last 12 months and 2 episodes in the last 6 months are eligible for participation. Approximately 50 patients will be randomized to each of 3 treatment 
groups: 1 mg AZ-010, 3 mg AZ -010, or matching Staccato Placebo ( Staccato device without 
drug coating). Randomization will be stratified by duration of the patient’s typical CVS episode into one of the f ollowing two categories: 1) Typical episode of CVS lasts 24 hrs or less from the 
first vomiting/retching event; 2) Typical episode of CVS lasts greater than 24 hrs from the first vomiting/retching event. 
There will be 3 Research Clinic visits and a home tr eatment period:  
 
 
Patients will be screened at the Research Clinic to determine if they are eligible for study 
participation no more than 14 days prior to Visit 2. After the study is explained to the patient and the patient has signed an informed consent  form (ICF), the investigator will establish the 
patient’s eligibility according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria via the following assessments: Medical history (with particular reference to history of vomiting symptoms, CVS diagnosis, typical durat ion of CVS episode (hrs  vs days), average number of vomiting/retching 
events in typical CVS episode, frequency of CVS episodes per year, any triggers for CVS episode, other GI conditions that may cause similar symptoms, treatment history, and current medications); full physical examination (including height, weight); vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure while sitting, respiratory rate, temperature); 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG); blood 
draw and urine sample for routine clinical labs (chemistry, hematology, urinalysis); and serum pregnancy test (in female participants of child -bearing potential). In light of the COVID -19

distancing and contact procedures should be take n to ensure patient safety when in the clinic.  
Patients who continue to be eligible to participate in the study will be asked to return to the 
Research Clinic for Visit 2. Patients meeting all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized to treatment with either 1  mg AZ -010, 3 mg AZ-010, or placebo in a 
1:1:1 ratio (active:active:placebo). Each randomized patient will receive training in the use of the Staccato device  and detailed instructions for the use of the ePD in the clinic as well as undergo a 
pre-test self -administration of their randomized study medication . Each patient will be monitored 
during a 2 hr observation period and have 12- lead ECG (triplicate) assess ments at pre -dose and 
2, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post dose. If there are no clinically-significant observations or abnormalities on the ECG, including QT prolongation, the patient will be provided with their  
Patient Kit that contains the remaining 5  unused Staccato devices in addition to the 1 Staccato 
device that they used in the clinic .  
Randomized patients will be asked to treat a subsequent CVS episode (with single daily dosing up to 5 consecutive days) within 12 weeks after the randomization date. Enrolled patients will self-administer the study medication when they know their CVS episode is imminent or as soon 
as possible after a CVS -related vomiting episode has begun. Patients will interact with their ePD 
prior to initiation of treatment (if possible) and to capture the study data. The ePD will be used to 
record the date and time of study medication administration, the number of vomiting and retching events, and the patient reported outcome measures (including the intensity and duration 
of the CVS episode, severity of abdominal pain, nausea, and anxiety/panic , and characteristics of 
the nausea, vomiting and retching over defined time periods). In addition, patients will complete a paper questionnaire to record the number of vomiting and retching eve nts within the 
first 24 hours after dosing. Patients will be instructed to contact the Research Clinic at the 
earliest possible tim e after initiation of dosing  and at any time should they require rescue 
medication,  medical assistance, or experience an intolerable  AE at home during the treatment 
period. If the number of vomiting and retching events are not recorded on the ePD or the 24 hour vomiting and retching questionnaire and the patient has unused study medication, that patient may be allowed to continue participation in the 12- week Home Treatment Period in order to treat 
a second CVS episode during this period. Patients will also record in the ir diary  any medications 
taken  during the Home Treatment period. Rescue medication s may in clude any agent(s) from the 
list described in Section 9.8; however for the purpose of defining the responder endpoint, only 
anti-emetic medications , benzodiazepines, and triptans will be considered a rescue medication . 
Patients are encouraged to avoid rescue medication use for the first 2 hrs following treatment with the study medication. The patient will be required to return to the Resea rch Clinic (Visit 3) 
within 3–5 days from the last study medication administration for final in -clinic assessments, to 
return the Patient Kit containing the used and unused study medication, ePD, and any other unused supplies. Conversely, patients will be asked to return to the Research Clinic after 
12 weeks with their unused Patient Kit if they did not treat a CVS episode within this time period. Visit 3 will include the following assessments: Vital signs; full physical examination; assessment for treatmen t emergent adverse events; 12 -lead ECG, concomitant medications 
(including rescue medication taken) , and clinical labs.

Patient safety will be monitored throughout the trial by the Investigator and supported by regular 
review by the Medical Monitor.  The subject will be tested to ensure they do not have the 
Hepatitis B or C virus , HIV, or COVID-19 during the screening period. Chemistry and 
hematology laboratory values will be assessed prior and subsequent to treatment of the CVS episode. Patients who experience intolerable symptoms during treatment may discontinue the 
study at the judgement of the Investigator. Patients may withdraw consent at any time
. 
All safety assessments will be carried out  according to the study Schedules of Events ( Table  1). 
Laboratory assessments are listed in the Appendix, Section 17.1 of the protocol. The

Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 mg AZ-010, 3 mg AZ-010, or matching Staccato 
Placebo (Staccato device without drug coating). Randomization will be stratified by duration of the patient’s typical CVS episode into one of the following two c ategories:  
1. Typical episode of CVS lasts 24 hrs or less from the first vomiting/retching event;  
2. Typical episode of CVS lasts greater than 24 hrs from the first vomiting/retching event.  
 
The randomization schedule will be generated prior to study start. All study patients, 
Investigators, and site study staff will be blinded to study medication assignment. Devices and packaging of AZ-010 and placebo be identical in appearance. 
7.4 Rationale for Study Design, Doses, and Primary Endpoint 
Double-blind, randomized, placebo -controlled studies are considered optimal for obtaining 
unbiased estimates of the efficacy and safety of investigational products. There have been no 
double-blind, randomized, placebo-c ontrolled studies assessing the acute treatment of CVS in 
adults prior to this trial.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 CVS is generally described as consisting of four phases. The hyperemesis phase usually starts 
from the early hours of the morning to noon, and is characterized by intense persistent nausea and repeated vomiting. The vomiting frequency can be up to eight times every hour (Fleisher  et al, 2005). This can last for 1 –7 days. Antiemetic agents have been reported to be a 
key component of support care for acute abortive treatment during the prodromal and emetic 
phases of CVS in adults ( Abell et al, 2008) . Abortive IV antiemetic agents such as the 5 -HT
3 
antagonists ondansetron at high doses and granisetron were reported for supportive treatment of acute vomiting episodes in CVS patients ( Li and Misiewicz et al, 2003 ; Yang, 2010; 
Venkatasubramani, 2007 ). 
Granisetron is a highly selective and potent 5- HT
3 receptor antagonist widely used fo r over 
twenty years as an effective antiemetic treatment ( Blower, 2003) . Because of its demonstrated 
effectiveness as an antiemetic treatment, granisetron was selected as the drug for development using the Staccato technology. One of the potential advantages of Staccato Granisetron (AZ-010) is rapid IV -like pharmacokinetics. In Phase 1 clinical trials with Staccato granisetron , 
mean peak plasma levels were achieved within minutes following inhalation . Because of this 
property, Staccato Granisetron offers flexibility compared to the IV route of administration since the patient can take the medication at home and achieve rapid drug exposure in a non-invasive way. In addition, as an abortive therapy, Staccato  Granisetron offers an advantage to oral 
treatments that may be difficult to administer to an individual with uncontrolled vomiting.  
IV administered g ranisetron at doses of 1 and 3 mg have been shown to be effective in treating 
nausea and vomiting. For example, a randomized, double-blind dose-ranging study for IV granisetron in the prevention of PONV found that a single dose of 1 mg or 3 mg resulted in a significant reduction in the numbers of patients experiencing postoperative nausea or vomiting during postoperative periods of 0–6 h and 0–24 h (78% and 77% of patients, respectively) (Wilson et al, 1996) . Granisetron was well tolerated and the optimum dose was 1 mg. Consensus 
guidelines for the prevention of PONV in adults recommend t reatment with 0.35 –3 mg IV 
granisetron or 4 mg IV ondansetron at the end of surgery ( Gan et al, 2014) .  
The selection of the 1 mg and 3 doses of AZ -010 for this study is supported by a Phase 1 study 
(AMDC 010 -101) demonstrating the equivalence of PK exposure between 1 mg AZ-010 and 
1 mg IV granisetron . In this crossover study conducted in healthy volunteers, mean peak  and 
total granisetron exposure (C
max and AUC) were similar for both routes of administration with 
both treatments yielding peak exposure within 2 minutes. The half- life w as the same with the IV 
and Staccato treatments  at 10 hr. Consequently, given the importance of the 1 and 3 mg IV doses 
for granisetron in treating nausea and vomiting noted above and the PK equivalence of IV and Staccato granisetron, doses of 1 mg and 3 mg AZ-010 were selected for this study.  
CVS is characterized by intense vomiting. The primary endpoint for this study is aimed at capturing the number of t imes the patient has vomited or retched ( which will be considered the 
same as vomiting in the enumeration of events) in the time period specified post dosing. This endpoint is the most direct assessment of the primary symptom and will be recorded by the patient in the e PD.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 30 7.6 Procedures for Protocol  
The following sections provide details  regarding the procedures to be performed at each study 
visit.  All of the following assessments should be made according to the Schedule of Events 
(Table  1). 
7.6.1 Visit 1: Screening Visit  
Patients  will report to the clinical site  for a scree ning examination between Day -14 and Day -1 
and the patient and clinical staff will follow all appropriate COVID -19 safety procedures. 
Prior to performing any study- related activities or evaluations, the patient  must be thoroughly 
informed about all aspects of the study  and sign the Informed Consent Form (ICF). Patients  will 
sign the study-specific consent form prior to any screening procedure. A signed copy of the ICF 
should be provided to each consenting patient  and with the original to be retained in the patient’s  
study records.  
For all study procedures, see the Schedule of Events ( Table  1). The following information and 
procedures will be performed and documented as part of the S creening assessment:  
• COVID-19 testing. 
• Assessment of eligibility according to inclusion/exclusion criteria . 
• Demographics, including sex, ethnic origin, date of birth. 
• Medical history (with emphasis on history of CVS noted above) including query for baseline 
signs/symptoms. 
• Review of prior and ongoing concomitant medications (taken in previous 30 days). 
• Complete physical examination plus height and weight. 
• Vital signs measured with the subject in a seated  position (for at least 2 minutes prior), 
including blood pressure, pulse rate , respiration rate , pulse oximetry, and temperature . 
• Standard 12-l ead ECG . 
• Blood samples for routine clinical labs (clinical chemistry, hematology).  
• Blood samples for serology (HIV, and hepatitis B and C evaluations ).

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 31 Compliance with inclusion criteria (listed in  Section  8.1) an d exclusion criteria (listed in  
Section  8.2) will be verified against information collected and documented in the case report 
form (eCRF). 
Once all inclusion criteria are met, exclusion crit eria ruled out, and laboratory measurements 
obtained and reviewed , consenting patients  are eligible for randomization into the study.  
7.6.2 Visit 2: Randomization  and Pre -test Study Medication Administration 
On arrival at the clinical site, all patients  will follow the appropriate COVID -19 procedures and 
undergo the following assessments, which will be documented: 
• COVID-19 testing. 
• Confirmation of eligibility according to inclusion/exclusion criteria .  
• Update of medical history including query for any pre- treatment adverse events. 
• Concomitant medication use since the Screening visit . 
• Physical examination plus weight. 
• Vital signs measured with the subject in a seated  position (for at least 2 minutes prior), 
including blood pressure, pulse rate , respiration rate,  pulse oximetry, and temperature . 
•  Randomization and assignment of Patient Kit. 
• Staccato device training.  
• ePD instructions and training. 
 
Upon determination of continued eligibility from above, the patient will undergo procedures to 
determine the safety and tolerability of their assigned (randomized) study medication.  Patients 
will be instructed to take a pouch from the ir assigned Patient Kit, open it and self – administer the 
medication  in the clinic. The patient should administer the dose while sitting or in a semi-supine 
position. They  will be assessed and monitored  pre-dose and following dosing for the next 2 hours 
as follows:  
• 12-lead ECG in triplicate at pre -dose and 2, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min post dose  
• Adverse Event assessment   
• Brief Physical examination at 120 min post dose 
 
Patients who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria  and have no 
clinically -significant observations or abnormalities o n the ECG following  administration of 
Study Medication ( either 1  mg AZ -010, 3 mg AZ-010, or placebo) will be provided with their  
Patient Kit that contains 5 unused Staccato devices in addition to the 1 Staccato devic e that was 
used in the clinic.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32 7.6.3 Home Treatment Period  
Randomized patients will be asked to treat a subsequent CVS episode within 12 weeks from the 
date that a patient receives their study medication for the Home Treatment Period . Enrolled 
patients will self -administer the study medication when they know their CVS episode is 
imminent or as soon as possible after a vomiting episode has begun. Patients will interact with 
their ePD CVS -related prior to initiation of treatment (if possible) and to capture the stu dy data. 
The ePD will be used to record the date and time of study medication. Prior to dosing, the patient will engage the ePD to mark the dosing and onset of episode. If the patient has an episode that does not resolve within 1 day of dosing then they may administer another study medication for up to a total of 5 consecutive days. As soon as possible, they should contact the clinical site to inform them of the onset of the episode and treatment with study medication. 
Patients will use the ePD and paper diaries to capture the study data. The ePD will be used to 
record the date and time of study medication administration,  use of rescue medication,  the 
number of vomiting and retching events  at various time points , and the patient reported outcome 
measures (including the intensity and duration of the CVS episode, severity of abdominal pain, nausea, and anxiety/panic, and characteristics of the nausea, vomiting and retching over defined time periods). In order to keep the patient practiced in using the ePD over the possible 12- week 
period and to maintain charge of the device, the patient will be required to interact daily with the device. Full details will be provided with the ePD training.  Patients will use paper diaries/logs to 
record  additional details regarding the timing of vomiting/retching events, concomitant 
medication use, and adverse events.  
Patients will be instructed to contact the Research Clinic at the earliest possible time after initiation of dosing and any time should they require rescue medication, medical assistance or experience an intolerable AE at home during the treatment period. Adverse events will be recorded separately by the patient in a paper diary.  In the case of intolerable symptoms following 
study medication administration, the patient may take a rescue medication. Permitted rescue medication s will not be provided to the patient, but it may include any agent(s) defined in the list 
in Section  9.8. Patients will record in the ir paper diary  any medications taken during the Home 
Treatment period . Patients are encouraged to avoid rescue medication use for the first 2 hrs 
following treatment with the study medication . In the case of extreme distress,  the patient should 
contact the clinical site and/or receive treatment from a health care facility.  
Patients will be instructed to contact the study site when a CVS episode and dosing occurs (and study sites should try to contact a patient when they receive a notification that that patient has dosed) so that the study site may  schedule the Follow up Visi t to the clinic within 3–5 days after 
the last dose of study medication is taken  (or if the 12 -week treatment period has expired and the 
patient has not yet treated a CVS episode) . These latter patients will be excluded from the 
efficacy analyses since they did not take any study medication to treat a CVS episode. 
If the number of vomiting and retching events are not recorded on the ePD or the 24 hour vomiting and retching questionnaire and the patient has unused study medication, that patient may be allowe d to continue participation in the 12- week Home Treatment Period in order to treat 
a second CVS episode during this period.

Patients who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study will not be replaced.  
8.3.1 Patient Withdrawal Procedures  
A patient who prematurely discontinues study participation should have all Visit 3  assessments 
performed as an Early Termination Visit, (See  Table  1).  
If a patient t erminates ear ly from the study, the Investigator will record the reason(s) for early 
termination on the relevant electronic case report form ( eCRF ). The specific reason for the 
withdrawal should be carefully documented on the eCRF. 8.4 Emergency Unblinding of Treatment Assignment  
In the case of a medical requirement to break the blind to determine appropriate treatment for an 
adverse event, unblinding of a patient’s treatment assignment can be achieved through the 
study- specific Interactive Web Response System.  If possible,  the Investigator should discuss the 
circumstances with the Medical Monitor(s) prior to accessing unblinding information.  In the 
event of a blind break, the Medical Monitor(s) will be notified through the electronic data capture system.  The patient for whom the blind is broken should be subsequently withdrawn 
from the study . The details regarding the process of breaking the blind are outlined in the

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 10 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
All assessments and procedures will be performed according to the Schedule of Events ( Table  1). 
10.1 Demograp hic Characteristics and Medical History  
Demographic characteristics [i.e., sex, ethnic origin, date of birth, and height and weight will be 
collected at the S creening V isit and detailed on the eCRF. 
Prior to randomization. t he patient’s typical CVS  episode will be classified by usual duration into 
one of the following two categories:  
1. Typical episode of CVS lasts 24 hrs or less from the first vomiting/retching event;  
2. Typical episode of CVS lasts greater than 24 hrs from the first vomiting/retching event.  
 
A thorough medical history with particular reference to history of vomiting symptoms, CVS 
diagnosis, typical duration of CVS episode (hrs  vs days), average number of vomiting/retching 
events in typical CVS episode, frequency of CVS episodes per year, any triggers for CVS episode, other GI conditions that may cause similar symptoms, treatment history, and current medications  and co -morbi dities  will be collected at the Screening Visit and Randomization Visit 
for each dose group. 
10.2 Vital Signs,  Weight, and Height 
Vital signs will be measured after the patient has been in a seated  positi on for at least 2 minutes 
and will include  blood pressure , pulse rate, respiratory rate , and temperature . 
Patients should wear light clothing, empty pockets of heavy objects, and remove his/her shoes 
before weight is measured.  Height will be measured after the patient has removed his/her shoes.  
Height will only be measured at the Screening Visit.  
10.3 Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination will include an examination of all major organ systems to include, but not be limited to, chest auscultation, abdominal auscultation and palpation, head, eyes, ears, n ose and throat, and will exclude urinary and reproductive systems. A brief physical 
examination will be symptom directed.  
10.4 Electrocardiogram  
Twelve -lead electrocardiograms will be performed  after the patient  has rested in a supine or 
semi -supine position for at least 5 minutes. Individual parameters including heart rate, PR, QT, 
QTcF, QRS, and RR intervals will be collected.  Repeat electrocardiograms (if deemed 
necessary) should be performed at least 5 minutes apart. The Investigato r should indicate review 
of the electrocardiogram report by signing and dating the report. ECGs performed on Day 1 for pre-test assessment will be collected in triplicate for the pre -dose and post-dose collection times. 
The initial ECGs should be performed in a semi -supine position to accommodate appropriate 
dosing of the product.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 10.5 Clinica l Laboratory Assessments  
The list of clinical laboratory assessments to be performed is included in  the 
Appendix, Section  17.1. Specific days for c linical laboratory assessments can be found in  the 
Schedule of Events (Table  1). 
The results of clinical laboratory tests conducted at the Screening V isit must be assessed by the 
Investigator to determine each subject’s eligibility for participation in the study.  The Investigator 
should indicate review of the laboratory reports by adding their initials to the report.   
Any significant abnormalities should be fully investigated. Whenever possible, the etiology of 
the abnor mal findings will be documented . Laboratory results with significantly abnormal values 
should be investigated  as such  and checked for verification . Additional tests and other 
evaluations required to establish the significance or etiology of an abnormal result or to monitor the course of an AE should be obtained when clinically indicated. In particular, if a clinically significant abnormal result is observed that is not resolved by the final study visit, repeat tests will be performed if possible and resolution or stability of the abnormality  will be recorded in the 
source documentation. 
Any significant laboratory abnormalities that are either serious or unexpected will be promptly 
reported to Alexza’s Medical  Monitor. Any additional relevant laboratory results obtained by the 
Investigator during the course of this study will be reported to Alexza Pharmaceuticals or its representative . 
10.6 24 Hour Vomiting and Retching Questionnaire  
The 24 hour vomiting and retching questionnaire is a paper questionnaire on which patients will record the date of dosing with study medication and the total number vomiting and retching 
events that occurred within the first 24 hours after dosing. A vomiting or retching event is defined as one or more continuous episodes of vomiting (expulsion of stomach contents through the mouth) or retching/dry heaves (an attempt to vomit that is not productive of stomach 
contents). If there is a break of at least 1 minute between vomiting and retching events, those 
should be considered two different events. In addition to the 24 hour vomiting and retching questionnaire, patients will record the number of vomiting and retching events that they experience within the first 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes on the ePD. 
10.7 Visual  Analog Scale (VAS) 
The visual analog scale is a scale of continuou s measure initially developed for pain that has 
been used in a variety of clinical settings where the endpoint of interest is based on a subjective 
perception. The visual analog scale is a distinct 100- millimeter line anchored on the left end (0) 
at no degree of impairment and on the right end (100) at full degree of impairment, where indication of the degree of impairment perceived at the time of assessment is captured by marking the appropriate position on the line between the anchor points. The measur ed distance 
of the mark from the left anchor will be recorded in millimeters  and this scale will be adapted for 
the ePD.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 There will be 3 different VAS scales assessed  in the study. In each case the patient will be asked 
to rate the appropriate variable in relation to their last vomiting/retching episode:  
• The assessment of abdominal pain whereby 0 = no pain and 100 = worst possible pain; 
• The assessment of nausea whereby 0 = no nausea and 100 = worst possible nausea; 
• The assessment of anxiety/panic whereby 0 = no anxiety/panic and 100 = worst possible 
anxiety/panic. 
 
10.8 Rhodes Index of Nausea, V omiting, and R etching (RINVR)  
The RINVR is designed to assess the degree of nausea distress and vomiting distress in patients. 
It is composed of 8 questions and each question has 5 choices (see Appendix, Section 17.4) . 
Questions 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8 deal with symptom occurrence and Questions 2, 3, 5 deal with degree 
of discomfort of the individual symptoms. Individual questions can be tracked over time or a 
composite score can be formed by adding the total of the symptom occurrence and degree of discomfort questions together.  This scale will be adapted for the ePD and patients will be 
prompted to answer the questions according to the Schedule of Events ( Table  1). 
10.9 Intensit y of Attack Scale 
The Intensity of Attack scale is designed to assess the severity of the last vomiting/retching episode at the time of assessment. Severity ranges from Mild to Excruciating  on a 4 point scale. 
This scale will be adapted for the ePD and  patients will be prompted to answer the questions  
according to the Schedule of Events (Table  1). 
10.10 Prior E pisode  Questionnaire  
The Prior Episode Questionnaire is designed to compare the overall intensity and duration of the current CVS episode with CVS episodes that the patient has typically experienced in the past. For both Intensity and Duration, the patient will respond whether the current episode overall was Less than, the Same as, or Greater than their typical previous CVS episodes. The questions will be prompted  approximately 24 hours after each dose of study medication is administered.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 11 ADVERSE EVENTS  
11.1 Definition of Adverse Events  
An adverse ev ent is any untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a patient 
during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant 
illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the patient’s health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology. Any worsening (i .e., any clinically significant adverse change in 
the frequency or intensity of a pre-existing condition) should be considered an adverse event. A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the adverse event page of the eCRF rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome. 
All patients will be monitored for adverse events during the study.  Assessments may include 
monitoring of the following parameters: the patient’s cl inical symptoms, laboratory, physical 
examination findings, or findings from other tests and/or procedures.  
An adverse event reported after informed consent, but before the first dose of study medication, 
will be considered a pretreatment adverse event  (or interim medical event) and will be captured 
on the eCRF . Adverse events will be considered treatment -emergent if the onset is after the first 
dose of study drug.  
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an adverse event if the abnormality: 
• Is con sidered clinically significant; OR  
• results in discontinuation from the study; OR 
• is judged by the Investigator to be of significant clinical importance requiring treatment, 
modification/interruption of investigational product dose, or any other therapeutic intervention. 
 
Regardless of severity grade, only laboratory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a serious adverse event.  
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the adverse event eCRF. If the abnormality was not a part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as the adverse event. If possible, the laboratory abnormality should be rec orded as a medical term and not 
simply as an abnormal laboratory result (e .g., record thrombocytopenia rather than decreased 
platelets).  
11.2 Evaluation of Adverse Event s  
A qualified Investigator will evaluate all adverse events as to seriousness, severity/int ensity, and 
relationship to Study Medication , duration, action taken, and outcome. 
Staccato Granisetron (AZ -010) 28 APR 2020 
Protocol AMDC 010 -201 Amendment 2 Alexza Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 44 11.2.1 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is an adverse event, as per Title 21 CFR 312.32 and ICH E2A.II.B that 
fulfills the following criteria:  
• Is fatal (results in death);  
• Is life -threatening (Note: the term "life -threatening" refers to an event in which the patient 
was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that could hypothetically have caused death had it been more severe);  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (hospitalization 
is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay); 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
patient 's ability to conduct normal life functions); 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
• Constitutes an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. 
 
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result  in death, hospitalization, or disability, but may jeopardize the patient or 
require medical or surgical intervention to prev ent one of the other outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization.  
Event s not considered  to be serious adverse events are hospitalizations for:  
• A procedure for protocol/disease-related investigations (e.g., sampling for laboratory tests). 
However, hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication of such procedur es 
remains a reportable serious adverse event.  
• Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization for technical, practical, or social reasons, in absence of an adverse event.  
• A procedure that is planned (i.e., planned prior to the starting of treatment on study); must be 
documented in the source document and the eCRF. Hospitalization or prolonged 
hospitalization for a complication remains a reportable serious adverse event.  
• An elective treatment of or an elective procedure for a pre-existing medical condition that does not worsen.  
• Emergency outpatient treatment or observation that does not result in admission, unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 45 If an adverse event is considered serious, the adverse event eCRF must be completed.  
For each serious adverse event, the Investigator will provide information on severity, start and 
stop dates, relationship to investigational product, action taken regarding investigational product, 
and outcome. 
Queries pertaining to serious adverse events will  be handled through the electronic data capture 
system or other appropriate means. Urgent queries (e.g., missing causality assessment) may be 
handled by telephone. 
11.2.2 Severity/Intensity  
For both adverse events and serious adverse events, the Investigator must assess the 
severity/intensity of the event.  
The N ational C ancer Institute -Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) 
Version  5.0 should be used to grade the severity/intensity of all events.  These criteria will be  
provided in a study manual. If a CTCAE criterion does not exist, the I nvestigator should grade 
the severity according to the following criteria:  
• Grade 1 (mild): does not interfere with the patient’s usual function  
• Grade 2 (moderate): interferes to some extent with patient's usual fun ction  
• Grade 3 (severe): interferes significantly with patient's usual function  
• Grade 4 (life -threatening): results in a threat to life or in an incapacitating disability  
• Grade 5 (death): results in death  
 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  This criterion is not the same as “serious” which is based 
on patient/e vent outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s 
life or functioning.  
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining regulatory obligations. 11.2.3 Relationship to Study Medication  
Relationship should be assessed and provided for every adverse event/serious adverse event 
based on currently available information. Relationship is to be reassessed and provided as additional information becomes available.  Adverse events will be classified by the Investigator 
as follows: 
Staccato Granisetron (AZ -010) 28 APR 2020 
Protocol AMDC 010 -201 Amendment 2 Alexza Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 46 Related  for Regulatory Reporting Assessment:  
Definitely Related : There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test 
result , occurs in a plausible time relationship to drug administration and cannot be explained by 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  The event resolves or improves upon withdrawal 
of drug (de- challenge).  The event would be considered as definitely related to the Study 
Medication upon results of a positive re- challenge procedure.  
Probably Related : There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred 
within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication).  However , the influence of 
other factors that may have contributed to the event (e.g., the patient’s clinical condition, other concurrent disease, concomitant medications or events) is unlikely, and the event follows a clinically reasonable response upon withdrawal of drug (de- challenge).   
Possibly Related: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the Study Medication). However, the influence of other factors may have contributed t o the event (e.g., the patient’s clinical condition, other 
concurrent disease, concomitant medications or events).  
Unrelated for Regulatory Reporting Assessment:  
Unlikely Related : A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose tempo ral 
relationship to drug administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication) and in which other drugs or concurrent or underlying disease provide plausible explanations (e.g., the patient’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
Not related : The adverse event is completely independent of Study Medication administration, 
and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology.  There must be an 
alternative, definitive etiology documented by the clinician. 
11.2.4 Duration 
For all adverse events whether or not considered serious, the Investigator will provide a record of 
the start and stop dates of the event.  Every effort should be made to resolve all adverse events 
with continued follow-up with the patient until appropriate resolution can be achieved. If an 
event is unresolved at the end of the study it will be recorded as ongoing.  
11.2.5 Action Taken 
The Investigator will record the action taken with investigational product as a result of an 
adverse event or serious adverse event on the eCRF , as applicable (e.g., discontinuation, or 
interruption of investigational product, as appropriate) and record if concomitant and/or additional treat ments were given for the event. 
11.2.6 Outcome  
The Investigator will record the outcome of adverse events on the eCRF, as applicable (e.g., recovered, recovered with sequelae, not recovered, or death (due to the adverse event)).

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 47 11.3 Follow- Up 
Adverse events assessed as not related to Study Medication, including clinically significant 
laboratory tests, ECGs , or physical examination findings, must be followed until the event 
resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained, or the final study visit occurs, 
whichever comes first.   
Adverse events assessed as related to Study Medication and serious adverse events will be followed for as long as necessary to adequately evaluate the patient’s safety, or until the event stabilizes, is otherwise expla ined, death occurs, or the patient is lost to follow -up. If resolved, a 
resolution date should be provided. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow -up 
includes any supplemental investigations indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causal ity of the 
adverse event.  This may include additional clinical laboratory testing or investigations, 
examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals as is practical.  
11.4 Pregnancy  
The Sponsor must be informed within 24 hours upon learning that a patien t, or male patien t’s 
partner, has becom e pregnant any time after the first dose of Study Medication until 4 weeks 
after the  last dose of Study Medication. Patien t pregnancies (or pregnancy of a male patien t’s 
partner) must be followed until termination of pregnancy or the birth of the child.  
If a female partner of a male patien t taking investigational product becomes pregnant, the male 
patien t taking the investigational product should notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female 
partner shou ld be advised to call her healthcare provider immediately.  
11.5 Recording Adverse Events  
All adverse events (regardless of seriousness or relationship to Study Medication) including 
those from the time informed consent is obtained through to the final study vis it are to be 
recorded in the eCRF.  Each individual adverse event is to be listed as a separate entry.  The 
Investigator will provide information about dates of onset and resolution, seriousness, severity, 
action(s) taken, outcome, and relationship to the Study Medication. All adverse events should be 
documented in the patient’s source documents. 
11.6 Reporting Adverse Events  
The Investigator must report to Sponsor or its designee all adverse events that occur during the 
study from the time written informed consent is given until the final study visit or early 
termination, regardless of their relationship to the Study Medication. Serious adver se events and 
pregnancies will be reported from the time written informed consent is given through 30 days beyond the last dose of Study Medication. 
11.6.1 Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator is required to notify the Sponsor, and the Sponsor’s desi gnated Drug Safety 
Unit within 24 hours after becomi ng aware of the occurrence of a serious adverse event . All 
serious adverse events will be reported through completion of the adverse event eCRF. The 
Investigator will be responsible for reporting serious adverse events to the IRB.

If an Investigator becomes aware of a serious adverse event within 30 days after the last dose of 
Study Medication and it is considered by him/her to be caused by the Study Medication with a reasonable p ossibility, the event must be documented and reported through completion of the 
adverse event  eCRF . 
11.6.2 Repor ting Urgent Safety Issues  
If the study site staff becomes aware of an actual or potential urgent safety issue, then the Sponsor and Medical Monitor mus t be immediately contacted so that appropriate urgent safety 
measures can be agreed upon.  An urgent safety issue is defined as:  
• An immediate hazard to the health or safety of patients participating in a clinical study 
• A serious risk to human health or potentially a serious risk to human health 
 
An urgent safety issue may include: (1) issues with an investigational drug or comparators; 
(2) study procedures; (3) inter current  illness (including pandemic infections); (4) concomitant 
medications; (5) concurrent medical conditions; or (6) any other issues related to the safe conduct of the study or that pose a risk to study patients. 
In exceptional circumstances of imminent hazard and in order to safeguard the health or safety of 
individuals, the Investigators may  take urgent safety measures before informing the Sponsor, but 
the Sponsor must be informed immediately after the hazard has resolved.

Full details for statistical methods will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan . 
12.2 Interim Analysis  
No formal statistical interim analysis is planned .  
12.3 Determination of Sample Size  
This is a proof of concept study. There are no studies in the literature to provide reliable 
estimates of active treatment or placebo response rates using vomiting /retching  events, or the 
estimate of variances around these measures, in patients with CVS  being treated acutely with an 
abortive therapy. Consequently, sa mple size was not based on power calculations. 
Approximately 150 patients will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups. An N of 50 per group should be sufficient to describe and compare across the efficacy parameters.

before analysis.  Abnormal, clinically significant laboratory values will be reported and 
summarized as adverse events.  
Adverse Events  
An adverse event reported after informed consent, but befor e the first dose of study medication, 
will be considered a pre- treatment adverse event  (or interim medical event). Treatment -emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) will be defined as any adverse event that occurs after administration of the first dose of study medication until the Follow Up Visit or the Early Termination Visit. The number and percentage of patients who report TEAEs will be summarized by system organ class and preferred term. 
Treatment emergent adverse events will also be summarized by intensity as well as relationship 
to study drug. 
Patients who report the same preferred term on multiple occasions will be coun ted once for the 
preferred term: under the highest severity when summarized by severity and under the closest 
relationship to study medication when summarized by relationship. If a patient reports multiple 
preferred terms for a system organ class, the pati ent will be counted only once for that system 
organ class.  
The number and percentage of patients who experience TEAEs will be summarized by dosing regimen for the following: 
• By system organ class and preferred term  
• By severity/intensity, system organ class, and preferred term

Act of 1992, will not be allowed to conduct or work on studies sponsored by Alexza Pharmaceuticals.  The Investigator is required to immediately disclose to the Sponsor in writing, 
if any person involved in the conduct of the study is debarred pursuant to a hearing by the FDA 
under this anti-fraud law, or if any proceeding for debarment is pending, or is (to the best of the Investigator’s knowledge) threatened.  
The Investigator is responsible for keeping a record of all patients who sign an informed consent 
document and are screened for entry into the study. Patients who fail screening must have the reason(s) recorded in the patient’s source documents.  
The Investigator should inform the IRB of any event likely to affect the safety of patients or the continued conduct of the study, in particular any change in safety. Additionally, all updates to the 
Investigator’s Brochure will be sent to the IRB.  A progress report will be sent to the IRB and the

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 55 protocol will be reviewed annually (e.g., re-approved) or more frequently, as required by the IRB 
or local regulations.  
The Investigator will maintain a copy of all correspondence with the IRB, including copies of 
approved documents. The Investigator will also maintain a copy of the IRB membership list with occu pation and qualification (or a statement confirming compliance with GCP requirements for 
committee composition).   
The Investigator will notify the IRB of the conclusion of the clinical study within 1 month of completion or termination of the study.  The final report sent to the IRB will also be sent to the 
Sponsor along with the completed electronic case report forms (eCRFs) and all necessary regulatory documents, thereby fulfilling the Investigator’s regulatory responsibility.  
The Investigator, or a designa ted member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to patient records (e.g., medical records, office charts, hospital charts, and study -related charts) for source data 
verification.  The Investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of eCRFs and queries.  
13.4 Protocol Amendments  
Any change to the protocol, whether it is an overall change or a change for specific study center(s), must be handled as a protocol amendmen t. All amendments to the protocol will be 
written by the Sponsor. Except for deviations that are necessary to protect the health or safety of the participants, Investigators must await IRB approval of protocol amendments before deviating from an IRB -approved protocol. A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate 
hazard to patients should be implemented immediately, and the IRB notified within 5 days. The Sponsor will ensure submission of any protocol amendments to the appropriate regulatory agencies.  
When the amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design and/or increases the potential risk to the patient, the currently approved written ICF will require similar modification.  
In such cases, repeat informed consent will be obt ained from patients enrolled in the study before 
continued participation under the new amendment. 
13.5 Audits and Inspections  
The Sponsor’s Quality Assurance Unit (or representative) may conduct audits at the study site(s).  
Audits will include, but are not limited to: drug supply, presence of required documents, the 
informed consent process, laboratory specimen processing, and comparison of eCRFs with source documents.  The Investigator agrees to cooperate with audits conducted at a reasonable 
time and in a reaso nable manner. 
Regulatory authorities worldwide may also audit the Investigator during or after the study. The Investigator should contact the Sponsor immediately if this occurs, and must fully cooperate with the audits conducted at a reasonable time in a reasonable manner.  
The Investigator is required to make all study documentation promptly available for inspection, review or audit at the study site upon request by Sponsor, its representatives, or any appropriate regulatory agencies.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 57 14 DATA H ANDLING AND R ECORDKEEPING  
14.1 Confidentiality  
All information disclosed or provided by the Sponsor (or designee), or generated or produced 
during the study including, but not limited to, the protocol, the eCRFs, the Investigator’s Brochure, and the results obt ained during the course of the study, are confidential.  The 
Investigator or any person under his/her authority agrees to keep confidential and not to disclose the information to any third party without the prior written approval of the Sponsor. 
Submission of this protocol and any other necessary documentation to the IRB is expressly 
permitted, IRB members having the same obligation of confidentiality. Authorized regulatory officials and S ponsor personnel (or designee) will be allowed full access to inspect and copy the 
records.  The copied and inspected records will remain at the site and will not be transmitted or 
removed from the site.  Study Medication, patient bodily fluids, and/or other materials collected 
shall be used solely in accordance with this protocol, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Sponsor and responsible ethics committee(s) or regulatory authorities.  
Patients’ names may, however, be made known to a regulatory agency or other authorized officials in the event of inspections. Documents containing the full name or other personally identifiable information of the patient are to remain at the site.  This information will not be 
transferred to the Sponsor nor be contained in regulatory filings.  
14.2 Patient Data Protection  
Prior to any testing under this protocol, including screening tests and assessments, candidates 
must also provide all authorizations required by local law (e.g., protected health information  
authorization).  
Patients will be identified only by unique patient numbers in eCRFs and other datasets generated 
for this study.  The patient will not be identified by name in the eCRF, in any study samples or 
study reports. All data generated in this study is for research purposes only. The Sponsor, its partner(s) and designee(s), and various government health agencies may inspect the records of this study. Every effort will be made to keep the patient’s personal medical data confidential.  
The Sponsor will protect individual patient information to the fullest extent possible during this study. At no time will a patient become identified in any publication or presentation.  However, 
the patient may have to become identified in the event of a regulatory authority audit or inspection in order to verify the accuracy of the data.  Access to patien t information is at the 
discretion of the Sponsor and cannot occur prior to database lock or other specified events as determined solely by the discretion of the Sponsor. 
14.3 Data Collection  
All data obtained for analysis in the clinical study described in this protocol will use an 
electronic data capture system.  Data reported in the eCRFs should be consistent with and 
substantiated by the patient’s medical record and original source documents. Any discrepancies must be explained.

Protocol AMDC 010 -201 Amendment 2 Alexza Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 58 Prior to the start of the stu dy, the Principal Investigator will complete a Delegation of Authority 
form (Site Signature and Delegation Log), showing the signatures and handwritten initials of all 
individuals and the delegation of responsibilities, such as identifying those individual s who are 
authorized to make or change entries on eCRFs. 
14.4 Case Report Form Completion  
Data within the eCRF will be monitored by a Clinical Research Associate according to the 
Monitoring Plan. Queries will be generated based on discrepancies found while moni toring. Site 
personnel will review and respond to these queries appropriately. Additionally, the Sponsor’s designee and the Sponsor may periodically perform aggregate data reviews, which could result in queries being generated for site personnel resolution . The completed eCRF for each patient must 
be signed and dated by the Principal Investigator to signify that the Principal Investigator has reviewed the eCRF and certifies it to be complete and accurate.  
14.5 Database Management, Data Clarification, and Quality Assurance 
The Sponsor’s designee (i.e., a designated Contract Research Organization) will be responsible for data management.  Data Management will develop a Data Management Plan ( DMP ) 
document, and provide it to the Sponsor for approval. The DMP document will define all activities in the data collection and cleaning process.  The detailed DMP will be based on the 
protocol, work scope, contract, analysis plans, data-flows, eCRFs, data cleaning procedures, other supporting documents, and data management stand ards and practices.  
The programmed data validations will be run to check for database completeness and consistency, and queries will be generated upon data entry or via review by a Clinical Data Manager after entry.  The sites will respond to the data queri es in a timely manner.  
Quality control procedures will be conducted prior to database lock according to the designated Contract Research Organization standard operating procedures. 
When the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked. Any changes 
to the database after that time will only be made by joint written agreement between the Sponsor, 
Statistician, Data Manager, and Quality Assurance Auditor according to designated standard operating procedures of the Contract Research Organization. 
14.6 Inspection of Records  
According to the ICH guidelines for GCP, the Sponsor or designee must verify data entered in 
the eCRF entries against the source documents. The objective of source document verification is to comply with GCP and internat ional regulatory requirements and to reduce the risks of fraud.  
Source document verification means ensuring that source documents are an accurate and confirmable reflection of the patient’s evaluations during participation in the study and that all relevan t information recorded in the source document is accurately entered into the eCRF. All 
source documents should be correctly labeled and filed and associated with a single, verifiable patient.  
All data required for this study should be captured in source notes.  No data obtained by the 
Investigator or other study personnel should be captured directly in the eCRF. All source

Protocol AMDC 010 -201 Amendment 2 Alexza Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 59 documents pertaining to this study will be maintained by the Investigator and made available for 
inspection by authorized persons. If ele ctronic progress notes and other electronic source 
documents are not compliant with applicable regulatory guidance, they are not considered a valid source for this study . All patient progress notes must be dated and signed at the time of the visit. 
The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study for refusal of the Investigator to supply original source documentation for this clinical study.  
The Investigator will note in a source independent from the eCRF the following information: 
• Information to confirm that the patient exists ( e.g., initials, date of birth, and sex); 
• Confirmation that the patient satisfies the inclusion/exclusion criteria;  
• Confirmation that the patient is taking part in the clinical study; 
• Confirmation of the informed consent proce ss; 
• Visit dates and documentation of protocol assessments and procedures; 
• Information concerning all adverse events;  
• Details of concomitant and investigational medications.  
 
Source document verification is not a substitute for clinical study monitoring, the purpose of 
which is to ensure that the protocol has been followed correctly, the eCRF has been fully and accurately completed, source document verification has been carried out, and the study timelines and enrollment goals and requirements have been met. 
14.7 Retention of Records  
For investigational drug studies, clinical Investigators must retain study records for a period of 
2 years following the date a marketing application is approved for the drug for the indication for 
which it is being inve stigated; or, if no application is to be filed or if the application is not 
approved for such indication, until two years after the investigation is discontinued and FDA is notified. 
The Investigator must maintain all study documentation as confidential, a nd take measures to 
prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents.  
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor prior to destroying any study essential documents. If the Investigator can no longer ensure archiving, he/she shall inform the Sponsor. The relevant 
records shall be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee.

CONFIDENTIAL  3 SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Number:  
SCT-MD-60 
Title:  
A R
andomized, Mult icenter, D ouble -Blind, Flexibly -dosed, Efficacy and Safety Study of Escitalopram in 
the Treatment of Children and Adolescents With Generalized Anxiety Disorder  
Investigational Product : 
Escitalopra
m 
Study Centers:  
Approximately 40 centers in the United Stat es 
Phase:  
Phase 3  
Objectives: 
The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of escitalopram relative to placebo 
in the acute 
treatment of children (aged 7 through 11 years) and adolescents (aged 12 through 17 years) 
who meet criteria for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5).  
The secondary objective of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetic  (PK) profile 
 of escitalopram 
in the pe diatric population (aged 7 through 17 years).  
The exploratory objective of this study is to assess the exposure/dos e-response relationship.  
Study Design:  
This is a randomized, multicenter, double -blind, flexib ly-dosed, placebo- controlled parallel group stu dy.  
During the coronaviru s disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic, remote study visits are possible to avoid 
missing efficacy data, but not preferred  over clinic visits .  
Number of Subjects:  
Approximately 430 subjects w ill be screened and a total of approximately 256 subjects are planned to be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either escitalopram or placebo.  The randomization schedule will be stratified 
by age at randomization (grouped as 7– 11 years vs. 12– 17 years) and sex, and blocked.  The sample size 
may be increased based on the outcome of a blinded interim analysis but the number of subjects in each treatment arm will be capped at  160. 
Treatment:  
Subjects will begin with a 10 mg/day dose of escitalopram (taken orally) or matching placebo for the first 
2 weeks of doubl 
e-blind treatment. At the end of Week 2, subjects who can tolerate the current dose of 
10 mg/day may have a dose escalation to 20  mg/day of escitalopram or matching placebo. Dose 
escalation will be at the investigator’s discretion taking into account the Clinical Global Impression of 
Severity (CGI -S) score. Subjects who remain on the 10 mg/day dose of escitalopram or matching placebo 
will be evaluated again at Week 4 for a possible dose escalation to 20 mg/day at the investigator’s discretion .
 The dose  may be decreased from 20 mg/day to 10 mg/day following discussion with the 
medical director if the subject does not tolerate the 20 mg/day dose.  
Study Duration:  
The study design incorporates an up to 3-week screening period, an 8 -week double -blind, acute treatment 
period, and a 1-week double -blind down taper period with a follow -up telephone contact 1 week after the 
end of the double -blind down taper period.

The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline to acute treatment endpoint (Week 8) in the 
PARS sever
ity score.  
The PARS severity score for GAD is assessed for all symptoms identified in the generalized anxiety 
section of  th
e PARS symptom checklist. The PARS severity score for GAD will be derived by summing

CONFIDENTIAL  o Remission is defined as PARS severity score for GAD <8 (using 6 PARS items: 2, 3,  4, 
5, 6, and 7)  
• Change on the CGI -S from baseline to acute treatment endpoint (Week 8) 
o Remission rate on CGI -S at acute t reatment endpoint (Week 8). Remission rate is 
defined as the percentage of subjects having a CGI -S score ≤2 at endpoint.  
• Change on the Children’ s Global Assessment Scale ( CGAS ) from baseline to acute treatment 
endpoint (Week 8)  
o Remission rate on the CGAS at acute treatment endpoint (Week 8 ). Functi onal 
remission is defined as CGAS >70.  
• COVID -19 impact assessment score at each visit.  
The safety endpoints during the double -blind treatm ent period are as follows:  
• Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events.  
• Observed values and change from bas eline in vital signs (blood pressure, pulse  rate, temperature, 
respiration  rate, height, weight, BMI, height percentile, weight percentile, and BMI percentile); 
incidence of vital sign potentially clinically significant (PCS) values . 
• Observed values and changes from baseline in E CG interval s and interpretation; incidence of 
ECG PCS values . 
• Observed values and changes from baseline in  clinical lab oratory assessments (hematology, 
chemistry, and urinalysis) ; incidence of clinical laboratory PCS values . 
• Incidence of suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behavior  as determin ed by the C -SSRS.  
The PK endpoint  is as follo ws: 
• PK parameters of es citalopra m using a nonlinear mixed effects  approach . 
The e xposure/ dose-response  endpoints  are as follows : 
• Relationship b etween effi cacy parameters and plasma exposure using a nonlinear mixed effects 
approach. The relatio nship between safety parameters and plasma exposure may also be 
explored.  
Efficacy  Assessments:  
The efficacy
 assessments include  the PARS sev erity score for  GAD, CGI -S, the CGAS , and a global 
COVID -19 impact assessment.  
Safety  Assessments: 
The safety a
ssessments include adver se events, vital signs, physical exam ination , ECG s, laboratory 
assessments , and the C -SSRS.  
Pharmacokinetic Assessments:  
Plasma concentr ations of esc italopram and S -demethylcitalopram . 
Statistical Analysis : 
For the an
alysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (change from baseline in PARS severity score), a mixed 
model for
 repeated measures (MMRM) will be used for the comparison of escitalopram to placebo at 
Week 8. The significance test for the difference in means at Week 8 will be based on least squares  means 
using a 2 -sided α of 0.05.

CONFIDENTIAL  6 INTRODUCTION 
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of t he most frequently occ urring childhood 
anxiety disorders1. In the United States, an estimated 2.2% of adolescents (aged 13 
through 18 years) had GAD, with  an estima ted 0.9% having severe impairment  based 
on data published in 2010. The prevalence of GAD among adolescents was higher for 
females (3.0%) than for males (1.5%)2. 
An anxiety disorder such as GAD in children and adolescents increases the risk for 
substance abuse and suicida
l ideation and suicide attempts, and also increases the risk 
for anxiety or depressive disorders in adulthood3,4,5. However, anxiety disorders are 
often untreated  in children and adolescents6.  
There is increasing evidence to suggest that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs) are effective
 treatments for you th with GAD and are generally well tolerated7. 
Escitalopram, the S -enantiomer of racemic ci talopram, is an SSRI  primarily responsible 
for the serotonin reuptake inhibition produced by citalopram. Escitalopram binds preferentially to the serotonin transporter and has very low or no affinity for neurotransmitter receptors or for the dopamine and norepinephrine transporters. T he 
mechanism of antidepressant action of escitalopram  is presumed to be linked to 
potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from its inhibition of central nervous system  neuronal reuptake of serotonin 
(5-hydroxytryptamine).  
Five clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of escitalopram in adult patients 
with GAD have been completed
. Three of the 5 studies were placebo -controlled; one 
was an open -label extension study; and one was a relapse-prevention study. The 
efficacy of escitalopram in the acute treatment of GAD was demonstrated in the three, 8-week, flexible -dose, placebo- controlled studies. In all 3 studies, escitalopram  showed 
statistically significant greater mean improvement compared to placebo on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale. Results from the relapse-prevention study showed that treatment with 
escitalopram at 20  mg/day significantly reduced the risk of relapse of GAD. 
The most commonly observed adverse reactions in the placebo- controlled double -blind 
studies
 in adult escitalopram patients (incidence of approximately 5% or greater and 
approximate ly twice the incidence in placebo patients) were nausea, ejaculation disorder 
(primarily ejaculatory delay), insomnia, fatigue, decreased libido, and anorgasmia. 
Escitalopram has not been evaluated in pediatric p atients in clinical studies in GAD. In 
pediatric patients (aged 6 through 17 years) in studies in major depressive disorder 
(MDD), the overall profile of adverse reactions was generally similar to that seen in adult studies. However, the following adverse reactions were reported at an incidence of at least 2% for escitalopram and greater than placebo: back pain, urinary tract infection, vomiting, and nasal congestion.

CONFIDENTIAL  The single- and multiple -dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of escitalopram are linear and 
dose- proportional in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/da y. The mean terminal half -life is 
about 27 to 32 hours. Following a single oral dose (20 mg tablet or solution) of 
escitalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 5 hours. With once-daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. Escitalopram is metabolized to S -demethylcitalopram and  S-didemethylcitalopram. At steady state, 
the concentration of S- demethylcitalopram in plasma is approximately one -third that of 
escitalopram. The level of S-didemethylcitalopram was not detectable in most subjects
8. 
In a single-dose study of 10 mg escitalopram, the area under the plasma concentration -time cur 
ve (AUC) of escitalopram decreased by 19%, and the maximum 
plasma concentration (Cmax) increased by 26% in health y adolescent subjects (12 to 
17 years of age) compared to adults8. Following multiple dosing of 40 mg/day 
citalopram, steady state Cmax and AUC were similar  in adolescent patients with MDD 
(12 to 17 years of age) compared to adult patients8.  
Escitalopram is approved in the United States (under the trade name Lexapro®) for the 
acute and maintenance treatment of MDD in adults (aged 18 through 65 years) and 
adolescents (aged 12 through 17 years) and the acute treatment of GAD in adults at once-daily doses of 10 to 20 mg. Outside the United States,  escitalopram is approved for 
the treatment of MDD, GAD, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and social 
anxiety disorder  under the trade names Cipralex
® and Esertia® at a dosage of 5 to 
20 mg/day.  
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required a Post- Marketing 
Require
ment (PMR) study in the pediatric population for the treatment of GAD under 
the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA).  
The current study is designed to evaluate the safety , efficacy , and PK  of (10 to 
20 mg/day) escitalopram in pediatric subjects (aged 7 through 17 years) for the 
treatment of GAD.  
For further details of n onclinical and clini cal studies, PK , and toxicology, please see the 
package insert  for escitalopram8.

CONFIDENTIAL  8 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
8.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description  
This is a random
ized, multicenter, double-blind, flexibly-dosed, placebo-controlled 
parallel gr
oup study of escitalopram  in the treatment of children (aged 7 through 
11 years ) and adolescent s (aged 12 through 17 years ) with GAD. 
The study design incorporates an up to 3- week screening p eriod, an 8- week  double-
blind, acute treatment period, and a 1-week double -blind down taper period. 
Approximately 430 subjects will be screened and a total of appro ximately 256 subjects 
are planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either escitalopram or placebo. The 
randomization schedule will be stratified by age at randomization (grouped as 7-11 years vs. 12–17 years) and sex, and blocked. 
Subjects will begin with a 10 mg/day dose of escitalopram (taken oral ly) or mat
 ching 
placebo for the first 2 we eks of double- blind treatment. At the end of Week 2, subjects 
who can tolerate the current dose of 10 mg/day may have a dose escalation  to 
20 mg/day  of escitalopram or matching placebo. Dose escalation will be at the 
investigator’s discretion taking into account the Clinical Global Impression of Severity 
(CGI -S) score. Subjects who remain on the 10 mg/day dose of escitalopram or matching 
placebo will be evaluated again at Week 4 for a possible dose escalation to 20 mg/day at the investigator’s discretion . Dose escalations cannot be made at any other time during 
the study. The dose may be decreased from 20 mg/day to 10 mg/day following discussion with the medical director  if the subject does not tolerate the 20 mg/day dose. 
At the end of the treatment period or at early withdrawal, subjects will enter a 1-week 
double-blind down taper period with a follow-up telephone contact 1 week after the end 
of the double-blind down taper period. 
A blinded interim analysis will be conducted when 75% of randomized subjects have 
either comple t
ed or discontinued the study in order to check the assumptions in the 
sample size calculation. Based on this, the sa mple size may be increased to ensure an 
adequate power. However, due to the difficulties in recruiting pediatric subjects with GAD, the number of subjects in each treatment arm will be capped at 160.  
The study design is shown in Figure 1. 
The coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID -19) pandemi
 c (and any other naming 
conventions used) developed after this study began and this protocol has been amended to account for study procedures that need to be modified in association with adhering to local safety guidelines or regulations.  
During the COVID -19 pandemic, r
 emote study visits, in which data are collected via 
telephone or videoconference, are possible but not preferred. Nearly all scheduled safety 
assessments, with exceptio n of the Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale  (C-SSRS), 
are not possible by remote visit and must be collected in person via clinic visits. To

CONFIDENTIAL  8.2 Discussion of Study Design  
8.2.1 Study Design  
This study will be perf
ormed in pediatric subject s (aged 7 through 17 years) wit h GAD 
in order to assess safety and efficacy in this patient population. 
In order to standardize the subject population and to make it as homogeneous as 
possible, all subjects mu
st meet the DSM -5 criteria for diagnosis of GAD  and hav e at 
least moderate severity of GAD assessed using standard rati ng scales . In addition, t he 
randomization schedule will be stratified so that there is treatment balance within the 
age group and sex group strata. 
There is a known placebo effect in t his indication9 so this study will use  a parallel -group 
design  with a placebo -control arm . As some of the endpoints (eg, saf ety, clinical 
assessments) are potentially subjective, this study will be performed in a double-blind 
manner.  
Subjects randomized to the escitalopram treatment arm will rece ive escitalopram at an 
initia
l dose of 10 mg/day with the possibility to increase the dose to 20 mg /day after 
2 weeks  and 4 weeks. The dose can only be increased if the subject  tolerates the current 
dose. Further details on the selection of doses in this study are provided in Section  8.4.5. 
A double- blind treatment p eriod of 8 weeks was selected because it is expected to see a 
treatment effect within this period and the efficacy of escitalopram in the treatment of 
GAD beyond 8 weeks has not been systematically studied. T he study includes a 1-week 
double-blind down taper period at the End of T reatment to minimize symptoms 
associated  with discontinuation of escitalopram . 
Analyses of short- term placebo -controlled t rials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and 
others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal ideation  and behavior 
(suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (aged 18 through 24  years ) with 
MDD and other psychiatric disorders. In order to monitor this, the C- SSRS will be 
completed at the Screening, Baseline, and each study visit (see Section  10.1.2.1 for 
further details) . 
8.2.2 Quality M
anagement and Risk Evaluation 
This protocol was 
evaluated to identify risks to those processes and data that are critical 
to assure human subje
ct protection and reliability of study results. To mitigate these 
risks, on- site and remot e risk -based monitoring standard operating procedures will be 
employed to ensure site compliance with International Council for Harmonisation of 
Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) current Good 
Clinical Practice  (cGCP ). Concurrent medical review by the contract research 
organization represents an integral component of the study’s centralized monitoring

processes will be implemented: 
• Exclusion of subjec ts whose anxiety is sig nificantly impacted by COVID-19 as 
assessed by investigator (see Section  8.3.3).  
• Global COVID -19 impact assessment (see Section  10.1.1.4).  
• Visit conduct options allowing remote visits as outlined below: 
During remote study v
isits data are collected via telephone or videoconference 
(see Appendix 17.3).  
Any clinic
al assessment (including physical examinatio n, vital signs, urine, or 
blood test
s) necessary as part of evaluation of a reported adverse event (AE) must 
be performed immediately. If the study site is closed or the subject is unable to travel to the study site, alternate arrangements for in -person cl inical assessment 
should be secured. 
Option 1: In -Clinic Visits  
This is the preferred option. All study visits are performed as in -clinic visits with all 
assessments outlined in the Schedule of Assessments in Section 8.1.2.  
Option 2: Remote Visits (except Screening  for all subjects and Baseline Visit for female 
subjects of childbearing potential )  
This option is only to be used if local guidance and regulations are preventing the site or subject from completing  an in-clinic  visit. Screening must take place as an in -clinic visit 
with all assessments outlined in the Schedule of Assessments in Section 8.1.2. The 
Baseline Visit must t 
ake place as an in -clinic visit for all female subjects of childbearing 
potential with all assessments outlined in the Schedule of Assessments in Section 8.1.2 
(including pregnancy test
). All other visits can be completed remotely with the 
assessmen ts outlined in Section  8.1.3.

8.3 Selection of Study Population 
8.3.1 Number of Planned Subj
ects  
A total of appro
ximately 430 subjects will be screen ed and approximately 256 subjects 
(128 per treatment arm) are planned to be randomized in approximately 40 centers in 
the U nited States. It is assumed that approximately 115 subjects per treatment arm will 
be evaluable (ie, have at least one postbaseline assessment).  
A blinded interim analysis will be conducted when 75% of randomized subjects have 
either complete d or disconti
nued the study in order to check the assumptions in the 
sample size calculation. Based on this, the sample size may be increased to ensure an adequate power  due to variance assumption deviation as well as increased variance due 
to COVID -19 rem ote visits . However, due to the difficulties in recruiting pediatric

completed the study.  
Subjects who withdraw early from the study should complete the End of Treatment 
Visit an d enter the 1-week dow

Subjects should be monitored for the following symptoms when discontinuing 
treatment : dysphoric
 mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (eg, 
paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, and hypomania. A gradual reduction in dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended, whenever possible.  
Reasonable efforts will be made to contact subjects who are lost to follow-up (eg, 
3 attempts to contact th
e subject by telephone/letter) . These efforts must be documented 
in the subject’s file .  
The sponsor has the right to terminate the study at any time in case of serious adverse events ( SAEs ) or if 
special circumstances concerning the investigational product or the 
company itself occur, making further treatment of subjects impossible . In this event, the 
investigator(s) will be informed of the reason for study termination.  
Pregnancy  
Subjects will be instructed that known or suspected pregnancy occurring during the study, in subjects
 or female partners o f male subjects, should be confirmed and reported 
to the investigator, who will then withdraw the subject from the study after appropriate 
safety follow -up. The investigator should discus s down tapering with the medical 
director for any subject being withdrawn as a result of pregnancy.  
The investigator should also be notified of pregnancy occurring during the study but confirmed after c
ompletion of the study. In the event that a subject is subsequently 
found to be pregnant after inclusion in the study, any pregnancy will be immediately reported to the sponsor by the investigator. All pregnancies will be followed to term by the investigator, and pregnancy outcome, as well as the health status of mother and child will be reported to the sponsor.  
Full details will be recorded on the withdrawal page of the eCRF, and a pregnancy form 
will be completed  (see S

CONFIDENTIAL  investigator’s discretion taking into account the CGI -S score. Subjects who remain on 
10 mg/day will be evaluated again at Week 4 for a  possible dose escalation to 
20 mg/day at the investigator’s discretion . Dose escalat ions cannot be made at any other 
time during the study. The dose may be decreased from 20 mg/day to 10 mg/day 
following discussion with the medical director  if the subject does not tolerate the 
20 mg/day dose.  
At the end of the 8- week double -blind acute t reatment period, or at  withdrawal, the 
subject will enter a 1-week double-blind down taper period.  
For subjects receiving escitalopram 10  mg/day, the doses  given during the double-blind 
down taper period will be as follows:  
• Week 9: Subjects will receive placebo . 
For subjects 
receiving escitalopram 20  mg/day, the doses  given during the double-blind 
down taper period will be as follows:  
• Week 9: Subjects will receive 10 mg/da y. 
Subject s randomize

double- blind treatment period . Subjects will be evaluated at the end of Week  2 and 
Week  4 and subjects tolerating 10 mg/day matching placebo may be indicated for dose 
escalation by the investigator but in a blinded fashion will continue to receive matching 
placebo . Subjects receiving placebo will follow a similar down tapering schedule at the 
end of the double-blind treatment period. 
For details on overdose of escitalopram , please see Sectio n 10.1.2.2.5. 
8.4.2 Identity of Investigational Products 
Escitalopram (S -(+)-
1-[3-dimethyl-aminopr opyl]-1- (p-fluorophenyl)-5-
phthalancarbonit rile oxalate) is the S -enantiomer of racemic citalopram.  
Encapsulated escitalopram 10  mg tablets will be pro vided for both the 10 mg and 20 mg  
doses. The active study medication will be provided in single- dose capsules that  are 
identical in appearance, and contain one 10 mg tablet for the 10 mg dose, or two  10 mg 
tablets for the 20 mg dose. Escitalopram  tablets are film-coated, round tablets 
containing escitalopram oxalate in strengths equivalent to 10 mg escitalopram base.   
Matching placebo capsules are sim ilar but do not contain active escitalopram.  
Investigational products should be stored at 25 °C (77 °F); excursions to 15 °C to 30 °C 
(59 °F to 86 °F) are permi
tted.

CONFIDENTIAL  8.4.3 Packaging and Labeling 
The investigational product will be provided in 10 count bottles.  
All packaging and labeling operations will be performed according to Good 
Manufacturing 
Practice for Medicinal Products and the relevant regul atory 
requirements.  
8.4.4 Method of  Assigning S u bjects to Treatment Groups  
After successfully meeting study entry criteria, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 
ratio to escitalo
pram or placebo. The r andomization schedule will be stratified by age at 
randomization (grouped as 7–11 years vs. 12–17 years) and sex, and blocked . 
Approximately 430 subjects will be screened and a total of approximately 256 subjects 
are planned for randomization.  
An Interactive Response System (IXRS) will be used to manage the randomization, 
assignment of tr
eatment during the study, and if necessary emergency unblinding of 
subjects during the study conduct. The IXRS will assign a randomization number, distinct from the subject number, at the time of randomization.  
8.4.5 Selection of Doses in  the Study  
In
 this study in GAD, the initial dose will be 10  mg/day with a poss ible increase to 
20 mg/day after a minimum of 2  weeks for both pediatric subjects (aged 7 through 
11 years) and adolescents (aged 12 through 17 years). Clinical assessment at th e Week 2 
Visit may provide information for the investigator to increase the dose at that time. There is no standard of care for when doses should be adjusted. As there is no Week 3 Visit, allowing an evaluation for dose escalation at the Week 2 Visit is an  ideal option. 
8.4.6 Selection and Timing of D ose for Each Sub
 ject 
Subjects will be randomly allocated to receive escitalopram  or pla cebo. 
For in -clinic visits according to Option 1 in Section  8.2.2.1: 
Subjects 
will re ceive their fir st dose of study drug on site on Day 1. Subjects will then 
self-administer the investigational product on an outpatient basis once a day. Subjects 
should be instructed to administer investigational product at approximately the same time each  day including on days when clinic visits occur. Subjects may take the 
investigational product with or without food. To allow for PK sampling during in- clinic 
visits , subjects receiving  study drug in the morning will be instructed to withhold taking 
the mo rning dose on the day of the Week 4 Visit (Visit 5) and to bring their study drug 
to the visit. Subjects receiving study drug in the evening should take their dose in the 
evening before the visit.

CONFIDENTIAL  For remote visits according to Option 2 in Section  8.2.2.1:  
Subjects will receive and take their first dose of study drug on Day 1 via curbside 
(preferred) or th
ey will receive it by courier and take it at home. Subjects will then self -
administer the investigational pro duct on an outpatient basis once a day. Subjects should 
be instructed to administer investigational product at approximately the same time each day including on days when remote visits are scheduled. Subjects may take the investigational product with or without food. 
Details of dose escalation and down tapering are provided in Section 8.4.1. 
8.4.7 Blinding  
The 
escitalopram  and place
bo capsules  are t he same in appearance. The investigators , 
study center staff,  subjects , study contract research organization staff , and study sponsor 
staff will be blinded to the treatment assignments. The only planned unblinding will be 
at the conclusion of the study, when the database has been cleaned, statistical 
populations have been defined, and approval for database lock has been given by Allergan.  
The blind for a specific subject can be broken by the investigator (emergency code 
breaking) only if the inve
stigator considers the information indispensable to the safety 
of the subject. Any subject whose treatment is unblinded by the investigator will be withdrawn at the moment of unblinding, with the reason for unblinding given as the reason for discontinuation from the study.  
Bioanalytical representatives will be unblinded for PK sample bioanalysis during the 
conduct of the study. The unblindi
ng of bioanalytical representatives will be carried out 
in a secure manner following the sponsor’s standard operating procedures. Extreme care and diligence will be taken to ensure no other individua ls outside the bioanalytical team 
will be unblinded.

10.1.1 Efficacy  Assessments  
The efficacy assessments will be completed by the investigator o
r appropriately 
qualified s
tudy center  staff. Every effort should be made to ensure that each instrument 
is completed by  the same assessor at each visit .  
10.1.1.1 Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale 
The PARS is a clinician -rated instrument for assessing the severity of 
anxiety symptoms 
associa
ted with common anxiety disorders including GAD in children10,11.  
The PARS severity score for GAD will be assessed  for all symptoms identified in the 
generalized anxiety section of 
the PARS symptom checklist  and the scor es recorded on 
the eCRF .  
10.1.1.2 Clinical Global Impression of Severity  
The CGI -S was developed for use in clinical trials to provide an assessment 
of the 
clinician's view of the patient's global functioning prior to and after in
itiating a study 
medication12,13. 
The CGI -S will be completed using a 7-poi nt scale  and the scores recorded on the 
eCRF.  
10.1.1.3 Children’s Global Assessment Scal
e 
The CGAS can be used as a measure of globa
l functioning and impairment14. 
The CGAS will be completed by the clinician using a 100- point scale r anging from 1 to 
100, with higher scores indicating better functioning. T h
e scores will be recorded on the 
eCRF .  
10.1.1.4 Global COVID -19 Impact Assessment  
A global COVID -19 impact assessment  will be used to evalua
te the impact  of the 
coronavirus disease pande
mic on the severity of the subject’s G AD during the last 
1 week. The rating will include scores from 0 (not applicable, subject not enrolled in the 
trial during the pandemic) to 7 (extreme impact). Raters will also evaluate whether the 
impact was an improvement or worsening of the subject’s GA D. The global COVID -19 
impact assessment  will be completed last after all study assessments by appropriately 
qualified study center staff and the scores recorded on the eCRF. Every effort should be made to ensure that the assessments are completed by the same assessor at each visit.

CONFIDENTIAL  10.1.2 Safety Assessments 
10.1.2.1 Columbia -Suicide Severit y Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS is an instrument designed to systematically assess and track suicidal 
ideation and behavi
or15. The strength of thi s suicide classification system is in its ability 
to comprehensively identify suicidal events while limiting the over -identification of 
suicidal behavior. 
The C -SSRS will be completed by the investigator  or appropriatel y qualified study 
center  staff and th e scor es recorded on the e CRF . Every effort should be made to ensure 
that the assessments are completed by the same assessor at each visit.  
Any positive score should be reported to the medical director  and immediate sub ject 
care should be implemented and documented. Any positive score should be recorded as 
an AE or SAE , as appropriate.  
In addition to the planned assessments, the investigator must continually evaluate 
suicidality r
isk throughout the subject’s participation in the study.  
10.1.2.2 Adverse Events  
Adve rse Event D e
finition  
An A
E is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject 
administered a
 medicinal product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not it is related to the 
medicinal (investigational) product. This includes an exacerbation of pre -existing 
conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, drug interaction or the significant worsening of the indication under investigation that is not recorded elsewhere in the eCRF under specific efficacy assessments . Anticipated fluctuations of pre-existing conditions, 
including the disease under study that do not represent a clinically significant exacerbation or worsening need not be considered AEs. 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur during the 
study. AEs w ill 
be elicited by asking the subject a nonleading question, for example, 
“Have you experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked/since your last visit?” . AEs should be reported on t he appropriate page of the eCRF.

CONFIDENTIAL  Assessment of Severity  
Each AE will be assigned a category by the investigator as follows: 
Mild : An AE that is easily tolerated by the subject, causes minimal discomfort 
and does not interfere with everyday activities.  
Moderate : An AE that is sufficiently discomforting to interfer e with normal 
everyday activities; intervention may be needed.  
Severe : An AE that prevents normal everyday activities; treatment or other 
intervention usually needed.  
If there is a change in severity of an AE, it must be recorded as a separate event.  
Assessment of C ausality 
Eve
ry effort will be made by the investigator to assess the relationship of the AE, if any, 
to the study dru
g. Causality should be assessed using the categories presented in the 
following table:  
Unrelated : Clinical event with an incomp atible time relationship to study drug  
administration, and that could be explained by underlying disease or 
other drugs or chemicals or is incontrovertibly not related to the study 
drug. 
Unlikely : Clinical event whose time relationship to study drug  admin istration 
makes a causal connection improbable, but that could plausibly be 
explained by underlying disease or other drugs or chemicals.  
Possible : Clinical event with a reasonable time relationship to study drug  
administration, but that could also be expl ained by concurrent disease 
or other drugs or chemicals.  
Probable : Clinical event with a reasonable time relationship to study drug  
administration, and is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease 
or other drugs or chemicals.  
Very 
Likely/Certain : Clinical event with plausible time relationship to study drug  
administration, and that cannot be explained by concurrent disease or 
other drugs or chemicals.  
Action Taken  
The investigator will describe the action taken in the appropriate section of the e CRF, as

 of study drug will be collected according to the procedures 
outlined above at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Section  8.1.2/ 8.1.3), and as observed or reported spontaneously by study participants. 
AEs should be reported and documented in accordance with the procedures outlined 
below. All AEs occu

or disabling if it results in a substantial and/or permanent disruption of the subject’s ability to c arry out normal life functions). 
• Resu lts in a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
In addition, medi
cal and scientific judgement is required to decide if prompt notification 
is required in situat
ions other than those defined for SAEs above. This may include any 
event that the investigator regards as serious that did not strictly meet the criteria above but may have jeopardize d the subject or required intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above, or that would suggest any significant hazard, contraindication, side effect , or precaution that may be associated with the use of the investigational 
product. 
Reporting of S erious Adverse Events 
An
y SAE s from the signing of the ICF until 30 days after receiving the last dose of 
study drug will be
 collected according to the procedures outlined above at the 
timepoints specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Section  8.1.2/ 8.1.3), and as 
observed or reported spont
aneously by study participants, whether or not the SAE is 
considered to be related to the investigational product.  
The sponsor is required to inform worldwide regulatory authorities of SAEs that meet 
specific criter
ia. Therefore, the sponsor must be notified immediately regarding any 
SAE that occurs after informed consent is obtained. 
Within 24 hours of learning of any AE that meets one of the criteria for an SAE, the 
study center personne
l must report the event to Global Drug Safety on the SAE Form 
for Clinical Trials. The medical director may also be notified by telephone, however, 
notification of the medical director by tele phone does not substitute for reporting of the 
event to the sponsor by email/fax of the SAE form for Clinical Trials within the 
required time period. 
If, during follow-up, any nonserious AE worsens and eventually meets the criteria for 
an SAE, that AE should be r
ecorded as a new SAE. 
The study center must transmit the SAE Form for Clinical Trials to the SAE email address or fax numbe 
r shown below. Even if an initial report is made by telephone, the 
SAE Form for Clinical Trials completed with all available details must still be faxed or 
emailed within 24 hours of knowledge of the event at the study center.

CONFIDENTIAL  All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be the subject of 
expedited reporting. The sponsor shall ensure that all relevant information about a SUSAR that is fatal or life -threatening is reported to the relevan t competent authorities 
and institutional review board ( IRB) within 7 days after knowledge by the sponsor of 
such a case and that relevant follow -up information is communicated within an  
additional 8 days. All other SUSARs will be reported to the relevan t competent 
authorities and IRB within 15 days after knowledge by the sponsor of such a case. All 
investigators should follow up SUSARs until the event is resolved or until, in the opinion of the investigator, the event is stabil ized or determined to be chronic. Post 
study SUSARs that occur after the subject has completed the clinical study must be reported by the investigator to the sponsor. 
10.1.2.2.4 Warnings and P r
 ecautions  
Clinical Worsening/Suicide Risk: s ubjects should be m onitored for clinical worsening, 
suicidality and unusual change in behavior, especially at the start of therapy or at times 
of dose changes . (See Section 10.1.2.1 for use of the C- SSRS).  
Serotonin Sy
ndrome: serotonin syndrome has been reported with SS RIs, including 
esci
talopram , when taken alone, but especially when co -administered with other 
serotonergic agents (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John’s Wort). Serotonin 
syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (eg, agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (eg, tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, and hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (eg, tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, and incoordination) seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea). If symptoms of 
serotonin syndrome occur, es citalopram should be discontinued and supportive 
treatment initiated.  
Hyponatremia: hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs, including escitalopram . Subj
ects taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at 
greater risk. D iscontinuation of escitalopram should be considered in subjects with 
symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted. 
Caution should be used when escitalopram is taken in combination with other centrally 
acting drugs
. 
Full details of the Warnings and Precautions associated with escitalopram are available 
in the prescr
ibing information. 
10.1.2.2.5 Overdose

CONFIDENTIAL  insomnia, nausea, vomiting, sinus tachycardia, somnolence, and ECG changes 
(including QT prolongation and very rare cases of torsade de pointes). Acute renal failure has been very rarely reported accompanying overdose. 
In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple-drug involvement. The 
physician should consider conta
cting a poison control center for additional information 
on the treatment of any overdose. 
10.1.2.2.6 Potential Hy’s Law Cases 
Criteria for potential Hy’
s law cases are as follows:  
• Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥ 3 × upper 
limit of normal (ULN) AND  
• Tot
al bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN AND 
• Alkaline phosphatase 
< 2 × ULN  
Study site personnel 
must report every subject who meets these cr iteria. Typically, all 
3 an
alytes will be obtained from the same sample, but they may come from multiple 
samples taken within a 24 -hour period. This requirement applies from the time the 
subject signs the ICF for the study until 30 days after receiving the  last dose of study 
drug. 
A laboratory alert for potential Hy’s laws cases will be in place, and the laboratory must 
notify investigators and the
 sponsor immediately when the above criteria have been met. 
A potential Hy’s law case must be reported to the s ponsor on an SAE form as soon as 
possible (within 24 hours of learning of the potential Hy’s law case) to the SAE/pregnancy fax number, even if no AE has occurred. The eCRF for potential Hy’s law cases must be completed within 7 calendar days. Every effort  to determine the 
cause of the liver enzyme abnormalities must be made, and close monitoring should be initiated in conjunction with the Study Medical Monitor and in accordance with the FDA Guidance for Industry, Drug-Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Cli nical 
Evaluation, July 2009. The patient should return to the study site and be evaluated as soon as possible, preferably within 48 hours from the time the investigator becomes aware of the abnormal results. This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history, and physical examination . 
10.1.2.3 Clinical Laboratory Evaluation 
The hem atology , clinical che mis
try, urinal ysis, and other laboratory variables analyses 
(see Section  10.1.2.3.1) will be performed at a central laboratory. Ref erence ranges will 
be used by the investigator to assess the laboratory data for clinical significance and pathological changes. The following laboratory safety tests will be performed at the

11.4.1.2 Prior and Concomitant Medicati on 
Prior m
edication is defined as any recorded medication taken before the date of the first 
dose of double-blind i
nvestigational product. Concomitant medication is defined as any 
recorded medication used  on or after the date of the first dose of double-blind 
investigational product. A medication may be classified as both a prior medication and 
concomitant medication.  
Prior and concomitant medications,  used for treat ment of GAD and for other 
indications, will be summarized by the number and proportion of subjects in each treatment group receiving each medication within each therapeutic class for the Safety Population. Multiple medication use by a subject will only be counted once. Any recorded medications started after last dose of double- blind investigational product will 
not be summarized but will be included in listings.  
11.4.2 Measurement of Treatment Compliance  
Dosing compli
ance for a specified period will be defined as the total number of capsules  
actually taken 
by a subject during that period divided by the number of capsules  
prescribed to be taken for the same period multiplied by 100. This information will be obtained from the investigational product record of the subject ’s eCRF . 
The total number of capsules  actually taken
  during a specific time period is calculated 
based on the study medication record. The number of capsules  prescribed to be taken 
for a specific treatment period will be calculated by multiplying the number of days in that period by the number of capsules  to be taken per day. 
Descriptive stat istics for inv
 estigational product compliance will be presented by 
treatment group for each period between 2 consecutive visits, as well as for the entire double-blind treatment period, the period from first dose to the Week 8 End of Treatment or Early Withdrawal Visit, and the down  taper period.

The efficacy 
analyses will be based on the mITT Populat ion. Baseline for efficacy is 
defined as the last non- missing efficacy assessment recorded at or before the date of the 
first double-blind dosing. All statistical tests will be 2 -sided hypothesis tests performed 
at the 5% level of significance. For efficacy analyses in which study center is a factor, a small center will be defined as a center with less than 2 subjects  in at least 1 treatment 
group in the m ITT Population. A pooling algorithm for the pooling of small centers will 
be specified in the statistical analysis plan ( SAP). By-visit analysis based on the

CONFIDENTIAL  mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) using the observed case approach 
will be performed for all continuous efficacy parameters. 
11.5.1.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary e
fficacy endpoint is the change from B aseline to Week 8  in the PARS 
severity score.  
The PARS severity score for GAD is assessed for all symptoms identified in the 
generalized anxi
ety section of the PARS symptom checklist. The PARS severity score 
for GAD will be derived by summing 5 of 7 severity/impairment/interference items (2, 3, 5, 6, and 7). 
The primary analysis will be performed using an MMRM with treatment gro up, age 
group strat
a (7-11 vs. 12-17 years), sex, study center, visit, and treatment group- by-visit 
interaction as the fixed effects and the baseline value and baseline value -by-visit 
interaction as the covariates. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the covariance of within -subject scores. The Kenward -Roger approximation
16 will be 
used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom for the unstructured covariance matrix. If the model convergence for the unstructured covariance matrix fails, then the 
Fisher scoring algorithm will be used to provide better initial values of the covariance parameters . In the event that the model still does not converge after using those initial 
values, simplified covariance structures will be used to fit the model in the following order until the model converges: (1) ante-dependence, (2) heterogeneous autoregressive, (3) Toeplitz, and (4) compound symmetry. If a structured covariance is used, then a robust sandwich es timator will be used for estimating the variance of  the treatment 
effect estimate.  
The MMRM analysis will be performed based on all post-baseline scores using only the observed cases w
ithout imputation of missing values.  
The significance test for the diffe rence in means at  Week 8 will be based on least 
squares (LS) means using a 2-sided α of 0.05. Differences between treatments at the other post- baseline visits will also be estimated based on LS means.  
Sensitivit y analyses will be conducted on the primary efficacy endpoint to assess the 
missing at r
andom assumption of the MMRM model and the impact of COVID -19 
using remote home assessment s. Details will be provided in the SAP.

CONFIDENTIAL  11.5.1.1.1 Estimand for the Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The following describes the estimand approach for the primary eff icacy analysis 
desc
ribed in ICH E9 (R1) (2017)17.  
Target Population  
As noted above in Section  11.5, the target population is the mITT population. 
Variable 
The variable is the same as the definition of the primary efficacy analysis described in 
Section  11.5.1.1. 
Accountin
g for Intercurrent Events  
The primary analysis will treat measurements after study withdrawal as missing in the MMRM modeling, lea
ding to an estimate of t he treatment effect while on treatment. 
The impact of the missing at random assumption of MMRM will be assessed using 2 different approaches. The first will be a simple last observation carr ied forward 
(LOCF) approach. The second will be a sensitivity analysis using a pattern -mixture 
model. The details of this sensitivity analyses will be provided in detail in the SAP.  
Population- level Summary  
The popula
tion- level summary for  the primary endpoint is the difference in primary 
variable means between the escitalopram group and placebo, while remaining on the 
study treatment.  
11.5.1.2 Secondary Efficacy Parameters  
Inferential t
esting for the secondary endpoints will be reported with nominal p-values. 
No a djustments for mu
ltiplicity will be made. All confidence intervals will be 2 -sided 
95% confidence intervals, unless stated otherwise. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: 
• Response rate on the PARS at acute treatment endpoint (Week 8)  
o Response is defi
ned as a 50%  improvement on the PARS severity score 
for GAD.  
• Remission rate on the PARS at acute treatment endpoint (Week 8)  
o Remission is defined as PARS severity score for GAD <8 (using 6 PARS 
items: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) 
• Change on the CGI- S from baseline to acute treatment endpoint (Week 8)

 Remission rate on the CGAS at acute treatment endpoint ( Week 8). 
Funct
ional remission is defined as CGAS >70. 
• COVID -19 impact as sessment score at each visit . 
The response rate of the PARS will be analy zed using a repe ated measures model for  
categorical outcomes. Modeling will be completed  using a categorical MMRM 
(MMRM-CAT) approach, in which a pseudo-likelihood- based repeated measures 
analysis will be used and implemented in SAS procedure GLIMMIX. A binary 
distribution with logit link will be used for the dependent variable. Classification 
variables for treatment, age group, sex, visit (as a categorical variable), 
treatment -by-age group interaction, treatment- by-sex interaction, treatment -by-visit 
interaction, and treatment -by-age group -by-sex interaction, and baseline score as a 
covariate will be considered in the modeling. 
11.5.1.2.1 Analysis o f Remission in PARS

parameters will include AEs, clinical laboratory parameters, vital sign measurements, and ECG parameters. For each safety parameter, the last assessment made before the first dose of double-blind investigational product will be used as the baseline for all analyses of that safety parameter.  
Safety data collected outside of planned visit windows but within allowance limits (up to 1 week late f
or Visits  7 and 8) will be  included in the summary tables. Safety data 
collected outside of planned visit windows and outside of the allowance limits (>1  week 
to 6 weeks late for Visits  7 and 8) will be listed, but will not be in cluded in the summary 
tables. Subgroup analyses may be performed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the safety analyses.  
The safety endpoints during the double-blind treatment period are as follows: 
• Incidence of treatment -emergent adve
 rse events  (TEAEs) . 
• Observed values and change from baseline in vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, tempera 
ture, respiration  rate, height, weight, BMI, height percentile, weight 
percentile, and BMI percentile) ; incidence of vital sign potentially clinically 
significant ( PCS) values.  
• Observed values and changes from baseline in ECG  intervals a nd interpretation; 
incidence of ECG PCS values.  
• Observed values and changes from baseline in clinical laboratory assessments (hematology, 
chemistry, and urinalysis); incidence of clinical laboratory PCS 
values.  
• Incidence of suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behavior as determined by the 
C-SSRS.  
 
11.6.1.1 Adverse E
vents  
AEs will be c
oded to an SOC and PT using the latest available version of MedDRA. An 
AE (classified
 by PT) not present before t he date of the first dose of  the double-blind 
treatment period or during the double-blind down taper period or that was present 
before the first dose but increased in severity or seriousness will be considered a TEAE. An AE that starts more than 30 days after the date of the last dose of double-blind 
investigational product will not be counted as a TEAE. 
An AE that starts  during the double-
 blind down taper period or that increases in severity 
or seriousness during the double-blind down taper period will be considered a newly 
emergent AE  (NEAE) . The NE AEs during the double-blind down taper period will be 
summarized by SOC , PT, and treatment group for all subject s who enter the 
double-blind down taper period.

CONFIDENTIAL  The number and percentage of subject s reporting TEA Es in each treatment group will 
be tabulated by SOC  and PT; by SOC , PT, and severity; and by SOC , PT, and causal 
relationship to  the investigational product. If more than one AE is coded to the same PT  
for the same subject, the subject  will be counted only once for that PT  using the most 
severe and most related occurrence for the summarization by severity and by causal 
relationship to the investigational product, respectively. 
The distribution of TEAEs by severity and causal relationship to the investigational 
product will be s
ummarized by treatment group. The incidence of common (≥ 2% of 
subject s in any treatment group) TEAEs during the double- blind treatment period will 
be summarized by PT and treatment group.  
An SAE that occurred between the date of the first dose of double- blind investiga tional 
product and 30 days after the date of the last dose of double- blind investigational 
product in the study, inclusive, will be considered an on- therapy SAE. The incidence of 
SAEs and AEs leading to premature discont inuation of the study will also be 
summarized by study period (separately for double-blind treatment period and double-blind down taper  period), SOC , PT, and treatment group. Listings will be presented for 
subjects with SAEs, subjects with AEs leading to p remature discontinuation, and 
subjects who died. All subjects with SAEs, including those reported during the screening period or more than 30 days after the date of the last dose of the double-blind investigational product, and subjects discontinuing due to AEs before the start of double- blind investigational product will be included in these listings . 
Each AE summary described above will be presented as all AEs, AEs that are 
associated wi t
h the COVID -19 pandemic (as determined by the investigator) , and AEs 
that are not associated with the COVID -19 pandemic . AEs associated with the 
COVID -19 pandemic will be listed separately.  
11.6.1.2 Vital Signs  
Descriptive
 statistics for vital signs (ie, blood pressure, pulse rate, temperature, 
respiration
 rate, height, weight, BM I, height percentile, weight percentile, and BMI 
percentile) and changes from baseline values at each visit and at end of study will be presented by treatment group. H eight , weight , and BMI z- scores will be calculated 
based on CDC growth charts. 
Vital sign  values will be
  PCS if they meet both the observed- value criteria and the 
change from baseline -value criteria. The criteria for PCS vital sign values will be 
detailed in the SAP. The percentages will be calculated relative to the number of 
subjects  with ba seline values and at least one postbaseline assessment. The numerator 
will be the total number of subjects  with available baseline values and at least one PCS 
postbaseline value. A supportive listing of subjects  with PCS postbaseline values will be 
provided, including the subject identification (SID)  number, study center number, and

 statistics for ECG paramete rs (ie, ventr icular heart rate, RR interval, PR 
interval, QRS interval, QT interval, and QTc interval) and changes from baseline values 
at each assessment time point will be presented by treatment group. The QTc interval is calculated using both the Bazett  (QTcB = QT/(RR)½) and Fridericia (QTcF = 
QT/(RR)⅓) corrections. The number and percentage of subjects  with PCS postbaseline 
ECG values will be tabulated by treatment group. The criteria for PCS ECG values will be detailed in the SAP. The percentages will be calculated relative to the number of 
subjects  with available non -PCS baseline values and at least one postbaseline 
assessment. The numerator will be the total number of subjects  with available non -PCS 
baseline values and at least one PCS postbaseline value. A supportive listing of subjects with PCS postbaseline values will be provided, including the SID  number, study center 
number, and baseline and postbaseline values. A listing of all AEs for subjects with PCS ECG values will also be provided.

CONFIDENTIAL  11.6.1.5 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
For the C-SSRS, the number and percentage of subjects  with suicidal ideation o r 
suicidal behavior as recorded on the C- SSRS scale will be presented by treatment group.  
The distribution of responses for most severe suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior 
during the lifetime history, the double-blind treatment period and the down taper period will also be presented by treatment group for the Safety Population. Supportive listings will be provided and will include the SID  number, treatment group, visit number, 
lifetime history, and postbaseline values for each patient. Intensity of ideation, suicidal behavior type, and lethality of suicidal behavior will also be included in these listings.  
11.7 Pharmacokinetic and Exposure -Response Evaluation
  
Escitalopram and S -demethylcitalopram plas ma concentrations will be listed.  
Escitalop ram concentrations wil l be analyzed using a nonlinear mixed effects approach. 
Population PK parameters, i nter-subject, and residual variability will be determined. 
The effect of covariates on the escitalopram PK will also be investigated. The exposure/dose- response relationship between efficacy parameters and plasma expo sure 
and potentially safety parameters and plasma exposure will be explored using a 
nonlinear mixed effects approach. The analysis results will be provided in a separate report.  
11.8 Interim Analyses  
A blinded interim analy
sis will be conducted when 75% of randomized subjects have 
either completed or dis
continued the study to obtain an estimate of the pooled standard 
deviation on change from baseline in the PARS score to Week 8 of the double-blind treatment period . If the estimated pooled standard deviation is larger than the assumed 
pooled standard deviation in the sample size calculation due to assumption deviation as 
well as COVID -19 remote visits  (see Section  11.9 ), sample sizes in placebo and 
escitalopram treatment g 
roups may be increased to ensure an adequate power. However, 
due to the difficulties in recruiting pediatric subjects with GAD, the number of subjects in each treatment arm will be capped at 160.  
11.9 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size estimat
e was constructed using a simulation approach as described in 
Lu K. (2012)18.  
The primary efficacy parameter will be the change from baseline to Week 8 of the double- blind treatment period 
 in PARS total score. To detect an effect size (treatment 
group difference of 2.30 units relative to pooled standard deviation of 5.7919) of 0.39, a 
sample size of 128 subjects in the escitalopram treatment group and 128 subjects in the placebo group will provide 85% power based on an MMRM model using simulation

CONFIDENTIAL  17.3 Telehealth  
For remote study visits subject data are collected via tele phone or telehea lth video calls 
using the technology provider. 
Overall Design  
In order t
o support the subject’s education, engagement and activity completion in the 
study, subje
cts will participate by using their own mobile tele phone. I f the subject’s 
own mobile tele phone model and/or operating system does not meet the minimum 
technology requirements , if the subject does not have a device or chooses not to do 
video conferencing then regular telephone contact will be allowed . Sites should remain 
consistent with either methods for each subject. 
If the subject decides to use their own mobile device, the subject will be provided with a 
study-speci
fic mobile application (app) to support reminders/notificati ons, activity 
completion, etc. This mobile app will be downloaded by the subject on their own mobile telephone from the Apple (iOS device) or Google Play Store (Android device) upon 
their receipt of a study -specific email with download hyperlink and unique study access 
code.  
The study- specific mobile application (app) will support the subject to complete 
study- spec 
ific activities such as : 
• Receive notifications for an ad -hoc telehealt h call . 
• Conducting Telehealth Virtual Visits with the investigator and/or a uthorized sit e 
representative.

The coronavirus  disease 2019 (CO VID-19) 
pandemic (and any other naming conventions 
used) developed after this study began and this protocol has been amended to account for study procedures that need to be modified in association with adhering to local safety 
guidelines or regulations.  
During the COVID -19 pandemic, r
 emote study 
visits, in which data are collected via telephone 
or videoconference, are possible but not preferred. Nearly all scheduled safety 
assessments, with exception of the Columbia -
Suicide Severity Rating  Scale ( C-SSRS) , are not 
possible by remote visit and must be collected in person via clinic visits. To accommodate changes sites may need to implement during the 
pandemic, Section 8.1.2 outlines the conduct of 
study assessments during in-clinic visits, wh ich 
is the preferred method of conducting the study, while study assessments for remote visits are 
included in Section 8.1.3.  Screening window extended to allow

immediately. If the study site is closed or the 
subject is unable to travel to the study site, 
alternate arrangements for in person clinical 
assessment should be secured. 
Option 1: In -Clinic Visits  
This is the preferred option. All study visits are 
performed as in -clinic visits with all assessments 
outlined in the Schedule of Assessments in 
Section 8.1.2.  
Option 2: Remote Visits (except Screening for 
all subjects and Baseline Visit for female 
subjects of childbearing potential)  
This option is only to be used if loca l guidance 
and regulations are preventing the site or subject from completing an in-clinic  visit. Screening 
must take place as an in -clinic visit with all 
assessments outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments in Section 8.1.2. The Baseline Visit 
must take place as an in clinic visit for all female 
subjects of childbearing potential with all 
assessments outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments in Section 8.1.2 (including 
pregnancy test). All other visits can be completed remotely with the assessments outlined i n 
Section 8.1.3.

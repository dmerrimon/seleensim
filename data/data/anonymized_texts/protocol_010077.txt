Protocol Number  02-CL-2001a  
Title:  A Multicenter, Single -Treatment Study to Assess the Safety and 
Tolerability of Lyophilized L ucinactant in Adults with COVID- 19 
Associated A cute L ung Injury 
Phase:  2a 
US IND Number:  149624 
Sponsor:  Windtree Therapeutics, Inc. (Windtree) , Warrington, PA, USA  
ClinicalTrials.gov No.:  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 
Committees:  DMC  
Study Drug:  Lyophilized l ucinactant  reconstituted with sterile water for injection 
and administered  at a dose of 160 ml ( ~80 mg total phospholipids 
(TPL)/kg lean body weight ), delivered as a liquid . 
Rationale:  The coronavirus that was first detected in China in 2019 and which 
has been detected in over 190 countries on every continent, has 
infected over 150 million people worldwide (including approximately 
3 million deaths), including approximately 35 million in the United 
States (including over 600,000 deaths). The virus  has been named 
“SARS -CoV -2” and the disease it causes has been named 
“coronavirus disease 2019” (abbreviated “COVID -19”).  
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people 
and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, 
and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then 
spread between people such as with MERS -CoV, SARS -CoV, and 
Protocol 02- CL-2001a  - CONFIDENTIAL - Windtree Therapeutics, Inc.

like MERS -CoV and SARS -CoV. All three of these viruses have their 
origins in bats. The viral sequences from U.S. patients are similar to 
the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent 
emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.  
Surfactants, specifically lucinactant, have been studied in acute 
hypoxemic respiratory failure and in acute lung injury. It is 
hypothesized that lucinactant may improve the respiratory status of patients suffering from COVID -19. 
Lucinact ant is a synthetic surfactant that is approved by the US FDA 
(NDA 021746) for the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in premature infants at high risk for RDS. It has been safely administered to over 1000 children and adults. Preliminary dat a from 
animal and human adult studies indicate that lucinactant could benefit those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the context of COVID -19 infection, improving oxygenation and lessening lung 
damage.  When given after intubation, lucinact
ant could potentially 
decrease the duration of ventilation or extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation (ECMO).  
ARDS, as a consequence of COVID -19 infection, seems to have a 
significant negative impact on surfactant related lung function. SARS -
CoV -2 uses the SA RS-coronavirus receptor, angiotensin- converting 
enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry into the host cells. ACE2 is a surface molecule on alveolar Type 2 cells of lung. Type 2 cells are the source of surfactant in the lung and if they are damaged surfactant production is impaired, resulting in decreased lung compliance. This appears to 
occur early in the course of COVID -19 lung injury. This increases the 
likelihood of the need for mechanical ventilation, which may further 
damage the lungs. Recent publications suggest that lung fibrosis and severe interstitial changes occur in COVID -19 patients who developed 
ARDS.  
In addition to the direct lung injury caused by COVID -19, there is a  
subsequent damage to the lung through triggering and activation of the 
inflammatory cascad e, similar to  that involved in the development of  
Protocol 02- CL-2001a  - CONFIDENTIAL - Windtree Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol   Version 2.1, 18 June 2021 
 
 
Page 7 of 69  bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ). There is data supporting benefit 
of lucinactant  to decrease the incidence and severity of BPD, 
supporting the rationale for use of exogenous surfactant in the 
treatment of pulmonary disease caused by COVID -19. 
Lucinactant significantly reduced mortality in a related pre -clinical 
model of H5N1 in ferrets infected with highly pathogenic avian 
influenza. Results showed 
that surfactant treatment significantly improved 
survival, as well as viral - 
and inflammation -related 
lung damage. 
 
Clinical evidence in patients with acute lung 
injury (ALI) showed potentially beneficial results in children on 
mechanical ventilation due 
to severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, incl uding 
pneumonia. Many studies in clinical ARDS have substantiated that 
damage to surfactant and inadequate quantities of functioning 
surfactant contribute to the pathophysiology of ARDS. Several studies 
in adult ARDS have established that lucinactant can b e safely 
administered to critically ill patients and potentially replenish the 
surfactant pool.  
In many animal models, surfactant replacement therapy of pneumonia 
has been studied showing decreased intrapulmonary bacterial 
proliferation, decreased bacteri al growth, and improved pulmonary 
function with increased pulmonary compliance. Clinical studies of 
surfactant in subjects with pneumonia have shown improvements in 
oxygenation and mean airway pressure, with one study showing a 
reduced need for ECMO. A ser ies of in vitro  studies  have shown that 
a synthetic surfactant containing KL4 peptide tends to be more 
resistant to inhibition by four serum components (fibrinogen, C -

known to inhibit s urfactant activity when compared with an animal 
derived surfactant.  
A study on r ecombinant surfactant protein C –based surfactant,  
indicat ed that among patients with ARDS caused by a direct lung 
injury, those who received surfactant tended to have a higher  survival 
rate than those  who received standard therapy. In fact, an oxygenation 
benefit was found across the entire population of patients who 
received surfactant.  
Lucinactant has an extensive safety profile and has been safely 
administered to over 1000 subjects in different patient populations 
(adults, infants, toddlers) for different indications  (eg, respiratory 
distress syndrome of the newborn ( RDS ), acute hypoxem ic respiratory 
failure (AHRF), ARDS) . In almost all cases, there were no safety 
signals of concern with rates of adverse events (AEs) being similar to 
control (placebo and active) . An increase in AEs was noted in one 
study when using bronchoalveolar lavage  to administer SURFAXIN ; 
however, bronchoalveolar lavage is no longer used and lyophilized 
lucinactant has a much lower viscosity then SURFAXIN, which also should minimize any temporary airway obstruction. 
It is hypothesized that lucinactant may improve th e respiratory status 
of patients suffering from COVID -19. 
Study Des cription : This is a multicenter , single -treatment  study. Subjects will consist of 
adults with COVID -19 associated acute lung injury who are being 
cared for in a critical care environment.  
See Section 1.2, Schedule of Activities (SOA) . 
Study Objective:  To evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of lyophilized 
lucinactant, as assessed by oxygenation index (OI) through 12 hours 
post initiation of dosing and other physiological and outcome 
measurements through 24 hours or through Day 30.

Page 13 of 69  Early Discontinuation 
of Treatment:  The administration of study treatment may be discontinued at any time 
prior to the completion of dosing based on the clinical judgment of the 
PI. Reasons for discontinuation of study treatment include, but are not 
limited to the following:  
1. An AE which places subject at risk occurs (eg, sever e bradycardia, 
hypotension, cardiac arrest)   
2. If, in the PI’s best medical judgment, initiating or continuing the 
subject’s exposure to study treatment is not in the best interest of 
the subject’s safety.  
Subjects whose treatment is discontinued based on the PI’s judgment 
will continue in the study. Subjects whose treatment is discontinued 
based on the subject’s request may continue in the study; however, if 
a subject withdraws consent, the subject will be withdrawn from the study and no further data collect ion will be done.  
Study Duration:  
Subject participation will be from enrollment to 30 days after 
enrollment unless  they have an ongoing SAE (to be followed for an 
additional 30 days).  
Overall, study enrollment will be completed in approximately 7 to 8 
months, with the last subject last visit approximately 8 to 9 months 
from the time the first subject enrolled.  
Statistical Analysis : The statistical analysis will be based on all enrolled subjects .  
For the efficacy analysis, populations of all enrolled subjects who 
received any treatment ( modified intent -to-treat [ mITT])  will be 
evaluated. For the safety analysis, all enrolled subjects who received 
any lucinactant (including partial doses) will be evaluated.   
All efficacy and safety parameters will be evaluated using summary 
statistics. For continuous variables, n, mean, standard deviation, 
median, min, and max will be presented; for discrete variables, 
frequency and percent will be presented.

Page 19 of 69  2 INTRODUCTION 
2.1 Study Rationale  
The coronavirus that was first detected in China in 2019 and which has been detected in over 190 
countries on every continent, has infected over 150 million people worldwide  (including 
approximately 3 million deaths), including approximately 35 million in the United States (including over 600,000 deaths) . The virus  has been named “SARS -CoV -2” and the disease it 
causes has been named “coronavirus disease 2019” (abbreviated “CO VID-19”).  
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS -CoV, SARS -CoV, and now with this new 
virus. The SARS -CoV -2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS -CoV and SARS -CoV. All three of 
these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir.  
Surfactants, specifically lucinactant, have been studied in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and in acute lung injury. It is hypothesized that lucinactant may improve t he respiratory status of 
patients  suffering from COVID -19.  
Lucinactant is a synthetic surfactant that is approved by the US FDA (NDA 021746) for the 
prevention of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in premature infants  at high risk for RDS . It 
has been s afely administered to over 1000 children and adults. Preliminary data from animal and 
human adult studies indicate that lucinactant could benefit those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the context of COVID -19 infection, improving oxygenat ion and lessening 
lung damage. When given after intubation, lucinactant could potentially decrease the duration of 
ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).  
2.2 Background  
COVID- 19 is the 3
rd serious coronavirus outbreak since 2002. At this t ime, the mortality rate 
associated with COVID -19 is approximately 5%. This is lower than the 10% and 36% fatality rates 
seen during the SARS and MERS coronavirus outbreaks , respectively. The characterization of 
COVID- 19 is still evolving. COVID -19 has some similarity to SARS including that it may be able 
to use the ACE2 receptor in the lung. However, the spread of infection appears to be more rapid with COVID- 19 compared to SARS ( over 150 million cases in 15 months  for COVID -19 vs 8098 
cases in 8 months  for SARS). Most reported cases have been in adults  and m ost hospitalized 
Protocol 02- CL-2001a  - CONFIDENTIAL - Windtree Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol   Version 2.1, 18 June 2021 
 
 
Page 20 of 69  patients have pneumonia . Many patients develop an ARDS -like clinical presentation,  some 
develop a secondary infection, and many require intensive care for respiratory support includi ng 
mechanical ventilation and ECMO. The fatality rate for COVID -19 patients hospitalized with 
pneumonia is 7- 10% (from CDC June  20, 2020). 
COVID- 19 uses the SARS -coronavirus receptor, angiotensin- converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for 
entry into the host cells. AC E2 is a surface molecule highly expressed in AT2 cells of lung, along 
with esophageal upper epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon which 
indicated digestive system along with respiratory systems is a potential route for COVID -19 
infection  (1). AT2 cells are the cells that produce surfactant in the lung. It stands to reason that if 
they are damaged by COVID -19, that surfactant production would be impaired. Recent 
publications suggest that lung fibrosis a nd severe interstitial changes occur in COVID -19 patients 
who developed ALI/ARDS. These changes resemble those seen in premature infants who are initially ventilated due to RDS and later develop BPD, which also presents with similar lung 
interstitial and f ibrotic changes  (2,3,4) . These observations may support the of use of exogenous 
surfactant in the treatment of ALI/ARDS caused by COVID -19. 
Lucinactant significantly reduced mortality in a related pre -clinical  model of H5N1 in ferrets 
infected with highly pathogenic avian (H5N1) influenza. Results showed that surfactant treatment significantly improved survival, as well as viral - and inflammation -related lung damage (Figure 
2-1).

Page 21 of 69  2.2.1 Unmet Medical Need in Treatment of COVID- 19 Associated ARDS  
Currently, when patients’ breathing deteriorates, they are placed on a mechanical ventilator (MV) 
to help them breathe while they are symptomatic. However, MV cannot correct the underlying issue involved with breathing difficulties , known as acute respirat ory distress syndrome (ARDS), 
and in many cases cannot prevent death. 
ARDS is a sudden, progressive pulmonary disorder characterized by lung inflammation and non-
cardiogenic pulmonary edema in association with refractory hypoxemia, decreased lung complianc e, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on the chest radiograph  (5). It may occur as a direct 
result of injury to the lung such as with gastric content aspiration, pneumonia (both bacterial and 
viral), toxin inhalation or it may be  associated with a wide variety of systemic processes such as 
sepsis, non- thoracic trauma, acute pancreatitis, multiple blood transfusions, fat embolism or shock  
(6). The pathophysiology of ARDS involves injury to the alveolar -capillary barrier, atelectasis, 
intrapulmonary shunting of blood flow and surfactant dysfunction. Despite advances in medical management in intensive care units, mortality from ARDS can be as high as 40%, and current 
therapy remains entirely supportive with no therapies having been demonstrated safe and efficacious and receive regulatory approval  (7,8,9,10,11,12,13) . 
The primary goal of ARDS treatment is to identify and correct the underlying etiology. For 
coronavirus this is supportive care until the virus is cleared by the immune system. Prevention of 
potential adverse effects of mechanical ventilation such as barotrauma and volutrauma is also critical. Using mechan ical ventilatory support as safely as possible and improving lung compliance 
can contribute to avoiding these complications.   
There is an unmet medical need for a therapy that will improve the patients’ respiratory status  and 
potentially reduce the time o n mechanical ventilators.  
2.2.2 Lucinactant   
Since the initial report of ARDS by Ashbaugh et al. (14), abnormalities of the surfactant system 
have been recognized. In subsequent studies, Petty and colleagues reported both qualitative  and 
quantitative alterations in surfactant obtained from patients with ARDS  (15,16) . It is now widely 
accepted that surfactant abnormalities play a major role in the pathophysiology of ARDS, favoring alveolar collapse, ventilation/perfusion mismatch, and increased pulmonary shunt fraction (17,18,19,20) . Not only have these chemical and functional changes been described in patients 
Protocol 02- CL-2001a  - CONFIDENTIAL - Windtree Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol   Version 2.1, 18 June 2021 
 
 
Page 22 of 69  with established ARDS, but simila r alterations have been described in patients at -risk to develop 
ARDS  (20,21) .  
Degradation of native surfactant by inflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species, and 
inhibition of surfactant functional activity plasma proteins have been implicated in impairment of alveolar surfactant. One of the hallmarks of ARDS is damaged alveoli and airways that are filled 
with fluid containing inflammatory cells, protein, inflammatory mediators and other debris. In 
addition, damage to the epithelial type II cells may result in decreased production and/or release of altered surfactant.  
The biophysical change in the surfactant system that occurs with ARDS is an increase in minimum 
surface tension  (20), while the biochemical changes in the surfactant system that occur with ARDS 
include:  
1) a decrease in the total phospholipid content  (20) ,  
2) an alteration in the phospholipid profile as demonstrated by a decrease in the percenta ge 
of phosphatidylcholine  (PC), dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine  (DPPC), and 
phosphatidylglycerol  (PG) (17,18,19,20) ,  
3) an alteration in the fatty acid composition of the phospholipids  (17,22) , 
4) a reduction in large surfactant aggregates  (23,24) , and 
5) a decrease in the surfactant associated proteins SP -A, SP -B, and SP -D (20,21,23) . 
Since many of the major pulmonary consequences of ARDS may be directly influenced by 
surfactant dysfunction, replacement treatment with exogenous surfactant is potentially efficacious 
in this disor der. In addition, damaged alveoli and airways are filled with fluid containing 
inflammatory cells, protein, inflammatory mediators and other debris.  
In a series of in vitro  studies, liquid lucinactant for intratracheal instillation (SURFAXIN
®) has 
been shown to be more resistant than natural lung surfactant and exogenous, commercially 
available animal -derived surfactant to the inhibitory effects of plasma proteins (including 
fibrinogen (25,26) ), and inactivation by hypo chlorous acid and reactive oxygen species  (27). This 
is especially relevant in the milieu of the inflamed lung that leads to natural surfactant inactivation 
and degradation. 
Additionally , lucinactant has been shown to modulate the inflammatory response in various 
models of lung injury. In addition to studies in a murine H1N1 influenza model, we have also 
generated data showing that lucinactant administration significantly attenuates protein leak and 
neutrophil migration into the  alveolar space in a hyperoxic and LPS lung injury model in mice

lamb model of RDS (as well in airway cell culture systems)  (29) , and ameliorates lung injury in a 
hydrochloric acid ALI model in spontaneously breathing pigs when delivered both as an 
intratracheal liquid instillate or as an aerosol (30,31) .  
2.3 Clinical Expe rience with Lucinactant  
Several studies in adult ARDS have established that surfactant can be safely administered to critically ill patients. In addition, c linical evidence in children with acute hypoxic respiratory 
failure (AHRF) showed potentially beneficial results of lucinactant in a group of patients with mild to moderate RSV infections, including pneumonia. 
Windtree has completed 13 clinical studies with lucinactant for intratrache al 
administration: 4 studies in adult subjects with ARDS ( Studies KL4-ARDS -01, 
KL4-ARDS -02, KL4 -ARDS -03, and KL4- ARDS -04), 1 study in children up to 2 years of age with 
acute hypoxemic respiratory failure ( AHRF ) (Study KL4-AHRF -01), 1 study in premature 
neonate s with RDS  (Study KL4-IRDS -01 [CP -1/CP -2]), 3  studies in premature neonate s at risk 
for developing RDS ( Studies KL4-IRDS -02, KL4 -IRDS -05, and KL4- IRDS -06), 1 study in very 
low birth weight ( VLBW ) premature neonates for the prevention of BPD ( Study KL4-BPD-01), 
and 3 studie s in full -term neonates with MAS ( Studies KL4-MAS -01, KL4-MAS -02, and KL4 -
MAS -03). Additionally three c linical studies with lucinactant for inhalation (reconstituted 
lyophilized lucinactant delivered via an investigational medical dev ice) have been completed in 
preterm neonates with RDS (Studies 03- CL-1201, 03- CL-1401 and 03 -CL-1202). There is 1 
ongoing clinical study with lucinactant for inhalation (Study 03- CL-1702) for premature neonates 
with RDS. Enrollment for this study has been terminated but data analysis is ongoing. A summary of selected studies is presented below.  
1. The KL4 -ARDS -02 study was a phase 1b safety trial in adult ARDS patients that  first 
attempted  to utilize bronchopulmonary segmental surfactant lavage of the entire lung to 
treat ARDS  (32). Bronchoscopic administration of dilute (2.5 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL) 
concentrations of lucinactant, when administered as two or three 30 mL aliquots followed 
by suctioning of all 19 bronchopulmonary segments, was safe and well tolerated in all 12 patients tested. A similar safety profile was observed in 4 of the 12 patients who received retreatment of the three 30 mL aliquot dosing regime n of lucinactant 6 -24 hours 
later. A second, similar trial was performed in 14 patients with ARDS. Nine of these

Page 24 of 69  received bronchoscopic administration of lucinactant. In these patients, the therapy was 
safe and well -tolerated.  
2. The KL4-ARDS -03 study was a  phase 2 , open- label, controlled, multi -center, 
international study of surfactant lavage for the treatment of ARDS in adults. Patients 
were randomized to receive either surfactant administered in low concentrations and 
large volumes via a bronchoscopic segm ental lavage technique (lung wash), or the 
current standard of care (SOC), which is MV and other supportive therapies. Surfactant was delivered with a bronchoscope to each of the 19 segments of the lung and was intended to cleanse and remove inflammatory s ubstances and debris from the lung, while 
leaving sufficient amounts of surfactant
 behind to help re -establish an adequate lung 
function and capacity to absorb oxygen. The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence 
of patients alive and off mechanical ven tilation for ≥  48 hours at the end of Day 28. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included mortality rate at the end of Day 28 and number 
of days alive and off mechanical ventilation for ≥  48 hours through the end of Day 28.  
Results suggest that a transient incre ase in oxygenation occurred in both of the 
lucinactant treatment groups during the dosing period. This increase in oxygenation 
appeared to be more sustained in the higher lucinactant dose group compared to the lower 
lucinactant dose group.  
3. The KL4 -ARDS -04 study was a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, open- label controlled 
study designed to assess the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of lucinactant delivered via 
bronchopulmonary segmental lavage to adult patients with ARDS.  The study population 
consisted of adult patients between the ages of 16.4 and 76.4 years (inclusive) who were 
intubated and required mechanical ventilation and who met the criteria for a diagnosis of 
ARDS . 
The study was conducted in 2 parts: Part A was designed to evaluate the safety and  
tolerability of 4 lucinactant treatment regimens; Part B was designed to evaluate the 
safety and effectiveness of 2 lucinactant treatment regimens from part A of the study 
compared to standard of care. An Independent Safety Review Committee evaluated the 
safety and tolerability data from each treatment regimen in Part A of the study.  
The key results of the trial showed that surfactant lavage exhibited a positive 
pharmacologic  effect manifested as improved oxygenation. This was demonstrated by an 
acute incr ease in the PaO 2/FiO 2 (P/F) ratio after patients received surfactant lavage.

Clinical Study Protocol   Version 2.1, 18 June 2021 
 
 
Page 25 of 69  Clinically  and statistically significant increases were observed in the P/F ratio at 24 hours 
after surfactant lavage, compared with SOC.  
All-cause m ortality at the end of Day 28 was not different between the l ucinactant groups 
and SOC (14.3%; 23.7%; 13.9%, respecti vely). The mean number of days that subjects 
were alive and off mechanical ventilation through Day 28 was slightly less for subjects 
in lucinactant Group B.2 (10.6 days) compared with lucinactant Group B.1 (14.4 days) 
and SOC (13.9 days).  
There were no meaningful differences noted in the clinical outcomes in patients classified as having direct or indirect ARDS . 
4. The KL4-AHRF -01 study was a phase 2, multicenter, masked, placebo- controlled trial 
in 165 infants up to 2 years -of-age. Infants were randomized to receive either lucinactant 
or placebo (33). For the primary outcome, duration of MV through 14 days, t here was no 
difference in the duration of MV between subjects treated with lucinactant and placebo 
treatment. There were no significant differences in other efficacy endpoints: ventilator 
free days, duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, duration of s upplemental oxygen or 
duration of hospitalization through 14 days post randomization. Similarly, there were no significant differences in fraction of inspired oxygen, P/F ratio and oxygenation index 
(OI) at any time point. There was a trend for improved oxygenation with lucinactant 
based on improvement in P/F from eligibility to 48 hours post dose . Subjects with milder 
disease seemed to respond better to lucinactant treatment , and statistically fewer 
lucinactant subjects required a second treatment; however , more lucinactant subjects 
required reintubation compared to placebo.  
Safety evaluations included assessment of adverse events during dosing (peri -dosing 
events), adverse events associated with endotracheal intubation and MV, and any other adverse event t hat occurred throughout the duration of the study. As expected, peri -
dosing events were more frequent in the lucinactant -treated subjects, since placebo 
subjects only received sham air. In general, peri -dosing events were transient and 
resolved when lucina ctant instillations were slowed. There were no significant difference 
in overall mortality between groups. All deaths were deemed to be not related to study treatment by the P rincipal Investigators. In summary, i n this study in ventilated infants 
with AHRF , treatment with intratracheal lucinactant appeared to be generally safe and 
well-tolerated despite the expected transient peri -dosing events observed. An 
improvement in oxygenation and the observation that significantly less requirement for

Page 26 of 69  retreatment was needed in the lucinactant -treated infants suggest s a pharmacologic 
effect.  
5. The KL4 -IRDS -02 (CP1/CP2) study was  a phase 1/2 clinical trial in premature neonates 
demonstrated that lucinactant is effective in the treatment of RDS in such patients (34). 
A total of 47 pre -term neonate s (750- 1750 g birth weight) were enrolled within the first 
four hours of life. All enrolled patients were treated with a bolus intratracheal injection 
of lucinactant (133 mg/kg or 200 mg/kg). 
Treatment with lucinactant rapidly improved oxygenation, improved lung expansion as 
demonstrated radiographically, and reduced ventilation support. The fraction of inspired 
oxygen (FiO 2) fell in conjunction with a rise in the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen 
in arterial blood compared to the alveoli (a/A O 2). There were no deaths related to RDS 
among the study neonate s, although two of 47 (4.3%) died of unrelated abnormalities : 
aortic  atresia and sequelae of extreme immaturity.  
6. The KL4 -MAS -01/KL4- MAS -02 study was a  multicenter , randomized, controlled phase 
1/2 trial comparing the safety and efficacy of lucinactant  lavage to standard of care for 
treatment of MAS in full- term newborn neo nates was performed (35). Results indicated  that 
the procedure was well tolerated in the 15 patients treated with lucinactant . There were two 
serious adverse events (SAEs) related to the drug:  one report of hypoxia which was 
considered by the investigator to be probably related to the drug and one report of 
hypotension which was considered by the investigator to be possibly related to the drug. The neonate s lavaged with lucinactant  exhibited mo re rapid and sustained improvement in 
oxygenation compared to control neonate s. Moreover, the lavaged neonates were 
disconnected from mechanical ventilation (MV) an average of three days sooner than 
control neonate s. 
7. The KL4-IRDS -06 study was  a phase  3, pivotal, multinational, multicenter, randomized, 
masked, controlled, event -driven, prophylaxis study in premature neonates  that 
demonstrated  lucinactant is significantly superior to colfosceril palmitate (Exosurf
®) in 
preventing and ameliorating RDS, reduci ng death due to RDS, and keeping neonates 
alive and without BPD, and  lucinactant is generally safe and well tolerated compared with colfosceril palmitate and beractant (Survanta
®) (36). In this study, a total of 1294 
neonates  less than 32 weeks of gestational age and weighing between 600 and 1250 
grams at birth were randomized at 50 study centers, 527 to the lucinactant group, 509 to the colfosceril palmitate group , and 258 to the beractant group. Efficacy analyses were 
Protocol 02- CL-2001a  - CONFIDENTIAL - Windtree Therapeutics, Inc.

Page 27 of 69  based on the intent -to-treat population (all randomized neonates). Safety analyses were 
based on all treated neonates (n=1288).  
Lucinactant was significantly superior to colfosceril palmitate in the primary outcomes 
and associated clinically important complicati ons of prematurity and mechanical 
ventilation. Compared with colfosceril palmitate treated neonates, significantly fewer 
lucinactant treated neonates had RDS at 24 hours (39.1% vs. 47.2% p=0.005) or died 
from an RDS -related death within 14 days of birth (4.7% vs. 9.4% p=0.002). All -cause 
mortality rates at 36 weeks post conceptual age (PCA) for lucinactant, colfosceril 
palmitate and beractant were 21.1%, 23.8% and 26.4% respectively.  
The incidence of adverse experiences in the study were those expected in this population 
and did not differ from those observed with colfosceril palmitate or beractant. 
8. The KL4-IRDS -02 study was  a phase 3, supportive, masked, multicenter, randomized, 
controlled study comparing lucinactant to poractant alfa (Curosurf®), lucinactant was 
shown to be non- inferior to poractant alfa for the endpoint of alive and not having BPD 
at 28 days of age in neonates with birth weight between 600 and 1250 grams, and 24 to < 29 weeks gestational age  (37). All-cause mortality rates throughout the course of the 
study were consistently lower in the lucinactant group but did not reach statistical 
significance. Lucinactant event rates for other key secondary outcome measures were 
similar to those in the poractan t-treated group.  
Adverse events ( AEs) and SAEs were reported generally with the same frequency in both 
treatment groups. Although significantly more instances of transient peri -dosing events 
were reported with lucinactant compared with poractant alfa, they  did not appear to lead 
to excess deaths, air -leak, or other neonatal complications. Interruption of administration 
of study drug in those neonates was very infrequent and no neonates discontinued 
lucinactant because of an AE.  
9. The KL4-BPD -01 study was a phase 2, multicenter , masked, placebo- controlled trial (38) 
assessing safety and efficacy of  lucinactant , in very low birth weight neonate s at risk for 
developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) randomized  136 premature neonate s to 
receive either lucinactant standard dose (175 mg/kg), lucinactant low dose (90 mg/kg), or sham air as a control.

standard 175 mg/kg lucinactant dosing compared with controls (57.8% vs. 65.9%, 
respectively) was observed.  This study also showed a higher survival rate through 36 
weeks post -menstrual age (PMA)  in neonates receiving the standard 175 mg/kg 
lucinactant dos ing compared  with controls (88.9% vs. 84.1%, respectively) a nd a 
reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation (approximately four less days) and need for supplemental oxygen in neonate s receiving the standard 175 mg/kg lucinactant dosing 
compared with c ontrols. 
Lucinactant therapy was generally safe and well tolerated  with generally no differences 
between the lucinactant treatment groups and the control group in common complications of prematurity. There were no differences noted in tolerability of  drug between the 
lucinactant  standard dose of 175 mg/kg (given at a volume of 5.8 ml/kg) and the 
lucinactant  low dose of 90 mg/kg (given at a volume of 3.0 ml/kg) . 
2.4 Risk/Benefit Assessment  
2.4.1 Known Potential Risks  
Risks for this study must be considered within the  context of treating adults with COVID -19, 
which carries with it substantial risk of morbidity and mortality. Intratracheal  instillation of 
surfactant into the lung requires endotracheal intubation, often with concomitant positive pressure MV. However , patients in this trial will have been intubated to treat their underlying condition. 
MV is associated with morbidities such as ventilator -associated lung injury and 
volutrauma/barotrauma resulting in air leak syndromes such as pneumothorax and/or pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE) . Surfactant instilled intratracheally has been associated with peri -
dosing events such as transient hypoxemia, bradycardia, and hypotension. These are usually not severe, are transient, and typically resolve within 30 minutes . 
Studies in adults with ARDS administered lucinactant using bronchopulmonary surfactant lavage 
of each segment of the lungs to attempt to remove alveolar debris and effectively deposit functional 
surfactant . Safety results show that this procedure was general ly safe and well tolerated ; however, 
this procedure was more invasive than other delivery methods and required more time and skill to 
complete dosing and may have contributed to the increased treatment -emergent AE  in the 
lucinactant -treated subjects . A total of 44 of 110 lucinactant patients (40%) and 14 of 42 standard 
of care patients (33%) experienced an SAE . A total of 15 of 88 lucinactant patients (17%) in KL4-
ARDS -04 had a n SAE that was considered to be related to study treatment  (patients receivin g

were observed in the ARDS studies. In the KL4- ARDS -04 Study, all -cause m ortality at the end of 
Day 28 was numerically, but not statistically significantly , higher in lucinactant Group B.2 ( 24%)  
compared with lucinactant Group B.1 and SOC ( 14% in each ). 
2.4.2 Known Potential Benefits  
All subjects enrolled in this study will receive surfactant therapy. Since many of the major 
pulmonary consequences of ARDS may be directly influenced by surfactant dysfunction, replacement treatment with exogenous surfactant is potentially efficacious in this disorder. Surfactant administration in adults with ARDS has been associated with improvements in 
oxygenation and is known to provide clinical benefits to preterm neonates, including a reduction 
in the risk of developing RDS or having RDS -related death . There is a potential that lucinactant 
may reduce lung inflammation and lessen the work of breathing. Nonetheless, t he hypothesis that 
SRT can provide benefit in acute lung injury has not been definitively answered. Windtree believes that with the appropr iate dose  and delivery technique, there is significant potential benefit for 
lucinactant to minimize lung injury in COVID -19 and to protect and support the lungs until 
endogenous surfactant is functional and the underlying pathological process is reversed.  
2.4.3 Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits  
Adults in this study will be given lyophilized lucinactant, an investigational medicinal product 
that, once reconstituted with sterile WFI , is chemically and physically comparable to the liquid 
formulation of the approved product, SURFAXIN. A s this is a single -treatment study, a ll subjects 
will be subject to the same risks  and benefits . Lyophilized lucinactant is expected to generally safe 
and well tolerated . 
Previous results from KL4- ARDS -04 where lucinactant was delivered via bronchopulmonary 
lavage have been taken into consideration in the design of the proposed study. Dosing will occur 
by a far less invasive procedure. Close safety review has been incorpora ted to monitor the safety 
profile and identify any findings that might merit a change to the study. The program is designed 
to be a rigorous, iterative process.  
We believe this plan provides an appropriate risk/benefit for the 02 -CL-2001a clinical trial.

Page 32 of 69  4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 Overall Design  
This is a multicenter , single -treatment  study in adults with COVID -19, who are being cared for in 
a critical care environment.  
Subjects will be enrolled into the lucinactant treatment group if they meet all the screening c riteria. 
Enrolled subjects will receive reconstituted lyophilized lucinactant (30 mg total TPL/mL) as a 
liquid at 160 ml (~ 80 mg TPL/kg lean body weight [~ 2.7 ml/kg lean body weight] ). Sites  from  the 
US and Argentina will participate in this study . 
See Section  1.2, Schedule of Activities , for more details on study measurements and the timing of 
measurements.  
4.2 Scientifi c Rationale for Study Design  
Reported illnesses with COVID- 19 have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported 
symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. The lungs appear to be affected in nearly 
all cases, with t ypical symptoms including cough and shortness of breath.  
Surfactants, specifically lucinactant, have been studied in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and in acute lung injury. Preliminary data from animal and adult human studies indicate that lucinactant could benefit those with  ARDS in the context of COVID -19 infection, improving oxygenation and 
lessening lung damage. Furthermore, lucinactant, given early in the course of the disease, could 
potentially decrease the need for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventil ation.  
It is hypothesized that lucinactant may provide relief of the respiratory symptoms, allowing patients to recover while suffering from COVID -19. 
4.3 Justification for D ose 
SRT has been proposed to treat ARDS in children and adults. SRT was initially successful in adult 
ARDS patients  (5) and later in pediatric patients  (39). These studies used a dose volume of 2–4 
ml/kg.  
Survanta
® (25 mg phospholipid [PL]/ml) was administered to adul t ARDS patients by 
endotracheal instillation  (5). Three dose groups were studied: up to 8 doses of 100 mg PL/kg (4 
ml/kg) , up to 8 doses of 50 mg PL/kg  (2 ml/kg) , and up to 4 doses of 100 mg PL/kg (4 ml/kg) . The 
Protocol 02- CL-2001a  - CONFIDENTIAL - Windtree Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol   Version 2.1, 18 June 2021 
 
 
Page 33 of 69  dosing strategi es used were chosen on the basis of experience with animal models and the desire 
to use an incremental approach in applying this untested therapy to patients. The FiO 2 at 120 hours  
after treatment began was significantly  decreased only for patients who rec eived up to 4 doses of 
100 mg PL /kg as compared with control patients (p =0.011). Mortality in the same group of 
patients was 18.8%, as compared with 43.8% in the control group (p =0.075). Intratracheal bolus 
instillation of Survanta was generally well tolerated, and no safety concerns were identified. Data 
did suggest that after 4 doses of 100 mg  PL/kg , further doses were accompanied by greater reflux 
and transient increases in peak inspiratory pressure than were seen with initial doses and did not result in apparent improvement in measures of gas exchange.  
Infasurf
® (35 mg PL/ml) was administered to children, 1 week to 21 years of age, with ARDS by 
endotracheal instillation  (39). Two doses of 80 ml/m2 were administered to patients ≥ 10 kg. 
Infants < 10 kg received 3 ml/kg (equivalent to the premature infant dose). The Infasurf  group 
experienced a decrease in oxygenation index from 20 to 13.9 after 12 hours compared with the 
placebo group’s decrease from  20.5 to 15.1 ( p=.01). Mortality was significantly greater in the 
placebo group compared with the Infasurf group ( 36% vs 19.5%) . No significant decrease in  
duration of ventilator therapy and ICU or hospital stay was observed. There were no differences 
in long-term complications.  
Future studies in ARDS patients switched to a lower dose volume of approximately 1 mL/kg. This change in dose volume result ed in a failure of SRT in adults  (40,41,42) . 
Venticute
® (50 mg PL/ml) was administered to a dult ARDS patients by endotracheal instillation  
(41). Up to 4 doses of 50 mg/kg (1 ml/kg) were administered to patients. O verall survival at 28 
days after treatment was 66 % and the median number of ventilator -free days was 0 . There was no 
significant difference in mortality or the need for mechanical ventilation between the Venticute and control groups. Patients receiving Venticute  had significantly greater , improvement in blood 
oxygenation during the initial 24 hours of treatment than patients receiving standard of care . 
However, this improvement was not sustained and was not significantly different by 48 hour s. 
These observations suggest the p ossible need for a prolonged treatment period, possibly with 
greater intervals between doses , with a larger number of doses , or with a larger dose volume . Up 
to 3 treatments (dose = 30 mg [60 mg PL/ml] per centimeter of height) were allowed if retreatment criteria were met. Infasurf administration was not associated with improved survival, length of 
stay or oxygenation. The authors speculated that the lack of response could be related to 
insufficient dosing of surfactant, since they choose not to administer a second dose of surfactant if the first was w ithout clear benefit. They also concluded that the lack of oxygenation benefit may

Clinical Study Protocol   Version 2.1, 18 June 2021 
 
 
Page 34 of 69  be due to ineffective timing of instillation and/or administration technique rather than lack of 
efficacy of exogenous surfactant  (40) . 
Based on previous clinical studies, as well as studies in several animal models of ARDS, the 
proposed dose of lucinactant (30 mg total PL/ml) is 160 ml ( 80 mg/kg lbw, based on an estimated 
60 kg lbw patient similar to those enrolled in the Survanta and Venticute studies ). Windtree 
believes that this dose addresses both the amount of PL required to sufficiently restore alveolar surface tension and the volume of lucinactant required to adequately coat the alveolar surface.  
4.4 End of Study Definition  
A subject is considered to have completed the study if he or she has completed all phases of the 
study, including the last scheduled procedure at Day 30. 
The end of the study is defined as completion of the last visit or procedure for the last subject in 
the trial (l ast subject/last visit) .

Page 36 of 69  5.3 Lifestyle Considerations  
The use of lucinactant in women of childbearing potential not using contraceptive measures should 
be avoided; women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test ( β-hCG) 
recorded prior to administration of lucinactant  and at the end of the study. Men and premenopausal 
women will be required to use double -barrier methods of birth control from enrollment through 30 
days following discharge from the hospital. 
Subjects should not smoke or use illicit drugs, including marijuana. 5.4 Screen Failures  
Screen failures are defi ned as patients who consent to participate in the clinical trial but are not 
subsequently assigned to a study intervention or entered in the study. A minimal set of screen 
failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure pa rticipants, to meet 
the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements , and to 
respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information will include the reason for 
screen failure and may include demography, eligibil ity criteria, and any serious adverse event 
(SAE).  
5.5 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention  
Subjects will be recruited from each institution  based upon inpatient admission for COVID -19. 
Patients or their legal guardians who wish to enroll will go through t he informed consent process; 
patients or their legal guardians will be reminded they may withdraw consent at any time. Informed 
consent will be administered in paper or electronic format.  
No overall recruitment strategies are planned; any strategies employ ed by a site must be approved 
by Windtree and their IRB /IEC  and be included in their site regulatory binder (with a copy sent to 
Windtree).

Page 37 of 69  6 STUDY DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION 
6.1 Treatment s Administered  
6.1.1 Study Intervention Description 
Lucinactant will be provided as a lyophilized powder in a 30 ml vial. Lucinactant will be 
reconstituted with 10 ml sterile Water for Injection (WFI). Reconstituted lyophilized lucinactant will be given at a volume of 160 ml, delivered as a liquid  in the tr achea. 
Lyophilized lucinactan t will be appropriately labeled with the investigational caution statements 
required by the regional health authority (eg, United States [US] Food and Drug Administration  
[FDA], the National Administration of Drugs, Foods and M edical Devices [ANMAT] ) to ensure 
that users are aware that the product is limited by federal law to investigational use only . Additional 
information can be found in the investigator’s brochure and in the package insert for SURFAXIN. 
6.1.2 Dosing and Administration 
Eligible patients will be enrolled into the study and receive lucinactant treatment. Treatment 
initiation is to begin within 6 hours of enrollment. The time of enrollment is defined as the time at 
which  it has been confirmed that the subject has met all inclusion criteria and has not met any 
exclusion criteria , and a request to the pharmacy to prepare study drug has been made . Enrollment 
should occur within 7 days of endotracheal intubation and MV. 
Initial Dose  
Reconstituted lyophilized lucinactant i s administered using the following instillation procedure: 
a. The ventilator will be set at an FiO 2 of 1.00. 
b. To prevent cough and throat closure, the patient may receive a short- acting paralytic.  
c. Lucinactant will be administered via a number 10 French end- hole suction catheter 
positioned in the trachea at the end of the endotracheal tube. The suction catheter will be 
inserted into the ventilator’s inspiratory tubing via a side-port connector.  
d. The total dose of lucinactant will be divided into four quarter-doses (40 ml) . Each 
quarter -dose will be further sub-divided into aliquots of 20 ml. Each quarter-dose will be 
instilled in one of the four positions listed below, one aliquot at a time. After each quarter dose, ensure the patient is stable before continuing the dosing. 
Protocol 02- CL-2001a - CONFIDENTIAL - Windtree Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol  Version 2.1, 18 June 2021 
 
 
Page 38 of 69  1. Quarter -dose administered with the patient supine and positioned 45° to the right. 
Each aliquot will be followed by 1 minute of ventilation. 
2. Quarter -dose administered with the patie nt supine and positioned 45° to the left. Each 
aliquot will be followed by 1 minute of ventilation. 
3. Quarter -dose administered with the patient supine and positioned 45° to the right. 
Each aliquot will be followed by 1 minute of ventilation. 
4. Quarter -dose ad ministered with the patient supine and positioned 45° to the left. Each 
aliquot will be followed by 1 minute of ventilation. 
During the administration of the lucinactant, the investigator should monitor the patient's oxygen 
saturation by pulse -oximetry. If the subject does not tolerate one of the 40 ml quarter doses, the 
dosing for that dose may be terminated at that time. It is recommended that the other quarter doses 
remain 40 ml; however, a lower dose may be administered for the remaining aliquots at the  
Investigator’s discretion. The investigator will remain with the patient during the first 10 minutes post- treatment. No ventilator changes are to be made during this 10- minute period unless cyanosis 
or bradycardia occur. At the end of this 10- minute perio d, the patient’s FiO
2 should be weaned to 
the patient’s pre -treatment FiO 2. The patient should not be suctioned for one hour following 
dosing. 
If, in the opinion of the investigator, the patient experiences clinically significant desaturations, 
hypoxia and/or bradycardia, the lucinactant administration should be temporally suspended to allow the patient to recovery. If the patient doesn’t not recovery in a reasonable time, the administration should be terminated. If the administration procedure is re -starte d and the patient 
experiences a second episode of clinically significant desaturation, hypoxia and/or bradycardia, 
the lucinactant administration should be immediately terminated.  
Retreatment  Doses  
Up to 3 retreatment doses are allowed no sooner than 6 hours apart (from completion of previous 
dose). Subjects are eligible for retreatments if they remain on MV, there is no evidence of 
pneumothorax, the P/F ratio is under 300 (or S/F ratio is under 315 (43), if no arterial line is 
present) , and there are no safety concerns that would prevent retreatment (in the opinion of the 
investigator). Retreatments are given at the discretion of the investigator , but it is encouraged  that 
retrea tments be given at the recommended time interval if the patient is still receiving MV and 
meets all retreatment criteria . 
Retreatment should be performed in the same manner as the initial treatment.

Page 40 of 69  6.2.4 Preparation  
Details for study drug preparation can be found in the study manual. Briefly, lyophilized 
lucinactant is reconstituted immediately before use by adding 10 m l of sterile WFI  to the vial of 
lucinactant, after which the vial is gently inverted to mix the suspension; no warming is necessary.  
Each vial is drawn up into a single -use syringe . The syringe  should be  labeled with the subject’s 
identification number.  
6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding  
For this study, the study drug (lyophilized lucinactant) is being delivered in an open- label manner  
and no randomization will occur; thus, no procedures to minimize bias relative to randomization 
or blinding will be employed. 
6.4 Study Interventio n Compliance  
Study treatments will be administered in an in -patient setting (ie, ICU) by  the PI or a person 
approved for dosing by Windtree . Completion of drug delivery for each treatment and re -treatment 
will be monitored; no other compliance measurements  will be employed. 
6.5 Concomitant Therapy  
Applicable concomitant medications (sedatives, paralytics, vasopressors, anti -coagulants, 
COVID- directed antiviral and anti -inflammatory therapy) will be recorded from enrollment until 
the final subject assessment.

Page 41 of 69  7 STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT 
DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
7.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention  
Study treatment may be interrupted at any time as circumstances dictate (eg, peri -dosing event ). 
In all cases, emergent care of the subject takes precedence over study treatment; however, it is 
important to complete SRT as soon as possible. If study treatm ent is interrupted or stopped, the 
reason for doing so must be recorded, especially in regard to peri -dosing events (bradycardia, 
desaturation, hypotension, pallor , gagging/regurgitation/vomiting).  
Discontinuation from study treatment does not mean discont inuation from the study, and the 
remaining study procedures should be completed as indicated. If a clinically significant finding is 
identified after enrollment (including, but not limited to changes from baseline), the investigator 
or qualified designee w ill determine if any change in participant management is needed. Any new 
clinically relevant finding will be reported as an AE.  
7.2 Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
The subject is free to withdraw consent from subject participation in the study at any time. An 
investigator may discontinue or withdraw a participant from the study i f any clinical AE or other 
medical condition or situation occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the subject.  
The reason for subject discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the end 
of study e CRF  page . Subjects who are enrolled and subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn or 
discontinued from the study, will not be replaced.  
7.3 Lost to Follow -Up 
All efforts should be undertaken to ensure that no subject is lost to follow -up. It is expected that 
subjects will remain in the study site until the end of study; however, if a subject is discharged 
prior to the final evaluation, the subject should be co ntacted  for the Day 30 visit. If the subject 
cannot be reached, at least 3 additional attempts must be made (at least one contact using telephone 
and at least one using email). If the subject still cannot be reached, a certified letter should be sent to th e subject. If contact cannot be re -established after the certified letter, the subject will be

Page 42 of 69  8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
A table of study procedures and activities is presented in Section 1.2.  
8.1 Screening Process  
Before conducting any study- related activities, the ICF must be signed and dated by the subject  or 
their legally authorized  guardian and retained by the site and the subject (Section  10.1.1 ). 
Evaluation of the entrance criteria are performed during the screening process. 
8.1.1 Demographics an d Baseline Characteristics  
The subject’s demographic data  will be recorded.  
8.1.2 Medical History  
During S creening,  medical history , and concomitant mediations  will be documented. 
8.1.3 Physical examination  
A physical examination will be conducted during Screening. Any relevant clinically significant 
abnormalities noted prior to enrollment should be recorded in the e CRF as part of the medical 
history (and not as an AE) .  
8.1.4 Respiratory  Support Parameters  
During screening, information on respiratory support parameters will be captured for subjects 
receiving MV . For the initial intubation, the following must be documented:  
• Date and time  support started;  
• The type of respiratory support and mode.  
Lung compliance should be recorded during screening. 
8.1.5 Enrollment  
Eligible patients will be enrolled into the study and receive lucinactant treatment. Treatment 
initiation is to begin within 6 hours of enrollment. The time of enrollment is defined as the time at 
which  it has been confirmed that the subject has met all inclusion criteria and has not met any

Page 43 of 69  exclusion criteria, and a request to the pharmacy to prepare study drug has been made. Enrollment 
should occur within 7 days of e ndotracheal intubation and MV .  
Following enrollment , dosing will proceed once the reconstituted product has been prepared (see 
the Study Manual for reconstitution and preparation instructions). Treatment initiation is to begin 
within 6 hours of enrollment . 
Just prior to dosing, vital si gns (including blood pressure, mean airway pressure, weight, and body 
temperature)  will be assessed . 
8.2 Treatment Period  
Reconstituted lyophilized lucinactant is administered as a liquid  within 7 days of initial intubation . 
8.2.1 Gas Exchange Parameters and Arteria l Blood Gases  
Values for fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2), oxygenation from pulse oximetry (SpO 2), mean 
airway pressure (P aw), end-tidal CO 2 (EtCO 2), and arterial blood gases (ABGs; PaO 2, PaCO 2, pH) 
will be recorded from just prior to dose administration and at 1  (±0.25) , 2 (±0.25) , 4 (±0.5), 8 
(±0.5), 12 (±1.0), 18 (±1.0) , and 24 ( ±1.0) hours after dose administration , daily through Day 5, 
and at Day 30.  
P/F and S/F ratios will be determined.  
8.2.2 Vital signs  
Blood pressure , heart rate, and body temperature  will be measured every 12 ( ±1.0) hours until 
Day 5 and at Day 30 . Systolic and diastolic blood pressure should be measured using either an 
arterial line or a manual sphygmomanometer with the patient in a supine or semi -supine position.  
Weight will be measured at baseline and at Day 30.  
8.2.3 Respiratory  Support Parameters  
Information on respiratory support parameters will be captured through Day 30 or discharge, 
whichever occurs first . For each intubation and change in respiratory support, the following must 
be documented:  
• Date and time  
Protocol 02- CL-2001a  - CONFIDENTIAL - Windtree Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol   Version 2.1, 18 June 2021 
 
 
Page 44 of 69  • The type of respiratory support and mode  
• The reason for each intubation and change of respiratory support  
Lung compliance should be recorded every 12 (±1.0)  hours through Day 5. The plateau pressure 
and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) will be measured every 12  (±1.0)  hours through Day 5. T he 
ventilation index will be calculated.  
8.2.4 Pressure Volume Loops  
Pressure volume loops will be recorded every 2 ( ±0.25)  hours through 24 hours. 
8.2.5 Readmissions and death  
Readmissions and death will be reported  through discharge and Day 30. Hospitalization will be 
defined as any unplanned hospitalization (including admission to a hospital or any attendance in 
an acute care setting e.g. ED, or in another health care facility) of 24 hours or greater, regardless of whether the patient was admitted to the hospital.   
8.3 Safety and Other Assessments  
8.3.1.1 Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications and therapies required for the general care of the subject are pe rmitted , 
including remdesivir and off -label drugs. Other investigational agents  or investigational medical 
devices  should be avoided. Concomitant medication s will be documented until the time the subject 
completes the Day 30, is discharged from the hospita l, dies, or is transferred to another hospital. 
Dose, route, unit, frequency of administration, indication for administration, and dates of medication will be captured  on the CRF . 
8.3.1.2 Tolerability of drug administration  
During dosing, the incidence of the foll owing will be recorded:  
o Oxygen desaturation  
o Bradycardia  
o Hypotension  
o ET tube obstruction

Page 45 of 69  8.4 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
8.4.1 Definition of Adverse Events  
An adverse event ( AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of 
an intervention, whether or not considered intervention related . An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of an investigational product  [21 CFR 312.32(a) , ICH E6(R2) ]. 
8.4.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “ serious ” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening 
adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or 
signifi cant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm re quiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization. 
8.4.3 Classification of an Adverse Event  
8.4.3.1 Severity of Event  
The severity of an AE is assessed by the PI using the followi ng definitions:  
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject’s daily 
activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some inter ference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a subject ’s usual activity level and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events may be potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating. Of note, the term “severe” does not necessar ily equate to “serious .” 
Protocol 02- CL-2001a  - CONFIDENTIAL - Windtree Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol   Version 2.1, 18 June 2021 
 
 
Page 46 of 69  8.4.3.2 Relationship to Study Intervention  
All AEs must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by the PI, based on temporal 
relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded 
using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect.  
• Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnor mal laboratory 
test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study intervention administration , 
follows a known response pattern to the study intervention, and cannot be explained by 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. An AE that is d etermined to be due to the 
subject’s underlying disease state or is common for this patient population generally should not be considered related.  
• Possibly Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (eg, the event 
occurred within a r easonable time after administration of the trial medication)  and/or 
follows a known response pattern to the study drug. However, other factors may have contributed to the event (eg, the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged 
as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “related ,” if appropriate. An AE 
that is determined to be due to the subject’s underlying disease state or is common for this patient population generally should not be considered possibly related.  
• Unlikely Related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose 
temporal relationship to study intervention administration makes a causal relationship improbable (eg, the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (eg, the subject’s clinical condition, othe r concomitant treatments).  
• Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study intervention administration, 
and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There should be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by the clinician.]  
8.4.3.3 Expectedness  
The Windtree Medical Monitor  or designee  will be responsible for determining whether an AE is 
expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent w ith the risk information previously described for the study 
intervention (ie, as per the Investigator’s Brochure) . 
Protocol 02- CL-2001a  - CONFIDENTIAL - Windtree Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol   Version 2.1, 18 June 2021 
 
 
Page 47 of 69  8.4.4 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -Up 
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel duri ng the study , 
or upon review by a study monitor. 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured 
on the appropriate eCRF. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately 
regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution. 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered 
as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorat es 
at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each episode. 
The site will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent 
is obtained until 7 days after the last day of study participation  or Day 30  (whichever occurs first) . 
Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization , or for 30 days 
after study participation . When possible, information collection should continue for subjects that 
withdraw or discontinue treatment early.  
8.4.5 Adverse Event Reporting  
All AEs are to be assessed in all subjects throughout D ay 30 (from enrollment to study withdrawal 
or completion) and documented in the study eCRF. Each AE should be reported spontaneously or 
in response to general, non- directed discussion with the attending nurse or physician (eg, “has 
there been any change in subject status since the last assessment period?” ). For each AE, the 
investigator should obtain all information required to complete the AE page of the eCRF, in accordance with eCRF completion guidelines (provided separately by Windtree).  
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or relationship to study participation, must be recorded (using medical terminology) in the source document and on the AE page of the eCRF. Whenever 
possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology. 
Protocol 02- CL-2001a  - CONFIDENTIAL - Windtree Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol   Version 2.1, 18 June 2021 
 
 
Page 48 of 69  All AEs must be followed until resolution or until a stable clinical end -point is reached, or for at 
least 30  days after the subject’s last day in the study if an AE is ongoing at the time the subject 
completes the study.  
Documentation of AEs in the eCRF must include the following parameters; (1) duration (time of 
onset and resolution), (2) severity or grade, (3) outcome, (4) action taken, and (5) rel ationship to 
study drug. AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). 
8.4.6 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
When an investigator -trained designee becomes aware of an SAE, Windtree must be notified as 
soon as possible (and no later than 24 hours after the event has occurred) by telephone, regardless 
of the relationship (or lack thereof) of the SAE to study participation. 
SAEs should be reported to Windtree’s reporting line. When reporting SAEs, the following 
information should be provided:  
1. Study identifier  
2. Study center  
3. Subject number  
4. A description of the event  
5. Date of onset  
6. Current status  7. Clarification on whether infusion 
therapy was discontinued 
8. The reason why the event is 
classified as serious  
9. The Investigator’s assessment of  the 
association between the event and study participation 
  
All reports of SAEs must be followed up within 24 hours (or sooner at the request of the medical 
monitor) by the completion of the SAE form and signature by the person who completed the form 
and the PI.  
Safety report distribution is the responsibility of Windtree or designee (ie, CRO), which coordinates distribution of safety reports to applicable regulatory authorities and ECs. Finalized safety reports are distributed by one or more individuals, “Responsible Team,” within a department 
that has responsibil ity to coordinate the distribution/submission activities, either directly or via a 
Local Submitting Party on behalf of Windtree.  
The Responsible Team receives finalized safety reports (eg, CIOMS -I form/MedWatch 3500A/  
E2B file/DSUR/SUSAR  Listing) and coordinates distribution to all applicable regulatory 
Protocol 02- CL-2001a - CONFIDENTIAL - Windtree Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol  Version 2.1, 18 June 2021 
 
 
Page 49 of 69  authorities and ECs. Distribution will be done in accordance with project -specific documents, 
regulatory requirements, other applicable reference sources, and applicable Windtree or designee 
safety procedural documents. 
In addition, Windtree coordinates translation when required for safety reporting. Windtree also 
coordinates transcription (eg, manual transfer of information from one reporting format to another) 
when required. Project specific information is used to identify appropriate recipients. Quality 
checks will be permed on the distribution documents and recipient information for completeness and accuracy prior to distribution. 
The names, telephone, and fax numbers of the individuals who should be conta cted regarding 
safety issues are listed below.

Page 50 of 69  8.4.7 Reporting Events to Subjects  
Occurrences of AEs or SAEs  that impact the risk to subjects in the study may result in a change in 
the informed consent form. S ubject s who ha ve not yet completed the study must be reconsented 
with the a mended informed consent form .  
8.4.8 Events of Special Interest  
Air leaks (eg, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum) will be considered AEs of special interest. Air 
leaks should be reported using the reporting line within 24 hours of becoming aware of the air leak.  
8.4.9 Reporting of Pregnancy 
The use of  lucinactant in women of childbearing potential not using contraceptive measures should 
be avoided; women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (
β-hCG) 
recorded prior to administration of lucinactant  and at the end of the study. Men and premenopausal 
women will be req uired  to use double -barrier methods of birth control for 30 days following 
discharge from the hospital. Failure to commit to double -barrier methods will be a reason for 
screen failure.  
If a wom an becomes pregnant during the study, the pregnancy will be fol lowed until delivery or 
termination, and pertinent information about the pregnancy will be collected (eg, AEs, concomitant 
medications).

Page 51 of 69  9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 Statistical Hypothesis  
As this is an open -label study with no comparison group, no hypothese s will be used for this study.  
9.2 Sample Size Determination  
The objective of this safety pilot  study is to determine if lyophilized lucinactant administration is 
safe and tolerable, and to assess the  impact on oxygenation for those patients suffering with 
COVID- 19. As a result, no formal sample size calculation w as performed  but instead enroll a 
sufficient number of  subjects to provide evidence that liquid lucinactant can be safely delivered as 
an int ratracheal bolus.  
Thus, up to 30 subjects (out of approximately 90 screened) will be enrolled.   
9.3 Populations for Analyses  
Populations of all enrolled subjects who received any treatment ( modified intent -to-treat [ mITT])  
will be evaluated  for safety and effi cacy. 
9.4 Statistical Analyses  
9.4.1 General Approach  
All efficacy and safety parameters will be evaluated using summary statistics. For continuous 
variables, n, mean, standard deviation, median, min, and max will be presented; for discrete variables, frequency and percent will be presented.  
9.4.2 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
The primary endpoint is the change from baseline in OI through 12 hours post dosing. OI is define 
as (FiO
2 × P aw × 100)/PaO 2. OI will be summarized using mean, standard deviation (SD), median, 
minimum, and maximum.

Page 52 of 69  9.4.3 Analysis of the Secondary Endpoint(s)  
9.4.3.1 Through 24 Hours Post Treatment  
OI, FiO 2, PaO2, SpO2, PaCO2, P/F and S/F r atios, change in plateau pressure and PIP measured 
on the ventilator , VI, and lung compliance will  be summarized as change from baseline at each 
time point measured using mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum.  
9.4.3.2 Through 30 Days  
Daily lung compliance on ventilator , ventilator free days , days in the ICU , days in the hospital , 
organ failure free days , and all -cause mortality will be summarized as was done for the primary 
endpoint. 
 
All deaths will be summarized using frequency and percent, overall and by type of death (respiratory or not respiratory) and included as part of the assessment of safety. Als o, the deaths 
will be listed by subject and narratives  for each death will be included. In this study, the secondary 
endpoint of ventilator -free days (VFD) is a mortality adjusted assessment. This issue will be dealt 
with in more detail in preparation for the next study. 
9.4.4 Safety Analyses  
Adverse Events will be coded using MedDRA (version 22.0 or later) and will be summarized by 
treatment group using frequency and percent but will not be compared statistically. Concomitant 
medications will be classified using  the WHODrug dictionary (March 20 20 or later) and 
summarized using frequency and percent. All-cause mortality, p hysical examination and medical 
history will similarly be summarized.  
9.4.5 Baseline Descriptive Statistics  
Demographic parameters will be summarized  by treatment group and assessed qualitatively for 
homogeneity of treatment groups. For categorical data (eg, sex, race), data will be summarized using frequency and percent; for continuous (parametric) data, data will be summarized by n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum.  
9.4.6 Planned Interim Analyses  
No interim analys es are planned , other than the safety assessments performed by the DMC .

10.1 Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations  
10.1.1 Informed Consent Process  
10.1.1.1 Consent/Assent and Other Informational Documents Provided to Participants  
The i nformed c onsent form (ICF) describ es in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and 
risks . The ICF (either electronic or paper) is  given to the patient and documentation of informed 
consent is required prior to starting administ ration of study intervention  or any study- specific 
procedures that are not part of usual care.  
10.1.1.2 Consent Procedures and Documentation  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to patient  agreement  to participate in the study 
and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Consent form s will be Institutional 
Review Board (IRB)  or Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC) approved and the patient will be 
asked to read and review the paper or electronic document. Within a maximum of 24 hours before 
administration of study medication, a medical s creening will be performed on all prospective 
patients to assess suitability for the study. The investigator will explain the research study to the 
patient and answer any questions that may arise. A verbal explanation will be provided in terms 
suited to th e patient’s comprehension of the purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study 
and of the rights of  research participants. Patients will have the opportunity to carefully review the 
consent form and ask questions prior to signing. The patients should have the opportunity to 
discuss the study with their family or surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The patient  will sign the informed consent document (in ink or electronically) prior to any 
procedures being done specifically for the study. Patients must be informed that participation is 
voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without prej udice. A copy of 
the informed consent will be given to the patient for their records  and will be retained in the site 
source documents . The informed consent process will be documented in the source document 
(including the date). The rights and welfare of t he participants will be protected by emphasizing 
to the  patient that the quality of their medical care will not be adversely affected if they declin e to 
participate in this study.  No waivers will be allowed for this study.

Page 55 of 69  10.1.2 Study Discontinuation and Closure  
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient 
reasonable cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by the suspending or terminating party to the pri ncipal  investigator  
and regulatory authorities. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the PI will 
promptly inform study participants and the IRB /IEC  and will provide the reason(s) for the 
termination or suspension.  
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  
• Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stopping  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
The study may resume once the reasons for suspension are addressed, and satis fy the sponsor, 
IRB/IEC  and/or Regulatory Agency (eg, FDA  or ANMAT ). 
10.1.3 Confidentiality and Privacy 
Subject confidentiality and privacy is strictly held in trust by the participating  investigators, their 
staff, and Windtree . The study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated 
will be held in strict confidence , in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) and other local privacy laws (such as Law 25326 in Argentina) . No 
information concerning the study or the data will be released to any third party without prior 
written approval of the sponsor.  All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as po ssible.  
The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the sponsor, representatives of the IRB /IEC , 
or regulatory agencies  may inspect all documents and records required to be maintained by the 
investigator, including but not limited to, medical re cords and pharmacy records for the 
participants in this study. The clinical study site will permit access to such records.  
The study participant’s contact information will be securely stored at each clinical site for internal 
use during the study. At the e nd of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location 
for as long a period as dictated by the reviewing IRB /IEC , Institutional policies, or sponsor 
requirements.

10.1.6 Safety Oversight  
Safety oversight will be under the direction of the medical monitor , the principal investigators, and 
a data monitoring committee ( DMC ). Given the open- label, single -treatment of this study, real 
time safety assessments of treated subjects will be done by the sponsor and principal investigators. 
10.1.6.1 Data Monitoring Committee  
The DMC, made up of at least 3 experts in the field of infectious dis eases , will evaluate the degree 
of risk involved in study subject participation within each treatment group and to determine if

Page 57 of 69  study continuation in accordance with the current protocol holds the potential to institute any 
undue harm or threat to the safe ty and welfare of study subjects .  
During the treatment and post -dosing phases, t he chair of the DMC will receive regular reports on 
SAEs and DMC members will be periodically updated on the program and trial status. An ad hoc 
meeting of the DMC will occur if the chair deems it necessary to address safety in the study. The DMC may recommend that s tudy enrollment be suspended if safety concerns are identified or 
suspected . 
10.1.6.2 Safety Reviews  
The DMC will meet after every 6 subject s have been enrolled and dosed. T he DMC will continue 
to meet after every 6 enrollments  and t hese reviews will continue until enrollment and dosing is 
complete.  
The DMC review  may consist of the evaluation of (1) demographics and baseline, (2) all AEs, 
especially peri -dosing AEs  and AEs of special interest , (3) case reviews of subjects with reported

Clinical Study Protocol   Version 2.1, 18 June 2021 
 
 
Page 58 of 69  Monitoring will be performed as in- person/r emote visits and centralized review of records. In -
person/remote  visits will include source data verification to the eCRF; some source data 
verification will be performed  unless otherwise specified in the CMP .  
Before enrollment, a clinical site monitor will complete a site initiation visit (SIV) at each study 
site. During SIVs, clinical site monitors will provide study training to site staff, ensure study drug 
storage is in accordance with the study protocol, and validate all other study requirements in accordance with the study monitoring plan.  
Clinical site monitors will schedule a study site visit as close as possible to the time of each site’s 
first enrolled study subject; periodic follow -up monitoring visits will ensure on a regularly 
scheduled basis throughout the study, in accordance with enrollment at the study site. At these visits, the clinical site monitor will compare the data entered into the eCRF with the hospital or clinic records (source documents) and check for protocol compliance. Document ation reviews will 
include but not be limited to the evaluation and confirmation of the following:  
1. A record of informed consent . 
2. Adherence to enrollment criteria.  
3. Completion of all required study assessments . 
4. Accurate and complete data capture of all AEs,  concomitant medications, and safety and 
efficacy observations.  
5. Study drug storage and dispensing records maintained in accordance with study and 
regulatory requirements.  
Findings from these reviews will be discussed with the PI and study site staff.  
The dates of the monitoring visits will be recorded by the clinical site monitor in a sign -in log to 
be kept at the site. The study coordinator and PI are expected to be available for questions, have all source documentation readily available, and have a suit able environment provided for review 
of study- related documents.  
In accordance with ICH GCP , Windtree will select (either directly or through a subcontract with a 
company specifically trained in the monitoring of clinical studies), qualified individuals to monitor 
study sites to ensure the quality of study progress and the close adherence of study sites to the study protocol and all related governing documents and SOPs.

investigator and study staff understands the following:  
a) The investigational status of the study drug, placebo and the requirements for its 
accountability . 
b) The need to uphold all directives within the clinical protocol as it relates to study 
conduct and subject safety at the study site . 
c) The obligation to obtain informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and ICH GCP guidelines before enrolling each subject in the study. 
d) The obligation to obtain IRB/IEC review and approval of the study before study 
initiation at his/her clinical site, and ensure timely updates to the IRB/ IEC as mandated 
by local and national regulatory requirements, and to ensure timely communications to Windtree of all IRB/ IEC communications (to include reviews and subs equent actions) 
concerning the study.  
2. The clinical site monitor(s) will perform periodic visits to each clinical site during the course of the study to ensure the study protocol is being followed and that:  
a) Drug and  placebo  inventories are being properly ma intained and documentation of vial 
usage is accurate and complete.  
b) The assignment of responsibilities log is up -to-date and that changes in personnel are 
reported to Windtree.  
c) The PI is reporting all serious or fatal AEs (Section  8.4.6) as soon as possible, and in 
no case later than 24 hours after the event, to the medical monitor or designee at Windtree.  
3. The clinical site monitor(s) will perform an end -of-study visit to eac h clinical site to ensure 
that: 
a) All drug reconciliation forms, as provided in the study manual, are accurate and 
complete.  
b) All used and unused vials of study drug have been reconciled.  
c) All eCRFs are complete and all monitoring of eCRFs has been completed.  
Details of clinical site monitoring are documented in a CMP. The CMP describes in detail who 
will conduct the monitoring, at what frequency monitoring will be done, at what level of detail 
monitoring will be performed, and the distribution of monitoring re ports. 
10.1.8 Quality Assurance and Quality Control  
Each clinical site will perform internal quality management of study conduct, data  collection , and 
documentation. An individualized quality management plan will be developed to descri be a site’s 
quality manageme nt.

Clinical Study Protocol   Version 2.1, 18 June 2021 
 
 
Page 60 of 69  Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and 
data QC checks that will be run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data 
anomalies will be communicated to the site(s) for clarification/resolution.  Following written  SOPs, 
the monitors will verify that the clinical trial is conducted and data are collected, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source data/documents, 
and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by the sponsor, and inspection by local and 
regulatory authorities.  
10.1.9 Data Handling and Record Keeping 
10.1.9.1 Data Collection and Management Responsibilities  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the site investigator. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, 
legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.  All source documents should be completed in a neat, 
legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data.  
Hardcopies of the study visit worksheets may be provided for use as source document worksheets 
for recording data for each participant enrolled in the study. Data recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) derived from source documents should be consistent with the data recorded 
on the source documents. Study personnel at each site will enter data fr om source documents into 
the protocol -specific eCRF within 5 days of the information becoming available. Subjects will not 
be identified by name in the study database or on any study documents to be collected by Windtree (or designee) but will instead be i dentified by a site and subject number.  
Clinical data (including AEs, concomitant medications, and expected adverse reactions data) will be entered into a 21 CFR Part 11- compliant data capture system . The data system includes 
password protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate.  
Members of Windtree’s Data Management department are responsible for data processing, in 
accordance with procedural documentation and a study specific Data Management Plan (DMP). Windtree’s Data Management will also provide eCRF Completion Guidelines; extr a training will 
be provided to the study sites when necessary.

Clinical Study Protocol   Version 2.1, 18 June 2021 
 
 
Page 61 of 69  Clinical data will be entered directly from the source documents. After data have been entered into 
the study database, a system of computerized data validation checks will be implemented and 
applied to the database on a regular basis. Corrections for an existing eCRF record will automatically be recorded by the eCRF system (audit trail capturing the  time, date, and the 
identification of the user who entered or updated eCRF data). Recorded corr ections by the eCRF 
will create an electronic audit trail of study documentation.  
Database lock will occur once all quality assurance procedures have been completed; this will include but not be limited to the following: (1) all site -based study data have been entered into the 
eCRF, (2) all entered data have been reconciled and reviewed by Windtree or designee, and (3) all 
data related queries have been rendered and resolved.  
All procedures for the handling and analysis of data will be conducted using good computing 
practices meeting FDA guidelines for the handling and analysis of data for clinical trials. 
10.1.9.2 Study Records Retention 
All records that support data entered into the eCRF of each subject must be retained in the files of 
the PI or the institution/site  for a minimum of 2  years (3  years for ICF) following notification by 
Windtree that all investigations have been discontinued or that the last approval of a marketing application has been obtained. These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, 
if required by local regulations. No records will be destroyed without the written consent of 
Windtree. It is the responsibility of Windtree to inform the investigator when these documents no 
longer need to be retained. 
Supporting documents will include but not be limited to the following:  
1. Copies of eCRFs (given to the site on a CD)  
2. All original source documents; these may include but not be limited to the following:  
a) ICFs  
b) laboratory reports  
c) progress notes  
d) medical histories  
e) physical and diagnostic findings  
f) diagnoses  
g) dates of therapy before and during this study  
h) drug dispensing/disposition records

Page 62 of 69  If the PI retires, relocates, or for other reason withdraws from the responsibility of keeping the 
study records, custody must be transferred to a person who will accept the responsibility. Windtree 
must be notified in writing of the name and address of the new custodian.  
10.1.10 Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, ICH GCP, or Study 
Manual requirements. The noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the 
investigator, or the study site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by the site and implemented promptly.  
These practices are co nsistent with ICH GCP:  
4.5, Compliance with Protocol , sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
5.1, Quality Assurance and Quality Control , section 5.1.1  
5.20, Noncompliance , sections 5.20.1, and 5.20.2.  
It is the responsibility of the site investigator to use continuous vigilance to identify and report 
deviations within 10 working days of identification of the protocol deviation, or within 10 working 
days of the scheduled protocol -required activity. All deviations must be addressed in study source 
documents  and reported to the site monitor . Protocol deviations must be sent to the reviewing 
IRB/IEC per their policies. The site investigator is responsible for knowing and adhering to the 
reviewing IRB /EC requirements . Further details about the handling of protocol deviations will be 
addressed in the protocol deviation process.  
10.1.11 Publication and Data Sharing Policy  
The preparation and submittal for publication of a manuscript containing the study results shall be 
in accordance with a process determined by a mutual writ ten agreement among Windtree and 
participating institutions.  
The publication or presentation of any study results shall comply with all applicable privacy laws, 
including but not limited to HIPAA. T his trial will be registered at ClinicalTrials.gov  and the 
International Clinical Trial Registration Platform (ICTRP),  and results information from this trial 
will be submitted to both. In addition, every attempt will be made to publish results in peer -
reviewed journals.

Page 63 of 69  10.1.12 Conflict of Inte rest Policy  
The independence of this study from any actual or perceived influence is critical. Therefore, any 
actual conflict of interest of persons who have a role in the design, conduct, analysis, publication, or any aspect of this trial will be disclose d and managed. Furthermore, persons who have a 
perceived conflict of interest will be required to have such conflicts managed in a way that is 
appropriate to their participation in the design and conduct of this  trial. The study leadership has 
established policies and procedures for all study group members to disclose all conflicts of interest 
and will establish a mechanism for the management of all reported dualities of interest.  
The FDA has issued regulations (21 CFR  Part 54, Financial Disclosure by Clini cal Investigators ) 
that require sponsors to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements to 
certify the absence of certain financial interests of clinical investigators, when clinical studies are submitted to FDA in support of market ing approval. These regulations are intended to ensure that 
financial interests and arrangements of clinical investigators, that could affect reliability of data 
submitted to FDA in support of marketing approval, are identified and disclosed by the sponsor . 
Clinical investigators will be asked to disclose proprietary (eg, patent, licensing agreement) and 
financial (eg, stock options, royalty) interests as they pertain to Windtree, before participating in the study. In addition, clinical investigators will be required to consult with Windtree before 
acquiring any financial interest in the company and must disclose any change in their proprietary or financial interests, if it occurs during the course of the study and for 1  year following study 
completion. The requirement for proprietary and financial disclosure also includes any ownership 
by the spouse or any dependent subject of the clinical investigator.  
If FDA determines that the financial interests of any clinical investigator raise serious questions 
about the integrity of the data, FDA will take any action it deems necessary to ensure the reliability 
of the data, including:  
1. Initiating agency audits of the data derived from the clinical investigator in question. 
2. Requesting that the sponsor submit further data analyses (eg, to evaluate the effect of the clinical investigator’s data on overall study outcome) . 
3. Requesting that the applicant conduct additional independent studies to confirm the results 
of the questioned study.

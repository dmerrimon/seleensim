 STUDY PROTOCOL  
1. BACKGROUND AND  RATIONALE  
1.1. General  Introduction  
Arthroscopic technique is being utilized more to treat a wide variety of pathologic conditions of the shoulder. 
Adequate visual clarity is imperative to safely and effectively perform arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Addition of 
epinephrine to the arthroscop ic irrigation can help to improve visual clarity [1 -4].

1.2. Rationale and justification for the  Study  
a. Rationale for the Study  Purpose  
Addition of epinephrine to arthroscopic irrigation raises the cost of the procedure and has the potential for rare, b ut 
serious, cardiovascular adverse events [5 -9]. We have also used a subacromial injection of bupivacaine epinephrine 
prior to the initiation of the surgical procedure. This helps us limit the use of epinephrine to the first 6 liters of 
irrigation fluid. I n this way, we limit the cost of the surgery as well as the total dose of epinephrine to decrease the 
likelihood of epinephrine -related adverse events, without sacrificing visual clarity. Additionally, when visualization 
is limited, surgeons may increase t he pump pressure of arthroscopic fluid within the shoulder. This increases fluid 
extravasation into the surrounding soft tissues, and can cause difficulties with surgical exposure. We propose a 
double -blinded, randomized controlled trial to compare the use  of subacromial injection of bupivacaine with and 
without epinephrine to determine the effectiveness in terms of visual clarity.

b. Rationale for Doses  Selected  
The dose of bupivacaine with epinephrine to be injected into the subacromial space prior to surgery will be the 
standard dose we have administered as part of our routine surgical protocol. The dose of epinephrine injected into 
the subacromial space will be 0.3 mg of epinephrine in 30mL of 0.5% bupivacaine for a dilution of 1:100. A total 
volume of 20 mL of the mixed solution will be injected into the subacromial space prior to the start of the surgery. 
The dose of epinephrine to  be used in the arthroscopic irrigation fluid is 5 mL of epinephrine in 5 liters of sterile 
saline for a dilution of 1:1000. These doses of epinephrine in the subacromial injection as well as the arthroscopic 
irrigation fluid have been used for several yea rs by the study investigators without any epinephrine -related 
cardiovascular adverse events. By limiting the use of epinephrine to the pre -operative injection and the first 10 liters 
of arthroscopic irrigation only as opposed to using epinephrine in the ir rigation fluid throughout the surgery, we aim 
to limit the total dose of epinephrine, thereby limiting cost and minimizing the risk of epinephrine -related 
cardiovascular adverse events. Due to supply shortages, if 0.5% bupivacaine is unavailable then 0.25%  bupivacaine 
will be substituted. All other dosing instructions will remain unchanged.  
 
c. Rationale for Study  Population  
Our study population will be adult (18 years of age or older) patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery 
requiring visualization w ithin the subacromial space. This includes primarily arthroscopic rotator cuff debridement 
or repair,  arthroscopic  subacromial  decompression,  arthroscopic  subacromial  bursectomy  or bursal  debridement,  and 
arthroscopic distal clavicle resection, among other  arthroscopic procedures. Only procedures performed in the 
seated, upright (ie, beach chair) position will be included as these cases present a unique challenge. The concept of 
“controlled hypotension” has been described as one technique for better visual clarity in the subacromial space, 
though this technique has been shown to affect cerebral blood flow and oxygenation [10]. Effective local 
hemostasis within the subacromial space to preserve visual clarity may obviate the need for controlled hypotension, 
thereby making surgery  safer.

 d. Rationale for Study  Design  
We propose a double -blinded randomized controlled trial to minimize bias and ensure similar baseline 
characteristics of the patients in each study group. Patients will be randomized to receive a pre -operative 
subacromial injection containing either bupivac aine with epinephrine, or bupivacaine alone. We will collect 
baseline characteristics of patients as well as potential confounding factors throughout and after the surgery to 
ensure that any difference in surgeon -rated visual clarity is a direct consequenc e of the intervention.  
 
2. HYPOTHESIS AND  OBJECTIVES  
2.1. Purpose/Hypothesis  
Purpose:  The aim of this study  is to investigate  the effect  of a pre-operative  subacromial  injection  containing 
epinephrine on the visual clarity during subacromial arthroscopic shoulder  surgery.  
Hypothesis:  Pre-operative  injection  of epinephrine  into the subacromial  space  will result  in improved  surgeon -rated 
visual clarity as well as decrease the need for increased arthroscopic irrigation pump pressure throughout the 
arthroscopic shoulder surgery as compared to injection not containing  epinephrine.  
 
2.2. Primary  Objectives  
To evaluate surgeon -rated vi sual clarity and the need for increased irrigation pump pressure during arthroscopic 
shoulder surgery.  
 
2.3. Secondary  Objectives  
To evaluate mean arterial pressure, operative time, and any adverse events that occur during arthroscopic shoulder 
surgery.  
 
2.4. Potent ial Risks and  Benefits:  
a. End Points - Efficacy  
The use of epinephrine injection into the subacromial space prior to surgery may improve surgeon -rated visual 
clarity throughout surgery and obviate the need for increased irrigation pump pressure increases. Li miting the total 
dose of epinephrine required for adequate visualization helps to limit both the total cost and the potential for 
cardiovascular adverse events related to the use of epinephrine. Improved visual clarity may also decrease total 
operative tim e, which would further decrease the cost of the surgery. Obviating the need for increasing the 
irrigation pump pressure decreases the extravasation of fluid from the subacromial space into the soft tissues, 
thereby decreasing intra -operative and post -opera tive swelling leading to improved pain post -operatively.  
 
b. End Points - Safety  
While there are several published case reports describing epinephrine -related cardiovascular adverse events during 
shoulder arthroscopic surgery, all of these have occurred with the use of epinephrine within the irrigation fluid 
throughout the case. By limiting the use of epinephrine to the pre -operative subacromial injection and only the first 
6 liters  of arthroscopic  irrigation  fluid  rather  than throughout  the entirety  of the surgery,  we hope  to decrease  the risk 
of these uncommon adverse  events.  
 
3. STUDY  POPULATION  
3.1. List the number of subjects to be  enrolled.  
Thirty (n=30) subjects recruited from Texas will be sought for each group for a total enrollment of sixty (n=60). 
This is from a power analysis performed. The minimal clinically significant difference in visual acuity score (0 -10) 
is 2 points, or 20%, as established in a prior study [1]. In order to ensure 80% power at an alpha of 0.05, a minimum 
of 26 patients are needed in each study group.  
[1] D. Avery, et al., Arthroscopy 31(1) (2015) 12 -8. 
 
3.2. Criteria for  Recruitment  
Our study population will be adult (18 years of age or older) patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery 
requiring visualization within the subacromial space. This includes primarily arthroscopic rotator cuff debridement 
or repair, arthroscopic suba cromial decompression, arthroscopic subacromial bursectomy or bursal debridement, and 
arthroscopic distal clavicle resection, among other arthroscopic procedures. Only procedures performed in the 
seated, upright (ie, beach chair) position will be included.  Study participation will be contingent upon signed 
informed consent obtained prior to performing data collection or study procedures.  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-21-1061 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/02/2022  
 
 3.3. Inclusion  Criteria  
Patients will be included  who:  
- Are individuals 18 years of age or  older  
- Are able to provid e informed  consent  
- Undergo  arthroscopic  shoulder  surgery  in the seated  upright  (beach -chair)  position  requiring  visualization 
within the subacromial  space  
 
3.4. Exclusion  Criteria  
Subjects meeting any of the exclusion criteria at baseline will be excluded from participation. These criteria include 
those who:  
- Are unable to provide informed  consent  
- Non-English  speaker  
- Have a history of adverse medication reaction to  epinephrine  
- Arthroscopic  shoulder  surgery  not requiring  visualization  in the subacromial  space  or performed  inthe 
lateral position  
 
3.5. Withdrawal  Criteria  
Subject study participation will be discontinued upon patient request.  
 
3.6. Subject  Replacement  
There is no intervention or required follow -up after the pre -operative subacromial injection, so patient drop -out will 
be minimal.  
 
4. TRIAL  SCHEDULE  
Based on historic clinic data for the principal investigator and co -investigators, we anticipate meeting our enrollment 
target around 12 weeks from opening enrollment. Once enrolled, subjects will be randomized into either the 
epinephrine or placebo group. Surgeon -rated visual clarity score will be obtained immediately post -operatively.  
 
5. STUDY  DESIGN  
5.1. Summary of Study  Design  
The study utilizes parallel groups with randomized assignments. Randomization will be performed prior to surgery 
and group designation will be placed within an opaque envelope in the patient’s chart. The circulating nurse will 
prepa re the pre -operative injection: study patients will receive an injection containing a total volume of 20 mL of 
bupivacaine with epinephrine (0.3 mL epinephrine in 30 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine)whereas control patients will 
receive an injection containing 20mL of 0.5% bupivacaine alone. The syringe will not be labeled, and the contents 
of the injection will not be disclosed to the surgeon to preserve blinding. The injection will be performed with an 
18-gauge needle into the subacromial space via a posterior or l ateral approach after positioning the patient in the 
beach chair position, but prior to prepping and draping. The first 10 liters of arthroscopic irrigation used during the 
case will contain a total of 10 mg of epinephrine (dilution 1:1000), then saline wi thout epinephrine will be used for 
the remainder of the surgical procedure. Throughout the case, the mean arterial pressure of the patient will be 
monitored. At the conclusion of the surgical procedure, the surgeon will rate visual clarity on a visual anal og scale 
from 0 to 10. We will also record changes in pump pressure from the initial pressure of 35mmHg during the 
surgical procedure. Finally, we will note any adverse events during or after the surgical procedure. In the unlikely 
event of an intra -operat ive or early post -operative adverse event that may be related to epinephrine administration, 
the presence or lack of epinephrine will be revealed to the anesthesiology team to ensure optimal treatment of the 
adverse event.  
 
6. METHODS AND  ASSESSMENTS  
6.1. Randomiz ation and  Blinding  
Simple randomization of enrolled subjects will occur prior to surgical intervention. A certified random number 
generator will be accessed that will generate a number to assign to the enrolled patient. A research coordinator will 
bring th e randomization envelopes on the day of surgery. Blinding of enrolled subjects will be performed to prevent 
bias from occurring based on patient expectations of the procedure. To reduce recall bias, group allocation will be 
kept concealed from the investig ator until the completion of visual clarity scoring at the conclusion of each surgical 
procedure.

9. SAFETY  MEASUREMENTS  
9.1. Definitions  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence ass ociated with the use of an investigational 
product in humans and that does not necessarily have a causal relation with the investigational product. AEs can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom , or disease  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-21-1061 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/02/2022  
 
 temporally associated with the use of an investigational procedure or product, whether or not related to the 
investigational procedure or product.  
An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in the view of the investigator, it res ults in any of the following 
outcomes:  
- Led to  death  
- Led to serious deterioration in health of the subject, that either resulted  in 
o A life -threatening illness or injury,  or 
o A permanent impairment of a body structure or function,  or 
o Inpatient or prolonged hospitalization,  or 
o Medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent  life-threatening  illness  or injury  or permanent 
impairment to a body structure or a body  function  
- Led to fetal distress, fetal death or congenital abnormality or birth d efect,  or 
- Required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage,  or 
- Other  serious  events  that do not fit the other  outcomes,  but the event  may jeopardize  the subject  and may 
require medical or surgical intervention (treatment) to prevent one of the other  outcomes.  
Within 48 hours of becoming aware of a SAE, the investigator must complete the SAE report (providing as much 
information as is immediately available). The invest igator must submit this SAE report to the study’s DSMB. The 
investigator must also report all SAEs to the IRB, as is required by the IRB.  
 
9.2. Collecting, Recording and Reporting of Adverse  Events  
Adverse Events (AEs) will be collected throughout the study and all AEs will be captured. The Investigator or 
designee will record all AEs on the appropriate CRFs. Investigators are responsible for reporting all AEs and SAEs. 
The investigator will assess s ubjects at each study visit for the occurrence of AEs. In order to avoid bias in eliciting 
AEs, subjects should be asked non -leading questions. All AEs, regardless of severity, reported by the subject or 
found on examination or report, must be recorded. Al l AEs must be followed until resolution is reached. All 
treatments and outcomes of the AE must be recorded. All AEs and SAEs must be followed until:  
- AE is resolved (i.e., return to normal/baseline  values)  
- Subject is lost to follow -up or withdraws  consent  
- Subject completes study, including required follow -up visits  
- Study  closure  
The investigator must, following GCP guidelines, continue to treat (or refer subject to an appropriate practitioner for 
continuing treatment of any AE that remains unresolved after t he subject has completed study participation. The 
severity of all AEs will be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe based on the following definitions:  
- Mild: The subject is aware of the sign or symptom, but finds it easily tolerated. The event is of lit tle 
concern  to the subject  and/or  little clinical  significance.  The event  is not expected  to have  any effect  on the 
subject’s overall health or  well-being.  
- Moderate: The subject has discomfort enough to cause interference with or change in usual activities. The 
event is of some concern to the subject’s health or well -being and may require medical intervention and/or 
close follow -up. 
- Severe: The adverse event interferes considerably with the subject’s usual activities. The event is of 
definite  concern  to the subject  and/or  poses  substantial  risk to the subject’s  health  or well-being.  The event 
is likely to require medical intervention and/or close follow -up and  may be incapacitating or life 
threatening. Hospitalization and treatment may be  required.  
The investigator must assess causality of AE in relation to study procedure or using of the study product as: 
unrelated, possible, and definite based on the following definition:  
- Unrelated: The AE is definitely not associated with the study  procedure  
- Possible:  There  is evidence  to suggest  the casual  relationship  between  the study  procedure  and the AE 
- Definite: The AE was caused by the study  procedure  
Reporting  of Adverse  Events  · The principal  investigator  will report  all AEs and SAEs  occurring  in clinical 
investigations to the IRB according to the UTHSC -Houston IRB  policy.  
 
9.3. Safety Monitoring  Plan 
Participants Safety  
- The potential  risks  to study  participants  include  very rare cardiovascular  adverse  events  including 
arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy. There is a possibility for a breach of  confidentiality.  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-21-1061 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/02/2022  
 
 - The potential  benefits  to study  participants  include  improved  visual  clarity,  shorter  operative  time,  and less 
frequent need for increased arthrosc opic irrigation pump pressure increases, which may result in less fluid 
extravasation into the surrounding soft tissue and less post -operative pain and analgesic  use. 
- Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Unanticipated Problems (UPs) will be 
identified  during  clinical  assessments  by the principal  investigator  and medical  team  and reported  to the 
study’s safety monitor for review and the IRB. Protection against Study  Risks  
- Informed consent will be provided both verbally and in written form to subjects. The consent process 
informs  a volunteer  about  the study,  indicates  the participation  is volun tary and he/she  has the right  to stop 
at any time. Risks are enumerated in the informed consent form and described orally during the consent 
process.  
- The procedures to protect against risks with participation in this study are minimized by a safe, hygienic  
environment  for all medical  procedures  and an experienced,  certified  staff performing  all procedures.  The 
risk of breach  of confidentiality  is minimized  by securing  all study  related  data and PHI behind  encrypted, 
password protected drives and  servers.  
UTHealth CTRC DSMP Checklist  
- Primary and secondary outcome  measures  
o Primary:  surgeon -rated  visual  clarity  score  (visual  analog  scale  0 to 10), changes  in intra-operative 
arthroscopic pump  pressure  
o Secondary:  mean  arterial  pressure  intra-operatively,  total operative  time,  adverse  events  intra- 
operatively or  post-operatively  
o Inclusion:  patients  18 years  of age or older  who are able to provide  informed  consent  and who are 
to undergo arthroscopic shoulder surgery in the seated upright (beach -chair) position re quiring 
visualization of within the subacromial  space.  
o Exclusion: Are unable to provide informed consent, non -English speaker, have a history of 
adverse  medication  reaction  to epinephrine,  and who are having  arthroscopic  shoulder  surgery  that 
does not require visualization within the subacromial space or performed in the lateral  position.  
o Sample  size: Thirty  (n=30)  subjects  recruited  from  Texas  will be sought  for each group  for a total 
enrollment of sixty (n=60). This is from a power analysis performed. The minimal clinically 
significant difference in visual acuity score (0 -10) is 2 points, or 20%, as established in a prior 
study. In order to ensure 80% power at an alpha of 0.05, a  minimum of 26 patients are needed in 
each study  group.

o Demographic  data (name,  age, gender,  weight,  race)  will be collected  from  medical  records  and 
stored in  Redcap.  
o Surgical  data (start  and stop times  for procedure,  type of procedure  performed,  mean  arterial 
pressure) will be recorded and stored in  Redcap.  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-21-1061 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/02/2022  
 
 o Objective  clinical  data (adverse  events)  will be collected  during  the post-operative  period  with 
information collected stored in  Redcap.  
o Subjective  clinical  data (surgeon -rated  visual  clarity  score,  surgeon -requested  increase  in 
arthroscopic irrigation pump pressure) will be recorded and stored in  Redcap . 
o Imaging data  (none)  
- Data entry  methods  
o A linking  log and data collection  form  will be used to protect  subjects’  PHI.  All data will be 
entered and stored in a Redcap project drive to ensure maximal security and  anonymity.  
- Data analysis  plan 
o Demographic variables and diagnostic outcomes will be compared using t -test for continuous 
variables  and chi-square  or Fisher  exact  test for categorical  variables.  A Mann -Whitney  rank sum 
test will be used to compare median visual clarity  scores.  
- Quality a ssurance  plan 
o To maintain accuracy, consistency and completeness of data, periodic audits and self -assessments 
will be conducted.  The data will be cross -checked  by the study  coordinator  and the PIs to maintain 
quality control.  
- Reporting mechanisms of AEs/SAEs to the IRB, FDA, and  NIDA  
o The principal investigator will report all AEs and SAEs occurring in clinical investigations to the 
IRB according  to the UTHSC -Houston  IRB policy.  A definition  of what  constitutes  an AE or SAE 
can be found below in this document as well as within the study  protocol.  
▪ AEs will be complied  and submitted  on an annual  basis  to the IRB.  Each  AE will require 
review from the investigator as soon as  identified.  
▪ SAEs  will be reviewed  by the investigator  as soon  as identified,  and all SAEs  will be 
reported to the IRB within 48 hours of  identification.  
- Reporting mechanisms of IRB actions to  NIDA  
o No drugs  are involved in  this study,  so reporting  to the NIDA  will not be necessary.  
- Report of changes or amendments to the  protocol  
o All requested  changes  or amendments  to the protocol  will be submitted  for IRB approval  prior  to 
enacting on any subjects previously or to be enrolled. These amendments will be logged and a 
comprehensive record of all protocol versions and amendments will be maintained by the 
investigators.  
- Trial stopping  rules 
o Up to discretion of  CTRC/IRB  
- Conflict  of interest  
o There are no conflicts of interest to report from any of the involved investigators on the  study  
- Potential risks and benefits for  participants  
o The potential  risks  to study  participants  include  very rare cardiovascular  adverse  events  including 
arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy. There is a possibility for a breach of  confidentiality.  
o The potential  benefits  to study  participants  include  improved  visual  clarity,  shorter  operative  time, 
and less frequent need for increased arthroscopic irrigat ion pump pressure increases, which may 
result in less fluid extravasation into the surrounding soft tissue and less post -operative pain and 
analgesic  use. 
- Collecting and reporting of AEs and  SAEs  
o Adverse  Events  (AEs),  Serious  Adverse  Events  (SAEs)  and Unanticipated  Problems  (UPs)  will be 
identified during clinical assessments by the principal investigator and medical team and reported 
to the study’s safety DSMB and the IRB for  review.  
- An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence a ssociated with the 
use of an investigational product in humans and that does not necessarily have a causal 
relation with the investigational product. AEs can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended  sign (including  an abnormal  laboratory  finding),  symptom,  or disease  temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational procedure or product, whether or not related to 
the investigational procedure or  product.  
- An adverse  event  is considered  “serious”  if, in the view  of the investigator,  it results  in any of 
the following  outcomes:  
o Led to  death  
o Led to serious deterioration in health of the subject, that either resulted  in

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/02/2022  
 
 ▪ A life -threatening illness or injury,  or 
▪ A permanent impairment of a body structure or function,  or 
▪ In-patient or prol onged hospitalization,  or 
▪ Medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent  life-threatening  illness  or injury 
or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body  function  
o Led to fetal distress, fetal death or congenital abnormality or birth defect,  or 
o Required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage,  or 
o Other  serious  events  that do not fit the other  outcomes,  but the event  may jeopardize 
the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention (treatment) to prevent 
one of the other  outcomes.  
- Management of SAEs or other study  risks  
o Within 48 hours of becoming aware of a SAE, the investigator must complete the SAE report 
(providing as much information as is immediately available). The investigator must submit this 
SAE  report  to the study’s safety  monitor.  The investigator  must  also report  all SAEs  to the IRB,  as 
is required by the  IRB.  
o Plans for Interim Analysis of efficacy  data 
o In conjunction  with the listed  Safety  Monitor  patient  reports  will be sent once  specific  numbers  of 
patients have been enrolled: 30 patients, 60  patients.  
- Responsibility for data and safety  monitoring  
o All investigators listed on the study will be responsible for upholding ethical and appropriate 
procedures and handling of subject data. Internal self -monitoring will be performed by the 
research  team  to ensure  only data listed  in the protocol  is collected,  and ensure  the accuracy  of the 
collected data. The principal investigator will ultimately be responsible for ensuring all safe 
handling of study related  information.  
- Frequency of DSM  reviews  
o Up to discretion of  CTRC/IRB

10. DATA  ANALYSIS  
10.1. Data Quality  Assurance  
To maintain accuracy, consistency and completeness of data, periodic audits and self -assessments will be conducted. 
The data will be cross -checked by the study coordinator and the PIs to mainta in quality control.  
 
10.2. Data Entry and  Storage  
All data will be entered and stored into a Redcap project drive to ensure maximal security and anonymity.  
 
11. SAMPLE SIZE AND STATISTICAL  METHODS  
11.1. Determination of Sample  Size 
Thirty (n=30) subjects recruited from Texas will be sought for each group for a total enrollment of sixty (n=60). 
This is from a power analysis performed. The minimal clinically significant difference in visual acuity score (0 -10) 
is 2 points, or 20%, as e stablished in a prior study. In order to ensure 80% power at an alpha of 0.05, 26 patients are 
needed in each study group. Minimal attrition is expected given that there is no routine follow -up necessary.  
 
11.2. Statistical  and Analytical  Plans  
Demographic varia bles and diagnostic outcomes will be compared using t -test for continuous variables and chi - 
square  or Fisher  exact  test for categorical  variables.  A Mann -Whitney  rank sum test will be used to compare  median 
visual clarity scores. In the case where a serio us medication -related adverse events occurs, we will also start an 
early analysis to determine the potential  causes.  
 
12. ETHICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1. Informed  Consent  
This study will obtain written informed consent prior to performing any study -related data collect ion. Research 
coordinators will obtain informed consent from the patient prior to administration of sedation. Consent will be 
obtained under the direction of Dr. James Gregory. In obtaining and documenting informed consent, we will ensure 
compliance with a ll GCP guidelines and standard ethical principles.  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-21-1061 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/02/2022  
 
 12.2. IRB review  
This protocol and the associated informed consent documents will be submitted to the IRB for review and approval.  
 
12.3. Confidentiality of Data and Patient  Records  
All study -related data will be de -identified and stored on a password -protected server within the Department of 
Orthopaedic Surgery, accessible only by study -specific personnel identified in this protocol. Records will be 
maintained for at least six years after study completion as per University Policy. Protected health information (PHI)

CONFIDENTIALProtocol Synopsis 
Title:   A Multicenter Double-Blind, Randomized Co ntrolled Study of Etanercept and Methotrexate 
in Combination or as Monotherapy in Subjects With Psoriatic Arthritis   
Study Phase:   Phase 3 
Indication:   Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) 
Primary Objective:   To evaluate the efficacy of etaner cept plus methotrexate therapy and 
etanercept monotherapy compared to methotrexate monotherapy, in subjects with PsA as 
measured by the proportion of subjects achieving an American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at week 24. 
Key Secondary Objective:  To evaluate the efficacy of etanercept plus methotrexate therapy 
and etanercept monotherapy compared to met hotrexate monotherapy as measured by the 
proportion of subjects achieving Minima l Disease Activity (MDA) at week 24. 
Other Secondary Objectives: 
To evaluate the efficacy of etanercept plus me thotrexate therapy and etanercept monotherapy 
compared to methotrexate monotherapy on the following:  
Other measures of arthritis activity
Measures of non-arthritic PsA disease activity
Key patient reported outcomes (PRO) related to physical function and quality of life
Safety Objectives: To evaluate the safety of etanercept and methotrexate
Hypotheses:   Primary:  Etanercept plus methotrexa te therapy and etanercept monotherapy are 
more efficacious than methotrexate monotherapy as  measured by the proportion of subjects with 
PsA achieving ACR 20 response at week 24. 
Secondary:  Etanercept plus methotrexate therapy and etanercept monotherapy are more 
efficacious than methotrexate as measured by the proportion of subjects with PsA achieving MDA 
response at week 24. Primary Endpoint:  ACR 20 response at week 24 
Key Secondary Endpoint:  MDA response at week 24  
Other Secondary Endpoints:  
Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (modified NAPSI) score and change from baseline at
week 24 
Leeds dactylitis score and change from baseline at week 24
Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) enthesitis score and change
from baseline at week 24
ACR 20 response at all other measured timepoints
MDA response at all other measured timepoints
Psoriatic Arthritis Disease Activity Sc ore (PASDAS) at all measured timepoints
ACR 50, ACR 70, and components of ACR at all measured timepoints
Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI)  and change from baseline at all measured
timepoints
Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and change from baseline at all measured timepoints

CONFIDENTIAL    • Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ -DI) score and change from 
baseline at week 24  
• Medical Outcomes Short Form -36 Questionnaire ( SF-36) score and change from baseline at 
week 24  
For subjects with involved body surface area (BSA)  ≥ 3% at baseline:  
• Static Physician Global Assessment of Psoriasis ( sPGA)  at week 24  
• BSA at week 24  
Safety Endpoints : 
• Adverse events  
• Serious adverse events  
• Laboratory parameters and vital signs 
Study Design:   This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind controlled study in subjects with 
PsA.  The study will consist of a 30- day screening period, a 48- week double- blind treatment 
period and a 30- day safety follow -up period.  Approximat ely 840 subjects will be randomly 
assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three treatment groups (280 per group):  etanercept 50 mg 
weekly by subcutaneous injection plus oral methotrexate 20 mg weekly, etanercept 50 mg weekly 
by subcutaneous injection plus oral placebo for methotrexate, and oral methot rexate 20 mg 
weekly plus placebo for etanercept.  Starting at week 24 visit, subjects who have an inadequate 
response will be provided rescue treatment of etanercept plus methotrexate for the remainder of 
the study. Original treatment assignments will remain blinded until all subjects reach the week 48 or early termination visit, whichever comes first.  
Sample Size:   Approximat ely 840 subjects will be enrolled  
Summary of Subject Eligibility Criteria:   Subjects must be adults with active PsA  based on the 
Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR)  who are naïve to etanercept and other 
biologics and have no prior use of methotrexate for the treatment of PsA.   Prior  treatment with 
methotrexate is allowed if indicated for psoriasis as long as discontinuation was not due to toxicity 
or intolerance and treatment was discontinued ≥ 6 months prior to baseline. For a full list of 
eligibility criteria, please refer to Secti on 4.1.1  through  Section 4.1.2 .  
Investigational Product  
Amgen Investigational Product Dosage and Administration:   Etanercept dosing in the 
planned study follows the recommended label dosing for subjects with PsA.  Etanercept will be 
provided as a 50 mg pre -filled syringe or matching placebo for injection once weekly for 
48 weeks.  See Sections 6.2.1 . 
Non- Amgen Investigational Product Dosage and Administration:   Methotrexate dosing will 
begin at a dose of 10 mg on day 1 and will be titrated up to 20 mg weekly  over a 4- week period . 
Methotrexate will be supplied as 2.5 mg capsules or as matching placebo capsules and will be 
taken once weekly by oral administration for 48 weeks.   For those subjects receiving rescue 
therapy, methotrexate will be dispensed as 2.5 mg tablets.  See Section 6.2.2 . 
Non- investigational Product  
Non- Amgen Non -investigational Product  Dosage and Administration:   Folic acid dosing will 
be 5 to 7 mg per week  as 1 mg daily per investigator judgment OR administration according to 
the local standard of care. See Section 6.3.1 . 
Procedures:   Written informed consent must be obtained from all subjects before any screening 
procedures are performed.  The following procedures will occur per the Schedule of 
Assessments:  medical and medication history, physical examination, physical  measures, vital 
signs, adverse event and concomitant medication assessment, tuberculosis testing, pregnancy testing, urinalysis, and blood draw for serum chemistry, hematology, hepatitis B and C testing,

CONFIDENTIAL    C-reactive protein and biomarkers, tender and swollen joint assessment and count, physician 
global assessment, Leeds dactylitis index, SPARCC enthesitis index, modified NAPSI, BSA, 
sPGA, radiographs  and PROs . For a full list of study procedures, including the timing of each 
procedure, please refer to Secti on 7 and the Schedule of Assessments  (Table  1). 
Statistical Considerations:   The primary analysis will occur after all data through week 48 is 
finalized.  The primary analysis of the primary and key secondary endpoints will be based on the full analysis set.  Treatment effect between etanercept plus methotrexate therapy and methotrexate monotherapy and between etanercept monotherapy and methotrexate monotherapy will be tested in a Bonferroni -based gatekeeping chain procedure to control the 
family -wise 2 -sided type one error rate at 0.05.  Between treatment comparisons will be made 
using the stratified Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test with baseline body mass index and prior 
non-biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drug ( DMARD ) use as the stratification factors.  All 
other efficacy endpoints will be tested at a significance level of 0.05 without adjusting for multiplicity.  Safety endpoints will be summarized descriptively based on the safety analysis set.  For a full description of statistical analysis methods, please refer to Section 10

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Disease 
PsA is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the peripheral joints and axial skeleton that 
occurs in 7
% to 34 % of patients with psoriasis (Scarpa et al, 1984; Biondi et al, 1989; 
Espinoza et al, 1992; Shbeeb et al, 2000), which in turn has a prevalence of 1 % to 3% in 
the general population ( Biondi et al, 1989; Koo, 1996).  Articular involvement can vary

Protocol Nu mber:  20130207  
Date:  31 August 2016  Page 15 of 76 
CONFIDENTIAL    widely from an isolated monoarthritis to a very destructive diffuse arthritis mutilans.  
Other symptoms associated with PsA include dactylitis, enthesitis, and nail changes.  Typical nail changes include pitting of the nail, onycholysis, ridges , and thickening of the 
nail.  Although most patients have associated psoriasis, PsA can present without skin changes.  Radiographic features include joint erosions, joint space loss, osteolysis that may cause penciling of the phalanx, and periostitis.  PsA can lead to permanent destruction of joints and functional disabil ities. 
2.2 Etanercept (Enbrel
®) Background 
Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF) is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal 
inflammatory and immune responses.  It plays a role in the inflammatory process of plaque psoriasis.  Elevated levels of TNF are found in involved tissues and fluids of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, PsA, ankylosing spondylitis, and plaque psoriasis.  Two distinct receptors for TNF, a 55 kilodalton protein (p55) and a 75 kilodalton protein (p75), exist naturally as monomeric molecules on cell surfaces and in soluble 
forms. Biological activity of TNF is dependent upon binding to either c ell surface 
TNF receptor.  Etanercept is a dimeric fusion protein consisting of the extracelluar 
ligand-binding portion of the human 75 kilodalton TNF  receptor linked to the Fc portion of 
human IgG1.  Etanercept inhibits binding of TNF-α and TNF- β (lymphotoxin alpha 
[LT-α ]) to cell surface TNF receptors , rendering TNF biologically inactive. 
In many countries, etanercept is indicated for reducing signs and symptoms, inhibiting the progression of structural damage of active arthritis, and improving physical function 
in patients with PsA.   
Etanercept is also indicated for the treatment of:  (1) moderately to severely active 
rheumatoid arthritis; (2) moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients aged 2 and older; (3) psoriatic arthritis; (4) active ankylosing 
spondylitis; and ( 5) adult patients with chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.  
Refer to the specific section of the Investigator’s Brochure or product label for additional information related to physical, chemical, and pharmaceutical properties and formulations. 
2.3 Non-Amgen Medicinal Product Background:  Methotrexate 
Methotrexate is an antimetabolite used in the treatment of certain neoplastic diseases, 
psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis .  Methotrexate or its metabolites inhibit dihydrofolic 
acid reductase and antagonize thymidylate synthase.  Methotrexate is thought to inhibit 
5-aminoimidazole 4-carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase which leads to an 
Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Nu mber:  20130207  
Date:  31 August 2016  Page 16 of 76 
CONFIDENTIAL    increase in both intracellular and extracellular adenosine.  Methotrexate is one of the 
most commonly used non-biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) in 
PsA.  Although the use of methotrexate is standard therapy in the medical community 
and it is mentioned in guidelines in the treatment of PsA, it is not an approved drug for 
the treatment of PsA in many countries . 
Refer to the regional manufacturer package insert for additional information. 
2.4 Rationale 
Etanercept has been approved for PsA by the FDA and Health Canada and is indicated 
for reducing the signs and symptoms, inhibiting the progression of structural damage of 
active arthritis , and improving physical function.  Etanercept can be used in combination 
with methotrexate in patients who do not respond adequately to methotrexate alone.  
Methotrexate is one of the most commonly used non-biologic DMARD in PsA as 
monotherapy or in combination therapy with other synthetic DMARDs or with biologic 
DMARDs.  Although methotrexate is commonly used in treating PsA, it is unclear how 
effecti ve it is in PsA.  The most recent randomized placebo- controlled trial of 
methotrexate in PsA is the Methotrexate in Psoriatic Arthritis (MIPA) study 
(Kingsley  et al, 2012).  This was a  6-month, double-blind, parallel -group study in  
methotrexate naïve subjects randomized to receive methotrexate (15 mg/wk; n =  109) or 
placebo (n =  112).  In an intent-to-treat analysis, there were no statistically significant 
improvements in measures of disease activity across groups at 24 weeks.  The odds 
ratios (95 % CI) for  Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria, ACR 20, and Disease activity 
score (28 joint) responders for the methotrexate and placebo groups were 1.77 (0.97, 
3.23; p = 0.06), 2.00 (0.65, 6.22; p = 0.23), and 1.70 (0.90, 3.17; p = 0.10), respectively.  
In a completer analysis, percent responders for methotrexate and placebo were 34 % and 
21% for ACR  20 respectively  for a difference of 13 %.  In the PsA pivotal trial, ACR 20 
response at week 24 was 50 % and 1 4% in the etanercept and placebo groups 
respectively  for a difference of 36 %.  Nevertheless, comparisons with the MIPA trial need 
to be qualified by the fact that the subjects in the etanercept pivotal trial were not 
uniformly methotrexate naïve.  Furthermore, in the MIPA trial the target dose of 
methotrexate was  15 mg QW, a less than maximal clinically used dose level . 
In rheumatoid arthritis, combining TNF inhibitors such as etanercept with methotrexate 
leads to superior efficacy relative to each agent used alone (Klareskog et al , 2004).  The 
role of methotrexate in combination with etanercept in PsA remains unclear. Analysis of 
Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Nu mber:  20130207  
Date:  31 August 2016  Page 17 of 76 
CONFIDENTIAL    data from 440 PsA patients in the Norwegian DMARD longitudinal observational study 
showed no consistent differences in response over a 12-month period between patients 
who started their TNF inhibitor as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate 
(Fagerli et al, 2014)  Similar findings were found in a United States registry  
(Mease  et al, 2013) .  No difference was found in reaching clinical disease activity index 
(CDAI ) low disease activity or staying in low disease activity on anti -TNF monotherapy 
vs. combination with methotrexate in this study  (Mease et al , 2013).  These data suggest 
key differences in the response of PsA patients compared to RA patients to 
methotrexate and highlight the importance of characterizing the role of etanercept as a monotherapy agent in PsA. 
A new disease activity state called MDA, has been developed and validated 
(Coates  et al, 2010a and Coates et al , 2010b).  MDA  represents a low disease activity 
state and would further the ‘treat-to- target’ approach in PsA.  The MDA criteria is specific 
for PsA and incorporates  measures of joint and entheseal inflammation, skin disease, 
PROs  and functional disability to assess the subject’s disease activity.  The results of  the 
validation analysis support the prognostic value of the PsA MDA criteria and show that 
subjects achieving MDA are more likely to have a better radiologic outcome 
(Antoni  et al, 2005a, Antoni et al, 2005b). 
This study will also aim to characterize the response rates of etanercept on enthesitis, 
dactylitis , and psoriatic nail changes.  The PRESTA trial , assesse d two different 
regimens of etanercept ( 50 mg twice weekly or 50 mg once weekly ) in subjects with 
psoriasis and PsA.  Etanercept 50 mg once weekly  resulted in a 70.0
% and 
81.3 % improvement from baseline in enthesitis at week 12 and 24 respectively.  
Similarly, improvement in dactylitis from baseline at weeks 12 and 24 were 78.4 % and 
84.8 %, respectively (Sterry et al, 2010).  There is a paucity of data regarding the efficacy 
of methotrexate monotherapy on dactylitis and enthesitis in patients with PsA.  A recent study looking at the effect of etanercept on the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) 
score at week 12 and 24 improved by 50
% and 72 %, respectively on a weekly dose of 
Enbrel of 50 mgs (Ortonne et al, 2013).  In another recent study comparing improvement 
in nail changes on methotrexate monotherapy compared to cyclosporine monotherapy , 
methotrexate demonstrated a 30% improvement at 12 weeks and a 54 % improvement at 
24 weeks in the NAPSI score  (Gümüşel et al, 2011).

CONFIDENTIAL    2.5 Clinical Hypotheses 
Primary:  Etanercept plus methotrexate therapy and etanercept monotherapy are more 
efficacious than methotrexate monotherapy as measured by the proportion of subjects 
with PsA achieving ACR 20 response at week 24. 
Secondary:  Etanercept plus methotrexate therapy and etanercept monotherapy are 
more efficacious than methotrexate as measured by the proportion of subjects PsA achieving MDA response at week 24. 
3. EXPERIMEN TAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design 
This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind controlled study in subjects with 
active PsA naïve to biologics and with no prior use of methotrexate for the treatment of 
PsA.  The study will consist of a 30- day screening per iod, a 48-week randomized 
double-blind treatment period, and a 30-day safety follow-up period. 
Approximately 840 subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of 
three treatment groups ( 280 per arm):  
• Etanercept 50 mg weekly by subcutaneous injection plus oral methotrexate 20 mg 
weekly  
• Etanercept 50 mg weekly by subcutaneous injection plus oral placebo for 
methotrexate   
• Oral methotrexate 20 mg weekly plus placebo for etanercept  
The overall study design is described by a study schema at the end of the 
protocol  synopsis section . 
The study endpoints are defined in Section 10.1.1.  
3.1.1 Rescue Therapy  
At or after week 24, subjects who have an inadequate response as defined in 
Section 3.1.2.  will receive rescue therapy with etanercept plus methotrexate until the end 
of the treatment period.  Prior to initiation of etanercept plus methotrexate rescue 
therapy subjects must complete the procedures outlined for the disease assessment visit 
as described in Section 7.2.5 and Table 1 . 
3.1.2 Inadequate Response 
Inadequate response is defined by having < 20
% improvement in their tender and < 20% 
in their swollen joint counts from baseline at or after week 24.  This will be calculated 
automatically based on the joint count.  Inadequate response may be assessed at a

CONFIDENTIAL    regularly scheduled visit or at a disease assessment visit as described in Section 7.2.5.  
All subjects that initiate rescue treatment must complete a disease assessment follow-up 
visit 4 weeks later to monitor for labs (see Section 7.2.5 and Table 1 ).  
Subjects randomized to the etanercept plus methotrexate arm that have an inadequate 
response will continue to receive the same treatment. 
3.2 Number of Sites 
Approximately 105 sites globally  will participate in the study.  Additional sites may be 
added if necessary. Sites that do not enroll subjects within 3 months of site initiation may 
be closed.  
3.3 Number of Subjects 
Participants in this clinical investigation shall be referred to as “subjects”.  
The number of subjects expected to be enrolled in the study is 840 .  There will be 
approximately 280 subjects per treatment arm.  
Sample size considerations are provided in Section 10.2.  
3.4 Replacement  of Subjects 
Subjects who are withdrawn or removed from treatment or the study will not be replaced. 
3.5 Estimated Study Duration 
3.5.1 Study Duration for Subjects 
The study will consist of up to a 30-day screening, a 48-week double-blind treatment 
period, and a 30-day safety follow -up period.  The maximal duration of trial participation 
for an individual subject is approximately 56 weeks including the screening and safety 
follow -up telephone call . 
3.5.2 End of Study  
End of study is defined as the time when the last subject is assessed or receives an 
intervention for evaluation in the study.

5. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
Before subjects begin participation in any study -specific activities/procedures, Amgen 
requires a copy of the site’s written institutional review board /independent ethics 
committee (IRB/IEC ) approval of the protocol, informed consent form, and all other 
subject information and/or recruitment material, if applicable (see Section 11.2).  All 
subjects must personally sign and date the informed consent form before 
commencement of study -specific activit ies/procedures. 
A subject is considered enrolled when the investigator decides that the subject has met 
all eligibility criteria.  The i nvestigator is to document this decision and date, in the 
subject’s medical record and in the enrollment CRF. 
Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Nu mber:  20130207  
Date:  31 August 2016  Page 24 of 76 
CONFIDENTIAL    Each subject who enters into the screening period for the study (defined as the point at 
which the subject signs the informed consent form ) receives a unique subject 
identification number before any study -related activities/procedures are performed.  The 
subject identification number, assigned by the Interactive Voice Response System 
(IXRS ),  will be used to identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be 
used on all study documentation related to that subject.  The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical study; it must not be 
changed after initial assignment, including if a subject is re- screened.  This number will 
not necessarily be the same as the randomization number assigned for the study. 
Subjects not meeting eligibility criteria are permitted to re-screen twice  
(see Section  7.2.1 and 7.2.2). 
5.1 Randomization/Treatment Assignment  
Subjects that meet all el igibility criteria will be randomized at baseline to receive 
etanercept plus methotrexate, etanercept plus placebo for methotrexate or methotrexate 
plus placebo for etanercept in a 1:1:1 ratio via IXRS .  Assignment to the treatment arms 
will be based on a computer generated randomization schedule prepared by Amgen 
before the start of the study.  Each randomized subject will receive a single, unique randomization number at randomization.  The randomization date is to be documented 
in the subject’s medical record and on the enrollment CRF.  
5.2 Site Personnel Access to Individual Treatment Assignments 
A subject’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the treatment is essential for the further management of the subject on this study .  In the 
event that a subject’s treatment assignment must be unblinded by the investigator the subject will not be allowed to receive any further investigational product.  Refer to the 
Investigational Product Instruction Manual  (IPIM) for a  description regarding how 
responsible pharmacists and investigators will access treatment information via IXRS  in 
the event that there is a need to break the treatment blind. 
Other than rescue therapy situations, in the event of inadvertent unblinding (ie, the blind 
was not intended to be broken as described above), the investigator should immediately 
notify Amgen.  Each scenario will be reviewed individually to determine if the impacted 
subject(s) are able to continue receiving investigational product.  
Unblinding at the study site for any other reason,  including the scenarios described 
above, will be considered a protocol deviation.  The investigator is strongly encouraged

reported on the electronic case report form (eCRF).  Subsequent doses of investigational product should resume on the original schedule.  If etanercept is to be 
taken the day of a study visit, it must be taken after the study visit has occurred (ie, at 
the subject’s location on the scheduled dose day). 
Injections of etanercept will be administered by the subject or a caregiver.  The individual 
administering the dose must demonstrate to the site staff that he or she is competent to 
correctly administer the subcutaneous doses.  The first dose of etanercept must be 
administered at the study site.  All subsequent doses will be administered at the subject’s location on the scheduled dose day.  Supplies of etanercept will be dispensed to subjects for administration at home.  The site will instruct the subject  in appropriate handling and storage of used and unused syringes and documentation of dosing in the 
subject diary.  The start date, quantity administered and box number of investigational 
product are to be recorded in each subject’s eCRF.  Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for the most recent safety information.  A link to the United States Prescribing Information can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
6.2.2 Non-Amgen Investigational Product:  Methotrexate 
Non-Amgen investigational product methotrexate  will also be used in this study.  
Methotrexate will be distributed using Amgen clinical trial drug distribution procedures.  
Methotrexate will be supplied as 2.5 mg methotrexate capsules or as matching placebo capsules.  For those subjects receiving rescue therapy, methotrexate will be dispensed as 2.5 mg tablets. 
Additional details regarding the product(s) are provided in the IPIM. 
6.2.2.1 Dosage, Administration, and Schedule 
Methotrexate dosing will be initiated at 10 mg weekly and will be titrated up to a final 
dose of 20 mg weekly over a 4-week period.  The treatment period for this study is 48 weeks.  Methotrexate will be provided as 2.5 mg capsules, or as placebo capsules, and will be taken once weekly by oral adminis tration.  Capsules should be swallowed 
whole.  Subjects will receive 1 dose of methotrexate or placebo per week (scheduled 
approximately 7 days apart) for 48 weeks.  Throughout the entire trial, administration of 
methotrexate or matching placebo should occur on the scheduled dose day; however, if unavoidable, it may be given earlier or later as long as the dose is not within 4 days of the next scheduled dose.  If the dosing window is missed, that dose should be skipped 
and the next dose should be resumed at the scheduled time.  The reason for the missed

start date, quantity administered, and bottle/package number of methotrexate is to be 
recorded on the subject’s diary and entered into the eCRF.  
6.2.2.2 Dosage Adjustments, Delays, Rules for Withholding or Restarting, 
Permanent Discontinuation 
Methotrexate (or placebo for methotrexate) will be initiated at a dosage of 10 mg weekly 
at week 0 (day 1) .  The dose will be increased by 2.5 mg weekly up to 20 mg over a 
4 week period.  In cases of typical methotrexate toxicities (eg, increased aspartate 
transaminase or alanine transaminase, or gastrointestinal adverse effects, sever e 
stomatitis ), the methotrexate dose may be reduced up to 10 mg weekly.  The reason for 
dose change of methotrexate is to be recorded on each subject’s eCRF. 
6.3 Non-investigational Product  
6.3.1 Non-Amgen Non-investigational Product:  Folic Acid 
Folic acid will be sourced by the site.  Additional details regarding the product are 
provided in the IPIM.  
6.3.2 Dosage, Administration, and Schedule 
The dose of folic acid will be 5 to 7 mg per week as  1 mg daily per investigator judgment 
OR administration according to the local standard of care.  The dose of folic acid may be 
adjusted OR folinic acid  (leucovorin)  can be added not to exceed 5 mg per week  in 
response to methotrexate related toxicity. 
6.4 Hepatotoxicity Stopping and Rechallenge Rules, Reporting, and 
Monitoring  
A United States Food and Drug Administration Guidance exists for drug-induced liver 
injury (DILI) (Guidance for Industry Drug-Induced Liver Injury:  Premarketing Clinical 
Evaluation, July 2009) .  This guidance is general for all investigational products, and its 
recommendations can be found in Appendix A. 
6.4.1 Hepatotoxicity Stopping and Rechallenge Rules

CONFIDENTIAL    6.9 Contraceptive Requirements 
Female Subjects  
Female subjects of child -bearing potential must agree to practice true sexual abstinence 
(refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a highly effective method of contraception 
during treatment and for an additional 6 months after the last dose of protocol required therapies.  
Contraceptive methods that achieve a failure rate less of less than 1
% per year when 
used consistently and correctly are considered highly effective and may include:  hormonal (combined estrogen and progestogen or progestogen only), contraception 
associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral , injectable, implantable, intravaginal, or 
transdermal route) , intrauterine device, i ntrauterine hormonal -releasing system , bilateral 
tubal occlusion, v asectomized partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of 
the female participant and the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success) , true sexual abstinence when this is in line with the preferred 
and usual lifestyle of the subject.  The reliability of sexual abstinence must be evaluated 
by the investigator and be the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. 
If a female subject is suspected of being pregnant, the protocol -required therapies must 
be stopped immediately and may not be resumed until absence of pregnancy  has been 
medically confirmed. Females not of child-bearing potential are defined as:  a ny female who has had a 
hysterectomy, OR bilateral salpingectomy, OR bilateral oophorectomy, OR are 
postmenopausal.  Postmenopausal women are those who have had no spontaneous menses for at least 2 years . 
Male Subjects 
Male subjects who have had a vasectomy and received medical assessment of surgical 
success or whose female partner has had a bilateral tubal occlusion are not required to 
use additional forms of contraception. 
Otherwise, male subjects with a partner of child- bearing potential must agree to practice 
true sexual abstinence (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a condom with 
spermicide (if spermicide is commercially available) during treatment and for an additional 6 months after the last dose of protocol required therapies.  The reliability of 
sexual abstinence must be evaluated by the investigator and be the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the subject.  
Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Nu mber:  20130207  
Date:  31 August 2016  Page 31 of 76 
CONFIDENTIAL    The female partner should also consider using an acceptable method of effective 
contraction such as:  hormonal, intrauterine device, i ntrauterine hormonal -releasing 
system , female barrier method (diaphragm, cervical cap, contraceptive sponge; a female 
condom is not an option because there is a risk of tearing when both partners use a condom). 
Male subjects with a pregnant partner must practice sexual abstinence or wear a 
condom to prevent exposure of the unborn child to methotrexate through semen. 
Unacceptable methods of b irth c ontrol for male and female subjects include b irth control 
methods that are considered unacceptable in clinical trials and include:  p eriodic 
abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, postovulation methods), w ithdrawal (coitus 
interruptus), spermicides only, and l actational amenorrhoea method. 
7. STUDY PROCEDURES  
Screening assessments and study procedures outlined in this section and in Table 1  can 
only be performed after obtaining informed consent.  This includes any discontinuation of 
the subject’s medication for the purpose of participation in this study. 
All on study visits should be scheduled from day 1 (date of the firs t dose of 
investigational product) on the study.  It is very important to attempt to perform study 
procedures and obtain samples at the precise timepoints stipulated below.  When it is 
not possible to perform the study visit at the exact timepoint, the visit may be performed 
within the acceptable visit window as defined in the visit-specific section below. 
With the exception of the screening and re-screen visits , and the radiographic 
assessments , all study procedures for a visit should be completed on the same day.  
Radiographs may be done within 
± 1 week of the visit date.  Any missed visits, tests not 
done, or examinations that are not conducted must be reported as such on the eCRFs.  
Subsequent study visits should resume on the original schedule.  Missed assessments at prior visits should not be duplicated at subsequent visits.  
Refer to the applicable supplemental laboratory manuals for detailed collection and 
handling procedures.

CONFIDENTIAL    7.2 General Study Procedures 
The procedures performed at each study visit are outlined above in Table 1 .  Details 
regarding each type of procedure are provided in subsequent sub-sections . 
Refer to the applicable supplemental central laboratory, IXRS , IPIM , and study manuals 
for detailed collection and handling procedures.  
7.2.1 Screening 
Informed consent must be obtained before completing any other screening procedure.  
After written informed consent is signed by the subject, the subject will be screened in order to assess eligibility for study participation.  The screening window is 30 days.  If a subject has not met all eligibility criteria at the end of the 30- day window, the subject will 
be registered as a screen fail.  Abnormal laboratory assessments used to determine 
subject eligibility may be repeated once during the primary screening period before the 
subject is considered a screen failure.  At screening if the subject is positive for 
hepatitis B core antibody, the confirmatory reflex testing will be performed using 
hepatitis B virus (HBV ) DNA polymerase chain reaction ( PCR).  Subjects  who screen 
fail may be eligible to re -screen two additional times per Section 7.2.2.  
7.2.2 Re-screening 
Subjects who are unable to complete or meet all eligibility criteria on initial screening will 
be permitted to re-screen two additional times after the first screening visit failure.   
Re-screen subjects must first be registered as screen failed in IXRS  and subsequently 
registered as a re-screen subject.  Once the subject is registered as re- screened, a new 
30-day screening window will begin. 
If the re-screening period begins more than 30 days after the original signing of the 
informed consent form, all screening procedures, including informed consent must be repeated.  If the re-screening occurs within 30 days after the original signing of the informed consent, only those criteria that were originally not met would be required to be 
repeated.  Subjects who screen fail for not meeting inclusion criterion 106 or  111 are not 
permitted to re-screen.  
7.2.3 Baseline Visit (Day 1)  
Subjects meeting all eligibility criteria will be randomized by IXRS  as described in 
Section 5 .  The date of first dose of blinded investigational product is defined as 
day 1 week 0.  All subsequent doses and study visits will be scheduled based on the 
Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Number:  2 0130207  
Date:  31 August 2016  Page 35 of 76 
CONFIDENTIAL    day 1 date.  Following the first blinded dose, investigational products and related 
supplies will be dispensed to the subject for self -administration per  Table 1 . 
7.2.4 Treatment  
Visits will occur per the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1 ) during the treatment period 
from day 1 until week 48.  On-study visits may be completed within ± 7 days of the target 
visit date.  The procedures completed during the 48-week treatment period are those 
listed in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ).  Administration of investigational 
product is to be administered after all other study procedures, as applicable, during each visit that is required.  
7.2.5 Disease Assessment Visit  and Disease Assessment Follow -up Visit  
Subjects can be seen at any time at or after week 24 to assess disease activity to 
evaluate if a subject can receive rescue treatment due to inadequate response to 
treatment.  If a subject meets the criteria for inadequate response as defined in 
Section 3.1.2,  he/she will initi ate rescue treatment with etanercept (50 mg QW) plus  
methotrexate (titrated up to 20 mg QW).  Sites will register the requirement for rescue in 
the IX RS for assignment of rescue therapy.  Refer to the IPIM for additional details.  
Subjects will continue to receive etanercept plus methotrexate for the remaining study 
visits per  Table 1 .  The procedures completed during the Disease Assessment visit are 
listed in the Schedu le of Assessments ( Table 1 ).  Subjects who initiate rescue treatment 
must complete a Disease Assessment Follow -up visit 4 to 5 weeks later to complete all 
the procedures listed in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). 
7.2.6 Subject End of Treatment/Early Termination 
Subjects will complete an end of treatment visit at week 48 within a window of 
± 7 days 
of the target visit date (see Table 1 ).  Subjects ending the study prior to week  48 will be 
asked to complete an Early Termination visit.  
7.2.7 Safety Follow -up/End of Study  
Approximately 30 days, within a window of + 7 days of the target visit date, after the last dose of investigational products, subjects will be contacted by phone by the site staff to 
collect any serious adverse events (refer to Section 9).

IEC/IRB approved informed consent before any study -specific procedures are 
performed. See Section 11.1 for further details.  
7.3.2 Demographic Data 
Demographic data collection including sex, age, race, and ethnicity will be collected in 
order to study their possible association with subject safety and treatment effectiveness.  
Additionally , demographic data will be used to study the impact on biomarker variability 
of the protocol -required therapies.  
7.3.3 Medical History  
The subject ’s full PsA history and other significant medical history should be recorded 
starting at the time of the original diagnosis.  Other relevant medical and surgical history 
that started within 5 years  and information on the subject’s concurrent medical 
conditions  will be recorded. Record all findings on the medical history eCRF. 
7.3.4 Medication History 
The subject’s full history of psoriasis and PsA medications starting at the time of 
diagnosis and up to screening will be recorded on the eCRF.  This information will 
include the subject’s non-biologic DMARDs, NSAIDs , corticosteroids , biologics , and 
inves tigational medication history.  For PsA medications, the following information will be

CONFIDENTIAL    7.3.7 Vital Signs 
The following measurements must be performed:  systolic and diastolic blood pressur e, 
heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature.  Subject must be in a supine position in a 
rested and calm state for at least 5 minutes before blood pressure assessments are 
conducted.  If the subject is unable to be in the supine position, the subject should be in 
the most recumbent position as possible.  The position selected for a subject should be 
the same that is used throughout the study and documented on the vital sign eCRF.  The body region used to assess temperature for a subject should remain consistent throughout the study and documented on the vital signs e CRF.  If abnormalities are 
found and they are considered an adverse event, record on the adverse event summary 
page. 
7.3.8 PsA Disease Assessments 
All joint assessments will be performed by an experienced assessor who has been 
certified and trained by Amgen.  Each subject should have their assessments done by 
the same assessor throughout the study, if possible.  If necessary, study visits may be 
rescheduled within the allowed window period per visit in order to accommodate when 
the same assessor will be available.  
7.3.8.1 Swollen/Tender Joint Counts 
All joint assessments will be performed by an experienced assessor  who has been 
trained by  viewing Amgen ’s Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and 
Psoriatic Arthritis  (GRAPPA) training module and must be identified on the delegation of 
authority for this responsibility .  The user ID  of the joint assessor will be recorded at each 
assessment .  The score for each joint will be recorded directly into the el ectronic 
PRO  tablet which will serve as the source documentation and will not be transposed to 
the eCRF .  Joints that have been replaced are considered inevaluable. 
Swollen Joint Count Assessments – A total of 66 joints will be scored for presence or 
absence of swelling.  
Tender Joint Count Assessments – A total of 68 joints will be scored for presence or 
absence of tenderness.  
7.3.8.2 Leeds Dactylitis Index  
Assessment will be performed by the same assessor as the joint counts.  The assessor 
will be trained by viewi ng the GRAPPA training module to perform the Leeds Dactylitis 
measurement. 
Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Number:  2 0130207  
Date:  31 August 2016  Page 38 of 76 
CONFIDENTIAL    The assessor will assess all fingers and toes for tenderness in the area between the 
joints and will score each on a scale of 0 to 3 where 0 = not tender; 1 = tender; 
2 = tender and wince; 3 = tender and withdraw.  Using a Leeds dactylometer , the 
circumference of only the tender digits and their contralateral counterpart will be 
measured and reported on the eCRF . 
7.3.8.3 Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada Enthesitis Index 
Assessment will be performed by the same assessor as the joint counts.  The assessor 
will be trained by viewing the GRAPPA training module to perform the Spondyloarthritis 
Research Consortium of Canada ( SPARCC) enthesitis assessment.   The SPARCC 
enthesitis index  assesses enthesitis at 18 sites with a resultant score of 0 to 16.  
Tenderness at each site is assessed as 0 = non-tender or 1 = tender. Entheses 
assessed are left and right medial and lateral epicondyles, supraspinatus insertion into 
greater tuberosity of humerus, greater trochanter, quadriceps insertion into superior 
border of patella, patellar ligament insertion into inferior pole of patella, tibial tubercle, 
Achilles tendon insertion into calcaneum  and bilateral plantar fascia inserti on into the 
calcaneum .  Higher count represents greater enthesitis burden.  Tenderness at the 
inferior pole of patella and/or tibial tubercle will be scored as a maximum score of 1. 
7.3.8.4 Radiographs 
Radiographs  of bilateral hands and feet will be taken in the required views:  
posterior/anterior for the hands and anterior/posterior for the feet.  Radiographs will be 
done locally and read centrally. 
The central imaging vendor will measure using the van der Heijde mTSS  method for 
PsA.  This method is based on the Sharp-van der Heijde method for assessing erosions 
and joint space narrowing of the hands and feet in RA  and is adapted for evaluation of 
PsA by including the distal interph alangeal joints of the hand and scoring not only for 
erosions and joint space narrowing but also for subluxation, ankylosis, gross osteolysis , 
and pencil in cup phenomena.  Erosions are scored from 0 to 3 in each joint and joint 
space narrowing is scored from 0 to 4 at each joint and includes assessment for 
ankylosis.  G ross osteolysis and pencil in cup are scored separately.  The maximum 
possible total score is 528.  The radiographs will be read at a central location by two 
independent readers.

CONFIDENTIAL    7.3.9 Psoriasis Disease Assessments 
7.3.9.1 Static Physician Global Assessment of Psoriasis 
The assessor who conducts the tender and swollen joint counts will be trained and 
certified by GRAPPA training module to perform the Static Physician G lobal Assessment 
of Psoriasis (sPGA).  The sPGA is designed to evaluate the physician’s global 
assessment of the subject’s psoriasis based on severity of induration, scaling, and 
erythema.  The sPGA is assessed on a scale of 0 (clear) to 5 (severe) . 
7.3.9.2 Body Surface Are a Involvement 
The assessor who conducts the tender and swollen joint counts will be trained and 
certified by GRAPPA training modul e to perform the assessment for involved b ody 
surface area (BSA).  BSA is a numerical score (0 to 100) used to measure the proportion 
of the subject’s total BSA involvement with psoriasis.  
7.3.9.3 Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index 
The assessor who conducts the tender and swollen joint counts will be trained and 
certified by GRAPPA to perform the modified NAPSI assessment.  The modified NAPSI 
scale is an objective, numeric, and reproducible grading system for nail psoriasis that 
incorporates the many different features of nail psoriasis.  For assessments in this study (including selection of the target nail), a nail is graded on the following 8 clinical features and the modified NAPSI score results. 
• pitting (scores 0-3, depending on the number of pits)  
• nail plate crumbling (scores 0-3, depending on % of nail involvement)  
• onycholysis  and oil drop discoloration considered together  (scores 0 -3, depending on 
% of nail involvement)  
• leukonychia (0 or 1 – absent or present)  
• red spots in lunula (0 or 1 – absent or present)  
• nail bed hyperkeratosis (0 or 1 – absent or present)  
• splinter hemorrhages (0 or 1 – absent or present)  
In randomized subjects with nails involved with psoriasis, each finger nail will be scored 
at baseline to determine the wors t nail (ie, the nail with the highest modified NAPSI 
score ); this  nail will be followed for the remainder of the study.  If multiple nails have the 
same worst score, only 1 target nail will be followed.  Identify the selected nail  in the 
source document and eCRF, if applicable.

CONFIDENTIAL    7.3.9.4 Phy sician Global Assessment of D isease Activity  
This assessment will be completed by either the joint assessor or the prin cipal 
investigator (PI) for the study  by completion of a visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS is 
100 mm in length with “0” and “No Activity  at All” on the left end of the line and “100 ” and 
“Worst Activity Imaginable” at the right end of the line.  The subject and joint assessor or 
PI for the study  must complete the global assessments independently from each other. 
7.3.10 Patient Reported Outcomes 
PRO assessments should be completed first (before other study procedures and 
administration of study medication) at each visit where they are required. 
7.3.10.1 Patient Global Assessment of Joint Pain 
The severity of the subject’s joint pain will be assessed by completion of a VAS. The 
horizontal line is 100 mm in length with “0” and “no pain at all ” on the left end of the line 
and “100” and “worst pain imaginable” on the right end of the line.  This questionnaire 
should take approximately 1 minute to complete. 
7.3.10.2 Patie nt Global Assessment of Disease Activity 
The subject’s global assessment of their arthritis disease activity will be assessed by 
completion of a VAS.  The horizontal line is 100 mm in length with “0” and “No arthritis 
activity at all” on the left end of the line and “100 ” and “Worst arthritis a ctivity imaginable” 
on the right end of the line.  The subject and physician must complete the global 
assessments independently from each other.  This questionnaire should take 
approximately 1 minute to complete. 
7.3.10.3 Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire 
The Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire ( HAQ -DI) will be utilized to 
assess the subject’s physical function or disability according to the subject.  The HAQ -DI 
asks about the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional 
areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and errands and 
chores).  Responses in each functional area are scored from 0 indicating no difficulty to 
3 indicating inability to perform a task in that area.  The study staff should not clarify any 
of the questions for the subject. This questionnaire should take approximately 5 minutes to complete. 
7.3.10.4 Medical Outcomes Short Form -36 Questionnaire 
The Medical Outcomes Short Form- 36 Questionnaire ( SF-36) is a 36-item instrument 
that measures general health status.   It includes 8 multi -item scales, each of which

of health problems; 2) limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional 
problems; 3) limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems; 
4) bodily pain; 5) general mental health (psychological distress and well -being); 
6) limitations in usual  role activities because of emotional problems; 7) vitality (energy 
and fatigue); and 8) general health perceptions .  The SF-36 assesses the subject’s 
perception of health status over the previous month and takes about 15 minutes to complete.  
7.4 Laboratory Assessments 
All screening and on-study laboratory samples will be processed and sent to the central 
laboratory with the exception of urine pregnancy, PPD, and Quantiferon (may be done by central or local laboratory).  The central laboratory will be responsible for all screening 
and on-study serum chemistry, hematology, serum pregnancy, urinalysis, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and any other laboratory tests required.  U rine pregnancy and PPD 
testing, if applicable, will be performed locally with kits provided by the central laboratory (except PPD).  The results of this testing will be maintained in the source documents at 
the site.  Amgen or designee will be responsible for biomarker development and 
pharmacogenetic assessments, and the central laboratory will ship the samples to 
Amgen or a specialty laboratory for assay (depending on the assessment).  The central 
laboratory will provide a study manual that outlines handling, labeling, and shipping 
procedures for all samples.  All blood samples will be obtained by venipuncture before 
investigational product administration.  The date and time of sample collection will be 
recorded in the source documents at the site.  Specific analytes for serum chemistry, 
hematology, C-reactive protein, urinalysis, and other testing to be conducted on blood 
and urine samples are listed below ( Table 2 ).

CONFIDENTIAL    7.4.2 Urine Pregnancy Test  
Urine pregnancy tests will be performed locally at each site.  The central laboratory will 
provide the urine pregnancy tests on visits where required.  Urine pregnancy tests must 
be given prior to dispensing investigational product.  If a urine pregnancy test is positive, 
investigational product must be held; if pregnancy is confirmed, then investigational 
product must be discontinued. 
7.5 Biomarker Development  
Biomarkers are objectively measured and evaluated indicators of normal biologic 
processes, pathogenic pr ocesses, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic 
intervention.  Biomarker development can be useful in developing markers to identify disease subtypes, guide therapy, and/or predict disease severity. 
Amgen may attempt to develop test(s) designed to identify subjects most likely to 
respond positively or negatively to etanercept and/or methotrexate.  Biomarker development may be pursued by use of advanced biochemical analyses, such as proteomic methods or ribonucleic acid transcript profiling.  A cell pel let from the blood 
plasma tube may be utilized to assess the impact of etanercept and/or methotrexate on 
circulating immune cells via deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation analysis, a pharmacodynamic assessment of methylation patterns of relevant genes.  The DNA 
extracted will not be used for optional pharmacogenetic analyses unless the subject signs the additional consent. 
7.6 Pharmacogenetic Studies 
If the subject consents to the optional pharmacogenetic portion of this study, DNA 
analyses may be performed.  These optional pharmacogenetic analyses focus on 
inherited genetic variations to evaluate their possible correlation to the disease and/or 
responsiveness to the therapies used in this study.  The goals of the optional studies 
include the use of genetic markers to help in the investigation of PsA and/or to identify 
subjects who may have positive or negative response to Amgen and non -Amgen 
investigational product. No additional samples are collected for this part of the study.  For subjects who consent to this/these analysis/analyses, DNA may be extracted. 
7.7 Sample Storage and Destruction 
Any blood sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ) can be 
analyzed for any of the tests outlined in the protocol and for any tests necessary to 
minimize risks to study subjects.  This includes testing to ensure analytical methods 
produce reliable and valid data throughout the course of the study.  This can also

CONFIDENTIAL    include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample 
reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and comparability.  
All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for 
analysis or storage.  Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is assigned to 
the samples for the study.  Results are stored in a secure database to ensure confidentiality.  
If informed consent is provided by the subject, Amgen can do additional testing on 
remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) to investigate and better understand 
inflammatory conditions,  the dose response and/or prediction of response to etanercept 
or methotrexate, and characterize aspects of the molecule (eg, mechanism of 
action/target, metabolites).  Results from this analysis are to be documented and maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part of this study.  Samples can be 
retained for up to 20 years. 
Since the evaluations are not expected to benefit the subject directly or to alter the 
treatment course, the results of pharmacogenetic, biomarker development, or other exploratory studies are not placed in the subject’s medical record and are not to be 
made available to the subject, members of the family, the personal physician, or other 
third parties, except as specified in  the informed consent.  
The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by contac
ting the investigator.  Following the request from the subject, the investigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining 
blood samples and any other components from the cells can be located and destroyed.  
Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are completed.  
However, information collected from samples prior to the request for destruction, will be retained by Amgen.  
The sponsor
 is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the request of the subject through the investigator, at the end of the storage period, or as appropriate (eg, the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type no longer justifies keeping the sample).  If a commercial product is developed from this 
research project, the sponsor owns the commercial product.  The subject has no 
commercial rights to such product and has no commercial rights to the data, information,

Section 11.3 for subject confidentiality.  
8. WITHDRAWAL FROM TREATMENT, PROCEDURES, AND STUDY  
8.1 Subject s’ Decision to Withdraw  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to their  future medical care by the physician or at the institution.  
Subjects can decline to continue receiving investigational product and/or other 
protocol -required therapies or procedures at any time during the study  but continue 
participation in the study.  If this occurs, the investigator is to discuss with the subject the 
appropriate processes for discontinuation from investigational product or other 
protocol -required therapies and must discuss with the subject the options for 
continuation of the Schedule of Assess ments  (Table 1 ) and collection of data, including 
endpoints and adverse events.  The i nvestigator  must document the change to the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table 1 ) and the level of follow -up that is agreed to by the 
subject ( eg, in person, by telephone/mail, through family/friends, in 
correspondence/communication with other physicians, from review of the medical records ). 
Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive 
further protocol -required therapies or procedures , and the subject does not wish to or is 
unable to continue further study participation.  Su bject data up to withdrawal of consent 
will be included in the analysis of the study , and where permitted, publically available 
data can be included after withdrawal of consent.  The investigator is to discuss with the 
subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study.  The data generated may potentially  not be included in the subject’s study data, except in the case of a possibly 
related serious adverse event, where data will be collected.  
8.2 Investigator or Sponsor Decision to Withdraw  or Terminate 
Subjects’ Participation Prior to Study Completion 
The i nvestigator and/or sponsor can decide to withdraw a subject(s) from investigational 
product and/or other protocol -required therapies, protocol procedures , or the study as a 
whole at any time prior to study completion. 
Subjects may be eligible for continued treatment with Amgen investigational product(s) and/or other protocol -required therapies by a separate protocol or as provided for by the 
local country’s regulatory mechanism, based on parameters consistent with Section 12.1.

assessments include  any of the following: 
• subject request 
• safety concern (eg, due to an adverse event, ineligibility d etermined, protocol 
deviation, non-compliance, requirement for alternative therapy, pregnancy)  
• death 
• lost to follow -up 
• decision by sponsor  (other than subject request, safety concern, death or lost to 
follow -up) 
• disease flare requiring treatment not allowed in the protocol (eg, c olitis, asthma)  
8.3.2 Reasons for Removal F rom Study  
Reasons for removal of a subject from the study  are: 
• decision by sponsor  
• withdrawal of consent from study  
• death 
• lost to follow -up 
9. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING  
9.1 Adver se Events 
9.1.1 Definition of Adverse Events 
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial 
subject.  The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment.  The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any adverse events observed by the 
investigator or reported by the subject are recorded in the subject’s medical record.  
The definition of adverse events includes  worsening of a pre-existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre-exist ing medical condition (eg, diabetes, migraine 
headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration, and/or has an association with a significantly worse outcome.  A pre-existing condition that has not worsened during the study or involves  an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery 
or a medical procedure while on-study , is not considered an adverse event. 
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject, or subject’s legally acceptable representative requests to withdraw from protocol -required therapies  
Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Number:  2 0130207  
Date:  31 August 2016  Page 47 of 76 
CONFIDENTIAL    or the study due to an adverse event, refer to Section 8.1 for additional instructions on 
the procedures recommended for safe withdrawal from protocol -required therapies or 
the study. 
9.1.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of the 
following serious criteria:  
• fatal 
• life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)  
• requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other medically important serious event  
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization”, if the event necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay). 
If an i nvestigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the 
criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, DILI (see Appendix  A for 
DILI reporting criteria), or events that necessitate an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.  
9.2 Reporting of A dverse Events 
9.2.1 Reporting Procedures for Adverse Event s That d o not Meet Serious 
Criteria  
The i nvestigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by the 
investigator  or reported by the subject that occur after first dose of investigational 
product(s) through the end of treatment period a re reported using the applicable CRF 
(eg, Adverse Event Summary).  
The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  
• Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms), 
• Dates of onset and resolution (if res olved) , 
• Severity (and/or toxicity per protocol ), 
• Assessment of relatedness to investigational product(s) and 
• Action taken. 
Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Number:  2 0130207  
Date:  31 August 2016  Page 48 of 76 
CONFIDENTIAL    The adverse event grading scale used will be the Common Toxicity Criteria Version 4.  
The grading scale used in this study is described in Appendix  A.  The investigator must 
assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to the investigational product(s).  
This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  Is there a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product(s)? 
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a cl inically 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory 
findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be 
recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment 
or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable, 
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse 
event. 
The Investigator is expected to follow reported a dverse events  until stabilization or 
reversibility. 
If the severity of an adverse event changes from the date of onset to the date of 
resolution, record as a single event with the worst severity on the Adverse Event Summary CRF. 
9.2.2 Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by 
the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after signing of the informed 
consent through 30 days after the last day of the dos ing interval of inves tigational 
product(s) are recorded in the subject’s medical record and are submitted to Amgen.   All 
serious adverse events must be submitted to Amgen within 24 hours following the 
investigator’s knowledge of the event via the applicable e CRF.  
After the protocol -required reporting period defined above, the investigator does not 
need to actively monitor subjects for serious adverse events.  However, if the investigator becomes aware of a serious adverse event after this protocol -required 
reporting period, the investigator will report the event to Amgen within 24 hours following 
the investigator’s knowledge of the event.  Serious a dverse events reported outside of 
the protocol -required reporting period will be captured within the safety database as 
clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited reporting.

CONFIDENTIAL    If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site staff to report the 
serious adverse event, the information is to be reported to Amgen via an eSAE 
Contingency Report Form within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event. 
See Appendix  B for a sample of the Serious Adverse Event Worksheet/eSAE 
Contingency Report Form.  For EDC studies  where the first notification of a Serious  
Adverse Event is reported to Amgen via the eSAE Contingency Report Form, the data 
must be entered into the EDC system when the system is again available. 
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to 
any study -mandated activity or procedure.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have 
been caused by a study activity/procedure?” 
The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events until stabilization 
or reversibility.  
New information relating to a previously reported serious adverse event must be 
submitted to Amgen.   All new information for serious adverse events must be sent to 
Amgen within 24 hours following knowledge of the new information.  The investigator  
may be asked to provide additional follow -up information, which may include a discharge 
summary or extracts from the medical record.  Information provided about the serious adverse event must be consistent with that recorded on the applicable e CRF 
(eg, Adverse Event Summary CRF). 
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapies because of a 
serious adverse event, this information must be submitted to Amgen.  
To comply with worldwide reporting regulations for serious adverse events, the treatment assignment of subjects who develop serious, unexpected, and related adverse events may be unblinded by Amgen before submission to regulatory authorities.  Investigators 
will receive notification of related serious adverse event reports sent to regulatory authorities in accor dance with local requirements. 
Amgen will report serious adverse events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions as required to regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and IRBs/IECs 
in compliance with all reporting requirements according to local regulations and GCP .  
The investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB/I EC of serious adverse events occurring 
at the site and other adverse event reports received from Amgen, in accordance with local procedures and statutes.

CONFIDENTIAL    9.3 Pregnancy and Lactation Reporting 
If a pregnancy occurs in a female subject, or female partner of a male subject, while the 
subject is taking protocol -required therapies  report the pregnancy to Amgen as specified 
below . 
In addition to reporting any pregnancies occurring during the study, investigators should 
monitor for pregnancies that occur through 4 weeks after the last dose of  etanercept. 
The pregnancy should be reported to Amgen’s global Pregnancy Surveillance Program  
within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event of a pregnancy.  Report a 
pregnancy on the Pregnancy Notification Worksheet (Appendix  C).  The Pregnancy 
Surveillance Program w ill seek to follow the pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy 
and her baby up to 12 months after birth. 
If a lactation case occurs while the female subject is taking protocol -required therapies 
report the lactation case to Amgen as specified below.  
In addition to reporting a lactation case during the study, investigators should monitor for 
lactation cases that occur through 4 weeks after the last dose of etanercept. 
Any lactation case should be reported to Amgen’s global Lactation Surveillance Program 
within 24 hours  of the investigator’s knowledge of event.  Report a lactation case on the 
Lactation Notification Worksheet (Appendix  C).

Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Number:  2 0130207  
Date:  31 August 2016  Page 52 of 76 
CONFIDENTIAL    10.1.2.2 Psoriasis Efficacy Analysis Set

10.1.3 Covariates and Subgroups 
The following covariates will be considered to assess their influence on the primary and key secondary endpoints: 
• Age (
≤ 65, >  65) 
• Sex (male, female)

• Baseline BSA ( ≤ 3%, > 3%) 
• Prior use of non-biologic DMARD (yes, no)  
• Disease duration ( ≤ median, > median) 
Subgroup analyses, which would be considered exploratory, may be performed if an 
examination of the above covariates suggests that any treatment difference for the 
prima ry and secondary endpoints depends on any baseline covariates. 
10.2 Sample Size Considerations 
A total of 840 subjects will be enrolled in the study and randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 
etanercept plus methotrexate therapy, etanercept monotherapy  and methotrexate 
monotherapy.  
To preserve the family -wise 2 -sided type one error rate at 0.05 for the multiple 
comparisons of the etanercept plus methotrexate therapy and etanercept monotherapy 
groups with methotrexate monotherapy , a Bonferroni -based gatekeeping chain 
procedure ( Burman et al , 2009 and Millen et al , 2011) will be used to determine 
statistical significance for the primary and key secondary endpoints as described in 
Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Number:  2 0130207  
Date:  31 August 2016  Page 53 of 76 
CONFIDENTIAL    Section 10.5.2.   This procedure will split alpha of 0.05 equally to test in parallel the 
primary and key secondary endpoints  (ACR 20, MDA)  for etanercept plus methotrexate 
therapy vs. methotrexate monotherapy and etanercept monotherapy vs. methotrexate 
monotherapy sequentially within each parallel path.  If one of the parallel paths rejects 
both hypotheses sequentially, and the other parallel path has at least one hypothesis not 
rejected, then unspent alpha of 0.025 from the successful path will be propagated to the hypotheses in the other path to re-test them sequentially at a level of 0.05. 
The sample size is based on the adequacy to evaluate the efficacy of etanercept monotherapy compared with methotrexate monotherapy as measured by the primary 
endpoint of ACR 20 response at week 24 at a significance level of 0.025 based on the Bonferroni -based gatekeeping chain procedure. 
There are no published studies of etanercept monotherapy versus methotrexate 
monotherapy for the treatment of PsA.  Therefore for the purpose of this study the  
assumed response rates for ACR 20 for the etanercept monotherapy and methotrexate 
monotherapy arms are derived from separate studies.  In the etanercept PsA pivotal 
phase 3 study (20021630 Study) the ACR 20 response rate at week 24 was 50
% for the 
etanercept arm.  However, subjects were allowed to be on a stable dose of methotrexate at study entry.  Assuming a methotrexate naïve population would respond better, the response rate for the etanercept monotherapy arm in this planned phase 3 study is assumed to be 60
%. 
In a recent randomized placebo-controlled trial of methotrexate monotherapy in PsA 
(Kingsley et al , 2012) the ACR 20 response rate for the methotrexate monotherapy arm 
was 34%.  However, the dose of methotrexate was 15 mg QW.  Assuming a higher dose 
of methotrexate (ie, 20 mg QW) would yield better responses, the response rate for the 
methotrexate monotherapy arm in this planned phase 3  study is assumed to be 44 %. 
Therefore, in order to detect a difference of 16% between the etanercept monotherapy 
and methotrexate monotherapy arms, using a two-sided Chi -square test at a significance 
level of 0.025 and 90 % marginal power, each treatment arm will have approximately 
280 subjects adjusting for an anticipated 10 % dropout. 
This sample size will provide marginal power > 90% to detect a treatment difference in 
ACR 20 response at week 24 between the etanercept plus methotrexate therapy  arm 
and the methotrexate monotherapy arm at a two -sided 0.025 significance level.  As 
previously mentioned, the ACR response rate at week 24 is assumed to be 44 % for the 
Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Number:  2 0130207  
Date:  31 August 2016  Page 54 of 76 
CONFIDENTIAL    methotrexate monotherapy arm.  The ACR response rate at week 24 for the etanercept 
plus methotrexate therapy  arm is assumed to be 5 % higher than the etanercept 
monotherapy arm (ie, 65%).  This is based on a longitudinal observational study 
assessing the role of TNF-inhibitor plus methotrexate combination therapy versus TNF-inhibitor monotherapy (Fagerli et al, 2014 ). 
In addition, this sample size will provide marginal power >  90
% to detect treatment 
differences in MDA response at week 24 between both etanercept arms and the methotrexate arm at a two-sided 0.025 significance level, assuming response rates of 15
%, 30%, and 35 % for the methotrexate monotherapy, etanercept monotherapy, and 
etanercept plus methotrexate therapy arms, respectively.  In recent PsA trials, the MDA 24-week response rates for the placebo arm range from 3 to 7
% (Coates et al , 2010a ; 
Kavanaugh et al , 2013).  Therefore, for the methotrexate monotherapy arm, the 
response rate is assumed to be higher at 15 %.  In the pivotal phase 3 randomized 
placebo-controlled trial of etanercept in PsA, the MDA response rate for the etanercept monotherapy arm is estimated to be approximately 20
% at week 24 (d ata on file).  For a 
methotrexate naïve population, the response rate is assumed to be higher at 30 %.  In 
addition, the etanercept plus methotrexate therapy arm is assumed to have a 5
% improvement over the etanercept monotherapy arm.  
10.3 Access to Individual Subject Treatment Assignments by Amgen or 
Designees 
Blinded individuals will not have access to unblinded information until the study is 
formally unblinded.  Unblinding and potentially unblinding information should not be 
distributed to the study team, investigators or subjects prior to the study being formally unblinded (eg, the formal unblinding may occur at the final analysis rather than during the primary analysis) except as specified (eg, Section 5.2, Section 9.2.2 and Statistical 
Analysis P lan [SAP]). 
10.4 Planned Analyses  
10.4.1 Primary  Analys is 
The objective for the primary analysis is to evaluate the efficacy of etanercept plus 
methotrexate therapy and etanercept monotherapy compared to methotrexate 
monotherapy in subjects with PsA at week 24 as meas ured by the proportion of subjects 
achieving an ACR 20 response.  The primary analysis will be performed when the last subject completes the week 48 visit or terminates early from the study, at which time the study will be unblinded.

CONFIDENTIAL    For the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints, treatment effect will be tested 
using a Bonferroni -based gatekeeping chain procedure (Burman et al , 2009 and 
Millen  et al, 2011) as described in Section 10.5.2 to control the fami ly-wise 2 -sided type 
one error rate at 0.05.  Between-treatment comparisons will be made using the stratified Cochran-Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test with  baseline BMI and prior non-biologic DMARD 
use as the stratification factors.  Missing data will be imputed using non-responder 
imputation for the primary analysis. 
For other efficacy endpoints, the significance level will be 0.05 without adjusting for 
multiplicity and data will be analyzed as observed. 
10.5 Planned Methods of Analysis  
10.5.1 General Considerations 
Subject disposition, demographics, and baseline disease characteristics will be 
summ
arized descriptively by randomized treatment group. 
For categorical endpoints, the descriptive statistics will contain the frequency and 
percentage.  For continuous endpoints, the descriptive statistics will include the number 
of observations, mean, standard error, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum.  
Treatment effect will be tested for the primary and key secondary endpoints using a Bonferroni -based gatekeeping chain procedure to control the family -wise 2 -sided type 
one error rate at 0.05.  The signi
ficance level for the analyses of other secondary 
endpoints and exploratory endpoints will be 0.05 without adjusting for multiplicity and the p-values for these endpoints will therefore be treated as a descriptive statistic only. 
Safety endpoints will be tabulated by actual treatment received during the study.  No formal 
statistical testing will be performed for safety analyses. 
Details of all statistical methods will be provided in the SAP. 
10.5.2 Primar
y and Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint s 
The primary analysis for the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints, ACR 20 
response and MDA response at week 24, will be performed using the full analysis set.  
Treatment effect will be test ed using the stratified CMH test with baseline BMI and prior 
non-biologic DMARD use as the stratification factors .

CONFIDENTIAL    groups with methotrexate monotherapy  across the primary and key secondary 
endpoints, the hypotheses will be tested using a Bonferroni -based gatekeeping chain 
procedure ( Burman et al , 2009 and Millen et al , 2011) as shown in Figure 1 .  This 
procedure will split alpha of 0.05 equally to test in parallel the primary and key secondary 
endpoints (ACR 20, MDA) for etanercept plus methotrexate therapy vs. methotrexate monotherapy and etanercept monotherapy vs. methotrexate monotherapy sequentially within each parallel path.  If one of the parallel paths rejects both hypotheses 
sequentially, and the other parallel path has at least one hypothesis not rejected, then 
unspent alpha of 0.025 from the successful path will be propagated to the hypotheses in the other path to re-test them sequentially at a level of 0.05.  For example, suppose the 
nominal p-values for hypotheses A1, B1, A2, and B2 ( Figure 1 ) are 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 
0.055, respectively.  In the first round of testing, hypotheses A1 and B1 are rejected, 
whereas hypotheses A2 and B2 are not rejected.  However, since both hypotheses A1 
and B1 are rejected, the procedure gives a second chance to re-test hypotheses A2 and 
B2 (according to the left arm of the figure) at a lower threshold of 0.05 rather than the original threshold of 0.025.  Note that in this example A2 is rejected and hypothesis B2 is 
not rejected.

CONFIDENTIAL    10.5.3 Other Secondary Efficacy  Endpoint s 
The primary analysis of other secondary endpoints will be performed using the full 
analysis set for non-psoriasis endpoints or the psoriasis efficacy analysis set for 
psoriasis endpoints.  For binary endpoints, treatment effect will be tested using the stratified CMH test with BMI and prior non-biologic DMARD use as the stratification 
factors .  For continuous endpoints that exhibit normal distribution, ANCOVA model will 
be used.  The model will include treatment groups and baseline BMI and prior 
non-biologic DMARD as covariates.  For continuous endpoints that are not normally distributed, endpoint data will be first transformed to their joint ranks and then further 
transformed by the Van der Waerden transformation to normalize them  before applying 
ANCOVA model.   The significance level for other secondary endpoints will be 
0.05 without adjusting for multiplicity and p-values will therefore be treated as a 
descriptive statistic only . 
Data will be analyzed as observed with no imputation for missing data.  
10.5.4 Safety Endpoints 
Safety endpoints will be summarized descriptively for all subjects by treatment group based on the safety analysis set.  Subject incidence of all treatment-emergent adverse events will be tabulated by system organ class and preferred term.  Tables of fatal adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse events leading to withdrawal from 
investigational product or other protocol -required therapies, and significant 
treatment-emergent adverse events will also be provided. 
Laboratory parameters with grade 3 or above will be summarized by study visit and 
treatment group.  Vital signs will be reported in baseline summaries.  Shift tables of the 
worst on-study laboratory toxicity for analytes of interest based on Common Toxicity 
Criteria relative to baseline will be tabulated by treatment group (as described in the 
SAP).

Date:  31 August 2016  Page 62 of 76 
CONFIDENTIAL    In addition, all original source documents supporting entries in the CRFs must be 
maintained and be readily available. 
Retention of study documents will be governed by the Clinical Trial  Agreement. 
12.3 Study Monitoring and Data Collection 
The Amgen representative(s) and regulatory authority inspectors are responsible for 
contacting and visiting the investigator for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, 
upon request, inspecting the various records of the clinical study (eg, CRFs and other 
pertinent data) provided that subject confidentiality is respected. 
The c linical monitor is responsible for verifying the CRFs at regular intervals throughout 
the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency 
of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research.  The clinical mo nitor is to have access to subject medical records and other study -related 
records needed to verify the entries on the CRFs. 
The investigator agrees to cooperate with the clinical monitor to ensure that any 
problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in 
completing CRFs, are resolved. In accordance with ICH GCP and the sponsor’s audit plans, this study may be selected for audit by representatives from Amgen’s Global R&D Compliance and Audit function 
(or designees).  Inspection of site facilities (eg, pharmacy, protocol -required therapy 
storage areas, laboratories) and review of study -related records will occur to evaluate 
the study conduct and compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements. 
Data capture for this study is planned to be electronic:  
• All source documentation supporting entries into the CRFs must be maintained and 
readily available. 
• Updates to CRFs will be automatically documented through the software’s “audit trail”. 
• To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data management review is performed on subject data received at Amgen.  During this 
review, subject data are checked for consistency, omissions, and any apparent 
discrepancies.  In addition, the data are reviewed for adherence to the protocol and 
GCP.  To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data management review 
process, data queries and/or site notifications are created in the EDC system 
database for site resolution and subsequently closed by the EDC system or by an 
Amgen reviewer. 
• The i nvestigator signs only the Investigator Verification Form for this EDC study.  
This signature indicate s that the investigator inspected or reviewed the data on the 
CRF, the data queries, and the site notifications, and agrees with the content.

CONFIDENTIAL    Amgen (or designee) will perform self-evident corrections to obvious data errors in the 
clinical trial database, as documented in the Study Specific Self-Evident Corrections 
Plan.  Examples of obvious data errors that may be corrected by Amgen (or designee) 
include deletion of obvious duplicate data (eg, same results sent twice with the same 
date with different visit- week 4 and early termination) and clarifying “other, specify” if 
data are provided (eg, race, physical examination).  Each investigative site will be provided a list of the types of corrections applied to study data at the initiation of the trial 
and at study closeout.  
12.4 Investigator Responsibilities for Data Collection 
The i nvestigator is responsible for comply ing with the requirements for all assessments 
and data collection (including subjects not receiving protocol -required therapies) as 
stipulated in the protocol for each subject in the study.  For subjects who withdraw prior 
to completion of all protocol -required visits and are unabl e or unwilling to continue the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table 1 ), the investigator can search publically available 
records (where permitted) to ascertain survival status.  This ensures that the data set(s) 
produced as an outcome of the study is/are as comprehensive as possible. 
12.5 Language 
All written information and other material to be used by subjects and investigative staff 
must use vocabulary and language that are clearly understood.  CRFs must be completed in English.  TRADENAMES
® (if used) for concomitant medications may be 
entered in the local language. 
12.6 Publication Policy  
Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis of the Uniform Requirement for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors ), which states:  
• Authorship credit should be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception and 
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the 
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; (3) final approval of the 
version to be published; (4) agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.  Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, 3 
and 4. 
• When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group should identify 
the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals should fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above. 
• Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research 
group, alone, does not justify authorship.

CONFIDENTIAL    Appendix A .  Additional Safety Assessment Information 
As noted in Section Adverse Event Grading Scale  
The Common Toxicity  Criteria Version 4.0 is available at the following link: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  
General United States Food and Drug Administration Guidance on Hepatotoxicity 
Stopping and Rechallenge Rules 
6.4, a Food and Drug Administration Guidance exists for 
drug-induced liver injury (DILI).  This guidance is general for all investigational and 
marketed products, and is synopsized here as a reference.  It provides criteria for reporting, monitoring, and withholding investigational product in the event that a subject 
develops signs or symptoms of hepatotoxicity during a clinical trial.  
Criteria for Permanent Withholding of Investigational Product due to Potential 
Hepatotoxicity  
Investigational product should be discontinued permanently and the subject should be 
followed for possible drug-induced liver injury, if ALL of the criteria below are met: 
• TBL >  2 x ULN or international normalized ratio > 1.5 
• AND increased AST or ALT from the relevant bas eline value as specified below: 
Baseline AST or ALT value  AST or ALT elevation  
≤ 1.5 ULN  > 3 x ULN  
• AND no other cause for the combination of laboratory abnormalities is 
immediately apparent; important potential causes for abnormal AST/ALT or TB L 
values include, but are not limited to the following: 
• obstructive gall bladder or bile duct disease  
• viral or alcoholic hepatitis (eg, hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, Epstein-Barr virus, 
cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella)  
• progression of malignancy involving the liver (note that metastatic disease to the 
liver, by itself, should not be used as an explanation for significant AST/ALT 
elevations)  
• hypoxic or ischemic hepatopathy or congestive hepatopathy in association with 
significant right-sided heart failure  
• concomi tant administration of other hepatotoxins, including drugs that inhibit 
bilirubin glucuronidation (eg, indinavir, atazanavir, irinotecan) or herbal or dietary supplements  
• heritable disorders causing impaired glucuronidation (eg, Gilbert’s syndrome); 
alpha-one antitrypsin deficiency  
• autoimmune hepatitis  
• nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or other “fatty liver disease”

Protocol Number:  2 0130207  
Date:  31 August 2016  Page 69 of 76 
CONFIDENTIAL    It should be noted that some of the circumstances above may nevertheless warrant 
discontinuation of investigational product without requiring assessment for drug-induced 
liver injury.  
Criteria for Conditional Withholding of Investigational Product due to Potential 
Hepatotoxicity  
For subjects that do not meet the criteria for permanent withholding of investigational 
product outlined above, investigational product should be withheld if ANY of the following 
criteria are met, and the subject should be evaluated for drug-induced liver injury:  
• Elevation of either AST or ALT according to the following schedule:  
Baseline AST or 
ALT value  AST or ALT elevation  
Any > 8 x ULN at any time 
Any > 5 x ULN but < 8 x ULN for ≥ 2 weeks  
Any > 5 x ULN but < 8 x ULN and unable to adhere to enhanced monitoring 
schedule  
• OR:  clinical signs or symptoms that are, in the opinion of the investigator, 
consistent with hepatitis (such as right upper quadrant pain/tenderness, fever, 
nausea, vomiting, jaundice, rash or eosinophilia >  5%).  If such signs or 
symptoms are coupled with ALT or AST elevations >  3 x ULN, investigational 
product should be withheld. 
• OR:  TBL > 3 x ULN at any  time 
• OR:  ALP > 8 x ULN at any time  
Investigational product should be withheld pending investigation into alternative causes 
of drug-induced liver injury.  If investigational product is withheld, the subject should be 
followed according to recommendations  above for possible drug-induced liver injury.  
Rechallenge may be considered if an alternative cause is discovered and the laboratory abnormalities resolve to normal or baseline.  
Criteria for Rechallenge of investigational product after Potential Hepatotoxicity  
The decision to rechallenge the subject should be discussed and agreed upon unanimously by the subject, principal investigator, and Amgen. 
If signs or symptoms recur with rechallenge, then investigational product should be 
permanently discontinued.  Subjects who clearly meet the criteria for permanent 
discontinuation should never be rechallenged.

CONFIDENTIAL    Drug -induced Liver Injury Reporting & Additional Assessments  
To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of DILI, cases of concurrent AST or  ALT 
and TBL according to the criteria specified in Section Reporting  
6.4 (3 x ULN for AST/ALT and 
2 x ULN for TBL)  require the following: 
• The event is to be reported to Amgen as a serious adverse event within 24 hours of 
discovery or notification of the event (ie, before additional etiologic investigations 
have been concluded)  
• The appropriate CRF (eg, Adverse Event CRF) that captures information necessary 
to facilitate the evaluation of treatment-emergent liver abnormalities is to be 
completed and sent to the Amgen.  
Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Section 9.2.2.  
• Repeat AST, ALT, ALP and bilirubin (total and direct) within 24 hours  Additional Clinical Assessments and Observation  
All subjects in whom investigational product(s) or protocol -required therapies is/are 
withheld (either permanently or conditionally) due to potential DILI as specified above or 
who experience AST or ALT elevations >  3 x ULN are to undergo a period of “close 
observation” until abnormalities return to normal or to the subject’s baseline levels.  
Assessments that are to be performed during this period include: 
• In cases of TBL >  2x ULN retesting of liver tests, bilirubin (total and direct) is to be 
performed every 24 hours until laboratory abnormalities improve  
Testing frequency of the above laboratory tests may decrease if the abnormalities 
stabilize or the investigational product(s) or protocol -required therapies has/have been 
discontinued AND the subject is asymptomatic  
• Initiate investigation of alternative causes for elevated AST or ALT and/or elevated 
TBL: 
○ Obtain complete blood count with differential to assess for eosinophilia 
○ Obtain serum total immunoglobulin IgG, Anti -nuclear antibody, 
Anti Smooth Muscle Antibody, and Liver Kidney Microsomal antibody 1 to 
assess for autoimmune hepatitis  
○ Obtain serum acetaminophen (paracetamol) levels 
○ Obtain a more detailed history of: 
− Prior and/or concurrent diseases or illness 
− Exposure to environmental and/or industrial chemical agents  
Product:  Etanercept  
Protocol Number:  2 0130207  
Date:  31 August 2016  Page 71 of 76 
CONFIDENTIAL    − Symptoms (if applicable) including right upper quadrant pain, 
hypersensitivity -type reactions, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and 
fever  
− Prior and/or concurrent use of alcohol, recreational drugs and 
special diets  
− Concomitant use of medications (including non-prescription medicines and herbal and dietary supplements), plants, and mushrooms  
○ Obtain viral serologies 
○ Obtain CPK, haptoglobin, LDH, and peripheral blood smear  
○ Perform appropriate liver imaging if clinically indicated 
○ Obtain appropriate blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis if this has 
not already been collected  
○ Obtain hepatology consult (liver biopsy may be considered in consultation 
with an hepatologist)  
○ Follow the subject and the laboratory tests (ALT, AST, TBL) until all 
laboratory abnormalities return to baseline or normal.  The “close 
observation period” is to continue for a minimum of 4 weeks after discontinuation of all investigational product(s) and protocol -required 
therapies.  
The potential DILI event and additional information such as medical history, concomitant 
medications and laboratory results must be captured in corresponding CRFs.

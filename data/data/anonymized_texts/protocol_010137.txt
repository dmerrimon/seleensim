Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 3  STUDY SYNOPSIS 
Title: A Multicenter, Open-Label, Phase 2 Study of the Bruton’s Tyrosine 
Kinase (BTK) Inhibitor, Ibrutinib, in Combination with Rituximab in Previously Untreated Subjects with Follicular Lymphoma 
Protocol Number: PCYC-1125-CA 
Phase: 2 
Indication: Previously untreated subjects with follicular lymphoma (FL) 
Study Drug and 
Comparator: Ibrutinib PO hard gelatin capsule in combination with rituximab; no 
comparator is used in this study.
Objectives: Primary
xTo evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib when combined with 
rituximab (determined by the overall response rate [ORR]) in previously untreated subjects with FL 
Secondary
xTo evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib combined with rituximab in 
subjects with FL as assessed by the duration of response (DOR), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) 
xTo evaluate the safety and tolerability of ibrutinib combined with 
rituximab in previously untreated subjects with FL 
Exploratory
xTo determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ibrutinib when 
combined with rituximab in subjects with FL  
xTo evaluate prognostic and predictive biomarkers relative to 
treatment outcomes 
Study Design: This is an open-label, Phase 2 study designed to assess the efficacy and 
safety of ibrutinib combined with rituximab in previously untreated 
subjects with FL.  The study will include approximately 80 subjects with two treatment arms. 
Two Treatment Arms   
In Arm 1 (n = 60), subjects will receive ibrutinib 560 mg PO 
continuously until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  In addition, subjects will receive rituximab 375 mg/m
2 intravenous (IV) 
once weekly for 4 doses for the first 4 weeks of study treatment. Subjects in Arm 1 will have imaging efficacy assessments every 
12 weeks for the first 8 assessments and then every 24 weeks thereafter. 
In Arm 2 (n = 20), subjects will receive ibrutinib 560 mg PO 
continuously as a single agent for the first 8 weeks, then ibrutinib at 
560 mg will continue concurrently with rituximab 375 mg/m
2 IV once 
weekly for 4 doses.  Once treatment with rituximab is complete, 
subjects will continue to receive single-agent ibrutinib continuously 
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  Subjects in Arm 2 will have imaging efficacy assessments at Week 9, Week 20, and then every 12 weeks for 6 assessments after Week 20, and then every 24 weeks thereafter. 
Ibrutinib  Protocol PCYC-1125-CA - Amendment 3.0 
IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 4  One of the purposes of Arm 2 is to identify biomarkers that predict 
sensitivity or resistance to ibrutinib.  Based on Phase 1 clinical data in FL it is predicted that approximately half of the subjects treated in this arm will show evidence of resistance to single-agent ibrutinib.  By providing a lead-in time prior to the initiation of rituximab, pre- and 
post-progression biopsy samples can be collected to address markers of 
drug resistance.  These objectives are exploratory and therefore the primary and secondary objectives related to clinical efficacy are paramount but will be analyzed separately from Arm 1 since the treatment regimen in this arm is different. 
The exploratory objectives are to evaluate prognostic and predictive 
biomarkers relative to treatment outcomes.  For Arm 1, pre-treatment 
and post-progression tumor tissue biopsies are optional.  For Arm 2, pre-treatment tumor tissue biopsy is required and post-progression tumor tissue biopsies are desired but optional.  Tumor samples may be analyzed by gene expression profiling (GEP), whole exome sequencing 
(WES), or other methods. 
Number of Subjects: The planned sample size is 80 subjects (60 and 20 subjects in Arms 1 
and 2, respectively) enrolled at multiple sites in the United States (US).

Safety Plan: This study will be monitored in accordance with the Sponsor’s 
Pharmacovigilance Committee procedures.  Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reviewed internally on an ongoing basis to identify potential safety concerns.  The Sponsor may 
schedule conference calls with the investigators to discuss study 
progress, obtain investigator feedback, and/or to exchange and discuss study-specific issues including AEs and SAEs. 
Study Treatment: In Arm 1 (n = 60), subjects will receive 560 mg of ibrutinib each day 
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  Rituximab 375 mg/m
2 will be given IV once weekly for 4 doses for the first 
4 weeks of study treatment.   
In Arm 2 (n = 20), subjects will receive ibrutinib 560 mg PO 
continuously as a single agent for 8 weeks, then ibrutinib at 560 mg will continue concurrently with rituximab 375 mg/m
2 IV once weekly 
for 4 doses.  Single agent ibrutinib will then continue at 560 mg until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.   
Subjects may receive treatment for up to three years after the first dose 
of the last subject enrolled, until they enroll in an extension study, reach the time of the study closure, or discontinue from the study for any reason, whichever occurs first. 
Concomitant Therapy and Clinical Practice: Permitted Concomitant Medications
xSupportive medications in accordance with standard practice (such 
as for emesis, diarrhea, etc.) are permitted.  Use of neutrophil growth factors (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], eg, 
filgrastim and pegfilgrastim) and red blood cell growth factors 
(erythropoietin) are permitted per institutional policy and in accordance with the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines ( Smith 2006 ).   
xTransfusions may be given in accordance with institutional policy. 
xShort courses of corticosteroids ( 14 days) as treatment for 
non-cancer-related medical reasons (eg, joint inflammation, asthma 
exacerbation, rash, antiemetic use, arthritis, asthma, autoimmune 
Ibrutinib  Protocol PCYC-1125-CA - Amendment 3.0 
IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 8  cytopenia, and infusion reactions) at doses that do not exceed 
100 mg per day of prednisone or equivalent are permitted. 
Medications to be Used with Caution
Ibrutinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4.  Due to the potential 
increase in ibrutinib exposure, concomitant use of strong CYP3A 
inhibitors should be avoided while the subject is receiving treatment.  
If use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor is indicated, selection of an alternate concomitant medication with less potent enzyme inhibition potential is strongly recommended.  If ibrutinib must be administered with a strong CYP3A inhibitor, the Medical Monitor should be consulted before use, 
and a dose reduction of ibrutinib to 140 mg daily or temporary hold of 
ibrutinib should be considered.  Subjects should be closely monitored for potential treatment-related toxicities. 
Prohibited Concomitant Medications
xChemotherapy, anticancer immunotherapy, experimental therapy, 
or radiotherapy (except as stated under permitted concomitant medications) are prohibited while the subject is receiving ibrutinib.  
xCorticosteroids for the treatment of the underlying disease are 
prohibited.   
xCorticosteroids for the treatment of non-cancer related reasons for 
longer than 14 days and/or at doses >100 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent are prohibited. 
Statistical Methods: Analysis Methods for Arm 1
The primary analysis for all efficacy endpoints will be conducted based on the all-treated population.  The all-treated population is defined as the subjects who are enrolled in the study and have received at least 
1 dose of study treatment.  
The ORR and its 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated using 
normal approximation to the binomial distribution using Wilson’s score method.  If the lower bound of the CI around the ORR is greater than or equal to 53%, the primary efficacy objective is achieved.  
Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the interval between the date 
of initial documentation of a response of CR or PR, and the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease (PD), death, or date of censoring if applicable.  The distribution (median, its 95% CI and Kaplan-Meier curves) of DOR will be provided using Kaplan-Meier 
estimates for responders in the all-treated population. 
Progression-free survival (PFS) will be assessed and defined as the 
period from the date of first dose of ibrutinib until the date of first documented evidence of PD or death, whichever occurs earlier.  Overall survival (OS) is measured from the date of first dose of ibrutinib to the date of the subject’s death from any cause.  PFS and OS 
will be analyzed by the same time-to-event analysis method used for 
DOR.   
 
Ibrutinib  Protocol PCYC-1125-CA - Amendment 3.0 
IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 9  Analysis Methods for Arm 2
Overall Response Rate (ORR) and its 95% confidence interval will be 
calculated using normal approximation to the binomial distribution 
using Wilson’s score method. 
Distribution of DOR, PFS and OS will be summarized using the 
Kaplan-Meier estimate of median and its corresponding 95% CI where 
the summaries are possible.    
Analysis for Study Report
The analyses for the clinical study report (CSR) will occur at least 
1 year after the last subject enrolled received the first dose of study 
drug.  
Sample Size Determination: The hypotheses test of primary endpoint analysis for Arm 1 in this 
study assumes an underlying response rate of 53% for first-line 
rituximab treatment in subjects with low grade FL ( Hainsworth 2002 ; 
Freedman 2009 ).  A sample size of approximately 60 eligible subjects 
is needed to exclude a 53% response rate at the 1-sided 0.025 significance level with at least 80% power, assuming a response rate of 71% is achieved.

For more detailed and comprehensive background information, please refer to the current 
ibrutinib Investigator’s Brochure ( IB). 
1.1 Follicular Lymphoma 
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is one of the most common types of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma 
(NHL) accounting for approximately 22% of cases ( NHL Classification Project 1997 ), and for 
about 70% of indolent lymphomas ( NHL Cyber family web site ).  Follicular lymphoma is 
characterized by an indolent clinical course, typical morphology, and the presence of a chromosomal translocation, t(14;18)(q32;q21) or variant in 85% of patients ( Relander 2010 ).  
The overall incidence of B-cell lymphoid neoplasms in the United States (US) is estimated at 26.13/100,000 person years ( Morton 2006 ), with FL accounting for 3.18 new cases per 100,000 
persons each year in the US and 5 to 7 new cases per 100,000 persons each year in the European Union (EU)
 (Dreyling 2011 ).  The neoplastic lymphocytes in FL express pan-B markers CD19, 
CD20, CD22, and CD79a; as well as antigens of the germinal center (including CD10 and Bcl-6).  Histologically, the follicular form of NHL is composed mainly of centrocytes with an admixture of centroblasts.  Grading is based on the number of large transformed cells in 10 malignant follicles viewed at high power
 (Martinez 2007 ).  Follicular lymphoma is generally 
subdivided into 3 grades (NHL Classification Project 2007).  However, Grade 3 is often further 
divided into 2 subgroups, 3a and 3b; with 3b considered more aggressive (Hans 2003 ).  
Treatment depends on the stage of the disease, symptoms, patient age, and comorbidities. 
The best time to initiate therapy is a decision of the individual oncologist managing the 
individual patient.  Current guidelines (eg, National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN]) are somewhat flexible; therapies and therapy start times are variable.  Some treating oncologists especially for patients in earlier stages of disease prefer a watch-and-wait approach in an attempt 
to manage disease symptoms and treatment toxicities ( Colombat 2001 ; Young 1988 ).  Since FL 
is slow growing, it may take years for the disease to progress, during which time treatment may not be necessary.  Depending on a patient’s symptoms, early treatment may not always improve overall survival, especially if the disease is not affecting their organs (Colombat 2001). 
Patients with Stage III or IV FL who have involvement of multiple lymph node regions, 
involvement of one or more organs or tissues outside the lymphatic system, and systemic symptoms, are candidates for immediate therapy.  When the decision to treat has been made, initial therapy may include rituximab as a single agent.  Two single-arm studies have been published that form the basis for the NCCN guidelines for rituximab in the first line setting.  In the first study with 49 patients with low tumor burden where rituximab was given for a total of 4 weekly doses, patients were eligible for inclusion if they had follicular NHL according to the Revised European American Lymphoma (REAL) classification ( Harris 1994 ); disease stage was 
II to IV according to Ann-Arbor classification, and the presence of at least one measurable disease site was required ( Colombat 2001 ).  The overall response rate (ORR) was 73% and the 
Ibrutinib  Protocol PCYC-1125-CA - Amendment 3.0 
IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 18  time to progression was 50% after the first year ( Colombat 2001 ).  In the second study, 
60 patients were treated with 4 weekly doses of rituximab followed by maintenance therapy at 6-month intervals until progression ( Hainsworth 2002 ).  Inclusion criteria included biopsy- 
proven indolent B-cell NHL as defined by the REAL classification; disease stage was II to IV or disease Stage I or II if relapsed or progressed after radiation therapy (Hainsworth 2002).  The ORR was 47% and long-term follow data had a progression-free survival (PFS) of 34 months (Hainsworth 2002).   
A third larger study in 349 treatment-naïve patients treated with 4 weekly courses of rituximab 
showed an ORR of 59% ( Freedman 2009 ).  This study included patients with histologically 
confirmed CD20+ FL World Health Organization (WHO) Grade 1 to 3 who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1 (Freedman 2009).  The long-term outcome of this study is hard to interpret due to further randomization to an experimental regimen. 
In patients with large tumor burdens, rituximab may be combined with 1 or more cytotoxic 
drugs.  Alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide or bendamustine, in combination with rituximab, constitute the mainstay of combination therapy.  The most commonly used alkylator-based regimens include BR (bendamustine and rituximab), R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone), or R-CVP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone) ( Lymphoma Research Foundation 2011 ).  
Response rates in excess of 85% are observed with many different combinations in the first-line setting ( Peterson 2003 ; Hiddeman 2005 ; Czuczman 2005 ; Rummel 2005 ); however these 
treatments are associated with significantly more toxicity than single-agent rituximab.  
Due to the toxicity seen with standard combination treatment regimens in patients who are 
elderly, and for patients that have moderate tumor burdens and non-life threatening disease, an 
initial chemotherapy-free regimen such as rituximab and ibrutinib may be an attractive treatment 
option if found to be well tolerated and have significant anti-tumor activity.   
1.2 Ibrutinib Background 
Ibrutinib (I
MBRUVICA®) is a first-in-class, potent, orally administered covalently-binding 
inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) co-developed by Pharmacyclics LLC and Janssen Research & Development LLC for the treatment of B-cell malignancies.  Inhibition of BTK blocks downstream B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathways and thus prevents B-cell proliferation.  In vitro, ibrutinib inhibits purified BTK and selected members of the kinase family with 10-fold specificity compared with non-BTK kinases.   
Ibrutinib has been approved in many regions, including the US and EU, for indications covering 
the treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least 1 prior therapy, patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), including CLL with a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del17p), and patients 
Ibrutinib  Protocol PCYC-1125-CA - Amendment 3.0 
IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 19  with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia.  Ibrutinib is currently under investigation in various 
indications as a single agent and in combinations.  
B-cells are lymphocytes with multiple functions in the immune response, including antigen 
presentation, antibody production, and cytokine release.  B-cells express cell surface immunoglobulins comprising the BCR, which is activated by binding to antigen.  Antigen binding induces receptor aggregation and the cl ustering and activation of multiple tyrosine 
kinases, which in turn activate further downstream signaling pathways ( Bishop 2003 ).  
The process of B-cell maturation, including immunoglobulin chain rearrangement and somatic 
mutation, is tightly regulated.  It is thought that B-cell lymphomas and CLL result from mutations and translocations acquired during normal B-cell development ( Shaffer 2002 ).  
Several lines of evidence suggest that signaling through the BCR is necessary to sustain the viability of B-cell malignancies.   
The role of BTK in BCR signal transduction is demonstrated by the human genetic 
immunodeficiency disease X-linked agammaglobulinemia and the mouse genetic disease X-linked immunodeficiency, both caused by a mutation in the BTK gene.  These genetic diseases are characterized by reduced BCR signaling and a failure to generate mature B-cells.  The BTK protein is expressed in most hematopoietic cells with the exception of T-cells and natural killer cells, but the selective effect of BTK mutations suggests that its primary functional role is in antigen receptor signaling in B-cells ( Satterthwaite 2000 ).   
Data from Study PCYC-04753 demonstrate that although ibrutinib is rapidly eliminated from the 
plasma after oral administration, once daily dosing with ibrutinib is adequate to sustain maximal pharmacodynamic activity for 24 hours postdose at dose levels 2.5 mg/kg.  In Study 
PCYC-04753, the BTK occupancies for the 2.5 mg/kg/day to 12.5 mg/kg/day cohorts and for the 560 mg continuous dosing cohort, were all above 90% at either 4 or 24 hours after drug 
administration.  
For the most comprehensive nonclinical and clinical information regarding ibrutinib background, 
safety, efficacy, and in vitro and in vivo preclin ical activity and toxicology of ibrutinib, refer to 
the latest version of the ibrutinib  IB. 
1.3 Summary of Nonclinical Data 
1.3.1 Pharmacology
Ibrutinib was designed as a selective and covalent inhibitor of the BTK ( Pan 2007 ).  In vitro, 
ibrutinib is a potent inhibitor of BTK activity (IC
50 = 0.39 nM).  The irreversible binding of 
ibrutinib to cysteine-481 in the active site of BTK results in sustained inhibition of BTK catalytic activity and enhanced selectivity over other kinases that do not contain a cysteine at this position.  When added directly to human whole blood, ibrutinib inhibits signal transduction from the B-cell

Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 20  receptor and blocks primary B-cell activation (IC 50 = 80 nM) as assayed by anti-IgM stimulation 
followed by CD69 expression ( Herman 2011 ).   
Ibrutinib arrested cell growth and induced apoptosis in human B-cell lymphoma cell lines in vitro 
and inhibited tumor growth in vivo in xenograft models ( Herman 2011 ).  Ibrutinib also inhibited 
adhesion and migration of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells in co-culture and reduced tumor burden in lymph node and bone marrow in a murine model of MCL dissemination and progression ( Chang 2013a ; Chang 2013b ). 
For more detailed and comprehensive information regarding nonclinical pharmacology and 
toxicology, please refer to the current IB. 
1.3.2 Toxicology
In safety pharmacology assessments, no treatment-related effects were observed in the central 
nervous system or respiratory system in rats at any dose tested.  Further, no treatment-related corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation effect was observed at any tested dose in a cardiovascular study using telemetry-monitored dogs.   
Based on data from rat and dog including general toxicity studies up to 13 weeks duration, 
the greatest potential for human toxicity with ibrutinib is predicted to be in lymphoid tissues (lymphoid depletion) and in the gastrointestinal tract (soft feces/diarrhea with or without inflammation).  Additional toxicity findings seen in only one species with no observed human correlate in clinical studies to date include pancreatic acinar cell atrophy (rat), minimally decreased trabecular and cortical bone (rat) and corneal dystrophy (dog).    
In vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity studies showed that ibrutinib is not genotoxic.  In a rat 
embryo-fetal toxicity study, ibrutinib administration was associated with fetal loss and malformations (teratogenicity) at ibrutinib doses that result in approximately 6 times and 14 times the exposure (AUC [area under the curve]) in patients administered the dose of 560 mg 
daily, respectively. 
For the most comprehensive nonclinical and clinical information regarding ibrutinib, please refer 
to the current version of the IB.  
1.3.3 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with ibrutinib. 
Ibrutinib was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutagenicity (Ames) assay, was not clastogenic in a 
chromosome aberration assay in mammalian (CHO) cells, nor was it clastogenic in an in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice at doses up to 2000 mg/kg.

Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 21  Fertility studies with ibrutinib have not been conducted in animals.  In the general toxicology 
studies conducted in rats and dogs, orally administered ibrutinib did not result in adverse effects on reproductive organs. 
1.4 Summary of Clinical Studies 
Ibrutinib is under late-stage development as an orally administered anticancer agent for patients 
with B-cell malignancies.  As of the 06 April 2014 data cutoff date, there are 26 ongoing and 9 completed company-sponsored clinical trials investigating the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ibrutinib in humans as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy and immunotherapy.  Ongoing and completed company-sponsored clinical studies of ibrutinib are summarized in the current version of the IB.  
1.4.1 Pharmacokinetics and Product Metabolism 
Following oral administration of ibrutinib at doses ranging from 1.25 to 12.5 mg/kg/day as well 
as fixed dose levels of 420, 560, and 840 mg/day, exposure to ibrutinib increased as doses increased with substantial intersubject variability.  The mean half-life (t
1/2) of ibrutinib across 
3 clinical studies ranged from 4 to 9 hours, with a median time to maximum plasma concentration (T
max) of 2 hours.  Administration of 420 mg ibrutinib with a high-fat breakfast in 
subjects with CLL approximately doubled the mean systemic exposure compared to intake after overnight fasting with median time to T
max delayed from 2 to 4 hours.  Ibrutinib was extensively 
metabolized to the dihydrodiol metabolite PCI-45227, a reversible inhibitor of BTK, with approximately 15 times lower inhibitory potency compared to ibrutinib.  The metabolite-to-parent AUC ratio ranged from 0.7 to 3.4.  Steady-state exposure of ibrutinib and PCI-45227 was less than 2-fold of first dose exposure. 
The results of a human mass balance study of [
14C]-ibrutinib conducted in six healthy male 
subjects demonstrated that less than 10% of the total dose of [14C]-ibrutinib is renally excreted, 
whereas approximately 80% is recovered in feces.  Subjects with mild and moderate renal 
insufficiency (creatinine clearance >30 mL/min) were eligible to enroll in Study PCYC-1102-CA in which pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments were included.  No dose adjustment is needed for subjects with mild or moderate renal impairment (greater than 30 mL/min creatinine clearance) in this study.  There is no data in patients with severe renal impairment or subjects on dialysis.   Following single dose administration, the AUC of ibrutinib increased 2.7-, 8.2- and 9.8-fold in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A), moderate (Child-Pugh class B), and severe (Child-Pugh class C) hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal liver function. A higher proportion of Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions were reported in patients with B-cell malignancies (CLL, MCL and WM) with mild hepatic impairment based on NCI organ dysfunction working group (NCI-ODWG) criteria for hepatic dysfunction compared to patients with normal hepatic function.

1.4.3 Risks 
1.4.3.1 Bleeding-related Events 
There have been reports of hemorrhagic events in subjects treated with ibrutinib, both with and 
without thrombocytopenia.  These include minor hemorrhagic events such as contusion, epistaxis, and petechiae; and major hemorrhagic events, some fatal, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and hematuria.  Use of ibrutinib in subjects requiring other anticoagulants or medications that inhibit platelet function may increase the risk of bleeding.  Subjects with congenital bleeding diathesis have not been studied.  See Section 6.1.2.4  for 
guidance on concomitant use of anticoagulants, antiplatelet therapy and/or supplements.  See Section 6.2  for guidance on ibrutinib management with surgeries or procedures.   
1.4.3.2 Lymphocytosis and Leukostasis 
Leukostasis 
There were isolated cases of leukostasis reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib.  A high 
number of circulating lymphocytes (>400,000/ μL) may confer increased risk.  
Lymphocytosis
Upon initiation of treatment, a reversible increase in lymphocyte counts (ie, 50% increase from 
baseline and an absolute count >5000/ μL), often associated with reduction of lymphadenopathy, 
has been observed in most subjects with CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) treated with ibrutinib.  This effect has also been observed in some subjects with MCL treated with ibrutinib. This observed lymphocytosis (increase in the number of circulating lymphocytes e.g. >400,000/ μL) is a pharmacodynamic effect and should not be considered progressive disease in 
the absence of other clinical findings.  In both disease types, lymphocytosis typically occurs during the first few weeks of ibrutinib therapy and typically resolves within a median of 
Ibrutinib  Protocol PCYC-1125-CA - Amendment 3.0 
IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 24  8.0 weeks in subjects with MCL and 14 weeks in subjects with CLL/SLL.  Lymphocytosis was 
not observed in subjects with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia treated with ibrutinib.   
1.4.3.3 Atrial Fibrillation 
Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib, 
particularly in subjects with cardiac risk factors, hypertension, acute infections, and a previous history of atrial fibrillation.  Subjects who develop arrhythmic symptoms (e.g., palpitations, lightheadedness) or new onset of dyspnea should be evaluated clinically, and if indicated, have an ECG performed.  For atrial fibrillation which persists, consider the risks and benefits of ibrutinib treatment and follow the protocol dose modification guidelines (see Section 5.4.1 ). 
1.4.3.4 Cytopenias
Treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia) were 
reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib.  Subjects should be monitored for fever, weakness, or easy bruising and/or bleeding. 
1.4.3.5 Diarrhea
Diarrhea is the most frequently reported non-hematologic AE with ibrutinib monotherapy and 
combination therapy.  Other frequently reported gastrointestinal events include nausea, vomiting, and constipation.  These events are rarely severe.  Should symptoms be severe or prolonged follow the protocol dose modification guidelines (see Section 5.4.1 ).  
1.4.3.6 Infections 
Infections (including sepsis, bacterial, viral, or fungal infections) were observed in subjects 
treated with ibrutinib therapy.  Some of these reported infections have been associated with hospitalization and death.  Although causality has not been established, cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred in subjects treated with ibrutinib.  Subjects should be monitored for symptoms (fever, chills, weakness, confusion) and appropriate 
therapy should be instituted as indicated. 
1.4.3.7 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) 
Cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD) have been reported in patients treated with ibrutinib. 
Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD.  Should symptoms develop follow the protocol dose modification guidelines (see Section 5.4.1 ). 
1.4.3.8 Non-melanoma Skin Cancer 
Non-melanoma skin cancers have occurred in patients treated with ibrutinib.  Monitor patients 
for the appearance of non-melanoma skin cancer.

Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 25  1.4.3.9 Rash
Rash has been commonly reported in subjects treated with either single-agent ibrutinib or in 
combination with chemotherapy.  In a randomized Phase 3 study (PCYC-1112-CA), rash occurred at a higher rate in the ibrutinib arm than in the control arm.  Most rashes were mild to moderate in severity.  Isolated cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens - Johnson syndrome (SJS) have been reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib.  Subjects should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms suggestive of SCAR including SJS.  Subjects receiving ibrutinib should be observed closely for rashes and treated symptomatically, including interruption of the suspected agent as appropriate.  In addition, hypersensitivity-related events erythema, urticaria, angioedema have been reported.   
1.4.3.10 Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
There have been reports of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) events in subjects treated with single-
agent ibrutinib or in combination with chemotherapy.  Subjects at risk of TLS are those with comorbidities and/or risk factors such as high tumor burden prior to treatment, increased uric acid (hyperuricemia), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bulky disease at baseline, and 
preͲexisting kidney abnormalities. 
1.4.3.11 Hypertension 
Hypertension has been commonly reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib.  Monitor subjects 
for new onset hypertension or hypertension that is not adequately controlled after starting ibrutinib.  Adjust existing anti-hypertensive medications and/or initiate anti-hypertensive treatment as appropriate. 
1.5 Justification of Study Design and Dose Rationale
This is an open-label, Phase 2 study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib and 
rituximab in subjects with previously untreated FL. Rituximab, given either as a single agent or in combination, is currently a recommended therapy for previously untreated FL.  All subjects will receive ibrutinib and rituximab; the study will include two treatment arms with 60 subjects in the main study arm and 20 subjects in the exploratory study arm. For the 60 subjects in Arm 1, the study will determine clinically meaningful efficacy for the combination of ibrutinib and rituximab in untreated FL subjects. Assuming an ORR of 53% for single-agent rituximab, a response rate of 71% for the combination of ibrutinib and rituximab implies an 18% improvement in ORR over rituximab alone. With a sample size of 60, an 18% change in ORR will be detected with 81% power at 1-sided significance level 0.025 (or 2-sided significance level 0.05). 
The proposed dose for rituximab is 375 mg/m
2 intravenous (IV) administered once weekly for 
4 weeks.  This dose was given in two single-arm published studies that form the basis for the 
Ibrutinib  Protocol PCYC-1125-CA - Amendment 3.0 
IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 26  NCCN guidelines for rituximab in the first-line setting ( Colombat 2001 ; Hainsworth 2002 ) 
and has been used in relapsed/refractory FL ( McLaughlin 1998 ). 
The proposed dose for ibrutinib is 560 mg per day (4 x 140-mg capsules) administered once daily 
without interruption.  In the Phase 1 study (PCYC-04753), the 560 mg dose administered once daily appeared safe and favorable responses were seen in subjects with NHL as outlined above.   
Study PCYC-04753 was a first-in-human, Phase 1, dose-escalating study of ibrutinib in subjects 
with recurrent B-cell lymphoma including NHL, CLL, FL, MCL, and WM.  Five sequential cohorts of subjects received ibrutinib from 1.25 to 12.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days of a 35-day cycle and 2 additional cohorts received a continuous ibrutinib dose of 8.3 mg/kg/day or a 560-mg fixed dose. 
Sixty-six (66) subjects were enrolled including 16 subjects with FL.  Of the 16 subjects with FL, 
11 (68.8%) were evaluable for response.  The ORR for these 11 subjects was 45.5%, with 3 complete responses (CR, 27.3%) and 2 partial responses (PR, 18.2%) and median PFS was 13.4 months.  Five (45.5%) of the six remaining subjects had stable disease (SD).   
These data imply relevant anti-tumor activity in the indolent lymphoma patient population.  
In Study PCYC-04753, ibrutinib was well tolerated across a broad range of doses (1.25 through 12.5 mg/kg/day) both when given intermittently and continuously on a 35-day cycle to subjects with a variety of lymphoid malignancies.  The most common AEs (>20% of subjects) in this population were diarrhea, fatigue, cough, nausea, headache, and pyrexia. AEs were generally mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2) and readily managed or reversible.  There was no apparent relationship between the incidences or severity of AEs and dose or schedule of ibrutinib.  In addition, the maximum tolerated dose of ibrutinib was not reached. Pharmacodynamic studies revealed complete BTK active-site occupancy in PBMCs at doses of 2.5 mg/kg and above, including the 560 mg continuous dosing cohort.  In addition, because of an expected tissue-to-
plasma concentration ratio of 50% in more distant compartments, such as blood-forming organs 
(bone marrow, spleen, and lymph node) and lymphoid tumor tissue (based on ratio data in the range of 0.44 to 0.67 observed in rat), it is reasonable to expect full BTK occupancy in these tissues at doses of 5 mg/kg and above. 
Taken together, these data support the proposed doses for the combination of rituximab and 
ibrutinib.  If the combination is effective and well tolerated, further investigation in the treatment-naïve FL population will be warranted. 
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES
2.1 Primary Objective 
The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib when combined with rituximab 
(determined by the ORR) in previously untreated subjects with FL.

IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 27  2.2 Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives are: 
xTo evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib combined with rituximab in subjects with FL as 
assessed by the duration of response (DOR), PFS, and overall survival (OS) 
xTo evaluate the safety and tolerability of ibrutinib combined with rituximab in previously 
untreated subjects with FL 
2.3 Exploratory Objective 
The exploratory objectives are: 
xTo determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ibrutinib when combined with rituximab in 
subjects with FL 
xTo evaluate prognostic and predictive biomarkers relative to treatment outcomes 
3. STUDY DESIGN
3.1 Description of Study 
This is an open-label, Phase 2 study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib 
combined with rituximab in previously untreated subjects with FL.  The study will include approximately 80 subjects with two treatment arms. 
In Arm 1 (n=60), subjects will receive ibrutinib 560 mg per oral (PO) continuously until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity.  In addition, subjects will receive rituximab 375 mg/m
2 IV 
once weekly for 4 doses for the first 4 weeks of study treatment. Subjects in Arm 1 will have imaging efficacy assessments every 12 weeks for the first 8 assessments and then every 24 weeks thereafter.   
In Arm 2 (n=20), subjects will receive ibrutinib 560 mg PO continuously as a single agent for the 
first 8 weeks, then ibrutinib at 560 mg will continue concurrently with rituximab 375 mg/m
2 IV 
once weekly for 4 doses.  Once treatment with rituximab is complete, subjects will continue to receive single-agent ibrutinib continuously until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Subjects in Arm 2 will have imaging efficacy assessments at Week 9, Week 20 and then every 12 weeks for 6 assessments after Week 20, and then every 24 weeks thereafter.  Subjects who progress prior to starting rituximab will be discontinued from the study.  Rituximab will not be administered prior to the protocol-specified administration. 
One of the purposes of Arm 2 is to identify biomarkers that predict sensitivity or resistance to 
ibrutinib.  Based on Phase 1 clinical data in FL it is predicted that approximately half of the subjects treated in this arm will show evidence of resistance to single-agent ibrutinib.  By providing a lead-in time prior to the initiation of rituximab, pre- and post-progression biopsy 
Ibrutinib  Protocol PCYC-1125-CA - Amendment 3.0 
IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 28  samples can be collected to address markers of drug resistance.  These objectives are exploratory 
and therefore the primary and secondary objectives related to clinical efficacy are paramount but will be analyzed separately from Arm 1 since the treatment regimen in this arm is different. 
For Arm 1, pre-treatment and post-progression tumor tissue biopsies are optional.  For Arm 2, 
pre-treatment tumor tissue biopsy is required and post-progression tumor tissue biopsies are desired but optional.  Tumor samples may be analyzed by gene expression profiling (GEP), whole exome sequencing (WES), or other methods. 
Subjects may receive treatment for up to three years after the first dose of the last subject 
enrolled, until they enroll in an extension study, reach the time of the study closure, or discontinue from the study for any reason, whichever occurs first. Reasons for treatment discontinuation are outlined in Section 8.2 .

5.1 Enrollment and Blinding 
This is an open-label, Phase 2 study with two treatment arms.  Subjects will not be blinded to 
study drug nor will they be randomized.  Enrolled subjects will receive open-label ibrutinib capsules in combination with rituximab. 
5.2 Formulation, Packaging and Storage 
5.2.1 Ibrutinib 
Ibrutinib capsules are provided as a hard gelatin capsule containing 140 mg of ibrutinib.  
All formulation excipients are compendial and are commonly used in oral formulations.  Refer to the ibrutinib IB for a list of excipients.  
The ibrutinib capsules will be packaged in opaque high-density polyethylene plastic bottles with 
labels bearing the appropriate label text as required by governing regulatory agencies.  All study drug will be dispensed in child-resistant packaging.   
Please refer to the pharmacy manual for additional guidance on study drug preparation, handling 
and storage. 
5.2.2 Rituximab 
Rituximab ( RITUXAN
®) is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory, 
low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL.  In addition, rituximab, given either as a single agent or in combination, is currently a recommended therapy for previously untreated FL per the NCCN guidelines.  Rituximab is a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative-free liquid concentrate for IV administration.  Rituximab is supplied at a concentration of 10 mg/mL in either 100 mg (10 mL) or 500 mg (50 mL) single-use vials.  The product is formulated for IV administration in 9.0 mg/mL sodium chloride, 7.35 mg/mL sodium citrate dihydrate, 0.7 mg/mL polysorbate 80, and Sterile Water for Injection.  The pH is adjusted to 6.5. 
Rituximab vials should be stored refrigerated between 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).  Vials should 
be protected from light. 
Rituximab prescribing information can be found at 
http://www.gene.com/download/pdf/rituxan_prescribing.pdf  
5.3 Dosage and Administration 
Below are specific administration instructions for the agents used within this study.  Subjects 
with an increased risk of TLS should be carefully monitored and treated per institutional standards, as appropriate.
Ibrutinib  Protocol PCYC-1125-CA - Amendment 3.0 
IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 33  5.3.1 Ibrutinib 
Ibrutinib 560 mg (4 x 140-mg capsules) is administered orally once daily with 8 ounces 
(approximately 240 mL) of water.  The capsules should be swallowed intact and subjects should not attempt to open capsules or dissolve them in water.  On the days when subjects receive both ibrutinib and rituximab, ibrutinib will be administered first and rituximab will be infused within 30 min of the ibrutinib dose.  The use of strong CYP3A inhibitors/inducers, and grapefruit and Seville oranges should be avoided for the duration of the study ( Appendix 4 ). 
Ibrutinib dosing is continuous (without interruption) throughout the treatment phase.  If a dose of 
ibrutinib is missed, it can be taken as soon as possible on the same day with a return to the normal schedule the following day.  No extra capsules to make up missed doses of ibrutinib should be taken. 
If rituximab dosing is delayed for toxicity that does not require ibrutinib to be held for toxicity, 
dosing should continue at the investigator’s discretion.  If a rituximab infusion is delayed due to scheduling delays, ibrutinib dosing should continue.  
Ibrutinib will be dispensed to subjects in bottles.  All doses of ibrutinib taken in the clinic should 
be taken from the bottle dispensed to the subject.  Unused ibrutinib capsules dispensed during previous visits must be returned to the site and drug accountability records ( Section 11.8 ) must 
be updated.  Returned capsules must not be re-dispensed to anyone.  Subjects should return all used bottles to the site when they receive new study drug.  For the purpose of drug accountability, empty bottles and returned capsules should be kept at the site until after the review of the site monitor if allowed by local institution policy. 
Investigators are prohibited from supplying ibrutinib capsules to any subjects not properly 
enrolled in this study or to any physicians or scientists except those designated as Subinvestigators on Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Form 1572.  The investigator must 
ensure that subjects receive ibrutinib capsules only from personnel who fully understand the 
procedures for administering the drug. 
Treatment will continue until disease progression or other reason for treatment discontinuation as 
outlined in Section 8.2 .  
Dose modifications for toxicity are outlined in Section 5.4.  
5.3.2 Rituximab 
Rituximab is given at 375 mg/m
2 IV infusion once weekly for 4 doses. 
Since rituximab, given either as a single agent or in combination, is currently a recommended 
therapy for subjects with previously untreated FL per the NCCN guidelines, the costs for administering rituximab are expected to be covered by the individual subject’s insurance.  
Ibrutinib  Protocol PCYC-1125-CA - Amendment 3.0 
IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 34  Per Prescribing Information:  
First Infusion:  The rituximab solution for infusion should be administered intravenously at an 
initial rate of 50 mg/hr.  Rituximab should not be mixed or diluted with other drugs. 
If hypersensitivity or infusion reactions do not occur, the infusion rate may be escalated in 
50 mg/hr increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/hr.  If a hypersensitivity (non-IgE-mediated) or an infusion reaction develops, the infusion should be temporarily slowed or interrupted.  The infusion can continue at one-half the previous rate upon improvement of subject symptoms. 
Subsequent Infusions:  If the subject tolerated the first infusion well, subsequent rituximab 
infusions can be administered at an initial rate of 100 mg/hr, and increased by 100 mg/hr increments at 30-minute intervals, to a maximum of 400 mg/hr as tolerated.  If the subject did not tolerate the first infusion well, follow the guidelines for the first infusion. 
Some individual subjects may require close monitoring during the first and all subsequent 
infusions, eg subjects who have pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary conditions, prior clinically significant cardiopulmonary AEs or high numbers of circulating malignant cells ( 25,000/mm
3) 
with or without evidence of high tumor burden. 
5.4 Dose Reduction, Delay and Discontinuation 
5.4.1 Ibrutinib 
The ibrutinib dose should be held for any unmanageable, potentially ibrutinib-related toxicity 
that is consistent with the rules outlined in this section.   
Please see Section 10.2.4  for reporting of major hemorrhage and intracranial hemorrhage 
(Section 10.2.4.1 ). 
The action in Table 1  should be taken for the following ibrutinib-related toxicities: 
xGrade 4 ANC (<500/ μL) for more than 7 days.  The use of neutrophil growth factors is 
permitted per American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines ( Smith 2006 ) and 
must be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF). 
xGrade 3 thrombocytopenia (<50,000/ μL) for subjects with normal platelet count at baseline; 
or for subjects with baseline thrombocytopenia, a platelet decrease of 50% to 74% from 
baseline in the presence of >Grade 2 bleeding 
xGrade 4 thrombocytopenia (<25,000/ μL) for subjects with normal platelet count at baseline; 
or for subjects with baseline thrombocytopenia, a platelet decrease of 75% from baseline or 
<20,000/μL, whichever is higher 
xGrade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea if persistent, despite optimal anti-emetic and/or 
anti-diarrheal therapy 
Ibrutinib  Protocol PCYC-1125-CA - Amendment 3.0 
IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 35  xAny other Grade 4 toxicity or unmanageable Grade 3 toxicity. 
For Grade 3 or 4 atrial fibrillation or persistent atrial fibrillation of any grade, consider the risks 
and benefits of ibrutinib treatment.  If clinically indicated, the use of anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents may be considered for the thromboprophylaxis of atrial fibrillation (Section 6.1.2.4 ).  
Table 1: Dose Modification for Ibrutinib Toxicity 
Occurrence Action to be Taken 
First Withhold ibrutinib until recovery to Grade 1 or baseline; may restart at original dose 
level 
Second Withhold ibrutinib until recovery to Grade 1 or baseline; may restart at 1 dose level 
lower (420 mg per day) 
Third Withhold ibrutinib until recovery to Grade 1 or baseline; may restart at 1 dose level 
lower (280 mg per day) 
Fourth Discontinue ibrutinib 
At the investigator’s discretion, the dose of ibrutinib may be re-escalated after a dose reduction 
in the absence of a recurrence of the toxicity that led to the reduction.  Study treatment should be discontinued in the event of a toxicity lasting more than 28 days, unless reviewed and approved by the Medical Monitor. 
In the event that the investigator feels deviation from the recommendations above is required, 
please consult the Medical Monitor to discuss for approval. 
Please see Section 6.1.2.1  for guidelines for management of ibrutinib in subjects who require 
treatment with a strong CYP3A inhibitor.  
Dose modifications of ibrutinib must be recorded in the eCRF. 
5.4.1.1 Dose Modification for Hepatic Impaired Subjects 
Ibrutinib is metabolized in the liver.  For subjects who develop mild liver impairment while on 
study (Child-Pugh class A), the recommended dose reduction for ibrutinib is to a level of 280 mg 
daily (two capsules).  For subjects who develop moderate liver impairment while on study 
(Child-Pugh class B), the recommended dose reduction is to a level of 140 mg daily (one capsule).  Subjects who develop severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) must hold study drug until resolved to moderate impairment (Child-Pugh class B) or better.  Monitor subjects for signs of toxicity and follow dose modification guidance as needed (Refer to Appendix  6). 
5.4.2 Rituximab 
At the investigator’s discretion, the rituximab dose should be held for any unmanageable, 
potentially rituximab-related toxicity that is consistent with the rules outlined in this section.  
Ibrutinib  Protocol PCYC-1125-CA - Amendment 3.0 
IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 36  A missed dose of rituximab on the weekly schedule for any reason will not be made up (the visit 
window for this visit is ± 2 days).  Upon recovery as outlined in Section 5.4 , subjects should 
resume the protocol-specified treatment schedule as soon as possible.   
The dose of rituximab should be modified according to the dose modification guidelines in 
Table 2 if any Grade 4 or unmanageable Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity attributed to rituximab occurs. 
Table 2: Dose Modification for Rituximab Toxicity 
Occurrence Action to be Taken 
First, Second, 
Third Withhold rituximab until recovery to Grade 1 or baseline; may restart at original 
dose level 
Fourth Discontinue rituximab 
Dose modifications of rituximab must be recorded in the eCRF. 
5.5 Overdose Instructions 
Any dose of study drug administered in excess of that specified in this protocol is considered to 
be an overdose.  Signs and symptoms of an overdose that meet any SAE criterion must be reported as a SAE in the appropriate time frame and documented as clinical sequelae to an 
overdose.  
There is no specific experience in the management of ibrutinib overdose in patients.  No 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached in the Phase 1 study in which subjects received up to 12.5 mg/kg/day (1400 mg/day).  Healthy subjects were exposed up to single dose of 1680 mg.  One healthy subject experienced reversible Grade 4 hepatic enzyme increases (AST and ALT) after a dose of 1680 mg.  Subjects who ingested more than the recommended dosage should be closely monitored and given appropriate supportive treatment. 
Refer to Section 10.2  for further information regarding AE reporting. 
5.6 Criteria for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug 
Investigators are encouraged to keep a subject who is experiencing clinical benefit in the study 
unless significant toxicity puts the subject at risk or routine noncompliance puts the study outcomes at risk.  For a complete list of criteria for permanent discontinuation of study treatment, refer to Section 8.2 . 
Subjects who withdraw for any reason other than those specified in Section 8.2 will not be 
replaced.  A Safety Follow-up visit ( Section 7.1.3.1 ) is required for all subjects except for those 
subjects who have withdrawn full consent.

6.1 Concomitant Medications 
6.1.1 Permitted Concomitant Medications 
Supportive medications in accordance with standard practice (such as for emesis, diarrhea, etc.) 
are permitted.  Use of neutrophil growth factors (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], eg, filgrastim and pegfilgrastim) and red blood cell growth factors (erythropoietin) are permitted per institutional policy and in accordance with ASCO guidelines ( Smith 2006 ). Transfusions may 
be given in accordance with institutional policy. 
Short courses of corticosteroids ( 14 days) as treatment for non-cancer-related medical reasons 
(eg, joint inflammation, asthma exacerbation, rash, antiemetic use, arthritis, asthma, autoimmune cytopenia, and infusion reactions) at doses that do not exceed 100 mg per day of prednisone or equivalent are permitted. 
6.1.2 Medications to be Used with Caution 
6.1.2.1 CYP3A Inhibitors/Inducers 
Ibrutinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4.  Avoid co-administration with strong CYP3A4 
(eg, ketoconazole, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, clarithromycin, telithromycin, itraconazole, and nefazadone) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors and consider alternative agents with less CYP3A inhibition.  If a strong CYP3A inhibitor must be used, the Medical Monitor should be consulted before use, reduce ibrutinib dose to 140 mg or withhold treatment temporarily.  Subjects should be monitored for signs of ibrutinib toxicity.  If a moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be used, reduce ibrutinib to 140 mg for the duration of the inhibitor use.  No dose adjustment is required in combination with mild inhibitors.  Avoid grapefruit and Seville oranges during ibrutinib treatment, as these contain moderate inhibitors of CYP3A (see Section 5.3.1 ). 
Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers (eg, rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and 
St. John’s Wort).  Consider alternative agents with less CYP3A induction.   
For subjects who must take strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors while on treatment with 
ibrutinib, additional PK blood samples during concomitant use of ibrutinib with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors will be requested for ibrutinib exposure confirmation (see Section 7.3.21 ). 
A list of common CYP3A inhibitors and inducers is provided in Appendix 4 ; a 
comprehensive list of inhibitors, inducers, and substrates may be found at http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main-table.  This website is continually revised and should be checked frequently for updates. 
For the most comprehensive effect of CYP3A inhibitors or inducers on ibrutinib exposure, please 
refer to the current version of the IB. 
Ibrutinib  Protocol PCYC-1125-CA - Amendment 3.0 
IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 38  6.1.2.2 Drugs That May Have Their Plasma Concentrations Altered by Ibrutinib 
In vitro studies indicated that ibrutinib is not a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), but is a mild 
inhibitor (with an IC 50 of 2.15 ȝg/mL).  Ibrutinib is not expected to have systemic drug-drug 
interactions with P-gp substrates.  However, it cannot be excluded that ibrutinib could inhibit intestinal P-gp after a therapeutic dose.  There is no clinical data available.  Therefore, to avoid a potential interaction in the GI tract, narrow therapeutic range P-gp substrates such as digoxin should be taken at least 6 hours before or after ibrutinib.  
6.1.2.3 QT Prolongation 
Any medications known to cause QT prolongation should be used with caution; periodic ECG 
and electrolyte monitoring should be considered. 
6.1.2.4 Antiplatelet Agents and Anticoagulant 
Warfarin or vitamin K antagonists should not be administered concomitantly with ibrutinib.  
Supplements such as fish oil and vitamin E preparations should be avoided.  Ibrutinib should be used with caution in subjects requiring other anticoagulants or medications that inhibit platelet function.  Subjects with congenital bleeding diathesis have not been studied.  For guidance on ibrutinib and the use of anticoagulants during procedures/surgeries, see Section 6.2 . 
6.1.3 Prohibited Concomitant Medications 
Chemotherapy, anticancer immunotherapy, experimental therapy, or radiotherapy (except as 
stated under the permitted concomitant medications) are prohibited while the subject is receiving ibrutinib. 
Corticosteroids for the treatment of the underlying disease are prohibited.  Corticosteroids for the 
treatment of non-cancer related reasons for longer than 14 days and/or at doses >100 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent are prohibited. 
The Sponsor must be notified in advance (or as soon as possible thereafter) of any instances in 
which prohibited therapies are administered. 
6.2 Guidelines for Ibrutinib Management with Surgeries or Procedures 
Ibrutinib may increase risk of bleeding with invasive procedures or surgery.  The following 
guidance should be applied to the use of ibrutinib in the perioperative period for subjects who require surgical intervention or an invasive procedure while receiving ibrutinib: 
xFor any surgery or invasive procedure requiring sutures or staples for closure, ibrutinib 
should be held at least 7 days prior to the intervention and should be held at least 7 days after the procedure and restarted at the discretion of the investigator when the surgical site is reasonably healed without serosanguineous drainage or the need for drainage tubes.   
Ibrutinib  Protocol PCYC-1125-CA - Amendment 3.0 
IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 39  xFor minor procedures (such as a central line placement, needle biopsy, thoracentesis, 
or paracentesis) ibrutinib should be held for at least 3 days prior to the procedure and should 
not be restarted for at least 3 days after the procedure.  For bone marrow biopsies that are performed while the subject is on ibrutinib, it is not necessary to hold ibrutinib for these procedures.   
xFor emergency procedures, ibrutinib should be held after the procedure until the surgical site 
is reasonably healed, for at least 7 days after the urgent surgical procedure. 
7. STUDY PROCEDURES
Before study entry, throughout the study, and at the follow-up evaluation, various clinical and 
diagnostic laboratory evaluations are outlined.  The purpose of obtaining these detailed measurements is to ensure adequate safety and tolerability assessments.  Clinical evaluations and 
laboratory studies may be repeated more frequently if clinically indicated.  The Schedules of 
Assessments for Arms 1 and 2 are provided in Appendix 1  and Appendix 2 .  
7.1 Visit Procedures

the subject exhibits disease progression (on or up to 7 days prior to study visit) 
Arm 2:  At Week 9, Week 20, and then every 12 weeks for 6 assessments after Week 20, and 
then every 24 weeks until the subject exhibits disease progression (on or up to 7 days prior to study visit) 
The following procedures will be performed in conjunction with standard visits as follows: 
xRadiologic exam by CT or MRI scan 
xPET (repeat to confirm CR if positive at screening, PET will only be done to confirm CR and 
will not be required thereafter)  
xBone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate for MRD analysis (repeat to confirm CR if positive at 
screening) and possibly for other biomarkers  
xOverall response assessment

7.1.3.1 Safety Follow-up 
A Safety Follow-up visit should occur 30 days (±7 days) from the last dose of study drug or 
prior to the start of a new anticancer treatment.  If the subject starts a new anticancer treatment less than 7 days after the treatment termination visit, only those procedures not conducted at the treatment termination visit should be performed at the Safety Follow-up visit.  
Subjects who withdraw consent to treatment may still participate in Safety Follow-up.  
The following procedures will be performed at the Safety Follow-up visit: 
xComplete physical exam  
xECOG Performance Status 
xVital signs and weight 
x12-lead ECG (in triplicate [ 1 minute apart]) 
xClinical laboratory tests for:

7.1.3.2 Response Follow-Up 
Subjects who discontinue the study for reasons other than PD will be followed every 12 weeks 
(±7 days) from last CT or MRI scan until PD or use of alternative antineoplastic therapy, up to 3 years after the first dose of the last subject enrolled.  During this period, scans will be done per investigator discretion. 
7.1.3.3 Survival Follow-Up 
Once subjects progress or start use of alternative antineoplastic therapy (for subjects who have 
not withdrawn consent), they will be contacted approximately every 12 weeks (±7 days) from last dose by clinic visit or telephone to assess survival and the use of alternative antineoplastic therapy and stem cell transplant, up to 3 years after the last dose of the last subject enrolled. Subjects will be contacted until death, subject withdrawal, lost to follow-up, or study termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first.

Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 50  7.2 Missed Evaluations 
Missed evaluations should be rescheduled and performed as close to the original scheduled date 
as possible.  An exception is made when rescheduling becomes, in the investigator’s opinion, medically unnecessary or unsafe because it is too close in time to the next scheduled evaluation. In that case, the missed evaluation should be abandoned. 
7.3 Description of Procedures   
7.3.1 Medical History 
The subject’s complete history through review of medical records and by interview will be 
collected and recorded.  Concurrent medical signs and symptoms must be documented to establish baseline severities.  A disease history, including the date of initial diagnosis will be recorded.  Smoking history and alcohol use will also be recorded. 
7.3.2 Physical Examination 
The physical examination will include, at a minimum, the general appearance of the subject, 
examination of the skin, eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, extremities and lymphatic system.  The musculoskeletal system and nervous system may be included in the examination if clinically indicated. 
7.3.3 B-symptoms
The subject will be asked about the occurrence of B-symptoms at Screening and at every 
Response Evaluation Visit.  At Screening, collection of B-symptoms will include unexplained weight loss >10% within the last 6 months, unexplained fever >38°C for at least 3 consecutive days within the last 3 months, and drenching night sweats within the last 3 months.  At every Response Evaluation Visit, collection of B-symptoms will include unexplained weight loss >10% within the last month, unexplained fever >38°C for at least 3 consecutive days within the last month, and drenching night sweats within the last month.  Any new or worsening of a 
pre-existing B-symptom should be recorded as an AE. 
7.3.4 Vital Signs, Height and Weight 
Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature) will be assessed 
after the subject has rested in the sitting position for approximately 3 minutes.   
Height (screening only) and weight will also be collected. 
7.3.5 ECOG Performance Status 
The ECOG performance index is provided in Appendix 3 . 
Ibrutinib  Protocol PCYC-1125-CA - Amendment 3.0 
IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 51  7.3.6 Electrocardiogram 
ECGs should be performed at the investigator’s discretion, particularly in subjects with 
arrhythmic symptoms (eg, palpitations, lightheadedness) or new onset dyspnea. 
Subjects should be in supine position and resting for at least 10 minutes before study-related 
ECGs.  During visits in which both ECGs and blood draws are performed, it is recommended that ECGs are performed first. 
At Screening and at Safety Follow-up, 12-lead ECGs will be done in triplicate ( 1 minute apart); 
the calculated QTc average of the 3 ECGs must be <470 msec for eligibility.  
7.3.7 Prior/Concomitant Medications 
All prior/concomitant medications (including over-the-counter, supplements, and herbal 
products) and procedures will be collected from Screening or from 14 days before the start of study drug, whichever is longer, through the Safety Follow-up visit. 
7.3.8 Adverse Events 
All AEs whether serious or non-serious, will be documented in the source documents from the 
time signed and dated ICF is obtained until 30 days following the last dose of study drug.  Only SAEs will be reported to the Sponsor prior to the first dose of study drug.  From the first dose of study drug, AEs/SAEs will be recorded in the eCRFs and will continue until 30 days after the last dose of study drug.  
Laboratory abnormalities which result in signs and symptoms, require intervention or follow-up 
and are considered clinically significant should be recorded as AEs.  AEs will be recorded at each visit or as reported during the treatment period. 
7.3.9 CT/MRI and PET Scans 
A CT scan (with contrast unless contraindicated) of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and any 
other disease sites and a PET scan are required for the pretreatment tumor assessment.  
In the case where CT with contrast is contraindicated, an alternative would be MRI of the 
abdomen and pelvis and CT of the chest and neck without contrast.  In this case, neck nodes cannot be used as target lesions. 
NOTE :  PET/CT hybrid scanners may be used to acquire the required CT images only if the CT 
produced by the scanner is of diagnostic quality, adheres to the specified slice thickness/scan parameters, and includes the use of IV contrast.  Also, the CT images must be separated from the PET data prior to submitting the data, and cannot be transmitted as fused CT/PET images.  
Ibrutinib  Protocol PCYC-1125-CA - Amendment 3.0 
IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 52  If using a hybrid machine to acquire both PET and CT, the PET must be performed prior to the 
CT with IV contrast as to not compromise PET results.  
If independent CT and PET scanners are used, and the subject is receiving both scans on the 
same day, the PET must be performed prior to the CT with IV contrast. 
The same radiographic technique used for a subject’s pretreatment tumor assessment should be 
used throughout the course of the study and should be mentioned in each radiology report.  The same imaging equipment should be used for all scans, whenever possible. 
Following the pretreatment tumor assessments, CT/MRI should be performed as per schedule of 
assessments (or more often if clinically indicated) and repeat PET scanning will only be required to confirm CR and
 will be performed only if it was positive at Screening.  PET will only be done 
to confirm CR and will not be required thereafter. 
De-identified copies of all scans and radiology reports (including those from screening) must be 
provided to the Sponsor or designee (eg, central imaging vendor).  At the Sponsor’s discretion, the Sponsor or its designee may conduct an independent review of the investigator responses. 
7.3.10 Response Assessment 
Response assessments will be completed by the investigator using Cheson 2007 .  At Screening, 
up to six target lesions will be selected and will be followed for the duration of the study.  All target lesions must be followed and mentioned in the radiology report at all subsequent response assessments (see Appendix 5 ). 
Information on extranodal involvement (eg, gastric or ocular disease) will also be recorded.  
Lesions in anatomical locations that are not well visualized by CT may be measured by MRI instead. 
Caution must be exercised not to confuse a possible tumor flare with progressive disease.  
Delayed responses after a tumor flare have been reported in follicular lymphoma.  In order to 
accommodate the potential for immune flare (pseudoprogression), treatment with ibrutinib may 
continue between the initial assessment and confirmation of progression.  In the absence of clinically significant deterioration, a biopsy (if lesion is assessable) should be performed at the time of suspected tumor flare (in order to rule out tumor necrosis and/or an inflammatory reaction) or the investigator may continue dosing and a CT/MRI scan and/or biopsy should be performed at least 4 weeks later to confirm PD.  Subjects with presumed progressive disease who, in the Investigator’s opinion, continue to receive clinical benefit from their treatment may continue to receive ibrutinib as dictated in the protocol after consultation with the Sponsor and at the Investigator’s discretion.  Ibrutinib should be discontinued if there is confirmed progressive disease per Cheson 2007  criteria or other clinical data suggest clear evidence of progression.  
such a case, the date of PD will be documented as the evaluation where PD was first suspected.

Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 56  8. SUBJECT COMPLETION AND WITHDRAWAL
8.1 Completion 
A subject will be considered to have completed the study if he or she has died before the end of 
the study, has not been lost to follow up, or has not withdrawn consent before the end of study. 
8.2 Treatment Discontinuation 
Study treatment will be discontinued in the event of any of the following events: 
xConfirmed PD 
xUnacceptable toxicity: an intercurrent illness or AE that prevents further ibrutinib 
administration  
xTreatment discontinuation by subject 
xInvestigator decision (such as significant protocol deviation, or best interest of the subject) 
xSubject is significantly or routinely noncompliant with the study procedures and/or 
scheduled evaluations 
xSubject requires a prohibited concomitant medication 
xStudy termination by Sponsor 
xSubject becomes pregnant 
All subjects, regardless of reason for discontinuation of study treatment will undergo a treatment 
termination visit and be followed for progression and survival.  
It is recommended that the Investigator notifies the Sponsor prior to discontinuing a subject due 
to any reason. If a subject will be discontinued due to disease progression, the Investigator should provide documentation of disease progression for review by the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor.  If a subject shows signs of disease progression on physical examination or laboratory assessment, the subject may continue study treatment until disease progression is confirmed.  These subjects should stay in the study to be followed for survival.  
8.3 Study Exit/Withdrawal 
Exit from study (including all follow-up) will occur under the following circumstances: 
xWithdrawal of consent for follow-up observation by the subject 
xLost to follow-up 
xStudy termination by Sponsor 
xDeath

IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 57  If a subject is lost to follow-up, every reasonable effort should be made by the study site 
personnel to contact the subject.  The measures taken to follow up should be documented. 
When a subject withdraws before completing the study, the following information should be 
documented in the source documents: 
xReason for withdrawal; 
xWhether the subject withdraws full consent (i e, withdraws consent to treatment and all 
further contact) or partial consent (ie, withdraws consent to treatment but agrees to 
participate in follow-up visits) 
9. STATISTICAL METHODS 
9.1 General Considerations 
This is an open-label, Phase 2 study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib 
combined with rituximab in previously untreated subjects with FL.  The study will include 
approximately 80 subjects with two treatment arms, a main study Arm 1 with n=~60 subjects and 
an exploratory Arm 2 with n=~20 subjects.  
For the primary and secondary objectives, Arm 1 and Arm 2 will be analyzed separately. 
One of the purposes of Arm 2 is to identify biomarkers that predict sensitivity or resistance to 
ibrutinib.  Based on Phase 1 clinical data in FL it is predicted that approximately half of the subjects treated in this arm will show evidence of resistance to single-agent ibrutinib.  By providing a lead-in time prior to the initiation of rituximab, pre- and post-progression biopsy samples can be collected to address markers of drug resistance.  These objectives are exploratory and therefore the primary and secondary objectives related to clinical efficacy are paramount but will be analyzed separately from Arm 1 since the treatment regimen in this arm is different. 
9.1.1 Response Assessment 
Response assessments will be done by the investigators.  The response criteria are based on the 
revised criteria for malignant lymphoma described in the revised International Working Group for NHL ( Cheson 2007 ). 
9.1.2 Safety Monitoring 
The study's investigators and data coordinators are responsible for entering the data and safety of 
this study, including implementation of the stopping rules for efficacy. 
All sites are required to use the eCRFs provided by the study sponsor.  All sites will be 
monitored on an ongoing basis by the study sponsor. 
Ibrutinib  Protocol PCYC-1125-CA - Amendment 3.0 
IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 58  Safety data is monitored in accordance with the sponsor's Pharmacoviligance Committee 
procedures.  AEs and SAEs will be reviewed internally on an ongoing basis to identify safety concerns. 
9.2 Definition of Analysis Populations 
The following definitions will be used for the efficacy and safety analysis sets: 
xAll-Treated Population:   The subjects who are enrolled in the study and have received at 
least 1 dose of study drug. 
xResponse-Evaluable Population:   The subjects in the all treated population who have 
measurable disease at baseline and have at least one adequate post-treatment disease assessment by investigator before the start of subsequent anti-cancer therapy.   
xSafety Analysis Population:   All enrolled subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug 
(same as all treated population).   
The all treated population will be used for analyzing efficacy endpoints unless specified 
otherwise, the response evaluable population will be used for sensitivity analysis of efficacy endpoints and the safety population will be used for safety analysis. 
9.3 Endpoint Data Analysis 
9.3.1 Demographic/Baseline Characteristics and Study Conduct 
Subject demographics (including age, sex, and race/ethnicity) and other baseline characteristics 
(including ECOG performance status, disease burd en, and number of prior therapies) will be 
summarized by study arm.  Summary statistics will include means, standard deviations, and medians for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables. 
Further, compliance parameters (including number of doses taken compared with number of 
doses that should have been taken), the reason for discontinuation, and concurrent treatments will also be similarly summarized.   
9.3.2 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the overall response rate (CR+PR) as assessed by investigators 
for Arm 1 and Arm 2 separately.  The ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve either a PR or CR as best response as assessed by investigators according to the revised 
International Working Group Criteria for NHL.  Overall response rate will be calculated for the 
all-treated population for Arm 1 and Arm 2 separately.  The corresponding 95% two-sided confidence intervals will be derived.   
Ibrutinib  Protocol PCYC-1125-CA - Amendment 3.0 
IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 59  9.3.2.1 Analysis Methods for Arm 1 
The primary analysis for all efficacy endpoints will be conducted based on the all treated 
population.  The all treated population is defined as the subjects who are enrolled in the study and have received at least 1 dose of study treatment.  Subjects with no evaluable response will be considered non-responder. 
The ORR and its 95% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated using normal approximation to 
the binomial distribution using Wilson’s score method.  If the lower bound of the CI around the ORR is greater than or equal to 53%, then it will be concluded that the ORR of the treatment regimen of Arm 1 is superior to the ORR of 53% given by historical control.  
9.3.2.2 Analysis Methods for Arm 2 
The ORR and its 95% confidence interval will be calculated using normal approximation to the 
binomial distribution using Wilson’s score method.  Subjects with no evaluable post-baseline response will be considered as non-responder.   
9.3.3 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
9.3.3.1 Duration of Response
For subjects achieving overall response as assessed by investigators, their duration of response as 
assessed by investigators will be calculated to de termine durability.  Duration of response will be 
measured from the time by which the measurement criteria are met for CR or PR, whichever is recorded first, until death or the first date by which recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  Subjects who had the event after the start of subsequent therapy, or are progression-free and alive at the time of clinical cut-off, or have unknown status will be censored at the last tumor assessment on or before the start of subsequent therapy and clinical cut-off time.  Subjects with no post-baseline disease assessment will be censored on Day 1. 
Data from responders will include subjects who achieve CR or PR based on the revised 
International Working Group Criteria for NHL response criteria ( Cheson 2007 ).  Non-responders 
will be excluded from the analysis for DOR.  Duration of response will be calculated using assessments by investigators and by study arm.  Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate event-free curves, median and 95% CI of median. 
9.3.3.2 Progression-free Survival  
Progression-free survival will be measured as time from first study drug administration to the 
first occurrence of lymphoma progression or death from any cause. 
Ibrutinib  Protocol PCYC-1125-CA - Amendment 3.0 
IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 60  Data for subjects without disease progression or death will be censored at the date of the last 
tumor assessment that occurs before the initiation of alternative anticancer therapy.  The estimates will be formed using the all treated population. 
Progression-free survival will be calculated using assessments by investigators by study arm. 
Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate event-free curves median and 95% CI of median. 
9.3.3.3 Overall Survival 
The duration of OS will be measured from the time of first study drug administration until the 
date of death.  Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate overall survival curves and corresponding quartiles (including the median).   
Data for subjects who have not died or have exited from the study at the time of clinical-cutoff 
will be censored at the date of the last known contact.  The estimates will be formed using the all treated population. 
9.3.4 Safety Analysis 
Analysis of safety data will be conducted on the safety population, which includes enrolled 
subjects who receive at least 1 dose of ibrutinib.  Safety summaries will include tabulations in the form of tables and listings.  The frequency (number and percentage) of treatment-emergent AEs will be reported by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA
®) System 
Organ Class and Preferred Term.  Additional AE summaries will include AE frequency by AE severity and by relationship to study drug. 
AEs requiring discontinuation of study drug will be summarized separately, both overall and by 
AE severity and by relationship to study drug. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values will be summarized.  Laboratory shift tables 
containing counts and percentages will be prepared by laboratory parameter.  Summary tables 
will be prepared for each laboratory parameter.  Figures of changes in laboratory parameters over 
time will be generated. 
Safety:   Missing or partial start and end dates for AEs and concomitant medications will be 
imputed according to pre-specified imputation rules.  The rule will be described in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  No other imputation of values for missing data will be performed. 
9.3.5 Pharmacokinetics
Plasma concentrations of ibrutinib and metabolite, for example PCI-45227, will be determined 
using a validated analytical method.  Other potential metabolites of ibrutinib may be explored. 
Ibrutinib  Protocol PCYC-1125-CA - Amendment 3.0 
IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 61  xBioanalytical data from this study will be used in noncompartmental PK analysis and also 
may be combined with data from other studies performed with ibrutinib in subjects with 
hematologic malignancies as part of a population PK analysis using nonlinear mixed effects models.  For the population PK analysis, covariates that could potentially correlate with plasma PK parameters will be evaluated.  Pharmacokinetic relationships to pharmacodynamic measures of efficacy or toxicity may also be explored.  
xFor subjects who received CYP3A inhibitors, as data permits, a comparison of ibrutinib and 
PCI-45227 plasma concentrations after ibrutinib administration alone and in combination with CYP3A inhibitors will be explored. 
9.3.6 Exploratory Analyses 
xChange in peripheral T/B/NK count and profiling of immunophenotypes 
xChange in secreted protein levels (ie, chemokines, cytokines, growth factors) 
xIdentification of biomarkers that predict sensitivity or resistance to ibrutinib 
(ie, GEP, WES, etc.) 
Clinically relevant biomarkers may be associated with clinical responses.  A Fisher Exact test or 
other methods may be used to estimate the association between the clinical response rates and 
each biomarker. 
The SAP will provide additional analysis details. 
9.4 Handling of Missing Data 
General Considerations:   Subjects lost to follow-up (or who dropped out) will be included in 
statistical analyses up to the point of their last evaluation or contact. 
Duration of Response and Progression-free Survival:   Data for subjects without disease 
progression or death will be censored at the date of the last tumor assessment and before the date of the initiation of alternative anticancer therapy.  Data for subjects who had the event after the start of subsequent therapy, or are progression-free and alive at the time of the clinical data cut-off, or have unknown status will be censored at the last tumor assessment on or before the start of subsequent therapy or clinical cut-off time.  Subjects with no post-baseline disease assessment will be censored on Day 1. 
Overall Survival:   Data for subjects who have not died will be censored at the date of the last 
study evaluation or contact when subjects are known to be alive. 
Safety:   Missing or partial start and end dates for AEs and concomitant medications will be 
imputed according to prespecified, conservative imputation rules and will be pre-defined in a SAP.  No other imputation of values for missing data will be performed.

IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 62  9.5 Determination of Sample Size 
The planned sample size for this open-label, Phase 2 study is N=60 subjects which will be 
enrolled in Arm 1; 20 additional subjects will be enrolled in Arm 2.  The hypotheses test of primary endpoint analysis for Arm 1 in this study assumes an underlying response rate of 53% for first-line rituximab treatment in subjects with low grade FL ( Hainsworth 2002 ; Freedman 2009 ).  
A sample size of approximately 60 eligible subjects is needed to exclude a 53% response rate at the 1-sided 0.025 significance level with at least 80% power. 
9.6 Interim Analysis 
No interim analysis is planned.   
9.7 Analysis for Study Report 
The analyses for the Clinical Study Report (CSR) will occur at least 1 year after the last subject 
enrolled  received the first dose of study drug.  Analysis methods will be provided in the SAP. 
10. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of safety information from clinical studies 
are crucial for the protection of subjects, investigators, and the Sponsor, and are mandated by regulatory agencies worldwide.  The Sponsor has established Standard Operating Procedures in conformity with regulatory requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of safety information; all clinical studies conducted by the Sponsor or its affiliates will be conducted in accordance with those procedures. 
10.1 Adverse Event Definitions and Classifications 
10.1.1 Adverse Events 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product 
and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug ( ICH-E2A, 1995 ).  
For the purposes of this clinical study, AEs include events which are either new or represent 
detectable exacerbations of pre-existing conditions.  
The term “disease progression” should not be reported as an AE term. As an example, "worsening 
of underlying disease" or the clinical diagnosis that is associated with disease progression should be reported. 
AEs may include, but are not limited to: 
Ibrutinib  Protocol PCYC-1125-CA - Amendment 3.0 
IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 63  xSubjective or objective symptoms spontaneously offered by the subject and/or observed by 
the investigator or study staff including laboratory abnormalities of clinical significance. 
xAny AEs experienced by the subject after the ICF is signed and for 30 days following the 
last dose of study drug. 
xAEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the protocol-specified AE 
reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with FL that were not present 
before the AE reporting period. 
xComplications that occur as a result of protocol-mandated interventions (eg, invasive 
procedures such as biopsies). 
The following are NOT considered an AE: 
xPre-existing Condition:   A pre-existing condition (documented on the medical history 
eCRF) is not considered an AE unless the severity, frequency, or character of the event worsens during the study period. 
xPre-planned or Elective Hospitalization:   A hospitalization planned before signing the 
ICF is not considered an SAE, but rather a therapeutic intervention.  However, if during the 
pre-planned hospitalization an event occurs, which prolongs the hospitalization or meets any other SAE criteria, the event will be considered an SAE.  Surgeries or interventions that were under consideration, but not performed before enrollment in the study, will not be considered serious if they are performed after enrollment in the study for a condition that has not changed from its baseline level.  Elective hospitalizations for social reasons, solely for 
the administration of chemotherapy, or due to long travel distances are also not SAEs. 
xDiagnostic Testing and Procedures:   Testing and procedures should not to be reported as 
AEs or SAEs, but rather the cause for the test or procedure should be reported. 
xAsymptomatic Treatment Related Lymphocytosis:  This event should also not be 
considered an AE.  Patients with treatment-related lymphocytosis should remain on study 
treatment and continue with all study-related procedures. 
10.1.2 Serious Adverse Event 
A SAE based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal Products for 
Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
xResults in death (ie, the AE actually causes or leads to death) 
xIs life-threatening:  “life-threatening” is defi ned as an AE in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe.  If either the investigator or the Sponsor believes that an AE meets the definition of life-threatening, it will be considered life-threatening. 
xRequires in-patient hospitalization >24 hours or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
xResults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (ie, the AE results in substantial 
disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
Ibrutinib  Protocol PCYC-1125-CA - Amendment 3.0 
IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 64  xIs a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
xIs an important medical event that may not result in death, be immediately life-threatening 
or require hospitalization, but may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject, or subject may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency department or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsion that does not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Given that the investigator’s perspective may be informed by having actually observed the event, 
and the Sponsor is likely to have broader knowledge of the drug and its effects to inform its evaluation of the significance of the event, if either the Sponsor or the investigator believes that 
the event is serious, the event will be considered serious. 
10.1.3 Unexpected Adverse Events 
An “unexpected” AE is an AE that is not listed in the Investigator's Brochure/package insert or is 
not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  For example, hepatic necrosis would be “unexpected” (by virtue of greater severity) if the Investigator's Brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be “unexpected” (by virtue of greater specificity) if the Investigator's Brochure/package insert listed only cerebral vascular accidents.  "Unexpected" also refers to AEs that are mentioned in the Investigator's Brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the study drug under investigation. 
10.1.4 Severity Criteria (Grade 1-5) 
Definitions found in the CTCAE (version 4.03) will be used for grading the severity (intensity) 
of AEs.  The CTCAE v4.03 displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each referenced AE.  Should a subject experience any AE not listed in the CTCAE v4.03, the following grading system should be used to assess severity: 
xGrade 1 (Mild AE) – experiences that are usually transient, requiring no special treatment, 
and do not interfere with the subject’s daily activities. 
xGrade 2 (Moderate AE) – experiences that introduce some level of inconvenience or concern 
to the subject, and that may interfere with  daily activities, but are usually ameliorated by 
simple therapeutic measures. 
xGrade 3 (Severe AE) – experiences that are unacceptable or intolerable, significantly 
interrupt the subject’s usual daily activity, and require systemic drug therapy or other 
treatment. 
xGrade 4 (Life-threatening or disabling AE) – experiences that cause the subject to be in 
imminent danger of death. 
Ibrutinib  Protocol PCYC-1125-CA - Amendment 3.0 
IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 65  xGrade 5 (Death related to AE) – experiences that result in subject death. 
10.1.5 Causality (Attribution) 
The investigator is to assess the causal relation (ie, whether there is a reasonable possibility that 
the study drug caused the event) using the following definitions: 
Not Related: Another cause of the AE is more plausible; a temporal sequence cannot be 
established with the onset of the AE and administration of the investigational product; or, a causal relationship is considered biologically implausible. 
Unlikely: The current knowledge or information about the AE indicates that a 
relationship to the investigational product is unlikely.
Possibly Related: There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and 
administration of the investigational product, but the AE could also be attributed to concurrent or underlying disease, or the use of other drugs or procedures.  Possibly related should be used when the investigational product is one of several biologically plausible AE causes. 
Related: The AE is clearly related to use of the investigational product. 
10.2 Documenting and Reporting of Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs that are observed or reported 
during the study, as outlined in the prior sections, are recorded on the eCRF.  All SAEs also must be reported on an SAE Worksheet as outlined in Section 10.2.2.2 .  
10.2.1 Special Reporting Situations 
Safety events of interest on a Sponsor study drug that may require expedited reporting and/or 
safety evaluation include, but are not limited to: 
xOverdose of a study drug 
xSuspected abuse/misuse of a study drug 
xInadvertent or accidental exposure to a study drug 
xMedication error involving a product (with or without subject/patient exposure to the study 
drug, eg, name confusion) 
Special reporting situations should be recorded in the eCRF.  Any special reporting situation that 
meets the criteria of a serious AE should be recorded on the serious AE page of the eCRF.

IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 66  10.2.2 Adverse Event Reporting Procedures 
10.2.2.1 All Adverse Events 
All subjects who receive treatment will be considered evaluable for toxicity.  All serious events 
will be reported from the time a signed and dated ICF is obtained until 30 days following the last dose of study drug.  Any SAEs that occur more than 30 days following the last dose of study drug should also be reported if considered related to study drug. 
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to study drug, must be 
recorded using medical terminology in the source document.  All records will need to capture the details of the duration and the severity of each episode, the action taken with respect to the study drug, investigator’s evaluation of its relationship to the study drug, and the event outcome.  Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology (e.g., cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as "upper respiratory infection").  Investigators must record in the CRF their opinion concerning the relationship of the AE to study therapy.  All measures required for AE management must be recorded in the source document and reported according to Sponsor instructions. 
The Sponsor assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of AEs to the regulatory authorities 
and governing bodies according to the local regulations.  
10.2.2.2 Expedited Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs occurring during the study must be reported to the Sponsor contact person within 
24 hours of knowledge of the event. 
Information regarding SAEs will be transmitted to the Sponsor using the SAE Form/MedWatch 
or Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS), which must be completed by a physician from the study site, and submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours of when the investigator becomes aware of the event.  
All deaths should be reported with the primary cause of death as the AE term, as death is 
typically the outcome of the event, not the event itself.  The primary cause of death on the autopsy report should be the term reported.  Autopsy and postmortem reports must be forwarded to the Sponsor, or designee, as outlined above. 
If a death occurs within 30 days after the last dose of study drug, the death must be reported to 
the Sponsor as a SAE. 
If study drug is discontinued due to an SAE, this information must be included in the SAE 
report. 
Ibrutinib  Protocol PCYC-1125-CA - Amendment 3.0 
IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 67  All SAEs that have not resolved by the end of the study, or that have not resolved upon 
discontinuation of the subject's participation in the study, must be followed until any of the following occurs: 
xThe event resolves 
xThe event stabilizes 
xThe event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available 
xThe event can be attributed to agents other than the study drug or to factors unrelated to 
study conduct 
xIt becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (subject or health care 
practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow up after demonstration of due diligence with follow-up efforts) 
10.2.3 Other Malignancies 
In addition to all routine AE reporting, all new malignant tumors including solid tumors, skin 
malignancies and hematologic malignancies are to be reported for the duration of study treatment 
and during any protocol-specified follow-up periods including post-progression follow-up for 
overall survival. 
10.2.4 Events of Special Interest 
Specific AEs, or groups of AEs, will be followed as part of standard safety monitoring activities 
by the Sponsor.  These events will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of awareness irrespective of seriousness (ie, serious and nonserious AEs) following the procedure described above for serious AEs and will require enhanced data collection.  All Adverse Events of Special 
Interest (AESI) will be submitted from the clinical site to the Sponsor (or designee).  If no 
serious criterion is met, the site should submit the SAE form by selecting the AESI box.  
10.2.4.1 Major Hemorrhage 
Major hemorrhage is defined as any of the following:  
xAny treatment-emergent hemorrhagic AEs of Grade 3 or higher*.   
xAny treatment-emergent serious adverse events of bleeding of any grade 
xAny treatment-emergent central nervous system hemorrhage/hematoma of any grade 
*All hemorrhagic events requiring transfus ion of red blood cells should be reported as Grade 3 or higher AE per 
CTCAE v4.03.  
Events meeting the definition of major hemorrha ge will be captured as an event of special 
interest according to Section 10.2.4  above.

IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 68  10.2.5 Pregnancy
All initial reports of pregnancy must be reported to the Sponsor by the study-site personnel 
within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event using the appropriate pregnancy notification form.  Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and congenital anomaly) are considered serious AEs and must be reported in a timely fashion.  Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must discontinue further study treatment.  Because the effect of the study drug on sperm is unknown, pregnancies in partners of male subjects included in the study will also be reported by the study-site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event using the appropriate pregnancy notification form.  The pregnant female will be followed 
for outcome (elective termination of the pregnanc y, miscarriage, or delivery) only if she provides 
a separate written consent.  For pregnancies with an outcome of live birth, the newborn infant will be followed until 30 days old by completing the Pregnancy Report Form Part II.

IND 102,688  12 September 2016 
Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 71  11.7 Case Report Forms and Record Maintenance 
CRFs will be used to collect the clinical study data and must be completed for each enrolled 
subject with all required study data accurately recorded such that the information matches the data contained in medical records (eg, physicians’ notes, nurses’ notes, clinic charts and other study-specific source documents).  Authorized study site personnel (ie, listed on the Delegation of Authority log) will complete CRFs designed for this study according to the completion guidelines that will be provided.  The Investigator will ensure that the CRFs are accurate, complete, legible, and completed within 5 days of each subject’s visit.  At all times, the Investigator has final responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all clinical data. 
The CRFs exists within an electronic data capture (EDC) system with controlled access managed 
by the Sponsor or its authorized representative for this study.  Study staff will be appropriately trained in the use of CRFs and application of electronic signatures before the start of the study and before being given access to the EDC system.  Original data and any changes of data will be recorded using the EDC system, with all changes tracked by the system and recorded in an electronic audit trail.  The Investigator attests th at the information contained in the CRFs is true 
by providing electronic signature within the EDC system.  After database lock, the Investigator will receive a copy of the subject data (eg, paper, CD, or other appropriate media) for archiving at the study site. 
11.8 Investigational Study Drug Accountability 
Ibrutinib and any comparator used must be kept in a locked limited access room.  The study drug 
must not be used outside the context of the protocol.  Under no circumstances should the Investigator or other site personnel supply ibrutinib or comparator to other Investigators, subjects, or clinics or allow supplies to be used other than as directed by this protocol without prior authorization from the Sponsor. 
Accountability records for ibrutinib and any comparator must be maintained and readily 
available for inspection by representatives of the Sponsor and are open to inspections by regulatory authorities at any time.  
An Investigational Drug Accountability Log must be used for drug accountability.  For accurate 
accountability, the following information must be noted when drug supplies are used during the study: 
1. Study identification number (PCYC-1125-CA) 
2. Subject identification number 3. Lot number(s) of ibrutinib or comparator dispensed for that subject 4. Date and quantity of drug dispensed 5. Any unused drug returned by the subject

product disposal/destruction to ensure that it complies with the Sponsors’ requirements.  If the site cannot meet the Sponsors’ requirements for disposal/destruction, arrangements will be made between the site and the Sponsor or its representative, for return of unused investigational product.  Before disposal/destruction, final drug accountability and reconciliation must be performed by the monitor. 
All study supplies and associated documentation will be regularly reviewed and verified by the 
monitor. 
11.9 Study Monitoring/Audit Requirements 
Representatives of the Sponsor or its designee will monitor this study until completion.  
Monitoring will be conducted through personal visits with the Investigator and site staff, remote monitoring, as well as any appropriate communications by mail, fax, email, or telephone.  The purpose of monitoring is to ensure that the study is conducted in compliance with the protocol, standard operating procedures (SOPs), and other written instructions and regulatory guidelines, and to ensure the quality and integrity of the data .  This study is also subject to reviews or audits. 
To assure the accuracy of data collected in the CRFs, it is mandatory that the monitor/auditor 
have access to all original source documents, including all electronic medical records (EMR) at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice.  During the review of source documents, every effort will be made to maintain the anonymity and confidentiality of all subjects during this clinical study.  However, because of the experimental nature of this treatment, the Investigator agrees to allow the IRB/REB/IEC, representatives of the Sponsor, its designated agents and authorized employees of the appropriate regulatory authority to inspect the facilities used in this study and, for purposes of verification, allow direct access to the hospital or clinic records of all subjects enrolled into this study.  A statement to this effect will be included in the informed 
consent and permission form authorizing the use of protected health information. 
The Sponsor or its authorized representative may perform an audit at any time during or after 
completion of this study.  All study-related documentation must be made available to the designated auditor.  In addition, a representative of the FDA or other regulatory agencies may choose to inspect a study site at any time before, during, or after completion of the clinical study.  In the event of such an inspection, the Sponsor will be available to assist in the preparation.  All pertinent study data should be made available as requested to the regulatory authority for verification, audit, or inspection purposes.

Inhibitors of CYP3A enzymes are defined as follows.  A comprehensive list of inhibitors can be 
found at the following website:  http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main-table/.  The general categorization into strong, moderate, and weak inhibitors according to the website is displayed below.  Refer to Section 6.1.2.1  on instructions for concomitant use of CYP3A 
inhibitors or inducers with ibrutinib. 
Inhibitors of CYP3A Inducers of CYP3A 
Strong Inhibitors:  carbamazepine 
indinavir efavirenz 
nelfinavir nevirapine 
ritonavir barbiturates 
clarithromycin glucocorticoids  
itraconazole modafinil 
ketoconazole oxcarbarzepine 
nefazodone phenobarbital 
saquinavir phenytoin 
telithromycin pioglitazone 
suboxone rifabutin 
cobicistat rifampin 
boceprevir St. John’s Wort 
mibefradil troglitazone 
telaprevir  
troleandomycin  
posaconazole  
Moderate Inhibitors:   
aprepitant  
amprenavir  
amiodarone  
atazanavir  
ciprofloxacin  
crizotinib  
darunavir/ritonavir  
dronedarone

a Based on internal data, 140 mg ibrutin ib dosed with voriconazole produces ibrutinib exposures similar to 560 mg 
ibrutinib dosed alone.  Therefore, for this study, if ib rutinib needs to be administere d with voriconazole, 140 mg 
ibrutinib will be dosed.

Pharmacyclics LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 85  Appendix 5: Guidelines for Establishing Response to Treatment 
Response Definition Nodal Masses* Spleen, Liver Bone Marrow 
CR Disappearance of all 
evidence of disease (a) FDG-avid or PET 
positive prior to therapy; mass of any size permitted 
if PET negative 
(b) Variably FDG-avid or 
PET negative; regression 
to normal size on CT Not palpable, 
nodules disappeared If infiltrate present at 
screening, infiltrate cleared on repeat 
biopsy; if 
indeterminate by morphology, 
immune-histochemistry 
should be negative 
PR Regression of 
measurable disease and no new sites 50% decrease in SPD of 
up to 6 largest dominant masses; no increase in size 
of other nodes 
(a) FDG-avid or PET 
positive prior to therapy; 
1 PET positive at 
previously involved site 
(b) Variably FDG-avid or 
PET negative; regression 
on CT 50% decrease in 
SPD of nodules (for single nodule in 
greatest transverse 
diameter); no increase in size of 
liver or spleen Irrelevant if positive 
prior to therapy; cell type should be 
specified 
SD Failure to attain 
CR/PR or progressive disease (a) FDG-avid or PET 
positive prior to therapy; PET positive at prior sites of disease, and no new 
sites on CT or PET 
(b) Variably FDG avid or 
PET negative; no change 
in size of previous lesions 
on CT   
CR = complete remission, CT = computed tomography, FDG = [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose, PET = positron emission 
tomography, PR = partial remission, SD = stable disease, SPD = sum of the product of the diameters 
* Change in target lesion measurement by CT, unless MRI used as the assessment modality for lesions in 
anatomical locations not amenable to CT 
Progressive disease  for Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is characterized by any new lesion or 
increase by 50% of previously involved sites from nadir for example: 
xAppearance of a new lesion(s) >1.5 cm in any axis, 50% increase in SPD of >1 node, or 
50% increase in longest diameter of a previously identified node >1 cm in short axis 
xLesions PET positive if FDG-avid lymphoma or PET positive before therapy 
x>50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previous lesions in the liver or spleen 
xNew or recurrent involvement in the bone marrow 
xAn increase of 50% in blood lymphocytes with 5 x 109/L B-cells only in setting of 
enlarging lymph node, liver, or spleen (Note:  an isolated elevation of white blood cell count by itself will not be considered progressive disease unless subject becomes symptomatic from this).

CONFIDENTIAL  1 Introduction  
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference 
on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and 
procedures.  
1.1 Background  
Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) is a condition that is increasingly associated with adverse effects 
on cardiovascular (CV) health.  It is estimated that up to 18 million Americans have OSA, many 
of whom remain undiagnosed ( 22).  The U.S. population is becoming increasingly overweight and 
is aging, both of which are alarming trends because obesity and aging are two of the strongest 
risk factors for the development of OSA ( 23-25).  As more people develop OSA, the prevalence 
of CV disease is expected to increase.  Untreated OSA is associated with the development of hypertension and other CV diseases ( 26-30).  Discovery of treatable causes of CV disease in 
OSA may lead to reductions in morbidity and mortality. Increased sympathetic traffic and endothelial dysfunction are well -documented in OSA and are believed to play a significant role in 
the development of hypertension.  Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), the therapy of 
choice for OSA, has beneficial effects on sympathetic activity, endothelial function, and blood 
pressure ( 31-33); however, up to 30 percent of patients do not adhere to CPAP therapy ( 17).  
Therefore, development of other treatments that specifically target mechanisms of CV disease and hypertension is warranted.  
Sympathetic Nervous System in OSA:   Evidence from animal models suggests that 
carotidchemoreceptors ( CCR )s (via intact sympathetic nerves) mediate changes in sympathetic 
output that result in hypertension (34 -36).  Patients with OSA have elevated sympathetic nerve 
activity while exposed to intermittent hypoxia during sleep and also during daytime waking hours when blood oxygen levels are normal (37).  Plasma and urinary norepinephrine concentrations 
are also elevated in patients with OSA (38).  Hypoxia, rather than hypercapnia, is primarily responsible for increases in sympathetic nerve activity ( 39) that occur during apneas in patients 
with OSA.  Narkiewicz et al demonstrated that inhibiting  the CCR with hyperoxia reduced mSNA 
in patients with OSA, suggesting that tonic activation of CCR  afferents contributes to elevations 
in daytime mSNA ( 2).  Furthermore, OSA patients have CCR hypersensitivity to subsequent 
hypoxia exposure (3).  Treatment of OSA with CPAP or oxygen normalizes sympathetic activity, blood pressure, and CCR hypersensitivity (3,31,32).  These data suggest that intermittent 
episodes of hypoxia mediate increased sympathetic traffic in patients with OSA via sensitization 
of the carotid chemoreflex and that this alteration is reversible.  
Role of A-II and XO in Carotid Body Function:  Heightened sensitivity of carotid chemoreflex 
regulation of sympathetic discharge is one putative mechanism of sympathetic overactivity in 
patients with OSA. Changes in CCR sensitivity appear to be driven by exposure to intermittent 
hypoxia, rather than hypercapnia or arousal from sleep ( 40).  Experimental animal studies have 
demonstrated that chronic intermittent hypoxia ( CIH) increases CCR sensitivity to subsequent 
hypoxic episodes ( 41-43). The signal for increased CCR sensitivity during hypoxia appears to 
involve endothelin- 1 and angiotensin II (A -II) via superoxide and other reactive oxygen species 
(ROS)(44).   The importance of Angiotensin II’s (A -II) role in enhancing chemoreceptor sensitivity 
to hypoxia is becoming increasingly recognized.  Injection of A -II directly into isolated carotid 
bodies elevates nerve activity in the carotid sinus nerve (44).  Additionally, carotid afferent nerve 
activity is increased in ex vivo studies by application of physiologic concentrations of A -II (45).  
Application of an A -II an tagonist, losartan reverses the sympathoexcitation of A -II, indicating 
involvement of the A -II type 1 receptor (45).  Hypoxia increases expression of carotid body A -II 
Pharmacologic Interventions for Cardiovascular Disease in Obstructive Sleep Apnea

Version: 2 3, 7-25 -17 
CONFIDENTIAL  type 1 receptors (44) and A -II receptor mRNA (46).  Most importantly, our recent laborat ory 
findings demonstrated that CIH -induced chemoreflex hypersensitivity  was prevented by 
administration of losartan before and during CIH exposure (See Preliminary Studies Section).    
 Previous studies have shown that CIH increases generation of ROS in the carotid body 
(40). Furthermore, administration of superoxide scavengers prevents CIH -induced CCR 
sensitization ( 40), indicating this anion plays a pivotal role in sensitization of the carotid 
chemoreflex. Likely sources of superoxide in the carotid body include NADPH -oxidase and XO, 
which can be upregulated by hypoxia (47-4 9). Preliminary data from our laboratory illustrates that 
XO and A -II inhibition prevent  CIH-induced increases in carotid body superoxide production (see 
Preliminary Studies). Taken together, these data suggest that superoxide is a key player in the 
signaling pathway that mediates enhanced CCR sensitivity caused by CIH and that A-II and XO 
increase carotid superoxide production under these conditions.  Thus, targeting A -II with an ARB 
and XO with allopurinol would appear to be a logical strategy to reduce the chemosensitizing 
effects of CIH in the carotid body.  Evaluation of XO and A -II inhibition in human subjects with 
OSA is warranted to determine if these preliminary findings have clinical relevance.  If XO  and A -
II inhibition can reduce CCR sensitivity, they may also reduce sympathetic overactivity and the 
risk of developing hypertension.  
Role of Nitric Oxide (NO) in Carotid Body and Vascular Endothelium:   NO decreases CCR 
sensitivity  and appears to work in a counter -regulatory fashion to A -II (50). Two isoforms of nitric 
oxide synthase (eNOS and nNOS) are present in the carotid body (51). In our preliminary studies, 
exposure to CIH downregulated carotid body nNOS, potentially removing  an important effect of 
NO in maintaining normal CCR sensitivity (52). Our preliminary data demonstrate that inhibition 
of XO and A -II partially prevents CIH -induced reductions in nNOS expression (see Preliminary 
Studies section).  These findings are in accordance with previous studies demonstrating that inhibition of XO and A -II increases NO availability in patients with OSA (53). Thus, XO and A -II 
inhibition may boost NO availability in the carotid body and reduce pathological CCR hypersensitivity produced in response to OSA. 
 
Reduced availability of NO is thought to play a role in the development of vascular abnormalities 
in patients with OSA (54).  These individuals demonstrate impairments in endothelium -dependent 
vasodilation in numerous vascular beds (55 -57), and treatment with CPAP improves these 
impairments (32).  Animal data demonstrate that CIH reduces acetylcholine- induced endothelium -
dependent vasodilation in gracilis arteries and middle cerebral arteries (58). These impairments 
likely represent r eductions in NO availability since endothelium -independent vasodilation to 
exogenous nitrates is not impaired in subjects with OSA or animals exposed to CIH (55,58).  ROS are a likely trigger for OSA -induced endothelial dysfunction. ROS, e.g. superoxide anion, 
produced in the vessel wall can decrease the availability of NO via scavenging and by combination 
with NO to form peroxynitrite which leads to NOS uncoupling (59).  Markers of oxidative stress, 
including neutrophil superoxide production and lipid peroxidation, are elevated in patients with 
OSA (60,61).  Angiotensin II and XO are involved in the production of ROS in the vascular 
endothelium (12,62).  Plasma concentrations of A -II are elevated in OSA and the activity of XO is 
increased by hypoxia (48,49,13).  In patients with OSA, XO inhibition improves NO -mediated 
vasodilation.   We have shown that XO inhibition and A -II inhibition both can prevent the CIH 
induced endothelial impairments and improve NO -mediated vasodilation in ex vivo animal studies 
(See Figure 5, Preliminary Studies Section).  
 
Remodeling as a cause of impaired v asodilation:  Increased carotid intima- media thickness 
(63,64)  and increased arterial stiffness (64-69) are observed in individuals with OSA. Blood levels 
of NO and ET -1, endothelium -derived regulators of vascular stiffness with opposing actions 
(70,71) , are decreased and increased, respectively (54,72) . In rat gracilis arteries, we have shown 
Pharmacologic Interventions for Cardiovascular Disease in Obstructive Sleep Apnea  
  Page 4 
Version: 2 3, 7-25 -17 
CONFIDENTIAL  that CIH exposure causes a leftward shift in the stress -strain curve, consistent with an increase 
in arterial stiffness (73). 
Mitogenic factors ( e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth 
factor, platelet -derived growth factor) are up- regulated by hypoxia (74,75)  and during 
inflammation (76) . In patients with OSA, elevated plasma Ang II levels (13,64)  have been 
implicated in increased VEGF expression (77). 
Chronic sympathetic activation causes vascular remodeling via release of catecholamines 
that induce vascular wall growth (78). In pulmonary arteries, ATP released from adrenergic nerves 
during hypoxia- induced sympathetic stimulation causes proliferation and migration of adventitial 
fibroblasts into the intima and media (79). This mechanism is a putative cause of remodeling in 
the systemic circulation (80). In addition, surges in sympathetic outflow during episodes of apnea 
produce cyclical increases in arterial pressure and blood flow that may trigger adaptations in 
endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle, and extracellular matrix aimed at normalizing wall 
stress (81,82) . 
Heightened Chemoreflex Sensitivity and Diminished Cerebrovascular Reactivity Destabilize 
Breathing during Sleep:  Unstable ventilatory control during sleep in individuals with upper airways 
that are anatomically susceptible to collapse may precipitate OSA (7,8,83,84) . Further, limited 
evidence points to a significant prevalence of unstable ventilatory control ( i.e. high control system 
“loop gain”) in patients with severe OSA, secondary in part to increases in CO 2 sensitivity 
(increased controller gain) (8,85) . Augmented carotid chemoreflex sensitivity secondary to 
intermittent hypoxia (86) might also contribute to increased ventilatory instability and, in turn, to 
cyclical obstructions in OSA patients. Accordingly, reducing this important component of increased controller gain by preventing intermittent hypoxia- induced increases in carotid body 
sensitivity may also reduce the severity of sleep disordered breathing concomitantly with a 
reduction in sympathetic nervous system activity. We emphasize that prevention of ventilatory 
instability, per se, is most likely to reduce cyclical apneas in patients with mild to moderate levels 
of airway collapsibility, and less likely in those with severely compromised airway anatomy (7,8). 
We have demonstrated that OSA impairs hypercapnic vasodilation in the cerebral circulation 
(87). In health, cerebral resistance arteries are exquisitely sensitive to changes in PaCO 2 (88). 
This important characteristic of the cerebral circulation minimizes the change in brain PCO 2 during 
fluctuations in arterial PCO 2. Reductions in cerebrovascular CO 2 responsiveness could 
exacerbate breathing instability during sleep by exaggerating the accumulation and also the washout of CO
2 from central chemoreceptors during fluctuations in ventilation and arterial PCO 2. 
We have shown, in healthy humans during wakefulness, that cerebral CO 2 responsiveness is an 
important determinant of eupneic ventilation and also the ventilatory response to hypercapnia (89). Furthermore, we have shown during sleep in healthy subjects, that reducing the cerebral 
vascular response to CO
2 with indomethacin decreases the CO 2 reserve below eupnea (ΔPaCO 2, 
eupnea- apnea) and increases the susceptibility to apnea (90). 
In patients with OSA, attenuated cerebrovascular CO 2 reactivity and exaggerated carotid 
chemoreflex sensitivity are both reversible when sleep disordered breathing is eliminated with CPAP (3,87,91) . We hypothesize that pharmacological measures targeting the mechanisms 
involved also may reverse these impairments and lead to a reduction in the severity of sleep disordered breathing in selected patients.  
1.2 Preclinical Data  
N/A 
1.3 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
Drug selection and dose rationale:  In our rat studies, an allopurinol dose of 65 mg/kg/day (~300mg/day in humans) (134) effectively reduced AT1R and superoxide concentrations in the 
Pharmacologic Interventions for Cardiovascular Disease in Obstructive Sleep Apnea  
  Page 5 
Version: 2 3, 7-25 -17 
CONFIDENTIAL  rat CCR (see Preliminary Studies).  Subjects in our study will take allopurinol 300 mg daily for six 
weeks (dose will remain unchanged during four -week period).  Allopurinol is quickly converted in 
vivo to its active metabolite, oxypurinol.  Oxypurinol is responsible for the majority of the effects of allopurinol and has a half -life of 17- 21 hours (135).  Steady state blood concentrations of 
oxypurinol occur in approximately 105 hours (4.4 days).  A study demonstrating vascular benefits of XO inhibition in patients with OSA was two weeks in duration, and our rat study used two weeks 
of CIH.  We propose to have subjects take six weeks of study medication to increase the likelihood 
of observing significant sympathetic, vascular and blood pressure changes and to determine if 
preliminary changes seen after two weeks are sustained.  A 300 mg daily dose will sufficiently inhibit XO because the IC
90 of oxypurinol for XO is approximately 5 µg/mL, and a single 300 mg 
dose of allopurinol produces peak levels of 5- 7 µg/mL (136- 138).  At steady state, peak drug 
concentrations are higher than peak concentrations from single doses, and > 90% of XO will be inhibited.   Losartan will be used in the doses that are clinically used to treat hypertension (50 -100 
mg daily by mouth).  E -3174 is the active metabolite responsible for the clinical effects of losartan 
and E -3174 has a half -life of 4- 9 hours (139).  Thus, steady -state concentrations of E -3174 are 
quickly achieved after approximately 20- 45 hours (139).  Use of this dose is based on data 
demonstrating that 100 mg doses produce plasma concentrations > 1000 ng/mL of E -3174 (140).  
The ability of E -3174 to block the pressor effects of an intravenous angiotensin II challenge 
plateaus between 500- 750 ng/mL (141).  Thus, we feel our proposed doses will effectively block 
the actions of A -II.  
We have chosen a six week treatment period because in our previous study, vascular endothelial function was improved after 6 weeks of treatment and did not further improve after 12 weeks of 
treatment.  Furthermore, three weeks of losartan therapy successfully prevented chemoreflex sensitization in adult male, Sprague- Dawley rats.    
 Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits because the two 
medications  are FDA approved with significant clinical history to base safety upon.  If the study 
drugs are proven to be effective for the primary endpoint, they may undergo further trials as potential interventions for prevention of hypertension and cardiovascular disease in patients with OSA.  
2 Study Objectives  
1. Determine if treatment with losartan, an angiotensin type I receptor (AT 1R) antagonist, or 
allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor, normalize chemoreflex control of 
sympathetic outflow and ventilation and improves local vascular regulation and stiffness.  
2. Determine if these interventions reduce the severity of sleep disordered breathing and lower diurnal blood pressure.  
 
3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
 
The proposed project is a randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled, parallel three- treatment 
arm phase II clinical evaluation of allopurinol, losartan, and placebo in hypertensive patients with severe OSA.  The proposed trial is based on preliminary data suggesting that both of these 
available medications may reduce chemoreflex sensitivity and endothelial function in patients with 
OSA.  Subject enrollment will be conducted on a rolling basis during the three year study period 
and subjects will be randomized (stratified by baseline CPAP adherence) to one of the three 
treatments .  Randomization will be stratified based on three categories of baseline CPAP 
Pharmacologic Interventions for Cardiovascular Disease in Obstructive Sleep Apnea  
  Page 6 
Version: 2 3, 7-25 -17 
CONFIDENTIAL  adherence: < 1 hr, 1 – 4 hrs, and > 4hrs of CPAP use on average per night.  This will ensure 
balanced CPAP use between treatment arms.  Allopurinol will be initiated at 300 mg daily and the 
dose will remain constant for the six -week study session.  Losartan will be initiated at 50 mg daily 
and the dose will be increased to 100 mg after two weeks if systolic blood pressure is above 120 
mm Hg and as long as serum creatinine and potassium do not significantly increase.  Subjects 
with SBP between 120- 100 mm Hg may increase to 100 mg if approved by physician.  If the 
subject’s serum creatinine (> 0.5 mg/dL) or serum potassium (above 5.0 mEq/ L) significantly 
increase, or if the subject experiences a significant side effect from the medication (e.g. 
maculopapular rash) the subject will be discontinued from the study.  If the subject does not 
tolerate the losartan dose increase to 100 mg, his/her dose will be reduced back to 50 mg by 
study staff at request of subject.  If the subject tolerates the dose increase, t he losartan dose will 
then remain unchanged from the second to sixth week of the study.  Patients in the placebo group 
will receive placebo capsules daily for six weeks that are identical in appearance to the 
overencapsulated losartan and allopurinol.   
 Hypertensive patients who have severe sleep apnea (apnea hypopnea index  or respiratory 
disturbance index  > 25 events/hour) will be studied to allow the greatest likelihood of detecting 
significant differences in outcome variables.  We will take patients who are and who are not using  
CPAP and will stratify their randomization based on baseline CPAP use.  This will be done to 
simulate real -world treatments as best as possible and determine if our therapies’ effectiveness 
is modified by CPAP use.  All subjects will undergo a screening visit (Visit 1) at their local site to 
determine eligibility and collect pertinent data.  Subsequently, subjects will be randomized to one 
of the three treatment groups (allopurinol, losartan, or placebo) and will have a physiology and 
vascular baseline study completed (Visit 3).  
 Subjects will have 24- hour ambulatory blood pressure and 24 -hour Holter/Heart rate variability 
measurements taken* (Visit 2) on a day/night prior to Visit 3.  Prior to starting study drug therapy, 
subjects will come to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU ) at the University of Wisconsin for 
physiol ogy/vascular study (Visit 3).  Subjects recruited from the other recruitment sites will come 
to Madison for Visit 3 .  Subjects will arrive on day one of their study,  and will have physiologic 
assessments taken before full overnight polysomnography and overnight Holter/Heart rate 
variability* is completed during night one (to determine severity of OSA).  Prior to 
polysomnography, subjects will have muscle sympathetic nerve activity, forearm blood flow, 
cerebral blood flow velocity, plasma catecholamines, ventilation, blood pressure, and heart rate 
measured at rest under normoxic (room air) conditions and during graded levels of hypoxia (90%, 
85% and 80% SaO2).  Following this, subjects will be allowed to return to normoxia (room air 
levels of oxygen ~ 21% oxy gen) and after dinner will be hooked up for polysomnography  and 
Holter/Heart rate variability*.  The morning after polysomnography, subjects will have assessment 
of brachial artery flow -mediated vasodilation and nitroglycerin induced vasodilation measured by 
ultrasound.  Then subjects will have aortic pulse wave velocity and augmentation index measured by arterial tonometry.  The 2
nd night subjects will stay overnight again in the VA Research Unit  
and have control of breathing studies completed (Pcrit and apnea threshold).  Subjects will initiate study drug treatment and will return two weeks later for a blood pressure  and heart rate (office 
blood pressure) measurement, CPAP assessment, and safety assessment to measure serum creatinine and serum potassium concentrations.  This is standard safety monitoring in patients taking ARBs, and to maintain blinding, all subjects will have this monitoring completed.  Subjects 
who do have clinically significant increases in serum creatinine (an increase > 0. 5 mg/dL) or 
whose serum potassium increases to a concentration > 5.0 mEq/L will have their participation in 
the study terminated.  Subjects continuing in the study will then complete four additional weeks 
of drug therapy.  At the end of six weeks of study medication, subjects will have 24 -hour 
ambulatory blood pressure and 24 -hour Holter/Heart rate variability assessed one day and night.

CONFIDENTIAL  On a following night, subjects will return to Madison for physiology studies, overnight 
polysomnography  and Holter/heart rate variabi lity measurements* , vascular function measures 
and control of breathing studies the 2nd night to assess the study drug effects on variables 
measured at baseline. Subjects will be instructed not to consume caffeine (both solid and liquid 
forms) after midnight the night before they are admitted to the CRU  and after 8pm on night 1. 
Subjects may consume caffeine after the physiology study on Day 1 and before 8pm on Day 1. Subjects will also be instructed not to smoke after 10 pm once they are admitted to the CRU until 
discharged. Subjects will not be allowed to participate in the study if they are unable to refrain 
from smoking after 10 pm for up to 24 to 48 hours once they  are admitted to the CRU until 
discharged.  
 
*Holter and Heart rate variability measurements are optional and will only be offered to UW 
subjects .  They can choose to opt -in or opt -out of those procedures. Subjects who are non- CPAP 
users will have Holter m onitoring done at Visits 3 and 6, but will not have Holter monitoring 
performed at Visits 2 and 5.   The Holter monitors will be connected by UW Sleep Laboratory 
Technicians or study team personnel. Subjects may disconnect the Holter monitor on their own, or they may come back to UW -Madison to have the Holter monitor removed.  A postage -paid 
envelope will be provided to subjects to return to Holter monitor by mail.  
3.2 Primary Study Endpoints  
The primary outcome variable is the difference in the individual slope of the MSNA – SaO2 
response curve at 6 weeks and baseline between treatment groups.   Basal normoxic MSNA 
and MSNA responses during hypoxia will be compared between the three treatment groups.  For 
purposes of quantification, MSNA is expressed as burst frequency (bursts/min), burst amplitude 
(arbitrary units) and total minute activity (burst frequency x mean burst amplitude).   Total minute 
activity of mSNA is an effective way to capture the change in both burst frequency and burst amplitude.  Both amplitude and burst frequency are influenced by disease states such as OSA 
and by environmental conditions such as hypoxia.   Postganglionic m SNA in the right peroneal 
nerve will be recorded directly using the microneurography technique ( 95). The neural signals are 
passed to a differential preamplifier, an amplifier , a band- pass filter, and an integrator (time 
constant=100 ms). Placement of the recording electrode within a muscle nerve fascicle i s 
confirmed by the presence of muscle twitches in response to electrical stimulation,  the 
appearance of afferent activity in response to tapping or stretching of muscle, but not gentle stroking of skin, in the appropriate receptive fields, and other criteria.  Once an acceptable neural recording (signal -to-noise ratio >3:1) is obtained, the subject is instructed to maintain the leg in a 
relaxed position for the duration of the study. Sympathetic bursts w ill be  identified by computer -
assisted inspection of the mean voltage neurogram.   
 
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
Secondary outcome variables will include assessment measures of cerebral and forearm blood flow during basal conditions and during graded hypoxia before and after study drug treatment.  
Plasma catecholamine concentrations before and after study drug and change in plasma 
catecholamines during hypoxia will be assessed as a secondary indicator of sympathetic 
activation.  Other secondary outcome variables will be assessed before and after study drug 
treatment, including: ventilation, aortic pulse wave velocity (a measurement of vascular stiffness), 
aortic augmentation index, % vasodilation during flow -mediated vasodilation (measurement of 
vascular endothelial function), apnea threshold, apnea- hypopnea index, % time spent below 90% 
oxygen saturation,  heart rate variability, holter electrocardiogram measurements,  and mean 24-

4.3 Subject Recruitment and Screening  
 
Screening Visit  (Visit 1) :  Subjects will come to the C RU or their local recruitment site for a brief 
screening visit.  Subjects should be instructed to be fasting for at least 12 hours prior to 
their visit  and patients should hold any blood pressure medications on the morning of 
VISIT 1 (they may take at end of VISIT or after).   Investigators will explain the study, answer 
questions, and complete the informed consent and HIPAA process.  Potential subjects identified 
through sleep databases and registries will be contacted via telephone to obtain verbal consent 
or declination for participation in this study. A waiver of written documentation of informed consent has been approved by the IRB to obtain consent via telephone. At the in person screening visit, 
the subject will then sign a consent form witnessed by the study coordinator or investigator. The 
subject will then receive a signed copy of this consent form. All copies of the consent forms will 
be maintained in the subject’s binder. The subject  will then undergo:  
• a history and physical with the C RU nurse practitioner  
• under go a 12- lead electrocardiogram  (if the electrocardiogram has abnormalities of clear 
clinical significance, then a copy of the EKG with a letter explaining those abnormalities will be sent to the subject with instructions to share with his/her physician).  
• take a urine pregnancy test (for females of child- bearing age),  
• have a fasting blood sample taken to measure serum cholesterol, potassium, creatinine,  
uric acid, and glucose concentrations  
If the subject declines participating in the study, any personal and health related information will 
not be retained and will be destroyed upon completion of the telephone call.  
 
Subjects will not receive study medications until the end of Visit 3  and will be instructed to bring 
their study medication bottles  with them to Visit 4 (two weeks after starting medication) and Visit 
6 (6 weeks after starting medication) .  Study drug diary evaluation will be used to evaluate study 
drug adherence.  Subjects will receive an auto-CPAP m achine or CPAP compliance card to use 
during the study. Subjects will  not receive payment for Visit 6 if they do not return the CPAP 
machined or CPAP compliance card. Subjects will be instructed to maintain the baseline CPAP 
use throughout the study.   Subjects will complete baseline 24- hour ambulatory blood pressure 
monitoring (Visit 2) prior to receiving either study drug.  This will take place prior to their overnight 
visit to Madison (Visit 3) .    
    
Study subjects will be recruited from the Wisconsin Sleep Center in Madison, Marshfield Clinic  in 
the greater Marshfield, WI area, Aurora Bay Care in Green Bay, and Gundersen Health System 
in La Crosse, WI.  Wisconsin Sleep initiated a research subject registry and database in August, 
2008, and the subject registry invites all patients referred to clinic or laboratory to consider being 
contacted about research projects.  Data that is maintained in the subject database includes 
patient name, date of birth, gender, contact information, sleep study data, and diagnoses.  Drs. Dopp and Teodorescu will also recruit subjects at Wisconsin Sleep in their own clinics .  Subjects 
will be recruited in clinics at Wisconsin Sleep and after their sleep study at Wisconsin Sleep or 
Pharmacologic Interventions for Cardiovascular Disease in Obstructive Sleep Apnea

Version: 2 3, 7-25 -17 
CONFIDENTIAL  after a home study done by Wisconsin Sleep.  Additional advertisements will be made available 
to subjects at other Sleep laboratories and clinics in the area, as well as at other clinics and 
medical centers in the greater Madison area (including, but not limited to:   Baraboo sleep 
lab/clinic, Sauk pr airie hospital sleep lab/clinic, St. Mary's sleep lab/clinic, Portage sleep lab/clinic, 
Reedsburg sleep lab/clinic, etc. Permission will be obtained prior to posting flyers or 
advertisements.   An opt -out letter will be sent to qualifying subjects and the subjects will have 7 
days to opt out before we will contact them to provide further information about the study and inquire as to their interest.  Additional subjects who have participated in previous studies by 
investigators or other research groups who have expressed interest in future sleep apnea studies will be contacted about this study. Recruitment will also be completed with the use of social media 
and the internet.  We will advertise on the UW Job Board, Craigslist, and Wisconsin Sleep’s 
website. We w ill implement an email blast to the UW Madison students, faculty and staff as well 
as us e campus and local newspapers and other media.  
 
Recruitment at other sites:  
 We will also recruit from the sleep laboratories and sleep clinics at Marshfield Clinic , Marshfield, 
WI, Gundersen Health System , La Crosse, WI, and Aurora Bay Care, Green Bay , WI.   Subjects 
will be recruited by the responsible investigators at the individual sites with the help of study coordinators.  Subjects will be identified following sleep studies in the sleep laboratories and 
during visits to clinic.  Subjects will be contacted and approached about study participation by 
individuals involved in his/her clinical care.  Subjects may also be identified using advertisements 
in the community and at the local medical centers if necessary.   
 
 
4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1 When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
Allopurinol  
If a subject experiences an adverse effect that is thought to be significant or serious (e.g. renal impairment, maculopapular rash, etc.) subjects’ participation in the study will be ended.   
 Losartan  
If a subject experiences clinically significant/serious adverse effects (angioedema, myalgias, acute renal failure), their participation will be ended.  If the subject experiences increases in serum creatinine (> 0. 5 mg/dL) or serum potassium (above 5.0 
mEq/ L) the subject’s participation in the 
study will be ended.  Blood pressure will also be measured at the two week  monitoring visit  (Visit 
4).  The dose of losartan will increase to 100mg daily if systolic blood pressure is > 120 mm Hg .  
For a systolic blood pressure between 100 -120 mm Hg the subject may have dose increased if 
approved by study physician.  If the subject’s blood pressure is < 100/60 mm Hg and if the patient 
is dizzy and symptomatic during the study, the subject will discontinue study medication and go 
off study .  This can be done via a phone encounter  or via an additional (unexpected) visit .  It is 
possible the subject’s participation will be terminated if the study physicians feel that is 
appropriate.   
 Subjects may also be withdrawn from the study if they are diagnosed with a new and significant 
medical problem (e.g. they are hospitalized for an acute illness or major medical condition).  Subjects may also be withdrawn from the study if they consistently fail to adhere to the protocol 
requirements.  Study physicians will communicate with subjects’ regular physician about care 
plans upon their withdrawal from the study.    
 
Pharmacologic Interventions for Cardiovascular Disease in Obstructive Sleep Apnea  
  Page 11 
Version: 2 3, 7-25 -17 
CONFIDENTIAL  Additional (Unexpected) Visit:  
If a subject experiences an adverse event that requires them to be seen by study staff, they should 
be scheduled for a visit to their local center as soon as is feasible.  The PIs should be notified 
immediatel y and the physician at the local site should see the subject during the visit.  Depending 
on the complaint, the AE should be evaluated with appropriate objective measures (blood tests, blood pressure/heart rate measurements, etc.) and the case report forms  for “Additional Visit” 
should be filled out (in subject binder).  These forms include:  
 AE form  
Vitals form  
Additional visit form  
AE log  
 The study physician will determine if the subject should be discharged from the study (if subject 
is discharged, then  complete the “subject off study” form).  If the subject is discharged from the 
study, then he/she should have the 30 -day post study evaluation performed 30 days after their 
study discharge (see below) .    
4.4.2 Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects  
We do not expect mortality or significant morbidity from the study.  However, all subjects will be instructed to contact investigators if any problems arise after study participation is discontinued.  
Investigators will contact subjects who are withdrawn from the study 30 days  after study 
discontinuation and periodically thereafter per study physician discretion if necessary .  Data will 
be obtained and kept from any follow -up communications.  
5 Study Drug  
5.1 Description  
Allopurinol and losartan are both FDA approved medications.  Losartan is FDA approved for the treatment of hypertension.  Allopurinol is approved for the treatment of gout.  Study medications will be over  encapsulated with lactose and all subjects will receive placebo with their active study 
medication in a double dummy design.   Zolpidem will also be given to subjects (upon discharge 
from the CRU at Visits 3 and 6) to help them sleep during the control of breathing studies.   
 
5.2 Treatment Regimen  
Losartan 50 mg daily for two weeks, then increased to 100mg daily for 4 weeks  
 OR 
 Allopurinol 300 mg daily for 6 weeks  
 
OR 
 Placebo capsule daily for 6 weeks  
 
All three medications will be taken orally (in capsules) by subjects.  The treatment regimen is 
summarized in Table 1.  
 Table 1.  Treatment Regimen  
Pharmacologic Interventions for Cardiovascular Disease in Obstructive Sleep Apnea

Losartan subjects will take capsules from Bottle A for days 1- 14, and capsules from Bottle B for days 15-
42.  If the subject’s systolic blood pressure is > 120 mm Hg, the subject will continue to take capsules daily 
from Bottle A (days 15- 42).  If SBP is between 100- 120 mm Hg, the subject may switch to bottle B with 
physician approval.    
 
Allopurinol and Placebo will also have Bottle A and B for each treatment and will contain identical drug in Bottle A and Bottle B.  Subjects will transition from Bottle A to Bottle B after day 14 in the allopurinol and 
placebo group.  This is done to maintain study blinding.  
5.3 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Randomization will be performed by the Pharmaceutical Research Center (PRC) using a scheme 
designed by the PRC and ICTR statisticians.  Subjects will be randomized and stratified based 
on their baseline use of continuous positive airway pressure (permuted block randomization).   
Subjects will be classified into the following three categories of baseline CPAP use:  1) < 1  hour 
per night; 2) between 1  and 4 hours per night; and 3) > 4 hours per night.   Subjects not using 
CPAP will b e classified in the < 1 hour per night group.  Subjects will be instructed to continue the 
same CPAP use during the study as they were using at study entry.  
5.4 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug 
Study drug will be over  encapsulated by the University  of Iowa Pharmaceutical s (UIP) and stored 
and distributed by the University of Wisconsin Pharmaceutical Research Center and blinded according to a pre- designed scheme.  Subjects will be randomized at the end of visit 1 (screening 
visit) and will receive study drug at their baseline physiology study visit  (visit 3) .  UIP is an FDA -
registered facility compliant with 21 CFR parts 11, 210, and 211, licensed by the DEA to handle controlled substances (Schedules I -V), and capable of handling potent/cytotoxic materials.  UIP 
has been a cGMP facility for over 30 years.  
5.5 Subject Adherence Monitoring 
All subjects will receive instructions on how to take and record medication adherence in a diary.  Subjects will not receive study medications until the end of the Physiology Visit in Madison (Visit 
3) and will be instructed to bring their study medications with them to Visit 4 (two weeks after 
starting medication at local study site) and Visit 6 (Six weeks after starting study medication – in 
Madison).  Serum uric acid concentrations and plasma renin activity will be measured at baseline 
and after 6 weeks of study medication and will provide an indirect measure of drug adherence in 
subjects receiving allopurinol  and losartan.   Adherence to CPAP therapy will be monitored at Visit 
4 (two weeks after starting medication) and Visit 6 (Six weeks after starting study medication) .  
CPAP adherence can be determined from the electronic data card in the CPAP machine and downloaded into a printable report.   Each site will have a card reader and software for 
Pharmacologic Interventions for Cardiovascular Disease in Obstructive Sleep Apnea  
  Page 13 
Version: 2 3, 7-25 -17 
CONFIDENTIAL  downloading the information from subjects’ CPAP machines at Visit 4.  Subjects on BiPAP will use 
their machines instead of ours, and we will attempt to get their adherence data from them.  
 
5.5.1 CPAP Before and During Study  
Subjects who are using CPAP  or BiPAP prior to the study will be asked to provide adherence data 
for the time period prior to them entering the study. Subjects who require CPAP  or BiPAP  must 
be on treatment for a minimum of 3 months prior to Visit 2 . This information will be obtained from 
their CPAP /BiPAP  machine or from their home health provider that services their CPAP /BiPAP 
machine.  We will also ask for their permission to contact their sleep physician to obtain a copy of 
their sleep study  report. This will help us to determine how severe their sleep apnea is.  Consent 
to obtain this information from home health providers  and sleep physician will be obtained in the 
informed consent document.  Subjects who qualify for the study will be instructed to continue to 
use CPAP /BiPAP  the same amount during the study as they were using prior to the study.  If 
subjects are not using CPAP /BiPAP  prior to study entry, they will be instructed to continue not 
using CPAP /BiPAP  during the study.    
 At Visit 3, subjects will be given a CPAP machine or CPAP compliance card to use during the 
study.  Subjects using BiPAP will continue to use their own BiPAP machine. We will set the 
pressure on this machine to the same pressure the subject was using on their machine at home.  
Subjects will bring their CPAP /BiPAP  machine or compliance card with them to Visit 4 (at local 
site) and Visit 6 (in Madison) to have the adherence data checked.  Investigators should remove the compliance card from the CPAP machine and download the data at Visits 4 and 6.  After the 
download, the cards should be returned to the subjects’ CPAP machines.  Subjects will use the 
mask they had previously been using with the CPAP /BiPAP  machine issued to them.  The 
Respironics CPAP machines given to subjects during the study will be capable of measuring  
residual breathing events to determine how effectively the machine is treating a subject’s sleep 
apnea.  
 
 
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Information about all medications (prescription, OTC and supplements) being taken  will be 
collected at Study visits 1,  1A, 2,  (if more than 90 days after Visit 1),  3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 . Subjects 
are instructed to let the study coordinator know if they start any new medication while they are 
enrolled in the trial.  Other antihypertensive agents (diuretics, calcium channel blockers  – see 
Appendix 3 for allowable blood pressure medications) will be allowed but doses should remain constant during the study period.  Subjects taking non-hypnotic benzodiazepi nes, narcotic 
analgesics, quetiapine, or barbituates, on a daily basis or have taken them within 5 days (when 
using them p.r.n.  (pro re nata or as needed) before the control of breathing study will not be 
allowed to participate in the control of breathing study (night 2, visits 3 and 6).  However, if  a 
subject is taking a medication for sleep (e.g. hypnotic benzodiazepines, zaleplon, eszopiclone, 
etc.), they may participate in the control of breathing study if zolpidem may be taken instead of 
their usual sedative hypnotic for the control of breathing study.  Subjects  should not take PDE-5 
inhibitors (ie. sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), or tadalafil (Cialis) within 72 hours (3 days) 
before or after taking nitroglycerin.  If a subject has taken any  of these medications within that 
timeframe he/she will not be able to participate in the Stein lab portion of Visit 3.  
 
The following medications are not allowed to be taken: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors , angiotensin receptor antagonists, renin-inhibitors, 
potassium -sparing diuretics, allopurinol, oxypurinol, febuxostat , amoxicillin, ampicillin, 
azathioprine or mercaptopurine.

CONFIDENTIAL  5.6.1 Pregnancy Testing and Birth Control  
Women of child- bearing age are eligible subjects for this study.  However, since study drugs are 
pregnancy rate “D” (losartan) and “C” allopurinol, female subjects will take a urine pregnancy test 
at Visit 1 to ensure they are not pregnant.  A urine pregnancy test will be repeated at Visit 1A if 
the study visit occurs more than 90 days after Visit 1. Furthermore, a urine pregnancy test will also be given at Visit 3 prior to study drug dispensing.  The Pregnancy and birth control case report form should be completed at Visit 1, Visit 1A (if appl icable) and Visit 3.  On this case report 
form the method of birth control used should be documented and subjects are instructed to keep their birth control consistent throughout the study. Methods of birth  control that are acceptable 
while participating i n this study include oral contraceptives, hormonal contraceptives, hormonal 
implants, contraceptive patches, NuvaRing, intrauterine device hormonal, intrauterine device non-hormonal , barrier method, spermicide, post- menopausal for greater than or equal to two (2) years, 
tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy, vasectomy, or abstinence.  If a female is 
practicing abstinence, she should confirm this, including duration, and initial and date the case 
report form.  
 
5.7 Blinding of Study Drug 
Allopuri nol and Losartan tablets will be over  encapsulated and dispensed to subjects with a 
placebo using a double- dummy design.  Both subjects and investigators will be blinded to study 
drug assignment.  The PRC will have unblinding information should the need arise to unblind a subject’s study drug assignment.  To obtain unblinding information, please call the University of 
Wisconsin Pharmaceutical Research Center at (608) 263-8863.  
 
5.8 Receiving, Storage, Dispensing and Return  
5.8.1 Receipt of Drug Supplies 
The PRC will order, receive and store all study medications for the trial.  The PRC complies with 
all Federal and State regulations and current good manufacturing practices.  
5.8.2 Dispensing of Study Drug 
The PRC performs all required study drug reconciliation and inventory procedures on a regular 
basis.  PRC drug record logs record the movement of study drugs out of PRC storage and all medications are checked by a PRC pharmacist prior to dispensing to the subject and study staff.  
Amount of study drug on hand and dispensed is constantly tracked in PRC records.   All study 
drugs will be dispensed by the PRC to subjects during Visit 3 in Madison.  Subjects will receive all study drugs for the 6- week treatment period at Visit 3 and will receive instructions from 
investigators prior to starting therapy.   Zolpidem (supplied by the PRC) will be given to subjects 
upon discharge from the CRU at VISITS 3 and 6 to be taken immediately before (9 -10pm) the 
control of breathing study on night two.

hours along with the diary recording of  activity each time they engage in activity and each 
time the blood pressure cuff inflates; subject returns to the study site the following day (all 
activities performed by coordinator-- local PI consulted if necessary ).  Subjects at UW -
Madison will come to the School of Pharmacy Clinical research space of the Office of 
Clinical Trials E xamination Space (H6/136 CSC) to be set up with their 24- hour blood 
pressure cuff  and Holter/heart rate variability monitor.  Adverse events will be assessed  
at visits 2 and 5.

CONFIDENTIAL  *Holter and Heart rate variability measurements are optional and will only be offered to UW subjects .  
They can choose to opt -in or opt -out of those procedures. Subjects who are non- CPAP users will have 
Holter monitoring done at Visits 3 and 6, but will not have Holter monitoring performed at Visits 2 and 5.”  
The Holter monitors will be connected by UW Sleep Laboratory Technicians or study team personnel . 
Subjects may disconnect the Holter monitor on their own, or they may come back to UW -Madison to have 
the Holter monitor removed.  A postage- paid envelope will be provided to subjects to return to Holter 
monitor by mail.  
 
Visits 3 and 6: (each visit requiring a one or two night stay in Madison at the CRU at UW 
and the VA Hospital for all subjects enrolled in the study)  
• Day 1:   Vital signs, Heart Rate; Forearm Blood Flow;  Blood Samples;  Cerebral blood 
flow; Nerve activity;  Reduced oxygen exposure and increased oxygen 
breathing;  overnight sleep study and heart rhythm measurements at the CRU  to measure 
brain waves, respiration,  blood oxygen level, snoring, leg movements, heart rhythm, and 
heart rate  variability*  (performed by PIs and sleep technician). A physical exam will also 
be obtained. If bruit  are noted on physical exam the subject will no longer be able to 
participate in the study. The presence of a bruit would potentially indicate previously 
unrecognized cardiovascular disease.  
• Day two: Ultrasound of blood vessels and heart ; non-invasive tonometry;  assessment of 
CPAP use;  assessment of daytime sleepiness by completing the Epworth sleepiness 
scale; Study Medication dispensation (V3) and collection (V6);   Control of Breathing 
Experiments during sleep stay at VA hospital.  Subjects will receive zolpidem (sleeping 
medication) upon discharge from the CRU to be taken around 10pm at the start of the 
control of breathing study.    (Ultrasounds performed in Dr. Stein’s laboratory; control of 
breathing studies performed by sleep technician) .  Subjects who do not have someone to 
drive them home, do not want to take a complimentary cab home or do not want to go 
back to the CRU to sleep and have breakfast  prior to having a driver/cab take them home  
from Visits 3 and 6 may opt out of the control of breathing study on the second night.   
When a subject arrives for Visits 3 and 6, he/she will be asked if they have a driver to take them home, need a cab ride home or if they agree to go back to the CRU to sleep and 
have breakfast  prior to having a driv er/cab take them home after the control of breathing 
study.   
• Visit 6 will also include AE Assessment and diary review in addition to the procedures mentioned above.  
*Holter and Heart rate variability measurements are optional and will only be offered to UW

Version: 2 3, 7-25 -17 
CONFIDENTIAL  Visit 4:  Monitoring visit (performed at each local site where subject was enrolled)  
• measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, temperature,  and height and weight, blood 
sample collection, Study drug compliance and diary review, AE assessment (all performed 
by local site coordinator  or CRU nurses for Madison subjects )  
Visit 7: One month Follow -up (performed at each local site where subject was enrolled)  
• Subjects will be contacted by phone for completion of a final AE assess ment (performed 
by local site coordinator)  
6.3 Sample collection  
Blood samples collected during Visits 1 and 4 will be processed for the specific laboratory 
parameter at the local site and assayed in the clinical labs (or couriered from LaCrosse to Marshfield to be assayed).  Samples will be collected and sent to the clinical laboratory for 
measurement of serum creatinine, serum potassium, serum glucose, lipid panels, serum uric acid, etc.  At Visits 3 and 6 at UW -Madison, blood samples will be drawn at rest while the subject is 
breathing room air.  Uric acid will be collected and assayed in the UW Hospital and Clinics Clinical Laboratory and other samples will be collected for research use.  These samples collected for research use will be centrifuged, aliquoted, and stored in the locked freezer space at the 
University of Wisconsin School of Pharmacy for future assay.  Stored blood samples will be stripped of identifiers and only labeled with study subject number and Visit number.  Plasma will 
be sent to the TTR Analytical Laboratory Core at the University of Iowa  College of Pharmacy  for 
plasma catecholamine measurement.  Other plasma will be assayed at the UW School of 
Pharmacy for oxidative stress markers.   
 
6.4 Study communication and oversight  
At the start of th e trial, study binders will be set up for each study site with the current protocol 
version (will include protocol number and date).  At any time during the study when the 
protocol changes, a new protocol will be sent to each site to be included in the study binder and to be kept in a relevant study folder electronically  with the study coordinator.  The new 
protocol will be sent along with a summary of protocol changes denoted separately to the study coordinator, the IRB and co- Investigators.  Discussion of  protocol changes will also be 
an item of discussion at the bi -weekly WiNHR coordinator conference calls. 
 
When the UW HS IRB approves amendments to the protocol, copy of the approval will 
accompany the summary of changes approved and the new protocol version sent to the study 
sites.  Electronic copies of the approval documents will be forwarded to each site with the 
other electronic documents and stored electronically and in paper form in an IRB folder at 
each study site.  At each biweekly WiNHR coordinator conference call, reconciliation of all 
current approvals will be performed by all the investigators and their study binders and electronic files.  
 
Reporting of adverse events and unanticipated problems will be performed at all centers 
through the Principal Investigators to comply with the UW HS IRB requirements.  Investigators 
at all study sites will be instructed to notify the Principal Investigators of all adverse events 
immediately upon awareness of their occurrence.  The Principal investigators and the study coordinator in Madison will provide the information to the DMC and the IRB in the appropriate 
Pharmacologic Interventions for Cardiovascular Disease in Obstructive Sleep Apnea  
  Page 18 
Version: 2 3, 7-25 -17 
CONFIDENTIAL  time frame.  Unanticipated problems will be discussed at each WiNHR biweekly coordinator 
conference call and at quarterly investigator meetings.  
 
For events that are unexpected, immediately life threatening or severely debilitating to other 
current subjects, and caused by or probably related to the study drug, the D MC and IRB will 
be notified immediately.   
 Any deviations from the protocol at any of the research sites will be discouraged and if occur, 
will be reported to the UW HS IRB if the deviation or exception presents a significant safety 
risk to the subject or potential subject.  As per Good Clinical Practices, protocol deviations will 
be documented and reviewed at the quarterly investigator meetings.  If changes are necessary for the project, protocol modifications will be submitted to the HS IRB to change the protocol 
to fit the required changes.  
6.5 Unexpected Findings  
Whenever tests like the electrocar diogram (Visit 1) , cardiac output (Visits 3 and 6), or serum 
laboratory tests  are done,  there is the chance of an unexpected finding. Subjects will  be 
informed of all findings of clear clinical significance which may be revealed during the electrocardiogram , cardiac output procedure ( limited echocardiography) , and serum 
laboratory tests . Findings of clear clinical significance are those for which we generally know 
the risks of non -treatment and for which treatment may be available. If unexpected findings 
for the electrocardiogram , cardiac output, or serum laboratory tests  are discovered, a letter 
describing the findings will be sent to the subject  and to his/her physician with permission from 
the subject.  
 
 
7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
The primary outcome will be the change in the slope response of MSNA during progressive hypoxia from baseline to 6 weeks.  From previous data from our lab we have seen an approximate 
standard deviation for slope in OSA patients under similar progressive hypoxia of 8- 10.   
 
Based on interim data, a power calculation for the differences and standard deviations in primary outcome variable estimated that we would have 90% power (this is increased power from our 
original sample size calculation that used 80%) to determine a difference of 3.07 (1.13 vs -1.94) 
at a significance level of 0.017 (Bonferroni adjusted alpha for 3 tests) if we had complete MSNA 
slope response data from 20 subjects per group.   
 
We had originally proposed to enroll 50 subjects per group.  Our interim analysis determined that 
if we obtain complete data in 20 subjects per group, we are likely to find a significant difference.  
We will enroll as many subjects as we can in the remaining time frame to give us the best possible 
chance at finding a difference.  Consistent with DMC recommendations, we will reduce our sample size to 100 subjects.   To account for drop- outs, we will ask to enroll 120 subjects  to get 
100 subjects who proceed t o randomization.      
 
Pharmacologic Interventions for Cardiovascular Disease in Obstructive Sleep Apnea  
  Page 19 
Version: 2 3, 7-25 -17 
CONFIDENTIAL  7.2 Statistical Methods  
Data will be analyzed by a statistician blinded to drug assignment. Demographic comparisons to 
assess effectiveness of randomization will be examined between treatment arms by ANOVA and 
chi-square tests where appropriate.  Differences in baseline values for all variables between 
treatment arms will be assessed using ANOVA.  The paired differences in these same variables 
will be compared after the 6- week study period.  These values include all measured physiologic 
variables, such as resting heart rate, blood pressure, plasma catecholamine concentrations, 
MSNA, cerebral blood flow, forearm blood flow, flow -mediated vasodilation, pulse wave velocity, 
augmentation index, polysomnographic measures, Pcrit, apnea threshold,  and others.   
 The primary outcome variable is the difference in the individual slope of the MSNA – SaO 2 
response curve at 6 weeks and baseline between treatment groups.  The MSNA – SaO 2 response 
curve will be graphed with MSNA as the dependent variable and SaO 2 as the independent 
variable during progressive hypoxia.  Slope response curves will also be calculated for heart rate, 
ventilation, forearm blood flow, cerebral blood flow, and blood pressure during hypoxia, hyperoxia 
and controlled breathing periods.  MSNA will be expressed as burst frequency (bursts/min), burst 
amplitude (arbitrary units) and total minute activity (burst frequency x mean burst amplitude). MSNA will be averaged over the 5 -min measurement periods at baseline, 90%, 85%, 80% 
hypoxia, and during controlled breathing. During hyperoxic trials, 15- sec averages of MSNA will 
be obtained, and an average of the 4 trials will be computed. The slope response of MSNA during progressive hypoxia will be calculated and will be analyzed using ANOVA.   Changes in 
polysomnographic measures from baseline to the end of the 6- week treatment period between 
the treatment groups will be compared using ANOVA.  If significant ANOVA p- values are found, 
then post -hoc multiple comparison Tukey HSD tests will examine differences between each 
arms.  Multiple regression will be used to determine the influence of subject characteristics and 
hours of CPAP use on the primary outcome, and on the effect of treatment on the primary 
outcome.
 
 
7.3 Subject Population(s) for Analys is 
This study will follow a Intent to Treat (ITT) philosophy.  Loss to follow -up is a possibility and can 
cause issues with final analysis because the “missingness” of the data may not be random.  We 
will try to determine if there is any cause for drop out and summarize the reasons accordingly.  
We have accounted for drop outs in our projected sample sizes to assure sufficient power to 
remain in our tests.  We will test the sensitivity of the analysis results by comparing the analysis 
between dropping those with missing data and utilizing last observation carried forward .  In regard  
to the measurements taken at each time period, if a subject is unwilling or unable to complete the full progressive hypoxia we will calculate the slope for that individual based on the data we were able to attain and use that in the final analysis.  
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related documents 
such as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
Pharmacologic Interventions for Cardiovascular Disease in Obstructive Sleep Apnea  
  Page 20 
Version: 2 3, 7-25 -17 
CONFIDENTIAL  • Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been 
caused by the procedures involved in the research)  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm).  
 Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any sympt om, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as 
adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance  
 Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non- serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE 
that fulfills at least one of the following criteria:  
• is fatal 
• is life-threatening 
• requires or prolongs hospital stay  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• is an important medical event  
 Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly 
of major clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, 
a seizure that did not result in in- patient hospitalization, or intensive treatment of bronchospasm 
in an emergency department would typically be considered serious.  
 All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-
serious adverse events .  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
Adverse events must be reported once the subject undergoes any study procedures and adverse 
events must be reported during the entire active study period (6 weeks) and for 30 days following the last administration of study treatment.   
 General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality shall  be recorded as a preexisting condition.  
Throughout the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition 
of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
 Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by the investigator until the events are resolved, 
the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled 
visit, the investigator will instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, 
Pharmacologic Interventions for Cardiovascular Disease in Obstructive Sleep Apnea  
  Page 21 
Version: 2 3, 7-25 -17 
CONFIDENTIAL  or the subject’s personal physician, believes  might be related to participation in this study.  The 
investigator should notify the study sponsor and IRB of any serious adverse event or death 
occurring up to 30 days after the  subject has discontinued or terminated study participation that 
may be related to this study.  Study staff will contact the subject 30 days after study participation 
has ended to ask about possible adverse effects after study drug discontinuation.  
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one of the 
following conditions is met:   
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the 
abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  (e.g. serum creatinine increases 
more than 0.4 mg/dL)  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic 
investigat ion, etc.  
 
Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization or Surgery  
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization will be documented 
and reported as a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for an adverse event.   
 
Neither the condition, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are reported as an 
adverse event in the following circumstance: 
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical procedures 
for a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse 
event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
8.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
At each contact with the subject, the investigator will seek information on adverse events by 
specific questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all adverse events will  
be recorded immediately in the source document  (AE Assessment form) , and also in the 
appropriate ongoing subject AE log.  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic 
procedures results will be  recorded in the source document . 
 All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The clinical course of each 
event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study 
treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the 
end of the study period will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse 
event that occurs up to 30 days after Visit 6 and is considered to be possibly related to the study 
treatment or study participation will be recorded and reported immediately.  
8.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems  
All serious adverse events (AE) will be reported to the appropriate authorities, including the UW 
IRB and D MC in the required timeframe.  Adverse events and SAEs will be reported to the DMC 
and study sponsor (NHLBI) within the same time frame as required for the IRB (see 8.3.1 and 
8.3.2 below).  
 
Pharmacologic Interventions for Cardiovascular Disease in Obstructive Sleep Apnea  
  Page 22 
Version: 2 3, 7-25 -17 
CONFIDENTIAL  Investigators must conform to the adverse event reporting timelines, formats and requirements of 
the various entities to which they are responsible, but at a minimum those events that must be 
reported are those that are:  
• related to study participation,  
• unexpected, and  
• serious  or involve risks to subjects or others  
• Multiple occurrences of an AE that, based on an aggregate analysis, is determined to 
be an unanticipated problem. There should be a determination that the series of AEs 
represents a signal that the AEs were not just  isolated occurrences and involve risk to 
human subjects.  
• An AE that is described or addressed in the investigator’s brochure, protocol, or informed consent documents that occurs at a specificity or severity that is inconsistent 
with prior observations OR for which the rate of occurrence in the study represents a 
clinically significant increase in the expected rate of occurrence.  
• Any AE or safety finding (e.g., based on animal or epidemiologic data) that would cause the sponsor to modify the investigator’s  brochure, study protocol, or informed consent 
documents, or would prompt other action by the IRB to ensure the protection of human 
subjects.  
 
(see definitions, section 8.1).   
 
If the report is supplied as a narrative, the minimum necessary information to be provided at the 
time of the initial report includes:  
• Study identifier  
• Study Center  
• Subject number  
• A description of the event  
• Date of onset  
• Study AE Assessment form • Current status  
• Whether study treatment was discontinued 
• The reason why the event is classified as 
serious  
• Investigator assessment of the association 
between the event and study treatment  
8.3.1 Investigat or reporting: notifying the  IRB 
All adverse events and serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB at the appropriate and required time intervals.  This will include acutely and yearly at the annual protocol renewal.  
 Will be reported immediately:   
• Any serious adverse event  that occurs any time during or up to 30 days after  the research 
study, which in the opinion of the principal investigator meets all 3 of these criteria: 
1. Is Unexpected (An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not 
accurately reflected in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved 
research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB -approved 
informed consent document and other relevant sources of information, such as product 
labeling and package inserts .) 
2.  Is Related to the research procedures (An event is “related to the research procedures” 
if in the opinion of the principal investigator or sponsor, the event was more likely than 
not to be caused by the research procedures.)  
3. Is Immediately life -threatening or severely debilitating to other current subjects  
Will be reported within 14 days:  
• Any other adverse events listed below will be reported within 14 days  
Pharmacologic Interventions for Cardiovascular Disease in Obstructive Sleep Apnea  
  Page 23 
Version: 2 3, 7-25 -17 
CONFIDENTIAL  1. A single occurrence of a serious, unexpected event that is uncommon and strongly 
associated with drug exposure (such as angioedema);  
2. A single occurrence, or more often a small number of occurrences, of a serious, unexpected event not commonly associated with drug exposure, but uncommon in the 
study population.  
3. Multiple occurrences of an AE that, based on an aggregate analysis, is determined to be 
an unanticipated problem. There should be a determination that the series of AEs represents a signal that the AEs were not just isolated occurrences and involve risk to 
human subjects (e.g. a comparison of rates across treatment groups reveals higher rate 
in the drug treatment arm versus a control).  
4. An AE that is described or addressed in the protocol or informed consent documents that 
occurs at a specificity or severity that is inconsistent with prior observations OR for which 
the rate of occurrence in the study represents a clinically significant increase in the 
expected rate of occurrence.  
5. Any AE or safety finding (e.g., based on animal or epidemiologic data) that would cause the sponsor to modify the investigator’s brochure, study protocol, or informed consent 
documents, or would prompt other action by the IRB to ensure the protection of human 
subjects.  
Will be reported annually at continuing progress review:  
• Occurred locally (or at any WiNHR study sites ); 
• Are related to the research study but unexpected;   
• Were not assessed as placing subjects or others at increased risks (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized; 
 
• Were not assessed as resulting in new information that needed to be disseminated to participants; and 
 
8.3.2 Sponsor reporting:  
Notifying NHLBI  
The investigators will appropriately notify NHLBI using expedited reporting to the NHLBI Program 
Officer for serious adverse events and unexpected problems. The reporting of adverse events 
and SAEs will be reported to NHLBI within the same timeframe as required by the IRB (see 8.3.1 above).   Expedited safety reports will be sent concurrently to the DMC and NHLBI and the DMC 
response will be forwarded to NHLBI within 14 days.  
8.3.3 Sponsor reporting: Notifying the FDA  
 
The investigators will appropriately notify the FDA in safety reports. The following describes the 
safety reporting requirements by timeline for reporting and associated type of event:  
 
• Within 7 calendar days  
Any study event that is : 
– associated with the use of the study drug  
– unexpected,  
– fatal or lif e-threatening, and  
• Within 15 calendar days 
Any study event that is : 
– associated with the use of the study drug,  
Pharmacologic Interventions for Cardiovascular Disease in Obstructive Sleep Apnea  
  Page 24 
Version: 2 3, 7-25 -17 
CONFIDENTIAL  – unexpected, and  
– serious, but not fatal or life- threatening  
-or- 
– a previous adverse event that was not initially deemed reportable but is later found to 
fit the criteria for reporting (reporting within 15 calendar days from when event was 
deemed reportable).  
 
8.4 Unblinding Procedures  
Unblinding of the study medication will be done in emergent circumstances where the identity of the study medication needs to be known.  All efforts will be made to maintain blinding except in 
the case of urgent medical necessity.  If a subject needs to be unblinded, the study staff should 
contact the PIs and the PRC and the DMC for unblinding (using contact information below).  The 
PI will work with the PRC to unblind the situation without compromising the blinding of remaining 
subjects.  The investigator will follow all NIH and institutional rules for the timely and appropriate 
notification of the governing IRB.  In most cases, the unblinding will be part of managing an SAE, 
and will be reported with the SAE, however, in cases where unblinding was not associated with 
an SAE, such actions should be reported in a timely manner.

8.5 Stopping Rules  
 
In case there is a significant beneficial or harmful effect due to one or both of the treatment arms, which would require early termination of the study, we plan on having three interim data analyses.  
Interim analysis will be performed after approximately 33%, 66%, and 100% of the subjects 
complete the 6- week study period.  Stopping criteria for benefit/harm will be based on the primary 
outcome variable analysis with O'Brien- Fleming alpha spending thresholds for three interim 
analyses.  These thresholds are: p=0.0005 at look 1, p=0.01413 at look 2, and p=0.04507 at final 
analysis.  The DMC, concurrent with and additional to the interim analyses, will meet on a 
quarterly basis to evaluate the protocol, subject accrual rates, subject retention, adverse events, 
and other aspects of the study.  In those meetings which correspond to the times determined for interim analyses the DMC will also evaluate the benefit or harm of the treatments.  
8.6 Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee used for this trial will be the University of Wisconsin Institute  for Clinic al and Translational Research D MC.  The project’s statistician, Dr. DeMets sit s 
on the committee along with other ICTR personnel  to oversee the project.
 Mr. Hetzel (our study 
statistician) will make the data presentations to the ICTR DMC.  Dr. DeMets will recuse himself from discussion of this project during DMC meetings to avoid conflict of interest for discussion of 
this protocol.

Data will be summarized and provided directly to the DMC through the OnCore CRM clinica l trial 
software used for data collection during the study.  The DMC will keep minutes of its meetings and the PIs and all study staff will receive verbal and written summaries of their reviews and 
recommendations.  
 
8.7  Study Coordination and Data Monitoring 
The WiNHR Central Administrative Office personnel based at the University of Wisconsin, along with UW ICTR Clinical Research Infrastructure System (CRIS) Study Monitoring Service 
personnel, will complete Site Initiation Visit  procedures at each performance site after IRB 
approval is confirmed and before enrollment of any subjects into the study.   The Site Initiation 
Visit will include a summary of all monitoring activities and expectations during the study.   The 
WiNHR Central Administrative Office personnel  will monitor study activities at each site through 
biweekly study personnel conference calls and through weekly assessment of OnCore study 
data.   In addition, the study will be formally monitored using the the (CRIS) Study Monitoring 
Service.   Beyond the Site Initiation Visit activity described above, CRIS Monitoring personnel will 
perform study monitoring at each performance site following enrollment of their first 
subject,  ongoing interim study monitoring every 3 -6 months throughout the study, along with  a 
closeout study monitoring visit upon completion of the study.   Finally, this study will utilize the  UW 
ICTR Data and Safety Monitoring Committee.  The project’s statisticians, Dr. DeMets and Dr. 
Hetzel will sit on the committee along with other ICTR personnel to oversee the project.
  Data will 
be summarized and provided directly to the DMC through the OnCore CRM clinical trial software used for data collection during the study.   The DMC will keep minutes of its meetings and the PIs 
and all study staff will receive verbal and written summaries of their reviews and 
recommendations.  
 The University of Wisconsin will be the lead site of the study.   Specific responsibilities for 
coordination inherent to being a lead site are as follows: 1) WiNHR will facilitate biweekly study 
coordinator conference calls for discussion of current accrual and study -specific questions; 2) 
WiNHR Central Administration personnel (Deb Kruser, WiNHR Director , MJ Washburn, WiNHR 
Regional Research Networks Coordinator, Kelly Miller, WiNHR  Senior  Research Coordinator and 
Greg Guilfoil, WiNHR  Senior  Research Coordinator. ) will serve as first -line communication conduit 
for questions from outlying sites and will refer questions, as necessary, to the UW -Madison 
Investigators; 3) WiNHR Central Administration Personnel will provide regular updates to the 
WiNHR Advisory Committee regarding study progress and pertinent updates; 4) UW -Madison 
and other site Investigators will participate on WiNHR biweekly study coordinator calls, as needed; 5) UW -Madison Investigators, working with WiNHR Central Administration, will facilitate ongoing 
site Investigator teleconferences and/or   live meetings for discussion of study progress; 6) UW 
Madison Investigators will participate with WiNHR Central Administration personnel in Site 
Initiation Visits which will be completed prior to the enrollment of subjects at any performance sites; 7) WiNHR Central Administration personnel will work with ICTR Study Monitoring Service 
personnel to coordinate their site visits; 8) the UW -Madison study coordinator and sleep tech will

CONFIDENTIAL  perform  study -specific activities with enrolled subjects and will communicate regularly with 
WiNHR Central Administration personnel and the Study Investigators.  
9 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
9.1 Confidentiality 
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  All 
subjects will sign an informed consent document and HIPAA authorization that names specific privacy and confidentiality rights.  Study data will be maintained per Federal and State data 
policies.   Subject data that is entered and stored in OnCore CRM database is coded with a study 
number generated by the OnCore system.  The ICTR data management team will work with 
investigators to collect only relevant, applicable study data, which will be entered in a secure web -
based system with restricted access.  
 OnCore is an electronic data management system that will be used to capture, edit, manage, and 
export study data for analysis.  
 
The research team will manage study data through OnCore.  Access to the OnCore system is restricted to those that have been granted access by the software administrators. User access 
requires supervisor approval, completion of HIPAA and Human Subjects Protection training, and 
completion of role- based training in the OnCore system.  In addition, users’ access is limited to 
protocols for which they have some responsibility of protocol, subject, or data management. 
Within those protocols, the ability to view and modify data is restricted based on their role in the 
conduct of the research project (e.g. regulatory staff do not have the privilege to view subject 
identifiable information).  
 
In addition, the technical components of this software are managed by the UW -Madison’s 
Bioinformatics Computing Group (for server maintenance, software upgrades, etc.), and security 
and software support is provided by ICTR administrative staff.  
All communication between the clients and the OnCore application takes place via Hypertext 
Transfer Protocol over Secure Socket Layer or HTTPS. HTTPS provide the ability for normal web 
based communication over an encrypted Secure Socket Layer (SSL) connection. This ensures 
that data passing between the client and OnCore is protected from unauthorized attempts to access the data.  
 
The OnCore system is web- based software, with data stored on secure servers. Data exported 
from the OnCore System, is exported with indirect identifiers (i.e. with study ID number per 
subject) for statistical and data monitoring purposes in an MS Excel or SAS format. Upon exportation, the clinical research management system has no control over how it is manipulated 
or managed.  
9.2 Source Documents  
All source data will be kept and merged and/or entered into the electronic clinical trial software 
(OnCore CRM).  Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, 
or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  
Source data are contained in source documents.  Examples of these original documents, and 
data records include: hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, 
Pharmacologic Interventions for Cardiovascular Disease in Obstructive Sleep Apnea  
  Page 27 
Version: 2 3, 7-25 -17 
CONFIDENTIAL  subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from 
automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate and 
complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, 
and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico- technical departments 
involved in the clinical trial.  
9.3 Case Report Forms  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a section of the 
CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, please 
document reason on the source document.  If the item is not applicable to the individual case, 
document  “N/A”.  
 
9.4 Data Collection at Sites    
Data will be collected at Marshfield Clinic , Gundersen Health System, and Aurora Bay Care at 
the screening visit (Visit 1) and subject monitoring visit (Visit 4).  In addition, 24 -ambulatory blood 
press ure monitoring will be performed at each site (Visits 2 and 5).  Data from these visits 
including subject demographic information, vital signs, laboratory test values, and other subject information will be uploaded into OnCore CRM clinical trial software.  As a result all investigators 
will be able to access subject data from the screening visit and monitoring visit.  It is vital that all 
investigators can access data from the monitoring visit for safety reasons and monitoring of the 
study medications.  Data for the primary outcome variable will be uploaded into OnCore from Visit 
3 and Visit 6 and will be made available for the data and safety monitoring committee when they 
meet quarterly and for interim/final analyses after 33%, 66%, and 100% of subjects have been enrolled.   
 
9.5 Data analysis at Brigham and Women’s Hospital  
 
Dr. Scott Sands, at Brigham and Women’s Hospital  will analyze some study data by isolating 
individual waveforms obtained from sleep studies.    Data will be transmitted to Dr. Sands by 
using a restricted Box folder within the password protected UW Box program.  The data that will 
be shared with Dr. Sands consists of individual waveforms from sleep studies.  The waveform 
files will be labeled with the subject’s unique study ID number and will not contain any other 
identifiers.  Coded sleep study files will be uploaded for Dr. Sands to access .  He will extract  
data from individual waveforms, and then summarize and score the data, and make the scor ed 
files available on Box .  Dr. Sands will not have access to the key that links the code to 
identifiable data.  Brigham and Women’s Hospital (Partners IRB) is deferring IRB oversight to 
the University of Wisconsin- Madison.   UW-Madison IRB will serve as the IRB of record for this 
study.   
  
 
 9.6 Data sharing with 2016- 0988 study (PI: Claudia Korcarz)  
 
Study data collected in this study will be shared with the 2016 -0988 study (PI: Claudia Korcarz).  
The rationale for using this data in the 2016 -0988 study is that this data contains information 
about PAP compliance, risk factors, demographics, etc.  IRB approval has already been 
obtained for the use of this data in the 2016 -0988 protocol.

effectiveness of the TactiCath  Percutaneous Ablation Catheter for the treatment of 
symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation using contact force assisted irrigat ed 
radiofrequency ablation  
DEVICE 
DESCRIPTION  The TactiCath Set  includes the TactiCath Catheter and the TactiSys® Equipment.  
The TactiCath  catheter is a steerable, irrigated percutaneous catheter for endocardial 
mapping and radiofrequency (RF) ablation, incorporating a tri-axial contact force 
sensor at the distal tip. The sensor allows precise measurement of the forc e applied by 
the catheter to the heart wall in real time.  
The TactiSys  Equipment includes the Base S tation and Splitter , which provide 
standard interconnection with commonly used laboratory equipment and is used for 
processing and display of data.  The syst em displays detailed force information by 
determining the cross product of axial and lateral force components to obtain the  
resultant force vector, fully describing the contact force at the point of contact between 
the catheter and tissue surface.  
STUDY DESIGN  TOCCASTAR is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, interventional study to 
evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the TactiCath Set for the treatment of 
symptomatic atrial fibrillation (PAF) using contact force assisted irrigated RF ablation.  
Patients undergoing elective catheter ablation for symptomatic PAF who are refractory 
or intolerant to at least one  antiarrhythmic drug (Class  I-IV) will be screened for 
enrollment. Patients who meet the study entry criteria and sign the patient informed 
consent form will be enrolled and treated following the 2007 Heart Rhythm Society 
(HRS)/European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA)/European Cardiac Arrhythmia 
Society (ECAS) Expert Consensus Statement on Catheter and Surgical Ablation for 
Atrial Fibrillation.  
Eligible patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive treatment with either the 
TactiCath Set or the control device (the NaviStar® ThermoCool® open irrigated RF 
ablation catheter  manufactured by Biosense Webster, Inc.) Use of three -dimensional 
(3D) m apping equipment will be required in both treatment groups. Patients will be 
blinded to treatment assignment. This study aims to demonstrate non -inferiority of the 
study device to the control device for both safety and effectiveness.  
After the index proced ure, patients will be followed for a total of 12  months for 
chronic effectiveness assessment,  beginning with a 3-month  blanking period and 
ending with a 9-month  effectiveness assessment period. During the blanking period, 
patients may be prescribed a previ ously ineffective antiarrhythmic drug and undergo 
up to 2 repeat ablation procedures (up to 10  days prior to end of the blanking period) 
using the same device specified by the initial randomization. Patients will be evaluated 
at pre -discharge, at 7  days, a t 3, 6 and 12  months post -index procedure  and every 6 
months thereafter until PMA approval.  
Patients will be enrolled at up to 30  sites in t he United States (US) and elsewhere . A 
maximum of 50% of patients may be enrolled outside the US.

SUPPLEMENTAL 
CLINCIAL 
STUDY  To evaluate the comparative safety of a product evolution (TactiCath Quartz Set) 
relative to the original TactiCath  Set, up to an additional 50 subjects will be enrolled in 
a supplemental phase to the Toccastar Study. These subjects will comply  with the 
same protocol requirements for patient selection, treatment and follow -up as a roll -in 
subject; they will not be randomized. Data from the supplemental patients will be 
reported separately from the randomized population and will not contribute to  the 
primary study endpoints.  
Please refer to Appendix J (Supplemental Clinical Study) for a description of the 
supplemental study and specific variance from the randomized protocol, where 
applicable.  
CONTINUED 
ACCESS STUDY  Continued access to the TactiCath Quartz Set is provided during the regulatory review 
period for the Pre -Market Application. An additional 150 subjects at the original IDE 
sites may be enrolled as part of the Continued Access Study. These subjects will 
adhere to the same protocol  requirements for patient selection and treatment with a 
simplified schedule of follow -up. Subjects enrolled in the Continued Access Study will 
not be randomized. Data from these subjects will be reported descriptively and 
separately from the randomized po pulation as well as the Supplemental Clinical Study 
population.  
Please refer to Appendix K (Continued Access Study) for a description of the 
Continued Access Study and specific variance from the TOCCASTAR and 
Supplemental Clinical Study, where applicable.  
OBJECTIVES  Effectiveness : To provide valid scientific evidence that use of the TactiCath Set is an 
effective treatment for symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF).  
Safety : To provide valid scientific evidence that use of the TactiCath  Set is safe as 
measured by the incidence of early -onset serious adverse events (SAEs) when  
compared to the control device.  
PRIMARY 
ENDPOINTS  Effectiveness  
The primary effectiveness endpoint of the study is a non -inferiority comparison of 
treatment succes s between the TactiCath Set and the control device as defined by both:  
 Acute procedural success  - electrical isolation of a ll 4 pulmonary veins (PVs) , or 
in the event of a common PV, the clinical equivalent of all PVs  by the end of 
index procedure  
 Chronic success  - acute procedural success and freedom from recurrence of 
symptomatic PAF, atrial flutter (AFL), and atrial tachycardia (AT) lasting longer 
than 30  seconds through 9 months of follow -up after a 3 month blanking period. 
Re-treatment for AF with abla tion or the use of Class  I or Class  III antiarrhythmic 
drugs after the blanking period constitute s a treatment failure.  
Safety  
The primary safety  endpoint is a non -inferiority c omparison of device -related 
early -onset primary SAEs between the TactiCath Set and the control device occurring 
within 7 days of the index procedure or hospital discharge, whichever is later, and 
diagnosed at any time during the follow -up period.

SECONDARY 
ENDPOINTS  Effectiveness  
The secondary effectiveness endpoints are related to the use of the contact force sensor 
and will assess procedural effectiveness superiority of the TactiCath Set over the 
control device.  It is hypothesized that the use of the contact force sensor information 
will result in added procedural effectiveness thr ough a reduction of:  
1. Number of electrically reconnected pulmonary veins following a 30 -minute 
waiting period assessed by entrance block  
2. Time to achieve total PV isolation measured from initial application of RF energy 
to all target vessels isolated  
3. Total time of RF application required for full PV isolation  
Safety  
Incidence of all serious adverse events ( SAEs) during the 12 -month  follow -up period

 Percentage of patients free of symptomatic AF episodes after treatment with 
combination therapy (previously failed AADs and/or ablation) after 12 months  
 Percentage of patients free of symptomatic and/or asymptomatic episodes of AF 
after 12 months  
 Freedom from AF/AFL/AT at 12 months by 24 hour Holter  
 Total fluoroscop y time  
 Number of RF applications  
 Length of hospitalization  
 Occurrence of repeat ablations (incidence and time from index procedure)  
 Use of antiarrhythmic drugs  
 Quality of life assessment  
 TactiCath Set contact force data  
NUMBER OF 
PATIENTS  A target of 300 patients (maximum 4 40) will be randomized . Interim analysis will be 
conducted when 50% of the patients have completed the 6 -month follow -up 
procedures, and may result in a decision by the data safety monitoring board (DSMB) 
and Endosense to enroll addition al patients.  
To allow for a period of familiarization with the unique features of the TactiCath Set, 
each site will be permitted to use the study device in up to 5  patients (roll -in 
population) who will not contribute data to the primary endpoint analyses. Data from 
the roll -in population will be reported separately.

3. INTRODUCTION  
3.1 Device Name  
The device under clinical investigation is the Endosense TactiCath Set  (TactiCath Catheter 
and TactiSys  Equipment) . 
3.2 Disease State  
With a high risk for stroke at 1.6% per year and a primary prevalence of 6  million people, 
atrial fibrillation ( AF) is a one of the biggest treatment challenges for cardiologists today.2-4 
AF is one of a diverse group of arrhythmias collectively described as supra -ventricular 
tachyarrhythmia  (SVT). In SVT, the  trigger originates in the atrium or the atrium is part of 
the re -entry mechanism for triggering or maintaining the arrhythmia. SVTs  vary considerably 
in their rate and regularity, their clinical manifestations, and the setting in which they occur. 
These arrhythmias are characteristically abrupt in onset and termination and are often seen in 
patients who do not have evidence of organic heart disease. Although these disturbances in 
rhythm are generally not malignant in the short -term, in p atients with organic heart disease a 
rapid atrial  rhythm may produce significant hemodynamic complications. In some patients 
with pre -excitation syndromes combined with an anterograde accessory pathway, there is 
also a risk of sudden death.  
SVTs are usually divided into the following 3  groups:  
 Supra -ventricular tachycardias ( i.e., atrial tachycardia  [AT] , sino -atrial node re -entry, 
intra-atrial re -entry, atrioventricular reentrant tachycardias [Wolff -Parkinson -White 
syndrome], and atrioventricular nod al reentrant tachycardia)  
 Atrial flutter (AFL)  
 Atrial fibrillation (AF)  
 
Long-term outcome s for symptomatic AF patients treated exclusively with drugs remains 
poor.5,6 Treatment of AF using RF ablation or surgery has become  increasing ly importan t. 
Various techniques are being proposed that use ablation in the left atrium.4 
 
3.3 Radiofrequency Ablation  
Radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation is a minimally invasive procedure commonly used for 
more than 20  years to treat most of the recurrent supra -ventricular tach yarrhythmias.1-3 
Recent advances in the underlying science and technology of ablation for AF have identified 
the benefits of irrigation and temperature monitoring to control for char formation and reduce 
embolic risk. A steerable catheter tip provides addi tional flexibility for catheter placement. 
These features have been incorporated in the design of the TactiCath catheter.  
 VP-002 527  Page 19 of 92 
 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Version H  
DO N OT COPY – PROPERTY OF ENDOSENSE  
With the exception of AF, supra -ventricular tachyarrhythmias can be treated by ablation in 
the right atrium only. For the treatment of  AF, an intervention in the left atrium is required.  
3.4 Background  
The 2006 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association 
(AHA)/European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the treatment of AF  
recommend  catheter ablation as a second -line therapy after a patient has been shown to be 
refractory or intolerant to at least one Class  I or III antiarrhythmic medication.2 The 2007 
Heart Rhythm Society (HRS)/European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA)/European 
Cardiac Arrhythmia Society (ECAS) Exp ert Consensus Statement on Catheter and Surgical 
Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation  reiterates this recommendation .3 The 2009 Comparative 
Effectiveness  Review of Radiofrequency Catheter A blation  published by the US Department 
of Health and Human Services furt her describes the risks and benefits associated with RF 
ablation for PAF.27 
Circumferential electrical isolation of the entire pulmonary vein (PV) musculature is now 
common practice  for patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF)  in whom one or more  
antiarrhythmic agents have failed. This procedure, also known as PV isolation, seeks to block 
the conduction of arrhythmia triggers originating in PV foci and  has become the accepted 
approach for AF ablation worldwide. The risks for this procedure are kno wn and include 
complications such as tamponade, stroke, severe PV stenosis, esophageal fistula, major 
bleeding requiring surgery or transfusion, and death. Based on voluntary international 
surveys (self -reported results), t he currently reported  complicatio n rate is 5.9%, with a fatal 
outcome in 0.1% of patients.7, 8 
3.5 Rationale for Development of the TactiCath Set  
Recent nonclinical research has shown that sufficient contact force between the ablation tip 
and target tissue is an important  determinant of effective lesion creation, although  higher 
contact force  increase s the risk for complications such as steam pop formation, thrombus 
formation, and perforations.9-20 Applying the correct  contact force during catheter ablation is 
important. Insufficient con tact force may result in an ineffective procedure as the lesion 
remains superficial and does not achieve the required lesion depth , there by permitting 
electrical reconnection and a resumption of symptoms . Conversely , excessive contact force 
may result in c omplications such as perforation of the heart wall, steam pop formation, or 
esophageal injury. Currently, electrophysiologists generally  rely on subjective interpretation  
of electrocardiograms (ECGs), fluoroscopic images and handling cues  to determine how 
much force to apply at each lesion site . Establishing a stable  contact force between the 
catheter and the endocardial surface  remains one of the key challenges in the catheter 
ablation procedure.  
To address this need, Endosense has developed a novel contac t force sensor that is embedded 
in the TactiCath catheter that allows measurement of the tip to tissue contact force during  the 
RF ablation procedure. With the TactiCath Set, the physician is expected to be able to better 
position the ablation catheter by monitoring real -time contact force  information  during 
 VP-002 527  Page 20 of 92

mapping and ablation. It is hypothesized that lesions created with a n optimal  catheter contact 
force will improve  long-term freedom from recurrence  in patients.  
The topic of contact force sensing during  ablation is gaining international attention at an 
increasing rate  as evidenced by the recent  15th Annual Boston AF Symposium (14  –
16 Jan 2010)  at which  a symposium session dedicated to this topic was presented .21 The 
session made clear that in addition to  Endosense, other  device companies are developing  
contact force assisted  RF ablation catheters to address this need .22 To date , Endosense is the 
only company that has conducted a multi -center clinical study of an ablation catheter with an 
integrat ed force sensor, the TOCCATA study23 (Section 3.7).  
3.6 Nonclinical Testing of the TactiCath Set  
Comprehensive nonclinical testing of the TactiCath Set has been perform ed to validate and 
verify the device design in support of the clinical study. Nonclinical testing consisted of  
functional and procedural testing in both bench and animal laboratory settings.  
Additional animal studies unrelated to the Investigational Device  Exemption ( IDE) 
submission were previously conducted to characterize parameters for the safe use of the 
TactiCath Set including evaluations of perforation force, correlation of force with lesion size, 
and correlation of force with esophageal injury.9-14,16,17,20  
3.6.1 Investigation of the TactiCath Set in an Animal Model  
A study  approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)  was 
performed in GLP -like conditions to assess  the safety and effectivene ss of the TactiCath Set. 
Various parameters w ere assessed in a series of 8 animals including packaging and sterility, 
catheter deployment and steerability, intracardiac signal quality, compatibility with cath lab 
equipment, irrigated RF ablation success, force sensor functionality during mapping and 
ablation and visualization of contact force. The TactiCath system performed to specification 
while mapping all 4 chambers and delivering lesions to isolate 2 targeted pulmonary veins in 
each animal which remained isolated after a minimum of one hour. All a nimals survived the 
procedure with no significant adverse events such as PV stenosis, esophageal injury, cardiac 
tamponade, respiratory distress or uncontrollable bleeding.  
3.7 Prior Clinical Experience with the TactiCath Set  
The TactiCath Set was extensively studied in Europe during the TOCCATA study , whic h 
began enrollments in late 2008  and concluded follow -up in early 2010.23 In this 
non-randomized, European, safety, performance and preliminary effectiveness study, 
21 operators used the TactiCath Set  to trea t a total of  76 patients (34 AF, 27 AFL, and 15 
other supra -ventricular tachycardias) . Patients were followed  for one year.  
The primary safety endpoints of the study were met.  The study characterized, for the first 
time, the wide range of contact forces th at are typical in the course of an atrial ablation 
procedure. Results from the TOCCATA study were successfully submitted in support of an 
application for CE mark of approval granted in May 2009.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Version H  
DO N OT COPY – PROPERTY OF ENDOSENSE  
Data from the long -term follow -up of patients enrolled in TOCCATA recently presented at 
the Cardiostim 2010 meeting29 describe a correlation between average contact force applied 
during ablation and freedom from arrhythmia recurrence at 6 months. AF Patients treated 
with RF ablation whose arrhythmias recurred experienced significantly lower average 
contact force during a blation than patients without recurrence (14.9g vs. 19.0g, p=0.039).  
Unpublished data presented at this meeting updated these results to demonstrate an even 
more significant difference at 12 months (14.5g vs. 19.5g, p=0.01). These results suggest that 
a subgroup analysis may be relevant in the TOCCASTAR study to separately report on 
outcomes for patients with higher average contact force during ablation.  
3.8 Supplemental Clinical Study  
The initial randomized phase of the TOCCASTAR Study began enrollment in Jan uary of 
2011 and has completed enrollment as of June 2012. The study data is expected to be 
submitted in an original PMA in Q3 of 2013 . 
In November  of 2013, an IDE supplement will be submitted to request  the further enrollment 
of up to 50 non -randomized pa tients using an evolutionary version of the study device known 
as the TactiCath Quartz Set . This device received CE mark in May of 2012 and has been 
used in a commercial setting outside the US since June of 2012 . Prior to first clinical use  in 
the US , a co mprehensive verification and validation study will confirm the operation and 
robustness of the new device . 
The main objective of the Supplemental Clinical Study will be to provide confirmatory 
evidence regarding the acute safety and effectiveness of the Ta ctiCath Quartz Set in patients 
with symptomatic PAF. In principle, the TactiCath Quartz Set will pro vide the same 
therapeutic and diagnostic functionality to the operator during use as the TactiCath Set. The 
risks  and benefits  will also be the same. The  new device  will be evaluated in an identical 
patient population (in clusion and exclusion criteria)  using the same procedural methodology 
as the randomized s tudy.  
Given the similarities in patient populations, device functionality, and procedural testing 
requirements, the acute procedural and 30 day safety data from the TactiCath Quartz Set may 
be compared with data from the TactiCath Set. Therefore, a minimum of 30 days of follow -
up data on 50 subjects will be submitted for FDA review, plus any additional fol low- up data 
available at the time of submission. Subjects enrolled in the supplemental study will comply 
with the same extended follow -up requirements from the randomized  study (every 6 months 
until PMA approval) that will provide additional safety and ef fectiveness data from the post -
assessment period through PMA approval.  
Sites that agree to participate in the Supplemental Clinical Study will be required to obtain 
IRB approval of the Clinical Investigation Plan, Version F and the corresponding Patient 
Informed Consent. Subjects previously enrolled in the TOCCASTAR Study will not be 
affected by the  protocol revision, however re -consenting of these subjects is at the discretion 
of the participating site.

Conduct of the Supplemental Clinical Study will conf orm to the initial randomized 
TOCCASTAR Study except where indicated. Details regarding the Supplemental Clinical 
Study, especially with respect to differences from the randomized study, are provided in 
APPENDIX J.  
 
3.9 Continued Access Study  
The last subject enrollment in the TOCCASTAR Study occurred in June 2013. This includes 
randomized, roll -in and Supplemental Clinical Study subjects. The TOCCASTAR Clinical 
Study Report was received by FDA on 29 November 2013 thus completing the PMA  
submission . The TOCCAST AR study  submission presented preliminary evidence that the 
TactiCath Quartz Set is likely to be effective and that no significant safety concerns have 
been identified for the proposed indication  of treatment of drug refractory symptomatic 
paroxysmal atria l fibrillation .  
In January 2014 , an IDE supplement will be submitted for continued access to TactiCath 
Quartz S et for existing investigators during the period of regulatory review of the 
TOCCASTAR PMA submission. The request will be for  enrollment of up t o 150 non -
randomized patients that will be treated with the TactiCath Quartz Set under the same 
indication to provide confirmatory evidence of safety and effectiveness.  The previous  
TOCCAS TAR clinical protocol (Version F ) and Patient Informed Consent will  be modified 
to reflect the addition of the Continued Access Study  (Version H). The devices  used in the 
Continued Access Study will be the same as were used during the Supplemental Clinical 
Study.  
Sites that agree to participate in the Continued Access Stu dy will be required to obtain IRB 
approval of Version H of the Protocol and the corresponding Patient Informed Consent. 
Subjects already enrolled in the TOCCASTAR Study and the Supplemental Study will not be 
affected by the protocol revision, however re -consenting of existing subjects is at the 
discretion of the participating site.  
Conduct of the Continued Access Study will conform to the initial randomized 
TOCCASTAR Study except where indicated. Details regarding the Continued Access Study 
are provided in APPENDIX K.  
3.10 Summary  
Based on these considerations, the Endosense TactiCath Set (TactiCath Catheter and 
TactiSys  Equipment) may be a valuable addition to existing technology available to treat 
PAF and should be further studied in an IDE clinical trial.

4. INTENDED USE  AND DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
4.1 Intended Use  
The TactiCath Set is intended to be used during ablation of PAF to perform PV isolation and 
to create other lesions as needed to safely and effectively eliminate undesirable arr hythmia 
triggers and prevent the recurrence of arrhythmia . The embedded contact force sensor 
provides additional diagnostic information during catheter manipulation to aid in the creation 
of optimal lesions.  
4.2 Device  Description  
The TactiCath Set24 includes  the TactiCath Catheter  and the  TactiSys  Equipment , which are 
described below and are illustrated in Figure 1.

4.2.1 Functionality of the TactiCath Set  
The TactiCath  Set has been designed to perform the following functions in the setting of a 
clinical electrophysiology laboratory:  
 Transmitting cardiac signals for monitoring  
 Transmitting pac ing signals for electrophysiological study  
 Transmitting RF energy to the heart wall  
 Objective real time measurement and visualization of the contact force between the catheter 
tip and the endocardial surface  
 Storing and reporting of procedural data collect ed from the contact force sensor and 
adjunctive equipment  
4.2.2 TactiCath Catheter  
The Endosense TactiCath Contact Force Ablation Catheter  (version number PN -003 165) is a 
multi -electrode irrigated catheter with a deflectable tip designed to allow 
electrophysiol ogical mapping of the heart and, when connected to an RF generator, to 
transmit radiofrequency current to the catheter tip electrode for the purpose of ablation.  
RF generators to be used with TactiCath must  be compatible with the functional requirements 
of TactiCath as specified in the TactiSys User Manual a nd part of a commercially approved 
system in the US f or performing cardiac ablations.  
The catheter tip has an integrated force sensor that, when used with the TactiSys  Equipment , 
allows  real-time visualization of the catheter tip contact force.  
The TactiCath catheter has the same size  as and is designed to be similar to other 
state-of-the-art open tip irrigated RF ablation catheters. The TactiCath catheter can be 
integrated into an existing electro physiology lab and connected with an RF generator, 
cooling pump, and three -dimensional (3D) imaging system s. 
4.2.3 TactiSys  Components  
The TactiSys  Equipment includes the Base Station and S plitter , which provide standard 
interconnection with commonly used labora tory equipment for data processing and display. 
The system displays detailed force information by determining the cross product of axial and 
lateral force components to obtain the resultant force vector, fully describing the force at the 
point of contact b etween the catheter and tissue surface.  
 Base Station  
The Base Station is the principal signal processing unit of the TactiCath Set. It hosts the main 
piece of software, TactiSoft, which collects the force sensing signal from the catheter tip and 
computes t he force values that are shown on the display.

 Splitter  
The Splitter is the interface between the catheter and the Base Station, and between the 
catheter and the RF generator.  
The Splitter is compatible with the Endosense TactiCath Catheter PN -003 165. 
4.2.4 Related Components  
The following related components are required to operate the TactiCath Set but are not part 
of the TactiCath Set:  
 RF generator

5. STUDY PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES  
5.1 Study Purpose  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the  safety and effectiveness of the  TactiCath Set 
when used to treat PAF when compared  to an approved control device. Prospective contact 
force data  will be collected and analyzed t o evaluate  the importance of real -time contact 
force sensing d uring the RF ablation procedure.  
5.2 Study Objectives  
5.2.1 Effectivenes s 
To provide valid scientific evidence that use of the TactiCath Set is an effective treatment for 
symptomatic PAF.  
5.2.2 Safety  
To provide valid scientific evidence that use of the TactiCath Set is sa fe as measured by the 
incidence of early -onset serious adverse events (SAEs) when  compared to the control device.  
6. STUDY ENDPOINTS  
The following study endpoints will be evaluated for all patients who satisfy entry criteria, are 
randomized, and are subsequently enrolled into the study.  
6.1 Primary Endpoints  
6.1.1 Effectiveness  
The primary effectiveness endpoint of the study is a non -inferiority  comparison of treatment 
success between the TactiCath Set and the control device as defined by both : 
 VP-002 527  Page 26 of 92 
 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Version H  
DO N OT COPY – PROPERTY OF ENDOSENSE  
 Acute procedural success  - electrical isolation of a ll 4 PVs, or in the event of a co mmon PV, 
the clinical equivalent of all PVs,  by the end of index proc edure  (with the device specified by  
the randomization arm ). 
 Chronic success - acute procedural success and freedom from recurrence of symptomatic AF, 
AFL, and AT lasting longer than 30  seconds through 9  months of follow -up after a 3 month 
blanking period. Re-treatment for AF with ablation or the use of Class  I or Class  III 
antiarrhythmic drugs after the blanking period constitute a treatment failure . 
6.1.2 Safety  
The primary safety  endpoint is a non -inferiority c omparison of device -related early -onset 
primary SAEs between the TactiCath Set and the control device occurring within 7 days of 
the index procedure or hospital discharge, whichever is later, and diagnosed at any time 
during the follow -up period.  PSAEs that meet the severity criteria described i n Table 2 will 
contr ibute to  the primary safety endpoint only in patients in whom a  study device (TactiCath  
or control) has been introduced.  
Hospitalizations solely for arrhythmia recurrence (without coexisting conditions such as 
thromboembolism, worsening heart failure, etc.) will not be considered primary SAEs.  
6.2 Secondary Endpoints  
6.2.1 Effectiveness  
The secondary effectiveness endpoints are relate d to the use of the contact  force sensor and 
will assess procedural effectiveness superiority of the TactiCath Set over the control device  
using a hierarchical closed test procedure . It is hypothesized that the use of the contact force 
sensor information w ill result in added procedural effectiveness through a reduction of : 
1. Number of electrically reconnected pulmonary vei ns following a 30 -minute waiting 
period  assessed by entrance block  
2. Time  to achieve total PV isolation measured from initial application of RF energy to  all 
target vessels isolated  
3. Total time of RF application required for full PV isolation  
6.2.2 Safety  
The secondary safety endpoint will evaluate  the incidence of all serious adverse events  
during the 12 -month  follow -up period . 
6.3 Descriptive Endpoints  
6.3.1 Effectiveness  
The following parameters will be reported as observational endpoints:  
 Percentage of patients free of symptomatic AF episodes after treatment with combination 
therapy (previously failed AADs and/or ablation) after 12 months  
 VP-002 527  Page 27 of 92 
 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Version H  
DO N OT COPY – PROPERTY OF ENDOSENSE  
 Percentage of patie nts free of symptomatic and/or asymptomatic episodes of AF after 12 
months  
 Freedom from AF/AFL/AT at 12 months by 24 hour Holter  
 Total fluoroscopy time  
 Number of RF applications  
 Length of hospitalization  
 Occurrence of repeat ablations (incidence and time from index procedure)  
 Use of antiarrhythmic drugs  
 Quality of life assessment  
 TactiCath Set contact force data   
o Force distribution – distribution of forces employed during ablation per patient procedure  
o Contact force (CF) parameters during ablation includin g: number of ablations, average 
CF, standard deviation CF, minimum average CF, maximum average CF, 5th percentile 
average CF, 95th percentile average CF – correlate CF parameters with recurrence, time 
to PV isolation, acute success, and other procedural ef ficiency parameters  
o Force Time Integral (FTI) – correlate FTI with recurrence, time to PV isolation, acute 
success, and other procedural efficiency parameters  
o Trends – comparison of force data from the first third treated patients with the last third 
treated patients across and within centers and per operator  
 
6.4 Subgroup Analyses  
The primary and secondary safety and effectiveness endpoints will be compared (via 
superiority testing) between the control group and a subgroup of patients from the TactiCath 
arm wh ose average contact force during ablation was ≥ 20 g.  
 
7. STUDY DESIGN  
TOCCASTAR  is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, interventional study to evaluate the 
safety and effectiveness of the TactiCath Set for the treatment of symptomatic PAF using 
contact f orce assisted irrigated RF ablation.  
Patients undergoing elective catheter ablation for symptomatic PAF who are refractory or 
intolerant to at least one antiarrhythmic drug (Class  I-IV) will be enrolled. Patients who meet 
the study entry criteria and sign the patient informed consent form will be enrolled and 
treated following the HRS/EHRA/ECAS Expert Consensus Statement on Catheter and 
Surgical Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation.3 
Eligible p atients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive treatment with either the TactiCath 
Set or the control device (the NaviStar® ThermoCool® open irrigated RF ablation catheter 
manufactured by Biosense  Webster, Inc.) Use of 3D mapping equipment will be required in 
both treatment groups. Patients will be blinded to treatment assignment. This study aims to 
 VP-002 527  Page 28 of 92 
 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Version H  
DO N OT COPY – PROPERTY OF ENDOSENSE  
demonstrate non -inferiority of the study device to the control device for both safety and 
effectiven ess. 
 
If chronic success is determined to be less than 40% for either the treatment group or the 
control group, additional exploratory analyses focused on explaining the suboptimal results  
will be performed.  
7.1 Investigational Sites  
Up to 30  sites in the Unit ed States  and elsewhere  will be invited to participate in the study . 
Investigators will be selected from the electrophysiology specialty and will agree to comply 
with all aspects of the investigational protocol. Use of a djunctive equipment will be limited 
to devices approved in the US  unless approved for use as part of a sub -study . 
7.2 Study Population  
The trial will be conducted in 300 randomized patients with symptomatic PAF (1 50 patients 
per treatment group) who are refractory or intolerant to at least one antiarrhythmic drug 
(Class  I-IV). A maximum of 50% of patients may be enrolled outside the US.  
Eligible patients will be included in the study as they become available. Treatments will be 
randomly assigned ( Section 10.2.2 ). Patients will remain blinded to their treatment 
assignment throughout the study  (Section 10.2.3 ). 
Subject s who sign an informed consent and satisfy all pre -operative entry criteria will be 
considered for randomization and treatment. Consented subjects who do not satisfy entry 
criteria are screen failures and will not receive treatment under this protocol. Tho se screen 
failures will conclude their participation in the study without further follow -up or data 
collection activities.  
Subjects in whom PVI is contraindicated based on an intra -operative finding such as  
AVRT/AVNRT will be excluded from the primary endp oint analyses.  These subjects will be 
followed for safety only. Data from these subjects will be reported separately.  
7.3 Roll-in Patient Procedures  
To allow for a period of familiarization with the unique features of the TactiCath Set, each 
site will be permi tted to use the study device in up to 5  patients that are not randomized in 
the study , up to 100 total roll -in patients.  The roll -in patient population will be screened, 
consented, and treated with the TactiCath Set , and followed  per protocol for 12 months.  
Data from patients who participate in roll -in procedures will be excluded from the primary 
endpoint analyses . Data from the roll -in population  will be reported separately in the study 
report.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Version H  
DO N OT COPY – PROPERTY OF ENDOSENSE  
7.4 Supplemental Clinical Study Procedures  
As a supp lement to the original TOCCSTAR Study, up to 50 additional non -randomized 
patients will be enrolled  in a Supplemental Clinical Study. For the purposes of screening, 
consent, treatment and follow -up, these subjects will be treated identically to the roll -in 
patient population (with the exception of CT/MR scans  that are no longer required ). Details 
regarding the Supplemental Clinical Study procedures are provided in APPENDIX J.  
7.5 Continued Access Study Procedures  
During the Continued Access phase of the study , up to 150 additional non -randomized 
patients will be enrolled . These subjects must meet the same enrollment criteria, undergo the 
same consent process, same treatment and follow -up as the initial randomized TOCCASTAR  
Study  with the following  exceptions : 
 CT/MR scans are recommended but not required  
 Ambulatory monitoring with TTM is no longer required  and is replaced with 
additional instances of Holter monitoring at 3, 6, and 12 months  
Details regarding study procedures during the Continued Access Study are p rovided in 
Appendix K.  
7.6 Study Assessment Intervals  
For the purpose of assessing study endpoints,  patients will be followed for a total of 
12 months after the index procedure beginning  with a 3 -month blanking period  and ending 
with a 9 -month effectiveness assessment period . During the blanking period, patients may be 
prescribed a previously ineffective antiarrhythmic drug and undergo up to 2 repeat ablation 
procedures (up to 10  days prior to end of the blanking  period)  using the device specified by 
the init ial randomization . Enrolled p atients will be evaluated according to the 
HRS/EHRA/ECAS Expert Consensus Statement3 at pre -discharge, at 7  days, and at 3, 6, and 
12 months post -index procedure.  After the 12 -month follow -up, patients will be contacted 
periodically ( every 6 months until the post market approval ( PMA ) is granted , and if 
approved, thereafter according to post -approval  requirements) to assess general health  and 
well-being . 
Assuming approximately 12  months for patient enrollment and a 12 -month follow -up period 
per patient (including a 3 -month blanking period), this study is expected to require 
appro ximately 24  months to complete.  
When FDA approves a device for commercial use in the United States, they often ask that 
patients in the clinical t rial agree to continue monitoring for several more years to confirm 
the long -term re sults of the study. If this occurs , the study will extend for up to 5 years from 
the time of the initial procedure. FDA has stipulated that informed  consent will include  
participation in the Toccastar s tudy as well as a possible post -approval study that may be 
specified by FDA at a later date.

7.7 Patient Withdrawal  
All patients are free to withdraw from participation in this study at any time, for any reason, 
and without preju dice.  
Patients may be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:  
 Patient requests early discontinuation  
 Patient is lost to follow -up 
The clinical investigator may terminate a patient from the study at any time for lack of 
therapeutic effec t that is intolerable to the patient, or otherwise considered unacceptable, for 
intolerable or unacceptable AEs, intercurrent illness, noncompliance with study procedures, 
administrative reasons, or in the clinical investigator’s opinion, to protect the pa tient’s best 
interest.  
Patients who request early discontinuation will be considered as having withdrawn consent 
only after they have signed the Withdrawal of Consent Form. Patients who withdraw consent 
will receive standard of care treatment.  
The clinical  investigator will make every effort to collect information about patients who are 
lost to follow -up. 
If a patient is withdrawn before completing the study, the reason for withdrawal (assuming 
the patient is willing and able to share this information) will  be entered on the Study 
Completion Form. Patients who withdraw before completing the study will be followed only 
through the date of their withdrawal.  
In addition, any comments (spontaneous or elicited) or complaints made by the patient or 
physician carin g for the patient but not involved in the investigation will be documented on 
the eCRF.

10. STUDY PROCEDURES  
Cardiac medications and protocol deviations will be recorded from the time of signing the 
informed consent through the date of study completion or withdrawal.  
10.1 Screening and Informed Consent Procedures  
When a suitab le candidate requiring ablation for PAF presents for consideration for 
enrollment in the study, the investigator will explain the potential risks and benefits of 
participation to the patient. Patients will be provided with a copy of the informed consent fo r 
review and will be given ample opportunity to read and pose questions they may have about 
the study. If after review, the patient agrees to participate, the informed consent will be 
signed by the patient and recorded on a screening/enrollment log. If a p atient subsequently 
fails to meet eligibility criteria, they will be considered a screening failure and may receive 
standard of care for their condition outside of the study.  
10.2 Pre-treatment Procedures  
10.2.1  Baseline Evaluations  
The following baseline evaluations will be performed for eligible patients within 30  days (or 
as indicated) prior to the planned treatment procedure.  
1. Written informed consent  
2. Evaluation of inclusion/exclusion criteria  
3. Documentation of 3 symptomatic PAF episodes and one PAF episode >  30 seconds 
evidenced by ECG tracing (any source) within  12 months  
4. Medical history, including demographics, arrhythmia diagnosis, cardiovascular risk factors, 
cardiac medication  
5. Arrhythmia  history  - patient should be refractory or intolerant to at least one Class  I-IV 
antiarrhythmic drug  
6. General physical examination including vital signs, height, and weight  
7. Prothrombin time (PT)/ partial thromboplastin time (PTT) or international normalized ra tio 
(INR) following standard clinical practice  
8. Blood tests of thyroid  and renal function following standard clinical practice

12. Assessment of atrial thrombus . Either via trans -esophageal echocardiography (TEE) within a 
period of 24 hours prior to the treatment proced ure or, intracardiac echo (ICE) at the time of 
the procedure  in patients currently in normal sinus rhythm with no history of cerebrovascular 
accident.  
13. Location, mor phology, and dimensions of PVs using computed tomography (CT) scan or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  within 60 days  (recommended but not required for 
Supplemental Clinical Study  and Continued Access Study  subjects)  
14. Assessment of left atrial diameter via trans -thoracic echocardiography (TTE) within a period 
of 6 months prior to the treatment procedure  
15. Negative pregnancy test results for female patients of childbearing potential (following the 
site’s usual practice)  
10.2.2  Randomization  
Patients who complete requi red baseline evaluations and meet eligibility criteria for the study 
may be enrolled. Randomization to treatment arm is accomplished by the investigator using 
an Interactive Web Response System. Patients recruited into the roll -in patient population 
will n ot be randomized.  (Subjects participating in the Supplemental Clinical Study and 
Continued Access Study will not be randomized.)  
10.2.3  Blinding to assigned treatment  
All patients will be blinded to treatment assignment. Study personnel , who may be  
unblinded, sho uld not disclose any treatment information to the patient prior to unblinding of 
study data.  
10.3 Ablation  Procedure  
The following procedural requirements apply to all ablation procedures conducted during the 
study:  
1. An approved 3D mapping system will be used in all procedures consistent with device 
labeling in the case of the control device and with any compatible system in the case of the 
TactiCath Catheter.  
2. If TEE was not performed within the past 24 hours to assess  atrial thrombus, an ICE 
assessment must be performed at the time of the procedure. In case of a positive finding, the 
procedure will be postponed and the patient placed on anticoagulation until freedom from 
thrombus can be confirmed.  
3. Enrollment, treatment , and peri -procedure follow -up of AF patients will conform to the 
HRS/EHRA/ECAS Expert Consensus Statement3 including a treatment strategy to isolate all 
PVs.  
4. A standard treatment scheme of mapping and ablation will be conducted during the 
interventional p rocedure followed by confirmation of entry block at 30  minutes after full 
 VP-002 527  Page 37 of 92 
 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Version H  
DO N OT COPY – PROPERTY OF ENDOSENSE  
isolation of all PVs.  In addition, IV isoproterenol (up to 20 μg/min) should be infused to test 
for both induced non -PV triggers and to elicit latent PV conduction.  
5. Any prior existin g or induced supra -ventricular arrhythmia indicated for treatment with 
ablation should be treated as part of the PV isolation index procedure unless clinically 
contra -indicated. Pre-existing or induced t ypical AFL should be treated with ablation of the 
cavo-tricuspid isthmus line. If atypical flutter  is induced, the decision to ablate is at the 
discretion of the physician.   
6. All ablations in the left atrium must be performed using the device specified by 
randomization. Use of a different device in the left a trium constitutes an acute treatment 
failure.  
7. In the absence of a clinical or induced arrhythmia, additional ablation lesion sets (e.g., 
prophylactic linear lesions, ablation of CFAE sites, etc.) should not be performed.  
8. PVI may be omitted if contraindicat ed in the judgment of the investigator in patients 
presenting with AVRT/AVNRT.  
9. In the TactiCath treatment group, contact force data will be provided to the operator and 
collected throughout the procedure. Intermittent catheter tip contact should be avoided  during 
lesion creation.  
10. Ablation should be performed with the minimum power needed in the judgment of the 
investigator. The maximum RF power during ablation using the TactiCath study device is 
limited to 40W. Use of the control study device should follow the approved labeling and 
instructions for use.  
11. A multipolar “ lasso ” type mapping catheter will be deployed in the target vein pre- and post -
ablation  to monitor PV potentials.  
12. Catheters will be irrigated at a continuous rate of 2  ml per minute (ml/ min) whe n not 
ablating, and during ablation at a minimum of either 17 ml/min  (RF power up to 30W) or 
30 ml/min. 
13. The integrity of the p hrenic nerve should be evaluated before and after abla tion of the right 
superior PV. In patients who are breathing  spontaneously (not under general anesthesia), 
observe  normal diaphragmatic excursion of the right hemi -diaphragm  under fluoroscopy . In 
patients under general anesthesia, verify phrenic nerve functionality by placing a catheter in 
the lateral SVC and pacing the phrenic nerve.  
14. The lower level of anticoagulation should be maintained at an ACT of at least 300 
throughout the procedure, and higher targets (up to 400) may be used as indicated . 
15. Physicians are required to use each study device according to labeling and in a manner 
consistent with their standard clinical practice. In particular, the operator must not adapt or 
otherwise deviate from ablation technique normally employed when using the control device.

10.3.1  Peri-procedure Safety Recommendations  
Consistent with  data published in the HRS /EHRA /ECAS  Expert Consensus Statement on 
Catheter and Surgical Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation,3 the following  peri-procedure 
precautions are strongly recommended to minimize risks to patient safety : 
 Esophageal temperature monito ring – it is strongly recommended that esophageal 
temperature be monitored using an esophageal temperature probe at the anatomical location 
nearest the site of energy delivery.  
 Intracardiac  echocardiography (ICE) – use of an ICE probe during the procedure to guide 
septal puncture and to monitor catheter position and manipulation is strongly recommended.  
 RF power settings in the TactiCath group – it is generally feasible to increase contact f orce 
rather than RF power, if needed, to produce an adequate lesion depth. RF power may be 
titrated downwards based on increased contact force according to the clinical judg ment of the 
operator. In the TactiCath group, it is recommended that RF ablation be  performed at an 
average contact force of approximately 20 grams.  
 Arrhythmia identification – it is recommended that a coronary sinus (CS) catheter be 
deployed past the Veussen's valve (into the great cardiac vein) to provide arrhythmia 
identification, li near lesion assessment, etc. Use of a diagnostic catheter in the right atrium

10.4 Pre-discharge Procedure  
Post-interventional medication and treatment will be implemented according to the 
HRS/EHRA/ECAS Expert Consensus Statement.3 
The following post -treatment evaluations will be performed within 72  hours (or as indicated) 
after the treatment procedure and before discharging the patient:  
 TTE within 24  hours post -procedure is recommended to exclude pericardial effusion  
 General physical e xamination including vital signs  
 PT/PTT or INR following standard clinical practice  
 12-lead ECG  
 Recording of any  cardiac medications , arrhythmia events, AEs, or protocol deviations  
10.5 Follow -up Procedures  
For the purpose of assessing study endpoints, p atients  will be followed for a total of 
12 months after the index procedure beginning  with a 3 -month blanking period  and ending 
with a 9 -month effectiveness assessment period. During the blanking period, up to 
2 additional RF ablation procedures may be performed (up to 10  days prior to end of the 
blanking  period) and patients may be prescribed previously ineffective antiarrhythmic drugs. 
Patients indicated for a repeat procedure will be treated according to their initial 
randomization group.

Patients with treatmen t failure after the 3 -month blanking period (i.e., symptomatic 
arrhythmia recurrence, re -treatment for AF with ablation, cardioversion for AF/AFL/AT, the 
use of Class  I or Class  III antiarrhythmic drugs .) and patients with more than 2 repeat 
ablations duri ng the blanking period, will be followed per protocol but assessed for safety 
only.  
Subjects who experience a documented symptomatic episode of AF/AFL/AT (lasting longer 
than 30 seconds) during the 9 -month effectiveness assessment period will be classified  as a 
treatment failure. Documentation of the episode by standard 12 lead ECG recording may be 
shorter than 30 seconds in duration.  
Patients who do not experience treatment failure will undergo the following assessments 
described below at 7  days, at 3, 6, and 12  months post -index procedure , and every 6 months 
thereafter . Following the conclusion of the study, FDA may require a period of continued 
follow -up (Post -approval Study) that will last up to 5 years from the time of the initial 
procedure. Patients wh o withdraw before completing the study (Section  7.7) will be followed 
only through the date of their withdrawal.  
To avoid deviation from protocol, follow -up proced ures must be completed during a window 
of time specified by the target date (time post -index procedure) and occurring within a fixed 
number of days/weeks before and after as described below. The schedule for follow -up 
procedures is determined by the date o f the initial ablation procedure. Retreatment at any 
time will not ‘reset the clock’ for follow -up. 
10.5.1  7-Day Follow -up Procedure  
At 7 days post -index procedure (± 2 days) or at hospital discharge, whichever is later, 
patients will be contacted via telephone by the investigator for a safety assessment.  The 
following data will be collected:  
 Cardiac medications  
 Arrhythmia events  
 Adverse events  
 Protocol deviations  
10.5.2  3-Month Follow -up Procedure  
At 3 month s (± 2 weeks) post-index procedure, the following evaluations will be scheduled 
and data will be recorded:

device is approved , patients will be contacted via telephone by the investigator for a general 
health  assessment.  The following data will be collected:  
 Adverse events (related to s urvival and cardiac -related hospitalization ) 
 Arrhythmia history  
10.5.6  Post-approval Study

10.6 Re-ablation Procedure  
10.6.1  Retreatment During t he Blanking Period  
 
Patients may be re -treated with ablation up to two times during the blanking period but no 
later than 10 days before the end of the blanking period. Re -treatment during this interval 
will not constitute a treatment failure and must be p erformed with the device specified by the 
initial randomization.  
10.6.2  Retreatment After the Blanking Period  
 
Re-treatment after the blanking period will constitute a treatment failure. All re -ablation 
procedures after blanking must be performed with a commerci ally available device labeled 
for use in the US for the treatment of AF, e.g. the control device.  
10.7 Imaging for PV Stenosis  
If evidence of PV stenosis is seen at the 3 -month follow -up when compared to the baseline 
scan, it is recommended that the subject und ergo additional serial CT/MRI scans as deemed 
clinically appropriate by the investigator . 
10.8 Ambulatory Monitoring  
Ambulatory monitoring for symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes of AF will be 
conducted throughout the 9-month  effectiveness assessment period.  
10.8.1  Transtelephonic Monitoring  
Patients will be issued a transtelephonic monitoring (TTM) device one month after the 
ablation procedure. They will be  instructed to transmit an ECG weekly beginning  with the 
3-month follow -up until 5  months after the index proce dure, and then monthly  until the end 
of the study. In addition  to these recurring scheduled  transmissions , patients will be 
instructed to record and transmit an ECG coincident  with any occurrence of symptoms 
associated with AF  at any time during follow -up. A core laboratory will review each 
recording and report findings to the investigator . 
10.8.2  Holter Monitoring  
Patients will be issued a Holter monitor at the 12 -month follow -up and instructed to obtain a 
24-hour recording. A core laboratory will review each re cording and report findings to the 
investigator.

10.9 Antiarrhythmic Drug Management  
10.9.1  Blanking Period  
It has been shown that AAD treatment during the 6 weeks after ablation for paroxysmal AF 
reduces the risk for early recurrence of atrial arrhythmias and the nee d for hospitalization or 
cardioversion.26 It is recommended that any current antiarrhythmic medication be continued 
following the ablation procedure.  
Current AADs may be withdrawn 4-6 weeks after ablation to assess for recurrence of 
symptoms and the necess ity for re -ablation during the  blanking period.  
If documented  symptomatic AF recurs during the 3  month blanking period and the patient 
requires antia rrhythmic drug therapy, a previously ineffective but tolerated antia rrhythmic 
drug may be re -initiated to a llow for the assessment of its effectiveness  when combined with 
ablation.  
10.9.2  Effectiveness Assessment Period  
All Class I and Class III AADs will be discontinued at the end of the blanking period. The 
use of any Class I or Class III antiarrhythmic drug during  the effectiveness assessment  period 
will be considered an effectiveness failure.   Subjects enrolled in the Continued Access Study 
may be prescribed previously used Class I or Class III antiarrhythmic drugs . 
Beta-blockers , calcium channel blockers or digit alis may be used during the 9-month  
effectiveness assessment period if prescribed for reasons unrelated to arrhythmia 
management. Subjects are encouraged to continue their use through the end of the study 
unless it is determined to be unnecessary or detrim ental by the investigator .  
Subjects who experience a recurrence of symptomatic PAF after the blanking period 
(treatment failure) should retry a previously failed AAD before a new medication is 
prescribed to evaluate the effectiveness of combined ablation and drug therapy.  
10.10  Anticoagulant Drug Management  
Anticoagulant drug regimen will follow the HRS/EHRA/ECAS Expert Consensus 
Statement.3 Warfarin is recommended for all patients following the AF ablation procedure. 
For patients with a CHADS (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age  > 75 years, type  2 
diabetes, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack) score ≥ 2, continued use of warfarin is 
recommended.  
10.11  Early Termination Evaluation  
No formal early termination procedures  will be conducted. Patients who withdraw before 
completing the study (Section  7.7) will be followed only through the date of their 
withdrawal.

11. PATIENT BENEFITS AN D RISKS  
A risk analysis (per ISO  14971) of the medical device has been conducted  through 
appropriate design control and confirmed by nonclinical bench, laboratory, and animal 
testing  to mi nimiz e risks to the patient.  
11.1 Potential Benefits  to Study Subjects  
Receiving benefit from participation in the study is not guaranteed.  Anticipated benefits to 
patients may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 Patients who receive treatment with the study device may experience shorter ablation 
procedure time and improved outcomes, although these objectives may not be demonstrated 
in this study   
 Patients  who participate in the study may receive more frequent and/or detailed follow -up 
than is normally prescribed as standard of care  in any given practice  
 Overall adva ncement of medical and scientific knowledge may benefit future patients with 
similar conditions   
11.2 Potential Risks to Study Subjects  
Risks to patients enrolled in this study include all those risks currently associated with all 
electrophysiology diagnostic procedures and RF catheter ablation procedures. The risks of 
the procedure are related primarily to mechanical injury to the heart and vessels from 
catheter manipulation and thermal injury due to RF current delivery, including the risk of 
thromboembolism a nd myocardial perforation, especially for ablations in the left atrium.  
 
For those procedures where the physician applies sedation or anesthesia, the standard risks of 
anesthesia also exist and include allergic reactions, pneumonia, aspiration pnuemonitis,  
atelectesis, prolonged sedation, other medical complications  and in very rare cases , death.   
Complications associated with the use of the TactiCath Set  may be related to the device or 
the procedure and they may include, but are not limited to the SAEs lis ted in Table 2 and the 
other AEs listed in Table 3. 
11.3 Clinical Events Committee  
An independent standing clinical events committee (CEC) consisting of members not 
otherwise associated with the trial, while blinded to treatment assignment, will r eview all 
SAEs and will adjudicate causality relative to the primary safety endpoints. The mode of 
operation of the CEC will be defined in a CEC Charter.  Contact information for the CEC is 
provided in Appendix  C.

11.4 Clinical Risk Analysis  
11.4.1  Increased Risks to Subjects Posed by  the Investigation  
All patients who are enrolled in the study will undergo pre -procedure testing that is 
considered standard of care at the participating institution. The investigator is obliged per 
protocol to perform the ablation procedu re in a manner consistent with device labeling and 
with their standard clinical practice. Subjects may be randomized to receive treatment with 
the TactiCath Set whose safety has not been assessed in a prospective, randomized trial.  
 
At most participating sites, patient follow -up procedures required per protocol are consistent 
with standard of care with the possible exception of an additional diagnostic scan at three 
months post -procedure and the use of diagnostic ambulatory monitoring throughout the 
follow -up period.  
 
The risks associated with the three month scan are the same as those for the baseline scan. 
For CT scans, the exposure to x -rays potentially increases the risk for cancer. For MR scans, 
the exposure to injected contrast agent may cause an all ergic reaction. Risks associated with 
the use of an ambulatory monitor (TTM or Holter) may include abrasion of the skin from the 
recording electrodes.  
 
The addition of a diagnostic contact force sensor is not expected to introduce new procedural 
risks. Une xpected failure of this diagnostic feature should not interfere with other functional 
aspects of the device related to mapping, pacing and RF energy delivery. In the TOCCATA 
study, 23 patients treated with the TactiCath Set for AF experienced similar or le ss serious 
adverse events than the historical control (12% vs. 16.8%, n=34).  
 
In summary, the increased risks to which subjects will be exposed by the investigation are 
limited to the risk that they may be treated with an unproven device and that they may be 
exposed to additional follow -up testing as described above.  
11.4.2  Manner in Which Risks Will be Minimized  
A risk analysis of the TactiCath Set has been conducted according to ISO  14971 Application 
of Risk Management to Medical Devices. Precautions have been t aken to minimize or 
eliminate risks through appropriate design controls as confirmed by nonclinical bench, 
laboratory and animal testing. In addition, a multi -center, non -randomized prospective 
clinical safety and performance study was conducted in Europe,  the TOCCATA study.23 In 
this study, 76  patients (34 AF, 27 AFL, and 15 other supraventricular tachycardias) were 
treated with a TactiCath catheter (version number PN -001 065) and followed for one year. 
The safety endpoints of this study were met and used to support a successful application for 
CE mark in May 2009.  
 VP-002 527  Page 45 of 92 
 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Version H  
DO N OT COPY – PROPERTY OF ENDOSENSE  
Patients treated with the study device will undergo an established procedure for which 
published guidelines exist1-4 and whose outcomes are documented in the literature.7-8, 27 The 
procedural and  follow -up requirements and recommendations within this clinical 
investigational plan reference these guidelines with the intention th at patients will be 
managed  consisten tly. 
Risks associated with the three month scans will be minimized by excluding patients from 
the study with a known contraindication to computed tomography or magnetic resonance 
angiography.  
Risks associated with the ablation procedure will be minimized by requiring operators to 
assess for atrial thrombus prior to ablation, to employ  an approved 3D mapping system, to 
maintain adequate irrigation and appropriate anti -coagulation, and to monitor for potential 
injury to the esophagus and phrenic nerve as part of the procedure.  
In addition, participating sites have been chosen for their demonstrated proficiency with both 
3D mapping systems that will be used (Carto and NavX) and will be trained extensively on 
the requirements of the protocol. Field clinical engineers trained in the use of the study 
device and the requirements of the protoc ol may monitor ablation procedures in the study. 
Sites will be monitored soon after enrollment begins to identify and address protocol 
deviations and unsafe practices, if any exist, in a timely manner.  
Frequent personal contact with subjects throughout th e follow -up period by the investigator 
and by TTM monitors trained to elicit patient complaints will help identify patients in need 
of medical care.  
11.4.3  Justification for the Investigation  
The availability of contact force data during catheter manipulation is intended to guide the 
safe and effective creation of ablation lesions by providing essential feedback to the operator 
related to catheter placement.  
The TactiCath catheter closely resembles a standard irrigated RF ablation catheter with 
respect to design, materials and usage. The incorporation of a diagnostic contact force sensor 
in the distal tip is an incremental feature with potential implications for improved safety and 
effectiveness. If desired, the force sensor data may be disregarded and the device m ay be 
employed similarly  to a standard, commercially available RF ablation catheter.  
The high rate of arrhythmia recurrence in this population has been shown to be the result of 
restored conduction between previously isolated pulmonary veins and the left a trium. 
Patients with recurrence frequently undergo one or more repeat ablation procedures, 
subjecting them to repeated procedural risks.  
Electrical reconnection is believed to result from inadequate lesion formation during 
ablation. Contact force measured between the ablation catheter tip and the tissue being 
ablated may be use d to position the catheter  to produce a sufficiently transmural lesion and 
theoretically promote better long -term isolation of the PVs.  
 VP-002 527  Page 46 of 92 
 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Version H  
DO N OT COPY – PROPERTY OF ENDOSENSE  
The TOCCATA study demonstrated safety in a smal l population (n=76) and showed a 
correlation between higher contact force and freedom from recurrence. Based on these 
considerations, the clinical investigation of the TactiCath Set is justified.  
11.4.4  Description of Patient Population  
A pre -defined sample of patients prescribed for PAF will be enrolled such that a statistically 
valid result may be obtained. In general, the distribution of age and gender is expected to 
reflect the incidence of PAF in the US and Europe with mean age in the mid to upper 50s and 
approximately one third female subjects.  
 
Per protocol, all subjects will have failed one or more anti -arrhythmic medications and will 
have symptoms during AF. Thus, the patient population being studied will be indicated for 
further treatment with ablation according to published guidelines.  
11.4.5  Adverse Events  
 
The definitions for adverse events, adverse device effects and unanticipated adverse device 
effects are provided in section 12.1 of the protocol. A tabulation of adverse events and the 
criteria that will b e used to assess severity is provided in section 12.2 of the protocol. 
Potential adverse events that may be associated with the ablation procedure are provided in 
section 12.3 of the protocol. Sponsor and investigator obligations for reporting adverse 
even ts are described in section 12.4 of the protocol.  
11.5 Conclusion  
An extensive Risk Analysis and Risk Mitigation plan has been implemented to minimize any 
residual risk of the TactiCath Set to the patient.  
Hands -on training o pportuni ties will be provided for o perators who are unfamiliar with the 
study device . These may include  simulations, using the study device in the non clinical 
setting , or the observ ation of clinical use of the study device by  experienced operators.  
We believe that the availability of  cathet er contact force information during a procedure may  
convey a benefit to the patient and outweigh any potential residual risk.

Parkinson’s, dementia, obsessive/compulsive or eating disorders. Other illness, if clearly 
isolated from the cardiovascular disease, including jaundice unrelated to systemic infection, 
infection in extremities unrelated to the procedure, bacterial infection or cellulitis.  
 Common ailments unrelated to the cardiovascular system, the ablati on procedure, a 
study device or the drugs used to treat cardiovascular illness  including common 
headache, muscle pain, food poisoning, superficial infections, rashes, warts, shingles, 
constipation, eczema, hernias, upper respiratory infections or influenza . 
12.1.2  Adverse Device Effects  
An ADE is defined as an y untoward and unintended response to a medical device.  This 
definition includes any event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in instructions 
for use or deployment of the device. This definition also includes any event that is a result of 
user error.  
12.1.3  Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs will be reported . An SAE is defined as any event that  
1. Leads to death,  
2. Leads to serious deterioration in the health of a patient that : 
a. Results  in a life -threatening illness or injury,  
b. Results  in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function,  
c. Requires  in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,  
d. Results  in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to a body

12.1.4  Serious Adverse Device Effects  
A serious adverse device effect (SADE) is defined as an ADE that results in any of the 
consequences characteristic of an SAE or that may lead to any of these consequences if 
suitable action is not taken or interventi on is not made or if circumstances are less opportune.  
12.1.5  Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect s (United States sites only)  
An unanticipated ADE is defined as any SADE on health or safety or any life -threatening 
problem or death caused by, or associated with, a  device, if that effect, problem, or death has 
not been previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the CIP or 
application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated 
serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of 
patients.  
12.2 Primary Serious Adverse Events  
Primary serious adverse events (PSAEs) related to the use of a study device (TactiCath or 
control) are defined as having occurred within 7 days of the ablat ion procedure or prior to 
pre-discharge , whichever is later, and diagnosed at any time during the follow -up period .  
PSAEs that meet the severity criteria described in  Table 2 will contr ibute to  the primary 
safety endpoint only in patients in whom a  study device has been introduced. 
Hospitalizations solely for arrhythmia recurrence (without coexisting conditions such as 
thromboembolism, worsening heart failure, etc.) will not be considered primary SAEs.

12.4 Handling and Reporting of Adverse Events  
Patients will be carefully monitored during the study for possible AEs. Any AE will be 
followed to a satisfactory resolution, until it becomes stable, or until it can be explained by 
another known cause(s) ( i.e., concurrent condition or medication) and clinical judgment 
indicates that further evaluation is not warranted. All findings relevant to the final outcome 
of an AE must be reported in the patient’s medical record.  
The clinical investigator will attempt to assess the involvement of the investigational device 
in the AE. All observations and clinical findings, including the nature, severity, and 
relationship, will be documented on the appropriate eCRFs.  
In case of death, the clinical investigator must make every effort to obtain a copy of the 
autopsy report and /or death certificate and transmit this to Premier Research Group Limited 
(Premier Research) . The patient’s  private information shall be concealed prior to transmittal 
to Premier Research . 
The clinical investigator will report all SAEs and ADEs to Premier Research by telephone or 
fax within 7 days  at the number provided by Premier Research. The clinical investi gator will 
provide a detailed written report within 14 days.   
Premier Research  will discuss with the clinical investigator and the safety advisory 
committee (as applicable), all ADEs and SAEs and coordinate appropriate actions, in 
particular their notifica tion to other clinical investigators and to the appropriate regulatory 
agencies  as applicable.  
For any event where there is a suspicion that the device is involved, Endosense may request 
that the clinical investigator return the device (when possible) for investigation at 
Endosense’s laboratory. Endosense will provide a procedure for cleaning and preparation as 
well as special kits for the return of used and potentially bio -hazardous materials.

12.4.1  European Reporting Obligations for European Investigators  
All SAEs must be reported to the IEC as per local regulations.  
All SADEs must be reported by both the clinical investigator and Premier Research  to the 
CA as per national regulations  and in accordance with the applicable sections of Medical 
Devices Directive  93/42/EEC  and ISO  14155 . 
12.4.2  United States Reporting Obligations for United States Investigators  
All SAEs must be reported to the IRB who approved the study within 7 days  (or sooner if so 
specified by  local IRB policy ). 
All SADEs  and UADEs  must be reported by Premier Research  to the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) within 10  days  after Premier Research  is first made aware of the 
event.  Reporting to the FDA will be consistent with 21 CFR Part  812.150.  
12.5 Early Termination or Suspension of the Clinical Investigation  
An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) comprised of members not otherwise 
associated with the trial will convene periodically to assess overall study safety. The DSMB 
will make recommendations regarding suspension of  the study on the basis of predefined 
conditions related to the incidence of AEs. The mode of operation of the DSMB will be 
defined in a DSMB Charter.  Contact information for the DSMB is provided in Appendix  D. 
The DSMB can use the decision rules described in Appendix  A as a reference. However, the 
DSMB can make its own recommendations based on aggregated information.  The DSMB 
and Endosense will decide if the suspension  of the study will be followed by a termination.  
13. DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE  
The study described in this CIP will be implemented  according to the local regulatory 
requirements (FDA, EU) and GCP . All procedures not described in this protocol will be 
performed according to approved written Standard Operating Procedures  (SOPs)  unless 
otherwise stated.  
Steps to assu re the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified clinical 
investigators and appropriate study sites, review of CIP procedures with the clinical 
investigator and associated personnel prior to the study, and periodic monitoring visi ts by 
Premier Research. Premier Research will review data for accuracy and completeness during 
and after on -site monitoring visits, and any discrepancies will be resolved with the clinical 
investigator or designees as appropriate.  
13.1 Case Report Forms  
The electronic case report forms ( eCRFs ) contain confidential material. Specific training on 
the complet ion of  eCRFs will be provided to the clinical investigator and other site personnel 
 VP-002 527  Page 53 of 92 
 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Version H  
DO N OT COPY – PROPERTY OF ENDOSENSE  
as appropriate. The clinical investigator is responsible for the accuracy a nd completeness of 
data report ed on  eCRFs.  
The clinical research associate (CRA ) will periodically verify the data entered onto the 
eCRFs against source documents to ensure data integrity, accuracy , and completeness of the 
data prior to locking  the eCRFs for tabulation of study endpoint data . 
13.2 Monitoring Procedures  
Premier Research monitors will conduct site visits to the study facilities to monitor the study  
and ensure compliance with the CIP, GCP, and applicable regulations and guidelines .  
The clinical i nvestigator agrees to allow these monitors and other authorized Endosense 
representatives  access to the clinical supplies dispensing and storage area and to study 
documentation for the above mentioned purpose and agrees to assist the monitors in their 
activities, if requested. Requests by regulatory agencies to inspect the study sites may be 
made. The clinical investigator agrees to allow inspectors from regulatory agencies to review 
records and to assist the inspectors in their duties, if requested.  
Source  documents include the physician or hospital patient records that are maintained at the 
study site. In most cases, the source documents will be the physician  or hospital patient chart. 
In some cases, the source documents may be electronic. In both cases, t he information 
captured on the eCRF must match the information in the chart or electronic source document. 
Periodically, the Premier Research monitor or Endosense representative will visit the study 
site for the purpose of directly comparing the data in th e eCRF with the source. The clinical 
investigator agrees to make source documents (hard copy or electronic) available for this 
purpose.  
It is the clinical investigator’s responsibility to ensure accurate completion of the eCRFs and 
to approve the eCRFs. The clinical investigator or a designated sub investigator  recognized 
by the IEC or IRB has the authority to sign  eCRFs. These electronic signatures serve to attest 
that the information contained in the eCRF is accurate and true.  
13.3 Data Management  
The standar d procedures for handling and processing records will be followed per GCP and 
Premier Research’s SOPs.  
A comprehensive Data Management Plan will be developed including a Data Management 
Overview, Database Contents, annotated eCRF, Pre -Entry Review List, S elf-evident 
Correction Conventions, Query Contacts, and Consistency Checks.

21. APPENDICES  
APPENDIX A ................................ ................................ .............................  Statistical Methods  
A.1 Determination of Sample Size  
A.1.1  Assumptions  
Data from the NaviStar® ThermoCool® Catheter premarket approval (PMA) study show ed 
that the treatment success rate at the end of the 9 -month post -blanking follow -up period was 
47% in the ThermoCool arm versus 18% in the antiarrhythmic drug arm after excluding a 
single site that was considered substantially different from the other sites. Data from the 
Endosense TOCCATA study using the TactiCath catheter also suggested a treatm ent success 
rate of approximately 48%. After excluding treatment failures due to the use of beta-
blockers , calcium channel blocker s, or angiotensin -converting enzyme inhibitor s that will not 
contribute to the endpoint of the TOCCA STAR study, treatment succ ess rate is expected to 
be around 55%.  
Data from the NaviStar® ThermoCool® Catheter PMA study show ed that the incidence of 
primary device or procedure related SAEs with an onset within 7  days of the procedure was 
13% after excluding a single site that was considered substantially different from the other 
sites. This rate was 12% in the TOCCATA study. Hospitalization solely due to AF/AFL/AT 
recurrences (approximately 3% based on the NaviStar® ThermoCool® Catheter PMA study 
and the TOCCATA study) will not be considered as device or procedure related SAEs in this 
study. Therefore, the incidence of primary SAEs within 7  days of the index procedure is 
expected to be ≥  9% in the TOCCA STAR study.  
A.1.2  Non-inferiority Margins  
This study aims to demonstrate non -inferiority of the  TactiCath  Set to the control device in 
both effectiveness and safety. Non -inferiority margin is 15% for effectiveness (treatment 
success rate at the end of the 9  month effectiveness assessment follow -up period 
post-blanking) and 9% for safe ty (incidence of primary SAEs with onset within 7  days of the 
index procedure or prior to hospital discharge and diagnosed throughout the study).  
A.1.3  Sample Size  
Let P t denote the percent of treatment success or the incidence of primary SAEs in the 
TactiCath treatment group and P c denote the corresponding rate in the control treatment 
group. Under these assumptions, a total of 274  patients (137  patients per treatment group ) 
will provide 80% power to reject the null hypothesis that (P t - Pc ≤ -0.15) with a one -sided 
0.05 significance level for the primary effectiveness endpoint. A total of 274  patients 
(137 patients per treatment group)  will provide 83% power to reject the null hypothesis that 
(Pt - Pc ≥ 0.09) with a one -sided 0.05 significance level for t he primary safety endpoint.  We 
further assume that approximately 10% of the randomized patients can be excluded from the 
 VP-002 527  Page 62 of 92 
 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Version H  
DO N OT COPY – PROPERTY OF ENDOSENSE  
denominator due to early terminations clearly unrelated to study device, or excluded from the 
per-protocol population due to major prot ocol violations. Therefore, the study will randomize 
approximately 300 patients.  
In addition, to allow for a period of familiarization with the unique features of the TactiCath 
Set, each site will be permitted to enroll up to 5  roll-in patients  who will no t be randomized. 
The number of roll -in patients in the entire study shall be limited to 100.   
In order to prevent bias in the results due to different performance o f a single site, no more 
than 15 % of patients will be enrolled at any one site.

A.2 Interim  Analyses  
One planned interim analysis and one final analysis will be conducted. The objective of the 
interim analysis is to assess assumptions for both the primary effectiveness and primary 
safety endpoints so that sample size can be increased accordingly  if necessary. The interim 
analysis will be conducted when 150 patients have completed the 6-month  follow up 
procedures, or have experienced treatment failure, or have terminated the study prematurely. 
This is expected to occur at  approximately the end of the enrollment peri od so that additional 
patients can be enrolled should that be recommended based on results from the interim 
analysis.  Patients who have not completed the 3-month  blanking period will not be included 
in the interim analysis. Overall type  I error will be preserved by down weighting data 
obtained after sample size adjustment, a method first proposed by Cui et al.25  
Based on the estimated treatment success rate and the observed incidence of primary device 
or procedure -related SAEs from each treatment group, conditional power of rejecting the null 
hypothesis at the final analysis will be calculated. Estimated treatment success rate for the 
conditional power calculation will be based on subjects in the Per Protocol population which 
have complet ed the 9 month effectiveness assessment follow -up period post -blanking or are 
determined to be treatment failures.   
The primary safety endpoint will be estimated using the percentage of subjects with device -
related early -onset primary SAEs (PSAEs) as defi ned for the primary endpoint at the time of 
the interim analysis.   
Based on the estimated treatment success rate and the observed incidence of primary device 
or procedure -related SAEs from each treatment group, conditional power of rejecting the null 
hypot hesis at the final analysis will be calculated. The smallest sample size that ensures 
sufficient conditional power as discussed below for both the primary effectiveness and the 
primary safety endpoints will be recommended.  
The following decision rules will  be used by the unblinded statistician to make 
recommendations to the DSMB and sponsor for sample size considerations.  
1. If the conditional power based on observed data is > 80%, continue the study as 
planned.  
2. If the conditional power is < 80%, compute the s ample size necessary to increase 
conditional power to ≥ 80%.  
3. If conditional power is < 80% with the maximum sample size (440 subjects), a 
decision will be made jointly by the DSMB and sponsor based on aggregated 
information. Decisions may include the follo wing:  
a) Continue study to enroll the maximum number of subjects (440).  
b) Continue study as planned to enroll a total of 300 subjects (no change).  
c) Discontinue the study.  
  Sample size should ensure sufficient conditional power of both the primary effectiveness 
and the primary safety endpoints. Therefore, the maximum of the two should be

DO N OT COPY – PROPERTY OF ENDOSENSE  
recommended. The down weighted method by C ui et al25 to preserve type  I error will be 
applied independently to the primary effectiveness and primary safety endpoints.  
A.3 Randomization and Blinding  
Patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive treatment with either the TactiCath Set or 
the control device (NaviStar® ThermoCool® Catheter ma nufactured by Biosense Webster, 
Inc.) Roll-in patients will not be randomized. Use of 3D mapping equipment will be required 
in both treatment groups. The randomization schedule will be computer generated using a 
permuted block algorithm and will randomly a llocate the randomization numbers. The 
randomization numbers will be assigned sequentially through an Interactive Web Response 
System as patients are entered into the study. The randomization schedule will be stratified 
by site. Each site is expected to ha ve approximately 10 to 20  patients.  
All patients will be blinded to treatment assignment. Study personnel, wh o may be 
unblinded, should not disclose any treatment assignment information to the patient prior to 
unblinding  of the study data to all study -related personnel.  
A.4 Patient Characteristics  
In general, patient demographics and baseline characteristic variables will be summarized 
descriptively by treatment group and overall. Continuous variables will be summarized in 
terms of descriptive statistics i ncluding the mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum, 
maximum, and quartiles. Categorical variables will be summarized in terms of frequencies 
and percentages.  
Demographic variables will include age, gender, race, ethnicity, height, and weight. Baseline 
patient characteristics will include the following:  
 Medical history  
 Baseline physical examination and ECG  
 Baseline thyroid  and renal function  
 Baseline PT/PTT or INR 
 Baseline and concomitant medication  
 Documentation of arrhythmia events and cardiac medicatio n 
Data collected during the procedure, including activated clotting time and ablation procedure 
data will be summarized.  Descriptive statistics for these quantities, including  the mean, SD, 
minimum, maximum, and quartiles, will be provided by treatment gro up. 
The TTE/TEE will be performed at baseline and pre -discharge, and data will be summarized 
in 3 categories: normal, abnormal - not clinically significant, and abnormal - clinically 
significant.  
The remaining patient characteristic variables will be summa rized descriptively by treatment 
group and overall (continuous variables: mean, SD, minimum, maximum, and quartiles; 
categorical variables: frequencies and percentages).

A.5 Analysis  
A.5.1  Analysis Populations  
This study will have the following 4 planne d analysis populations.  
 The full analysis (FA) population will include all randomized patients.  
 The modified intent -to-treat (MITT)  population will include all randomized patients in 
whom a study device was introduced  and PVI was attempted . 
 The safety population  (SAF)  will also include all randomized patients in whom a study 
device was introduced.  
 The per -protocol (PP) population will include all patients in the FA population who do 
not have major protocol deviations that will compromise the effectivene ss or safety 
evaluation of the study device. Lists of major protocol deviations and of patients 
excluded from the PP population will be provided prior to database lock and unblinding.  
A.5.2  Effectiveness  
A.5.2.1   Primary Analysis  
The primary effectivenes s endpoint of the study is a non -inferiority comparison of treatment 
success assessment as defined by both : 
 Acute procedural success  - electrical isolation of a ll 4 PVs, or in the  event of a common PV, 
the clinical equivalent of all PVs,  by the end of inde x procedure  (with the device specified by  
the randomization arm ) 
 Chronic success  – acute procedural success and freedom from recurrence of symptomatic 
AF, AFL, and AT lasting longer than 30  seconds through 9 months of follow -up after a 3 
month blanking per iod. Re-treatment for AF with ablation or the use of Class  I or Class  III 
antiarrhythmic drugs after the blanking period  constitute a treatment failure.   
The o ne-sided 95% lower confidence limit will be calculated using the normal approximation 
method for the difference between the 2 treatment groups ( Pt - Pc) based on the PP 
population. If the 95% lower confidence limit is >  -15%, non -inferiority is demonstrated in 
terms of effectiveness. Median time to treatment failures and probability of treatment failu res 
at 12  months will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method, and two -sided 95% 
confidence intervals will be provided. Sensitivity analysis will be provided for  the FA and 
MITT  population s. 
If chronic success is determined to be less than 40% for either the treatment group or the 
control group, additional exploratory analyses on effectiveness outcomes will be performed. 
The analyses will focus on explaining the suboptimal results  or poor devi ce performance . 
Effectiveness outcomes (including acute procedural success, chronic success at 12 month, 
free of symptomatic AF after 12 months, free from AF/AFL/AT at 12 month by Holter) will 
be examined by baseline characteristics and by study sites.  Ba seline characteristics will 
include age group, relevant medical condition at time of procedure, disease history, 
hypertension and heart failure. Site variation may include experience of operator, experience 
 VP-002 527  Page 66 of 92 
 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Version H  
DO N OT COPY – PROPERTY OF ENDOSENSE  
of site, number of operators, percentage of patie nts who received re -ablation during the 
study, and ablative technique.  
A.5.2.2  Secondary Analyse s 
The following secondary effectiveness endpoints are related to the use of the contact force 
sensor and a formal superiority test will be performed comparing the TactiCath Set to the 
control device using a hierarchically closed test procedure. It is hypothesized that the use of 
the contact force sensor information will result in added procedural effectiveness through a 
reduction of number of electrically reconn ected pulmonary veins, time to achieve total PV 
isolation, or total time of RF application. These endpoints will be tested sequentially , 
conditional on the success of reaching the non -inferiority primary effectiveness objective  in 
the order they appear bel ow, using a one sided, α = 0.025 test based on the PP population. 
Subsequent endpoints will be tested only if the prior endpoint(s) are superior.  
1. Number of electric ally reconnected pulmonary veins foll owing a 30 -minute waiting 
period assessed by entrance b lock 
2. Time to achieve total PV isolation measured from initial application of RF energy to all 
targeted vessels isolated  
3. Total time of RF application required for full PV isolation calculated from data paired 
within investigative site and weighted based on the number of enrollments per site.  
Secondary endpoint one will be tested using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Secondary 
endpoints 2 and 3 will be tested using the log rank test. Patients without full PV isolation will 
be censored. Sensitivity analysis may be provided for  the FA and MITT  population s. 
A.5.2.3  Descriptive Analyse s 
The o ther effectiveness endpoints, listed in Section  6.3.1 , will be collected and will be 
summarized descriptively based on the PP population. Continuous variables will be 
summarized in terms of descriptive statistics including the mean, SD, minimum, maximum, 
and quartiles. Categorical variables will be summarized in terms of frequencies and 
percentages.  
A.5.3  Safety  
The primary safety  endpoint is a non -inferiority c omparison of device -related early -onset 
primary SAEs between the TactiCath  Set and the control device occurring within 7 days of 
the index procedure or hospital discharge, whichever is later, and diagnosed at any time 
during the follow -up period. A complete list of primary SAEs is provided in  Table 2.  
Hospitalizations solely due to recurrence of AF/AFL/AT ( i.e., without coexisting conditions 
such as thrombo -embolism, worsening of congestive heart failure, etc.) do not count towards 
primary s afety. PSAEs that meet the severity criteria described in  Table 2 will contr ibute to  
the primary safety endpoint only in patients in whom a  study device (TactiCath  or control) 
has been introduced.   
 VP-002 527  Page 67 of 92 
 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Version H  
DO N OT COPY – PROPERTY OF ENDOSENSE  
The one -sided 95% upper confidence limit will be calculated using the normal approximation 
method for the difference between the two treatment groups ( Pt - Pc) based on the SAF 
population. If the 95% upper confidence limit is <  9%, non -inferiority is demonstrated in 
terms of safety.  Sensitivity analysis will be provided for the FA and PP populations.  
The secondary safety endpoint includes the incidence of all SAEs during the 12 -month 
follow -up period . The secondary safety endpoint will be summarized descriptively based on 
the safety population and all enrolled patients , including the roll -in patients . 
Other safety data, e.g., 12-lead ECG, physical examination, vital signs, NYHA f unctional 
class, will be collected throughout the study, and will be summarized descriptively based on 
the SAF population.  
A.6 Subgroup Analyses  
In addition to the analyses described in Section A.5, the primary and secondary effectiveness 
and safety endpoi nts will also be compared between the control group and a subgroup of 
patients from the TactiCath arm whose average contact force during ablation is ≥ 20 g.  To 
examine comparability, baseline tables will be displayed showing the contact force 
subgroups ( ≥ 20 g vs. < 20 g) as well as the overall treatment group.   
The primary effectiveness endpoint and the primary safety endpoint in these subgroups will 
be examined using exploratory statistical analyses and summarized with descriptive 
statistical measures.  Secondary effectiveness and safety endpoints will be analyzed using the 
same method s as described in Section A.5.2.2 and Section A.5.3  and also summarized with 
descriptive statistical measures . No p -values associated with statistical tests or conclusions 
regarding statistical significance of findings will be reported.  
An analysis of primary and secondary endpoints will also be performed by gender subgroups 
(gender analysis).  
 
A.7 Poolability of Data  
The primary justification for poolability across centers is  made on the basis that there is a 
uniform study protocol with well -defined inclusion/exclusion criteria and that centers will be 
uniformly monitored to verify protocol compliance. Centers located outside the United States 
have been assessed for participat ion using the same selection criteria as in the United States 
and will utilize the identical protocol and procedures in their conduct of the study.  
Poolability will be evaluated and justification for pooling data will be provided before 
combining data. Stu dy variables that are potentially related to study endpoints will be 
identified prior to database freeze for the interim analysis, and statistical analysis will 
examine the homogeneity of demographic and procedural covariates across centers and 
geographica l regions.   Center effect and interaction between treatment and center will be 
considered in the subgroup analyses and secondary analyses on the primary endpoints to 
 VP-002 527  Page 68 of 92 
 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Version H  
DO N OT COPY – PROPERTY OF ENDOSENSE  
examine possible site to site variations using multivariate analysis methods.   A p-value o f ≤ 
0.15 will be considered having significant treatment -by-center interaction. The primary 
effectiveness and safety endpoints will be summarized by center.   In these analyses, small 
centers may be combined based on size, center characteristics and geograp hical 
regions.   Sensitivity analysis will be performed to verify robustness of the statistical model 
by different center pooling algorithms.  
A.8 Missing Data  
For the primary effectiveness analysis, patients who terminated the study prematurely before 
experiencing a treatment failure will not be considered a treatment success at 12  months. 
Patients whose participation in the study is terminated due to reasons cl early unrelated to the 
study device (lost to follow -up due to patient relocation, death due to causes unrelated to the 
study devices, etc.) may also be excluded from the denominator, and thus will not be 
considered treatment failures.  An expert medical pan el while blinded to the individual 
patient’s treatment arm will adjudicate exclusion of patients from the primary effectiveness 
analysis. The decision will be made prior to obtaining the database snapshot for the interim 
analysis, and prior to database loc k for the final analysis.  
Sensitivity analysis will be provided as described below:  
1. All early terminations, regardless of reason for termination will be considered treatment 
failures . 
2. All early terminations, regardless of reasons for termination will be excluded from the 
denominator.  The analysis will be carried out in patients who have either completed the 
12-month follow -up period or have experienced chronic failures . 
3. Worst -case analysis  will be used  to impute failures for missing observations from the  
TactiCath  group and to impute successes for missing observations from the control 
group . 
4. Propensity  score s will be used  to assess the comparability of the two study groups after 
exclusion of protocol deviations  in the PP population.  
5. Tipping point analysis  will be used to replace missing data with values so that the p -value 
is equal to significance level.  
For time to treatment failure and probability of treatment failure at 12  months by the 
Kaplan -Meier method, patients who terminated early prior to failure  will be censored at time 
of discontinuation  and will include all patients . The same rule will apply to the primary 
safety analysis. Patients who terminated the study prematurely without  experiencing any 
primary SAEs will not be considered as having any pr imary SAEs during the course of the 
study. Other missing data will not be imputed.  
Compliance with TTM requirements will be characterized in terms of actual vs. expected 
number of recordings per patient, and overall compliance for each arm of the study. Pa tients 
with major protocol violations (which may include non -compliance with TTMs) will be 
excluded from the PP population.

1-617-632-1515  
The HCRI has established a standing Clinical Events Committee  (CEC)  under the guidance 
of the Executive Director of Clinical Investigations, Donald Cutlip, MD. The CEC will be 
responsible for adjudicating all serious adverse events  reported during the  study, as identified 
and submitted by Endosense, or its designee.  
This committee is comprised of 3  to 5 physicians with experience in clinical trial event 
adjudication, including at least one physician with expertise in each area of the study, who 
are not  participants in the study and who meet regularly throughout the study to adjudicate 
events in an ongoing fashion. The CEC members are chosen based on their clinical expertise 
and have no association with any trial for which they adjudicate events. The CEC  is blinded 
to treatment assignment during all deliberations. Three voting members comprise a quorum.  
The CEC drafts and agrees upon its working charter for each study prior to performing any 
work. This includes explicit rules outlining the minimum amount of data required, and the 
algorithm followed in order to classify a clinical event. The CEC Administrator will prepare 
the CEC Manual of Operations (MOP) based on this information and the CEC MOP will 
serve as the guideline for adjudication for the specifi c trial under review.  
Clinical events related to the primary endpoints are identified by the sponsor and submitted 
to HCRI for review. After review of the identified events by HCRI, support documentation 
for identified events is obtained from the site, if necessary, and a summary is written to 
describe the significant details of the event. These summaries, with appropriate support 
documentation, are presented to the physician members of the CEC. The results of the 
adjudications are entered into the Complica tions database after the CEC meeting. The 
Complications database is specifically created within the overall study database and is used 
in the preparation of DSMB reports, as well as in all analyses of endpoint results.  
CEC meetings are held approximately 3  times per month at HCRI’s offices in Boston, MA. 
As documentation of the CEC meeting and each event under review, HCRI provides to 
Endosense relevant supporting documentation and/or meeting minutes. The format of the 
information will vary depending on whe ther or not HCRI is involved with event narration.

APPENDIX H ................................ ................................ ................. Quality of Life Survey  
The Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of Life survey, also known as the AFEQT28 
questionnaire, is a responsive measure of quality of life specifically for atrial fibrillation. It is 
a reliable, validated questionnaire that evaluates Health Related Qualify of Life (HRQoL) 
across three domains:  symptoms, daily activities, and treatmen t concerns. It is composed of 
20 questions scored on a seven point Likert scale that takes approximately five minutes for 
the subject to complete. The questionnaire is scored for the following results: global AFEQT 
score and subscale functional scores (tre atment concerns, daily activities and symptoms.)     
Higher overall AFEQT scores indicate the subject has no limitations while a lower score 
indicates increased to extreme difficulty affect on quality of life due to atrial fibrillation. The 
Treatment Satisf action Score indicates how well the subject feels their current treatment 
regimen is working, the higher the score, the more satisfied with the treatment. AFEQT will 
be administered to subjects at the baseline visit and at the 12-month  post-procedure visit .

APPENDIX J  ................................ ................................ ....... Supplemental Clinical  Study  
 
J.1 INTRODUCTION  
The TactiCath Set composed of the TactiCath catheter and the TactiSys contact force 
visualization equipment (described in IDE G100230 submitted to FDA on August 13, 2010 
and fully approved on May 17, 2011) is currently being evalua ted in the TOCCASTAR 
clinical study. Completion of patient enrollment occurred in June 2012. A total of 317 
subjects (300 randomized and 17 roll -in) have been enrolled at 17 sites. The PMA is 
expected to be ready for submission to FDA in Q3 of 2013.  
In parallel to the IDE evaluation in the United States, the TactiCath Set has been approved 
for commercial use in Europe and in Australia. To date, no device -related complications 
were reported under the applicable post -market vigilance reporting regulator y systems.  
The company has develop ed a new catheter version along with  new contact force 
visualization equipment called the TactiCath Quartz Set, based closely on the TactiCath Set 
devices. The indications for use remain unchanged,  as does t he cathete r bas ic design.  
Improvements are made to materials and components. This evolution will improve 
manufacturability and increase reliability for the TactiCath catheter. Changes in TactiSys 
will improve usability  and integration with the EP lab environment . The com pany introduced 
the TactiCath Quartz Set in the European market in June 2012.  
To compile evidence of the comparative safety of the TactiCath Quartz Set and to clinically 
evaluate proposed enhancements to the user interface, Endosense proposes to conduct  a 
Supplemental C linical Study  with the TactiCath Quartz Set in the US. Clinical data regarding 
acute safety and effectiveness of the TactiCath Quartz Set in patients with PAF will be 
compared to that of the TactiCath Set from the pivotal TOCCASTAR Study to c onfirm 
comparable clinical performance of the two systems.  
 
J.2 INTENDED USE AND DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
 
J.2.1  Intended Use of the TactiCath Quartz Set  
The intended use of the TactiCath Quartz Set is the same as the TactiCath Set as described in 
Section 4.1.  
 
J.2.2  Device Description – TactiCath Quartz Set  
The TactiCath Quartz Set developed by Endosense consists of the:  
• TactiCath Quartz open irrigated radiofrequency (RF) ablation catheter  
• TactiSys Quartz Equipment, the contact force visualization system.  
The TactiCath Quartz Catheter is connected to the TactiSys Quartz  Equipment . The TactiSys 
Quartz is connected to a general -purpose computer (PC) on which Endosense TactiSoft

software will be installed. The TactiSys Quartz Equipment  refers to t he combination o f the 
TactiSys Quartz and TactiSoft . Each of the TactiCath Quartz and TactiSys Quartz Equipment 
has been subjected to full verification and validation.   
 
J.2.3  Functionality of the TactiCath Quartz Set  
The functionality of the TactiCath Quartz Set is ident ical to the TactiCath Set as described in 
Section 4.2.1.  
 
J.2.4 Evolution from TactiCath Catheter to TactiCath Quartz Catheter  
The basic design from the TactiCath  catheter  (currently under IDE evaluation ) remains 
essentially unchanged. H owever, a modificat ion of the force sensor has been implemented 
for enhanced stability, reliability and manufacturability.  
The basic design of the TactiCath Quartz body (shaft concept, handle, proximal cable, 
electrical and optical connectors) is equivalent to the current ge neration TactiCath. Minimal 
changes have been made with respect to functionality and materials that are in direct contact 
with the patient . The manner in which the catheter is used by  physicians has not change d.  
The change to the force sensor technology is the main design difference  between the 
TactiCath and the TactiCath Quartz. Modifications to the force sensor include:  
• Fabry -Pérot technology replaces Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) technology  
• Material of force senso r support (deformable body) changed from plastic (Liquid 
Crystal Polymer)  to metallic (titani um) 
• Force sensor  is reduced in length from 4 mm to 1.5 mm and positioned closer to 
electrode 1 (ti p) 
The new force sensor allows precise real -time measurement of the force applied by the distal 
tip of the catheter to the heart wall with a resolution and sensitivity of about 1 gram. The 
principle of operation still  consists of measuring the deformation of a deformable body in 
response to  the force. This deformation is now measured by displacement sensors (Fabry -
Pérot technology) instead of FBG strain sensors. Th ree displacement sensors are mounted 
circumferentially to the deformable body.  These changes to the force sensor technology have 
no impact on the cli nical per formance of the device other than to improve reliability and the 
resolution of CF data.  
 
J.2.5 Evolution from TactiSys to TactiSys Quartz Equipment  
The TactiSys Quartz Equipment is indicated for use in conjunction with an Endosense 
TactiCath Quartz Contact  Force Ablation Catheter. The TactiSys Quartz Equipment allows 
the visualization of the CF information coming from the catheter tip.  
The contact force visualization equipment has been redesigned to be compatible with the 
new choice of Fabry -Pérot force sen sing technology incorporated in the TactiCath Quartz

DO N OT COPY – PROPERTY OF ENDOSENSE  
Catheter . The two hardware components, the Base Station and Splitter of the current  
generation equipment TactiSys, have been replaced by only one hardware component in the 
TactiSys Quartz.  
The TactiSys Q uartz Equipment is composed of the TactiSys Quartz device and TactiSoft 
software.  The TactiSoft  software , which had been  incorporated in the Base Station, now 
becomes stand -alone software  running on a PC .  
TactiSys Quartz  
The TactiSys Quartz includes  the main signal processing unit  and the optical measurement 
system. TactiSys Quartz acts as a server, which can send the contact force information to 
clients, either a PC running Endosense’s TactiSoft software, or another  device, or both at the 
same time.  
The TactiSys Quartz has a dedicated power supply. As the principal signal processing unit, 
TactiSys Quartz hosts the software (called TactiSys Quartz Software) to collect data from the 
catheter to compute the force and the related information. The TactiSy s Quartz shares this 
information with the clients via a TCP -IP protocol through an  Ethernet connection.  
In addition to sharing force information with other  devices , the new configuration offers the 
advantage of measuring  the contact force closer to the pat ient, therefore obviating the optical 
and electrical connections currently used in TactiSys between Base Station and Splitter.  The 
optical measurement system allows a higher sampling rate (50Hz) resulting in improved 
resolution of force signals and a bette r algorithm to compensate for drift. Another advantage 
of this technology is that the in -situ calibration procedure of the catheter is no longer needed.  
The diagram below shows the TactiSys Quartz Equipment architecture, with the software 
items and interfa ces between them. It also includes the TactiSoft software running on a PC, 
and the device communicating with the TactiSys Quartz .

TactiSoft  
TactiSoft v4 is the software designed by Endosense  to display the force information received 
from the TactiSys Quartz. The TactiSoft software will be available on CD for installation on

a general -purpose computer (non -medical grade) that fulfills  specif ic configuration 
requirements. For the Supplemental C linical Study, t he general purpose computer will be 
provided by Endosense and will communicate with the TactiSys Quartz through an Ethernet 
connection.  
TactiSoft v4 will essentially have the same display functionalities as current TactiSoft v3.2, 
with enha nced options  for user customization. Several new diagnostic features have been 
introduced that may be optionally activated as part of the user customization.

J.3 STUDY PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES  
 
J.3.1  Study Purpose  
The purpose of the Supplemental Clinical Study is  to evaluate the acute clinical safety and 
effectiveness of the TactiCath  Quartz Set to verify that the new design performs comparably 
to the initial design.  
The TactiCath Quartz Set includes hardware design modifications intended to improve 
manufacturability and to increase reliability as well as minor enhancements to the user  
interface intended to promote improved usability and safety. These enhancements do not 
introduce any new design features that would be expected to measurably impact clinical 
performance compared with the original design.  
 
J.3.2  Study Objectives  
 
J.3.2.1  Effectiveness  
To provide comparative acute effectiveness data on the treatment of symptomatic PAF 
relative to the TactiCath Set.  
 

 VP-002 527  Page 82 of 92 
 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Version H  
DO N OT COPY – PROPERTY OF ENDOSENSE  
J.3.2.2  Safety  
To provide comparative acute safety data on the incidence of early -onset SAEs relative to the 
TactiCath Set.  
 
J.4 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
Outcomes from the Supplemental Clinical Study will be summarized  descriptively.  
  
J.5 STUDY DESIGN  
 
J.5.1  Justification  for the Investigation  
The main objective of the Supplemental Clinical Study will be to provide confirmatory 
evidence  regarding the acute safety and effectiveness of the TactiCath Quartz Set in patients 
with symptomatic PAF. In principle, the TactiCath Quartz Set will provide the same  
therapeutic and diagnostic functionality to the operator during use as the TactiCath  Set. It is 
anticipated  that the risks  and benefits  will also be the same. The  new device  will be evaluated 
in an identical patient population (inclusion and exclusion criteria), using the same 
procedural methodology from the TOCCASTAR study.  
Prior to firs t clinical use, a comprehensive verification and validation study will confirm the 
operation and robustness of the new features included in the device.  
Given the similarities in patient populations, device functionality, and procedural testing 
requirements , the acute procedural and 30 day safety data from the TactiCath Quartz Set may 
be compared with data from the TactiCath Set. Therefore, a minimum of 30 days of follow -
up data on 50 subjects will be submitted for FDA review  in the original PMA , plus any 
additional follow - up data available at the time of submission. Subjects enrolled in the 
supplemental study will comply with the same extended follow -up requirements from the 
original study (every 6 months until PMA approval) to provide additional safety and  
effectiveness data from the post -assessme nt period through PMA approval.  
 
J.5.2  Scope of Study  
Up to 10 sites participating in the TOCCASTAR Study will be asked to also participate in 
the Supplemental Clinical Study. Investigators will likewise be chosen from the current 
group of TOCCASTAR investigators. Sites will be required to seek approval of the Clinical 
Investigational Plan and Patient Informed  Consent (Version F) as a prerequisite to 
enrollment.  
Up to 50 subjects will be enrolled in a non -randomize d manner and treated identically to the 
roll-in patient population  except as described in Section J.7 .  
 
J.5.3  Study Assessment Intervals

 CONFIDENTIAL  Version H  
DO N OT COPY – PROPERTY OF ENDOSENSE  
For the purpose of assessing acute comparative performance, patients will be followed for a 
minimum of 30 days, after which subjects will continue follow -up according to the Sche dule 
of Activities ( Table 1) with one exception. To comply with current standard of care at the 
participating institutions, CT and MR scans are recommended but not requir ed for the 
supplemental study patients only.  
The supplemental study is intended to provide confirmation that the device and procedure 
related complications  assessed a t 30 days  are comparable to the experience with the 
randomized  TactiCath subjects . The supplemental study also allows for subjects to be 
followed for a total of 12 months  (3 months blanking period followed by 9 month 
effectiveness assessment period) .  
 
J.5.4 Clinical  Investigational  Plan  
We propose to study the primary safety and acute effectiveness of the TactiCath Quartz Set 
in the  Suppleme ntal Clinical Study with the following key features (relative to the current 
randomized  study):  
• Single arm, non -randomized study  
• Identical inclusion and exclusion criteria for subjects  
• Identical procedural testing requirements during the index procedure  
• Identical data collection requirements in the acute study phase  
• Identical follow -up requirements for 12 month (excluding CT/MR scans)  
• 30 day safety outcome assessment on 50 patients (descriptive summary comparing 
randomized  and supplemental s tudy subjects)  
• Extended follow -up every 6 months until time of PMA approval  
• Study restricted to sites who are already  participating in the TOCCASTAR Study  
 
 
J.6 CRITERIA FOR ELIGIBILITY  
Subject eligibility is identical to the initial randomized study as  described in Section 8 
CRITERIA FOR ELIGIBILITY . 
 
 
J.7 STUDY PROCEDURES  
Procedures required in the Supplemental Clinical Study are identical to those specified in 
Section 10 STUDY PROCEDURES  of the randomized  study with the following exceptions:  
1. Subjects enrolled in the Supplemental Clinical Study will not be randomized. All 
subjects will be treated with the TactiCath Quartz Set.

2. CT and/or MR scans are recommended but not required (either pre -procedure or at 3 -
month follow -up). 
 
 
J.8 PATIENT BENEFITS AND RISKS  
Benefits and risks are identical to those described in Section 11 except for those risks that 
have been reduced by the elim ination of the CT a nd MR scans in the study. In addition, the 
TactiCath Set continues to be used safely in a commercial setting outside of the US having 
now exceeded 2500 units worldwide. Data resulting from both company and investigator 
sponsored research  has resulted in over 30 peer reviewed publications and presentations that 
have report ed on potential benefit s associated with contact force sensing with TactiCath . 
 
J.9 ADVERSE EVENTS  
The definitions and reporting requirements related to adverse events, s erious adverse events 
and UAD Es are identical to those described in Section 12.  Only serious adverse events 
related to safety will be referred to the Clinical Events Committee for adjudication for 
subjects enrolled in the Supplemental Clinical Study. I.e.,  arrhythmia recurrence resulting in  
a “treatment failure” will not be adjudicated for an effectiveness endpoint determination.

APPENDIX K  ................................ ................................ .............  Continued Access Study  
 
K.1 INTRODUCTION  
The TactiCath Quartz Set PMA was  submitted to FDA in Q4 of 2013. While the marketing 
application is under  regulatory review, St Jude Medical proposes to conduct a Continued 
Access Study of the TactiCath Quartz Set in the US.   The study will report c linical data 
regarding acute safety and effectiveness of the TactiCath Q uartz Set in patients with PAF . 
 
K.2 DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
The TactiCath Quartz Catheter and TactiSys Quartz Equipment are described in Section J.2 
above. Changes to the TactiSoft Graphical User Interface (GUI) software are described in 
Section K.2.1 below.  
 
K.2.1 TactiSoft  Software  
TactiSoft v4 .3.1.0 will be used in the Continued Access Study. It is essentially the same as 
v4.3.0 .0 that was used in the Supplemental Clinical Study  as shown in  Figure 4. The main 
functionalities are identical, however several minor modifications were made to conform to 
findings from a Usability Study of human factors of the user interface.  
 
Figure 4 Procedure Screen Example TactiSoft v4.3.0 .0 (left) and 4.3.1 .0 (right)  
 
 
Changes implemented in the TactiSoft v4.3.1.0 GUI  include:  
“Please check baseline” message appearance frequency reduced : 
This message appears in response to the det ection of a possible offset in the contact 
force reading. In an engineering study, it was found that the threshold for detection 
could be safely reduced to improve specificity (thereby avoiding false positives)  
without compromising the detection of true positive offsets.  

 VP-002 527  Page 86 of 92 
 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Version H  
DO N OT COPY – PROPERTY OF ENDOSENSE  
  
“Please check baseline” message replaced with “Please reset baseline” upon initial use:  
An initial baseline reset is required upon first use of a TactiCath catheter. The “please 
check baseline ” message that appeared was identical to the message that might  appear 
during later use for different reasons and may have contributed to a user error. The 
new message has been implemented to clarify the initialization requirement that 
should improve user  comprehension and recognition. (See example below.)  
Figure 5 “Please reset baseline” message  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
TactiSoft v4.3.0.0  TactiSoft v4.3.1.0  
 
 
“Please check irrigation” message replaced with “Please check baseline”:  
In the previous TactiCath catheter design, an irrigation failure could cause a force 
drift during ablation  causing t he “Please check irrigation” message to appear in 
response. Owing  to design improvements in the current version of  the catheter , 
irrigation failure during ablation will no longer cause a drift in the contact force. To 
avoid user error and mitigate the risk of delayed therapy caused by a catheter change, 
the irrigation message has been replaced by the more appropriate “Please check 
baseline” me ssage.  
  
“Settings” menu - Improved wording  and button operation:  
The summative u sability test revealed common user errors associated with navigating 
the settings screens due to ambiguous labels and inconsistent up/down button 
behavior. The wording and operation of certain buttons and labels have been 
improved to better correlate with the button  function . (See example below.)

Use of pictograms  in procedure screen:  
This change has been implemented as an additional change beyond the opportunities 
of improvement identified during usability testing. The primary intention of this 
change was to improve readability of the contact force information di splayed and to 
better group numerical and graphical contact force indicators, respectively. The 
addition of pictograms instead of words or letters allows the use of a uniform user 
interface in the multilingual international environment, especially with res pect to 
contact force reading and stability indicator in the TactiSoft procedure screen.  
 
K.3 STUDY PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES

K.10 CLINICAL EVENTS COMMITTEE  
A successor  Clinical Events Committee (CEC) will be created to assume respons ibility  for 
reviewing all Serious Adverse Events  reported in the Continued Access Study . This 
committee is comprised of 3  to 5 physicians with experience in clinical trial event 
adjudication, including at least one physician with expertise in each area of the study, who 
are not participants in the study and who meet regularly throughout the study to adjudicate 
events in an ongoing fashion. The CEC members are chosen based on their clinical expertise 
and have no association with any trial for which they adju dicate events. The CEC is blinded 
to treatment assignment during all deliberations. Three voting members comprise a quorum.  
The CEC drafts and agrees upon its working charter for each study . This includes explicit 
rules outlining the minimum amount of data  required, and the algorithm followed in order to 
classify a clinical event. A CEC Manual of Operations (MOP)  is prepared  based on this 
information and the CEC MOP will serve as the guideline for adjudication for the specific 
trial under review.  
Only serious adverse events related to safety will be referred to the Clinical Events 
Committee (CEC) for adjudication for subjects enrolled in the Continued Access Study, i. e. 
arrhythmia recurrence resulting in  a “treatment failure” will not be adjudicated  for an 
effectiveness endpoint determination.

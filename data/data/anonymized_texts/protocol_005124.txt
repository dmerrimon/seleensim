 2 
Chicago is an epicenter for asthma health disparities in the United States, with African American 3 
children 5 -11 years old bearing a disproportionate share of the burden.  Gaps in implementation at 4 
provider and patient  levels contribute to these asthma dispa rities, with studies suggesting that 5 
minority children are less likely than white children to be prescribed and use guideline - 6 
recommended asthma care, respectively.  Effective strategies to implem ent national asthma 7 
guideline recommendations in this population are needed.  As part of a Patient -Centered Outcomes 8 
Research Institute contract (AS 1307 -05420; Coordinated Healthcare Interventions for Childhood 9 
Asthma Gaps in Outcomes [CHICAGO] Plan), we used methods in user-centered design  to inform 10 
the development of interventions to implement asthma guidelines in the ED and at home.  We then 11 
conduct ed a pragmatic trial to evaluate the effectiveness of ED and home -based  interventions on 12 
patient - and caregiver -centered endpoints.    13

 16 
The CHICAGO Plan was a randomized 3 -arm parallel group, multi -center pragmatic trial in six 17 
Emergency Departments (EDs ) affiliated with public or private hospitals who served a high 18 
proportion of black or Latino children in Chicago to compare: 1) an ED -only intervention 2) an 19 
ED-plus-home intervention; and 3) Enhanced usual care.  Eligibility criteria were intended to be 20 
clinically applicable and recruitment took place in multiple EDs serving underserved communities 21 
in Chicago (six Clinical Centers serving different populations of children 5 -11 years presenting 22 
with asthma).  Data collection employed validated approaches, but were also intended to minimize 23 
participant burden  24 
 25 
III. Primary and secondary aims  26 
 27 
Primary aim  28 
Conduct a 3 -arm multi -center  pragmatic trial comparing the effectiveness of  the ED-only,  ED- 29 
plus-home,  and usual care strategies.   30 
 31 
Secondary aim s 32 
 Examine  the potential for heterogeneity of treatment effects.  33 
 Identify barriers and facilitators of successfully implementing the interventions to inform 34 
subsequent research to accelerate the uptake of study findings .   35

Figure 1:  Children ages  5 to 11 years who presented  with uncontrolled asthma to the emergency 39 
department ( ED) were randomly allocated  to one of three groups:  Enhanced usual care vs. ED - 40 
based intervention using the CHICAGO Action Plan after Emergency department discharge 41 
(CAPE) de cision support and communication tool for children and caregivers (ED -only), vs. the 42 
same ED -only intervention plus community health worker -led home visits at 2-3 days, 2 weeks, 1 43 
month, 3 months, and  6 months after ED discharge to help implement the CAPE and reduce 44 
environmental triggers (ED -plus-home ). Outcomes were assessed  at baseline (in -person prior to  45 
ED discharge), 1 month  (via phone), 3 months  (via phone), and 6 months  (in-home or via phone; 46 
time point for the primary outcome ) after ED discharge .  47

IV. Study population  49 
 50 
Eligibility criteria were designed to be clinically relevant and feasible to implement in an ED 51 
setting.    Due to lower than expected randomizations during the first half of the recruitment period, 52 
we modified the study eligibility criteria after review by an independent Data and Safety and 53 
Monitoring Board , institutional IRBs ( Site-specific IRB approval dates: Lurie – 9/14/2015; Rush – 54 
9/8/2015; Sinai – 9/10/2015; Stroger – 8/18/2015; UC – 9/1/2015; UIC – 7/28/2015 ), and 55 
discussions  with the program officer from the Patient -Centered Outcomes Research Institute .  56 
Original and revised eligibility criteria are below; to be eligible, patients needed to meet all 57 
inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria below.  58

V.  Interventions and comparators  121 
 122 
All children who participated in the CHICAGO Plan received  asthma care per their ED clinicians.  123 
In addition, the CHICAGO Plan’s ED Coordinator provided all participants two metered dose 124 
inhaler (MDI) spacers free -of-charge and used  teach -to-goal methodology  (repeated rounds of 125 
education and evaluation until the child achieves mastery) to educate the ch ild and the caregiver 126 
about appropriate MDI inhaler technique . Patient  education regarding the MDI device was selected 127 
because it is commonly used for quick -relief medications and is also the device for many inhaled 128 
controller medications. Children were th en randomly assigned to either of two active comparators 129 
or enhanced usual care.  130 
 131 
1. ED-only.  Based on feedback from our stakeholders, we developed the CHICAGO Action 132 
Plan after Emergency department discharge tool (CAPE; APPENDIX A1 ); a culturally 133 
tailored and literacy -appropriate communication tool for use on ED discharge .  Based on 134 
the ED treating clinician’s discharge instructions, a  CHICAGO Plan ED Coordinator 135 
utilized the CAPE to support guideline recommended asthma care on ED discharge (a 136 
course of sys temic corticosteroids; daily inhaled corticosteroids or other controller; as 137 
needed quick -relief inhaled medication; education about the medications and appropriate 138 
inhaler technique; education about asthma trigger avoidance; and a post -discharge follow - 139 
up appointment) and to support appropriate asthma self -management in the home. The 140 
CAPE tool uses simplified language, visual learning, and options for individualization to 141 
facilitate communication about discharge instructions between clinicians and the chil d and 142 
caregiver.  143 
 144 
2. ED-plus-home .  Participants randomly allocated to the ED -plus-home intervention received  145 
the same ED-only intervention described above but were also offered up to five home visits 146 
over 6 months  conducted by a CHW visits to: 1) assist in the implementation of the ED 147 
discharge  instructions, 2) update the asthma treatment plan with input from  the patient’s 148 
ambulatory clinician  utilizing the CAPE tool called the Asthma Home Plan ( APPENDIX 149 
A2), 3) develop a plan to manage  asthma during school hours (e.g., access to quick -relief 150 
medications, action plan in case of respiratory difficulty), and 4) develop  a specific and 151 
feasible plan to reduce environmental triggers at home  (e.g., environmental tobacco smoke, 152 
roach, mice) .  Home v isits were scheduled for 60 to 90 minutes, and occurred 153 
PCORI contract # AS 1307 -05420  
 
CHICAGO Plan Protocol  
12-01-2017          Page 8 of 36 approximately at 2 -3 days, 2 weeks (14 days), 1 month (30 days), 3 month (90 days), and 6 154 
months (180 days) after ED discharge .  155 
  156 
3. Enhanced usual care .    Based on stakeholder feedback, we modified usual care so that 157 
children in the “usual care” group also received teaching about appropriate MDI technique 158 
using teach -to-goal methodology  and two MDI spacers free -of-charge,  as well as doorknob 159 
hangers depictin g facts about asthma unrelated to the study interventions . We therefore 160 
refer to this group as “Enhanced usual care.”   To describe usual  care at each site, the site 161 
project manager conducted  chart abstractions (masked to treatment assignment ).  Site 162 
proje ct managers were to complete chart abstractions  within 3 business days of enrolling 163 
the participant in the study.   164

 167 
Randomization occurred  at the patient  level , with permuted block sizes stratified by site  and race 168 
(black vs. non -black). Based on data from the Clinical Centers, we expect ed about 70 % of enrolled 169 
participants to be black, 23 % to be white, and that the remainder would be mostly Asian.  Of the 170 
planned enrollment of 640 children, we expected 15% to be Hispanic/Latino .  Stratification  by race 171 
for the purposes of randomization was “Black” (those who selected Black  or African American, 172 
includes multi -race if at least one race was Black or African American) vs. “non -Black” (American 173 
Indian/Alaskan Native, A sian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, white, and multi -race if 174 
none are Black or  African American ).   175 
 176 
The CHICAGO Plan Research Electronic Data  Capture (REDCap) system  for study personnel 177 
(available 24 hours x 7 days/week ) provide d the random treatment assignment:  ED-only, ED-plus- 178 
home , or Enhanced usual care.   179 
 180 
VII. Data collection  181 
 182 
A. Screening and enrollment (registration) into the study  (in person ; ~40 minutes ). The ED 183 
coordinator , a member of the research team,  at each Clinical Center screen ed patients in the ED , 184 
Urgent Care, or Observation Unit after treatment initiation for asthma exacerbation and before 185 
discharge.  The ED coordinator obtain ed verbal assent from the ED clinician  prior to approaching 186 
the child/caregiver for informed consent.  Following informed consent, the ED coordinator 187 
obtain ed Baseline data , register ed the patient in a customized, secure, on -line CHICAGO Plan 188 
REDCap portal developed by the DCC , then obtain ed th e treatment assignment ( ED-only, ED- 189 
plus-home , or Enhanced u sual care).  The ED Coordinator offered to  arrange  the date/time of the 190 
1-month follow -up visit  (see below).  191 
 192 
B. 1-month follow -up contact after discharge  (telephone ; ~15 minutes ).  Post-baseline data 193 
collection was performed by the DCC Research Assistant, who was masked to treatment 194 
assignment . The Research Assistant  conduct ed a telephone interview to assess outcomes 195 
approximately 1 month  after discharge .  The interview was also desi gned to collect / update 196 
contact information and to promote retention in the CHICAGO Plan. The DCC Research Assistant 197 
arranged  date/time of the 3 -month follow -up visit (see below) , or inquire d about the best time  to 198 
call agai n. 199 
 200 
C. 3-month follow -up contact after ED discharge  (telephone ; ~15 minutes ).  The DCC Research 201 
Assistant, masked to treatment assignment , conduct ed a telephone interview to assess outcomes 202 
approximately 3 months after ED discharge .  The interview was also designed to collect / update 203 
contact information and to promote retention in the CHICAGO Plan. The DCC Research Assistant 204 
arrange d date/time of the 6 -month follow -up visit (see below) , or inquire d about the best time  to 205 
call again .  206 
 207 
D. 6-month follow -up contact after discharge  (in person  or by telephone ; ~40 minutes ).  The DCC 208 
Research Assistant, masked to treatment assignment , conduct ed a study visit in person or via 209 
telephone (per participant preference) to assess outcomes approximately 6 months after discharge .  210 
The in -person visit afforded  the ability to conduct an assessment of home trigger avoidance; 211

during in -person visits.  213 
 214 
E. 12 -month follow -up con tact after discharge ( in person or by telephone; ~ 40 minutes).  We 215 
proposed re -assessing  outcomes at 12 months to examine  the durability of effects observed at 6  216 
months .   Despite significant efforts, retention in the study also proved to be challenging, and 217 
therefore the 12-month follow -up visit was discontinued at the request of PCORI in September 218 
2016 .  219 
 220 
VIII. Outcomes  221 
 222 
The selection of primary outcomes was based on several criteria: 1)  patient -centeredness, defined 223 
as domains identif ied as  important by  children and their  caregiver s; as described in our previous 224 
publications;  2) availability of validated measures in English and in Spanish that could be 225 
administered in person and by phone; 3) plausibility that such measures could be responsi ve to an 226 
effective int ervention in the target population; and 4 ) limited burden (e.g., time) for study 227 
participants.   On this basis, we selected two NIH Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement 228 
Information System (PROMIS) measures  as primary outcomes (1 for the child and 1 for the 229 
caregiver).   Several measures were selected for secondary outcomes  to address recommendations  of 230 
national asthma guidelines, expressed preferences of caregivers and other stakeholders, and to 231 
compare results of the CHICAGO Plan with  previous studies.    232 
 233 
A.  Primary  outcomes  234 
1. The change in asthma impact  at 6 months compared to the baseline assessed in the ED served as 235 
the primary outcome in children . In children 5 to 7 years, we assessed asthma impact using the 236 
PROMIS Parent Proxy Short Form v1.0 – Asthma Impact 8a.  In children 8 to 11 years , we used 237 
the PROMIS Pediatric Short Form v1.0 – Asthma Impact 8a.  238 
 239 
2. The change in Satisfaction with Participation in Social Roles  at 6 months compared to the 240 
baseline assessed in the ED served as the primary outcome in the caregiver .  We used the PROMIS 241 
Short Form v1.0 – Satisfaction with Participation in Social Roles 4a.  242 
 243 
B.  Secondary outcomes  244 
For children :   245 
1) The Childhood Asthma Control Test (cACT ) at 6 months compared to the baseline assessed 246 
in the ED  247 
2) Acute care visits at 6 months (number of all -cause urgent care  visits, ED visits, 248 
hospitalizations, using electronic health records )   249 
 250 
For caregivers :  251 
1) Pediatric Asthma Caregiver ’s Quality of Life Questionnaire (PACQLQ ) at 6 months 252 
compared to the baseline assessed in the ED  253 
2) NIH PROMIS measures for anxiety, depression , fatigue , sleep disturbance at 6 months 254 
compared to the baseline assessed in the ED  255

ED discharge (yes/no)  266 
3)   Attend ance at outpatient appointment with  patient -identified asthma provider within 4 267 
weeks of ED discharge (yes/no)  268 
 269 
IX. Analysis plan  270 
 271 
All primary and secondary outcomes were analyzed according to the intention -to-treat principle. 272 
All randomized subjects were included in the primary analysis, unless subject s were terminated 273 
due to ineligibility.  Baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics in the intervention and 274 
control groups were compared using the frequency and percentages for categorical variables and 275 
median with inter -quartile or mean with s tandard error for continuous variables.  For bivariate 276 
analyses, the pairwise comparisons between three intervention arms for the change in primary and 277 
some secondary outcomes from baseline to 3 or 6 months were tested by Wilcoxon rank sum test.  278 
The W sta tistic, p -value and mean rank were reported together with horizontal mirror bar plots. For 279 
primary outcomes, a statistical significance occurred when p -value was less than 0.0167 after 280 
Bonferroni correction for three pairwise comparisons (0.05/3). In addit ion, chi -square tests were 281 
also conducted for other secondary outcomes.  282 
 283 
To address missing data in the analyses, we checked the missing completely at random (MCAR) 284 
assumption and then employed a multiple imputation strategy. Using a logistic regression method 285 
described in Hedeker & Gibbons (2006), we found that the current outcome missingness was not 286 
statistically associated with previous observed outcomes across time. Additional characteristics 287 
comparisons between participants with and without missing p rimary outcomes across time was 288 
also done using Chi -square tests for categorical variables and Mann -Whitney U test for continuous 289 
variables. No statistical difference was observed between the two groups (i.e. with and without 290 
missing  primary outcomes). We therefore used a fully conditional specification (FCS) approach to 291 
impute the missing values with variables of interest in the primary analysis models for 30 292 
imputations.  The raw and imputed data had similar distributions (mean, standard deviation, 293 
minimu m and maximum values).  294 
 295 
Since the two primary outcomes were not normally distributed and our data satisfied the MCAR 296 
assumption, we used generalized estimating equations (GEE) to examine the effect of intervention 297 
group on outcomes at 3 and at 6 months com pared to that of the enhanced usual care group using 298 
ordinal logistic regression models; the continuous dependent variables were categorized into 299 
quartiles. The main predictors of the unadjusted GEE models were time (0, 1, 3, and 6 months), 300 
intervention gr oup, and their interactions. In an adjusted model, we added pre -specified covariates 301 
including, race (Black vs. non -Black), ethnicity ( Latino  vs. non -Latino ), gender (boy vs. girl), 302 
PCORI contract # AS 1307 -05420  
 
CHICAGO Plan Protocol  
12-01-2017          Page 12 of 36 health insurance (Public aid vs. Other), site enrolled (sites 1 to 6), number of all -cause acute care 303 
use in the 12 months prior to enrollment (at least one vs. none). To access the intervention effect 304 
between groups across time, we reported our results as odds ratios (ORs for higher quartiles) of 305 
interactions between study g roup and time and their 98% confident intervals [CIs; corresponding 306 
to a 2 -sided alpha=0.0167) to account for Bonferroni adjustments for the three pairwise 307 
comparisons.  308 
 309 
In secondary analyses, we explored heterogeneity of treatment effects by adding a thr ee-way 310 
interaction between intervention, time, and a subgroup factor in the model described previously. 311 
Pre-specified subgroup factors included race (Black vs. non -black), ethnicity ( Latino  vs. non - 312 
Latino ), gender (boy vs. girl), and number of all -cause ac ute care use in the 12 months prior to 313 
enrollment (at least one vs. none).  314 
 315 
Power / sample size  calculation. The power analyses did not incorporate adjustment for the 316 
presence of two primary outcomes.  Such an adjustment is not commonly made in biomedical 317 
trials, as multivariate (viz. MANOVA) analyses are not commonly conducted. The power analysis 318 
for single outcomes employed the Rochon (1991) method based on Hotelling's T -squared, which 319 
was adapted to a 3 -group comparison by adjusting the alpha level using a Bonferroni -style 320 
technique.  This approach tends toward a conservative (larger) sample size.   We proposed to 321 
enroll and randomize 640 participants over 18 months (~200 -215 for each of the 3 treatment 322 
groups).   Assuming evaluable data in 80% of enrolled  participants (n=512) at 6 months (the time - 323 
point for the analyses of the primary outcomes), sample size calculations suggest ample power.  324 
Our approach was based on the methods of Rochon, with a Bonferroni adjustment for 3 pair -wise 325 
comparisons (2 -sided α  =0.05/3 =0.0167; enhanced usual care and two active intervention groups), 326 
power 80%, 4 measurements per individual (0, 1, 3, and 6 months), within individual correlation 327 
0.80, correction for within ED clustering (design effect of 2), and a coefficient of determination 328 
(R2) for control of individual -level demographics = 0.15.  Based on these considerations, a sample 329 
size of 426 (well within the expected sample size of 512) was estimated to be sufficient for a 330 
minimum detectable difference of 0.35 standard d eviations (SDs) (midway between Cohen’s 331 
“small” (0.2 SDs) and “medium” (0.5 SDs) effect sizes) for each of the two primary continuous 332 
outcomes compared pairwise across the three treatment groups. The minimum detectable 333 
difference of 0.35 SDs corresponds to  sufficient power to detect a T -score difference of 3.5, which 334 
is approximately mid -way between estimates of the minimum important difference (MID) for 335 
PROMIS T -scores (2 to 5).  336

 340 
Health system interventions are often multi -component, and when they successfully improve care or 341 
outcomes, it is helpful to know whether all components of the intervention we re necessary for 342 
success.  Also, when care outcomes are not improved, it is unclear if barriers to implementation 343 
(fidelity) or lack of efficacy  contributed to a lack of effect.  We therefore  a mixed  -methods 344 
approach to   1) assess  the fidelity  of implementing the ED-only and ED -plus-home interventions; 345 
and 2) conduct interviews to debrief with study staff and a convenience sample of caregivers.    346 
 347 
(1) Intervention fidelity: We assessed our key perfor mance indicators (see APPENDIX B) as 348 
complet ed or not completed  to measure the extent to which each patient received each component 349 
of the CHICAGO Plan intervention , based on their allocation to the three treatment groups .   350 
 351 
(2) Focus groups:  We complete d debrief interviews with caregivers  to better understand  if they 352 
were satisfied with the content, comprehension, and relevance of the intervention material.  We 353 
also asked  about the satisfaction with the interventions provided by the ED coordinator and CHWs, 354 
and any other comments the patient o r caregiver would like to offer about how to improve the 355 
CHICAGO Plan. We inform ed the participants that their responses would  be used to help 356 
determine how to improve studies in the future  (UIC IRB # 2017 -0888) . 357 
 358 
(3) Interview s of ED Coordinator s, DCC Research Assistants,  and CHWs :  We asked  study staff 359 
provide feedback about  barriers and facilitators to completing study  procedures  (e.g., space or time 360 
constraints when providing ED -based instruction; availability of participants at scheduled home 361 
visit times).  We informed study staff that their responses would be used to help determine how  to 362 
improve studies in the future (UIC IRB # 2017 -0888).  363

 378 
A. Risks to human subjects  379 
 380 
Human subjects involvement and characteristics  381 
The trial aimed to  include approximately 640 children ages 5 -11 years  and their caregivers.  The 382 
eligibility criteria are discussed in an earli er section of this protocol.  Children and caregivers were  383 
randomly allocated to 1) ED-only; 2) ED-plus-home ; or 3) Enhanced usual care .  All participants 384 
were asked to complete  study procedures  for at least 6  months , regardless  of the group they are 385 
assigned to; a study coordinator (masked to the treatment assignment) conduct ed assessment visits 386 
at baseline , 1, 3, and 6 months post index ED visit.   387 
 388 
B. Sources of materials  389 
 390 
Sources of materials included: Questionnaires administered by the ED coordinator (baseline data), 391 
and those administered by the  DCC  research assistant (follow -up data); Pharmacy dispensation 392 
data and electronic health records (EHR) ; Direct observation (e.g ., home inspection / completion 393 
of environmental assessment checklist; review of inhaler technique using checklist) . 394 
 395 
C. Potential risk 396 
 397 
Participants and caregivers were  subject only to minimal risks through this research ; we were  398 
testing two different approaches to promoting guideline recommended care ( ED-only;  ED-plus- 399 
home ) compared to usual Enhanced usual  care.  Potential  risks include d inconvenience or 400 
embarrassment involved in completing questionnaires or demonstrating self -management skills, or 401 
permitting the CHW (or research assistant) to conduct home visits for interventions (or for 402 
assessments), or in allowing the DCC to obtain pharmacy dispensation records (used for measuring 403 
adherence).  The caregiver was not required to answer any questions (or conduct any part of the 404 
study) that he/she  was reluctant to discuss/conduct. There  was also a risk of loss of confidentiality.  405 
The CHW was instructed to avoid providing  patients/caregivers with any type of medical advice, 406 
but had direct access to health care providers to address any patient/caregiver clinical questions or 407 
concerns. If the CHW was contacted about  clinical questions, the CHW  was instructed to  connect 408 
the participant/caregiver with a health care provider familiar with  the participant’s medical 409 
condition immediately. On enrollment, caregivers were  instructed to call their health care provider 410 
or seek emergency services in case of worsening symptoms, as opposed to directing questions to 411 
the CHW. All participants were informed  in advance that they may withdraw from the study at any 412 
time without negatively affecting their medical care or any other benefits they might receive.  413 
 414 
D. Adequacy of protection against risks  415 
 416 
Recruitment and informed consent /assent  417 
We sought  informed assent in all children that were  capable of providing assent (age ≥7 years old) 418 
and permission of their caregiver in the ED . In children < 7 years old, consent was obtained from 419 
the caregiver in the ED . As this study was no greater than minimal ri sk, the permission of only one 420 
parent or guardian was sufficient for research to be conducted under the Additional Protections for 421 
Children Involved as Subjects in Research (45 CFR Part 46.404). Assent from the child and 422 
PCORI contract # AS 1307 -05420  
 
CHICAGO Plan Protocol  
12-01-2017          Page 16 of 36 permission or consent from the pare nt/guardian was be obtained by the ED coordinator at each 423 
participating clinical site. All staff were  trained in informed consent/assent procedures and were  424 
available to read the consent/assent forms to individual with low literacy levels. The consent/asse nt 425 
form s were  available in English and Spanish.  426 
 427 
All caregiver/family information, including contact information, qu estionnaires, pharmacy 428 
dispensation  and clinical information was available only available to  designated members of the 429 
research team.  Case report forms were  locked in cabinets and electronic data was stored on 430 
password -protected files.  Only authorized study staff had access to study data.  Study reports 431 
presented to external collaborators did  not contain any identifiable information and findings  were 432 
presented  in aggregate (or by treatment group).   433 
 434 
Incomplete disclosure  435 
As participants in this trial were  aware of which treatment group they are assigned to, there was a 436 
risk for Hawthorne effect ( change in behavior as a result of monitoring alone)  and information bias 437 
as it relates to answering questions for the patient -reported outcomes (the primary outcomes and 438 
several secondary outcomes) . Although there may have been  changes in behavior (e.g., i mproved 439 
adherence to corticosteroids), our studies and those of others have shown that monitoring does not 440 
itself result in sustained adherence. To minimize this risk , however , there was incomplete 441 
disclosure of the interventions in the CHICAGO study durin g informed consent. The study was 442 
described as testing different communication strategies combining written and verbal instructions 443 
to all participants.  Using doorknob hangers, as was successfully performed in a recent study , we 444 
aimed to mask the participants .  Regardless of the arm the participant is randomized in, children 445 
and caregiver/families will receive a doorknob hanger in the form of a plasticized document, 446 
depicting one or more facts about asthma unrelated to the study interventions (e.g. , 447 
recommendations for influenza vaccinations ).  To minimize the risk of bias, the DCC research 448 
assistant who collect ed outcome data was be masked to the treatment group.  449 
 450 
Incomplete disclosure is generally necessary in studies of bias or social desirabili ty (such as 451 
monitoring of adherence) and is considered acceptable by medical ethicists, the American 452 
Psychological Association, and IRBs when certain strict criteria are met. In designing this study, as 453 
with previous studies conducted by Dr. Krishnan, we had been guided by the American 454 
Psychological Association (APA) Ethics Code for conducting research.   Specifically, we believe d 455 
that incomplete disclosure was minimal risk to participants and was unavoidable since we were  456 
proposing to monitor behavior while minimizing the risk of Hawthorne effect.   Moreover, we 457 
follow ed the recommendations of the APA and Bersoff et al . that call for a full debriefing of 458 
participants at the conclusion of the study.  459 
 460 
E. Potential benefits  of the proposed research  to the subjects  and others  461 
 462 
It is difficult to know if the participants benefit ed from the research.  All study 463 
participants/caregivers receive d instruction about appropriate MDI use with the teach -to-back 464 
methodology; they also receive d two MDI spacers for their use.   Other than these specific  benefits, 465 
we did not indicate any benefit s from participating.   466

 469 
African American and Latino  children suffer disproportionate asthma outcomes compared to non - 470 
Latino  whites, as evidenced by emergency department (ED) visits for uncontrolled asthma. This 471 
study aimed  to evaluate the effectiveness of using multi -level interventions to increase self - 472 
management skills and patient -centered outcomes in a minority pediatric ED population with 473 
uncontrolled asthma. If this intervention proves successful, it could make a significant impact in 474 
adherence to the asthma guidelines and equalize asthma care and heal th care utilization, among 475 
African American and Latino  children with asthma. Risks to participants and their caregivers 476 
involved in the research were  minimal.  477 
 478 
G.  Data safety monitoring plan  479 
 480 
The study was reviewed by the IRB at each participating institution and approval was sought 481 
before study activities begin.  We also submitted  IRB continuing reviews annually and adverse 482 
event reports as specified by each IRB.  This study used a Data and Safety Monitori ng Board 483 
(DSMB) which include d 5 individuals  who were  not affiliated with any of the participating 484 
institutions  (1 chair  with extensive expertise multi -center  clinical trials, 2 pediatricians , 1 485 
statistician, and 1 caregiver ). The DSMB convene d once in Year 1  (review/approve final study 486 
protocol) and twice per year in Year 2  and Year 3.  The DSMB made  affirmative decision s at each 487 
meeting whether to continue or terminate the study.  Early termination was always  an option for 488 
the DSMB, particularly if there were  serious concerns about patient safety or there is evidence of 489 
futility or sufficient evidence of efficacy; decisions regarding early termination were  made by the 490 
DSMB  during convened meetings . No interim a nalyses of outcomes for efficacy or futility were  491 
planned  before the study or requested by the DSMB  throughout the study .  In general, the DSMB 492 
was provided data grouped by treatment (i.e., masked to treatment assignment).  If the DSMB had 493 
requested , for t he purpose of competent deliberation, to see the treatment assignments (by group or 494 
individual), these would have been  provided by the DCC biostatistician .  Insofar as possible, the 495 
investigators remain ed masked to the treatment assignments of individual p atients unless it was 496 
judged that it was in the best interests of an individual patient.   497 
 498 
H. ClinicalTrials.gov requirements  499 
 500 
This trial was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov  prior to start of enrollment of participants. The 501 
results of the trial will be reported within the required timeframe. The registration will be updated 502 
and results be made available according to the requirements.  503 
 504 
I.  Inclusion of women  and minorities  505 
 506 
The proportion of girls included in the study intended  to mirror the prevalence of this condition in 507 
the community and the patient population of the medical center s in which the study took place. 508 
The study took place at different medical centers that serve  a large number of racial or ethnic 509 
minorities. The investigators anticipate d that approximately 70% of participants would  be African 510 
American, 15% Latino , 8% Caucasian and 7% other (Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander) 511 
reflecting the racial and ethnic background of our patient populations.  Minorities were  enrolled as 512 
they presented  to enrollment sites, and Spanish -speaking participants were  included.  513

(24) % of participants with 12 -month FOLLOW -UP data within 367 calendar days of discharge 881 
(window is 360 days +/ - 7 calendar days); this data collection time -point is only for those 882 
participants enrolled within first 7.5 months of enrollment period (50% of enrollment period) 883 
to ensure there is adequate observation time for data collec tion at 12 months.  884 
During the conduct  of the study , we reviewed  missing data and time to complete data collection ; 885 
these data were used  to provide feedback  and additional training to study staff as needed .  886 
The Data Coordinating Center collect ed these data in the REDcap dat abase, which will be used by 887 
the DCC research assistants to document attempted and completed outcome assessments. Training or 888 
re-training was performed and documented on a case -by-case basis.  889

12-01-2017          Page 36 of 36 The study design employed  the “larg e simple trial” or “pragmatic trial” format, rather than an 890 
efficacy design.  The target performance varied  by metric.  For elements linked to human subjects 891 
protection (e.g., obtaining written informed consent from the caregiver; assent from the child >7y rs), 892 
the definition for major protocol deviation is <100%.  For elements linked to implementing the 893 
interventions or data collection linked to specific time points, the definition for major protocol 894 
deviation is <50%.   The goal is 100% performance on all metrics; we will ask site PIs to develop a 895 
written corrective action plan if site -level performance for implementing the protocol is <80% 896 
(<100% if there are deviations linked to human subjects protection).  We reported  major protocol 897 
deviations to the DSM B within 14 days after the event has been discovered by the contact PI.  898 
Depending on the site -specific reporting requirements, we may also report major deviations to the 899 
site’s Institutional Review Board (IRB); for example, we will report all instances wh ere informed 900 
consent was not obtained, but, depending on the institution may not need to report completion rates 901 
of study visits prior to the annual continuing review date for that institution’s IRB . 902

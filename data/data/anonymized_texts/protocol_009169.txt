  3 INTRODUCTION  
 
1.3 STUDY RATIONALE   
 
In this study, we will pilot an intervention (integrated mindfulness -based stress reduction and diabetes 
self- management education) in a small group of participants to assess acceptability, feasibility, and 
preliminary efficacy.  
 
1.4 BACKGROUND   
 Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease that is especially common in the Southeastern United States, affecting 14% of adults in Alabama. Low -income and racial/ethnic minority adults are disproportionately 
affected by type 2 diabetes. Managing type 2 diabetes requires patients to eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, take all medications as prescribed, and monitor their blood sugar, which can be challenging for many patients.  
 Patients with type 2 diabetes who have elevated diabetes distress are less likely to follow the 
recommended treatment or to have well -controlled diabetes. Although some existing treatments help 
to improve distress, these treatments do not consistently improve diabetes self -management or 
outcomes. Information about how other psychosocial  factors is associated with diabetes distress is 
limited. Additionally, the temporal relationship between diabetes distress and diabetes self-management behaviors has not been clearly elucidated. A better understanding of how diabetes distress is associated with other psychosocial factors and diabetes self- management behaviors will allow for the 
development of more effective interventions.   
We applied  a systematic method to develop an intervention which integrates components of 
mindfulness -based stress red uction and diabetes self -management education. In this study, we will p ilot 
test this intervention in a small group of participants to assess acceptability and feasibility.  
 
1.5 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT    
 
1.5.1  KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  
 
All participants will be treated according to the highest ethical standards. No participant will experience 
a reduction in medical, or any other type of needed service (e.g., social or clinical) that are currently 
available to him/her. Participation may in volve completing a questionnaire, semi -structured interviews, 
or participating in the pilot study intervention (Mindfulness -Based Diabetes Education). Semi -structured 
interviews and focus groups will be audio -recorded, but no unique identifiers will be use d in the 
collection of their responses. No significant risks are anticipated with this portion of the research plan than otherwise experienced in day -to-day living. The participants may experience some discomfort in 
talking about personal health issues, emotional distress, or diabetes management.   Breach of Confidentiality. The main potential risk of this study is breach of confidentiality. This is one of the most common risks of participation in clinical research. Accordingly, our team has designed a 
strategy to protect participant confidentiality. All participants will be informed of study procedures and 
gauged for understanding of study tasks. In addition, study personnel will follow regulatory guidelines 
<Pilot Study of Mindfulness- Based Diabetes Education> Version 1.0 
 <10/30/2022> 
  4 for obtaining informed consent. All interviews and intervention activities will be conducted in a private 
space. For all participants, research data will be stored using a unique participant identification code (sequence number based on entry to the study) instead of names or other personal identifiers. Consent forms with links to participant study numbers will be kept in a locked file cabinet in a locked office with 
the PI (Dr. Presley) or research assistant. According to UAB regulatory policy, records relating to 
research, including informed consent doc uments, shall be securely retained for one year after 
completion of the research. All records shall be accessible for inspection and copying by authorized representatives of the department or sponsor agency at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner. All electronic study data are kept on UAB secure encrypted password protected servers, and will only be 
available to research personnel for this project. All study personnel will complete HIPAA and human subjects training in accordance with UAB Institutiona l Review Board policy.  
 Emotional Distress . Participants will complete the 17 -item DDS measure after informed consent is 
obtained, which will be scored by study personnel to determine eligibility. Additionally, measures of 
emotional distress will be assessed at baseline and 2 -month follow -up for intervention participants. The 
measures assess the level of diabetes distress and depressive symptoms that a participant is 
experiencing, these are not diagnostic tests. Our study measures will not ask about suicidality. 
Participants may experience emotional distress related to participating in the in tervention, due to the 
focus on emotional distress. Participants will be informed that they may stop participation at any time if they feel uncomfortable. Additionally, if a participant appears to be in emotional distress, study staff will inquire as to the participant’s well-being and whether they wish to stop the study visit or session. 
Participants who disclose potentially harmful information (e.g., suicidality) will be immediately referred for an assessment by behavioral health at CGMHSA. All participan ts will be provided with a letter 
outlining services that details information on available mental health services at CGMHSA and low -cost 
resources available in Jefferson County . 
Inconvenience. Participating in the study may inconvenience  patients because of the time needed to 
collect data and participate in the intervention sessions.  
 Alternative Treatments and Procedures: All study participants, including those in the single -arm pilot 
intervention, will have full access to all available standard of care clinical services at CGMHSA, and are permitted to withdraw or refuse participation at any time.  
 
1.5.2  KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 Participants may or may not benefit from the study. For participants in the pilot intervention, benefits may includ e improvement in emotional distress, diabetes self -management behaviors, and glycemic 
control. Risks to participants are related primarily to breach of confidentiality and emotional distress. As the risk to individual participants is small and potential benefits are significant, the risk/benefit ratio is favorable.  
 
2 STUDY DESIGN  
 
2.1 OVERALL DESIGN  
  This is a single -arm pilot study of Mindful ness -Based Diabetes Education  (an integrated mindfulness -
based stress reduction and diabetes self -management education  intervention ) in adults with type 2 
diabetes who receive care at a safety -net healthcare system. Participants will complete baseline and 2 -

3.3 SCREEN FAILURES  
 <Insert text>  
 
3.4 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
 Study participants will be recruited from Cooper Green Mercy Health System Authority (CGMHSA). At CGMHSA, a report of patients who have been referred to diabetes education from 2017- 2020 was  
generated to identify potential study participants. Letters will be mailed to participants (letters included), followed by a phone call to inform them of the study (phone script included), conduct screening listed below, and if participants are interested to schedule a study visit.  
 
Additionally, potential participants  may be identified through screening in the CGMHSA diabetes clinic 
or primary care clinic. CGMHSA clinicians will provide contact information (names, phone numbers) for potential participants seen in diabetes or primary care clinics who agree to be contact ed about the 
study. Similar to the process described above, study personnel will call potential participants by phone 
to inform them of the study (phone scripts included), conduct screening listed below, and if participants are interested to schedule a study v isit. 
 Study PI will inform CGMHSA primary care providers of the study and eligibility criteria (providing a study recruitment flyer); primary care providers will be asked to have any interested potential 
participants to contact study personnel at the numb er listed on the flyer.   
<Pilot Study of Mindfulness- Based Diabetes Education> Version 1.0 
 <10/30/2022> 
  6 If participants contact study personnel after seeing a study flyer or after learning of the study from their 
primary care provider, study staff will speak to potential participants by phone (upon call from potential participant or  by returning a phone call to the potential participant), provide additional information 
about the study, conduct screening listed below, and if participants are interested to schedule a study 
visit. During the recruitment phone call, study staff will explain the research project.

5 STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND SUBJECT  
DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
 
5.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION  
 
This study will be stopped prior to its c ompletion if: (1) the intervention is associated with adverse 
effects that call into question the safety of the intervention; (2) difficulty in study recruitment or retention will significantly impact the ability to evaluate the study endpoints; (3) any new information becomes available during the trial that necessitates stopping the trial; or (4) other situations occur that might warrant stopping the trial.  
 
5.2 SUBJECT  DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY 
Subject s are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue  or withdraw a subject  from  the study for the following reasons : 
 
• Significant study intervention non -compliance  
• If any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation 
occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the subject  
<Pilot Study of Mindfulness- Based Diabetes Education> Version 1.0 
 <10/30/2022> 
  8 Subjec ts who sign the informed consent form and are randomized but do not receive the study 
intervention may be replaced.  Subjects who sign the informed consent form, and are randomized and 
receive the study intervention , and subsequently withdraw, or are withd rawn or discontinued  from the 
study, will not be replaced.  
5.3 LOST TO FOLLOW- UP 
A subject  will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she fails to return for 2 scheduled visits and is 
unable to be contacted by the study site  staff.  
 
The following actions must be taken if a subject  fails to be available for a required study visit:  
• The site will  attempt to contact the subject  and reschedule the missed visit and counsel the 
subject  on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit sche dule and ascertain if the subject  
wishes to and/or should continue in the study.  
• Before a subject  is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will m ake every effort 
to regain contact with the subject  (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if  necessary, a certified 
letter to the subject ’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact 
attempts should be documented in the subject ’s medical record or study file.  
• Should the subject  continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have withdrawn 
from the study with a primary rea son o f lost to follow -up. 
 
 
6 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
 
6.1 STUDY  ASSESSMENTS  
 Participants will complete assessment at baseline and 2 months. Assessments will include interviewer -
administered measures. Participants will also participate in a focus group for acceptability following completion of the intervention. Process measures for feasibility will be tracked throughout the study.  
 Acceptability, focus groups:  
• assessment of intervention content  
• perceived positive or negative effects  
• appropriateness of intervention duration and frequency  
• barriers to engagement, suggestions to improve the intervention  
• overall satisfaction  
Feasibility of the intervention using process measures:  
• percentage of screened participants who are eligible  
• percentage of eligible participants who enroll  
• distribution of participants by demographics (age, race, ethnicity, gender)  
• number of sessio ns attended  
• participant adherence to study tasks  
• overall study retention  
Preliminary efficacy: baseline and 2 -month follow -up: 
• diabetes distress (Diabetes Distress Scale)  
• diabetes self -management behaviors (Adherence to Refills and Medications scale, 
Summary of Diabetes Self- Care Activities)  
<Pilot Study of Mindfulness- Based Diabetes Education> Version 1.0 
 <10/30/2022> 
  9 • glycemic control (A1C test results from electronic medical records)  
 
6.2 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
   
6.2.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurren ce associated with the use of an intervention in 
humans, whether or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  
 
6.2.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “ serious ” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life-threatening adverse event  (of note, the term “life- threatening” refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event, rather than to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe ) 
• inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions  
• or a congen ital anomaly/birth defect . 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
subject  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or con vulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
6.2.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
6.2.3.1  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For adverse events (AEs) , the following guidelines will be used to describe severi ty:  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject ’s daily 
activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functi oning.  
• Severe  – Events interrupt a subject ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy 
or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  Of 
note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to  “serious .” 
 
6.2.3.2  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
All adverse events ( AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by the clinician who 
examines and evaluates the subject  based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The 
degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect.  
<Pilot Study of Mindfulness- Based Diabetes Education> Version 1.0 
 <10/30/2022> 
  10  
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention , there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study intervention  caused the AE , or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
intervention  and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study intervention  and the AE. 
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention  caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention  
and event onset, or an alt ernate etiology has been established.  
 
6.2.3.3  EXPECTEDNESS  
The Principal Investigator will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event ( AE) is expected 
or unexpected.  An AE  will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is 
not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention . 
6.2.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an  adverse event (AE ) or serious adverse event (SAE ) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study subject  presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monitor.  
 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAE s will be captured on the 
appropriate  case report form  (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by t hose with the 
training and authority to make a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject  is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study subject ’s condition  deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 Chan ges in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity  to be performed. A Es characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each episode.  
 The Study Coordin ator will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after 
informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of 
study participation.  At each study visit, the Study Coordinator  will in quire about the occurrence of 
AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
 
6.2.5  ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
All serious adverse events must be reported to the IRB according to regulatory requirement s. The 
Principal Investigator will immediately report to the sponsor any serious adverse event, whether or not 
considered study intervention related, including those listed in the protocol or package insert  and must 
include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility th at the study intervention caused 
the event. Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all- cause mortality) must be reported 
in accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the 
<Pilot Study of Mindfulness- Based Diabetes Education> Version 1.0 
 <10/30/2022> 
  11 study intervention and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the investigator must 
immediately report the event to the sponsor.  
 All serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the Principal 
Investigator deems the  event to be chronic or the subject  is stable. Other supporting documentation of 
the event may be requested and should be provided as soon as possible.  
 
6.3 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
6.3.1  DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP) 
The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
subject s or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the 
following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject  population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedur es involved in the research); and  
• Suggests that the research places subject s or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
6.3.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING  
The investigator will report unanticipated problems (UP s) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB). The UP report will include the following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
numbe r; 
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP ;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP . 
 To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UP s will be reported using the following timeline:   
 
• UPs that are serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB within 10 working  days  of 
the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other UP  will be reported to the IRB within 10 working days  of the investigator becoming 
aware of the problem.  
 
 
7 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
<Pilot Study of Mindfulness- Based Diabetes Education> Version 1.0 
 <10/30/2022> 
  12 7.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
 
• Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s):  
 
No formal  hypothe sis te sting given small sample size.  
 
• Seco ndary Efficacy Endpoint(s):  
 
 
7.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
 
Sample size considerati ons: 
Based on recruitment for prior studies at CGMHS conducted by Dr. Cherrington, we anticipate it will be 
feasible to recruit 30 adults to  participate in the pilot intervention. We provide a power calculation to 
further justify our sample size. Assuming a standard deviation of 1.8% for the change in HbA1c (from baseline to 2-month follow -up), which was obtained from results of a prior interv ention study in adults 
with type 2 diabetes recruited from CGMHS, a sample size of 30 participants, a two -sided paired t -test, 
and a significance level of 0.05, we will have 80% power to detect changes in HbA1c (from baseline to follow -up) of 1.0% and grea ter as being statistically significant.62 This calculation was performed using 
nQuery Advisor + nTerim, version 3.  
 
7.3 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
7.3.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
 
Given our small sample size and the resultant lack of precision of an estimate of effect size, we will not 
estimate efficacy based on outcome measures. In addition, we will not be testing formal statistical hypotheses.  
 
7.3.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
Initial proposed analysis: To estimate effect size of the pilot intervention, we will perform paired t -tests 
to study the change in the pr imary outcome, A1C, and secondary outcomes, diabetes distress and 
diabetes self -management behaviors, from baseline to post -intervention. Analysis of covariance will be 
used to examine baseline to 2- month changes in primary and secondary outcomes while con trolling for 
potential covariates of interest, such as demographics or disease severity. Distributions of continuous outcome variables will be examined for normality using box plots, stem and leaf plots, and normal probability plots. Variables that are det ermined to be non -normally distributed will be transformed or 
analyzed using non -parametric tests, such as Wilcoxon signed- rank test. All statistical tests will be two -
sided using a significance level of 0.05. Statistical analysis will be completed using S AS, version 9.4 or 
later.  
 
Analy sis plan : We will generate descriptive statistics, including frequency distribution tables for 
categorical variables, as well as means, medians, standard deviations, and interquartile ranges for 
continuous variables, including diabetes distress.  
 
<Pilot Study of Mindfulness- Based Diabetes Education> Version 1.0 
 <10/30/2022> 
  13 7.3.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SE CONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
We will also generate descriptive statistics, including frequency distribution tables for categorical variables, as well as means, medians, standard deviations, and interquartile ranges for continuous 
variables , for feasibility measure s. 
 
Qualitative methods will be applied to data collected participants related to acceptability.  
 
7.3.4  SAFETY ANALYSES  
 Descriptive statistics, primarily frequency distribution tables for categorical variables, will be generated for any adverse e vents.  
 
7.3.5  BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS  
 Descriptive statistics, primarily frequency distribution tables for categorical variables, will be generated to characterize participants . We will also generate descriptive statistics, including frequency distribution 
tables for categorical variables, as well as means, medians, standard deviations, and interquartile ranges for continuous variables.

Title of Research: Intervention mapping  to adapt a mindfulness-based  intervention for adults with 
diabetes and emotional distress
UAB IRB Protocol #: IRB-300003578
Principal Investigator: Caroline Presley,  MD MPH
Sponsor: UAB Center for Clinical and Translational Science, UAB Diabetes Research Center
General Information
You are  being asked to take  part  in a research study.  This  research study is voluntary, 
meaning you do not have  to take part in it. The  procedures,  risks, and benefits are  fully 
described further  in the consent form.
Purpose The purpose of  the study is  to pilot test the content of a Mindfulness-Based Diabetes 
Education program with adults who  have type 2 diabetes in order  to get participants’  
feedback on the program. This information will be used to adapt and improve the  
program based  on participants’ input.
Duration & Visits You will be in this study for  up to 2 months. You are being asked to  complete  2 study 
visits at enrollment  and at 2 months, as well as to attend  1 focus  group  at 2 months. The  
study visits will last  approximately 30-45 minutes, and participants will  be asked to 
complete a questionnaire. The focus  group  will take approximately 60 minutes, and  
participants will be asked for their thoughts  and feedback on the program.  
This study  will provide  a program called Mindfulness-Based Diabetes Education.  This is a 
new program that combines a stress management and  a diabetes self-management 
education program. It is an  8-week program with  weekly meetings in-person, group 
meetings. Sessions  will focus on  education  and strategies to improve diabetes self-
management including healthy eating, physical  activity, medication taking,  self-
monitoring, and will also include instruction and practice of mindfulness-based exercises to reduce  stress. 
Overview of Procedures
This study  will include 2 study visits and a focus group that will be run  by a trained 
facilitator to get participants’ feedback on the Mindfulness-Based Diabetes  Education 
program. If you are  eligible and choose to participate, you  will receive Mindfulness-
Based Diabetes Education program.
Risks The most  common risks  include  breach of confidentiality, inconvenience, or emotional 
distress. You  may experience minor pain or  discomfort related to  study activities; this is a 
minor risk and  is reversible.
Benefits You may  or may  not benefit from the study. This research may help develop  an 
intervention and benefit future patient care.
Alternatives Your alternative is  not to participate in the research.
Purpose of the Research  Study
We are  asking you to take part in a research study to reduce stress and improve diabetes self-management in 
adults who have type 2 diabetes. Alabama is  3rd for diabetes  among all 50 states in  the United States  which 
means about 14% of people in the  state have  diabetes.  Diabetes distress is common with  adults with  type  2 
diabetes and impacts  diabetes self-management  and  blood glucose control. Currently, programs that improve 
both diabetes distress and diabetes self-management are lacking.
This study  will pilot  test the content of a Mindfulness-Based Diabetes  Education program with adults  who have 
type 2 diabetes in order to get participants’ feedback on the program.  The  feedback  will be used to improve and

interventions –  Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and Diabetes  Self-Management  Education.  This pilot  study 
will assess the acceptability,  feasibility, and preliminary efficacy  of the intervention. Participants’ input will be  
used to adapt  and improve the program. This study  will enroll up to 30  participants  by the University of  Alabama 
at Birmingham in conjunction with Cooper Green Mercy Healthcare  Services Authority.
Study Participation & Procedures
You have been screened and are  eligible to participate in this  research  study. Eligibility : To be  eligible to 
participate in this study,  you need to complete a prescreening questionnaire,  be 19 to  64 years of age, and meet 
eligibility requirements.  
To enroll in this study,  a questionnaire will be  conducted. If you decide to participate in  this  study, you will 
attend a  total of  two study  assessment visits including today’s visit, as  well as a  one focus group.  The  study  visits 
will take  place  at the beginning of  the study and  at 2 months. These visits will last about 30-45 minutes  and  take 
place in a private room at Cooper  Green Mercy  Healthcare Authority or Medical Towers at  UAB or  may  be 
conducted by remotely by telephone or video-conference. Questionnaires include self-reported measures  of 
your mood, stress,  self-efficacy, social support, diabetes self-management behaviors, treatment  
satisfaction/burden. The following measures  will be collected by trained research  staff at each study assessment  
visit:
Measure Description
Questionnaire Questions about your mood,  stress, self-efficacy,  social  support, diabetes  self-
management behaviors, treatment satisfaction/burden
Hemoglobin A1c Result Study staff will obtain  your most recent  hemoglobin A1c result from your medical 
record. No other information will be obtained from your medical record.
The focus group will be held at the  completion  of the 2-month program and run  by a trained facilitator. It will 
last approximately 60-minutes and will ask for participants’ feedback  on the program.
If you decide to  participate,  you will be assigned to receive the Mindfulness-Based Diabetes Education program.  
This is  a new program that combines Mindfulness-Based  Stress Reduction and Diabetes Self-Management 
Education. If you enter  and  complete this study, you will be in this study for a  total of 2 months. The  
Mindfulness-Based Diabetes Education  program  will be held  weekly,  in-person, in a group  setting.  Over 2 
months, you will have eight weekly sessions  for the program with  a trained facilitator and other study  
participants. You will  receive a schedule at the beginning  of the  program with the sessions outlined. The group 
sessions will occur every week.  Approximately 5-10 participants will be assigned to each group.
Group meetings will  be held in person  in a conference room at  Cooper  Green or at Medical Towers. Group 
meetings will last about  90 to 120 minutes each. Group sessions will focus on education and discussion about  
mindfulness-based exercises to reduce stress,  as well as modules focused on healthy  eating,  physical activity, 
medication taking, self-monitoring to improve diabetes management.  A trained interventionist  will deliver each 
session. If you  agree  to join the study, the  study will not make any  changes to  your  medications.

Risks and Discomforts
The risks  for this study are low. You will be assigned  to the  Mindfulness-Based  Diabetes  Education program, as 
this is a pilot study testing  a new intervention.  This program may prove to  be less  effective or to have more side 
Page 3  of 5
Version Date: 07/26/21effects than  alternatives.  If you enter this study, you will be asked to attend group  meetings  that focus on  skills  
you need to reduce stress and improve your  diabetes  self-management.  Risks include discomfort, a loss of  
confidentiality, minor pain, and inconvenience.  You may feel some discomfort in  talking about personal health 
issues, emotional  distress, or diabetes management. You will only be  asked to  discuss what you feel comfortable 
sharing and you may choose not to share. Study staff will explain to  all participants that what is said in group 
meetings is confidential. However, a  risk for entering  this program  is loss of confidentiality. This risk  is very 
small, as study staff follow rules to make sure your  information is  shared only with people  who are supposed to 
have it.  We take precautions to minimize the risk of loss of confidentiality including storing study  information 
with a code only, there is no  participant’s  name  or other identifying information. Access to  study information 
will be  restricted to study personnel. Study information will be stored electronically on a secure, encrypted, 
password protected  server. Program sessions will be audio-recorded to  assess fidelity of the program; names or  
other identifying information will be removed from the transcripts  and  only study  staff will  have  access to  these.
You will be encouraged to make changes  to your habits around  your diabetes self-management (including 
healthy eating, physical  activity, self-monitoring,  medication taking) as well  as to practice mindfulness exercises 
to reduce  stress. You may feel tired or hungry when  you first make these changes, but this  is usually mild and 
often gets better with time. This study will include gentle, non-strenuous  physical activity including walking and 
gentle yoga. Participants will  be offered modifications based  on their physical  abilities. You could hurt  yourself  
when exercising, such  as spraining your ankle. On rare occasions, increased exercise can  cause chest pain  and 
undue shortness of  breath. This is not common, and you will only be  asked to  make changes  that  are 
comfortable for you. Over 2-months, you will be asked to attend 2  study  assessment visits, 8 group meetings, 
and 1 focus group. These study activities may be inconvenient and take time from your day-to-day activities. You 
will be  assigned to the study program, which may prove to be  less  effective than alternatives.
Benefits
If you participate,  you  may experience reduced  stress  and improved diabetes self-management. Improved 
diabetes distress and  diabetes self-management behaviors have benefits  for diabetes  outcomes  and reduced 
risks of  complications due to diabetes.
Alternatives
The alternative to study participation is that  you  may choose not to take part at all. There are other  available  
diabetes self-management education programs that are not associated with this  research  study. You may 
discuss these  alternative treatment options with your primary care provider.

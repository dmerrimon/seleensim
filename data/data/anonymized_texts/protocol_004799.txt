Title  A Phase 2B Randomized, Double -blind, Placebo -controlled, Dose -ranging, Parallel -
design Study of the Efficacy and Safety of VX -150 for Acute Pain Following 
Bunionectomy  
  
Brief Title  A Dose -ranging Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of VX -150 in Subjects With 
Acute Pain Following Bunionectomy  
  
Clinical Phase and 
Clinical Study Type  Phase  2B efficacy and safety  
  
Objectives  Primary Objective  
To evaluate the dose- response relationship of VX -150 in treating acute pain following 
bunionectomy  
Secondary Objectives  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of VX -150 
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of VRT -1207355 and the metabolite 
VRT -1268114 (M5)  
  
Endpoints  Primary Endpoint  
Time -weighted sum of the pain intensity difference between VX- 150 versus placebo 
as recorded on a Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) 0 to 24 hours (SPID 24) after 
the first dose  
Secondary Endpoints  
• Time -weighted sum of the pain  intensity difference between VX -150 versus 
placebo as recorded on an NPRS 0 to 48 hours (SPID 48) after the first dose  
• Proportions of subjects with at least 30%, 50%, or 70% reduction in NPRS at 24 
hours after the first dose of VX -150 versus placebo 
• Time to onset of “confirmed perceptible pain relief” and “meaningful pain relief” 
after the first dose of VX -150 versus placebo 
• Plasma PK parameters of VRT -1207355 and the metabolite M5 
• Safety and tolerability based on the incidence and type of adverse events ( AEs), 
changes from baseline in clinically significant laboratory test results, and vital 
signs at designated visits  
Number of Subjects  Approximately 242 subjects.  
  
Study Population  Male and female subjects who are between the ages of 18  and 65  years (inclusive) 
with pain that is ≥4 on the NPRS and is moderate or severe on the Verbal Categorical Rating Scale (VRS) after bunionectomy  
  

Protocol VX18 -150-104, Version  2.0 Page 4 of 51 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Investigational Drug  Active substance: VX -150 
 Activity: Voltage -gated sodiu m channel  (Na v) 1.8 inhibitor  
 Strength and route of administration: 250-mg capsules administered orally  
 
Study Duration  Excluding the Screening Period, each subject will participate in the study for 11  (± 2) 
days (from Day  -1 to the Safety Follow -up Phone Interview).  
  
Study Design  This is a Phase 2B randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, dose -ranging, 
6-arm, parallel -design study. Subjects will receive a primary unilateral first metatarsal 
bunionectomy repair on Day -1. A continuous popliteal sciatic block infusion (0.2% 
ropivacaine) will be started after surgery and  will be removed between 3AM and 
5AM on Day 1. After removal of the popliteal sciatic block, a subject can be 
randomized once the subject requests the first dose of study drug for  pain relief, and 
the subject’s pain is ≥4 on the NPRS and is moderate or severe on the VRS. If a subject does not meet the NPRS and VRS criteria within 9  hours of removal of the 
popliteal sciatic block, the subject will not be eligible to enroll in the st udy. 
A total of approximately 242 subjects will be randomized 2:2:2: 2:1:2 to 6 treatment 
arms , evaluating a range of  5 VX-150 dose levels  as shown in Table  2-1: 
Table 2-1 VX-150 Doses by Treatment Arm

Subjects  
VX-150 1 (highest)  First dose 1500 mg, then 750  mg

 3 500 mg q12h  44 
 4 First dose 500 mg, then 250 mg 
q12h  44 
 5 (lowest)  250 mg qd  22 
Placebo    44 
q12h: every 12 hours; qd: daily  
Note: q12h dosing will be th rough 36 hours after the first  dose of study drug 
throughout the protocol . 
Randomization will be stratified by site and sex. To maintain the blind, all subjects 
will receive the same number of capsules in a double- dummy design.  
Subjects will report their pain on the NPRS at scheduled time points through 48  hours 
after the first dose of study drug. In addition, pain intensity will be recorded on the 
NPRS immediately before each administration of rescue medication. Subjects are encouraged to wait 90 minutes after the first dose of study drug to receive rescue medication, and subjects should generally not receive rescue medication unless their 
NPRS is ≥4. However, subjects may receive rescue medication at any time after the 
first dose of study drug per their request. The rescue medication will be ibuprofen 
(400 mg [oral]  every 4 hours  [q4h] as needed [prn] ). 
  
Assessments  Efficacy : 11-point NPRS, 4 -point VRS, double -stopwatch assessment,  
 
Safety: AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, clinical evaluation of vital signs, ECGs, and physical examinations.  
PK: Plasma PK parameters of VRT -1207355 and the metabolite M5 
 

Protocol VX18 -150-104, Version  2.0 Page 5 of 51

Statistical Analyses  The primary efficacy endpoint is the time -weighted sum of the pain intensity 
difference between VX -150 versus placebo as recorded on a NPRS 0 to 24 hours 
(SPID 24) after the first dose.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be using the MCP -Mod (multiple comparison 
procedures with modeling techniques) approach to detect the dose- response 
relationship from a candidate set of 4 dose -response models (Linear, Emax, Logistic , 
and Sigmoid Emax). Two -sided P value for each dose- response model will be 
provided.  
Both MCP -Mod approach  in SPID 24 between VX -150 and 
placebo will be based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. The model 
will include the time -weighted sum of t he pain intensity difference 0 to 24 hours 
(SPID 24) after the first dose as the dependent variable, and treatment as a fixed 
effect, with adjustment for stratification factors, i.e., site and sex, and baseline pain as 
a covariate.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Background  
Pain is one of the most common symptoms for which patients seek medical attention. It is a 
protective mechanism designed to prevent tissue injury. When pain persists beyond its usefulness, it becomes pathological and can prove debilitating. Current pain therapies suffer from poor efficacy and a high risk of adverse events (AEs). For example, lidocaine (a nonselective sodium channel blocker) may effectively reduce pain, but its utility is limited because of prominent side effects when given at dose levels required for pain relief.
1 According to 2016 
estimates, more than 42,000 deaths were attributable to opioids in the US, and in Europe, more 
than 80% of fatal drug overdoses involve opioids .2, 3 The limited treatment options for pain, 
combined with a growing awareness of the risks of the current standards of care, underscore the need for new pain management therapies.  
Voltage-gated sodi um channels (Na
v) play a critical role in pain signaling based on both 
nonclinical and clinical evidence. Evaluation of the role these channels play in normal physiology and the pathological states arising from mutations in sodium channel genes and animal models, as well as the pharmacology of known sodium channel modulating agents, all 
point to the critical role of Na
vs in pain sensation.4-6 The Na v1.8 channel is primarily restricted to 
peripheral neurons that sense pain (e.g., dorsal root ganglia) and is known to mediate pain sensation and chronic pain. For example, Na
v1.8 gain-of- functi on mutations are thought to 
directly cause chronic pain in patients with painful small fiber neuropathy .7-9 This channel has 
been identified as a target for analgesia10 and selective Na v1.8 inhibitors, which have the 
potential to treat pain indications where the primary mechanism for pain is nociceptor hyperexcitability.  
VX-150, an orally bioavailable prodrug that rapidly converts in vivo to the active moiety VRT -1207355, is being developed for the treatment of pain. VRT-1207355 is a Na
v1.8 blocker 
that is highly selective for Na v1.8 relative to the other sodium channel subtypes. In vivo saf ety 
studies conducted with either VX-150 or VRT-1207355 have not identified target organs of toxicity.  
5.2 Study Rationale  
To date, 5 Phase 1 clinical studies and 2 Phase 2 proof-of-concept (POC) studies have been completed with VX -150. This Phase 2 dose-ranging study was designed to help inform dose 
selection for Phase 3 studies in acute pain.  
Data from clinical and nonclinical studies of VX -150 and the current unmet medical need for 
new treatments for acute pain support clinical development of VX-150. Further details of the 
VX-150 development program are available in the VX- 150 Investigator’s Brochure .

9 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION  
9.1 Study Design 
This is a Phase 2B randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose ranging, 6- arm, 
parallel -design study. Subjects will receive a primary unilateral first metatarsal bunionectomy 
repair on Day -1 ( Figure  9-1) . A continuous popliteal sciatic block infusion (0.2% ropivacaine) 
will be started after surgery and will be removed between 3AM and 5AM on Day 1. After 
removal of the popliteal sciatic block, a subject can be randomized once the subject requests the first dose of study drug for pain relief, and the subject’s pain is ≥4 on the NPRS and is moderate or severe on the VRS. If a subject does not meet the NPRS and VRS criteria within 9  hours of 
removal of the popliteal sciatic block, the subject will not be eligible to enroll in the study.  
A total of approximately 242 subjects will be randomized 2:2:2:2:1:2 to 6 treatment arms , 
evaluating a range of 5 VX-150 dose levels as shown in Table 9-1.

Note: q12h dosing will be th rough 36 hours after the first  dose of study drug throughout the protocol . 
Randomization will be stratified by site and sex. To maintain the blind, all subjects will receive 
the same number of capsules  in a double- dummy design.  

Protocol VX1 8-150-104, Version  2.0 Page 19 of 51 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Subjects will report their pain on the NPRS at scheduled time points ( Table 3-2)  through 
48 hours after the first dose of s tudy drug. In addition, pain intensity will be recorded on the 
NPRS immediately before each administration of rescue medication. Subjects are encouraged to 
wait 90  minutes after the first dose of study drug to receive rescue medication, and subjects 
should generally not receive rescue medication unless their NPRS is ≥4. However, subjects may receive rescue medication at any time after the first dose of study drug per their request. The rescue medication will be ibuprofen (400 mg [oral] every 4 hours [q4h] a s needed [prn]).

Notes:  After removal of the popliteal sciatic block, a subject can be randomized once the subject requests the first 
dose of study drug for pain relief, and the subject’s pain is ≥4 on the NPRS and is moderate or severe on the 
VRS. VX -150 dose levels (Dose Level s 1 [highest], 2, 3, 4, and 5 [lowest]) are shown in  Table  9-1. To maintain 
the blind, all subjects will receive the same number of capsules.  
 
9.1.1  Screening 
Screening Visit assessments required before  the day of surgery are listed in  Table 3-1.  
Screening will occur within 28  days before administration of study drug; this includes the 
screening period before  surgery and the day of surgery (Day -1). The investigator (or an 
appropriate authorized designee at the study site) will obtain informed consent from each subject.  
To prepare for study participation, subjects will be instructed on the study restrictions 
(Section  9.4).  
9.1.1.1  Repetition of Screening Assessments  
Repetition of any screening assessment that did not meet eligibility criteria is not permitted, unless there is clear evidence of a laboratory error (e.g.,  hemolysis of sample).  

Protocol VX1 8-150-104, Version  2.0 Page 20 of 51 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   9.1.1.2  Rescreening  
Subjects who do not meet the eligibility criteria may not be rescreened, with the following 
exceptions:  
• Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but had an intercurrent illness (e.g.,  upper respiratory 
infect ion with fever) in the 5 days before the first study drug dose that was properly 
evaluated and which resolved fully 
• Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but were not able to obtain required documentation 
within the allotted screening window  
• Subjects w ho met all eligibility criteria but transiently (for personal reasons) are unable to 
commit to all study procedures  
Any subject who is rescreened for any of the exceptions listed above may have the screening 
window extended by 2 weeks before needing to undergo any rescreening assessments. If more than 35 days have elapsed from screening before first dose of study drug, all screening assessments need to be repeated.  
9.1.2  Treatment Period  
Treatment Period assessments are listed in  Table 3-2. The study will be conducted as described 
in Section  9.1. Dosing details are given in Section  9.6. 
If a subject has any clinically significant, study -related abnormalities at the conclusion of the 
scheduled inpatient portion of the study, the medical monitor (or authorized designee) will be notified, and the subject will be asked to remain in the clinical research unit (CRU) until such abnormalities resolve. If the subject is unable or unwilling to remain in the CRU, the medical monitor (or authorized designee) will be notified, and the investigator will make every effort to arrange follow -up evaluations at appropriate intervals to document the course of the 
abnormalities.  
9.1.3  Follow -up 
Subjects will have a Safety  Follow-up Phone Interview 7 (±  2) days after the last study drug dose 
for the purpose of collecting information on AEs, medications, and treatments and procedures. A 
visit will only be required if a clinical finding during the Treatment Period requires follow -up. 
9.1.4  Early Discontinuation 
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug dosing will remain under observation for at least 12  hours after the last dose of study drug, after which point they can be discharged from the 
CRU. If a subject has any clinically significant, study -related abnormalities, the medical monitor 
(or authorized designee) will be notified, and the subject will be asked to remain in the CRU until such abnormalities resolve. If the subject is unable or unwilling to remain in the CRU, the medical monitor (or authorized designee) will be notified, and the investigat or will make every 
effort to arrange follow -up evaluations at appropriate intervals to document the course of the 
abnormalities. See Section  9.8 for additional details on removal of subjects. 
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug dosing will complete the Safety Follow-up Phone Interview 7 (± 2) days after the last study drug dose for the purpose of collecting 
information on AEs, medications, and treatments and procedures. A visit will only be required if a clinical finding during the Treatment Period requires follow -up. 

Protocol VX1 8-150-104, Version  2.0 Page 21 of 51 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
An interactive voice response system (IXRS) will be used to assign subjects to treatment. The 
randomization code will be produced by Vertex Biostatistics or a qualified randomization vendor. The Vertex study biostatistician will review and approve the production of the final randomization list, which will be reviewed and approved by a designated unblinded biostatistician who is not a member of the study execution team.  
9.3 Rationale for Study Elements  
9.3.1  Study Design 
This is a Phase  2B randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose- ranging, parallel -group 
study to evaluate the effect of VX -150 on acute surgical pain. Bunionectomy is a 
well-established, multi-dose, surgical, acute pain model. A randomized, double-blind study 
design was selected to avoid observer bias and reduce symptoms or outcomes arising from the subjects’ knowledge of treatment. A range of VX -150 doses will be evaluated to help inform 
dose selection for Phase 3 studies. A parallel design is considered most appropriate given the acute nature of bunionectomy surgery.  
Following a standard study design, subjects will be randomized after removal of the popliteal 
sciatic block and after the subject’s pain meets the pain threshold criteria. The pain threshold criteria are designed to ensure subjects have sufficient pain to determine if the drug is effective. Ibuprofen was selected as the rescue medication because it is a commonly used, short -acting, 
standard -of-care treatment for acute pain.  
9.3.2  Study Drug Dose and Duration 
Five dose levels of VX -150 (Dose Level s 1 [highest], 2, 3, 4, and 5 [lowest]) will be evaluated  as 
shown in Table 9-1. The highest dose level ( Dose Level 1 [first dose 1500 mg, then 750 mg 
every 12 hours (q12h)]) will not exceed a maximum dose o f 2250 mg per day. The maximum 
dose has been selected on the basis of favorable safety and VRT -1207355 PK results after oral 
dosing with VX-150 in  
VX16 -150-103 (Study 103). Multiple oral doses up to 1750 mg qd VX-150 for 14 days have 
been evaluated and found to be safe and well tolerated. Additionally, the treatment duration is the same as in Study  103. 
The highest dose level (Dose Level 1 ) to be tested (2250 mg per day; first dose 1500 mg 
followed by doses of 750 mg q12h) was evaluated in Study 103 in subjects with acute pain following bunionectomy. After administration of the first dose of VX-150 on Day 1 and Day 2, the mean VRT -1207355 maximum observed concentration (C
max) of 4.95 µg/mL ( Day 1) and 
4.92 µg/mL (Day  2) exceeded the concentration resulting in 50% of the maximum inhibition 
(IC50) for inhibition of Na v1.8. The maximum concentrations for VRT-1207355 were reached 
approximately 5.58 hours after the first dose on Day 1 and 4.03 hours after the first dose on Day 2. A statistically significant treatment effect was observed at 24  hours following the first and 
second doses, favoring VX-150 compared to placebo. VX- 150 was generally well tolerated in 
these subjects without any significant safety concerns.  
9.3.3  Rationale for Study Assessments  
11-point (0  to 10) Numeric Pain Rating Scale: NPRSs are frequently used in bunionectomy 
studies and are recognized by the FDA as a valid pain intensity measure.
12 

Protocol VX1 8-150-104, Version  2.0 Page 22 of 51 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   4-point Verbal Categorical Rating Scale:  A VRS (none, mild, moderate, or severe) is included 
as part of the pain threshold inclusion criterion to ensure that all subjects are experiencing 
moderate or severe pain at baseline. Moderate or severe pain at baseline ensures subjects have sufficient pain to determine if the drug is effective.  
Double -stopwatch assessment: The double- stopwatch assessment is a standardized assessment 
for determining the onset of pain relief .
13, 14 The stopwatches are started at the time of the first 
dose. Subjects are told to stop the first watch when they first feel “perceptible pain relief,” and to stop the second watch when they first feel “meaningful pain relief.”

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   medication unless their NPRS is ≥4. However, subjects may receive rescue 
medication at any time after the first dose of study drug per their request.  
o The rescue medication will be ibuprofen (400 mg [oral] q4h prn).  
o A record will be kept  of all rescue medication use, and an unscheduled NPRS 
assessment will be completed immediately before each administration of rescue medication.  
9.4.2  Additional Dietary Restrictions  
• Subjects will abstain from all food and drink (except water) at least 4  hours before the 
screening serum chemistry assessment.  
• On Day 1, subjects will be on a clear liquid diet until 11 hours after removal of the popliteal 
sciatic block  (i.e., 2 hours after the end of the randomization window). Doses administered 
after the end of th e clear liquid diet period can be administered without regard to meal 
timings.  
9.5 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
• Subjects will abstain from all concomitant medications as described in Exclusion Criterion  14 and Table 9-2. 
• All opioid medications taken within 12 months of Screening Visit will be recorded with  
indication, route of administration, and start and stop dates of administration. 
• All medications taken from 14  days before the Screening Visit through the end of the study 
will be recorded with indication, route of administration, and start and stop dates of 
administration.  
• A female subject of childbearing potential using hormonal contraceptives does not need to 
stop taking hormonal contraceptives; however, they are not considered an approved form of 
contraception (Section 11.5.5.1).  
9.6 Administration  
Study drug will be administered as follows:  
• Doses for the 5 VX -150 treatment arms are shown in  Table 9-1. The total maximum daily

• VX-150 arms will receive a combination of VX-150 and VX-150 placebo capsules. 
• Placebo arm will receive only VX -150 placebo.  
• To maintain the blind, all subjects will receive the same number of capsules.  All subjects will 
receive 6 capsules for the first dose and 4 capsules for the remainder of the dosing period. 
Additional details on dispensing will be included in the Pharmacy Manual. 

Protocol VX1 8-150-104, Version  2.0 Page 25 of 51 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   • Study drug will be administered as described above, with the final dose of VX-150 or 
VX-150 placebo given 36 hours after the first dose. 
• Study drug will be administered orally with approximately 240 mL (8  fluid ounces) of water. 
• Subjects will swallow the study drug whole and will not chew the drug before swallowing. 
• Study drug must be administered following the food restrictions outlined in Section  9.4.2. 
9.7 Dose Modification for Toxicity  
If any unacceptable toxicity arises, individual subjects will discontinue dosing (Section 9.1.4).  
9.8 Removal of Subjects 
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request. Subjects may be 
withdrawn from study drug treatment at any time at the discretion of the investigator or Vertex for sa fety, behavior, noncompliance with study procedures, or administrative reasons. A subject 
who withdraws from study drug treatment will continue to be followed unless the subject withdraws consent.  
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit or participate in a scheduled phone call, 
reasonable effort will be made to contact the subject. In any circumstance, reasonable effort will be made to document subject outcome. The investigator will inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subje ct participate in a Safety Follow -up Phone Interview, if 
applicable (see Section  9.1.4) , and follow up with the subject regarding any unresolved AEs. 
If a subject withdraws consent for the study, no further assessments will be performed. Vertex may retain and continue using the study data and samples after the study ends and may use the samples and information in the development of the study compound, for other drugs and diagnostics, in publications and presentations, and for education purposes. If a subject withdraws 
from the study, the study data and samples collected will remain part of the study. A subject will 
not be able to request the withdrawal of his/her information from the study data. A subject may request destruction of the samples collected from him/her during the study as long as those samples can be identified as his/her samples.  
9.9 Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn for nonsafety reasons during the study drug treatment period(s) may be replaced at Vertex’s discretion.

Specifically, study drug will be stored at United States Pharmacopeia controlled room temperature in a securely locked, substantially constructed cabinet or other securely locked, substantially constructed enclosure. Access to study drug will be limited to prevent theft or diversion of the study drug. To ensure adequate records, all study drugs will be accounted for via the drug accountability forms as instructed by Vertex. Table 10-1 lists the storage conditions for the capsules. 
Table 10-1 Study Drug  
Drug Name  Dosing Form/Route  Dosage  How Supplied  
VX-150  Capsule/Oral  ≤2250  mg per day  Supplied as 250 -mg capsules  
VX-150 placebo  Capsule/Oral  None  Supplied as capsule  
 
10.4 Drug Accountability  
The pharmacist or designated study site staff will maintain information regarding the dates and 
amounts of (1) study drug received and (2) study drug dispensed to the subjects. These materials will be retained at the site according to instructions provided by Vertex or its designee. The study monitor will review study drug records and inventory throughout the study. If a site uses a site-specific Drug Accountability System and/or process, including processes associated with the 
destruction of returned materials, the process must be documented and approved by Vertex. The study monitor must review the drug accountability documentation on a regular basis. The study monitor will promptly communicate to Vertex any discrepancies he/she is unable to resolve with 
the site.  
10.5 Disposal, Return, or Retention of Unused Drug 
The study site staff or pharmacy personnel will retain all materials until th e study monitor has 
performed drug accountability. The investigator will ensure that the materials are destroyed in 
compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by Vertex. Destruction will be adequately documented. 
10.6 Compliance  
For study drug doses administered during the inpatient periods, doses will be administered under 
the direct supervision of the investigator or designee. A hand- and-mouth check will be done after 
each dose administrati on in the CRU to ensure 100% study treatment compliance. 
10.7 Blinding and Unblinding 
This is a double-blind study. 

Protocol VX1 8-150-104, Version  2.0 Page 27 of 51 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   10.7.1  Blinding 
All study personnel will be blinded to subject treatment assignments except for the following 
individuals:  
• Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject 
in the event of a life- threatening medical emergency  
• Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject and the fetus in the event of a pregnancy 
• Vertex Global Patient Safety (GPS) and Regulatory Affairs personnel to satisfy serious 
adverse event (SAE) processing and reporting regulations 
• External vendor (unblinded) statistician preparing the final (production) randomization list 
who is not part of t he study team  
• Vertex IXRS Management for IXRS oversight and system administration  
• Vertex Clinical Supply Chain  
• The bioanalytical contract research organization ( CRO ) laboratory/vendor personnel 
managed by Vertex Bioanalysis  
• The Vertex bioanalytical personnel responsible for reviewing raw data from the bioanalytical 
CRO, who is not a member of the Study Execution Team  (SET; the Vertex bioanalytical SET 
member will continue to be blinded) 
Vertex medical monitor may, for matters relating to safety, unblind individual subjects at any 
time.  
A Vertex Modeling & Simulations and Biomarker scientist may be unblinded to individual subject PK data for conducting PK/pharmacodynamic ( PD) analyses. In addition, a Vertex 
clinical pharmacologist will be partially unblinded  to help in management of the PK workspace 
and ensure that only the blinded PK dataset is being provided for preliminary analysis. These individuals will not be a member of the study team and  will not interact with the CRU or study 
personnel. No unblinded data or results of unblinded analyses will be shared with the CRU or with blinded Vertex personnel. Masked IDs will be used for PK and PK/PD analyses. All instances of unblinding by Vertex personnel will be documented. 
10.7.2  Unblinding 
At the initiation of the s tudy, study site personnel will be instructed on the method for breaking 
the blind. The unblinding method will be either a manual or electronic. 
Unblinding of the individual subject's treatment by the investigator will be limited to medical 
emergencies or urgent clinical situations in which knowledge of the subject's study treatment is 
necessary for clinical management. In such cases, investigators will use their best judgment as to whether to unblind without first attempting to contact the medical monitor to discuss and agree 
to the need for unblinding. If investigators deem it not necessary to unblind immediately, they will first attempt to contact the medical monitor to discuss and agree to the need for unblinding. If investigators have tried but are unable to reach the medical monitor, they will use their best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the clinical situation, and may proceed with unblinding without having successfully reached and discussed the situation with the medical 

Protocol VX1 8-150-104, Version  2.0 Page 28 of 51 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   monitor. In case of emergency, the investigator will have the final decision and unilateral right 
for unblinding. 
Contact information for the medical monitor (or appropriate backup) will be provided in a 
separate document.  
In addition, the Vertex Medical Information Call Center  will answer calls 
24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days of the year, and will triage these calls to the study medical monitor or appropriate backup. 
If a subject's treatment assignment has been unblinded for a medical emergency or urgent clinical 
situation, the medical monitor will be notified within 24  hours of the unblinding event. The 
reason and the date of the unblinding will be documented clearly in the subject's study file. Information about the tre atment assignment obtained from the unblinding will be maintained in a 
secure location with controlled access and will not be shared with the sponsor (Vertex), the CRO, or any site personnel (other than the physician treating the subject). In addition, the 
investigator will consider whether the clinical event that prompted unblinding will be considered an SAE, according to the regulatory definitions or criteria for SAEs, and if so, submit an SAE report to Vertex GPS or designee, per Section 13.1.2. 
Vertex GPS or designee will also unblind any SAE reports in compliance with regulatory 
reporting requirements. In addition, Vertex may, for matters relating to safety concerns, unblind individual subjects at any time.  
11 ASSESSMENTS 
The schedule of assessments is shown in Table 3-1 and  Table 3-2.  
11.1 Subject and Disease Characteristics  
Subject and disease characteristics include the following: demographics, medical history, height, 
and weight . 
11.2 Pharmacokinetics  
11.2.1  Blood Sampling  
For the evaluation of plasma concentrations of VRT -1207355 and VRT-1268114, blood samples 
will be collected as shown in Table 3-2.  
These samples may also be used for evaluations of rescue medication, VX-150, metabolites of 
VRT -1207355, analyses that provide information on the metabolic pathways used by or affected 
by VX -150 and VRT-1207355, and further evaluation of the bioanalytical method. 
All efforts will be made to obtain the PK samples at the exact nominal time relative to dosing. Acceptable windows for sampling time s are shown in Table 11-1. Samples collected outside of 
these acceptable windows will be considered protocol deviations. The following will be recorded accurately in the source document on days of PK blood sample collection: date and time of administration of each dose; date and time of the taking of each PK blood sample; and date and time of the last meal taken before each dose.

Sampling Time  Time From Scheduled Sampling Allowed  
Predose on Day  1 Any time before  first study drug dose on Day  1 
Predose on Day  2 -15 minutes  
From 1 up to 12  hours after study drug dosing  ±30 minutes  
 
11.2.2  Processing and Handling of Pharmacokinetic Samples  
Detailed procedures for the collection of blood samples and further procedures for processing 
and handling of samples for PK analysis will be provided in the PK Sample Handling Guidelines. The shipment address and assay laboratory contact information will be provided to the investigational site before initiation of the study.  
11.2.3  Bioanalysis 
Samples will be analyzed using a validated analytical method in compliance with Vertex or designee standard operating procedures. A description of the assay and validation data will be provided in separate reports. 
11.4 Efficacy  
Pain scales: After removal of the popliteal sciatic block, a subject can be randomized once the 
subject requests the first dose of study drug for pain relief, and the subject’s pain is ≥4 on the 
NPRS and is moderate or severe on the VR S. If a subject does not meet the NPRS and VRS 
criteria within 9  hours of removal of the popliteal sciatic block, the subject will not be eligible 
for the study. 
Subjects will report their pain on the NPRS at scheduled time points ( Table 3-2)  through 
48 hours after the first dose of study drug. In addition, pain intensity will be recorded on the 
NPRS scale immediately before each administration of rescue medication.  
When NPRS assessments coincide with collection of PK blood samples, the NPRS assessment will be performed first.  

Protocol VX1 8-150-104, Version  2.0 Page 30 of 51 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Double -stopwatch assessment: At the time of first dose, 2  stopwatches will be started: 1  labeled 
“perceptible pain relief” and the other labeled “meaningful pain relief.” Subjects will stop the 
“perceptible pain relief” stopwatch when/if they feel any pain relief at all and stop the “meaningful pain relief” stopwatch when/if they feel relief that is “meaningful” to them. If the subject does not stop both stopwatches by 6 hours after the first dose, or receives rescue medication, the stopwatches will be stopped.  
11.5 Safety  
Safety evaluations will include AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, clinical evaluation of vital 
signs, ECGs, and physical examinations (PEs). 
11.5.1  Adverse Events 
All AEs will be assessed, documented, and reported in accordance wit h ICH  GCP Guidelines. 
Section  13.1 outlines the definitions, collection periods, criteria, and procedures for 
documenting, grading, and reporting AE s. A separate document that details AE CRF completion 
guidelines for investigators as well as training will be provided.  
11.5.2  Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
At the Screening Visit, blood specimens will be collected for safety laboratory tests following at 
least a 4 -hour fast. Fasting is not required at other time points.  
Blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory assessments will be collected as shown in Table 3-1 and Table 3-2.  Laboratory test results that are abnormal and considered clinically 
significant will be reported as AEs (see Section  13.1).  
The safety laboratory test panels are shown in  Table 11-2.

a If urinalysis results are positive for protein or blood, microscopic examination of urine will be performed and 
results provided for leukocytes, erythrocytes, crystals, bacteria, and casts.  
b If blood urea nitrogen cannot be collected, urea may be substituted.  
Clinical laboratory assessments from screening will have no clinically significant findings that 
preclude participation in the study, as judged by the investigator, for a subject to receive study drug on Day 1. 
Additional Tests at Screening: The following additional tests will be performed during screening 
to assess eligibility:  
Serum follicle -stimulating hormone: Serum follicle -stimulating hormone will be tested at 
screening for female subjects who are suspected to be postmenopausal. For a subject to be considered  of non- childbearing potential, the serum follicle -stimulating hormone levels will be 
within the laboratories’ range for postmenopausal females. 
Pregnancy testing: All female subjects must have a Screening serum pregnancy test within 
7 days before Day  1. Female subjects of childbearing potential (as defined in Section  11.5.5.1), 
must also have a Day -1 urine pregnancy test. Both the pregnancy test at Screening and Day  -1 
must be negative to receive study drug.  
Drug and alcohol screening (Screening Visit and Day - 1): Opiates, methadone, cannabinoids, 
cocaine, amphetamines/methamphetamines, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines will be assessed by a urine test. Subjects may also undergo random urine drug screening and alcohol testing if 
deemed appropriate by the investigator. The drug test at Screening and Day  -1 must be negative 

Protocol VX1 8-150-104, Version  2.0 Page 32 of 51 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   for a subject to receive study drug. A positive drug screen for a known prescribed concomitant 
medication that is not otherwise exclusionary (e.g.,  benzodiazepines) will not disqualify subjects; 
however, marijuana will not be allowed. 
Additional evaluations: Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other 
times if judged to be clinically appropriate.  
With the exception of the Day -1 drug and alcohol tests and the pregnancy tests, only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used. Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local invest igator for management of urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value 
is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by the central laboratory as soon as possible after the investigator becomes aware of the abnormal resu lt. If it is not possible 
to send a timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g.,  the subject was hospitalized elsewhere), 
the investigator may base the assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value.  
11.5.3  Physical Examinations and Vital Signs  
A PE of all  body systems and vital signs assessment will be performed at screening and select 
study visits (Table 3-1 and Table 3-2) . At other visits, symptom- directed PEs and 
symptom- directed vital signs assessments can be performed at the discretion of the investigator 
or healthcare provider. 
A PE includes a review of t he following systems: head, neck, and thyroid; eyes, ears, nose, and 
throat (EENT); respiratory; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically indicated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in PEs will be reported as AEs.  
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature, pulse rate, and respiration rate. Vital signs will be assessed in the supine pos ition after the subject has been 
instructed to rest for at least 5  minutes. Vital signs will be performed before blood draws or ECG 
assessments.  
11.5.4  Electrocardiograms  
Standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout ( Table 3-1 and 
Table 3-2) . Additional standard 12- lead ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically 
indicated. The performance of all ECGs will adhere to the following guidelines: 
• The ECG will be done before any other procedures that may affect heart rate, such as blood 
draws.  
• The subject will be instructed to rest for at least 5  minutes before having an ECG. 
• The test should be performed in the supine position 
A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by the investigator and maintained 
with source documentation. Clinically significant ECG abnor malities occurring during the study 
through the Safety Follow-up Phone Interview will be recorded as AEs. 
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make comparisons to 
baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by  >60 msec from the baseline or an absolute 
QTcF value is ≥500 msec for any scheduled ECG, 2 additional ECGs will be performed approximately 2  to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either of the QTcF 

Protocol VX1 8-150-104, Version  2.0 Page 33 of 51 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value (>60 msec from baseline or 
≥500 msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from 2  successive 
ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement. A subject with a QTcF value ab ove the threshold value will discontinue dosing. 
11.5.5  Contraception and Pregnancy  
11.5.5.1  Contraception 
At this stage in the development of VX-150, study participation requires a commitment from the subject that he/she and subject's respective partner use 1 acceptable method of birth control 
listed in  Table 11-3 from the Screening Visit through 90 days after the last dose of study drug. 
Male subjects mus t also not donate sperm from the time of first study drug dose through 90 days 
after the last dose of study drug. Additional contraception requirements may need to be followed according to local regulations and/or requirements. 
The contraception requirement for the couple is waived for the following: 
• True abstinence for the subject, when this is consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle 
of the subject. True abstinence must be practiced from the Screening Visit through 90 days 
after the last dose of study drug. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
• If the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy). Infertility may be documented through 
examination of a semen specimen.  
• If the female is of non -childbearing potential. To be considered of non-childbearing potential, 
the female must meet at least 1 of the following criteria: 
o Postmenopausal: Amenorrheic for at least 2 years and a serum follicl e-stimulating 
hormone level within the laboratory's reference range for postmenopausal females 
o Documented bilateral oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy 
• Same sex relationships.  
Unique situations that may not fall within the above specifications may be discusse d with the 
sponsor’s medical monitor or designee on an individual basis.

hormonal contraceptives; however, they are not considered an approved form of contraception.  
11.5.5.2  Pregnancy  
Subjects will be counseled to inform the investigator of any pregnancy that occurs during study 
treatment and up to 90 days afte r the last dose of study drug. 
If a subject or the female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant while participating in the study, study drug will be permanently discontinued immediately. The investigator will notify the medical monitor and Vertex GPS within 24 hours of the site's knowledge of the subject's (or 
partner's) pregnancy using the Pregnancy Information Collection Form. 
If confirmed to be on active drug, the subject or partner will be followed for safety (adverse 
events) until the end of the pregnancy and similarly, the infant will be followed for 1 year after 
the birth, provided informed consent is obtained. A separate ICF will be provided to explain these follow- up activities. Pregnancy itself does not constitute an AE.  
12 STATISTICAL AND ANAL YTICAL PLANS  
12.1 Sample Size and Power  
The sample size calculation is based on the primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the time -weighted sum of the pain intensity difference 0 to 
24 hours after the first dose (SPID 24). The primary analysis of this endpoint is to detect if there 
is a significant dose -response relationship across VX-150 dose groups and placebo using the 
MCP -Mod (multiple comparison procedures with modeling techniques). Under MCP-Mod, a 

Protocol VX1 8-150-104, Version  2.0 Page 35 of 51 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   pre-specified c andidate set of 4 dose- response models (Linear, Emax, Logistic , and Sigmoid E max) 
is proposed. 
Assuming the maximum effect size compared to placebo is 0.7, 40 evaluable subjects in the 
placebo, VX-150 Dose Level 1 (highest), 2, 3, and 4 groups, and 20 evaluable subjects in VX-150 Dose Level 5 (lowest) group would provide approximately at least 88% power to detect a dose-response relationship from the candidate set with a 5% level of significance. In addition, 40 evaluable subjects per treatment group can provide at least 85% power to detect an effect size 
of 0.7 compared to placebo. In order to allow for withdrawal of up to 10% of randomized subjects, the study will enroll and randomize approximately 242 subjects in total. 
12.2 Analysis Sets  
Assignment of subjects to analysis sets will be performed before the clinical data lock for the 
study.  
The All Subjects Set is defined as all subjects who have been randomized or have received at least 1 dose of study drug. This analysis set will be used in subject listin gs and disposition 
summary table, unless otherwise specified. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) is defined as all randomized subjects who have received at least 
1 dose of study drug. The FAS is to be used in efficacy analyses in which subjects will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment group and not to the treatment they actually received.  
The Safety Set is defined as all subjects who have received at least 1 dose of study drug. The Safety Set is to be used for all safety analyses in which subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they received and not according to their randomized treatment group. 
The PK Set is defined as all subjects who have received at least 1 dose of study drug and for 
whom the primary PK data are considered to be suf ficient and interpretable.  
12.3 Statistical Analysis  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the dose-response relationship of VX-150 in treating acute pain following bunionectomy. 
This section presents a summary of the planned statistical analyses of efficacy and safety for this 
study. The Vertex Biometrics department or a designated CRO will analyze the data derived from this study. Statistical Analysis System Version 9.4 or higher and R Version 3.5.0 or higher will be used to generate all statistic al outputs (tables, figures, listings, and data sets). 
Statistical analysis and presentation details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for the study.  
12.3.1  General Considerations  
All individual subject data for all individual subjects randomized or exposed to study drug will 
be presented in data listings. Continuous data will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimum value (min), and maximum value (max). Categ orical data will be summarized using counts and percentages. 

Protocol VX1 8-150-104, Version  2.0 Page 36 of 51 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Baseline value, unless otherwise specified, will be defined as the most recent non- missing 
measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the initial administration of study 
drug. 
12.3.2  Backgr ound Characteristics  
12.3.2.1  Subject Disposition  
The disposition summary will be based on the All Subjects Set. 
The number and percentage of subjects in each of the following disposition categories will be 
summarized based on the FAS: completed treatment, prematurely discontinued the treatment and the reason for discontinuation, completed study, and prematurely discontinued study, with a breakdown of the reasons for discontinuation. 
12.3.2.2  Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
The following demographics and baseline c haracteristics will be summarized by treatment group 
based on the FAS: sex, age, race, ethnicity, weight, height, BMI, and pain intensity. 
No statistical tests will be carried out to evaluate any baseline imbalance between treatment 
groups. 
12.3.2.3  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications taken 14 days before the Screening Visit and up to the Safety Follow-up Phone 
Interview will be summarized by Preferred Name using the World Health Organization -Drug 
Dictionary (WHO -DD) for the FAS as frequency tables in 2 pa rts: 
Prior medication : Medication that started before the first dose of study drug, regardless of when 
dosing of the medication ended. 
Concomitant medication : Medication received at or after the first dose of study drug, 
medication that was received before initial dosing and continued after initial dosing of study 
drug, or medication with missing stop date. 
Medication that started before the first dose of study drug and continued after the first dose of 
study drug will be summarized as prior medication and separately as concomitant medication. Medications with a missing start date will be considered to have a start date before the first dose of study drug. 
12.3.2.4  Study Drug Exposure and Compliance  
Study drug will be administered to the subjects by site personnel at time points specified in 
Table 3-2 and as described in Section 9.6. All data collected during dispensation of study drug (i.e., time of intake and number of capsules taken) will be presented in data listings only. 
12.3.3  Efficacy Analysis  
Evaluation of the dose-response of the efficacy of VX-150 is the primary objective of this study. 
All efficacy endpoints will be analyzed based on the FAS. 
12.3.3.1  Analysis of Primary Variable  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the time -weighted sum of the pain intensity difference between 
VX-150 versus placebo as recorded on a N umeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) 0 to 24 hours 
(SPID 24) after the first dose. The primary efficacy analysis will be using the MCP -Mod 

Protocol VX1 8-150-104, Version  2.0 Page 37 of 51 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   approach to detect the dose-response relationship from a candidate set of 4 dose-response models 
(Linear, Emax, Logistic , and Sigmoid E max). Two -sided P  value for each dose-response model will 
be provided.  
Both MCP-Mod approach  in SPID24 between VX -150 and placebo 
will be based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. The model will include the time-
weighted sum of the pain intensity difference 0 to 24 hours (SPID24 ) after the first dose as the 
dependent variable, and treatment as a fixed effect, with adjustment for stratification factors, i.e., site and sex, and baseline pain as a covariate.  
Pain intensity scores that were collected within 4 hours after a dose of rescue medication will be taken as missing and will be imputed using the pre- rescue numerical pain rating scale. Missing 
values due to early withdrawal will be imputed using the last non- missing observation carried 
forward before the calculation of SPID24 values.  
 
12.3.3.2  Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Variables  
• Time -weighted sum of the pain intensity difference between VX-150 versus placebo as 
recorded on a NPRS 0 to 48 hours (SPID48 ) after the first dose:  analysis of this variable will 
be similar to the primary analysis.  
• Proportions of subjects with at least 30%, 50%, or 70% reduction in NPRS at 24 hours after 
the first dose of VX-150 versus placebo: This variable will be analyzed using the 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test, stratified by site and sex.  
• Time to onset of “confirmed perceptible pain relief” after the first dose of VX -150 versus 
placebo: This variable will be analyzed using Cox regression model. The model will include a covariate for treatment and adjustment for site and sex. Additionally, the Kaplan- Meier 
method will be used to produce graphical presentation of the survival curves by treatment group and to estimate survival rates by treatment group. 
• Time to onset of “meaningful pain relief” after the first dose of VX -150 versus placebo: The 
analysis of this variable will be similar to the analyses of time to onset of “perceptible pain relief .” 

Protocol VX1 8-150-104, Version  2.0 Page 38 of 51 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   12.3.4  Safety Analysis 
The overall safety profile of VX -150 will be assessed in terms of the following safety and 
tolerability endpoints: 
• Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
• Clinical laborato ry values (hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation studies, and urinalysis) 
• ECG outcomes 
• Vital signs  
Safety endpoints will be analyzed based on the Safety Set.  
All safety data will be presented in individual subject data listings.  
12.3.4.1  Adverse Events 
AEs will be coded according to MedDRA. The number and percentage of subjects experiencing 
an AE will be summarized by the MedDRA System Organ Class and Preferred Term  (PT), as 
well as by treatment group. AEs will be classified as pretreatment or treatment- emergent as 
follows:  
Pretreatment AEs  are defined as AEs that occurred  or worsened after signing the ICF up to the 
start of study dosing. 
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as AEs that occurred  or worsened on or after the start of 
drug dosing through the Safety Follow- up. Only TEAEs will be summarized in tables. All 
summaries  of TEAEs will be presented by severity of the AE and the relationship to the study 
drug. Some rules that will apply to the summarization of AEs are (1) a subject with multiple 
occurrences of the same AE or a continuing AE will only be counted once; (2) only the maximum severity level will be presented in the severity summary; and (3) only the worst 
relationship level will be  presented in the relationship summary. 
SAEs and AEs leading to death, dose interruption, and permanent discontinuation will be listed 
separately. All AEs through Safety Follow- up will be listed in an individual subject data listing, 
including pretreatment AEs.  
12.3.4.2  Clinical Laboratory Assessments

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   13 PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL,  REGULATORY, AND ADMI NISTRATIVE 
CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity 
Grading, and Reporting 
13.1.1  Adverse Events 
13.1.1.1  Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly occurring event or worsening of a pre-existing condition (e.g., increase in its severity or frequency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section 13.1.2.1. 
13.1.1.2  Clinically Significant Assessments 
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and 
those deemed to have clinically significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the abnormal test result alone (e.g.,  urinary tract  infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, 
the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g.,  bacteria in urine or decreased 
hemoglobin). 
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1  or more of 
the following: 
• Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment 
• Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  
• A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study 
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the 
study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by the investigator.  
A laboratory value that is Grade 4 will not automatically be an SAE. A Grade 4 laboratory value will be an SAE if the subject’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE.  
13.1.1.3  Documentation of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be collected from the time the ICF is signed until the following times: 
• For subjects who do not enroll: until time of screen failure (e.g., screen failure, withdrawal of 
consent) 
• For enrolled subjects who have a Safety Follow-up Phone Interview: through the Safety 
Follow-up Phone Interview 
• For enrolled subjects who do not have a Safety Follow-up Phone Interview, 9 days after the 
last dose of study drug. 

Protocol VX1 8-150-104, Version  2.0 Page 41 of 51 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each 
study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 
1 overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in the CRF and source document. AEs for subjects who are screened but not subsequently enrolled will be recorded only in the subject’s source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE:  
• Description of the event 
• Classification of “serious” or “nonserious” 
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable) 
• Severity  
• Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
• Actio n taken  
• Outcome  
• Concomitant medication or other treatment given  
13.1.1.4  Adverse Event Severity  
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed 
November 2017). AEs of CTCAE Grades  4 and 5 will be documented as “life- threatening.” The 
severity of an AE that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined according to the definitions in Table 13-1.  
Table 13-1 Grading of AE Severity  
Classification  Definition  
Mild (Grade  1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities  
Moderate (Grade  2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities  
Severe (Grade  3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities  
Life-threatening (Grade  4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death  
 
13.1.1.5  Adverse Event  Causality  
Every effort will be made by the investigator to assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories in  Table 13-2. 

Protocol VX1 8-150-104, Version  2.0 Page 42 of 51 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Table 13-2 Classifications for AE Causality 
Classification  Definition  
Related  There is an association between the event and the administration of investigational 
study drug, a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the investigational 
study drug and causes other than the investigational study drug have been ruled out, 
and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug.  
Possibly related  Ther e is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, such 
as characteristics  of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the subject’s medical record).  
 
13.1.1.6  Study Drug Action Taken  
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken 
will be classified according to the categories in  Table 13-3.  
Table 13-3 Classifications for Study Drug Action Taken With Regard to an AE 
Classification  Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
 
13.1.1.7  Adverse Event Outcome 
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories in  Table 13-4.  

Protocol VX1 8-150-104, Version  2.0 Page 43 of 51 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Table 13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE 
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or sy mptoms  
Recovered/resolved with 
sequelae  Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not recovered/not 
resolved (continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing  
Fatal  Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at least possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g.,  a subject lost to followup)  
 
13.1.1.8  Treatment Given  
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, surgery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE.  
13.1.2  Serious Adverse Events 
13.1.2.1  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  
• Fatal (death, regard less of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after 
participation and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study drug) 
• Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the  reaction as it 
occurred  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption 
of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed 
above (e.g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home)  
If a subject has a hospitalization or procedure (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospitalization or procedure was planned before the subject signed the ICF, the hospitalization or procedure will not be considered to 
indicate an SAE, unless an AE caused the hospitalization or procedure to be rescheduled sooner or to be prolonged relative to what was planned. In addition, hospitalizations clearly not associated with an AE (e.g.,  social hospitalization for purposes of respite care) will not be 
considered to indicate an SAE. 

Protocol VX1 8-150-104, Version  2.0 Page 44 of 51 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is ofte n used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious ,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above and  is usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations.  
13.1.2.2  Reporting and Documentation of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through the 
Safety Follow -up Phone Interview, regardless of causality, will be reported by the investigator to 
Vertex GPS within 24 hours of identification . In addition, all SAEs that occur after the Safety 
Follow-up Phone Interview and are considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24  hours of identification .  
For SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through the Safety Follow -up Phone Interview , the SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as 
well as to report follow -up information on previously reported events. Investigators are asked to 
report follow-up information as soon as it becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health authorities.  
Please send completed SAE Forms to Vertex GPS via:  
Email:  (preferred choice)  
Fax:   
For questions, contact telephone:  
SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow-up Phone Interview and are considered related to study 
drug(s) will be recorded on the Vertex Organized Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter 
referred to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by the investigator for relationship to the investigational study drug(s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study dru g(s) will be 
assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and report the outcome to Vertex using the SAE Form. 
13.1.2.3  Expedited Reporting and Investigator Safety Letters  
Vertex, as study sponsor, is responsible for reporting suspected, unexpected, serious adverse 
reactions (SUSARs) involving the study drug(s) to all regulatory authorities, IECs, and participating investigators in accordance with ICH Guidelines and/or local regulatory requirements, as applicable. In addition, Vertex, or authorized designee, will be responsible for the submission of safety letters to central IECs.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee to promptly notify the local IRB/IEC o f all 
unexpected serious adverse drug reactions involving risk to human subjects.

Written notification that includes the reason for the clinical study termination is required.  
13.2.8  End of Study  
The end of study is defined as t he last scheduled visit (or contact) of the last subject.  
13.3 Data Quality Assurance  
Vertex or its designated representative will conduct a study site visit to verify the qualifications 
of each investigator, inspect clinical study site facilities, and inform the investigator of responsibilities and procedures for ensuring adequate and correct study documentation. 

Protocol VX1 8-150-104, Version  2.0 Page 47 of 51 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated   The investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each subject. Study data for each enrolled subject will be entered into a CRF by study site personnel using a secure, validated, web -based electronic data capture (EDC) application. Vertex will have read -only 
access to site- entered clinical data in the EDC application.  
Instances of missing, discrepant, or uninterpretable data will be queried with the investigator for resolution. Any changes to study data will be made to the CRF and documented in an audit trail, which will be maintained within the clinical database.  
13.4 Monitoring  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed or approved by Vertex will be followed to comply with GCP Guidelines. On-site checking of the CRFs/SAE Forms for completeness and clarity, cross -checking with source docume nts, and clarification of administrative matters will be 
performed.  
The study will be monitored by Vertex or its designee. Monitoring will be done by personal visits from a representative of Vertex or designee (study site monitor), who will review the CRFs /SAE Forms and source documents. The study site monitor will ensure that the 
investigation is conducted according to the protocol design and regulatory requirements. 
13.5 Electronic Data Capture 
Vertex will provide the study sites with secure access to and training on the EDC application 
sufficient to permit study site personnel to enter or correct information in the CRFs on the subjects for which they are responsible.  
A CRF will be completed for each enrolled study subject. It is the investigator’s responsibil ity to 
ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and timeliness of the data reported in the subject’s 
CRF. Source documentation supporting the CRF data will indicate the subject’s participation in the study and will document the dates and details of study procedures, AEs, other observations, and subject status. 
The investigator, or designated representative, will complete the CRF as soon as possible after 
information is collected.  
The audit trail entry will show the user’s identification information and the date and time of any 
correction. The investigator will provide formal approval of all the information in the CRFs, including any changes made to them, to endorse the final submitted data for the subjects for whom the investigator is responsible.  
Vertex will retain the CRF data  and corresponding audit trails. A copy of the final archival CRF 
in the form of a compact disc (CD) or other electronic media will be placed in the investigator’s 
study file.

1.Introduction   
Stand & Move at Work is a two-arm group-randomized trial. Worksites (N = 24) of small to  
moderate size (20–50 employees enrolled; N=720 employees across the 24 sites) will be  
randomized to one of two interventions: (a) ​MOVE ​+, a multi-level behavioral intervention  
targeting increases in LPA at the worksite; or (b) ​STAND ​+, the multi-level ​MOVE ​+ intervention  
along with the installation of sit-stand workstations to allow workers to stand at their desks while  
working. Both worksite interventions are expected to reduce sitting and increase LPA over 12  
months and improve cardiometabolic risk and work performance outcomes. We hypothesize the  
effects to favor the ​STAND ​+ study arm because the additional sit-stand workstation  
enhancement will provide a robust environmental stimulus to reduce sitting and provide  
a unique catalyst for LPA in the workplace. The ​MOVE ​+ arm will receive sit-stand workstations  
at 12 months and both arms will be assessed for follow-up at 24 months.  
 
Primary Aim:   
To evaluate the relative efficacy of ​MOVE ​ and ​STAND ​+​MOVE ​ interventions on LPA and sitting  
behaviors over 12 months, with process measures at 3 months and maintenance measures at  
24 months. The ​STAND ​+​MOVE ​ intervention, relative to the MOVE intervention, will: (H1)  
increase LPA at work and (H2) reduce sitting time at work over 12 months. Additional process  
outcomes at 3 months and maintenance outcomes at 24 months will be collected.  
Secondary Aims:   
To evaluate the relative efficacy of ​MOVE ​ and ​STAND ​+​MOVE ​ interventions on cardiometabolic  
risk (composite measure of fasting glucose, insulin, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, and blood  
pressure) over 12 months, with additional follow-up to 24 months. The ​STAND ​+​MOVE  
intervention, relative to the ​MOVE ​ intervention, will (H3) lower cardiometabolic risk over 12  
months  
 
2.Study Organization  
The study was funded by the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health. The  
trial is managed collaboratively by the Principal Investigators (PI) at both study sites (i.e. Arizona  
State University and the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities).   
 
2.1 Study Setting  
Worksites will be enrolled in the greater Phoenix, AZ, USA and Minneapolis, MN, USA  
metropolitan regions. Twelve worksites will be randomized in each region. Selected worksites  
will be drawn from three distinct work sectors: higher education, industry/healthcare (e.g., law  
firms, health insurance providers), and government (e.g., state departments). Worksites will be  
equally selected in each sector across each region (n= 4/sector/region worksites).  
 
Each site will be responsible for recruiting participating worksites and participating individuals  
within the worksties. A single digit site ID will be incorporated as the first digit of the three digit  
worksite ID that each enrolling worksite will be assigned.  
 
2.2 Study Site Teams  
4 
SMW Study Manual of Procedures   
 
   
The PI of each site will be responsible for his own staff and will secure IRB approval prior to the  
start of the study team. A research coordinator at each site will work with the PI to ensure the  
study stays on the scheduled timeline, and that data collection and study activities are  
implemented according to study protocols.  
 
3.Training and Documentation  
All staff will complete IRB-required training, including human subjects, in advance of the study.  
In addition, all data collection staff will be trained on the collection of anthropometric and blood  
pressure measures. Phlebotomists collecting biospecimens (i.e. venous blood samples) will  
have completed all necessary training for the collection and handling of biospecimens.  
 
4.Worksite Enrollment Process  
The worksite enrollment process refers to the tasks that each site undertakes to initiate  
Worksite accrual, beginning with identifying potential worksites, screening and consenting,  
and randomizing.  
 
4.1. Identifying Potential Worksites  
We will recruit worksites that meet our inclusion criteria and then recruit individual  
employees within each of the worksites (see Section 5). We aim to recruit 24 small to moderate  
sized worksites across our two geographical areas – Phoenix, AZ and Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN  
(12 worksites in Arizona and 12 in Minnesota; see inclusion criteria in Section 4.3). Partnerships  
with large companies from our preliminary studies will be leveraged to help identify participating  
worksites, although we will avoid recruiting individual worksites that have been involved in our  
past studies. We will also leverage others in our professional networks, including individuals  
involved in workplace wellness, to help identify potential worksites.  In advance of the grant  
proposal, we garnered very strong and broad support from many employers and worksites of  
various sizes in both Arizona and Minnesota. We will be recruiting worksites from three different  
workplace sectors including academia, government, and healthcare to enable greater  
generalizability of study results.   
 
4.2. Timeline  
Participating worksites will be recruited as pairs within a single sector at each worksite utilizing a  
rolling recruitment method. We will also rotate the enrollment of sector pairs over the seasons of  
the full calendar year to help avoid seasonal effects, beginning with the first two pairs enrolled in  
January 2016 and the final two pairs enrolled in November 2016. Enrolling two pairs every other  
month will also alleviate logistical and labor burdens for recruitment, data collection, and  
intervention implementation.  
 
4.3. Worksite-level Inclusion Criteria  
Worksite level inclusion criteria include:  
(a)Size: small to moderate size worksite (20-60 employees)  
(b)Schedule: >80% of employees full-time  
5 
SMW Study Manual of Procedures   
 
   
(c)Occupation: seated office work, primarily computer- and telephone-based work, little  
movement or walking  
(d)Wellness environment: not currently undergoing a wellness program aimed at increasing  
activity at work  
(e)Workstations: willing to have sit-stand workstations installed at worksite  
(f)Willing to engage in worksite-level intervention activities  
(g)Willing to be randomized to either intervention condition  
 
4.4. Screening  
Worksites will be screened for eligibility by study questionnaires completed by worksite  
leadership and followed up with interviews by study personnel to verify eligibility. If a worksite  
meets the inclusion criteria, a general level of employee enthusiasm for the study will be  
assessed (see Section 4.4)  
 
 4.5. Employee Interest Survey  
At worksites where inclusion criteria have been met, an anonymous survey will be sent to  
employees to gauge interest in participating in a ​study looking to decrease sitting time and  
increase light-intensity activity at work (i.e. level of enthusiasm and likely participation)​, and  
additional questions to assess both  their physical workspace (whether the space could  
accommodate sit-stand desks)  and individual level questions (to determine generally whether  
the person would meet the individual level inclusion criteria).  
 
4.6. Memorandum of Understanding/Agreement to Participate  
Presuming a worksite has enough employee interest to move forward, a memorandum of  
understanding will be developed and signed by the worksite manager and study principal  
investigators to facilitate adherence to the study timeline and intervention.  As part of this  
process, both a study leader and study advocate(s) will be identified.  
 
5.Participant Enrollment Process  
This section details Participant enrollment, beginning with recruitment, screening and  
consenting, and randomizing.  
 
5.1. Town Hall Presentations   
All worksite employees will be invited to a Town Hall presentation(s) scheduled based on the  
suggestions of the worksite leader and/or advocates. Up to two town halls will be scheduled at  
any given worksite to allow for the greatest attendance. While in-person Town Halls are desired,  
electronic town halls will be made available as an option. For those unable to attend a Town  
Hall, al copy of the TownHall powerpoint presentation will also be provided. The purpose of the  
Town Hall meeting will be to allow the site PI to state the study goals, aims, methods,  
inclusion/exclusion criteria, and timeline.  Following the town hall, interested (or all, depending  
upon the preference of the worksite leader) employees will be emailed a description of the  
study, including a consent form, along with a link to complete the eligibility screener  
questionnaire.   
 
6 
SMW Study Manual of Procedures   
 
   
5.2. Participant-level Inclusion Criteria  
Participant eligibility criteria will be as follows:   
(a)18 years or older;   
(b)generally good health and able to safely reduce sitting and increase LPA;   
(c)working full-time on-site (i.e. 30+ hours and at least 4 days in the office per week);   
(d)not currently pregnant;  
(e)predominant worksite occupation being seated office work;   
(f)not currently using a sit-stand workstation at their primary desk location at work;   
(g)willing to have a sit-stand workstation installed at their desk; and   
(h)willing to be randomized to either study arm.  
 
5.3. Participant Eligibility Survey  
An online eligibility survey will be distributed to each worksite employee following the  
informational sessions. All eligible participants will be invited to schedule a 30-minute slot during  
an assessment morning held at the worksite.  
 
5.4. Consent  
Those who are eligible and choose to attend the baseline assessment visit will be sent a copy of  
the consent form will be sent in advance and reviewed in person prior to commencing the visit. If  
the participant agrees to take part, they will provide written consent. Note: Participants from  
Minnesota government worksites will also be asked to sign a Tennessen agreement.  
 
6.Randomization  
Randomization to either the ​STAND+ ​or ​MOVE ​+intervention arms of the trial will be at the level  
of the worksite. Randomization will be stratified on the three sectors nested within each of the  
two regions (Phoenix, AZ and Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN).Within each region, eligible worksites  
will be enrolled in pairs matched on sector, and each matched pair will be randomized so that  
one is randomized to receive the​ STAND ​+ intervention with the other receiving the ​MOVE ​+ 
intervention. This scheme will ensure a balanced design by both region and sector.   
 
Randomization will not occur until all four worksites in the recruitment wave (2 per region) have  
completed their baseline assessments. Therefore, a participant will be considered enrolled in  
the active intervention once they have consented, completed baseline assessments, and paired  
worksites have been randomized to study arm. Prior work by our research team has suggested  
that we should expect 40%–75% participation within the identified worksite, which based upon  
worksite size will approximate our target recruitment of N = 720 participants.  
 
7.Study Interventions  
7.1 Intervention Overview  
The ‘Stand & Move at Work’ interventions will be delivered over 12 months and is based upon  
both the social ecological framework and social cognitive theory principles. The intervention  
development team is comprised of behavioral scientists, exercise scientists, ergonomists, and  
worksite wellness coordinators. The primary behavioral target of the ​MOVE ​+intervention is to  
7 
SMW Study Manual of Procedures   
 
   
accumulate 30 min or more additional LPA each day. The primary behavioral target of the  
STAND ​+intervention is, in addition to the ​MOVE ​+ target, to increase time spent standing to 50%  
of desk-based time during the workday (e.g. standing for 3 h out of 6 total desk-hours per day).   
 
Our approach will target intervention strategies at the individual, social, environmental,  
and organizational levels.  
 
All intervention materials will be manualized into the Stand & Move at Work “Toolkit.” The toolkit  
will be distributed to each worksite prior to the intervention start date. It is expected that each  
worksite and/or sector may differ in the time, resources, space, and personnel available  
to dedicate to the implementation of the intervention. The Toolkit will therefore be comprised of  
both “required” strategies (i.e., strategies that are required to be implemented by worksite staff  
during the intervention period) and “optional” strategies (i.e., strategies that worksite  
staff are encouraged to implement as are appropriate given the worksite context). Additional  
strategies generated by the worksite staff will also be encouraged. This approach ensures  
uniformity of the delivered interventions across worksites and allows flexibility and autonomy  
among worksites. Actual implementation of intervention strategies will be closely monitored  
through quarterly worksite audits and worksite leader interviews.  
 
To help facilitate these changes within the worksite, trained research staff met with worksite  
advocates quarterly to discuss implementation strategies for the upcoming quarter, as well as  
successes and barriers of implementation of the previous quarter. The worksite leader holds a  
higher level management position to which the department, division or unit employees report.  
This person will not be required to implement changes but will voice support, encourage  
participation and approve policy changes. Worksite advocate(s) plays an active role with  
program participants and will work to implement the selected changes. Considered a primary  
contact to link worksite employees and management. Advocate characteristics include:  
outgoing, ability to connect and engage with others, regular interaction with staff, good  
communicators.   
 
7.2 Intervention Components  
7.2.1. Policy-level components.   
The intervention framework is highly dependent on the identification and engagement of  
worksite administrators and managers to enact policy-level workplace modifications,  
implement robust environmental changes (e.g., sit-stand workstations), and to model and  
promote behavior change. Therefore, a required item will be to identify a worksite leader and  
advocate(s). A leader is defined as a person holding a higher-level management position  
to which the department, division, or unit employees report. The primary role of this individual  
will be to provide higher-level support for intervention strategies to be implemented. Primary  
responsibilities will be to determine appropriate Toolkit items, encourage participation in  
worksite initiatives, and approve potential policy changes. An advocate is defined as a person  
who plays an active role with study participants and will work closely with the Stand & Move at  
Work study team to implement the selected changes. Advocates will be considered the primary  
8 
SMW Study Manual of Procedures   
 
   
contact to link worksite employees,management, and the study team. Primary responsibilities  
will include  
aiding the implementation of strategies agreed upon by higher-level management.  
Organizational changes will be reinforced by the distribution of four quarterly support emails  
sent by the leader to employees in the workgroup. Templates will be provided to minimally  
include: (a) support for the program and employee participation; (b) a brief review of  
the previous quarter progress; (c) commendation of individuals who have shown high levels of  
engagement; and (d) an outline of new intervention initiatives for the upcoming quarter. Leaders  
will also formally agree to allow employees up to 5 min breaks every hour. Shared leader and  
advocate responsibilities will include quarterly meetings with an experienced behavioral science  
research team member who will be the designated worksite coordinator throughout the  
study to review past progress and plan for the coming quarter using the Toolkit as a guide. The  
aim of the research team member is to facilitate the intervention by ensuring all materials and  
concepts are explained fully explained, it is not to actively lead the intervention. As  
such, all team members will have extensive knowledge of the Stand and Move Toolkit to provide  
the leaders and advocates with support. Successes and challenges from the previous quarter  
will be discussed and each worksite will be encouraged to implement a new strategy to  
maintain or potentially increase employee interest in the program. Similarly, all worksite leaders  
and advocates will be invited to join a monthly ​STAND ​+ and ​MOVE ​+ conference call with the  
study principal investigators. Thesewill serve several purposes: (a) to provide opportunities  
for other worksites to share and learn from other worksites within the same randomized study  
arm; (b) to document worksite participation, progress, and new strategies; and (c) to provide  
insight into the breadth and scale of the study to reinforce participation from a scientific and  
health-based perspective.  
 
7.2.2. Environment-level components.   
The primary environmental difference between the ​STAND ​+ and ​MOVE ​+ study arms will be the  
installation of a sit-stand workstation for the​ STAND ​+ arm only. The workstations will be  
installed by our trained research staff, as well as worksite-specific ergonomic and wellness  
professionals. The Ergotron sit-stand workstation Workfit-TL model (Ergotron, Inc., St. Paul,  
MN) has been selected because it is able to be retro-fitted for use with almost all workspaces,  
requires little or no installation as it is simply placed on the existing desk surface, is affordable  
relative to many alternatives, has more desk surface area then many alternatives on the market,  
it can be easily raised and lowered to a broad range of positions, and can accommodate one or  
two large computer monitors. The Workfit-TL transitions from seated to standing positions by  
holding two levers and providing minimal force. Prior to installation a workspace inventory will be  
conducted for each participant to identify any potential barriers to use such as overhead  
shelving, insufficient computer cabling, or fixed keyboard trays. To eliminate these barriers,  
overhead shelving will be moved by worksite facilities management, cable extenders added (if  
needed), and additional wireless keyboards will be provided to those with keyboard trays so that  
participants are not required to move their existing keyboards with each sit-stand transition. The  
same Ergotron Workfit-TL will be installed at the 12-month time point for all MOVE+arm  
participants. All participants will receive ergonomic instructions for both sitting and standing  
postures via the e-newsletter and will undergo a coaching session at the time of installation.  
9 
SMW Study Manual of Procedures   
 
   
Other required environmental changes will include a signage starter pack that is designed to (a)  
provide information about the behavior; (b) provide information on benefits of action (e.g.,  
benefit of taking the stairs); (c) encourage goal setting (e.g., “make this a standing meeting”;  
(d) provide general encouragement (e.g., “we stand for health”); (e) provide instruction (e.g.,  
walking routes around the office space);and (f) serve as visual cues. Signage will also  
demonstrate organizational support for the program and intent to change the cultural norm.  
Walking routes will be created for each worksite to reinforce the behavioral targets listed above.  
Typical routes will include alternative restrooms, centralized printing and trash can areas, and  
indoor and outdoor (if possible) perimeter routes. The distance per route and estimated  
number of steps will be provided on the signage. Advocates will be encouraged to place walking  
routes in communal and prominent areas throughout the worksite. All participants regardless of  
randomization will be provided with a footrest. The footrests will serve the following three  
purposes: (a) as a resting position for either foot while both seated and standing; (b) as  
a stretching aid (gastrocnemius and soleus); and (c) as a visual reminder regarding participation  
in the program. Leaders and advocates may also wish to implement additional optional  
environmental changes throughout the program via combined environmental, individual, and  
social strategies. For example, a prominent and interactive communal board to promote the  
Stand & Move at Work program (termed an “Ideaboard”) or implementing environmentally based  
worksite challenges (e.g., centralized printing only challenges). Ideaboard templates  
and example challenges will be provided in the Toolkit.   
 
7.2.3. Individual- and social-level components.   
An e-newsletter (The Insider) will provide a regular and direct medium for delivering individual-  
and social-level intervention content. The Insider will incorporate both individual (e.g.,  
goal-setting) and social elements (e.g., quizzes and worksite social announcements). The  
Insider will be sent weekly during the first month of the intervention to facilitate transition and  
encourage early engagement. During months 2–12, the Insider will be sent bi-weekly, and a  
total of 26 newsletters will be sent. See Table 2 for a list of Insider topics. The content has been  
developed and designed by behavioral scientists and worksite wellness professionals to target  
25 out of the 26 components of the behavioral taxonomy wheel. Motivational interviewing will be  
the only component not targeted, given the need for face-to-face interaction. The Insider will be  
coordinated with and reinforced by additional complementary organizational, environmental,  
and social components. Other individual level strategies will include a 1-on-1 coaching session  
to identify specific goals and behavior change strategies relating to the key intervention  
messages. Using a goal setting sheet, participants will be encouraged to record and display  
their goals within daily eyesight. Participants will also receive instructions regarding the  
deskbased ergonomic set up (both ​MOVE ​+ and​ STAND ​+). The ​STAND ​+ arm will receive  
specific instructions (guided by an experienced ergonomist) regarding their new sit-stand  
workstation set up. Key messages will include switching position regularly and gradually  
increasing standing or LPA time. Social strategies (i.e., formation of walking or stretching  
groups) may be endorsed by leaders via support emails, actively led by advocates, or promoted  
via additional signage and Ideaboard content. Due to the variation in worksite culture, job  
demands and environmental challenges, it is expected that new ideas and variations of the   
10 
SMW Study Manual of Procedures   
 
   
suggested Toolkit items will emerge. This will be discussed and documented during the  
quarterly meetings and quarterly audits. The required multi-level tactics show reinforcement of  
behavior change across the social-ecological spectrum, utilizing all aspects of the behavior  
change taxonomy wheel. This integrated approach shows promise for shifting the cultural norm  
within a workplace from reinforcing highly sedentary, seated behavior patterns to one where  
standing and moving is expected, rewarded, and celebrated. This cultural shift is necessary  
to produce sustainable, long lasting changes that are likely to impact health and well-being on a  
large scale.  
 
Both​ STAND ​+ and ​MOVE ​+ worksites received the same multi-component intervention toolkit  
targeting organizational, environmental, cultural, and social changes within the workplace.  
Examples organizational changes included: (a) installation of sit-stand workstations (b) quarterly  
support emails, (c) ergonomic support and (d) bi-weekly e-newsletters. Examples of  
Environmental changes included: walking routes, (b) signage, (c) waste and recycling bin  
reallocation, (d) use of centralized printing areas, (e) inviting stairways and an (g) ideaboard.  
Examples of cultural and social changes included (a) allowance of 5-min breaks every hour, (b)  
promotion of face-to-face interaction, rather than email, (c)  standing meetings, (d) walking  
meetings, (e) stretch breaks), (f) contests), and (g) social groups.   
 
7.3 Difference between Intervention Arms  
The primary study arm differences will be implemented at the environmental level with the  
provision of a sit-stand desk at the start of the intervention for the ​STAND ​+group only. This  
primary difference will require small adaptations to other intervention strategies. First, participant  
goals will differ per arm to reflect the different arm intervention goals (i.e., increasing standing  
and LPA time for ​STAND ​+ vs. increasing LPA only for ​MOVE ​+). All participants will be  
encouraged to adhere to a ‘30-min rule’, however, the meaning of this target rule will differ per  
arm. For the ​STAND ​+ group this will be communicated as achieving a 30:30-minute sit to stand  
ratio to ultimately replace half their sit time with a combination of standing and moving at work.  
For the MOVE+ group this will be communicated as replacing 30 min of sit time with an equal  
accumulation of moving more throughout the work day. The 1-on-1 sessions held at the start of  
the program will facilitate specific goal setting at the individual level to help achieve the  
‘30-minute rule’ per arm. Consequently, the strategies communicated during the 1-on-1 session  
and throughout the study duration will differ slightly per arm (see Table 3).  
 
Second, although the ​STAND ​+ and ​MOVE ​+ arms will be provided with an identical Stand &  
Move Toolkit and the same level of support to implement socio-ecological changes, it is likely  
that the application of the Toolkit will differ per arm to target the specific target intervention arm  
goals. Finally, in some instances, the e-newsletter topics will remain the same across arms but  
the content will be adjusted per arm to reduce contamination and ensure that information is  
specific to the intervention arm. For example, the ergonomically themed e-newsletter will include  
sit-stand desk information for the ​STAND ​+ group, however, the ​MOVE ​+ content will only include  
seated desk information. Stand & Move intervention support for ​STAND ​+ will cease following  
the 12-month assessment period. However, ​MOVE ​+ participants will receive a sit-stand desk  
and ergonomic advice at the 12-month time point, and after which no additional intervention  
11 
SMW Study Manual of Procedures   
 
   
support will continue post-installation. Both arms will still have access to the Toolkit during this  
follow-up period (12–24 months).  
 
8.Collecting Worksite Data  
Worksite level data will be collected in conjunction with in-person (or by phone as a last resort)  
Quarterly meetings held with each worksite. These meetings will be held at Baseline, prior to the  
start of the intervention, 3-months, 6-months, 9-months, and a final meeting at 12-months.   
Data collected at each of these time points will include:  
-Planned intervention activities  
-Completed intervention activities  
-Successes or barriers of intervention activities  
-Quarterly Audit Survey ​that asks about various organizational and individual level  
activities, events, resources, and facilities.  
 
9.Collecting Participant Data  
Participant level data will be collected in four time points, including baseline, 3-months,  
12-months, and 24-months. Participants will be scheduled for fasting visits held in the morning  
at their respective worksites. As two worksites will be recruited to start the intervention at the  
same time, with collection dates being within one week of each other, participants can opt to  
attend a visit at the other worksite.  
 
Data collected at the in-person fasting visit will include:  
-Blood pressure  
-Height (baseline only)  
-Weight  
-Pregnancy status (biologically females only)  
-Fasting venous blood draw  
An activPAL will be affixed to the right leg of each participant at the visit; this placement will be  
rescheduled if the participant will be out of the office for the majority of the upcoming week.   
Daily surveys will be administered in conjunction with the activPAL wear. These logs will assess  
both daily sleep and work times and be sent via Qualtrics each morning for seven days.  
 
Along with the in-person visit and activPAL wear, a main study survey will be sent out during  
each assessment period (baseline, 3-months, 12-months and 24-months). This survey will be  
used to collect demographic characteristics as well as information regarding sleep, diet, physical  
activity, and overall health.   
 
10. Measures  
All measurements will be taken at baseline and 12 months, with additional interim measurement  
at 3months and follow-up at 24 months.All questionnaires will be administered via Qualtrics  
(Salt Lake City, UT)

10.1 Blood Pressure  
Blood pressure will be measured with the Omron BP742 automated machine and the Omron  
HEM-RML30 cuff (Omron Healthcare Inc., Lake Forest, IL) three times following 5 min of quiet  
sitting, with 30 s in between each measurement. The lowest two measures of diastolic and  
systolic blood pressures will be averaged for final blood pressure values.  
 
10.2 Anthropometrics  
Standing height will be measured in centimeters (cm) using a portable height board (SECA).  
Prior to the height measurement the participant should remove his/her shoes. If the subject has  
a hair accessory or hairstyle that interferes with the measurement, she/he will be asked to  
remove the accessory or change her/his hairstyle (e.g. take out ponytail band) if possible (some  
hair styles/accessories are difficult to remove or costly to replace, and these styles may be left in  
place).   
(a)Participant must stand erect with his/her back towards the stadiometer. The weight of the  
participant must be evenly distributed on both feet and the arms hang freely by the sides  
of the body, palms facing the thighs. The participant should place the heels together,  
with both heels touching the base of the vertical board. The feet should point slightly  
outward, at about 60° angle. Note: If the subject has knock-knees, the feet are separated  
so that the medial borders of the knees are in contact but not overlapping.  
(b) The subject’s head should be positioned in the Frankfurt Horizontal plane. In this  
position an imaginary line can be drawn from the bottom of the eye socket (orbital  
margin) to the external opening of the ear (external auditory canal).  
(c)The heels, shoulder blades, buttocks, and back of the head should be against the  
vertical surface. Note: The heels, buttocks, scapulae, and posterior aspect of the  
cranium (head) of some subject cannot be place in one vertical plane while maintaining a  
reasonable natural stance. These subjects are positioned so that only the buttocks and  
the heels or the cranium are in contact with the vertical board.  
(d)The participant should be asked to inhale deeply and hold his/her breath, while  
maintaining the erect position and without altering the load on the heels. Reposition the  
head in the Frankfurt plane, if necessary. The moveable headboard should be brought  
onto the highest point of the head, with sufficient pressure to compress the hair.  
(e)If the participant is notably taller than the study staff member responsible for recording  
the reading, she/he should use a step stool to view the measurement.  
(f)The measurement is recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm. The measurement is called out by  
the measurer as follows: “height, 162.5” and repeated “162.5” as he/she writes down the  
number on the Anthropometry Form. The participant is asked to step away and then step  
back into the same position for a second measurement.  
(g)Repeat the process and record the second measurement in the ‘Trial B’ column of the  
height section of the Anthropometry Form.  
(h)If the first and second measurements differ by >1 cm repeat the measurements, a third  
measurement will be taken.   
Any conditions or situations, which occur to make the measurement undependable on the  
bottom of the form. (e.g. subject couldn’t or refused to comply with the removal of hair  
accessory, wouldn’t remove shoes, etc.) will be noted.   
13 
SMW Study Manual of Procedures   
 
   
 
Body weight will be measured in kilograms (kg) using a Tanita TBF-300A Total Body  
Composition Analyzer.  The Tanita scale also allows for the calculation of percent body fat  
utilizing bioelectrical impedance.All participants will be queried about the presence of any  
medical device that would be impacted by the small electrical current. Only weight measures will  
be taken for those endorsing the presence of such devices.  
(a)The participant will be asked to remove shoes, any coat or cardigan, and empty his/her  
pockets.  
(b)The participant will stand in the center of scale, facing away from the balance, holding  
the head up. Body weight must be evenly distributed on both feet and the participant  
must have his/her hands hanging freely at his/her sides (i.e. make sure participant is not  
holding on to anything).  
(c)Weight is measured and recorded to the nearest 0.1 kg.  
(d)The body fat percentage will be displayed after a short pause, and should be recorded.   
(e)Have the participant step off the scale, and then repeat steps a-d, and record the second  
weight/body fat percentage.  
(f) If the first and second measurements differ by > 0.2 kg repeat the measurements, a  
third measurement will be taken.  
Any conditions or situations, which occur to make the measurement undependable, should be  
noted on the bottom of the form​.  
 
10.3 ActivPAL  
Our primary outcomes, time spent sitting and LPA at work, will be assessed with the activPAL3  
micro accelerometer (PAL Technologies, Glasgow, United Kingdom) for seven consecutive days  
at each measurement time point. The activPAL will be waterproofed using medical grade  
adhesive covering and attached to the midline of the thigh using a breathable, hypoallergenic  
tape. This method allows for the monitor to be worn continuously for seven consecutive days  
without removing for bathing or other water-based activities (a valuable feature that reduces  
missing data). Additional adhesive dressing will be given to all participants for re-application as  
necessary. The primary outputs of the activPAL are time spent sitting, time spent upright, and  
time spent “stepping.” Participants concurrently will complete an online daily log where they will  
report their sleep/wake schedule and time arriving and departing their workplace. The daily logs  
will be used to filter time spent sitting and LPA during work hours. In addition, any uninterrupted  
sedentary bouts of more than 6 h that occur within reported wake times will be considered  
non-wear times and treated as missing data. Days with <10 h of monitor wear data or <4 hours  
of reported work time as monitor wear data will be excluded from analyses. Outcomes will be  
reported as a standardized 8 h workday to account for differences in total work time. Full details  
of activPAL initialization, wear, and download protocol are in Appendix 1.  
 
10.4 Venipuncture  
Participants will be instructed to fast for nine consecutive hours prior to each blood draw. Blood  
will be drawn from the antecubital vein into EDTA vacutainers, and plasma will be stored at  
−80C until analysis in batch. Samples from the Phoenix site will be shipped to UMN on dry ice  
periodically for batch-processing. Biomarker analyses will be conducted by the Advanced  
14 
SMW Study Manual of Procedures   
 
   
Research and Diagnostic Laboratory at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, using a  
Roche COBAS 6000 chemistry analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Plasma glucose  
will be measured by the hexokinase method (interassay CV = 1.3% at 97.2 mg/dL, 1.8% at  
223.3 mg/dL). Plasma HDL-C will be measured by the modified direct enzymatic approach  
(interassay CV = 3.2% at 27.0 mg/dL, 1.9% at 51.7 mg/dL). Plasma triglycerides  
will be measured with the GPO-Trinder kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN; interassay CV =  
2.0% at 112.4 mg/dL, 2.3% at 195.8mg/dL). Plasma insulin will be measured with a sandwich  
immunoassay using electrochemilumincescence (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN;  
interassay CV=3.1% at 121.2 pmol/L, 3.1% at 377.9 pmol/L).  
 
11.Data Management  
11.1 In-person Visit Data  
In person visit data, including anthropometrics, blood pressure,  and whether venous blood  
draws were successful will be collected on paper forms. These forms will be kept in secure,  
locked filing cabinets and entered into Qualtrics.   
 
11.2. Survey Data  
All survey data will be collected via Qualtrics. Qualtrics is a secure, web-based platform for  
designing, collecting, and securing survey data. All survey data will be stored on encrypted  
servers.  
 
11.3 ActivPAL Data  
ActivPAL data will be extracted and stored on secure study servers at each site. The University  
of Minnesota will upload this data to BOX for retrieval by ASU, who will be the primary site to  
compile, clean, and process this data.  
 
11.4 Data Integrity  
All clinical assessment data will be double entered. All blood data will be examined for  
computational value errors associated with out-of-range variables. All data will be examined for  
outliers and improbable values.  
 
12. Data Analysis Plan   
12.1 Data analysis.  
Threats to internal validity (e.g. contamination, envy) preclude randomization of individuals  
within the same worksite; hence, a group randomized trial is being conducted [54]. Such a trial  
involves randomization of worksites with members within a worksite being assigned to the same  
experimental condition. Hierarchical linear (or generalized linear) models will be used to provide  
valid estimates of the intervention effect and its variance (for generating the test of statistical  
significance). Because the number of sites is limited by feasibility, the asymptotic balance of all  
measured and unmeasured confounders is not applicable, and hence it is important to  
randomize worksites within small blocks (or pairs) of matched worksites with similar  
characteristics likely to affect the outcome measure. Because our goal is to enroll 12 worksites  
in the Phoenix area and 12 in the Minneapolis area, we will stratify the randomization scheme  
15 
SMW Study Manual of Procedures   
 
   
on geographical location so that we will not have any confounding by geographical location (AZ  
vs. MN). We will identify six pairs of sites in AZ and six pairs in MN, with the pair members  
having the same sector (academia, government, or healthcare/industry). Each pair will be  
randomized so that one worksite in each pair is assigned to the ​MOVE ​+ intervention and the  
other in that pair assigned to the ​STAND ​+intervention. One of the site PIs and a Biostatistician  
at the University of Minnesota will be responsible for the randomization. Randomization will  
occur immediately following the baseline data collection for both sites. The PI will notify the  
biostatistician when there are two matched worksites ready for randomization. The two  
worksites will be ordered as “First” and “Second” depending on the calendar dates of the  
baseline data collection. The statistician, with no knowledge of the worksites, will use a coin flip  
to assign the two worksites to the ​STAND ​+ or ​MOVE ​+ interventions. Initial analyses will provide  
descriptions of the baseline frequencies and means (SD) of characteristics by worksite and by  
experimental condition. Statistical testing of differences in baseline characteristics is not  
necessary, but will provide assurance that the randomization has not produced a grossly  
unbalanced assignment. If the distributions of our outcome variables are not normally  
distributed, we will log-transform the outcome data. Our primary hypotheses will be tested by  
invoking a repeated-measures hierarchical linear model of the experimental contrast between  
the two conditions of the 12-month measure of LPA (min/ 8-h) and sitting (min/8-h), respectively.  
Because total time is standardized to 8 h, we will also express our outcomes in percent of time  
in LPA and sitting. A repeated measures hierarchical analysis will be conducted. The covariates  
expected to include are age, sex, body mass index, and the baseline values of the dependent  
variables (e.g., sitting time, LPA, and metabolic risk score). The resulting estimate and its  
standard error provide a t-statistic based on 2(g-1) degrees of freedom (df), where g represents  
the number of worksites per experimental condition [54]. A similar analysis will examine the  
secondary hypothesis for the metabolic risk score. Other outcomes, including sit-stand  
transitions, will use hierarchical generalized linear models with a log link. The analysis approach  
for process (3 month) and maintenance (24 month) outcomes will be similar. In terms of missing  
data, sensitivity to member-dropout is small; if on average only 85% are followed, the detectable  
effect sizes increase by a factor 1.05. Worksite dropout would be a major threat to validity, but  
that is highly unlikely to occur. Baseline characteristics of those not providing follow-up data will  
be examined to assess whether these are non-informative missingness. Under the assumption  
that dropout is not related to the measures that would have been collected, the analysis of the  
data excluding dropouts is unbiased.  
 
12.2 Power Analysis   
We aim to enroll 24 worksites (N=12 per condition) evenly distributed across Arizona and  
Minnesota with on average 30 employees per worksite (Total N members = 720 employees). In  
a baseline-adjusted analysis, let D represent the minimal detectable intervention effect, g the  
number of worksites per experimental condition, m the average number of members per  
worksite, S​2 ​the member variance, T​2 ​the work-site level variance, r​m ​and r​g ​the member and  
work-site correlations over time respectively, and t(d,a/2) and t(d,p) the critical t-statistic values  
based on d df for a/2=Type I alpha level (2-sided) and p=power. Then the minimal detectable  
difference is ​D ​2 ​= (t(d,a/2) + t(d,p)) ​2 ​(S ​2 ​(1- r ​2m ​)/m+ T ​2 ​(1-r2 ​g ​))*2/g ​. Dividing by S​2 ​yields the  
square of the Effect Size (ES)​ ​and T​2​/S​2 ​is the variance components ratio (VCR). In the unlikely  
16 
SMW Study Manual of Procedures   
 
   
situation where the g are unequal, replacing 2/g by (1/g​0​+1/g​1​) will lead to a minimal increase in  
D unless the g are grossly unequal. With g=12 (worksites per condition), d=22, and N=720,  
m=30; a/2 is set to 0.025 and power is set 80%. The detectable effect sizes for this trial range  
from 0.21 to 0.26 across the three outcomes, which are relatively small effects, and thus we are  
well powered in this study. On an absolute scale, as also shown in the table, we will be able to  
detect a difference between intervention arms as small as 12.2 min/8-hr work day of LPA and  
14.6 min/8-hr work day of sitting time. Our preliminary studies clearly demonstrate our ability to  
achieve these effects: (a) For LPA; the crossover study (12) showed a 38.4min/8-hr workday  
increase (other two studies did not target LPA or did not use a monitor designed to detect LPA);  
(b) for sitting, both the crossover and natural experiment showed >30min/8-hr workday  
reductions; and (c) for cardiometabolic risk, all 3 studies showed moderate to large effect sizes.  
This study is powered well to detect effects that are considerably smaller than what we have  
observed in our preliminary studies  
 
12. Adverse Event Reporting and Recording   
Adverse events will be monitored during the study to ensure timely detection of events that  
may affect safety or continued participation. Protocol defined adverse events, as well as any  
unanticipated adverse events deemed possibly or probably related to study procedure, must be  
immediately reported to the study PI and/or Project Coordinator. In the event an adverse event  
occurs, the PI will submit an adverse event report to the IRB within 24hrs.

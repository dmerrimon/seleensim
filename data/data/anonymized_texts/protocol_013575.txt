CONFIDENTIALAMENDMENT SUMMARY
This Protocol 2020-012-GLOB2 Amendmen t 3 replaces Protocol 2020-012-GLOB2
Amendment 2.  This amendment is considered to be substantial based on th e criteria set forth in 
Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC  of the European Parliament a nd the Council of the European 
Union.
The primary purpose of Amendment 3 is to provide notification that enrollment to study 2020-
012-GLOB2 has been halted based upon the strateg ic evaluation of the clinical development of 
surufatinib in the United States and Europe with HUTCHMED as the study Sponsor.  This change 
is not based on any concern for patient safety or efficacy relative to surufatinib treatment.  
Currently enrolled patients who are deriving clin ical benefit from treatment with surufatinib may 
continue to participate in the st udy as per the protocol.  There is no planned interruption in the 
supply of surufatinib to clinical trial sites with active patients. In addition, as no patients have 
enrolled in study Part 2 (dose expansion) as  of the end of enrollment date (16 December 2022),
Part 2 is removed from the study design in this protocol Amendment 3. Part 1 (dose escalation) 
will continue as outlined in this protocol ame ndment. The changes made in this amendment are 
described in the table below.  Editorial and formatting changes are not included in this summary.Details of changes made in prior amendments are summarized in Appendix 10.

Short Title A Study of Surufatinib in Combination with Gemcitabine in Pediatric,
Adolescent , and Young Adult Patients with Recurrent or Refractory Solid 
Tumors
Acronym Not applicable
Phase Phase 1/2
Study Status as of Protocol 
Amendment 3As of 16 December 2022, enrollment to study 2020-012-GLOB2 was halted
based upon the strategic evaluation of the clinical development of surufatinib in 
the United States andEurope with HUTCHMED as the study Sponsor.  This 
change is not based on any concern for patient safety or efficacy relative to 
surufatinib treatment.  Currently en rolled patients who are deriving clinical 
benefit from treatment with surufatinib may continue to participate in the study 
as per the protocol.  There is no planne d interruption in the supply of surufatinib 
to clinical trial sites with active patients. In addition, as no patients have enrolled 
in study Part 2 (dose expansion) as of the end of enrollment date, Part 2 is 
removed from the study design in this protocol Amendment 3. Part 1 (dose 
escalation) will continue as outlined in this protocol amendment. 
RationalePediatric patients with recurrent or re fractory solid tumors continue to 
experience dismal outcomes despite adva nces through much of pediatric 
oncology.  There is an unmet need for better treatments for pediatric patients 
with solid tumors. This study will be performed on pediatric patients with 
recurrent or refractory solid tumors wh o have no known curative therapy.
Although surufatinib monotherapy has shown clinical activity in adults with 
neuroendocrine tumors and in select adult cancer models, this study proposes that adding a chemotherapy agent in combination 
with surufatinib will provide 
added benefit for pediatric patients with re fractory/recurrent solid tumors.  Many 
current pediatric early phase studies combine an investigational agent with an 
irinotecan/temozolomide backbone both for anti -tumor effect and because of the 
tolera bility and non- overlapping toxicities of the irinotecan/temozolomide 
backbone.  However, irinotecan and temozolomide have shown limited effect in 
patients with osteosarcoma, a population of patients who may benefit most from 
a selective colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitor such as 
surufatinib.  Gemcitabine is a pyrimidine antimetabolite that inhibits tumor 
growth by disrupting deoxyribonucleic acid replication.  Gemcitabine has been 
used as salvage chemotherapy alone and in combination in pediatric patients 
with relapsed/refractory sarcomas, par ticularly in patients with osteosarcoma 
but also in those with Ewing sarcoma or rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS).  In p hase 
1testing of gemcitabine in pediatric patients, no maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD ) was reached, with only 1 in 6 patients experiencing Grade 4
myelosuppression when treated with 2100 mg/m2of gemcitabine once weekly 
for 2 weeks in 28-day cycles.
Target Population Pediatric, adolescent and youn g adult patients (age range ≥2 and <18 years of 
age for United States [US] sites, from birth to <18 years of age for European 
Union /United Kingdom [EU/UK] sites) with any recurrent or refractory solid 
tumors or lymphoma (not central nervous system) who have a known or 
expected dysfunction of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1, - 2, and -
3; fibroblast growth factor receptor 1, or CSF-1R pathways.  Patients must 
have had histologic verification of malignancy at original diagnosis or relapse.

Brief Summary:
The purpose of this study is to ev aluate the safety and tolerability of surufatinib, thereby identifying the MTD 
and/or RP2D of surufatinib administered in combination with gemcitabine in pediatric patients with recurrent or 
refractory solid tumors or lymphoma.
The study will evaluate tolerability and safety of surufatinib administered in combination with gemcitabine, and 
provide confirmation of the recommended clinical dose of surufatinib in pediatric patients with recurrent or 
refractory solid tumors
The study will enroll 2 to 6 patients per dose level cohort (up to 4 cohorts)  with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.
During cycle 1, surufatinib will be administered, orally, once daily (QD) , as a single agent for 14 days followed by 
surufatinib daily in combination with gemcitabine intravenously on days 15 and 22 (cycle 1 duration=35 days) and 
days 1 and 8 of all subsequent cycles (cycle duration=21 days).
Assessment based on dose limiting toxicity (DLT) criteria will be performed in the first 35-day cycl e (DLT 
Evaluation Period).  This study will utilize a rolling 6 design, with 3 dose escalation levels and 1 de- escalation 
level, if needed.
At the MTD/RP2D, a PK expansion cohort will be planned to ensure tha t up to 6 patients <12 years of age and 
6 patients ≥12 and <18 years of age have be en evaluated at the MTD/RP2D.

CONFIDENTIAL2 INTRODUCTION
2.1 Background
Relapsed and refractory solid tumors for which there are few effective treatment options are a 
significant source of morbidity and mortality in pediatric oncology. Surufatinib is a novel small 
molecule kinase inhibitor that modulates th e tumor microenvironment by inhibiting 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) while also tar geting tumor angiogenesis.  It selectively 
inhibits colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1, 2, and 3, and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR-1) ( Xu 2019 ).  In human 
tumor xenograft models of cancer in adults (gast ric cell carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma), it 
has potent anti-angiogenesis activity and impr oved kinase selectivity compared to earlier 
generations of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) ( Surufatinib Investigator’s 
Brochure [IB]).
Tumor associated macrophages in th e tumor microenvironment are well described cells that affect 
the ability of many solid tumors to evade the host immune system, and high levels of TAMs have 
been associated with poor prognoses in a variety of solid tumors ( Lewis 2006 ).  CSF-1R plays a 
critical role in signal transduction leading to th e differentiation and persistence of macrophages 
and is a known mediator that promotes TAMs within the microenvironment.  CSF-1R modulates differentiation, proliferation, and survival via PI 3K or the RAF/MEK/ERK pathways.  Regulation 
of cell adhesion and migration is modulated by the binding of CSF-1 to CSF-1R leading to 
phosphorylation of Focal Adhesion Kinase, which activates signaling, leading to cytoskeleton remodeling, adhesion, and migration.  The downstream effects of CSF-1/CSF-1R blockade produce an environment of decreased immune s uppression and increased interferon response, 
impeding tumor growth ( Osipov 2019). CSF-1R is expressed on a wide  range of solid tumor cells, 
including osteosarcoma, and its inhibition suppresses osteosarcoma tumor cell line proliferation and growth in mice ( Wen 2017 ).  CSF-1R inhibition sensitizes tumor cells to cytotoxic 
chemotherapy including cisplatin and trabectedin. 
CSF-1R is encoded by the c-fms proto-oncogene a nd is included as a relevant target in the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI)/Food and Drug Administrat ion (FDA) Molecular Target List for the RACE 
for Children Act.  CSF-1R has 2 know n ligands, CSF-1 and interleukin 34 (IL ‑34).  CSF-1 is 
produced by fibroblasts, endothelial cells, monocytes, macrophages, osteoblasts, microglia, 
keratinocytes, bone marrow stroma, NK cells, B cells, and T cells.  Physiologic roles of CSF-1include survival, proliferation, differentiation, an d motility of cells in the monocyte lineage, as 
well a bone remodeling by osteoclasts ( Rovida 2015 ,Achkova 2016 ). CSF-1R overexpression 
promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion of the nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line 6-10B
(Chen 2018 ). In osteosarcoma cell lines, overexpre ssion of CSF-1R enhances cell proliferation 
and accelerates cell growth, migration, and inva sion.  Silencing of CSF-1R by ribonucleic acid 
(RNA) interference suppresses proliferation and osteosarcoma tumor growth in mice ( Wen 2017 ).  
Xenograft mouse models using orthotopic osteosarco ma cell line and subcutaneous patient-derived 
xenografts, pexidartinib (kinase inhibitor targeti ng CSF-1R) treatment significantly inhibited local 
osteosarcoma tumor growth and lessened metastatic burden ( Smeester 2020 ).  Additionally, in
murine neuroblastoma models, CSF-1R inhibiti on in combination with cyclophosphamide and 
topotecan inhibited tumor growth and improved mouse survival ( Webb 2018 ).

CONFIDENTIALSmall molecule and monoclonal antibody CSF-1R inhi bitors are in clinical development both as 
monotherapy and in combination therapy (chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy) in adults with 
solid tumors and have demonstrated good tolerability ( Cannarile 2017 ). Pexidartinib is approved 
for the treatment of tenovial giant cell tumor in th e United States (US) and has also demonstrated 
clinical activity (response rate 5%) as a monotherapy  in a phase 2 study for relapsed or refractory 
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).  Although the efficacy of single agent PLX3397 in this study population was modest, the manageable safety profile and evidence of target inhibition may warrant further testing in combination therapy studies ( Moskowitz 2012 ). JNJ-40346527, a selective inhibitor of 
CSF-1R tyrosine kinase, has shown clinical activity  (1 patient with CR, 10 patients with stable 
disease [SD] of total 21 patients) in the phase 1 study for relapsed or refractory classical HL ( von 
Treskow 2013 ). Lastly, in a phase 1 study of AMG 820, an investigational fully human CSF-1R 
antibody in adult patients with relapsed or re fractory advanced solid tumors, AMG 820 was 
tolerated with manageable toxicities and clinical ac tivity was observed (objective response rate 
[ORR] 4%; clinical benefit rate [CBR] 24% in 25 patients) ( Papadopoulos 2017 ).
VEGF-mediated signaling plays a critical role in tumor growth by promoting angiogenesis, and 
high levels of VEGF expression are seen across a wide range of pediatric tumors, including 
neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma,  Wilms tumor, and rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), and 
are associated with recurrence and poorer prognoses ( Ghanem 2003 ,Eggert 2000 ,Gee 2005 ).
Additionally, solid tumors depe nd on vascular supply, and the inhibition of tyrosine kinases that 
promote tumor angiogenesis, including VEGFR s and FGFR-1, is a well described potential 
therapeutic target in patients in wide rangin g solid malignancies.  Demonstration of clinical 
activity of multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (MTK I) such as regorafenib and cabozantinib have 
re-vitalized interest in MTKI, including those with VEGFR inhibition in solid tumors in children.
2.1.1 Target Indication and Population
As of 16 December 2022, enrollment to study 2020-012-GLOB2 was halted based upon the
strategic evaluation of the clinical development of surufatinib in the United States and Europe with HUTCHMED as the study Sponsor.  This change is not based on any concern for patient safety or efficacy relative to surufatinib treatment.  Currently enrolled patients who are deriving clinical benefit from treatment with surufatinib may continue to participate in the study as per the protocol.  There is no planned interruption in the supply of surufatinib to clinical trial sites with active patients. In addition, as no patients have enro lled in study Part 2 (dose expansion) as of the 
end of enrollment date, Part 2 is removed from the study design in this protocol Amendment 3.  
Part 1 (dose escalation) will continue as outlined in this protocol amendment. 
Although outcomes in pediatric cancer have improved significantly in recent years, the prognosis 
is still poor for pediatric patients with recurren t, refractory, or metastatic disease.  There remains 
a need for more effective therapies for these patients.  The study will include pediatric,
adolescent, and young adult patients ≥2 and <18 years of age (for US sites) and from birth to <18 
years of age (for European Union/United Kingdom [EU/UK] sites) who have recurrent or 
refractory solid tumors or lymphoma with no known curative therapy.
2.1.2 Description of Gemcitabine
Gemcitabine inhibits cell cycles progression and acts as a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis 
inhibitor.  Gemcitabine PK is linear and is descri bed by a 2-compartment model.  Gemcitabine 
half-life (T
1/2) for short infusions (<70 minutes) ranged from 42 to 94 minutes, and the value for 
Clinical Study Protocol 2020-012-GLOB2 Surufatinib
Amendment 3
HUTCHMED Limited Page 31
CONFIDENTIALlong infusions varied from 245 to 638 minutes, de pending on age and gender, reflecting a greatly 
increased volume of distribution (V d) with longer infusions. The inactive metabolite of 
gemcitabine is excreted in the urine with 92% to  98% of the gemcitabine dose excreted in the urine 
within 1 week of administration.
2.1.3 Description of Surufatinib
Surufatinib is a novel TKI that inhibits VEGFR 1, 2, and 3, as well as FGFR-1, which results in 
inhibition of angiogenesis.  In addition, surufatinib inhibits signaling via CSF-1R, which is thought 
to down-regulate TAMs, thus promoting anti-tumor immunity.
2.1.3.1 Justification for Dosing Strategy
The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for surufatinib is 300 mg/day in adults. Surufatinib has 
not been studied in pediatric patients.  Th is study proposes to conduct a phase 1/2 study of 
surufatinib in combination with gemcitabine in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory solid 
tumors or lymphoma with no known curative ther apy. This dose finding study will use a rolling 
6d e s i g n( Simon 1989 ).
In adults receiving 200 to 350 mg per day of surufatinib, the T 1/2was 19.5 hours, and similar 
exposure accumulation was reached on days 14 and 28, indicating that a steady state was achieved 
on day 14 with the mean accumulation index of 1. 8- to 2.7-fold. The starting dose of 120 mg/m2
once daily (QD) surufatinib in pediatric patients will be 70% of the adult RP2D (300 mg for a 
70 kg adult=175 mg/m2) and will be dosed based on body surface area (BSA). Gemcitabine will 
be administered intravenously at a dose of 1000 mg/m2weekly × 2 doses, which has efficacy in 
pediatric sarcomas. Cycle 1 will aim to establish to lerability and safety and to obtain PK of 
surufatinib as a single agent and in combination with gemcitabine.
The proposed starting dose of 120 mg/m2surufatinib in pediatric patients is further supported by 
a model-based approach. Based on population PK model analysis, a 120 mg/m2dose is proposed 
for pediatric patients aged 2 to 5 years old and a 140 to 160 mg/m2dose is proposed for pediatric 
patients aged 5 to 18 years old. These proposed dosing regimens are predicted to result in 
surufatinib area under the plasma concentration-time curve at steady state (AUC ss) to fall within 
the target therapeutic exposure, derived from th e 10th to 90th percentile of surufatinib AUC ssafter
300 mg QD dosing that demonstrated efficacy in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), in 
more than 98% of the pediatric patients.
2.1.4 Supportive Nonclinical Data
2.1.4.1 Pharmacology
Surufatinib (HMPL-012, also previously known as sulfatinib) is a small molecule oral kinase 
inhibitor with selective and potent inhibition of CSF-1R (half maximal inhibitory concentration 
[IC 50] 4nM), VEGFR 1 (IC 502nM), VEGFR 2 (IC 5024nM), VEGFR 3 (IC 501nM), and FGFR-1
(IC 5015nM), with significantly weaker effect on other kinases such as PDGFR, c-KIT, and YES.
Consistent with its biochemical activity on kinase  insert domain receptor (KDR) kinase inhibition,
surufatinib demonstrated strong inhibitory activity on VEGF-stimulated phosphorylation of KDR in the HEK293-KDR engineered cell line, with an IC
50of 2 nM. In addition, the activation of 
KDR downstream signaling cascade pathways, including those of PI3K/AKT, 
Clinical Study Protocol 2020-012-GLOB2 Surufatinib
Amendment 3
HUTCHMED Limited Page 32
CONFIDENTIALRAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, and p38 were also inhibited in a dose-dependent ma nner. Furthermore, in 
functional assays using human umbilical vein e ndothelial cells (HUVECs), surufatinib inhibited
VEGF-dependent cell proliferation, with an IC 50of 16 nM, and inhibited 75% of HUVEC tube 
formation with at 0.3 μM. In the rat aortic ring model, suruf atinib inhibited vessel outgrowths of 
rat aortic rings in a dose-dependent manner with an IC 50of 192 nM.
Surufatinib has been evaluated for cytotoxicity in 11 human tumor cell lines and 3 normal human 
cell lines. Surufatinib showed a weak effect on cell survival with IC 50≥5μM, which was about 
300-fold less potent than the IC 50of surufatinib in a VEGF-depende nt anti-proliferation assay in 
HUVEC (16 nM), consistent with its good kinase selectivity.
The inhibitory effect of surufatinib on the phosphorylation of KDR, angiogenesis, and tumor 
growth have been evaluated in vivo. Upon stimulation with VEGF (intravenous [IV],
0.5μg/mouse), KDR phosphorylation (p-KDR) in the m ouse lung tissue was significantly induced. 
Surufatinib administered orally completely i nhibited VEGF-stimulated KDR phosphorylation for 
4 hours at 20 and 40 mg/kg and for 8 hours at 80 mg/k g, which suggest dose-dependent inhibition.
In this experiment, the drug exposure was deter mined. For instance, at 4 hours after oral 
administration of 20 mg/kg of surufatinib, the dr ug concentration in plasma reached 181 ng/mL 
(area under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC] for 20 mg/kg was 2720 ng∙h/mL). These 
data provided PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) correlation a nd the effective concentration for complete 
p-KDR inhibition (EC100=181 ng/mL) useful to guide clinical dose selection.
Surufatinib was further evaluated for anti-tumor activity and demonstrated high potency on 
inhibiting tumor growth in multiple human tumor xenografts, such as gastric cancer BGC-823,non-small cell lung cancer NCI-H460, human rena l cell carcinoma Caki-1, and colon cancer 
HT-29. Surufatinib was orally dosed at 20, 40, a nd 80 mg/kg twice daily and demonstrated a good 
dose response in these studies. Among the 4 models, gastric cancer BGC-823 showed the highest sensitivity to surufatinib. The tumor growth inhibition (TGI) achieved 68%, 90%, and 103% at 
20, 40, and 80 mg/kg, respectively.
The anti-angiogenesis effect of surufatinib in th e anti-tumor efficacy studies was investigated by 
detecting the changes of endothelial cell mark er CD31 (PECAM-1) in tumor tissue by 
immunohistochemistry technology. Surufatinib signifi cantly decreased the va scular vessel density 
(CD31) significantly in both NCI-H460 and Caki-1  xenografts. A clear dose-dependent inhibition 
of surufatinib on angiogenesis in Caki-1 xenogra ft tumor tissue was observed. The level of CD31 
inhibition appeared to correlate with the TGI.The plasma concentrations of surufatinib were analyzed in BGC-823 tumor bearing mice at the 
end of the efficacy study after the last dose. AUC increased with the increase of dose from 20 to 
80 mg/kg. The minimum efficacious dose was 20 mg/kg twice daily (TGI ≥58%, p<0.05) in the
BGC-823 model (TGI=68%), and th e corresponding minimum efficacious exposure, area under 
the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC
0-24h), in plasma was 
4712 ng∙h/mL. Surufatinib given orally at 80 mg/kg twice daily resulted in tumor regression with 
an AUC 0-24h of 16444 ng∙h/mL. PK/PD analysis indicated that at this dose complete p-KDR 
inhibition was maintained for more than 16 hours/day.
Safety Pharmacology:
In safety pharmacology studies, no adverse e ffects were observed on the cardiovascular and 
respiratory systems as evidenced by the results of a single dose study in anesthetized dogs (highest 
Clinical Study Protocol 2020-012-GLOB2 Surufatinib
Amendment 3
HUTCHMED Limited Page 33
CONFIDENTIALdose 60 mg/kg) and the collected electrocardiograms (ECGs) in a 13-week dog repeat-dose toxicity 
study (highest dose 12 mg/kg/day). The absence of findings on the cardiovascular system in vivo
is in-line with the in vitro human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) assay with an IC 50of1.8 μM, 
which is 46-fold above the clinical maximum plasma concentration (C max) (free) at a dose of 
300 mg, indicating a low risk for corrected QT interval(s) (QTc) prolongation. No effect was found on the central nervous system (CNS) in mice at the highest dose tested (400 mg/kg) based 
on the Irwin’s behavior grading and pole -climbing tests. Collectively, the results showed that 
surufatinib had a low risk of adverse effect s on the cardiovascular, respiratory and CNS.
2.1.4.2 Pharmacokinetics
After a single IV dose of 10 mg/kg surufatin ib in rats, the plasma elimination T
1/2of surufatinib 
was measured as 2.8 hours, and plasma clearance and apparent V dwere 3.53 L/h/kg and 13.1 L/kg, 
respectively. Following dosing via oral gavage at low, medium, and high dose levels, the mean 
value of time to reach maximum concentrati on was 3.0~4.2 hours. The oral bioavailability was 
observed to be dose dependent.  At the dose level of 10 mg/kg, the bioavailability was just 9.9%. 
When the dose was increased to 40 mg/kg or above, the bioavailability exceeded 50%. The low 
bioavailability observed at the low dose level might be associated with the efflux by P-glycoprotein(P-gp) in intestinal epithelial cells.
After a single IV dose of 5 mg/kg in dogs, the plasma elimination T
1/2was 3.3 hours, and plasma 
clearance and apparent V dwere 3.94 L/h/kg and 18.5 L/kg, respectively. Following a single oral 
dose of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg, the mean value of time to reach maximum concentration was 3.5 to
4.5 hours. In the dose range of 5 to 20 mg/kg, surufatinib exposure (C maxand area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve from time 0 to time t [AUC 0-t]) increased dose-proportionally. Feeding 
had no obvious effect on the extent and speed of surufatinib absorption. At the oral dose level of 
10 mg/kg, the absolute bioavailability was 30.5%.
After administration via oral gavage  in rats, surufatinib was distributed widely in various tissues 
mainly including lung, liver, spleen, adrenal gland, kidney, pancreas, and stomach wall. The 
lowest drug concentration was observed in brain , indicating poor brain blood penetration. At 
24 hours postdose, concentrations in most tissu es reduced to 10% or lower than the peak 
concentrations.
The results of [14C]-surufatinib excretion study revealed that surufatinib was mostly excreted via 
feces (approximately 80% of the dose, including 40% for bile excretion), and a small amount was
excreted via urine (approximately 10% of the dose).
In vitro liver microsomal metabolic stability assays in various species showed high liver extraction 
of surufatinib. The clearance of surufatinib in live r microsomes was higher in male rats than in 
female rats. No significant gender di fference was observed in other species. In an in vitro liver 
microsomes incubation study, phase 1 enzymes mediating the metabolism of surufatinib included cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4/5 (dehydrogenati on, N-demethylation), CYP2C8 (dehydrogenation, 
N-demethylation), CYP2E1 (mono-oxidization), and flavin-containing monooxygenase.
Surufatinib showed weak reversible inhibition against CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 with the IC
50of
13μM and 14 μM, respectively. Time-dependent inhibi tion study of CYP3A4/5 indicated the 
potential with a k inact[2] of 0.73 min-1and K I[2] of 163 μM. The results of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 
induction assay in primary human hepatocytes revealed that surufatinib did not significantly 
induce CYP1A2 at a concentration of 10 μM or CYP3A4 at a concentration of 2 μM.  In an in
Clinical Study Protocol 2020-012-GLOB2 Surufatinib
Amendment 3
HUTCHMED Limited Page 34
CONFIDENTIALvitro permeability and efflux transportation assay using Caco-2 cells, it was found that surufatinib 
might be a substrate of P-gp.
The protein binding rates of surufatinib were found to be 93~96% in plasma of various species, 
indicating a moderate to high extent of protein binding in plasma.
2.1.4.3 Toxicology
General Toxicology:  In single-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs, no mortality occurred up to 
the highest dose tested at 2000 mg/kg, indicating a good tolerability following single oral dosing.
Repeated-dose toxicity studies were carried out for surufatinib in rats (1-month, 3-month, and 6--month) and dogs (1-month, 3-month, and 9-mont h), respectively. The No-Observed-Adverse-
Effect Level (NOAEL) of surufatinib in the 13-week repeated-dose toxicity was 15 mg/kg/day and 6 mg/kg/day, respectively, in rats and dogs. The toxicokinetic results indicated that the exposures 
of surufatinib in rats at the NOAEL dose were higher than the exposures at a clinical dose of 300 mg in study 2015-012-00US1. In the repeated-dose toxicity studies, the main target organs were hepatobiliary system (increase of alkaline phosphatase [ALP], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], total bilirubin [TBIL] and triglyceride, along with hepatocyte degeneration/necrosis, slight hyperplasia of bile duct), kidney (increase of urea nitrogen and creatinine, diffuse degeneration a nd swelling of the glomerular capillary endothelial 
cell, hyaline cast), immune system (decrease of lymphocyte in thymus, spleen, and mesenteric 
lymph node, splenic white pulp atrophy), hemato poietic system (bone marrow hematopoietic cell 
decrease), skeletal system effects (chondrocyte hy perplasia and hypertrophy of growth plate with 
osteodysplasia and broken teeth), pancreas (acinus atrophy), adrenals glands, and uterus atrophy, and corpus luteum necrosis. All effects were fully or partially reversible after a 4-week recovery 
period apart from the effects on the skeletal system (broken teeth). Taken togeth er, it is worthwhile 
to note that at high doses surufatinib might cause kidney and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities. In addition, with extended dosing at lower/tolerated  doses, the lymphatic system might be affected. 
Therefore, during the initial dose escalation phase  in humans, attention should be paid to kidney 
and GI side effects. Adverse effects related to  lymphatic system should also be monitored for 
long-term use of surufatinib. Most adverse events (AEs) may be reduced or resolved by discontinuation of surufatinib treatment.
Genetic Toxicology:  Surufatinib was not genotox ic based on the results of a standard panel of in 
vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies comprised of an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay in 
Salmonella typhimurium (+/- S9), an in vitro chromosome aberration assay in Chinese hamster 
ovary cells (+/- S9), and an in vivo rat micronucleus  test with inclusion of an alkaline comet assay.
Reproductive and development toxicology:  In th e fertility and early embryonic development 
implantation study in rats with doses up to 45 mg/kg/day in males and up to 30 mg/kg/day in females, respectively, surufatinib at 30 mg/k g/day affected female reproductive function and 
embryo formation, and produced uterus damage. The NOAEL for male rat’s fertility and early 
embryonic development was established to be 45 mg/kg/day, and that for female rat’s fertility and early embryonic development was 10 mg/kg/day. In the embryo-fetal development study in rats at the top-dose of 15 mg/kg/day, mean maternal body weight gain decrease, an increase in post implantation loss, a reduction in gravid uterine we ight, and reductions in adjusted mean fetal body 
weight were noted. Developmental toxicities obse rved at 15 mg/kg/day consisted of fetal external 
malformations, visceral malformations, skeletal malf ormations and skeletal growth retardation. 
The NOAEL for both maternal toxicity and fetal development was 4 mg/kg/day. In the embryo-
Clinical Study Protocol 2020-012-GLOB2 Surufatinib
Amendment 3
HUTCHMED Limited Page 35
CONFIDENTIALfetal development study in rabbits, the dose of 48 mg/kg/day interfered with embryo formation 
and induced growth retardation, the NOAEL of surufatinib for maternal effects was 48 mg/kg/day, and the NOAEL for embryo- fetal toxic effects was 24 mg/kg/day.
In a range-finding juvenile toxicity study, rats were dosed from postnatal (PND) 4 to up to PND 28.
Mortality occurred at 10 and 30 mg/kg/day, but not at 3 mg/kg/day. No effects were noted on incisor eruption, developed teeth, or femur length.  In the definitive juvenile toxicity study with
surufatinib, rats were dosed from PND 10 to PND 70 at doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 3 mg/kg/day. No adverse findings were noted.
Phototoxicity: Surufatinib was not phototoxic ba sed on the results of a phototoxicity study in 
guinea pigs.
2.1.4.4 Nonclinical Studies for Surufatinib in Combination with Gemcitabine
The combination of surufatinib with gemcitabine offers a unique combination of cellular signaling 
inhibition (immune modulation and angiogenesis) and inhibition of tumor replicative pathways 
(perturbed DNA replication) with additive or synergistic potential.  A xenograft model of nude 
mice subcutaneously injected with HT-1080 cells  (human fibrosarcoma cell line) demonstrated 
additive to synergistic effects in TGI of surufatinib in combination with gemcitabine compared to either agent alone. In the anti-tumor efficacy st udy, surufatinib was administered 80 mg/kg/dose 
twice daily by oral gavage for consecutive 20 days, and gemcitabine was given once weekly at 3and 10 mg/kg/dose by IV injection for 3 times.
The results ( Figure 2) demonstrated that single agent trea tment of surufatinib 80 mg/kg/dose and 
gemcitabine 10 mg/kg/dose led to TGI rates of 64.0% and 61.9%, respectively, while their 
combination generated a TGI of 90.2%. The s tatistical significance was observed when 
combination treatment was compared with eith er surufatinib or gemcitabine monotherapy on 
tumor volume changes (p<0.01). Based on these mechanisms of action, the combination of 
surufatinib with gemcitabine is hypothesized to improve  the overall efficacy in patients versus 
monotherapy with either surufatinib or gemcitabine.
Surufatinib at a dose level of 80 mg/kg significan tly improved anti-tumor activity of gemcitabine 
at 10 mg/kg. The enhanced anti-tumor effect by combination treatment might ascribe to 
simultaneous inhibition of different cell type s as well as multiple pathways in tumor
microenvironments: gemcitabine killed tumor cells and surufatinib suppressed tumor angiogenesis 
and TAMs.
The TGIs of gemcitabine 3 and 10 mg/kg decreased from 54% and 84% at day 6 to 19% and 62% 
at day 20, respectively, suggesting a trend of em erging resistance to gemcitabine and consequently
also resulting in a gradually reduced anti-t umor efficacy by combination treatment.
The totality of the safety and efficacy data support  the investigational use of surufatinib combined 
with gemcitabine in pediatric patients with relapse d/refractory disease.  Th ese patients have little 
to no other treatment options and thus the overall  benefit risk profile favors investigation of the 
potential benefits of the combination. Refer to the IB for further information regarding surufatinib 
nonclinical studies.

2.1.5 Supportive Clinical Data
2.1.5.1 Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacokinetics
In Chinese patients with cancer, surufatinib was absorbed rapidly, with the concentration reaching 
maximum level after 1.0 to 2.0 hours of dosing.  Mean plasma T 1/2ranging from 14.9 to 20.2 hours 
was observed.  Following multiple doses of surufatin ib QD, the plasma surufatinib concentration 
reached steady state 14 days after dosing, with exposure accumulating 1.2- to 2.4-fold at steady 
state compared to day 1 (2009-012-00CH1 and 2014 -012-00CH1).  PK results from the US patient 
population (2015-012-00US1 [ongoing]) showed that s urufatinib exposure, in general, increased

2.1.5.2 Clinical Safety
2.1.5.3 Clinical Efficacy
Surufatinib has demonstrated statistically sign ificant and clinically meaningful efficacy in 
2 completed phase 3 randomized, double-blind, p lacebo-controlled studies in Chinese patients 
with advanced extra-pancreatic NET (SANET-ep) and patients with advanced pancreatic NET 
(SANET-p) and has shown promising anti-tum or activity in a US phase 1 study (2015-012-
00US1).  The SANET-ep study met its primary endpoint at the planned interim analysis, with 
significantly improved progression-free survival (PF S) in surufatinib-treated patients compared 
with placebo-treated patients (median PFS of 9.2 m onths in surufatinib-treated patients versus 
3.8 months in placebo-treated patients; HR 0.334; p<0.0001).  Similarly, surufatinib-treated 
patients in the SANET-p study showed a statis tically significant improvement in PFS compared 
with placebo-treated patients (median PFS of 10.9 m onths in surufatinib-treated patients versus 
3.7 months in placebo-treated patients; HR 0.491;  p=0.0011).  In addition to the primary PFS 
endpoint, SANET-ep and SANET-p demonstrat ed meaningful improvements in other important 
efficacy measures such as ORR, disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DoR), and time 
to response (TTR).CCI

HUTCHMED Limited Page 38
CONFIDENTIALIn Study 2015-012-00US1, patients with biliary tract cancer, extra-pancreatic neuroendocrine 
tumor (epNET), pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET), and soft tissue sarcoma (STS) were 
enrolled.  Based on interim analysis for epNET and pNET cohorts, the PFS rate at 11 months for 
patients with epNETs (16 patients) was 51.1%  (95% CI: 12.8, 80.3) and 57.4% (95% CI: 28.7, 
78.2) for patients with pNETs (16 patients).  The observed median PFS was 11.50 months (95% 
CI: 6.47, 11.50) and 15.18 months (95% CI: 5.19, Not reached [NR]) for patients with epNETs and pNETs, respectively.  An ORR of 6.3% was ob served for patients with epNETs and 18.8% for 
patients with pNETs.  A disease control rate  of 90.6% (95% CI: 75.0, 98.0) was observed for all 
NET patients (93.8% epNET; 87.5% pNET).  All pati ents had previously received everolimus 
and/or sunitinib ( Paulson 2021 ).  Enrollment to the STS cohort is ongoing, and no analysis has 
been performed to date.
2.1.6 Benefit/Risk Assessment
2.1.6.1 Risk Assessment
Overall, nonclinical and clinical study results have demonstrated that surufatinib is safe and well 
tolerated.  Surufatinib is administered orally while gemcitabine will be administered intravenously. 
Due to the IV administration of gemcitabine, there is the potential risk for pain and local irritation 
at the infusion site. This will be evident clin ically and can be treated symptomatically.  The 
collection of blood for PK sampling  may require additional IV access.
Due to the risk of fetal and teratogenic adverse effects as seen in anim al studies, pregnant or 
breastfeeding women will not be entered in this  study.  Males or females of reproductive potential 
may not participate unless they have agreed to use 2 effective methods of birth control, including a medically accepted barrier or contraceptive method (eg, male or female condom) for the duration 
of the study.  Abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control.  Both males and females with childbearing potential will be fully informed of th e lack of reproductive toxicity data, and females 
of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to enrollment.  Legal guardians 
of all participating children will be informed of the lack of reproductive toxicity data.
Identified risks for surufatinib are hepatic disorder, hemorrhage , hypertension, AKI, proteinuria, 
leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, GI symptoms, and hypothyroidism/thyroid stimulating 
hormone increased.  Table 3 presents important and non-important identified risks.
Risks for gemcitabine are hypersensitivity, myelosuppression, pulmonary toxicity, hemolytic uremic syndrome, hepatic toxicity, exacerbation of radiation therapy toxicity, capillary leak syndrome, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.

Surufatinib may have the potential to provide bene fit in the form of decreased tumor burden and/or 
a reduction in cancer-related symptoms in children, adolescents, and young adults with a variety 
of advanced solid malignancies who would othe rwise have no known curative treatment options.
2.1.6.3 Overall Benefit/Risk ConclusionThe main risk to participants in this study is drug toxicity.  This protocol involves greater than 
minimal risk to children, adolescents, and young adults but presents the potential for direct benefit to individual patients.  Potential side effects of surufatinib and gemcitabine are outlined in the protocol and in the IB. Patients on this study may di rectly benefit from participation.  Patients will 
have been judged to be incurable with standard and alternative therapies, which they are eligible 
to receive.  The intent of this study is to deter mine a safe and tolerable dose and ultimately to 
produce a therapeutic tumor response, which would offer the potential for direct benefit to 
individual patients.
As described, the study design aims to minimize potential risks and although the potential benefits 
in patients are unknown at this time, nonclinical a nd clinical data demonstrate evidence of anti-
tumor activity.  Thus, the benefit/risk assessment for this first time in children study appears 
acceptable for patients for whom there is no alternative standard therapy.
The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with International Council for Harmonisation 
(ICH)/Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable regulatory requirements.
2.2 Study Rationale
Pediatric patients with recurrent or  refractory solid tumors conti nue to experience dismal outcomes 
despite advances through much of pe diatric oncology.  There is an unm et need for better treatments 
for pediatric patients with solid tumors. This stud y will be performed on pediatric patients with 
recurrent or refractory solid tumors who have no known curative therapy.Although surufatinib monotherapy has shown clinical activity in adults with NET and in select 
adult cancer models, this study proposes that adding a chemotherapy agent in combination with surufatinib will provide added bene fit for pediatric patients with refractory/recurrent solid tumors.
Many current pediatric early phase studies combine an investigational agent with an 
irinotecan/temozolomide backbone both for anti-tum or effect and because of the tolerability and 
non-overlapping toxicities of the irinotecan/temozolomide backbone.  However, irinotecan and 
temozolomide have shown limited effect in pati ents with osteosarcoma, a population of patients 
who may benefit most from a CSF-1R inhibitor such as surufatinib.
2.2.1 Combination Therapy with Gemcitabine
Gemcitabine was chosen as the combination partner to surufatinib for pediatric development based 
upon 3 major factors: (1) well tolerated with a manageable toxicity profile, (2) minimal 
overlapping toxicities with surufatinib, and (3) dem onstrated activity in a multitude of tumors. An 
acceptable toxicity profile is a critical characteris tic in the proposed population of patients with 
relapsed/refractory pediatric malignancies, as these patients will have be en heavily pre-treated 
with resultant lingering toxicities such as limited bone marrow reserve. The tolerability profile 
Clinical Study Protocol 2020-012-GLOB2 Surufatinib
Amendment 3
HUTCHMED Limited Page 46
CONFIDENTIALpermits gemcitabine to be co-administered with targeted agents such as surufatinib.  Gemcitabine 
has been combined with other TKIs, specifically an tiangiogenic agents similar to surufatinib such 
as pazopanib, sunitinib, and axitinib, and shown to be both effective and safe ( Duska 2020 ,
Michaelson 2015 ,Park 2019 ).
Gemcitabine alone, in combination with cytotoxic agents and in combination with targeted agents,has demonstrated clinical benefit in patients with sarcoma.
Although gemcitabine has not been approved in the US or the EU/UK for the treatment of pediatric 
tumors, it is well known to be utilized in th e treatment of a variety of pediatric malignancies 
including soft tissue and bone sarcomas ( Pushpam 2020 ).  Several consensus guidelines for the 
treatment of sarcoma list gemcitabine (monotherapy or in combination) as treatment options: (1) 
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), (2) European Society for Medical 
Oncology –European Network for Rare Adult So lid Cancer (ESMO-EURACAN) Clinical 
Practice Guidelines, and (3) The Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy (SACT) database for sarcoma in 
the United Kingdom ( Dangoor 2016 ).
As a single agent, gemcitabine has modest activity in pediatric tumors.  In the pediatric phase 1 
study of gemcitabine involving 40 patients with di sease refractory to conventional therapy: 
1 patient with a pancreatic tumor achieved a par tial response (PR), 4 of 13 patients with osteogenic 
sarcoma had SD, and 1 of 4 patients with Ewings had SD for 17 months ( Reid 2004 ).  Despite low 
rates of objective responses, in the context of dis ease refractory to standard of care agents, SD is 
an indicator of anti-tumor activity in this heavily pre-treated patient population.
More recently, gemcitabine has been studied in comb ination with other cytotoxic agents such as 
docetaxel resulting in slightly increased anti-t umor activity.  In a phase 2 study of gemcitabine and 
docetaxel in patients with recurrent Ewing sa rcoma, osteosarcoma, or chondrosarcoma; PRs were 
observed in 1 of 14 patients with osteosarcoma, 2 of 14 patients with Ewing sarcoma, and 2 of 
25 patients with chondrosarcoma (Fox 2012 ).  The increased activity did however, come at a cost 
of increased toxicity.  Dose modifications for toxicity were required for 8 patients in cycles 1 and 16 patients in subsequent cycles.  Furthermore, 7 patients withdrew due to toxicity.
This observation of enhanced anti-tumor activity for the combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel 
counter balanced by increased toxicity was confirmed in a phase 2 study conducted in adults with 
soft tissue sarcoma (Maki 2007 ).  Patients were randomized to either combination therapy with 
gemcitabine and docetaxel or gemcitabine m onotherapy.  Objective responses (16% 
gemcitabine/docetaxel versus 8% gemcitabine) and median PFS (6.2 months gemcitabine/docetaxel versus 3.0 months gemcitab ine) were both found to be superior for the 
combination.  However, significant toxicity wa s higher for the combination; the posterior 
probability of the combination having a shorter time to discontinuation for toxicity compared to gemcitabine alone was 0.999.  The Investigators concluded that gemcitabine/docetaxel yields superior anti-tumor activity but with increased toxi city.  Notably, this safety profile was observed 
in patients who received only 0 to 3 prior lines of therapy.  One would expect to see a worse 
tolerability profile of the combination in a more  heavily pre-treated population, as is proposed in 
this initial pediatric study plan.
Gemcitabine has also been paired with targeted agents with encouraging results.  In a randomized 
phase 2 study in refractory soft tissue sarc oma, pazopanib + gemcitabine was shown to 
significantly improve PFS over pazopanib alone (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.36, 0.92; p=0.02) ( Schmoll
2021).  Similar results were reported in a populati on of 148 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer: 
Clinical Study Protocol 2020-012-GLOB2 Surufatinib
Amendment 3
HUTCHMED Limited Page 47
CONFIDENTIALmedian PFS was 5.3 months for pazopanib + ge mcitabine versus 2.9 months gemcitabine and 
overall response was also higher for the combination (20% versus 11%) ( Duska 2020 ). The PFS 
benefit was most pronounced for the subpopulation with platinum refractory disease (5.32 versus
2.33 months; p<0.001), which is potentially applicab le to pediatric patients who have been 
previously treated with platinum agents as part of standard of care. 
Furthermore, in a randomized phase 2 study of gemcitabine + pazopanib versus 
gemcitabine + docetaxel in patients with nonadipocy tic soft tissue sarcoma, similar response rates 
as well as median PFS were observed for both arms ( Somaiah 2021 ).  These data suggest 
gemcitabine combined with a targeted agent c ould potentially have similar efficacy as the 
combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel.  Of note, the combination of gemcitabine/pazopanib 
had a favorable safety profile: the rate of related Grade≥3 AEs was 82% for the 
gemcitabine/docetaxel arm and 78% for the gemcitabine/pazopanib.
Gemcitabine is a pyrimidine antimetabolite that inhibits tumor growth by disrupting DNA 
replication.  Gemcitabine has been used as salv age chemotherapy alone and in combination in 
pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory sarcomas , particularly in patients with osteosarcoma but 
also in those with Ewing sarcoma or RMS ( Mora 2009 ,Rapkin 2012 ).  In phase 1 testing of 
gemcitabine in pediatric patients, no maximum to lerated dose (MTD) was reached, with only 1 in 
6 patients experiencing Grade 4 myelosuppression when treated with 2100 mg/m2of gemcitabine 
once weekly for 2 weeks in 28-day cycle ( Reid 2004 ).  Gemcitabine has also been used safely in 
combination with nab-paclitaxel in pediatric patien ts with relapsed/refractory sarcomas at a dose 
of 1000 mg/m2using a 2-week dosing interval (Metts 2018 ).  In another example of gemcitabine 
in combination therapy, a recent Children’s  Oncology Group study (AHOD1221) combined 
gemcitabine with brentuximab and was well tolerated at a dose of 1000 mg/m2on days 1 and 8
(Cole 2018 ). Complete response (CR) was observed in 24 (57%) of 42 evaluable patients as well 
as 13 patients with PR or SD within the first 4 cycles of treatment ( Cole 2018 ).  Gemcitabine has 
also been combined with docetaxel and bevacizu mab in relapsed and refractory pediatric sarcoma 
patients and shown good tolerability and encouragi ng anti-tumor activity: 2 of 3 patients had a PR
and the third patient had SD for >6 months ( Higorani 2012 ). Lastly, gemcitabine combined with 
carboplatin and the CSF-1R inhibitor MCS110 is under active investigation in adults with triple 
negative breast cancer ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) ( Cannarile 2017 ).

CONFIDENTIAL4 STUDY DESIGN
Design of the study is presented in the study schematic (Figure 1 ).
Overall Design
This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1/2 study of surufatinib in combination with gemcitabine 
in pediatric, adolescent, and youn g adult patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.  This 
study design allows for dose escalation with intensiv e safety monitoring to ensure the safety of all 
patients.   This study will utilize a rolling 6 de sign, with 3 dose escalation levels and 1 de-escalation 
level, if needed.  The MTD and/or the RP2D will be designated in pediatrics.
4.1 Dose Escalation
This is a dose escalation study with sequential dos e escalation of surufatinib in combination with 
gemcitabine.  Patients with any recurrent or refractory solid tumors or lymphoma, who have a 
known or expected dysfunction of VEGFR-1, -2, a nd -3; FGFR-1; or CSF-1R pathways may be 
enrolled.  The first study cycle will be 35 days.  During cycle 1, surufatinib will be administered, 
orally, QD, as a single agent for 14 days followe d by surufatinib daily in combination with 
gemcitabine intravenously on days 15 and 22.  All subsequent cycles will be 21 days per cycle,
where surufatinib will be administered orally, QD, and gemcitabine administered intravenously on 
days 1 and 8.  The starting dose of surufatinib will be 120 mg/m2daily, which is approximately 
70% of the adult single agent RP2D of 175 mg/m2(300 mg/day normalized to standard adult BSA 
of 1.71 m2).  Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2weekly × 2 doses) will not be escalated and will be given 
on days 15 and 22 of cycle 1 and then on days 1 and 8 of all subsequent cycles.  Surufatinib will be given continuously on days 1 to 35 in cycle 1.  The first 14 days of cycle 1 serves to assess tolerability and toxicity of single agent surufatinib.
This study also includes a PK expansion cohort to be conducted at the presumed RP2D/MTD 
that is established in the dose escalation portion of the study. The PK expansion cohort will consist of up to 6 patients at each of the following 2 strata: patients <12 years of age and patients 12 to <18 years of age based on age at the time of enrollment. Surufatinib PK profiles after the 
first dose and at steady state will be characterized in both dose escalation cohort and PK expansion cohort. Patients who are treated at the RP2D/MTD in dose escalation cohort will be counted in the PK expansion cohort. For Spain only: No subjects will be allowed on the study with a BSA ≤0.6 or body weight ≤14 kg.
4.1.1 Dose Finding Period
The dose finding period, which is the timeframe to  define dose limiting toxicity (DLT), begins 
with the initial dose of surufatinib and ends on the last day of cycle 1. Should there be a delay 
(maximum 7 days delay) starting the subsequent cy cle, dose finding will complete on the start date 
of the subsequent cycle.Dose escalation and de-escalation rules:The study will utilize the rolling 6 design ( Skolnik 2008 ). Within a dose level cohort, up to 6
patients may be concurrently enrolled, accrual wi ll only be suspended when awaiting data from 6
patients.  Dose level assignment will be dete rmined based on the number of patients currently 
enrolled in the dose level, the number of DLTs ob served, and the number of evaluable patients at

CONFIDENTIALrisk for developing a DLT.  Dose escalation/ de-escalation rules are as follows, and in Table 5
below:
1. If 2 or more patients experience DLTs in dos e level 1 then the dose will be considered not 
tolerated and there will be a de-escalation to dose level -1.
2. If 2 or more patients experience DLTs in dose levels 2 or 3 then the dose will be considered 
not tolerated and the prior dose level will be considered the MTD and will become the 
RP2D.
3. If 3 patients are enrolled in a dose cohort with no DLTs, then the next patient enrolled will 
be enrolled in the subsequent dose level.
4. If toxicity data is not yet available for 1 or m ore of the first 3 patients, then the next patient 
enrolled will be enrolled at the same dose level.
5. If a patient is not evaluable (NE) for toxicit y, then they will be replaced in the same dose 
level with the next available patient.
6. The start of dosing in the subsequent cohort will not begin until the prior cohort has been 
evaluated and it has been determined that the MTD has not been exceeded.
7. There will be no intra-patient dose escalations.
8. The MTD/RP2D will be the dose level at wh ich less than one-third of evaluable patients 
(dose escalation and PK expansion cohorts) experience a DLT in cycle 1.  If the MTDdetermined in dose escalation cohort  is considered not tolerable, additional patients will be 
enrolled to the PK expansion cohort at the next lower dose level.

Safety monitoring and evaluation of dose escalati on will be carried out by the Safety Review 
Committee (SRC). The SRC will determine whether it  is safe to continue to the next predefined 
dose level, stay at the currently assigned dose level, or whether the dose should be de-escalated to 
a lower dose level and finally to determine th e MTD/RP2D. Additional details are outlined in 
Section 11.1.
At the MTD/RP2D, a PK expansion cohort will be planned to ensure that up to 6 patients <12 years 
of age and 6 patients ≥12 and <18 years of age have been evaluated at the MTD/RP2D. This will 
allow the study to explore further the safety, tolerability, and PK at this dose.
4.2 Definition of Dose Limiting Toxicity
Dose limiting toxicity will be defined as any of th e following events that are attributable to protocol 
therapy (at least possibly related).  Adverse events will be graded using the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. The NCI CTCAE provides 
descriptive terminology and a grading scale for each AE listed.
Any suspected or confirmed DLT is to be reporte d within 24 hours of learning of the event .  
Determination of a DLT will be made by the Investigator and the Sponsor’s monitor .  Patients 
who discontinue their study treatment for an y reason other than DLT (eg, early disease 
progression) during cycle 1 and have not received at least 80% (28 of total 35 doses) of the 
prescribed oral surufatinib dose and both doses of gemcitabine prior to discontinuation will be 
replaced with another patient at the same dose level.
Toxicity that is clearly and directly related to the primary disease or to another etiology is excluded 
from this definition.  The DLT monitoring and evaluation period for consideration of dose 
escalation/de-escalation will be the first cycle of tr eatment.  Should there be a delay (maximum 7 
days delay) starting the subsequent cycle, dose finding will complete on the start date of the 
subsequent cycle.  Toxicities with subsequent cycl es will be monitored, and if a significant number 
of delayed toxicities are observed, the Sponsor will  consider an amendment to include delayed 
toxicities in assessing the MTD.
Dose limiting hematological and non-hematological toxicity are defined differently.

4.3 Design Rationale
The dose finding study is designed to provide sa fety and tolerability data of surufatinib in 
combination with gemcitabine in pediatric patients.  Cycle 1 will aim to evaluate the tolerability,
safety, and PK profile of surufatinib as a single agent and in combination with gemcitabine.  The 
maximum dose of surufatinib will not exceed 300 mg/d ay in any arm of the study as it is the RP2D 
for adults.
This study will utilize a rolling 6 design with 3 do se escalation levels and 1 de-escalation level, if 
needed.  Surufatinib starting dose will be 120 mg/m2daily, which is approximately 70% of the 
adult single agent RP2D of 175 mg/m2(300 mg/day normalized to standard adult BSA of 1.71 m2).  
Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2weekly × 2 doses) will not be esca lated, and will be given on days 15 
and 22 of cycle 1, and then days 1 and 8 of all s ubsequent cycles.  Surufatinib will be given 
continuously on days 1 to 35 in cycle 1.  The first 14 days of cycle 1 serves to assess tolerability
and toxicity of single agent surufatinib. At MTD and/or RP2D, a PK expansion cohort will be 
planned to assure that up to 6 patients <12 years of age and 6 patients ≥12 and <18 years of age 
have been evaluated at the MTD/RP2D.The rolling 6 design allows for reduction of the overall study duration by decreasing the number 
of times that enrollment is suspended for toxicity ev aluation.   Toxicity will be assessed using the 
NCI CTCAE version 5.0, except for study sites in the US, for AST/ALT, grading in Appendix 8
will be used. Tumor assessments will be conduc ted according to Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria at screening, and throughout the study according the Schedule of Events outlined in Table 1 . Confirmation of CR and PR is required at no less than 
4-week intervals between the date of initia l response and the confirmation assessment date.

before starting study treatment.  Under no circum stances can there be exceptions to this rule. 
5.1 Recruitment
As of 16 December 2022, enrollment to study 2020-012-GLOB2 was halted based upon the 
strategic evaluation of the clinical development of surufatinib in the United States and Europe with
HUTCHMED as the study Sponsor. This change is not based on any concern for patient safety or 
efficacy relative to surufatinib treatment. Currently enrolled patients who are deriving clinical benefit from treatment with surufatin ib may continue to participate in  the study as per the protocol.  
There is no planned interruption in the supply of s urufatinib to clinical trial sites with active 
patients. In addition, as no patients have enrolled in  study Part 2 (dose expansion) as of the end of 
enrollment date, Part 2 is removed from the stud y design in this protocol Amendment 3.  Part 1 
will continue as outlined in this protocol amendment. 
This study will be offered to pediatric patients. Anticipated number of patients is as below:

CONFIDENTIAL11. Reproductive potential: Female patients must either be of nonreproductive potential or 
must have a negative serum pregnancy test upon study entry. Female patients of 
childbearing potential and male patients with pa rtners of childbearing potential agree to 
use a highly effective form(s) of contraception that results in a low failure rate (<1% per 
year) when used consistently and correctly, starting during the screening period, continuing 
throughout the entire study period, and for 6 months after taking the last dose of study drug. 
Such methods include oral, progestogen only, hormonal contraception (combined estrogen/progestogen should be avoided) or highly effective non-oral hormonal contraception (eg, Depo-Provera and Impl anon) associated with inhibition of ovulation 
together with a barrier method (eg, diaphragm, always containing a spermicide), intrauterine device, intrauterine hormone-rel easing system, bilateral tubal ligation, 
vasectomized partner, or sexual abstinence in li ne with the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the subject. Oral and non-oral hormonal contra ception should always be combined with 
an additional contraceptive method (ie, barr ier method) because of a potential interaction 
with the study drug. The same criteria are a pplicable to male patients involved in this 
clinical study if they have a partner of childbirth potential, and male patients must always use a condom. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is 
postmenarchal , has not reached a postmenopausal state (ie, ≥12continuous months of 
amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of the ovaries and/or uterus).
5.4 Exclusion Criteria
If a patient meets any of the following criteria, he or she is ineligible for this study:
1. Pregnancy or breastfeeding: Pregnant or breastfeeding females will not be entered into this 
study due to risks of fetal and teratogenic AEs as seen in animal toxicity studies.  Pregnancy 
tests must be obtained in females who are postmenarchal. 
2. Concomitant medications
a. Corticosteroids: patients receiving corticosteroids who have not been on a stable or 
decreasing dose of corticosteroid for at least 7 days prior to enrollment are not eligible (if used to modify immune AE s related to prior therapy, ≥14 days must have elap sed 
since last dose of corticosteroid).

evaluation.  All patients are to be evaluated ut ilizing contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest, 
abdomen, and pelvis, or other acceptable cross-se ctional imaging per RECIST version 1.1 (see 
Appendix 2).  Evaluations should include other areas of the body, as clinically indicated.  Disease 
status will be assessed by the Investigator or de signated site staff using RECIST version 1.1.  The 
same imaging procedure used to define measurable lesions at baseline must be used throughout 
the study for each patient, unless medically contraindicated.  At the I nvestigator’s discretion, other 
methods of assessment of measurable disease as per RECIST version 1.1 may be used. 
Tumor assessments completed as standard of care prior to signing the informed consent, but within
28 days of first dose of study treatment, may be used as baseline scans.

follow-up. Patients who decline to return to the si te for evaluations will be offered follow-up by 
phone as an alternative.
Any patient who permanently discontinues protocol treatment will be removed from protocol.
6.2.1.3 Withdrawal from Study
Patients are at any time free to withdraw from the study, without prejudice to further treatment 
(withdrawal of parental/guardian consent and/or pati ent assent).  Such patients will always be 
asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs.  If possible, they will be seen by an 
investigator and undergo the assessments and procedures scheduled for the post study assessment 
as in Table 1. Adverse events should be followed up for 30 days after study withdrawal as outlined

7.1 Surufatinib
7.1.1 Formulation, Storage, Preparation, and Handling
Surufatinib is formulated with
as  hard gelatin capsules, instrength sof
25and 50mg of surufatinib per capsule. The capsules are packaged in white high -density 
polyethylene (HDPE) bottles, which should be stored at temperatures between 10° to30°C (50° to 
86°F) and protected from light and moisture. For additional details refer to the IB.
7.1.2 Dosing and Administration
If baseline (predose) PK blood samples need to be collected on the days of PK sample collection, 
patients must take the invest igational product after sampling.
It is recommended that surufatinib capsule(s) be taken with approximately 240 mL water and with
a meal. The administration time should be accura tely recorded on the day of PK sampling. The 
dispersed suspensions in water can be prepared from the contents of both 25 and 50 mg capsules 
for pediatric patients that are unab le to swallow the whole capsules. Instructions for administration 
of surufatinib capsules in suspension are provided in the pharmacy manual.
Palatability is a key characteristic for accep tability of oral drug formulations and compliance, 
especially in children.  The taste and palatabili ty survey will be assessed in patients who have
taken surufatinib oral suspension (refer to Appendix 9 ).
On the day of PK sampling, patients should avoid high-fat, high-calorie meals for the entire day.
No caffeine containing foods or drinks, no grapefru it or grapefruit juice, tobacco and tobacco 
containing products, or alcohol or recreational drug s will be allowed during the PK assessment 
period (cycle 1).If vomiting occurs after dosing, the surufatinib dose should not be replaced. If patients miss a dose 
in the morning, a replacement dose can be taken if it is within 12 hours from the intended missed 
dose; otherwise, the patient should not make up th e missed dose, but resume schedule the following 
day. The missed dose should be reported to investigators and recorded in the CRF.

7.3 Dose Modifications
xFor any concomitant conditions already appare nt at baseline, the dose modifications will 
apply according to the corresponding shift in to xicity grade if the Investigator feels it is 
appropriate. For example, if a patient has Grade 1 asthenia at baseline that increases to

CONFIDENTIALGrade 2 during treatment, this will be consid ered a shift of 1 grade and treated as Grade 1
toxicity for dose modification purposes.
xNo dose reductions or interruptions will be  required for anemia (non-haemolytic) because 
it can be satisfactorily managed.
xTo recover from acute toxicity, unless otherw ise indicated, the treatment can be delayed 
for up to 14 days. If a treatment delay longer than 14 days is required, the patient should 
be discontinued from the study treatment.
xWhere several toxicities with different grades or severity occur at the same time, the dose 
modifications should be according to the highest grade observed.
Dose modifications apply to surufatinib only, and only 1 dose reduction of surufatinib is permitted
(refer to Table 7). Once the dose is reduced, it cannot be increased.  There will be no dose 
modifications for gemcitabine, but the dose of gemcitabine may be held for toxicity.

Patients may receive treatment with corticosteroids (for nausea/emesis).
Investigators may prescribe concomitant med ications or treatments (eg, acetaminophen and
diphenhydramine) deemed necessary to provide adequate prophylactic or supportive care.Other medication, which is considered nece ssary for the patient’s safety and well -being, may be 
given at the discretion of the Investigator and recorded in the appropriate sections of the eCRF.
Supportive care and other medications that are considered necessary for the patient’s well -being, 
may be given at the discretion of the Investig ator. This may include (but is not limited to) 
antibiotics, blood products, antiemetics, fluids, electrolytes, and general supportive care.
7.5.3 Drug-Drug Interactions
In vitro metabolism data indicate that CYP3A pl ays an important role in the metabolism of 
surufatinib.  The potential effects of medications  that can affect the PK of surufatinib via the 
CYP3A pathway have not been tested in the clinic.  Therefore, medications that are 
strong/moderate inhibitors or strong/moderate indu cers of CYP3A are prohibited and should not 
be administered 2 weeks or 5 half- lives (3 weeks for St John’s wort) before the study or 
concomitantly with surufatinib during the course of  the study.  Examples of these medications are 
listed in Appendix 4.
In vitro, surufatinib is shown to have the po tential to inhibit CYP3A, P-gp, and breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP) (refer to the IB).  Patien ts should avoid concomitant use of medications 
that are sensitive substrates or substrates with  narrow therapeutic windows of CYP3A, P-gp, or 
BCRP where possible.  If used together, patients  should be monitored more frequently for adverse 
reactions (ARs), and consider dose reduction of the CYP3A, P-gp, or BCRP substrate medication 
should occur.  Examples of the medications that are sensitive substrates and substrates with narrow 
therapeutic windows of CYP3A, P-gp, and BCRP are listed in Appendix 4.

CONFIDENTIAL8 SAFETY MONITORING
8.1 Definitions
8.1.1 Adverse Event
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal
relationship with this treatment. All AEs will be assessed according to the NCI CTCAE 
version 5.0 for severity or intensity.
Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory findings), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use 
of a study medication.
Any deterioration due to disease under study and associated symptoms or findings should not be 
regarded as an AE as long as the deterioration is  clearly due to disease and can be anticipated.
AE examples include, but are not limited to:
a. Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increased in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
b. Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication. For all reports of overdose (whether 
accidental or intentional) with an associated AE, the AE term should reflect the clinical symptoms or abnormal test result. An overdose without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results is reported using the terminology 
“accidental or intentional overdose without AE.”
c. Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiol ogical scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the 
medical and scientific judgement of the investigator.
d. New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.
e. Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction.f. Any new cancer (that is not a condition of the study). Progression of the cancer under 
study is not a reportable event.
An AE does not include:
a. Medical or surgical procedures (eg, pre-scheduled surgery, endoscopy, tooth 
extraction, transfusion).  The condition that leads to the procedure is an AE.
b. Anticipated day to day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) presented 
or detected prior to or at the start of investigational therapy that do not worsen.
c. Situations in which an untoward medica l occurrence (eg, hospitalization for an 
elective surgery, social, a nd/or convenience admissions).
The term AE is used generally to include any AE whether serious or non-serious.
Clinical Study Protocol 2020-012-GLOB2 Surufatinib
Amendment 3
HUTCHMED Limited Page 79
CONFIDENTIAL8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose during any study phase 
(ie, run-in, treatment, washout, follow-up), that results in any of the following outcomes:
xDeath
xImmediately life-threatening situation (patient is at immediate risk of death at the time of 
the event)
xInpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
xPersistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions
xCongenital abnormality or birth defect in the offspring of a patient
xImportant medical events that may not result in  death, be immediately life-threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered se rious when based upon appropriate medical 
judgement may jeopardize the patient and may re quire medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intens ive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse
8.1.3 Causality or Relatedness
The Investigator is required to provide an a ssessment of relationship of an AE and SAE to 
surufatinib and/or gemcitabine.  A number of factors should be considered in making this 
assessment including:
a. The temporal relationship of the event to the administration of study drugsb. Whether an alternative etiology has been identifiedc. Biological plausibilityd. Dechallenge (Positive dechallenge is a response observed for the reduction or 
disappearance of adverse drug reactions on withdrawal of a drug from a patient.)
e. Rechallenge (Positive rechal lenge: If the patient showed return of adverse effects 
after restart of a drug.)
The Investigator will assess causal relationship be tween investigational product and each AE, and 
answer “yes” or“noˮto the question: ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that 
the event may have been caused by the investigational product?’
For SAEs causal relationship will also be assesse d for other medication and study procedure.  Note 
that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied 
as ‘yes’.
The relationship to study drugs should be assessed using the following definitions:
a. Not related: A clear-cut alternative explan ation exists that the AE has an etiology 
other than study drugs (eg, preexisting condition, underlying disease, inter-current 
illness, or concomitant medication).
b. Related: There is a reasonable possibility that the product caused the treatment under 
investigation. In this definition, the phrase “a reas onable possibility” means that the 
relationship to study treatment cannot be ruled out. 
c. Adverse reaction (AR): An AR is any AE caused by a drug.
Clinical Study Protocol 2020-012-GLOB2 Surufatinib
Amendment 3
HUTCHMED Limited Page 80
CONFIDENTIALd. Suspected adverse reaction (SAR): An SAR is any AE for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. SAR implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than AR.
e. Unexpected: An event is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the IB, is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. Unexpected also refers to events that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the dru g but are not specifically mentioned as 
occurring with the particular drug under investigation.
f. Gemcitabine has been approved for marketing in the US and in the EU/UK. The
health authority approved prescription drug labeling is used as the basis for 
determining whether an event is unexpected for reporting purposes.
Ambiguous cases should be considered as being a “reasonable possibility” of a causal relationship 
unless further evidence becomes available to refut e this.  Causal relationship in cases where the

Embryotoxicity was characterized by decreased fe tal viability, reduced live litter sizes, and 
developmental delays.  It is not known whether gemcitabine or its metabolites are excreted in 
human milk.
8.3 Documenting Adverse Events
Adverse events will be collected throughout the study, from informed consent until 30 days after 
the last dose of protocol therapy (follow-up period).  The follow-up period is defined as 30 days 
after study treatment is discontinued.  SAEs o ccurring in the follow-up period should be reported 
to the regulatory authorities and Sponsor as delineated in Section 8.4.
8.3.1 Timeframe for Collection
Adverse events will be documented from the time of study enrollment through 30 days after the 
last day of study treatment. All AEs (irrespective of suspected causality) a nd SAEs must be followed until one of the following 
occurs:
xResolved or improved to baseline
xDeath
xStart of new anticancer medication
xInvestigator confirms that no further improvement can be expected
xClinical or safety data will no longer be collected, or final database closure
8.4 Reporting Adverse Events
8.4.1 Expedited Reporting Period 
Certain events require immediate reporting to allow the Sponsor to take appropriate measures to
address potential new risks in a clinical study.  The Investigator must report such events (both 
initial and follow-up) to the S ponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take 
place more than 24 hours after the Investigator learns of the event.
Serious adverse events (from informed consent to 30 days following the last dose of study 
treatment or initiating a new anti-tumor therapy) must report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after first learning of the event, regardle ss of relationship to study treatment.
8.4.2 All Serious Adverse Events and Protoco l-Defined Adverse Events of Special 
Interest
Investigators will submit reports of all SAEs and protocol-defined events of special interest, regardless of attribution, to the Sponsor or the S ponsor’s designee via fax or email within 24 hours
of learning of the events.
For initial SAEs and protocol-defined events of sp ecial interest reports, investigators should record 
all case details that can be gathered within 24 hours on a SAE reporting form. Relevant follow-up 
information should be submitted to the Sponsor or the Sponsor’s designee as soon as it becomes 
available and/or upon request within 24 hours of the I nvestigator’s awareness of the events.
Clinical Study Protocol 2020-012-GLOB2 Surufatinib
Amendment 3
HUTCHMED Limited Page 82
CONFIDENTIALInvestigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting SAEs to the local health 
authority and Independent Ethics Committee /Institutional Review Board (IEC/IRB).
8.4.2.1 Drug-Induced Liver Injury
Report all potential events of drug-induced liver inju ry (DILI), as defined below, regardless of 
whether it is a non-serious or serious AE to th e Sponsor no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event.
xSerum AST or ALT >3 × ULN t ogether with TBIL >2 × ULN.
This combination of lab abnormalities mee ts the biochemical criteria for Hy’s Law, which is 
associated with a markedly increased possibility  of severe DILI, and may progress to liver 
transplantation or death. Some patients may presen t with symptoms such as: fatigue, nausea, 
vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderne ss, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%). If the 
biochemical criteria for Hy’s Law is met, surufatinib should be immediately discontinued, and 
patients need to be very closely monitore d (bilirubin, ALP, AST, ALT measured 2 to 3 times 
weekly until the results return to baseline or nor mal), and other causes of liver injury evaluated 
(eg, new or worsening hepatobiliary metastases; non-malignant biliary obstruction; viral hepatitis 
A, B, or C; alcoholic or autoimmune hepatitis; preexisting or acute liver disease; ischemic liver 
injury; right-sided congestive heart failure; new or worsening liver meta stases; or concomitant 
medication that could cause the observed injury).  Consultation with a gastroenterologist or 
hepatologist should be considered.
The findings described above must be reported  to the Sponsor no more than 24 hours after 
awareness of the event.
8.4.2.2 Severe Hemorrhagic Events
When a hemorrhagic event meets NCI CTCAE ≥Grade 3 severity (regardless of whether it is 
serious or non-serious), the event should be repor ted to the Sponsor no more than 24 hours after 
first awareness of the event.
8.5 Adverse Events of Special Interest for Surufatinib
An AESI (serious or non-serious) is one of scie ntific and medical conc ern specific to the S ponsor’s 
product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the Investigator 
to the Sponsor can be appropriate.  AESI for surufatinib include:
xHepatic disorders
xProteinuria
xHypertension
xThyroid dysfunction
xHemorrhage
xAcute renal failure
8.6 Clinical Laboratory Findings
Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that require active management will be 
recorded as AEs or SAEs on the eCRF (eg,  abnormalities that require study drug dose 
Clinical Study Protocol 2020-012-GLOB2 Surufatinib
Amendment 3
HUTCHMED Limited Page 83
CONFIDENTIALmodification, discontinuation of study drug, mo re frequent follow-up assessments, or further
diagnostic investigation).
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (eg, ALP and 
bilirubin 5 × ULN associated with cholecystitis), only the diagnosis (eg, cholecystitis) needs to be 
recorded on the AE/SAE eCRF.
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the 
abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the eCRF.  If the laboratory abnormality 
can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE or 
SAE.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mmol/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.”
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should 
not be repeatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the eCRF, unless their severity, seriousness, or 
etiology changes. 
8.7 Pregnancy
If a patient becomes pregnant during the co urse of the study, protocol therapy should be 
discontinued immediately.All pregnancies and their subsequent outcome (s pontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, 
ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormalit y) should be reported to the PI as well 
as the Sponsor using the appropriate forms and within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the investigational product 
under study may have interfered with the effectiv eness of a contraceptive medication.  Congenital 
abnormalities/birth defects and spont aneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as SAEs.  
Elective abortions without complications shoul d not be handled as AEs. The outcome of a 
pregnancy should be followed up and documented e ven if the patient was withdrawn from the 
study.
If a pregnancy occurs during exposure to protoc ol therapy or in the 30 days after discontinuing 
investigational product, then investigators or ot her site personnel must inform the PI and the 
appropriate Sponsor representatives immediately, or no later than 24 hours of when he/she 
becomes aware of it.The same timelines apply when outcome information is available.
8.8 Overdose or Misuse
There are no data on overdose in pediatrics since th is is a first in pediatrics study of surufatinib 
alone or in combination with gemcitabine.  There is  no definition of what constitutes an overdose.  
There is no known antidote.
Investigators should be advised that any patient who receives a higher dose than that intended 
should be monitored closely, managed with  appropriate supportive care and followed up 
expectantly.Such overdoses should be recorded as follows:
Clinical Study Protocol 2020-012-GLOB2 Surufatinib

9.1 HypothesisNo formal hypothesis testing is planned for the study. 
9.2 Population
9.2.1 Sample Size Rationale
Up to 36 patients are to be enrolled in this study Three dose escalation levels will be explored 
using the rolling 6 design which will lead to max imum 18 evaluable patien ts. There is 1 additional 
dose level for dose de-escalation if starting dose is not tolerable. Then, up to 12 evaluable patients 
will be evaluated in the PK expansion cohort. Assuming a 15% unevaluable rate with respect to 
the DLT evaluation for dose escalation portion or PK assessment for PK expansion cohort, it is 
expected to have up to 36 pati ents in total for this study.
9.2.2 Analysis Populations
The following populations will be defined for this study:
xDLT Evaluable Set (dose escalation phase): This population includes all patients enrolled 
in the dose escalation phase of the study who receive at least 80% (28 of 35 doses) of the 
prescribed oral surufatinib dose and both doses of gemcitabine during the DLT evaluation period or who discontinued treatment due to a DLT.  
xSafety Analysis Set (All Treated Population): This population includes all patients who 
have received at least 1 dose of surufatinib or gemcitabine. Safety and efficacy data will 
be evaluated based on this population’s outcome. Patients in the safety analysis set will be 
analyzed by their actual dose initially received. If patients have dose reduction during the study, all data will be summarized/analyzed  based on the initial dose of study treatment
received. 
xPharmacokinetic Analysis Set : This population will include all patients who received at 
least 1 dose of surufatinib and have at least one PK sample obtained and analyzed.
9.3 Statistical Analysis Methods
Data will be summarized by dose cohorts using descriptive statistics (continuous data) and/or 
contingency tables (categorical data) for demogra phic and baseline characteristics, efficacy 
measurements, safety measurements, and PK measurements.  Time to event variables will be 
summarized descriptively using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method.  The quartiles including medianalong with 80% and 95% CIs will be reported using the Brookmeyer and Crowley method (using the log-log transformation for CI) ( Brookmeyer 1982 ).  Exact CIs for binomial proportions will be 
derived using the Clopper-Pearson method ( Clopper 1934 ).  Analyses will be performed using

11.2.3 Records
11.2.3.1 Data Capture and Management
The term eCRF refers to the electronic data capture (EDC) system. The EDC system is the 
database where pertinent study data are collected.  F or all patients, including screen failures, data 
will be collected on source documents first.  The PI is responsible for assuring that the data entered 
into eCRFs is complete and accura te and that entry and updates are performed in a timely manner.  
Data will be collected at the study sites, and the data will be transmitted to a designated CRO for 
centralized analysis, as well as for further proc essing and data reconciliation.  Imaging data will 
be collected at the study sites, and a design ated CRO will perform further processing, data 
reconciliation, and holding.
At all times, the PI has final responsibility for th e accuracy and authenticity of all clinical and 
laboratory data entered in the EDC.  Patient source documents are the Investigator ’s/physician ’s
patient records maintained at th e study site.  In cases where the source documents are the hospital 
or the physician ’s chart, the information collected in the EDC must match those charts.
The completed pages of the EDC system are the sole property of the Sponsor and should not be 
made available in any form to third parties w ithout written permission from the Sponsor, except 
for authorized representatives of the Sponsor or appropriate regulatory authorities.
11.2.3.2 Source Documentation
xThe Investigator/institution should maintain accurate source documents and study records 
for all patients that support the information entered in the eCRF.
xSource data should be attributable, legible , contemporaneous, original, accurate, and 
complete.  Changes to source data should be traceable and not obscure the original entry.
xAll information recorded on eCRFs must be trac eable to source documents in the patient ’s
file.  Any changes should be explained if necessary (eg, via an audit trail).

CONFIDENTIAL11.2.3.3 Records Retention
Records and documents, including signed ICFs, source documents, study drug documents, 
monitoring visit records, regulatory documents , and all other correspondence and documents 
pertaining to the conduct of this study must be retain ed by the Investigator for at least 5 years after 
study completion, unless local regulations or institut ional policies require a longer retention period.
If the documents cannot be stored properly at th e investigational site, the documents can be 
transferred by the Investigator and sponsor to an  approved storage facility. The documents must 
be sealed for storage and easily found for review in the case of a regulatory authority audit.  No 
records may be transferred to another location or party without written notification to the sponsor.
No records may be destroyed during the retention period following study completion or discontinuation without the written approval of the Sponsor.  Records must be destroyed in a 
manner that ensures confidentiality. 
11.3 Study Termination or Study Site Closure
The Sponsor and the Investigator have the right to close out a study site prematurely.Investigator’s Decision
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor of a desire to close out a site in writing, providing at least 
30days’ notice.  The final decision should be  made through mutual agreement with the 
Sponsor. Both parties will arrange the close out procedures after review and consultation.
Sponsor’s Decision
The Sponsor will notify the Investigator(s) of a decision to close out a study site in writing.  
Reasons may include the following, among others:
xThe Investigator has received all items and i nformation necessary to perform the study, but 
has not enrolled any patient with in a reasonable period of time
xThe Investigator has violated any fundamental obligation in the study agreement, including 
but not limited to, breach of this protocol (a nd any applicable amendments), breach of the 
applicable laws and regulations, or br each of any applicable ICH guidelines
xThe total number of patients required for th e study are enrolled earlier than expected
If the study is prematurely terminated or su spended, the Sponsor shall promptly inform the 
Investigators, the IEC/IRB, the regulatory authorities, and any CROs used in the study of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirements.  The Investigator shall promptly inform the patient and  should assure appropriat e patient therapy and/or 
follow-up.

CONFIDENTIALAPPENDIX 2 RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID TUMORS 
(RECIST VERSION 1.1)  
Selected sections from the RECIST version 1.1, are presented below.
1. Measurability of Tumor at Baseline1.1 DefinitionsAt baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurable or non-measurable as 
described below.1.1.1 Measurable Tumor LesionsTumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter in the plane 
of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size as follows:
x10 mm by CT or MRI scan (CT/MRI scan slice thickness/interval no greater than 5 mm)
x10-mm caliper measurement by clinical examin ation (lesions that cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable)
x20 mm by chest X-ray
xMalignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be t15 mm in the short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and follow-up, only the 
short axis will be measured and followed.
1.1.2 Non-Measurable Tumor Lesions
Non-measurable tumor lesions encompass small lesions (longest diameter 10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with short axis t10 but 15 mm) as well as truly non-measurable 
lesions. Lesions considered truly non-measurable in clude leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural 
or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast dise ase, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, 
peritoneal spread, and abdominal mass/abdo minal organomegaly identified by physical 
examination that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.
1.1.3 Special Considerations Regarding Lesion MeasurabilityBone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previousl y treated with local therapy require particular 
comment, as outlined below.Bone Lesions:
xBone scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, or plain films are not considered 
adequate imaging techniques for measuring bon e lesions.  However, these techniques can 
be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions.
xLytic bone lesions or mixed lytic –blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, 
that can be evaluated by cross-sectional im aging techniques such as CT or MRI scan can 
be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above.
xBlastic bone lesions are non-measurable.
Clinical Study Protocol 2020-012-GLOB2 Surufatinib
Amendment 3
HUTCHMED Limited Page 105
CONFIDENTIALCystic Lesions:
xLesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts.
xCystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of mea surability described above.  However, if 
non-cystic lesions are present in the same patien t, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.
Lesions with Prior Local Treatment:
xTumor lesions situated in a previously irradiate d area, or in an area subjected to other loco-
regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated 
progression in the lesion.  Study protocols s hould detail the conditions under which such 
lesions would be considered measurable.
1.2 Specifications by Methods of Measurements
1.2.1 Measurement of LesionsAll measurements should be recorded in metric no tation, using calipers if clinically assessed.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatm ent start and never more 
than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.1.2.2 Method of AssessmentThe same method of assessment and the same tec hnique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during the study.  Imaging-based evaluation should 
always be the preferred option.Clinical Lesions.  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
and t10 mm in diameter as assessed using calipers (e g, skin nodules).  For the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by color photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is 
suggested.Chest X-Ray.  Chest CT scan is preferred over chest X-ray, particularly when progression is an 
important endpoint, since CT scan is more sensitive than X-ray, particularly in identifying new 
lesions.  However, lesions on chest X-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly defined 
and surrounded by aerated lung.
CT, MRI.  CT scan is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment.  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan 
based on the assumption that CT scan slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  When CT scans have slice 
thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for  a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness.  MRI is also acceptable.
If prior to enrollment it is known that a patient is unable to undergo CT scans with IV contrast 
because of allergy or renal insuff iciency, the decision as to whether a non-contrast CT scan or MRI 
(without IV contrast) will be used to evaluate the patient at baseline and during the study should 
be guided by the tumor type under investigation and the anatomic location of the disease.  For 
patients who develop contraindicat ions to contrast af ter baseline contrast  CT scan is done, the 
decision as to whether non-contrast CT scan or  MRI (enhanced or non-enhanced) will be 
Clinical Study Protocol 2020-012-GLOB2 Surufatinib
Amendment 3
HUTCHMED Limited Page 106
CONFIDENTIALperformed should also be based on the tumor type  and the anatomic location of the disease, and 
should be optimized to allow for comparison with the prior studies if possible. Each case should 
be discussed with the radiologist to determine if  substitution of these other approaches is possible 
and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable from that point forward. Care must be 
taken in measurement of target lesions on a di fferent modality and in terpretation of non-target 
disease or new lesions, since the same lesion may appear to have a different size using a new 
modality.
Ultrasound. Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of les ion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement.Endoscopy, Laparoscopy, Tumor Markers, Cytology, Histology.  The utilization of these 
techniques for objective tumor evaluation cannot generally be advised.
2. Tumor Response Evaluation
2.1 Assessment of Overall Tumor Burden and Measurable DiseaseTo assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor 
burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for  subsequent measurements.  Measurable disease 
is defined by the presence of at least 1 measurable lesion, as detailed above.2.2 Baseline Documentation of Target and Non-Target LesionsWhen more than 1 measurable lesion is present at  baseline, all lesions up to a maximum of 5
lesions total (and a maximum of 2 lesions per or gan) representative of all involved organs should 
be identified as target lesions and will be recorde d and measured at baseline.  This means that, for 
instances in which patients have only 1 or 2 organ sites involved, a maximum of 2 lesions (1 site) 
and 4 lesions (2 sites), respectively, will be rec orded.  Other lesions (albeit measurable) in those 
organs will be recorded as non-measurable lesions (even if the size is !10 mm by CT scan).
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and 
be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself 
to reproducible measurement, in wh ich circumstance the next largest lesion that can be measured 
reproducibly should be selected.
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are norm al anatomical structures that may be visible 
by imaging even if not involved by tumor.  As no ted above, pathological node s that are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 
t15 mm by CT scan.  Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum.  The 
short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by radiologists to judge if a node is involved 
by solid tumor.  Nodal size is normally reported as 2 dimensions in the plane in which the image 
is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always  the axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition 
may be axial, sagittal, or coronal).  The smaller of th ese measures is the short axis.  For example, 
an abdominal node that is reported as being 20 mm u30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and 
qualifies as a malignant, measurable node.  In this example, 20 mm should be recorded as the node 
measurement.  All other pathological nodes (those with short axis t10 mm but 15 mm) should 
be considered non-target lesions.  Nodes that have a short axis of 10 mm are considered 
non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.
Clinical Study Protocol 2020-012-GLOB2 Surufatinib
Amendment 3
HUTCHMED Limited Page 107
CONFIDENTIALA sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions , short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then, as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum of diameters will be used as a reference to characterize further  any objective tumor regression 
in the measurable dimension of the disease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including pathological lymph nodes, should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required, and 
these lesions should be followed as “present,” “ab sent,” or in rare cases “unequivocal progression.”
In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-tar get lesions involving the same organ as a single 
item on the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) (eg, “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes” or 
“multiple liver metastases”).
2.3 Response Criteria
2.3.1 Evaluation of Target LesionsThis section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor response for 
target lesions.
xComplete response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non-target) mu st have reduction in short axis to 10 mm.
xPartial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions,
taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters
xProgressive disease (PD): At least a 20% incr ease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (n adir), including baseline. In addition to 
the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 
5 mm. The appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also considered progression.
xStable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkag e to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study.
2.3.2 Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions
Lymph Nodes. Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis 
measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even 
if the nodes regress to 10 mm on study.  This means that when lymph nodes are included as target 
lesions, the sum of lesions may not be 0 even if CR criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is 
defined as having a short axis of 10 mm.
Target Lesions That Beco me Too Small to Measure. During the study, all lesions (nodal and 
non-nodal) recorded at baseline  should have their actual measurements recorded at each 
subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2 mm).  However, sometimes lesions or lymph 
nodes that are recorded as target lesions at baseline  become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist 
may not feel comfortable assigning an exact me asure and may report them as being too small to 
measure.  When this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the eCRF, as follows:
xIf it is the opinion of the radiologist that th e lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement 
should be recorded as 0 mm.  If the lesion is be lieved to be present and is faintly seen but 
too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned and below measurable 
limit (BML) should be ticked. (BML is equivalent to a “ less than” sign.) (Note: It is less 
likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they usually have a definable size

CONFIDENTIALwhen normal and are frequently surrounded by fat such as in the retroperitoneum; however, 
if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned in  this circumstance as well and BML should 
also be ticked).
To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is ab le to provide an actual measure, that should be 
recorded, even if it is below 5 mm, and in that case BML should not be ticked.
Lesions That Split or Coalesce on Treatment. When non-nodal lesions fragment, the longest 
diameters of the fragmented portions should be adde d together to calculate the target lesion sum. 
Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual  lesion.  If the lesions have truly coalesced 
such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be 
the maximum longest diameter for the coalesced lesion.
2.3.3 Evaluation of Non-Target LesionsThis section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for the 
group of non-target lesions.  While so me non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need 
not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in 
the protocol.
xCR: Disappearance of all non-target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of tumor 
marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size ( 10 mm short axis).
xNon-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesions a nd/or (if applicable) 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.
xPD: Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. The appearance of one or 
more new lesions is also considered progression.
2.3.4 Special Notes on Assessment of Pr ogression of Non-Target Disease
When the Patient Also Has Measurable Disease. In this setting, to achieve unequivocal 
progression on the basis of the non-target disease, there must be an overall level of substantial 
worsening in non-target disease in a magnitude that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased su fficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A
modest increase in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usua lly not sufficient to qualify for 
unequivocal progression status.  The designati on of overall progression solely on the basis of 
change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will  therefore be extremely 
rare.
When the Patient Has Only  Non-Measurable Disease. This circumstance arises in some phase 3
studies when it is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable disease.  The same general 
concepts apply here as noted above; however, in  this instance there is no measurable disease 
assessment to factor into the interpretation of an  increase in non-measurable disease burden.  
Because worsening in non-target disease cannot be easily quantified (by definition: if all lesions 
are truly non-measurable), a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients for unequivocal 
progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the change in 
non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude  to the increase that would be required to 
declare PD for measurable disease, that is, an in crease in tumor burden representing an additional 
73% increase in volume (which is equivalent to a 20% increase in diameter in a measurable lesion).  
Clinical Study Protocol 2020-012-GLOB2 Surufatinib
Amendment 3
HUTCHMED Limited Page 109
CONFIDENTIALExamples include an increase in a pleural effusi on from “trace” to “large” or an increase in 
lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described in pro tocols as “sufficient 
to require a change in therapy.”  If unequi vocal progression is seen, the patient should be 
considered to have had overall PD at that point.  While it would be ideal to have objective criteria 
to apply to non-measurable disease, the very na ture of that disease makes it impossible to do so; 
therefore, the increase must be substantial.
2.3.5 New LesionsThe appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some comments 
on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for the identification of 
new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal, that is, not 
attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality, or findings thought
to represent something other than tumor (for example, some “new” bone lesions may be simply 
healing or flare of preexisting lesions).  This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline 
lesions show PR or CR.  For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan 
report as a “new” cystic lesion, which it is not.
A lesion identified during the study in an anatomica l location that was not scanned at baseline is 
considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow-up 
evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new dis ease.  If repeat scans confirm there is definitely 
a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.
18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography
While 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) response assessments 
need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progre ssion (particularly, possible “new” disease).  
New lesions on the basis of FDG- PET imaging can be identiﬁ ed according to the following 
algorithm:
A negative FDG-PET scan at baseline with a posit ive FDG-PET scan during the study is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.In the case of no FDG-PET scan at baseline and a positive FDG-PET scan during the study:
xIf the positive FDG-PET scan during the study corresponds to a new site of disease 
conﬁrmed by CT scan, this will be considered PD.
xIf the positive FDG-PET scan during the study is not con ﬁrmed as a new site of disease on 
CT scan, additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine whether there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial 
abnormal FDG-PET scan).
xIf the positive FDG-PET scan during the study corresponds to a preexisting site of disease on CT scan that is not progressing on the basi s of the anatomic images, this will not be 
considered PD.

CONFIDENTIAL2.4 Evaluation of Response
2.4.1 Time Point Response (Overall Response)It is assumed that at each protocol specifie d time point, a response assessment occurs.  Table 14
provides a summary of the overall response status calculation at each time point for patients who 
have measurable disease at baseline.When patients have non-measurable (therefore non-target) disease only Table 15 is to be used.
Table 14 Time Point Response: Patients with Target Lesions (with or without Non-
Target Lesions)

CR CR No CR

CR Not evaluated No PR

SD Non-PD or not all evaluated No SD
Not all evaluated Non-PD No NE
PD Any Yes or no PD

Any Any Yes PD

a“Non -CR/non- PD” is preferred over “stable disease” for non -target disease since stable disease is increasingly 
used as an endpoint for assessment of efficacy in some studies ; thus, assigning “stable disease” when no 
lesions can be measured is not advised.
2.4.2 Missing Assessments and Not Evaluable DesignationWhen no imaging/measurement is done at all at a pa rticular time point, the patient is NE at that 
time point.  If only a subset of lesion measurements  are made at an assessment, usually the case is 
also considered NE at that time point, unle ss a convincing argument can be made that the 
contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned time point response.  
This would be most likely to happen in the case of  PD.  For example, if a patient had a baseline 
sum of 50 mm with 3 measured lesions and, during the study, only 2 lesions were assessed, but 
Clinical Study Protocol 2020-012-GLOB2 Surufatinib
Amendment 3
HUTCHMED Limited Page 111
CONFIDENTIALthose gave a sum of 80 mm, the patient will have achieved PD status, regardless of the contribution 
of the missing lesion.
If one or more target lesions were not assessed either because the scan was not done or the scan 
could not be assessed because of poor image quality or obstructed view, the response for target 
lesions should be “unable to assess” since the patient is NE.  Similarly, if one or more non-target 
lesions are not assessed, the response for non- target lesions should be “unable to assess” except 
where there is clear progression.  Overall response w ould be “unable to assess” if either the target 
response or the non- target response is “unable to assess” excep t where this is clear evidence of 
progression, as this equates with the case being NE at that time point.2.4.3 Best Overall Response: All Time PointsThe BOR is determined once all the data for the pa tient is known.  Best response determination in 
studies where confirmation of CR or PR is not require d: Best response in these studies is defined 
as the best response across all time points (for exam ple, a patient who has SD at first assessment, 
PR at second assessment, and PD on last assessment has a BOR of PR).  When SD is believed to 
be best response, it must also meet the protocol  specified minimum time from baseline.  If the 
minimum time is not met when SD is otherwise the best time point response, the patient’s best 
response depends on the subsequent assessments.  For example, a patient who has SD at first 
assessment, PD at second, and does not meet mini mum duration for SD, will have a best response 
of PD.  The same patient lost to follow-up after the first SD assessment would be considered NE.
Best response determination in studies wher e confirmation of CR or PR is required: Complete 
response or PR may be claimed only if the criteria for  each are met at a subsequent time point as 
specified in the protocol (generally 4 weeks later ).  In this circumstance, the BOR can be 
interpreted as in Table 16 .

Partial Response is Required

CR=complete response, PR=partial response, SD=stable diseas e, PD=progressive diseas e, and NE=not evaluable.
aIf a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting 
PR criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after 
CR).  Best response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met.  However, sometimes 
‘CR’ may be claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the 
patient had PR, not CR at the first time point.  Under th ese circumstances, the original CR should be changed 
to PR and the best response is PR.
Special Notes on Response Assessment
When nodal disease is included in th e sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to “normal” 
size (10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  This measurement should 
be recorded even though the nodes are normal in  order not to overstate progression should it be 
based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted earlier, this means that patients with CR may not 
have a total sum of “zero” on the eCRF.Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without 
objective evidence of disease progression at th at time should be reported as “symptomatic 
deterioration.”  Every effort s hould be made to document objectiv e progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deteri oration is not a descriptor of an objective 
response; it is a reason for stopping study therapy.  The objective response status of such patients is to be determined by evaluation of target and non-target disease as shown in Table 14 and 
Table 15.
For equivocal findings of progression (eg, very s mall and uncertain new lesions; cystic changes or 
necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue  until the next scheduled assessment. If at the 
next scheduled assessment, progression is confir med, the date of progression should be the earlier 
date when progression was suspected.In studies for which patients with advanced disease are eligible (ie, primary disease still or partially 
present), the primary tumor should also be captured as a target or non-target lesion, as appropriate.  
This is to avoid an incorrect assessment of CR if th e primary tumor is still present but not evaluated 
as a target or non-target lesion.2.5 Frequency of Tumor Re-evaluationFrequency of tumor re-evaluation while on treatmen t should be protocol specific and adapted to 
the type and schedule of treatment.   However, in the context of phase  2 studies where the beneficial 
effect of therapy is not known, follow-up every 6 to 8  weeks (timed to coincide with the end of a 
cycle) is reasonable.  Smaller or greater time inter vals than these could be justified in specific 
regimens or circumstances.  The protocol should sp ecify which organ sites are to be evaluated at 
baseline (usually those most like ly to be involved with metastatic disease for the tumor type under 
study) and how often evaluations are repeated.  Normally, all target and non-target sites are 
evaluated at each assessment.  In selected ci rcumstances certain non-target organs may be 
evaluated less frequently.  For example, bone scans may need to be repeated only when CR is
identified in target disease or when progression in bone is suspected.
After the end of the treatment, the need for repe titive tumor evaluations depends on whether the 
trial has as a goal the response rate or the time to an event (progression/death).  If ‘time to an event’ 
(eg, time to progression, disease-free survival, PFS)  is the main endpoint of the study, then routine 
scheduled re-evaluation of protocol  specified sites of disease is warranted.  In randomized 
Clinical Study Protocol 2020-012-GLOB2 Surufatinib
Amendment 3
HUTCHMED Limited Page 113
CONFIDENTIALcomparative studies in particular, the scheduled assessments should be performed as identified on 
a calendar schedule (for example: every 6 to 8 weeks on treatment or every 3 to 4 months after 
treatment) and should not be affected by delays in therapy, drug holidays or any other events that 
might lead to imbalance in a treatment arm in the timing of disease assessment.
2.6 Confirmatory Measurement/Duration of Response2.6.1. ConfirmationIn non-randomized studies where response is th e primary endpoint, confirmation of PR and CR is 
required to ensure responses identified are not th e result of measurement error.  This will also 
permit appropriate interpretation of results in the context of historical data where response has 
traditionally required confirmation in such studies (see the paper by Bogaerts et al. in this Special 
Issue 10).  However, in all other circumstances, fo r example in randomized studies (phase 2 or 3) 
or in studies where SD or progression are the pr imary endpoints, confirmation of response is not 
required since it will not add value to the interpr etation of study results.  However, elimination of 
the requirement for response confirmation may incr ease the importance of central review to protect 
against bias, in particular in studies that are not blinded.
In the case of SD, measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a 
minimum interval (in general not less than 6 to 8 weeks) that is defined in the study protocol.
2.6.2. Duration of Overall Response
The duration of overall response is measured from  the time measurement criteria are first met for 
CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or PD is objectively 
documented (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded on study).
The duration of overall complete response is measure d from the time measurement criteria are first 
met for CR until the first date that rec urrent disease is objectively documented.
2.6.3. Duration of Stable Disease
Stable disease is measured from the start of th e treatment (in randomized studies, from date of 
randomization) until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum on 
study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the reference for calculation of PD).
The clinical relevance of the duration of SD varies  in different studies and diseases.  If the 
proportion of patients achieving SD for a minimum period of time is an endpoint of importance in 
a particular study, the protocol should specif y the minimal time interval required between 2
measurements for determination of SD.Note: The DoR and SD as well as the PFS are i nfluenced by the frequency of follow-up after 
baseline evaluation.  It is not in the scope of this guideline to define a standard follow-up 
frequency.  The frequency should take into acco unt many parameters including disease types and 
stages, treatment periodicity and standard practi ce.  However, these limi tations of the precision of 
the measured endpoint should be taken into account if comparisons between studies are to be made.

Supplement: Version 5  Study design  This is a single center, randomized, stratified by baseline pain, double- blind, 
parallel , placebo -controlled  study in subjects experiencing moderate to severe 
postoperative dental pain.  
Methodology  Subjects desiring  elective third  molar surgery will be solicited to participate.  
Subject who consent and meet all the inclusion and exclusion criteria  will be 
scheduled for surgical removal of impacted teeth under local anesthesia +/ - light 
sedation with nitrous oxide/oxygen.  When subjects  report “moderate” to 
“severe” post -operative pain, they will be dosed with one of the three study 
treatments as determined by a predetermined randomization schedule. Pain 
assessments (Pain Intensity, Pain Relief, Pain Half Gone and Global Assessment ) 
will be performed at scheduled intervals post -drug for 24 hours.  
For each postdose timepoint, pain intensity differences (PID) will be derived by subtracting the pain intensity at the postdose timepoint from the baseline intensity score (baseline score – post-baseline score).  A positive difference is 
indicative of improvement.  Time -weighted sum of pain intensity differences 
(SPIDs) will be calculated by multiplying the PID score at each postdose timepoint by the duration (in hours) since the preceding timepoint and then 
summing these values over  the desired time interval .  Similarly, total pain relief 
scores (TOTPARs), will be calculated by multiplying the pain relief score at each 
postdose timepoint by the duration (in hours) since the preceding timepoint and  
then summing these values.  
Type of control  Reference product  (positive control) and placebo (negative control)  
Data Monitoring Committee  No 
Number of subjects  385 
Primary variable (s) Time to first use of rescue medication  
Time point/frame of 
measurement for primary 
variable(s)  Pain intensity and pain relief will be rated by subjects at baseline (predose), 0.5, 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24 hours postdose, and 
immediately prior to the use of any rescue medication.  
Plan for statistical analysis  Time to first use of rescue medication will be estimated and plotted using 
Kaplan -Meier method and analyzed using log -rank test stratified by center and 
baseline pain intensity.  
Additional parameters  calculated  for SPID 0 -4, SPID 0 -8, SPID  0-12, SPID  0-24, 
SPID 6 -12, TOTPAR 0 -4, TOTPAR 0 -8, TOTPAR  0-12, TOTPAR  0-24 and 
TOTPAR  6-12 analyzed using an analysis of covariance model (ANCOVA) with 
treatment as fixed effect and baseline pain intensity score as the covariate.   A 
95% of confidence interval (CI) for the treatment difference (naprox en-placebo;  
naproxen -ibuprofen ; ibuprofen -placebo ) will be calculated based on the above 
mentioned model .

Background 
In addition to the information provided below please also refer to the Package Insert for Aleve 
and Advil or any additional data supplied by the Sponsor. 
 Naproxen sodium  and ibuprofen are nonselective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor s. They are 
propionic acid derivatives and members of a drug class s known as nonsteroidal anti -
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  Both n aproxen  and ibuprofen inhibit COX -1 and COX -2 
isoenzymes .  COX enzymes play a key role in the inflammatory response and the production 
of prostaglandins.  Specifically, COX -1 is expressed in the gastrointestinal epithelium, 
vascular endothelium and kidney, while COX -2 plays a role in induction of inflammation. 
COX-2 inhibition reduces prostaglandin synthesis, leading to pain relief.   In the United States, naproxen has been marketed as a prescription medication since 1976 
under the brand name Naprosyn
®.  Its sodium salt, naproxen sodium, was first sold under the 
trade name Anaprox® in 1980.  In 1994, the US FDA approved naproxen sodium tablets 
(usin g the brand name Aleve®), 220 mg for over -the- counter (OTC) use. Aleve is indicated 
for the temporary relief of minor aches and pains due to: minor pain of arthritis, muscular aches, backaches, menstrual cramps, headaches, toothaches, and the common cold.  It also 
temporarily reduces fever.  As an OTC medication, Aleve should not be taken for longer than 10 days for pain or 3 days for fever unless othe rwise directed by a physician.   Similarly, 
Advil
® (a branded form of ibuprofen) has been available OTC sinc e 1984.  It carries the same 
indications and duration of use labeling  as Aleve.  
 The lab elled dosing interval for over -the- counter naproxen sodium is 8- 12 hours due to its 
long elimination half-life (approxi mately 14 hours) and documented long duration of 
action .[1,2] In contrast, ibuprofen, another propionic acid nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory dr ug 
available over -the- counter, has a  labeled dosing interval of 4- 6 hours and a short elimination 
half-life, 2-4 hours.[ 2]  These two agents have been compared in single dose dental pain 
studies.[ 3,4] The analgesic effectiveness of naproxen sodium was greater than ibuprofen at 
later time points in both of these 12 hour studies  but the duration of the studies was relatively 
short and the e valuations were performed at home.  The ability to assess relative differences 
in the later hours may have been limited by the outpatient nature of those earlier studies which used at -home diaries.    
 The duration of analgesia in acute pain studies is  generally assessed by the time to 
remedication .[5] At both low OTC doses and high OTC doses, naproxen sodium showed a 
numerically longer duration of action compared to ibuprofen although the difference did not achieve the level of statistical significance. [3,4]  However, the sample size in these two 
studies was not estimated based on thi s secondary outcome parameter.  
 The post- impaction dental pain model chosen for this study  has been widely used in the 
evaluation of OTC and prescription analgesics for a number of reasons. Dental surgical 
procedures can be easily standardized , and the population of subjects undergoing a given 
procedure is usual ly relatively healthy and homogeneous. In addition, there is extensive data 
substantiating the usefulness of the dental pain model in predicting the relative efficacy of a 
wide range of  analgesic medications. The model has been found to be very useful for 
comparing  several measures of analgesic efficacy, including onset, peak effect, and duration

impaction dental pain model to compare the duration of act ion of naproxen sodium to 
ibuprofen at over-the-counter doses.

Supplement: Version 5  Benefit -risk assessment  
 
Subjects who desire to have third molar extraction  will be solicited to participate  in this study.  
Subjects who consent to participate may benefit by receiving a medical exam, dental 
radiographs and no- cost surgical procedure s for teeth  extraction. Furthermore, post- surgical  
subjects will be pr ovided continual nursing care for approximately 24 hours after surgery.  
Potential risks of the surgical procedure  include pain, dry socket, infection, swelling, 
bleeding, trismus, and lip or tongue numbness.  Potential risks related to local anesthesia and 
mild sedation include paresthesia and  drowsiness .  Subjects who experience a treatment 
failure can have the option of taking a standard rescue medication commonly used for post-
operative pain relief.   Potential study medication benefit will be relief of postsurgical pain 
which is highly prevalent  following extractions of wisdom teeth.  Potential risks of a single 
dose of OTC study medication are low and described in the Drug Facts Label.  During the study, subjects will be closely monitored for evidence of adverse events.  
Weighing between the potential risks associated with the  study, and given the ability to 
mitigate risks through close monitoring  and routine peri -operative care, this study is 
considered clinic ally and ethically acceptable.

Supplement: Version 5  4. Study obje ctives  
The primary objective of this trial is:  
• To compare the duration of analgesic efficacy as determined by the time to 
rescue medication of a single oral dose of naproxen sodium 440  mg (2 x 220 
mg tablets)  relative to ibuprofen 400 mg (2 x 200 mg tabl ets) and placebo (2 x 
tablets) over 24 hours in subjects experiencing moderate to severe post-
impaction surgery dental pain.

Supplement: Version 5  5. Study design  
Design Overview  
This is a single center, randomized, double -blind, parallel , placebo-controlled study, stratified 
by baseline pain, in subjects experiencing moderate to severe postoperative dental pain. The 
study will consist of a Prescreening telep hone call, a Screening Visit,  a two day Treatment 
Period  and a Post -Operative visit.  Eligible subjects who have undergone surgical extraction 
of at least 2 mandibular partial or full bony impacted  third molars will be kept in-house and 
evaluated for efficacy and safety at the study site  overnight. 
The study consists of a Screening Phase, Treatment Phase and a Follow -Up Phase. During 
Treatment Phase, subjects will be ke pt in -house at the study site  for one overnight stay .  
Qualified subjects  will then be randomized into one of two treatment s. Approximately 485 
subjects  will be screened prior to surgery.  Approximately 397 will have surgery  and 
approximately 385 will be randomized to a specific treatment.  
Screening Phase  
Eligible subjects will be screened and selected up to 28 days prior to oral surgery and dos ing 
with investigational pr oduct. 
Treatment Phase  
Following selection, qualified subjects will enter the Treatment Phase and be scheduled for 
their surgical teeth  extraction.  After completion of the surgical teeth  extraction s, subjects will 
remain at the study site for observation. Subjects with appropriate pain severity  for 
randomization will then be stratified by baseline pain intensity and randomized into one of 
three (3) treatment groups.  Subjects will rate th eir pain severity and pain relief over the next 
24 hours.  After completion of all trial procedures, subjects will be discharged from the study 
site. 
All subjects are required to remain at the study center and complete all assessments regardless 
of rescue. 
Follow- Up Phase  
Subjects will be evaluated at a post -operative visit /call approximately 6-10 days after surgery  
for follow up for any adverse events or medications not known at the time of treatment. 
 The duration of each subject’s participation will be approximately 38 days . For an overview 
on the study design and study procedures see Figure 1.

Justification of the design  
The study was designed specifically to capture and measure acute post-surgical dental pain in 
healthy subjects who could benefit from the administration of an OTC pain reliever.  This 
pain model has been widely studied for OTC pain medicatio ns; however, should a subject not 
get sufficient pain relief from the IMP, then rescue medication approved for treating acute 
pain (e.g., acetaminophen plus hydrocodone, tramadol, acetaminophen, etc. ) may be 
requested.  The endpoints and study design are co nsistent with most recent Guidance by FDA 
and methods advocated by experts.[ 9,10]

The selection criteria are chosen to ensure that subjects with specific risks for administration of either  study medication and/or subjects with conditions which may have an impact on the 
outcomes of the study are excluded.  
6.4 Withdrawal of subjects from study 
6.4.1 Withdrawal 
Withdrawal criteria  
Subjects must  be withdrawn from the study if any of the following occurs : 
• At their own request or at the request of their legally acceptable representative. At any 
time during the study and without giving reasons, a subject may decline to participate 
further.  The subj ect will not suffer any disadvantage as a result.  
• Subject’s pain intensity post -surgery at pre -dose does not exceed ‘mild’ and the NRS 
is <5 (see Section 16.2);  
• If, in the Investigator's opinion, continuation of the study would be harmful to the 
subject's well -being;  
•  
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study if any of the following occurs: 
• Subject experiences one or more s erious adverse events; 
• At the  specific request of the Sponsor and in consultation  with the Investigator (e.g. , 
obvious non- compliance, safety concerns);  
• Protocol violation: if the subject develops conditions which would have prevented his/her entry into the study according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, he/she must 
be withdrawn immediately if safety is concerned; in other cases, the investigator will decide whether there is a conflict with the study objectives.

Reference Number: BHC- RD-OI-107 
Supplement: Version 5  Depending on the time point of withdrawal, a withdrawn subject is  referred to as either a 
“screening failure ”, “run- in failure” or “dropout ” as specified below:  
Screening failure  
A subject who, for any reason ( e.g., failure to satisfy the selection criteria), terminates the 
study prior to the start of surgery  is regarded as a “Screening failure”.  
Re-starting the defined set of screening procedures to enable the “screening failure” subject’s 
participation at a later time point is not allowed – with the following exceptions:  
• The subject had successfully passed the screenin g procedures, but could not start 
subsequent surgery/treatment on schedule. 
• Initial screening occurred too early to complete the required washout period after prior 
therapy.  
• The in clusion / exclusion criteria preventing the subject’s initial attempt to participate 
have been changed (via protocol amendment). 
In any case, the investigator has to ensure that the repeated screening procedures do not 
expose the subject to an unjustifiable health risk. S ubjects who  re -screen  will  re-sign the 
informed consent form, even if it was not changed after the subject’s previous screening and will be assigned a new screening number . 
Run-in failure  
A subject who, for any reason terminates the study after surgery and prior to the start of study 
drug administration (e.g., not meeting pain threshold) is regarded as a “Run- in failure”.  
Dropout 
A subject who discontinues study participation prematurely for any reason is defined as a 
“dropout” if the subject has been randomized and administered at least one dose of study drug. 
General procedures  
In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the case report form/electronic 
case report form (CRF/eCRF)  data collection system  and in the subject's medical records.  
The subject may object to the generation and processing of post- withdrawal data as specified 
in Section  13.4. 
Details for the premature termination of the study as a whole (or components thereof) are provided in Section 12 ( Premature termination of the Study ). 
6.4.2 Replacement 
Subjects will not be replaced. 
6.5 Subject identification 
Each subject is identified by the study site’s unique subject identification code. After informed consent procedure every subject is given a screening number (SNR). At the time

four-digit number in sequential  order (randomization number, RNR).  See Section  7.3. 
 
7. Treatment(s) 
The study center will dispense a single -dose of an assigned treatment within 4.5 hours 
postsurgery.  The tablets and placebo will be administered in a 3:3:1 randomization ratio 
(naproxen sodium; ibuprofen; placebo) based on a computer- generated randomization 
schedule and the severity of pain experienced (moderate or severe).  Subjects who characterize their pain severity as mild and have a NRS <5 will not receive treatment and w ill 
be discharged from the study site, if deemed safe by an Investigator.

Supplement: Version 5  7.3 Treatment assignment 
At the beginning of the first treatment period, after completion of the pre- treatment baseline 
procedures/assessments, subjects who meet the entry criteria will be sequentially assigned to a 
unique number in sequential order (randomization number, RNR) according to the 
randomization schedule 3:3:1 (naproxen sodium: ibuprofen: placebo) prepared prior to the 
study.  
Subjects will be number ed according to the following scheme: 
14001XXXX  
Whereas the “Xs” will be replaced with a four digit sequentially assigned number as each 
subject enters the study (e.g. , first subject number will be 140011001).  
The unique subject identifier number will be assigned in numerical order stratified by baseline 2 or 3 categorical pain level  (moderate or  severe)  prior to dosing (see Section 16.2
).  Subjects 
who designate their baseline pain as moderate  will use the lowest randomization number 
available with subsequent moderate randomizations using the next available lowest number.  Subjects who designate their baseline pain as severe  will use the highest randomization 
number available with subsequent severe randomizations using the next availa ble highest 
randomization number.  Subjects who characterize their pain severity as mild and <5 on the 
NRS will not receive treatment and be withdrawn from the study.  
Once a number has been assigned to a subject, it cannot be reassigned to another subject.   
Subjects completing the Screening Visit, if not scheduled for surgery the same day,  will 
return to the trial site within 28 days, and if they continue to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria postsurgery will be randomized to one of three treatment groups: 
• Naproxen sodium tablets (220 mg x 2 tablets ) 
• Ibuprofen tablets (200 mg x 2 tablets ) 
• Placebo  tablets (2 tablets)  
Subjects will be assigned to treatment groups in accordance with the randomization schedule.  The Sponsor or designee will provide a randomization schedule to the study site.    
7.4 Dosage and administration 
Each subject will receive a single dose randomized to naproxen (220 mg x 2 tablets), 
ibuprofen (200 mg x 2 tablets) or placebo (2 tablets).  S ubjects receive the study drug with a 
full glass of non-refrigerated, non- carbonated wat er (about 8 ounces or 240 mL). Study drug 
will be administered using dosing cups. Selection and preparation of the proper dose will be 
performed by an unblinded study team member  using the provided randomization schedule 
(see Section  7.5.1).  The Investigator or a designee will supervise the study drug 
administration  in a manner which maintains the masking conditions (blinding of the subject ).   
Subjects must be NPO from midnight prior to surgery until completion of surgery.  Subject will continue fasting, with the exception of clear liquids, until after study drug administration.

Supplement: Version 5  7.5 Blinding 
7.5.1 Blinding measures  
Subjects enrolled in the trial, investigators and their staff involved in protocol procedures or 
who are involved in data collection , data entry and data analysis will be blinded to the identity 
of the treatments  until the database is locked . The study monitor will conduct product 
accountability after database lock.  To preserve blinding, subjects will be blindfolded.  Study 
drug will be dispensed by an unblinded study team member based on the randomization 
schedule.   That team member may have no other role in the study conduct and may not reveal 
the study drug’s identity to any members of the blinded study team. 
Sponsor will supply study medication in bulk containers.  Selection of the proper dose for an 
individual subject will be performed by an unblinded study team member  using the provided 
randomization schedule.  The unblinded study team member will withdraw the appropriate 
study medication from the bulk container and transfer it to a dispensing cup.  The unblinded study team member will then bring the  study medication to the treatment room where it will 
be dispensed to the subject by  the  unblinded study team member.  The unblinded study team 
member should have no other responsibilities in the study. 
 
7.5.2 Unblinding  
In the case of a medical emergency, such as serious adverse events (SAE), breaking the blind may become necessary during the trial.  Randomization code-break envelopes must be securely maintained at the tr ial site and with the Sponsor. 
In compliance with applicable regulations, in the event of a serious unexpected adverse event (SUSAR ) related to the blinded treatment, the subject’s treatment code will usually be 
unblinded before reporting to the health authorities, ethic committees and investigators (see Section 9.6.1.4).  
7.5.3 Emergency unblinding by the investigator 
The investigator will be provided code-break envelopes that can be used to break the blinding of the study drug.  Any subject who was unblinded using the code-break envelopes must document this occurrence in the subject’s medical record.  The investigator must report the blind break in conjunction with a SAE within 24 hours of becoming aware of the effect as  
defined in Section 9.6.1.  Subjects that have been unblinded will not be included in the ITT or 
PP efficacy analysis.  
The Sponsor will collect all code-break envelopes at the end of the study. 
7.6 Drug logistics and accountability 
The Sponsor will provide sufficient quantity of the investigational medicinal product ( IMP) to 
the study site.  The study center will dispense IMP according to the randomization schedule 
and the subject’s categorical pain intensity (moderate or severe)  postsurgery.  IMP will be 
supplied to the study center in multi-dose bottles and dispensed by an unblinded member of the study team.

Reference Number: BHC- RD-OI-107 
Supplement: Version 5  Subjects will be instructed not to consume alcohol, any food or beverages containing 
caffeine (e.g., coffee, tea, chocolate, and colas) products after midnight prior to 
surgery.  Surgery will be scheduled between 0630 h and 1000 h (+/ - 30 minutes). 
The Principal Investigator or his/her designee must review subject’s study records before qualifying the subject for the trial.  
9.2.2 Presurgery  
Subjects are instructed to be nil per os (NPO) from midnight prior to surgery.  If a subject had 
something to eat or drink after midnight, the surgeon must determine if surgery may proceed.  Subjects will arrive at the unit at their assigned time and will have the following activities completed prior to dental surgery: 
• Review changes in the subject’s medical/medication history and 
inclusion/exclusion criteria since previous visit; 
• Urine tests for illicit drugs and cotinine; 
• Breath alcohol test;  
• Vital signs (sitting blood pressure, pulse rate and respiration after sitting for 
5 minutes) ; 
• Urine pregnancy test (if applicable) ; 
• Review pain assessment process  and procedures;  
9.2.2.1  Impaction Score 
An Impaction Score will be used to assess each tooth based on the radiographic appearance and 
the intraoral examination .  Each tooth will be rated from 1 to 4 using the following 
criteria: (1) erupted in tissue (2) soft tissue impaction  (3) partial bony impaction, and (4) full bony 
impaction.  Only subjects whose mandibular impactions are scored  (3) or (4) will be  eligible to 
participate in the study.  
9.2.3 During Surgery 
During surgery, subjects will be administered a short acting local anesthetic (lidocaine  or 
mepivacaine with or without vasoconstrictor) and nitrous oxide ; at the discretion of the 
dentist/oral surgeon.  Topical anesthetics may also be used prior to the administration of the 
short acting local anesthetic.   Long duration local anesthetics like bupivacaine are not 
permitted.   No other perioperative analgesic or anesthetic agents are permitted. Perioperative 
corticosteroids are not permitted.  
9.2.4 Postsurgery 
During the postsurgery recovery period, subjects will rest quietly, but will be  encouraged not 
to fall asleep.  Subjects will be permitted to drink clear liquids following surgery until they 
have been dosed.  Subject may incorpor ate foods according to a soft diet following dosing 
beginning 60 minutes after dosing.  Subjects will not be allowed to eat 30 min prior to any planned assessments.  
In order to qualify for randomization and continue in the trial, subjects must have ‘ moderate’ 
or ‘severe’ postoperative pain intensity on the Categorical Pain Rating Scale and a score of ≥ 5 
on the NRS within 4.5 hours of the last suture, but no later than 14:30 +/- 15 minutes.

Reference Number: BHC- RD-OI-107 
Supplement: Version 5  Eligible subjects will be assigned a subject randomization number and investigational 
products will be administered according to a generated randomization schedule (see Section 7.3). 
Subjects who have not met the randomization criteria within 4.5 hours from last suture by 
14:30 h +/ - 15 minutes  will not be randomized and may be discharged from the clinic, once 
deemed el igible by an Investigator.  Prior to being released from the clinic,  discharge 
procedures will be reviewed with the subject. When discharged, all subjects will need to make 
prior arrangements for travel and should not drive themselves home. 
After the baseli ne (pre -dose) pain intensity is determined, pain intensity , pain relief and pain 
half  gone will be rated by subjects at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 
and 24 hours (+/ - 5 minute s over the first 6 hours; ±10 minutes from hours 7 through 24 ) 
postdose, and immediately prior to the use of the first dose  rescue medication.  If necessary, 
subjects will be awakened 10 minutes prior to  scheduled pain assessments.  The order of the 
pain assessments  is Pain Intensity, then Pain Relief, then Pain Half Gone then query about 
any AEs.  At hour 24  or immediately prior to the first dose of  rescue medication (if required) ,  
study subjects will be asked to provide a Global A ssessment  of investigational product as a 
pain reliever  after com pletion of the other assessments.  Additionally, subjects will have vital 
signs taken  after surgery then 1 and  24 hours postdose. 
Throughout the treatment period, the subjects will be monitored for the occurrence of adverse 
events.  Symptoms will be assess ed by spontaneous reporting of AEs and by asking the 
subjects to respond to a non- leading question such as “How do you feel? ” or “Are you 
experiencing any other effects?”  All reported  or observed AEs will be collected and recorded 
on the case report form.   The information will be based on signs and symptoms reported by 
the subject or observed by the study personnel staff during clinical evaluation. 
If a subject has any clinically significant, trial -related abnormalities at the conclusion of the 
treatment p eriod, the clinical monitor (or designated representative) should be notified and the 
subject should be asked to remain at the trial site until such abnormalities are stabilized  or 
resolve.  If the subject is unable or unwilling to remain at the trial site, the clinical monitor (or 
designated representative) should be notified, and the Investigator should make every effort to arrange follow -up evaluations at appropriate intervals to document the course of the 
abnormalities.  
Subjects will be allowed the use of ice following the use of rescue medication.  Ice will not be 
permitted for subjects prior to randomization until after they have been administered rescure 
medication (if applicable).  If subject has been administered rescue, ice will be given as 
requested by the subject for 20 min incriments.  Ice will be removed 30 min prior to the 
completion of any pain assessments.  Upon completion of all trial procedures, subjects will be discharged from the trial site.  Subjects will need to make prior arrangeme nts for travel and 
should not drive themselves home. 
9.2.5 Rescue Medication 
If adequate pain relief was not achieved, then subjects are permitted to take rescue medication, although they will be encouraged to wait 90 minutes to allow the investigational 
product time to take effect.  Rescue medication will be Hydrocodone 5 mg/ Acetaminophen 
325 mg tablets or other appropriate analgesics may be used at the discretion of the 
Investigator .  Subjects will be required to complete pain assessments by rating pain intensity ,

initial dose of rescue medication. 
Rescue medication is also available on return of pain and the time of rescue medication will 
be recorded.  Pain assessment s will be performed immediately before the first  dose of rescue 
medication.  
• Rating of Pain Intensity (NRS);  
• Rating of Pain Relief (Categorical) ; 
• Pain Half Gone 
• Global A ssessment  of investigational product as a pain reliever. 
Subjects will be queried in a nonspecific fash ion for any adverse events.  All observed and  
reported AEs will be collected and recorded on the case report form.  The information recorded will be based on signs and symptoms reported by the subject or observed by the research coordinato r during clinical evaluation.  
9.2.6 End of Trial (EOT) 
After completion of the treatment period  the following additional evaluations will be 
performed:  
• Trial sites will have the option of either contacting subjects within 5 to 9 days after 
surgery (by phone)  or scheduling subjects for an office appointment, depending on 
their standard of care policies, to assess the occurrence or persistence of AEs, any medications taken, and for adequate treatment and follow up.   
9.3 Population characteristics 
9.3.1 Demographic 
For b asic subject assessment prior to screening, some demographic information may be 
collected before obtaining written informed consent: 
• Year of birth (approximate age); 
• Native language;  
• Reported need for third molar surgery. 
Collection of demographic informat ion is subject to all applicable local regulations.  
9.3.2 Medical history 
Medical history findings ( i.e. previous diagnoses, diseases or surgeries) meeting all criteria 
listed below will be collected  as available to the investigator : 
• Started  before signing of the informed consent; 
• Considered relevant for the  subject’s study eligibility . 
Detailed instructions on the differentiation between (i)  medical history and (ii)  adverse events 
can be found in Section 9.6.1.1.

Reference Number: BHC- RD-OI-107 
Supplement: Version 5  9.3.3 Other baseline characteristics 
Information on caffeine, smoking, drug and alcoho l consumption will be collected.  Surgical 
data ( tooth number and diagnosis of each extraction, duration of surgery  in minutes  (first 
incision to last suture), identity and amount of all surgical medications, will be collected . 
9.4 Efficacy Analysis 
For each postdose timepoint, P ain Intensity D ifferences (PID) will be derived by subtracting 
the pain intensity at the  postdose timepoint from the baseline intensity score (baseline score – 
post- baseline score).  A positive difference is indicative of improvement.  Time -weighted sum 
of pain intensity differences (SPIDs) will be calculated for 4, 8, 12, 6-12, and 24 hours by 
multiplying the PID score at each postdose timepoint by the duration (in hours) since the 
preceding timepoint and then summing these values over 4, 8, 12, 6- 12, and 24 hours, 
respectively.  Similarly, total pain relief scores (TOTPARs), will be calculat ed by multiplying 
the pain relief score at each postdose timepoint by the duration (in hours) since the preceding timepoint and then summing these values. 
In all analyses, for subjects who take rescue medication, all pain intensity scores after intake 
of rescue medication will be replaced by the worse of the baseline or the score assessed immediately before taking rescue medication. All pain relief after intake of rescue medication will be replaced by “no relief” (0).  
A complete list of primary, secondary a nd other efficacy parameters can be found in S ection 
10.3. 
9.4.1 Safety Analysis 
Safety measures will be analyzed for all subjects in the safety population.    
Adverse events will be collected throughout the treatment and safety follow-up periods and will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary.  
Only treatment-emergent AEs will be included, i.e., AEs that begin or worsen after the first dose of the investigational products in the treatment period.  The number and percent of subjects who experience any event, by System Organ Class (SOC), and by Preferred Term will be displayed by treatment group.  Tables will also be produced by severity and relationship to investigational product. Seriousness, severity, relationship to investigational product, duration, and outcome will also be listed.

9.6.1 Adverse events  
9.6.1.1  Definitions 
Definition of adverse event (AE)  
In a clinical study, an AE is  any untoward medical occurrence (i.e.  any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a subject or 
clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study.   Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of 
a medicinal (investigational) product.   
A surgical procedure that was planned prior to the start of the study by any physician treating the subject should not be recorde d as an AE (however, the condition for which the surgery is 
required may be an AE).  
In the following differentiation between medical history and AEs, the term “condition” may include abnormal e.g., physical examinati on findings, symptoms, diseases. 
• Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which no symptoms or treatment are present until signing of informed consent are recorded as medical 
history (e.g., seasonal al lergy without acute complaints); 
• Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which symptoms or 
treatment are present after signing of informed consent, at unchanged intensity , are 
recorded as medical history  (e.g., allergic pollinosis) ; 
• Conditions that started or deteriorated after signing of informed consent will be 
documented as adverse events .  This includes intercurrent illnesses.  
Definition of serious adverse event (SAE)  
An SAE  is classified as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, meets any of the 
following criteria (a  – f): 
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening  
The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the subject 
was at risk of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 Clinical Study Protocol 19762 Page 33 of 55  
Version 3.0 / 15 -Feb-2018  
  
 
Reference Number: BHC- RD-OI-107 
Supplement: Version 5  c. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
A hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization will not be regarded as an SAE if 
at least one of the following exceptions is met: 
- The admission results in a hospital stay of less than 12 hours 
- The admission is pre-planned  
(e.g., elective or sched uled surgery arranged prior to the start of the study ; 
admission is part of the study procedures as described in Section  9.2) 
- The admission is not associated with an AE  
(e.g., social hospitalization for purposes of respite care). 
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospitalization may fulfill the criterion of ‘medically important’ and as such may be reportable as an SAE dependent on clinical judgment.  In addition, where local regulatory authorities specifically require a more stringent definition, the local regulation takes precedence.  
d. Results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity  
Disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life’s 
functions.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly / birth defect  
f. Is another serious or important medical event as judged  by the investigator  
9.6.1.2  Classifications for adverse event assessment 
All AEs will be assessed and documented by the investigator according to the categories detailed below.   
9.6.1.2.1  Seriousness 
For each AE, the seriousness must be determined according to the criteria given in 
Section  9.6.1.1. 
 Clinical Study Protocol 19762 Page 34 of 55  
Version 3.0 / 15 -Feb-2018  
  
 
Reference Number: BHC- RD-OI-107 
Supplement: Version 5  9.6.1.2.2  Intensity 
The intensity of an AE is classified according to the following categories: 
• Mild : Presents with signs and symptoms easily tolerated, does not need treatment, or 
prolonged hospitalization and does not necessarily require stopping the drug; 
• Moderate:  A type of adverse event that is usually alleviated with additional specific 
therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research participant; 
• Severe: A type of adverse event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention. The event 
interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status. The event 
possesses a significant risk of harm to the research participant and hospitalization may be 
required. 
 
9.6.1.2.3  Causal relationship  
The assessment of the causal relationship betw een an AE and the administration of treatment 
is a decision to be made by the investigator, who is a qualified physician  or dentist/ oral 
surgeon, based on all information available at the time  of the completion of the CRF/eCRF  
data collection system . 
The assessment is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship” 
to the study treatment in question.  
Possible answers are “yes” or “no”  
An assessment of “no” would include: 
1. The existence of a highly likely  alternative explanation , e.g. , mechanical bleeding at 
surgical site.  
or 
2. Non-plausibility, e.g., the subject is struck by an automobile when there is no 
indication that the drug caused disorientation that may have caused the event; cancer developing a few days after the first drug administration. 
An assessment of “yes” indicates that that the AE is reasonably associated with the use of the 
study treatment.  
Important factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to study treatment include: 
- The temporal sequence from drug administration:  The event should occur after the drug is given .  The length of time from drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the 
clinical context of the event.  
- Recovery on drug discontinuation (de- challenge), recurrence on drug re-introduction 
(re-challenge):   Subject’s response after de- challenge or re -challenge should be 
considered in view of the usual clinical course of the event in question. 
- Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases:   Each event should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other disease the subject may have.

Version 3.0 / 15 -Feb-2018  
  
 
Reference Number: BHC- RD-OI-107 
Supplement: Version 5  - Concomitant medication or treatment:  
The other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject receives should be 
examined to determine whether any of them might have caused the event in question. 
- Known response pattern for this class of drug: Clinical/preclinical  
- Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses: The exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the recipient and provide a logical and better explanation for the event 
- The pharmacology and pharm acokinetics of the study treatment:  
The pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) of the study treatment, coupled with the individual subject’s pharmacodynamics should be considered. 
- The assessment is not possible 
Causal relationship to  protocol- required procedure(s)  
The assessment of a possible causal relationship between the AE and protocol-required procedure(s) is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship” to protocol-required procedure(s).  
Possible answers are “yes” or “no”  
9.6.1.2.4  Action taken with study treatment  
Any action on study treatment to resolve the AE is to be documented using the categories listed below.  
The study treatment action should be recorded separately for each study treatment as detailed in the CRF/eCRF  data collection system . 
- Drug withdrawn  
- Drug interrupted  
- Not applicable 
- Unknown 
9.6.1.2.5  Other specific treatment(s) of adverse events

- Recovered/resolved with sequelae  
- Not recovered/not resolved 
- Fatal  
- Unknown 
9.6.1.3  Assessments and documentation of adverse events 
AEs observed, mentioned upon open questioning by a member of the investigator’s team or 
spontaneously reported by the subject will be documented. The observation phase for AEs 
will start with signing the informed consent form and will end in general with the last visit of follow-up. After the end of follow- up there is no requirement to actively collect AEs.  
In case of ongoing AEs after the last follow -up visit – especially when related to treatment 
with the study medication – the respective AE will be follo wed until resolution, if possible. 
The type of information that should be assessed and recorded by the investigator for each AE is listed in Section  9.6.1.2. 
For all SAEs the sponsor has to carry out a separate assessment for expectedness, seriousness and causal relationship to treatment with the study medication.  
The investigator has to record on the respective CRF/eCRF  data collection system all adverse 
events occurring in the period between the signing of the informed consent and the end of the Follow-up Visit, there is no requirement to actively collect AEs including deaths.  The type of 
information that should be assessed and recorded by the inves tigator for each AE is listed in 
Section  9.6.1.2.   
“Death” should not be recorded as an AE on the AE page.  Instead, “death” is the outcome of underlying AE(s).  
For all serious adverse events (SAEs) the sponsor has to carry out a separate assessment for expectedness, seriousness and causal relationship to study drug. 
9.6.1.4  Reporting of serious  adverse events and pregnancy  
The definition of serious adve rse events (SAEs) is given in Section  9.6.1.1.  Each SAE must 
be followed up until resolution or stabilization by submission of updated reports to the designated recipient.  
Investigator’s notification of the sponsor 
All investigators will be thoroughly instructed and trained on all relevant aspects of the 
investigator’s reporting obligations for SAEs.  This information, including all relevant contact details, is summarized in the investigator site file.  This information will be updated as needed.   For clarity it might be useful to state that a pregnancy is to be captured as an SAE 
The investigator must report immediately (within 24  hours of the inves tigator’s awareness) a ll 
SAEs occurring during the observation period defined in Section 9.6.1.3 to the recipient

AE page in the CRF/eCRF  data collection system  as well as the complementary pa ges 
provided in the Investigator File must be completed for each SAE .   
Pregnancy occurring during a clinical investigation, although not considered a serious adverse 
event, must be reported to Bayer within the same timelines as a serious adverse event on a Pregnancy Monitoring Form.  The outcome of a pregnancy should be followed up carefully and any abnormal outcome of the mother or the child should be reported.  This also applies to pregnancies following the administration of the investigational product to the father prior to sexual intercourse.  Send the completed SAE or pregnancy forms to: 
 or Fax:  (in the USA)  
SAEs occurring after the protocol-defined observation period will be processed by the sponsor acc
ording to all applicable regulations. 
Notification of the IRB  
Notification of the Institutional Review Board ( IRB) about all relevant events ( e.g., SAEs, 
suspected, unexpected, serious adverse reactions [ SUSARs ]) will be performed by the 
sponsor and/or by the investigator according to all applicable regulations. 
Notification of the authorities 
The processing and reporting of all relevant events ( e.g., SAEs, SUSARs) to the authorities 
will be done by the sponsor accordin g to all applicable regulations.  
Sponsor’s notification of the investigational site The sponsor will inform the investigational site about reported relevant events ( e.g., SUSARs) 
according to all applicable regulations. 
9.6.1.5  Expected adverse events 
For this stu dy, the applicable reference document is the most current version of the package 
insert for naproxen and ibuprofen.  If relevant new safety information is identified, the 
information will be integrated into an update of the safety information  and distribut ed to all 
participating sites.  
The expectedness of AEs will be determined by the sponsor according to the applicable reference document and according to all local regulations. 
9.6.2 Pregnancies 
A subject’s participation is to be terminated immediately if a pregn ancy is supposed  (i.e. 
in case her pregnancy test becomes positive).   
The investigator must report to the sponsor any pregnancy occurring in a female study subject 
during her participation in this study.  The outcome of the pregnancy should be followed up 
carefully, and any outcome of the mother and the child at delivery should be reported. 
For a pregnancy in the partner of a male study subject, all efforts  will be made to obtain 
similar information on course and outcome, subject to the partner’s consent.

Supplement: Version 5  10.3 Efficacy Analysis 
For each postdose timepoint, P ain Intensity D ifferences (PID) will be derived by subtracting 
the pain intensity at the postdose timepoint from the baseline intensity score (baseline score – 
post- baseline score).  A positive difference is indicative of improvement.  Time -weighted 
Sum of P ain Intensity D ifferences (SPIDs) will be calculated for 4, 8, 12, 6-12 and 24 hours 
by multiplying the PID score at each postdose timepoint by the duration (in hours) since the preceding timepoint and then summing these valu es over 4, 8, 12, 6- 12 and  24 hours, 
respectively.  Similarly, Total Pain Relief Scores (TOTPARs), will be calculated by 
multiplying the pain relief score at each postdose timepoint by the duration (in hours) since the preceding timepoint and then summing these values.  
In all analyses, for subjects who take rescue medication, all pain intensity scores after intake of rescue medication will be replaced by the worse of the baseline or the score assessed immediately before taking rescue medication. All pain re lief after intake of rescue medication 
will be replaced by “no relief” (0).  
10.3.1  Primary Efficacy Parameter 
The primary efficacy analyses population will be based on the PP population. 
The primary efficacy parameter is defined as:  
• Time to first use of rescue m edication.  If a subject did not take the rescue medication 
during the treatment period, (s)he will be censored at the time of last assessment. Time 
to first use of rescue medication will be estimated and plotted using Kaplan -Meier 
method and analyzed using log- rank test stratified by cente r and baseline pain 
intensity.  
10.3.2  Secondary Efficacy Parameters 
The secondary efficacy variables include:  
• SPID  0-24 and TOTPAR 0 -24 will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance model 
(ANCOVA) with treatment as fixed effe ct and baseline pain intensity score as the 
covariate.  A 95% of confidence interval (CI) for the treatment differences will be calculated based on the above mentioned model. 
10.3.3  Other Efficacy Para meters  
• The SPID  0-4, 0-8, 0- 12, 6-12 will be analyzed using the same methodology as for 
SPID 0 -24. 
• TOTPAR 0-4, 0-8, 0-12, and TOTPAR  6-12 will be analyzed using the same 
methodology as for SPID 0-24. 
• Pain Intensity Difference (PID) and Pain Relief scores at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 
10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24 hours postdose. Descriptive statistics for each timepoint and graphical illustrations of the time effect curves will be presented.  
• The cumulative proportion taking rescue medication by timepoint will be analyzed 
using Chi- square tests and time -effect curves will be generated.  Frequency tables will 
be generated for the number of times the subject took rescue medication over the 24 
hour period by treatment group.

Supplement: Version 5  • Percent of subjects with Pain Half Gone (Yes / No question) by 24 hours will be 
summar ized  descriptively by treatment group . 
• The proportion of subjects with pain at least one- half gone at each time point  will be 
summarized descriptively and plotted over time by treatment group;  
• Duration of time that subjects reported their pain was at least half gone;  
• Total amount of time that subject reported at least a 2 -point PID; 
• Global A ssessment  of the investigational product as a pain reliever.  This variable will 
be analyzed using CMH method with modified ridit score.  The proportion of subjects 
in each surgery will also be presented.  
Safety and Tolerability 
AEs will be collected from screening throughout the Treatment Phase and Follow-up Phase 
and will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Only treatment-emergent AEs w ill be included, i.e., AEs that begin or worsen after the first dose of the 
investigational medicinal product ( IMP) in the Treatment Phase.  The number and percent of 
subjects who experience any event and the number of events overall, by System Organ Class, 
and by Preferred Term will be displayed by treatm ent period and treatment group.  Tables will 
also be produced by severity and relationship to each IMP. Seriousness, severity, relationship 
to each IMP duration, and outcome will also be listed. 
Quantitative data for blood pressure, heart rate, body weight, body temperature will be 
described by summary statistics for the original data as well as f or the differences to baseline.  
Frequency tables will be provided for qualitative data. Laboratory data outside the reference range will be listed and highlighted with ‘L’ for low and ‘H’ for high. An additional table with all abnormal values will be presented.  
Listings of individual su bject data (e.g., vital signs) will be provided.  
10.4 Determination of sample size 
The objective of this study is to establish superiority of naproxen sodium 440 mg over 24 
hours compared to  ibuprofen 400 mg over 24 hours with respect to the time to rescue medication .   
 
 
 
A total of 385 subjects will be randomized 
into the study if a drop-out rate of 5% is assumed.

investigator without agreement by both parties.  However, the investigator or the sponsor may implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to the t rial subjects without prior IRB/sponsor approval/favorable opinion.  As soon as 
possible, the implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it and if appropriate the proposed protocol amendment should be submitted to the IRB/ head of medical 
institution/sponsor.  Any deviations from the protocol must be explained and documented by the investigator.  
Details on discontinuatio n of the entire study or parts thereof can be found in Section 12. 
13.4 Subject information and consent /assent 
All relevant information on the study will be summarized in an integrated subject information 
sheet and informed consent form provided by the sponsor or the study center.  S ample subject 
information and informed consent /assent  form s are provided as a docum ent separate to this 
protocol.  Subjects  16 to 17 years old who cannot legally give informed consent for research 
participation must use an IRB -approved assent form and a Parental/Guardian informed 
consent form.  Informed consent must first be obtained from the child’s parent or legal guardian before assent may be obtained from the child. 
Based on this subject information sheet, the investigator or designee will explain all relevant 
aspects of the study to each subject  prior to his/her entry into the study ( i.e. before any 
examinations and procedur es associated with the selection for the study are performed or any 
study-specific data is recorded on study- specific forms).  
The investigator will also mention that written approval of the IRB has been obtained. 
Each subject will be  informed about the fol lowing aspects of premature withdrawal:  
• Each subject has the right to withdraw from the study at any time without any 
disadvantage and without having to provide reasons for this decision;   
• The subject ’s consent covers EOT  examinations  as specified in the visit description  
described in Section  9.2.6 to be conducted after withdrawal  of consent; 
• The subject’s data that have been collected until the time of withdrawal will be retained 
and statistically analyzed  in accordance with the statistical analysis plan; 
• Subject -specific data on the basis of material obtained before withdrawal may be 
generated after withdrawal (e.g. , image reading, analysis of biological specimen such as 
blood, urine or tissues); these data would also be retained and statistically analyzed in 
accordance with the statistical analysis plan.  The subject has the right to object to the 
generation and processing of this post-withdrawal data.  For this, he/she needs to sign a corresponding declaration of objection; alternatively, the subject’s oral objection may be documented in the subject’s source data.

Only if the subject agrees to sig n the informed consent form and has done so, may he/she 
enter the study.  Additionally, the investigator will personally sign and date the form.  The 
subject will receive a copy of the signed and dated form.  
The signed informed consent statement is to remain in the investigator site file or, if locally 
required, in the subject ’s note/file of the medical institution.  
In the event that informed consent is obtained on the date that baseline study procedures are performed, the study record or subject´s clinical record must clearly show that informed consent was obtained prior to these procedures. 
For minors or adults under legal protection, consent shall be given by the legal guardian(s). 
The consent of a minor or adult under legal protection shall also be reque sted where such a 
person is able to express his/her own will. His/her refusal or the withdrawal of his/her consent may not be disregarded. 
The informed consent form and any other written information provided to subjects will be 
revised whenever important new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s consent, or there is an amendment to the protocol that necessitates a change to the content of the subject information and / or the written informed consent form.  The investigator will inform the subject of changes in a timely manner and will ask the subject to confirm his/her participation in the study by signing the revised informed consent form.  Any revised written informed consent form and written i nformation must receive the IRB`s  
approval / favorable opinion in advance of use. 
13.5 Publication policy and use of data 
The sponsor will make  the information regarding the study publicly available on the internet 
at www.clinicaltrials.gov  as applicable to local regulations. 
All data and results and all intellectual property rights in the data and results derived from the study will be the property of the sponsor who may utilize them in various ways, such as for submission to government regulatory authorities or disclosure to other investigators. 
Regarding public disclosure of study results, the sponsor will fulfill its obligations according 
to all applicable laws and regulations.  The sponsor is interested in the publication of the results of e very study it performs.   
The sponsor recognizes the right of the investigator to publish the results upon completion of the study.  However, the investigator, whilst free to utilize study data derived from his/her 
center  for scientific purposes, must obtain written consent of the sponsor on the intended 
publication manuscript before its submission.  To this end, the investigator must send a draft of the publication manuscript to the sponsor within a time period specified in the contract.

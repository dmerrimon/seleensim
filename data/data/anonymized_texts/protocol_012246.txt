Confidential   Page 29 of 58 9 ADVERSE EVENTS  
9.1 Adverse Event  
For the purposes of this trial, an adverse event is defined as any untoward medical event 
occurring after the subject’s signing of the informed consent  until they are exited from 
the trial. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, 
symptom, or disease occurring after the subject started th e clinical trial , without any 
judgment about causality. Any pre -existing medical condition that worsens during the 
trial will also be considered a new adverse event . Documentation r egarding the adverse 
event should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, severity, relationship to 
study procedure, expectedness, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign 
or symptom observed by the investigator or reported by the patient upon indirect 
questioning.  
9.1.1 Severity  
Severity of an adverse event is  defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree 
of intensity of an adverse event as determined by the investigator or reported to 
him/her by the patient/subject. The assessment of severity is made irrespective 
of relationship to study procedures or seriousness of the event and should be 
evaluated according to the following scale:  
•  
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
9.1.2 Relationship to Study Procedures  
The relationship of each AE to the study procedu res should be determined by 
the investigator using these explanations. Decisive factors for the assessment of 
causal relationship of an AE to the study procedures  include, but may not be 
limited to, temporal relationship between the AE and the procedure , known side 
effects of the procedure  medical history, and/or concomitant medication:  
• Definite:  When there are good reason and sufficient documentation to 
demonstrate a direct causal relationship between study procedure  and 
AE; 

Clinical Trial Protocol: ADX -102-DED -019        Ora, Inc.  
  Amendment  3.0 5Nov 2021 
 
 
Confidential   Page 30 of 58 • Probable:  When there are good r easons and sufficient documentation to 
assume a causal relationship in the sense of plausible, conceivable, 
likely but not necessarily highly probable.  
• Possible:  When there is sufficient information to accept the possibility 
of a causal relationship in the  sense of not impossible and not unlikely, 
although the connection is uncertain or doubtful, for example; due to 
missing data or insufficient evidence.  
• None: When there is sufficient information to accept a lack of a causal 
relationship, in the sense of im possible and improbable.  
• Unclassified:  When the causal relationship is not assessable for 
whatever reason due to insufficient evidence, conflicting data or poor 
documentation.  
9.1.3 Expectedness  
The expectedness of an adverse event should be determined based upo n existing 
safety information about the study procedures . Therefore,  the following 
definition will be used:  
• Unexpected : An adverse event that is not listed in the safety information 
available for the study procedure  at the specificity or severity that has 
been observed.  
• Expected : An adverse event that is listed in the safety information 
available for the study procedure at the specificity and severity that has 
been observed.  
• Not Applicable : Any adverse event that is unrelated to the study 
procedure . 
9.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An adverse event is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or 
Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death;  
• A life -threatening advers e event;  
o Note: An adverse event is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view 
of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or 
subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event 
that, had it occurred in a  more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  
Clinical Trial Protocol: ADX -102-DED -019        Ora, Inc.  
  Amendment  3.0 5Nov 2021 
 
 
Confidential   Page 31 of 58 o Note: The term “inpatient hospitalization” refers to any inpatient 
admission (even if less than 24 hours). For chronic or long -term 
inpatient s, inpatient admission includes transfer within the hospital to 
an acute/intensive care inpatient unit. Inpatient hospitalization does not 
include: emergency room visits; outpatient/same -day/ambulatory 
procedures; observation/short stay units; rehabilitati on facilities; 
hospice facilities; nursing homes; or clinical research/phase 1 units.  
o Note: The term “prolongation of existing hospitalization” refers to any 
extension of an inpatient hospitalization beyond the stay anticipated or 
required for the reason f or the initial admission as determined by the 
investigator or treating physician.  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions;  
o Note: A serious adverse event specifically related to visual  threat would 
be interpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s 
eyes (e.g., hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central corneal ulcer or 
damage to the optic nerve).  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not re sult in death, are life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outco mes listed in this definition.  
9.3 Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events  
All adverse events and their outcomes must be reported to Ora and the IRB as required 
by the IRB, federal, state, or local regulations and governing health authorities and 
recorded on t he appropriate source document . 
9.3.1 Reporting a Suspected Unexpected Adverse Reaction  
All adverse events that are related (definite, probable, possible)  and 
‘unexpected’ are to be reported to Ora and the IRB as required by the IRB, 
federal, state, or local regulations and governing health authorities.  
9.3.2 Reporting a Serious Adverse Event  
To ensure subject safety, all serious adverse events, regardless of rel ationship 
to the investigational product, must be immediately reported. All information 
relevant to the serious adverse event must be recorded on the appropriate source 
documents . The investigator is obligated to pursue and obtain information 
requested by Ora in addition to that information reported on the source

up and the outcome reported.  
In the event of a serious adverse event, the investigator must notify Ora 
immediately; obta in and maintain in his/her files all pertinent medical records, 
information, and medical judgments from colleagues who assisted in the 
treatment and follow -up of the subject; provide Ora with a complete case 
history  and inform the IRB of the adverse event within their guidelines for 
reporting serious adverse events.

9.4 Procedures for Unmasking Study Drug  
All subjects, investigators, and study personnel involved with the conduct of the study  
will be masked with regard to  treatment assignments. When medically necessary, the 
investigator may need to determine what treatment arm has been assigned to a subject.  
When possible (i.e., in non -emergent situations), Ora and/or the study sponsor should be 
notified, when possible, b efore unmasking study drug as described in the following 
paragraph.  
If an investigator identifies a medical need for unmasking the treatment assignment of a 
subject, he/she should contact Ora and/or the medical monitor prior to unmasking the identity 
of the IP, if possible. Ora will ask the site to complete and send them the Unmasking Request 
Form. Ora will notify Aldeyra and jointly will determine if the unmasking request should be 
granted. They may consult the medical monitor as needed. The result of the request will be 
documented on the Unmasking Request Form. If approval is granted to unmask a subject, 
written permission via the  
 
Unmasking Request Form will be provided to the investigator. The investigator will unmask 
the subject via scratch off labels on the kits for the Initial Cohort Only. The investigator will 
unmask the subject using IWRS  for the Main Cohort . The investigator will complete the 
Unmasking  Memo form and include it in the s ubject’s study file and provide a copy for the 
Trial  Master File (TMF). For each unmasked request, the reason, date, signature, and name 
of the person who unmasked the subject, must be noted in the subject’s study file.

information), it is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that the amended 
informed consent is reviewed and approved by sponsor  prior to submission to 
the governing IRB and that it is read , signed and dated by all subjects 
subsequently enrolled in the study as well as those currently enrolled in the 
study.  If informed consent is taken under special circumstances (oral informed 
consent), then the procedures to be followed must be determined by Ora and 
provided in writing by Ora prior to the consent process .

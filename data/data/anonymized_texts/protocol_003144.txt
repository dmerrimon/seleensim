CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 6of 97PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS
Title of the Study
Phase I, Randomized, Open label, Three -arm, Single Dose, Parallel Group Study  to Com pare 
AZD7442 (AZD8895 + AZD1061) Pharmacokinetic Exposu re Fo llowing Intramuscular 
Administrati on as a Co -formulation versus Administration fro m Two Separate Vials o f the 
Individual Monoclonal Ant ibodies in Adult Healt hy Part icipants
Study Center
This study  will be conducted at a minimum of three different Clinical Units.
Study Rationale
The study  will assess pharmacokinet ic (PK) comparabilit y between different formulat ions of 
AZD7442, which is a combinat ion of two individual monoclo nal ant ibodies (mAbs), 
AZD8895 and AZD1061. The materialsto be assessed wi ll be:
A co -formulation of  clonal cell  line materi al of AZD8895 + AZD1061 mAbs as a single 
intramuscular (IM) inject ion from a single mixture,
Individual formulat ions of clonal cell  line materi al of AZD8895 and AZD1061 mAbs as 
separate sequent ial IM inject ions, and
Individual formulat ions of cell pool  material of AZD8895 and AZD1061 mAbs as 
separate sequent ial IM inject ions.
An open label, parallel group design has been chosen for this single dose PK comparabilit y 
study .
Number of Participants Planned
Approximately  207 evaluable participants will be enro lled in this study.
Study Period
Estimated date of first participant enrolled: November 2021 (signing of informed consent)
Estimated date of last participant completed: Q32023
Clinical Study Protocol AstraZeneca
AZD7442 –D8850C00009 10June 2022
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 8of 97Treatment Groups:
Treatment A : 300 m g (total  protein) AZD7442 as a single IM dose (co -formulation of 
150mg AZD8895 + 150 mg AZD1061) (clonal cell line material).
Treatment B : 300 mg (total protein) AZD7442 as two separate IM doses of the 
individual mAbs (150 mg AZD8895 and then 150 mg AZD1061) (clonal cell line 
materi al).
Treatment C : 300 m g (total  protein) AZD7442 as two separate IM doses of the 
individual mAbs (150 mg AZD8895 and then 150 mg AZD1061) (cell pool m aterial).
The product in Treatment Groups A and B is derived fro m material that ori ginated from a 
clonal cell  line, wi th a separate cell line, GMP cell bank, and manufacturing process for 
AZD8895 and AZD1061. The product in Treatment Group C is derived fr om material that 
originated from a non -clonal cell  pool , with a separate pool of cells, GMP cell bank, and 
manufacturing process for AZD8895 and AZD1061. The clonal cell line is derived from a 
subpopulation of the respect ive cell pool, and there are no dif ferences in antibody sequence 
between these cell banks. These materials have been demo nstrated to be analyt ically 
comparable to each other.
Addit ionally , within each of the treatment groups, participants will be rando mized 1:1:1 to 
inject ion sites of later al thigh, gl uteal  dorsal , or gl uteal  ventral . The study  will then also 
further be stratified by body  weight category  (< 70 kg; 70 to < 80 kg; and ≥ 80 kg) and anti-
SARS -CoV -2 vaccinat ion status (non -vaccinated or vaccinated).
After a Screening Period of up to 28 day s, eligible parti cipants will present themselves at the 
study clinic on Day 1. Parti cipants will be randomized to one of the three treatment groups to 
receive their dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP) (AZD7442 as either a single IM 
dose or two separate IM doses). Following an observat ion and PK and pharmacodynamic 
(PD) sampling period of approximately  8hours post -dose, participants will be discharged 
from the Clinical Unit at the discret ion of the investigator. During the Fo llow-up Pe riod of  
approximately  1year, participants will return for a total of 11 outpatient fo llow-up visit s 
starting on Day  2 through to Day  361. At the fo llow-up visits, data on adverse events (AEs) 
and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be co llected in addit ionto collect ion of blood samples 
for PK, PD, and ADA assessments.
On the day  of IMP administrati on (Day  1), partici pants shoul d follow a diet, whi ch excl udes 
all alcoho l (from at least 72 hours pri or to dosing) and caffeinated products (from at least 
24 hours pri or to dosing). Participants are not required to abstain fro m food and drink intake 
until 45 minutes to 1 hour before IMP administration.
Expected Duration of the Study
The total duration of the study  for a parti cipant will  be approximately  389 days c omprising of 
a Screening Period that can last up to 28 day s, Treatm ent Peri od of  1 day , and a Follow
-up 
Period of  360 days.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 11of 97Determination of Sample Size:
Preliminary analysis o f PK data fr om the first -in-human study , D8850C00001, indicated that 
after an IM dose of IMP (separate AZD8895 and then AZD1061 doses) at a dose of 300 mg 
total protein, the coefficients of variat ion (CV%) for Cmax of the individual mAbs, AZD8895 
and AZD1061, were 35. 6% and 38.5%, respectively, while the CV% for AUCs of both 
individual mAbs, AZD8895 and AZD1061 were < 36.4%. Therefore, assuming a mean ratio 
of 1 between co mparators, 69 participants per group will provide at least 95% power to 
demonstrate com parabili ty (90% CI contained within 0.8 and 1.25).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 22of 971. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Background
Coronaviruses are spher ical, enveloped viruses with posit ive-sense single- stranded RNA 
geno mes. One fourth of their genome is responsible for coding structural proteins, such as the 
spike glycoprotein, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins. Envelope, membrane, 
and nucleo capsid proteins are mainly responsible for virio n assembly, while the spike protein 
is involved in receptor binding, mediat ing virus entry  into host cells during coronavirus 
infect ion via different receptors ( Li2016).
Severe Acute Respiratory  Syndrome Corona Virus 2 is a coronavirus responsible for the 
current COVID -19 global pandemic. SARS -CoV -2 belo ngs to the phylogenetic lineage B of 
the genus Beta -coronavirus and it recognizes the ACE2 as the entry  receptor 
(Zhou et
al2020). Several  new SARS -CoV -2 vari ants have been identified: the Alpha variant 
(B.1.1.7), the Beta variant (B.1.351), the Gamma variant (P.1), the Delta variant (B.1617.2) 
and the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) 
(USCDC 2021; US CDC 2022 ; WHO 2021). These 
variants contain mult iple spike protein mutations and mutations in oth er geno mic regions.
AZD7442 is a combinat ion product of two mAbs (AZD8895 and AZD1061) directed against 
RBD of the SARS -CoV -2 spi ke protein for neutralizat ion of the virus. The two component 
mAbs bind unique, non -
overlapping epitopes on the RBD of the vira l spike protein. The use of 
two such mAbs provides redundancy in protection in case o f virus mutation and escape. In 
response to the emergence of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 SARS- CoV -2 strains, preliminary in 
vitro neutralizat ion assays demo nstrated that the t wo com ponent mAbs neutralized both 
emergent strains.
AZD8895 and AZD1061 mAbs have been engineered with triple amino acid subst itutions 
(YTE) in the Fc region to prolong the half -life, which is expected to confer protection from 
COVID -19 for a duration of at least 5 months. An addit ional tri ple amino acid substitution 
(TM) in the Fc region was engineered for both AZD8895 and AZD1061 to reduce Fc 
mediated effector funct ion, which is expected to reduce theoretical risk of ant ibody -dependent 
enhancement of dis ease. Im portantly , incorporati on of  these YTE and TM substitutions did 
not alter the neutralizat ion potency  of AZD7442 in vi tro.
A detailed description o f the chemistry , pharmaco logy, efficacy , and safet y of AZD7442 is 
provi ded in the IB.

3.1. Overall Study Design and Flow Chart
This study  will be an open label , randomized, three -arm, parallel group, single dose, study  in 
healt hy participants (males and females), performed at mult iple study  centers.
A total o f 207 evaluable healt hy male and female participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 
ratio between the three treatment groups (69 participants per group). Each participant will 
receive AZD7442 as either a single IM dose (co -formulation; AZD8895 + AZD1061) from a 
single vial or as two separate IM doses of the individual mAbs (AZD8895 and then 
AZD1061) from two separate vials fro m either clonal cell  line material  or cell pool  material as 
follows:
Treatment A : 300 m g (total  protein) AZD7442 as a single IM dose (co -formulation of 
150mg AZD8895 + 150 mg AZD1061) (clonal cell line material).
Treatment B : 300 mg (total protein) AZD7442 as two separate IM doses of the 
individual mAb s (150 mg AZD8895 and then 150 mg AZD1061) (clonal cell line 
materi al).
Treatment C : 300 m g (total  protein) AZD7442 as two separate IM doses of the 
individual mAbs (150 mg AZD8895 and then 150 mg AZD1061) (cell pool material).
The product in Treatment Gro ups A and B is derived fro m material that ori ginated from a 
clonal cell  line, wi th a separate cell line, GMP cell bank, and manufacturing process for 
AZD8895 and AZD1061. The product in Treatment Group C is derived fro m material that 
originated from a non -clonal cell  pool , with a separate pool of cells, GMP cell bank, and 
manufacturing process for AZD8895 and AZD1061. The clonal cell line is derived from a 
subpopulation of the respect ive cell pool, and there are no differences in antibody sequence 
between t hese cell banks. These materials have been demo nstrated to be analyt ically 
comparable to each other. Refer to Table 5-1for details on the IMP.
Addit ionally , within each of the treatment groups, participants will be rando mized 1:1:1 to one 
of the three inject ion sites:
Lateral  thigh,
Gluteal  dorsal ,
Gluteal  ventral .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 32of 973.1.1. Order of Assessments
It is important that PK sampling occurs as close as possible to scheduled time. In order to 
achieve this, other assessments scheduled at the same time may be init iated prior to the 
time point. Another aspect for the proposed timing is that phy siological assessments such as 
heart rate or blood pressure as well as inquiring for AEs should not be accidentally influenced 
by physical intervent ions such as a venous puncture. The sequence at a particular time point 
is:
1Electrocardiograms
2Vital signs (blood pressure and pulse)
3Pharmacokinet ic blood sampling
Details o f acceptable tol erance windows for safet y, PK and PD assessments will be included 
in a WAD which will be agreed upon and signed off before the start of the study . Parti cipants 
shoul d be counseled to be available for repeat sampling within the windows of allowance, if 
requi red.
3.1.2. End of Study
The end o f study  is defined as the last participant’s last visit to the study  Clinical Uni t.
3.1.3. Expected Du ration of the Study
Each participant will be invo lved in the study  for approximately  1year.
3.2. Rationales for Study Design and Dose Selection
3.2.1. Rationale for Study Design
An open label, parallel group design has been chosen for this single dose PK comparabilit y 
study .
The study  will assess PK comparabili ty between different formulat ions of AZD7442, which is 
a combinat ion of two individual mAbs, AZD8895 and AZD1061. The materials to be assessed 
will be:
A co -formulation of  clonal cell  line materi al of AZD8895 + AZD1061 mAbs as a single 
IM inject ion from a single mixture,

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 33of 973.2.2. Dose Rationale
The 300 m g (total  protein) IM dose selected for investigation in this study  is the ant icipated 
therapeuti c dose for prophylaxis o f COVID -19. The data generated on the 300 mg IM dose is 
also expected to support a single IM dose of 600 mg for treatment of mild to moderate 
COVID -19 as the 600 mg dose (co -formulation) will be administered as two IM inject ions of 
300mg each.
3.3. Risk -benefit Assessment
Detailed informat ion about the known and expected benefit sand potenti al risks of AZD7442 
may be found in the IB.
3.3.1. Description of AZD7442
AZD7442 is a combinat ion product of two mAbs: tixagevimab (AZD8895) and cilgavimab 
(AZD1061) that are neutralizing mAbs that bind specifically to the RBD of the SARS -CoV -2 
spikeprotein. Neither mAb has any  human target. There are no potential risks based on 
mechanism o f action.
3.3.2. Clinical Phar macokinetics
Measured serum AZD8895 and AZD1061 concentrations support that the PK of these mAbs 
are similar to each other and are consisten t with what has been observed for another IgG1κ 
mAb that has been engineered to include YTE amino acid subst itutions to extend the half -life 
(Griffin etal2017) . Therefore, the half -life of AZD7442 is est imated to be approximately
90days which will allow for long -term protecti on.
3.3.3. Adverse Events, Contraindications and Warnings
Potenti al risks of AZD7442 are those that are associated with the administration of any 
immunogl obulin, including po lyclo nal immunogl obulin preparat ions and mAbs. The 
important potential risks associated with the administration of immunoglobulin, include, but 
are not limit edto, anaphylaxis and other serious hypersensit ivity react ions including immune 
complex disease. Other potential risks include, but are not limit ed to, inject ion site reactions, 
infusio n
-related reacti ons, and ADE disease.
Antibody -dependent enhancement of disease is a theoretical risk. Two different syndromes 
exist:
1Antibody -dependent enhanced disease that invo lves increased binding efficiency of 
virus -antibody  com plexes to Fc receptor bearing cells and which triggers virus entry . The 
mAbs in AZD7442 have b een designed with a modificat ion to prevent binding to cellular 
Fc receptors, so the risk of ant ibody -dependent enhanced disease occurring via this 
mechanism should range fro m very l ow to none.
Clinical Study Protocol AstraZeneca
AZD7442 –D8850C00009 10June 2022
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 34of 972Vaccine -associated enhanced respiratory  disease, which is a di stinct clinical syndrome 
that occurred in y oung children in the 1960s when whole inact ivated virus vaccines for 
measles and RSV were tested.
Immunizing wit h limit ing doses of RSV ant igen, especially wit h conform ationally  incorrect 
antigens, can result in two major ty pes of  immuno logical pheno mena:
A relatively high ratio of antibody  that binds but does not neutralize the virus could 
potenti ally resul t in immunogenic cell death and complement activat ion (leading to 
inflammat ion and airway  obstructi on).
Immunizati on wi th who le inact ivated virus vaccines can result in allergic inflammat ion 
characterized by  reacti ons such as increased mucus production, airway  
hyperresponsiveness, and attenuated cy tolytic T cell  activi ty (T hel per 2 cell  immune 
response). This m echanism , induced by vaccines, are not expected to be provoked by  
mAbs.
There are no ident ified risks associated with AZD7442. No observat ions are considered to 
represent expected adverse react ions that would fo rm part of an emerging safet y profile.
Refer to the IB for the most up to date study  safet y findings wit h regards to completed 
AZD7442 administration.

5.1. Participant Enrollment and Randomization
The investigator (or designee) will ensure:
Signed informed consent is obtained fro m each potent ial parti cipant before any study  
specific procedures are performed.
Each potential participant is assigned a unique enrollment number at screening upon 
signing the Inform ed Consent.
The eligibilit y of each parti cipant is in accordance with the inclusio n and exclusio n
criteria.
Each eligible participant is assigned a unique randomizat ion code.
Randomization will be done on Day 1 before IMP dosing. Randomizat ion codes will be 
assigned strict ly sequent ially as parti cipants beco me eligible for rando mizat ion (codes to be 
used wi thout leading zeros). Randomizat ion numbers will be generated within the 
AstraZeneca rando mizat ion system (AZRand).
The enro llment number will be used to ident ify the participant during the screening process 
and throughout study  parti cipat ion, if ap plicable, and will be recorded in the eCRF. This 
number will be composed of two parts: the first part will have 4 digits (fixed) represent ing the 
study  Clinical Uni t site identifier. The second part will have 3 digits (ascending) which will be 
assigned seq uentially wi thin each study  Clinical Uni t starting wi th 001.
If a participant withdraws his/her participat ion in the study, then his/her 
enrollment/rando mizat ion code cannot be reused. For each treatment sequence, an addit ional 
set of rando m numbers will b e generated wi th AZRand.
5.1.1. Re-screening
Rescreening is permitted only wit h the prior approval of the Medical Monitor if  the participant
has not m et the eligibilit y criteria within the screening period and/or the reason for screen 
failure was transient (including but not limited to study  equi pment f ailure, unforeseen personal 
events that mandate missed screening visit). Each participant ca n be re -screened only  once . A 
second re-screening is allowed for parti cipants who do not meet inclusio n criterion 4,per 
investigator discret ion and prior approval o f the Medical Monitor. Re-screened participants 
shoul d be assi gned the sam e part icipant num ber as for the init ial screening. Participants who 
are re -screened are required to sign a new Informed Consent. All procedures fro m screening 
shoul d be repeated.

Upon com pletion of the randomization request form, the rando mizat ion list will be produced 
by the IRT vendor according to AZRand and participants will be rando mized using IRT.
An IRT will be used for randomizat ion to a treatment group and assignment of IMP kit 
numbers. A participant is considered rando mized into the stu dy when the investigator notifies 
the IRT that the participant meets eligibilit y criteria and the IRT provides the assignment of 
the IMP ki t numbers to the participant.
Specific information concerning the use of the IRT will be provided in a separate manua l.
The number of participant ident ifiers generated for the study  will account for the required 
number of rando mized participants per the sample size calculat ion (N = 207, see 
Secti on11.4).
5.2. Procedures for Handling Incorrectly Randomized Participants
Parti cipants who fail  to m eet the inclusio ncriteria or m eet any  exclusio n criterionshoul d not, 
under any  circumstances, be randomized into the study . There can be no exceptions to this 
rule.
Where a participant, who does not meet the select ion criteria, is rando mized in error and this 
is ident ified before dosing, the participant should be withdrawn fro m the study . If a parti cipant 
is wit hdrawn prior to dosing they  will be repl aced.
If a participant, who does not meet the select ion criteria, has been dosed before the error is 
ident ified, the participant should be advised to continue fo llow-up visit s and safet y 
assessments to ensure their safet y. The inves tigator will inform the AstraZeneca Lead 
Physician o f the error immediately.
5.3. Blinding and Procedures for Unblinding the Study
This is an open label study  and blinding is not applicable.
The rando mizat ion lists should be kept in a secure locat ion until data base l ock.
5.4. Study Intervention
Study  intervent ion is defined as any invest igational intervent ion(s), m arketed product(s) or 
placebo intended to be administered to a study  participant according to the study  protocol .

detection. A calibrated temperature monitoring device will be used to record the temperature 
condi tions in the drug storage facilit y. Storage con ditions stated in the IB may be superseded 
by the l abel storage.
AZD7442 must be kept in original packaging until time of preparat ion to prevent prolonged 
light exposure.
The dose of AZD7442 must be prepared by  the investi gators or si te’s designated study  
intervent ion manager using asept ic technique. Total t ime from needle puncture of the study  
intervent ion vial to the start of administration must not exceed:
24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).
4 hours at room temperature.
If the final product is stored at both refrigerated and ambient temperatures, the total time must 
not exceed 24 hours otherwise a new dose must be prepared from new vials. AZD7442 vials 
do not contain preservat ives; any unused portion of the vial must be discarded immediately 
after use .
AstraZeneca will be permitted upon request to audit the supplies, storage, dispensing 
procedures and records, provided that the blind of the study  is not com promised.
5.4.5. Dose and Treatment Regimens
Each participant will receive a single IM dose of AZD7442 o n Day  1 after randomizat ion to 
one of the three treatment groups ( Table 5-2). Addit ionally , within each of the treatment 
groups, participants will be ra ndomized 1:1:1 to inject ion sites o f lateral thigh (vastus 
lateralis), gluteal dorsal, or gluteal ventral.
Parti cipants receiving Treatment A will be administered a dose via a single IM inject ion from 
a single drug product vial.
Parti cipants receiving Treatment B or Treatment C will be administered a dose via two 
separate IM inject ions, each from a separate drug product vial containing AZD8895 or 
AZD1061. AZD8895 is administered first, fo llowed by  AZD1061. If a participant experiences 
an immediate hy persensi tivity react ion after receipt of the first IM inject ion, but before the 
second IM inject ion, further IMP should not be given.
Parti cipants will be allo wed to drink water until 45 min to 1 hour before dosing to prevent 
dehydrat ion. Water and food will be allowed ad libitum fro m 1hour after the start of dosing.
Clinical Study Protocol AstraZeneca
AZD7442 –D8850C00009 10June 2022
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 47of 97After dosing, participants will remain semi -supine on their bed or sitting (except when 
necessary  for study  procedures) until co mpletion of the Day 1 assessments.
Other restrict ions, including po sture control are described in Sect ion4.2. Data of participants 
may be excluded from the PK analysis set as described in Sect ion11.1.3 .
5.4.6. Dose Preparation and Administration
Each vial selected for dose preparation should be inspected. If there are any  defects noted wi th 
the IMP, the investigator and site monitor should be notified immediately.
No incompat ibilities between AZD7442 and PC or PP sy ringes have been observed.
Commo nly used needles for IM injections are of 22 –25 gauge and 1 –1.5 in (25 –38 mm) 
length and can be selected based on ch aracteri stics of each pat ient according to standard 
procedures for IM inject ions (US CDC 2022).

6.3.1. Adverse Events
6.3.1.1. Definition of Adverse Events
An AE is the development of any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical 
study  participant administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a 
causal relat ionship with this treatm ent. An AE ca n therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest 
pain), or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product.
The term  AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can include a 
deteri oration of  a pre -exist ing medical occurrence. An AE may  occur at any  time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study  intervent ion has been administered .
Clinical Study Protocol AstraZeneca
AZD7442 –D8850C00009 10June 2022
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 53of 976.3.1.2. Definitions of Serious Adverse Event
An SAE is an AE occurring during any study  phase (i e, run -in, treatment, washout, 
follow-up), that fulfills one or more of the fo llowing cri teria:
Results in death
Is immediately life -threatening
Requi res in -patienthospitalizat ion or prolongat ion of exist inghospi talizati on
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y or incapaci ty or substant ial disrupt ion of the 
abilit y to conduct normal life funct ions
Is a congenital ano maly or bi rth defect
Is an important medic al event that m ay jeopardize the participant or may require medical 
intervent ion to prevent one of the outcomes listed above
For further guidance on the definit ion of an SAE, see Appendix Aof this CSP.
Adverse events for malignant tumors reported during a study  shoul d generally  be assessed as 
SAEs. If no other seriousness criteria apply, the “Important Medical Event” criterion should 
be used. In cer tain situat ions, however, medical judgment on an individual event basis should 
be applied to clarify that the malignant tumor event should be assessed and reported as a 
non-serious AE. For example, if the tumor is included as medical history  and progressi on 
occurs duri ng the study , but the progression does not change treatment and/or prognosis of the 
malignant tumor, the AE may  not fulfill the attributes for being assessed as serious, although 
reporting of the progression of the malignant tumor as an AE is valid and should occur. Also, 
some ty pes of  malignant tum ors, which do not spread remotely after a routine treatment that 
does not require hospitalizat ion, may be assessed as non -serious; examples include Stage 1 
basal cell carcino ma and Stage 1A1 cervical cancer rem oved via cone biopsy.
6.3.1.3. Adverse Events of Special Interest
Adverse events of special interest are events of scient ific and medical interest, specific to the 
further understanding of the study  interventi on safety  profile and requi re close m onitorin g and 
rapid communicat ion by the invest igators to the sponsor. An AESI can be serious or 
non-serious. All AESIs will be recorded in the eCRF. Serious AESIs will be recorded and 
reported as per Section  6.3.1.6 .
 See also the AZD7442 IB for addit ional inform ation on 
AESIs.
The AESIs for AZD7442 are:
Anaphylaxis and other serious hypersensit ivity reacti ons, including immune complex 
disease
Inject ion site reacti ons
Cardi ac ischemia, cardiac failure, and thrombotic events
Clinical Study Protocol AstraZeneca
AZD7442 –D8850C00009 10June 2022
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 54of 976.3.1.4. Other Significant Adverse Events
Medical mo nitoring o f all the safet y data will be conducted on ongoing basis by the qualified 
medical expert to ensure the safety  of the parti cipants and o ther relevant reporting 
requi rements.
6.3.1.5. Recording of Adverse Events
Time Period for Collection of Adverse Events
Adverse events will be collected from the start of Day 1until Day 361.
Serious adverse events will be recorded from the time of informed consent until Day 361.
If the invest igator becomes aware of an SAE with a suspected causal relat ionship to the IMP 
that occurs after the end of the clinical study  in a parti cipant treated by  him or her, the 
investigator shall, wit hout undue delay, report the SAE to the sponsor.
Follow -up of Unresolved Adverse Events
Any AEs that are unresolved at the participant’s last visit in the study  are fo llowed up by the 
investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF.
AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional informat ion for any  parti cipant wi th 
ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study , if judged necessary .
Variables
The fo llowing variables will be collected for each AE:
AE term  (diagnosis/verbatim)
The date and time when the AE started and stopped
Intensit y
Whether the AE is serious or not
Invest igator causalit y rating against the invest igational product (yes or no)
Outcom e
In addit ion, the fo llowing vari ables will be collected for SAEs:
Date AE m et cri teria for seri ous AE
Date invest igator became aware of serious AE
Adverse event is serious due to
Date of hospitalization
Clinical Study Protocol AstraZeneca
AZD7442 –D8850C00009 10June 2022
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 55of 97Date of discharge from hospital
Probable cause of death
Date of death
Autopsy  performed (y es/no)
Causalit y assessment in relat ion to study  procedure(s)
Causalit y assessment to other medicat ion'
The fo llowing intensit y ratings will be used:
1Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated).
2Moderate (di scomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal act ivities).
3Severe (incapaci tating, wi th inabilit y to perform  norm al activities).
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs:
Severit y is a measure of intensit y whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in 
Secti on6.3.1 .2.
An AE of severe intensit y need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, 
nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not an SAE. 
On the other h and, a stroke that results in only  a limi ted degree of disabilit y may be 
considered a mild stroke but would be an SAE.
Causality Collection
The invest igator will assess causal relat ionship between investigat ional product and each AE, 
and answer “yes” or “no” to the question “Do y ou consider that there is a reasonable 
possibilit y that the event may  have been caused by the investigational product?”
For SAEs, causal relat ionship will also be assessed for other medicat ion, any addit ional drug 
and study  procedures. Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any  study  procedure 
the causal relat ionship is implied as “yes”.
A guide to the interpretation of the causalit y quest ion is found in Appendix Aof this CSP.
Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by  the parti cipant or reported in response to the open question 
from the study  personnel: “Have you had any heal th problems since you w ere last asked?” or 
revealed by  observati on will be co llected and recorded in the EDC sy stem .
When co llecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a 
list of signs and symptoms.
Clinical Study Protocol AstraZeneca
AZD7442 –D8850C00009 10June 2022
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 56of 97However, if a diagn osis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally 
part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately.
Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests
The results from protocol -mandated laborato ry tests, vi tal signs, ECGs and other safet y 
assessments will be summarized in the CSR.
Deteri oration as com pared to baseline in protocol -mandated l aboratory  values, vital signs, 
ECGs and other safet y assessments should therefore only  be reported as AEs if they fulfill  any 
of the SAE criteria or are the reason for discont inuation of treatment with the invest igational 
product or are considered to be clinically relevant as judged by the invest igator (which may 
include, but not limit ed to, consideration as to whether treatment, or non -planned visits were 
requi red, or other action was taken with the study  intervent ion, eg, dose adjustment or drug 
interrupti on).
If deteri oration in a laboratory  value or vi tal sign is associ ated wi th clinical  signs and 
symptoms, the sign or sym ptom  will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory  resul t, 
or vital sign will be considered as addit ional informat ion.
Wherever possible the reporting invest igator should use the clinical, rather than the laboratory 
term (eg, anemi a versus l ow hem oglobin value).
In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in 
non-protocol -mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physic al examinat ion 
as com pared wi th the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE.
Hy's Law
Cases where a participant shows elevations in liver biochemistry  may requi re further 
evaluat ion and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ 3 x ULN together with TBL ≥ 2 x ULN may 
need to be reported as SAEs. Please refer to Appendix Cfor further instruction on cases of 
increases in liver biochemistry  and evaluat ion of Hy’s Law.
6.3.1.6. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the invest igational 
product, or to the study  procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the EDC system.
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study , then the invest igator or other site personnel will 
inform  appropri ate AstraZeneca representatives immediately, or no later than 24 hours of 
when he or she beco mes aware of it.

the necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Pat ient Safet y data entry  site within 
1calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life -threatening events and within 5 calendar 
days of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal  or life -threatening AEs where important or relevant informat ion is missing, active 
follow-up will be undertaken immediately.
Invest igators or other site personnel will inform AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up 
inform ation on a previously  reported SAE immediately, or no later than 24 hours of when he

The reference document for definit ion of expectedness/listedness is the IB for the AstraZeneca 
drug.
6.3.1.7. Regulatory Reporting Requi rements for Serious Adverse Events
Prom pt notificat ion by the invest igator to the sponsor of an SAE is essent ial so that l egal 
obligat ions and ethical responsibilit ies toward the safet y of parti cipants and the safet y of a 
study  interventi on under clinical invest igation are met.
The sponsor has a legal responsibilit y to notify both the l ocal Regulatory  Authori ty and other 
regul atory  agencies about the safet y of a study  intervent ion under clinical investigation. The 
sponsor will co mply wi th country -specific r egulatory  requi rements relating to safet y reporti ng 
to the Regulatory  Authori ty, IRB, and investigators.
For all studies, invest igator safet y reports m ust be prepared for Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse React ions according to local regul ations and spo nsor policy and forwarded to 
investigators as necessary .
An invest igator who receives an invest igator safety report describing an SAE or other specific 
safet y informat ion (eg, summary  or list ing of SAEs) fro m the sponsor will review and then 
file it along with the IB and will notify  the IRB, if appropriate according to local regulations .

All AEs will be coded using MedDRA vocabulary  and will be listed for each participant.
For assi gning AEs to a specific treatment/dose, the fo llowing gui delines shoul d be fo llowed:
AEs with start date/time at the time of or after dosing (for each specific treatment/dose) 
until Follow-Up Visi t will  be assigned to the specific treatment/dose.
AEs with unknown start times, but with start date known, will be imputed with a time of 
00:00, unl ess the start date corresponds to any  given dosing date. In this case the start 
time will be imputed with the time o f dosing. If this results in a start date/time after end 
date/time of the AE, then the time will also be imputed with 00:00.
AEs with co mpletely unknown start dates will be imput ed with the date and time of 
dosing, unless the end date is known and prior to dosing; in that case the start date will be 
imputed as the date of Screening and a time of 00:00.
AEs with part ially known start dates/times will be treated as follows:
If only  the day  is missing, then the day  will be imputed wi th the first day  of the 
month, unless the month and year in which the AE started is a month and year in 
which IMP was administered, then the day will be imputed with the first day  on 
which IMP was administ ered in that m onth. If this results in a start date after the end 
date, then the day  will be imputed wi th the first day  of the m onth.
If only  the m onth is missing and the y ear is a year in which IMP was administered, 
then the month will be imputed with the first m onth in which IMP was administered. 
If this results in a start date after the end date of the AE, then the month will be 
imputed with JAN. If the known year part is not a year in which IMP was 
administered, then the month will also be imputed with JAN.
If both the day  and m onth is missing and the year is a y ear in which IMP was 
administered, then the day  and m onth will be imputed wi th the day  and m onth of 
dosing. If this results in a start date after end date, then the day and month will be 
imputed with 01JAN. If the y ear is not a y ear in which IMP was administered, then 
the day  and m onth will also be imputed wi th 01JAN.
If only  the year is missing, then the y ear will be imputed with the y ear of dosing.
Missing times will be imputed as 00:00 h or wit h the time o f dosing for events 
starting on a dosing day .

A separate SAP will be compiled for this study. The details of the formal hypothesis testing 
will be detailed in the SAP.
Regarding PK comparabilit y, if the 90% CIs for the geometric mean ratios for both AUCinf 
(AUClast for some agencies) and Cmax are ent irely contained wi thin 0.8000 and 1.2500 for 
all compar isons according to the study  objectives, it may be concluded that th e 2 formulat ions 
(the co-formulation and the form ulation from the individual vials ) are com parable and the 2 
materi als (cl onal cell line materi al and cell pool  material) are com parable.

11.2. Methods of Statistical Analyses
11.2.1. General Principles
The statist ical methodology below describes the statistical analysis as it is foreseen when the 
study is being planned.
If circumstances should arise during the study rendering the analysis inappropriate, or if in the 
meantime im proved methods of analysis should come to light, different analyses may be 
performed.
A SAP will be written for the study. Any deviations from the statist ical methodology defined 
in this protocol or SAP, reasons for such deviations and all alternative/additional s tatist ical 
analyses that may be performed will be described in the CSR. Such changes to analyses may be written into an abbreviated SAP, if appropriate. The verification and review of all statistical modeling assumptions will be documented appropriately.
All original and derived parameters as well as demographic and disposition data will be listed 
and described using summary s tatistics. All safety data (scheduled and unscheduled) w ill be 
presented in the data listings.
Demographic and baseline data will be summarized for all randomized participants by 
treatment group (Treatment Groups A, B, and C and Total). Pharmacokinetic data will be summarized by treatment group, tr eatment group and injection site, treatment group and 
bodyweight category, and treatment group, injection site, and bodyweight category. Safety and tolerability data will be summarized by treatment group (Treatment Groups A, B, and C 
and Total), if applicable.
Frequency counts (number of participants [n] and percentages) will be calculated for each 
qualitative variable. Descriptive statistics  (n, mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum) 
will be calculated for each quantitative variable (unless otherwise stated). Descriptive statistics will only be presented if n ≥ 3. If no participants have data at a given time point, then 
only n = 0 will be presented. If n < 3, only the n, minimum and maximum will be presented, and if n = 3, only the n, median, minimum and maximum will be presented; the other descriptive statistics will be left blank.CCI

treatm ent group:
If the repeated measurement of a specific parameter occurs prior to IMP administration 
(Day  1), then the l ast obtained value prior to dosing will be used in the descript ive 
statist ics and in the calculat ion of changes fro m baseline.
If the repeated measurement of a specific parameter occurs after IMP administration 
(Day 1), then the first (non -missing) value after dosing will be used in descriptive 
statist ics and in the calculat ion of changes fro m baseline.
The pl anned sequence for measurement of mult iple asse ssments at the same time point is 
described in Section 3.1.1 .
For safet y assessments performed at screening and the fo llow
-up, the fo llowing rul es will 
apply for any  repeated assessments:
If the repeated assessment occurs at screening the last available value will be used in the 
summary statist ics.
If the repeated assessment occurs at the Fo llow-up Vi sit the fi rst non -missing assessment 
will be used in the summary statist ics.

11.4. Determination of Sample Size
Preliminary analysis o f PK data fro m the first -in-human study , D8850C00001, in dicated that 
after an IM dose of IMP (separate AZD8895 and then AZD1061 doses) at a dose of 300 mg 
total protein, the CV% for Cmax of the individual mAbs, AZD8895 and AZD1061 were 
35.6% and 38.5%, respectively, while the CV% for AUCs of both individual mAb s, AZD8895 
and AZD1061 were < 36.4%. Therefore, assuming a mean rat io of 1 between co mparators, 
69participants per group will provide at least 95% power to demonstrate comparabilit y (90%

12.2. Overdose
For this study, any dose of IMP greater than the assigned dose will be considered an overdose. 
AstraZeneca does not recommend a specific treatment for an overdose. Symptoms of overdose should be treated as per clinical judgment.
!An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE modules in the CRF and on the Overdose CRF module.
!An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the Overdose CRF module.
If an overdose on an AstraZeneca IMP occurs in the course of the study, then the investigator 
or other site personnel inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives immediately, or no 
later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all 
relevant information is provided to the AstraZen eca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 or 
5 days for SAEs, see Section 6.3.1.6,  and within 30 days for other overdoses.
12.2.1. Medication Error
For the purposes of this clinical study, a med ication error is an uninte nded failure or mistake 
in the treatment process for an AstraZeneca study intervention that either causes harm to the 
participant or has the potential to cause harm to the participant.
A medication error is not lack of  efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study site staff or participant.
If a medication error occurs in the course of the study, then the investigator or other site 
personnel informs the appropriate Astr aZeneca representatives within one day, ie, 
immediately, but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.PPD

Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error:
Occurred.
Was i dentified and intercepted before the participant received the drug.
Did not occur, but circumstances were recognized that could have led to an error.
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
Drug name confusio n.
Dispensing error, eg, medicat ion prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actually given to 
the participant.
Drug not administered as indicated, eg, wrong route or wrong site of admini strati on.
Drug not taken as indicated, eg, tablet disso lved in water when it should be taken as a 
solid tablet.
Drug not stored as instructed, eg, kept in the refrigerator when it should be at room 
temperature.
Wrong participant received the medicat ion (ex cluding IRT/RTSM errors).
Wrong drug administered to participant (excluding IRT/RTSM errors).
Examples of events that do not require reporting as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:
Errors related to or resulting fro m IRT/RTSM -including those which lead to one of the 
above listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error.
Parti cipant acci dentally  missed drug dose(s), eg, forgot to take medication.
Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose).
Parti cipant f ailed to return unuse d medicat ion or empt y packaging.
Errors related to background and rescue medicat ion, or standard of care medicat ion in 
open l abel studi es, even if an AstraZeneca product.
Medicat ion errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may  occur as a consequence of the 
medicat ion error.

12.3.1. Maternal Exposure
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicio n that the IMP under study  
may have interfered with the effect iveness of a contraceptive medicat ion. Congenital 
anomalies/bi rth defects and spontaneous miscarriages shoul d be reported and handled as 
SAEs. Elective abortions wit hout complicat ions should not be handled as AEs. The outcome 
of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elect ive terminat ion, ectopic pregnancy, normal 
birth or congenital ano maly) should be f ollowed up and docum ented even if the participant 
was discont inued from the study.
If any pregnancy  occurs in the course of the study , then the investigator or other site personnel

Appendix AAdditional Safety Information
Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event
Life-threatening
“Life -threatening” means that the participant was at immediate risk of death from the adverse 
event (AE) as it occurred, or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would 
resul t in the parti cipant’s death. “Life -threatening” does not mean that had an AE occurred in 
a more severe form it might have caused death (eg, hepat itis that resolve d without hepati c 
failure).
Hospitalization
Outpati ent treatm ent in an emergency room is not in itself a serious adverse event (SAE), 
although the reasons for it may  be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema). Hospital admissio ns 
and/or surgical operations pla nned before or during a study  are not considered AEs if the 
illness or disease existed before the participant was enrolled in the study , provi ded that i t did 
not deteriorate in an unexpected way  during the study .
Important Medical Event or Medical Interven tion
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important m edical events may  not be immediately life- threatening or resul t in 
death, hospi talizat ion, disabilit y or incapaci ty but may jeopar dize the participant or may 
requi re medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of 
serious. These shoul d usually  be consi dered as serious.
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an Important Medical Even t; 
medical judgment must be used.
Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatm ent
Hepatotoxicit y caused by paracetamo l (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine
Intensive treatment in an emergency room  or at home for allergic bronchospasm
Blood dy scrasias (eg, neutropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusio n, etc.) or 
convulsio ns that do not result in hospitalizat ion
Development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 91of 97A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question
When making an assessment of causalit y consi der the foll owing f actors when deciding if there 
is a “reasonable possibilit y” that an AE may have been caused by the drug.
Time Course. Exposure to suspect drug. Has the participant actually received the suspect 
drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the administration of the 
suspect drug?
Consistency wit h known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxico logy) or drugs of the same 
pharmaco logical class? Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical 
properties?
De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose 
of the suspect drug?
No al ternative cause . The AE cannot be reasonably  explained by another etio logy such as 
the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after 
having been stopped? Astr aZeneca would not normally reco mmend or support a 
re-challenge.
Laboratory  tests. A specific laboratory  invest igation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship?
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
Is this a recognized featur e of overdose of the drug?
Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit y of “related” is m ade if fo llowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for 
a “reasonable possibilit y” of a causal relat ionship for the individual  case. The expressio n 
“reasonable possibilit y” of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data including enough 
inform ation to m ake an informed judgment. With no available facts or arguments to suggest a 
causal relat ionship, the event(s) will be assessed as “not related”.
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study  has deteri orated due to l ack of 
effect shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y.

Labeling and Shipment of Biohazard Samples
International Airline Transportation Associat ion (IATA) classifies bio hazardous agents into 
3categori es (http: //www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dangerous_goods/infectious
_substances.ht m). For transport purposes, the classificat ion of infect ious substances according 
to risk groups was removed from the Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) in the 46th edit ion 
(2005). Infec tious substances are now classified either as Category  A, Category B or Exem pt. 
There i s no di rect relati onship between Risk Groups and Categories A and B.
Category AInfectious Substances are infect ious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, i s capable of causing permanent disabilit y, life-threatening or fatal  disease in 
otherwi se healt hy humans or animals. Category A pathogens are for example, Ebola and Lassa 
Fever viruses :
Are to be packed and shipped in accordance wit h IATA Instruction 602.
Category B Infectious Substances are infect ious substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusio n in Category  A. Category B pathogens are for example, hepat itis A, B, C, D and E 
viruses, and human immunodeficiency  virus (HIV) ty pes 1 and 2. They  are assi gned the

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 93of 97Appendix CActions Required in Cases of Combined Increase of 
Aminotransferase and Total Bilirubin -Hy’s Law
Introduction
This Appendix describes the process to be fo llowed in order to ident ify and appropriately 
report Potential Hy’s Law (PHL) ca ses and Hy’s Law (HL) cases. It is not intended to be a 
comprehensive gui de to the m anagement of el evated liver biochemistries.
During the course of the study  the Invest igator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry . The Investi gator i s responsible for determining whether a participant meets 
potenti al PHL cri teria at any  point duri ng the study.
All sources of l aboratory  data are appropri ate for the determinat ion of PHL and HL events; 
this includes samples collected at scheduled study  visit sand other visit s including central and 
all local laboratory  evaluat ions even if co llected outside o f the study  visits; for exam ple, PHL 
criteria coul d be m et by  an elevated al anine aminotransferase (ALT) from a central laboratory  
and/or elevated total bil irubin (TBL) fro m a local laboratory .
The Investigator will also review adverse event (AE) data (for example, for AEs that may 
indicate elevat ions in liver biochemistry ) for possible PHL events.
The Investigator participates, together with AstraZeneca clin ical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meet ing PHL criteria to agree whether HL criteria are met. HL 
criteria are met if there is no alternat ive explanation for the elevat ions in liver biochemistry  
other than Drug -Induced Liver Inj ury (DILI) caused by  the invest igational medicinal product 
(IMP).
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for 
reporting serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs according to the outcome o f the review and 
assessment in line with standard safet y reporting processes.
Definitions
Potential Hy’s Law
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or ALT ≥ 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) together with
TBL ≥ 2 x ULN at any  point during the study  following the start of study  medicat ion 
irrespective of an increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP).
Hy’s Law (HL)
Aspartate aminotransferase or ALT ≥ 3 x ULN together with TBL ≥ 2 x ULN, where no 
other reason, other than the IMP, can be found to explain the combinat ion of increases, eg, 
elevated ALP i ndicat ing cholestasis, viral hepat itis, another drug.
Clinical Study Protocol AstraZeneca
AZD7442 –D8850C00009 10June 2022
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 94of 97For PHL and HL the elevat ion in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the 
same day ) the el evati on in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the 
elevations in transamina ses and TBL m ust occur.
Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
In order to i dentify  cases of PHL i t is important to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory  data for any  parti cipant who m eets any of the fo llowing identificat ion criteria in 
isolation or in combinat ion:
Aspartate aminotransferase ≥ 3 x ULN
Alanine aminotransferase ≥ 3 x ULN
Total  bilirubin ≥ 2 x ULN
When a participant meets any of the PHL ident ification criteria, in iso lation or in co mbinat ion, 
the central  laboratory  will immediately send an alert to the Invest igator (also send to 
AstraZeneca representative).
The Investigator will also remain vigilant for any  local  laboratory  reports where the PHL 
ident ificat ion criteria are met, where this is the case ,the Invest igator will:
Notify  the AstraZeneca representative
Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by  the central  laboratory  without delay
Com plete the appropri ate unscheduled laboratory  case report form (CRF) module(s) with 
the original l ocal laboratory  test resul t
When the identificat ion criteria are m et from central  or local laboratory  resul ts the Invest igator 
will wit hout del ay:
Determine whether the participant meets PHL criteria (see Section 2 within this appendix 
for definit ion) by reviewing laboratory  reports from all previ ous visi ts (including both 
central  and l ocal laboratory  resul ts)
Follow -Up
Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met
If the participant does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
Inform  the AstraZeneca representative that the participant has not met PHL criteria
Perform  follow-up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts according to the guidance provided in 
the clinical study  protocol  (CSP)
Clinical Study Protocol AstraZeneca
AZD7442 –D8850C00009 10June 2022
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 95of 97Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met
If the participant does meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
Determine whether PHL criteria were met at any  study  visit prior to starting study  
intervent ion (see Section 6 of this appendix)
Notify  the AstraZeneca representative who will then inform the central Study  Team
Within 1 day of PHL criteria being met, the Invest igator will repo rt the case as an SAE of 
PHL; serious criteria “Important Medical Event” and causalit y assessment “yes/related” 
according to CSP process for SAE reporting
For parti cipants that met PHL criteria prior to starting IMP, the Invest igator is not 
requi red to sub mit a PHL SAE unless there is a significant change1in the participant’s 
condi tion
The Study  Physician contacts the Invest igator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an 
approach for the study  parti cipants’ fo llow-up (including any further laboratory  testing) 
and the continuous review of data
Subsequent to this contact the Invest igator will:
oMoni tor the parti cipant until liver bio chemistry  param eters and appropri ate 
clinical symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as 
medically i ndicated. Completes fo llow-up SAE Form  as requi red.
oInvest igate the etio logy of the event and perform diagnostic investigat ions as 
discussed wi th the Study  Physician. This includes deciding which the tests 
available in the HL laboratory  kit shoul d be used (if applicable).
oCom plete the three liver CRF modules as informatio n beco mes available.
Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
The instructions in this sect ion shoul d be fo llowed for all  cases where PHL cri teria are m et.
As soon as possible aft er the biochemistry  abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the Study  
Physician contacts the Invest igator in order to review available data and agree on whether 
there is an alternat ive explanat ion for meeting PHL criteria other than DILI caused by the 
IMP, to ensure timely analysis and reporting to healt h authorit ies wit hin 15 calendar days 
from the date the PHL criteria were met. The AstraZeneca Glo bal Clinical Lead or equivalent 
and Glo bal Safet y Physician will also be invo lved in this review together with ot her 
participant m atter experts as appropriate.
1A “significant” change in the participant’s condition refers to a clinically rele vant change in any of the 
individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST or TBL) in isolation or in combination, or a clinically 
relevant change in associated symptoms. The determination of whether there has been a significant change will 
be at the dis cretion of the Investigator, this may be in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any 
uncertainty .
Clinical Study Protocol AstraZeneca
AZD7442 –D8850C00009 10June 2022
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 96of 97According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Invest igator will fo llow the 
instructi ons bel ow.
Where There is an Agreed Alternative Explanation for the AST or ALT and TBL 
Elevat ions, a determination of whether the alternative explanat ion is an AE will be made and 
subsequent ly whether the AE meets any criteria for an SAE:
If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanat ion on the 
appropriate CRF module(s)
If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE: update the previously submitted PHL SAE 
and AE CRF entries accordingly  with the new info rmation (reassessing event term; 
causalit y and seri ousness cri teria) fo llowing the Ast raZeneca standard processes
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the AST or ALT and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:
Send updated SAE (report term “Hy’s Law”) according to AstraZeneca standard 
processes
The “Medically Importan t” seriousness criterion should be used if no other 
seriousness cri teria apply
As there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessment of 
“related” should be assigned
If there is an unavo idable delay o f over 15 calendar days in obtaining the informat ion 
necessary  to assess whether the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is 
no al ternative explanat ion until such t ime as an informed decisio n can be made:
Provi de any further update to the previously  submitte d SAE of PHL (report term now 
“Hy’s Law case”), ensuring causalit y assessment is “related to IMP” and seriousness 
criterion is “medically  important”, according to CSP process for SAE reporting
Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once th e necessary  
supplementary  informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine 
whether HL criteria are still met. Update the previously submitted PHL SAE report 
following CSP process for SAE reporting, according to the outcome of the revi ew and 
amending the reported term if an alternat ive explanat ion for the liver biochemistry  
elevations is determined.
Laboratory Tests
The list below represents the standard, comprehensive list of fo llow-up tests which are 
recommended but not mandatory  whe n using a central laboratory . For studi es using a l ocal 
laboratory , the list m ay be modified based on clinical  judgment. Any  test resul ts need to be 
recorded.

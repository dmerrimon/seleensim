1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Introduction  
The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has funded 
a cooperative agreement including six leading pediatric renal transplant  and spina bifida (SB) 
care centers in the United States , the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia  (CHOP) , Bos ton 
Children’s Hospital, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta , Seattle Children’s Hospital, Lurie’s 
Children of Chicago,  and Children’s Mercy Kansas City . 
The overarching goal of this five-year,  phase II, randomized clinical trial  is to improve  poor 
long-term health outcomes in both adolescents and young  adults (AYA) with either a kidney 
transplant  (KT)  or spina bifida  (SB) , respectively. More specifically, this study will focus on 
decreasing  premature allograft loss  in subjects with  kidney transplant  (KT)  due to medication 
nonadherence  and kidney damage in subjects with SB due to urinary non -continence. To 
achieve these goals, this study will implement a real -time feedback system,  Way to Health  
(WTH) , that will provide education and support , increase awareness and incentivize positive 
health behavior,  in addition to standard of care . Further, this study wil l investigate the 
mechanisms of  beha vior change by examining the role of financial incentives, positive 
feedback and the relationship between the two . The stu dy will compare two cohorts of KT 
and SB subject s, which will undergo varied levels of financial incentive s and positive 
feedback. Data from KT and SB subject s will be analyzed separately. This innovative m obile 
health  (mhealth)  strategy will improve our current measures of adherence and increase our 
understanding of factors that influence adherence for  two AYA  populations, KT and  SB 
subject s, respectively . Our study will contribute novel insight to inform the design of future 
interventions targeting persistence of behavior change and can be used in other centers and 
for other chronic disease groups . 
1.2 Name and Description of Investigational Product or Intervention  
The study intervention will  use the WTH  web-based platform to support AYA with KT or SB 
as they navigate their daily tre atment burdens.  This will be achieved via bi -directional text 
messaging, including the sending of reminders and positive feedback by WTH  and the 
messaging of pictures of medic ation or catheter in hand at time of treatment by the participant. 
This intervention  will assess sustainability of this novel bi -directional messaging system and 
the impact of  providing education and support, increasing awareness and incen tivizing  
positive  health behavior in real -time.  
 
1.3 Findings from Clinical Studies  
Kidney Transplant : AYA  with KT  have lower five year allograft survival than any other age 
group besides patients over 65 years of age, and once diagnosed with rejection, they do not 
respond a s well to treatment, with fewer complete rejection reversals and greater residual graft 
dysfunction.2-4 High rates of non -adherence (NA) play a key role in high rates of rejection, 
premature allograft dysfunction and graft failure.5-8 AYA KT recipients who e xperience graft 
failure are twice as likely to be NA (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.12 -4.06).9 Recent evidence also 
demonstrates a significant association between NA and development of de novo donor -
specific antibody.10 AYA who develop  donor -specific antibody wait  substantially longer for 
  Protocol No. 16 -013000  
   
   2 
re-transplantation.11 Thus, nonadherent AYA with KT are primed to spend less of their 
lifetime with a functioning graft and more time on dialysis, leading to tremendous loss in 
quality of life and increased co-morbidities and astounding economic burden.12 After the first 
year post -transplant, Medicare costs for patients with a functioning graft are $30,000 annually, 
less than half the annual costs of dialysis care.2 Persistent NA leads to over $21,000 in 
increased adjusted med ical costs over 3 years per patient, with AYA less than 24 years of age 
having the highest rates of persistent NA.9 
 
Spina Bifida : SB is one of the most common and disabling birth defects, occurring in 3.1 of 
every 10,000 live births.13 Despite dramatic advances in our understanding and treatment of 
SB, the lower urinary tract outcomes for patients with SB continue to show urodynamic 
patterns consistent with neurogenic bladders.14 Bladder dysfunction, if not  treated, leads to 
kidney damage and failure. Clean Intermittent Catheterization (CIC) remains a critical 
component of medical treatment to achieve urinary continence and optimize bladder 
function.15 Recognizing that the risk for kidney damage can often be significantly reduced or 
eliminated with close monitoring and medical treatment, the CDC has established a protocol 
to standardize bladder and kidney assessments starting from infancy.16 Yet, even with better 
assessments, patient continence cannot be achieved without rigorous adherence to treatment 
regimens. Health professionals and patients with SB both rate adherence to cathe terization as 
highly problematic.17,18 When patients do not succeed in achieving urinary continence with 
medical management, surgical reconstruction, with bladder augmentation or creation of a 
catheterizable stoma, may be needed.  However, these procedures incur significant secondary 
complications, including increa sed risks of urinary tract infection (UTI), urolithiasis, 
metabolic abnormalities, cancer and bowel perforation.19  
 
Patients with SB experience rates of inpatient admissions with UTI that are over 50 times 
higher than the general population.20,21 It is estimated that if the number of UTI 
hospitalizations among SB patients were reduced by half, $4.4 million would be saved per 
1000 patients .20 Among SB patients who progress to end -stage renal disease (ESRD), ESRD 
is usually caused by urological complications and is reached at a substantially younger age 
compared to patients without SB (41 vs. 62 years, p<0.001). ESRD increases the already high 
complexity of SB care, and consequently, AYA with SB face tremendous difficulties in 
accessing care, contributing to reduced access to transplantation.22 Thus, similar to AYA KT 
recipients, AYA with SB are primed to spend more of their lifetime on dialysis, leading to 
tremendous loss in quality of life, increased co -morbidities and increased costs. In addition, 
the incontinent AYA is more likely to remain socially isolated and disengaged.23 These 
significant burdens of cost and quality of life emphasize the crucial need to support AYA with 
KT and SB in their ability to comply with treatment regimens.   
 
1.4 Relevant Lite rature and Data  
NA in chronic conditions is a particularly challenging problem to solve primarily because: 1) 
adherence is a complex behavior that requires long -term engagement and 2) adherence is 
difficult to measure.  
 
  Protocol No. 16 -013000  
   
   3 
NA is often considered a patient -driven problem and, as a consequence, many interventions 
focus solely on the patient. However, The World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasized 
that this perception fails to acknowledge that many external factors influence people’s 
behavior and their capac ity to adhere to prescribed treatments.24 The WHO Mu lti-
Dimensional Adherence Model identifies five interrelated categories of risk factors for NA: 
social and economic, condition -related, treatment -related, patient -related and healthcare 
system factors.  
 
These five elements provide an excellent framework f or conceptualizing barriers and 
facilitators to treatment adherence in AYA with KT and SB. In addition to the economic 
burdens of chronic illness, social factors, such as family conflict and lack of cohesion, are 
associated with NA. Children with SB and KT  tend to lag behind typically developing youth 
in general independence, and their parents are more likely to be overprotective.17 This 
dynamic often contributes to family conflict as adolescents with SB emerge into adults.17,25 
There are also important condition -related factors that result from the effects of underlying 
chronic illness. Neither chronic kidn ey disease (CKD) nor SB is an isolated condition. The 
co-morbidities  associated with these diseases  increase adherence burden, by augmenting the 
number of treatments, labs and doctors’ visits. Neurocognitive dysfunction is also common 
among AYA with SB and  KT, which results in increased learning challenges.26,27 AYA with 
KT and SB experience many treatment -related factors as well. Immunosuppressives and 
catheterization have many unfavorable side effects. Treatment com plexity, particularly in 
terms of numbers of medications or frequency of treatments, impairs adherence.28,29 Patient -
related factors include low self -esteem, low self -efficacy and social adjustment difficulties. 
Patients who  are more self -motivated and perceive greater control over their health tend to be 
more adherent.28 AYA with chronic conditions do not want to appear different from their peers 
and often s truggle accepting their healthcare needs because they do not feel “normal”.30-32 
Further, AYA who have overprotective parents may not receive the practice and 
encouragement needed to gain confidence and skills to b ecome autonomous in their care.17 
Lastly, the healthcare system poses barriers to treatment adherence. Factors linked to NA 
include limited time providers spend with patients, lack of information about health and 
treatments, and little focused discussion of adherence barriers.33  
 
Historically, interventions to address NA have been limited to enhanced monitoring with 
increased lab screening and clinic visits to provide supplemental education and counseling.34-
36 This approach has  been  met with limited success, largely because clinic -based interventions 
increase patient and caregiver burden, for families who are already overwhelmed with tasks 
at hand. Moreover, education alone is not sufficient to p romote long -term patient engagement 
in health -promoting behavior37; most patients know what they need to do to stay healthy but 
they face everyday challenges  in doing so.24  
 
Another great challenge in designing adherence interventions is that there is no “gold 
standard”. No single measure of adherence shows high sensitivity and specificity.38 Current 
methods of adherence measurement are fraught with feasibility challenges. Shemesh and Fine 
suggest  the ideal measure of adherence should: a) be easily integrated into practice, b) pose 
minimal ad ditional burden to patients c) be simple d) correlate with adverse clinical outcomes 
and e) identify nonadherence in real time.39 To date, no adhe rence interventions have 
  Protocol No. 16 -013000  
   
   4 
successfully achieved these goals for KT recipients. Adherence research in SB is even more 
limited. Some insight has been gleaned regarding adherence barriers for AYA with SB and 
there is evidence that cathing adherence declines ov er time. However, few adherence 
interventions have been tested in AYA with SB, and among those, a caregiver questionnaire 
has been the primary assessment used.1,17 Thus, for AYA with SB, there remains very little 
understanding of day -to-day treatment adherence patterns and challenges.40 
 
Mobile Technology: Well -Suited to Address Current Gaps in Adherence Interventions 
for AYA  
 
Mobile technology presents a novel opportunity to transform AYA participation in their own 
healthcare, creating a space for AYA with KT or SB to practice autonomy in healthcare self -
managements skills and receive feedback on performance. Mhealth  interventi ons that use 
mobile technology, such as apps or texting, have shown early promise in acceptability and 
feasibility as an adherence tool for AYA across a wide range of chronic conditions.18,41,42 
Using texting as a mode of intervention is low -cost, highly available and uniquely allows 
ecological momentary assessments, i.e. assessments and interventions are provided when 
patients need support the most - at the time behavior is performed. Text messaging 
interventions pose minimal burden, are simple and can identify nonadherence in real -time.  
 
Innovation in Theoretical Framework  
 
Behavioral economics theory (BET) start s with empirical observations that humans often 
behave in predictably irrational ways. BET endorses theory -driven interventions that make it 
easy for subjec ts to do what is in their best interests and harder to do what is not. BET targets 
the human tendenc y toward present bias , counteracting long -term negative outcomes  which 
are often heavily discounted.37 Incentive motivation  is another key construct. Behavio ral 
economics also targets regret aversion, the desire to avoid regret or loss. In BET intervention 
models, subjects are often told what  they could have gained if they had performed the positive 
health behavior. This approach promotes motivation to avoid l oss of a reward in the future. 
BET models have been rigorously tested and shown to be effective across a wide range of 
adult chronic disease conditions43-45, but BET has not been widely  applied in AYA .  
 
Bandura’s social cognitive theory, an important theoretical framework for behavioral 
economics, suggests that behavior can be changed through new learning experiences, 
guidance in the adjustment of perceptions, and support for the develo pment of capacities.57 
Bandura identified increased self-efficacy  as a common mechanism to promote behavior 
change. Methods for increasing self -efficacy include: 1) helping subjects gain mastery of 
behavior , 2) showing subjects that others like them can do it (social modeling),  3) improving 
physical and emotional states by reducing stress and fear and 4) persuading through 
encouragement.46 BET relies heavily on effective feedback loops that incorporate these 
methods.  
 
Our study will  pair financial incentives with positive text messages. Although the use of 
financial incentives is common in children in everyday parenting, i.e. allowances, there has 
  Protocol No. 16 -013000  
   
   5 
been limited use in research. In two pediatric studies, giving children small incentives to 
increase healthy food consumption more than doubled fruit and vegetable intake, and effects 
were sustaine d for two months.47,48 Another study recently showed that giving young adults 
with food allergies $10 a w eek for carrying epinephrine auto -injectors was more effective in 
increasing carriage than text reminders alone.49  Our study will be the first to test the effects 
of paired text messages with small incentives to promote adherence among AYA with KT or 
SB. 
 
Innovation in M ethods  
 
Bi-directional texting  has shown good acceptability in other AYA populations.41,49,50 In a 
small study of AYA with HIV, increased adherence reported by interactive text messaging 
showed a trend toward positive improvements in biomarkers.41 Co-investigator, Lisa 
Schwartz, has applied interactive text  messaging in THRIVE 2.0, a randomized clinical trial  
to improve healthcare self -management skills in AYA cancer survivors, with very low refusal 
rates (<20%) and 90% study retention.51  
 
1.5 Compliance Statement  
This study will be conducted in full accordance with all applicable Research Policies and  
Procedures and all applicable f ederal and state laws and regulations including 45 CFR 46. A ll 
episodes of noncompliance will be documented.  
The investigators will perform the study in accordance with this protocol, will obtain consent 
and assent, and will report unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others in 
accordance with IRB Policies and Procedures and all federal requirements. Collection, 
recording, and reporting of data will be accurate and will ensure the privacy, health, and 
welfare of research subjects during and after the study.  
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of behavioral feedback plus 
economic incentives to promote treatment adherence among a large diverse population of 
AYA with KT or SB.  
2.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective is t o compare th e efficacy of two 6 -month  mhealth -based interventions 
to promote treatment  adherence among AYA with KT or  SB. In Arm 1, subject s will receive 
text reminders and a nominal weekly payment for participation. Arm 2 is an enhanced, tailored 
intervention with individ ualized feedback on adherence behavior and financial incentives for 
meeting adherence goals. The primary outcome is change in proportion of time adherent 
between run -in and 6 -month intervention. Adherence data will be collected in real -time when 
subjects t ake pictures of their medicines (or catheter) in hand. Secondary outcomes are 
coefficient of variation (CV) in immunosuppressive drug levels for KT recipients and change 
in bladder wall compliance for SB subjects. Hypothesis 1: Adherence will be higher dur ing 
the 6 -month intervention in Arm 2 vs. Arm 1.

2.2 Secondary Objective  
The secondary objective is t o evaluate differences in su stainability of adherence in a 6 -month 
post-intervention period in which financial incentives are tapered then stopped in Arm 2. We 
will compare the change in adherence from the intervention’s end to 6 months post -
intervention. Hypothesis 2: Arm 2 (vs. Arm 1) will demonstrate greater sustained  adherence 
as incentives are slowly removed due to ongoing tailored feedback.  
 
2.3 Tertiary Objective  
The tertiary objective is t o identify psychosocial correlates of adherence changes in AYA with 
KT and SB. Using validated surveys, we will examine perceived barriers, self -efficacy and 
healthcare responsibility before and after the 6 -month intervention  and follow -up periods . 
Hypothesis 3: Positive change in adherence behavior is associated with positive changes in 
self-efficacy, reduced perceived barriers and increased healthcare responsibility.  
 
2.4 Quaternary Objective  
The quaternary obje ctive is to evaluate differences in comorbidities  and demographic data of 
lost to follow up participants to that of those who complete the  study  intervention . This will 
contribute to understanding generalizability .  
 
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 General Schema of Study Design  
3.1.1 Screening Phase  
Potential subjects in the Nephrology , Urology  and Spina Bifida  outpatient clinics will be 
screened using the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria. Those who meet the criteria will 
be approached by a member of the study tea m at their regularly scheduled clinic visit or by 
phone and asked if they would like to hear about the study. If the subject expresses interest, 
he or she will have  an orientation to the WTH  platform facilitate d by the research coordinator. 
The r esearch coordinator will help subjects open an account, sign an informed consent, and 
complete a baseline questionnaire at study entry during a clinic visit. At this enrollment visit , 
coordinators will explain the bi -directional texting and smartphone adhe rence reporting to 
participants and show them how to perform the reporting. Participant phones will be checked 
to ensure texting and camera capabilities.  If a participant does not have a smartphone, a study 
phone will be provided. Coordinators will also gi ve each participant a Greenfire Clin Card, 
explaining to the par ticipant how the card works. A member of the  Data Coordinating Center  
(DCC)  research staff  will activate each card remotely. If participants are pressed for time, they 
may complete the baselin e questionnaire s via the WTH platform and will be requested to do 
so within five days of study entry. Participants who complete their surveys within this time 
frame wi ll receive $20. Participants who complete their surveys within 6 – 10 days will receive 
$10. They will be sent a te xt reminder to complete their questionnaire s if they have not done 
so within five days.  Coordinators will tell participants that they can earn either a water bottle 
  Protocol No. 16 -013000  
   
   7 
or a phone wallet  at baseline  for the completion of surveys withi n this time. They will be given 
this prize in clinic if they are able to complete all baseline  surveys  during the clinic visit . If 
not, they will be mailed their prize.     
Additionally, the research coordinator will help a parent/legal guardian set up his/ her WTH 
portal. The parent/legal guardian will  sign an informed consent and  also com plete a baseline 
questionnaire. Through this portal, parents/legal guardians will have access to educational 
information, a copy of the consent form and the ability to answ er questionnaires when 
prompted. The IRB has  waived  consent and HIPAA authorization for the child’s absent 
parent/legal guardian  in the case that both parents/legal guardians are not present at time of 
enrollment . The waiver s will occur for the purpose of collecting demographic information 
about the absent parent/legal guardian, such as income and education level. If both 
parents/legal guardians are present then both will be consented.  
 
An iPad will be provided to each site by the DCC for ease of facilitating this phase in clinic.  
 
After the informed consent process, a medical history and  medical record review will take 
place.   
 
3.1.2 Run-In and Intervention  Phase  
During the first two weeks (run -in period) after questionnaire  completion, all participants will  
be asked to  take a photo of their medicines or catheter in hand at the time of treatment  without 
prompts from Way to Health . The photo will be automatically transmitted to WTH  and ti me 
stamped to record treatment adherenc e. Coordinators will emphasize that these data will be 
used to collect baseline information on the routine adherence behavior of AYA with KT and 
SB, and these data will not be repo rted to healthcare providers. Participants will receive $ 20 
(to be administe red via Greenfire Clin Card ), given  as a lump sum at the end of the 2-week  
period . Participants can track payments in the WTH  portal.   
 
After the run -in period, c oordinators will call participants to  explain the randomization 
process. Participants will be told that WTH  will randomly assign them to one of two groups 
and will notify them of their status by text. Participants will either be assigned to 1) access 
personal weekly adherence  reports by loggi ng into the WT H website or 2) receive weekly 
adherence reports automatically to their smartphone with direct feedback on their 
performance. Participants will also be told that they will receive ongoing weekly 
compensation for adherence reporting, but that the compensation structure will change and 
vary by group during the intervention so that we can learn more about the role of financial 
incentives for AYA.  
 
Study Arms: At 2 weeks , a computerized randomization scheme will be generated by WTH  
to assign part icipants to one of two arms, stratified by disease group (KT or SB), and age 
category (12 -17 vs. 18 -24). User written code in Stata 14.0 will utilize a block randomization 
scheme that, within each disease/age group stratum stratification, first randomly or ders blocks 
of size 2 and 4 and then randomly orders subjects within blocks. Due to the nature of the study, 
blinding of participants  and research staff  is not possible. However, the relying site PI’s will 
  Protocol No. 16 -013000  
   
   8 
be blinded . WTH  will send a text to each participa nt explaining the compensation scheme. 
Participants will be asked to reply yes to confirm receipt and willingness to participate. 
Additionally, coordinators will call participants at the time to explain the intervention and 
answer any questions. Subjects will be randomized as follows:  
 
Arm 1 : Participants will begin to receive daily text messages as reminders and continue to 
report real -time treatment adherence with photos. They will receive $2/week to encourage 
real-time adherence reporting. Pay is  not contingent on  meeting a target adherence score, but 
only on submitting at least one photo  per week . In addition  to the payments , participants will 
be able to log in to WTH  to see their personal dashboard with a visual display of their weekly 
adherence  performance. They will also be able to access educational resources related to their 
primary disease. Educational materials for KT recipients will include web links to pa rticipant  
resources specific for AYA, including resources publicly available through the American 
Society of Transplantation, National Kidney Foundation and the United Network for Organ 
Sharing  and educational videos created by CHOP’s care team .52-54 The major transplant 
themes that will be covered include: medication management, infection precautions, energy 
and physical activity, mental h ealth and social adjustment, nutrition, sexuality and risk 
behavior education, and vocational resources. Similarly, educational materials for the SB 
subjects will be drawn from web -based AYA -specific resources, including web links to the 
Centers for Diseas e Control Living with Spina Bifida Program and the National Spina Bifida 
Association.55,56 The major SB themes that will be covered include: bladder and bowel 
management, infection precautions, skin health, physical health, mental health and social 
adjustment, nutrition, sexuality and risk behavior, safety and vocati onal resources. All of the 
educational materials that will be used have been vetted by healthcare professionals, but every 
resource will be reviewed and adapted by the investigative team to ensure relevance, currency , 
accuracy and readability. Every month,  participants will receive a text encouraging them to 
visit the WTH educational modules and to check their earnings. WTH  is able to track usage 
of the modules by individual.  Parents/legal guardians will have access to these same 
educational materials via t heir own WTH portals. Additionally, to mitigate the minimal risk 
of this study, parents/legal guardians will be notified if their child is excessively non -adherent.  
 
Arm 2 : Participants randomized to A rm 2 will also begin  to receive daily text messages as  
reminders and report real -time treatment adherence with photos, and will have web access to 
the ed ucational modules through the WT H portal. Similarly, every month, participants will 
receive a text encouraging them to visit the WTH educational modules and to check their 
earnings. In contrast to A rm 1, they will receive their weekly performance results by text to 
their phone with tailored feedback, e.g. “Congratulations. You performed your cathing every 
time you needed to this week. Cathing regularly helps y ou prevent infections and keeps your 
kidneys healthy. Keep up the strong work!” or “You took your medicines on time 3 out of 4 
times this week. Taking medicines c an be hard. Check out the WTH  link on tips for improving 
your timing (with URL  inserted). Hang in there!” In A rm 2, participants will not receive 
$2/week for adherence reporting during this 6 -month intervention phase. Instead, they will 
receive a larger incentive of $10/week if they p erform their desired treatment behavior at least 
85% of the time. Incentive notification will be texted to participants: “Congratulations. You 
earned $10 for your hard work being consistent with cathing/taking your medicine. Way to 
take care of yourself!” or “You just missed earning $10 this week. You were really close. If 
  Protocol No. 16 -013000  
   
   9 
you remember just two more times next week, your hard work will pay off with $10 in your 
pocket and better health.”  
 
Text messages will be gain -framed, i.e. will focus on what  the partici pant has accomplished 
vs. what he /she has not. The text message bank for U -REAACT will be adapted from Dr. Lisa 
Schwartz’ prior texting intervention with AYA cancer survivors (THRIVE: Texting Health 
Resources to Inform, Motivate and Engage) which has an es tablished repository of over 120 
positively -framed motivational health messages.51  
 
Similarly to Arm 1, parents/legal guardians will have access to the same educational materials 
via their own WTH portals. Additionally, to mitigate the minimal risk of this study, 
parents/legal guardians will be notified if their child is excessively non -adherent.  
 
At the end of the intervention  phase, participants and parents/legal guardi ans, again, will 
complete the baseline questionnaires. Participants who complete their surveys within 5 days 
will receive $20. Participants who complete their surveys within 6 – 10 days will receive $10.  
 
3.1.3 Follow -up Phase  
Six months after randomization, participants will receive a message that the main study 
intervention is ending but that we will continue to track their adherence reporting to 
understand the benefits of the study. At this time,  all participants  and parents/legal guardians  
will repeat the baseline questionnaires.  Arm 1  will continue to receive reminders and report 
their daily adherence with  mobile phone  camera photography and earn $2/week for reporting, 
but they will no lon ger have access to their WT H portal, i.e. no visualization of dashboard or 
educational modules. Arm 2 will be told that incentives will be tapered. They will no lon ger 
be able to access the WTH  portal. Arm 2 participants will get $2/week for reporting during 
this follow -up period and will continue to  receive weekly adherence feedback texted to them. 
They will be eligible to receive an additional $10 for meeting their adherence target of ≥ 85% 
over a lengthened time interval. Specifically, they will receive feedback and $10 every 2 
weeks x 4 (if goal i s met over average of preceding 2 weeks), then $ 10 every month x 2 (if 
average monthly goal is met) then no incentive (beyond the $2/week for reporting) for the last 
two months. At the end of the follow -up phase, participants  and parents/legal guardians , again, 
will complete the baseline questionnaires.   Participants who complete their surveys within 5 
days will receive $20. Participants who complete their surveys within 6 – 10 days will receive 
$10. 
 
Parents/legal guardians will no longer have access to th eir WTH portal  during this phase , but 
will still receive messages if their child is excessively non -adherent.  
 
3.1.4 Study Staff Involvement  
Beyond enrolling and helping set up WTH portals, c oordinators  and/or study staff  will phone 
participants at the time of r andomization, at the end of six months and end of follow -up period 
to answer any questions. Coordinators  and/or study staff  will also contact participants if they 
fail to report adherence for more than 3 days in a row to assess barriers, such as technical 
  Protocol No. 16 -013000  
   
   10 
issues, etc.  The DCC research staff will pay participants monthly by uploading earnings to 
their Clin Cards.  Research staff will confirm the participant has possession of his/her Clin 
Card prior to loading the card with the money earned  
 
3.2 Allocation to Trea tment Groups and Blinding  
Subjects will be randomized to Arm 1 or Arm 2 via a computerized randomization sch eme 
generated by WT H to assign participants to one of two arms, stratified by disease group (KT 
or SB), and age category (12 -17 vs. 18 -24). User wri tten code in Stata 14.0 will utilize a block 
randomization scheme that, within each disease/age group stratum stratification, first 
randomly orders blocks of size 2 and 4 and then randomly orders subjects within blocks . Lead 
investigators at each site will  be blinded to which Arm their participants are in. The research 
staff must know which participants are in which Arm in order to appropriately manage each 
participant.  
3.3 Study Duration, Enrollment and Number of Sites  
3.3.1 Duration of Study  Participation  
The study duration per subject will be  12.5 months , with a 2-week run -in, 6-month 
intervention and 6-month  follow -up. 
3.3.2 Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projected  
The study will be conducted at CHOP , Boston Children’s Hospi tal, Children’s Healthcare of 
Atlanta, Seattle Children’s Hospital, Lurie’s Children of Chicago, and Children’s Mercy . 
CHOP  will act as the DCC .  
We will recruit 3 cohorts. Cohort one and two are the KT and SB subjects, respectively. Cohort 
three is the pa rent/legal guardian(s) of those enrolled in cohort one and two. Recruitment will 
stop when 200 total subjects  are recruited  in both cohort one  (KT) and cohort two  (SB) , 
respectively . It is expected that approximately 400 subjects will be enrolled between t he two 
cohorts to produce 180 evaluable KT and 180 evaluable SB subjects. Approximately 50 KT 
and 50 SB pa rticipant s will be recruited at each of the four centers . Recruitment for cohort 3 
will stop when 800 parent/legal guardian(s) are recruited. Recruitment of  the parent 
population will be dependent upon the recruitment  of cohorts one and two. Up -to 200 
parents/legal guardians may be recruited at each of the four centers.  
3.4 Study Population  
Subject s 12 to 24 years of age  and their legal parent/guardian (s) will be recruited from the 
Nephrology , Urology  and Spina Bifida  clinics at CHOP , Boston Children’s Hospital,

exclusion criteria. Subjects that  do not meet all of the enrollment criteria may not be enrolled. 
If a subject’s parent is unwilling to participate, the subject may still enroll in the study. In this 
case, clinical information about the parent, such as household income and education level , 
will not be collected. Any violations of these criteria must be reported in accordance with IRB 
Policies and Procedures.  
4 STUDY PROCEDURES   
4.1 Screening Visit  
Using the WTH  web-based research portal, a research coordinator will help subjects and their 
parents/legal guardians open an account, electronically sign an informed consent and complete 
a baseline questionnaire. The baseline questionnaire will include  the surveys list ed in section 
5.2.1 Diagnostic Tests, Scales, Measures, etc. as well as a general demographics 
questionnaire . The coordinator will explain the WTH  portal, and set -up text reminders with 
the participant ’s input.  
4.1.1 Run-In Period  
During this two -week period, a ll participants will send a photo of their medicine or catheter 
in hand at time of treatment  to the WTH phone number provided at enrollment. Participants 
will receive $20 (to be administered via Greenfire Clin Card ), regardless of their adherence 
score,  given in a lump sum at the end of the run -in period .  
  Protocol No. 16 -013000  
   
   12 
4.2 Study Treatment for Arm 1  
4.2.1 Intervention Phase  
Participants will receive daily text messages as reminders and continue to report real -time 
treatment adherence with photos. They will receive $2/week to enco urage real -time adherence 
reporting . Pay is  not contingent on  meeting a target adherence score, but only on submitting 
at least one photo  at time of treatment  per week . In addition, participants will be able to log in 
to W TH to see their personal dashboard  with a visual display of the ir weekly adherence 
performance and educational materials relevant to their disease group . Parents/legal guardians 
will have access to these same educational materials via their own WTH portals. Additionally, 
to mitigate the mi nimal risk of this study, parents/legal guardians will be notified if their child 
is excessively non -adherent. This portion of the study will last for 6 months . At the end of this 
phase , participants and parents/legal guardians will be asked to answer the baseline 
questionnaires  again . Participants who complete their surveys within 5 days will receive $20. 
Participants who complete their surveys within 6 – 10 days will receive $10.  
 
4.2.2 Follow -Up Phase  
After 6 months, participants will receive a message that the main study intervention is ending. 
At this time, participants  and parents/legal guardians, if applicable,  will be prompted to 
complete the baseline questionnaires again. Arm 1 will continue to re ceive reminders and 
report their daily adherence with  mobile phone  camera photography and earn $2/week for 
reporting.  Parents/legal guardians will continue to be notified if their child is excessively non -
adherent. Parents/legal guardians and participants  will no lo nger have access to their WT H 
portal during this period. This portion of the study will last for 6 months.  At study completion, 
participants and parents/legal guardians will be asked one final time to answer the baseline 
questionnaires. Participa nts who complete their surveys within 5 days will receive $20. 
Participants who complete their surveys within 6 – 10 days will receive $10.  
4.3 Study Treatment for Arm 2  
4.3.1 Intervention Phase  
Participants randomized to A rm 2 will also begin  to receive daily text messages as reminders 
and report real -time treatment adherence with photos, and will have web access to the 
educational modules through the WTH portal. In contrast to A rm 1, they will receive their 
weekly performance results by text to their phone with tailored feedback . In Arm 2, 
participants will receive $10 per week for adherence reporting during this 6 -month 
intervention phase if they perform their desired treatment behavior at least 85% of the time. 
Incentive notification  will be texted to participants  based on their adherence behavior.  
Parents/legal guardians will have access to these same educational materials via their own 
WTH portals. Additionally, to mitigate the minimal risk of this study, parents/legal guardians 
will be notified if their child is  excessively non -adherent.  This portion of the study will last 
for 6 months.  At the end of this phase, participants and parents/legal guardians will be asked 
to answer the baseline questionnaires again. Participants who complete their surveys within 5 
days will receive $20. Participants who complete their surveys within 6 – 10 days will receive 
$10. 
  Protocol No. 16 -013000  
   
   13 
4.3.2 Follow -Up Phase  
After 6 months, participants will receive a message that the main study intervention is ending. 
At this time,  participants  and parents/legal gua rdians  will be prompted to complete the 
baseline questionnaires again.  Arm 2 will be told that incentives will be tapered. Parents/legal 
guardians and participants  will no lon ger be able to access the WT H Portal. Arm 2 participants 
will get $2 per week for  reporting during this follow -up period and will continue to receive 
weekly adherence feedback texted to them. Parents/legal guardians will continue to be notified 
if their child is excessively non -adherent. They will be eligible to receive an additional $ 10 
for meeting their adherence target of > 85% over a 2 week period x 4 (as opposed to one  week  
during the intervention period). The incentive will then become $ 10 every month for two 
months (if the average monthly goal is met ), and finally no incentive beyond the $2 per week 
for reporting. This portion of the study will last for 6 months.  At study completion, participants 
and parents/legal guardians will be asked one final time to answer the baseline questionnaires. 
Participant s who complete their surveys within 5 days will receive $20. Participants who 
complete their surveys within 6 – 10 days will receive $10.  
4.4 Study Staff  Check -Ins 
Study staff  will phone participants at the time of randomization, at the end of six months and 
end of follow -up period to answer any questions. Study staff  will also contact participants if 
they fail to report adherence for more than 3 days in a row to assess barriers, such as technical 
issues, etc.  
4.5 Subject Completion/Withdrawal  
Study subjects may wi thdraw from the study at any time for any reason without prejudice to 
their care.  If a participant who has been randomized chooses to withdraw, a study member 
will send them a link to the Exit Survey. If the participant completes the Exit Survey within 
five days of receiving the link, the participant will be paid $10 as a thank you for their time.  
5  STUDY EVALUATIONS AND MEASUREMENTS  
5.1 Screening and Monitoring Evaluations and Measurements  
5.1.1 Medical Record Review  
• Date of birth  
• Weight and h eight

clinically relevant data.    
• No biopsies  or any other medical procedures beyond standard of c are will  be done  
solely  for this study . Study st aff will review clinical biopsy results  when chart reviews 
are completed.  
5.2 Efficacy Evaluations  
5.2.1 Diagnostic Tests, Scales, Measures, etc.  
All surveys will be administered and entered directly by and into the WT H portal. The KT 
and SB subjects will complete the same baseline executive function measure , perceived 
adherence barriers, and self -efficacy scale . Since few other forms have been valida ted in both 
disease groups, KT and SB  participants  will complete different forms measuring healthcare 
responsibility & disease knowledge.  The forms parents/legal guardians will complete are 
indicated below. Surveys will be completed at enrollment, end of intervention and study 
completion.  
Both KT and SB subject s will complete : 
• Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function  – Adult  (BRIEF -A) for participants 
over 18 & parents will complete BRIEF 2-Parent (BRIEF -P) if the subject is <18 years 
of age  
• Adolescent Medication Barrier Scale ( AMBS ) & parents will complete Parent 
Medication Barrier Sca le (PMBS)  
• Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease 6 -Item Scale  
• Way to Health Exit Survey – to be completed at withdrawal or study completion  
Only KT subject s will complete : 
• Allocation of Treatment Responsibility (ATR ) & parents will complete the Allocation 
of Treatment Responsibility – Caregiver (ATR -C)  
• Heart Transplant Knowledge questionnaire (adapted for KT)  
Only SB subject s will complete:  
• Sharing of Spina  Bifida Management Responsibilities  - Child  (SOSBMR -C) parents

5.2.2 Survey Descriptions  
• Adolescent/ Parent Medication Barriers Scale (AMBS and PMBS) is a 17 -item scale 
that examines per ceived barriers to medication adherence, in 3 categories: Disease 
Frustration/Adolescent Issues, Ingestion Issues, and Regimen Adaptation/Cognitive 
Issues. AYA answer questions on a Likert scale, from “strongly disagree” to “strongly 
agree,” with higher sc ores representing a greater amount of perceived barriers to 
treatment. For KT subjects < 18 years of age, parents will complete a parallel parent -
specific survey (PMBS). The PMBS measures the same 3 factors, plus a Parent 
Reminder item. Results of these su rveys will be recorded in the  WTH study database . 
• Allocation of Treatment Responsibility (ATR and ATR -Caregiver) : all partic ipants 
will complete the ATR; their parents will compl ete the ATR -Caregiver. The ATR 
questionnaire helps to identify who is responsi ble for the medication taking routine 
and how those responsibilities are divided between the subject  and their parent/ 
caregiver(s). The ATR is a 3 part questionnaire: Part 1: General Information on 
treatment responsibility, Part 2: Report of adolescent subject ’s treatment 
  Protocol No. 16 -013000  
   
   16 
responsibility, Part 3: Report of parent/ caregiver’s treatment responsibility. The ATR -
Caregiver has the same 3 parts.  
• Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF)  is a validated measure 
designed to assess executive function in daily life. The BRIEF 2-P (Parent version ) is 
a 63-item validated measure that documents  the parent’s perception of their child’s 
problem -solving and behavioral functioning. This form will be administered to parents 
of participants under 18 years of age. The BRIEF -A (Adult version)  is a 75 -item 
validated, self -report measure for participants 18 or older. Both study forms  take 
approximately 10 -15 minutes to complete and measure different aspects of executive 
function, such as inhibition, self -monitoring, organization, planning, and emotional 
control. The BRIEF is scored against population normative data and reported as an 
overall summary score with subscales and two broad indexes (behavioral regulation 
and metacognition). Both versions of the BRIEF have high reliability, validity and 
clinical utility across diverse disease populations and age groups.  
• Heart Transplant Knowle dge Questionnaire (adapted for KT) is a 20 -question survey 
used to assess the participants understanding of their medication, transplant and 
healthcare plan. The survey resembles a quiz, with each multiple choice and true/false 
question having only one cor rect answer.   
• Knowledge of Spina Bifida (KOSB)  is an 18 -item survey assessed as a summary 
score.57 Higher scores indicate greater knowledge.  
• Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease 6 -Item Scale is a Likert -scale survey that 
measures the following six domains of self -efficacy: (1) fatigue, (2) physical 
discomfort, (3) emotional distress, (4) symptoms or health problems, (5) health -related 
self-management tasks and (6) taking medicines.58 Each item is answered o n a 10 -
point Likert scale, with higher scores representing greater healthcare self -efficacy.  
• Sharing of Spina Bif ida Management Responsibilities – Child and – Parent 
(SOSBMR -C and -P) measure  perceived responsibility for health -related tasks, asking 
who to ok responsibility, child, parent or equal, for 34 health -related tasks pertaining 
to SB.  
• Spina Bifida Barriers and Cathing Barriers Measures are two barriers measures 
combined into one survey for ease of administration. The first, SB Barriers, was used 
in a prior study by Dr. Alexandra Psihogios , a member of the DCC study staff. This 
measure was adapted from a validated diabetes barriers scale and asks subject s about 
their perceived barriers to proper care. The Cathing Barriers Measure is not formally 
validated b ut showed content validity in a recent study.59 The survey asks subjects to 
indicate the items that make cathing difficult and then to rank the top three items out 
of those indicated. To our knowledge, there are no validated measure s that address 
perceived barriers to cathing for the SB population.  
• Way to Health Exit Survey measure s the efficacy of the Way to Health portal as a tool 
for the research and engagement of AYA with a kidney transplant of spina bifida in 
  Protocol No. 16 -013000  
   
   17 
their health care ma nagement. This measure was developed by the study research 
team; it asks about the participants’ attitude towards the portal, the study and asks 
about the effectiveness of the portal.  
6 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS    
6.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint for this pilot clinical  trial is to  compare the efficacy of two 6 -month 
mhealth -based interventions to promote treatment adherence among AYA with KT or SB.  
The independent variable  in the analyses for A im 1 is exposure to feedback + incentive  
(intervention, A rm 2). The dependent variable , or primary outcome measure, is: change in 
the proportion of weeks with adherence behavior ≥ 85% expected between baseline (run -in 
period) and intervention period . Weekly adherence proportions will be calculated by 
observing th e number of non -missed/late treatment episodes over the total number of episodes 
in that week.  
 
The outcome will then be the proportion of weeks with treatment adherence ≥ 85%. 
Participants who  do not submit the correct number of pictures within the presc ribed window 
of their expected time due for treatment will be counted as nonadherent for that episode of 
med tak ing/cathing. Over the study period, changes in weekly timing adherence will be 
assessed as a repeated measure over time. In secondary analysis, we will examine variability 
in inter -dose intervals (based on time -stamping of photos) to account for doses that are taken 
beyond the time window.  
 
6.2 Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoin t for SB subjects is change in bladder wall compliance  as assessed by 
urodynamic  studies (UDS) at study entry and study end . 
We expect that SB subject s who perform CIC as prescribed will experience either no change 
or improvement in bladder compliance compared with those who do not improve their CIC 
adherence  behavior. We expect nonadherence with CIC to result in either no change or 
worsening from baseline .  
For KT subjects, the secondary endpoint is chan ge in CV  of immunosuppressive drug levels 
(tacrolimus or sirolimus) between the baseline (run -in) and inter vention period. CV of 
immunosuppressive drug levels will be compared with the real -time adherence measures of 
mobile phone camera reporting.  
Other important outcomes examined in exploratory analysis include rejection, de novo donor 
specific antibody accum ulation, graft loss and death.  
6.3 Tertiary Endpoints  
The tertiary endpoint is to identify psychosocial correlates of adh erence changes in AYA with 
KT and  SB. We hypothesize that improved treatment adherence from baseline to intervention 
  Protocol No. 16 -013000  
   
   18 
end will be mediated by increases in self -efficacy and healthcare responsibility and declines 
in perceived barriers , but will not be related to knowledge gained. We also hypothesize that 
we will observe greater changes in self -efficacy in Arm 2 vs. Arm 1 b ecause of the specifi cally 
targeted  text messages that emphasiz e people’s progress and ability to perform difficult 
behavior. For this Aim, all participants will complete the baseline survey measures of self -
efficacy, healthcare responsibility, perceived barriers and knowledge  again at the end of the 
6-month intervention via WT H. The independent variables  in the analyses for Aim 3 are: 1) 
change in self -efficacy score 2) change in healthcare responsibility score 3) change in 
perceived barriers and 4) change in knowledge score f rom baseline to end of intervention. The 
dependent variable , or primary outcome measure, is: change in the proportion of weeks with 
adherence behavior performance ≥ 85% prescribed/expected between baseline (run -in 
period) and intervention period . A seconda ry analysis will examine usage of the education al 
modules viewed in the WT H portal. Usage will be tracked as yes/no and time spent. We 
hypothesize that increased usage will associate with increased knowledge but will have no 
effect on increased treatment a dherence. Prior research supports the hypothesis that increased 
knowledge is not sufficient to promote positive health behavior . 
6.4 Quaternary Endpoints  
The quaternary objective is to evaluate differences in comorbiditie s and demographic data of 
lost to follow up participants to  that of those who are complete the  study intervention. We 
hypothesi ze participants  with comorbid or more severe conditions may be less likely to 
complete or participate  in the  study.  
6.5 Statistical M ethods  
Clinical and demographic variables will be compared with chi -square or two -sample t -tests 
for parametric and Fisher’s exact or Wilcoxon rank -sum tests for non -parametric data. 
Treatment groups will be compared with similar analyses to confirm equity  in randomization. 
We will compare change over time in % adherence between arms by fitting quasi -least squares 
(QLS) and generalized estimating equation (GEE) longitudinal models. The QLS/GEE 
models include a regression model for the primary outcome variab le, in addition to a separate 
model for the correlation amongst the repeated measures on each subject. The AR (1) 
correlation structure is plausible because it forces a decline between measures with increasing 
separation in time; however, we will assess th e sensitivity of results to choice of structure. In 
addition, the models will include treatment group and a time by treatment group interaction. 
If the interaction term differs significantly from zero, this will indicate that the change over 
time differs s ignificantly between treatment groups. All analyses will follow the intention -to-
treat principle. We will analyze the results for each disease group (SB, KT) separately, 
although the overall analytical models are the same.  
Analysis f or Aim 1  and Aim 2 will utilize GEE/QLS models to compare the change over time 
in the outcome between arms.  
 
For Aim 3, Pearson’s or Spearman’s Correlations will be calculated to observe the association 
between outcome and each independent variable.  
The statistical analysis will  follow the intention -to-treat principle.  
  Protocol No. 16 -013000  
   
   19 
6.6 Sample Size and Power  
The disease groups (KT or SB) will be analyzed separately in the primary analysis. We assume 
180 KT and 180 SB recipients will complete the study, allowing for 10% drop -outs. With 90 
participa nts per arm per disease group, setting alpha at 0.05, we will have >90% power to 
detect a medium effect size of 0.5 in timing change in proportion of timing adherence, using 
a two group t -test (based on TAKE -IT). Based on preliminary data from TAKE IT and 
published studies, it is reasonable to expect an average of 8% improvement in timing 
adherence when a behavioral economics model with financial incentives is applied.53,57,104 An 
effect size of 0.50 would be observed if the difference in average improvement was 8% 
between groups, while the  standard deviation of post minus pre improvement was 16. With 
90 subjects per arm, the detectable effect size is also 0.50 for Aim 2. For Aim 3, a 0.050 two -
sided Fisher's z test of the null hypothesis that the Pearson correlation coefficient is 0 will 
have 82% power to detect a correlation of 0.300 when the sample size is 90 .  
 
7 SAFETY MANAGEMENT  
7.1 Clinical Adverse Events  
Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study.  
7.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, SAEs are not expected. If any 
unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others happen 
during the course of this study (includin g SAEs) these will be reported to the IRB in 
accordance with CHOP IRB SOP 408: Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects. 
AEs that are not serious but that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will be 
summarized in narrative or other fo rmat and submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing 
review. The D ata Safety Management Board (DSMB)  will review all adverse events.  
This study supports and encourages bi -directional messaging. Because of this capability, study 
participants may reveal sensitive and serious thoughts or feelings, such as the desire to kill 
oneself, the occurrence of a serious medical incident requiring immediate medical attention Table 3 . Anticipated Pa rticipan t Enrollment

and other possibilities. While we expect events like this to be rare, we have implemented the  
following protocol to ensure these events are handled efficiently and effectively.  
1. Study personnel will review participant -derived messages daily.  
2. If a participant reaches out without the portal prompting him/her, an incident report is 
generated and sent to the site’s research coordinator and the team project managers 
(DCC personnel).  
3. Relying site coordinators are responsible for monitoring and addr essing their site’s 
incident reports and messages between normal working hours (0800 -1700) Mondays 
through Fridays. The DCC is responsible for monitoring and ad dressing any incident 
reports and  messages at all other times outsi de of the window mentioned . 
4. If the content of the message (whether sent when prompted, reviewed in step 1, or sent 
when not prompted) indicates a serious adverse event,  the coordinator who discovered 
the message  will first contact  the DCC PI, Dr. Sandra Amaral . 
5. Dr. Amaral  will dec ide how to proceed.  Options include, but are not limited to, 
contacting the local treatment team, the team psychologist or an emergency response 
team.   
6. If the coordinator cannot reach Dr. Amaral , the coordinator will contact the  DCC 
psychologist,  Dr. Lisa Schwartz .   
A list of emergency contacts, including national hotlines for suicide prevention, child abuse 
support and more, is available to all study team members, and is attached to the eIRB 
application in section 12.  Study personnel are instruc ted to have a low -threshold for contacting 
emergency response teams.   
7.3 Incidental Findings  
In rare cases, during the course of study procedures a participant may be found to demonstrate 
clinically significant incidental findings, such as sign s of depressio n or domestic abuse . 
Members of the study team may consult with the psychologist or appropriate clinician to 
determine whether such a finding has enough health importance to the research participant to 
mandate or permit disclosure. At the study team’s disc retion, a qualified investigator or 
facilitator will inform the participant and/or the participant’s family of the incidental finding 
at the next study visit. If the incidental finding is discovered at the last visit, every effort will 
be made to contact t he participant by phone. The participant and/or the participant’s family 
will be referred to an appropriate clinician or resource for follow -up when deemed necessary 
by the study team.  
8  STUDY ADMINISTRATION  
8.1 Treatment Assignment Methods  
8.1.1 Randomization   
Subje cts will be randomized to either Arm 1 or Arm 2, stratified by disease group (KT or SB) 
and age category (12 -17 vs. 18 -24) via user written code in Stata 14.0. The code will utilize a 
block randomization scheme that, within each disease/age group stratum s tratification, first 
randomly orders blocks of size 2 and 4 then randomly orders subjects within blocks.  
  Protocol No. 16 -013000  
   
   21 
8.1.2 Blinding  
Due to the nature of the study, it is not possible to blind subjects to their treatment assig nment 
once they are assigned. Lead investigators at each site will be blinded to which Arm their 
participants are in. The research staff must know which participants are in which Arm in order 
to appropriately manage each participant.  
8.2 Data Collection and Management  
Each study subject will be assigned a s tudy ID at the time of enrollment , which will serve as 
the means of protecting personal health information during data transfers and storage.   
EPIC medical record will be entered into REDCap and study que stionnaire data will be 
entered into the WTH  platform . Coded electronic adherence data  (i.e. picture messages)  will 
be downloaded from the web -based mobile messaging service, Twilio, directly to the WTH  
Platform via secure data transfer.  An additional data transfer will be used to extract a coded 
analytic data set to  the CHOP server for analysis.  
Way to Health Platform:  
All personal information that the participant is asked to provide will be collected via WTH . 
WTH  collects  subjects’ names, dates of birth , addresses,  email addresses,  and phone number s. 
They  also request the name and phone number of an alternate contact. To assure that 
participant confidentiality is preserved, individual identifiers are stored in a single password 
protected system that is accessible only to study research, analysis and  IT staff. An 
investigator or statistician who logs in will be able to access only coded  data. The WTH  
administrative group and research coordinators responsible for contacting participants for 
follow -up study visits or responding to questions about the st udy are able to view participant 
names and contact information.   
The WTH web development team and Project Director currently have administrative access 
to PHI.  All of these personnel will have completed Human Subjects Protection and HIPAA 
privacy training . The system automatically generates logs of all data queries which can be 
reviewed by research staff to ensure that no unauthorized persons have gained access to 
identifiable information. This system is hosted on site at The University of Pennsylvania 
(UPenn) and is protected by a secure firewall and several layers of operational security. Once 
a participant has been entered into this system, they are given a unique study identification 
number (ID). Any datasets and computer files that leave the firewall a re stripped of all 
identifiers and individuals are referred to by their study ID. The study ID is also used on all 
analytical files . 
The Penn Medicine Academic Computing Services (PMACS) is the hub for the hardware and 
database infrastructure that supp orts the project and the WT H web portal is built on this 
infrastruct ure. The data collected for WT H based studies is stored in My Structured Que ry 
Language databases on a PMACS -operated blade server environment devoted specifically to 
WTH . The data center is h oused in Information Systems and Computing at 3401 Walnut 
Street. All data are stored in a single relational database, allowing researchers to correct 
mistakes. Every Structured Query Language (SQL) transaction, including accessing and 
changing data, is lo gged for auditing purposes. Data are entered into the database through 
  Protocol No. 16 -013000  
   
   22 
several different mechanisms. Participants enter their own personal information and respond 
to surveys through a PHP -based web interface. Researchers have a separate interface that 
allows them to manually enter data if needed. Data from biometric/ monitoring devices are 
uploaded automatically , this includes data from mobile phones such as picture or text 
messaging . Datasets are blinded of all personally identifiable information when expor ted for 
analysis. The web application automatically removes all identifiers when a researcher requests 
an analytic dataset. The only people with access to identifiable participant information are 
pre-specified Research Coordinators responsible for contacti ng participants for follow -up. 
Personal information and research data will be stored in separate SQL tables and will be linked 
by a computer -generated ID number. Additionally, any information that leaves this system to 
communicate with third party data sou rces (biometrics devices, survey software, etc.) is 
stripped of any identifiers and transmitted in encrypted format. The same unique study ID is 
used to link these outside data to the participants.  
The WTH  Research Data Center staff is responsible for prev enting unauthorized access to the 
trial participant tracking system database. The secure servers are located in a specially 
designed, highly secured facility at UPenn with dedicated uninterrupted power supply and 
strictly limited access. The study will uti lize a client -server deployed Data Management 
System rather than a 'Store and Forward' database configuration, obviating research site 
database security concerns. Confidential participant information will  be entered into the 
database. Thereafter, confident ial information will be made available to authorized users only 
as specifically needed. No one can gain access to an individual SQL database table unless 
explicitly granted a user ID, password, and specific access. Even those with user names and 
passwords cannot gain access to the tables that contain the identifying participant information.  
No results will be reported in a personally identifiable manner. All tracking system data will 
be password -protected with several levels of protection. The first will al low access to the 
operating system of the computer. The second will allow access to the basic menus of the 
integrated system; within certain menu options, such as database browsing, a thir d password 
will be required. WTH’s team’s  prior research employing s imilar precautions has 
demonstrated that these techniques are very successful in assuring the protection of subjects.  
The same procedure used for the analysis of automated data sources to ensure protection of 
participant  information will be used for the su rvey data, in that subject  identifiers will be used 
only for linkage purposes or to contact subject s. The study identification number, and not 
other identifying information, will be used on all data collection instruments.  
Each investigator and staff member involved in the proposed study will sign and adhere to a 
Standard Operating Procedure for managing participant data through the WTH platform and 
has participated in required IRB/HIPAA compliance training. We will also continue to make 
use of passwor d protection programs for all computerized records. In no instances will 
identifying information be publicly disclosed. Prior to conducting any analyses, all identifiers 
(e.g., names, medical record numbers, birth dates, etc.) will be removed. Results from  this part 
of the investigation will be reported in aggregate.  
1) Questionnaire Data:  
  Protocol No. 16 -013000  
   
   23 
This study will use the online survey tool Qualtrics to collect answers to survey questions 
from participan ts. The DCC r esearch staff will build the surveys in Qualtrics and connect them 
to the WTH platform. Then participants will enter survey answers directly on their personal, 
password -protected WTH dashboard.  Study staff members will review the survey content to 
ensure that no questions in any of the surveys ask for participant identifiers. To ensure no 
participant identifiable data is stored by Qualtrics, randomly generated 64 bit identifiers are 
used to link responses in Qualtrics to study events in the system. No PHI will ever be stored 
by this application in Qualtric s. 
2) Electronic Adherence Data : 
Following enrollment and completion of the participant’s WTH profile, a research coordinator 
will help connect the participant’s mobile device to the study’s Twilio account. Twilio is a 
third party provider that supplies a unique mobile number with bidirectional, automatable 
SMS and picture messaging capabilities. If the participants do not have a phone  with picture -
taking capabilities , researchers  will provide one.  Data from Twilio will be uploaded 
automatically to the WTH platform. Once uploaded to WTH, the cellular transmission will 
have  no participant -identifying information  and after it is received  in the platform, the content 
will be deleted from the Twilio servers.  No IP addresses are collected during this information 
transfer. The coded daily adherence data will then be available to the study team on the secure, 
password -protected WTH  platform .  
The WTH  portal applies security and privacy requirements generated by the HIPAA Security 
Rule and subsequently the HITECH req uirements.  Currently, the data is encrypted at rest and 
in motion in accordance with these laws and is certified  by FDA.   
3) EPIC  Medical Record Data:  
Study staff will extract relevant data (see section 5.1.1 Medical Record Review) from EPIC 
into REDCap  via individual chart review. Individual subject data will be labeled with the 
subjec t’s st udy ID upon population of REDCap  for subsequent storage and data analysis.  
Medical Recor d Review data will be managed and stored using the research -focused 
electronic web -based data capture system REDCap .  
• Data listed in section 5.1.1 will be entered directly into REDCap. For exact data, 
please see the attached Medical Record Review survey (s ection 12.02  of our 
application)  
• Research staff from relying sites will be on -boarded as external colla borators under 
the umbrella of Data A ccess Groups. These coordinators will only have access to 
their site ’s participant data . Research staff from the DCC  will have access to all 
sites’ data.  
• Research staff at all sites will be required to obtain a Medical Authorization form to 
release/obtain patient information from the local institution to obtain medical record 
data of participant’s transitioning to anot her institution for medical care during the 
study period. Method  of receiving medical records data for participant’s that consent 
to release of information  will be determined by the institution’s policy for sharing 
data.  
  Protocol No. 16 -013000  
   
   24 
• The following de-identification op tions will be used , when  necessary, when  
exporting dat a for analysis: removing known i dentifier fields, hashing of record 
names, removing invalidated Text fields, Notes fields, or date fields and date 
shifting.  
Data backup is performed nightly via a dedicated backup system.  The backup environment 
is maintained by a dedicated staff using dedicated resources.  Access to the backup 
environment is restricted to Research Information Systems staff.  
Some medical record data will be stored in WTH as well. Th is data includes the 
participant’s date of birth, address, email address and phone number.  
Data Transfer Description  
1.) Twilio  to Way to Health platform: every day, deidentifed study adherence data will be 
downloaded from Twilio  to the WTH  platform. WTH code automates this transfer of data.  
Once data are received in the platform, the content will be deleted from the Twilio servers.  
2.) Way to Health to Site Server: Coded data from the study visits, including initial survey, 
follow -up surveys, and adherenc e data will be converted to a CSV file and uploaded onto the 
CHOP server  to a dedicated research folder on the study PI’s virtual desktop  (shared drive) . 
No PHI will be involved in this transfer, only the subject’s study ID.   
All transferred and created f iles will be stored in a password -protected folder available only 
to study staff in the lead investigator’s CHOP virtual desktop. All identifiers will be deleted 
following publication of the study results.  
Study Recruitment Tracking File:  
This password -protected Microsoft Excel file , saved on the PI’s virtual desktop (shared drive)  
will include participant -identifying information necessary for registra tion, enrollment, and 
follow -up. Following enrollment, this document will be used to maint ain a log of enro lled 
subject s. For families who are not enrolled, subject -identifying information will be destroyed.  
A non -identifiable list of subject s that were not enrolled will be retained for the purpose of 
calculating response rate.   
Consent Forms : 
Electronic copies of the consent forms will be stored in a password -protected f older on the 
PI’s virtual desktop ( shared drive ). Participants will have access to the consent form 
throughout the study, via their WTH dashboard. If a participant turns 18 duri ng the study, they 
will be re -consented by signing an electronic form through the WTH platform .  
Anonymization : 
Data will be extracted from the secure W TH platform fo r the purpose of data analysis.  Any 
datasets and computer files that leave the W TH firewal l will be stripped of all identifiers and 
individuals will be referred to by their study ID. The study ID will also be used on all analytical 
files.  
  Protocol No. 16 -013000  
   
   25 
8.3 Confidentiality   
Access to the systems used f or this project, including the WTH  database, will be limited t o 
staff who meet all relevant training requirements and are assigned to (or  support) this project. 
Security procedures will follow the CHOP Information System Security Plan and in 
accordance with the National Institute of Standards and Technology Special P ublication 
guidelines. All staff will have completed the Human Subjects Protection Training.  
Electronic adherence monitoring data associated with the mobile application will be 
maintained by WTH , Inc. WTH  has designed their database to comply with HIPAA 
regulations.  Survey responses will  also be stored on the WTH  platform. The site is HIPAA 
compliant. The data are maintained on secure serve rs that are password -protected. Please see 
Secti on 8.2 for measures taken to assure confidentiality.   
All resul ts will be kept confidential and separate from the medical record. WTH  will assign a 
study identification number to each subject, and all data will be coded under this number. The 
master list of subject  names and identification numbers will be stored in a password protected 
excel file on a password protected computer. Only the study PI and study staff will have access 
to this excel file and password . Only the PI and assistant(s) directly involved in the research 
project will have access to the survey data.  
No identifiable data will be used for future study without first obtaining IRB approval. The 
master list, linking PHI to study ID numbers, will be destroyed six years after data analysis is 
complete, in compliance with CHOP’s data retention plan policy (A -3-9). Way to Health 
permissions will be adjusted so no PHI will be viewable by study staff .. 
8.4 Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
8.4.1 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
A DSMB  will be convened as needed , at least once annually,  to ensure participant  safety and 
study integrity. This board will consist of 4 faculty members , Drs. Nadia Downshen, Laura 
Mee, Jodie Smith and biostatistician Hauquin Zhoa,  who are not directly involved in this 
research study. Specifically, at least one member will be a psychologist  (Dr. Laura Mee). The 
DSMB will routinely assess issues of data quality, study fidelity and conduct, and adverse 
events. In the unlikely event of an adverse outcome associated with the study protocol, it will 
be immediately reported by investigators to the DSMB, the institutional IRBs and t o the NIH, 
as appropriate. Any SAEs  will be reported immediately to the principal investigator and the 
DSMB. At which time, a conference call will be set up for DSMB members to assess the event 
and mak e recommendations of action. The DSMB will also review interim and final data 
results to ensure no unanticipated harm (in terms of adherence behavior) occurred in either  
the intervention or comparison group . The DSMB will be apprised of study progress by e mail 
at a minimum of every 6 months.  
8.4.2 Risk Assessment   
There are no greater than minimal risks to subjects of this study. This is a randomized p hase 
II clinical trial  that will use p articipan t clinical data obtained as part of routine medical care. 
Subjects  in this study will not receive any additional medical procedures, such as biopsies or 
  Protocol No. 16 -013000  
   
   26 
lab work, beyond standard of care. Clinical data will be captured from the medical record 
database. This database is password protected and pr ivilege for access is limit ed.  
Subject s may decline to answer any question on any survey for any reason.  
8.4.3 Potential Benefits of Trial Participation  
Nonadherence, in both KT and SB populations, has grave consequences, including graft loss 
and dialysis  for KT patients and kidney dama ge and failure for SB patients . Participants  may 
benefit directly from this study by experiencing improved adherence  and increased self -
efficacy . Information gained from this study wil l help to identify whether this type of 
intervention is  feasible and pot entially effective. Thus, subjects enrolled in this study may 
provide indirect benefit to others by helping to set a path toward establishing evidence -based, 
effective interventions that impact longitudinal adolescent nonadherence and allograft /spina 
bifid a outcomes.  
8.4.4 Risk -Benefit Assessment  
In relation to the potential benefit of this study, the risks of this study are small.  Coordinators 
will closely supervise participants’ adherence and parents/legal guardians will also be notified 
if adherence behavior becomes erratic to minimize the risk further.  
8.5 Recruitment Strategy  
Eligible subject s will be identified by screening the medical  records of patients in the  
outpatient Nephrology , Urology  and Spina Bifida  clinics  of the four participating sites . A 
member of  the research team will ask the clinici an’s permission to approach eligible 
subject s in person or by telephone and offer information about the study.  Where 
appropriate, subjects may be consented by phone by the study coordinator and be 
prompted to sign the electronic consent. Brochures with information about the study 
including inclusion criteria, study procedures and the contact information for study 
personnel  will be available in clinic . Furthermore, the study staff may show an eligible 
patient the Welcome to U -REAACT video in clinic. Each site may use this video to post 
on media sources such as Nephrology and Urology departmental  electronic newsletter s, 
on their department website, or on their department social media page to teach patients 
about the study.  When posting this link, the following description will be provided: U-
REAACT uses text reminders, positive messaging and rewards to help keep teens with 
kidney transplants and spina bifida healthy. Contact [insert contact information here]  to 
ask if you may be eligible for this research study!  
 
8.6 Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization  
Those who choose to enroll in this study will be required to  read a thorough description of the 
study objectives and methods. A member of the study staff  will present the study consent form 
(electronically or hard copy) to each pa rticipan t and parent /legal guardian  and address any 
questions or concerns at the time of consent. Subject s less than 18 years of age will be required 
to provide verbal and written /electronic  assent and also to obtain written /electronic  parental 
consent. Subject s over 18 years of age will be required to provide written consent for 
  Protocol No. 16 -013000  
   
   27 
themselves . Subjects who consented or received parental consent may participate without their 
parent/legal guardians enrolling in the study. Parents/legal guardians of all subjects will be 
required to provide writte n consent for themselves to participate in this stu dy. The IRB has 
waived consent and HIPAA authorization for the child’s absent parent/legal guardian in the 
case that both parents/legal guardians are not present at time of enrollment.  The waiver s will 
occur for the purpose of collecting demographic information about the absent parent/legal 
guardian, such as income and education level. If both parents/legal guardians are present then 
both will be consented.  Parents/legal guardians of eligible subje cts may not participate if their 
child chose not to enroll in this study. It will be clearly stated, both verbally and within the 
text of the written /electronic  consent, that participation in the study is voluntary and the 
decision to participate or declin e participation will have no bearing on the medical care of the 
subject. Prospective subjects may take a paper  consent form home to consi der their interest in 
the study. No study procedures will take place prior to receiving a signed consent form.  If the 
participant turns 18 years of age during the study , the subject will be prompted to re -consent 
by the Way to Health portal on or immediately after his/her 18th birthday and a new consent 
will be available to the participant via a direct URL and via his/her personal portal dashboard. 
The study team will be notified via text or email to call the participant to discuss the consenting 
process again and answer any questions.  
8.7 Payment to Subjects/Families  
Participants with a kidney transplant or the spina bifida diagnosis will be administered a 
Greenfire ClinCard at the time of enrollment. All compensation to the participant will be done 
electronically and participants will be able to access their funds onc e their card is activated by 
the DCC. All payments and prizes will be given to the adolescent or young adult. Parents will 
not be compensated. In the paragraphs below, the term participant refers to the AYA.  
Participants will receive  a lump sum of $20 at the end of the 2-week run-in interval  if they 
have sent at least one photo during this time . After the run -in period, all participants will be 
paid monthly  dependent on their participation . Participants will receive a monthly text 
message, sent via  WTH or the Green phire website , prompting them to check t heir money 
earned on the WT H portal.  
Participants randomized to Arm 1  will receive $2/week throughout the entirety of the 6 -month 
intervention period and the 6 -month follow -up period to encourag e real -time adherence 
reporting. Pay is not contingent on meeting a target adherence score, but only on submitting 
at least one photo at time of treatment per week.  
Participants randomized to  Arm 2  will receive a larger incentive of $10/week if they perform 
their desired treatment behavior at least 85% of the time. During the follow -up period, Arm 2 
participants will get $2 per week for reporting. They will be eligible to receive an additional 
$10 for meeting their adherence target of > 85% over a 2 week period (as  opposed to one week 
during the intervention period). The incentive will then become $ 10 every month (if the 
average monthly goal is met), and finally no incentive beyond the $2 per week for reporting.  
Participants in both arms who complete surveys at  baseline, post intervention and post follow -
up within 5 days  of administration  will receive $20  (per survey set) . Participants who complete 
surveys  within 6 – 10 days of administration will receive $10  (per survey set) . Participants

with partially complete sur veys, will not be eligible to receive survey compensation for the 
data coll ection  time point.  The DCC  study staff will monitor taking behaviors and reports 
generated by the WTH  platform to discern the amount of money owed to the participants 
every month . The amount owed will then be uploaded to each participant’s ClinCard. To 
ensure participants are still in possession of study payment cards , study  staff will contact 
participants at time of payment  before allocating funds to the cards.  
Furthermore, after  subjects are consented and enrolled, they may earn small tokens of 
appreciation during the study to thank them for  their continued participation. These tokens 
will be valued at ≤ $10 per item and may include such items as cell phone/smart phone covers, 
ear buds or water bottles . Subject s only be informed about the potential to receive such tokens 
for the completion of baseline surveys. They will not be informed about the potential to 
receive such tokens for the completion of future surveys  nor will any tok ens be provided prior 
to the consent process so as to not coerce subject s in any way.  Subjects can earn these tokens 
by accumulating prize points. Prize points are administered when participants complete their 
intervention and follow -up surveys in a timely  manner. 20 points/survey are earned for 
completing a survey on the day it is administered. Prize points decrease by 5 points/survey 
per day uncompleted until the potential to earn points is zero. Participants can earn up to 220 
points. These points are re deemable for the aforementioned tokens , with 1 00 points 
approximately equivalent to a $10 item.  
If a participant chooses to withdraw from the study, they will receive a text throu gh the Way 
to Health portal thanking them for their participation and asking them for their feedback with 
a link to the exit survey. They may earn a $10 payment to their ClinCard if they choose to 
complete this survey within five days, as to mimic the compensation they would have received 
for completing this survey at the end of th e study. All participants will have the option to 
complete this survey; participants who complete the study may earn prize points for the exit 
survey, along with their other follow -up surveys .  
9 INTENTION FOR PUBLICATION  
The research staff intends to submit  a minimum of two manuscripts for publication in peer -
reviewed journals. Additionally, throughout the duration of the study, research staff will 
submit abstracts and posters to present at conferences hosted by organizations such as the 
American Society of Nephrology, the Eastern Society of Pediatric Research, the American 
Transplant Conference and more.

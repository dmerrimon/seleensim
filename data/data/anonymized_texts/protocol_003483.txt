PROT OCOL  TITLE:
1.Objectives
1.1.Describe the purpose, speciﬁc aims, or objectives.
1.2.State the hypotheses to be tested.
We propose a pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate morphine vs methadone  treatment ofinfants with in-utero opiate exposure. Speciﬁcally, length of treatment, need for additionalmedication to treat withdrawal, and length of hospital stay will be compared.
2.Background
2.1.Describe the relevant prior experience and gaps i n current knowledge.
2.2.Describe any relevant preliminary data.
2.3.Provide the scientiﬁc or scholarly background f or, rationale for, and si gniﬁcance of theresearch based on the existing literature and how  will it add t o existing knowledge.
Over the last ten years there has been a striking increase in opi ate abuse in pregnant women, andthe optimal care for neonatal abstinence syndrome is now an important publ ic health issue.Neonates exposed to opiates in utero can develop a constellation of  withdrawal symptoms knownas neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) that includes CNS irritability, gastrointestinal sideeﬀects and autonomic dysfunction1. Infants with NASare at risk for multiple medicalcomplications including failure to thrive and seizures, they often require prolonge d hospi tal staysand account for signiﬁcant health care costs. From 2009 t o 2012 t he incidence of NAS increasedfrom 3.4 to 5.8 per 1000 hospital births, for a total of 21
 732 aﬀected infants2. The average lengthof stay for infants withNAS is 16.9 days, and admissionsfor NAS account for an estimated $1.5billion in hospital charges2. 
Between 21% to 94% of exposed infants develop signs of withdrawal severe enough t o warrantpharmacologic treatment1,5,6.Investigators haverecently shown that stringent weaning protocolsdecrease neonatal opiate exposure and length of hospital stay3,7.Multiple protocols for opiateweans exist, including methadone, morphine, and no w buprenorphine, however evidencesurrounding the optimal treatment regimen is conﬂicting. While one study c omparing m ethadoneto morphine for infants with NAS demonstrated no si gniﬁcant diﬀerence in length of hospitalstay,3others have found decreased length of staywith methadone4. These studies have useddiﬀerent weaning protocols and have not calculated morphine equivalents between study a rms,making direct comparisons between morphine and m ethadone  diﬃcult. 
Methadone has been the standard of care for opioid abuse treatment in pregnancy since the1970s. At University of New Mexico, infants expos ed to opi ates including m ethadone  or heroinin-utero who develop NAS requiring pharmacologic treatment unde rgo a treatment wean withmethadone, whereas infants exposed to buprenorphine unde rgo a wean with morphine.  Ho wever,morphine is used frequently to treat neonatal abstinence syndrome among m ethadone -expos edinfants throughout the US. Anecdotal evidence at our institution sugge sts that infants treated withmorphine have shorter hospital stays compared to infants treated with methadone .

3.Study Design
3.1.Describe the study design (e.g., observational; randomi zed placebo-controlled clinicaltrial, etc.)
This study is a pilot randomized controlled clinical trial of morphine versus methadone  for thetreatment of neonatal withdrawal syndrome for neonates expos ed to opi ates other thanbuprenorphine in utero.
3.2.Describe blinding, if applicable
Since we are using existing treatment protocols that include diﬀerent timing intervals ofmedication administration between methadone  and m orphine, neither nursing staﬀ norphysicians can be blinded.
4.Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
4.1.Describe how individuals will be screened for eligibility
Initial screening will include all infants with in –ut ero expos ure to opi ates other thanbuprenorphine, including methadone, heroin, and pr escription opi ates.  In utero-expos ure will bedetermined by self-reported opiate use in pregnancy and ur ine drug screen posi tive for opiatesand/or methadone on admission to the hospital.

PROT OCOL  TITLE:
4.2.Describe the criteria that deﬁne who will be included or excluded in your ﬁnal  studysample.
Infants will be eligible if they are born at UNM Hospital at greater than 34 we eks gestation, a ndif their primary in-utero drug exposure was and opi ate other than buprenorphine, as evidencedby maternal history and a maternal or infant urine drug screen posi tive for methadone  and/oropiates on admission.  Infants will be excluded if they are born prior to 34 we eks, requireneonatal intensive care unit stay greater than 24 hour s, have any serious medical comorbidities,and if the primary substance exposure in-utero was buprenorphine, or was not opiates.
4.3.Indicate speciﬁcally whether you will include each of the following special popul ations:(You may not include members of the above popul ations as subjects in your researchunless you indicate this in your inclusion criteria.)
•Adults unable to consent
•Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers)
•Pregnant women
•Prisoners
Our study population is newborns only.
1.4.Indicate if you excluding any particular popul ations (e.g., women, children, pe rsons notﬂuent in English, a particular racial or ethnic group, e tc.) and pr ovide justiﬁcation
We will exclude infants whose consenting parent or guardian is not ﬂuent in Engl ish orSpanish. Based on our current Milagro clinic popul ation, non- English speaking families areextremely rare. We will include a Spanish short-consent form in the case of unanticipatedSpanish speaking families.
2.Number of Subjects
2.4.If this is a multicenter study, indicate the total numbe r of subjects to be accrued acrossall sites.
N/a
2.5.Indicate the number of subjects to be recruited at this site.
100 infants.  This estimate is based on historical review of the num ber of infants expos ed tomethadone or heroin in utero delivered at UNM per year. We are increasing the recruitment goalto 100 after ﬁnding our overall birth rate is lower and the infant withdrawal rate is lower thanexpected due to changes in hospital policies since the withdrawal rate was last calculated (i.e.rooming-in). The recruitment will take place over 2 ye ars.
2.6.Provide sample size justiﬁcation
Note 1: When studies involve consent, an individual is considered a research subject oncethey have provided consent.  If the research includes screening pr ocedures after consent,please indicate the number of subjects that need to be recruited and t he numbe r that willactually participate in the research post-screening.

Note 2: When studies involve the use of human data or specimens, the number shoulddescribe the total number of individuals from whom those data or specimens originated.
Note 3: Over-enrollment (exceeding the numbe rs described to the IRB) is a protocolviolation.  If you need to include more subjects, a modi ﬁcation must  be submi tted to andapproved by the IRB prior to doing so.
This pilot study will provide estimates of eﬀect size, and standard deviations for sample sizecalculations for a larger RCT.
Using data gathered from births on the Family Maternal Child He alth service in 2015, weestimate approximately 78 newborns with in-utero methadone  or heroin expos ure per year.To ﬁnd a diﬀerence of 3 days in length of hospital stay, 272 i nfants would need to berecruited, which we predict would take over 3 ye ars. We have found ho wever that our birthrate is lower than expected and the infant withdrawal rate is also lower than expected. Forthis reason, an initial pilot study will be conduc ted with infants born over 2 ye ars fromapproval of the IRB (approximately September 2016-  September 2018, 100 inf ants). Thisinitial pilot study will enable data to be gathered regarding feasibility and troubleshooting ofthe study protocol in preparation for a larger study.
3.Study Timelines
3.4.Describe:
•The duration of an individual subject’s participation in the research
•The duration anticipated to enroll all subjects
•The expected duration for the investigators to compl ete the study (compl ete anal ysis)
Parents or guardians of eligible infants will be approached for enrollment and random izationwithin 12 hours of birth. Infants will participate until hospital discharge. Based on our  projectednumbers of eligible infants over 1 year, enrollment time for a pilot study w ould be approximately1 year, with an additional 6 months for data analysis.
Study Endpoints
3.5.Describe the primary and secondary study endpoi nts.
3.6.Describe any primary or secondary safety endpoi nts.
3.7.Describe any exploratory endpoints.
The primary research endpoint is length of hospital stay. Seconda ry research endpoi nts includelength of treatment, need for a second treatment agent, need for assisted nut ritional suppor t(including increased kcal requirement, procedures including NG t ube placement), need foradditional consults outside the range of traditional complications of NAS, parent satisfaction,breastfeeding initiation, breastfeeding status at discharge.
There are no safety endpoints because the morphine protocol is already in use for buprenorphineexposed babies at UNMH and has been proven for safety.

which opiate (methadone or morphine) will be used to treat infants enrolled in the study a t thetime of initiation of therapy.
9.3.Describe other resources available to conduct the research: For exampl e, asappropriate:
•Justify the feasibility of recruiting the required numbe r of suitable subjects within theagreed recruitment period. For example, how  many potential subjects do y ou hav eaccess to? What percentage of those potential subjects do y ou ne ed to recruit?
As described above in the power calculation, there are approximately 78 ne wborns ayear on our service with in-utero methadone  or heroin expos ure. Assuming not  all ofthese infants would be participants, we estimate that it would be possible to recruit 60infants for a pilot study within a year. After conduc ting the study f or a year, ourwithdrawal and birth rates were lower than expected, therefore we are requesting amodiﬁcation to extend the study to 2 years total with approximately 100 r ecruitedinfants.
•Describe the time that will be devoted to conduc ting and c ompl eting the research.
Recruitment will be on a rolling basis over a year as infants are born. We estimate anadditional 6 months for data analysis. During the study pe riod, time would be spentconducting consent conversations and collecting da ta from the electronic medicalrecord. Once the study is complete, time will be spent analyzing the data for trends.
•Describe the facilities available to conduct the research.
The primary facility is UNM Hospital.
•Describe the availability of medical or psychological resources that subjects mightneed as a result of an anticipated consequences of the human r esearch.

PROT OCOL  TITLE:
If women choose to enroll in the study, and their infants require treatment for NAS, their infantswill be randomized and assigned a study num ber for treatment using the methadone  or morphineprotocols at the time treatment is required (Attachment: NICU NAS pharmacy protocol) We arechoosing to consent more parents or guardians of infants than will ultimately participate fully inthe study because we know that about 75% of infants expos ed to opi ates other thanbuprenorphine will require medications for withdrawal, and it is possible that the time forinitiation of medication may be after hours. Therefore the consent process occurs at anon-stressful time for parents/ guardians, and the primary medical team for the infant can qui cklyinitiate therapy when needed.
All infants will be monitored for signs of withdrawal using the standard UNM  NAS scoringprotocol (Attachment: NICU NAS pharmacy protocol). Standard of care at UNM is to treatinfants exposed to methadone or heroin in-utero with methadone  if they require pharmacologictherapy for NAS, therefore treatment will not be withheld if they choos e not to enroll in thestudy. Standard of care is also to obtain a urine drug screen on a ll infants with reported expos ureto opiates in pregnancy. Enrolled patients will thus unde rgo routine urine drug screening. Theonly diﬀerence from standard care with regards to the study pr otocol is the treatment of half ofthe methadone or heroin exposed infants with morphine. The morphine protocol is proven forsafety and eﬃcacy currently in buprenorphine expos ed infants at the University of New Mexico,and for all opiate exposed infants in many other institutions.
Randomization will occur by a stratiﬁed method i n groups  of six to ten participants to attempt tocontrol for prenatal exposure (heroin or methadone ).
Infants randomized to receive methadone will receive treatment using our  standard MethadoneWithdrawal Protocol (Attachment: NICU NAS pharmacy protocol).
Infants randomized to receive morphine will receive the drug usi ng the standard MorphineWithdrawal Protocol (Attachment: NICU NAS pharmacy protocol).
If at any time in the study , infants require transfer to higher level of care in the Neonatal 
Intensive Care Unit (excluding an initial 24 hour transition period after birth), they will become
excluded from the study and data collection on these infants will stop. These infants will 
continue to receive the standard of care therapy as determined by the Neonatal ICU team. If
infants require transfer of care to the Intermediate Care Nursery-3 from Mother Baby Unit or
Carrie Tingley Inpatient Unit, they will continue to be enrolled in the study and data collection 
will continue until hospital dischar ge. In our current experience, the number of infants needing 
transfer is minimal, and in most cases involves transfer from a floor unit to the ICN-3. It is very
rare to require transfer to the NICU for neonatal abstinence syndrome after treatment has been
initiated.  Infants requiring initial NICU admission for less than 24 hours for a non-withdrawal
related reason (i.e. cardio/respiratory transition related to birth, hypoglycemia related to maternal
diabetes, etc) will be included in the study if they are able to transition to the ICN-3 or Newborn
Nursery within 24 hours after birth.
Physicians and nurses cannot feasibly be blinded to the study dr ug due  to diﬀerences in drugadministration times for methadone vs morphine as described in the protocols above.

13.Data Analysis
1.3.Describe the data analysis plan, including any  statistical procedures.
1.4.Provide a power analysis
Data will be analyzed using STATA 13.0.  Continuous v ariables will summarized as means ormedians.  Diﬀerences in maternal and neonatal characteristics between methadone  and m orphinegroups will be compared using bivariate analyses.  Length of stay will be summarized as meanand median, and the length of stay will be compared between the morphine and m ethadone  groupusing parametric and non-parametric methods .  Multivariable regression analyses will be used toestimate the eﬀect of morphine versus methadone  on length of stay, controlling for pretreatmentdiﬀerences in maternal and neonatal characteristics between treatment group.
Based on obtained sample size, and diﬀerence in length of stay between groups , the standarddeviation of the diﬀerence, and type I error set at 0.05, we  will determine the power of thediﬀerence estimate.  These statistics will be used for sample size determination for planning offuture studies.

This section is required when research involves more than M inimal Risk to subjects. Describe:
2.1.The entity (e.g., DMC, DSMB) or individuals (e.g., me dical monitor) who will performdata and safety monitoring.  Describe whether they are independent of or aﬃliated withthe sponsor or investigator.  If a DMC or DSMB is planne d, de scribe the composi tion ofthe committee or board. Generally, a DSMB or DMC should be compose d of experts inall scientiﬁc disciplines needed to analyze and i nterpret the data (e.g., epidemiologists,biostatisticians, subject matter experts).
2.2.The safety information that will be collected and monitor ed.
2.3.The frequency or periodicity of review of data, such as speciﬁed poi nts in time or after aspeciﬁc number of participants have been enrolled.

PROT OCOL  TITLE:
A Data and Safety Monitoring Plan will be developed and wi ll be led by Dr . Andrew Hsi at theUniversity of New Mexico. Dr. Hsi is an expert in the ﬁeld of neonatal abstinence syndrome. Dr.Hsi will monitor the study approximately every 3 m onths.  The report on the Data and SafetyMonitoring Plan at Continuing Review will include enrollment and dr opout  rates, protocoldeviations, review of subject symptoms, and pr eliminary analysis of the primary out come(newborn length of stay.)
3.Withdrawal of Subjects
3.1.Describe any anticipated circumstances unde r which subjects may be withdrawn fromthe research without their consent.
Infants will be withdrawn if they develop a serious medical comorbidity (egintubation/ventilation, serious allergic reaction) or require transfer to the neonatalintensive care unit.
3.2.Describe any procedures for orderly termination/safe withdrawal (e.g., tapering ofmeds, physical exams, laboratory or other tests, etc.).
This is not applicable to our study. If an infant is withdrawn from the study v oluntarilyor for the above reasons, they will continue to receive the standard of care therapy butdata collection will stop.
3.3.Describe any procedures for partial withdrawal (e.g., from procedures but allowingcontinued data collection by record review, phone  contact, etc.).
This is not applicable to our study. If an infant is withdrawn from the study v oluntarily or forthe above reasons, they will continue to receive the standard of care therapy but datacollection will stop.
3.4.Describe the disposition of existing data/specimens when a s ubject withdraws.Describe any restrictions on a subject’s ability to withdraw any already gathered dat aor specimens (e.g., unable to retrieve because it has been stripped of identiﬁers and nocode exists to allow re-linking).  (Note: FDA requires that existing dat a be maintainedfor studies subject to FDA oversight.)
If an infant is withdrawn from the study, all of the data related to that individual will bediscarded. Data collection will occur upon hospi tal discharge of the infant, thereforethere is not a risk of not being able to retrieve data.
3.5.Describe withdrawal procedures and any limitations in the consent document.

5.Risks to Subjects
5.1.List the reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, haz ards, or inconveniences to thesubjects related the subjects’ participation in the research.  De scribe the probability,magnitude, duration, and reversibility of the risks. Consider physical, psychological,social, legal, and economic risks.  Note that almost all research includes conﬁde ntialityrisks.
5.2.If applicable, indicate which procedures may have risks to the subjects that arecurrently unforeseeable.
5.3.If applicable, indicate which procedures may have risks to an e mbryo or fetus shouldthe subject be or become pregnant.  If pregnanc y testing or bi rth control provisions arerequired, describe these.
5.4.If applicable, describe risks to others who ar e not subjects.
5.5.Describe the steps being taken to minimize the probability or magnitude of risks.
Note: All risks described here should also be described in the consent document.
There are risks of stress and inconvenience for parents who pa rticipate in the research study a sthey will be asked to complete a patient satisfaction survey at the end of  their child’shospitalization. There are also risks of possible loss of privacy and conﬁdentiality. For thisreason, a Certiﬁcate of Conﬁdentiality will be obtained from NIDA, and all data will be keptconﬁdential and deidentiﬁed.
The study will use existing protocols for the treatment of neonatal abstinence syndrome witheither methadone or morphine. The experimental component of the study i s the use of themorphine protocol for a diﬀerent exposure group ( in-utero methadone  or heroin).   For thisreason, there are minimal foreseeable medical risks of treatment. Please see the consentdocument for details on minimizing risks to subjects.

PROT OCOL  TITLE:
6.1.Describe the potential beneﬁts that individual subjects may experience from taking partin the research. Include as may be useful for the IRB’s consideration, the probability,magnitude, and duration of the potential beneﬁts.
6.2.Indicate if there is no direct beneﬁt. Do not include beneﬁts to society or others in thissection.
Note: All potential beneﬁts described here should also be described in the consent document.
Possible beneﬁts to subjects include decreased length of stay and improved parentalsatisfaction. Given the decreased length of stay obse rved for infants currently treated withmorphine rather than methadone (in-utero expos ure to buprenorphine), we expect a decreasedlength of stay in the study population (in-utero expos ure to methadone  or heroin).
7.Recruitment Methods
7.1.Describe when, where, and how potential subjects will be recruited.
7.2.Describe the methods that will be used to identify potential subjects (e.g., chart review,referral, etc.).

Attach draft copies of the documents or audi oor video recordings with the application. Onc e the draft has been appr oved, the ﬁnalcopy of the printed material, audio or video recording must  be submi tted for review andapproval prior to implementation.  Please see Worksheet HRP-315 f or information onadvertisement standards.
Candidates will be identiﬁed and recruited based on e ligibility criteria. Prior to delivery, pos siblecandidates will be identiﬁed by review of the Milagro prenatal substance abuse clinic census.After identiﬁcation by the primary medical team by chart review, women will be approachedby the research team upon admission to Labor and De livery, or up to 12 hour s after delivery atUNM Hospital in the Labor and Delivery, Mother-Baby, Newborn Nur sery, or IntermediateCare Nursery-3 Units. When possible, families will be approached to discuss the study wi thinstandard business hours. The recruitment script detailed in the study pr otocol will be used todescribe the study to patients. (Attachments: Recruitment script, Waiver of consent forscreening/recruitment purposes)
8.Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects
8.1.Describe the steps that will be taken to protect subjects’ privacy interests. “Privacy”refers to persons and their interest in controlling the access that others have tothemselves.  For example, based on their privacy interests, people may want to control:
•The time and place/setting where they are examined or provide information
•The nature of the information they provide
•The nature of the experiences they are exposed to

Version 5 Date: 4/9/18
PROT OCOL  TITLE:
•Who may observe or have access to information about  them
For example, individuals may not want to be appr oached for participation, pr ovideresponses to a research interview, or undergo a r esearch procedure in a locationwhere they may be seen or overheard.\
1.2.Describe the steps that will be taken to protect subjects’ privacy including pri vacyprotections during recruitment, consent, and dat a collection. Issues related to dat a areaddressed in the Data Management/Conﬁdentiality Section.
Procedures for protecting against or minimizing the likelihood of  loss of privacy includeapproaching parents or guardians privately and usi ng a private room to answer test questions.The treatment plan for the baby will be kept conﬁdential, and di scussion regarding treatmentprotocols would occur according to routine protocols. Conversations can occur in a private roomin Labor and Delivery, the Mother Baby Unit or Carrie Tingley Hospi tal. There are no pr ivaterooms in ICN-3, so eﬀorts will be made to create a conﬁdential, quiet space in this clinicalenvironment (eg a quiet corner in the unit, away from other parents visiting their newborns, or ina separate conference room away from the unit.) Information that is collected will be labeledwith a study number and kept in a secure locked ﬁle. Information that will be entered in to adatabase will only contain the study number. Subject’s research data and study r ecords will bemaintained until the youngest subject turns 22 ye ars old..
2.Economic Burden to Subjects
8.2.Describe any costs that subjects may be respons ible for because of participation in theresearch.  Clearly stipulate what procedures are standar d of care and w hat proceduresare research-related in the table below.

8.5.Ensure that the cost section of the consent form reﬂects the cost that are covered by thesponsor and the costs for which the subjects (or 3rd part y payers) are respons ible.
There will be no additional cost to the parents or guardians of test participants other than theroutine hospitalization costs for standard of care. All charges related to hospi talization includingurine drug screens and therapy with either methadone  or morphine are considered to be standardof care and will therefore be billed to the patient’s insurance company (3rdparty payer).
23.Compensation
8.6.Describe any plans for compensation or reimbursement for subjects (amount s, methods(e.g., cash card), and payment schedule).  De scribe why the proposed amount  isreasonable and appropriate for the subjects’ time and i nconvenience.  Credit forpayment should be prorated and not be contingent upon t he participant compl eting theentire study.  Any amount paid as bonus for compl etion of  the entire study should not  beso great that it could unduly induce subjects to remain in the study when they otherwise

Study Title : PROVEN: PRagmatic trial Of Vi deo Education in Nursing homes 
 Objective : To conduct a pragmatic cluster randomized control trial (RCT)  of an Advance Care 
Planning (ACP) video support inte rvention for nursing home (NH)  patients ≥ 65 cared for in 360 
NHs (intervention, n=119; control , n=241) within two NH health care systems; Genesis 
HealthCare and PruittHealth.  Design and Outcomes : Aim 1 of this study is to implement all aspects of a pragmati c cluster 
RCT trial of an ACP vi deo support interven tion in two NH health  care systems, including: 1. 
Recruitment of a sufficient numb er of NHs to achieve the sample  size of patients needed to 
demonstrate a clinica lly meaningful difference in the primary o utcome; 2. Facility staff 
training and implementation of t he intervention; and 3. Outcome  assessment using EMR 
records, the Minimum Data Set (MDS), and Medicare Claims.   
In this stratified cluster RCT, the unit of random assignment i s the facility but the unit of 
analysis is the patient, clustered within the facility. The int ervention will be implemented facility-
wide, thus all patients cared for in the NHs during the 24-mont himplementation period are subjects 
in this study (N ~ 152,160). However, outcomes will be analyzed in targeted sub-populations with 
advanced comorbid conditions for whom the opportunity and need to improve ACP and goal-
directed care are greatest. The se subgroups include very disabl ed older patients with advanced 
dementia and advanced congestive heart failure (CHF) or chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) (i.e., cardiopulmonary disease).  
Outcomes to be compared between patients in the intervention an d control NHs include: 
advance directives orders (Do Not Resuscitate (DNR), Do Not Hos pitalize (DNH), Do Not 
Intubate (DNI), and no tube-feedin g), hospital transfers, use o f other burdensome interventions 
(new feeding tube insertions, pa renteral therapy, intubation, I CU care), hospice use, and Medicare 
ACP billing codes. The effectiveness of the intervention to imp rove these outcomes among those 
targeted sub-populations with advanced illness will be assessed  among long-stay (≥ 90 days) NH 
residents > 65 (Aim 2) and new admissions to post-acute care (s hort-stay < 90 days) (Aim 3). 
Finally, we will evaluate the effects of the intervention by ex amining the aforementioned outcomes 
among long-stay NH patients and new admissions who do NOT have either of the pre-specified 
advanced illnesses (Aim 4). 
The primary outcome for this pr agmatic trial is hospital transf ers (quantified as number of 
hospital transfers/person-days a live based on Medicare claims d ata), which include admissions, 
emergency department visits, and observation stays over a 12-mo nth follow-up period among 
long-stay residents with advanced dementia and/or advanced CHF/ COPD. For all analyses 
involving this hospital transfer  outcome, including the primary  trial outcome, the main analyses 
will be restricted to Medicare Fee-for-Service patients because  ascertainment of hospital transfers 
is most accurate from Medicare Claims data. Exploratory analyse s will also be done on all patients, 
not just FFS, using the MDS as well as Medicare claims as the d ata sources.  Secondary outcomes 
include advance directive orders, other burdensome treatments, and hospice use.  An exploratory 
aim will be, among decedents, to compare the proportion of pati ents in the intervention and control 
facilities who had any of the f ollowing interventions in the la st month of life: hospital transfer or 
other burdensome interventions  (feeding tube insertion, parente ral therapy, intubation, ICU care).  
PROVEN Protocol - Version 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page vii Separate analyses will be done among decedents from the short a nd long-stay cohorts with 
advanced dementia, CHF or COPD, as well as those without advanc ed disease. 
 
Interventions and Duration:  The intervention consists of a  suite of five videos designed t o 
address common ACP decisions con fronting NH patients and their families:  
 
1. Goals of Care for Any Patient  
2. Goals of Care for Patients with Advanced Dementia  
3. Decisions about Hospitalization  
4. Decisions about Hospice  
5. General Information about Advance Care Planning for Healthy Adults  
 
NHs randomized to the control arm of the study will use the usu al ACP procedures already 
practiced in their facilities. T he ACP Video Program will be im plemented for 24 months in the 
intervention facilities. Indivi dual patients in both arms who a re in the NHs during the 24-month 
implementation period are eligible, and their outcomes will be assessed for up to 12 months in 
the long-stay cohort and 100 days  in the short-stay cohort. 
 
Sample Size and Population : The ACP video interve ntion will be implemented facility-wide in  
the NHs randomized to the inter vention arm. Thus, ALL patients who are cared for during the 
24-month implementation phase are  potential participants in the  trial and comprise the study 
population (N ~ 152,160).  However, the analyses described in Aims 2 and 3 will focus on target 
populations with advanced comorbi d conditions that are cared fo r in the NHs during the 24-
month implementation period. For Aim 2, the target sample is lo ng-stay patients with advanced 
dementia or CHF/COPD ( N~ 14,760). As the primary study trial  outcome is hospital transfe rs in 
the long-stay patients, sample size estimates and power calcula tions are based on this target 
group. For Aim 3, the target sample is short-stay patients with advanc ed dementia or 
CHF/COPD . For Aim 4, the target sample is long-stay and short-sta y NH patients who do NOT 
have either of the pre-sp ecified advanced illnesses . 
In this stratified cluster RCT, the unit of random assignment i s the facility. F acilities will be 
randomized in the following strata in the following order: 1. H ealth care system (Genesis 
HealthCare and PruittHealth), and 2. Hospitalization rates in t he 12 months prior to recruitment in 
target sub-populations (grouped as terciles). Outcomes analyses  will not differ by strata.

intervention in two NH health care systems, including: 1. Recru itment of a sufficient number of 
NHs to achieve the sample size of patients needed to demonstrat e a clinically meaningful 
difference in the primary outcom e; 2. Facility staff training a nd implementation of the 
intervention; and 3. Outcome assessment using EMR records, the Minimum Data Set (MDS), 
and Medicare Claims.  
 
Aim 2:  To evaluate the effectiveness of  the ACP intervention by compa ring the following 
outcomes over 12 months among long-stay NH residents  > 65 with advanced comorbid conditions 
(advanced dementia and/or advanced congestive heart failure (CH F) or chronic obstructive lung 
disease (COPD)) in the intervent ion vs. control NHs: 1. Advance  directives to withhold specific 
treatments (DNH, DNR, DNI, and no tube-feeding), 2. Hospital tr ansfers (# hospital 
transfers/person-days alive), 3. Other burdensome treatments (n ew feeding tube insertions, 
parenteral therapy, intubation, ICU care), 4. Hospice use, and 5. Medicare ACP billing codes. 
H2a: A higher proportion of long-stay residents in  the intervention (vs. control) NHs will have 
advance directive orders to withhold specific treatments over 12 months. 
H2b:  Over 12 months, hospital transf ers (primary study outcome) and other burdensome 
interventions will be lower among long-stay reside nts in the intervention (vs. control) NHs. 
H2c:  A higher proportion of long-stay residents in the intervention (vs. control) NHs will be 
enrolled in hospice. 
 
Aim 3:  To evaluate the effectiveness of  the ACP intervention by compa ring the following 
outcomes in the intervention vs. control NHs among new admissio ns to post-acute care  > 65 with 
advanced comorbid conditions (as defined in Aim 2): 1. Advance directives to withhold specific 
treatments (DNH, DNR, DNI, no tube-feeding), 2. Hospital transf ers within 100 da ys of the post-
acute care admission (# hospital transfers/per-days alive), 3. Hospice enrollment within 100 days 
of the post-acute care admissi on, and 4. Medicar e ACP billing c odes within 100 days of the post-
acute care admission.  
H3a: A higher proportion of post-ac ute care patients in the inter vention (vs. control) NHs will 
have advance directive orders to withhold sp ecific treatments during their admission.  
H3b: Hospital transfer rates will be lower among post-acute care patients in the intervention (vs. 
control) NHs. H3c: A higher proportion of post-acute care in the intervention (vs. contro l) NHs will be enrolled 
in hospice. 
 
Aim 4:  To evaluate the effects of the ACP intervention by comparing o utcomes (advance directive 
orders, hospital transfers, hos pice use, and Medicare ACP billi ng codes) in the intervention vs. 
control NHs among long-stay residents and newly admitted post-a cute care pati ents who do NOT 
have designated advanced illne ss (i.e., dementia, CHF, or COPD) .  
H4a: A higher proportion of NH patients with out advanced dementia, COPD, or CHF in the 
intervention (vs. control) NHs will acquire advan ce directives to withhol d specific treatments.  
H4b: Hospital transfers will be lower among NH patients without advanced dementia, COPD, or 
CHF in the intervention (vs. control) arms.  
H4c: A higher proportion of NH patients with out advanced dementia, COPD, or CHF in the 
intervention (vs. control) NHs will be enrolled in hospice.

Exploratory Aim: Among decedents, to compare the proportion of patients in the i ntervention 
and control facilities who had any of the following interventio ns in the last month of life: hospital 
transfer or other burdensome int erventions (feeding tube insert ion, parenteral therapy, intubation, 
ICU care).   Separate analyses will be done a mong decedents from the short a nd long-stay cohorts 
with advanced dementia, CHF or C OPD, as well as those without a dvanced disease.   
 
Cohort and outcomes specifications: 
 
A. Hospital tr ansfer outcome 
1. For all analyses involving this outcome, including the primary trial outcome, the main 
analyses will be restricted to Medicare Fee-for-Service patient s because ascertainment of 
hospital transfers is most accurate from Medicare Claims data. Exploratory analyses will 
also be done on all patients, not  just FFS, using the MDS as we ll as Medicare claims as the 
data sources. 
2. For the primary outcome and all relevant secondary outcomes, ‘h ospitalizations’ was 
modified to ‘hospital transfers’  based on Medicare claims data,  which include admissions, 
emergency department visits, and observation stays. This change  was made so as to capture 
the main “decision” to send a  patient from the nursing home to the hospital. 
 B. Advance directive outcome 
1. For all aims, advance directives analyses will be limited to Ge nesis facilities in which 
>75% of patients have any advance directive because the remaini ng Genesis and Pruitt 
facilities do not have reliabl e sources for these data.  
2. The proportion of residents in a facility whose last observed a dvance directive status during 
their observation period was DNR, DNH, DNI or feeding restricti ons 
i. The proportion of short-stay resid ents in a facility whose last  observed 
advance directive status during their 100-day observation perio d was DNR, 
DNH, DNI or feeding restrictions 
ii. The proportion of long-stay target residents in a facility whos e last observed 
advance directive status duri ng their 12-month observation peri od was 
DNR, DNH, DNI or feed ing restrictions 
iii. The proportion of long-stay non-target residents in a facility whose last 
observed advance directive stat us during their 12-month observa tion period 
was DNR, DNH, DNI or feeding restrictions 
3. Among participants who are full code when they become part of t he study (on admission 
to a NH), the average time to switching from full code to DNR, DNH, DNI or feeding 
restrictions during a 12- month observation period. 
 C. Burdensome interventions 
1. For Aim 2.3, burdensom e interventions will include: new feeding  tube insertions (i.e., did 
not have a feeding tube at star t of observation period), parent eral therapy (for  hydration or 
medication delivery), intubation, or ICU care). The outcome wil l be analyzed as the 
proportion of long-stay target c ohort residents that had any bu rdensome intervention during 
the 12-month observation period.  
 
PROVEN Protocol - Version 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page 7 D. Hospice:  
1. In the long-stay target cohort, t he proportion of residents wit h any Medicare hospice claim 
in the 12-month observation period. 
2. In the non-target long-stay cohort,  the proportion of residents  with any Medicare hospice 
claim in the 12-mont h observation period. 
3. In the short-stay cohort without advanced comorbid conditions, the proportion of residents 
with any Medicare hospice claim in the 100-day observation peri od. 
4. In the short-stay cohort with advanced comorbid conditions, the  proportion of residents 
with any Medicare hospice claim in the 100-day observation peri od. For both long-stay 
and short-stay cohorts, residents on hospice at the start of th e observation period will be 
excluded.  
 E. Medicare Advance Care Planning Billing  
1. In long-stay target cohort, the proportion of residents with an y Medicare ACP billing code 
in the 12-month observation period. 
2. In non-target long-stay cohort, t he proportion of residents wit h any Medicare ACP billing 
code in the 12-month o bservation period. 
3. In short-stay cohort (with and w ithout advanced comorbid condit ions), the proportion of 
patients with any Medicare ACP  billing code in the 100-day obse rvation period. 
 
 2.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
2.1. Epidemiology : Nursing homes (NHs) care for approximately 3 million individua ls annually, 
including 1.5 million frail older persons with advanced chronic  disease requiring long-term care, 
and a growing proportion of seriously ill patients admitted for  post-acute care. 1, 2 Approximately 
11% of Americans over 85 years reside in NHs. In the past 3 dec ades, NHs have evolved into 
complex health care systems serving an increasingly sick and he terogeneous population. While 
NHs serve a growing number of patients recuperating from acute illnesses, they also are a common 
site of care for patients near ing the end-of-life. In 2009, 45%  of U.S. Medicare beneficiaries who 
died were in a NH during the last 90 days of life, and 28% died  in that setting. 3 Taken together, 
NHs are often charged with guiding patients with complex medica l problems and advanced illness 
through challenging decisions about t he direction of their trea tment. 
 
2.2. Need to improve advance care planning (ACP) in NHs : Advance care planning (ACP) is a 
process  of communication between providers and patients/families to id entify anticipated medical 
decisions and clarify goal-directed treatment preferences. Idea lly, ACP leads to completion of 
advance directives that come into effect if/when a patient becomes  incapacitated. Advance 
directives include living wills, appointment of a health care p roxy, and formal medical orders to 
withhold specific treatments, suc h as resuscitation. In observa tional studies, ACP is the strongest 
and most consistent modifiable factor associated with better pa lliative care outcomes in the NH 
setting.4-9 The lack of advance directives has been associated with greate r use of feeding tubes, 7, 
10, 11 more terminal hospitalizations, 5, 12-14 higher health care costs,9  worse family satisfaction and 
mental health outcomes, 6, 10, 15, 16 and lower hospice use. 10, 17    
The Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA) of 1991 mandated that  NHs ascertain and 
document patients’ advance directives.18 Unfortunately, advance di rective completion remains 
inadequate and does not  always reflect the patient’s goals of c are. 4, 6, 8, 18-24 The proportion of NH 
PROVEN Protocol - Version 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page 8 patients with DNR orders incr eased from 31% in 1990 to 52%,19 but has remained relatively 
unchanged thereafter.25 Other, perhaps more consequential directives for NH patients, were not 
influenced by the PSDA and continue to be low. In 2007, only 4%  of U.S. NH patients had DNH 
orders and 11% had orders  to withhold tube-feeding. 25 Not surprisingly, markers of the quality of 
end-of-life care, such as terminal hospitalizations, have also not improved.25 Other serious 
concerns related to advance dire ctives in the NH persist, most notably marked racial and regional 
disparities,8, 26-29 and very low completion rates in post-acute care, where only 3 2% and 2% of 
patients have DNR and DNH  orders, respectively. 29 
There have been some, albeit lim ited, efforts to design and eva luate approaches other than 
legislation to improve advance directives in NHs.30 An RCT from the late 1990s of an advance 
directive program in 6 Ontario facilities resulted in more adva nce directive documentation, fewer 
hospitalizations, and lower expenditures, w ith no change in sur vival. 31 A more recent initiative is 
the Physician Order for Life-Sus taining Treatment (POLST) progr am, which translates treatment 
preferences into medical orders that are documented on a form d esigned to be portable across care 
settings. POLST does not intervene on the process of counseling  patients about how to make 
preference-based decis ions. While many states have adopted POLS T programs in NHs, 32 its 
efficacy and effectiveness are unde r-studied. A retrospective c ohort study from 90 NHs found that 
POLST resulted in care consiste nt directives and greater advanc e directive documentation.33, 34  
There is growing recognition that improving goal-directed care in NHs will require greater 
focus on improving the process  of ACP (i.e., helping to prepare patients for medical decision -
making), rather than just static  advance direc tive completion. 18, 35-37 In one of the few rigorous 
RCTs designed to improve this pro cess, social workers were trai ned how to have structured ACP 
discussions with all newly admitted NH patients.38 This approach reduced unwanted care and 
increased advance directive documentation, but was never adopte d into practice perhaps because 
such complex interventions are r esource intensiv e, require on-g oing staff training, and are difficult 
to replicate across facilities.  
The proposed pragmatic RCT of the video decision support tools addresses many of the 
lessons learned, research gaps,  and on-going concerns about ACP  in NHs by rigorously evaluating 
the implementation of a standard ized, practical intervention th at targets the ACP process in two 
large NH systems.  
 
2.3. Hospitalizations of NH patients are commo n, burdensome, costly, and often avoidable:  An 
estimated 15% of NH patients are hospitalized in the last week of life. 25 Between one-third and 
one-fifth of patients in sub-acu te skilled nursing facilities ( SNFs) are re-hospitalized within 30 
days.39 Prior work reports that 23-60% of hospitalizations of NH patie nts are avoidable, either 
because hospital-level care is unnecessary or unwanted, and, if  averted, could potentially save the 
U.S. health care system b illions of dollars annually. 40-44  
This opportunity and need to re duce avoidable hospitalizations are greatest among patients 
with advanced chronic illnesses, for whom the burdens of hospit alization often outweigh the 
benefits. The decision to hosp italize patients should be guided  by the primary goal of care (i.e., 
prolongation of life vs. comfort ). The goal of care for many NH  patients with advanced disease is 
comfort. With rare exceptions ( e.g., hip fracture), hospitaliza tion seldom promotes a goal of 
comfort. Hospitalization can be traumatic, 45, 46 and often involves burdensome and costly 
treatments that may be of limited clinical benefit. 45-48 For example, 68% of feeding tubes are 
placed in NH residents with advanced dementia during a hospital ization. 47 Care transitions also 
place NH residents at risk of medical errors and adverse drug e vents. 49, 50 For those NH patients 
PROVEN Protocol - Version 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page 9 whose goal of care remains life prolongation, many of the most common illnesses precipitating 
hospitalization (i.e., infections), can be usually treated with  the same efficacy in the NH. 51-54  
  Better ACP is a key strategy to reduce avoidable hospitalizatio ns. 44 A DNH order is the 
strongest factor associated with lower hospitalization rates. 5, 12, 55, 56 NHs with higher rates of DNR 
orders, a marker of facility cul ture with better ACP, have lowe r hospitalization rates among dying 
patients.25 A before and after study of an ACP-focused intervention in SNF s that targete d patients 
with > 3 hospitalizations in the prior 6 months reduced re-hosp italization rates by 20%.57 The 
Interventions to Reduce Acute Care Transfers (INTERACT) program , of which ACP is a key 
component, has also been shown t o reduce NH hospitalizations. 58 
 2.4. Video decision support tools im prove ACP for multiple conditions:  The traditional approach 
to ACP primarily relies on ad hoc verbal descriptions of hypoth etical clinical states and 
interventions. This approach is limited because complex scenari os are difficult to envision, 
provider information is inconsis tent, and verbal explanations a re hampered by literacy and 
language barriers. Decision support tools have been used to ove rcome some of these barriers59-65 
and are meant to supplement, not replace, provider counseling b y providing standardized 
information about options and a f ramework for weighing options with preferences.  
 More than 700 decision support tool s exist, including 50 that u tilize videos. 63-65 V i d e o  
addresses some of the limitations of traditional verbal ACP by providing realistic visual images of 
complex medical scenarios. A growing body of work, including se veral RCTs, supports the 
effectiveness and feasibility of video decision support tools f or ACP for various advanced illnesses 
(e.g., dementia, cancer, heart failure) and among patients in d ifferent settings (out-patient, hospital, 
short-term rehabilitation) (see Section 3.C.i.c.  Preliminary Studies).  66-75 These studies consistently 
find that subjects who view the v ideo, when compared to those w ho listen to verbal information, 
have greater knowledge about their condition and treatment choi ces and are more likely to choose 
less aggressive interventions as their preferred care. Findings  also show that the videos reduce the 
racial and health liter acy disparities that  typically character ize traditional verbal counseling. 69, 76   
 The promise of video for ACP is reflected by the widespread at tention this work has received 
by the scientific community, 77-79 media, 80, 81 the U.S. Congress, and early adoption by major 
health care systems. Kaiser Permanente, Group Health Cooperativ e, and the Palo Alto Foundation 
are currently using the ACP vi deos in their out-patient and hos pital practices. The  state of Hawaii 
is using these tools across health care settings, including NHs  (see Section 3.C.i.d.  Preliminary 
Studies) . However, none of these efforts involve formal research design s or evaluation. Thus, the 
proposed pragmatic trial is a logi cal next step towards underst anding the real world application of 
a video ACP support tool for NH patients.  
 
2.5. Electronic health records and secondary da ta sources are powerful tools for NH heath 
systems research: Since 1998, when The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services r equired full 
electronic submission of Minimum Data Set (MDS) data, all licen sed U.S. NHs have had 
rudimentary EMRs.82, 83 T h e  M D S  i s  a  c o m p r e h e n s i v e ,  s t a n d a r d i z e d  r e s i d e n t  a s s e s s m e n t  
instrument federally mandated for use in all licensed U.S. NHs.  T h e la test  it era tio n ,  th e MD S  
Version 3.0, was introduced in 2010. MDS assessments are comple ted on all NH patients upon 
admission, quarterly, annually, and whenever they have a signif icant status change. The uniformly 
collected MDS data have been use d for care planning, fiscal, po licy, and research purposes. Prior 
work has shown that MDS data are valid and reliable for these p urposes as collected in the real 
world, not merely during field testing.84-90 
PROVEN Protocol - Version 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page 10 Over the past 17 years, analyses of the MDS on its own and link ed with other secondary 
data sources, most notably the Medicare and Medicaid claims, ha ve made key contributions to our 
understanding of clinical outcome s and health care utilization in the NH setting. These merged 
datasets have been used extensively to address research questio ns in the areas of ACP and end-of-
life care, including: tube-feeding in advanced dementia, 7, 11, 91, 92 hospitalization, 5, 8, 39, 93 hospice 
use, 94-96 health care expenditures, 56 regional disparities, 11, 92 and prognostication.11, 97 Much of 
this work has emanated from Brown University in efforts led by Dr. Mor and in collaboration with 
Dr. Mitchell (See Section 3.C.i.a.2. Preliminary Studies) .  
 The introduction of the MDS stim ulated the development of inte grated EMR systems in NHs 
capable of filing MDS assessments, billing payers, and ultimate ly pharmacy management and 
physician ordering. One of our partner NH health care systems, Genesis HealthCare, uses 
PointClickCare™, one of the most s ophisticated among these EMR systems. 98 PointClickCare™ 
integrates data from MDS assessments, physician order entry, he alth care utilizations (hospital 
transfer, hospice referral), and pharmacy prescriptions into pa tient care plans. Our second partner 
NH system, PruittHealth, uses American Health Tech, 99 which has capabilities and components 
that are very similar to PointClickCare™.  
2.6. A pragmatic trial with a clus ter randomized design is a we ll-suited approach to evaluate the 
effect of the ACP video intervention in NH health care systems: Over the past 15 years, cluster 
randomized controlled trial (RCT) designs have been increasingl y used in health services research, 
including trials of NH interventions. 52, 100-108 This work has contributed to more refined and 
standardized approaches to the un ique biostatistical, implement ation, and ethical considerations 
associated with clustered trial designs. 103, 109-113 Several advantages of cluster RCTs for testing 
interventions in NHs are notable. Given that the facility is th e unit of randomization, the 
contamination that can occur wh en randomizing individuals withi n NHs is avoided. Moreover, the 
types of interventions being tested will likely be implemented at the NH level. Fin ally, individual 
patient consent procedures are  often unnecessary  provided the s tudy is of low risk.  
While the increasing number of cluster RCTs conducted in NHs ha s established the 
feasibility of this approach, most were in a relatively small n umber of facilities and evaluated the 
effects of interventions under id eal circumstances (i.e., expla natory trials). Pragmatic trials, which 
intend to determine the effects of interventions under usual co nditions, are a next critical 
translational step in NH research. 114 A small but growing number of pragmatic trials of NH 
interventions have been conducted, all of which were outside th e U.S. 115-117 Based on the 10 
domains outlined in the Pragmatic–Explanatory Continuum Indicat or Summary Tool (PRECIS),118 
the rationale for pragmatic trials in the NH setting is very co mpelling, particularly for an ACP 
intervention. NHs must engage all patients in ACP to maintain a n expected standard of care and 
as a matter of federal legisla tion. However, NH providers inclu de a variety of practitioners caring 
for a heterogeneous population. Thus, a pragmatic trial that in volves facility-wide implementation 
of a standardized, feasible, but f lexible, ACP intervention mak es sense. Moreover, large networks 
of NHs across the U.S. are owned and operated by single corpora tions, such as Genesis HealthCare 
and PruittHealth. These NH syst ems are uniquely suited for prag matic trials as they have efficient 
and established infrastructures for staff training and new prog ram implementation. Moreover, they 
have integrated computerized c linical information systems (e.g. , PointClickCare™) providing an 
easily accessible data source for patient characterization, int ervention implementation, and 
outcomes measurement. 
 
PROVEN Protocol - Version 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page 11 2.7. Summary of background and ratio nale based on the literature: The significance of the 
proposed pragmatic cluster RCT of an ACP video intervention in two NH health care systems is 
summarized in the following points: 1. NHs have evolved into co mplex health care systems serving 
an increasingly sick patient population with advanced comorbid conditions; 2. Th ese NH patients 
often get aggressive and costly interventions that may be of li ttle clinical benefit and inconsistent 
with their preferences; 3. There is an opportunity to promote m ore preference-based, higher 
quality, and cost-effective care among NH patients with advance d disease through better ACP; 4. 
An intervention comprised of a s uite of ACP video decision supp ort tools presents a promising, 
scalable, and efficacious approach to address that opportunity that can be implemented on a 
system-wide level in a flexible manner; and, 5. NH systems offe r an ideal setting for a pragmatic 
cluster RCT. This design is enabled by system-wide infrastructu res for staff training, program 
implementation, and existing electronic data capture. Taken tog ether, this work has the potential 
to improve the quality of care provided to millions of older Am ericans in NHs and to enable future 
pragmatic trials in this increas ingly important care setting. 
 
3.    STUDY DESIGN 
This is pragmatic stratified clu ster RCT that will evaluate an ACP video support intervention 
for patients > 65  cared for i n 360 NHs (intervention, n=119; c ontrol, n=241) within two NH health 
care systems, Genesis Health Care and PruittHealth. Aim 1 of this study is to c onduct all aspects 
of this pragmatic trial. 
The intervention consists of a suite of five videos designed to  assist NH patients with ACP 
decisions (see Section 5) . The ACP video intervention will be implemented in NHs assigned to the 
intervention arm for 24 months. Data needed to assess outcomes will be derived from the NH EMR 
systems merged with MDS and Medicare files. NHs randomized to the control arm will use the 
usual ACP procedures practi ced in their facilities.   
In this stratified cluster RCT, the unit of random assignment i s the facility but the unit of 
analysis is the patient, clustered within the facility ( See Section 4.4.2) . The intervention will be 
implemented facility-wide, thus all patients cared for in the N Hs during the 24-month 
implementation period are subjects in this study (N ~ 152,160).  However, our primary outcomes 
will be measured in targeted sub-populations with advanced como rbid conditions for whom the 
opportunity and need to improve ACP  and goal-directed care are greatest. These subgroups 
(n~14,760) include very disabled o lder, long-stay patients with  advanced dementia and those with 
advanced congestive heart failur e (CHF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (i.e. 
cardiopulmonary disease). 
Outcomes to be compared between patients in the intervention an d control NHs include: 
advance directives orders (DNR, DNH, DNI, and no tube-feeding),  hospital transfers, use of other 
burdensome interventions (new feeding tube insertions, parenter al therapy, intuba tion, ICU care), 
hospice use, and Medicare ACP billing codes. The effectiveness of the intervention to improve 
these outcomes among those targ eted sub-populations with advanc ed illness will be assessed 
among long-stay (≥90 days) NH residents (Aim 2) and new admissi ons to post-acute care (short-
stay < 90 days) (Aim 3). Finally, we will evaluate the effects of the intervention by examining the 
aforementioned outcomes among long- stay NH patients and new adm issions who do NOT have 
either of the pre-specified advanced illnesses (Aim 4).The prim ary outcome for this pragmatic trial 
is hospital transfers (quantifie d as number of hospital transfe rs/person-day alive based on Medicare 
claims data), which include admissions, emergency department vi sits, and observation stays over 
a 12-month follow-up period among long-stay residents with adva nced dementia and/or advanced 
PROVEN Protocol - Version 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page 12 CHF/COPD. Secondary outcome s for these patient groups include advance direc tive orders, other 
burdensome treatments, hospice use, and Medicare ACP billing co des. 
 
4. SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS  
 
4.1.  Facility Inclusion Criteria  
 
Facility eligibility criteria include:  
Matched facility ID on Brown Unive rsity’s list of all Medicare/ Medicaid-certified nursing 
facilities in the U.S.  
Serve both short and long-stay patients  
Have >50 beds  
Have an EMR system  
Have at least 20 admissions and 20 a nnual Minimum Data Set (MDS ) assessments (regardless of 
whether patients were discharged alive)  
We anticipated that a total  of approximately 360 (297 Genesis H ealthCare / 63 PruittHealth) 
facilities would be eligible for random assignment.  
 
4.2.  Patient Inclusion Criteria: 
As the ACP video intervention will be implemented facility-wide , all patients in eligible NHs 
during the 24-month implementatio n period are eligible. There a re no exclusions based on age, 
gender, race, ethnicity, o r clinical features . 
Although the  ACP intervention will be implemented facility-wide, its effect iveness will be 
examined among targeted NH sub-populations for Aims 2, 3, and 4 . Target populations for these 
Aims include patients > 65 in the NHs during the 24-month imple mentation period who meet the 
following eligibility definitions based on MDS assessments . For all three aims, residents will be 
eligible for the target sub-popul ations if they meet these crit eria either at the start (prevalent cases) 
or during (incident cases) the 24-month implementation phase. I ncident cases include new 
admissions and long-stay residents who “convert” over the imple mentation phase by meeting 
eligibility criteria  based upon changes in t heir repeated MDS a ssessments.   
 
Aim 2:  Patients > 65 who are in nursing home ≥90 days (long-stay) who  have EITHER of the 
following two conditions: 
1. Advanced Dementia : must have all thr ee criteria: a, b, and c  
a. Alzheimer’s disease or other dementia 
b. Advanced cognitive impairment*  
c. Extensive or total assistance n eeded for eating and transferrin g 
*Advanced cognitive impairment is defined as a score of 3 or 4 on the Cognitive Function Scale 
based on variables from the MDS Version 3.0 119, 120  
 
2. Advanced COPD/CHF : must have all three criteria: a, b, and c  
a. CHF/COPD 
b. Shortness of breath sitting or lying flat 
c. Extensive or total assistance walking in room, transferring, wa lking in corridor,   
locomotion on/off unit, or dressing. 
PROVEN Protocol - Version 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page 13  
Aim 3:   Patients > 65 who are in nursing home < 90 days (short-stay) who have advanced dementia 
OR advanced CHF/COPD as defined above. 
 Aim 4:  Long and short-stay patients > 65 who do NOT have either advan ced dementia OR 
advanced CHF/COPD as defined above. 
 
4.3. Exclusion Criteria 
Facilities with unstable organiza tional or regulatory issues (i n transition or leadership 
problems or recent poor performance in regulatory surveys) such  as those listed below will be 
excluded prior to randomizati on based on input from corporate l eadership: 
 Recent turnover in NH Administ rator or Director of Nursing  
Recent bad state or federal quality assurance survey (e.g., res triction on admissions, levied large 
civil monetary penalty, etc.)  
Current new initiatives/competing demands  
 There are no patient exclusion cr iteria other than those implie d by eligibility criteria.  
4.4. Study Enrollment Procedures  
4.4.1.  Facility Recruitment Procedures:  
Facility recruitment will be conducted during months 1 and 2 of  year 1. As a first step, eligible 
facilities among the Genesis Heal thCare and PruittHealth NHs wi ll be identified by the research 
team at Brown University usi ng the most recent patient and orga nizational data available (at least 
2014). Bed size will be determined using CMS’s Provider of Serv ice files. Case-mix (number of 
short and long stay patients) will be determined using the most  recent aggregated nursing home 
resident assessment Minimum Data Set data available. Once candi date facilities are identified 
based on size and case-mix, final facility eligibility will be determined by corporate representatives 
based on the presence of EMR systems that include physician ord er sets and the absence of facility 
organizational instability or regulatory challenges since these  will consume executive time and 
attention, possibly complicating pa rticipation in the implement ation of the intervention. 
Once eligible facilities are identified, they will be randomly assigned to either the control or 
intervention arm ( see Section 4.4.2. for randomization procedures) by statisticians at Brown 
University . An information letter endorsed by senior corporate leaders will  be mailed to the senior 
administrators of all NHs randomized to the intervention arm. T he letter will explain what 
involvement the facility has been selected for the ACP Video Pr ogram. Facility leadership will be 
given the opportunity to opt out . While senior corporate leader s will strongly endorse the project, 
the final decision to participate in the intervention arm will be at the discretion of the individual 
facility’s administrator. NHs randomized to the intervention wh ose administrators refuse to 
participate will not receive the intervention, but will be cons idered as intervention NHs in the 
intention-to-treat analyses (see Section 9) . NHs randomized to the control arm will not be formally 
contacted and will not be aware that they are serving as contro l facilities. 
The decision to randomly assign fa cilities prior to recruitment  was based on the following 
reasons: 1. With strong corporate endorsement, we believe a ver y high recruitment rate in the 
intervention arm can be achieved (i.e., > 90%), and 2. We feel it would be unfair to conditionally 
offer the ACP Video Program to all eligible NHs, and then resci nd that possibility to the NHs 
PROVEN Protocol - Version 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page 14 randomized to the control arm, and 3. Our partner health care s ystems strongly preferred post-
randomization recruitment.  
Once the intervention NHs are recruited, intervention training and implementation will be 
rolled out in a staggered fashion over the next 6 months (see Section 5.2) , such that by month 8 of 
year 1, all intervention NHs will be up and running.    
4.4.2.  Facility Recruitment Estimates:   
Based upon our sample size calculations, we require 103 facilit ies per arm (See section 9.2). 
To account for the fact that some (we estimated up to 10%) faci lities randomized to the intervention 
arm would fail to participate fully in the intervention impleme ntation (but will be included in our 
intention to treat analysis) we increased our facility recruitm ent targets by at least 10%, for a total 
of 119 facilities in the i ntervention study arm.  
From the pool of eligible facilities, 119 will be randomly assi gned to the intervention arm, 
and all the remaining eligible facilities (n=241) will be assig ned to the control arm (approximate 
2:1 control:intervention match). We will leave all non-interven tion facilities in the control arm 
since there is no additional cost to do so and having the incre ased number of control facilities 
increased precision.  
4.4.3. Facility Randomization and Stratification Procedures:  
Facilities will be randomized usi ng a stratified approach with two levels of stratification.  The 
first stratum is the NH health care system (Genesis  HealthCare  and PruittHealth). Within each 
health system, the second stratu m will be on the hospitalizatio n rate as measured by # 
hospitalization/person-d ays alive for patients with advanced de mentia or COPD/CHF in all NHs 
in each health care system in the prior 12 months based on MDS files available at Brown 
University. The rationale for this stratum is that hospitalizat ion rates, the primary trial outcome, 
are known to vary considerably at the facility-lev el due to reg ional practice, market influences and 
underlying quality. Since inter- facility hospitalization rates vary quite broadly, facilities will be 
grouped into terciles to minimize the chance of misdistribution . After the second stratification level 
is applied, facilities will be randomly assigned to either the control or intervention arm by a 
statistician at Brown University.  Immediately following random assignment, we will test the 
balance between the arms using all available facility and resid ent-level data.

Page 15 4.4.4. Patient Participation and Consent 
There are special informed consen t considerations for individua l patients in this pragmatic, 
cluster RCT (see Sections 6.2 and 11.2) . The NH is the unit of randomization, the intervention is 
of relatively low risk, and it will be implemented facility-wid e as part of the intervention facilities’ 
standard operating procedures for ACP. In the control arm, usua l care for ACP will be in place. In 
both study arms, all data will be ascertained from existing sou rces. NH administrators, who either 
agree or disagree to facility par ticipation in the intervention  arm, are serving as gatekeepers for the 
study. Thus, we will seek a waiver of individual informed conse nt as set forth by criteria found in 
HHS 45 CFR 46:116: (1) the researc h involves no more than minim al risk; (2) the waiver will not 
adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects; (3) th e research could not practicably be 
carried out without the waiver; and (4) if appropriate, the sub jects will be provided with additional 
pertinent information after participation. 
5. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
5.1. Interventions, Administration, and Duration  
The ACP Video Program will be i mplemented for 24 months in each  intervention facility. 
The intervention consis ted of five previously created videos th at addressed common ACP 
decisions in NHs: 1. Goals of Care for Any Patient ; 2. Goals of Care for Patients with Advanced 
Dementia , 3. Decisions about Hospice , 4. Decisions about Hospitalization , and 5. General 
Information about Advance Care  Planning for Healthy Adults . The videos are in English and 
Spanish, 6-10 minutes in durat ion, and offered to patients, fam ily members, or both as deemed 
appropriate by the providers.  The Goals of Care for Any Patient  video outlines three broad levels  of care: intensive medical 
care, basic medical care, and com fort care. A physician-moderat or introduces the broad concept 
of ACP and the levels-of-care framework.  The video continues w ith narrative explanations and 
visual images of typical treatments that align with each level.  For example, for intensive medical 
care, a resuscitation being conduc ted on a simulated patient an d an actual ventilated patient in an 
intensive care unit are shown. For  basic medical care, a patien t in a hospital bed getting 
intravenous treatment is shown. F or comfort care, a patient lyi ng comfortably getting oxygen via 
a face mask and an attendant assisting with self-care are shown . A similar rubric is used for the 
Goals of Care for Patients with Advanced Dementia  video, but it is tailore d to this specific 
condition and aimed at family members. The Decisions about Hospitalization  and Decisions 
about Hospice  videos focus on decision-making for  these specific interventio ns. The General 
Information about Advance Care  Planning for Healthy Adults  video is designed for the relatively 
healthy patients admitted to a NH for post-acute care for a foc used, time-limited medical issue, 
such for rehabilitation followi ng an elective knee replacement.  This is primarily an educational 
video that presents the basic c oncepts of ACP and advance direc tives in a manner that would be 
appropriate for any relativel y healthy person to understand. In clusion of this video was informed 
by our experience in the pilot st udy, during which NH staff fel t they did not have the “right” 
video to show these relativel y healthy post-acute  care patients .  
The videos are intended to suppl ement, not replace, existing AC P counseling practices. Thus, 
provider training included guidan ce on initiating ACP conversat ions, integrating videos into 
discussions, and debriefing with pa tients and families after th e video.  
 
PROVEN Protocol - Version 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page 16 5.2. Intervention Training, Implement ation, and Adherence Monitoring  
At each intervention facility, tw o senior staff members were de signated as ACP Champions 
and were responsible for implementing all aspects of the ACP Vi deo Program. Implementation 
involved two major components: 1. Use of the videos with indivi dual patients and families, and 2. 
Integration of the ACP Video Pr ogram into the workflow of the N H. Our research team provided 
a standardized approach for bot h these components through our t raining program. However, in the 
spirit of a pragmatic trial, NH staff had the flexibility to ta ilor aspects of the implementation as 
dictated by local NH practices, workflow, and culture. Provider s also individualized the timing, 
format, and intensity of ACP Video Program based on each patien t’s clinical needs.  
Intervention traini ng and implementation began in January 2015;  approximately 30 
intervention NHs were trained i n each of 4 sequential waves. Th e implementation strategy was 
collaboratively designed by the r esearch team and corporate lea ders but executed almost 
exclusively by the healthcare sy stems. Each NH designated two A CP program champions, one of 
whom was a social worker, charg ed with leading implementation a t their facility. Only corporate 
leaders were aware the interve ntion NHs were part of an RCT. AC P champions and NH 
providers were simply told the p rogram was a new, corporate-led  initiative. 
In keeping with a pragmatic tri al, healthcare systems and NHs h ad flexibility to tailor the 
implementation protocol to their s pecific environments. The pro tocol instructed NH staff to offer 
videos to patients or families at the following trigger events:  1. Within 7 days of admission or 
readmission, 2. Every 6 months f or long-stay patients, 3. When decisions were being discussed 
for which there was a speci fic video (e.g., hospice), and 4. Sp ecial circumstances (e.g., out-of-
town family visit, change in heal th status). Clinicians could c hoose which video(s) to show, with 
the goal-of-care video being the m ost widely applicable. Videos  were pre-loaded onto tablet 
devices (two devices per facility ) and available for out-of-tow n family members through a 
password-protected web link.  
Training materials included two pr inted toolkits, webinar compa nions to the toolkits, and 
pocket-sized reference guides. O ne toolkit focused on protocols  for providers showing the videos 
to patients and families; another focused on implementing the v ideos into the NH workflow. 
Training occurred during the mont h prior to the implementation for each wave and periodically 
thereafter. Monthly conference calls are held among ACP champio ns, corporate leaders, and 
researchers to review the progr ess of implementation and resolv e difficulties. 
To monitor adherence, a Video Sta tus Report (VSR) was integrate d into the electronic 
medical records of intervention NHs. Providers were instructed to complete the VSR each time a 
video was offered, even if it wa s not shown (e.g., patient refu sed). The VSR documented which 
video(s) was shown, who watch ed it (e.g., family, patient), and  who showed it. The research 
team linked VSR with real-time MDS data to generate adherence r eports which were sent to 
corporate leaders each month. The  reports presented adherence m easures for two primary 
indications for offering videos w hich were readily quantifiable ; within 7 days of 
admission/readmission and every 6 months for long-stay patients . MDS data provided the 
denominator (e.g., number of admissions), and the VSR provided the numerator (e.g., VSRs 
completed for the new admissions). Both healthcare systems cons tructed similar internal reports, 
albeit primarily for admissions, e very two weeks using their ow n data for more frequent 
monitoring.  All NHs are required by federal law to engage patients in ACP,  which currently occurs in an 
ad hoc fashion. The intervention is intended to provide a stand a r d  f r a m e w o r k  f o r  A C P  t o  
complement direct counseling by providers. Thus, the ACP Video Program will be integrated into 
PROVEN Protocol - Version 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page 17 the workflow of each facility as part its standard operating pr ocedures. The ACP Video Program 
will be rolled out at the facility-level in much the same way a s other new system-wide clinical 
programs are introduced through existing NH corporate infrastru ctures and procedures with the 
exception that this roll-out will  only occur in intervention fa cilities. Typically, these roll-outs are 
done on a regional basis under the direction of a senior corpor ate administrator responsible for 
NHs within specific regions. Our research team will work direct ly with these regional directors to 
facilitate the ACP Video Progr am roll-out and facility-level im plementation. 
 The standardized approach for using the ACP videos with indivi dual patients and families 
includes the following considerations: 1. When to offer the vid eos, 2. Who should offer the videos, 
3. Which video to show which patients, 4. How to show the video s, and 5. How to integrate the 
videos into broader ACP discus sions, and 6. Completion of a Vid eo Status Report User Defined 
Assessment.  As per our protocol, NH staff will be instructed to offer vide os to patients at the following 
clinical triggers:  
 Within 7 days of a new admission or readmission 
 Every 6 months for long-stay patien ts coinciding with regularly  scheduled care planning 
meetings 
 Whenever there is a significan t change in clinical status 
 When a treatment decision arises for which there is a specific video (e.g., hospice) 
 Special circumstances when goals of care are being considered ( e.g., family visiting from out-
of-town)  
 The discipline of the NH staff member showing the videos can v ary and should align with the 
person who is typically responsible  for ACP in the facility (e. g., physician, social w orker, nurse). 
The staff will have flexibility with respect to choosing which video (s) to show individual patients, 
with the general goals-of-care vi deo being the most generic and  widely applicable. The videos will 
be pre-loaded onto tablet devices provided to each NH (2 device s/facility). The videos are typically 
shown at the bedside. In addition, the videos will be available  through password protected internet 
links for family members to access remotely.  
 
5.2.2. Intervention training: The training materials and procedures described below have been  
developed and successfully teste d in the 4 pilot facilities in the UH2 year. In the full trial, training 
procedures will be scaled up a nd conducted on a regional basis within each corpor ate chain using 
the existing infrastructures.  
Training materials that have been developed specifically for th is project include:  i. an ACP 
Video Program toolkit, ii. a webinar companion to the toolkit, and iii. a laminated pocket sized 
quick reference guide. The toolkit presents detailed guidance a nd suggested protocols for: 1. using 
the videos with individual patients and families, and 2. integr ating ACP Video Program into the 
workflow of the NH.  The 30-minut e webinar presents essentially  the same material as the toolkit 
but in PowerPoint format narrated by Dr. Volandes. The pocket s ized reference guide is intended 
for staff using the videos and serves as a reminder of key poin ts (i.e., when to show a video, which 
video to show which patient, documentation to complete). 
Training procedures involve seve ral formats. As in the pilot st udy, members of our research 
team will travel to central locations to conduct regional train ings for staff representing multiple 
NHs within a corporate chain (i.e., regional directors, facilit y ACP Champions). We use a train-
the-trainer approach such that t hese representatives will retur n to their facilities to train their own 
staff on-site. In addition, Webinars will be held on a regular basis via WebEx during the 
PROVEN Protocol - Version 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page 18 implementation start up. The printed toolkit and pocket referen ce guide will be distributed to all 
NH staff involved in the ACP Vid eo Program. SharePoint sites wi ll be set up through both the 
Genesis HealthCare and PruittHealth intranets exclusively for t he intervention NHs. The 
SharePoint sites will include all study related information inc luding the training materials (toolkit, 
Webinar), dates of Webinars and other meetings, internet links to videos, and how to get help with 
the ACP Video Program. Webinars and regional trainings will con tinue periodically  during the 24-
month implementation period for new staff. Finally, we will hol d at least bi-monthly check-in 
conference calls for each corporate chain during which NH staff  will have the opportunity to 
problem solve any issues with the research team and share their  experiences. As of June 2017, 
these group check-in conference calls have been cancelled and r eplaced with calls attended by 
members of the research team, healthcare system coordinators an d ACP champions at each 
intervention site individually. These calls are dedicated to re viewing a list of long-term care 
patients at the facility and providing strategies for improving  the show rates for these patients. A 
list of long-term care patients with names, numerical identifie rs, and video offered/shown status is 
provided to the ACP Champions. Members of the research team are  provided with the same list 
with numerical identifiers only. The following call is spent re viewing an update on the video shown 
status of each patient previously  discussed and reviewing an up dated list of long-te rm care patients. 
These calls occur every 2-3 months.   
5.3. Concomitant Interventions 
ACP is required by federal law i n all NHs. Thus, intervention f acilities will already have 
existing procedures or programs for ACP prior to this study.  A s this is a pragmatic trial, our 
research team will not inter fere with ongoing ACP initiatives o r dictate whether they should be 
replaced with the ACP Video Pr ogram. Rather, it will be left to  the discretion of individual 
facilities to integrate the pr ogram into their existing ACP pro cedures.   
 
5.4. Control 
Participant NHs randomized to the control arm will use the usual ACP proced ures practiced 
in their facilities. Control facilities w ill not be offered an alte rnative intervent ion for this 
pragmatic trial as this is not w hat happens in the “real world. ” We recognize that control and 
intervention facilities may be us ing other programs intended to  improve ACP and/or reduce 
hospitalizations that are continuously bei ng introduced into he alth care setting (e.g., 
INTERACT,58 POLST 32). This is what “usual” care re flects in a large pragmatic tria l and 
experience suggests that these  practices vary widely within and  between NH systems.  
 
5.5. Adherence Assessment 
A user defined assessment record entitled a “Video Status Repor t” created and tested in the 
pilot study will be uploaded into the EMR of all the interventi on facilities. Staff will complete 
this record each time they offe r a video, which will capture: t he date a video was offered, who 
offered it, the clinical trigger  prompting the video, whether o r not the video was shown, which 
video was shown, who viewed it (p atient and/or family), if any serious negative reaction 
occurred, and if any clarificati ons were requested about the su bject matter. Real -time MDS data, 
which will be obtained monthly fro m our partner health care sys tems for all intervention and 
control facilities, w ill provide the estimated number of patien ts who could have been shown a 
video within a speci fic time frame, (e.g., all new admissions) allowing us to calculate an estimate 
of the proportion of patients for w hom a Video Status Report Us er Defined Assessment was 
completed and therefore the proportion of patients by type who watched a video. Adherence data 
PROVEN Protocol - Version 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page 19 will allow the research team to  measure intervention fidelity a nd to distribute reports to regional 
directors and ACP Champions that assess adherence to the video program so that they can make 
improvements as needed.  
 
6. DATA SOURCES AND ELEMENTS 
 
With the exception of the Video S tatus Report User Defined Asse ssment, all data are derived 
from existing data sources. 
6.1 Data Sources 
6.1.1.  Electronic Medical Record (EMR). Both NH systems have sophisticated EMR systems 
in their facilities. Genesis HealthCare uses PointClickCare™,98 and  PruittHealth uses American 
Health Tech. 99 Both EMRs integrate individual patient-level data such as MDS assessments and 
physician order entry. The EMR will be a source for MDS data, a dvance directives, and the Video 
Status Report User Defined Assess ment (in intervention faciliti es only). The EMR will be used to 
ascertain health care utilization data (i.e., hospital transfer s) for patients in Medicare Advantage 
programs, as Medicare claims will not have these data as they w ould for patients with traditional 
fee-for-service Medicare insurance.   6.1.2.  Minimum Data Set Standardized (MDS) Resident Assessment: The MDS resident 
assessment instrument has nearly 400 data elements. The assessm ents are done for all patients 
admitted to Medicare- and Medicaid-certified NHs, including enr ollees in both traditional 
Medicare and Medicare Advantage. Assessments are done upon admi ssion and at least quarterly 
thereafter. NHs are required to submit their MDS data to CMS on  a regular basis. 82, 85, 121, 122 
Repeated evaluations of the reliability of the MDS yielded adeq uate to good values on most data 
items and scales. Brown University investigators found that the  “missingness” of elements is 
low.82, 85, 121, 122  
 6.1.3.  Medicare Enrollment, Vital Status, and Claims data : Medicare enrollment and vital status 
data will be used to obtain death dates and to identify patient s enrolled in traditional fee-for-service 
Medicare or Medicare Advantage insurance programs.  Medicare cl aims ascertain health care 
utilization data for fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries, in cluding hospital tran sfers (hospital 
admissions, emergency room visits , observation stays, etc.) and  hospice enrollment.  
 
6.1.4.  Online Survey Certification Automated Record (OSCAR): The OSCAR is a publicly 
available system of records based upon the Medicare/Medicaid ce rtification and inspection process 
all NHs being reimbursed undergo. OSCAR data will be used to sc reen facilities for eligibility 
(i.e., size) and to describe characteristics of participant NHs  (e.g., ownership, size, staffing, 
services, patient acuity and qua lity inspection results).123, 124  
6.2 Data Linkage and Management 
Brown University investigators a nd database management staff al ready receive national 
MDS, Medicare, and OSCAR data semi-annually or quarterly under several CMS data use 
agreements (DUAs). There is a well -established data base manage ment structure for linking 
these files. The only new activit y for PROVEN is integration of  the EMR data from experimental 
and control facilities with CMS M edicare enrollment records and  Medicare claims. Both partner 
PROVEN Protocol - Version 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page 20 NH systems have experience gene rating files for export for data  warehousing. Using algorithms 
based on standard patient identifie rs including Heath Insurance  Claim (HIC) numbers, date of 
birth, gender, and Social Securi ty Numbers (SSNs), matching rat es generally exc eed 98%. In the 
UH2 pilot study, secure data tran sfer and linkage of EMR data f rom four facilities (two 
NHs/chain) to Brown University w ere successfully accomplished, and frequency distributions of 
the resulting data have been gene rated. During the full trial, EMR data for all eligible facilities 
will be transferred from particip ating health care system corpo rations’ IT staff to Brown 
University on a monthly basis. The se data will be transferred t o a secure server at Brown 
University using an encrypted SFT P connection. Once the data ar e examined for completion, the 
health care system corporation IT staff will be notified that t ransfer was successful. The HIC and 
SSN identifiers will then be rep laced by Brown University’s sys tem manager with an 
alphanumeric ID that will allow a nalysts to link these EMR reco rds to Medicare datasets. 
6.3 Data Elements 
Data elements and sources are described below and in Table 2. 
 
6.3.1. Facility-level data: Facility-level data are needed for facility recruitment, random ization, 
and descriptive purposes. Organi zational data from OSCAR includ e: number of beds, for-profit 
status, and NH chain. Aggregated MDS data at Brown University p rovide information case-mix 
(% long-stay and post-acute care p atients). MDS data are also u se to calculate the hospitalization 
rate of each facility by estimating the number of patient days at risk of hospitalization from the 
nursing home and counting the numbe r of actual hos pital transfe rs to hospital per unit time. It is 
these hospital specific rates fr om the prior year which will be  used to undertake the stratified 
randomization scheme (see Section 4.4.2). Medicare claims available at Brown University will be 
used to determine the facilities’ hospitalization rates for the  subset of patients with Medicare fee 
for service.

7. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
 
7.1. Minimal Risk Determination  
We will seek a minimal risk determ ination for the PROVEN trial as per HHS 45 CFR 
46.102: “Minimal risk means that the probability  and magnitude of harm or discomfort 
anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves  than those ordinarily 
encountered in daily life or during the performance of rou tine physical or psychological 
examinations or tests.”   
Justification for a minimal ri sk determination is based on seve ral considerations. First, all 
NHs must engage patients and families in ACP as part of routine  clinical practice. There is 
currently no standard ized method by which NHs conduct ACP. PROV EN will compare a 
practice intervention (rolled out  in intervention sites as stan dard operating procedures as directed 
by corporate leadership) that  uses videos to enrich ongoing ACP  practices. Prior studies 
evaluating the ACP videos by our  group included several hundred  subjects, including healthy 
older adults, NH patients, family  members of patients with life -limiting illnesses and patients 
with advanced cancer and c ongestive heart failure. 66, 67, 70-72, 125 The videos were also tested in 
our UH2 pilot study. Finally, the videos have been seen by thou sands of patients in Hawaii as 
part of an on-going state-wide implementation program. In prior  research, our p ilot testing, and 
Hawaii initiative, there were  no instances of untoward viewer d istress and the videos never had 
to be stopped because of adverse viewer reactions. Thus, we bel ieve the intervention does not 
incur any greater distress  than usual ACP practices.  
 Second, data collection also conf orms with the definition of m inimal risk. No direct input 
from the resident or family member is needed to obtain any data  for this study. All the data are 
already being collected as part of routine medical care (EMR, M DS, Medicare data). The only 
additional data being collected in the intervention NHs is the Video Status Report User Defined 
Assessment, which is being embedded into the EMR. The Video Sta tus Report User Defined 
Assessment is needed to monitor intervention fidelity and will be incorporated into the intervention 
facility’s ACP protocol.   
 7.2. Serious Negative Reactions and Serious Adverse Events 
The potential serious negative reaction (SNR)  that could occur during this trial is serious 
distress by patients or family members in the intervention NHs while viewing an ACP video. As 
described in Section 7.1. , we anticipate that such SNRs will be exceedingly rare. Noneth eless, 
serious distress by may be manifested as a very negative emotio nal reaction while watching or 
after watching a video, asking for the video to be stopped, or leaving the room while a video is 
being shown. Due to the sensitive nature of the material, teari ng up by the proxy can be expected 
and is not deemed to be a r eflection of distress. 
We do not believe that there are any potential consequences of this trial that meet the definition 
of serious adverse events (SAEs). 
(We do not believe death should be considered a SAE for the PRO VEN trial for the following 
reasons. First, the study is being conducted in a frail NH popu lation with advanced illnesses. Thus, 
PROVEN Protocol - Version 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page 23 death is often not an unexpected event in their clinical course . Second, all NHs must engage 
patients and families in ACP as part of routine clinical practi ce. The videos are meant as an adjunct 
to facilitate ACP counseling. The underlying intent of all ACP,  regardless of how it is done, is to 
help patients make informed tr eatment decisions so they receive  care that is conc ordant with their 
preferences. For patients who pr efer comfort or palliation as a  main goal of care (vs. life 
prolongation), death is not an adverse outcome. Finally, it is not known whether more aggressive 
care (i.e., hospitalization) would result in greater mortality compared to less aggressive care (i.e., 
conservative or palliative treatment on-site in the NH). Theref ore, while we hypothesize that there 
will be fewer hospitalizations among NH patients with advanced disease randomized to the 
intervention arm (vs. control), i t is impossible to predict how  this may impact mortality rates.) 
 
7.3. Reporting Procedures 
As part of NH staff training, instructions will be given to the  facility ACP Champions and 
providers who will be showing the video (i.e., physician, nurse , social worker) about what 
constitutes an SNR, i.e., seri ous distress by a patient or fami ly member during or immediately 
after a video. As described in Section 7.1.,  we anticipate that such SNRs will be exceedingly 
rare. Nonetheless, staff will be  instructed that if such an eve nt occurs, then the video should be 
stopped. The provider should report the event to his/her immedi ate supervisor and ACP 
Champions as soon as possible, but not exceeding 4 hours after the event. Together, these health 
professionals will determine the severity of the event. If deem ed to be a true SNR, the ACP 
Champion will complete an SNR For m created by our research team , which will be submitted to 
the research project director s via email or fax within 24 hours  of the event. The ACP Champion 
will also inform the PROVEN project director within 24 hours of  the event by telephone. The 
project director will report t he SNR to all 3 co-PIs via email or telephone immediately upon 
becoming aware of the event and w ill also notify the Data Safet y and Monitoring (DSMB) Chair 
in writing (email and hard c opy) within 48 hours. It will ultim ately be the co-PIs responsibility to 
ensure that the DSMB chair is informed in a timely manner.   The Brown University IRB has 
indicated that SNRs do not need to be reported to them.  This i s because the video intervention 
itself is considered standard ope rating procedures in the nursi ng homes, and so it is not part of 
the human subjects research t hat the IRB is monitoring. 
 
7.4. Follow-up for Serious Negative Reactions 
The NH provider and ACP Champion will be instructed to check on  the patient or family 
who experienced the distress at 6 and 24 hours after a SNR to s ee how he/she is managing. If 
deemed necessary, a patient shou ld be referred for counseling w ith a NH social worker or other 
mental health professional. In th e case of a family member, if deemed necessary, the NH 
provider may suggest to the proxy that he/she contact his/her o wn primary care provider. The 
research project director will contact the facility ACP Champio n within 48 hours of the SNR to 
determine the status of the pati ent/family and whether further counseling was deemed necessary. 
The project director will in tur n report the follow-up informat ion to the co-PIs (by telephone) and 
to the DSMB (in writing) withi n 72 hours using an SNR Follow-up  form. 
 
7.5. Safety Monitoring 
A DSMB for PROVEN will act in an advisory capacity to the Natio nal Institute on Aging 
(NIA) Director to monitor participant safety, data quality, and  progress of the study. External 
DSMB members include: Christine S Ritchie, MD, MSPH (University  of California San 
Francisco) (Chair), Cynthia J. Brown, MD, MSPH (University of A labama at Birmingham), and 
PROVEN Protocol - Version 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page 24 Michael E. Miller, PhD (Wake Forest University School of Medici ne).  Dr. Miller’s membership 
was approved by Dr. Richard Hodes (NIA Director) on 6/9/2016 to  replace Arthur V. Peterson, 
Jr., Ph.D. (Department of Biostatistics, University of Washingt on).  Dr. Peterson served on the 
DSMB from 1/9/2015 to April 2016. Members of the PROVEN team wh o will participate in the 
open sessions of the DSMB include the 3 co-PIs (Mitchell, Mor, Volandes), the lead biostatistician 
(Gatsonis), and project director (Elaine Bergman). The NIA proj e c t  o f f i c e r  f o r  P R O V E N ,  D r .  
Marcel Salive, will attend DSMB m eetings and serve as the liais on between the DSMB and NIA. 
A PROVEN DSMB Charter outlines  its roles and re sponsibilities (see Appendix 16.1) .  
 
8. INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION 
The study may be discontinued at any time by the IRB, the NIA, the OHRP, the FDA, or 
other government agencies as part  of their duties to ensure tha t research participants are 
protected. Individual NHs in the interventi on arm may withdraw from study participation at any 
time at the discretion of their s enior management or corporate supervisors. Individual patients 
and families, while not being asked to provide informed consent  for this research, can refuse to 
watch a video offered to them as pa rt of this new ACP video pro gram being adopted into the 
clinical practice of  participating intervention NHs. Such refus als are expected as part of this 
pragmatic trial.  
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1.General Design Issues 
PROVEN is pragmatic cluster RCT of an ACP Video Program interve ntion for NH patients 
cared for in two NH health care systems: Genesis HealthCare and  PruittHealth. Rat ionale for this 
choice of study design is provide d in Section 2.6. The interven tion will be implemented facility-
wide; thus, all patients in t he NHs during the 24-month impleme ntation period comprise the 
study population. However, the ana lytic plan focuses on the eff ect of the ACP Video Program vs. 
control in the following t argeted patient sub-groups: 
 • Long-stay residents (≥90 days) with advanced dementia or adva nced CHF/COPD (Aim 2)  
• Short-stay patients (<90 days ) with advanced dementia or adva nced CHF/COPD (Aim 3)  
• Long and short-stay patients wit hout these advanced illnesses  (Aim 4).  
 
The primary trial outcome is hospi tal transfers (number of hosp ital transfers/person-days 
alive based on Medicare claims da ta), which include admissions,  emergency department visits, 
and observation stays over a 12-month follow-up period among Me dicare fee-for-service long-
stay residents with advanced deme ntia or advanced CHF/COPD. The  primary hypothesis is that 
the rate of hospital transfers w ill be lower in the interventio n group.  
Secondary outcomes include hospita l transfer rates in the sub-g roups examined in Aims 3 
and 4, and the following outcomes for all sub-groups in Aims 2,  3 and 4: advance directives, 
burdensome treatments, hospice use, and Medicare ACP billing co des. 
Each long-stay resident will be followed for up to 12 months st arting from the date they are 
first identified as meeting our target cohort definition during  the 24-month intervention period 
and short-stay patients will be followed for 100 days from thei r NH admission date. The analytic 
approach to Aims 2, 3, and 4 are sim ilar. Analyses begin with d escriptions of all major variables 
using frequencies and means/median s with SDs/interquartile rang es, as appropriate. Outcomes 
will be compared between the con trol and intervention arms usin g a zero-inflated Poisson model 
PROVEN Protocol - Version 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page 25 with random effects to account for  clustering at the NH level. While we do not anticipate an 
effect on mortality, analyses will also examine the effects on mortality. Primary analyses will 
follow the intention to treat pr inciple and will adjust for min or imbalances in patient 
characteristics, as needed. 
 
9.2. Sample Size and Randomization 
Sample size estimates are based on the primary trial outcome: #  hospital transfers/person-
days alive based on Medicare clai ms data), which include admiss ions, emergency department 
visits, and observation stays ove r a 12-month follow-up period among Medicare fee-for-service 
long-stay residents with advan ced dementia or advanced COPD/CHF . Based on data from our 
partners’ NHs in 2012 and 2013, we estimate that hospital trans fers per person-year alive in the 
control arm will be betwee n 1.06 and 2.12. Based on prior resea rch; we estimate the absolute 
reduction in hospital transfer r ates in the intervention vs. co ntrol NHs will range from .200 to 
.275 points, representing approxima tely a 16% relative reductio n.  
Computations for sample size 
estimates were performed using the approach for the comparison of 
incidence rates discussed in 
Chapter 5 of Donner & Klar and in Hayes & Bennett (1999). The sample size computation is based on a simplifying assumption of a Poisson distribution for the numbers of hospital transfers, and it assumes equal number of facilities in each arm. To achieve power of at least 90% in testing for 
a .25 point absolute reduction i n the observed average hospital  transfer rate of 1.51, we will 
require 103 facilities per study arm . This represents approxima tely a 16% relative reduction in 
the hospital transfer rate.  
Although our sample size calculation s indicate that we require 103 NHs/arm, to 
accommodate the anticipated 10% non-participation rate among NH s randomized to the 
intervention arm, we will recru it an additional 16 facilities i n the intervention arm for a total of 
119 intervention NHs. Moreover, bec ause there is an available t otal pool of 360 eligible facilities 
in our partner health systems, we will choose to assign the rem aining 241 facilities to the control 
arm (approximate 2:1 control:inte rvention match) since there is  no additional cost to do so.  
While more control facilities  only marginally increases power i t allows for a more precise 
estimate of the outcome of int erest in the control group.  
Data for 2012-13 from our partners  reveal that there are, on av erage, 42 people meeting 
advanced dementia and/or CHF/COP D target criteria per facility.  Thus, we estimate that there 
will be approximately 4,326 targe t patients in the 103 control NHs in (103*42=4,326) required 
by our aforementioned power calcu lation. In the actual assigned  facilities, we estimate there will 
be 4998 patients meeting these cr iteria in 119 intervention NHs  and 10,122 patients in the 241 
control NHs.  Table 3. Number of Clusters Required

Page 26 9.2.2.  Treatment Assignment Procedures:  Please refer to section 4  for a detailed description of 
the treatment assignment procedures.  
 9.2.3. Blinding: Our partner health care system s will know which facilities are designated 
intervention facilities, but will not be aware of those in the control group. Only Brown 
University statistician and data  management staff will know the  identity of the control facilities.  
They will present aggregated pos t-random assignment comparisons  of intervention and control 
facilities’ baseline characterist ics, but these preliminary ana lyses will be not generated at the 
individual facility level. As Dr. Volandes will be leading inte rvention training, he will be aware 
of the identity of the interve ntion NHs but will not be involve d in data analyses activities. Drs. 
Mitchell and Mor will be blinded to the identity of both the co ntrol and interve ntion facilities. 
Facility assignment will be unblinded to the DSMB members at th eir request.  
 
9.3.Interim Analyses and Stopping Rules 
We are not including stopping rules  in the PROVEN trial protoco l for several related reasons.  
First, it is our cont ention that this is a minimal risk study f or which serious negative reactions 
will be extremely rare (see Section 7.1) . Second, a stopping rule would n ot be very feasible. The 
implementation period is only 24 mon ths in each facility and th e outcome observation period is 
12 months for each target patient followed during that 24-month  period.  Final hospital transfer 
data may not be available for up t o six months after the admiss ion. Thus, differences in hospital 
transfer rates between the two study arms will not be known unt il the end of the 24-month study 
facility intervention period.   
 
9.4.Outcomes 
 
9.4.1. Primary outcome: The primary trial outcome is the hospital transfer rate (number  of 
hospital transfers/person-day a live based on Medicare claims da ta), which include admissions, 
emergency department visits, and o bservation stays) over a 12-m onth follow-up period among 
Medicare fee-for-service among long -stay residents with advance d dementia or advanced 
CHF/COPD over 12 months (Aim 2). 
 9.4.2. Secondary outcomes: Secondary outcomes include: i. hospital transfer rates in the s ub-
groups examined in Aims 3 (short-stay patients with advanced de mentia or advanced CHF/COPD) 
and Aim 4 (short-and long stay patients who do NOT have advance d dementia or CHF/COPD), 
and ii. The following outcomes fo r target sub-groups defined in  Aims 2, 3, and 4: advance 
directives, burdensome treatme nts (e.g., tube-feeding), receipt  of hospice services, and Medicare 
ACP billing codes.  
All outcomes in the long-stay p atient populations are calculate d over a 12-month follow-up 
period. For short-stay patients, advance directive completion r ates will be calculated over the 
admission period, and hospital transfer rates, use of burdensom e treatments, and hospice 
enrollment will be examined with in 100-days after the NH admiss ion date. 
9.5. Data Analyses 
Aim 1: To implement all aspects of a pragmatic cluster RCT : Assessment of Aim 1 will largely 
be experiential and based on mee ting planned recruitment milest ones. We will assess the 
implementation of the ACP Video Program by examining data from the new Video Status Report 
PROVEN Protocol - Version 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page 27 User Defined Assessment record created in the EMR that document s the videos offered. 
Descriptive statistics will be generated describing the proport ion of the general NH population and 
targeted sub-populations exposed t o the video, which videos the y saw, who saw them (patient 
and/or family members), who showed the videos (nurse, physician , social worker), and the timing 
of exposure (i.e., relative to a dmission, discharge care planni ng meetings). 
 
Aim 2 To evaluate the effectiveness of the ACP intervention among long-stay NH residents with 
advanced comorbid conditions: The sample includes long-stay residents with advanced dementia 
and advanced CHF/COPD. The primary trial outcome is the hospita l transfer rate (number 
transfers/person-days alive based on Medicare claims data), whi ch include admissions, emergency 
department visits, and observat ion stays) over a 12-month follo w-up period among Medicare fee-
for-service) in this cohort. Sec ondary outcomes include: advanc e directives (DNR, DNH, DNI, no 
tube-feeding), burdensome treatme nts (new feeding tube insertio n, intubation, pare nteral therapy, 
ICU care), hospice admission, and Medicare ACP billing codes. A ll outcomes will be 12-month 
incidence measures starting from the date residents are first i dentified as meeting the criteria for 
definitions of having advanced dementia or CHF/COPD during the 24-month intervention period. 
While we do not anticipate the ACP intervention to affect morta lity,31 our analyses will account 
for censoring during the 12-month observation period. We will f ormally test for a mortality 
differential between intervention and controls arms using a log istic regression random effects 
model, where clustering is performed by facility.   
Using current MDS data from CMS, we observe that the distributi on of the primary outcome, 
hospital transfers, is over-di spersed with many of the patients  having no hospital transfer over the 
12-month follow up period. In addition, we also observed that h ospital transfer rates vary across 
facilities, even after adjusting for underlying patient risk. T o account for these phenomena, we will 
utilize a zero-inflated Poisson distribution with facility rand om effects to test and estimate the 
effects of the ACP intervention. Zero-inflated Poisson models h ave been used in other public 
health settings. 128, 129 Formally, let Y ij be the number of hospital transfers for person i in facility j , 
Nij is the number of person days alive for person i in facility j, and T j is a treatment indicator that 
is equal to one if facility j is in the intervention group. The n where β 1 is the conditional increase 
in the log hospital transfer rat e in facilities that receive tr eatment vs. those that do not, and α 1 is 
the conditional log odds ratio f or being hospitalized vs. never  being hospitalized in the intervention 
vs. the control arm. When both α 1 and β 1 are smaller than 0, the ACP video is effective in reducing 
the proportion of patients hospi talized and the number of times  hospitalized. Using this model we 
will estimate the marginal average hospital transfer rate in ea ch arm and calculate the difference 
between the two arms. We will use a two sided test to examine i f the marginal average difference 
is significantly different than zero, and we will calculate the  corresponding interval estimate. As a 
secondary analysis, we will use the likelihood ratio test to co mpare the null hypothesis, 
, to the alternative hypothesis . 130 Confidence intervals 
for α 1 and β 1 can be obtained by inverting the likelihood ratio test.132 This analysis will enable us 
to provide additional details as to whether the effectiveness o f the intervention is to reduce the 
likelihood of one hospital transf er or the number of hospital t ransfers if transfe rred at least once. 01 1:0H11 1:0 0Ho r 

Page 28 The secondary outcomes are binary. 
Commonly used methods applied to the analysis of clustered RCT with binary outcomes are GEE and multilevel models.
131 The former method provides a 
population “average” e ffect, while the 
latter results in a conditional cluster 
effect.  For continuous Gaussian data, interpretation of the treatment coefficient is the same in conditional and marginal models; however, with b inary data, the treatment 
coefficient from a marginal model is smaller than that from a c onditional model and has a different 
interpretation.
132 For binary outcomes, Bellamy et al133 have shown that with few clusters GEE 
results were more likely to reject the null hypothesis, while c onditional models resulted in more 
conservative estimates. Austin concluded that the power of GEE and multilevel models are very 
similar for studies, like ours, that include more than 30 clust ers (facilities) with either variable or 
equal cluster size.134 To estimate the effect of ACP on secondary outcomes we will us e random 
effects logistic model. Formally, let S ij one of the secondary outcomes for person i in facility j, and 
Tj is a treatment indicator that is  equal to one if facility j is  in the treated arm.  
  
where γ 1 is the conditional log odds ratio for observing the secondary outcome in the treatment 
arm vs. the control arm. When γ 1 is smaller than 0, ACP is effective. As for the primary outcome  
we will use the likelihood ratio test the null hypothesis  , an d by inverting this test we 
will obtain the correspo nding confidence interval.  
 
Aim 3. To evaluate the effect iveness of the ACP intervention among new admissions to post-
acute care with the advanced comorbid conditions: Newly admitted NH patients to post-acute 
care with advanced dementia or advanced CHF/COPD disease will a ccrue throughout the 24-
month intervention. Measured out comes for this group will inclu de: advance directives to withhold 
specific treatments (DNH, DNR, DNI, no tube-feeding) at any tim e during their post-acute care 
admission, hospital transfers, a nd hospice enrollment within 10 0 days following NH admission. 
Preliminary data found that 100-day hospital transfer rates amo ng post-acute patients with 
advanced dementia and/or CHF/COPD was 37%, and that nearly 50% of advanced dementia and 
30% of advanced CHF/COPD patients died within 6 months of NH ad mission. In light of the high 
mortality rate, we will adopt the  hospital transfers per person -day alive approach described for 
Aim 2 to evaluate the effectiv eness of the intervention.  
 
Aim 4. To evaluate the effects of the ACP inte rvention among long-stay and new admissions to 
post-acute care WITHOUT advanced dementia 
or COPD/CHF:  The intervention is being 
implemented facility-wide, thus all long-stay 
residents and post-acute care admissions will be exposed to it. Aim 4 tests the impact of the intervention on NH patients WITHOUT 01

Page 29 advanced dementia or advanced CHF/COPD. Outcomes include:  adva nce directives during their 
NH stay, the number of hospital transfers over 12-months for lo ng-stay or over 100 days for short-
stay; and hospice admission over 12 months for long-stay or ove r 100 days for short-stay. As 
hospital transfers and hospice enrollment among post-acute care  patients are likely to occur after 
NH discharge, these outcomes can only be assessed among the fee -for-service Medicare 
beneficiaries using Medicare claims. The outcome, Yij,is a total count of hospital transfers. Many 
relatively healthy patients will have Yij=0 while others’ hospital use depends on the number of 
days that they are alive. We will use a zero-inflated Poisson model 135, 136of the following form 
shown in the equa tion, where , X i are the covariates, η is the treatment 
effect, and ε ij ~ N(0, σ π) is a random between facility effect. When η is larger than 0 and λ is smaller 
than 0, ACP video is effective.  The same analytic approach des cribed for Aim 2 will be used to 
evaluate the effectivenes s of the intervention. 
 
Sub-Group Analyses of Racial and Ethnic Group Differences in Intervention Effects:  It is well-
recognized that African-American NH patients with advanced illn ess are more likely than white 
patients to have outcomes reflecting more aggressive care, incl uding higher hospitalization rates 
and lower advance directive documentation rates, even after con trolling for patient and facility 
factors. Nonetheless, there is no evidence suggesting that Afri can American patients respond 
differently to our ACP intervention than white residents. In fa ct, the videos have been specifically 
designed to be appropriate t o viewers from all backgrounds  
Based on existing data, we anticipate only 11% of the patients included in our analyses will be 
African-American, and even lower proportions will be of other n on-white racial and ethnic groups. 
Thus, there will not be suffici ent power to detect small differ ences in outcomes among non-white 
groups. Consequently, these sub-group analyses are necessarily exploratory. Nonetheless, we will 
conduct sub-group analyses for Aim #2 separately among African- American residents and other 
racial/ethnic groups (e.g., Hispanic) if numbers allow. Additio nally, we will examine differences 
in video viewing rates among racial and ethnic groups.  
 
9.6. Undertaking Supplemental “As Treated” Analyses  
The primary analysis for the PR OVEN trial is an “intention to t reat” analysis in which the 
outcomes of target group long-stay  nursing home residents of in tervention facilities are 
compared to those of identically  defined residents of control f acilities.  This approach assumes 
that most eligible subjects in the intervention facilities will  be directly exposed to the 
intervention by watching one of the videos. While there may be an indirect effect on the facility 
culture related to the availabili ty of the videos and increased  discussions of “comfort care”, 
direct exposure by watching the video is assumed to be the more  powerful and complete 
approach to delivering the intervention. 
As part of the PROVEN trial, int ervention staff are to record w hen patients are offered and 
subsequently shown a video at eac h facility. The total number o f long-stay target residents who 
“should have been shown” the video  and the total number of such  patients who actually viewed 
the video at the facility are  routinely calculated. Although so me families and patients may have 
watched videos online, we are una ble to identify this number pr ecisely. Thus, the proportion of 
patients whom staff report as hav ing watched the video is a rea sonable proxy for the level of 
implementation of the interven tion across intervention faciliti es. As of the end of February 2018, 
only 12.5% of the long stay resid ents in System  1 facilities an d 31.4% in System 2 facilities were logit( )ij i i ij XT  ò
PROVEN Protocol - Versi on 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page 30 reported as having been shown a video.  However, there is subst antial variation in the rates of 
target residents reported as hav ing been shown the video, rangi ng from 0% to over 80%. This 
raises the question of whether it would be possible to compare the outcomes of patients exposed 
to the video who reside in nursing centers that embraced the vi deo-assisted advance care 
planning intervention to similar control patients from similar facilities. 
The principal stratification framework138 has been proposed as a po ssible solution to address 
non-compliance in randomized trial s and is appropriate in this instance because facilities can be 
classified on the basis of the e xtent to which they implemented  the intervention. The basic 
principal stratification framework initially posits that patien t i has two possible potential 
compliances: compliance unde r the intervention arm, D i(1), and compliance under the control 
arm D i(0). Using these potential states (outcomes), we can classify p atients into different strata 
and calculate the average effect within each stratum. When pati ents can either comply with the 
intervention or not, there are f our principal strata: compliers  (D i(1) = 1, D i(0)=0); never takers 
(Di(1) = 0, D i(0)=0); always-takers (D i(1) = 1, D i(0)=1); and defiers (D i(1) = 0, D i(0)=1).  For 
each patient, only one of these compliance outcomes is observed .  
Studies, such as ours, in which patients in the control group c annot obtain the intervention 
are commonly referred to as one -sided non-compliance. There are  three possible strata: (1) 
assigned to the intervention and did not take it – never-takers ; (2) assigned to the intervention 
and receive it – compliers; (3) assigned to the control and rec eived control – can be either never-
takers or compliers. Thus, a s tatistical methodology that is ai med at identifying the effect among 
compliers needs to identify among the control group those that would have not refused the 
treatment were it to have been offered.  Numerous studies have fruitfully employed the principal 
stratification framework to estimate the effects of an interven tion on compliers.139, 140, 141, 142 
We will estimate the effect of the intervention on the complier s who reside in facilities that 
have adopted the video-assisted i ntervention by creating a hier archy including compliance at the 
facility level and, within facili ty, adjusting for compliance s tatus at the individual level.  As 
noted, we find high variability bet ween intervention facilities  related to the likelihood that a 
patient would receive the interv ention. Because the interventio n is delivered almost entirely 
through the mechanism of facility s taff, we assume that individ ual compliance is affected by the 
facility’s and patient’s characteristics.  We can classify the treated facilities  into compliance 
groups based on the reported show rates and/or based upon more qualitative assessment of 
research staff working to impleme nt the intervention with parti cipating facilities. Compliance 
groups can be constructed and f acility-level characteristics th at are predictive of the compliance 
status can be identified using the large amount of facility and  aggregated resident data we have 
available. Preliminary analyses r eveal that several facility-le vel characteristics are correlated 
with the video offer and show r ates.  We propose developing a B ayesian model to multiply 
impute the compliance groups of c ontrol facilities based upon t hese types of facility-level 
characteristics for which we have considerable data elements. T he net result is a pool of high 
intervention implementers and a corresponding set of control fa cilities with similar predicted 
compliance. 
Preliminary data suggest that faci lity-level chara cteristics ar e more correlated with facility 
offer rates than to facility s how rates. This suggests that, al though facility characteristics 
influence the offer rate, patient-level characteristics are als o important determinants of actually 
watching the video. Thus, we will develop a modeling framework that identifies the compliance 
status for each patient within t he hierarchy of the cluster ran domized trial. This approach will 
first impute compliance status group for control facilities and  then will impute patient-level 
PROVEN Protocol - Versi on 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page 31 compliance status within each facility compliance group. This t wo-part imputation is performed 
using Bayesian models to predict compliance status for each fac ility, followed by a Bayesian 
model of patient-level complia nce within facilities with simila r predicted compliance status. 
Formally, let Y i(W) represent the potential outco mes for patient i under the in tervention, W=1, or 
the control, W=0. In addition, let L j(1) be the average compliance of facility j if it would have 
been assigned to the intervention arm, and M i(1) be the compliance of patient i if s/he would 
have resided in a facility expos ed to the intervention. We woul d estimate the following models: 
 
1. ݂ሺܻ௜ሺ1ሻ,ܻ௜ሺ0ሻ|ܮ௝ሺ1ሻ,ܯ௜ሺ1ሻ,ܺ௜,ܹ௜,ܼ௝ሻ - The potential outcomes conditional on patient's 
and facility's compliance status , and patient- and facility-lev el covariates. These models 
would be hierarchical zero inflated Poisson models. 
2. ݂ሺܯ௜ሺ1ሻ|ܮ௝ሺ1ሻ,ܺ௜,ܹ௜,ܼ௝ሻ - The compliances status of  patients conditional on the 
compliance status of the associated facility and on patient- an d facility-level covariates. 
This model would be a hierarchical logistic regression model. 
3. ݂ሺܮ௝ሺ1ሻ|ܼ௝,ܹ௝ሻ - Models the compliances status of facilities conditional on f acility 
characteristics. This model w ould be a linear regression model (with possible 
transformation) where X are patie nt level characteristics and Z  are facility level 
characteristics.  
 
10. DATA COLLECTION AND QU ALITY ASSURANCE  
10.1. Data Collection 
All data are derived from existing data sources with exception of the Video Status Report 
User Defined Assessment. Please see Section 6  which details these sources.  
 
10.2. Data Confidentiality 
Brown University’s Center for Ge rontology and Health Care Resea rch will receive EMR 
patient-level data from PruittHealth and Genesis HealthCare. Bo th NH systems have integrated 
sophisticated EMR systems in th eir facilities. G enesis HealthCa re uses PointClickCare™,98 and 
PruittHealth uses American Health Tech.99 The NH networks already ha ve experience extracting 
MDS from their EMR systems for purposes of submitting mandatory , regular MDS reports to 
CMS. To protect patient confiden tiality, the two corporations w ill place their data in a SSH 
secure server and will provide login information to Brown University. Dat a transfer to Brown 
University secure servers will be via SFTP protocol with passwo rd protection. Once the files 
have been uploaded to Brown Unive rsity's servers they will be s tored, unmodified, in a secure 
file location specific to these uploads. They will then be read  into SAS datasets, one per file type. 
Brown University will then notif y the facilities that the data was successfully downloaded and 
extracted, at which point the facilities will remove the data f rom their servers. All data files will 
be accompanied by a manifest detailing the number of distinct p ersons and records expected in 
them. Brown University will connect to the corporation servers on a monthly basis. Identifiers 
such as HICs and SSNs, will be included in order to be able to merge these person-level data to 
the data received from CMS. Brown  University’s information syst ems manager will be in charge 
of the data transfer, and he will replace the HICs and SSNs fie lds with a Brown University-
generated identifica tion number (throughout our different data sources) to allow linkage of data 
for analytic purposes.  
PROVEN Protocol - Versi on 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page 32 10.3. Data Management 
Brown University’s Center for Ge rontology and Health Care Resea rch will serve as the Data 
Management/Statistical Center for the PROVEN trial. The Center will be responsible for: 1. 
Receiving all data from CMS (Med icare, MDS), ii. Receiving all EMR data from PruittHealth 
and Genesis HealthCare Study f acilities, iii. Linking all data sources, and iv. Crea ting an analytic 
file and conducting analyses. Bro wn University investigators an d database management staff 
already receive national MDS, Medicare, and OSCAR data semi-ann ually or quarterly under 
several CMS DUAs. There is a well-established data base managem ent structure to linking these 
files. The only new activity for  PROVEN is integration of the E MR data from facilities with 
CMS Medicare claims and the MDS . The integration will be easily  achieved thanks to the 
availability of HIC and SSN per sonal identifiers in both the EM R data from facilities and in the 
CMS Medicare claims and MDS data. 
 
10.4. Data Use Agreements 
The Brown University Center for Gerontology has an extensive hi story of working with 
ResDac to obtain DUAs to use CMS MDS and Medicare data for NIH funded projects, which 
will be obtained for this proje ct. DUAs for the data sharing ar rangement between Brown 
University and the two partner he alth care systems, Genesis Hea lthCare and PruittHealth have 
already been obtained.  Our t eam will ensure all DUAs are compl iant with NIH requirements.  
 
10.5. Quality Assurance Metrics 
For the primary outcome, hospital transfers, we will have a qua lity control metric which 
compares hospital transfers as d erived from MDS assessments wit h hospital transfers obtained 
from Medicare Part A claims for patients who are in the traditi onal fee-for-service Medicare 
program. 
 
11. PARTICIPANT RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
 
11.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Review 
The PROVEN protocol will be reviewed and approved by the Brown University IRB.  
 
11.2. Informed Consent 
There are special informed consen t considerations for individua l patients in this pragmatic, 
cluster RCT. The NH is the unit of randomization, the intervent ion is of relatively low risk, and it 
will be implemented facility-wide as part of the intervention f acilities’ standard operating 
procedures for ACP. In the contro l arm, usual care for ACP will  be in place. In both study arms, 
all data will be ascertained from existing sources. NH administ rators, who either agree or 
disagree to facility participati on in the intervention arm are serving as gatekeepers for the study. 
Thus, we will seek a waiver of individual informed consent so a s set forth by the four criteria 
found in HHS 45 CFR 46:116. 137  
 
(1) The research involves no more than minimal risk:  See Section 7.1 for rationale for 
Minimal Risk Determination  
 
(2) The waiver will not adversely affect the rights and welfare  of the subjects: All NHs 
must engage patients and families in ACP as part of routine cli nical practice. There is currently 
no standardized method by which NHs conduct ACP. The ACP Video Program is intended to 
PROVEN Protocol - Versi on 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page 33 enrich ongoing ACP practices in the intervention NHs. Study ran domization is at the level of 
the NH, not the patient. While the patients in the intervention  arm are not informed of the 
study itself they are asked whether or not they want to be shown the video.  They ar e free to 
decline as they are free to decline any type of ACP discussion.   Patients in control NHs will 
be exposed to usual care. For NH residents in both study arms, we will be using data 
previously collected for non-research purposes (EMR and CMS dat a. These data will be 
obtained and managed in a conf idential manner for study purpose s (see Sections 10.2).  
 
(3) The research could not practicably be carried out without t he waiver: It would 
impossible to conduct this pragmatic trial  if it required ascertainm ent of individual informed 
consent for several reasons. Doing so would undermine the very intent of the pragmatic trial 
design trial: to test whether the videos are effective in a “re al-world” application under usual 
conditions. ACP is part of usual NH care and is simply being au gmented in the intervention 
facilities with the videos. Getting written informed consent is  not ‘usual’ for everyday NH 
care. In that vein, members of the NH staff are offering the vi deos to the patients in the 
intervention facilities, not the research team. The ACP videos are being integrated into the 
NHs’ standard operating procedures and offered to ALL NHs resid ents as part of the facility’s 
daily work-flow. It would not be feasible for the NH staff to o btain informed consent from all 
residents being offered the videos, especially since the videos  are being integrated into the 
standard of care in that NH. With regards to data acquisition, all the data used in the study, 
with the exception of the Video Status Report User Defined Asse ssment, are already being 
collected for non-research purpos es in both the intervention an d control NHs. If permission to 
use these data were required by way of informed consent, this w ould have to be done for ALL 
residents in all facilities by staff in BOTH the control and in t e r v e n t i o n  N H s .  I t  w o u l d  b e  
impossible and put undue burden on the NH staff and the residen ts themselves to collect 
individual consent for the use of their records. Such an approa ch would once again undermine 
the pragmatic intent of the study and also dramatically reduce both NH and patient 
participation to the extent th e study would not be possible. 
 
(4) If appropriate, the subjects will be provided with addition al pertinent information 
after participation:  We will provide the NH corporations, PruittHealth and Genesis

study by the Principal Investigators Vincent Mor, PhD, Susan Mi tchell, MD, and Angelo 
Volandes, MD for "PROVEN: Pragmatic Trial of Video Education in  Nursing Homes" (grant 
UH2AG049619) and any successor grants funded by the National In stitute on Aging.   
DSMB Responsibilities 
The DSMB responsibilities are to:  
 review the research protocol, informed consent documents, and p lans for data safety 
and monitoring;  
 advise the NIA on the readiness of the study staff to initiate  recruitment; 
 
 evaluate the progress of the trial, including periodic assessm ents of data quality and 
timeliness, recruitment, accrual and retention, participant ris k versus benefit, 
performance of the trial sites, and other factors that can affe ct study outcome; 
 
 consider factors external to the study when relevant informati on becomes available, 
such as scientific or therapeutic developments that may have an  impact on the safety of 
the participants or the ethics of the trial; 
 
 review study performance, make recommendations, and assist in the resolution of 
problems reported by the Principal Investigator; 
  
 protect the safety of the study participants; 
 
 report to NIA on the safety and progress of the trial;  
 
 make recommendations to the NIA, the Principal Investigator, a nd, if required, to 
regulatory authorities concerning continuation, termination, or  other modifications of the 
trial based on the observed beneficial or adverse effects of th e treatment under study; 
PROVEN Protocol - Versi on 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page 46  
 ensure the confidentiality of the study data and the results o f monitoring; and,  
 
 assist the NIA by commenting on any problems with study conduc t, enrollment, sample 
size, and/or data collection. 
 
The DSMB will discharge itself from its duties when the study i s complete. 
Membership 
Membership consists of persons completely independent of the in vestigators who have no 
financial, scientific, or other conflict of interest with the t rial. Collaborators or associates of the PI 
are not eligible to serve on the DSMB. Written documentation at testing to absence of conflict of 
interest is required. This DSMB will consist of 3 members havin g been approved by the Director 
of NIA.  
The DSMB includes experts in or representatives of the fields o f: 
 relevant clinical expertise,  
 clinical trial methodology, and  
 biostatistics.  
Dr. Christine Ritchie, MD has been selected by NIA to serve as the Chairperson and is 
responsible for overseeing the meetings, reviewing the first dr aft of the meeting notes with the 
NIA Program Official, and any decision making in the case of a tie vote. The Chair and the NIA 
Program Officer are the contact people for the DSMB. Brown Univ ersity shall provide logistical 
management and support for the DSMB.   The Chair will also serve as the safety officer. Any serious ad verse events that might be related 
to the intervention will be reported to the Chair of the DSMB a nd the NIA Program Official by the 
PI within 24 hours of his learning of the event. Board Process  The Principal Investigators will prepare the agenda to address the review of study materials, 
modifications to the study protocol and informed consent docume nt, initiation of the trial, 
reporting of serious negative reactions, and statistical analys is plan for the first meeting. This 
will be in consultation with the DSMB Chairperson and NIA Progr am Official. 
 Meetings of the DSMB will be held at least two times a year or at the call of the Chairperson. 
The NIA Program Official or designee will be present at every m eeting. An emergency meeting 
of the DSMB may be called at any time by the Chair or the NIA, should participant safety 
questions or other unanticipated problems arise. 
 Meetings shall be closed to the public because discussions may address confidential participant 
data. Meetings are attended by the Principal Investigators and members of their  staff. These 
meetings are expected to be conducted via conference call, howe ver an in-person meeting 
could be requested.   
 
Meeting Format  
 
PROVEN Protocol - Versi on 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page 47 DSMB meetings will consist of open and closed sessions. Discuss ion held in all sessions is 
confidential. The Principal Investigators and key members of th e study team attend the open 
sessions.  Open session discussion will focus on the conduct and progress  of the study, 
including participant accrual, protocol compliance, and problem s encountered. Unblinded data 
are not presented in the open session.   The closed session  will be attended by the DSMB members and the NIA representativ e(s). 
The study statistician should be present to present the report.  Any data by blinded study group 
and, as necessary, unblinded data, are presented during the clo sed session. 
 If necessary, an executive session  will be attended by voting DSMB members and the NIA 
staff and their representatives. The executive session will be held to identify and discuss the 
DSMB’s recommendations to the NIA. The study staff may be prese nt, at the request of the 
DSMB, during the executive session.  
 Each meeting must include a recommendation to continue or to te rminate the study made by a 
DSMB majority or unanimous vote. Should the DSMB decide to issu e a termination 
recommendation, the full vote of the DSMB is required. In the e vent of a split vote, majority vote 
will rule and a minority report should be appended. The DSMB Ch air provides the tiebreaking 
vote in the event of a 50-50 split vote.  A recommendation to terminate the study may be made by the DSMB  at any time by majority 
vote. The Chair should provide such a recommendation to the NIA  immediately by telephone 
and email. After the NIA Director makes a decision about whethe r to accept or decline the 
DSMB recommendation to terminate the study, the PI is immediate ly informed about the 
decision.  
 
Meeting Materials   
 DSMB interim report templates will be prepared by the study sta ff, typically the statistician, to be 
reviewed by the DSMB members at the first meeting.  Interim dat a reports generally consist of 
two parts:   
 Part 1 - Open Session Report and  
 Part 2 - Closed Session Report  
 
Format and content of the reports for both the open and closed sessions and plans for interim 
analyses should be finalized and approved at the initial DSMB m eeting, although changes 
throughout the trial may be requested by the Board.  
The reports will list and summarize safety data and describe th e status of the study. All meeting 
materials should be sent to the DSMB and the NIA at least 7 day s prior to the meeting. The 
reports are numbered and provided in sealed envelopes within an  express mailing package or 
by secure email as the DSMB prefers.  1. Part 1 - Open Session Reports:  Open session reports will include administrative reports 
that describe participants screened, enrolled, completed, and d iscontinued, as well as 
baseline characteristics of the study population. Other general  information on study status 
may also be presented. Listings of serious negative reactions a nd serious adverse events, 
as well as any other information requested by the DSMB, may als o be in the open session 
PROVEN Protocol - Versi on 3.0 - Date: 4/17/2018 
Page 48 report, but none of the data will be presented in an unblinded manner. The DSMB may 
direct additions and other modifications to the reports on a on e-time or continuing basis.  
 
2. Part 2 – Closed Session Report:  Closed session reports will present the same information 
as presented in the open session but by blinded treatment group  (e.g. A/B, etc.). The reports 
will contain data on safety measures. The closed session report s should be destroyed at the 
conclusion of the meeting. If meetings are held by telephone, p rinted copies of the closed 
reports should be destroyed immediately following the meeting.  
Additional Reports 
1.  Mailings to the DSMB:  On a scheduled basis (as agreed upon by the DSMB) blinded safe ty 
data will be communicated to all DSMB members or to the designa ted Safety Officer. Secure 
email can be used for distribution. 
 
2.  Access to Interim Data:  Access to the accumulating endpoint data should be limited to as 
small a group as possible, such as the statistician. Limiting a ccess to interim  data to the DSMB 
members relieves the investigator of the burden of deciding whe ther it is ethical to continue to 
randomize individuals and helps protect the study from bias in recruitment and/or evaluation.  
 
Reports from the DSMB 
 
A report containing the recommendations for continuation or mod ifications of the study will be 
prepared by the NIA Project Officer. The draft report will be s ent to the DSMB members not later 
than three weeks after the meeting. Once approved by the DSMB m embers, the Program 
Official will forward the DSMB recommendations to the Principal  Investigator. It is the 
responsibility of the Principal Investigator to distribute the DSMB recommendation to all co-
investigators and to ensure that copies are submitted to all th e IRBs associated with the study. 
 As previously stated, the DSMB report must include a recommenda tion to continue or to 
terminate the study. This recommendation should be made by form al majority vote. A 
termination recommendation may be made by the DSMB at any time by majority vote. The NIA 
is responsible for notifying the Principal Investigator of a de cision to terminate the study. In the 
event of a split vote in favor of continuation, a minority repo rt should be contained within the 
regular DSMB report. The report will not include unblinded data  or discussion of the unblinded 
data.   Confidentiality  
 
All materials, discussions and proceedings of the DSMB are comp letely confidential. Members 
and other participants in DSMB meetings are expected to maintai n confidentiality.

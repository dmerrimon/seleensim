Anatomical  changes  and physiological  processes  taking  over  tooth  extraction  were  studied  in the past  (Cryer  
1916,  Rogers  and Applebaum  1941,  Pietrokovski  and Massler  1967),  however  since  the introduction  of dental 
implants  in modern  odontology  these  issues  and the prevention  of edentulous  jaw atrophy  have  become  an 
important  topic.  The survival  of implants  and their  ability  to provide  adequate  function  and esthetics  are 
strictly  correlated  with  their  proper  positioning  in relation  to the alveolar  housing,  the neighboring  teeth  and 
the occluding  dentition.  It is thus  easily  understood  the tremendous  effort  that has been  used  by many  
researchers  and practitioners  in reducing  this unavoidable  modeling  and remodeling  process.  
 
 
 
Maxillary  and mandibular  bony  complexes  are composed  by several  anatomical  structures  with  a proper  
function,  composition  and physiology:  i) basal  bone  that develops  together  with  the overall  skeleton,  and 
forms  the body  of mandible  and maxilla;  ii) alveolar  process  that develops  following  tooth  eruption  and 
contains  the tooth  alveolus;  iii) the bundle  bone  that lines  the alveolar  socket,  extends  coronally  forming  the 
crest  of the buccal  bone,  and makes  part of the periodontal  structure  as it encloses  the external  terminations 
of periodontal  fibres  (Sharpey’s  fibers).  
After  tooth  extraction,  bundle  bone  appears  to be the first bone  to be absorbed  (Boyne  1966,  Hsieh,  Devlin  et 
al. 1994,  Devlin  and Sloan  2002)  whereas  alveolar  bone  is gradually  absorbed  throughout  life (Carlsson  and 
Persson  1967,  Ashman  2000).  The remodeling  process  results  in a ridge  morphology  reduced  in vertical  height  
and more  palatal  in relation  to the original  tooth  position  (Cryer  1916,  Rogers  and Applebaum  1941,  
Pietrokovski  and Massler  1967,  Pietrokovski  and Massler  1967).  
Studies  from  the Lindhe’s  group  suggest  bone  resoption  to occur  in 2 phases  (See  Figure  1). During  the first 
phase,  bundle  bone  is rapidly  resorbed  and replaced  with  woven  bone  leading  to a great  reduction  in bone  
height  especially  in the buccal  aspect  of the socket,  as its crestal  portion  is comprised  solely  of bundle  bone  
(Araujo  and Lindhe  2005).  In-vitro  animal  studies  have  demonstrated  the osteogenic  potential  of PDL derived 
cells  (Cho,  Matsuda  et al. 1992,  Ramakrishnan,  Lin et al. 1995)  although  the role of bundle  bone  in providing  
cells  for the regeneration  of new  bone  has been  more  recently  challenged  (Steiner,  Francis  et al. 2008)  as new  
bone  formation  appears  to initiate  from  the surrounding  alveolar  bone  cells  (Boyne  1966,  Hsieh,  Devlin  et al. 
1994,  Devlin  and Sloan  2002).  Lindhe’s  group  reported  that the presence  or absence  of PDL in the extraction  1.2 ALVEOLAR  RIDGE  REMODELING  1.0 INTRODUCTIO N 
socket  does  not influence  the features  of healing  after  3 months  (Cardaropoli,  Araujo  et al. 2005).  During  the 
second  phase,  the outer  surface  of the alveolar  bone  is remodeled  causing  an overall  horizontal  and vertical  
tissue  contraction.  The reason  for this remodeling  process  is still not well understood.  Disuse  atrophy,  
decreased  blood  supply,  and localized  inflammation  might  play important  roles  in bone  resorption.  However,  
it is now  apparent  that bone  remodeling  is a complex  process  involving  structural,  functional,  and physiologic  
factors  and that surgical  trauma  from  extraction  induces  microtrauma  to surrounding  bone,  which  accelerates  
bone  remodeling  (Garetto,  Chen  et al. 1995).  
Resorption  rate of  the alveolar ridges  is faster  during  the first  six months  following the extraction  (Pietrokovski  
and Massler  1967,  Johnson  1969)  and proceeds  at an average  of 0.5-1.0%  per year  for the entire  life (Carlsson 
and Persson  1967,  Ashman  2000).  The height  of a healed  socket  never  reaches  the coron al level  of bone  
attached  to the extracted  tooth  and horizontal  resorption  seems  to be greater  in the molar  region  compared 
to the premolar  area  (Schropp,  Kostopoulos et al.  2003, Hammerle,  Araujo et  al. 2012). Schropp  et al.  
estimated  two-thirds  of the hard  and soft tissue  changes  occur  in the first 3 months.  The authors  reported 
50%  of crestal  width  to be lost in a 12-month  period  (corresponding  to 6.1 mm;  range  2.7 to 12.2  mm)  2/3 of 
which  (3.8mm;  30%)  occurred  in the first 12 weeks.  When  examining  the premolar  area  only  a loss of alveolar  
ridge  width  of 4.9mm  (45%)  was reported,  of which  3.1mm  (28.4%)  occurred  in the first 12 weeks  (Schropp,  
Wenzel  et al. 2003).  A recently  published  systematic  review  (Tan,  Wong  et al. 2012)  reported  a greater  
horizontal  alveolar  ridge  reduction  (29-63%;  3.79  mm)  than  vertical  bone  loss (11-22%;  1.24  mm on the 
buccal,  0.84  mm on mesial  and 0.80  on distal  sites)  at 6 months.  In a long -term  study,  Ashman  reported 
alveolar  bone  shrinkage  of 40-60%  in height  and width  within  the first 2-3 years  (Ashman  2000,  Ashman  2000).  
 
 
 
Immediately  after  tooth  extraction,  the alveolar  socket  is filled  by blood  clot that is replaced  by granulation  
tissue  within  1 week  (see Figure  1) (Amler  1969).  In the healing  of a skin wound,  epithelial  cells  migrate  
underneath  and are protected  by the blood  clot.  In socket  healing  instead,  the epithelium  migrates  over  the 
granulation  tissue  to cover  the healing  socket  (Mangos  1941).  This happens  because  this inflammatory  tissue  
is recognized  as a connective  tissue  by the epithelial  cells  therefore  cellular  migration  occurs  over  its surface.  
This is important  when  we examine  Guided  Bone  Regeneration  applied  to socket  grafting.  Starting  from  the 
apical  and lateral  residual  bony  walls  the granulation  tissue  is rapidly  remodeled  to provisional  matrix.  
Mineralizing  processes  occur  leading  to the formation  of woven  bone  that eventually  is replaced  by mature  
lamellar  bone  (Trombelli,  Farina  et al. 2008).  1.3 SOCKET  HEALING  
Early  human  histological  investigations  reported  that extraction  sockets  are filled  with  delicate  cancellous  
bone  in their  apical  two thirds  at 10 weeks,  and are completely  filled  with  bone  at 15 weeks  (Mangos  1941). 
Increased  radiopacity  is demonstrated  as soon  as 38 days  and radiopacity  similar  to that of the surrounding  
bone  at 105 days  (Mangos  1941).  These  figures  might  be partially  biased  as specimens  were  harvested  from  
cadavers  therefore  their  late age and their  systemic  condition  might  have  led to delayed  wound  healing  
capabilities.  On the other  side,  animal  studies  demonstrate  accelerated  healing  as 3 weeks  old extraction 
sockets  in humans  compare  with  to 9-10 days  old sockets  in dogs  and a 3½ months  sockets  in humans 
compares  with  8 weeks  sockets  in dogs  (Clafin  1936).  
 
 
 
Bone  formation  in the alveolar  socket  is a naturally  occurring  event  as long  as surrounding  alveolar  walls 
remain  intact;  however  the alveolar  ridge  volumetric  contraction  may  impair  proper  implant  placement.  To 
reduce  loss of alveolar  bone  to acceptable  levels,  several  surgical  techniques  have  been  proposed.  Reducing  
the extraction  trauma  and limiting  flap elevation  (Fickl,  Zuhr  et al. 2008)  are essential  for obtaining  success  in 
each  of these  procedures.  Animal  studies  show  mixed  results  when  evaluating  differences  in ridge  remodeling  
between  flapped  and non-flapped  extraction  sockets  (Blanco,  Nunez  et al. 2008,  Fickl,  Zuhr  et al. 2008,  Fickl,  
Zuhr  et al. 2008,  Araujo  and Lindhe  2009,  Vignoletti,  Matesanz  et al. 2012)  although  it has been  hypothesized  
that by disrupting  the thin layer  of cells  that comprises  the osteogenic  layer  of the adult  periosteum,  the 
elevation  of a flap might  diminish  the ability  of periosteal  cells  to regenerate  bone  while  an undisturbed  
periosteum  maintains  its osteogenic  potential  (Melcher  1969,  Melcher  1971,  Melcher  1976,  Araujo  and Lindhe  
2005).  It is possible  that flap elevation  affects  alveolar  dimensional  alterations  only  in the short -term  (Tan,  
Wong et  al. 2012).  In guided  bone  regeneration  4 methods  can be used  to increase  the rate of bone  formation 
and to augment  bone  volume:  osteoinduction  by the use of appropriate  growth  factors;  osteoconduction,  
where  a grafting  material  serves  as a scaffold  for new  bone  growth;  distraction  osteogenesis,  by which  a 
fracture  is surgically  induced  and bone  fragments  are then  slowly  pulled  apart;  and finally,  guided  tissue  
regeneration,  which  allows  spaces  maintained  by barrier  membranes  to be filled  with  new  bone  (Hammerle  
and Karring  1998).  Utilizing  these  concepts  it has been  proposed  guided  bone  regeneration  with  non- 
resorbable  and absorbable  membranes,  several  types  of bone  grafts  with  or without  use of barrier  
membranes  or the addition  of mucogingival  treatments  and more  recently  the use of bioactive  molecules  for 
the generation  of bone  in the extraction  socket.  When  analyzing  the results  of the following  described  studies  
it should  be kept  in mind  the goal  of the additional  service  that is provided  to the patient,  which  include:  1.4 RATIONALE  FOR  EXTRACTION  SOCKET  PRESERVATION  
- To enable  installation  and stability  of a dental  implant  
- To reduce  loss of alveolar  bone  volume  
- To reduce  need  for additional  bone  grafting  procedures  
- To enable  the generated  tissues  to provide  implant  osseointegration  
- To improve  the esthetic  outcome  of the final  prosthesis  
- To regenerate  bone  faster  allowing  earlier  implantation  and restoration  
 
 
 
The clinical  advantages  of bone  fillers  in alveolar  ridge  volume  preservation  and prevention  of additional  bone  
grafting  procedure  are largely  supported  by the available  literature  (Sclar  1999,  Iasella,  Greenwell  et al. 2003,  
Luczyszyn,  Papalexiou  et al. 2005,  Fickl,  Zuhr  et al. 2008).  Minimal  ridge  remodeling  has been  observed  when  
using  non-resorbable  hydroxyapatite  crystals  covered  by a rotated  pediculated  split thickness  palatal  flap 
(Nemcovsky  and Serfaty  1996),  DFDBA  covered  with  an ePTFE  membrane  (Brugnami,  Then  et al. 1996)  or even  
allogenic  or xenogenic  bone  grafts  covered  with  nothing  but a collagen  plug  (Sclar  1999,  Wang  and Tsao  2007) 
(Figure  1). Histological  evidence  demonstrates  that bone  formation  occurs  over  the surface  of the implanted  
osteoconductive  graft  particles  (Artzi,  Tal et al. 2000,  Artzi,  Tal et al. 2001).  At 3 months  or later  grafted 
sockets  generally  demonstrate  higher  mineralized  tissue  figures,  when  considering  both  new  vital  bone  and 
remaining  graft  particles,  but the formation  of new  bone  appears  to be similar  in grafted  and non-grafted  
sites.  It can be extrapolated  that residual  particles  occupy  part of the volume  that would  have  been  occupied 
by bone  marrow  if bone  grafting  were  not adopted  (Araujo,  Linder  et al. 2008).  
 
Figure  1. Healing  of the extraction  socket  with  and without  
socket  grafting.  When  socket  grafting  is not adopted  major  
alveolar  ridge  resorption  occurs.  In a first phase,  initially  the 
blood  clot,  subsequently  the granulation  tissue  and later  the 
provisional  matrix  and the woven  bone  fill up the alveolus.  
The bundle  bone  is completely  resorbed  causing  a reduction  
in the vertical  ridge.  In a second  phase  the buccal  wall and 
the woven  bone  are remodeled  causing  the horizontal  and 
further  vertical  ridge  reduction.  When  socket  grafting  is 
adopted,  the first phase  and vertical  bone  reduction  still 
occur,  however  the second  phase  and the horizontal  
contraction are reduced.  1.4.1  RIDGE  PRESERVATION  WITH  BONE  GRAFT  

At earlier  healing  stages  (2 weeks)  instead,  grafted  sockets  demonstrate  xenograft  particles  enclosed  in 
connective  tissue  and coated  by multinucleated  cells  when  nongrafted  sites  already  show  newly  formed  
woven  bone  occupying  most  of the socket  (Araujo,  Linder  et al. 2009).  This response  is typical  of a foreign  
body  reaction  which  can be elicited  by the xenograft  and though  it is clinically  non-immunogenic,  non-toxic  
and chemically  inert  (Luttikhuizen,  Harmsen  et al. 2006),  it results  in a delayed  healing  response  during  the 
earliest  stages  of socket  healing.  Many  articles  reported  only  a partial  resorption  of the grafted  particles  at 
short  and long  timepoints  (Brugnami,  Then  et al. 1996,  Becker,  Clokie  et al. 1998,  Iasella,  Greenwell  et al. 
2003,  Wang  and Tsao  2008,  Araujo,  Linder  et al. 2009,  Mordenfeld,  Hallman  et al. 2010,  Rasperini,  Canullo  et 
al. 2010)  arising  doubts  on the achievement  of the osteointegration  of implants  inserted  in augmented  sites 
and on the success  of the restorative  therapy.  Histological  animal  studies  (Fiorellini,  Kim et al. 2007,  De Santis,  
Botticelli  et al. 2011)  evaluated  the osteointegration  of dental  implants  following  bone  regeneration 
performed  with  different  bone  fillers  and observed  a bone -to-implant  contact  similar  to that of implants 
placed  in pristine  bone  (40%  to 65%).  Furthermore  clinical  studies  observed  that good  primary  stability  can be 
reached  at implant  insertion,  that the grafting  procedure  does  not impair  early  osteointegration  (Carmagnola,  
Adriaens  et al. 2003,  Molly,  Vandromme  et al. 2008)  and that implants  placed  in bone  regenerated  using  
mineralized  grafts  are able  to sustain  loading  and provide  similar  long -term  results  as those  placed  in pristine  
bone  (Fiorellini  and Nevins  2003).  
Mineralized  grafting  materials  may  interfere  with  the earliest  stages  of socket  healing  and their  elimination  
may  require  several  years  (Araujo,  Linder  et al. 2008)  or they  may  in fact be nonresorbable  even  in the long  
term  (Mordenfeld,  Hallman  et al. 2010).  On the other  side,  their  ability  to prevent  crestal  ridge  resorption  and 
sustain  long -term  implant  success  has been  clearly  demonstrated  (Carmagnola,  Adriaens  et al. 2003,  Fiorellini 
and Nevins  2003,  Molly,  Vandromme  et al. 2008).  
Other  advantages  in the use of osteoconductive  grafting  material  were  reported  by a clinical  and histological 
human  study  of post -extractive  defects  in posterior  maxillary  area  treated  with  a xenogenic  graft.  In this study,  
Rasperini  et al. confirmed  the space  maintaining  activity  of the implanted  material  and reported  a decreased  
demand  for sinus  lift augmentation  procedure  when  the socket  preservation  procedure  was performed 
(Rasperini,  Canullo  et al. 2010).  Through  a computed  tomography  analysis  of maxillary  anterior  post  extractive  
defects,  Nevins  et al. reported  that 79%  of grafted  sites  underwent  less than  20%  buccal  plate  loss,  while  71%  
of nongrafted  sites  demonstrated  more  than  20%  buccal  plate  loss.  An interesting  finding  of this investigation  
was that even  the experienced  surgeons  participating  to this study  where  not able  to predict  the fate of the 
buccal  plate,  therefore  the authors  suggested  socket  grafting  to be performed  at the time  of extraction 
(Nevins,  Camelo  et al. 2006).  
 
 
 
The placement  of free soft-tissue  graft  to cover  the augmented  alveolar  socket  was introduced  to minimize  
the soft tissue  shrinkage,  optimize  aesthetical  results  of implant  restoration  and obtain  a primary  closure  that  
may  preserve  the graft  from  bacterial  infections  and secondary  graft  failure  (Stimmelmayr,  Allen  et al. 2010,  
Thalmair,  Hinze  et al. 2010).  The first attempt  to cover  the socket  graft  with  an autogenous  soft tissue  implant  
was described  by Landsberg  and Bichacho  in 1994  (Landsberg  and Bichacho  1994).  Nevins  et al. suggested  the 
use of soft tissue  grafts  to improve  ridge  topography  after  tooth  extraction  (Nevins  and Mellonig  1994)  and in 
combination  with  immediate  implant  placement  (Landsberg  1997).  
In 1999  Tal described  the survival  of circular  connective  tissue  grafts  placed  over  extraction  sockets  treated 
either  with  DFDBA  or Bio-Oss. They  found  that the survival  was not dependent  on the adopted  graft  and that  
at 1 week  18/42  grafts  were  vital,  13/42  were  partially  vital  and 11/42  were  non-vital.  Complete  closure  of all 
sockets  occurred  4 weeks  post  extraction.  The Authors  noted  that more  often  partially  vital  grafts  maintained  
their  vitality  over  the socket  area  more  than  on the graft  margins;  they  concluded  that the nourishment  could 
be originated  from  plasmatic  elements  in the socket  blood  clot more  than  from  vessels  originating  from  the 
periphery  of the graft  (Tal 1999).  
 
 
The use of Geistlich  Mucograft®  is an alternative  to autogenous  soft tissue  graft.  The 3-D collagen  matrix  can 
be used  for root  coverage  procedures  and/or  for gain  of keratinized  tissue  (Nevins,  Nevins  et al. 2011,  
Lorenzo,  Garcia  et al. 2012).  Geistlich  Mucograft®  Seal can be used  over  mineralized  bone  graft  (BioOss®  
Collagen)  after  minimally  invasive  tooth  extraction  in order  to preserve  hard  and soft tissue  volume  for future  
implant  placement  (Jung,  Philipp  et al. 2013).  The collagen  of Geistlich  Mucograft®  is processed  to favor  
immediate  blood  clot stabilization.  This leads  to early  vascularization  (Ghanaati,  Schlee  et al. 2011,  Rocchietta,  
Schupbach  et al. 2012),  facilitates  soft tissue  cell ingrowth  (Ghanaati,  Schlee  et al. 2011),  and excellent  
integration  of the 3-D matrix  within  the surrounding  tissues  (Ghanaati,  Schlee  et al. 2011,  Rocchietta,  
Schupbach  et al. 2012).  In a clinical  trial,  Thoma  and collaborators  evaluated  whether  Geistlich  Mucograft®  
Seal could  improve  early  wound  healing  and esthetics,  and decrease  wound  sensitivity  compared  to 
spontaneous  healing  (Thoma,  Sancho -Puchades  et  al.  2012).  The  authors  reported  that  the  defect  area  1.4.3  GEISTLICH  MUCOGRAFT®  SEAL  OVER  MINERALIZED  BONE  GRAFT  1.4.2  FREE  SOFT -TISSUE  GRAFT  OVER  MINERALIZED  BONE  GRAFT  
decreased  over  time  for both  treatments  and re-epithelization  was completed  in all subjects  by day 15. The 
defect  area  was significantly  smaller  for the Geistlich  Mucograft®  Seal (mean  ± SD: 19.3  ± 3.4 mm2)  compared 
with  control  (21.3  ± 3.3 mm2)  at day 4 (p < 0.05),  and at day 8 (Geistlich  Mucograft®  Seal:  11.7  ± 2.5 mm2;  
control:  13.6  ± 2.9  mm2; p  < 0.01).  The color  match was  more  favorable for  Geistlich Mucograft®  Seal at day 4,  
8 and 29 (p > 0.05).  Somatosensory  measurements  revealed  slightly  lower  wound  sensitivity  at day 4 for 
Geistlich  Mucograft®  Seal compared  with  control.  Jung  and investigators  compared  the use of Geistlich 
Mucograft® Seal along with BioOss® Collagen to  3 differen t socket preservation approaches; 1.  BioOss®  
Collagen  along  with  free gingival  graft,  2. β-tricalcium -phosphate -particles  with  polylactid  coating  (β-TCP),  and 
3. Spontaneous  healing  (control).  Results  demonstrated  that the application  of BioOss®  Collagen,  covered  
with  Geistlich  Mucograft®  Seal or Free  gingival  graft,  resulted  in less vertical  and horizontal  changes  of the 
alveolar  ridge  as compared  with  controls  6 months  after  extraction  (Jung,  Philipp  et al. 2013).  
 
 
 
Aim 1: To evaluate  the clinical  and radiographic  changes  following  socket  graft  + use of collagen  dressing  or 
3D-collagen  matrix  between  baseline  and month -6. 
Aim 2: To evaluate  the volume  changes  on soft tissue  following  socket  graft  + use of collagen  dressing  or 3D- 
collagen  matrix  between  baseline  and month -6, and wound  healing  assessment.  
 
 
 
This study  will be a randomized  clinical  trial involving  a total  of 24 subjects.  We propose  to recruit  subjects 
into 2 groups:  1) Extraction  treated  with  xenograft  bone  substitute  (BioOss  Collagen®)  + collagen  dressing  
(HeliPlug®),  2) Extraction  treated  with  xenograft  bone  substitute  (BioOss  Collagen®)  + 3D-collagen  matrix  
(Mucograft  Seal®).  All subjects  recruited  will have  already  been  approved  and treatment  planned  for 
extraction  + implant  placement  by non-study  personnel  to avoid  any potential  conflict  of interest.  All subjects  
will have  radiographs  that show  the tooth  planned  for extraction.  Each  subject  will be eligible  for only  1 tooth  
extraction  + dental  implant  rehabilitation.  After  tooth  extraction,  subjects  will receive  a standard  site 
preservation  therapy  consisted  with  xenograft  bone  substitute  + collagen  dressing  or the alternative  site 
preservation  therapy  consisted  with  xenograft  bone  substitute  + 3D-collagen  matrix.  After  the conventional  6- 
month  healing  period,  subjects  will receive  a dental  implant  in the previous  extracted  site. During  the dental 
implant procedure,  a 2x5mm  bone  core biopsy  + a 2mm  gingival  biopsy will  be obtained from  the implant site.  3.0 STUDY  DESIGN  2.0 AIMS  
Biopsy  samples  will be stored  for future  histological  and histochemical  analysis.  After  dental  implant  
placement,  all subjects  will receive  a healing  abutment  for soft tissue  healing  prior  to implant  restoration.  
During  the 6-month  healing  time  after  tooth  extraction  and site preservation  therapy,  subjects  will return  at 
week -1, week -2, week -4, month -3, and month -6 for intra -oral scanning  for soft tissue  volumetric  acquirement. 
Subjects  will receive  a Cone  beam  computed  tomography  (CBCT)  prior  to extraction  for the baseline  hard - 
tissue  volume  measurement  and appropriate  extraction  planning  and at 6-month  post -extraction  for 
volumetric  measurement  and appropriate  implant  treatment  planning.  
Hard  tissue  analysis  will be performed  to compare  linear  ridge  remodeling  (baseline  vs. 6-month  healing).  
CBCT  images  will be analyzed  by non-contact  reverse  engineering  system  (Geomagic  software).  Soft tissue  
volumetric  analysis  will be performed  to compare  the soft tissue  healing  between  BioOss  Collagen  + 
Mucograft  Seal and BioOss  Collagen  + Collagen  Dressing.  Images  captured  with  an intra -oral scanner  (Trios,  
3Shape)  collected  at baseline,  week -1, -2, -4, month -3, and month -6.

This  study  will  be  conducted  in  a  single  masked  manner  such  that  all  volumetric  assessments  will  be 
performed  without  knowledge  of the subjects’  type  of treatment.  
 
 
 
Qualified  subjects  will be assigned  randomly  into one of two groups:  12 subjects  into the xenograft  + 3D- 
collagen  group  (Test)  and 12 subjects  into the xenograft  + collagen  dressing  group  (Control).  
The study  coordinator  will place  24 identically  sized  slips  of paper,  12 reading  “Test”  and 12 reading  “Control”,  
into a sealed  envelope.  The study  coordinator  will select  one sealed  envelope  for each  qualified  subject,  and 
record  the randomization  results  and staple  the slip of paper  into the subject  study  folder.  
 
 
 
The subject  population  will be 24 adult  patients  recruited  from  the general  population  by means  of 
advertisements  and flyers  in local  media,  and from  the research  patient  database.  These  24 subjects  will be 
categorized  into 2 groups:  1) Extraction  treated  with  xenograft  bone  substitute  (BioOss  Collagen®)  + collagen  
dressing  (HeliPlug®),  2) Extraction  treated  with  xenograft  bone  substitute  (BioOss  Collagen®)  + 3D-collagen  
matrix  (Mucograft  Seal®).  Subjects  who  require  antibiotic  prophylaxis  prior  to dental  treatment  or those  with  
medical  contraindication  to dental  treatment  will be excluded.  All study  participants  will read,  have  explained  
by study  personnel,  and sign a consent  form  that details  the risks,  benefits,  and requirements  for participation 
in the proposed  study.  
 
 
 Subjects  must  be adult  males  or females  age 18 to 80 years  (inclusive).  
 Subjects  must  be able  and willing  to follow  study  procedures  and instructions  in English.  
 Subjects  must  have  read,  understood  and signed  an informed  consent  form  in English.  
 Subjects  must  have  a maxillary  premolar,  canine,  lateral  incisor,  or central  incisor  with  a 
restorative  or periodontal  hopeless  prognosis  (Kwok  and Caton  2007),  in which  an 
implant  is indicated  without  any sinus  lift required.  
 Subjects  undergoing  implant  placement  should  be in adequate  periodontal  health  prior  
to implant  placement.  This includes  having  probing  depth  ≤ 4 mm for all remaining  teeth 
at the same  quadrant  of the proposed  implant  placement.  Patients  with  periodontal 
probing  sites  with  probing  depths  of up to 5 mm may  also be included  if bleeding  on 
probing  in these  sites  is absent.  Each  subject  should  be considered  to be periodontally  
stable  prior  to the implant  surgery.  4.1 INCLUSION  CRITERIA  4.0 HUMAN  PARTICIPANTS  3.2 RANDOMIZATION  3.1 MASKING  
 
 
 
 Individuals  who  have  a chronic  disease  with  oral manifestations.  
 Individuals  who  exhibit  gross  oral pathology.  
 The use of either  antibiotics  or chronic use  (more  than  7 days)  of NSAIDs  within  1 month  
prior  to screening  examination.  
 Individuals  that require  antibiotic  prophylaxis  prior  to dental  treatment.  
 Chronic  treatment  (i.e. two weeks  or more)  with  any medication  known  to affect  
periodontal  status  (e.g.  phenytoin,  calcium  antagonists,  cyclosporine,  Coumadin)  within

bone  regeneration  (bone  graft  and membrane)  is needed  to repair  the defect,  it will be 
done  at no cost to the subject,  but the subject  will be excluded  from  the study  protocol.  
 
 
 
 
There  should  be no major  changes  in subjects’  medical  status  during  the entire  study  period  for continuation 
of the protocol.  Subjects  not meeting  this criterion  may  be withdrawn.  Any observed  infection  around  the 
implant  will be reported  as an adverse  event  and subject  will be treated  and followed  until  resolved.  Clinical  
judgment  of the dental  provider  will be used  to determine  presence  and severity  of undesired  healing  
response.  Clinical  judgment  will also be used  when  determining  whether  the dental  implant  should  be 
removed  upon  poor  healing  response  and/or  infection.  4.3 CONTINUANCE  CRITERION  4.2 EXCLUSION  CRITERIA  
 
 
 
At screening,  participants  will be assigned  a 3-digit  counter/screening  number  by the study  center  (001,  002,  
etc.).  At treatment  baseline/series,  each  subject  will receive  a unique  4-digit  study  number  (1001,  1002,  etc.)  
that will identify  their  group  status  in the study.  Participants  who  do not complete  the study  will be replaced 
until  24 participants  have  completed  the study.  
 
 
 
 
 
Participants  will be recruited  by advertisement  from  the patient,  student,  and staff  population  at the 
University  of North  Carolina  at Chapel  Hill. In accordance  to UNC  HIPPA  Research  Policy,  a request  to release  
PHI (both  physical  records  and electronic  records)  for the purpose  of research  may  be made  to aid in potential  
participant  recruitment.  If additional  participants  are needed,  they  may  be recruited  from  the general 
population.  We will not recruit  participants  employed  by any of the following  UNC  School  of Dentistry  
departments:  Prosthodontic,  Periodontology  or GO Health  Center.  
 
 
 
 
 
Periodontally  healthy  subjects  who  are eligible  and treatment  planned  for tooth  extraction  and implant  
placement  will be recruited  and examined  for this study.  Screening  and examination  procedures  may  
encompass  up to 9 outpatient  visits  over  an approximate  8-month  period.  
 
 
 
 
Subjects  will contact  the study  coordinator  by telephone  for information  regarding  participation  in the study. 
Study  coordinator/assistant  will perform  a brief  telephone  interview  to determine  whether  or not the patient  
will qualify  based  on age and basic  inclusion  and exclusion  criteria.  Study  coordinator/assistant  will read  a list 
of basic  inclusion  and exclusion  criteria  to potential  subjects  and ask potential  subjects  if they  believe  they  
would  qualify.  Subjects  indicating  they  may  qualify  would  be scheduled  for a screening  examination 
appointment.  5.1 PRE -SCREENING  EXAMINATION  5.0 SCHEDULE  OF PROCEDURES  4.5 RECRUITMENT  4.4 SUBJECT  IDENTIFICATION  
 
 
 
Study  personnel  will provide  each  study  candidate  with  a written  informed  consent  form  at the initial  visit 
prior  to administration  of any research  related  treatment.  Prior  to enrolling  a subject,  study  personnel  will 
explain  to each  subject  the protocol,  procedures  and objectives  of the study,  and the patient’s  role in the 
study,  before  obtaining  consent.  Subjects  will be given  the opportunity  to read  the informed  consent  
document.  Study  personnel  will answer  all questions  that the subject  may  have  and ensure  that the subject  
understood  all aspects  of the study.  When  the subject  understands  and is willing  to participate  in the clinical  
trial,  he/she  must  sign and date  the Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB)  approved  Informed  Consent  Form.  
This screening  visit will consist  of the following  procedures:  
 
- All subjects  will complete  a medical  health  history  questionnaire.  
 
- The reason  for extraction  of the hopeless  tooth  will be documented  (caries,  periodontal  disease,  
infection,  fracture,  resorption).  
- Full mouth  clinical  measurements  including  probing  pocket  depth  (PPD),  clinical  attachment  level  
(CAL),  bleeding  on probing  (BOP)  and gingival  index  (GI) will be performed  on all teeth.  
- Standardized  cone  beam  computed  tomography  (CBCT)  will be taken.  
 
- 3Shape  Trios  scanner  will be used  to make  a digital  impression  of the maxillary  arch.  This will be used 
for surgical  planning,  volumetric  measurements,  and to fabricate  surgical  guides  for implant  
placement.  
 
 
 
All surgeries  will be performed  under  local  anesthesia  using  lidocaine  with  epinephrine,  (Xylocaine  2%® - 
Epinephrine  1:100,000  and 1:50,000,  Dentsply  Pharmaceutical,  York,  PA, USA).  
 
 
 
The baseline  visit should  be completed  within  2 weeks  after  visit 1 (Screening).  The surgeon  will extract  the 
hopeless  tooth  in the following  fashion.  He/she  will make  facial  and lingual  intrasulcular  incisions  with  a 15-C 
scalpel only at the  tooth requiring extraction.  A periotome will then be  used at the  mesial and distal aspects  of 
the tooth  to sever  subcrestal  periodontal  attachment  fibers  and expand  the periodontal  ligament  space.  If 
needed  to allow  periotome  insertion  or facilitate  removal  of a root  tip, a fine long  diamond  bur (e.g.  859-010;  5.3 VISIT  2 (DAY  0): BASELINE  5.3 INTERVENTIONS  5.2 VISIT  1: SCREENING  EXAMINATION  
Brasseler,  Savannah,  Ga, USA)  may  be used  to remove  bone  along  the side of the tooth.  An elevator  will be 
used  to mobilize  the tooth  and then  forceps  will be used  to deliver  the tooth.  Finally,  the socket  will be 
curetted  to remove  all granulomatous  tissue  and irrigated  with  sterile  isotonic  saline  solution.  
 
 
1. Extraction  treated  with  xenograft  bone  substitute  + collagen  dressing:  
 
The debrided socket from the control group will receive  Geistlich Bio-Oss®  Collagen  (250mg) or the  
necessary  amount  to successfully  fill the extraction  socket.  The bone  substitute  material  will be rehydrated 
with  subject’s  blood  or sterile  saline  solution.  A collagen  dressing  (HeliPlug®)  will be used  to cover  the 
grafted  extraction  socket  and sutured  with  resorbable  suturing  material  (5-0 Vicryl  – Ethicon,  Inc.,  
Somerville,  NJ) to stabilize  the wound.  
2. Extraction  treated  with  xenograft  bone  substitute  + 3D-collagen  matrix:  
 
The debrided  socket  from  the test group  will receive  Geistlich  Bio-Oss®  Collagen  (250mg)  or the necessary  
amount  to successfully  fill the extraction  socket.  The bone  substitute  material  will be rehydrated  with 
subject’s  blood  or sterile  saline  solution.  A 3D-collagen  matrix  (Mucograft  Seal®)  will be used  to cover  the 
grafted  extraction  socket  and sutured  with  non-resorbable  (6-0 Prolene  – Ethicon,  Inc.,  Somerville,  NJ) and 
resorbable  (5-0 Vicryl  – Ethicon,  Inc.,  Somerville,  NJ) suturing  material  to stabilize  the collagen  matrix  over  the 
extraction  socket.  
Subjects  in both  groups  will be instructed  to rinse  twice  daily  with  0.12%  chlorhexidine  gluconate  for 30 
seconds  and avoid  brushing  or touching  the area  of extraction  for 2 weeks.  After  2 weeks,  subjects  may  
resume  gentle  brushing  of the surgical  site with  a soft toothbrush.  Sutures  will be removed  2 weeks  following  
the surgical  appointment.  Subjects  will return  at 1 week  and 4 weeks  to assess  plaque  control  and wound  
healing.  
Subjects  will be given  prescriptions  for postoperative  medications  as stated  in Table  1. Patient  will assume  all 
costs  for prescription  medications.  Temporary  appliance  to replace  the missing  tooth  will not be delivered  as 
part of the study.  However,  subjects  can have  their  referring  dentists  fabricating  and delivering  a temporary  
appliance  to replace  the missing  tooth  during  the first 6 months  of the study.  The temporary  appliance  will not 
be covered  by the study.

Full mouth  gingival  scores  shall  be visually  assessed  by segmenting  marginal  and papillary  units,  6 sites  per 
tooth:  distobuccal,  buccal,  mesiobuccal  and distolingual,  lingual,  mesiolingual  surfaces.  The last tooth  in each  
quadrant  will not have  a distal  site.  Gingival  inflammation  shall  be recorded  at each  site on a scale  of 0 to 4. 
0 = absence  of inflammation;  
1 = mild  inflammation  or with  slight  changes  in color  and texture  but not in all portions  of 
gingival  marginal  or papillary;  
2 = mild  inflammation,  such  as the preceding  criteria,  in all portions  of gingival  marginal  on papillary;  
3 = moderate,  bright  surface  inflammation,  erythema,  edema  and/or  hypertrophy  of 
gingival  marginal  or papillary;  
4 = severe  inflammation:  erythema,  edema  and/or  marginal  gingival  hypertrophy  of the unit or spontaneous 
bleeding,  papillary,  congestion  or ulceration.  
 
 
Linear  distance  from  the gingival  margin  (GM)  to base  of the pocket.  If a PD reading  falls between  two 
millimeter  readings,  the rule shall  be to round  down  and the lower  of the two readings  will be recorded.  
 
 
Presence  or absence  of bleeding  to manual  probing  recorded  as a dichotomous  variable.  
 
0-  No bleeding  within  10 seconds  after probing.  
1-  Bleeding  within  10 seconds  after probing.  
 
 
 
Linear  distance  from  the cemento -enamel  junction  (CEJ)  to base  of the pocket.  If a CAL reading  falls between  
two millimeter  readings,  the rule shall  be to round  down  and the lower  of the two readings  will be recorded.  
 
 
 
Cone  Beam  Computed  Tomography  (CBCT)  will be performed  following  screening  and at 6 months  post - 
extraction  prior  to implant  placement.  CBCT  will be used  for pre-surgical  planning  for both  the tooth 
extraction  and implant  placement.  Hard  tissue  linear  measurement  analysis  will be performed  to compare

reliability  of using  this software  to measure  the tissue  alterations  after  tooth  extraction  (Fickl,  Zuhr  et al. 
2008).  
For superimposition  of the original  DICOM  data  (Digital  Imaging  and Communications  in Medicine)  of the two 
CBCT  scans,  a computer -assisted  superimposition  will be done  in selected  areas  of the data  set, where  no 
changes  had taken  place  during  the 6 months  (e.g.  the cranial  base  in the maxilla  or the lower  border  and 
angle  in the mandible  respectively).  By this step,  the two data  sets will be aligned  and manually  checked  for 
perfect  match.  Subsequently,  the measurements  will be made  at baseline  and at 6 months  using  the same  
reference  points  and lines.  To set a reference,  the most  apical  point  of the extraction  socket  will be defined  in 
the baseline  image  and two reference  lines  will be subsequently  drawn.  The vertical  reference  line will be 
drawn  in the center  of the extraction  socket  crossing  the apical  reference  point.  The horizontal  reference  line 
will be drawn  perpendicular  to the vertical  line crossing  the apical  reference  point.  The following  
measurements  with  respect  to  these  reference  points  and  lines  will  be  performed  in  the  center  of  the 
extraction  socket:  
 Thickness  of the buccal  bone  plate  at three  levels  (1mm,  3mm,  and 5mm  below  the lingual  bone  crest).  
 
 Height  of the alveoli  at the mid-buccal  and mid-lingual  aspect.  
 
 The horizontal  ridge  width  measured  at three  levels  (at -1mm,  -3mm,  -5mm)  below  the most  coronal 
aspect  of the crest.  
 Linear  changes  overtime  will be assessed  based  on the measurements  performed  at baseline  and at 6 
months.

measurements  performed  at 3 levels  below  the bone  crest.  
 
 
 
Soft tissue  volumetric  analysis  will be performed  to compare  the soft tissue  healing  between  the test and 
control  groups.  Images  captured  with  an intra -oral scanner  (Trios,  3Shape)  collected  at baseline,  week -1, 
week -2, week -4, month -3, and month -6. Soft tissue  volumetric  analysis  will be performed  to compare  soft 
tissue  ridge  remodeling.  STL files originated  from  intra -oral scanning  images  will be analyzed  by non-contact  
reverse  engineering  system  (Geomagic  Qualify,  Raindrop  Geomagic,  Research  Triangle  Park,  NC, USA).  A 
precision  analysis  study  determined  that surface  reconstruction  on Geomagic  Qualify  software  provides  a 
reliable  analysis  with  a maximum  deviation  of 0.06mm,  standard  deviation  of 0.003mm,  and an average  error  
of 0.002mm  (Wang  2014).  For superimposition  of the original  STL data  (Stereolithography)  of the intra -oral 
scans,  a computer -assisted  superimposition  will be done  in selected  areas  of the data  set, where  no changes  
had taken  place  during  the 6 months  (e.g.  incisal  edges  or occlusal  surfaces  of teeth  not included  in the 
treated  area).  By this step,  the data  sets will be aligned  and manually  checked  for perfect  match.  Volumetric  
changes  overtime  will be assessed  based  on the measurements  performed  baseline,  week -1, week -2, week -4, 
month -3, and month -6 by subtraction  analysis  and expressed  in percentage  values.  
 
 
7.0 STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS  6.6 SOFT  TISSUE  ANALYSIS  
Descriptive  statistics  (means  and standard  deviations  for continuous  variables  and frequencies  for categorical 
variables)  will be produced  for vital  signs,  demographic  characteristics,  medical  history  and clinical  variables,  
both  overall,  and for each  of the two groups  of study  participants.  Summaries  of clinical  variables  will be 
presented  at baseline  and at study  exit.  Adverse  events  (including  onset,  duration,  treatment,  outcome  and 
suspected  causality)  and reasons  for withdrawals  will be listed  and summarized.  
A power  analysis  was performed  using  a statistical  power  calculator  (SAS  Power  Procedure,  Cary,  NC).  This 
study  will have  a sample  size of 24 subjects,  12 in each  of the two groups.  We will have  at least  90%  power  
(with  a Type  I error  rate of 5%) to detect  a difference  of 2.5mm  in the horizontal  ridge  width  measured  at 
3mm  below  the most  coronal  aspect  of the crest,  assuming  a standard  deviation  of 1.6mm,  as determined  by a 
previous  study  (Jung,  Philipp  et al. 2013).  This power  calculation  takes  into account  the estimated  10%  of 
subjects  drop  out. A “p” value  of less than  0.05  will be considered  statistically  significant.  
 
For soft tissue analysis, the primary outcome was the within -participant difference between the linear and 
volume changes at the test and control groups. These differences were measured in each participant prior to 
surgery, as well as 3 and 6 months after surgery, leading to a series of three longitudinal differences  for each 
participant. For each group, the differences at all three time points were analyzed simultaneously using a linear 
mixed model (LMM), in which the actual linear and volume measures were modeled as a function of time 
(categorical), treatment group,  and the interaction of time and treatment, while accounting for the repeated 
measures on each participant with a random participant effect. Given that both time and treatment are 
categorical, our approach was a generalized version of repeated measures ANO VA, as our LMM allowed for 
differing variability in linear and volume measures at each time point. Within each LMM, we also tested for a 
difference between the two treatment groups with respect to the overall time pattern in linear and volume 
measures. Due to the exploratory nature of the analysis, no Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was 
applied .  Statistical significance was defined as a p-value < 0.05.  
For hard tissue analysis, to test the working hypothesis of systematic differences between the  treatment 
groups, a two -sample equal variance student t -test with a two -tailed distribution was performed comparing the 
two groups for each of the linear measurements as well as for the volumetric analysis. Statistical significance 
was defined as a p-value < 0.05.  
 
 
 
 
 
Data  collection  will be conducted  on desktop  and laptop  computers  located  chairside  in the GO Health  Center,  8.1 DATA  COLLECTION  AND  ANALYSIS  8.0 SAFETY  EVALUATIONS  
UNC -School  of Dentistry.  These  computers  are stored  in a locked  area,  and are password  protected.  Daily  data  
backup  is performed  on a password  protected  network  which  moves  the data  to a secure  server.  This prevents 
any inadvertent  breech  in confidentiality  of the data  collected.  Personal  identifying  information  is stored  in a 
separate  secure  database  from  the research  data.  Hard  copies  of the data  sheets  are kept  in a locked  office. 
Research  samples  will be identified  only  by unique  numbers  assigned  to the participants.  The specimens  will 
be coded.  Linkage  to the code  will be retained  by the study  coordinator  in a combination -locked  workspace  
accessible  only  by study  personnel.  
 
 
 
Vital  signs  (pulse,  respiration,  blood  pressure)  will be measured  at each  visit.  At baseline  height  and weight  will 
be determined.  During  test cylinder  placement  and removal  standard  clinical  vital  monitoring  will be 
performed.  
 
 
 
At each  study  visit,  an evaluation  of patients’  extra - and intraoral  structures  will be conducted.  Each  
examination  will include  a survey  of the face,  lymph  nodes,  lips, buccal  mucosa,  floor  of the mouth,  tongue,  
hard  and soft palates,  gingiva,  edentulous  ridges  and teeth.  Findings  will be recorded  as normal  or abnormal. 
Abnormal  findings  will be described  with  respect  to onset,  location,  size (severity)  and diagnosis.  Standardized 
dental  exam  will be conducted  by a calibrated  dentist  or hygienist  with  experience  in conducting  periodontal  
exams.  Even  though  discomfort  is minimal,  each  person’s  tolerance  level  can be different.  The consent  form  
explains  to the subject  they  can stop  the dental  exam  at any time.  The instruments  and materials  used  for the 
screening  exam  are a periodontal  probe,  an examination  mouth  mirror,  a dental  explorer  and 2”x2”  gauze.  
These  four  items  are sterilized  in an autoclave for  30 minutes  in 275 degrees  Fahrenheit (as  recommended  per 
OSHA  standards  in sterilization  of dental  instruments). The  examination  package  with  these  three  items  is 
opened  immediately  before  the exam  so that it remains  sterile.  The examiner  wears  a gown  uses  gloves  and 
wears  a mask.  For radiographs,  standard  precautions  including  using  the lowest  dose possible  and using  a lead  
apron  during  the x-rays to minimize  exposure.  
 
 
 
At screening,  the patient's  age, sex, racial,  and ethnic  group,  and smoking  status  will be recorded.  In addition,  
the subject's  medical  history  will be reviewed;  concurrent  medications  will be recorded  and height  and weight  
will be measured.  At every  study  visit medical  history  will be updated,  weight  will be measured;  concurrent  
medications  and infections  will be reviewed.  
 
 9.0 CONDITION  FOR  DISCONTINUING  PARTICIPANTS  8.4 PATIENT  DEMOGRAPHICS  AND  MEDICAL  HISTORY  8.3 EXAMINATION  OF THE  ORAL  CAVITY  8.2 VITAL  SIGNS  MEASUREMENTS  
Participants  in this clinical  study  may  be discontinued  for any of the following  reasons:  1) concurrent  illness  
that would  compromise  immune  response  or healing;  2) protocol  violations;  3) administrative  reasons;  4) 
withdrawal  of consent;  or 5) poor  healing  response.  
Subjects  with  dehisced,  fenestrated,  or fractured  labial/buccalwith  dehisced,  fenestrated,  or fractured  
labial/buccal  alveolar  bone  plate  determined  after  baseline  CBCT  or after  tooth  extraction  where  more  than 
50%  of the buccal  bone  height  is not present.  In this case,  if the surgeon  determines  that guided  bone  
regeneration  (bone  graft  and membrane)  is needed  to repair  the defect,  it will be done  at no cost to the 
subject,  but the subject  will  be  excluded  from  the  study  protocol  alveolar  bone  plate  determined  after  
baseline  CBCT  will exited  the study.  If after  tooth  extraction  more  than  50%  of the buccal  bone  height  is not 
present,  the surgeon  will perform  guided  bone  regeneration  (bone  graft  and collagen  membrane)  to repair  the 
defect,  it will be done  at no cost to the subject,  but the subject  will be excluded  from  the study  protocol.  
Any subject  presenting  with  healing  response  that in the judgment  of the clinical  provider  may  result  in either  
infection,  loss of osseous  structure  or soft tissue  healing  abnormalities  to any of the surgical  procedures,  will 
have  the graft  material  or dental  implant  removed  immediately.  If any healing  problems  arise,  a second 
therapist  not associated  with  the investigation  will evaluate  the patient  to decide  whether  the subject  should 
be exited  or can continue.  Moreover,  each  subject  with  poor  tissue  response  or exited  for any reason  will be 
monitored  until  healing  has resolved  and appropriate  care  is provided  to restore  existing  structures.  
 
 
 
All participants  prematurely  discontinued  from  the study,  regardless  of cause  will be encouraged  and given 
the opportunity  to be seen  for a final  evaluation.  The reason(s)  for withdrawal  will be recorded  in the CRF by 
the study  coordinator  and/or  investigator.  
 
 
 
Protocol  Deviations  will be recorded  by the study  coordinator.  
 
 
 
An adverse  experience  (AE) is any experience  that suggests  a significant  hazard,  contraindication,  side effect,  
or precaution.  With  respect  to human  clinical  experience,  a serious  adverse  experience  includes  any untoward  
event  that is fatal  or life-threatening,  is permanently  disabling,  requires  or prolongs  hospitalization,  is a 
congenital  anomaly,  cancer,  result  of an overdose,  or requires  intervention  to prevent  permanent  damage.  In 11.0  ADVERSE  EVENTS  10.0  PROTOCOL  DEVIATIONS  8.1 HANDLING  OF WITHDRAWALS  
the event  of a serious  adverse  experience,  the principal  investigator  or study  coordinator  must  be contacted  
immediately  by telephone.  In the event  that the principal  investigator  or study  coordinator  cannot  be directly  
reached,  a message  must  be left by voice  mail  withi n 24 hours  of the incident.  
All adverse  events  will be recorded  although  a distinction  will be drawn  between  reactions  normally  
experienced  in conjunction  with  conventional  periodontal  therapy  extractions  and experiences  not usually  
encountered.  Unanticipated  or possible  related  adverse  events  will be evaluated  by open  questioning  
throughout  the trial.  Examples  of adverse  events  that may  warrant  subject  removal  from  study  participation  
include:  infection,  loss of primary  stabilization,  excessive  inflammation,  swelling,  bleeding  or pain.  The onset,  
duration,  treatment,  and outcome  of all such  unanticipated  adverse  experiences  must  be recorded  on the 
appropriate  case  report  forms  and reported  within  7 business  days  to the Biomedical  IRB. All anticipated  and 
unrelated  adverse  experiences  will be recorded  on the appropriate  case  report  forms.  
The following  definitions  of severity  should  be used  in the evaluation  of AEs:  
 Mild : an AE that is easily  tolerated  and does  not interfere  with  daily  activities.  
 Moderate : an AE that is sufficiently  discomforting  so as to interfere  with  daily  activities  or 
receive  interventional  treatment.  
 Severe : an AE that prevents  normal  everyday  activity.  
The following  definitions  of relationship  to implant  surgery  should  be used  in assessing  the suspected  causality  
of an AE: 
 Probably  Related : there  is a direct  cause  and effect  relationship  between  the AE and the 
surgical  procedure  
 Possibly  Related : a direct  cause  and effect  relationship  between  the surgical  procedure  and the 
AE has not been  demonstrated,  but is likely,  possible,  or cannot  be ruled  out, even  if 
improbable  
 Unlikely  Related : a direct  cause  and effect  relationship  between  the surgical  procedure  and the 
AE has not been  demonstrated,  and,  from  the available  data,  indicate  that a relationship 
probably  does  not exist,  but cannot  be definitely  ruled  out 
 Remote : a direct  cause  and effect  relationship  between  the surgical  procedure  and the AE has 
not been  demonstrated,  and,  the event  appears  to have  been  caused  by something  other  than 
the study  device  
 Not related : a direct  cause  and effect  relationship  between  the AE and a source  other  than  the 
surgical  procedure  has been  demonstrated  and documented
